The complete mitochondrial genome of
Flustra foliacea (Ectoprocta, Cheilostomata) compositional bias affects phylogenetic
analyses of lophotrochozoan relationships

Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic relationships of the lophophorate lineages, ectoprocts, brachiopods and phoronids,
within Lophotrochozoa are still controversial. We sequenced an additional mitochondrial genome of the most
species-rich lophophorate lineage, the ectoprocts. Although it is known that there are large differences in the
nucleotide composition of mitochondrial sequences of different lineages as well as in the amino acid composition
of the encoded proteins, this bias is often not considered in phylogenetic analyses. We applied several approaches
for reducing compositional bias and saturation in the phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genome (16,089 bp) of Flustra foliacea (Ectoprocta, Gymnolaemata,
Cheilostomata) was sequenced. All protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes are transcribed from the same strand.
Flustra shares long intergenic sequences with the cheilostomate ectoproct Bugula, which might be a
synapomorphy of these taxa. Further synapomorphies might be the loss of the DHU arm of the tRNA L(UUR), the
loss of the DHU arm of the tRNA S(UCN) and the unique anticodon sequence GAG of the tRNA L(CUN). The gene
order of the mitochondrial genome of Flustra differs strongly from that of the other known ectoprocts.
Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial nucleotide and amino acid data sets show that the lophophorate lineages
are more closely related to trochozoan phyla than to deuterostomes or ecdysozoans confirming the
Lophotrochozoa hypothesis. Furthermore, they support the monophyly of Cheilostomata and Ectoprocta. However,
the relationships of the lophophorate lineages within Lophotrochozoa differ strongly depending on the data set
and the used method. Different approaches for reducing heterogeneity in nucleotide and amino acid data sets
and saturation did not result in a more robust resolution of lophotrochozoan relationships.
Conclusion: The contradictory and usually weakly supported phylogenetic reconstructions of the relationships
among lophotrochozoan phyla based on mitochondrial sequences indicate that these alone do not contain
enough information for a robust resolution of the relations of the lophotrochozoan phyla. The mitochondrial gene
order is also not useful for inferring their phylogenetic relationships, because it is highly variable in ectoprocts,
brachiopods and some other lophotrochozoan phyla. However, our study revealed several rare genomic changes
like the evolution of long intergenic sequences and changes in the structure of tRNAs, which may be helpful for
reconstructing ectoproct phylogeny.

Background
Molecular systematics has dramatically changed the
ideas about the phylogenetic relationships of the lophophorate lineages, ectoproct bryozoans, brachiopods and
phoronids. Once considered the sister or paraphyletic
stem-group of Deuterostomia based on embryological
and morphological characters [1-5], molecular analyses
almost unequivocally place them in Lophotrochozoa, a
group established to accommodate the lophophorate
lineages along with trochozoans, Annelida, Mollusca
and relatives [6]. These analyses rely on a spectrum of
molecular data ranging from rDNA sequences [6-16],
mitochondrial protein sequences [17-19], single nuclear
protein-encoding genes [20,21], Hox genes [22,23], multiple nuclear protein-encoding sequences [24,25] and
phylogenomic approaches [26-34].
However, the relationships of the lophophorate
lineages within Lophotrochozoa are still controversial,
because analyses of different data sets resulted in conflicting topologies. Whereas analyses of rDNA data sets
[7,8,14-16,35,36] and phylogenomic data sets [27,29,34]
strongly support Brachiozoa, a clade including Brachiopoda and Phoronida, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences most often indicated sister group
relationships between Brachiopoda and Ectoprocta
[19,37-39] and between Phoronida and Entoprocta
[37-39]. Thus, these analyses also contradict the monophyly of Bryozoa (= Polyzoa) including Ectoprocta and
Entoprocta (and Cycliophora, of which no mitochondrial
genome is available so far) as postulated based on morphological arguments by Nielsen [40,41] and found in
some recent analyses of phylogenomic data sets
[26,29-34] and of rDNA data sets [14-16], albeit with
poor nodal support.
There is evidence that the inference of the relationships of the lophophorate lineages in phylogenomic analyses might be affected by systematic errors resulting
from compositional bias [34]. One possibility to check
for systematic errors in phylogenetic analyses is the
comparison of the results based on independent data
sets. Therefore, we analysed a mitochondrial data set in
this study and compared the phylogenetic results with
those of phylogenomic analyses, in which no or only
few mitochondrial data have been considered. We
sequenced an additional mitochondrial genome of the
most species-rich lophophorate lineage, the ectoprocts.
Because there are large differences in the nucleotide
composition of mitochondrial sequences of different
lineages as well as in the amino acid composition of the
encoded proteins [42-48], we applied several approaches
for reducing compositional bias in the phylogenetic analyses. We reduced the compositional heterogeneity by
excluding third codon positions from the nucleotide

data set, by excluding taxa with strongly deviating
amino acid composition and by recoding amino acids in
bins. As an alternative to reducing compositional heterogeneity in the data, we applied phylogenetic inference
methods with nonstationary models of evolution.
Finally, we tried to mitigate saturation and long-branchattraction problems by excluding fast evolving sites.

Results and Discussion
Organization of the mitochondrial genome of the
ectoproct Flustra foliacea

The mitochondrial genome sequence of the ectoproct
Flustra foliacea (Gymnolaemata, Cheilostomata) is
16,089 bp long and consists of 13 protein-encoding
genes (atp6, atp8, cox1-3, cob, nad1-nad6 and nad4L)
and two rRNA genes for the small and large subunits
(rrnS and rrnL), as is typical for animal mitochondrial
genomes (Figure 1). In addition to the 22 usual tRNA
genes (Figure 2), a second putative tRNA gene for tryptophan is found. All protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA
genes are transcribed from the same strand, as is the
case with the protein-encoding and rRNA genes of the
other cheilostomate ectoprocts with known mitochondrial genomes, Bugula neritina [38] and Watersipora
subtorquata [49]. There is a major non-coding region
(678 bp long) with a high A+T content of 65.8%, which
might be the origin of replication. However, as in
Bugula, there are several additional long intergenic
sequences (Figure 1) that sum up to 997 bp; 16 of them
are longer than 10 bp, the maximum being 132 bp.
Such long intergenic sequences are missing in Watersipora and the ctenostomate Flustrellidra [19]. Thus, they
might be synapomorphies of the lineages leading to
Flustra and Bugula. However, no conserved sequence
motifs could be identified by blast searches with the
noncoding regions of Flustra against the noncoding
regions of Bugula.
Transfer RNA genes

A second putative tRNA gene for tryptophan as found
here in Flustra foliacea (Figure 2) has neither been found
in the other known mitochondrial genomes of ectoprocts
nor in most other animal mitochondrial genomes. There
is no similarity between the sequence of this putative
tRNA gene and any of the other tRNA genes in the mitochondrial genome of Flustra. It is proximate to the major
non-coding region. We cannot exclude the possibility that
it is functionally part of the control region. Nevertheless,
its structure is very similar to a tRNA and it is likely that it
is at least derived from a tRNA. The two leucine and one
of the serine tRNAs lack a DHU arm. The DHU arm of
the tRNA L(UUR) is also missing in the cheilostomate
Bugula, but not in the cheilostomate Watersipora and the

Figure 1 Structure of the mitochondrial genome of Flustra foliacea(GenBank accession number JQ061319). The arrows indicate the
direction of transcription. Numbers indicate noncoding nucleotides between genes (negative values refer to gene overlaps). The tRNA genes are
named using single-letter amino acid abbreviations. Those coding for leucine, serine and tryptophan are named L1 for the tRNALeu(CUN)
(anticodon UAG) gene, L2 for the tRNALeu(UUR) (anticodon UAA) gene, S1 for the tRNASer(AGN) (anticodon UCU) gene, S2 for the tRNASer(UCN)
(anticodon UGA) gene, and W1 for the tRNATrp(UGR) (anticodon UCA) gene and W2 for the tRNATrp(UGR) (anticodon UCA) gene. The genomic
features are described in the table on the right. a: Start and end positions of rRNA genes and MNCR determined by boundaries of adjacent

ctenostomate Flustrellidra, whereas the DHU arm of the
tRNA L(CUN) is also missing in Flustrellidra, but not in
Bugula and Watersipora. Given the relations of these taxa,
the loss of the DHU arm of the tRNA L(UUR) might be a
synapomorphy of the lineages leading to Flustra and
Bugula, whereas the loss of the DHU arm of the tRNA L
(CUN) occurred most likely independently in Flustra and
Flustrellidra. The DHU arm of the tRNA S(UCN) is also
missing in Bugula, but not in Watersipora and might be
another synapomorphy of the lineages leading to Flustra
and Bugula. This tRNA has not been found in
Flustrellidra.
The inferred anticodons of 21 tRNAs of Flustra foliacea (Figure 2) are the same as those in Bugula neritina.
Only the anticodon of the tyrosine tRNA differs
between Flustra and Bugula. The anticodon of tyrosine
tRNA is GUA in Flustra, but AUA in Bugula. Because
the anticodon of the Watersipora and Flustrellidra tyrosine tRNAs is also GUA, the change to AUA is probably
an autapomorphy of the lineage leading to Bugula. The

anticodon of the tRNA L(CUN) of Flustra and Bugula is
GAG. This has not been found in any other metazoan
so far. In Watersipora and Flustrellidra the anticodon of
the tRNA L(CUN) is UAG. Thus, the sequence GAG
may represent a unique synapomorphy of the lineages
leading to Bugula and Flustra.
The most conserved region of all tRNAs is the anticodon stem and loop region (Figure 2). All other tRNA
regions have a high level of variation within Ectoprocta.
Especially the TΨC arm is highly variable. The tRNAs
with the highest nucleotide conservation across the four
ectoprocts are Gly, His, Ile, Met, Phe, Pro and Trp1.
Less conserved tRNAs are Arg, Asn, Ser2, Lys, Thr and
Trp2. As expected from the phylogenetic relationships,
the tRNA sequences of Flustra are most similar to those
of the cheilostomate entoprocts Watersipora (p-distance
based on all concatenated tRNAs equals 0.357) and
Bugula (p-distance 0.361), whereas those of the cheilostomate Flustrellidra are more dissimilar (p-distance
0.461).

Comparison of mitochondrial gene order

The order of the protein-encoding and rRNA genes is
highly variable within ectoprocts (Figure 3). The only
conserved block in the cheilostomate ectoprocts Flustra and Bugula including three or more genes is cob-

nad4L-nad4-nad5. There is no block of three or more
genes with identical order in Flustra and the cheilostomate Watersipora or the ctenostomate ectoproct
Flustrellidra. The block cob-nad4L-nad4-nad5 is also
present in several other lophotrochozoans, e.g.,

entoprocts, phoronids, and some molluscs. Thus, it
might be a symplesiomorphy within ectoprocts. All
breakpoint distances between the three cheilostomate
ectoprocts (Flustra, Bugula and Watersipora) calculated with CREx [50] amount to 12, the breakpoint
distances between the three cheilostomate ectoprocts
and the ctenostomate ectoproct Flustrellidra to 13
and the breakpoint distances between the ectoprocts
and other lophophorates and entoproct to 9-15 (Table
1). The breakpoint distances between the three brachiopods are 13-15. Thus, there were so many gene
order rearrangements within Ectoprocta and within
Brachiopoda that there is almost no chance to reconstruct older rearrangements, which might provide evidence for the relationships of ectoprocts and
brachiopods with other lophotrochozoans. In contrast,
gene order rearrangements may be useful for inferring
phylogeny within ectoprocts and brachiopods. However, a denser taxon sampling is necessary to resolve
the sequence of rearrangements that caused the many
differences observed within ectoprocts and
brachiopods.

Nucleotide composition and codon usage

There is a high variation in nucleotide composition of
metazoan mitochondrial genomes. In our data set the
variation of overall A+T content ranges from 51.4%

(Balanoglossus) to 78.6% (Heptathela), with an average
overall value equal to 66.5% (Table 2). The lowest values
are found in Deuterostomia (average value 61.1%), the
highest in Ecdysozoa (average value 69.7%). The average
value of Lophotrochozoa (66.5%) and the overall A+T
content of Flustra foliacea (66.5%) equal exactly the
overall average (Table 2). The overall A+T content of
Flustra foliacea corresponds with the A+T content of
the partial mitochondrial genome of the phoronid Phoronis psammophila (66.6%) and is intermediate between
that of the other sequenced cheilostomate ectoprocts
Bugula neritina (70.0%) and Watersipora subtorquata
(70.6%) and the entoprocts Loxocorone allax (73.4%)
and Loxosomella aloxiata (70.6%) on the one hand, and
that of the ctenostomate ectoproct Flustrellidra hispida
(59.4%) and of the brachiopods (Terebratulina retusa:
57.2%; Terebratalia transversa: 59.1%; Laqueus rubellus:
58.3%) on the other. The high A+T content is also
reflected in the individual protein-encoding genes (Table
3). It is especially high at third codon positions (72.4%).
There is a high variation in AT- and GC-skews in
metazoan mitochondrial genomes. In our data set ATskews range from -0.430 (Echinococcus) to 0.209 (Trichinella) (Table 2). The range of GC-skews extends from
-0.412 (Nautilus) to 0.515 (Echinococcus) (Table 2).
Compared with other ectoprocts, Flustra foliacea is
characterized by high AT- and GC-skews (Table 2).
Among lophophorates, similarly high AT- and GCskews have been found only in some brachiopods
(Laqueus, Terebratalia). Nine genes of Flustra (atp6,
cox3, cob, nad1, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, nad6) have
an AT-skew higher than 0.3 and ten genes (atp8, cox2,
cox3, nad1, nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, nad6) have
a GC-skew higher than 0.3 (Table 3). The GC-skew is
positive for all 13 protein-encoding and the two ribosomal RNA genes, whereas the AT-skew is positive for all
13 protein-encoding genes, but negative for the two
ribosomal RNA genes in Flustra foliacea mitochondria
(Table 3).
There are 3,605 codons for all protein coding genes in
the mitochondrial genome of Flustra. The total number
of codons is similar in the cheilostomate ectoprocts
(3,605-3,668), whereas it was distinctly lower in the ctenostomate ectoproct Flustrellidra (3,356). Corresponding to the high percentage of T in the mitochondrial
genome of Flustra, there is a bias towards T-rich codons
(Additional file 1). The most frequently used codons are
UUU (296 times) for phenylalanine, UUA (239) and
UUG (231) for leucine, AUU (196) for isoleucine, and
GUU (185) for valine. The most often used codon
families in Flustra are Leu1, Val, Phe, Gly and Ser2. The
least represented codon families are His, Gln, Arg, Cys
and the termination codons. Compared with other

Page 6 of 19

ectoprocts, Flustra has a higher Leu1 and Val and a
lower Leu2 and Thr codon usage (Figure 4, Additional
file 1).
Four-fold degenerate codon usage is A/T biased in the
third position, and T is the preferred nucleotide (Additional file 1). T is also the preferred nucleotide in twofold degenerate codons ending in T or C. The codon
usage is less biased in two-fold degenerate codons ending in A or G, with A predominating in Leu1, Lys and
Met, and G predominating in Gln, Glu, Trp and the termination codons.
Phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of the
lophophorate lineages

The major results of the phylogenetic analyses of the
nucleotide as well as the amino acid sequences of the
mitochondrial protein-encoding genes concerning the
relationships of the lophophorate lineages, ectoprocts,
brachiopods and phoronids, are summarized in Table 4.
Initially, we included all completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes of lophophorate lineages in the phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 2). However, the
mitochondrial genes of the brachiopod Lingula are generally longer and deviate considerably in sequence from
their orthologs in other animals [51]. Therefore, these
sequences introduced ambiguities into the alignments.
Thus, we excluded this taxon from all further phylogenetic analyses.
The newly sequenced cheilostomate ectoproct Flustra
clusters in all analyses with the two other included cheilostomate ectoprocts Bugula and Watersipora. Ectoprocta is also monophyletic in all analyses. In the
majority of the analyses Flustra is sister group to
Bugula. Only in some analyses Bugula is sister taxon to
Watersipora instead. A closer relationship of Bugula to
Flustra than to Watersipora (or other Lepraliomorpha,
to which Watersipora belongs) is also supported by the
presence of long intergenic sequences and the structure
of some tRNAs in these taxa (see above) and by phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and
cox1 sequences [52].
The lophophorate lineages are usually more closely
related to trochozoan phyla than to deuterostomes or
ecdysozoans confirming the Lophotrochozoa hypothesis.
Only in a few of the analyses, ectoprocts cluster with a
long-branch group including platyhelminths, nematodes
and chaetognaths. However, the sister group relationships of the lophophorate lineages within Lophotrochozoa differ strongly depending on the data set, method
and evolutionary model (Table 4). The different sister
group relationships are not strongly supported by the
data and may be affected by stochastic as well as systematic errors. Surprisingly, a sister group relationship

relationship between brachiopods and annelids is comparatively well-supported (86% bootstrap value). In this
as well as in several of the following analyses platyhelminths, nematodes and chaetognaths, all of them characterized by high substitution rates, form a
monophylum, so that neither Ecdysozoa nor Lophotrochozoa are monophyletic. Such long branch artefacts
have also been found in most other phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial nucleotide and amino acid
sequences (e.g., [32,38,39,55]). The topology of the maximum likelihood tree based on the nucleotide alignment
edited with Gblocks [56] (including 6,839 positions) differs from that based on the alignment edited with ALISCORE only with regard to nodes that are not well
supported in any of the trees (Additional file 4). The

likelihood analysis of this data set with the MtZoa+F
model (Additional file 6) resulted again in a long-branch
attraction of platyhelminths, nematodes and chaetognaths. The monophyly of most of the lophotrochozoan
phyla with the exception of the molluscs is strongly supported in both analyses, but the relationships between
these phyla remains unresolved. The maximum likelihood
tree based on the amino acid sequences edited with
Gblocks [56] (Additional file 7) does not differ from that
edited with ALISCORE in any strongly supported nodes.
In the Bayesian inference tree ectoprocts are sister group
of annelids (posterior probability 0.84), and brachiopods
are sister group of this monophylum (0.75). Phoronida is
sister group of a clade consisting of Nemertea and Polyplacophora (0.76). In contrast, according to the maximum
likelihood tree ectoprocts are sister group to the longbranch group consisting of nematodes, platyhelminths
and chaetognaths. Brachiopods are sister group of annelids (52% bootstrap probability) and phoronids are sister
group of entoprocts (52%).
Evaluation of compositional heterogeneity of
mitochondrial nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic
analyses accounting for it

A chi-square test indicates that the nucleotide composition of the used mitochondrial nucleotide sequences is
significantly heterogeneous between lineages (chi-square
= 23,209 (df = 144), P = 0.000). This is confirmed by
the matched-pairs tests of symmetry, according to

which 99.6% of the pairwise comparisons show significant (P < 0.050) heterogeneity. Although the nucleotide
composition is heterogeneous at all codon positions, it
is less pronounced at the first (chi-square = 5,814 (df =
144), P = 0.000; 97.5% significantly heterogeneous pairs)
and second (chi-square = 2,990 (df = 144), P = 0.000;
90.7% significantly heterogeneous pairs) than at the
third codon positions (chi-square 24,521 (df = 144), P =
0.000; 99.3% significantly heterogeneous pairs).
A maximum likelihood analysis based on the first and
second codon positions only resulted in a reduction of
the support for a brachiopod-annelid sister group relationship (Figure 5B), indicating that this grouping might
be an artefact resulting from compositional bias.
Alternatively, we accounted for the compositional heterogeneity in the nucleotide sequences by using the
nonstationary model implemented in nhPhyML-Discrete. This analysis requires a starting tree, for which we
used the maximum likelihood tree obtained with the
nucleotide data set and the GTR model as well as the
Bayesian inference tree based on the amino acid
sequences obtained with the CAT model (see below).
The two analyses resulted in strongly different topologies (Additional file 8, 9). The tree obtained with the
starting tree based on the nucleotide data set and the
GTR model had a slightly higher likelihood (loglk =
-375,007) than the tree obtained with the starting tree
based on the amino acid data set (loglk = -375,103). In
the latter platyhelminths are included in

Unless noted otherwise, the analyses are based on alignments edited with ALISCORE and the nucleotide alignments are derived from the amino acid alignments.
If a group is monophyletic, the posterior probability respectively the bootstrap support is given.

Lophotrochozoa and phoronids are sister group of ectoprocts, whereas in the former platyhelminths are the sister group of nematodes and Phoronis is nested in
Nemertea.
Evaluation of compositional heterogeneity of
mitochondrial amino acid sequences and phylogenetic
analyses accounting for it

We evaluated the potential influence of compositional
heterogeneity in the amino acid data set on the phylogenetic analyses by a posterior predictive test based on the
PhyloBayes analysis of the complete data set (Table 5;
Additional file 10). This test indicates that the assumption of compositional homogeneity made by most models for amino acid sequence evolution is strongly
violated in the mitochondrial amino acid data (global Z
score 8.657, Table 5; Additional file 10). The test statistic for individual taxa indicates that the amino acid
composition of 40 of the 49 taxa is significantly deviating. The compositional bias is much stronger than that
found in a nuclear ribosomal protein data set [34].
Thus, there might be artifacts resulting from

compositional bias in the trees calculated with the usual
evolutionary models.
One approach to reduce the compositional heterogeneity of the data set is the exclusion of taxa with strongly
deviating amino acid composition. Obviously, not all 40
taxa with significantly deviating amino acid composition
can be removed from the phylogenetic analysis. After
excluding the ten taxa with the most strongly deviating
amino acid composition from the calculations (Additional
files 11, 12), the CAT model is still significantly violated
(global Z score 7.308; Table 5; Additional file 10) and the
test statistic for individual taxa indicates that the amino
acid composition of 32 taxa is significantly deviating.
Remarkably, Ectoprocta and Entoprocta form a monophylum, Bryozoa, in the maximum likelihood tree based
on the reduced data set as in some analyses of phylogenomic [26,27,29-34] and rDNA data sets [14-16], albeit
with no nodal support (Additional file 12).
Another approach for reducing compositional heterogeneity is recoding of amino acids in bins. We determined bins that minimize compositional heterogeneity
with the minmax method described by Susko and Roger

[57]. Whereas the minimum P values for 10 or more
bins are smaller than 0.05 (Additional file 13), the minimum P value for 9 minmax chi-squared bins (D, PV,
AIMSY, GFT, L, NH, W, RCQK, E) is 0.112, which indicates that compositional homogeneity cannot be rejected
for these bins according to the chi-square test. However,
a posterior predictive test shows that the compositional
heterogeneity has not been reduced (global Z score
8.690) and that the CAT model is still significantly violated (Table 5; Additional file 10) if the amino acid
sequences of the mitochondrial proteins were recoded
using these bins. This contradiction between the results

of the chi-square test and the posterior predictive test
might be explained by the fact that the chi-square test
does not consider correlation due to relatedness of the
taxa on a tree or by the biasing effect of invariable sites
on this test [58,59]. A reduction of the categories to 6
minmax chi-squared bins resulted only in a minor
reduction of the compositional heterogeneity (global Z
score 7.196; Table 5; Additional file 10) despite the
minimum P value for 6 bins (GFTW, AHILMSY, NPV,
E, D, RCQK) being 0.21 according to the chi-square test.
Alternatively, we recoded the amino acid data into the
six groups of amino acids (AGPST, C, DENQ, FWY,

HKR, ILMV) that tend to replace one another [60]. A
posterior predictive test showed that the compositional
heterogeneity even increased (global Z score 11.285)
compared to the unrecoded data set (Table 5; Additional file 10).
The phylogenetic analyses of recoded data sets (Additional files 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) yielded again contradictory results concerning the relationships of the
lophophorate lineages (Table 4). None of the possible
relationships of the lophophorate lineages is strongly
supported.
We analysed the amino acid sequences also with a
non-stationary model of sequence evolution by performing a Bayesian analysis with the CAT-BP model as
implemented in the program nhPhyloBayes [61]. We
started 16 chains with the mitochondrial amino acid
data set. The mean number of breakpoints N, at which
the amino acid composition changes, varied between 34
and 47. Because the prior on N used in the CAT-BP
model is conservative, an N as high as observed in our
analysis confirms that there is compositional bias in the
data. The high number of breakpoints reflects the result
of the posterior predictive test that 40 taxa belonging to
several different clades have amino acid compositions
that significantly deviate from the assumptions of the
CAT model (Additional file 10). Despite almost nine
weeks of calculation for each chain on a 2.8 GHz processor no convergence of the chains was achieved. A
consensus of all chains is shown for illustrative purposes
(Additional file 20). Lophotrochozoa including Platyhelminthes is monophyletic, but the relationships between
lophotrochozoan phyla are largely unresolved.
Phylogenetic analyses accounting for saturation

Finally, we tried to mitigate saturation and long-branchattraction problems by excluding fast evolving sites. We
removed 20% of the positions with high rates from the
nucleotide alignment (10,118 nucleotides remaining)
and 10% of the amino acid alignment positions (2,456
amino acid remaining). Despite the exclusion of the fastest evolving sites, the long-branch group including platyhelminths, nematodes and chaetognaths could not be

broken up (Additional file 21, 22) and the relationships
between the lophotrochozoan phyla could not be
resolved more robustly. However, there is strong support (98% bootstrap probability) for a sister group relation between brachiopods and annelids in the tree based
on the nucleotide data set.

Conclusions
Altogether, the results obtained in the phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial nucleotide and amino acid
sequences are contradictory and weakly supported by
the data (Table 4). Most of the results concerning the
phylogenetic relationships of the lophophorate lineages
are in strong contrast to the results of recent phylogenomic analyses [26,27,29-31,33,34] and phylogenetic
analyses of nuclear rDNA [14-16] that support the
monophyly of Bryozoa (= Polyzoa) including Ectoprocta
and Entoprocta as well as the monophyly of Brachiozoa
including Brachiopoda and Phoronida. Jang and Hwang
[38] showed that a topology test based on mitochondrial
amino acid data rejects both, Brachiozoa and Bryozoa.
Thus, the differences between the phylogenetic results
based on mitochondrial data and the phylogenomic analysis based mainly or exclusively on nuclear data cannot
be attributed to stochastic errors alone. The posterior
predictive tests indicate that the phylogenetic analyses of
the mitochondrial amino acid sequences are strongly
affected by compositional bias, a systematic error source
that is not taken into account by topology tests. Thus,
the apparent contradiction between the phylogenetic
results based on mitochondrial amino acid data and the
phylogenomic analyses may be due to compositional
bias. This is supported by the results of the approaches
to reduce compositional heterogeneity in the data sets
respectively the analyses with non-stationary models
(Table 4). Although Bryozoa including Ectoprocta and
Entoprocta were rejected in the topology tests performed by Jang and Hwang [38] based on mitochondrial
amino acid data, Bryozoa was found in our maximum
likelihood analysis with the MtZoa+F model with the 39
taxa set, albeit with no nodal support (Additional file
12).

Nesnidal et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:572
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/572

Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear protein sequence data
of Metazoa are also affected by compositional bias
[34,62]. However, none of several approaches accounting
for this bias supported a sister group relationship
between Ectoprocta and Brachiopoda or between Phoronida and Entoprocta [34] as did some of the phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial data ([19,37-39]; Table
4).
The weak support for relationships between phyla in
the analyses based on the mitochondrial data (Table 4)
indicates that the information content of the mitochondrial sequence data set, which is almost one magnitude
smaller than current phylogenomic data sets, is insufficient for a robust resolution of the divergences of the
lophotrochozoan phyla (see also [19,38]). In addition,
the strong compositional bias in the mitochondrial data
(Table 5; Additional file 10) complicates phylogenetic
analyses of these data. The high variability of the gene
order in some lophotrochozoan phyla like ectoprocts,
brachiopods or molluscs undoes the hope that this character set may help to disentangle the relationships
between lophotrochozoan phyla. With current methods
and evolutionary models mitochondrial genome data
can contribute little to resolving the relationships of the
lophotrochozoan phyla.
However, our study revealed several rare genomic
changes like the loss of the DHU arm and changes of
the anticodon sequence of tRNAs and the evolution of
long intergenic sequences, that may be helpful for
reconstructing ectoproct phylogeny more robustly in
future studies.

Methods
DNA extraction

A sample of Flustra foliacea (Ectoprocta, Gymnolaemata) was obtained from the Biologische Anstalt Helgoland (Germany) and conserved at -70°C. Total genomic
DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA Mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
instructions for tissue.
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

Mitochondrial sequence fragments of the genes nad1,
nad2, nad3, nad4, nad5, nad6, cob, cox1, cox2, cox3,
atp6, and rrnS from an EST library of Flustra foliacea
(Hausdorf et al., 2007) were used to design specific primers (Additional file 23). The complete mitochondrial
genome of Flustra foliacea was amplified with these primers. All PCRs were done in an Eppendorf Mastercycler
Gradient thermocycler. PCRs were carried out in 50 μl
volumes (33.75 μl water, 10 μl 5× amplification buffer
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany), 2 μl MgCl2 solution
(25 mM), 0.25 μl Taq polymerase (5 U/μl), 1 μl dNTP
mixture (25 mM each), 1 μl template DNA, 2 μl primer

mixture (10 μM each)) using GoTaq polymerase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). To minimize replication
errors, proof-reading Pwo polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added to the reaction mix.
Cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for 120 s for
initial denaturation, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 45-55°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 180 s, followed by 72°C for 420 s for
final elongation. If amplifications were not successful,
DNA fragments were amplified with the PCR Extender
System (5Prime, Darmstadt, Germany) in 50 μl volumes
(38.1 μl water, 5 μl 10× tuning buffer, 0.4 μl PCR Extender Polymerase Mix, 2.5 μl dNTP mixture, 2 μl template
DNA, 2 μl primer mixture (10 μM each)) under the following long PCR conditions: 93°C for 180 s for initial
denaturation, 10 cycles of 93°C for 15 s, 55-62°C for 30
s, 68°C for 900 s, 20 cycles of 93°C for 15 s; 55-62°C for
30 s, 68°C for 900 s plus 20 s for each cycle. PCR fragments were excised from agarose gel and purified with
the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren,
Germany). Dependent on the band intensity on the
agarose gel, DNA was eluted in 20-50 μl elution buffer
or ddH2O and stored at -20°C. Each purified fragment
was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and transformed into
Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Clones containing inserts of the correct size were
sequenced on an automatic capillary sequencer. Large
inserts were sequenced by primer walking (sequences
available on request).
Sequence assembly and annotation

Sequence assembly was done with SeqMan (DNASTAR,
Madison, WI). The average coverage of the genome by
sequenced clones or EST contigs was 2.4×. Proteinencoding and ribosomal RNA genes were identified by
BLAST (blastn, tblastx) searches of NCBI databases and
by using the MITOS WebServer BETA (http://bloodymary.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/mitos/index.py). Start and end
positions of rRNA genes and MNCR were determined
by boundaries of adjacent genes. The tRNA genes were
detected via class-specific co-variance models using the
MITOS WebServer BETA. Complementarily, tRNAscanSE [63] and ARWEN [64] were used. The sequence data
was deposited in GenBank with the accession number
JQ061319. We used CRex [50] to analyse gene order
data. GC- and AT-skew was calculated by using the formula of Perna and Kocher [65].
Alignment

For phylogenetic analyses, we focused the taxon sampling (Additional file 24) on lophotrochozoan taxa. We
assembled complete or nearly complete mitochondrial
genomes available from members of the phyla Ectoprocta (4 species), Brachiopoda (4), Phoronida (1),

Nesnidal et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:572
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/572

Entoprocta (2), Nemertea (2), Chaetognatha (2) and
selected 8 representative mitochondrial genomes from
molluscs, 5 from annelids and 3 from platyhelminths.
We added 12 ecdysozoan and 5 deuterostome species as
well as 2 cnidarian taxa as outgroups.
The amino acid sequences of the mitochondrial protein-encoding genes of the selected taxa were individually aligned by the L-INS-i algorithm implemented in
MAFFT [66,67]. Because it is preferable to take the
amino acid level into account during alignment of protein-coding DNA, the aligned amino acid sequences
were used as a scaffold for constructing the corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment using RevTrans 1.4
[68]. For comparison, the nucleotide sequences were
aligned directly. We identified randomly similar sections
in each gene alignment with ALISCORE [53,54] on the
nucleotide and amino acid level using default settings
and maximal number of pairwise comparisons. In total,
15% of originally 14,968 nucleotide positions and 39% of
originally 4,452 amino acid positions were excluded
using ALICUT (http://www.utilities.zfmk.de) to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio. The final alignments, spanning
12,648 nucleotide respectively 2,729 amino acid positions, were attained by concatenating all processed
alignments. Alternatively to the ALISCORE evaluation
of the sequences, we used Gblocks [56] with low stringency parameters (minimum block length 5; allowed
gap positions with half) for eliminating poorly aligned
positions and divergent regions resulting in concatenated alignments spanning 6,839 nucleotide respectively
1,862 amino acid positions. The final alignments have
been deposited at TreeBASE and can be accessed at
http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:
S10996. Alignments with reduced taxa sets were
obtained by removing taxa from the complete alignments. Unless otherwise noted, the alignments edited
with ALISCORE were used.
Phylogenetic analyses and evaluation of model violation
caused by compositional heterogeneity

We checked the homogeneity of nucleotide frequencies
across taxa using the chi-square test implemented in
PAUP* 4.0 beta 10 [69]. However, this test ignores correlation resulting from phylogenetic structure. Therefore, we also measured the probability that the base
composition of two sequences is homogeneous for each
pair of sequences using the matched-pairs test of symmetry as implemented in SeqVis version 1.4 [70].
We performed maximum likelihood analyses using a
parallel Pthreads-based version [71] of RAxML, version
7.2.8 [72]. We used the GTR model for nucleotide
sequences, the MtZoa+F model [73] for amino acid
sequences, and the MULTIGAMMA model for recoded
amino acid data (see below). Using a modified perl

Page 15 of 19

script for model selection based on likelihood calculations with RAxML (available from http://icwww.epfl.ch/
~stamatak/index-Dateien/software/ProteinModelSelection.pl), the MtZoa+F model [73] was selected for amino
acid sequences. Rate heterogeneity among sites was
modelled using the gamma model. Confidence values
for edges of the maximum likelihood tree were computed by rapid bootstrapping [74] (100 replications).
We performed Bayesian inference analyses of the
amino acid sequences with the CAT model that adjusts
for site-specific amino acid frequencies [75] as implemented in PhyloBayes version 3.2f (http://megasun.bch.
umontreal.ca/People/lartillot/www/download.html).
Eight independent chains were run for each analysis.
The number of points of each chain, the number of
points that were discarded as burn-in, and the largest
discrepancy observed across all bipartitions (maxdiff) are
listed in Additional file 25. Taking every tenth sampled
tree, a 50%-majority rule consensus tree was computed
using all chains.
We evaluated in how far the assumptions of the CAT
model are violated by using posterior predictive tests. In
posterior predictive tests the observed value of a given
test statistic on the original data is compared with the
distribution of the test statistic on data replicates simulated under the reference model using parameter values
drawn from the posterior distribution (every tenth
sampled tree). The reference model is rejected for that
statistic if the observed value of the test statistic deviates
significantly. We used two test statistics measuring compositional heterogeneity implemented in PhyloBayes.
One measures the compositional deviation of each
taxon by summing the absolute differences between the
taxon-specific and global empirical frequencies over the
20 amino acids. This test statistic indicates which taxa
deviate significantly, but raises a multiple-testing issue.
Alternatively, the maximum deviation across taxa was
used as a global statistic.
Approaches for reducing the potential impact of
compositional bias

Because the third codon positions show the strongest
compositional heterogeneity (see results) and because
these positions become saturated first because of their
higher substitution rates, we tried to reduce the potential impact of systematic errors on phylogenetic inference by excluding the third codon positions from the
nucleotide data set.
We applied two approaches to reduce compositional
heterogeneity in the amino acid data set. First, we
excluded the taxa with the most strongly deviating amino
acid composition as indicated by the posterior predictive
test and repeated the Bayesian inference analysis as
described. Secondly, we recoded the amino acid data into

Nesnidal et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:572
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/572

groups. Susko and Roger [57] developed an algorithm for
constructing bins of amino acids in order to minimize
compositional heterogeneity for a given alignment by
minimizing the maximum chi-squared statistic for a taxon
of the data set. We used the program minmax-chisq
(http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/tsusko/software.cgi) to obtain
these minmax chi-squared bins for the mitochondrial
amino acid data set. In order to lose as little information
as possible, we chose the largest number of bins for which
the minimum P value is larger than 0.05, which indicates
that compositional homogeneity cannot be rejected for
this set of bins according to the chi-square test. Alternatively, we recoded the amino acid data into the six groups
of amino acids (AGPST, C, DENQ, FWY, HKR, ILMV)
that tend to replace one another [60].
As alternative to the approaches for reducing compositional heterogeneity in the data set, we used nonstationary models of evolution in phylogenetic inference
analyses. We analysed the nucleotide data set using the
nonstationary model of evolution developed by Galtier
and Gouy [76] as implemented in nhPhyML-Discrete
[77], limited to 3 base content frequency categories and
with 8 categories for a discrete gamma model of
among-site rate variation. Based on the amino acid data
set, we performed a Bayesian analysis with the CAT-BP
model [61] as implemented in nhPhyloBayes (http://
www.lirmm.fr/mab/blanquart/), which accounts for
compositional heterogeneity between lineages by introducing breakpoints along the branches of the phylogeny
at which the amino acid composition is allowed to
change. Sixteen independent chains were run for 10,000
points. Stationarity of the posterior probabilities of all
chains were reached during the first 2,000 points. Thus,
2,000 points were discarded as burn-in for all chains.
Taking every tenth sampled tree, a 50%-majority rule
consensus tree was computed.
Approaches for reducing the potential impact of
saturation and long-branch attraction

To mitigate the potential impact of saturation and
long-branch attraction, we excluded the fastest evolving sites as determined by Treefinder, version of
October 2008 [78,79]. An appropriate model for
nucleotide respectively protein evolution was determined with the ‘propose model’ option of Treefinder
based on the Akaike Information Criterion with a correction term for small sample size. According to this
criterion the GTR model with gamma-distributed rates
was chosen for the nucleotide data set and a mixed
model that is a linear combination of 14 empirical
models of protein evolution and considering amongsite rate variation with a five-category discrete gammadistribution for rates was chosen for the amino acid

Page 16 of 19

data set. With the data sets and these models maximum likelihood trees were calculated with Treefinder.
Finally, sitewise rates were calculated with the data
sets, the models and the trees as input.
