Abstract
The question of arthropod head segmentation has become one of the central issues in Evolutionary
Developmental Biology. The number of theories pertaining to head segments progressively
enlarges, old concepts have been revitalized, and nearly every conceivable composition of the
arthropod head has at some point received discussion. One contentious issue involves a
characteristic mouthpart in crustaceans – the lower lips or the so-called paragnaths. The
paragnaths build the posterior border of the mouth region antagonistic to the upper lip – the
labrum. We show here the development of the appendage-like structures in the mandibular region
of the amphipod crustacean Orchestia cavimana at a high level of cellular resolution. The embryos
are examined during development of the mouthparts using in vivo labeling. An invariant cell division
pattern of the mandibular segment was detected by 4D-microscopy and a preliminary model for
pattern of the first cleavages in the mandibular region created. With this indispensable precondition
single ectodermal cells of the grid-like pattern were labeled with DiI – a lipophilic fluorescent dye
– to trace cell lineages and determine the clonal composition of the developing mouthparts,
especially the mandibular segment. From our data it is evident that the paragnaths are sternal
outgrowths of the mandible segment. The assumption of the limb nature of paragnaths and the
presence of an additional head segment between the mandibular and the second antennal segments
are clearly refuted by our data. Our results show the power of cell lineage and clonal analyses for
inferences on the nature, origin and thus homology of morphological structures. With this kind of
investigation morphological and gene expression data can be complemented.
We discuss notable similarities of paragnath anlagen to those of the hypopharynx complex in
myriapods and hexapods. The fact that both structures grow out as two lateral buds in the same
region of the mandibular sternite during development, and their important role in the formation of
the feeding apparatus as a highly specialized chewing chamber in adults of crustaceans, myriapods,
and hexapods argue for the paragnaths/hypopharynx anlagen being an additional potential
apomorphy of Mandibulata.

Background
The number and nature of the metameric elements constituting the head is one of the highly controversial issues in
developmental biology, morphology, and phylogenetics
of arthropods [1,2]. The most controversial head structure
is the arthropod labrum, or upper lip. Based on a great
variety of approaches and evidence the labrum is interpreted as being a derived pair of limbs with unclear segmental affiliations, a simple outgrowth, an anterior
segment or the anterior most non-segmental body terminus, the acron [1,3]. Another structure of unresolved
nature is the paired lower lip which is called paragnaths in
crustaceans or superlinguae/hypopharynx in hexapods
and some myriapods [4,5]. Paragnaths have been
described for malacostracans, branchiopods, copepods,
ostracods, mystacocarids, and cephalocarids (e.g. Ref.
[4,6-10]). They are located in the posterior area of the
mandibles and form often the lower border of the pre-oral
cavity [4,11,12] (Fig. 1). Paragnaths play a role in feeding
and in some taxa they are movable and have a complex
and appendage-like appearance [13]. Moreover, in many
crustaceans they are embryologically formed as limb-bud
like outgrowths (e.g. Ref. [14-18]).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/19

The superlinguae of many hexapods and Pauropoda,
Symphyla and Diplopoda among the myriapods form,
together with the unpaired lingua, the hypopharynx, a
tongue-like structure at the posterior of the pre-oral cavity
[5,19-22]. As is the case for the crustacean paragnaths, the
hypopharynx/superlinguae are involved in food processing and embryologically they are formed as two processes
at the posterior stomodeal region [23-25].
Although these paragnathal/superlingual/hypopharyngeal structures are not so much a focus of the general head
debate as is the labrum, they present a similar set of problems. First, it is not clear whether paragnaths and superlinguae are homologous (see Ref. [5,26,27]). Second, based
on early development, the sometimes complex adult
structure, and the innervation pattern some authors interpret the paragnaths as being derived from limbs (e.g. Ref.
[26,28,29]) or as parts of limbs [12,30,31] whereas others
dispute this [10,32]. Third, the segmental relation is seen
controversially either as postoral lip not related to any
particular segment [7], as part of the mandibular segment
[10,33], the segment of the first maxillae [8,12], or even
the second maxillae [9]. Hansen [28], Denis [34], Chau-

donneret[26], Laverack [35], and Casanova [29] suggest
that the paragnaths indicate an additional segment either
between mandibular and maxillary segments [28] or the
tritocerebral and mandibular segments [26,29,34,35],
concluding that the arthropod or mandibulate head comprises one more segment than generally thought. Lauterbach [32] hypothesized the origin of the paragnaths in
sternal folds ("sternale Falten") of ancestral arthropods.
According to Lauterbach the paragnaths are the result of
progressive bulging and fusion of sternal elements of the
first post-oral head segments in the Mandibulata, though
only in some crustacean taxa do these folded sternal formations ("Faltenbildungen") have an appendage-like
appearance.
Here we address the problem of the nature and origin of
crustacean paragnaths with a cell lineage approach. To
resolve the segmental affinities of the paragnaths we study
the cell lineage in the area around the mandibular segment of the freshwater beach-hopper, the amphipod crustacean Orchestia cavimana. This animal is well suited for
this kind of investigation because it forms a pair of large
buds of paragnaths during embryonic development [17].
Furthermore, as an amphipod representative its stereotypic cell division pattern in the post-naupliar region (segments of the first maxillae to the terminal segment of the
pleon) is known (for this see Fig. 2D) and has been
described up to the formation of morphological structures
such as limbs, segments, and ganglia (Fig. 2E) [36]. In
contrast to the well studied post-naupliar region, the processes of cell division and morphogenesis of the segments
of the first and second antennae and the mandible (i.e.
the naupliar region) are less known. This is due to the
more irregular mode of cell division which, apart from
some indications in the posterior mandibular region,
does not show an obvious stereotypic pattern [36,37].
We combine the methods of 4D-microscopy [38] and the
in-vivo labeling of single cells with the fluorescent dye DiI
[39] to resolve the cell division pattern in the posterior
naupliar region to trace the origin and formation of the
paragnaths and other mouthparts by analyzing the clonal
composition of the mandibular segment and adjacent
areas.
It can be shown that the posterior region of the mandibular segment shows an unexpected degree of cell division
determination with a reproducible cell lineage. The clearcut results of our study shed new light on the segmentation pattern of crustacean heads by dismissing some older
hypotheses on the origin and nature of paragnaths. The
comparison and discussion of putative homologous structures in other arthropod taxa offer new perspectives on
arthropod heads in general.

Methods
Culture
Specimens of the semi-terrestrial amphipod species
Orchestia cavimana were collected from beaches of the
Tegeler See (Berlin). The animals were maintained in a terrarium at 18–20°C and fed with carrots and oatmeal. To
receive eggs in relevant stages gravid females were caught
and isolated. The egg-bearing females where carefully
anaesthetized in mineral water containing CO2. In their
ventral brood pouch – the marsupium – the purple
colored eggs are easy to recognize. The eggs were flushed
out with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a saline solution that mimics the osmotic milieu in the marsupium
(details described in Wolff and Scholtz [39]).
4-D-micoscropy
Embryos in relevant stages (shortly before the first ectodermal rows appear) were mounted on microscopic
slides. A ring of Vaseline was formed on the slide and this
small "basin" was filled with amphipod saline and covered with small cover slips. By a careful movement of the
cover slips the embryos can be arranged in a suitable position and arrested with a little pressure on the slip's top.

The fundamentals of 4D-microscopy are described by
Schnabel et al. [38]. The image stacks were analyzed with
the software SIMI°BioCell (SIMI, Germany). The data are
illustrated as 3D-representations with color coded
spheres. About 15 embryos were observed during the first
row formation up to the row-like formation of the region
E(0).
In-vivo labeling
The cell labeling was done with an inverse microscope
equipped with a micromanipulator (Leica DMIRB). The
eggs in the relevant stages were put on microscopic slides
under small cover slips that were equipped with plasticine
feet at the corners. The eggs could be brought into the
desired position by carefully shifting the cover slip. The
eggs were held for the injection with soft pressure on the
cover slip.

To get suitable needles for the injection, pipettes
(Hilsberg, diameter 1.0 mm, thickness 0.2 mm) were
pulled (KOPF Puller 720). After pulling the tips of the
needles are closed and had to be open and sharpened with
a horizontal grinder (Bachofer). The angle of the cutting
edge varied between 20 and 30 degrees. The fluorescent
marker was sucked into the injection-needle. DiI (Molecular Probes) was used as a vital marker. DiI is a lipophilic
fluorescence-dye that binds to the cell membrane. This
guarantees that the dye is exclusively restricted to the
daughter cells. After a defined period of development the
labeled eggs were observed with a fluorescence-microscope (Zeiss Axiophot1) using blue light or green light

region (anterior end indicated by genealogical unit E(1)). (D) Schematic cell division pattern of post-naupliar ectoderm rows

direction. Middle: The result is a grid like pattern of four rows (from anterior to posterior: a, b, c and d). Bottom: After the
first differential cleavages (bars mark sister cells) the first morphogenesis takes place. Interestingly the later morphological segments do not conform to this genealogical unit. The segmental border (if) runs between the descendants of row b and does
not match the genealogical border (gb). Accordingly, limb buds, ganglia, and other segmental organs are composed structures
formed by the descendants of two adjacent ectoderm rows. The dotted lines indicate the area of the later limb buds. The anteriormost post-naupliar ectoderm row E(1) shows a somewhat different pattern (see Fig. 4 and Ref. [36]). (E) SEM-picture of an
early limb bud (surrounded by dotted line) of the left second thoracopod (first pereiopod). According to the color code in 1D
the red arrowheads mark the intersegmental furrows and the green arrowhead marks the border of two consecutive genealogical segments which together form a morphological segment. Medial to the limb bud (lb) the anlage of the ganglion (g) of this
hemi-segment and the slightly sunken midline (ml) is visible.

(strongest stimulation of DiI), and the results were documented with a digital camera (Nikon D1).
CLSM and 3D-reconstruction
For fixation and documentation on the laser scanning
microscope (Leica SP2) the embryos were dissected in
PBS-buffered 4% formaldehyde-solution, counterstained
with nuclear staining dye (Hoechst) and mounted in
DABCO-Glycerol (25 mg DABCO (1,4 diazabicyclol2,2,2-octane, Merck) in 1 ml PBS to 9 ml glycerol), which
is an anti-bleaching-detergent. The image stacks produced
by the laser scanning microscope were analyzed with the
software Imaris 5.0.1 (Bitplane AG). The 3D-reconstruction of the counter staining (Hoechst) and the clones of
the in-vivo labeled cell have the advantage of very high
resolution with respect to morphological data. The feature
"Volume" in the program module "Surpass" created a
three dimensional object, which can be magnified and
moved in all directions. For better visualization of the
objects, movies (AVI-files) were created in the program
module "Animation".
Nomenclature
For the following description we adopt the common
nomenclature for malacostracan crustacean cell lineages
which was modified for amphipods by Scholtz [36]. In
addition we introduce a nomenclature for the ectoderm
row E(0). The anterior row of E(0) is named E(0)a and the
posterior row E(0)p. If after the subsequent divisions a
cell lies anterior it is again labeled with an "a". The posterior sister cell is labeled correspondingly with "p". As in
more posterior rows the cells in positions to the midline
(these cells and their early descendants are designated as
columns) are numbered consecutively from the middle
towards lateral (e.g. E(0)p1).

Results
The early cell lineage of the mandibular region (E(0))
After gastrulation, the blastopore is closed. The germ disc
consists of about 250 cells (Fig. 2A). The descendants of
the macromeres B (left) and D (right) form the anterior
parts of the germ disc by migration towards the middle
(for details see Wolff and Scholtz [39]). At this time there
is no regular cellular pattern in the ventral ectoderm. The
first recognizable transverse ectoderm row occurs in a
germ disc with about 400 cells (Fig. 2B). This row marks
the border between the naupliar (head lobes, the segments of the first and second antennae and of the mandibles) and the post-naupliar (the segment of the first
maxillae up to the telson anlage) regions of the developing embryo. This first recognizable cell row forms the
genealogical unit E(1) which provides most of the material for the segment of the first maxilla (Fig. 2C). The cells
anterior to E(1) show a typical spatial configuration.
According to Scholtz [36] we named this region E(0),

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/19

which forms part of the prospective mandibular segment
(Fig. 2C). The cells of E(0) are somewhat smaller and
rounder than the more posterior cells. They are arranged
in two rows of at least 6 cells on either body half (Fig. 2C,
3A–B). The anterior row is designated as E(0)a and the
posterior row as E(0)p (Fig. 3A,B). It is not clear whether
these two rows originate from one transverse ectoderm
row by longitudinally oriented cell divisions. A distinct
unpaired column of midline cells as is typical for the postnaupliar region (Fig. 2E) does not exist in the naupliar
part of the germ band. In the median area of the posterior
naupliar region E(0) we found about 10–15 smaller cells
in a V-shaped arrangement (Fig. 3A,B).
At about this stage, cells of the anterior row E(0)a divide
more or less synchronously (mitotic wave) in a longitudinal direction. The products are the anterior row E(0)aa
and the posterior row E(0)ap (Fig. 3A,B). The following
division pattern of cells in row E(0)aa is not clear in detail
but the cells divide symmetrically in each body half (see
supplemental material). In row E(0)ap a detailed pattern
could not completely be described but some features of
the more medially lying cells of this row could be traced.
The cells E(0)ap1 und E(0)ap2 are the first to divide in a
longitudinal direction whereas E(0)ap3 divides a bit later
in a horizontal direction (Fig. 4E). The cell E(0)ap4 shows
a delayed division. In relation to the division cycles in row
E(0)a, the cells of E(0)p are delayed in their division.
During the second mitotic wave in row E(0)aa, E(0)p2 is
the first cell that divides in row E(0)p. It divides in a longitudinal direction. More or less at the same time the midline cell E(0)p0 divides also in a longitudinal direction.
Subsequently the cells E(0)p3, E(0)p5, and E(0)p6 divide
likewise in a longitudinal direction E(0)p2 (Fig. 4B,C). At
the same time the relatively large cell E(0)p1 divides in a
horizontal direction (Fig. 4C). At last, the cell E(0)p4
undergoes a division, again in a horizontal direction (Fig.
4D). In this developmental stage small buds of the naupliar appendages (first and second antennae, mandible)
become visible (Fig. 4F). This invariant cleavage pattern in
the prospective mandibular region eventually produces a
reproducible arrangement of cells in the posterior region
of E(0)(Fig. 4E).
This is an important pre-condition for our detailed lineage
study of the mandibular segment. Unfortunately, we
could not reconstruct the complete lineage pattern of the
more anterior lying region E(0)a.

appendages
Identified cells of the transverse ectoderm rows around
the boundary between the naupliar and post-naupliar
regions were labeled in-vivo during the early germ band

(B) Created SIMI°BioCell-model of cell arrangement of the ventral ectoderm of the embryo shown in figure A. The cells which
are interesting to trace are color coded. Each genealogical region (row) has a distinct color (red: row E(1), blue: row E(0)p,

Because of the beginning morphogenesis of the limb buds it is impossible to reconstruct the cellular arrangement only by one

stage. The identification of cells is the prerequisite for the
analysis of further cell fates and the clonal composition of
morphological structures. Since a single cell approach was
not feasible throughout, we divided the region E(0) from
median to lateral into three sections. The median area,
area I, begins lateral to the midline and ends before
E(0)p2. The area II starts from E(0)p2 and comprises cell
E(0)p3. The most lateral area III reaches from E(0)p4 to

the end of the visible row formation (Fig. 4E). The successful in-vivo markings could be assigned to the corresponding areas.
The midline-region of E(0)
The median region of the mandibular segment does not
consist of an unpaired column as is known for the postnaupliar ectoderm (the so-called midline, see [40,41]).

From the onset, about 10 smaller cells are more sunken
into the yolk than are the surrounding symmetrically
arranged cells. Thereby, the median cells form a typical Vshaped region (Fig. 3A). During ongoing development a
clear separation (in comparison with surrounding lateral
cells) is recognizable (Figs. 3C, 4F). The surface of this
median region loses its cellular character and has a
smooth appearance.
The fate of area I
In relation to the more lateral adjoining cells (area II and
III) the cells of area I of E(0) are retarded in cell division
during segment formation. They form only a small portion (10–15 cells) of the early mandibular segment, and
have their origin in the first column of region E(0) –
E(0)a1 and E(0)p1.

In vivo labeling of cell E(0)a1 shows that its descendants
form the medio-anterior part of the developing humps of
the paragnaths. In addition, a median part of the mandibular sternite is formed by E(0)a1-descendants.

in post-naupliar germ band. At this time the prospective
mandibular segment consists of two cell rows (E(0)a and

the different areas in the mandibular segment. The horizontal
line between E(0)p and E(1) marks the genealogical border
between these rows, the segmental boundary between the
mandibular segment and the segment of the first maxilla, and
the border between the naupliar and the post-naupliar
regions of the germ band. (F) Photo composition of mandibular cell lineage pattern and SEM picture found in Orchestia.
The embryo of the SEM picture is about one cell division
cycle in advance. However, at this developmental stage the
naupliar segments (antenna 1, antenna 2 and mandible) have
small appendage buds, whereas the adjacent posterior region
shows only its segmental appearance. The substantial participation of row E(0)aa, E(0)ap and E(0)p in the outgrowth of
the mandibular bud is visible.

The descendants of E(0)p1 form postero-median parts of
the paragnaths and adjacent areas of the sternite (Fig. 5A–
C, Additional file 1). A few clones of E(0)p1 are found
within the neuro-ectoderm in the posterior region of the
mandibular segment and form nervous structures. Finally,
after further development the ectodermal descendants are
involved in the formation of postero-median parts of the
paragnaths.
In general, area I forms the median mandibular sternite
and median parts of the paragnaths. The clonal composition of a developed paragnath and developed parts of the
sternite reflects the early a/p-arrangement of the rows.
The fate of area II
The lateral adjoining area of area I is area II, which comprises the descendants of column 2 and 3. It forms lateral
parts of the paragnaths and median parts of the mandible.
Descendants of column 2 are found in more lateral parts
of the paragnath and in antero-median parts of the mandible (Fig. 6A–C, Additional file 2). Interestingly, these
median parts of the early mandibular bud are later differentiated into the molar process.

The cells of column 3 give rise to median parts of the mandible (Fig. 6D–E, Additional file 2). As in area I, the
descendants of the anterior row E(0)a form more anterior
parts and according to that the descendants of row E(0)p
proliferate more posterior parts. As well, some cells of the
sternite have their origin in cells of area II.

(Pm) and the outer pars incisivus (Pi). Few E(0)p1-clones form postero-median parts of the paragnath hump (Pg). The sternal
clones seen in B are out of focus.
In general, area II is responsible for the formation of lateral parts of the paragnaths and more median parts of the
mandibles.
The fate of area III
Area III lies laterally adjacent to area II and comprises columns 4 and 5 of region E(0). They form lateral parts of the
mandible and neighboring parts of the tergite. That is why
the cell E(0)p4 produces cell material for the outer (postero-lateral) part of the mandible and lateral bordering
tergite (Fig. 7A–C, Additional file 3). In contrast, descendants of row E(0)a in area III form more anterior parts of
the outer (antero-lateral) mandible and parts of the adjacent tergite. Remarkably, the lateral portion of the mandibles differentiates by cell proliferation into the
prospective pars incisiva.

Summarizing for area III, column 4 forms lateral parts of
the mandibles and adjacent tergites and column 5 is not
involved in the development of mandibles or paragnaths.
Surrounding areas of E(0)
anterior
The fate of the cells anterior to the region of E(0) has not
yet been resolved in detail. Furthermore, it is not clear if
there is a stereotypic cell division pattern at all forming
the anterior embryonic head. Some labeling reveals that
median cells of E(0) form part of the stomodaeum and
more lateral cells form part of the second antennae.
posterior
Beginning with row E(1) the typical grid-like pattern of
the post-naupliar germ band of Orchestia is established.

The cell division pattern of E(1) differs somewhat from
that of the more posterior rows (compare Figs. 2D and 4E)
(for details see [36]). The 4-D analysis in row E(1) shows
that its descendant cells are not involved in the formation
of the mandibular segment (Fig. 4E) Hence, in contrast to
the post-naupliar segments, in the mandibular segment
the posterior genealogical boundary corresponds with the
segment border.

Discussion and conclusion
A stereotyped cell division pattern is found at the posterior
border of the mandibular segment
Like all malacostracan crustaceans studied in this respect
(for a recent review see Dohle et al. [42]), amphipods
show a stereotyped cell divisions pattern in the post-naupliar region during growth, differentiation and segmentation of the germ band [36,43,44]. In contrast to this, the
naupliar region does not exhibit an obvious stereotyped
cell division pattern [37,42]. Only Scholtz [36] suggested
that there might be a certain regularity in the divisions and
arrangements of the posterior cells of the developing
mandibular segment in the amphipod Gammarus pulex
but with the methods then at hand the details were not
resolvable With the technique of 4D-microscopy we have
been able to provide the first evidence for an invariant cell
division pattern in the naupliar region of another amphipod species, the freshwater beach hopper Orchestia cavimana. At least in the posterior part of the region of E(0) we
recognized a relatively strict cell division pattern. This pattern has only superficial similarities to the post-naupliar
cell division pattern of malacostracan crustaceans but it is
not as elaborated in terms of timing of mitoses, cell size,
and the spatial arrangement of the resulting cells. In E(0)

In-vivo labeling of area II in region E(0). The images are in ventral view and double exposure. (A-C) Labeling of cell E(0)a2 of
the left body half. (A)Anterior embryonic region which at this time lacks visible paragnath buds. The descendants of E(0)a2
form anterior parts of the mandible bud (Md) as well as parts of the developing sternite. (B) Left gnathal region of the embryo
as in A further developed. The small palp (P) of the maxilla 1 (Mx1) is now formed. There are two distinct clone domains. One
forms anterior part of the small paragnath bud (Pg), the other forms anterior parts of the developing mandible (Md). (C) Left
mandibular region of the embryo as in B after further development. The paragnaths grow out and the mandible differentiates
into two lobes. The clonal composition of the descendants of E(0)a2 is more or less the same as in (E). (D-E) Labeling of cell
E(0)p3 of the left body half. (D) Ventral view of the mouth region. The descendants of the marked cell form posterior parts of
the mandibular bud (Md), but they do not form parts of the anlage of the paragnath (Pg). The arrow head shows the oil drop of
the marking. (E) Same embryo as in D slightly further developed. Imaris-reconstruction of the left gnathal region. The blue
spots represent the counter-stained (Hoechst) nuclei. The descendants of E(0)p3 are involved in the formation of posterior
parts of the mandible, which now consists of two well developed lobes. For detail see Additional file 2.

the sequence of the individual divisions is not as strict and
the direction of the mitotic spindles is more or less longitudinally oriented. It appears that the posterior border of
the mandibular segment forms some kind of transition
between the more irregular divisions and cell arrangements of the anterior naupliar region and the highly complex stereotyped post-naupliar patterns.
It is not clear whether our findings of a regular pattern in
the posterior part of the mandibular segment holds true
for other malacostracans as well, although some data
from the isopod Porcellio scaber hint to that possibility
[45]. However, the cellular events in the corresponding

region in Porcellio are much more irregular when compared with those in Orchestia. It has been even shown for
Porcellio that some cells of the most anterior row of the
post-naupliar segments can migrate into the posterior area
of the mandible segment [45], a phenomenon that does
not occur in Orchestia.
Interestingly enough, our results reveal that the posterior
segmental boundary of the mandibular segment corresponds to the genealogical border between rows E(0) and
E(1), i.e. E(1) does not contribute to the posterior part of
the mandibular segment. This stands in contrast to all
more posterior post-naupliar segmental boundaries

which are formed within the descendants of one ectoderm
row and thus do not match the genealogical borders (see
Fig. 2), [42]. Row E(1) forms a kind of transition between
these segmentation modes because its posterior region
follows the typical post-naupliar pattern in that it contributes to the anterior portion of the segment of the first
maxillae whose posterior part is formed by anterior
descendants of the next adjacent row E(2) [36,37]. These
differences indicate that the parasegmental organization
(i.e. a frame-shift between the early metameric anlagen
and the resulting morphological segments) of the postnaupliar germ band (see [42]) is not found in the naupliar
region with a transition in the first maxillary segment.
Cell lineage data and clonal analyses reveal that
paragnaths are not limbs but outgrowths of the sternal
region of the mandibular segment
Based on our knowledge of the cell division pattern of the
early developing mandibular region (see above) we were
able to look at its morphogenesis at a very high level of
resolution. By means of single cell labeling with the fluorescent dye DiI we were able to reconstruct and analyze
the clonal composition of the mandibular region from the
beginning of ectodermal proliferation up to the differentiation of the mouthparts. The cell labeling reveals that the
paragnaths have their origin in the area I and area II which
comprises columns 1 to 3 of region E(0). The mandibles
originate from cells of the areas II and III (columns 2 to 4).
Areas I and II contribute also to the sternal region and the
mandibular ganglia whereas area III forms parts of the

tergites as well. In more posterior segments, columns 1
and 2 mainly contribute to the formation of segmental
ganglia and probably sternites, and columns 3 to 5 mainly
give rise to limbs [36,46]. Hence, when compared with
clonal composition of the post-naupliar segments it is evident that the columns that form the ganglia and sternites
in these segments correspond to those that give rise to the
paragnaths in the mandibular segment. In addition, the
mandibular buds are formed in a comparable position to
the other limbs. This clearly reveals that paragnaths of
Orchestia are processes of the mandibular sternal region.
Further evidence for the claim that crustacean paragnaths
belong to the mandibular segment is based on gene
expression data. For instance, the segment polarity gene
engrailed is expressed in a regular stripe in the posterior
region of the mandibular segment, as in all other segments, comprising cells that form the posterior part of the
paragnaths in amphipods, isopods and decapods
[14,18,37]. Moreover, the expression of the Hox-gene
Deformed (Dfd) is mainly found in the mandible segment
of hexapods [47,48], myriapods [49,50], and crustaceans
[14,16], and in the latter case expression of Dfd comprises
the buds of the paragnaths [14,16].
All these data reveal that paragnaths are part of the mandibular segment and that they are not limb derivatives as
has been suggested by several authors. This confirms previous ideas on the origin and nature of paragnaths based
on embryological and larval evidence [17]. With our

Frontiers in Zoology 2006, 3:19

clonal analysis we can definitely rule out the possibility
that paragnaths indicate the existence of an additional
head segment as has been claimed for example by Casanova [29], Chaudonneret [26], Denis [34], and Hansen
[28]. Furthermore, the limb-bud like early appearance of
the paragnaths in Orchestia and other crustaceans is no
indication for a limb-related nature of these structures but
is only a superficial similarity that does not represent a
genealogical relation. Our results show the power of cell
lineage and clonal analyses for inferences on the nature,
origin and thus homology of morphological structures.
With this kind of investigation morphological and gene
expression data can be complemented.
In many cases the origin of the paragnaths during crustacean embryonic and larval development has either not
been specified (e.g. Ref. [51-53]) or it has been suggested
that paragnaths develop from mandibular and/or maxillary segments (e.g. Ref. [54]). A look at the corresponding
figures in these articles with our results in mind reveals
that it is possible in almost all examples to relate the paragnathal structures to the mandibular segment (e.g. Manton [51], plate 24, fig. 27; Manton [52], plate 25, fig. 23;
Moeller [53], figs. 2, 7). Even the median lobe of the socalled lower lip of the raptorial cladoceran Leptodora
kindtii might represent fused paragnaths [55]. Accordingly, we tentatively conclude that the paragnaths lobes
are homologous throughout Crustacea. Stein et al. [56]
suggest that a pair of paragnaths humps is an apomorphy
for a crustacean subgroup comprising Eucrustacea and
Phosphatocopina (Labrophora). However, these authors
did not consider similar structures in myriapods and
hexapods which indicate a much more widespread occurrence among euarthropods. (see next chapter).
Are the crustacean paragnaths homologous to the
superlinguae in hexapods and myriapods?
There are several reports of post-oral paired bud-like anlagen in myriapods (e.g. Chilopoda: Heymons [57], Progoneata: Tiegs [19]) and Hexapoda (e.g. Ref. [24,25,58-60]).
In dicondylian hexapods the situation is somewhat
ambiguous. Larink [61] and Scholl [62] report for Lepisma
and Carausius an undivided early hypopharynx anlage
whereas Rohrschneider [24] for Periplaneta and Ibrahim
[63] for Tachycines describe two separated buds. Whether
these are factual differences is not clear. However, the
presence of paired buds in a number of pterygotes as well
as collembolans, diplurans, and archaeognathans allows
the conclusion that these paired buds were present in the
hexapod stem species. Nevertheless, all these buds have in
common that they originate from the sternum of the mandible segment directly ventral to the mandibular ganglion
anlagen and between the mandibular limb buds, after
these have formed. This very much resembles the early
stages
of
crustacean
paragnaths
(see
above,

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/19

[14,17,18,51,52]). These sternal buds of the mandibular
segment give either rise to the superlinguae, paired lateral
lobes of the hypopharynx, in Symphyla [19], Collembola
[58,59], Diplura, Archaeognatha [25], or to (another part
of) the hypopharynx [22,24,57] when superlinguae are
not present as for instance is the case in many Pterygota
and all Chilopoda [22,64]. However, the contribution of
these mandibular sternal buds to the hypopharynx body
(linguae) is interpreted controversially. The hypopharynx
of Hexapoda and Progoneata is thought to be a composite
structure formed by protrusions of the sternites of different numbers of gnathal segments (e.g. Ref.
[19,22,25,61,62]). In contrast to this, Haget [65] and
Wada [66] suggest, based on their experimental teratological studies that the entire hypopharynx originates from
the mandibular sternites. According to Heymons [57],
this is also the case in Chilopoda. The situation is further
complicated by the fact that buds appearing in the intercalary segment of hexapods are called "hypopharyngeal
lobes" (Hypopharynxhöcker) and have been suggested to
form (part of) the hypopharynx, an obvious misinterpretation (see Ref. [23,63,67]). Reading the numerous articles dealing with this problem it is evident that
investigations focusing on the differentiation of the
hypopharynx in myriapods and hexapods using modern
approaches are badly needed to solve this issue.
Authors such as Crampton [27], Snodgrass [68], and
Bitsch and Bitsch [5] suggest that the paragnaths and the
superlinguae are homologous. However, based on our
data and what we find in the above discussed literature
about the development of the hexapod and myriapod
hypopharyngeal complex, we think that the conclusion of
these authors is simplifying the matters because paragnaths cannot be homologous to superlinguae alone if the
major part of the hypopharynx of myriapods and hexapods originates from the mandibular sternites as well.
Accordingly, we modify the homology statement concerning crustacean paragnaths and the myriapod/hexapod
superlinguae/hypopharynx by suggesting that the early
anlagen of these structures are homologous, taking into
account that the homology of early developmental stages
does not necessarily mean that more advanced stages are
also homologous [69]. Since a comparable structure is
absent in the corresponding segment of Chelicerata and
Onychophora (first walking leg, see Ref. [1,2,70-72]) it is
likely that a pair of sternal buds in the mandibular segment is a shared apomorphy of Crustacea, Myriapoda,
and Hexapoda. Accordingly these structures provide further support for the Mandibulata hypothesis (see also Ref.
[2,73-75]) which has been disputed based on molecular
data (e.g. Ref. [76-78]).
