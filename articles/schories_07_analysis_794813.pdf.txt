Abstract
Background: Unisexuality, or all female reproduction, is rare among vertebrates. Studying these
exceptional organisms may give useful information with respect to the evolution and maintenance
of sexual reproduction. Poecilia formosa was the first unisexual vertebrate species to be detected
and since then has served as a paradigmatic organism for unisexuality and studies on the evolution
of sex. It reproduces through gynogenesis, using sperm of males from related species to trigger
parthenogenetic development of the unreduced diploid eggs. Like in other unisexual vertebrates,
triploids occur in a certain range of P. formosa. It has been suggested that the addition of the host
species derived third chromosome set is evolutionary important. Clonal organisms lack sufficient
genotypic diversity for adaptive changes to variable environments. Also non-recombining genomes
cannot purge deleterious mutations and therefore unisexual organisms should suffer from a
genomic decay. Thus, polyploidization leading to triploidy should bring "fresh" genetic material into
the asexual lineage. To evaluate the importance of triploidy for maintaining the asexual species, it
is important to know whether such an introgression event happens at a reasonable frequency.
Results: In an earlier study it was found that all triploid P. formosa in the Rio Purificación river
system are of monophyletic origin. Here we have analyzed fish from a different river system. Using
microsatellite analysis we can show that the triploids from this new location are genetically
divergent and most probably of an independent origin.
Conclusion: Our data support the hypothesis that triploidy was not a single chance event in the
evolutionary history of P. formosa and hence might be a relevant mechanism to increase genotypic
divergence and at least partially counteract the genetic degeneration connected to asexuality. It is,
however, much rarer than in other asexual vertebrates analyzed so far and thus probably only of
moderate evolutionary importance for the maintenance of the asexual breeding complex.

Background
Poecilia formosa is an all female teleost fish species. In fact
it was the first asexual vertebrate to be described [1] and
has been a paradigmatic organism for studies on the evolution of sexual reproduction and the maintenance of
asexuality [2-4]. Its mode of reproduction is gynogenesis,
a form of parthenogenesis, in which the embryonic development of unreduced diploid eggs is triggered by sperm
from males of closely related species.
Usually the DNA of the sperm does not reach the egg
nucleus resulting in clonal offspring. In exceptional cases
the exclusion mechanism fails and either small fragments
of single chromosomes, designated supernumerary chromosomes or microchromosomes [5], or the full chromosome set of the whole haploid genome of the sperm is
included [6-8].
Fish with additional microchromosomes readily can form
new clones that stably transmit the microchromosome.
This phenomenon has been found in laboratory broods as
well as in wild populations and occurs obviously at a reasonable frequency [9]. Interestingly, microchromosome
carrying fish have been reported only from the Río Purificación [10].
The situation for the triploids is different: all triploids that
occurred in the laboratory so far were sterile, while triploids collected in nature produce all triploid offspring
[8,11]. Those triploids have been found in the Río Purificación and its tributaries [12,13], as well as in the hydrologically connected Río Soto la Marina river system. Apart
from that only in the river system adjacent to the south,
the Río Guayalejo, some stable triploid populations exist
[6]. At the periphery of the range of P. formosa, triploids
appear to be extremely rare. Enigmatic reports exist from
the Río Grande (or Río Bravo) basin where during steady
large-scale sampling (N = 5000) only four triploids were
collected in ten years. Another single triploid was found in
the Río Tuxpan system. The rare triploids outside the
upper Río Purificación were interpreted to be "sterile first
generation triploids" like the laboratory born [13]. Triploids are frequent where P. formosa is found together with
P. limantouri, which serves as sperm donor, but absent or
rare where P. formosa is sympatric with the alternative
sperm donors P. mexicana or P. latipinna. The hypothesis
was put forward that triploids may arise de-novo throughout the whole range, but are only fertile and can survive
only in the region, where P. formosa occurs together with
P. limantouri [14], namely in the Ríos Purificación, Soto la
Marina and Guayalejo. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that reproductive triploidy is an extremely rare
event, which occurred so far only once in an area, where
P. formosa mates with P. limantouri. From there the triploid

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/13

fish spread and invaded the neighboring river systems but
have not reached the periphery of the range.
A microsatellite based study on fish from the Río Purificación suggested that all triploids that were analyzed
belonged to only two clonal lineages and had a monophyletic origin [12]. This stands in contrasts to the diploids, which display a high number of different clones
[12,15]. It led to the conclusion that the generation of a
fertile triploid P. formosa is a rare, if not a unique event.
We report here a molecular genetic analysis of a stable
population of triploid P. formosa outside the Río Purificación system. The allelic and genotypic variability of the
triploid lineages and the question how recently they
might have emerged was studied. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the triploid clones from the new locality
most probably are of independent origin of the Río Purificación clones. Thus fertile triploids may have been generated at least twice, but this event is much less frequent
contrary to other asexual vertebrates.

Results
In a genetic survey of natural populations of P. formosa we
analyzed 114 and 100 animals collected in 2002 and
2005, respectively, at a site in the Río Guayalejo (G) river
system. This river system is the next south but is hydrogeographically separated from the Río Purificación and Río
Soto la Marina system (P). Flow cytometric measurements
of DNA content revealed that 14 individuals of the 2002
(12%) and 16 individuals of the 2005 sample (16%) were
triploids.
The eleven microsatellite loci used to genotype the triploid clones detected very different levels of variability
(Table 1). Combining all loci the allelic diversity was
higher in triploids from Río Purificación (P) than in triploids from Río Guayalejo (G) (Table 1). Triploids from
both sites shared 35% of all alleles found in triploid individuals.
In a previous study on the triploids from the Río Purificación system the triploid genotypes were separated in
two lineages based on their overall genotypic differences
in the three microsatellite loci used [12]. The lineages
were designated Y and Z. Following this nomenclature the
new lineage from G on the basis of the same three microsatellite loci was named X. When additional microsatellite
loci were analyzed in this study they revealed that each of
the three lineages includes several clonal genotypes. The
clonal variation between individual genotypes was
mainly due to the variation at the two most variable loci
mCA20 and MSD23. The overall genotypic variation was
lower in G (4 different genotypes) than in P (20 different
genotypes) (Table 2). The recapture rate of clones was also

higher in G: three of the four clones found in 2002 could
be found again in 2005, while in P of the 15 clones found
in 2002 only three were found again in 2005. In and
between the years none of the triploid clones found in one
site could be found in the other site (Table 2). The lower
genotypic variability in G was confirmed by a frequency
analysis according to Menken et al. [16]: the proportion of
distinguishable clones in G (0.28 (mean of both years))
was lower than in P (0.60 (mean of both years)). The
clonal diversity value (mean of both years) was also lower
in G (0.57) than in P (0.88) (Table 3).

Discussion

In order to find out whether the triploids from the Guayalejo and from the Purificación system have a monophyletic origin, a phylogenetic tree using the Neighbour
Joining method (NJ) method based on dmu2 [17] was
performed (Fig. 1). This revealed a clear differentiation
between the X lineage found at G and the Y and Z lineages
found at P.

Triploid lineages in this study were analyzed using 11 microsatellites as well as mtDNA. Mitochondrial DNA was
found to be not variable enough to convey any information about the formation of the novel triploid lineage
found in G. For all three investigated segments of the
mitochondrial genome a single haplotype was present in
diploid as well as triploid individuals from P and G. This
may be due to the assumed single monophyletic origin of
all diploid P. formosa [4,19,20].

The separation of the triploids in G and P could also be
shown in a principal component analysis: one significant
axis (P = 0.039) was found that clearly separated the X
genotype from the Y and Z genotypes and explained 59%
of the variability found in the data (Fig. 2). A second axis
separating the Z from the Y genotypes was found to be not
significant (P = 0.858). A search for a closely related diploid genotype (meaning a diploid sharing all alleles with
a triploid) for each triploid lineage revealed that one and
the same diploid genotype was closest to all triploid lineages (X, Y, and Z). Such a diploid genotype was found at
P (P11). This was confirmed by the neighbor joining tree
(Fig. 1).
Mitochondrial DNA did not show any variability in the
cytochrome b or the D-loop sequences analyzed. The
same haplotype was found in the diploids as well as in the
triploids from all sampling sites.

In this study we have analyzed a population of diploid
and triploid P. formosa outside the Río Purificación system. From the high number of triploids found in both
years (12% in 2002 and 16% in 2005) we conclude that
in the Río Guayalejo system triploids actually are a stable
part of the population. They were as common as in the
formerly known Río Purificación field sites [12]. This is
also in the range reported in the literature for the occurrence of triploids identified earlier at these and other sites
[6,14,18].

Three microsatellites had been used in a former study to
analyze clonal diversity of triploids at several sites of P
and had uncovered only two different lineages: Y and Z
[12]. Interestingly, two of the additional microsatellites
used in this study proved to be very variable and showed
that both triploid lineages show a certain degree of clonal
variability. The high number of triploid genotypes
detected in the P site is concordant with the findings from
multilocus DNA fingerprints, which predicted a high
genetic variability for triploids [12].
Triploids from the G site form a clearly distinct lineage
and are less variable than triploids from the P site. The origin and the low diversity of the triploids in this site can be
explained either by the hypothesis that an ancient population immigrated from G, diverged and then went

through a bottleneck or that the triploids are of recent origin at the P site. Such an independent triploidisation at P
seems to be the most likely explanation because our
results show a clear separation of G (X) and P (Y+Z) genotypes in the NJ tree as well as in the principal component
analyses. Even though triploids from G share several alleles with the triploids from P those alleles are very common in the diploid population and might therefore not
have been inherited from a common ancestor.
Interestingly, the closest related diploid genotype to all
three triploid lineages was found at P. This result was supported by the NJ tree. While diploid P and G genotypes
were found to be mixed within separated branches the
three diploid genotypes (P4, P7, P11) closest to the triploids clearly came from P. We hesitate to assume, solely
based on this information, that the X genotype was
derived from P because the frequency of diploid genotypes varies greatly between years and the diploid genotype P11 or the related true ancestral diploid genotype
leading to the triploid lineage X might not have been collected so far at the P site or may no longer be around.
An explanation for the fact that the triploid lineages at the
P and the G site are closest related to the same diploid genotype might be that successful triploidisation may only be
possible in a certain diploid genotypic background, probably even a single clonal lineage. It would also fit the
observation that the triploids, which occur quite frequently under laboratory conditions are always sterile
[11] probably due to non-matching genotypes. In the
hybridogenetic unisexual fish Poeciliopsis convincing evidence has been produced that triploid clones are generated de-novo quite frequently, but that the third genome
was added always to the same allodiploid clone of a certain biotype [21].
A bottleneck due to breakdown of an old P derived triploid population (that invaded to G) and a recent recovery

and for the hybrid spined loaches of the genus Cobitis
[25]. Here, multiple hybridization events of a diploid
asexual fish with the host species established reproductive
triploidy [25], leading to several independent triploid
clonal lineages even at one and the same spot [24]. Also
in the mixed ploidy unisexual breeding complexes of the
Iberian minnow and the North-American genus Phoxinus, allotriploids are formed from diploid ancestors quite
frequently [26,27].

The X axis is significant (P = 0.039) and explains 59% of the

from a genotypically uniform small founder population is
less likely because migration of a triploid genotype from P
to G appears to be impossible due to geographic barriers:
the G river system is the next south to the P river system
but it is hydrogeographically completely separated by a
high mountain range. In this context it is interesting to
note that this border between the Río Purification/Río
Soto la Marina system and the Guayalejo/Panuco river
basin efficiently prevents transgression of fish species. It is
the northern limit or P. latipunctata and Xiphophorus variatus and the southern limit of X. xiphidium [22].

Triploidy in general is very often connected to parthenogenesis. Parthenogenetic triploid systems are widespread
and many examples are found amongst ants, lizards, salamanders, grasshoppers, fish, annelids, plathelminthes,
nematodes, and plants. (For reviews see [28-32]). In those
cases where the origin of the polyploid state is known to
be due to "genome addition", it is a rather frequent event
[28].
In summary, the triploids from the Río Purificación are
according to our present knowledge all monophyletic
derivatives of the same single introgression event [12]. On
the basis of our analysis we favor the hypothesis that the
triploids from the Guayalejo system arose from a second
independent hybridization event of P. formosa with its sexual host species P. mexicana. It is also possible that the
third genome is derived from P. latipunctata, which is a
third host species for P. formosa and occurs in the Río
Guayalejo and its tributaries [33]. However, this species
has not been detected so far at the locality where the triploids were collected. It will be interesting to search at further sites in the future, whether other independent
populations of triploid P. formosa exist.

Conclusion
We can of course not exclude that the triploid fish were
artificially introduced into the Guayalejo system by
human activities a long time ago, diverged here, and then
from a genetic bottleneck re-established themselves from
a highly divergent clone. River mouth hopping obviously
happened in the spreading of diploid P. formosa [23] but
is also unlikely as a source of triploids at G as triploids are
not recorded despite extensive sampling from the lower
Río Soto la Marina and the estuaries of both rivers. In
addition, triploids apparently survive and are perpetuated
only in the clear waters of upstream habitats [14].
Although the triploid lineage at G appears to represent an
independent polyploidization event, this is only the second to be described in many samples analyzed to date.
This is surprisingly rare compared to other asexual breeding complexes.
Multiple independent origins of gynogenetic triploid lineages have been found in the Poeciliopsis complex [24]

The microsatellite analysis identified the triploid fish
form the Rio Guayalejo as being genetically divergent
from the triploids of the Río Purificación. The most likely
explanation is that these fish arose from independent
paternal introgression events, through which an entire
haploid genome of the gonochoristic host species was
added to the non-recombining diploid genome of P. formosa. The fact that this introgression event was not a singular one, but might be much more frequent, supports the
hypothesis that triploidy might be a relevant mechanism
through which the new genetic variation is introduced.
This can supplement the generally low genotypic diversity
for adaptive changes to variable environments or parasites
that clonal organisms suffer from [34,35]. In addition,
accumulation of deleterious mutations as a result of the
lack of recombination in an asexual organism could be at
least partly compensated. It is, however, intriguing that
reproductive triploidy occurs obviously extremely rare in
P. formosa, compared to the other mode of paternal introgression, namely microchromosomes. Thus triploidy

appears to be of less evolutionary importance for the long
term survival of this asexual species.

and hence species identity can easily be determined on
2% agarose gels.

Methods

Extracted DNA was also used to investigate variability of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the triploids found in
both sites. We sequenced two parts of the cytochrome b
gene and parts of the D-loop sequence in triploids and in
two diploids from the two sites (P and G). The diploid
genotypes used for the comparison of mtDNA genes were
picked due to their very different microsatellite allelic pattern. For cytochrome b we used the primers L14724/
H15149 and L15513/H16100 and for the D-loop primer
pairs L15995/H16498 were used (all from Meyer et al.
2004 [40]). Amplification was done using the PCR conditions recommended by Meyer et al. We directly sequenced
the PCR products using the appropriate H and L PCR
primers. Sequencing protocol using the DTSC method followed the Beckman-Coulter instructions. Sequences were
analyzed using a Beckman-Coulter capillary sequencer
and the Ceq8000 software provided by the company.
Sequence alignments were done using the BioEdit program [41].

Sampling
The collection site is a ford approximately 1 km southeast
of the village of Emiliano Zapata at the Río Guayalejo
(23°16.624'N 98°56.315'W). Individuals were captured
using seine nets. One (5 mm2) piece of the fast regenerating dorsal fin was cut from each individual and stored in
ethanol (70%) for transportation to the laboratory.
Immediately after taking the biopsy, all animals were
released. Samples were taken in February 2002 and in
March 2005.
Sample processing
All fins were cut in half to use one part to determine
ploidy levels via flow cytometry and the second part to
extract DNA for PCR analyses.

For flow cytometric measurements the fins were stained
with the fluorescent dye DAPI, and ploidy levels were
determined using chicken blood as a reference, essentially
as described [36].
For microsatellite analysis DNA was extracted using 100
mM NaCl/0.5% Sarcosyl buffer and chelex (20%), according to [37]. The following primers were used: Sat1,
KonD15, PR39 [12] and mCA16, mCA20, MSD23,
mATG31, mATG38, mATG44, mATG61, mATG78 (originally from Walter et al 2004 [38] as reported in Lampert
et al. 2006 [39]). From the primer pairs, one primer was
Cy5 labelled (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany) at the 5' end, to
allow detection by an ALF Express sequencer (Amersham
Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) (see below). PCR reactions: 300 sec of denaturing, 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at
annealing temperature (52°C for KonD15/58°C for Sat1/
55°C for all other primers) and 30 sec at 72°C for 35
cycles followed by a 300 sec elongation step. PCR products were analyzed on an ALF Express sequencer using an
external marker (50–500 bp in 50 bp steps) (Amersham
Biosciences, Freiburg). Internal standards were used to
facilitate fragment alignment. ALF Express created files
(.alx) were converted into alf files using the appropriate
program ALX2ALF. .alf files were analyzed via the FM
(Fragment Manager) program (Amersham Biosciences,
Freiburg).
To confirm the morphological identification of the fish as
either P. formosa or P. mexicana a diagnosis by PCR with
primers for the src gene was performed [20]. Primers ScrE
and ScrF give one product of approximately 650 bp from
P. mexicana DNA and two products of 650 bp and 700 bp
from P. formosa. Homo- or heterozygosity of individuals

Data analyses
Triploid genotypes found at the Río Guayalejo site (G)
were compared to the triploid genotypes from the Río
Purificación site (P) from the same years for levels of
allelic and genotypic variability. Only individuals that
could be genotyped at all 11 microsatellite loci were
included in the statistical analyses. Genetic diversity
among triploids was described following Menken et al.
(1995) [16]: the proportion of distinguishable clones
(pdc = number of clones divided by sample size; a value
of 1.00 means every individual has a different genotype),
the effective number of clones (enc = 1/∑pi2, pi – frequency
of the ith clone in a population), clonal diversity (cd = 1∑pi2) and clonal evenness (ce = (1/∑pi2)/Nc – Nc number
of clones (Clonal evenness (ce) gives a relative and therefore comparable measure for the distribution of clones. A
ce value of one means all clones are equally distributed.)
were calculated.

We used the program POPULATIONS [42] to calculate
individual distances based on Goldstein's dmu2 [17]
between genotypes. To enable the inclusion of diploid
genotypes and to avoid an "oversampling" of the Y branch
only three microsatellite loci (Sat1, KonD15, PR39) were
included in the calculations. Individual distances between
genotypes were used to create a neighbor-joining (NJ)
tree. Bootstrapping values for the NJ tree were obtained
from 1000 iterations. In addition, we performed a principal component analysis based on all 11 microsatellite loci
using the program PCAGen [43] of individual genotypes.
10.000 iterations were used to obtain p-values for the axes
found. As the program PCAGen only accepts diploid gen-

otypes we re-coded the triploid genotypes that were based
on 11 microsatellite loci as 16 diploid loci treating the
alleles as independent units (e.g. 010203 040506 (two triploid loci) => 0102 0304 0506 (three diploid loci).
Results of the analysis did not change if loci were re-coded
in a different order (e.g. starting from the last locus or random).
