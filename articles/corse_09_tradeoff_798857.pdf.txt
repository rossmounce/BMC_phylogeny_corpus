Abstract
Background: The invasive Chondrostoma nasus nasus has colonized part of the distribution area of the
protected endemic species Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma. This hybrid zone is a complex system
where multiple effects such as inter-species competition, bi-directional introgression, strong
environmental pressure and so on are combined. Why do sympatric Chondrostoma fish present a
unidirectional change in body shape? Is this the result of inter-species interactions and/or a response to
environmental effects or the result of trade-offs? Studies focusing on the understanding of a trade-off
between multiple parameters are still rare. Although this has previously been done for Cichlid species flock
and for Darwin finches, where mouth or beak morphology were coupled to diet and genetic identification,
no similar studies have been done for a fish hybrid zone in a river. We tested the correlation between
morphology (body and mouth morphology), diet (stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and genomic
combinations in different allopatric and sympatric populations for a global data set of 1330 specimens. To
separate the species interaction effect from the environmental effect in sympatry, we distinguished two
data sets: the first one was obtained from a highly regulated part of the river and the second was obtained
from specimens coming from the less regulated part.
Results: The distribution of the hybrid combinations was different in the two part of the sympatric zone,
whereas all the specimens presented similar overall changes in body shape and in mouth morphology.
Sympatric specimens were also characterized by a larger diet behavior variance than reference
populations, characteristic of an opportunistic diet. No correlation was established between the body
shape (or mouth deformation) and the stable isotope signature.
Conclusion: The Durance River is an untamed Mediterranean river despite the presence of numerous
dams that split the river from upstream to downstream. The sympatric effect on morphology and the large
diet behavior range can be explained by a tendency toward an opportunistic behavior of the sympatric
specimens. Indeed, the similar response of the two species and their hybrids implied an adaptation that
could be defined as an alternative trade-off that underline the importance of epigenetics mechanisms for
potential success in a novel environment.

Background
Biologists have long recognized that introduced species
may have major effects on native communities. If an
invading species occupies the same niche as a native species, strong interactions are likely to occur [1]. Species are
said to compete when they have negative effects on each
other by consuming or controlling access to a limited
resource. Low resource availability and a large overlap in
fundamental niches make competition more likely. In
these conditions we can expect two main outcomes as the
result of contact between close competitors. First, one species may drive the other to localized extinction, as predicted by the competitive exclusion principle, which states
that no two species can occupy the same niche indefinitely
when resources are limited. Second, competition may
lead to ecological character displacement [2,3], in which
competition between similar individuals imposes disruptive selection on resource use and associated phenotypic
characters, leading to divergence and reducing competition [4]. Character displacement allows close competitors
to coexist by promoting divergence in resource use [5].
Phenotypic and life-history plasticity are generally important for successful animal invasions and freshwater fish
commonly display high levels of plasticity [6,7].
Chondrostoma t. toxostoma is a threatened, protected
endemic cyprinid species from southern France. Part of its
distribution range was colonized at the end of the XIX's
century by the invasive Chondrostoma n. nasus, from Eastern Europe. The mitochondrial divergence between the
two species calculated from cytochrome b gene was about 7
My [8,9]. Where the two species are found in sympatry, a
bi-directional hybridization phenomenon has been
described in the Durance river (Rhone basin) [8]. The
Durance river has been strongly structured by progressive
urbanization and an increase in human activities along
the river in the last 50 years. Various dams were constructed preventing fish from swimming upstream or
downstream and leading to the formation of different
water regulated environments. This situation promotes
the coexistence of the two species in a "closed" environment (between dams) and makes both competition and
hybridization phenomenon likely. Recently, Costedoat et
al. [10] demonstrated the presence of the two parental
species and different hybrid combinations in the Durance
hybrid zone. Furthermore, they described a unidirectional
change in the Chondrostoma's body shape, regardless of the
genomic combination (i.e. pure or hybrid), when compared to allopatric populations. Considering that the two
species and their hybrid presented this body shape deformation, the authors hypothesized that it could be a consequence of environmental adaptation rather than
hybridization. However, the authors did not analyze
either the species distribution, or the body shape deformation in regard to the environmental pressure degree

that could be defined in the Durance river. Indeed, it is
possible to define a highly regulated (HR) part (downstream) which has numerous dams and weirs leading to a
confined environment, with irregular alternation of water
flow, where the two species strongly overlap (through
space and time) and a less regulated (LR) part in which the
water flow is not severely regulated and in which fish can
notably migrate to some tributaries, (further upstream).
The habitat of the two species is known to be different in
the literature [11], with moderate to fast-flowing, large to
medium-sized rivers with a rock or gravel bottom for C. n.
nasus (Cnn) and fast and clear water rivers with a cobble
bottom for C. t. toxostoma (Ctt). This situation raises two
majors questions:
A century after the Cnn colonization in the Durance river
what is the distribution of the two species and their
hybrids in these two level of "anthropized" context (the
LR and the HR zones)? Secondly, is there a difference in
body shape between the specimen sampled in allopatry
and those sampled in the two different anthropized parts
of the river?
However, in the light of the differential environmental
pressure in the Durance river (due to the fragmentation of
the habitat), it appears obvious that others important
parameters could interact with body shape. Indeed, morphology is also known to play a major role in determining
the diet of a species, imposing physical constraints on the
minimum and maximum size of prey that can be ingested,
and affecting the efficiency of prey capture and consumption. A deep body shape is known to favor the consumption of benthic prey by increasing the manoeuvrability of
the body, whereas a shallow body shape is likely to be
beneficial for foraging on plankton [12,13]. Other important morphological characteristics define resource use: the
mouth morphology, defined by the shape of the mouth
[14-18] and the gape (maximal mouth dimensions) [1921]. The mouth of the Chondrotostoma species is furthermore a diagnosed character. Cnn is defined by a straight
inferior mouth and a lower lip with a thick keratinized
sheath [11], often linked to a specialized diet mainly
based on benthic diatoms [22], whereas the inferior
mouth of Ctt, is arched (the lower jaw is often considered
to be horseshoe-shaped -- first description Vallot [23])
and Ctt is known to feed on invertebrates and algae [11].
All these previous information underline the importance
to obtain a good estimation of the "chondrostome diet
behavior". However, dietary studies are difficult to carry
out without direct observation of feeding behavior or
without killing the animals. The fish of the Cyprinidae
family have pharyngeal teeth, which crush everything
ingested, making it difficult to recognize dietary components in the gut. For Chondrostoma species, we are also
confronted with problems relating to species conservation

status. The stable isotope analysis method presents advantages over conventional techniques in that it is compatible
with non-lethal sampling and provides a short- or longterm integral picture (depending on the tissue used) of
diet and metabolism [24-26].
Considering the Durance river context previously defined
by differential anthropization levels, it seems relevant to
test the modification and the interactions of the mouth
morphology and diet behavior between the specimen
sampled in allopatry and those sampled in the two different anthropized part of the river (the LR and the HR
zones). To answer these questions, we performed a morphometric study on body and mouth shape (for which a
new protocol was proposed) and used coefficient of condition and stable isotope analysis to determine the diet

behavior considering the age and sex of each specimen.
Modification of the different variable parameters and
their interactions were tested for the Chondrostoma specimens present in the LR and the HR zones (representing
the sympatric area) and those coming from the allopatric
area.

Results
Specimen identification and population description
The mtDNA sequences of specimens sampled in allopatry
confirmed their identification (Cnn or Ctt), with the
exception of the Dniester population (figure 1). The cytochrome b sequences obtained, confirmed that this population corresponded not to C. nasus nasus, but to its sister
group (See Additional file 1: "Phylogenetic relationships

analyses. The Genbank accession numbers of these Dniester population sequences are from GU112516 to
GU112525.

Chi-squared tests did not show that the sex ratio is significantly different from 1 in the populations (χ2 = 12.21, df
= 7, P > 0.05; except for Chee and Tisza were there is an
excess of males; χ2 = 22.54, df = 9, P = 0.0085). Fish do not
exhibit significantly different age distribution in the sympatric area (χ2 = 32.19, df = 15, P = 0.080), with most individuals being between two and three years old. Three of
the stations in allopatric conditions had older fish: Ain,
Dniester and Tisza; and one had younger fish: Chee (χ2 =
200.59, df = 33, P < 10-6).

Body shape deformation
We carried out linear discriminant analysis on the populations considering all the allopatric and the hybrid zone
populations. The first two axes were related to a species
effect (Cnn vs Ctt) and to treatment effect (allopatric vs
sympatric). We observed the tendency towards a change
in body shape in the sympatric population compared to
allopatric population as described in a previous study
[10]. Indeed, all hybrid zone specimens displayed a similar deformation of body shape, tending to blur the species
effect (figure 2). Linear discriminant analysis of the treatment effect allowed us to characterize the body shape
deformation. This deformation (with a tendency to a
spindle-shaped body and the snout steered upward)
depended on the sampling stations and was more accen-

Diversity index of the two species and their hybrids in the

The Shannon diversity index was significantly higher (P =
0.009) in the highly regulated (HR) part of the river (HMa-

3.35) than in the less regulated (LR) part (HBu = 2.93),
meaning that there are more different hybrid classes represented in Ma-Pe stations (55 hybrid classes) than in the
Buech (44 hybrid classes), the two parental species (Cnn
and Ctt) being present everywhere.

tuated in the HR part than in the LR part, (mean value of
-0.3306 for HR population and mean value of -0.1838 for
LR ones; F1,1106 = 26.68; P < 10-6), figure 3.
Mouth morphology
Mouth shape
A superposition of the mouth shapes of all reference specimens is presented in figure 4 and represents the variation
in mouth morphology observed in the two allopatric species. Despite an intra-species variance, we can discriminate the two species based on their mouth shape. Rather
than a species effect in the hybrid zone we wanted to compare the treatment effect (i.e. allopatry vs sympatry) and
determine if the body shape deformation in the hybrid
zone was correlated to a mouth shape deformation. A difference in mouth morphology was observed between allopatric and sympatric specimens and corresponded to
corner narrow shape (F1,909 = 122.53, P < 10-6, figure 5).
This deformation is not species dependent (F1,117 = 1.45,
P = 0.23, a detailed analysis of mouth shape deformation
in function of hybrid combinations will be presented in
Corse et al. in prep). This deformation of mouth morphology (R2 = 11.88), was less linked to treatment effect than
the modifications observed in body shape (R2 = 53.39 for
the body shape) and has been visualized figure 5. No significant differences were observed in the mouth morphology between specimens sampled in the HR part and those
sampled in the LR part (F1,735 = 0.44; P = 0.51).
Mouth gape size
The gape of the mouth (ratio gape size on body size) presented a significant effect according to the groups (the two
species and their hybrids; F2,731 = 45.68; P < 10-6) and was
also significantly larger for specimens sampled in the LR
part of the river than those sampled in the HR part (F1,731
= 4.53; P = 0.034), Additional file 2.
Diet behavior
Coefficient of condition: K
In reference populations, with a correction for age effect,
the mean K values for Cnn and Ctt were significantly different (respectively K = 12.50 and K = 9.84; F1,136 = 49.92
P < 10-6). In the hybrid zone, the K values were not significantly different and a species effect was not observed
(KCnn = 11.25; KCtt = 11.27 and KHy = 11.21; F2,1095 = 0.77;
P = 0.4645). Significant differences were observed
between the LR zone and the HR zone (respectively, KLR =
10.97. and KHR = 11.41; F1,1095 = 28.73 P < 10-6).
Stable isotopes: dC13 and dN15
The reproducibility was high for the different aliquots,
with generally less than 0.09‰ variability for d13C and
0.2‰ for d15N.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/26

We generated δ13C- δ15N bi-plots, with individuals plotted on the basis of their stable isotope signatures (figure
6). The allopatric populations of the two species covered
a very large range, both on the x-axis (δ13C axis from 33.84‰ to 18.32‰) and on the y-axis (δ15Í axis, from
6.47‰ to 16.81‰). Surprisingly, we were unable to discriminate between the two species due to a large overlap
between populations, but we observed a strong population effect (43 of the 45 pairwise comparisons corresponded to a significant mean difference). We were able
to differentiate between all the populations if we considered the two-dimensional space defined by the δ13C and
δ15N axes (with the exception of the Doubs and Ain Ctt
populations). This spreading over the isotope axes
(greater on the δ13C axis than on the δ15N axis) did not
reflect common hydrogeographic catchment areas, and
no grouping of populations based on geographic links
was observed.
The sympatric populations covered a large part of the total
range delimited by the species in allopatry (figure 6). The
variance was greater in sympatry than in allopatry (Additional file 3). Furthermore, for Cnn and hybrids the variance in the LR zone was higher than the variance in the
HR zone, whereas no difference was observed for the Ctt
specimens. Based on the δ15N, no significant difference
was observed between the groups (δ15NCnn = 8.069;
δ15NCtt = 8.335; δ15NHy = 8.19; F2,125 = 0.33, P = 0.7171)
but the difference was significant between the populations of the two parts of the hybrid zone (δ15NHR = 9.47;
δ15NLR = 7.673; F1,125 = 22.36, P < 10-6). No significant
difference was observed on δ13C for either of the groups
(δ13CCnn = -27.39; δ13CCtt = -27.53; δ13CHy = -27.56;
F2,125 = 0.33, P = 0.72), nor for the different parts of the
hybrid zone (δ13CHR = -27.69; δ13CLR = -27.42; F1,125 =
0.04, P = 0.84).
Variable interactions
We found a significant correlation (r = -0.36; P < 10-6)
between the treatment effect on body shape and the treatment effect on the mouth shape of the specimens (Additional file 4). However, no correlation was found between
the treatment effect on body shape and the stables isotopes (neither for the δ15C nor for the δ13N) no matter
from where the specimens were sampled. No correlation
was observed between the size of the gape and the stable
isotope analysis, and no direct link could be made
between diet behavior (visualized with the stable isotope
analysis) and the relative "robustness" or degree of wellbeing (represented by K) of the fish (data not shown).

Discussion
Competitive exclusion principle vs ecological character
displacement
The habitat of the two Chondrostomes is known to be sufficiently different [11] to expect the endemic Ctt to be predominantly in the LR part of the river (upstream) and the
invasive Cnn into the HR part of the river (further downstream). However, we did not observe this distribution
but the total opposite. Despite the presence of the two
species throughout the river, Ctt was mainly present in the
HR part (72% of Ctt; 4% of Cnn and 24% of hybrids)
whereas in the LR part the two species were more equally
represented (33% of Ctt; 36% of Cnn and 31% of
hybrids), calculated from [10]. The overwhelming majority of Ctt in the HR part could indicate the beginning of a
competitive exclusion process in this more disturbed environment, with the curious advantage of the endemic species. The Shannon diversity index calculated in this study
presents a stronger diversity in the HR part than in the LR
part, indicating more different hybrid classes downstream
than upstream (even if there is no significant difference
between the two parts of the river in terms of rate of
hybrids, calculated from [10]). These results illustrated
that the different sympatric zone environments could
have an influence on the distribution of the species and
that environment pressure, associated with competition
and apparition of new inter-species combinations (via
hybridization), led species outside of their ecological preferendum (ecological transgressive segregation).

Furthermore, regardless of the species, we observed a
body shape deformation between the two treatments
(allopatric vs sympatric), with a tendency to a spindleshaped body with a snout steered upward in the hybrid
zone. This deformation was environmentally dependent

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/26

with a stronger accentuation in the HR part than in the LR
part, but concerned both species and their hybrids. This
over-all body shape convergence is not in accordance with
the ecological character displacement theory wherein
when two species overlap geographically the difference
between them is accentuated in the zone of sympatry and
weakened, or lost entirely, in the parts of their ranges outside this zone [2-4]. We can not assume that this result is
due (or exclusively linked) to the hybridization process
because the intensity and directionality of hybridization is
not the same throughout the sympatric zone [10]. Adaptation for morphological specialization (here a spindle
shaped body with a snout steered upward) have been
explained in a wide range of fish species by a process of
competition between co-existing populations which leads
to resource partitioning [27]. However, we can also
exclude the effect of species competition, because we did
not observe a phenotypic divergence that could lead to
reducing competition (e.g. benthic vs limnetic shape as
found in sticklebacks [28]). But on the contrary all the
specimens presented the same morphological tendency.
Environmental pressure seemed to have more influence
on the phenotype of the species complex than hybridization and competition. However, the slight difference in
morphology observed between specimens sampled in the
LR part of the river and those sampled in the HR part,
tended to illustrate that the "regulated" effect of the river
is not the main cause of this new morphology.
Specialization in allopatric zones
To improve interpretation of the sympatric results we
detailed the diet behaviour of the two species based on the
different allopatric populations. We did not observe a specific stable isotope signature and the direct link one species/one diet behaviour could not be assumed with our
results. Some studies illustrated cases in which significant
difference between the diets of two species was not
observed based on muscle but was detected on liver (Cf.
notably in [24]). However, even if we did not observe a
species effect, we observed a population effect that led us
to think that the used of muscle instead of other tissue is
not the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain this pattern. If we assume that the baseline does not differ significantly between different tributaries or rivers, our results
indicate different diets for each of the allopatric populations. If we assume a significant difference in the baseline
between tributaries and rivers, we cannot compare trophic
levels between populations. However, what is crucial in
both cases, is that the dietary behaviour of the various
allopatric populations is markedly similar for the specimen belonging to the same population and characterized
by a narrow range (tendency to a specific diet behaviour)
regardless of the considered species. In summary, the
invasive and the endemic species displayed similar global
plasticity when all populations were considered. The gen-

eral larger variances observed in the sympatric populations compared to allopatric populations could indicate
that the specimens presented a more opportunistic dietary
behaviour. These variances could be the result of hybridization, competition between species (sympatry), the
water regulated effect, or a combination of these three factors.
The trade-off in fish hybrid zone: morphological
convergence versus opportunistic diet behaviour
The tendency toward a more "limnetic" morph in the
hybrid zone is, moreover, linked to a mouth shape deformation. Thus, we hypothesized that the phenotype deformation could depend on a significant alteration of food

availability in the river and, therefore, on diet behaviour.
The most obvious impact of introduced fish on native species is through competition for food [29]. Stable isotope
analyses made it possible to determine both trophic levels
(nitrogen ratio) and the spatial origin of food (carbon
ratio) [30-34]. Furthermore, as we tested the age and sex
difference for all the populations (none are significant),
the difference observed in term of morphology, coefficient of condition, or stable isotope could not be due to
these characteristics but to genetic and/or environmental
effects. Comparisons of the dietary behaviour of the Chondrostoma "complex" in the sympatric zone did not lead to
the identification of a species effect, but we observed a
wide overlap of isotope signature between Cnn, Ctt and

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:26

hybrid specimens. This result was confirmed by the coefficient of condition that presented no significant species
effect in the sympatric zone.
In summary, we observed a convergence in body and
mouth shape in the sympatric zone, as well as a large variance in diet behaviour. However, no correlation was
found between the sympatric effect on body shape and
the stable isotopes (neither for the δ15C nor for the δ13N)
regardless of where the specimens were sampled. Moreover, this morphological convergence could not be
explained by the resource use diversity, also known as
"individual specialization", in which it is assumed that a
population is composed of ecologically heterogeneous
individuals [35,36]. The absence of relation between morphology convergence and opportunistic diet behaviour
appeared to be more complex than expected in the sympatric zone (whatever the anthropic level) and even if the
species effect tended to be blurred in the sympatric zone
some characters kept this species information (e.g. the
mouth gape).
To move towards the epigenetic base of adaptation
Dietary shifts, from specialist to opportunist/generalist
behaviour, are often seen as a sign of invasion aptitude
[37,38], favouring the colonization of new areas [39,40]
and the results we obtained here did not confirm this tendency. This surprising result may be accounted for by plasticity in dietary behaviour that has been described
globally for other cyprinid species [41]. Elshoud-Oldenhave and Osse [42] were the first to show that many teleosts adjust their alimentary strategy according to the
environment in which they find themselves and the prey
it contains (and not in function of their invasive aptitude). Liem [43] described this multiple potential strategy
as "modulatory multiplicity". The use of this strategy
makes teleost species highly versatile and could explained
why we observed this populations difference regardless of
the considered species even if at the population scales the
diet behaviour appeared to be very specialised.

Furthermore, all the results obtained tend to show that
water flow is not directly responsible for the specimen
plasticity observed in the hybrid zone as was previously
hypothesized [10]. However, we could not exclude an
indirect effect of this parameter due to the influence of
alternate patterns of clogs and leaches, which characterize
this river. The Durance River is defined as an untamed
Mediterranean river, notably under the influence of floods
and drought periods. The major bed of the Durance is very
large and the minor bed often oscillates over it. Thus, in
this random change of water bed, the resilience periods
vary in length and fish are dependent on the abundance
of algal and invertebrate communities. We can therefore
assume that the tendency toward an opportunistic dietary

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/26

behaviour could be an adaptation to the rapid and stochastic changes in the river's benthic communities.
Finally, the results reported in this study deal with the theoretical concept based on the study of epigenetic mechanisms. These have been reported to have the potential to
create either the so-called maintenance phenotype if the
environmental conditions are unstable, poor or unpredictable (a typical situation for each invader, and in the
case of this study also for Ctt that is likely to feel uncomfortable with the new competitor Cnn), or alternatively,
the so called dispersal phenotype equipped to deal with
conditions of dispersal in rich, unexploited "luxury environments". This concept has been further developed for
fish, as the ontogenetic point was taken into account. As a
result, a theory of alternative ontogenies has been proposed to explain the capacity of fish to create either specialized or generalized phenotypes and/or life-histories
(e.g. in [44]). Finally, this theoretical concept has recently
been applied to explain the success of some invasive fish
and illustrate how biological invasion can also affect the
invader itself, resulting in both genetic and epigenetic
changes (e.g. in [45]). Epigenetic mechanisms (that can
lead to alternative ontogenies) may have important implications for potential success in novel environment. The
bighead goby study [45] and this Chondrostoma study
tended to demonstrate the importance of considering
such mechanisms in species adaptation and more globally
in biological invasion studies and conservation biology.

Materials and methods
Data collection, study area and individual identification
We studied 1330 chondrostomes sampled in allopatry
and sympatry. A subset of these samples came from [10],
the rest represent new populations. The detail of population and sample size for each marker studied is presented
in figure 1 and table 1. All specimens used for isotope
analysis were stored at -80°C except those from Dniester
and Berre, which were stored in 90% ethanol.

Whenever possible we determined the sex (defined after
dissection or canulation method cf. [10]) and the age
(defined by scalimetry) of the specimen. Morphology and
diet behaviour could be influenced by these two factors,
so we needed to check the sex ratio and the age range in
each population before comparing them.
The identification of the chondrostomes of new allopatric
populations was confirmed (i.e. to ensure that allopatric
specimens were "pure") by DNA extraction, with amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
gene (details of the protocols in [46]). Hybrid zone specimens (Durance River) were identified in Costedoat et al.
[10] by combining the alleles obtained for five molecular
markers (mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and four

Sympatry

Cnn = Chondrostoma nasus nasus; Ctt = Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma; Hy = Hybrids; HR = Highly regulated river part; LR = Less regulated river
part. * For CN analysis we added one allopatric Ctt population (Doubs N=15) and three Cnn populations (Allier N = 15, Flet N = 15, Usses N = 15).
See text for details of the identification of C. n. borysthenicum in Dniester river.

nuclear introns). The authors identified the two parental
species and 65 hybrid classes in the Durance. These 65
detailed hybrid classes were used in this study to calculate
the Shannon diversity index to compare the diversity in
the LR and HR parts of the sympatric zone. However, for
statistical accuracy in the study of morphology and diet
behaviour, we pooled all hybrids together because there
were too few specimens in some of the 65 categories.
Morphological analysis
Body shape
Body shape was analyzed by the landmark-based geometric morphometric method. We defined 21 homologous
landmarks on the body (cf. in [10]). All landmarks were
digitized, using TpsDig software [47]. Landmark-based
geometric morphometric methods were used to capture
information about shape, by obtaining the x and y coordinates of homologous landmarks. Differences in the sets
of coordinates between specimens due to scaling, rotation
and translation were eliminated by a typical geometric
morphometric approach [48,49] in which the specimens
were placed in a procruste superimposition on the iteratively estimated mean reference form, using the generalized procruste analysis (GPA) procedure. Points
representing landmark configurations were then projected into Euclidean tangent space approximating the
curved shape space.
Mouth shape
We investigated whether the difference in mouth morphology between the two Chondrostoma species (more precisely the lower lip shape) was correlated to dietary
behaviour. This required a quantification of the difference
in shape. All previous comparisons of mouth morphology
in the Chondrostoma genus were subjective (simple
description of the morph, see [50]). We characterized dif-

ferences in mouth shape objectively (as was done for the
body shape), using a morphometric approach based on
the landmarks method. The main problem encountered
with this approach is the definition of homologous points
along the line of the mouth. In our case, the two lip corners are good candidates for homology between the
mouths of the two species. We overcame the problem of
homologous points by placing tracing paper with a semiradian drawn on it over the image of the mouth (we used
Adobe Photoshop 5.0 for this superimposition). We then
adjusted the diameter of the semi-radian to the width of
the mouth, fitting the extremities of the radian to the two
homologous points (lip corners). The semi-radian was
divided by 37 lines (every 5°) and the intersection of each
line with the edge of the lower lip was digitized with
TpsDig version 1.40 [47]. This procedure was repeated for
all the specimens studied, making comparisons of mouth
shape possible.
Diet behaviour analysis
Stable isotope analysis (SIA) method
The two main elements used in stable isotope analysis for
ecological research (and particularly for studies of the diet
of fish [24,30,31,51-54] are carbon and nitrogen. Isotope
ratios are reported in delta notation as per international
standards: carbon from the Pee Dee limestone formation
[55] and atmospheric nitrogen [56]. Nitrogen ratio is considered to characterize trophic level, whereas carbon ratio
is considered to reflect the spatial origin of food [3032,51,53,57,58].

In this study, we used 294 chondrostomes for carbon and
nitrogen stable isotope analysis. These fish were chosen
because of the possibility to use muscle tissue [58] and
correspond to specimen sampled in 2001. The fish captured after 2001 were analyzed on the fields and then

released, we did not used them for stable isotope analyses
(but they were used for morphological study). Freezing is
the ideal method for preserving specimens, but storage in
ethanol does not seem to affect stable isotope ratios [59].
The two populations stored in ethanol (Dniester and
Berre) were therefore included in this analysis. Muscle tissue was collected from the dorsal musculature posterior to
the dorsal fin. Muscles were dehydrated by drying in an
oven at 60°C for two days and were then crushed with
individual sterile breakers. Samples must be dried sufficiently for grinding into a fine powder. Dried samples
were sent to the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory of Northern (Arizona University) for the determination of % N, % C, δ15N, and δ13C by isotope-ratio mass
spectrometry.
First we analyzed the stable isotope data obtained for the
allopatric populations, to estimate the isotope range (dietary behaviour) of each species. Then we integrated the
results obtained for the sympatric zone, for which results
were analyzed as a function of genotype (Ctt, Cnn or
hybrid) and sampling station (highly regulated -HR- part
or less regulated -LR- part).
Coefficient of condition: K
The relative robustness, or degree of well-being, can be
expressed as the "coefficient of condition" [60]. The formula most often used is: K = W/L3 (W = the weight in
grams; L = the standard length in decimeters).
Statistical analyses
Description of shape (body and mouth) variability was
performed using linear discriminant analysis on group
(Cnn, Ctt, Hy), "fragmentation"(HR river part and LR river
part) and station variables. We compared the mean and
variance for our variables of interest (isotopic signatures,
shape deformation axes, mouth gape size, coefficient of
condition) by way of analysis of variance. The corresponding factors were respectively defined by the species,
the treatment and the fragmentation. If necessary, log
transformations were performed to achieve homoscedasticity of the residuals. To take into account the incomplete
design of the sampling scheme, effects were tested using a
type III sum of squares. For each ANOVA, a global test was
hence performed, followed, if necessary, by pairwise comparisons, (using Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, [61]). Correlation between
quantitative variables was analyzed using the BravaisPearson correlation coefficient. Shannon index was compared between groups by way of permutation test [62].
