Abstract

The rigid cell wall that forms a protective layer around most
bacterial cells is chiefly composed of peptidoglycan, a
biopolymer unique to bacteria [1,2]. The backbone of peptidoglycan consists of a chain of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramate (NAM) units linked

by a 1-4 glycosidic bond between the two hexoses. The NAM
units of the glycan chain are linked to short peptides, which
are synthesized via a ribosome-independent mechanism, and
contain both canonical L-amino acids and unusual D-amino
acids. Cross-links between these peptides hold together the
glycan chains and give the cell wall its characteristic rigidity.

Background

interactions

Conclusions: Several related, but distinct, catalytic activities, such as murein degradation, acyl
transfer and amide hydrolysis, have emerged in the NlpC/P60 superfamily. The three conserved
catalytic residues of this superfamily are shown to be equivalent to the catalytic triad of the papainlike thiol peptidases. The predicted structural features indicate that the NlpC/P60 enzymes contain
a fold similar to the papain-like peptidases, transglutaminases and arylamine acetyltransferases.

Results: Detailed analysis of the NlpC/P60 peptidases showed that these proteins define a large
superfamily encompassing several diverse groups of proteins. In addition to the well characterized
P60-like proteins, this superfamily includes the AcmB/LytN and YaeF/YiiX families of bacterial
proteins, the amidase domain of bacterial and kinetoplastid glutathionylspermidine synthases
(GSPSs), and several proteins from eukaryotes, phages, poxviruses, positive-strand RNA viruses,
and certain archaea. The eukaryotic members include lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT),
nematode developmental regulator Egl-26, and candidate tumor suppressor H-rev107. These
eukaryotic proteins, along with the bacterial YaeF/poxviral G6R family, show a circular
permutation of the catalytic domain. We identified three conserved residues, namely a cysteine, a
histidine and a polar residue, that are involved in the catalytic activities of this superfamily.
Evolutionary analysis of this superfamily shows that it comprises four major families, with diverse
domain architectures in each of them.

Background: Peptidoglycan is hydrolyzed by a diverse set of enzymes during bacterial growth,
development and cell division. The NlpC/P60 proteins define a family of cell-wall peptidases that
are widely represented in various bacterial lineages. Currently characterized members are known
to hydrolyze D-␥-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate or N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine linkages.

While this generic structure is conserved throughout the Bacteria there are number of variations, in particular lineages of
bacteria, in terms of adducts to the glycan, and composition
of the peptide chain [1,2]. A large suite of conserved enzymes,
such as glycosyltransferases (which form the hexose polymers), racemases (which generate D-amino-acid units), and
peptidyltransferases and transpeptidases (which form interpeptide linkages) are involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan [3-5]. The bacterial cell wall is dynamic, and
undergoes reorganization during vegetative growth, development and cell division [1,2,6-8]. In these processes the wall is
disassembled through the action of a diverse set of enzymes
that hydrolyze various linkages in peptidoglycan. These
enzymes include glycosidases, such as lysozymes, that attack
the polysaccharide backbone, and peptidases that degrade
the cross-linking peptides [8]. Some of these enzymes are
also encoded by bacteriophages and are used to degrade the
host cell wall [9-11].
Biochemical and structural analysis of the peptide-hydrolyzing enzymes of bacteria have revealed a large diversity of
peptidases with different catalytic mechanisms. Some well
studied examples of these peptidases include Zn-dependent
peptidases of the Hedgehog carboxy-terminal domain fold
and the DD-peptidases with a PAS domain-like fold [12-17].
The Bacillus subtilis autolysins LytE and LytF, the Listeria
monocytogenes proteins p60 and p45 and the Streptococcus
PcsB proteins define another family of somewhat less well
explored peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing proteins that are
present in all bacterial lineages [8,18-21]. This family
includes the Escherichia coli membrane-associated lipoprotein NlpC, and possesses a catalytic domain containing a
conserved amino-terminal cysteine and a carboxy-terminal
histidine. Members of this family (here termed the
NlpC/P60 family) from the genus Bacillus have been shown
to be D,L endopeptidases that hydrolyze the D-␥-glutamylmeso-diaminopimelate linkage in the cell-wall peptides [19].
In B. subtilis, disruption of LytE (CwlF) and LytF (CwlE)
causes the normally rod-shaped cells to assume a long filament-like morphology as a result of defective cell-wall separation during cell division [18,19,22]. In L. monocytogenes,
p60 is an essential gene and has a similar role in cell separation [23]. Multiple paralogous proteins with NlpC/P60 catalytic domains are present in most bacteria, suggesting that
the NlpC/P60 family is a peptidase family with a widespread
role in the dynamics of the bacterial cell wall.
We sought to understand the evolutionary history of the proteins involved in cell-wall dynamics, because such an analysis could throw light on the emergence and diversification of
this uniquely bacterial structure. Such an investigation could
also uncover hitherto under-appreciated components of cellwall dynamic systems and could help in clarifying the biochemical mechanisms of certain poorly characterized but
critical proteins. Furthermore, there is considerable interest
in these proteins as they could be potential targets

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/2/R11

for antibacterial agents, and some cell-wall-hydrolyzing
enzymes from bacteriophages themselves function as
antibacterial agents. As a part of a comprehensive analysis of
proteins involved in bacterial cell-wall dynamics we studied
the diversity of the NlpC/P60 family. Here we present evidence that these proteins define a large superfamily, which
encompasses several conserved lineages of proteins which
were previously not known to be related to the NlpC/P60
proteins. These include the cell-wall hydrolases typified by
the Pal protein from streptococcal phages [24,25] and the
amidase domain of the bacterial and kinetoplastid GSPS [26].
We also show that members of the NlpC superfamily exist
outside the bacterial superkingdom, in eukaryotes, large
DNA viruses, positive-strand RNA viruses and certain
archaea. In eukaryotes, one of the members of this family
has been studied experimentally, and possesses LRAT activity rather than peptidase activity [27]. These eukaryotic versions, along with certain bacterial forms, show a circular
permutation of the domain which results in a swapping of
the positions of the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues
in the sequence. These observations point to greater diversity in terms of biochemistry, biological functions and structural organization than has previously been recognized in
this superfamily.

Results and discussion
Sequence analysis and detection of novel divergent
members
To determine the entire extant of the NlpC/P60 family we
initiated PSI-BLAST [28] searches of the non-redundant
database (expect (E)-value for inclusion in threshold =
0.01, iterated to convergence) with a number of starting
points, such as the catalytic domains of B. subtilis LytF
(ClwE) and LytE (ClwF), L. monocytogenes P60 and P45
and E. coli NlpC. A search with the NlpC of E. coli
(gi:15802120, residues 35-154) recovered several P60
homologs in its first iteration, YaeF of E. coli (second iteration, E = 3 x 10-4), the Arabidopsis homolog of LRAT,
At5g16360 (gi:15237330, second iteration, E = 5 x 10-4)
and LytN of Staphylococcus aureus (gi:3767593, fourth
iteration, 8 x 10-6). Reciprocal searches initiated with
regions from the newly detected proteins YaeF, LRAT and
LytN detected their closely related homologs in the initial
iterations, but in subsequent iterations they recovered
several classic NlpC/P60 homolog members with significant E-values (E < 0.01), suggesting that these proteins
defined a novel superfamily of proteins.
The large set of homologous proteins from diverse bacteria
which was recovered in these searches typically contain a
characteristic amino-terminal conserved region with a cysteine, followed by a carboxy-terminal conserved region with
a characteristic histidine (Figure 1; see also Additional data
files). In between these conserved regions there is another

Figure 1 (see figure on the next page)
Multiple sequence alignment of the NlpC/P60 superfamily. Multiple sequence alignments of the different families of NlpC/P60 were constructed using
T-Coffee [35] after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search results. The PHD-secondary structure [36] is shown above the alignment with E
representing a ␤ strand, and H an ␣ helix. The 85% consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following amino acid classes:
hydrophobic (h, ALICVMYFW, yellow shading), the aliphatic subset of the hydrophobic class are (l, ALIVMC, yellow shading), small (s, ACDGNPSTV,
green) and polar (p, CDEHKNQRST, blue). A ‘G’, ‘D’, ‘C’ or ‘N’ shows the completely conserved amino acid in that group. The numbers colored light
blue show the region where a zinc ribbon domain is inserted in the Arabidopsis LRAT homologs. The catalytic residues are highlighted in red, while the
conserved cysteine present in LRAT and related proteins is colored red. Specific columns of residues that are peculiar to a particular category of
NlpC/P60 (see text) are colored red. The consensus of the individual families and the entire superfamily are shown, and the subgroups of each family are
separated by a space. The limits of the domains are indicated by the residue positions, in bold, on each side, or internally in the case of the permuted
versions. A dotted line separates the amino and carboxyl termini of the permuted versions. The numbers within the alignment are non-conserved inserts
that have not been shown. The sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by the species abbreviation and GeneBank identifier (gi). An

three conserved motifs with a probability of chance occurrence < 10-12 in the search space comprising these proteins.
These motifs correspond to the above-mentioned conserved
signatures, which are characteristic of the NlpC/P60-like
proteins, and were readily identifiable in all true positives
recovered in the transitive sequence profile searches. Interestingly, the eukaryotic versions typified by the LRAT, their
viral homologs and the bacterial forms typified by E. coli
YaeF, while containing all the hallmark signatures of the
NlpC/P60 catalytic domain, showed a reversal in the positions of the motifs with the conserved cysteine and the conserved histidine in their primary structures (Figures 1,2).
Thus, in these proteins the central motif of the classic
NlpC/P60 proteins with the conserved glycine was the most
amino-terminal conserved motif, followed by the motif containing the conserved histidine, and then the one with the
cysteine. This arrangement suggested that there was a circular permutation with respect to the classical NlpC/P60
module in these proteins. All the NlpC/P60 homologs
recovered in the above searches were collated and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST-bit-score to highscoring pairs (HSP)-length ratios using the BLASTCLUST
program. Multiple sequence alignments were prepared for
the individual clusters using T-Coffee [35] and their secondary structure was predicted with the PHD program
[36]. A comparison revealed that the core secondary structures of both the classical NlpC/P60 modules as well as
those with permuted motifs showed 90% or greater concordance. These observations, taken together, suggest that
classical NlpC/P60-like peptidases, the LRAT-like permuted forms, and the divergent GSPS amidase domain-like
proteins comprise a vast superfamily of enzymes with different biochemical activities.

reviews

The presence of three tandem repeats of the NlpC/P60
module in the protein YwtD from B. subtilis allowed us to
define the amino- and carboxy-terminal boundaries of this
domain quite precisely. The domain begins approximately
25-30 residues before the amino-terminal conserved
cysteine, and ends 40-55 residues from the carboxy-terminal conserved histidine. A search for conserved motifs using
the Gibbs sampling procedure resulted in the detection of

characteristic stretch with a highly conserved glycine that is
often followed by an aspartate (Figure 1). Hereinafter, we
term these obviously related bacterial proteins as the classical
NlpC/P60 group. Thiol peptidases of the papain-like, transglutaminase-like, adenoviral protease-like, and caspasehemoglobinase-like folds have a conserved cysteine
(C)-histidine (H) pair [29-32] (Figure 2). However, the
context of the C-H pair in the NlpC/P60 peptidase domains,
along with the central motif with the conserved glycine (G),
defines a unique constellation of residues (Figure 1) which is
not encountered in any of the above peptidase families.
Accordingly, this pattern served as a good marker to identify
divergent homologs of the classical NlpC/P60 family. The
above searches unexpectedly recovered LRAT and its
homologs from various eukaryotes, Caenorhabditis elegans
developmental regulator Egl-26, candidate tumor suppressor H-rev107, proteins from poxviruses and animal positivestrand RNA viruses with statistically significant E-values.
Transitive searches initiated with the divergent members
detected in these searches additionally recovered the
amidase domains of bacterial and kinetoplastid GSPS and
the bacterial peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes such as Lactococcus AcmB, Staphylococcus LytA [33] and LytN [34]
and their homologs.

Secondary-structure prediction, based on multiple sequence
alignments, revealed that the NlpC/P60 superfamily domains
adopt an ␣+␤ fold with segregated ␣ and ␤ elements
(Figure 1). The first recognizable secondary structure element
in this domain is an ␣-helix that is present in practically all
members of this superfamily, with the exception of a few
members of the AcmB family from Staphylococcus aureus
(Figures 1,2), where it appears to have entirely degenerated.
The most prominent ␣-helix, which is conserved in all proteins of this superfamily, is the second helix, which is associated with the first conserved motif. The conserved cysteine
occurs at the extreme amino terminus of this helix and is typically preceded by a polar residue. The central motif with the
conserved glycine and the motif bearing the conserved histidine correspond to the two well conserved strands. Three
more strands are predicted to occur carboxy-terminal to

these two strands. Of these, the strand that immediately
follows the strand with the conserved histidine, contains a
conserved polar residue (either histidine or an acidic or
amide residue). By analogy with all other thiol proteases, in
the NlpC/P60 superfamily peptidases the cysteine would act
as the nucleophile that attacks the peptide bond, while the
histidine acts in sequential steps as the base and then acid
catalyst for the proton transfers [37]. In other thiol proteases
the histidine is oriented to a hydrogen bond with the cysteine by a third polar residue [37]. The presence of a third
conserved polar position in the strand that follows the histidine-containing strand suggests that it serves as the orienting residue for the catalytic histidine in the NlpC/P60. While
there is no directly detectable sequence similarity between
the NlpC/P60 proteins and other superfamilies of peptidases, the arrangement of catalytic residues, with respect to
the conserved secondary elements, in this superfamily is the
same as that in several other peptidase superfamilies

(Figure 2). The configuration, comprising a catalytic cysteine
at the amino terminus of a helix packed against a core threestranded ␤-sheet, with the second and third strands bearing
the catalytic histidine and its orienting polar partner, is seen
in the transglutaminases and a related class of amino-group
acetyltransferases, papain-like proteases, adenoviral proteases and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases [32,38]
(Figure 2). This suggests that despite the absence of significant sequence similarity, the NlpC/P60 domain is likely to
contain a structural core corresponding to the classical
papain-like protease fold (Figure 2).
In the case of papain-like proteases - calpains, transglutaminases and NH2-acetyltransferases - the three-stranded sheet
of the core is incorporated into ␤-barrel with five to eight
constituent strands (Figure 2). Contrary to this, in the case
of the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases and the adenoviral proteases there is a tendency for the sheet to be incorporated into a scaffold with other ␣-helical elements forming
a mixed ␣+␤ structure. The observation that the threestranded unit of the NlpC/P60 domain is followed by two
other ␤-strands, suggests that the NlpC/P60 proteins are
likely to form a five-stranded barrel similar to that seen in
papain-like proteases (Figures 1,2). However, in the
NlpC/P60 domain, the distance between the helix bearing
the catalytic cysteine and the core barrel is similar to that
seen in the transglutaminases and NH2-aminotransferases,
suggesting that it lacks the large insert that is seen in several
papain-like proteases (Figure 2). This difference may also
explain the failure of sequence-structure threading algorithms, such as the combined fold prediction and 3DPSSM
[39], to recover any significant hits to the papain-like proteases. Thus, the NlpC/P60 domain is structurally close to
the minimal ancestral unit of the thiol-protease fold.
The prediction of a classical thiol-protease fold for the
NlpC/P60 proteins also explains the circular permutation of
the conserved motifs that is observed in several members of
this superfamily such as LRAT and YaeF (Figure 1). Precedent for such a permutation is offered by the adenoviral proteases, in which the ␤-sheet with the catalytic histidine
precedes the ␣-helix with the catalytic cysteine [40,41]. In
this fold, the carboxyl terminus of the ␤-structure (barrel or
sheet) with the histidine typically occurs in close proximity
to the amino-terminal region of the domain (Figure 2). This
could allow a permutation to survive without distorting the
overall spatial arrangement of the catalytic residues. A comparison of the conserved residues and predicted secondary
structure of the ‘regular’ NlpC/P60 domain with the permuted versions suggests that the five-stranded ␤-barrel is
maintained intact, with the remaining segment including the
helix with the cysteine being linked to either the amino or
carboxyl terminus of the barrel (Figures 1,2).
The only biochemically characterized eukaryotic representative
of this superfamily is LRAT, which transfers an acyl group from

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/2/R11

the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to retinal, to
form retinyl esters [27,42,43]. The general base of the enzyme
(cysteine) accepts the acyl group from lecithin, and this is followed by retinol being directed to attack the acyl-enzyme by the
catalytic histidine followed by the release of the retinyl ester
[42,43]. The similarity of this reaction mechanism to that catalyzed by the catalytic-triad cysteine and serine proteases has
been previously proposed [27,44]. The phylogenetic relationship we demonstrate between the LRAT family of enzymes
and thiol peptidases shows that this catalytic triad was
derived only once in evolution and re-used for different
mechanistically similar reactions such as acyl transfer,
transacylation or peptide-bond hydrolysis. The presence of
an analogous situation in the transglutaminases [30,45] and
the related NH2-acyltransferases [46] suggests that diverse
acetyl/acyltransferase activities have been repeatedly derived
in course of the evolution of the papain-like fold. The presence
of duplicated versions of the NlpC/P60 domain in some proteins (Figures 1,3) suggests that the permutation could have
potentially occurred through a duplicate intermediate in which
the either the amino or carboxyl terminus of each of the copies
degenerated, leaving behind a stable permuted unit.
In the thiol-protease fold, variable-sized inserts are often
seen in the region between the strand containing the histidine and the strand bearing the orienting polar residue. This
feature is even observed in the NlpC/P60 superfamily,
including the insertion of an entire zinc ribbon domain [47]
in the case of the plant homologs of LRAT. The orienting
polar residue is either an acidic or a polar amide residue in
most members of the thiol-peptidase fold [32,37]. In the
majority of the members of the NlpC/P60 superfamily, this
residue is histidine, which in the appropriate environment
can act equivalently to an acidic orienting residue. In the
NlpC/P60 domains of the AcmB-like divergent group and
the circularly permuted YaeF-like and poxviral groups, this
residue is an acidic residue, as in most other thiol peptidases
(Figure 1). However, in the AcmB-like group it is shifted by
two positions with respect to the rest of the superfamily
(Figure 1), suggesting a specific elongation of the strand
bearing this residue in this lineage.

Functional, architectural and phylogenetic diversity of
the NlpC/P60 superfamily
We derived an evolutionary classification of the NlpC/P60
superfamily (Figure 4) using a combination of BLAST-scorebased clustering, conventional phylogenetic analysis with
neighbor-joining, least-squares [48,49] and maximum-likelihood methods [50], and parsimony analysis based on shared
derived characters (synapomorphies). We initially performed
single-linkage clustering of all the NlpC/P60 domains using
the BLASTCLUST program with different thresholds of bitscore/length values. This allowed us to identify all the major,
distinct lineages within the superfamily and also the individual ortholog groups that were conserved across various
groups of organisms. From these preliminary clusters, we

(Figures 3,4). All members of this family have either a signal
peptide or a transmembrane region, indicating an extracellular location (Figure 3). All characterized members of this
family are peptidases, and they either hydrolyze the D-␥glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate linkage or N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine linkage [19,25]. There are 10 clearly
identifiable orthologous lineages within this family which
have varying phyletic distributions in bacteria (Figure 3).
Some of these, like the YwtD-like orthologous group, are
prevalent only in Gram-positive bacteria, while the NlpClike orthologous group is present in both Gram-positive bacteria and proteobacteria. The Pal lineage of the NlpC-like
orthologous group is restricted to the bacteriophages and
their prophage remnants in Gram-positive bacteria. They

potent bacteriolytic enzymes [24,25]. They appear to represent a case where a host enzyme has been exapted (re-used)
by a virus for penetrating the bacterial cell wall.
The presence of the P60-like family in most bacterial lineages
suggests that a representative of this lineage was probably
present before the divergence of the bacteria from a common
ancestor. However, it appears to have differentiated to
several distinct orthologous groups only later in bacterial evolution. Several orthologous groups show a patchy phyletic
pattern: for example the orthologous group SCP1.148 is
present in the actinomycetes and the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. It shows a lineage-specific expansion in the former taxon, with 11 and 3 closely
related, paralogous forms in the genomes of Streptomyces

and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively. Such phyletic
patterns, together with the presence of members of this
family in genomes of phages and prophages, suggests that
lateral transfer was involved in the dissemination of some of
these orthologous groups. Gene loss is an alternative possibility that could in part explain the sporadic distribution of
some of these orthologous groups. If the trees showed a consistent clustering of proteins only from bacteria with large
genomes, in which gene loss is less pervasive, then gene loss
is likely to be a major factor. However, this pattern in not
observed (Figures 3,4), suggesting an important role for
lateral transfer.
In addition to the variable phyletic patterns, the proteins of
the P60-like family also show extensive lineage-specific
diversification in terms of their domain architectures

The LRAT family is thus far found only in eukaryotes and
animal viruses, with the sole exception of a single member
from the proteomes of Vibrio cholerae and Anabaena. The
LRAT and its obvious orthologs are found, in addition to the
vertebrates, in other animals and plants. In vertebrates the
enzyme has an important role in the storage and mobilization of retinol (vitamin A) as esters in peripheral tissues and
for generating an intermediate in the synthesis of the
rhodopsin chromophore in the visual tissues [27]. The
ortholog of the vertebrate LRAT, Egl-29 in C. elegans has
been implicated in the development of the vulva [57]. The
Egl-29 function is required in the cell neighboring the one in
which it is expressed, suggesting that it may have a role in
generating a regulatory signal [57]. This could raise the

refereed research

Both the LRAT-like and the YaeF/Poxvirus G6R families are
unified by the circular permutation that occurs at essentially
the same point in both these families. The YaeF/Poxvirus
G6R shows a peculiar phyletic distribution of being present
only in bacteria, the archaeon Archaeoglobus, C. elegans
and the poxviruses (Figure 4). The synapomorphy that
unifies this family is the presence of an acidic orienting
residue in the catalytic triad (Figure 1). Given the widespread distribution of this family in bacteria, with multiple
distinct lineages, it is likely that this family arose early in the
bacteria through a circular permutation from an ancestral,
classical NlpC/P60 domain. Subsequently, it appears to have
been transferred from a bacterial source to Archaeoglobus,
the nematode lineage, and the common ancestor of all
poxviruses. The high degree of conservation and maintenance of this protein across both entomopoxviruses and vertebrate poxviruses suggests that it performs an important
function in these viruses (Figures 1,4). Along with the LRAT
proteins, these proteins contain a second conserved cysteine
(red letters in Figure 1), carboxy-terminal to the catalytic
cysteine. This second cysteine has been shown to be critical
for a functional LRAT enzyme, suggesting that the poxviral
proteins may have a related activity (see below) [42]. Formation of acyl conjugates during the maturation of the lipoprotein component of the viral capsid could be one such
potential function. Alternatively, these proteins could function as proteases in the maturation of the viral particle.

The phyletic distribution suggests that the AcmB/LytN-like
family emerged early in the Gram-positive lineage, through
rapid sequence divergence. With the exception of the GSPSs,
all the proteins within each subfamily of this family are
secreted or membrane-associated. Even the closest relatives
of the GSPSs, namely MM2478 and CAC1526, are secreted

reports

The AcmB/LytN-like family is the most divergent family of
the NlpC/P60 superfamily (Figure 4). The monophyly of this
family is strongly supported in the phylogenetic analysis
(RELL bootstrap: 99%) and by synapomorphies, such as the
position of the orienting polar residue (see above). Two
major subfamilies within this family, typified respectively by
AcmB and S. aureus LytN, are predominantly restricted to
the Gram-positive bacteria, and function as cell-wall hydrolases. The AcmB subfamily shows a lineage-specific expansion in the genome of S. aureus, with around seven paralogs.
Both the subfamilies exhibit considerable diversity of
domain architectures, with most of the architectures mirroring those seen in the P60-like family. Thus, these proteins
contain fusions of the NlpC/P60 peptidase domain with the
SH3, choline-binding, LysM, lysozyme and NAM amidase
domains (Figure 4), and this implicates them in different
processes in cell-wall dynamics. A third subfamily of the
AcmB/LytN-like family is typified by the amino-terminal
amidase domain of the GSPS from ␥-proteobacteria and trypanosomes [26,55,56]. GSPS is a bifunctional enzyme: its synthase domain carries out the ATP-dependent fusion of two
glutathione moieties to the polyamine spermidine to form the
antioxidant metabolite GSP, while its amidase domain
hydrolyzes the amide linkage to release glutathione and spermidine [26,55,56]. The proteomes of Methanosarcina and
the Gram-positive bacterium C. acetobutylicum have a
member each of this GSPS-like subfamily. Both these proteins are secreted proteins, with the version from
Methanosarcina, MM2478, additionally containing von
Willebrandt factor A, immunoglobulin and fibrinogen-like
repeat domains (Figure 4).

proteins that are likely to function as extracellular peptidases. This suggests that even the GSPS subfamily probably
arose within the Gram-positive bacteria followed by a lateral
transfer to the archaeon Methanosarcina and the ␥-proteobacteria. In the latter lineage, it was exapted to function
as an intracellular enzyme, probably due to the similarity in
structure of GSP and the ancestral extracellular substrate,
namely the peptidoglycan peptides. MM2478 is a rare
instance of an NlpC/P60 superfamily member occurring in
the archaeal lineage. Its domain architecture suggests that it
might function as a protease in the maturation of the
complex extracellular matrix of this multicellular archaeon.

(Figure 3). In many proteins, the catalytic peptidase domain
is fused to domains such as SH3, LysM, and choline-binding
domains [51,52] (Figure 3). These domains probably aid
them in interactions with peptides, carbohydrates and lipids
that are associated with the bacterial cell wall. The
NlpC/P60 domain is also fused to other catalytic domains
such as the polysaccharide-hydrolyzing lysozyme domain,
and the JAB domain that has recently been described to have
metallopeptidase activity [53,54]. These are likely to function as two-headed enzymes that simultaneously attack different linkages in the murein. These architectures point to
the potential diversity in the biological functions of the
autolysins in bacterial cell-wall metabolism. They could be
functional at different spatial locations and at different temporal points in the life cycle, thereby contributing to the
diversity in the morphology of the bacterial cell and colonies.

possibilities. The drastic change in biochemical function
might have resulted in an accelerated evolution of these
eukaryotic proteins, resulting in considerable divergence
from the bacterial YaeF/YiiX-like forms.

The vertebrates possess two other distinct subfamilies that
appear to have been derived from the LRAT family
(Figure 4). One of these is typified by the candidate tumor
suppressor protein, H-rev107, which inhibits growth of
tumors induced by the oncoprotein H-Ras [58]. H-rev107
has been shown to exist in two cellular isoforms, one of
which is associated with the cell membrane [59,60]. This
suggests that H-rev107 could potentially act as an acyltransferase that might modify membrane components. A homolog
of H-rev107 is detectable in the pathogenic bacterium
V. cholerae, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that it has
been acquired through lateral transfer from a vertebrate
source. Further experimental analysis of this bacterial
protein could be of considerable interest, as it could potentially have a role in interactions with its vertebrate host. The
second vertebrate-specific subfamily is typified by the
uncharacterized human protein NSE2, which could potentially function in a similar capacity to H-rev107. However, in
these proteins the catalytic cysteine is replaced by a serine
(Figure 1). Such substitutions have previously been observed
in other papain-like peptidases with the serine participating
in a functional active site [61,62]. Multiple paralogs of both
H-rev107 and NSE2 are seen in vertebrates, suggesting some
functional diversification of these subgroups.

Conclusions

The viral homologs of H-rev107 were observed in picornaviruses such as human parechoviruses, Aichi virus and avian
encephalomyelitis virus [63]. We also detected related proteins in human caliciviruses such as the Norwalk virus and
related viruses (Figures 1,4). These proteins could potentially function as a second protease in the processing of viral
polyproteins, or they could function as a viral enzyme that
could modify some membrane component, like their cellular
homologs. All the members of the LRAT family, including
the forms from RNA viruses, clearly form a distinct family
which excludes the YaeF/poxvirus G6R family, which shows
a similar circular permutation. The widespread distribution
of the LRAT family in eukaryotes suggests that they possessed the enzymes from an early stage in their evolution.
The NlpC/P60 superfamily is largely absent from most
archaeal proteomes. However, it is very widespread in bacteria, and includes forms with circular permutations, similar
to the eukaryotic LRAT-like proteins. Hence, the LRAT
family was probably acquired by the eukaryotes, by the
lateral transfer of a bacterial precursor similar to the
YaeF/YiiX family. This could have either occurred during the
primary ␥-proteobacterial endosymbiosis, which gave rise to
the mitochondrion, or as a result of a subsequent transfer
from some other bacterial source. The currently available
sequences do not allow us to distinguish between these

We present a detailed evolutionary and structural analysis of
the NlpC/P60 superfamily of peptidases. We show that this
superfamily, in addition to the well characterized P60related peptidoglycan peptidases, includes divergent cellwall hydrolases typified by AcmB/LytN, eukaryotic proteins
such as LRAT, Egl-26 and their relatives, amidase domains
of GSPSs, and several other uncharacterized bacterial proteins. We identified three residues involved in catalysis,
namely a cysteine, a histidine and a polar residue, that are
conserved throughout this superfamily. A comparison of the
predicted secondary structure for this superfamily with
known peptidase folds revealed that these three residues
show exactly the same arrangement as the catalytic triad of
papain-like thiol peptidases. The NlpC/P60 domain is predicted to adopt a papain-like fold, in which the catalytic cysteine is at the amino terminus of a helix, which is packed
against a five-stranded ␤-barrel with the histidine and the
polar residue. The NlpC/P60 superfamily has diversified
into four major families, with two of them - namely the
LRAT and YaeF/Poxvirus G6R families - showing a circular
permutation of the catalytic domain.
This analysis could considerably aid further experimental
investigations of the NlpC/P60 superfamily. Certain
members of this superfamily such as Pal have recently been
proposed as potent antibacterial agents [24]. Identification
of novel members of this superfamily in diverse bacterial
proteomes could point to additional candidates with similar
bacteriolytic activity. Furthermore, this analysis could help
in identifying enzymes with important roles in bacterial
colony and cell morphology. Recognition of Egl-26,
H-rev107 and NSE2 as homologs of LRAT suggests a potential role for these proteins as novel components of lipid
metabolism in eukaryotes. Further studies on the homologs
of these proteins in diverse animal viruses and the pathogenic bacterium V. cholerae could help in uncovering hitherto unknown mechanisms by which these pathogens could
interact with their hosts.

Structural manipulations were carried out using the SwissPDB viewer program [68] and the ribbon diagrams were
constructed with MOLSCRIPT [69]. Searches of the PDB
database with query structures was conducted using the
DALI program [70,71]. Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple sequence alignment as the input for
the PHD program [36,72]. Signal peptides were predicted
using the SIGNALP program [73-75] and the transmembrane regions were predicted using the TOPRED program
[76,77].

compositional bias using the SEG program [65]. No such
bias that could skew the statistics of sequence relationships
in searches of the nr database was detected. Accordingly, to
achieve maximum sensitivity all searches were run with the
compositional-bias-based statistics turned off [66]. Multiple
sequence alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee
program [35], followed by manual correction based on the
PSI-BLAST results. Conserved motifs were searched for
using the Gibbs sampling procedure. Homologs recovered in
the searches were collated and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST-bit-score to HSP-length ratios using the
BLASTCLUST program [67].
