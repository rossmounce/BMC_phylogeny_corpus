Molecular evolution of Adh and LEAFY and the
phylogenetic utility of their introns in Pyrus
(Rosaceae)

Abstract
Background: The genus Pyrus belongs to the tribe Pyreae (the former subfamily Maloideae) of the family
Rosaceae, and includes one of the most important commercial fruit crops, pear. The phylogeny of Pyrus has not
been definitively reconstructed. In our previous efforts, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) revealed a poorly
resolved phylogeny due to non-concerted evolution of nrDNA arrays. Therefore, introns of low copy nuclear genes
(LCNG) are explored here for improved resolution. However, paralogs and lineage sorting are still two challenges
for applying LCNGs in phylogenetic studies, and at least two independent nuclear loci should be compared. In this
work the second intron of LEAFY and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) were selected to investigate their
molecular evolution and phylogenetic utility.
Results: DNA sequence analyses revealed a complex ortholog and paralog structure of Adh genes in Pyrus and
Malus, the pears and apples. Comparisons between sequences from RT-PCR and genomic PCR indicate that some
Adh homologs are putatively nonfunctional. A partial region of Adh1 was sequenced for 18 Pyrus species and three
subparalogs representing Adh1-1 were identified. These led to poorly resolved phylogenies due to low sequence
divergence and the inclusion of putative recombinants. For the second intron of LEAFY, multiple inparalogs were
discovered for both LFY1int2 and LFY2int2. LFY1int2 is inadequate for phylogenetic analysis due to lineage sorting
of two inparalogs. LFY2int2-N, however, showed a relatively high sequence divergence and led to the best-resolved
phylogeny. This study documents the coexistence of outparalogs and inparalogs, and lineage sorting of these
paralogs and orthologous copies. It reveals putative recombinants that can lead to incorrect phylogenetic
inferences, and presents an improved phylogenetic resolution of Pyrus using LFY2int2-N.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first phylogenetic analyses based on LCNGs in Pyrus. Ancient and recent
duplications lead to a complex structure of Adh outparalogs and inparalogs in Pyrus and Malus, resulting in
neofunctionalization, nonfunctionalization and possible subfunctionalization. Among all investigated orthologs,
LFY2int2-N is the best nuclear marker for phylogenetic reconstruction of Pyrus due to suitable sequence divergence
and the absence of lineage sorting.

Background
The genus Pyrus L. belongs to the tribe Pyreae Baill.
(the former subfamily Maloideae C. Weber) of the
family Rosaceae [1] and is geographically divided into
two groups: occidental pears and oriental pears [2]. The
majority of oriental pears are native to China; a few are

native to Japan and the Korean Peninsula. Chinese taxonomists agreed on 13 Pyrus species native to China,
among which P. betulaefolia Bge. and P. calleryana
Dcne. have retained characteristics believed to be ancestral for Pyrus [3] including the smallest fruit size and
lowest carpel number. Based on morphological traits or
crossing experiments, P. × bretschneideri Rehd., P. × serrulata Rehd., P. × sinkiangensis Yu, and P. × hopeiensis
Yu are putative hybrids among other Pyrus species
[4-6]. The circumscription of species, subspecies, and
forms for occidental species remains controversial. It is

believed that some cultivated pears frequently escaped
from cultivation and became feral. These plants hybridize easily, both with cultivated and wild species, resulting in a number of intermediate forms and segregants
[7]. Therefore, morphological characters are poor indicators of Pyrus phylogeny. Other data sources, like chemical characters, were used to distinguish some pear
species [8], but these were plagued by low number of
characters, polymorphisms, and environmental plasticity.
During the last decade, molecular markers including
RFLPs [9], RAPDs [10-12], genomic-SSRs [13,14], ESTSSRs [15,16] and AFLPs [10,17] have been applied in
Pyrus. These data provided useful information on the
origin of some cultivated pear groups, e.g. Chinese
white pears (CWP), which are assigned to P. × bretschneideri. However, CWP are morphologically different
from the so-called wild P. × bretschneideri in northern
Hebei province [4]. They also show a close relationship
to P. pyrifolia based on multiple molecular marker data
and thus were treated as P. pyrifolia White Pear Group
[11,14,17]. However, most of the studies have focused
on the relationships of several oriental or occidental species or cultivar pear groups, and the phylogeny of the
genus remains unresolved.
Plastid DNA sequence data and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA
(nrDNA) have been used for plant phylogenetic reconstruction due to ease of amplification. In the Rosaceae,
these data have been applied in phylogenetic studies at
different taxonomic levels [18,19], but their utility is
limited due to varied evolutionary rates [20-25]. Intraindividual ITS polymorphisms caused by incomplete
concerted evolution of nrDNA arrays have been found
in many Rosaceae [20,21,26,27]. Such polymorphisms
provided evidence for hybrid origins of some species in
Rosa [27], but they led to a poorly resolved phylogeny in
Malus [21]. Similarly, our previous study in Pyrus [28]
revealed a history of non-concerted evolution of ITS
and a poorly resolved phylogenetic tree. Six non-coding
regions of plastid DNA were found to be highly conserved in Pyrus [29], but they reflect only the maternal
genealogies.
An alternative source of molecular sequence data,
low-copy nuclear genes (LCNGs), has proven to be
more phylogenetically informative than either ITS or
plastid DNA [30]. These genes reflect biparental lineages
and are less prone to homogenization [31-33]. Due to
the accumulation of large number of gene sequences in
GenBank, it is now possible to design taxa-specific primers. However, paralog and lineage sorting problems
are still challenges to applying LCNGs to phylogenetic
studies, since they may lead to topological incongruence
similar to those caused by hybridization [31,34]. Gene
duplication is a prominent feature of plant genome

Page 2 of 19

evolution, and duplicate segments account for 60% of
the Arabidopsis thaliana genome [35]. In molecular
phylogenetic studies, nuclear genes undergoing gene
duplications or the birth-and-death process lead to problems in the identification of orthologs and paralogs
and discordance between gene and species trees. Additionally, frequent gene duplications made the terms
‘paralogy’ and ‘orthology’ ambiguous. Thus the new
terms ‘inparalog’ for paralogs that evolved after the
ingroup speciation and ‘outparalog’ for those that
evolved before ingroup speciation occurred [36]. Lineage
sorting (or deep coalescence) results from random fixation of ancestral polymorphic alleles, which may induce
similar topological incongruence to that of hybridization,
and poses the most challenging problems for inter- and
intra-specific phylogenetic inference [31,37]. However,
lineage sorting is a random process, and fixation of
ancestral alleles among species is rarely identical for two
unlinked nuclear loci. Therefore, incongruence caused
by hybridization and lineage sorting could be differentiated when comparing phylogenies based on multiple
unlinked nuclear loci.
LCNGs that succeeded in other Rosaceae are potentially ideal nuclear markers for phylogenetic studies of
Pyrus. The coding region of GBSSI has been successfully
applied at intergeneric and higher levels [26,38], but the
introns are too short and dispersed to be ideal gene
regions for interspecific levels studies. Another gene
region is the second intron of LEAFY, which is long
enough and has been proven to be informative for studies at the interspecific level in Pyreae [39,40]. Complete
coding sequences of two LEAFY loci have been isolated
in Pyrus [41], and the corresponding genomic sequences
in Malus species are available (DQ535885-AFL1,
DQ535886-AFL2). Thus obtaining introns of LEAFY in
the Pyrus taxa is possible.
Alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) is one of the beststudied nuclear-encoded genes in plants. Two major
ADH classes, class P with alcohol activity and class III
with glutathione-dependent formaldehyde activity, have
been identified in flowering dicot or monocot plants.
The former is common for plants and the latter has
been isolated in a few taxa including Pisum sativum
(P80572) [42], Oryza sativa (U77637) and Araobidopsis
thaliana (X82647) [43]. The Adh gene occurs in small
gene families, and has proven to be a useful phylogenetic marker in the Poaceae and Paeoniaceae [44-46],
but it is too complex a gene family or provided little
phylogenetic resolution in other taxa such as the Gossypium and Carex [47,48]. Two distinct Adh loci
(AF031900, AF031899) have been isolated in P. communis ’Packham’s Triumph’ [49], thus it is possible to isolate Adh genes among Pyrus species. However, the only
genomic Adh sequence from a species of Rosaceae is

Zheng et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/255

that from Fragaria ananassa (X15588) in GenBank [50],
and the exon/intron structure is unknown in Pyrus. The
phylogenetic utility of Adh coding regions and the
intron region have not been determined in any Rosaceae
taxa.
Since no LCNG analysis had been applied to phylogenetic studies of Pyrus, we explored the utility of LEAFY
and Adh. In this study, a comparison of genomic and
RT-PCR-based approaches yielded an initial description
of the composition and functionality of the Adh gene
family in Pyrus. The phylogenetic utility of Adh gene
regions and the second intron of LEAFY were determined after examining the sequence divergence, gene
duplications, lineage sorting and recombination.
Malus taxa were once assigned to Pyrus, but Miller
treated Malus Mill. as a separate genus in 1768 due to
graft incompatibility between the two [51]. Malus taxa
originated before Pyrus taxa according to the fossil
occurrence [52], and are here used as outgroups
(Table 1).

Results
Gene structure and paralog identification based on long
Adh sequences

A total of 17 Adh1 and eight Adh2 long partial
sequences were obtained by Genomic-PCR (G-PCR)
using different primer sets (Table 2) in ‘Cuiguan’ (P.
pyrifolia), ‘Nanguoli’ (P. ussuriensis), ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P.
sinkiangensis), ‘Flemish Beauty’ (P. communis), M. rockii,
M. domestica subsp. chinensis and ‘Ralls’ (M. domestica).
All of these Adh genes encoded medium-chain ADH
enzymes with 380 amino acid residues. After phylogenetic analyses, gene structure and sequence divergence
comparisons, two paralogs representing Adh1 (Adh1-1,
Adh1-2) and Adh2 (Adh2-1, Adh2-2) were identified.
As shown in Figure 1, Adh2-1 had a classical Adh
gene structure with nine introns similar to Zea mays,
Fragaria ananassa, and other characterized plant Adh
genes [53]. Exon and intron codes described in this
study were named following the classical gene structure
to avoid confusion. Adh2-2 had lost intron 4, while both
Adh1-1 and Adh1-2 had lost intron 7. Adh1-1 and
Adh1-2 have the same gene structure, but the former
was obtained by downstream primer Adh1-R1 located in
the 3’UTR region, while the latter was obtained only by
downstream Adh1-R2 located in the last exon (Figure
1). This indicates that the 3’ UTR region of Adh1-2 may
be divergent from that of Adh1-1. However, we were
unable to obtain the 3’UTR region of Adh1-2. Adh1-2
obtained in ‘Cuiguan’ (P. pyrifolia) displayed a 20-bp
deletion in exon 4. One of the three Adh1-2 clones in
‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangensis) and one of the three
Adh1-2 clones in ‘Ralls’ (M. domestica) displayed one or
two 1-bp deletions, respectively, in exonic regions. A

stop codon occurred in the exonic region in one of the
two Adh2-2 sequences of M. rockii. These sequences
were deemed putative pseudogenes and were removed
from subsequent sequence analyses.
Among these four Adh paralogs (Adh1-1, Adh1-2,
Adh2-1 and Adh2-2), only the intron regions of Adh1-1
and Adh1-2 could be aligned. Therefore, only the coding
regions were used for nucleotide sequence divergence
(NSD) and amino acid sequence divergence (ASD) comparisons. As shown in Table 3 NSD between Adh1 and
Adh2 paralogs was as high as 0.3, while that within each
paralog was lower than 0.02. NSD between Adh2-1 and
Adh2-2 (0.19) was much greater than that between
Adh1-1 and Adh1-2 (0.06). NSD of Adh1-1 and Adh1-2
between Pyrus and Malus were 0.027 and 0.035, respectively. All of these sequence divergence comparisons
were consistent with the consequent phylogenetic inferences, indicating that our identification of paralogs was
accurate. In most cases, NSD was greater than ASD
between different homologs, while NSD was less than
ASD within each homolog.
Both maximum parsimony (MP) (Additional file 1)
and neighbor joining (NJ) (Figure 2) trees based on
amino acid sequences of Adh genes from different plant
taxa displayed similar topologies. Class III ADH formed
clades separate from the putative class P ADH. The Adh
genes from the Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, Anacardiaceae,
and Fabaceae were monophyletic with high bootstrap
values, suggesting that duplication events leading to
these Adh genes occurred independently after diversification of these plant families. The Adh genes from
Paeoniaceae and Poaceae also formed monophyletic
clades; however, with low bootstrap values. Different
Adh genes in Malus and Pyrus (Rosaceae) were not
monophyletic. Adh1-1 and Adh1-2 in Malus and Pyrus
formed two sister clades with Fragaria ananassa as
their sister clade, suggesting that gene duplication leading to these two outparalogs occurred prior to diversification of Malus and Pyrus. Adh2-1 and Adh2-2 in
Malus and Pyrus formed another clade. Due to lack of
related sequences in other Rosaceae taxa, we cannot
infer their origin. Among investigated families, Fabaceae
is the most closely related to Rosaceae, but their Adh
genes did not show a close relationship, indicating that
the Adh genes have become highly diversified within
each family.
Phylogenetic analyses based on reduced Adh1 sequences

Only a short region containing intron 2 and intron 3 of
Adh1 (reduced Adh1) were sequenced from more Pyrus
species to investigate the phylogenetic utility of this
region. Adh1-1 was preferentially amplified and only
two Adh1-2 sequences were obtained in P. amygaliformis and ‘Dangshansuli’ (P. pyrifolia, CWP). Three

subparalogs, Adh1-1a, Adh1-1b, Adh1-1c, were supported by the tree topologies (Figure 3). These were
outparalogs that occurred before Malus and Pyrus
diversification. Only Adh1-1c was obtained in all Pyrus
accessions, while all of the three Adh1-1 outparalogs
were derived in the same nine accessions. Multiple
intra-individual polymorphic sequences representing one
Adh1-1 outparalog could be recovered in some

individuals. For example, five Adh1-1c sequences of P. ×
hopeiensis displaying autapomorphic mutations were
monophyletic in the tree, but only one sequence was
retained in the final dataset. Based on our previous
experience, such small mutations were more probably
caused by Taq polymerase errors during cloning and
PCR. Among these subparalogs, the length of intron 2
varied from 228 to 262 bp while that of intron 3 varied

from 114 to 117 bp, and subparalog associated indels
were observed (data not shown). A string of thymine
residues from 8 bp to 22 bp among Adh1-1c copies
made alignment difficult, thus this region was removed
from phylogenetic analyses. Two sequences possessing
characteristics (indels and substitutions) of different
Adh1-1 outparalogs were identified as recombinants by
Recombination Detection Program (RDP) [54], and 13
more similar putative recombinants were identified
manually by observing their conflicting positions within
the alignment. These putative recombinants were probably artificial products created during PCR and were
excluded from all analyses.
The final dataset contained 101 Adh1-1 and six Adh12 copies with an aligned length of 677 bp. The NSD
within each Adh1-1 subparalog was very low, ranging
from 0.011 to 0.013 (excluding Malus accessions) (Table
4). Adh1-2 from ‘Ralls’ (M. domestica) was selected as
the outgroup for phylogenetic analyses. MP (data not
shown) and Bayesian analyses (Figure 3) of this dataset
resulted in similar phylogenetic trees with little difference in support values (the Bayesian posterior probabilities are generally higher than bootstrap percentage).
Adh1-1 and Adh1-2 formed two separate clades. Within
the Adh1-1 clade, Adh1-1a and Adh1-1b were closely
related and formed a sister clade to Adh1-1c. Adh1-1c
was obtained in all accessions, but the relationships

Page 5 of 19

were poorly resolved with extensive polytomies. The
occidental species, P. communis, P. amygdaliformis, P.
elaeagrifolia and P. cossonii, were not monophyletic.
Most intra-individual polymorphic sequences were polyphyletic, e.g. P. calleryana, P. xerophila, ‘Nijisseiki’ (P.
pyrifolia) and ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangenesis). Adh1-a
and Adh1-b were only obtained in some accessions, thus
the phylogenetic relationships in these two clades were
incomplete, but the occidental species were monophyletic in both clades.
Transcription of Adh homologs

Specific genomic PCR (SG-PCR) and RT-PCR using
locus specific primers produced expected bands in the
genomic DNA and cDNA samples. Both Adh1 and
Adh2 were transcribed in all investigated tissues and
cultivars (Figure 4). To investigate the transcription of
different Adh homologs, phylogenetic analyses including
sequences derived from SG-PCR, G-PCR and RT-PCR
were conducted for Adh1 and Adh2 separately, and the
putative pseudogenes identified above were also
included to enhance the findings on functionality of
Adh homologs.
As indicated in Additional file 2 the transcription of
an Adh1-2 copy was not observed. We speculate that
Adh1-2 is a nonfunctional outparalog, since putative
pseudogenes have been identified and its 3’UTR region
is divergent from Adh1-1 as described above. Among
the Adh1-1 outparalogs the most frequently cloned
Adh1-1c was not recovered by RT-PCR, indicating that
it was a degenerate outparalog. This also explains its
preferential amplification. Transcription of the other
Adh1-1 outparalogs was detected among different tissues or cultivars. Transcription of Adh2-1 could be
detected in all investigated tissues and cultivars. An
Adh2-1 sequence was not obtained in the three Malus
accessions by G-PCR, but its transcription was found in
‘Fuji’ (M. domestica) (Additional file 3). Adh2-2 was
only observed in Malus taxa, and transcription of this
paralog was not detected. We could not deduce distinct
tissue-specific or cultivar-specific expression for either
Adh1-1 or Adh2-1. Several anomalous Adh2-1 copies
with only intron 6 were recovered by cloning of RTPCR products in ‘Flemish Beauty’ (P. communis) and
‘Nanguoli’ (P. ussuriensis) (HQ912054, HQ912055 and
HQ912056). Since intron-containing cDNA has not
been reported, those copies may be amplified due to
genomic DNA contamination and indicate existence of
an additional Adh2 paralog with more intron loss in
Pyrus.

length variations in the exon region were observed:
LFY1-Malus (407 bp), LFY1-Pyrus (395 bp), LFY2-Malus
(410 bp) and LFY2-Pyrus (401 bp), which were congruent with those from RT-PCR in P. pyrifolia ’Housui’
(LFY1-AB162029, LFY2-AB162035) and M. domestica

’Fuji’ (LFY1-AB162028 LFY2-AB162034), respectively.
The length of these indels only had an effect on the
length of the deduced amino acid sequences. Among
Pyrus accessions, NSD of this partial exon 2 between
LFY1 and LFY2 was relatively high (0.076), while that

within LFY1 and LFY2 was low at 0.013 and 0.015,
respectively (data not shown).
The entire intron 2 of LFY1 among Pyrus species ranged from 774-783 bp, while that of LFY2 ranged from
670 to 700 bp. LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 were amplified in
all accessions using specific primers, but LFY2int2 of M.
rockii and M. domestica subsp. chinensis were amplified
by another forward primer MLFY2-F (Table 2) due to a
large deletion (approximately 220 bp, GU991522 vs
DQ535886) in these two accessions. LFY2int2 of all
Malus accessions contained a 211-bp insertion, which
made alignment difficult and was removed from the
analyses. NSD within LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 among
Pyrus accessions was 0.019 and 0.029, respectively
(Table 4), while that between Malus and Pyrus was
much higher at 0.057 for LFY1int2 and 0.066 for
LFY2int2 (data not shown).
Sequence variation and phylogenetic analyses of
LFY1int2 suggest two subparalogs, LFY1int2-a and
LFY1int2-b, among Pyrus species. Compared with
LFY1int2-a, LFY1int2-b contains a 6-bp insertion.
Recovery of LFY1int2-a and LFY1int2-b in each accession is shown in Table 1. Among oriental species, NSD
within LFY1int2-a was lower than that within LFY1int2b for both ORF regions (0.002, 0.009) and intron regions
(0.005, 0.013). Between LFY1int2-a and LFY1int2-b,
NSD was 0.007 for the ORF region and 0.017 in for the
intron region. For LFY2int2, subparalogs with an 8-bp
insertion (LFY2int2-Ins8) and 2-bp deletion (LFY2int2Del2) were only recovered in a few accessions. The
common LFY2int2-N, with no indel, was recovered in
all accessions but ‘Yali’ (P. pyrifolia, CWP) (Table 1).
Coexistence of these subparalogs in one individual could
be detected by direct sequencing due to the fixed position of indels. A minimum of three clones were
sequenced. It was found that PCR or direct sequencing
sometimes did not reflect the subparalogs existing in
one genome, probably due to amplification preference

of different nuclear alleles. For example, direct sequencing of LFY2int2 in P. calleryana identified LFY2int2-N,
but a LFY2int2-Del2 sequence was obtained by cloning.
Several anomalous LFY2int2 copies were exclusively
found in particular accessions. LFY2int2 from P. communis had a 21-bp deletion. LFY2int2 from P. fauriei
had a 525-bp insertion that was partially homologous
(reverse and complement) to the noncoding region of
the S-RNase gene (AB308360), and was named
LFY2int2-S. To eliminate the possibility of genetic
recombination during PCR, all accessions were tested
with an insert-specific upstream forward primer ‘LFY2SF’ (Table 1) and the reverse primer LFY2-R. As a result,
the LFY2int2-S was detected in ‘Yali’ (P. pyrifolia,
CWP), ‘Jianbali’ (P. pyrifolia CWP), and ‘Yaguang’ (P.
ussuriensis), but the sequences were not included in the
phylogenetic analyses. LFY2int2-S in P. fauriei was still
included in the dataset after the exclusion of its large
insertion.

Phylogenetic analyses of LFY1int2 and LFY2int2

Malus sieboldii and M. domestica (DQ535885-ALF1,
DQ535886-ALF2) without the 220-bp deletion in
LFY2int2 were used as outgroups in phylogenetic analyses of LFY1int2 and LFY2int2. Putative recombinants
were identified by RDP or by investigating abnormal
substitution patterns and ambiguous alignment positions. The putative recombinants displayed unique substitutions of sequences from two distinct subclades and
always formed well-separated clades in the tree, thus
they were excluded from the final analyses (data not
shown). A total of 57 LFY1int2 (four from Malus) and
46 LFY2int2 (three from Malus) sequences were
included in two separate datasets. Excluding sequences
from Malus, the LFY1int2 dataset had an aligned length
of 653 sites, of which 61 (9.3%) were parsimony informative, while LFY2int2 had an aligned length of 562
sites and 46 (8.2%) were parsimony informative (Table
4). Similarly, only Bayesian trees were shown for both
LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 datasets.
As shown in Figure 5, LFY1int2-a formed a monophyletic clade. The relationships within this clade were largely unresolved; however, close relationships among P.
× serrulata, P. calleryana and ‘Yali’ (P. pyrifolia, CWP)
were resolved with high bootstrap support. Most of the
subclades of LFY1int2-b were unresolved polytomies sister to LFY1int2-a. The occidental species were not
monophyletic, since three sequences from P. amygdaliformis and P. elaeagrifolia formed a highly supported
independent clade. These three sequences, representing
a paralog termed LFY1int2-c, displayed many unique
variations and shared several substitutions with outgroup accessions. LFY1int2-c was reamplified in these
four occidental species, and could be frequently cloned
in P. amygdaliformis and P. elaeagrifolia. The origin of
LFY1int2-c is unclear.
Relationships inferred by LFY2int2 were much better
resolved, with higher support values and fewer polytomies (Figure 6), than those of LFY1int2., but the relationships within most subclades were still unresolved.
Two major clades were resolved. In clade I, the four
occidental species and a clone of ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangensis) formed a subclade sister to that of oriental
pear including ‘Yaguang’ (P. ussuriensis), P. betulaefolia,
P. × phaeocarpa and P. × hopeiensis. In clade II
LFY2int2-Ins8 and LFY2int2-Del2 were monophyletic
and mixed with LFY2int2-N sequences, thus they were
inparalogs of recent origin. It is notable that the four
LFY2int2-N sequences from P. xerophila were putative
recombinants. They shared mutations with sequence
from multiple subclades and also had unique mutations.
Phylogenetic positions of these P. xerophila sequences
were unresolved: P. xerophila (2/4) and P. xerophila (3/
4) were sisters and formed a separate clade, P. xerophila

Page 10 of 19

(4/4) also formed a separate clade, and P. xerophila (1/
4) shared mutations with occidental species and formed
a separate subclade within clade I. It seems impossible
that divergent copies in one genome are all recombinants, thus these sequences were included in the phylogenetic analyses and are highlighted in bold in Figure 6.
Similarly, the LFY2int2-S of P. fauriei formed an unresolved separate clade.

Discussion
Frequency of Adh and LEAFY duplication

Gene duplication plays an important role in increasing
the diversity of gene function and expression, which can
enable plants to colonize diverse habitats. Most monocots and dicots have at least two Adh genes, indicating
that an initial Adh gene duplication occurred before the
divergence of these plant taxa, and separate duplications
have subsequently taken place [46]. Two major loci in
Malus and Pyrus, Adh1 and Adh2, are outparalogs
derived from an ancient gene split. Based on an estimated 0.66% rate of nucleotide substitution per million
year of Adh in Drosophila [55] and 0.2-0.3% in mammalian nuclear genes [56], the split occurred approximately
50 million years ago. In maize Adh1 and Adh2 share
87% identity at the amino acid sequence level but are
located on different chromosomes and differ in the level
of tissue-specific expression [57]. The expression of
three Adh genes with 85% and 87% shared amino acid
identity in Vitis vinifera varied in developmental stage
of grape berries and affinity to either ethanol or acetaldehyde as a substrate [58]. ADH from apple had optimal
acetaldehyde activity at pH 5.5-6.0 and ethanol activity
at pH 7.0-10.0 [59]. Therefore, Adh1-1 and Adh2-1 in
Pyrus (ASD = 0.170, Table 3) with less shared identity,
likely also have diversified their expression patterns and
substrate affinity. ADH plays an essential role in the biosynthetic pathway of aroma volatiles in apple and pear
fruits by reducing aldehydes to alcohols [60-62]. It will
be interesting to determine functional divergence of
Adh genes and kinetic properties of the corresponding
ADH enzymes in Pyrus and Malus.
Two paralogs representing Adh1 (Adh1-1 and Adh1-2)
and Adh2 (Adh2-1 and Adh2-2) were observed by GPCR. Among these the Adh2-1 may be the most ancestral since it has the classical nine-intron Adh structure,
which is widely conserved among angiosperms and gymnosperms [53]. Intron losses have been found in Adh
genes of diverse taxa like Arabidopsis thaliana [63,64]
and Mangifera indica [65]. In some species of Leavenwortia, an expressed intronless Adh3 locus occurs and is
thought to have arisen by an mRNA intermediate [66].
The single intron loss found in our study lends support
to the ‘intron exclusion hypothesis’, which suggests that
a single intron could be precisely removed by double

strand breaks from a multiple-intron gene [67]. Adh1-2,
with the same gene structure as Adh1-1, was a putative
nonfunctional outparalog derived by gene duplication
(loss of intron 7, Figure 1). Gene duplication leading to
Adh1-2, as inferred by the tree topology (Figure 2),
occurred before Malus and Pyrus diverged, but probably
after diversification of Pyreae taxa, since the orthologous
Adh gene in Fragaria (Rosoideae) displayed the classical
nine-intron structure. Additionally, the NSD between
Adh1-1 and Adh1-2 in Pyrus was 0.06 (Table 3), which
was much lower than that between Adh1-1 in Pyrus and
Adh in Fragaria (0.10) (data not shown). However, the
NSD in the coding region between these outparalogs
was too low to confirm the non-functionality of Adh1-2.
Adh2-1 was not obtained in Malus accessions by GPCR, probably due to an amplification preference for
Adh2-2, but its transcription was detected in ‘Fuji’

(Additional file 3). Adh2-2 was recovered neither in
Pyrus by G-PCR and SG-PCR nor in Malus or Pyrus by
RT-PCR. Compared with Adh1-1 and Adh1-2, the ASD
between Adh2-1 and Adh2-2 was much higher (Table 3)
and exon/intron structure also varied (Figure 1). Due to
the lack of highly homologous Adh2 sequences from
other Rosaceae taxa, is the origin of Adh2-2 is uncertain.
It may be a duplicated inparalog derived from Adh2-1
and restricted to Malus taxa or a functional outparalog
that appeared before Malus and Pyrus diverged and was
subsequently lost during diversification of Pyrus species.
The latter theory is similar to the paralog sorting of
RPB1 and RPB2 in different core eudicots taxa [68].
Specific RT-PCR for additional tissues and specific GPCR for more Rosaceae taxa will be needed to examine
the origin and transcription of Adh2-2. Three subparalogs representing Adh1-1 (Adh1-1a, Adh1-1b, Adh1-1c)

were identified by accession sequencing (Figure 3),
although Adh1-1c may not be transcribed. It is unknown
whether similar subparalogs have evolved for Adh1-2
and Adh2-2.
Our study revealed that ancient and recent duplications led to the complex structure of Adh outparalogs in
Pyrus and Malus resulting in neofunctionalization, nonfunctionalization and possible subfunctionalization, the
three common fates of gene duplications. Adh homologs
in Malus and Pyrus were more complex than those in
other angiosperms like Paeonia [69], grasses [44] or
legumes [70], but similar to those in Gossypium [48].
Gossypium has at least seven Adh loci of two primary
lineages in diploid species and the Adh gene family is
dynamic with pseudogenization and gene elimination.
Genomic data suggest that almost all angiosperms, perhaps even all plant groups, have experienced one to several rounds of polyploidy [71,72]. Though Malus and
Pyrus accessions used in this study were all diploid (x =
17), Pyreae taxa with x = 17 are derived from autopolyploidization of the formerly Spiraeoid ancestors with x =
9 [30]. This apparently accounts for such complex paralogs, and similar Adh gene structures could be imputed
for other Pyreae taxa with x = 17.
LEAFY was first found to be a homeotic gene encoding a transcription regulator for differentiation of the
floral meristem and flowering time in Arabidopsis and
was expected to be a single-copy gene in diploid angiosperms [73]. In our study, two major lineages, LFY1 and
LFY2, were recovered in both Pyrus and Malus, as in
many other Pyreae taxa including the formerly Spiradeae
taxa with x = 9 [39,41], suggesting gene duplication of
these two paralogs before diversification of the Rosaceae.
LFY1 and LFY2 in apple are located on distinct chromosomes and thus are not alleles [74]. In a study including
the pear cultivars ‘Housui’ (P. pyrifolia) and ‘Barlett’ (P.
communis), the transcriptional patterns of two LEAFY
homologs differed in developmental stages and tissues,
and each homolog varied among plant taxa [41]. In our
study, genus-specific and locus-specific indels were discovered in coding regions, which would alter the length
of the corresponding amino acid sequences. These
might be responsible for the diversification of LEAFY
gene functions.
Multiple inparalogs of LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 were
observed, and their recovery varied among our accessions (Table 1). LFY1int2-a and LFY1int2-b were
unequally observed among Pyrus species (Table 1).
LFY1int2-a is monophyletic with shorter branch lengths
than LFY1int2-b (Figure 5), suggesting it might be an
inparalog derived from LFY1int2-b by a recent duplication. This would have occurred after the divergence of
occidental and oriental pears, because only LFY1int2-a
is not found in occidental pears. Consequently,

Page 13 of 19

LFY1int2-b was lost during diversification of some
oriental species, which explains paralog sorting during
diversification of Pyrus. Three LFY1int2-c sequences in
two west Asian species (P. amygdaliformis and P. elaeagrifolia) formed a separate clade (Figure 5). We suggest
two possible explanations for their origin: 1) they are
pseudogenes derived from LFY1int2-b, but have evolved
more rapidly, and thus are highly divergent from
LFY2int2-b; 2) they represent another outparalog of
LFY1int2, derived from gene duplication that occurred
before diversification of the occidental species, that was
subsequently lost in some occidental species. However,
only the second intron of LFY1int2-c was sequenced. To
help differentiate between these two possibilities the
entire exonic region must be obtained and its presence
in more Pyrus species investigated. For LFY2int2, the
common LFY2int2-N was recovered in all accessions
but ‘Yali’ (P. pyrifolia, CWP). LFY2int2-Ins8 and
LFY2int2-Del2 are inparalogs that originated recently
after Pyrus diversification and were only recovered in a
few accessions (Figure 6). LFY2int2-S, with a long insertion homologous noncoding region of S-RNase gene,
was similar to functional AFL1a copies found in some
apple cultivars [74]. Genomic Southern analysis also
showed that apple had other homologues in addition to
AFL1 and AFL2 [75]. However, the relationships among
these homologs have not been published. Only a few
accessions contained LFY2int2-S (Table 1), and only the
one from P. fauriei was included in our analyses. It is
unknown how the intron of the RNase gene was
inserted in the second intron of LFY2 and whether
LFY2int2-S is functional. Additional research found both
LFY2int2-S and LFY2int2-N in multiple species, and
showed the LFY2int2-S sequences were all highly divergent from LFY2int2-N even after exclusion of the large
insertion (unpublished data).
Incongruence and poor resolution

Paralogs and lineage sorting are two major challenges
when conducting phylogenetic analyses based on
LCNGs, because they can lead to incongruent patterns
similar to those resulting from hybridization and polyploidization [31]. Paralogs reflect a horizontal event, the
gene duplication in one species, while orthologs reflect a
vertical event, the speciation in a lineage [36,76]. Thus,
it is crucial to differentiate paralogs from orthologs by
investigating their origins and monophyletic positions in
the tree. We have clearly identified the outparalogs and
inparalogs for both Adh and LEAFY genes. If inparalogs
representing LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 were not identified,
P. calleryana possessing both LFY1int2-a and LFY1int2b as well as LFY2int2-N and LFY2int2-Del2 would be
polyphyletic in both gene trees (Figure 5 and 6) and presumed to be hybrids involving other Pyrus species.

Zheng et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/255

However, P. calleryana is one of the most ancestral species in Pyrus and should not be a hybrid of other Pyrus
species. Additionally, Pyrus ussuriensis, P. × hopeiensis,
P. × phaeocarpa and P. hondoensis containing only
LFY1int2-a fell in the same clade. This shows a close
relationship (Figure 5). However, P. betuleafolia was not
in the clade and only contained LFY1int2-b. These findings were inconsistent with the hypothesis that P. betuleafolia was involved in the origin of P. × hopeiensis and
P. × phaeocarpa and to the phylogeny based on
LFY2int2-N.
Interspecific hybridization has been considered the
major mode of evolution for Pyrus [52], and LCNG has
been useful for testing the hypothesis of hybridization,
since homologs of a nuclear locus from both parents
could be detected in putative hybrids through cloning
[31]. Excluding the possibility of paralogs, incongruence
caused by hybridization and lineage sorting could be differentiated by comparing phylogenies of multiple
unlinked nuclear loci. Only Adh1-1c and LFY2int2-N
are shown to be two independent orthologs, and they
were recovered in all accessions (except LFY2int2-N in
‘Yali’). As described above, relationships revealed by
Adh1-1c were poorly resolved, and most intra-species
and intra-individual sequences were polymorphic. As
shown in Figure 3, intra-individual sequences of P. calleryana, P. hondoensis and P. dimorphophylla were polyphyletic, and the occidental species were not
monophyletic. However, the putative interspecific
hybrids, P. × hopeinensis and P. × phaeocarpa, were
monophyletic, which was incongruent with other gene
trees and our previous understanding of these species.
In contrast, only four accessions were polymorphic in
the LFY2int2-N tree, including P. × phaeocarpa, P. ×
hopeiensis, and ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. × sinkiangensis)
(marked in red in Figure 6), all of which were putative
interspecific hybrids. Therefore, lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphic Adh1-1c alleles may have occurred
during diversification of Pyrus.
The phylogenetic relationships revealed by LFY2int2-N
were mostly congruent to other orthologous gene trees
and previous studies based on other data. Close relationships among P. calleryana, P. dimorphophylla, P. pashia,
P. pyrifolia, and/or P. × serrulata were supported by all
gene trees, suggesting a close relationship among these
species. Two distinct LFY2int2-N sequences of ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangensis) were grouped with occidental
species and P. pyrifolia, respectively (Figure 6). Similar
relationships were found in Adh1-1a, Adh1-1c and
Adh1-2 clades (Figure 3), which supports the hypothesis
that P. sinkiangensis is an interspecific hybrid involving
at least P. communis and P. pyrfolia [11]. Intra-individual copies of P. × hopeiensis and P. × phaeocarpa were
grouped with P. ussuriensis, P. hondoensis or P.

betulaefolia in both the Adh1-1a clade (Figure 3) and
LFY2int2-N (Figure 6) clade. Pyrus × phaeocarpa was a
putative hybrid involving P. betulaefolia and P. ussuriensis, and P. × hopeiensis was a hybrid involving P. ×
phaeocarpa and P. ussuriensis. Pyrus hondoensis, which
was once classified as a variety of P. ussuriensis by morphological data [3], and P. ussuriensis were found to be
closely related [12]. Phylogenetic relationships among
these species were supported by multiple orthologous
gene data, suggesting ancient hybridization rather than
lineage sorting. More wild individuals of these species
are needed to test such complex evolutionary histories.
The relationships based on all separate orthologs were
mostly poorly resolved. In our study, different Adh and
LEAFY paralogs showed a relative low sequence divergence (< 0.03). LFY2int2-N showed the highest proportion of informative sites (38/562, 6.8%, Table 4) which
was similar to results in Neillia and Stephanandra
(7.4%) [39]. Low sequence divergence of multiple DNA
regions suggests rapid radiation during divergence [77]
and this has been hypothesized for many Pyreae taxa
(the former Maloideae taxa) [26,40]. This may also
explain the poor resolution of the gene trees. Another
contribution to the poor resolution in this study is the
conflicting signals caused by recombinants. Recombinants are derived from two homologous chromosomes
in one genome during meiosis (genic recombinants) or
PCR (artifacts), leading to incorrect phylogenetic inferences [78-80]. As predicted by statistical principles, we
found that putative recombinants formed separated
clades. Recombinants represent substitutions of two distinct lineages, and thus receive no bootstrap support
from either of the lineages in a cladistic phylogeny (data
not shown). In this study, most putative recombinants
represent one of the intra-individual polymorphic copies
and were excluded from analyses. The four LFY2int2-N
copies of P. xerophila all displayed the characteristics of
recombinants, and formed separate clades in the tree
(Figure 6). Polymorphic LFY2int2-N copies in P. xerophila may all be ancient genetic recombinants that arose
by interspecific hybridization involving both oriental and
occidental species. More individuals of P. xerophila and
occidental species are necessary to confirm this hypothesis and investigate the origin of this species.
Phylogenetic utility of the introns

Among three Adh1-1 subparalogs, Adh1-1c was orthologous and recovered in all accessions, but it resulted in a
poorly resolved phylogeny due to lack of informative sites
and possible lineage sorting (Table 3). This makes it inadequate for the phylogenic reconstruction of Pyrus. The two
introns of Adh1-2, Adh2-1 and Adh2-2, were not
sequenced and analyzed in the current study, and it is
unknown whether multiple subparalogs also exist for

Zheng et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/255

these paralogs. Adh2-2 might not exist in Pyrus species as
discussed above. The phylogenetic utility of the introns of
Adh2-1 and Adh1-2 needs to be estimated, which will
require primers designed specifically to the paralogs.
LFY1int2 was not suitable for studying interspecific relationships due to sorting of LFY1int2-a and LFY1int2-b
paralogs and the unclear origin of LFY1int2-c. In contrast,
LFY2int2-N showed the highest sequence divergence,
resulting in the best-resolved tree. Inparalogs of LFY2int2Ins8 and LFY2int2-Del2, as well as the LFY2int2-S of
unclear origin, could be easily identified and removed
from phylogenetic inferences. Most importantly, relationships based on LFY2int2-N were congruent to previous
studies based on morphological and molecular marker
data. Conflicting placement of species may be resolved by
using LFY2int2-N. It provides reliable evidence of ancient
hybridization, since incomplete lineage sorting was not
imputed for LFY2int2-N. Phylogenetic studies of Pyrus
based on nuclear gene regions have been rare. Only the
ITS region has been applied to a wide range of East Asian
Pyrus species, but it resulted in a poorly resolved tree [28].
One study based on the 18S gene focused only on two
species, P. pyrifolia and P. communis [81]. We conclude
that LFY2int2-N is currently the most useful nuclear gene
region for phylogenetic inference in Pyrus. It is as yet
unknown whether additional inparalogs representing
LFY2int2 will be found by analyzing more occidental species and individuals of oriental species.

Conclusion
This is the first study that explores LCNGs for phylogenetic analyses in Pyrus. It is also the first to document
the gene structures and transcription of Adh homologs
in the Rosaceae taxa. We demonstrated that frequent
gene duplications contributed to complex outparalogs
and inparalogs of Adh genes with functional diversification or nonfunctionalization. Paralogs, lineage sorting of
alleles, and recombinants are three major problems
when applying LCNGs in plant phylogenetic analyses.
One ortholog of LEAFY, LFY2int2-N, is currently the
best nuclear marker for studying interspecific relationships of Pyrus. Complex reticulate histories likely complicate the phylogenetic reconstruction of some Pyrus
species. To better resolve interspecific relationships and
examine the evolutionary processes of Pyrus, we are
extending our phylogenetic studies with plastid DNA
and nuclear DNA, including LFYint2-N, and by sampling a wider assortment of species and individuals.
Methods
Taxon sampling, DNA extraction, primer design and
amplification

Twenty-five accessions from 13 oriental species and four
occidental species of genus Pyrus were included. Six

Page 15 of 19

accessions of four Malus species were used as outgroups
(Table 1). Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh
leaf tissue using a modified sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) method [12,82].
To date, a complete cDNA sequence representing
Adh1 from ‘Granny Smith’ (M. domestica, Z48234) and
two 5’ partial (beginning at the 3’ end of exon 2) cDNA
sequences representing two distinct Adh loci
(AF031900-Adh1, AF031899-Adh2) from ‘Packham’s
Triumph’ (P. communis) are available. The Adh series
(Adh1 and Adh2) were named randomly and do not
correspond to previously named alleles. A forward primer (Adh-F1) based on sequence of Z48243 and three
downstream primers (Adh1-R1, Adh1-R2 and Adh2-R)
based on AF031900-Adh1 and AF031899-Adh2 were
designed to obtain the entire gene region in several
accessions including P. communis, ‘Flemish Beauty’ (P.
communis), ‘Nanguoli’ (P. ussuriensis), ‘Cuiguan’ (P. pyrifolia), ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangensis), ‘Ralls’ (M. domestica), M. rockii and M. domestica subsp. chinensis.
However, these primer pairs only succeeded in amplifying 12 Adh1 sequences in select accessions. Therefore,
two additional forward primers, Adh1-F2 and Adh2-F,
were designed based on AF031900-Adh1 and
AF031899-Adh2, respectively, targeting a partial Adh
region lacking exon 1 and intron 1. These primers
amplified Adh2 sequences and additional Adh1
sequences. All of the above PCR products were designated as long partial genomic Adh sequences (G-PCR).
Considering labor costs and difficulties in amplifying
and sequencing fragments greater than 2 kb, a smaller
region covering only introns 2 and 3 (about 650 bp) of
Adh1 (reduced Adh1) was used in all accessions to construct a phylogeny.
For LEAFY, a long partial region of LFY1 and LFY2
spanning exon 2 and intron 2 was first amplified in
some accessions using the primer pair ‘LFY-F+LFY-R’
developed in an exonic region of M. domestica ’Pinova’
(DQ535885, DQ535886). After initial sequence analyses,
specific primer pairs of ‘LFY1-F + LFY1-R’ and ‘LFY2-F
+ LFY2-R’ were developed to amplify partial intron 2 of
LFY1 and LFY2 (LFY1int2, LFY2int2), respectively. This
was done independently in all accessions except the
three commercial cultivars (’Cuiguan’, ‘Ralls’, ‘Flemish
Beauty’ and ‘Fuji’). Sequence information for primers
used in this study is listed in Table 2 and their locations
illustrated in Figure 1.
PCR was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50
μL, containing 10-20 ng total DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4
μM of each primer, 5% DMSO (v/v), 0.2 mM dNTP, 2
U Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biotechnology Company Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) and 1 × PCR buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Amplification of the long
partial Adh region was performed for 4 min at 94°C,

Zheng et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/255

followed by 35 cycles of 40 s at 94°C, 40 s at 58°C, 2
min of 20 s at 72°C, and a final extension for 7 min at
72°C. For other shorter regions like locus-specific RTPCR as described below, the PCR procedure was identical, but only 1 min was needed for the extension step.
Cloning and sequencing

PCR products were verified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the target bands were separated and purified using 3S spin DNA Agarose Gel Purification
(Shenergy Biocolor, Shanghai, China). For long partial
genomic Adh amplified by G-PCR, the purified PCR
products were cloned using TA cloning kit Pmd19
(Takara) and more than three clones per sample were
sequenced using M13+, M13- primers and internal primers located at exonic regions (Adh1-F5 for Adh1, and
Adh2-F5 for Adh2, Table 2). For the reduced Adh1
region, five to ten clones per sample were sequenced
using the M13 + primer. For the long partial LEAFY
region, more than three clones were sequenced to
obtain reads representing putative LFY1 and LFY2. For
LFY1int2 and LFY2int2, the purified PCR products were
directly sequenced by amplification primers. Additionally, more than three clones were sequenced to capture
all the copies indicated by direct sequencing results.
Sequence analyses

Intronic and exonic boundaries were determined by
comparison with available cDNA sequences and preservations of the ‘GT’ and ‘AG’ at two ends of introns.
Sequences were aligned with Clustal X [83]. Sequence
divergence within and between different homologs was
calculated using MEGA4 [84] with gaps treated as pairwise deletions. Putative recombinants were detected
using RDP3 software package [54], and some putative
recombinants were identified manually.
Transcription of Adh homologs

The expression patterns of LFY1 and LFY2 have been
well documented in Malus and Pyrus [41], but little was
known about expression patterns of Adh1 and Adh2 in
Pyrus. Therefore, ‘Cuiguan’ (P. pyrifolia), ‘Nanguoli’ (P.
ussuriensis), ‘Korlaxiangli’ (P. sinkiangensis) and ‘Flemish
Beauty’ (P. communis), representing four major pear cultivar groups together with ‘Fuji’ (M. domestica) were
selected to examine transcription of Adh1 and Adh2.
For ‘Cuiguan’ (P. pyrifolia), fresh young leaves, ripe
fruits and seeds were collected in our campus yard for
Adh expression analyses, while for the other accessions,
only ripe fruits were used. The plant tissues were frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was
isolated using a modified CTAB method. First strand
cDNA was synthesized from 1.0 μg of total RNA using
a poly (T)18 as primer and AMV reverse transcriptase

Page 16 of 19

(Bio Basic Inc, New York, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To efficiently detect transcription
of Adh1 and Adh2 independently, two specific primer
pairs ‘spAdh1-F+spAdh1-R’ and ‘spAdh2-F+spAdh2-R’
(Table 2) targeting a shorter region were used for RTPCR and specific genomic PCR (SG-PCR). PCR products were directly sequenced followed by cloning to
identify copies involved in transcription. Actin was analyzed as a reference gene. The primers Pact-F and PactR were designed based on the Actin gene sequences
from P. communis and ‘Yali’ (P. pyrifolia, CWP)
(AB190176, GU830958) (Table 2).
Phylogenetic analyses

The predicted amino acid sequences of long partial Adh
genes in Pyrus and Malus from G-PCR were compared
with those from other well-studied plant taxa by conducting NJ and MP analyses using PAUP 4.0b10 [85].
For reduced Adh1, nucleotide sequences including the
exonic and intronic regions were both included.
LFY1int2 and LFY2int2 were analyzed separately, since
their sequence homology was too low to be aligned. MP
analyses were conducted using PAUP 4.0b10 with gaps
treated as missing data. MP analyses were performed
using a heuristic search with the TBR and Multree
options. To estimate support for the clades, non-parametric bootstraps were estimated with 1000 replicates.
Bayesian analyses were performed with MrBayes 3.1
[86]. The best fitting substitution models for each dataset were determined with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using ModelTest 3.06 [87]. The AIC
favored the HKY+G for the reduced Adh1 and the
K81uf+Gfor both LFY1int2 and LFY2int2. Markov
chains were run for 10,000,000 generations with sample
frequency of 100. The average standard deviation of
split frequency was 0.003 for reduced Adh1, 0.005 for
LFY1int2 and 0.002 for LFY2int2, indicating the runs
have reached convergence for each dataset. The first
25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in. Clade posterior probabilities were calculated from the combined
sets of trees. Both MP and Bayesian analyses resulted in
largely congruent tree topologies. Sequences included in
the final phylogenetic analyses were deposited in GenBank (Accessions GU991401-991522, HM003976004066, HQ912028-HQ912076). Alignments of these
datasets are deposited as additional files 4, 5, 6 and 7.
