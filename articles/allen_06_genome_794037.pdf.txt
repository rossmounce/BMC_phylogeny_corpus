Abstract
Background: The Coccolithoviridae is a recently discovered family of viruses that infect the marine
coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi. Following on from the sequencing of the type strain EhV-86, we
have sequenced a second strain, EhV-163.
Results: We have sequenced approximately 80% of the EhV-163 genome, equating to more than
200 full length CDSs. Conserved and variable CDSs and a gene replacement have been identified
in the EhV-86 and EhV-163 genomes.
Conclusion: The sequencing of EhV-163 has provided a wealth of information which will aid the
re-annotating of the EhV-86 genome and identified a gene insertion in EhV-163.

Background
We recently determined the whole genome sequence of
the Coccolithoviridae strain EhV-86, a giant dsDNA algal
virus from the family Phycodnaviridae that infects the
marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi [1]. Core genes
common to nuclear-cytoplasmic large DNA virus
(NCLDV) genomes were identified and eight of these
genes were used to create a phylogenetic tree in which
EhV-86 was placed at the root of the Phycodnaviridae [2].
Due to the placement of EhV-86 on a branch distinct from
other Phycodnaviridae and the presence of six RNA
polymerase subunits (unique among the Phycodnaviridae)
we suggested this genus would eventually be renamed as
a subfamily of the Phycodnaviridae termed Coccolithovirinae.

English Channel [3,4]. In contrast, EhV-163 was isolated
from the geographically distinct area of Western Norway
during a mesocosm experiment in 2000 [3]. Both virus
genomes were initially estimated to be approximately 410
kbp in size. We have subsequently sequenced the entire
EhV-86 genome and shown it to be 407, 933 base pairs
(bp) [1]. Phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA
polymerase gene has previously shown that EhV-163 is
distinct from all English Channel strains isolated thus far
[3]. In order to gain further insight into both the common
and unique relationship these two viruses have with their
host, Emiliania huxleyi, and their possible placement
within a putative subfamily, we have undertaken to
sequence a second coccolithovirus genome, EhV-163.

Results
Strain EhV-86 was originally isolated, along with many
others, in 1999 from an Emiliania huxleyi bloom in the

The sequencing of EhV-86 was hindered by the highly
repetitive nature of the genome (three different types of

repeat family were identified [5]), which suggested the
elucidation, in a much smaller scaled project, of a second
closely related strain would be difficult. However, by
using a random shotgun approach at first, followed by a
second directed approach to fill in missing sequence
based on an EhV-86 backbone, we have managed to
sequence approximately 322 kbp of the EhV-163 genome
in 267 contigs, equating to around 80% of the estimated
genome size. This has provided enough genetic information to perform an analysis of the two coccolithovirus
genomes. Of the 472 CDSs predicted in the EhV-86
genome [1], from the EhV-163 contigs, full sequence was
obtained for 202 CDSs and partial sequence was obtained
for a further 182 CDSs. Contigs from EhV-163 were typically between 95–100% identical to EhV-86 sequence
(Additional file 1). Regardless of contig size and content
(intergenic or genic), EhV-163 contigs aligned with perfect

colinearity (except in one case, discussed below) to the
EhV-86 genome sequence.
Highly conserved CDSs
Of the 202 CDSs that had complete sequence, 20 were
identical at DNA level and a further 17 were identical at
the amino acid level (Additional file 1). These 37 conserved CDSs are distributed throughout the genome; however there are some that appear to be clustered together in
4 regions. CDSs ehv027 (unknown function), ehv028
(putative ligase) and ehv029 (putative membrane protein); ehv135 (putative membrane protein) and ehv136
(unknown function); ehv165 (putative membrane protein), ehv166 (putative RING finger containing protein),
ehv167 (RNA polymerase subunit 10) and ehv168 (putative membrane protein); and ehv260 (unknown function), ehv261 (unknown function) and ehv263

(unknown function) are found in these four clusters. The
high degree of conservation among these 37 CDSs implies
they are under high selection pressure or were recently
acquired by the last common ancestor of EhV-86 and EhV163. Since it has been shown previously that RNA
polymerase was present in the ancestral NCLDV prior to
the divergence of the Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Asfariviridae,
Phycodnaviridae and Mimiviridae families, it is likely that
for ehv167, at least, the high degree of conservation is due
to a high selection pressure [2,5,6]. This also implies that
RNA polymerase function is crucial to the infection strategy of coccolithoviruses, providing further evidence for a
life style distinct from the other previously sequenced Phycodnaviridae (PBCV-1 and ESV-1).
Gene replacement
No sequence was obtained for 88 of the 472 CDSs predicted to be encoded in the EhV-86 genome. The similar
size of the EhV-163 genome in comparison with that of
EhV-86 and the high levels of similarity in other regions
suggests that the majority of these CDSs are likely to be
present. Indeed, a hybridisation of EhV-163 genomic
DNA to the EhV-86 based coccolithovirus microarray has
revealed that of the 425 EhV-86 CDSs probed for, only 28
appear to be absent in EhV-163 (unpublished data). However, one notable gene deletion in EhV-163 is a putative
phosphate permease found at approximately 115 kb on
the EhV-86 genome (See Figure 1). This region was
sequenced in a 6.9 kbp contig from EhV-163 that contained the full sequence of ehv115, ehv116, ehv118,

ehv119, ehv120, ehv121, ehv122 and ehv123. The 1.6 kb
phosphate permease gene, known as ehv117, is absent
from this contig in EhV-163. This CDS gave no hybridisation signal in the microarray genomic analysis and all
attempts to amplify ehv117 by PCR from EhV-163 gDNA
have failed (unpublished data). In place of ehv117 in
EhV-163 is a 600 bp region that contains a 75 bp 3' remnant of ehv117 and a 435 bp putative CDS that appears to
encode a 144 amino acid protein which contains a HNH
signature domain, characteristic of a homing endonuclease. The functional relevance of this intriguing gene
replacement is yet to be determined and warrants further
investigation.
Variation in CDSs
The majority of EhV-163 CDSs are predicted to start and
stop at the same locations as their EhV-86 counterparts.
Variation occurs at the DNA and amino acid level but generally the overall length and structure of the genes is very
similar. However, there are some differences between the
CDSs in the two strains. Changes in DNA sequence can
take a variety of forms: point mutations which may or
may not lead to the introduction/disruption of the start/
stop codon, in-frame insertions/deletions, and insertions/
deletions leading to truncated/extended proteins. Examples of all these types of changes can be found when comparing the sequence from the genomes of EhV-86 and
EhV-163 (Table 1). The majority of coding inserts and
deletions are kept in frame (i.e. occur in multiples of 3
bp). These changes lead to changes in protein structure

which could account for different phenotypes (such as
host range) to be shown by EhV-163 and EhV-86 [3].
When annotating a genome it is often necessary to predict
where the start of translation codons are. The advantage in
having two related genomes is that you can re-check your
annotation. This is particularly important in the coccolithoviruses since the majority of CDSs have no database
homologues making gene prediction difficult. The vast
majority of CDSs in EhV-86 appear to be very similar to
their EhV-163 equivalents. However, there are some CDSs
that appear to need re-annotating in the light of the
sequence data from EhV-163 (Table 1, Additional file 1).
For example, although the overlapping of CDSs is common is some virus genomes [7], this is not a common
occurrence in the EhV-86 genome. However, an overlap of
CDSs occurs in EhV-86 with ehv380 and ehv381. This
overlap does not occur in EhV-163, due to a change in the
predicted start of translation methionine codon (ATG to
ATA) and a 1 bp deletion that would otherwise cause a
frameshift. It therefore appears likely that, in EhV-163 at
least, the start of translation occurs from the ATG that is
present 36 bp downstream of current predicted ATG start
codon of ehv381 in EhV-86.
There appears to be a high degree of variation in ehv142
between the two strains. The CDS has approximately 86.9
% identity at the nucleotide level (183 of the 1398 nucleotides are different) and 79.1% identity at the amino acid
level (97 of the 465 amino acids are different) (Figure 2).
Most of the variation occurs in the 5' region of the CDS.
BLASTP and PSI-BLAST searches reveal no significant
matches. However, PSI-BLAST searches reveal strong
matches for KELCH-like proteins (e-50) after only two
rounds for the EhV-163 version of ehv142. PSI-BLAST
searches using the corresponding EhV-86 CDS reveal no
matches for KELCH-like proteins, suggesting ehv142 may
play a different role in each virus strain. Both EhV-86 and
EhV-163 are capable of infecting many of the same strains
(with varying virulence) [3]. However, there are many
strains of E. huxleyi that are susceptible to infection by
only one or other of the viruses (unpublished data).
Intriguingly, KELCH-like proteins have been identified in
poxviruses and are found to be highly variable [8-10].
Indeed, variation in the KELCH-like proteins of poxviruses has been shown to account for variation in virulence, host range and reproduction [8,9].

Conclusion
EhV-86 and EhV-163 belong to a unique family of algal
viruses whose genomes contain a high proportion of
genes of unknown function. The sequencing of EhV-163
has provided a wealth of information which will aid the
re-annotating of parts of the EhV-86 genome and identi-

fied an intriguing gene replacement and a highly divergent CDS in the two genomes. Furthermore, the discovery
of highly conserved non-core genes of unknown function
in these strains suggests their importance to these viruses,
adding further credence to the hypothesis that the Coccolithovirus genus has lifestyle distinct from other members
of the Phycodnaviridae.

Methods
Preparation of EhV-163 concentrate
Six 1L cultures of exponentially growing E. huxleyi
CCMP1516, at a cell concentration of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml,
were each inoculated with 1 ml of EhV-163 (~2 × 105 pfu/
ml). Growth was monitored by cell counts in a Reichert
haemocytometer under a light microscope. Four days
post-inoculation, the decimated cultures were subjected
to a filtration, concentration and purification regime
[3,11].
Virus DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from CsCl-purified EhV-163 by initially treating the sample with proteinase K (5 mg/ml) in
a lysis buffer containing 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and 0.5%
SDS (w/v) at 65°C for 1 h. 0.1 × volume aliquots of phenol were added to the samples, after which the DNA was
extracted with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:1). The DNA was precipitated with the addition of 0.5 × volume 7.5 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.5
and 2.5 × volume absolute ethanol. Virus DNA was stored
in molecular grade water (Sigma) prior to genome
sequencing.
Genome sequencing
Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication, ligated into
pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers. After 2700 reads, the sequence
was assembled into contigs and analysed using SeqMan
(DNAstar). Following alignment to the backbone of EhV86, 229 primer pairs were designed, specific to the EhV163 gDNA sequence, to attempt to amplify the missing
gaps. The sequence, annealing temperature and genomic
location (in relation to EhV-86) of the primers designed
can be found in the NERC environmental genomic data
catalogue at http://envgen.nox.ac.uk under EnvBase accession number egcat:00010. When a PCR product was
obtained, it was sequenced directly using both primers
and the resulting sequence added to the contig library.
The depth of sequence coverage varied across the genome
due to the random nature of the initial sequencing strategy. Depth of coverage varied from just one sequence read
for some regions to up to18 for others, with an average
coverage of approximately 3. In areas of low coverage,
sequence reads containing ambiguous results were
removed from the analysis. 267 contigs were generated,
covering approximately 80% of the EhV-163 genome.

These contigs have been submitted to Genbank under the
accession numbers DQ127552-DQ127818. This data is
also available from http://envgen.nox.ac.uk, EnvBase
accession number egcat:00010.
Genomic analysis
The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds
regions of local similarity between sequences by comparing nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases
and calculating the statistical significance of matches. Protein-protein BLAST (BLAST-P) and Position-specific iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) were performed on CDSs of
interest online at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.

the EhV-163 contigs against the EhV-86 genome.
