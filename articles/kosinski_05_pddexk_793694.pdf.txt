Abstract
Background: The PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily, initially identified in type II restriction
endonucleases and later in many enzymes involved in DNA recombination and repair, is one of the
most challenging targets for protein sequence analysis and structure prediction. Typically, the
sequence similarity between these proteins is so low, that most of the relationships between
known members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily were identified only after the corresponding
structures were determined experimentally. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that among the
uncharacterized protein families, there are potential nucleases that remain to be discovered, but
their identification requires more sensitive tools than traditional PSI-BLAST searches.
Results: The low degree of amino acid conservation hampers the possibility of identification of
new members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily based solely on sequence comparisons to known
members. Therefore, we used a recently developed method HHsearch for sensitive detection of
remote similarities between protein families represented as profile Hidden Markov Models
enhanced by secondary structure. We carried out a comparison of known families of PD-(D/E)XK
nucleases to the database comprising the COG and PFAM profiles corresponding to both
functionally characterized as well as uncharacterized protein families to detect significant
similarities. The initial candidates for new nucleases were subsequently verified by sequencestructure threading, comparative modeling, and identification of potential active site residues.
Conclusion: In this article, we report identification of the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease domain in
numerous proteins implicated in interactions with DNA but with unknown structure and
mechanism of action (such as putative recombinase RmuC, DNA competence factor CoiA, a DNAbinding protein SfsA, a large human protein predicted to be a DNA repair enzyme, predicted
archaeal transcription regulators, and the head completion protein of phage T4) and in proteins for
which no function was assigned to date (such as YhcG, various phage proteins, novel candidates for
restriction enzymes). Our results contributes to the reduction of "white spaces" on the sequencestructure-function map of the protein universe and will help to jump-start the experimental
characterization of new nucleases, of which many may be of importance for the complete
understanding of mechanisms that govern the evolution and stability of the genome.

Background
The PD-(D/E)XK superfamily of Mg2+-dependent nucleases groups together protein domains initially identified
in structurally characterized type II restriction enzymes
(REases) (reviews: [1,2]) and later found in diverse
enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination, including phage λ exonuclease [3], bacterial
enzymes exerting ssDNA nicking in the context of methyldirected and very-short-patch DNA repair: MutH [4] and
Vsr [5], Tn7 transposase TnsA [6], archaeal Holliday junction resolvases (AHJRs) Hjc/Hje [7-9], phage T7 endonuclease I [10], the XPF/Rad1/Mus81 family of nucleases
that cleaves branched structures generated during DNA
repair, replication, and recombination [11], and RecB
nuclease [12].
All members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily share a common structural core, comprising a mixed β-sheet of 4
strands flanked on both sides by α-helices [1,2,13](Figure
1). It serves as a scaffold for a weakly conserved active site,
typically including two or three acidic residues (Asp or
Glu) and one Lys residue, which together form the hallmark bipartite catalytic motif (P)D...Xn.(D/E)X K (where
X is any amino acid). It was found that some members of
the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily developed different variants
of the active site, in which the acidic residues or the lysine
have been replaced by Asn or Gln (Lys can be also
replaced by an acidic side chain) [14-16], or in which their
side-chains have "migrated" to another region of the
polypeptide in a way that only the spatial orientation of
functional groups in the active site is maintained, but their
sequence is not conserved [17-21] (Figure 1). This variability makes it difficult to identify the active site in PD-(D/
E)XK nucleases solely based on sequence comparisons
and usually requires analysis of the three-dimensional
structures (e.g. obtained by comparative modeling techniques). It should be mentioned that the mechanistic/catalytic role of the active site sidechains is not fully
elucidated even in the well-characterized members with
known structure. Moreover, many of PD-(D/E)XK nucleases contain elaborations of the common fold in the form
of large insertions and terminal extensions that form additional subdomains, usually involved in oligomerization
or DNA-binding. These regions often contain regular elements of secondary structure and sometimes constitute
the majority of the protein, making the detection of the
true core a challenging task for protein structure prediction methods (reviews: [2,22]).
We have previously used the comparisons of sequence
profiles to detect novel members of the PD-(D/E)XK
superfamily [16,18,19,23-25], as well as applied the
sequence-structure threading to map the sequences of
REases onto the crystal structures of known members
[21,26-28]. However, both approaches have shortcom-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

ings: the profile-profile analysis is unable to find very
remote relationships when families include only a few
members (as is often the case in the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily) or if the compared proteins contain large unrelated insertions, and the threading analysis works only if
an experimentally solved structure is available for one of
the potential homologs. Therefore, we decided to use an
intermediate approach, in which the compared sequence
profiles are combined with the structural information,
which can be obtained either from the crystal structure (if
it is available for one of the members of the considered
families) or predicted by bioinformatics methods, thereby
allowing protein fold recognition without the explicit reference to an experimentally solved protein structure. We
used the recently developed method HHsearch that
allows comparison of sequence alignments together with
secondary structures represented as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [29] to compare the library of PD-(D/E)XK
nuclease families obtained previously [23] with the set of
domains in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG
and KOG)[30] and PFAM [31] databases. Our aim was to
identify the previously unknown PD-(D/E)XK domains in
families of proteins that are either completely uncharacterized, or whose function is known (or predicted), but
the structure and phylogenetic relationships are unclear.

Results
Identification of new candidate PD-(D/E)XK nucleases
with profile HHM searches
In order to carry out a systematic search for new PD-(D/
E)XK nucleases, we prepared a set of multiple sequence
alignments corresponding to previously identified families [18,23,32](see Methods). For each family we generated a profile HMM that included the sequences and
predicted secondary structure (see Methods). These profile HMMs were compared with HHsearch [29] to a database of profile HMMs corresponding to multiple
sequence alignments obtained from the COG, KOG, and
PFAM databases, also with predicted secondary structures
(see Methods for details). It is noteworthy, that searches
initiated with most of the known PD-(D/E)XK nucleases
in the query dataset identified families containing
sequences of other known PD-(D/E)XK nucleases, thereby
validating our approach and providing useful threshold
values for confident identification of true members of PD(D/E)XK superfamily. For instance, AtF16A14.4 profile
detected herpesvirus alkaline exonuclease (pfam01771)
with the e-value of 10-3, Pfu-HJR detected Mrr with the evalue of 10-2, YcjD detected Vsr with the e-value of 10-5,
etc. It must be noted, that some of the "best hits" to true
positives exhibited poor scores, e.g. Mrr detected HJR
(pfam01870) with the e-value of 1.2. As expected, our
HHM-HHM comparisons revealed also numerous other
potential homologs, not included in the query dataset.
Based on these results, we generated a preliminary list of

candidate new PD-(D/E)XK subfamilies. For further analysis, we retained only such proteins, which have not been
reported as members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily in
earlier analyses carried out by ourselves or other groups
(e.g. [32]).
The preliminary candidates for novel PD-(D/E)XK nucleases were initially validated by reciprocal HHsearches
against the database comprising both the initial query
profile HMMs as well as all the other COG, KOG, and
PFAM profile HMMs. This search confirmed that for most

of the candidate families, the closest homologs are either
among the bona fide PD-(D/E)XK enzymes or among
other preliminary candidates. It also revealed additional
families, which were similar to the first set of candidates,
but not to the original PD-(D/E)XK queries, suggesting
that they may be more remote members of the superfamily. In reciprocal searches, a limited number of profile
HMMs showed significant relationship to other families,
unrelated to PD-(D/E)XK enzymes – such candidates were
regarded as false positives and were not further analyzed.
Further, each candidate family was analyzed by fold-rec-

some other, unrelated structure appeared to be a better

built for the parts of the sequence aligned to the template

Discussion
COG1322/pfam02646 (RmuC family)
COG1322/pfam02646 is represented by the RmuC protein from Escherichia coli, which has been implicated in
limiting inversions at short-inverted repeats [33]. It has
been speculated that RmuC exhibits "limited homology"
to human Rad50 protein, centrosome protein pericentrin,
nuclear mitotic apparatus proteins and the SbcC proteins,
and therefore it may be a structural protein that protects
DNA against nuclease action or be itself involved in DNA
cleavage at the regions of DNA secondary structure [33].
Our secondary structure predictions revealed that RmuC
contains an N-terminal transmembrane helix (aa 1–25),

coiled-coil structures (aa 25–200 and ~350–420), a globular α/β domain (aa 200–360), and a disordered C-terminus (aa 420–475). The profile HMM analysis confidently
identified a relationship of the central globular α/β
domain of RmuC and its homologs to the catalytic
domain of the McrC nuclease [23,34](P-value 10-4). This
prediction was also confirmed by the fold-recognition
analysis, which identified the catalytic domain of REase
FokI as the best modeling template, albeit with relatively
low scores (mGenTHREADER: 0.4666, SAM-T02: 0.23).
Analysis of the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 2)
reveals that proteins from the RmuC/COG1322/
pfam02646 family exhibit a hallmark PD-(D/E)XK motif
associated with the characteristic pattern of predicted secondary structures, which strongly suggests that RmuC is a
nuclease that may cleave DNA structures arising during
the recombination of short-inverted repeats and thereby
thwart the inversion of the internal sequence. We suspect
that the initial predictions of homology between RmuC
and proteins involved in the structural maintenance of
chromosome (Rad50 and SbcC) [33] was due to a spurious similarity in the regions of low sequence complexity,
e.g. coiled coils.
COG4469/pfam06054 (CoiA family)
COG4469/pfam06054 is represented by the CoiA protein
from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has been implicated
in the DNA uptake process and recombination, but without any clues as to the molecular mechanism of its action
[35]. The profile HMM analysis identified a relationship
(P-value 10-2) between the central region of CoiA (aa 56–
209) and COG4636, a family of predicted nucleases
abundant in Cyanobacteria [21]. This prediction was also
confirmed by the fold-recognition analysis, which aligned
this domain to the recently solved structure of the
COG4636 member (Structural Genomics target Tt1808
from Thermus thermophilus Hb8, 1wdj in the PDB,
annotated as "to be published") (top matches in FFAS,
score -11.0, and mGenTHREADER, score 0.369) and the
structure of the Hef nuclease [11](1j22 in the PDB,
INBGU top match, score 8.38), which both belong to the
PD-(D/E)XK superfamily. While the template structures
exhibit unorthodox configurations of catalytic residues
(migration of the Lys residue in COG4636 members and
topological crossover and migration of the Glu residue in
Hef and its homologs), members of the CoiA/COG4469/
pfam06054 family exhibit a more typical PD-EXQ variant
of the active site, which has been observed in REase BglII
[15]. Additionally, CoiA and its homologs possess a conserved Arg residue at the same position as the swapped Lys
residue in COG4636. It will be interesting to determine if
this residue is involved in substrate binding or catalysis.
We hypothesize that in competent pneumococcus cells,
the CoiA nuclease degrades one strand of the doublestranded DNA, while the other strand is imported inside

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

the cell. Alternatively, CoiA may be involved in the incorporation of the foreign DNA into the chromosome, but
this process is more likely to be carried out by the general
homologous recombination machinery, such as RecA.
COG1489/pfam03749 (SfsA family)
COG1489/pfam03749 is represented by the SfsA protein
from E. coli, which has been implicated in sugar fermentation stimulation by the so far unknown mechanism and
was shown to non-specifically bind to DNA [36]. The profile HMM analysis confidently identified a relationship
(P-value 10-5) between the C-terminal domain of SfsA (aa
80–234) and the YraN family of previously predicted
endonucleases [23]. This finding was confirmed by the
fold-recognition analysis, which confidently identified
the Vsr nuclease, a member of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily (1vsr and 1cw0 in the PDB [37]) as the best template for the sequence of the SfsA C-terminal domain
(scores: INBGU: 17.65, mGenTHREADER: 0.428,
FUGUE: 3.4). Interestingly, while the Vsr nuclease exhibits a highly unorthodox active site, with the (D/E)XK halfmotif replaced by FXH, SfsA and its homologs (including
the YraN family) exhibit a typical version of the nuclease
catalytic motif, ID-EVK. The fold-recognition analysis
revealed also that the N-terminal domain of SfsA (aa 1–
80) is a member of the OB-fold superfamily of nucleic
acid binding proteins [38]. Thus, both domains of SfsA
are likely to be involved in DNA binding, while the C-terminal domain is likely to possess an unforeseen nuclease
activity. It will be interesting to determine whether the Nterminal or C-terminal domains or both are important for
the activity of sugar fermentation stimulation and how
does this activity relate to the predicted nuclease function.
Or perhaps SfsA could be a hydrolase involved in another
type of reaction than its homologs from the PD-(D/E)XK
superfamily? Deletion mutagenesis based on our prediction and site-directed mutagenesis of the PD-(D/E)XK
active site may help to address these questions.
KOG2143 (KIA001018 family)
KOG2143 groups together 4 large (>1000 aa) eukaryotic
proteins, including the KIA001018 protein from H.
sapiens (PMID: 10231032), which has been annotated as
a DNA binding protein engaged in DNA repair, probably
due to a presence of an easily identified Rad18-like CCHC
zinc finger in the N-terminus [39]. However, no suggestions concerning the mechanism of its action have been
made. PSI-BLAST searches revealed that KOG2143 has
homologs in other Eukaryota (plants and fungi) as well as
in several bacteria (shorter versions, about 550 aa). The Cterminal domain (aa 935–1016 in KIA001018) shows significant similarity to HJR families (HHsearch P-values
ranging from 10-3 to 10-5) and exhibits the orthodox version of the PD-(D/E)XK motif, perfectly conserved in all
members of KOG2143 as well as in their prokaryotic rela-

tives. The fold-recognition analysis identified AHJR (1gef)
as one of the possible templates, but with low confidence
(mGenTHREADER, score 0.406). The analysis of predicted secondary structures and the preliminary tertiary
model of KIA001018 suggest that the putative nuclease
domain in KOG2143 and related proteins corresponds to
the minimal core of the PD-(D/E)XK fold, i.e. only 4 βstrands and 2 α-helices [40] (Figure 1). Combination of
reciprocal HHsearches and fold-recognition carried out
for the remaining part of the KIA001018 sequence
revealed that KOG2143 members possess a long (300–
400 aa) α-helical domain, most probably comprising 5–7
tetratricopeptide-like repeats (TPRs), an unknown
domain (~300 aa) with no clear relationship to any protein families and no confident prediction from FR, and
the afore-mentioned Rad18-like CCHC zinc finger. The
unknown domain and the zinc finger are missing from
the shorter prokaryotic members. Such composition of
domains suggests that KIA001018 is a DNA binding protein with endonuclease activity, possibly engaged in DNA
repair, with a potential to bind other proteins via TPR
domains. The analysis of genomic neighborhood did not
reveal any obvious associations with other conserved proteins, which could shed more light on the possible function of KIA001018 and its homologs.
COG4804/pfam06250 (YhcG family)
COG4804/pfam06250 is represented by the uncharacterized and functionally not annotated protein YhcG from E.
coli, whose homologs can be found in Prokaryota –
mostly in Bacteria, but also in Archaea (a few homologs
are found in Methanosarcinales) and bacteriophages. The
profile HMM analysis confidently identified a relationship (P-value 10-4) between the C-terminal domain of
YhcG (aa 235–375) and pfam01939 (DUF91)/COG1637,
a family of predicted RecB-like nucleases [32]. Both YhcG
and DUF91 families exhibit the same orthodox endonuclease motif: E-D-E(I/L/V)K. Nonetheless, our profile
HMM analysis indicates that the endonuclease domain of
DUF91 is more similar to YraN-like HJRs rather than to
the RecB-like nucleases (P-values 10-6 for YraN and 10-4
for DUF91). This is also confirmed by the fold-recognition analysis for YhcG, which indicates the AHJR structures 1hh1 and 1gef/1ipi as possible templates, however
with low scores (INBGU: 1gef, score: 7.7; 1hh1, score:
6.08; FUGUE: 1ipi, score: 2.97; 3DPSSM: 1hh1, score:
7.7). COG4804/pfam06250 members possess an additional N-terminal domain (~200 aa), predicted to be
mainly α-helical, but lacking any confident matches to
known structures, according to fold-recognition servers.
The analysis of genomic neighborhood did not reveal any
obvious associations of the yhcG family with conserved
genes. In Rickettsiae 5 YhcG paralogs could be found in
two gene clusters. Only in Methanosarcina acetivorans an
YhcG homolog was found associated with a type I restric-

tion-modification gene cluster, also with another predicted PD-(D/E)XK superfamily member from COG3586
(a putative endonuclease family, whose members were
previously identified [32])
Pfam06356 (φH_25 family)
Pfam06356 (DUF1064) groups together functionally
uncharacterized and not annotated proteins from tailed
bacteriophages and bacteria (Proteobacteria and Firmicutes), and is represented by the hypothetical product
encoded by ORF25 from S. aureus phage φH. The profile
HMM analysis identified this family as a relative (P-value
from 10-3 to 10-5) of YcjD-like proteins – putative members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily identified previously
[23]. The fold-recognition analysis identified TnsA (1f1z)
as one of the possible structural templates (mGenTHREADER: score: 0.302, FUGUE: score: 2.56). The structure of phage T7 Endonuclease I, 1fzr, had slightly better
FR scores, but exhibited numerous insertions and deletions in the alignment. Nonetheless, proteins from
pfam06356 exhibit a more typical version of the catalytic
motif, namely AD-DXK (more similar to T7 Endo I than
to TnsA). PSI-BLAST searches using pfam06356 members
as queries revealed also a low similarity to the PD-(D/
E)XK domain in the Res subunit of Type III restrictionmodification systems [41] (alignment only in the endonuclease core region with sequence identity 20% and
lower) and to COG3372/pfam5626 (DUF790), an
uncharacterized family predicted to belong to the PD-(D/
E)XK superfamily in this work, see below. The genomic
analysis reveals that pfam06356 members are typically
found only in phage genomes or in prophages in bacterial
genomes, however, without any strongly conserved neighbors. In only one case, S. aureus subsp. aureus COL
prophage L54a, the gene coding a putative DNA:m6 A
MTase (M.SauCOLORF346P according to the REBASE
nomenclature [42]) was found in a putative operon with
a pfam06356 member – hypothetical protein
SACOL0347, suggesting that together they may form a
novel RM system. We speculate that most members of this
family may serve a purpose similar to that of phylogenetically unrelated Endonuclease II of phage T4, namely the
degradation of the host DNA upon lytic infection as well
as production of recombinogenic fragments [43]

COG5482 includes a few functionally uncharacterized
and not annotated proteins (~230 aa) mainly from Proteobacteria (only two homologs were found in species
from other taxa: Clostridium acetobutylicum and Symbiobacterium thermophilum). The profile HMM analysis suggested
that they are remotely related to AHJRs (P-value ~10-3).
The fold-recognition analysis has also identified the AHJR
structures (1gef/1ipi and 1hh1) as the best templates for
modeling of COG5482 sequences, with very good agree-

ment of alignments reported by different servers despite
moderate scores (mGenTHREADER: 1hh1, score: 0.543;
1gef, score: 0.413; FUGUE: 1hh1, score: 3.23; 1ipi, score:
3.89; 3DPSSM: 1hh1, score: 3.5; SAM: 1gef/1ipi, scores:
0.17 (0.41). The catalytic domain exhibits the consensus
motif: E-CD-ELK. Interestingly, the C-terminal 100 aa was
predicted to form a separate domain of the winged helixturn-helix (wHTH) fold, typically involved in DNA binding [44], which may therefore dictate the target specificity
of this putative nuclease. The precise role of these proteins
remains to be determined experimentally.
Pfam06190 (gp51 family)
Pfam06190 (DUF944) groups together very small (~100),
functionally uncharacterized and not annotated proteins,
exemplified by the gp51 protein from the Listeria monocytogenes phage PSA. Homologs of this protein can be found
mainly in other phages and in a few bacteria from different taxa, frequently within putative prophages. The profile
HMM comparison revealed a remote relationship of
Pfam06190 members to AHJRs (P-value ~10-4), while
sequence analysis revealed an orthodox version of the catalytic motif, (P/S/C)D-EXK. All fold-recognition servers
identified PD-(D/E)XK enzymes as the best templates
with high scores (e.g. AHJRs (1hh1, 1gef) identified by
INBGU, score 25.16, RecU/PrfA recombinase (1y1o,
1rzn) identified by FFAS, score -10.8). Structure prediction suggests that the members of the gp51 family exhibit
a minimal form of the central β-sheet, with only four
strands, flanked by three α-helices. However, they seem to
possess an additional β-hairpin similar to the element,
which in RecU forms a dimerization interface (our
unpublished analysis of the 1y1o structure). Interestingly,
the analysis of genomic neighborhood reveals that gp51
and its homologs are frequently associated with primases
or helicases, which suggests they may be involved in DNA
replication. We predict that gp51 and its relatives are
recombinases involved in resolution of branched
intermediates of phage DNA undergoing replication and/
or recombination, similarly to T7 endonuclease I.
COG1395 (PAB2104 family)
COG1395 groups together archaeal sequences of functionally uncharacterized proteins represented by the
PAB2104 protein from Pyrococcus abyssi, annotated as
putative transcription regulators. As might have been
expected based on the database annotation, the profile
HMM analysis identified with high confidence (P-value
~10-10) the helix-turn-helix motif (similar to that one
from HTH_3 (Xre) family like proteins: pfam01381,
smart00530, cd00093) in the central part of the
COG1395 sequences. However, using HHsearch we
found that the N – terminal domain is related to the family of AHJRs (pfam01870) (P-value ~10-6). The fold-recognition analysis confidently confirmed AHJR (1gef) as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

best template for modeling of the N-terminal domain.
Preliminary modeling of the N-terminal domain (data
not shown) suggests that in PAB2104 and its homologs
the catalytic D/E residue from the orthodox (D/E)XK halfmotif migrated to the α-helix following the β-strand in
which that half-motif was transformed into the "K(I/V)L"
form. Interestingly, the profile HMM analysis predicted
that the C-terminal domain in COG1395 members may
be homologous to the PD-(D/E)XK nucleases as well. This
prediction was also supported by the fold recognition
analysis, which found AHJR 1hh1 (scores: FFAS: -6.66,
INBGU: 13.34, mGenTHREADER: 0.447, SPARKS: -1.74,
FUGUE: 4.33, 3DPSSM: 0.061) as the potentially best
template structure. However, despite the apparent structural conservation and the presence of hydrophobic
residues that confer protein stability, the typical active site
is not conserved in this domain (Figure 2). This suggests
that the C-terminal domain was generated by intragenic
duplication (or fusion of the N-terminal module with a
PD-(D/E)XK domain from another source) and then
underwent degeneration. Variants of the PD-(D/E)XK
domains that lost the active site but presumably retained
the ability to bind nucleic acids have been already
described (review: [2]).
Thus, COG1395 represents a new family of archaeal putative nucleases with a novel domain architecture: PD-(D/
E)XK-HTH-(inactivated)PD-(D/E)XK. It is noteworthy
that a related architecture, namely wHTH-PD-(D/E)XK,
was observed in the Type IIE REase NaeI, in which the PD(D/E)XK domain and the wHTH domain, despite the
unrelated folds, bind two copies of the same sequence,
but only the copy bound to the nuclease domain is
cleaved [45]. A PD-(D/E)XK-wHTH fusion (albeit with a
reversed order of domains) was also observed in the TnsA
transposase [6]. On the other hand, a variant of a tandemly duplicated PD-(D/E)XK domain with a degenerated C-terminal repeat was found in the Sau3AI enzyme
[46,47], another Type IIE REase, which also binds as a
dimer two copies of the same sequence, but cleaves only
the one bound to the pair of "active" N-terminal domains.
Tandemly duplicated PD-(D/E)XK domains have been
also found in Type IIS restriction enzymes that act as monomers, bind only one asymmetrical DNA target, and use
different domains for the cleavage of each strand of the
substrate (JMB, JK, and Arvydas Lubys, unpublished data).
It will be interesting to study the mode of action of
COG1395 members, i.e. whether they act as monomers
and dimers, how many copies of the target sequence they
bind and whether they act similarly to Type IIE enzymes
(like NaeI or Sau3AI) or as nickases, which cleave only
one strand of the substrate using the C-terminal active
domain.

COG4127
COG4127 groups together 4 uncharacterized proteins, of
which only one, STM4490 from S. typhimurium, has been
annotated as a predicted restriction endonuclease. PSIBLAST searches revealed that COG4127 members have
numerous homologs in the non-redundant database and
are related (E-value ~ 10-10) to the Mrr family of REases
[18]. The relationship between the "extended" COG4127
family and the Mrr family was confirmed by the profile
HMM analysis (P-value ~10-14). The fold-recognition
analysis identified AHJRs (FFAS: 1hh1, score: -13.5; 1gef/
1ipi, score: -7.58; 3DPSSM: 1hh1, score: 3.4; SAM-T02:
1gef/1ipi, score: 0.54) as the best templates for modeling
of the C-terminal part of the protein, but failed to suggest
a good structural match for the N-terminal domain of a
similar size. It is noteworthy that some members of
COG4127 contain only the N-terminal domain, but
either lack the C-terminal Mrr-like domain or possess
another, apparently unrelated domain. Analysis of
sequence conservation and predicted secondary structures
suggested that the N-terminal domain also resembles the
PD-(D/E)XK nucleases, but without the hallmark active
site, e.g. like in the afore-mentioned COG1395. However,
we were unable to confirm the relationship of the N-terminal domain of COG4127 to known PD-(D/E)XK nucleases either by fold-recognition or by HHsearches. Thus,
the structure and function of the N-terminal domain
remains to be determined experimentally; the availability
of members of COG4127 that already lack the C-terminal
domain may be particularly useful.

Interestingly, analyses of genomic context revealed that a
few members of COG4127 are associated with putative
Type I RM systems (R/S/M.CcrMORF620P in Caulobacter
crescentus,
R/S/M.XorKORF3462P
and
R/S/
M.XorKORF3457P in Xanthomonas oryzae and a putative
type I RM system in Methylobacillus flagellatus not yet
included in REBASE) or with a Type III RM system (R/
M.DetORF1112P in Dehalococcoides
ethenogenes).
Additionally, another gene cluster from D. ethenogenes
contains two representatives of COG4127 (one of them
contains only the N-terminal domain) and a member of
the SfsA family (predicted to be a nuclease in this work).
Another COG4127 member from Azotobacter vinelandii
was found in the neighborhood of the putative Mod subunit and a putative protein annotated as a "virulence protein" (COG3943).
COG4741
COG4741 consists of functionally uncharacterized proteins mostly from Archaea, of which only one, the hypothetical product of the locus TVN1166 from T. volcanium
is annotated as "a predicted secreted endonuclease distantly related to AHJRs". The profile HMM analysis confidently (P-value ~10-5) identified the relationship of this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

family to the YraN subfamily of PD-(D/E)XK enzymes
[23]. The predicted nuclease domain encompasses 120 Cterminal residues and corresponds to the absolutely minimal core, with only 4 β-strands and 2 α-helices that serve
as a scaffold for a well-conserved E-(V/I)D-E(V/I)K motif.
The N-terminus reveals a strongly hydrophobic stretch of
residues predicted to form a transmembrane helix, which
could be either used as a leader peptide to guide the translocation of the nuclease domains through the membrane
or it could anchor it to the membrane. Programs for the
prediction of transmembrane protein topology HMMTOP
[48], TMAP [49], and TMPRED [50] predicted that the
nuclease domain has a cytosolic orientation. We speculate
that COG4741 members could be released to the environment as toxic agents against other cells, like endonuclease
colicins (review: [51]), or be used to guard the cell against
the uptake of foreign DNA and/or to cleave the encountered nucleic acids to produce (oligo)nucleotides that can
be used by the host.
COG5321/pfam06319
COG5321/pfam06319 (DUF1052) comprises functionally uncharacterized and not annotated short (~160 aa)
proteins found almost exclusively in Proteobacteria. The
profile HMM analysis confidently identified their relationship to AHJRs (P-value ~10-7). The fold-recognition
analysis confirmed the AHJR structures (1gef and 1hh1)
as the best templates, however with low scores (data not
shown). The reason for this low confidence of fold-recognition could be due to the strong divergence of the C-terminal part of the domain and poor consensus of
secondary structure prediction. Nonetheless, COG5321/
pfam06319 members exhibit the conserved orthodox ADE(V/I/C)K motif associated with the characteristic pattern
of predicted secondary structures in the N-terminal part of
the common fold, which is a strong indication that they
are genuine members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily,
active as nucleases. However, the analysis of genomic
neighborhood did not provide any specific clues as to
their specific function.
COG3372/pfam5626
COG3372/pfam5626 (DUF790) is represented by the
uncharacterized product of PAB1046 gene from Pyrococcus
abyssi. Members of this family are found almost exclusively in Archaea and Cyanobacteria. The profile HMM
analysis identified their relationship (P-value ~10-4) to
Pfam06356 (DUF1064) family of putative endonucleases
(identified in this work, see above) and a more remote
similarity to AHJRs (P-value ~10-2). All fold-recognition
servers with the exception of FUGUE identified with high
scores the structure of bacteriophage T7 Endonuclease I
(1fzr, 1m0d) as the best templates for modeling of the Cterminal domain of COG3372 (INBGU: 1fzr, score:
60.96; 1hh1, score: 29.12; 1gef, 19.81; FFAS: 1m0d, score

-8.15; mGenTHREADER: 1fzr, score: 0.529; 1hh1, score:
0.459; SAM: 1m0d, score: 1.6*10-4; 1fzr, score: 5.4*10-4;
1ob8, score: 0.53; SPARKS: 1m0d, score: -3.62; 1ob8,
score: -3.28; 1gef, score: -2.8; 1hh1, score: -2.53; FUGUE:

3DPSSM: 1fzr, score: 0.53; 1gef, score: 0.6). However, the
fold-recognition failed to identify any confident structural
matches for the N-terminal domain (size ~250 aa). Analysis of the genomic neighborhood revealed that
COG3372 members are usually associated with hypothetical proteins from COG1061 (SSL2: DNA or RNA helicases of superfamily II). This suggests they may be
involved in DNA repair or recombination, but does not
exclude their potential selfish character.
gp4 family
The gp4 family is represented by a small (150 aa) protein
gp4 from the T4 bacteriophage, annotated as a head completion protein important for the final stages of bacteriophage head assembly process and predicted to be
important for the DNA-mediated attachment of independently assembled head and fibers [52]. To our knowledge, only a general functional prediction has been made
for this protein and sequences homologous to gp4 have
not been grouped into a PFAM or COG family. We identified them by PSI-BLAST, using a Pfam06356 (DUF1064)
representative as a query, with a very low E-value of 3.2.
The HHsearch analysis carried out for the gp4 family confirmed their relationship to Pfam06356 (DUF1064) (Pvalue 10-3) as well as to COG3372/pfam5626 (P-value 104) and gp51 families (P-value 10-3). Exhaustive PSI-BLAST
searches (5 iterations) confidently reported structures of
bacteriophage T7 endonuclease I (1fzr, 1m0d) as best
templates for the gp4 tertiary structure (E-value = 10-12).
The consensus of fold-recognition analysis confirmed the
prediction pf the PD-(D/E)XK fold, with TnsA structures
(1f1z, 1t0f) as well as T7 Endonuclease I (1fzr, 1m0d)
reported as the best structural matches. gp4 is positioned
in a cluster of genes encoding structural proteins important for the formation of infectious phage particles and to
our knowledge has not been reported to interact with the
DNA, but to be necessary for the assembly of protein components of the viral particles. The attachment of independently assembled head and fibers is however DNAdependent (the process does not occur if there is no DNA
loaded to the phage head) (review: [52]). Thus, it is possible that gp4 may be involved in determination if the DNA
is packed properly or in some yet unknown process
involving the DNA cleavage upon the attachment of the
tail and fibers to the head, for instance when one end of
the packaged DNA descends into the tail.
PAE1662
PAE1662 from Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2 is an
uncharacterized, functionally not annotated protein. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

found it during exhaustive PSI-BLAST searches using
Pfam06356 (DUF1064) representative as a query, with Evalue only about 3.4, but also with a hallmark motif EAD-ELK. We found a characteristic pattern of predicted
secondary structure elements associated with the putative
nuclease motif, while the fold-recognition servers
reported that PAE1662 is similar to several structures of
PD-(D/E)XK superfamily members (mGenTHREADER:
1w36C (RecC), score: 0.651; 1hh1, score 0.594; 1ob8,
score: 0.538; SAM: 1hh1, score: 3.8; 1t0f, score: 4.2; 1f1z,
score 6.3; 3DPSSM: score: 1hh1, score: 1.5). The consensus predictor Pcons selected 1hh1 (AHJR) as a preferred
template. Interestingly, PAE1662 is associated with a gene
encoding a putative DNA:m5C MTase (annotated as
M.PaeIMORF1659P in the REBASE database [42]). In this
context it is noteworthy that a reciprocal PSI-BLAST search
revealed no homologs of PAE1662. Altogether, the association with a DNA MTase, the lack of homologs detectable
by database searches and a remote relationship to the PD(D/E)XK nucleases detected by fold-recognition suggest
that PAE1662 is a novel putative type II REase, which to
date has not been annotated as such in REBASE.

Conclusion
We have carried out a sequence/structure profile HMM
search using a new method [29] to identify new members
of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily. Our results revealed the
presence of this highly diverged nuclease domain in families of proteins implicated in DNA metabolism but with
unknown structure (such as a putative recombinase
RmuC, DNA competence factor CoiA, a DNA-binding
protein SfsA, a large human protein predicted to be a DNA
repair enzyme, predicted archaeal transcription regulators, and the head completion protein of phage T4), and
in proteins for which no function or structure was
assigned to date (such as YhcG, various phage proteins,
and novel candidates for restriction enzymes). The initial
predictions were validated by protein fold-recognition,
leading to preliminary structural models, which were used
as platforms for identification of the potential active sites.
Thus far, all known members of the PD-(D/E)XK fold
were found to be nucleases, mostly acting on the DNA, or
at least have been implicated in nucleic acid metabolism.
It cannot be excluded that some of the newly reported
members may be hydrolases acting on other substrates
(e.g. the SfsA protein involved in stimulation of the sugar
fermentation), but we speculate that most of them would
cleave DNA. The predictions reported in this article will
facilitate the search for the possible substrates.
Our predictions contribute to the reduction of "white
spaces" on the sequence-structure-function map of the
protein universe and will help to jump-start the experimental characterization of the cellular function of these
putative nucleases, as well as the molecular mechanisms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/172

of their interactions with the DNA. That we identified several members of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily with very
low scores suggests that more strongly diverged members
still await discovery. Our analysis has provided a set of
new sequence profiles that may be used to search for even
more members of this important group of enzymes and
will help to select targets for experimental analyses. For
instance, it would be interesting to determine high-resolution structures of the presumably "minimal" members of
the superfamily (such as the predicted nuclease domain in
the C-terminus of the giant protein KIA001018) or proteins with interesting combinations of domains (such as
the fusion of predicted active and inactive nuclease
domains with the HTH domain in PAB2104). The availability of the complete catalog of nucleases and the knowledge of their mechanisms of action (and interaction) in
the cell under different conditions is essential for the complete understanding of mechanisms that govern the evolution and stability of the genome. Our analysis provides
a small, but important step towards this aim.

were used as seeds in PSI-BLAST [69] searches of the nonredundant (nr) database. For each sequence, the search
was carried out in two versions: "conservative", with the
expectation (e) value threshold for the retrieval of related
sequences set to 10-6 and the maximum number of iterations set to 6, and "aggressive", with the e-value threshold
of 10-2 and the maximum number of iterations set to 12.
The final blast (blunt-end master-slave) alignments
together with the predicted secondary structure were used
to generate a set of query profile HMMs using HHmake
from the HHsearch package [29]. The profile HMMs corresponding to all COG, KOG [30], PFAM [70], PDB [71],
CDD [72] and SMART [73] entries were downloaded from
the home site of HHsearch (the Department of Developmental
Biology
(MPI),
http://protevo.eb.tuebin
gen.mpg.de/). Comparison of the profile HMMs
(sequence+structure) was carried out using HHsearch
[29], with default parameters.

Methods

Abbreviations

Protein structure prediction
Secondary structure prediction and tertiary fold-recognition was carried out via the GeneSilico meta-server gateway at http://genesilico.pl/meta/[53]. Secondary structure
was predicted using PSIPRED [54], PROFsec [55], PROF
[56], SABLE [57], JNET [58], JUFO [59], and SAM-T02
[60]. Solvent accessibility for the individual residues was
predicted with SABLE [57] and JPRED [58]. The fold-recognition analysis (attempt to match the query sequence to
known protein structures) was carried out using FFAS03
[61], SAM-T02 [60], 3DPSSM [62], BIOINBGU [63],
FUGUE [64], mGenTHREADER [65], and SPARKS [66].
Fold-recognition alignments reported by these methods
were compared, evaluated, and ranked by the Pcons server
[67]. In the cases, where the active site could not be unambiguously identified from the analysis of alignments, we
carried out homology modeling and tried to identify the
potential catalytic residues based on structural considerations. Accordingly, fold-recognition alignments to the
structures of selected templates were used as a starting
point for homology modeling using the "FRankenstein's
Monster" approach [68], comprising cycles of model
building, evaluation, realignment in poorly scored
regions and merging of best scoring fragments. The modeling protocol was essentially identical to that published
in [21].
