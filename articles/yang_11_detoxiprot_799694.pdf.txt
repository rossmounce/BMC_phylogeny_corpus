Abstract
Background: Detoxification proteins are a class of proteins for degradation and/or elimination of endogenous and
exogenous toxins or medicines, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by these materials. Most of
these proteins are generated as a response to the stimulation of toxins or medicines. They are essential for the
clearance of harmful substances and for maintenance of physiological balance in organisms. Thus, it is important to
collect and integrate information on detoxification proteins.
Results: To store, retrieve and analyze the information related to their features and functions, we developed the
DetoxiProt, a comprehensive database for annotation of these proteins. This database provides detailed
introductions about different classes of the detoxification proteins. Extensive annotations of these proteins,
including sequences, structures, features, inducers, inhibitors, substrates, chromosomal location, functional domains
as well as physiological-biochemical properties were generated. Furthermore, pre-computed BLAST results, multiple
sequence alignments and evolutionary trees for detoxification proteins are also provided for evolutionary study of
conserved function and pathways. The current version of DetoxiProt contains 5956 protein entries distributed in
628 organisms. An easy to use web interface was designed, so that annotations about each detoxification protein
can be retrieved by browsing with a specific method or by searching with different criteria.
Conclusions: DetoxiProt provides an effective and efficient way of accessing the detoxification protein sequences
and other high-quality information. This database would be a valuable source for toxicologists, pharmacologists
and medicinal chemists. DetoxiProt database is freely available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/detoxiprot/.

Background
Living organisms are exposed to the external environment and are continuously confronted with a variety of
chemical compounds and xenobiotics. Many of these
naturally occurring substances or man-made chemicals
can be deleterious when inhaled or absorbed, or even
hazardous to organisms, (e.g. plant toxins to prevent
herbivory). Artificial chemicals include anti-cancer

drugs, antibiotics produced by fungi, insecticide, herbicide and other environmental pollutants [1]. Some kinds
of toxins can lead the cell to produce large amounts of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), though in some cases,
ROS can be natural by-products of metabolic processes.
ROS can react with many cellular molecules and cause
damage or contribute to the development of various
pathologies [2]. Thus, self-protective mechanisms
including catalytic biotransformation have evolved as an
adaptation against various toxic chemical species. Cells
possess various kinds of detoxification proteins that are
capable of metabolizing a wide variety of toxins, mainly
classified into Phase I and Phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XEMs) as well as antioxidant enzymes

according to their functional mechanisms [3-5]. These
proteins react directly with toxins to reduce their toxicity and enhance their solubility so that they can be
easily eliminated from the cell.
Phase I reactions include oxidation, reduction and
hydrolysis. A major function of the Phase I reaction is
the transformation of substrates so that they can be
easily eliminated or modified by reactive groups for subsequent Phase II reaction. The most important Phase I
system is the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP). It is an
important class of heme-containing monooxigenase that
mainly catalyzes the oxidative reactions of the adjunction of an atom from molecular oxygen into a substrate.
This superfamily can be functionally classified into three
groups, with more than 50 protein members have been
identified in humans [6]. The genetic association
between CYP superfamily and various diseases has been
identified, such as cancer, fatty liver disease and Parkinson’s disease [7-9]. Phase II reactions include glutathione (GSH) conjugation, glucuronidation, sulfation,
acetylation, and methylation. Small polar molecules,
such as glutathione, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) and
acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), can be conjugated with the
toxic compounds [10-12]. Glutathione conjugation is the
primary Phase II reaction. The glutathione S-transferase
(GST) catalyzes the conjugation of the thiol group of
GSH, the tripeptide gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly, with a wide
variety of electrophiles. It has been widely demonstrated
that the polymorphism of GSTs is related to cancer susceptibility and patient survival [13]. ROS produced by
exogenous toxins or generated during the endogenous
metabolic process can react with the oxidation enzymes
and was eventually reduced by non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alphatocopherol (vitamin E) and GSH, or enzymatic antioxidant defenses, such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD)
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [14,15]. Relatively high
levels of oxygen in the brain make it one of the vulnerable organs to ROS damage. Many neurodegenerative
diseases are associated with oxidative damage such as
Parkinson’s disease [16]. Thus, these proteins may constitute the major protective mechanism of the brain
from damage due to oxidative stress [17].
Detoxification proteins have been found from invertebrates to vertebrates. More than one hundred genes
encoding these proteins have been identified in humans.
Large efforts have been made to understand the structural, functional and evolutionary basis of detoxification
proteins, as well as their roles in disease development
[18-20]. Many detoxification protein-related databases
have been established to provide this kind of information, such as PeroxisomeDB [21] and PeroxiBase [22].
These databases mainly focus on peroxidase related

proteins, which constitute only part of the steps in cellular detoxification. There is currently no system for the
classification and annotation of all these proteins. Thus,
the DetoxiProt database was created to facilitate the efficient annotation and acquisition of information about
the detoxification proteins. The aim of the DetoxiProt is
to provide a useful platform for detoxification protein
researchers in the fields of physiology, pharmacology,
toxicology, food security, farm chemical development
and environmental pollution related research. It provides relevant information for the function and evolutionary analysis of these proteins. In addition to the
chemical features of the genes, the DetoxiProt features
3D structures, sub-cellular location, tissue expression
and especially, the inducer, inhibitor and substrates of
these enzymes. Presently, the database contains 5956
entries encompassing 20 different detoxification protein
families.

Construction and content
We extensively searched various public databases and
related literature to collect information on detoxification
proteins. Data collection was performed by the following
approaches: we first performed a systemic search for
relevant literature and determined the precise classification of these proteins. Accordingly, 20 protein families
were identified (Figure 1). For each protein family, a
summary description was compiled displaying the gene
symbol name, InterPro database ID and the protein
introduction [23]. Then, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [24], the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) [25] and NCBI gene database
were inquired to identify all the members of each family.
Other public databases including Ethanol-Related Gene
Resource (ERGR) [26], Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR)
Superfamily homepage [27] and PeroxiBase [22] were
subsequently searched for further confirmation and supplementation. Then we queried through a list of the
protein names as the keywords against SwissProt and
NCBI protein database for collection of protein
sequences [28]. For the completeness of the database,
we used the BLAST embedded in NCBI to search
homolog sequences. The final set of detoxification proteins were manually compiled, with a total of 5956 proteins from 628 organisms collected.
Extra information from other databases and literature,
as well as the predicted protein features were incorporated into each detoxification record. Protein cofactors,
tissue distribution and cellular location were retrieved
from the references and publicly available databases
such as NCBI and UniProtKB, while experimentally
determined protein structures were retrieved from protein databank (PDB) [29]. DetoxiProt also provides the

Figure 1 Classification of the detoxification proteins in DetoxiProt. Detoxification proteins can be classified as Phase I, Phase II xenobioticmetabolizing enzymes and antioxidant enzymes according to their functional mechanisms. Totally 20 protein families were identified. Some
protein families can be classified as subfamilies, including the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase and peroxidase.

predicted protein physiological-biochemical properties
including the molecular weight, theoretical pI, aliphatic
index and Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY),
which computed by the ProtParam tool from the Expasy
server (http://www.expasy.org/tools/protpar-ref.html).
To provide fast protein classification, protein domains
were predicted by various web servers including the
Pfam [30], Prosite [31] and SMART [32]. External database links such as NCBI Protein, UNIPROT, KEGG etc,
were also included.
Due to the importance of detoxification proteins for
medicinal chemistry, we collected information from the
literature the about the inducer, inhibitor and substrate
for each protein from nine model organisms (Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster,
Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, Rattus norvegicus and Xenopus laevis). The
nomenclatures of the toxins were revised and unified
according to MeSH and PubChem [28]. Thus, each
entry was manually annotated to ensure data quality. A
detailed strategy for protein information collection and
data integration can be seen in Figure 2.
Database architecture

DetoxiProt was implemented as a relational database
using MySQL. Five major tables were used to store data.
Web interface was implemented using PHP language.
The database is running on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux

3 with Apache as HTTP server (please see additional
file 1).

Utility
DetoxiProt provides a user-friendly interface allowing
easy access to data. The “Home” page contains general
information about the database and detoxification proteins. The “detoxification protein classification” page
summarizes detailed information about the biological
activity of each kind of protein. Other useful tools are
also provided:
Basic and advanced searches

The “Search DB” page permits users to perform a quick
search and advanced search in the database. Gene symbol name, NCBI gene ID, UNIPROT ID and PDB ID
are supported for the quick search. Advanced search
tool allow users to combine multiple criteria including
protein name, organism, tissue distribution, sub-cellular
location, etc. This method helps users to locate specific
proteins of interest rapidly and accurately. For example,
a medicinal chemist or a pharmacologist may be particularly interested in the specific human cell membrane
proteins that are inhibited by some kind of toxin, so the
options of protein name, organism, cellular location and
inhibitor in each of the pull-down lists can be selected
separately and simultaneously, and records limited by
specific keywords will be displayed.

Figure 2 Data source and integration of DetoxiProt. Protein sequences are mainly sourced from NCBI and SwissProt, Protein structures were
retrieved from PDB database, Biochemical feature were predicted by ProtParam tool from the Expasy server, substrates, inducers and inhibitors
for detoxification proteins were manually compiled from literature.

Peptide mapping and protein domain search

A tool of peptide mapping is designed for mapping the
functional peptides to the entire sequence of detoxification protein. User defined peptide sequences can be
exactly searched from protein sequences and the position information provided. This is helpful for understanding the distribution of the active peptides across
entire proteins. Another useful tool to infer the functional diversity of detoxification protein is the protein
domain search. The concept that conserved sequences
among sequences may be a symbol of functionally similar protein domains underlies many classification methods of protein families. Thus we predict the domains
within each protein by Pfam, Prosite and SMART web
servers. A simple keyword search tool was provided to
search database entries by domain or family name of
interest to the user.
Structural similarity search

DetoxiProt provides a structural similarity search tool,
the 3D-BLAST [33,34], to search detoxification proteins
that have similar 3D-structures. This method allows for
a quick and accurate search based on protein structure.
It identifies 23 states of structural alphabet, which are
used to represent pattern profiles of the protein backbone fragment. Protein structures are represented as
structural alphabet sequence databases (SADB). Users
may upload their own structure files in PDB format,
after which the 3D-Blast program uses BLAST to search

for the longest common substructures, known as structural alphabet high-scoring segment pairs (SAHSP),
between the structural alphabet sequence translated
from query structure and that of other structures in the
database. A statistical significance score (E-value) is calculated to indicate the reliability of the prediction of the
alignment. Depiction of the results for different search
methods is provided (please see additional file 2).
Browse database

Different browsing methods are implemented in the database to allow users to navigate by specific criteria. DetoxiProt provides seven different browsing methods: browse
all data or specific dataset including the classification, species, tissue distribution, substrates, inducers and inhibitors.
Cascading browse styles from specific dataset to protein
list, then to detailed information are provided. The
“detailed information” page includes general information,
protein information, predicted protein features, protein
structure, external database links and references. The 3D
illustration of a protein structure may be viewed in interactive mode via the Jmol applet (http://www.jmol.org/)
when the structure file is available. This tool would be particularly useful for protein structure investigation and drug
development. While protein sequences may be individually
download in FASTA format, the complete set of protein
sequences may be retrieved from the “Download” page.
Figure 3 shows an example of the detailed information on
the “browse” page.

Comparative genomics tools

A customized BLAST tool is embedded for sequence
similarity search [35]. To identify potential paralogs or
orthologs of each detoxification protein, pre-computed
top-matched hits by BLAST search against other
proteins in DetoxiProt were listed in the “detailed information” page. This would facilitate phylogenetic relationships studies of the genes across different organisms
throughout evolution. Putative ortholog genes may be
identified from the best reciprocal hits. For each of the
nine model organisms, we generated multiple sequence
alignments for each protein family by MUSCLE [36].
Corresponding phylogenetic trees were built by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method embedded in RAxML
[37]. The nonparametric bootstrap test was performed
for 100 replicates. A Java application of Archaeopteryx
tree viewer is embedded for browsing and manipulation
of the phylogenetic trees [38]. An example illustrating
the result of cytosolic sulfotransferases of Mus musculus
is available in the additional file 3. Both the multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree pages can be
found in the “tools” page.

Discussion
Although information concerning specific types of detoxification proteins, for example, peroxidase or peroxisome
related proteins, proteins involved in ethanol or drug
metabolism, can be found in some databases including the
PeroxisomeDB, PeroxiBase, ERGR and SuperTarget [39], a
complete collection of all these categories of proteins is
still deficient. Here, the key categories of proteins involved
in detoxification are identified and classified. In addition,
the targets identified for the detoxification proteins may
provide clues to determine the possible effective enzymes
in specific drug metabolism pathway. In total, 20 different
protein families were identified to be involved in the functionality of detoxification after a literature review. For
complete analysis of the database, we inspected the

Page 6 of 8

phylogenetic distribution of protein families across model
organisms (please see additional file 4). All of the three
major detoxification protein classes were found in the nine
model organisms. For the protein families, relatively complete datasets were found in mammals. However, the aldehyde oxidases and xanthine oxidoreductases are missing in
chimpanzees, the catalases are missing in chickens and
seven protein families are missing in amphibia. In contrast,
a relatively small number of proteins were found in invertebrates including the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The amount of detoxification genes
took up about 1.5% of genomic genes in most model
organisms. At the gene-family level, the cytochrome P450
family and the glutathione S-transferase family are the
most abundant groups, with 68 and 48 members identified
in humans, respectively. A relatively small number of proteins were found in non-model organisms, probably due to
the incomplete annotation of the genes in these species.
In order to give an overview of the function of detoxification proteins, we collected all the 388 human genes and
then explored their annotation of molecular function in
Gene Ontology by means of the GOEAST [40]. Among
368 genes identified to have catalytic activities, more than
70% have the oxidoreductase activity, and about 30% have
transferase activity and the function of ion binding. Other
genes function for lipid binding, carboxylic acid binding
and selenium binding (please see additional file 5). To provide an overview of protein and toxins relationships, we
constructed a network to describe links of the relationship
between human detoxification proteins and chemical compounds or environmental factors (here unified as toxins),
which include the substrates, inducers and inhibitors compiled from the literature (please see additional file 6).
Within this network, 18 detoxification proteins (13.6%) are
associated with only one kind of toxin, while 78 detoxification proteins (59.1%) are associated with more than five
kinds of toxins (Figure 4A). CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4,
CYP2B6 and UGT1A1 demonstrated the highest

connectivity, which suggests the importance of the cytochrome P450 superfamily for elimination of toxins and
maintenance of balance in the internal environment. CYPs
represent the most important Phase I toxin/drug metabolizing enzymes. They are responsible for the metabolism
of more than 80% of the clinical drugs. Inter-individual
variation of CYP genes constitutes an important factor
related to cancer susceptibility [41]. Similar to CYPs, The
Phase II enzyme UGT is another important kind of drug
metabolic protein. Association between UGT genes and
diseases including cancer and fatty liver disease are already
identified [42,43]. For the toxins, the metal ions, estradiol,
tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and
rifampin take the top five positions in our developed network. Figure 4B shows the number of proteins associated
with toxins. 430 kinds of toxins (57.3%) were shown to be
associated with only one protein. Although some bias may
exist due to the literature investigated, nevertheless, this
network provides a useful tool for inferring the relationships between detoxification protein and toxins.

Conclusions
In summary, DetoxiProt is a powerful and reliable database that provides comprehensive information about
detoxification proteins. Various browsing manners and
powerful search engines were implemented providing
users with useful ways to explore information in the database. We expect that DetoxiProt will serve as a useful tool
for researchers in the detoxification protein field. It could
also lead to better understanding of the function and evolution of detoxification proteins. The database will be continually updated, and as the increasing numbers of novel
sequences become available, newly identified detoxification proteins will be added to the database. We also hope
to adopt text-mining tools to help us to pre-screen protein-toxin relationships. These methods will continue to
enhance the completeness of the database.
Availability and requirements
The DetoxiProt may be accessed through http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/detoxiprot/. All the information is freely
available to users. To browse the protein 3D structures
and phylogenetic trees, the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) plug-in is required.
