Abstract
Background: Nontyphoidal Salmonella is the main cause of human salmonellosis. In order to study
the prevalent serogroups and serovars of clinical isolates in Taiwan, 8931 Salmonellae isolates were
collected from 19 medical centers and district hospitals throughout the country from 2004 to 2007.
The pulsed-field eletrophoresis types (PFGE) and antibiotic resistance profiles of Salmonella enterica
serovars Bareilly (S. Bareilly) and Braenderup (S. Braenderup) were compared, and multi-drug
resistance (MDR) plasmids were characterized.
Results: Over 95% of human salmonellosis in Taiwan was caused by five Salmonella serogroups: B,
C1, C2-C3, D1, and E1. S. Typhymurium, S. Enteritidis, S. Stanley and S. Newport were the four
most prevalent serovars, accounting for about 64% of isolates. While only one or two major
serovars from four of the most prevalent serogroups were represented, four predominant
serovars were found in serogroup C1 Salmonellae. The prevalence was decreasing for S.
Choleraeuis and S. Braenderup, and S. Virchow and increasing for S. Bareilly. S. Braenderup mainly
caused gastroenteritis in children; in contrast, S. Bareiley infected children and elderly people. Both
serovars differed by XbaI-PFGE patterns. Almost all S. Bareilly isolates were susceptible to
antibiotics of interest, while all lacked plasmids and belonged to one clone. Two distinct major
clones in S. Braenderup were cluster A, mainly including MDR isolates with large MDR plasmid
from North Taiwan, and cluster B, mainly containing susceptible isolates without R plasmid from
South Taiwan. In cluster A, there were two types of conjugative R plasmids with sizes ranging from
75 to 130 kb. Type 1 plasmids consisted of replicons F1A/F1B, blaTEM, IS26, and a class 1 integron

with the genes dfrA12-orfF-aadA2-qacEΔ1-sulI. Type 2 plasmids belonged to incompatibility group
IncI, contained tnpA-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE genetic structures and lacked both IS26 and class 1 integrons.
Although type 2 plasmids showed higher conjugation capability, type 1 plasmids were the
predominant plasmid.
Conclusions: Serogroups B, C1, C2-C3, D1, and E1 of Salmonella caused over 95% of human
salmonellosis. Two prevalent serovars within serogroup C1, S. Bareilly and cluster B of S.
Braenderup, were clonal and drug-susceptible. However, cluster A of S. Braenderup was MDR and
probably derived from susceptible isolates by acquiring one of two distinct conjugative R plasmids.

Background

Results

Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are major zoonotic pathogens
that commonly cause salmonellosis outbreaks. Globally,
salmonellosis caused by non-typhoidal salmonellae generally results in about 1.3 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis and 3 million deaths annually [1]. In the United
States, Salmonellae cause an estimated 1.4 million cases of
salmonellosis and over 500 deaths annually [2]. Multidrug resistant (MDR) Salmonella, the global spread of
which is mediated by international food trade and travel,
is a global public health issue [3,4]. Often, clonal spread
of MDR strains has been observed in particular serovars
[4-6]. In most instances, resistance genes often associated
with integrons and/or transposons are clustered within
antimicrobial resistance islands that can be horizontally
transferred by conjugative or mobilization plasmids [7].

Prevalent serogroups and serovars
Between 2004 and 2007, over 95% of 8,931 Salmonella
isolates belonged to serogroups B, C1, C2-C3, D1 and E1
(Table 1). Prevalence differed between serogroups and
across time within serogroups: prevalence decreased in
serogroups B (46.9%→42.4%) and C1 (14.2%→9.1%)
and increased in serogroups C2-C3 (9%→11.3%) and D1
(23.3%→30.2%) over the study period. Such changes
were associated with the prevalence of major serovars in
each serogroup and were due to only one or two main predominant serovars in each serogroup, except serogroup
C1 with four prevalent serovars (Table 1). The top four
serovars were S. Enteritidis (22.9-28.9%) of serogroup
D1, S. Typhimurium (20.4-24.7%) and S. Stanley (8.211.4%) of serogroup B, and S. Newport of serogroup C2
(5.6 - 7.3%). In contrast to the decrease in prevalence of S.
Typhimurium from 2005 to 2007, a gradual increase in
prevalence was observed in S. Enteritidis.

In serogroup C1, S. Bareilly and S. Braenderup are closely
related according to molecular analysis [8,9]. Both serovars have been highly susceptible to antimicrobials since
1971 [10,11] and are frequently isolated from feces of
people with food-borne salmonellosis all over the world
[12-16]. However, prevalence of both serovars differs
between hosts and regions. In Denmark, S. Bareilly was
isolated from diverse sources, including humans, animals
and animal feed, while S. Braenderup was only found in
humans [17]. In a study of a broiler-raising plant in the
USA, S. Bareilly was often found in broilers and finished
feed; however, S. Braenderup was only observed in hatcheries [18]. In addition, S. Braenderup was commonly isolated from cattle and turtles in Sweden [19], pigs [12] and
chicken egg shells [20] in USA. These findings imply that
animal reservoirs may be important sources of both serovars in human disease.
In this study, prevalent serogroups and serovars were
determined for 8,931 Salmonella isolates collected from
2004 and 2007 in Taiwan. Because of the genetic similarity between S. Bareilly and S. Braenderup [8,9], the two
serovars were compared with respect to antimicrobial
resistance, resistance genes, PFGE and plasmid profiles.
Both serovars disseminated clonally and varied in antimicrobial resistance patterns.

Prevalence of serogroup C1 serovars
S. Braenderup, S. Choleraesuis, S. Bareilly and S. Virchow
were the predominant serovars in serogroup C1 and consisted of 66 - 84% of total serogroup C1 isolates from
2004 to 2007 (Table 1). Other serovars, including S.
Infantis, S. Potsdam, S. Mbandaka, and S. Montevideo,
were occasionally isolated with prevalence less than 1%
for each serovar. Over the study period, the prevalence of
S. Choleraesuis declined dramatically, and S. Braenderup
prevalence declined mildly. In contrast, the prevalence of
S. Bareilly and other serovars gradually increased from
2004 to 2007. Since S. Braenderup and S. Bareilly were the
two main serogroup C1 serovars in 2006-2007 and differed in prevalence trends, 45 S. Braenderup and 51 S.
Bareilly isolates were analyzed for their antimicrobial
resistance profiles and genetic characteristics.
Age distribution of patients
Patients infected with S. Braenderup and S. Bareilly were
separated into four age groups. Although, both serovars
were found primarily to infect children (age ≤ 4 years), S.
Bareilly was isolated far more frequently from the elderly
(age ≥ 50 years) (8.9% for S. Braenderup vs. 31.4% for S.

Braenderup, all isolates were separated into 2 clusters (I
and II) at S = 0.68. Most isolates belonged to cluster I,
which was further separated into two subgroups (A and B)
at S = 0.84 (Figure 1A). In cluster A, 19 isolates were separated into 9 PFGE patterns, and 78.9% (15/19) of the
isolates were from northern Taiwan (Figure 1A). In cluster
B, 25 isolates were grouped into 4 PFGE patterns, and
72% (18/25) of the isolates were from southern Taiwan
(Figure 1A). S. Bareilly isolates were highly genetically
homogenous and shared more than 90% pattern similarity (Figure 1B).
Antimicrobial resistance profiles
Among six traditional antibiotics tested, S. Braenderup
and S. Bareilly isolates were almost all susceptible to chloramphenicol (CHL; 6.7% for S. Braenderup vs 0% for S.
Bareilly) and kanamycin (KAN; 4.4% vs 0%) and differed
significantly in resistance to ampicillin (AMP, 37.7% for
S. Braenderup vs 0% for S. Bareilly), nalidixic acid (NAL;

Table 3: Characteristics of MDR plasmids from 17 S. Braenderup isolates.

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:264

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/264

nine resistance patterns were determined, ranging from
susceptibility to all antimicrobials to resistance to four
antimicrobials. In S. Braenderup, 7 resistance patterns (S,
R2, R4 to R8) were found, and significant differences were
observed between cluster A (patterns R2, R4-R8) and B
(patterns S and R2) for AMP (77.3% vs 0%), STR (63.6%
vs 13%) and TET (54.5% vs 13%). In addition, most isolates in cluster A were MDR (73.7%) while most isolates
in cluster B were susceptible (84%). In cluster A, pattern
R6 (AMP, TET, and STR) was the predominant and was
found in four genotypes (A3, A5, A6, and A7). In S.
Bareilly, most isolates were either susceptible (S pattern;
52.9%) or resistant to one (pattern R1 and R2; 31.4% and
9.8%, respectively) or two (pattern R3; 5.9%) antimicrobials. NAL resistant isolates were found in S. Bareilly (patterns R2 and R3) but not in S. Braenderup. Since there
were susceptible to levofloxacin (LEV) and moxifloxacin
(MOX), NAL resistance may result from a mutation in the
gyrA gene, which encodes a subunit of the enzyme DNA
gyrase.
Characterization of MDR plasmids
The prevalence of plasmid profile determined by plasmid
number and size differed between these two serovars.
Most S. Braenderup isolates [93.3%, (42/45)] carried plasmids, while few S. Bareilly isolates [23.5 % (12/51)] did
(Figure 1). Plasmids larger than ca.75 kb were only found
in resistance isolates of cluster A with the R4 to R8 patterns. Cluster B S. Braenderup isolates and S. Bareilly isolates carried smaller plasmids with the size smaller than
6.6 kb or lacked plasmids. Larger plasmids were further
identified as R plasmids by analysis of the antimicrobial
resistance profiles of E. coli pir116 transformants, and
assigned to type 1 and 2 based on HindIII-restriction patterns (Table 3, Figure 2). Further conjugation, antibiotic
resistance and PCR characterization of incompatibility
and oriT types, mobile element IS26, class 1 integron, and
AMP resistance genes blaTEM and blaCMY-2 were performed
for these two plasmid types. Type 1 plasmids were separated into 7 subtypes (1a ~1g) based on differences in
plasmid size ranging from 99.1 kb to 137.4 kb and restriction pattern. All plasmids carried blaTEM, replicons F1A
and F1B, IS26, and a class 1 integron (Additional files 1
and 2: Figure S1 and S2) with a gene cluster of dfrA12-orfFaadA2-qacEΔ1-sulI, conferring resistance to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (Sxt) and disappearing in plasmid 1 g
(Table 3), which apparently coincides with that in the
plasmid of S. Typhimurium (Accession number
AB365868). The size of R plasmid was associated with
antimicrobial resistance and conjugation capability
(Table 3). Only type 1a plasmids, with a size of 137.4 kb
and conferring resistance to AMP, CHL, KAN, Sxt and TET,
and 1b plasmids, with a size of 122.6 kb and encoding
resistance to AMP and Sxt, were capable of conjugation,
with efficiencies ranging 4.22 ~ 8.25 × 10-6. The other

smaller plasmids, with sizes ranging from 99.1 kb to
104.8 kb and encoding resistance to AMP and Sxt for 1c1e and 1g, and to AMP, CHL, Sxt and TET for 1f, were not
capable of conjugation. Due to differences in plasmid size
and since IS26 could be involved in plasmid transposition
and recombination, we performed PCR amplification
with the IS26 in primers and IS26out primers for all type
1 plasmids (Figure 3). In contrast to a 1.1-kb PCR product
in the largest 1a plasmid, 1b, 1d, and 1e plasmids lacked
any PCR products; 1e and 1g plasmids presented 3.1 kb
PCR products; and 1c plasmid yielded two PCR products
with sizes of 3.1 kb and 0.7 kb. These results suggest that
the number of IS26 and/or distance between two IS26 elements differed among these type 1 plasmids. In contrast
to type 1 plasmids, type 2 plasmids were much smaller in
size (77.5 kb and 85 kb) and had higher conjugation efficiencies, ranging from 8.41 × 10-2 to 1.28 × 10-1 (Table 3).
In addition, type 2 plasmids were the IncI1 plasmid and
contained oriT as well as tnpA-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE (Table 3,
Additional files 3: Figure S3).

Discussion
Human salmonellosis was limited to five Salmonella serogroups: B, C1, C2-C3, D1, and E1 (Table 1). Despite the
decrease in prevalence of S. Typhimurium and the
increase in the prevalence of S. Enteritidis from 2005 to
2007, serogroups B and D Salmonellae were the major
pathogens for foodborne salmonellosis in Taiwan due to

S. Typhimurium, S. Stanley, and S. Enteritidis of serogroup D1 being the three most prevalent serovars overall.
Although the prevalence of serogroups C1 and C2-C3
were similar (around 11%), 4 prevalent serovars and 2
main serovars were found in serogroup C1 and serogroup
C2-C3, respectively. In the present study, a shift in prevalence was observed in these four prevalent serogroup C1
serovars: a rapidly decrease in the prevalence of S. Choleresuis, mainly due to enhancement of sanitation and
control of swine in Taiwan, and an increase in prevalence
of S. Bareilly and other serovars (Table 1). Compared to
the 1.6% increase in the prevalence of S. Braenderup from
1978 to 1987 in southern Taiwan [21], the change in the
prevalence of isolates in this study ranged from 1.6% to
3.8%, with a trend of decrease from 2004 to 2007, except
an increase of S. Braenderup infection in 2006 (Table 1),
suggesting possibly occurrence of outbreaks in this year.

Contrary to earlier reports that S. Bareilly and S.
Braenderup are closely related genetically [8,9], resistant
to 10 Salmonella bacteriophages [22], and infect immunocompromised patients, differences between S. Braenderup
and S. Bareilly were found in the prevalence trend from
2004 to 2007 (Table 1), patients' age group (Table 2), and
plasmid profile as well as antimicrobial resistance groups
and XbaI-PFGE patterns (Figure 1A). In addition to genetic
differences between these two serovars, differences in animal hosts were also observed in both serovars based on
the geographic regions from which they were isolated
[13,17,18,23]. In this study, we found that S. Bareilley isolates were highly homogeneous genetically and that S.
Braenderup isolates were much diverse in our PFGE and
plasmid analysis (Figure 1). This may explain why S.
Braenderup, but not S. Bareilly, has been frequently
reported [19,20,24]. To differentiate S. Braenderup, sev-

eral molecular methods have been developed, including
phage typing [25] and plasmid analysis as performed in
this study (Table 1, Figure 1 and 2).
Unlike MDR S. Choleraesuis isolated from pigs and
humans [5,6], S. Braenderup and S. Bareilly isolated from
pigs were highly susceptible to antibiotics in 1971 [10]. In
addition, in a study of resistance to 11 antibiotics for Salmonella isolated from turtles, S. Bareilly was still susceptible to all antibiotics, and, in contrast, few S. Braenderup
isolates were resistant to gentamycin (6/15), sulfisoxazole
(6/15) and TET (2/15) [11]. In our study, almost all of the
cluster A isolates of S. Braenderup were MDR and associated with large MDR plasmids (Table 3, Figure 1).
Although RFLP analysis separated type 1 plasmids into 7
subtypes, based on antimicrobial resistance encoded by
these plasmids, 3 subtypes were observed, conferring
resistance to AMP and Sxt (1b-1e and 1g), AMP, CHL, Sxt,
and TET (1f) and AMP, CHL, KAN, Sxt and TET (1a),
respectively (Table 3). Apparently, the dfrA12-orfF-aadA2qacEΔ1-sulI region of class 1 integrons, which is frequently
found in MDR Salmonella [26-28], was located on MDR
plasmid and conferred resistance to Sxt (Table 3). Insertion sequence IS26 existed in all (Table 3) and differed
from plasmids in S. Braenderburg found in Spain [29].
The size change in type 1 plasmids may be due to presence
of multiple IS26 elements that may be involved in plasmid rearrangement (Figure 3).
Although conjugation capability of type 2 plasmids was
higher than that of type 1 plasmids, we only identified
coexistence of type 1 and 2 plasmids in three S.
Braenderup isolates, which differed in isolation day and
PFGE pattern (Table 3). Isolate 13 with type 1f and 2a
plasmids was collected in July of 2004 from Taipei. Isolate
32 with type 1d and 2a plasmids and isolate 36 with 1c
and 2b plasmids were collected in March and May of
2005, respectively, from Taichung (Table 3). Only one
isolate 44 with a type 1d plasmid was collected before
those three isolates, in June of 2004 from Taichung. These
results suggest possibly that isolate 32 with A6 genotype
and R6 resistance pattern may be derived from isolate 44
with a type 1 plasmid, A4 genotype and R6 resistance pattern by introduction of a type 2 plasmid. Interestingly,
type 2 plasmids are IncI1 plasmids, carrying the tnpAblaCMY-2-blc-sugE structure (Table 3). AmpC β-lactamases
are broadly distributed among the Enteribacteriaceae, and
plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases include ACC, ACT,
CFE, CMY, DHA, FOX, LAT, MIR, and MOX [30]. At least
three transposase associated genetic structures for blaCMY
include ISEcp1-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE, ISCR1-blaCMY-9-yqgF-yqgE
and IS26-frdC-frdD-ampR-blaCMY-13-blc-sugE-IS26 [30].
Recently, blaCMY has been shown to be broadly spread in
Salmonella worldwide [29,31,32] and to be present in S.
Braenderup [33]. In Taiwan, since we reported the tnpA-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/264

blaCMY-2-blc-sugE structure in S. Choleraesuis in 2004 [34],
this transposon-like element has been found in other Salmonella serovars and Enterobacteriaceae [32]. In the present
study, we first reported that S. Braenderup harbors tnpAblaCMY-2-blc-sugE on a type 2 plasmid. Comparing this
plasmid with the 138-kb plasmid pSC138 (accession no.
NC_006856) of S. Choleraesuis, both are IncI1 plasmids
with the tnpA-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE structure. However, type 2
plasmids were conjugative and much smaller in size due
to lack of a 60-kb DNA region with multiple integrons and
transposons, which carry MDR genes [35-37].

Conclusions
Over 95% cases of human salmonellosis surveyed in this
study were caused by 5 Salmonella serogroups: B, C1, C2,
D1, and E1. As two prevalent serogroup C1 serovars, S.
Braenderup and S. Bareiley differed in patients' age groups
and XbaI-PFGE patterns. Both serovars were clonally disseminated and drug-susceptible. However, in S.
Braenderup, cluster A MDR isolates were derived from
susceptible isolates by sequential introduction of two distinct R plasmids. Type 1 plasmids carry blaTEM, F1A/F1B
replicons, insertion sequence IS26, and a class 1 integron
with a gene cluster comprised of dfrA12-orfF-aadA2qacEΔ1-sulI. In contrast, type 2 plasmids consist of IncI1
replicon and tnpA-blaCMY-2-blc-sugE. Although type 2 plasmids showed higher conjugation capability, type 1 plasmids were the predominant plasmids responsible for
MDR dissemination in S. Braenderup.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
Salmonella isolates were collected from 19 medical centers
and district hospitals located throughout Taiwan from
2004 to 2007. Serotypes of the isolates were determined
in the Salmonella Reference Laboratory of Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Health, Taiwan, with
antisera purchased from S&A Reagents Lab (Bangkok,
Thailand), Denka Seiken (Tokyo, Japan), Statens Serum
Institut (Copenhagen, Denmark), and a local biotech
company, LTK Biolaboratories (Taoyuan, Taiwan). Phase
induction was performed using a paper-bridged method
developed by the Taiwan CDC [38]. In total, 51 S. Bareilly
isolates and 45 S. Braenderup isolates collected in 2004
and 2005 were selected for further characterization. Isolates were separated into two groups based on their geographic origin: the north Taiwan group, consisting of
isolates collected from north of Taichung county (including Taichung county), and the south Taiwan group, consisting of isolates collected from south of Taichung
county.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using
the disc diffusion method in accordance with the guide-

lines of the CLSI standards [39] with 7 antibiotics: ampicillin (AMP, 50 μg), chloramphenicol (CHL, 20 μg),
kanamycin (KAN, 30 μg), streptomycin (STR, 10 μg), tetracycline (TET, 12 μg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(Sxt, 23.75/1.25 μg), and quinolone antibiotics including
nalidixic acid (NAL, 30 μg), levofloxacin (LEV, 5 μg) and
moxifloxacin (MOX, 5 μg). The antimicrobials were purchased from BD (Becton Dickinson and Company,
Sparks, Maryland, USA). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was
used as the reference strain. An MDR isolate was defined
as having resistance to three or more antibiotics belonging
to different antibiotic classes.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
The PulseNet Standardized Laboratory PFGE Protocol for
Molecular Subtyping of Echerichia coli O157:H7, nontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes, and Shigella sonnei [40]
was used for analysis of the Salmonella isolates: 10 U of
XbaI were used for the restriction digestion. PFGE images
were analyzed by using the fingerprint analysis software
BioNumerics version 4.5 (Applied Maths). A unique PFGE
pattern was defined as one or two DNA bands differing
between PFGE patterns of two isolates. A dendrogram was
generated by the unweighted pairgroup method with
arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm using the Dice-predicted similarity value of two Xbal-digested PFGE patterns.
Plasmid profile analysis
Plasmid profiles of each isolate were determined by the
Kado and Liu method [41], and plasmid size was esti-

mated by comparison with the plasmids of two S. Choleraesuis strains: OU7085 (50 kb and 6.6 kb) and OU7526
(50 kb and 90 kb).
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and
antibiotic susceptibility analysis of the MDR-plasmid
Large plasmids (> 50 kb) of 17 AMP and STR-resistant S.
Braenderup isolates were characterized. Plasmid DNA was
purified from resistant wild-type isolates by the alkaline
lysis method [42] and then transformed into the competent E. coli strain pir116 (STRR), which was prepared by
the CaCl2 method. Transformants were selectively grown
on LB agar plates supplemented with AMP (100 μg/ml)
and further tested for resistance to CHL, TET, and KAN,
but not for resistance to STR, since the recipient strain was
inherently resistant to streptomycin. The antibiotic resistance genes blaTEM, aadA, and blaCMY-2, class 1 integron as
well as the insertion sequence IS26 and its related DNA
fragments were amplified using the primers listed in Table
4. The genes blaSHV and blaCTX-M3 and M14 were also detected
by the multiplex method [43]. The R-plasmids of each
transformant were purified by use of the Geneaid Plasmid
Midi Kit (Geneaid, Taiwan) and were digested with HindIII (New England Biolabs, USA) to determine similarity.
Plasmid DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 0.6 % SeaKem GTG agarose gel (Cambrex
Bio Science Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME, USA) at 25 V
for 16 h. The PCR product of class 1 integron was purified
by DNA Clean/Extraction kit (GeneMark, Taiwan) and
sequenced by Mission Biotech co. (Taiwan).

Plasmid conjugation and incompatibility group
Transferability of R plasmids from each RFLP group was
determined by performing the conjugation test following
a previously described method [44] with NAL-resistant S.
Typhimurium LBNP4417 as the recipient strain. Briefly,
0.6 ml of overnight culture of donor strain was mixed
with 1 ml of the overnight recipient strain. Then 1 ml fresh
LB broth was added, and the mixture was incubated at
37°C with shaking at 100 rpm for 4 h. The bacterial solution was diluted at 101, 103, and 105 times with LB broth,
and then 100 μl of the diluted solution was plated on
MacConkey agar supplemented with AMP (100 μg/ml)
and/or NAL (15 μg/ml). Conjugation efficiency was calculated by determining the number of transconjugants relative to the total number of recipients. Four primer sets
were used to amplify the oriT regions of the ColE1, F
(IncFI), R100 (IncFII), and pSC138 (IncI1-like) plasmids
(Table 1). In addition, replicon types of these resistant
plasmids were determined as described by Carattoli et al.
[45].
