Abstract
Background: Orthopoxvirus (OPV) and Parapoxvirus (PPV) have been associated with worldwide
exanthematic outbreaks. Some species of these genera are able to infect humans and domestic
animals, causing serious economic losses and public health impact. Rapid, useful and highly specific
methods are required to detect and epidemiologically monitor such poxviruses. In the present
paper, we describe the development of a nested-multiplex PCR method for the simultaneous
detection of OPV and PPV species directly from exanthematic lesions, with no previous viral
isolation or DNA extraction.
Methods and Results: The OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR was developed based on the
evaluation and combination of published primer sets, and was applied to the detection of the target
pathogens. The method showed high sensitivity, and the specificity was confirmed by amplicon
sequencing. Exanthematic lesion samples collected during bovine vaccinia or contagious ecthyma
outbreaks were submitted to OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR and confirmed its applicability.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the presented multiplex PCR provides a highly robust and
sensitive method to detect OPV and PPV directly from clinical samples. The method can be used
for viral identification and monitoring, especially in areas where OPV and PPV co-circulate.

Background
Orthopoxvirus (OPV) and Parapoxvirus (PPV) consist of
large, enveloped, linear double-stranded DNA viruses,
and are classified as genera of the family Poxviridae [1].
Several species included in these genera are related with
worldwide acute exanthematic disease in humans and
domestic animals, which cause serious economic losses
and impact public health [1,2]. There are three zoonotic
OPV species known, Monkeypox virus (MPXV), Cowpox
virus (CPXV) and Vaccinia virus (VACV), and their presence is associated with an increased number of outbreaks
in Africa, Europe, South America and Asia [3-6]. Similarly,
several zoonotic PPV infections have been noted, and are
caused mainly by Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV),
Orf virus (ORFV) and Pseudocowpox virus (PSCV) [7,8].
Even though humans are susceptible to MPXV, CPXV,
VACV, BPSV, ORFV and PSCV, domestic animals such as
sheep, goats, cats, dogs and dairy cattle can be infected by
some OPV and/or PPV since the host-range of these
viruses is large and incompletely known [9]. OPV and PPV
transmission is usually promoted by fomites or direct
contact, and the infected humans play an important role
in viral spread among domestic animals, especially during
milking and other occupational livestock activities [1,9].
Clinically, the exanthematic lesions caused by zoonotic
OPV and PPV species are very similar, especially in
humans and cows, and these can be critical for diagnosis
in areas with OPV/PPV co-circulation [7,10-12]. Both
OPV and PPV cause local or disseminated vesicular-pustular lesions that are associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, malaise and acute muscle pain [9]. Therefore, the
OPV/PPV differential diagnosis involves serological, virological, microscopical and molecular techniques
[5,7,8,11,13-16]. Although serological methods such as
ELISAs, immunofluorescence assays and neutralization
tests are useful and widely applied to OPV and PPV diagnosis, these techniques cannot differentiate anti-OPV
antibodies resulting from acute infection from anti-OPV
antibodies resulting from a prior vaccination [17]; addi-

tionally, the titer of anti-PPV neutralizing antibodies can
promptly decrease to undetectable levels a few months
after the infection [18]. Though the other molecular diagnostic approaches mentioned are also valuable and specific, they usually require viral isolation and/or DNA
manipulation, and are designed to detect specifically OPV
or PPV.
In the present work, we report the development of a
nested-multiplex PCR system for the sensitive and reliable
detection of OPV and PPV based on the combination and
optimization of published primer sets. We also report its
application for the detection of viruses included in these
genera directly from bovine, ovine, caprine and human
exanthematic lesions with no viral isolation or DNA
manipulation. Sixty-eight clinical samples collected during Brazilian bovine Vaccinia (BV) or contagious ecthyma
(CE) outbreaks were used to evaluate the performance of
the OPV/PPV nested multiplex PCR and confirm its applicability to viral identification and monitoring.

Methods and Results
Multiplex PCR setting and sensitivity tests
The OPV/PPV multiplex PCR was designed based on computer simulation of different combinations of several
published primer pairs, using software available online
[19]. Two exclusive and highly conserved genes were targeted by nested-multiplex PCR: the OPV viral growth factor
(vgf) and the PPV major viral glycoprotein (b2l); these genes
have been widely used in OPV and PPV diagnosis and
phylogenetic analysis (Table 1). The nested-multiplex
PCR was carried out in a two-step reaction protocol. In the
first step, the OPV primers vgfF and vgfR [20] were used in
association with the PPV primers OVB2LF1 and OVB2LR1
[21]. In the nested step, a pair of internal OPV primers
(vgfF2: ACACGGTGACTGTATCCA and vgfR2: CTAATACAAGCATAATAC) were designed from alignment of the
vgf sequences of Brazilian VACV strains (Drumond and
others, data not published) and other available OPV
sequences (GenBank accession nos. [AY243312.1 (VACV-

DQ437590.1 (VARV); AF482758.2 (CPXV)]); these primers were then used in association with the PPV primers
PPP-1 and PPP-4 [7]. Several chemical and thermal conditions were evaluated. The best conditions were established
based on amplicon yield and specificity [corresponding to
the expected fragments of 170 bp (OPV) and 592 pb
(PPV)], described as follows. In the first step, 2 μL of template were added to 18 μL of the PCR reaction mixture
containing 0.4 mM of OPV primers (VGF-F and VGF-R),
0.8 mM of PPV primers (OVB2LF1 and OVB2LR1), 10
mM dNTPs, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 500 ng Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega,
Madison, USA), using the manufacturer's supplied 10×
buffer. Reactions were performed with a DNA Mastercycler Epgradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using
the following protocol: incubation at 95°C for 9 min; 30
cycles of denaturation (94°C, 1 min), annealing (45°C, 1
min) and extension (72°C, 1 min); final extension (72°C,
10 min). The nested PCR step was carried out using 1 μL
of undiluted first PCR product as template. The same
chemical and thermal conditions were used, but using
internal OPV (vgfF2 and vgfR2 - 0.4 mM) and PPV (PPP1 and PPP-4 - 0.8 mM) primers. The PCR products were
electrophoresed on 8% PAGE gels and silver stained [22].
These same conditions were used in sensitivity tests. Some
reactions were performed with the addition of both PPV
and OPV scabs, with the purpose of simulating a possible
co-infection. In order to confirm the OPV/PPV specificity,
other exanthematic infectious agents were submitted to
PCR: (i) a Bovine herpes virus positive scab kindly provided by Dr. Z. Lobato (Minas Gerais Federal University,
Brazil), and (ii) a Brazilian Sthaphylococcus aureus strain,
isolated from a hospital infection, kindly provided by Dr.
L. Parucker (Santa Catarina Federal University, Brazil).
The PCR sensitivity tests were performed using serial dilutions of the vgf and b2l external fragments cloned in the
pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). These
constructs were obtained by PCR amplification [20,21]
from BV and CE outbreaks exanthematic lesions, followed
by purification of the PCR products (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit - QIAGEN, California - U.S.A.) and cloning into
the pGEM-T easy vector. Three clones of each sample were
sequenced in both orientations using M13 universal primers (Mega-BACE sequencer, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and confirmed the PCR specificity. The vgf and
b2l fragments were quantified (ND1000 spectrophotometer, Thermofisher Scientific - Massachusetts, U.S.A.) and
submitted to OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR under distinct concentrations - 50, 25, 10, 5, 2 and 1 ng. The PCR
products were electrophoresed on 8% PAGE gels and silver stained [22].

Fragments of approximately 170 bp and 592 bp that correspond to the vgf and b2l genes, respectively, were specifically amplified best by PCR under the described thermal
and chemical conditions (Figure 1-A). The amplified fragment sequences showed 100% identity with the VACV vgf
gene (AY2433121 and others) or the ORFV b2l gene
(FJ665818 and others). Reactions in which OPV and PPV
scabs were added presented the amplification of both
the170 and 592 bp fragments. No specific viral bands
were observed in the negative control or in the in Bovine
herpes virus and S. aureus reactions. Sensitivity tests using
vgf or b2l cloned fragments presented unique and specific
amplified bands of approximately 170 bp and 592 bp,

respectively. In both cases, the PCR was able to detect
until 1 ng of viral DNA fragment (Figure 1-B). No specific
viral bands were observed in sensitivity test negative controls.
Nested-multiplex applicability tests: clinical samples from
exanthematic outbreaks
Vesicle contents and dried scabs from cattle udders and
milkers' hands were collected during Brazilian BV outbreaks or from sheep and goats during CE outbreaks. This
collection was accomplished using 1-ml insulin syringes,
0.45 mm×13 mm needles, and cotton swabs or a pair of
forceps. Collected samples were chilled, transported to the
laboratory, and stored at -70°C until processed. Vesicular
liquid swabs were added to 200 μL of PBS and centrifuged
at 2000 × g for 3 min. Scabs were macerated by a homogenizer (Politron, Littau, Switzerland) in PBS (0.1 g scab/
0.9 mL PBS) and clarified by centrifugation at 2000 × g for
3 min. Two microliters of the supernatants were used in
the nested-multiplex PCR. Some expected PCR products
were directly sequenced (ET Dynamic Terminator for
MegaBACE - GE Healthcare, Fairfield, USA) and compared with available GenBank sequences using an online
blast program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast. To
avoid any possibility of laboratory cross-contamination,
the different samples were manipulated separately.

A total of 64 clinical samples were collected and then submitted to OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR (Table 2). Of
these samples, 56 were collected during BV outbreaks (36

from bovines and 20 from humans) and 8 samples were
collected during CE outbreaks (3 from caprines and 5
from ovines). All collected BV and CE clinical samples
were previously tested by other molecular methods (Fonseca et al., 1998; Inoshima et al., 2000) and were confirmed VACV and ORFV infections, respectively. Among
the BV clinical samples, the OPV/PPV nested-multiplex
PCR detected OPV DNA in 53 scabs/vesicles (94.4%). The
multiplex was able to detect PPV DNA in all analyzed CE
clinical samples. Considering all bovine, human, ovine
and caprine samples, the nested-multiplex PCR presented
a positivity of 95.3%. The sequences of the amplified fragments again confirmed the PCR specificity, showing high
identity with the VACV vgf gene or the ORFV b2l gene
sequences. No co-infection case was detected in this
molecular screening.

Conclusion
In the present work, the creation of a multiplex PCR
method for the simultaneous detection of OPV and PPV
has been described and tested with exanthematic clinical
samples from distinct viral hosts, with no DNA extraction
or virus manipulation. The method proposed was able to
correctly identify the target pathogens by amplification of
conserved genes, even in co-infection simulations. The
primer selection and multiplex optimization allowed the
creation of a robust method, with performances comparable to conventional one-pathogen PCR assays [7,20]. The
sequencing of vgf and b2l amplicons confirmed the specificity of the nested-multiplex approach. The sensitivity and
