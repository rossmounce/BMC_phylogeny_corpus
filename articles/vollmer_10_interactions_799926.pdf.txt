Interactions between endocarditis-derived
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
isolates and human endothelial cells
Tanja Vollmer, Dennis Hinse, Knut Kleesiek, Jens Dreier*

Abstract
Background: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infective endocarditis
(IE) but the knowledge on virulence factors is limited and the pathogenesis of the infection is poorly understood.
In the present study, we established an experimental in vitro IE cell culture model using EA.hy926 and HUVEC cells
to investigate the adhesion and invasion characteristics of 23 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains
from different origins (human IE-derived isolates, other human clinical isolates, animal isolates). Adhesion to eight
components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the ability to form biofilms in vitro was examined in order to
reveal features of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus endothelial infection. In addition, the strains were analyzed for
the presence of the three virulence factors gtf, pilB, and fimB by PCR.
Results: The adherence to and invasion characteristics of the examined S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains to
the endothelial cell line EA.hy926 differ significantly among themselves. In contrast, the usage of three different in
vitro models (EA.hy926 cells, primary endothelial cells (HUVECs), mechanical stretched cells) revealed no differences
regarding the adherence to and invasion characteristics of different strains. Adherence to the ECM proteins
collagen I, II and IV revealed the highest values, followed by fibrinogen, tenascin and laminin. Moreover, a strong
correlation was observed in binding to these proteins by the analyzed strains. All strains show the capability to
adhere to polystyrole surfaces and form biofilms. We further confirmed the presence of the genes of two known
virulence factors (fimB: all strains, gtf: 19 of 23 strains) and demonstrated the presence of the gene of one new
putative virulence factor (pilB: 9 of 23 strains) by PCR.
Conclusion: Our study provides the first description of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus adhesion and invasion of
human endothelial cells, revealing important initial information of strain variability, behaviour and characteristics of
this as yet barely analyzed pathogen.

Background
Viridans streptococci are the most important pathogens
responsible for native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in
non-drug-addicted patients [1]. However, Streptococcus
gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, formerly referred to as
Streptococcus bovis biotype I, a member of group D
streptococci, was estimated to be the causative agent in
24% of streptococcal endocarditis [2]. S. gallolyticus
subsp. gallolyticus belongs to the S. bovis-complex
including different species frequently isolated from
humans and animals (S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S.

Diabeteszentrum Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany

infantarius, S. equinus, S. alactolyticus). The taxonomic
classification of this group of streptococci was often
revised. However, at the beginning of this decade, Schlegel et al. proposed the reclassification of S. bovis biotype
I as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus based on genetic,
physiologic and phylogenetic perceptions [3], which was
recently confirmed in a large comprehensive study [4].
Therefore, the highest priority regarding the clinical significance must refer to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
instead of S. bovis. Particularly in Southern Europe, the
proportion of endocarditis caused by group D streptococci increased over the recent years [5,6]. Hoen et al.
documented that 58% (France), 9.4% (other European
countries) and 16.7% (USA) of streptococcal IE cases

were caused by S. bovis [6]. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a normal inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract and numerous reports, referring to S. bovis,
demonstrated an association between IE and gastrointestinal neoplasia, which were in most cases colonic adenoma or carcinoma [7-9] as well as liver disease [10,11].
Either the underlying colonic disease or an altered hepatic function may promote the bacterial translocation
during the initial phase of infection [10].
Pathogenesis and several virulence factors have been
examined for viridans streptococci, yet the knowledge of
similar mechanisms for S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
is limited. Studies examined the adhesion of animal isolates from pigeons to immobilized matrix proteins [12],
and characterized virulence-associated surface proteins
[13-15]. Recently, Sillanpää et al. observed a difference
in adherence to distinct host extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins of endocarditis-derived S. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus isolates [2]. Until now, analogue mechanisms
of human isolates regarding the adhesion to or invasion
of endothelial cells, as well as defined virulence genes
are unknown. Viridans streptococci have been shown to
adhere to human endothelial cells in vitro [16,17] and
numerous host cell factors and bacterial components
have been identified as possible virulence factor candidates in other streptococci [18]. For example, a group of
streptococcal genes encoding several adhesins (fimA,
fimB, ssaB, scaA, psaA) play important roles in the
development of IE [19-21]. It has also been shown that
pilB contributes to adherence to endothelial cells in
groupB streptococci and over-expression leads to
increased virulence in rats [22,23].
Glycosyltransferases (gtf), which are responsible for the
synthesis of glucans, are known to be major cell surface
proteins involved in adherence of Streptococcus gordonii
to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in
vitro [24]. Glycosyltransferases are further involved in
the adhesion to human endothelial cells [24] and modulate cellular cytokine induction in IE [25,26]. Biofilm
formation in vitro is also strongly influenced by the
amount of Gtf produced by S. mutans [27,28]. The role
of biofilm formation in IE remains open, with some studies reporting a lack of association [29,30] and other
studies proposing a considerable importance [31].
Endothelial matrix proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen and laminin, have also been
shown to serve as receptors for bacterial surface proteins which promote bacterial adherence to host cells
[32-37].
In the present study, an in vitro cell culture model was
established to analyze the capability of human S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus endocarditis isolates to adhere
to and invade endothelial cells in comparison to nonendocarditis associated strains. Furthermore, adherence

to immobilized ECM proteins and the ability to form
biofilms in vitro was examined to determine a possible
association with endocarditis virulence. Isolates were
further analyzed for the presence of the virulence associated genes fimB, gtf and pilB.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Bacterial strains listed in Table 1 were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, LGC
Promochem GmbH, Wesel, Germany), the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
GmbH (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) or were previously isolated from patients’ specimens at our hospital.
All clinical isolates used in this study were characterized
in our microbiological laboratory by standard methods.
In addition, molecular genetic strain identification was
performed by sequencing analysis of the superoxide-dismutase gene (sodA) as described previously [38]. Bacteria were grown on tryptone soya (TS) or brain heart
infusion (BHI) agar plates (Oxoid Ltd., Cambridge, UK)
and isolated colonies were used as inocula in TS or BHI
medium. Determination of the bacterial titer was performed by plating on TS agar. For simplification of
readability, S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is consecutively abbreviated to S. gallolyticus.
Cell culture

EA.hy926 cells were derived from the ATCC (Manassas,
USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential
medium (DMEM, Gibco, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 1% L-glutamine (200 mM), supplemented with 10% fetal calve serum (Biowest, Nuaillé,
France) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (100×,
Biowest). Cells were grown at 5% CO 2 and 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere and were used before passage 10
for all experiments. Cryopreserved pooled HUVECs
were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and
grown routinely in EGM-2 medium (EGM-2 BulletKit,
Lonza) at 5% CO2 and 37°C in a humified atmosphere.
Cell culture dishes were previously coated with collagen
I (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany). Cells were utilized
before passage five for all experiments. EA.hy926 and
HUVEC cells were detached using 10% trypsin-EDTA
(Lonza). For the adherence and invasion assays, cells
were transferred after trypsination to 6-well culture
plates and cultivated to confluence. Before infection
with bacteria, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Gibco).
Cell adherence and invasion assay

The assay was performed as described previously with
some modifications [39,40]. Briefly, bacterial cultures
were harvested at late-log phase, washed once with

DPBS and diluted in fresh cell culture medium without
antibiotics. To analyze dose-dependent effects on adhesion and invasion, two millilitres of bacterial suspensions
with inocula between 102 and 107 CFU/mL were added
to each well containing a monolayer of EA.hy926 or
HUVEC cells, respectively. For the comparison of adhesion and invasion efficacy of different S. gallolyticus
strains, cells were infected with 1 - 9 × 105 CFU/mL.
The 6-well plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C and
5% CO 2 to facilitate cell infection. For the adherence
assay, the cell monolayer was washed five times with
DPBS, and endothelial cells were trypsinized and lysed
with 1 mL 10% Trypsin-EDTA in distilled water. Trypsin-reaction was stopped with an equal volume of cell

culture medium without antibiotics. 100 μL from each
well were plated onto TS agar and incubated overnight
at 37°C. For the invasion assay, the monolayer was
washed three times with DPBS. Two millilitres of cell
culture medium supplemented with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and 100 μg/mL gentamicin (Gibco)
were added to each well. The 6-well plates were incubated for another 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 to kill extracellular and surface-adherent bacteria. Afterwards, the
monolayers were washed three times with DPBS and
bacteria were quantified as described for the adherence
assay. Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated
twice. For comparative reasons, isolate 21702 was used
as an internal assay control in every assay. Antibiotic

efficacy of the invasion assay was tested for all strains
with concentrations of 107 CFU/mL in pure cell culture
medium, confirming that no viable bacteria were present
after 2 h incubation (data not shown).
Mechanical stretch

Cultures of EA.hy926 were subjected to cyclic tension
using a FlexCell vacuum system (FlexCell, Dunn Laboratories, Hillsborough, USA). Cells were cultured on BioFlex culture plates (FlexCell) coated with collagen I in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 72 h.
Afterwards cultures were stretched by 10% with a frequency of 1 Hz in a square wave pattern for another
24 h. EA.hy926 from the same preparation and cultured
without mechanical stretch were used as controls.
Stretched cells and controls were infected immediately
after completion of mechanical stretch as described
above.
Biofilm assay

The biofilm assay used in this study was performed as
described previously [30] with the following modifications: absorbance was measured using the GENios Plate
Reader (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany) at 450 nm (total bacterial growth) and 550 nm
(crystal violet (CV), biofilm formation). Each strain was
assayed in quintuplicate.

factors of S. gallolyticus fimB and gtf and to amplify a
homolog of the pilB gene identified in S. suis (Table 2).
DNA amplification was carried out in 0.2 mL tubes containing 45 μL reaction mix and 5 μL DNA extract. The
reaction mix consisted of 1× HotMaster Taq buffer
including 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, 100
nM of each primer and 1.25 U of HotMaster Taq DNA
polymerase (5 Prime, Inc., Gaithersburg, USA). The
PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at
94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 30 s, PCR-product specific annealing temperature (Table 2) for 60 s and extension at 72°C for 60 s,
followed by a final elongation for 10 min at 72°C. PCR
products were sequenced for identification as described
previously [41].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using One-wayANOVA, the Mann-Whitney-U-test and the student’s ttest where appropriate. Multiple testing correction was
performed using the Bonferroni method. Normality testing of all data sets for Gaussian distribution was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We used
Spearman correlation coefficients to assess correlations
between variables. P values < 0.01 were considered significant. All values are given as mean values (± SD). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

ECM assay

96 well microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/mL
fibrinogen (human plasma, Sigma). Microtiter plates
precoated with collagen I, collagen II, collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin, tenascin and vitronectin were purchased
from Chemicon (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).
Wells coated with BSA were used as negative controls
and values were subtracted. Late-log-phase cultures of
bacteria were inoculated into 100 μL BHI medium
(Oxoid) and incubated on pre-coated wells without agitation for 2 h at 37°C. Subsequently, wells were washed
twice with DPBS and dried for 20 min at 60°C. In parallel, bacteria were plated onto BHI agar and incubated
overnight at 37°C. Attached bacteria were stained with
100 μL of 0.4% CV at room temperature for 45 min.
Wells were rinsed five times with PBS and air dried. CV
was solubilized in 100 μL ethanol (99%), and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Each strain was assayed
in quadruplicate for the different ECM proteins.
PCR analysis

Bacteria were harvested from overnight grown cultures
and bacterial DNA was extracted using the QIAamp
DNA Blood Kit (protocol D, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primers were designed to amplify the known virulence

Results
Identification of virulence genes and occurrence of
intestinal abnormalities

All strains analyzed in this study were identified as S.
gallolyticus by sequencing analysis of the sodA gene
(GenBank accession no. Table 1). Table 1 displays the
distribution of the analyzed S. gallolyticus virulence
genes fimB, gtf and pilB among 23 different strains. The
known virulence gene fimB was detected in all analyzed
strains, whereas four strains showed no positive PCR
signal for gtf. The occurrence of a partial sequence
homolog of the pilB gene, originally identified in S. suis,
was proven in 9 strains of S. gallolyticus (GenBank
accession no. for S. gallolyticus partial pilB sequence:
FJ555059). Sequencing analysis confirmed the gene as
pilB with a high similarity of 98% to S. suis pilB. PCR
screening results were confirmed by Southern-Blot analysis with total genomic DNA and Digoxigenin-labeled
PCR products (data not shown).
Analysis of the corresponding patient information of
eight isolates revealed two patients exhibiting colonic
malignancies, three patients with intestinal abnormalities
and three patients without evidence of intestinal
abnormalities (Table 1). For the other eleven human
clinical isolates, patient data was not available because

isolates were obtained from other institutes and repeatedly characterized in our microbiological laboratory.
Adhesion to and invasion of EA.hy926 cells

All strains started to grow after 3 h of incubation in
DMEM at 37°C and 5% CO 2 at the earliest (data not
shown). Therefore, incubation time for adhesion was
determined to 2 h to avoid false-high titers as a result of
bacterial growth kinetics. Three strains representing different adherence and invasion potentials, namely strain
DSM 16831 (low adhesion, no invasion), isolate 21702
(intermediate adhesion and invasion) and isolate 05950
(high adhesion and invasion), were chosen to exemplify
the dose-dependent effects on adhesion and invasion to
EA.hy926 cells (Fig. 1). The proportion of adhesive and
invasive bacteria did not increase using higher bacterial
concentrations, with both, the adhesiveness and the
invasiveness of the different bacteria showing a linear
progress. Remarkably, strain DSM 16831 did not have
the potential to invade cells, even when higher bacterial
concentrations were used for infection. Subsequently, all
S. gallolyticus strains were compared regarding their
adhesion and invasion characteristics to EA.hy926 cells
(Fig. 2). As a result of the observed linear progress and
for strain comparability the initial inocula were calculated to 1 × 105 CFU/mL, and consequently adhesion
and invasion values were factorized. Generally, all the S.
gallolyticus strains analyzed were able to adhere to EA.
hy926 endothelial cells (range 103-104 recovered CFU/
mL) and significant differences were observed among
the investigated strains (repeated measures anova, P <
0.0001). Consideration of the individual strains revealed
that isolates 13366, K6236 and AC1016 presented the
most frequently significances (Fig. 2). With the exception of strain DSM 16831, which was excluded in
further statistical analysis regarding invasion characteristics, all S. gallolyticus strains also had the capacity to
invade EA.hy926 cells (range 101 - 103 recovered CFU/
mL) with significant differences (repeated measures
anova, P < 0.0001). A closer look on variation between
individual strains disclosed, that the potential of invasion
of the two strains DSM 13808 and isolate 05950 demonstrated numerous significances overall (DSM 13808: 17

strains, P < 0.001; isolate 05950: five strains, P < 0.001
and seven strains P < 0.01, Fig. 2). Correlation analysis
of adherence and invasion showed a strong correlation
for all strains (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r =
0.673, P = 0.0003). A considerable difference in the
adherence or invasion potential of endocarditis isolates
and reference strains was not observed. However, five
strains illustrate noticeable characteristics (Fig. 2). Strain
DSM 16831 has a considerably low ability of adherence
and no ability of invasion. In comparison to isolates
characterized as common, isolate AC6827 has a low
adherence and invasion, whereas isolate 134257 exposed
only a low adherence. Strain DSM 13808 and isolate
05950 revealed standard adhesive characteristics but the
invasion capacity was considerably higher compared to
the other isolates. Correlation analysis of adherence to
or invasion of endothelial cells and the number of present virulence genes revealed no correlation: (a) three
virulence genes versus two virulence genes: Padhesion =
0.35, P invasion = 0.12, (b) three virulence genes versus
one virulence gene: P adhesion = 0.08, P invasion = 0.19
and (c) two virulence genes versus one virulence gene:
Padhesion = 0.27, Pinvasion = 0.81.
Influence of cell type and cell condition on the adherence
and invasion characteristics

Fig. 3 shows the adherence to and invasion of EA.hy926
and HUVECs for six bacterial strains with different
adhesion and invasion potentials. The comparison of the
two different cell types revealed no discrepancy between
adhesion and invasion (P > 0.01). Therefore, the cell line
EA.hy926 was chosen for further studies of S. gallolyticus infection of endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the
adherence and invasion characteristics of S. gallolyticus
to EA.hy926 are likewise comparable between mechanical stretched and untreated cells. However, isolates
13366, 05950, 49147 and 06718 show the tendency of a
marginally decreased invasion to mechanical stretched
cells.
Binding to ECM proteins and biofilm formation

For evaluation of the ability of S. gallolyticus strains to
adhere to host ECM proteins, we analyzed adherence to

collagen types I, II, IV, fibronectin, laminin, tenascin,
vitronectin and fibrinogen (Fig. 4). Adherent bacteria
were stained with CV, and parallel plating onto BHI
agar confirmed the initial bacterial titer to 108 CFU/mL
for all 23 strains tested. After correction with BSA negative control values, values of OD 550 > 0.1 were

considered adherent. Mean values of the three different
collagen types did not differ significantly. Adherence to
collagen I showed the highest values (mean 0.53
(± 0.28)), followed by collagen II (mean 0.45 (± 0.27)),
collagen IV (mean 0.38 (± 0.24)), fibrinogen (mean 0.37
(± 0.52)), tenascin (mean 0.25 (± 0.21)) and laminin

(mean 0.20 (± 0.19)). Accordingly, the proportion of
non-adherent strains increased almost in this order.
One strain was unable to adhere to collagen II and IV,
whereas five strains did not adhere to fibrinogen, and
seven strains did not adhere to laminin or tenascin.
Binding to fibronectin and vitronectin revealed the highest proportion of non-adherent strains (fibronectin: n =
16, vitronectin: n = 18) and the observed adherence was
relatively low. Individual strain correlation analysis
between adherence to endothelial cells and ECM proteins showed no correlation. In contrast, analysis of the
adherence of different ECM proteins showed a strong
correlation (P < 0.0001) for the following nine protein
combinations: (a) collagen I versus collagen II, IV, laminin and tenascin, respectively; (b) collagen II versus collagen IV, laminin and tenascin, respectively; (c) collagen
IV versus tenascin and (d) laminin versus tenascin (Fig.
4). A correlation of moderate strength was found for the
protein combination collagen IV and laminin (P <
0.001). No correlation was observed for protein combinations including fibronectin, vitronectin or fibrinogen.
The ability of adherence to ECM proteins showed a tendency to cluster in certain isolates, e.g. strains with high

efficiency of binding to the three different collagen types
also showed a strong adherence to laminin and tenascin.
Two strains exhibited a considerably higher adherence;
isolate AC1181 had a high adherence to collagen I/II/
IV, laminin and tenascin, whereas isolate AC7070 had a
high adherence to fibrinogen, vitronectin and
fibronectin.
The analysis of biofilm formation demonstrated that
all strains have the capability to adhere to polystyrene
surfaces and form biofilms (Fig. 4). Isolates 10672,
AC1135 and strain DSM 16831 revealed the highest biofilm formation; remarkably, strain DSM 16831 had no
capacity to invade cells. Correlation analysis of adherence to or invasion of endothelial cells and biofilm formation revealed no correlation. Additionally, no
correlation was found between adherence to different
ECM proteins and biofilm formation.

Discussion and Conclusions
S. gallolyticus is an important pathogen with an underestimated relevance causing IE. The frequent changes in
the taxonomy resulted in an inadequate or incorrect
identification of the causative pathogens, because non-

experts were often not aware of the new nomenclature
(e.g. [42]). In contrast to other streptococci, little is
known about virulence factors and pathogenesis. The
adherence of circulating bacteria to damaged heart tissues and subsequent colonization and persistence of
bacteria are the crucial factors in streptococcal IE. The
prevention of tissue colonization, with special attention
to targeting therapy against ECM-binding, potentially
provides a promising alternative in human medicine
[43]. Therefore, we analyzed the factors which contribute to S. gallolyticus adhesion and invasion in IE using
an experimental in vitro cell culture model. Investigation
of the adhesion to ECM proteins identified or confirmed
putative adhesive sites on the endothelial cell surface.

Additionally, virulence factors were detected and biofilm
formation was analyzed in order to identify different
strain characteristics.
Most S. gallolyticus strains tested in this study adhere
to and invade endothelial cells. The diversity in adhesion
and invasion characteristics appears considerably higher
for invasion. Strain DSM 16831 exclusively demonstrated no invasive capability. Invasion was also not
induced using higher concentrations of bacteria, usage
of primary endothelial cells or mechanical stretched
cells. In contrast, strain DSM 13808 present a considerably high invasion. The distinct behaviour of these two
strains may be due to the fact that they were the only
strains tested that were isolated from non-human

sources. In general, the observed differences may reflect
distinctions in the bacterial equipment with virulence
factors or gene expression of virulence factors. We have
shown that isolate represent a different distribution of
the virulence-associated genes gtf, fimB and pilB. However, the presence of a putative virulence gene does not
necessarily indicate expression. For example, Stipp et al.
observed variability at different phases of planktonic
growth in gtfB and gtfC gene expression [44]. Furthermore, the gene integrity has to be proven. To correlate
virulence with the expression of gtf, fimB and pilB, these
factors have to be deleted by the construction of knockout mutants to determine difference in the ability to
form biofilms, the adherence to and invasion of host
cells and the adherence to ECM proteins. This will
show the impact of these factors on binding to host
cells and most likely correlate with the bacterial potential to cause IE. In addition, the determined virulence
factors reflected only a small proportion of the presumably high quantity of possible virulence factors in S. gallolyticus. Accordingly, the absence of a correlation
between the potential to adhere to as well as to invade
cells and the number of the existing putative virulence
genes most likely could also be explained by these
reasons.
The role of biofilm formation in IE remains ambiguous. Several studies demonstrated an association

between biofilm formation and streptococcal IE [45-47],
whereas another study indicated that the ability to form
biofilms in vitro is not associated with endocarditis virulence [30]. The results of our study support the lack of
association between biofilm formation and adherence to
or invasion of endothelial cells and adherence to ECM
proteins.
Most IE patients have valve abnormalities, resulting in
the exposure of ECM proteins, the production of tissue
factor and the deposition of fibrin and platelets promoting bacterial colonization. Streptococcal adherence to
endothelial matrix proteins has previously been shown
to be an important factor for the infection of host tissues [32-37,48]. Recently, Sillanpää et al. analyzed endocarditis-derived human isolates of S. gallolyticus and,
according to the results obtained in our study, binding
to collagen I was found to be the most common phenotype, followed by collagen type IV, fibrinogen and fibronectin [2]. In contrast, both studies revealed a weak
binding to fibronectin, which is contradictory to studies
observing a direct connection between adherence to
fibronectin and the applicability of S. sanguis to induce
IE [49]. This observation possibly indicates a different
pathogenesis of S. gallolyticus IE. Interestingly, a study
of animal isolates of S. gallolyticus revealed no adherence to collagen I [12]. Further analysis of the draft
genome sequence of an ECM protein-adherent

S. gallolyticus strain by Sillanpää et al. revealed 11 predicted LPXTG-type cell-wall-anchored proteins with
characteristics of MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), including the “adhesin to collagen of the S. bovis group” (acb)
gene [50]. Remarkably, a recombinant Acb protein
showed high affinity binding to immobilized collagen.
Cell surface expression of Acb correlated with the presence of acb and collagen adherence of different isolates.
Therefore, the authors concluded that the high prevalence of this collagen-binding MSCRAMM among S.
gallolyticus may play an important role in the predominance of this subspecies in S. bovis complex
endocarditis.
The endothelial cell line EA.hy926 displays highly differentiated characteristics of human vascular endothelial
[51] whereas primary endothelial cells such as HUVECs
presumably provide the most accurate cell type based
reflection of the in vivo situation. However, we observed
no difference in the adhesion and invasion characteristics of S. gallolyticus using these two cell lines. Consequently, the usage of endothelial cell lines seems to be
an equivalent experimental in vitro model, with the
major advantage of easier handling compared to primary
cells. Nonetheless, it has to be noted that cell monolayers of either cell lines or primary cells only provide a
two-dimensional model, whereas the in vivo situation in
tissue is three-dimensional.
The intact endothelium is usually resistant to colonization by streptococci [18]. In the present study,
mechanical stress of endothelial monolayer does not
increase the proportion of adherent or invasive bacteria.
This data is an indication for active colonization of
valve tissue by S. gallolyticus. However, the results have
to be interpreted with caution. We cannot exclude the
possibility that mechanical stretch does not significantly
increase the degree of stress on the potentially damaged
cell monolayer. In addition, monolayers probably do not
exhibit a physically intact endothelium since two-dimensional cultivation or contact-inhibition perhaps affected
the endothelial cells. Therefore, further studies are warranted to figure out the degree of monolayer integrity
and the dimension of cell damage before and after
mechanical stretch.
The data of our study demonstrates that there is no
evidence for the correlation between adherence to or
invasion of endothelial cells, the adherence of bacteria
to ECM proteins and biofilm formation. Therefore several other factors have to be investigated to determine
their role in the infection of endothelial cells by S. gallolyticus isolates. These factors might include the capsule
structure [52], interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycans [53], presence of fimbriae or production of toxins [15]. It has been shown that S. gallolyticus is capable

Page 10 of 12

to produce capsular material [15] and the amount of
capsule produced most likely influence the capacity to
adhere to the cells. Hence, analysis of further pathomechanisms beneath adhesion, invasion and biofilm formation characteristics as well as the identification of
further putative virulence genes is crucial for a better
understanding of the mechanisms of S. gallolyticus
infection. Our future investigations will address the
transcriptional analysis of known virulence factors, the
identification and characterization of further putative
virulence genes by sequencing the whole genome of S.
gallolyticus and knock-out mutation experiments to
determine the influence of individual gene function in
the pathogenesis of IE. As a result of the distinct behaviour of the isolates from non-human sources, we will
also focus on the comparison of human and animal isolates to further elaborate potential differences in infection mechanisms. The specific clinical association with
gastrointestinal neoplasia due to S. bovis biotype I or S.
gallolyticus, respectively [7-9] strongly imply that S. gallolyticus enter the human body via the gastrointestinal
tract through sites with decreased intestinal barrier
function such as colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, a
correlation between the number of existing virulence
genes, biofilm formation, invasion and adhesion characteristics with the presence or absence of colonic malignancies can barely be created with the small number of
available patient data at present. Indeed, the bacterial
translocation is the first important step in the development of IE before colonizing the endothelium, and
mechanisms of adherence to and invasion of epithelial
cells play an important role during this initial phase of
infection. Therefore, our future investigations will also
address this important mechanism to potentially disclose
clues on specific features of individual S. gallolyticus
strains.
In conclusion, this is the first description of S. gallolyticus adhesion to and invasion of human endothelial
cells. The established in vitro model provides a convenient system to evaluate differences in the virulence
characteristics of different strains. Binding to ECM
proteins and biofilm formation provide additional
information for strain characterization. The first identification of a possible pilus-associated gene in S. gallolyticus supplemented the so far limited availability of
possible virulence factors. This study provides important initial characterization of variability and behaviour
of the as yet barely analyzed endocarditis pathogen S.
gallolyticus.
