Abstract
Background: A new respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
broke out and spread throughout the world. By now the putative pathogen of SARS has been
identified as a new coronavirus, a single positive-strand RNA virus. RNA viruses commonly have a
high rate of genetic mutation. It is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the SARS
coronavirus as it spreads through the population. Moreover, finding a date for the last common
ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances
surrounding the emergence of the SARS pandemic and the rate at which SARS coronavirus diverge.
Methods: We propose a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the SARS
coronavirus genome and the time of the last common ancestor of the sequenced SARS strains.
Under some common assumptions and justifiable simplifications, a few simple equations
incorporating the evolution rate (K) and time of the last common ancestor of the strains (T0) can
be deduced. We then implemented the least square method to estimate K and T0 from the dataset
of sequences and corresponding times. Monte Carlo stimulation was employed to discuss the
results.
Results: Based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death, we estimated the time of the last
common ancestor to be about August or September 2002, and the evolution rate to be about 0.16
base/day, that is, the SARS coronavirus would on average change a base every seven days. We
validated our method by dividing the strains into two groups, which coincided with the results from
comparative genomics.
Conclusion: The applied method is simple to implement and avoid the difficulty and subjectivity
of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree. Based on 6 strains with accurate date of host death, we
estimated a time of the last common ancestor, which is coincident with epidemic investigations,
and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the HIV-1 virus.

Background

Methods

A new respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out and spread throughout
the world, affecting over 8,000 individuals in 32 countries[1,2]. In response to this outbreak, a global network
of international collaborating laboratories was immediately sponsored and established by World Health Organization (WHO) to facilitate the identification of the
causative agent of SARS. By now the putative pathogen of
SARS has been identified, by experimental proof and by
Koch's postulates, as a new coronavirus, a single positivestrand RNA virus [3-5]]. The whole genome of SARS coronavirus was first sequenced by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Canada on 23, April
2003 [6], and subsequently a total of 16 SARS coronavirus
strains isolated from Hanoi, mainland China, Hong
Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were sequenced within
short time[7,8]. Phylogenetic analysis and comparative
genomic studies based on these genomic sequences indicate that the SARS coronavirus is distinct from any of the
previously characterized coronaviruses. Epidemiological
investigations further indicate the SARS coronavirus
strains may be divided into two different genotypes[9].

Among the 16 full-length SARS coronavirus genomes, we
selected 6 strains for which the accurate date of host death
is known, and on which our modelling was based. Our
model performed calculation under two hypotheses,
which are commonly adopted and have lead to accurate
prediction in the study of HIV-1 virus [10]: first, nucleotide variation of these strains occurred by independent
mutations at random positions in a single ancestral
sequence; second, there exist a molecular clock and a constant rate of evolution. In addition, we simplified the calculation by neglecting trivial non-linear effects of multimutation for a base, i.e. there has only been one mutation
for a base at a specific position of all the sequences during
SARS infection time. This simplification can be justified
by further discussion (see Additional file: 1).

RNA viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation, by which the viruses escape from host defence and
evolve into novel viral strains. It is therefore important to
know the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus as it
spreads through the population. Moreover, finding a date
for the last common ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains
would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the SARS pandemic and the
rate at which SARS coronavirus diverge.
Many attempts have been made to extrapolate the age of
the common ancestor of sequenced genomes. Most of
them are based on accurate phylogenetic tree reconstructions, which demand a large amount computation,
because of their application of the maximum likelihood
strategy. Common for these methods is that it is critical to
choose a sequence as the root of the phylogenetic tree.
Korber et al. [10] implemented a parsimonious strategy,
which used the consensus sequence including the most
common bases appearing in strains as the ancestral
sequence.

For an ancestor sequence S0 of a strain S, we can deduce
for the assumptions above that
E(D(S0, S)) ≈ K(T - T0),
where D(S0, S) is difference of the two sequences (as
depicted by Hamming distance), T0 is the date of the last
ancestor, T is the date of host death (as an estimate of
sampling date), and K is the evolution rate constant. The
formula gives the expectation of sequence differences in
proportion to the time of evolution.
If S0 is the last common ancestor of S and S', then we have
E(D(S,S')) = E(D(S0,S)) + E(D(S0,S')) (Fig. 1(a)). The
equation takes this form under the simplification that
along the total of the infection paths of the two sequences,
mutation at any specific point of the sequences could, at
most, only occur once. Thus E(D(S,S')) ≈ K(T + T' - 2T0).
The last common ancestor S0 of all the sequences is the
root of the hidden phylogenetic tree with the strains as
nodes. From the time T0, the sequences should at least
evolve along two different routes. Therefore, there should
be a partition of the strains into B and B' such that every
pair of strains S ∈ B and S' ∈ B' should share the root of
the tree as their last common ancestor (Fig. 1(b)), i.e., for
each pair <S, S'>, E(D(S,S')) should be linear to (T + T')

From the time of the last common ancestor S0 of the other
sequences, every base of a given sequence has the possibility to mutate over time according to the given evolution
rate. So the other sequences, included intermediate
sequences (I) and final sequences (F), can be obtained in
steps in the stimulation according to the given phylogenetic tree and the time parameters. After the sequences
were obtained, we used our fitting method to get the evolution rate, without including the hidden parameters. By
analysis of the estimated K from the data, we can get to
know how the parameters affect our fitting results and the
quality of our method.

with same parameter T0. Therefore, we can implement the
least square method to estimate K and T0 from the dataset.
Since the real partition cannot be known in advance, we
carried out calculations for all of the possible partitions of
these 6 strains. For each division we use the estimated K to
calculate the possible T0(S,S') of each sequence pair. The
division with the minimum variance of T0(S,S') is taken as
our best solution to the problem, and the corresponding
K as an estimation of the mutation rate.
To analyze how the parameters affect the results and support our fitting method, the Monte Carlo method was
employed. At first, we produced a phylogenetic tree (See

Of the 16 SARS coronavirus strains submitted to Genbank
before June, 2003, 6 had accurate date of host death
recorded. We chose these 6 to estimate the last common
ancestor and the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus
(Table 1). We performed the calculation, and the fitting
result of the best division (See Table 2) is shown in Fig. 2,
including the differences between sequences D(S,S') versus the time factor (T + T'). The evolution rate K was estimated to be 0.16 base/day, which is similar to the
reported evolution rate of HIV-1 virus [10]. The date of the
last common ancestor T0 was found to be about August or
September, 2002, which is also in accordance with the
epidemic investigations finding that the first verifiable
SARS case was reported as early as on November 11, 2002.
We validated our estimation of the evolutionary rate by
grouping strains according to the estimated date of their

(shown in Fig 3) is in support of our fitting method, as in
both models the estimates for the evolutionary rate converged on the set parameter (0.2). Model 2 with wide time
distribution had a narrower distribution of K, which indicates the fitted parameter has a smaller error. The difference between the two models hints a narrow sampling
time window as a partially explanation of the large error
on the estimated K for the real data.

pair wise last common ancestor. Applying the estimated K
= 0.16, we can determine a date T0*(i, j) of the last common ancestor for each pair <Si, Sj> by E(D(S,S)) = K(Ti +
Tj - 2T0*(i, j)) [Table 2], and then divide the 6 into two
groups, G1 = {BJ01, BJ02, GZ01} and G2 =
{TOR2,SIN2500,US}. It is apparent that every two members in G1 have a last common ancestor with a date T0*(i,
j) > 0, while every two members in G2 have corresponding
T0*(i, j) < 0. This would imply that the strains in G1 have
a more recent last common ancestor than those in G2. This
partition of strains was supported by Ruan et al [9].

Discussion
Analysis by Monte Carlo Method was employed to test
our fitting method and explain why the error of the evolution rate and time of last common ancestor was so large in
our prediction. In a simulation of the simplified evolution
model, sequences were generated according to a given
phylogenetic tree, with parameters including evolution
rate and times for each sequence. Two sets of parameters
were used for a common phylogenetic tree, the evolution
rate kept constant while time parameters differed (See Fig.
3(c) and Table 3). In model 1 there is a narrow time distribution two month of final sequences, while model 2
had a wider time distribution of five months.
Hundreds of iterations of sequence data from the stimulation were given according to the parameters. For each
result, we could get estimated parameters by our fitting
method. The estimated K distribution of the results

Ideally, an estimation of evolution rate and the date of last
ancestor for the SARS coronavirus should be based on
sampling dates, with possible adjustments for culturing
time and conditions. As such data were neither included
in the submissions to Genbank, nor obtainable by direct
contacts to the sequencing labs, we were left to choose
between less ideal age estimates for the strains, such as
date of host death, sequencing date, or submission date to
Genbank. Sequencing dates were no more available than
sampling dates, and for some groups several sequences
were submitted to Genbank on the same date. In addition
large part of the GenBank sequence were submitted long
after June 2003, when no or very few SARS patient were
available for sampling, also rendering submission date a
not very accurate estimate for strain time. This basically
left us with little other choice than to accept the date of
host death as the most accurate available estimate for the
age of each strain. Assuming that in most cases samples
were taken a few days before to just after the death of the
host, we think these dates represent acceptable, though
not ideal, estimates of the endpoint of strain time.
In summary, certain inherent features of the situation
around the SARS epidemic prevented our method from
rendering more accurate estimates. First, as national and
international efforts fortunately succeeded in stemming
the spread of fledgling epidemic by summer 2003, all the
samples used to obtain the 16 sequences were collected
within a relatively short period of time (two months),
which makes the error of D(S0, Si) is relative large. Second,
because the date of host death is not good reflection of
real time of sequences, the error of time is quite large.
Third, as useful time data for the submitted sequences
were scarce, the subset of sequences available for modelling was too small. Finally, as data on pre-sequencing culturing times and conditions have not been made
available, differences in evolutions rates between in vivo
and in vitro conditions cannot be estimated, and the basic
assumption, that only a constant evolution rate may not
be completely valid. A more accurate model considering
two evolution rate parameters may produce a more accurate estimation, particularly on a larger dataset with accurate sampling and sequencing times.

Conclusions
We have proposed a mathematical model to estimate the
evolution rate of the SARS coronavirus genome as well as
the time of the last common ancestor of the various SARS
coronavirus strains. The method is simple to implement
and avoids the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the
root of phylogenetic tree. Based on 6 strains with accurate
dates of host death, we estimated a time of the last
common ancestor, which is coincident with epidemic
investigations, and an evolution rate in the same range as
that reported for the HIV-1 virus.
