Abstract
Background: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a nosocomial opportunistic pathogen of the
Xanthomonadaceae. The organism has been isolated from both clinical and soil environments in
addition to the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and the immunocompromised. Whilst relatively
distant phylogenetically, the closest sequenced relatives of S. maltophilia are the plant pathogenic
xanthomonads.
Results: The genome of the bacteremia-associated isolate S. maltophilia K279a is 4,851,126 bp and
of high G+C content. The sequence reveals an organism with a remarkable capacity for drug and
heavy metal resistance. In addition to a number of genes conferring resistance to antimicrobial
drugs of different classes via alternative mechanisms, nine resistance-nodulation-division (RND)type putative antimicrobial efflux systems are present. Functional genomic analysis confirms a role
in drug resistance for several of the novel RND efflux pumps. S. maltophilia possesses potentially
mobile regions of DNA and encodes a number of pili and fimbriae likely to be involved in adhesion
and biofilm formation that may also contribute to increased antimicrobial drug resistance.
Conclusion: The panoply of antimicrobial drug resistance genes and mobile genetic elements
found suggests that the organism can act as a reservoir of antimicrobial drug resistance
determinants in a clinical environment, which is an issue of considerable concern.

Background

The rise of antimicrobial drug resistance in bacteria is one of
the biggest threats to healthcare provision in the developed
world. Few new antimicrobial drugs are undergoing clinical
trials, and almost none are effective against Gram-negative
multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens [1]. A return to the
pre-antibiotic era is a possibility, and for some infections is
the current reality [2].
Antimicrobial resistance in historically common pathogens is
usually either acquired on a mobile genetic element or results
from a mutation [3]. However, some opportunistic pathogens
are intrinsically resistant to the actions of a number of antimicrobial classes. These tend to be of environmental origin, and
their intrinsic drug resistance determinants either provide
resistance to antibiotics produced by competitors, or represent broad-spectrum methods for removing toxic compounds
or waste products that, by chance, protect against antimicrobials [3,4]. It is known that established opportunistic infections are very difficult to treat due to the MDR nature of the
causative bacteria [5].
The most common intrinsically MDR opportunistic pathogens are the non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli typified by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this case, intrinsic resistance is
due to a battery of efflux pumps, specific antibiotic hydrolyzing enzymes, and intrinsically low outer membrane permeability. When intrinsically MDR bacteria then acquire
resistance to those few drugs that can kill them, the result is
an isolate resistant to all clinically available antimicrobials.
This pan-resistant phenotype is observed in P. aeruginosa
isolates with increasing frequency [6].
S. maltophilia is the third most common nosocomial non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli [7]. A recent study of intensive
care patients in the USA found that 4.3% of almost 75,000
Gram-negative infections studied were caused by S. maltophilia [8]. Isolates are intrinsically resistant to β-lactams,
aminoglycosides, macrolides, and many older quinolones [7].
S. maltophilia is found in soil and water, and routinely
resides in showerheads and other moist places where it grows
as biofilm. It is a truly opportunistic pathogen, and patient to
patient spread has not been reported, though small outbreaks
have been seen due to contaminated water sources [9]. Consistent with this, we find that isolates are generally genotypically and phenotypically diverse [10-12]. However, there is
phylogenetic clustering, with about half of clinical isolates
being very similar to each other, even across a wide geographical range. Members of this group, termed phylogenetic group
A, may be better at causing infections than other S. maltophilia isolates [13]. The two most common diseases caused
by S. maltophilia are bacteremia and pneumonia with infection being via an indwelling catheter or ventilator, respectively [9]. Respiratory tract colonization is seen in about a
third of all cystic fibrosis (CF) patients; nevertheless, there is

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R74

controversy as to whether this leads to a poorer clinical outcome or morbidity [14,15].
Bioinformatic and functional genomic analyses on the complete genome sequence emphasize factors with proven or
potential contribution to antibiotic resistance, persistence
and virulence. The findings reveal the remarkable capacity of
S. maltophilia for multidrug resistance and environmental
adaptability that underpins its importance as an emerging
opportunistic nosocomial pathogen.

Results and discussion
Total genome overview
The sequenced isolate is from a typical presentation: an elderly male patient undergoing chemotherapy at the Bristol
Oncology Unit, Bristol, UK in 1998 developed a bloodstream
infection that did not respond to therapy with piperacillin/
tazobactam, ceftazidime or imipenem. S. maltophilia K279a
was cultured from a blood sample taken shortly before death
[16]. K279a falls into phylogenetic group A, and has typical
antimicrobial resistance properties [13,17,18]. Accordingly, it
was thought suitable as a representative genome sequence
strain.
The genome consists of a single circular chromosome; no
plasmids were detected (Figure 1). The total size is 4,851,126
bp with a G+C content of 66.7% G+C. Four copies of the rRNA
operon and 74 tRNAs are present. These data have been submitted to EMBL under accession number AM743169.

Drug resistance
In Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens, MDR is usually
mediated by the over-production of resistance-nodulationdivision (RND) type efflux pumps. These pumps tend to have
broad substrate profiles, including organic solvents, disinfectants and antimicrobial drugs from a number of different
classes. Cytoplasmic efflux is driven by dissipation of the proton-motive force across the inner membrane. Two additional
components are needed to remove substrates from the cell,
forming a tripartite efflux pump complex that spans the envelope. A particular periplasm-spanning membrane-fusion protein (MFP) is usually specific to each RND efflux protein, and
it is common to find the pair encoded as part of an operon. A
third component, the outer membrane protein (OMP), can be
encoded in the same operon, but there tend to be fewer different OMPs than RND/MFP pairs in a cell, meaning that the
OMPs are often promiscuous [19].
The K279a sequence carries nine RND-type efflux pump
genes that fall into the drug resistance type based on sequence
homology. Homologues of two known S. maltophilia tripartite efflux pump operons are present, smeABC (Smlt4474-6)
and smeDEF (Smlt4070-2), representing MFP, RND and
OMP genes, respectively, in each case. SmeABC was first
characterized in the clinical S. maltophilia isolate ULA511

[20], which is phylogenetically closely related to K279a [21].
Disruption of smeAB in ULA-511, or in a hyper-resistant
mutant background, had no effect on drug resistance. However, disruption of smeC reduced the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of a variety of antimicrobials against
ULA-511, so SmeC may act as an OMP in at least one functional tripartite antimicrobial efflux pump [20].

SmeDEF is over-produced in a hyper-resistant mutant of the
clinical isolate S. maltophilia D457 [22], which is phylogenetically quite distinct to K279a [21]. SmeDEF over-expression
causes hyper-resistance to fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol and tetracycline in K279a [17]. Hyper-expression occurs
either through loss-of function mutations in the locally
encoded TetR-type transcriptional repressor, smeT [17,23],

or through undefined mutations, which may affect another
regulator of the concentration of the activator [17,24]. Characteristics of the nine S. maltophilia RND efflux pumps are
described in more detail in Table 1.
To determine involvement of the seven novel RND efflux
pumps in intrinsic antimicrobial drug resistance in K279a,
their genes were disrupted by suicide gene replacement to
cause a significant intragenic deletion and frameshift mutation. MICs of a variety of antimicrobials were determined
against the mutants in comparison to wild-type K279a. From
this experiment, we conclude that SmeZ, SmeJ and SmeK are
involved in intrinsic antimicrobial drug resistance in K279a
(Table 2). A smeJK double mutant behaved identically to the
individual mutants, leading to the conclusion that, as with
their homologues mtdBC in Escherichia coli [25], their products cannot work separately. Disruption of smeZ markedly
affects only aminoglycoside MICs; disruption of smeJ and/or
smeK has a more general but subtle effect on resistance, lowering MICs of some aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and
tetracyclines, but none dramatically.

Other known and putative antibiotic resistance genes in the
genome specify resistance via a number of mechanisms to βlactams, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides (Table 3). Many of the resistance genes
are located on small islands with no obvious mobile DNA features (determined by Alien Hunter [26]), and may not all be
expressed. Experimentally determined antibiotic modifying
enzymes produced by K279a are β-lactamases L1 and L2
specifying resistance to all clinically available β-lactams
except the monobactams [27], and the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes APH 3'II and AAC 6'I that together confer
resistance to all clinically available aminoglycosides except
gentamicin [18]. It has been reported previously that the S.
maltophilia L1 and L2 β-lactamases might be encoded on a
large 'plasmid-like element', but this was not confirmed using
pulse-field gel electrophoresis [27]. Given that there is no
plasmid in S. maltophilia isolate K279a, and that L1 and L2
are not encoded on a region of the chromosome that resembles an integrated plasmid, it is likely that the result reported
previously reflected chromosomal contamination of a plasmid preparation, giving a false PCR positive for the L1 and L2
genes.

Genes encoding six other putative RND family tripartite
efflux pumps are found in the K279a genome sequence. However, these are more closely related to cation/metal efflux
pumps than to antimicrobial RND efflux pumps, and are designated SmmABC to TUV. K279a additionally encodes several
alternative heavy metal resistance mechanisms that are associated with a complex mobile region of DNA. These include
arsenic, mercury, and copper resistance. Alternative copper
resistance genes are specified elsewhere in the genome.
Heavy metal resistance (to cadmium via an efflux protein) has
been described in S. maltophilia D457R [28].
DNA acquired by lateral gene transfer was identified using
Alien Hunter [26]. Putative transposons, both conjugative
and complex as well as insertion sequence (IS) elements were
found in K279a. Throughout the genome there are seven

intact copies of a single unique IS element related to ISXac3
of Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (X. campestris)
8004, and two pseudogenic copies. Additional IS elements
present in the sequence include ISHne3/IS111A-like and
ISPsy9-like (Table 4). Intriguingly, a single putative streptomycin 3" phosphotransferase gene (Smlt2336) has inserted
between genes clpS and clpA relative to the X. campestris
genome. To one side of Smlt2336 is a set of 36 and 18 bp
direct repeats, perhaps suggestive of a footprint of a mobile
element that may have inserted then excised.
There is no evidence in K279a for a class one integron specifying sulfonamide resistance as has recently been seen in a
number of S. maltophilia isolates [29], and K279a is sensitive
to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole.

Mobile regions were determined using an approach that combined using the Alien Hunter program, repeat analysis and by-eye comparisons between
K279a and the X. campestris genome sequence by ACT analysis. *CDS (Smlt2465) in this feature shares 72.5% identity with a previously characterized
transposase, Tn5044, from a Xanthomonas spp. isolated from a heavy metal mine in Russia [67]. Stenotrophomonas was at that time classified as
Xanthomonas. ND, not detected.

S. maltophilia harbor giant phage [30]; although potential
prophages were identified in K279a, there is no evidence for
giant lysogenic phage.

Secretion systems and extracellular enzymes
Type I, II (sec), IV and V (autotransporter) as well as the twin
arginine secretion systems genes are present in the K279a
genome sequence. Surprisingly, there are no type III secretion genes in K279a. Type III secretion components are
related to the flagella apparatus [31]. The flagella apparatus of
S. maltophilia is highly conserved with the X. campestris system and there is no evidence to suggest that these components could function in type III secretion. Secreted
extracellular enzyme genes were found in the genome. K279a
encodes non-hemolytic phospholipase C (plcN1, Smlt1755) as
well as enzymes from the phospholipase D family. Phospholipase cleaves phospholipids to fatty acids and is implicated in
virulence due to its ability to degrade cell membranes. There
is evidence that phospholipases contribute towards virulence
in Burkholderia pseudomallei [32]. Other extracellular
enzymes, including DNase, gelatinase, hemolysin, lipases,
proteinase K and proteases, have been characterized and
implicated in disease in S. maltophilia [33]. The major extracellular protease of K279a, StmPr1 (Smlt0861), has also been
implicated as a virulence determinant [34].

Pili, fimbriae and adhesins
S. maltophilia produces various pili/fimbriae that are implicated in adhesion and biofilm formation [35]. This type of
aggregative behavior is likely to be associated with colonization of biotic and abiotic surfaces, evasion of the host immune
response as well as increased drug resistance.
The Smf-1 fimbrial operon includes Smlt0706-Smlt0709.
These 17 kDa subunit fimbriae mediate adherence, participate at early stages of biofilm formation [36] and can
agglutinate red blood cells. Smf-1, seen as peritrichous semiflexible fimbriae of 5-7 nm under electron microscopy, are
produced at 37°C but not 18°C. Two distinct loci, Smlt1508-12
and Smlt0732-6, comprise further sets of putative pili/fimbrial genes that include fimbrial subunit and chaperone/
usher proteins.
A TadE-like pili/fimbrial gene cluster is located at Smlt2867Smlt2875. In Actinobacillus, bundled Flp pili are required for
tight adherence and strongly attached biofilm on solid surfaces in vitro, which is likely to be required in oral cavity colonization and initiation of periodontal disease [37].
Type IV pili are implicated in adherence and autoaggregation
in enteropathogenic E. coli. In some species they have been
associated with twitching motility and biofilm formation (for
example, the obligate plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa and
P. aeruginosa). Subunits and associated apparatus specifying

the type IV pilus are scattered throughout the genome of
K279a. K279a also carries a gene cluster that shares significant similarity with a locus specifying the giant cable pilus of
Burkholderia cenocepacia. This pilus has been implicated in
the pathogenicity of B. cenocepacia in CF patients [38]. However, not all pathogenic CF isolates of B. cenocepacia carry cbl
genes; this can also be the case in other Burkholderia spp.
[39]. Alternative potential adhesins are encoded in the
genome, including an afimbrial adhesin and Hep-hag family
adhesins.
In this bacteremia-associated isolate, K279a, there are three
members of the YadA family of BuHA proteins that contain
numerous Hep-Hag repeat domains [40]. Two hemagglutinin/hemolysin family proteins are present as pseudogenes.
Hemolysin activator Smlt1389, and outer membrane surface
filamentous heamagglutinin (FHA) Smlt1390 and Smlt4452
are present. Filamentous heamagglutinin is an important virulence factor in Bordetella pertussis, being involved in
related adhesion and spread of bacteria through the respiratory tract [41].

Intercellular and intracellular signaling
Quorum sensing (cell-cell signaling) is important in infection
models of P. aeruginosa, and quorum-sensing signals that
coordinate biofilm formation have been identified in CF sputum along with biofilm-like structures [42]. S. maltophilia
also carries out cell-cell signaling; however, the S. maltophilia system does not employ the usual LuxIR regulators
[43,44]. Instead, S. maltophilia uses the Xanthomonas and
Xylella signaling system mediated by a diffusible signal molecule, DSF [45,46]. DSF activity has been detected in a
number of strains of S. maltophilia, including K279a, and
controls resistance to several antibiotics, aggregative and
biofilm behavior and virulence in a nematode model [47]. The
K279a proteome contains no n-acyl homoserine lactone (NAHL) synthases of either the LuxI or LuxM type and no LuxS
protein (implicated in autoinducer 2 synthesis in a wide range
of bacteria). K279a does encode a single LuxR type regulator
with an N-AHL autoinducer-binding domain. Such orphan
LuxR-like proteins have been described in Xanthomonas
oryzae pv oryzae (X. oryzae) [48] and X. campestris [49],
which do not synthesize N-AHLs. These proteins may interact
with a plant host component rather than bind N-AHLs.
DSF perception in X. campestris is linked to altered levels of
the second messenger cyclic di-GMP through the action of the
HD-GYP phosphodiesterase domain regulator RpfG [50].
Cyclic-di-GMP regulates a range of functions, including
developmental transitions, adhesion, biofilm formation and
virulence in diverse bacteria [51]. Cyclic-di-GMP levels are
influenced by synthesis and degradation acted on by the protein domains GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP. K279a encodes 33
proteins with a potential role in cyclic di-GMP turnover: 3
proteins with an EAL domain; 18 with a single GGDEF
domain; 10 with GGDEF and EAL domains; and two HD-GYP

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R74

Crossman et al. R74.7

domain proteins, including RpfG. Most of these proteins contain additional signal input domains, suggesting that their
activities (and therefore cyclic di-GMP levels) are responsive
to diverse environmental cues.

Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are integral components of the extracellular
matrix of bacterial biofilms and may play a role in resistance
of bacteria to antibiotics. In xanthomonads, the gum gene
cluster specifies production of the exopolysaccharide xanthan
that is important in biofilm formation as well as being a commercially important product. X. fastidiosa produces fastidian
gum, a truncated xanthan that is encoded by a reduced gum
gene cluster [52]. There are no gum gene cluster orthologues
in K279a; hence, this strain does not produce either xanthan
or a modified version. Additionally, K279a does not carry
genes for cellulose production, nor the exopolysaccharide
cepacian, produced by some strains of B. cenocepacia.
Gene products implicated in the formation of intermediates
of lipopolysaccharides and exopolysaccharides have been
identified in K279a. XanAB are involved in UDP-glucose and
GDP-mannose biosynthesis whilst RmlAC are involved in the
synthesis and interconversion of TDP-sugars. XanB shares
significant homology with phosphomannose isomerase, a key
enzyme in the biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa alginate. Alginate is a key polysaccharide and is upregulated in CF sputum
isolates from patients that have been infected with P. aeruginosa over a considerable length of time. Mutations in xanB
and rmlAC affect biofilm formation and twitching motility in
S. maltophilia WR-C [53]. The xanA gene, also known as
spgM, is a phosphoglucomutase that shares similarity with P.
aeruginosa algC [54]. K279a also specifies an orthologue of
alginate lyase (Smlt1473), which is intriguing, since in CF
lungs, the organisms are likely to be in contact with alginateproducing P. aeruginosa.

Comparing the genomes of S. maltophilia and X.
campestris - two sides of the same coin?
The K279a genome sequence was compared to that of X.
campestris and X. oryzae using the Artemis Comparison Tool
(ACT) (Figure 2). The extent of conserved regions between
K279a and 8004 are difficult to visualize by ACT, mainly due
to multiple chromosomal rearrangements. The first side of
the 'coin' is illustrated by the use of K279a as a reference
genome with a comparison of orthologous genes shared
between K279a and sequenced xanthomonads on a circular
genome representation. This comparison allows islands
unique to K279a to be more clearly seen, the most obvious
being the acquisition of a phage sited at 1,922,800 bp (Figure
3). Predicted functions of coding sequence (CDS) unique to
K279a and those shared between 8004 and K279a are shown
in Additional data file 1. Genes present in K279a that were not
found in X. campestris may be applicable to human disease
and are briefly described below.

present in 8004. Fimbrial/pili gene clusters are either divergent or not present in 8004. Other K279a acquisitions include

hemagglutinins and hemolysins, two proteins with F5/8 type
C coagulase domains, along with pseudogenes with hemagglutinin domains and similarities. Myosin cross-reactive antigen has also been acquired relative to X. campestris. Heavy
metal resistance on a complex mobile element was acquired
compared to 8004, as were some antibiotic resistance genes,
especially those for aminoglycoside resistance. Although S.
maltophilia is an obligate aerobe, the membrane-bound

nitrate reductase that supports growth in the absence of oxygen with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor is present in
some strains [55]. The potential for microoxic growth is suggested in K279a, with the putative acquisition of formate
dehydrogenase (fdn), the selenocysteine tRNA synthesis
genes required for the Sel codon in fdnG, and the membranebound nitrate reductase (nar). Nar employs a molybdenum
cofactor, and K279a nar genes cluster with Mo cofactor bio-

synthesis and transport genes, and a member of the FNR/
CRP family of transcriptional regulators (fnr2, Smlt2767). An
FNR homologue present in the K279a gene cluster suggests
that the associated genes are only produced under limiting
oxygenation since E. coli FNR regulates the aerobic-anaerobic switch [56]. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa under
conditions encountered in CF lung (modeled by growth in CF
lung sputum) indicates that nar gene expression is elevated
[57]. Another FNR family member (Smlt2159) is located elsewhere. The potential for growth under microoxic conditions
may enhance the pathogenicity of this organism, for example,
by increasing its ability to grow in biofilm. K279a has gained
some heat shock proteins that may be needed during pathogenic growth. Both genera share a high number of TonB
dependent receptor proteins, a peculiarity of xanthomonads
and epsilon proteobacteria [58]. Using X. campestris 8004 as
the reference genome in comparison to K279a, there are no
large islands of acquisitions or losses. The flip side of the
'coin' is that genes present in X. campestris and absent in S.
maltophilia are of relevance in plant disease (Figure 4). We
can see the lack of the type III secretion system and gum gene
cluster relative to X. campestris. Other plant pathogenic virulence determinants that are not present in K279a include the
extracellular enzymes endoglucanase, polygalacturonate
lyase, pectate lyase and cellulase. The avr genes involved in
gene-for-gene resistance, such as avrBS1 [59], are also not
present in K279a. Further studies of the genomic comparisons between X. campestris and S. maltophilia may reveal
additional genes of medical interest or of interest in plant
pathogenesis.

potentially acts as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants in medically relevant environments.
K279a possesses an unusual cell density-signaling pathway
like that of its plant pathogenic xanthomonad relatives.
K279a does produce extracellular enzymes such as protease
StmPr1 and phospholipases; however, previous studies on
clinical isolates have reported the production of other extracellular enzymes by S. maltophilia, suggesting that such virulence factors may be strain-specific. Comparison of K279a
with X. campestris illustrates the movements of mobile
genetic elements, the acquisition of potentially human
pathogenic factors such as hemagglutinin, hemolysins and
the loss of plant pathogenic factors such as the extracellular
enzyme polygalacturonate lyase.
In conclusion, the S. maltophilia genome sequence reveals
the capacity of this organism for environmental adaptations
that presumably contribute to its persistence in vivo. As
expected of a true opportunistic pathogen, the S. maltophilia
genome does not suggest a highly virulent organism. However, the large number of pili/fimbrial genes does indicate a
strong ability to attach to catheters and ventilators, from
which infections of the blood or lungs arise. With its MDR
phenotype and ability to attach, it is clear why this organism
is persistent and difficult to eradicate. We are starting to build
up a picture of an organism that is a true opportunist, which,
while lacking many conventional key virulence determinants,
has nevertheless emerged as a considerable threat.

Materials and methods
Conclusion

Sequencing strategy and annotation

The genome sequence of the bacteremia-associated S. maltophilia isolate K279a carries a startling array of antimicrobial drug resistance gene determinants. Knockout
mutagenesis confirms the involvement of a number of novel
RND efflux genes in resistance to a variety of different classes
of antimicrobials.
The current drug of choice for treating S. maltophilia infections is trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, but resistance is
seen in S. maltophilia isolates due to a mobile determinant
[29,60]. Other drugs with reasonable activity against S. maltophilia are minocycline and newer fluoroquinolones [60].
However, mutants resistant to these last resort drugs are
readily selected in vitro. One mutation may be sufficient to
cause resistance to these drugs, and worryingly, this mutation
can be selected for in the presence of a front-line antimicrobial such as amikacin [17].
The panoply of antimicrobial drug resistance genes and
mobile genetic elements is an issue of clinical concern. S. maltophilia can also provide antibiotic resistance protection for
sensitive P. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens strains
growing nearby [61]. Even more importantly, the organism

S. maltophilia K279a was grown on Nutrient broth (Oxoid
Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK) and genomic DNA was isolated using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide.
DNA was sonicated, size selected, and libraries were constructed in pUC19, pMAQ1b and pBACe3.6. The genome
assembly was based on 3,381, 41,541 and 21,977 paired endreads, respectively, from pUC19 libraries (of insert sizes 1.42.0 kb, 2.0-2.8 kb and 3.0-3.3 kb) and from 6,890, 314 and 69
paired end-reads, respectively, from pMAQ1b libraries (of
insert sizes 5.5-6.0 kb, 9-10 kb and 10-12 kb), to give a 10.76fold sequence coverage of the genome. We generated 1,250
and 106 reads, respectively, to produce a scaffold from 15-18
and 20-25 kb libraries in pBACe3.6. The genome was
sequenced, finished and annotated as previously described
[62]. To ensure that all bases were covered by reads on both
strands or with different sequencing chemistries, and to fill
gaps, 789 extra reads were generated. Repeats were bridged
using read-pairs or end-sequenced PCR products. The total
shotgun size was 53,580,262 Mb with a total genome coverage of 11.05-fold. Orthologous genes were determined by
reciprocal best match analysis.

Disruption of putative efflux pump genes and MIC
determination
Genes were disrupted using a modified method of that previously described [17]. Genes were amplified by PCR in two
non-overlapping fragments, with HindIII being introduced
such that the two fragments could be ligated together, resulting in a mutant gene having a large deletion and a frameshift
mutation. The primers used are listed in Additional data file
2. Mutated genes were used to replace wild-type sequences on

the chromosome of K279a using the gene replacement
approach described previously. Agar dilution MICs of antimicrobials against K279a and its derivatives were determined
according to British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy
(BSAC)-approved methods [63].
