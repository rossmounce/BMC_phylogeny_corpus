Functional evolution of the trace amine
associated receptors in mammals and the loss of
TAAR1 in dogs
Eric J Vallender*, Zhihua Xie, Susan V Westmoreland, Gregory M Miller

Abstract
Background: The trace amine associated receptor family is a diverse array of GPCRs that arose before the first
vertebrates walked on land. Trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a wide spectrum aminergic receptor that
acts as a modulator in brain monoaminergic systems. Other trace amine associated receptors appear to relate to
environmental perception and show a birth-and-death pattern in mammals similar to olfactory receptors.
Results: Across mammals, avians, and amphibians, the TAAR1 gene is intact and appears to be under strong
purifying selection based on rates of amino acid fixation compared to neutral mutations. We have found that in
dogs it has become a pseudogene. Our analyses using a comparative genetics approach revealed that the
pseudogenization event predated the emergence of the Canini tribe rather than being coincident with canine
domestication. By assessing the effects of the TAAR1 agonist b-phenylethylamine on [3H]dopamine uptake in
canine striatal synaptosomes and comparing the degree and pattern of uptake inhibition to that seen in other
mammals, including TAAR1 knockout mice, wild type mice and rhesus monkey, we found that the TAAR1
pseudogenization event resulted in an uncompensated loss of function.
Conclusion: The gene family has seen expansions among certain mammals, notably rodents, and reductions in
others, including primates. By placing the trace amine associated receptors in an evolutionary context we can
better understand their function and their potential associations with behavior and neurological disease.

Background
Trace amine associated receptors (TAARs) are a family
of G-protein coupled receptors that originated prior to
the emergence of jawed vertebrates [1]. The most widely
studied of these receptors is TAAR1, which has been
shown to bind a wide spectrum of biogenic amines and
psychoactive compounds [2,3] (Additional file 1) and is
a known modulator of monoaminergic activity [4].
Trace amines themselves have proven elusive to understand; the only receptors that they have been found to
bind to are TAAR1 [2,3,5,6] and TAAR4 (in rat only)
[2], though they also appear to be substrates at various
monoamine transporters and catabolic enzymes [5-7].
TAAR1 expression in brain is observed in a variety of
species including human [2], rhesus macaque [8], mouse
[2], and rat [3] with its distribution widespread. Notably,

Hill Drive, Southborough, MA 01772, USA

expression overlaps with regions important in brain
monoaminergic function and co-expression of TAAR1
and the dopamine transporter (DAT) has been observed
in dopaminergic neurons [8]. Studies replacing TAAR1
with LacZ in knock-out mice support these findings
with the staining of brain sections in these mice displaying LacZ expression throughout dopaminergic and serotonergic regions [9]. These findings, coupled with a
dysregulation of trace amines in psychiatric disease [10],
have made understanding the function of this gene particularly relevant.
Though the TAAR gene family is present in some
form in all jawed vertebrates, the number of genes
observed in any given species varies considerably [1].
While the placental mammalian ancestor is thought to
have harbored nine distinct TAAR genes, even within
this relatively recent clade there has been significant
gene gain and loss; mouse, rat, and cow have added to
the repertoire, while primates and dog have seen losses

[1,11,12]. Functional work on members of the TAAR
gene family other than TAAR1 is sparse, but what has
been done suggests that other TAAR gene products do
not bind the traditional TAAR1 ligands (e.g., b-phenylethylamine (b-PEA)) [2,13], but instead show a distinct
ligand set related to environmental perception [14].
Expression studies fail to find broad expression of these
other TAAR family members in the brain but rather
observe localization predominantly in the olfactory
apparatus [1,14].
This functional dichotomy between TAAR1 and its
cousins is significant. While other members of the
TAAR gene family have seen recurrent pseudogenization
and duplication, TAAR1 has been evolutionarily stable.
TAAR1 was the first to arise and remains the only
TAAR gene present in every species studied with the
possible exception of the neotelost fish who nevertheless
harbors another, evolutionarily similar, TAAR1 cousin
[1,15]. Yet, despite this conservation, TAAR1 shows
sequence divergence across species and species-specific
pharmacological profiles with drug potency (EC50) differences of 10-fold or more common [1,11,16,17]. While
it remains unclear what practical effect these differences
have in vivo, it is noteworthy that this variation exists,
despite the conservation of the gene itself and its unique
evolutionary history.
In order to better understand the evolutionary context
in which this receptor family evolved and to better
grasp its likely functional significance we have explored
the relationship of various TAAR homologs in twenty
mammals, a marsupial, a monotreme and an outgroup
avian. We have characterized the gain and loss of TAAR
homologs among mammals and performed evolutionary
analyses to better understand the selective constraints
under which they operate. We have also more fully
investigated the evolutionary history of TAAR1 with a
focus on the carnivores and the functional implications
of a loss of TAAR1 in dogs.

Results and Discussion
Initially we gathered all reported TAAR homologs from
eleven species for whom annotated genomic sequence
was available (Mus musculus, mouse; Rattus norvegicus,
rat; Pan troglodytes; chimpanzee; Homo sapiens, human;
Bos taurus, cow; Sus scrofa, pig; Equus caballus, horse;
Canis familiaris, dog; Monodelphis domesticus, opossum;
Ornithorhynchus anatinus, platypus; and Gallus gallus,
chicken. We also amplified and sequenced TAAR homologs from three new world monkey species (Callithrix
jacchus, common marmoset; Saguinus oedipus, cottontop tamarin; and Saimiri sciureus, squirrel monkey),
sequence confirmed the genomic data available for rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, and identified putative
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) homologs through trans-

alignments with the as yet unannotated genomic
sequence.
Computationally annotated genomic sequences are
currently focused on identifying intact genes and
exclude pseudogenes. As such, for many of the species
for whom genomic sequences were relied upon only
whole and intact genes were identified. (Though it is
noted that even this set is incomplete do to errors and
incomplete data in the annotation process [18].) We
then aligned, in frame, the identified genes, calculated
evolutionary parameters and generated a phylogenetic
tree using RAxML [19]. This resulting phylogram largely
mirrors the previously identified relationships between
the trace amine associated receptors [1,11] and species
relationships (Figure 1, Additional File 2). The incongruencies that exist are simply explained by a paucity of
mutations reflective of a small physical region and short
evolutionary time. Beyond the nine ancestral TAARs,
expansions have been species specific (symparalogs) and
we observe no evidence for paralogs shared between
species (alloparalogs). However, TAAR6 and TAAR8 in
placental mammals themselves appear to be alloparalogous sharing a single ancestral ortholog with marsupials.
This ancestor of mammalian TAAR6 and TAAR8 we
tentatively call TAAR6L8L (trace amine associated
receptor 6-like, 8-like) and has seen apparent duplications in the opossum lineage. We further identify an
opossum specific gene that appears to serve as an outgroup to all TAARs, tentatively called TAARL (trace
amine associated receptor-like). Further investigation of
these marsupial TAAR genes will be required to understand their functional and evolutionary relevance.
We also considered the relative rate of amino acid
fixation (dN/dS) among the lineages. Without exception,
all lineages showed dN/dS values less than one indicative
of negative, purifying, selection (see Additional file 3).
Because of the observed differences between ligands and
expression patterns associated with TAAR1 as compared
to other family members, we performed a branches test
to identify if there was a significant difference between
the d N /d S values among TAAR1 genes compared to
other family members. Interestingly there was a significant difference (p < 0.001) but with TAAR1 showing an
elevated, though still purifying, dN/dS of 0.256 compared
to the remainder of the family at a dN/dS of 0.164. We
compared this to the TAAR5 clade which also is
robustly conserved without pseudogenization. TAAR5 is
evolutionarily statistically indistinguishable from other
TAAR family members.
To more thoroughly investigate the gain and loss of
TAAR genes and their relevance to human behavior and
disease, we interrogated the entire family repertoire of
humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, rhesus macaques,
and marmosets as well as tamarin and squirrel monkey

sequences for which amplicons were successful. Previous
studies had noted numerous pseudogenization events in
the evolution of human and chimpanzee TAARs [10]
and this finding appeared to be generalized across primates with pseudogenes common among orangutans,
rhesus macaques, and marmosets as well. A tree depicting the relationships among primate TAARs is shown in
Figure 2 with pseudogenes noted. The data remains too
incomplete to adequately model birth-and-death processes, however, and will likely require more complete
identification of entire TAAR gene complements among
all mammals for conclusion. Two genes, however, are
conserved and intact among all five primate species,
TAAR1 and TAAR5. These findings suggest these genes
explicitly as the most likely to be implicated in disease
phenotypes among the gene family.
TAAR1 and TAAR5 also seem to be the most conserved broadly across all the species studied, but while
TAAR5 is intact for all mammalian species in which it

has been identified, our interrogations of the published
dog genomes found TAAR1 to be a pseudogene. Indeed,
complete and conserved coding regions for TAAR1 were
identified for all mammals under study with the exception of the dog which had several frame-shift mutations
apparently rendering it a pseudogene. In-frame insertion/deletions can be seen in several species (mouse, rat,
chicken, and cat), but these are all localized to the third
intracellular domain. Overall divergence values for the
gene across all species are broadly representative of
expected mutation rates. Using maximum likelihood
based methods we reconstructed putative ancestral
sequences and probed the tree for evidence of positive
selection. As shown in Figure 3, d N /d S values for all
branches were below 1 indicative of negative selection at
work on the gene. Lineages that displayed even moderately higher dN/dS values tended to be shorter and indicative more of stochastic noise rather than obscured
signal. Further, there was no evidence of positive selection at either the level of individual codons. The third
intracellular domain and the third extracellular domain
showed moderately higher levels of amino acid divergence as compared with other regions in the gene,

Page 4 of 9

though still without approaching levels anticipated
through positive selection (data not shown). This is perhaps unsurprising given that among TAAR family genes
as a whole these regions tend to be the least conserved
[1].
While TAAR1 is under purifying selection across a
diverse group of mammals, this does not appear to be
the case for dog. Sequence obtained from the dog genome shows several frame shift mutations in the orthologous TAAR1 region. Dog genomes produced by public
and private efforts on two different breeds of dog, boxer
and poodle showed no differences between the breeds,
nor did we find any difference when we separately
amplified and sequenced the dog TAAR1 from genomic
DNA isolated from MDCK cells, a cell line derived from
the kidney of a cocker spaniel. Further interrogation of
the dog genome using feline, murine, or human TAAR1
confirmed the orthology of the canine TAAR1 pseudogene and failed to find evidence of a duplication event.
To determine whether the loss of TAAR1 was coincident with the canine domestication event, we also
sequenced TAAR1 from three wild gray wolf populations, but again found identical sequences to those from

displayed. Note that the dN/dS value associated with the cat terminal branch extends to the last common ancestor between Carnivora and
Cetartiodactyla.

domesticated dog. Guided by carnivore phylogeny [20],
we surveyed TAAR1 in four additional caniform carnivores. Wolf-like canids (Chinese dhole, African wild
dog, and black-backed jackal) and South American
canids (bush dog) showed the same pseudogenization
markers as was observed for the dog and wolf. Because
TAAR1 is intact in cats, the pseudogenization event
seems to have occurred prior to the divergence of the
tribe Canini but subsequent to the divergence from the
feliforms (Figure 4).
While TAAR1 is inactivated in dogs, it is not certain
that its function has been lost. While analysis of the dog
genome failed to identify a specific recent duplication
event of TAAR1, it did identify two other TAAR family
members with intact coding regions and so it is conceivable, if unlikely, that a compensatory functional change
may have appeared. It is also notable that the dog genome, in its current state, remains incomplete. While the
TAAR1 genomic region maps to a chromosome with
flanking genes (VNN1 upstream and STX7 downstream)
identical to the genes that flank the TAAR regions in
other species, TAAR2, TAAR4, and TAAR5 map to a
contig that has not been assembled onto a chromosome.
TAAR3, TAAR6, TAAR7, TAAR8, and TAAR9 homologs
are not readily apparent in the dog genome though several large gaps exist in the region downstream of the
TAAR2/4/5 cluster where TAAR6/7/8/9 would be
expected. In all the dog genome assemblies, the TAAR
locus is far from finished quality. Because of this we
sought to determine whether TAAR1 functionality, if
not TAAR1 itself, could be observed in dogs.
To do so, we used an established assay for TAAR1
functionality in brain synaptosomes that distinguishes
between the presence and absence of a functional
TAAR1 receptor [4,8,21]. The assay uses 10 nM [ 3 H]
dopamine as a tracer combined with 100 nM b-PEA as

Page 5 of 9

the TAAR1 agonist [21]. An enhanced uptake inhibition
by DAT occurs in TAAR1 and DAT co-transfected cell
lines or striatal synaptosomes where TAAR1 is present,
but not in cell lines without TAAR1 or in synaptosomes
derived from TAAR1 knock-out mice. Notably, this
response is robust to species differences, with similar
results shown in cell lines, old world and new world
monkey synaptosomes, and mouse synaptosomes [4].
Here, we show that in fresh striatal brain synaptosomes
from dog, wild-type mouse and TAAR1 knock-out
mouse, 10 nM [3H]dopamine alone or 10 nM [3H]dopamine and 100 nM b-PEA was taken up specifically by
DAT over time. Consistent with our previous findings
[4,8,21], synaptosomes prepared from the wild-type
mouse showed an enhanced [3H]dopamine uptake inhibition initiating after 3 minutes when b-PEA was present, while this effect was not observed in synaptosomes
prepared from TAAR1 knock-out mice. Synaptosomes
derived from dog striatum responded to the treatment
similar to those prepared from the TAAR1 knock-out
mice, strongly suggesting the functional absence of
TAAR1 (Figure 5).
Two groups have separately created TAAR1 knockout
mice and not only are these mice fully viable, but the
mice show no gross physical or behavioral abnormalities
and identification of any non-pharmacologically induced
phenotype has not been forthcoming [9,22]. Yet the
conservation of the gene for the last 450 million years
across numerous species belies an importance. Concurrent with a role as a monoaminergic modulator, knockout mice show changes in their dopaminergic system
compared to wild types including increased high-affinity
dopamine receptor D 2 [22] and higher neuronal firing
rates in the ventral tegmental area [9,22], which is
important in brain reward circuitry [9]. It may be noteworthy then that while the D 2 receptor antagonist

pimozide does not change the self-administration of bPEA in dogs [23], it does block b-PEA induced locomotion in mice [24]. Further, while the self-administration
of b-PEA in dogs is unaffected by the D2 antagonist, it
increases self-administration of amphetamine both in
dogs [25] and rats [26].

Conclusion
Our understanding of neuroaminergic signaling has
recently become more complicated with the emergence
of the TAAR gene family. These genes represent a heretofore unexplored mechanism of neuromodulation.
They have gained a further importance with findings
suggesting an association with schizophrenia [27,28]. In
these studies we catalog the TAAR family members
across mammals, demonstrating a pattern of pseudogenization and duplication among most of the family members. In primates particularly, only two members,
TAAR1 and TAAR5, are completely conserved, suggesting perhaps a greater importance for these genes. Yet
despite this evolutionary flux there seems to be a strong
purifying selection across all intact genes.
Both because of its conservation as well as the fact
that only it binds neurotransmitters, TAAR1 has proven
particularly interesting. Indeed TAAR1 knock-out
mouse may show some of the same endophenotypes as
schizophrenic patients [22] and have been touted as a
model system. Yet here we demonstrate that there exist

naturally occurring TAAR1 knockouts: dogs and their
close relatives. Among these species there does not
appear to be an intact open reading frame and ex vivo
studies show effects similar to those seen in TAAR1
knockout mice. Yet it remains unclear what, if any
effects, this loss of function has had. While it is tantalizing to speculate that many behavioral characteristics of
dogs, including their relative ease of training, may
involve reward encoding and perception, and suggest
that this is related to TAAR1 effects on the dopamine
system, it remains unproven. Indeed, any association
between dog behavior and TAAR1 functional loss must
also account for the other Canini species.
That dogs and their brethren can well tolerate the loss
of TAAR1 despite its evolutionary conservation must
provoke questions as to the relevance of the gene to
schizophrenia or other mental health diseases. While it
has been suggested that perhaps another member of the
trace amine associated receptor family is contributory to
the schizophrenic phenotype [28], the widespread loss of
TAAR genes suggests an evolutionary lability that seems
contraindicative. Rather the ligand binding studies suggest a dichotomy between TAAR1 and the remainder of
the family that is broadly supported by the observed differences in gene phylogenies. The suggestion from
rodents that TAAR family members other than TAAR1
are related to chemosensory perception [14] is bolstered
by these findings as well. The patterns of species-specific

Vallender et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/51

duplications and pseudogenization events are reminiscent of that seen for olfactory genes [29].
This work demonstrates the strengths of applying evolutionary studies to functional analyses. From the phylogenies of the TAAR genes, TAAR1 appears qualitatively
different in its pattern of gene gain and loss. This
coupled with our knowledge of TAAR ligand binding
suggests a dichotomy of function among the receptors.
At the same time the tolerance of loss of TAAR1 in
dogs offers a warning for association studies with disease; the subtleties of effect must be considered. Understanding the paradox of evolutionarily ancient
conservation and an accommodation of recent loss will
shed significant light on neuroaminergic biology and the
genetic basis underlying brain and behavior.

following manufacturer’s protocols. DNA from three
wild wolf (Canis lupus) populations, Yellowstone
National Park in the United States, Canadian Rockies,
and Spain, were kindly provided by RK Wayne. Blackbacked jackal, Canis mesomelas; Chinese dhole, Cuon
alpinus; African hunting dog, Lycaon pictus; and bush
dog, Speothos venaticus samples were obtained with the
help of OA Ryder and the San Diego Zoo. Genbank
accession numbers for all genes presented in this manuscript and a species cladogram for all species used in
the present study are available in Figure 6.
TAAR1 was amplified from genomic DNA by trialand-error using primers designed against the dog genome as well as conserved regions between the dog and
cat genomes. Following verification of product size and
specificity on a 1.5% agarose gel, the PCR products were
purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was
performed using the CEQ8000 Genetic Analysis System
and CEQ DTSC Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter). For
all species under study, both strands were sequenced
and analyzed using Vector NTI (Invitrogen).
TAAR1 knockout mice and wild type mice were
derived from six pairs of heterozygous mice given to us
as a gift by Lundbeck Research USA, Inc[22]. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Animal
Experimentation Protocol approved by the Harvard
Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. Fresh
post-mortem brain tissue from mongrel dog sacrificed
for unrelated purposes was obtained with the help of

our mouse colony at the New England Primate Research
Center (Southborough, MA). Dog striatum offered
enough tissue to allow preparation from a single animal
while mouse tissues were pooled. All procedures were
conducted in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Protocol approved by the Harvard Medical Area
Standing Committee on Animals. Fresh tissues were
homogenized in 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes with
10× volume of ice-cold unbuffered 0.32 M sucrose solution (pH 7.0), using a motor-driven pellet pestle. The
homogenate was centrifuged (1000 g, 10 min at 4°C) to
yield a crude nuclear pellet and low-speed supernatant.
The low-speed supernatant fraction was carefully transferred into another fresh tube and centrifuged at 10,000
g and 4°C for 20 min to yield a synaptosome-containing
pellet. The resulting pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume of ice-cold uptake buffer (a modified
Krebs buffer: 25 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1 μM pargyline,
2 mg/ml glucose, and 0.2 mg/ml ascorbic acid, pH 7.5)
for further assays.
50 uL of the synaptosome preparation was added
into 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes and exposed to
[3H]dopamine (10 nM; 60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life
and Analytical Sciences) only or combined with 100
nM b-PEA at 25°C in uptake buffer for various times
as indicated. The uptake by the synaptosomes at
30 min in [ 3 H]dopamine only was taken as maximal
uptake (100%). Non-specific uptake was defined in the
presence of 10 μM methylphenidate. Uptake reactions
were terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold uptake
buffer into the tubes and immediate centrifugation at
1,000 g (for cells) or 10,000 g (for synaptosomes) at
4°C for 3 min. The resulting pellets were rinsed
twice with 1 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer and then
incubated in 1× PLB buffer for 30 min on a shaking
platform at 200 rpm, prior to being transferred
into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of Beckman
ReadySafe scintillation cocktail and counted on a Beckman LS6000IC scintillation spectrophotometer for
1 min/sample.
For studies of intact genes, nucleotide sequences were
aligned in-frame using ClustalW, while alignments
including pseudogenes were made directly from nucleotide sequences[30]. Trees were generated with RAxML
[19,31,32] using a maximum likelihood inference and
validation with 1000 bootstrap analyses. CAFE[33] was
used to attempt to model the birth and death processes
in primates with a maximum likelihood value of l,
probability of gene birth or death per million years, calculated as 0.0141. However with existing data the distribution of pseudogenes was not significantly different
than expected. dN/dS (KA/KS) values for protein-coding

Page 8 of 9

sequences were calculated using PAML (using model 1,
free ratio, in codeml) as well as the Li et al. [34] and
Yang and Neilsen [35] methods with no significant differences observed.
PAML was used to test for branch-specific evolution
in codeml. The parameters are shown below in Additional file 4. Specifically we tested the hypotheses that
either the TAAR1 clade or TAAR5 clade of Figure 1
had a significantly different dN/dS ratio than the remainder of the tree. Significance values were obtained by
2
comparing the likelihood ratio statistics (2 Δℓ) to a  df
with degrees of freedom equal to the difference between
number of parameters in the model. PAML was also
used to test site-specific evolution. Parameters for sitespecific evolution are shown in Additional file 5. The
hypothesis tested whether there were any sites under
positive selection in TAAR1. Significance was calculated
as above.
