Abstract
Background: The increasing number of available genomic sequences makes it now possible to study the
evolutionary history of specific genes or gene families. Transcription factors (TFs) involved in regulation
of gene-specific expression are key players in the evolution of metazoan development. The low complexity
COE (Collier/Olfactory-1/Early B-Cell Factor) family of transcription factors constitutes a well-suited
paradigm for studying evolution of TF structure and function, including the specific question of protein
modularity. Here, we compare the structure of coe genes within the metazoan kingdom and report on the
mechanism behind a vertebrate-specific exon duplication.
Results: COE proteins display a modular organisation, with three highly conserved domains : a COEspecific DNA-binding domain (DBD), an Immunoglobulin/Plexin/transcription (IPT) domain and an atypical
Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) motif. Comparison of the splice structure of coe genes between cnidariae and
bilateriae shows that the ancestral COE DBD was built from 7 separate exons, with no evidence for exon
shuffling with other metazoan gene families. It also confirms the presence of an ancestral H1LH2 motif
present in all COE proteins which partly overlaps the repeated H2d-H2a motif first identified in rodent
EBF. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays show that formation of COE dimers is mediated by this
ancestral motif. The H2d-H2a α-helical repetition appears to be a vertebrate characteristic that originated
from a tandem exon duplication having taken place prior to the splitting between gnathostomes and
cyclostomes. We put-forward a two-step model for the inclusion of this exon in the vertebrate transcripts.
Conclusion: Three main features in the history of the coe gene family can be inferred from these analyses:
(i) each conserved domain of the ancestral coe gene was built from multiple exons and the same scattered
structure has been maintained throughout metazoan evolution. (ii) There exists a single coe gene copy per
metazoan genome except in vertebrates. The H2a-H2d duplication that is specific to vertebrate proteins
provides an example of a novel vertebrate characteristic, which may have been fixed early in the
gnathostome lineage. (iii) This duplication provides an interesting example of counter-selection of
alternative splicing.

Background
Thanks to the increasing number of available genomic
sequences, it has become possible to study the evolutionary history of specific genes or gene families in relation to
their co-option in innovations that have punctuated the
evolutionary diversification of metazoans. Transcription
factors (TFs) involved in regulation of gene-specific
expression are key players in the evolution of development. The COE family of transcription factors takes its
name from the founding members of the family, Collier
(Col) and Olfactory-1/Early-B-Cell Factor (Olf-1/EBF)
isolated from Drosophila and rodents, respectively [1-3].
While there was no evidence for coe genes in either fungi,
plants, or any of the various phyla of protozoans, identification of a cnidarian coe gene, Nvcoe, in the anthozoan sea
anemone Nemostella vectensis, suggested that COE proteins have appeared with metazoa [4], a conclusion
strengthened by the identification of COE members both
in other cnidaria and porifera [5]. While up to 4 ebf paralogs have been identified in vertebrates [6-8], a single coe
member has been identified in all the other animals for
which genome sequences have become available, suggesting that expansion of the coe gene family only occurred at
the origin of vertebrates.
Expression profiles of coe genes in embryos from various
protostomes and deuterostomes and N. vectensis have
revealed a common feature, namely, an expression in subsets of sensory neurons [4,9-14]. This feature raised the
possibility that one ancestral role of COE proteins was to
participate in the specification of specialised sensory cells
and the ontogeny of an elaborate nervous system [12].
However, genetic analyses performed in mice and, more
recently, Drosophila raised the possibility that another
ancestral function of COE proteins could have been in
development of cellular immunity [15,16]. The diversity
of COE protein functions strikingly contrasts with the
high degree of primary sequence conservation and lack of
expansion of this family of TFs throughout metazoan evolution. Owing to its low complexity, the COE family constitutes a well-suited paradigm for studying evolution of
TF structure and function, including the specific question
of protein modularity.
Pioneering analysis of EBF identified three functional
domains [1,17]: an amino-terminal, about 210 aminoacid long DBD which is the signature of COE proteins; ii)
a Helix-Helix dimerisation motif made of two tandemly
arranged α-helical repeats showing limited sequence similarity to the HLH motif described in basic helix-loophelix (b-HLH) proteins; iii) a transcription-activating
domain without marked specific signature. The presence
of an Ig-like/Plexin/Transcription Factor (IPT) domain
between the DBD and HLH domains was also noticed but
the function of this domain remains unknown [18,19].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/131

Comparison between Col and EBF showed that the DBD,
IPT and HLH domains have been particularly well conserved during evolution. However, one of the tandemly
arranged α-helices noted in EBF/Olf-1 was missing. This,
and further examination of the Col and EBF primary
sequences led us to postulate the existence, in all COE
proteins, of an HLH motif distinct from and partly overlapping the motif initially identified in EBF and Olf-1
[2,11]. This motif is designated below as H1LH2 while the
vertebrate-specific motif is designated as H2d-H2a, H2d
and H2a (d for duplicated, a for ancestral) corresponding
to the duplication of the single H2 helix found in Drosophila.
To get more insight into the evolutionary history of coe
genes, we compared in detail their genomic structure
between various metazoan phyla. This comparison shows
that the metazoan ancestor COE DBD was built from at
least 7 separate exons with no evidence for exon shuffling
with other gene families. Detailed analysis of various
chordate genomes and ESTs indicated that the H2d duplication has taken place in the vertebrate lineage prior to the
two rounds of whole genome duplication characterising
the origin of this taxon [20]. It thus provides an example
of a novel vertebrate characteristic, which may have been
fixed early in the gnathostome lineage. It also revealed
that the vertebrate-specific H2 duplication originated
from a two-step tandem exon duplication. Careful inspection of the intron phases leads us to put forward an original scenario that involves the selection of a new splice
donor site, resulting in the formation of a "cassette" H2d
exon. We show here that, alike EBF, Col does bind to DNA
as homodimer and that the ancestral H1LH2 motif mediates formation of Col/EBF homodimers and heterodimers. Incorporation of H2d in all four mammalian EBF
proteins reveals an interesting example of compulsory
counter-selection of alternative splicing following exon
duplication.

Methods
Search for COE/EBF related sequences in genomic and
ESTdatabases
Systematic searches for COE/EBF proteins were conducted
in available databases using the BLAST algorithm and
mouse COE sequences (Additional file 1) as query. The
databases analysed included current versions of the
genomes of Monosiga brevicollis, Nematostella vectensis,
Capitella capitata, Lottia gigantae, Branchiostoma floridae
[21], of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [22] as well as the
Ensembl databases of predicted proteins of Ciona intestinalis, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Monodelphis
domestica, Ornithorynchus anatinus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis and Danio rerio [23]. In Petromyzon marinus, the genomic scaffolds containing COE/EBF coding
sequences were retrieved from the pre-Ensembl genome

version available at [24]. Coding sequences were identified in these scaffolds with GeneWise [25] and assembled
using homologous sequences (>95% identity) identified
from Lampetra fluviatilis ESTs as templates. A survey of
ESTs annotated in the databanks for alternative transcript
variants included the use of AceView [26]. The sponge
Amphimedon queenslandica COE sequence was taken
from [5].
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
The alignment of Coe/EBF protein sequences was
obtained using MUSCLE [27] and checked by hand under
Bioedit [28]. Only full length sequences and unambiguously aligned segments were retained for the phylogenetic
analysis (see Additional file 2). Neighbor-Joining (NJ),
Maximum likelihood (ML) and bayesian (BI) phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using the Mega3.1
software, PhyML [29] and MrBayes 3.0 [30]. In each case,
we used the JTT model of sequence evolution with invariant+gamma distribution rates. Bootstrap proportions
(BP) were calculated by analysis of 1000 replicates for NJ
and by the RELL method [31] on the 2000 top-ranking
trees for ML analyses. In the BI analysis, four chains were
run for 2 million iterations with default heating parameters and sampled every 500 iterations; the first 2000 trees
were discarded as burn-in.
In vitro translation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift
Assays
The pEThBF1 [17], pET15bHis-mEBF1 (a gift from J. Hagman) and pET17bHis Col plasmids and deletions therein
were used for in vitro transcription/translation of EBF,
EBF*, EBFΔH1, EBFΔH2, Col, Col*, ColΔH1, ColΔH2 and
ColΔH2L. To generate internal deletions corresponding to
the H1 and H2 helices, we used the four oligonucleotides
PCR method [32]. In vitro transcription and translation
using rabbit reticulocyte lysate was as described by the
manufacturer (kit L1170, Promega). For each protein synthesised, the efficiency of translation was assessed by SDS
PAGE of parallel translation reactions performed in the
presence of 35Smethionine. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSA) were performed in the conditions
described by [33], using either a 125 bp DNA fragment
containing mb-1 promoter sequences (from -250 to -115)
which includes the EBF binding site 5'-AGACTCaaGGGAAT-3' or the PAL probe which contains the palindromic site 5'-ATTCCCaaGGGAAT-3' [1,33] and data not
shown. Competition experiments were performed using a
100× molar excess of 30 bp oligonucleotides containing
either the wild type 5' -CTAGAGAGAGACTCAAGGGAATTGTGGCCAGCCC- 3' or mutated CTAGAGAGAGACTCAACCGAATTGTGGCCAGCCC3'
mb-1
recognition site, as described in [17].

Fly strains
The P [col5cDNA]; col1 strain designated in Fig.S4 as col1
and UAS-col strains have been described in [34]. The P
[col5cDNA] transgene rescues the embryonic lethality but
not the wing defects of col1 mutants. The UAS-Mm ebf and
UAS-Mm ebf2 constructs were made by cloning the entire
ebf/ebf2 open reading frame in the pUAST vector. Three
independent lines were used for ectopic expression assays.
All other stocks were obtained from the Bloomington
Stock Center and described in Flybase [35].

Results
The coe gene family
The recent identification of coe sequences in cnidarians
and poriferans [4,5], together with the absence of evidence for coe genes outside metazoans suggests that COE
proteins have appeared with this taxon. In line with this
conclusion, no COE-related sequence could be identified
in the genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, while COE sequences have been reported in the
sponge Amphimedon queenslandica and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [4,5]. In order to obtain an
exhaustive characterisation of COE proteins and their
relationships in metazoans, we first updated the phylogenetic analysis available for this family [4], taking advantage of the wide range of genomes now available (Fig. 1
and see Additional file 2). Systematic searches for coe/ebf
related sequences were carried out in the genome of a
diploblast, two ecdysozoans (fly Drosophila melanogaster and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans), two
lophochotrozoans (annelid Capitella capitata and mollusc Lottia gigantae), an echinoderm (sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus),
the
cephalochordate
Branchiostoma floridae, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis
and eight vertebrates, including the lamprey Petromyzon
marinus, the platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus and the
oppossum Monodelphis domestica in addition to the
mouse, human, chick, xenopus (X. tropicalis) and
zebrafish (see Additional file 1 for accession numbers and
nomenclature of each gene). A single coe gene was found
in all metazoans studied, except in vertebrates, with evidence for three genes in Xenopus, and a fourth one in the
four mammals studied as previously reported in the
mouse and human [4], but also in the zebrafish. In P.
marinus, two distinct clusters, spanning the 5' part of the
coding region and including the HLH region were reconstructed from the genome, thus pointing to the presence
of at least two coe genes in lampreys. The phylogenetic
analysis was conducted using NJ, ML and bayesian algorithms, excluding highly divergent sequences as well as
heavily truncated ones but retaining representatives of
ecdysozoans, lophotrochozoans and of the major chordate taxa (see Additional file 2). In the resulting trees (Fig.
1), protostome, as well as lophotrochozoan coe sequences
were found clustered in monophyletic groups in NJ, ML

and BI, albeit with low statistical supports except in NJ
(BP= 91 and 90 respectively). Similarly, the monophyly of
the vertebrate sequences retained in the reconstruction
was retrieved whatever the algorithm used, with moderate
to good statistical supports in BI and ML (respectively PP

= 1 and BP = 79; but BP = 50 in NJ), thus supporting and
extending the results obtained by Pang et al., 2004. Inside
this group, all three reconstruction methods also confirmed the previously reported presence of four additional
monophyletic groups. Three of them contain at least one
zebrafish or one Xenopus sequence in addition to one
mammalian sequence (either COE1, COE2, or COE3).
These groups were named accordingly COE1, COE2, both
strongly supported (PP = 1 in BI, BP = 100 in NJ and ML),
and COE3, less well supported in BI (PP = 0.38, but BP =
82 in ML and 100 in NJ). The fourth group (PP = 1 in BI,
BP = 98 in ML and NJ) only contains mammalian
sequences, clustering with mouse EBF4. Together with the
identification of COE1, COE2, COE3 and EBF4 partial
sequences in the platypus O. anatinus (excluded from the
reconstruction due to truncations in the available
sequences: see Additional file 3), this clearly indicates that
the emergence of the EBF4 class has predated the mammalian radiation. The branching order observed for this
group, always found as a sister group of all other vertebrate sequences (albeit with poor statistical supports),
may be taken as evidence for an ancient origin in the vertebrate lineage, with subsequent losses in actinopterygians, amphibians and archosaurs (the three chick genes
appearing respectively related to the COE1, COE2 and
COE3 classes, see Additional file 3). However, a reconstruction artefact possibly related to the relatively long
branches observed in this group among mammals
remains difficult to exclude. Finally, the relative branching
orders of the lamprey sequence included in the analyses
(termed PmCOE-A) and of one of the zebrafish sequences
(termed DrCOE) (Fig. 1) were found to vary depending
on the algorithm and could not be resolved. Altogether,
the phylogenomic analysis supports the conclusion that
all vertebrate coe genes included in the reconstruction are
derived from a single ancestral coe gene, present in the
vertebrate lineage prior to the splitting between gnathostomes and cyclostomes. It also confirms the presence of
four COE classes in gnathostomes. The emergence of three
of them (COE1-3) is likely to have been linked to the two
rounds of whole genome duplication that have occurred
in the vertebrate lineage prior to the gnathostome radiation, while the origin of the fourth one (EBF4), which
only contains mammalian sequences, is less clear. Finally,
the chronology of the corresponding gene duplications
relative to the cyclostome-gnathostome divergence, as
well as the relationships of the lamprey genes with the
four gnathostome classes, remained unresolved. Even
though the number of genes identified in the lamprey and
mammals (2 versus 4) is suggestive of the occurrence of a
first round of duplication prior to the cyclostome-gnathostome splitting and a second one after their divergence,
the phylogeny does not allow firm conclusions on this
point.

The metazoan ancestor COE DBD was built from multiple
"unique" exons
In vitro functional dissection of EBF, when EBF was a pioneer protein, delineated the COE DBD which turned out
to be unrelated to other, previously characterised DBDs,
except for the presence of a zinc coordination motif
[1,17]. Sequence conservation between EBF1 and Drosophila Col then showed that this DBD constituted the
molecular trademark of a new family of transcription factors designated as COE proteins [2,11]. Sequence alignments between representative members of different phyla
highlight the high degree of evolutionary conservation of
each of the three COE-specific domains, the DBD, IPT and
atypical HLH domains as well as scattered blocks of
sequence similarity in the carboxy-terminal transactivator
domain (TAD) (Fig. 2A and see Additional file 2). Fig. 2b
shows a diagrammatic comparison of the exon-intron
structure of coe genes between representatives of deuterostomes, including the chordate (Craniata) Mus musculus, the urochordate ascidian C. intestinalis and the
echinoderm Stongylocentrus purpuratus and representatives of protostomes, including the insect D. melanogaster
and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the cnidarian N. vectensis. An immediate outcome from this comparison was the remarkable conservation in number and
positions of introns, independent of the overall size of the
coe trancription units which ranges from around 10 kb in
C. elegans [10] to around 400 kb in mouse ebf1 [23]. This
showed that the ancestor coe gene was built from a complex set of multiple exons, and that this highly fragmented
structure was maintained throughout metazoan evolution. Functional domains in proteins are, on a large scale,
associated with protein coding exons in the genome [36].
It therefore came to us as a surprise to find that the COE
DBD was constructed from at least seven separate exons,
since introns are generally thought not have functions
[37] although more recent reports tend to suggest that
intron accumulation in conserved genes might be an
adaptive process [38]. Since each of the 6 introns interrupting the DBD is found at the same position and in the
same phase in deuterostomes, protostomes and cnidarians, we conclude that this splice structure is ancestral with
the variation of exon number observed, for example in
Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans reflecting secondary lineage-specific loss of introns (Fig. 2B and not
shown; [39,40]. Similarly, introns interrupting the IPT
and HLH domains are also lost in D. melanogaster (Fig.
2b) Contrasting with the conservation of length and primary sequence of the DBD and the IPT+HLH domains,
significant primary sequence variation between different
phyla is observed at the junction between the DBD and
IPT domains (see Additional file 2). This correlates with a
variable position of the intron separating these two
domains (intron i8 in ebf, Fig. 2B) within a "linker"
region whose sequence and length is itself variable (see

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/131

Additional file 3). Further sequence variation in this
region is conferred by the use of two different E8 splice
donor sites, resulting in EBF isoforms differing by the
inclusion or not of a 8 to 10 amino acids, the possible
functional consequences of which remains to be
addressed. Domain exchange and/or accretion between
proteins resulting from exon shuffling is believed to be
one of the driving forces behind protein evolution. During this process, symmetrical exons,i.e. exons flanked by
same-phase introns, can be either deleted, duplicated or
inserted, without disrupting the downstream protein
reading frame [41]. Since, except for exon E6, all the exons
contributing the COE DBD are asymmetrical (Fig. 2B),
this domain could not be constructed from accretion of
subdomains present in other bilaterian proteins through
exon shuffling. Consistent with this conclusion, systematic blast-search analyses with individual DBD exons
failed to retrieve proteins other than COE proteins from
databanks. A comprehensive theory to explain intron
abundance and high level of position conservation
among species is still missing [42]. How the COE-specific
DBD structure was put together in first place remains
therefore a fascinating question.
The modified HLH motif of EBF proteins is a vertebrate
innovation
A noticeable difference between EBF and Drosophila Col
is the specific duplication of a short α-helical region in
EBF (H2d-H2a tandem repetition, Fig. 2A,C). Because of
remote sequence similarity, this H2 tandem repetition
was originally proposed to constitute a dimerisation similar to that present in b-HLH proteins found in fungi,
plants and metazoans [1,3,43]. The absence of H2d in
Drosophila Col led us, however, to propose the existence
of an alternative Helix-Linker-Helix (H1LH2) domain
[2,11]. Sequence comparison of a wide range of metazoans shows that the H1LH2 motif is an ancestral character
(see Additional file 2). The predicted primary sequence of
COE proteins in cephalochordates and urochordates,
which are considered as the closest living relatives of the
vertebrate ancestor [12,44,45], suggested that the H2dH2a duplication was a vertebrate-specific feature. To confirm a conclusion mostly based on ESTs analysis, we
retrieved the intronic sequences comprised between the
H1 and H2a coding exons in representatives of the major
chordate groups outside vertebrates, C. intestinalis, B.
floridae and S. purpuratus and verified the absence of
H2d-related coding sequence (see Additional file 3). In
contrast, all the gnathostome sequences retrieved from
the genomes analysed, including not only the four COE13 and EBF4 classes but also the unassigned zebrafish
DrCOE sequence, exhibit the H2d addition, strongly suggesting that the H2a-H2d duplication predated the gnathostome radiation (see Additional file 2). In the lamprey P.
marinus, we found no evidence for the presence of H2d in

the Pmcoe-A locus, but a definitive conclusion could not
be obtained in this case due to sequence gaps between the
H1 and H2a coding regions in the current genome version. In contrast, the presence of H2d could be unambiguously recognised, and at the expected position, in the
deduced PmCOE-B amino acid sequence (see Additional
file 3). Preliminary EST analyses of a closely related lamprey species, Lampetra fluviatilis, confirmed the presence
of H2d in transcripts of the orthologous Lfcoe-B gene but
also highlighted the presence of alternatively spliced
forms, devoid of the duplicated H2 sequence (see Additional file 4). The presence of H2d in lamprey LCOE-B
may thus be subject to alternative splicing, while no indication for a similar process has been obtained thus far in
gnathostomes. Taken together, these data indicate that the
H2 duplication occurred early in the vertebrate lineage,
prior to splitting between gnathostomes and cyclostomes,
in a single copy ancestral gene from which all gnathostome and at least the lamprey coe-A genes are derived.
They also suggest that this additional protein domain may
have been fixed early in the gnathostome lineage.
The COE-HLH dimerisation motif revisited
EBF/Olf-1 was initially isolated as a nuclear factor recognising functionally important cis-regulatory DNA
sequences in the promoter of mb-1, an early B-lymphocyte specific gene and olfactory marker protein genes
[46,47]. Further characterisation showed that EBF/Olf-1
recognises variations on the palindromic sequence TTCCCNNGGGAAT and binds DNA as a homodimer
[1,3,33]. It was thus proposed that homodimer formation
was mediated by the H2d-H2a α-helical repetition
[1,3,17] (see Fig. 2A). The absence of H2d in COE proteins outside vertebrates (Fig. 2C) raised, however, the
question of whether all COE proteins could bind DNA as
dimers and, if so, which motif was involved in dimer formation. We therefore proposed that the H1LH2a motif
that is found in all COE proteins was playing this role. To
experimentally address this question, we compared the
dimerization properties of Drosophila Col and EBF and
modified versions of these two proteins (Fig. 3A and see
Additional file 5), using gel-shift assays with the vertebrate mb-1 promoter DNA. We first found that Col forms
complexes with mb-1 DNA that migrate at the same position than EBF/mb-1 complexes, without evidence of fast
migrating complexes which would correspond to monomers (Fig. 3B). We could therefore conclude that, similar
to EBF, Col binds to DNA as homodimer. Truncated
forms of EBF and Col, that lack the transactivation
domain (designated below as EBF* and Col*, respectively, Fig. 3A) form complexes of higher mobility than
the full-length proteins ([1], Fig. 3B,D). We took advantage of this higher mobility to assay Col ability to form
heterodimers with EBF, using a mixture of full length Col
or EBF and EBF*. The formation of three types of DNA/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/131

protein complexes (Fig. 3B,C) indicated that Col is able to
form heterodimers with EBF. Interestingly, Col/EBF heterodimer formation was favoured over homodimer formation (Fig. 3B,C and data not shown). Since binding to
mb-1 DNA is an indirect assay for dimer formation, this
observation which could indicate either favoured heterodimerization or higher DNA binding affinity of heterodimers needs to be further investigated. Above all,
these data indicated that H2d is not required for dimerisation of COE proteins. Conversely, a truncated EBF-4 protein containing H2d but lacking H2a (OE-4S) was
reported to bind to DNA as homodimer [7]. Together,
these data allow to conclude that the presence of a single
copy of H2 is sufficient for binding of COE proteins to
bind DNA as dimers. We then tested the specific requirement both for H1 and H2 (H2a or H2a and H2d), by precisely removing either helical domain in Col or EBF*
(ColΔH1/ColΔH2a and EBF*ΔH1/EBF*ΔH2 proteins,
respectively Fig. 3A). Neither deleted protein form was
able to bind to DNA, when co-expressed with either EBF*
or Col* (Fig. 3C,D and not shown). This led us to conclude that the presence of both H1 and at least one H2 are
essential for COE dimer formation and that the ancestral
H1-L-H2a mediate dimerisation of COE proteins.
A two-step evolutionary scenario for inclusion of H2d in
vertebrate EBF
All gnathostome coe/ebf cDNAs analysed to date include
H2d. To investigate the possible mechanisms behind this
inclusion, we compared in detail the genomic structure of
the HLH region between gnathostomes and their closest
relatives, the urochordates [45], for which genomic
sequences are available. Each of the 3 α-helical repeats
present in human EBF (H1, H2d and H2a) is encoded by
a separate exon, (exons E11, E12 and E13, separated by
introns i11 and i12, respectively, Fig. 2B,C). An intron
also found between H1 and H2a in C. intestinalis Ci-coe,
designated i11-12 must have predated the separation
between urochordates and vertebrates. The presence of
this intron in other deuterostomes, the cephalochordate
B. floridae and the echinoderm Strongylocentrus purpuratus but also the cnidarian N. vectensis (Fig. 2B) confirmed
its ancestral character (Fig. 4A). Both i11, i12 and i11/12
are phase 0 introns, which could indicate a simple scenario whereby a tandem duplication of the exon encoding
ancestral H2a would be at the origin of vertebrate H2d.
Such a straightforward scenario is not compatible, however, with the position and phase of the 3'-next intron
(i13) which, both in C. intestinalis and mammals, is neither situated immediately downstream of the H2 coding
sequence nor a phase 0 but a phase 1 intron (Fig. 2B and
4A,B). Since only symmetrical exons can be inserted into
introns, of the same phase, without disrupting the downstream reading frame, this observation rules out a simple
exon E12 duplication and implies a secondary event. We

therefore propose the following two-steps model: First, a
duplication of exon E13 (Fig. 4B) led to a situation where
either one of the ancestral or duplicated exon, but not
both, could be incorporated in the mature mRNA, a classical case of mandatory alternative splicing [48,49]. Second, selection of a new splice donor site, a few nucleotides

downstream of the H2d coding region, restored a phase 0
intron (Fig. 4C), allowing both H2a and H2d to be
inserted into the reading frame (Fig. 4D). Other possible
scenarii were envisaged, using different intronic recombination events, but none appeared to be more parsimonious than the two-step scenario that we put forward here.

COE proteins
A two-step scenario for the H2 duplication in vertebrate
A two-step scenario for the H2 duplication in vertebrate COE proteins. (A) Exon-intron structure of the H1H2a HLH motif in the coe ancestor gene; the phase of introns
is indicated, with phase 0 introns in red and phase 1 introns
in black. (B) The first step in H2 duplication was a duplication
of the exon encoding H2a. Because of the splice phase rule,
this could only result in alternative splicing out either the
ancestral (H2a, dotted angled line) or the newly created
exon (H2d, solid angled line). (C) The second step was the
activation of a cryptic 3' splice donor site, downstream of the
H2d coding region (blue arrowhead). This resulted in same
phase i11 and i12 introns and the incorporation of H2d into
COE proteins (D). Note that H2d exon-skipping can theoretically occur (dotted angled line).
Of the two vertebrate H2, the C-terminal is the more
closely related to the single H2 of invertebrates (Fig. 2D
and S2), indicating that the duplicated helix has started to
diverge. The "cassette" H2d exon can theoretically be
inserted or removed from the transcript without affecting
the rest of the protein. Removal of the H2d exon from the
mature ebf mRNAs through exon-skipping (Fig. 4D,
dashed line) would restore an invertebrate-like protein.
However, we could not find evidence for H2d exon skipping in gnathostome COE proteins, either by surveying
ESTs annotated in the databanks (AceView; [26]) or by
PCR amplification of this coding region in mouse coe1,
coe2 and coe4, using specifically designed primers with
mRNA from several different tissues (data not shown).
Therefore we conclude that in gnathostomes, the prevalent form of COE proteins results from the compulsory
inclusion of H2d. This inclusion therefore represents an
interesting case of counter-selection of exon-skipping, a

The COE family of transcription factors was first defined
by the sequence similarity between rodent EBF/Olf-1 and
Drosophila Col [1-3]. Cloning of a coe cDNA from the cnidarian N. vectensis and identification of coe sequences in
another cnidarian, hydra magnipapillata and a poriferan,
the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica [4,5] strengthened
the conclusion that coe genes are metazoan-specific genes.
Our systematic blast-search for coe orthologs in DNA
sequence databanks confirmed that coe genes are metazoan genes present at a single copy per genome, except for
vertebrates. It further showed a remarkable degree of conservation of the coe genomic structure throughout metazoan evolution, except for one exon duplication in the
vertebrate lineage.
The scattered structure of coe genes
All introns found in the cnidaria N. vectensis Nvcoe gene are
also found, at the same position, in deuterostomes and at
least one of the protostomes examined, suggesting that
this scattered organisation was already present in the
metazoan ancestral coe gene. In case of the DBD, which is
both specific of COE proteins and conserved to the same
degree over its entire length, a split structure into 7 exons
was rather unexpected. Moreover, we could not find evidence for exon shuffling with other gene families, consistent with the conserved asymmetric intron phases, but
leaving intact the question of the genomic building up of
this unique DNA binding domain. The HCCC zinc finger
structure proposed to be an essential feature of the EBF
DNA-binding domain [17] is itself encoded by two exons,
already in the last common cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor
(E5 and E6, Fig. 2B), suggesting a bipartite origin. Since
exon E6 is symmetrical, it can possibly be subject to regulated exon-skipping, allowing for the production of different protein isoforms, with putatively different functions.
Whereas there is some preliminary evidence for it, as a
subclass of human EBF1 cDNAs may differ from the main
class by the loss of exon E6 (AceView; [26] the i5 intron
has been lost in some protostomes, such as Drosophila melanogaster (Fig. 2B). Systematic genome sequencing programs should soon give access to the coe gene structure in
many additional phyla, including sister clades of bilateriae. It offers the exciting prospect of deeper insight into
the evolutionary roots of the coe gene family and their
scattered genomic organisation.
The ancestral COE HLH motif revisited
Sequence similarity of the ancestral COE H1LH2 motif
with the HLH motif of basic-HLH proteins [43] has led to

classify COE proteins as one distant subgroup in this
superfamily of proteins, despite displaying distinctive
DBD and additional protein domains [5,51]. In vitro
DNA binding assays show that the H1LH2 motif is
required for binding of COE proteins to DNA as dimers.
This conclusion differs from the initial report that the EBF
dimerisation motif was H2d-H2a, a conclusion supported
by the analysis of two different deletions in EBF. Indeed,
an internal deletion of EBF removing amino acids 296 to
367 (EBFΔ296–367), namely H1 and part of the IPT
domain, was reported to lower but not prevent dimer formation [1]. Since we found that removal of H1 alone in
either EBF or Col abolished dimer formation, one possibility is that the presence of the IPT domain interferes with
the ability of the H2d-H2a repeat to mediate homophilic
interactions. In support of this possibility, the H2d-H2a
repeat, when taken out of its normal context, is able to
promote formation of dimers, as shown by using a truncated nuclear hormone receptor lacking its own dimerization domain [17]). The high degree of sequence
conservation of the COE IPT domain (see Additional file
3) suggests that this domain is subject to very stringent
structural and functional constraints. Together, our results
from DNA-binding assays and those reported by [1], further suggest that the positioning of the IPT and HLH
domains in relation to one another is a critical aspect of
COE dimer formation. Hagman et al; 1995 [17] also
reported that a modified EBF protein lacking amino acids
370 to 383 (EBFΔ370–383), i.e., part of H2d, leaving intact
H2a (see Additional file 5), showed a drastically reduced
level of binding to mb1 DNA, suggesting that H2d was
essential for forming EBF homodimers. Yet, the 370 to
383 a.a. deletion does not only remove part of H2d but
also part of the linker separating H1 and H2 (see Additional file 5). Our data suggest that it is removal of this
linker rather than H2d itself which prevents EBF dimer
formation. The conservation of sequence and genomic
structure of this Proline-rich linker throughout metazoan
evolution (see Additional files 2 and 3) supports a key
role in positioning H1 and H2 relative to each other and
contribution to the DNA-binding specificity of COE dimers. While efficient in vitro binding to DNA of either Col
dimers, Col/EBF heterodimers or dimers of EBF isoforms
lacking either H2a (Fig. 3) or H2d [7] indicates that the
H2 duplication is not essential for EBF dimer formation,
inclusion of a duplicated helix2 raises the interesting possibility that it could result in an increased partnership flexibility and functional versatility of the vertebrate COE
proteins. The observation that Col/EBF heterodimers
more efficiently form and/or bind to DNA, at least in
vitro, raises the speculative hypothesis that it could have
been the initial force behind the selection of H2 exon
inclusion.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/131

Counter-selection of alternative splicing
Together, the compared structures of vertebrate and urochordate coe genes between echinoderms, cephalochordates, urochordates and a wide range of vertebrates,
including cyclostomes suggest that the duplication of H2
occurred in the vertebrate ancestor and resulted from an
exon-duplication event. This is the only major change in
the modular structure of COE proteins that appears to
have been fixed throughout metazoan evolution. Exon
duplication is one widely used mechanism for adding a
coding region within an existing gene. Alternative splicing
of duplicated exons has been postulated to favor protein
diversification, since each exon can, in principle, evolve
independently of the other [48,49]. Recent genomic studies have suggested that 40–60% of human genes are alternatively spliced and comparative analysis of close to
10,000 orthologous genes in human and mouse has
shown that alternative splicing is frequently associated
with recent exon creation and/or loss [52]. However,
other studies suggest that the contribution of gene duplication, followed by sequence divergence and alternative
splicing to the diversification of the protein repertoire
could be substantially different [53]. In the case of the vertebrate coe genes, alternative splicing was not selected by
evolution following exon H2d duplication, since both H2
repeats are incorporated in the EBF proteins. Taking into
account the splice frame rules, we put forward here an
original two-step model to account for the inclusion of
H2d in vertebrate COE proteins (Fig. 4). The first step in
our model is a classical tandem duplication of an "ancestral" H2a coding exon. However, this exon was probably
not symmetrical (see Fig. 2B) and, due the splice frame
rule, only the ancestral or the duplicated exon could be
incorporated in the coding transcript without disrupting
the open reading frame, a classical case of mandatory
alternative splicing [48,49]. We believe that inclusion of
the duplicated exon occured via the activation of a phase
0 splice donor site, 3' to H2 in the duplicated exon This
allowed the incorporating of H2d, while preserving the
open reading frame (see Fig. 4D). To our knowledge such
a two-step selection of a cassette exon has not yet been
invoked for other proteins.

While our data underline the conservation of coe protein
structure throughout evolution, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-context dependence of COE regulatory targets remains unknown. For example, mouse
EBF/COE1 or EBF2/COE2 can substitute for Col activity
in UAS-Gal4 transgenic assays [54], using as a paradigm
Col function in patterning of the wing [34], indicating
that Col and EBF are able to regulate similar set of genes
in a tissue-dependent manner (see Additional file 6). So
far, little insight was obtained from systematic searches
for EBF or Col directly protein interactors [55,56]. This
remains a pre-eminent question in view of the evolution-

ary diversification of the biological functions of COE proteins revealed by mutant analyses in both mouse, C.
elegans and Drosophila [57-60]. Within this context,
more extensive analysis of genomic structure, expression
and function of COE proteins in other phyla could be of
primary interest.

Conclusion
Our systematic blast-search for coe (collier/olf-1/ebf)
orthologs in DNA sequence databanks confirmed that coe
genes are metazoan genes present at a single copy per
genome, except for vertebrates. It further showed a
remarkable degree of conservation of the coe genomic
structure throughout metazoan evolution, except for one
exon duplication in the vertebrate lineage, leading to a
modified dimerisation domain of structure H1lH2dH2a
in vertebrates and HLH2a in all other metazoans. Taking
into account the splice frame rules, we put forward here
an original two-step duplication model to account for
H2d inclusion in vertebrate COE proteins The vertebrate
gene configuration is such that it remains possible to
remove H2d through alternative splicing, through exonskipping. However, the presence of both H2d and H2a in
all gnathostome coe/ebf transcripts characterised to date
both indicates that, in this case, exon-skipping is highly
counter-selected. While in vitro experiments indicate that
the H2 duplication is not essential for binding of COE
proteins to DNA as dimers, it raises the interesting possibility that it could result in an increased partnership flexibility and functional versatility of the vertebrate COE
proteins.
