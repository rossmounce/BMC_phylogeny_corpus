Abstract
Background: The data on the embryonic origin of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) from either
deep embryonic veins or mesenchymal (or circulating) lymphangioblasts presently available remain
inconsistent. In various vertebrates, markers for LECs are first expressed in specific segments of
embryonic veins arguing for a venous origin of lymph vessels. Very recently, studies on the mouse
have strongly supported this view. However, in the chick, we have observed a dual origin of LECs
from veins and from mesodermal lymphangioblasts. Additionally, in murine embryos we have
detected mesenchymal cells that co-express LEC markers and the pan-leukocyte marker CD45.
Here, we have characterized the mesoderm of murine embryos with LEC markers Prox1, Lyve-1
and LA102 in combination with macrophage markers CD11b and F4/80.
Results: We observed cells co-expressing both types of markers (e.g. Prox1 – Lyve-1 – F4/80
triple-positive) located in the mesoderm, immediately adjacent to, and within lymph vessels. Our
proliferation studies with Ki-67 antibodies showed high proliferative capacities of both the Lyve-1positive LECs of lymph sacs/lymphatic sprouts and the Lyve-1-positive mesenchymal cells.
Conclusion: Our data argue for a dual origin of LECs in the mouse, although the primary source
of embryonic LECs may reside in specific embryonic veins and mesenchymal lymphangioblasts
integrated secondarily into lymph vessels. The impact of a dual source of LECs for ontogenetic,
phylogenetic and pathological lymphangiogenesis is discussed.

Background
The important physiological and pathophysiological roles
of the lymphatic vascular system for fluid homeostasis,
immune surveillance, inflammation and tumour metastasis justify intensive studies of this hardly visible portion of
the vascular system [1,2]. Insufficient development of
lymph vessels becomes immediately apparent as lymph
oedema, which mostly affects the legs and the genital

region of patients. Primary lymph oedema (Nonne-Milroy Syndrome) is caused by mutations in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
Receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) gene on 5q35.3 [3,4]. Kaposi's sarcoma probably represents a form of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) hyperplasia [5], but circulating precursor
cells may also be involved [6]. However, it is still not clear
whether lymphangioma, which is found in 1.2 – 2.8‰ of

infants [7], is due to hyperplasia of LECs or structural malformations of lymph vessels [8]. These uncertainties with
respect to the pathobiology of lymph vessels are based on
the fact that the mechanisms of normal embryonic lymphangiogenesis and the origin of LECs are not sufficiently
well understood.
Following the identification of specific markers for LECs,
our knowledge of the structure and function of lymph vessels and the molecular equipment of LECs has increased
enormously in recent years [9,10]. Nevertheless, the
embryonic origin of the lymphatic vascular system has
been discussed controversially for more than a hundred
years, and is still open for discussion. The two main theories are the 'centrifugal' and 'centripetal' theory. The first
was set up by Sabin [11,12] and Lewis [13] and proposes
a venous origin of the lymph sacs (which are the first clear
morphological signs of lymph vessel development), with
subsequent sprouting of lymph vessels into all tissues and
organs of the body. The second was set up by Huntington
and McClure [14] and proposes formation of lymphatic
vessels from mesenchymal 'lymphatic clefts', which, nowadays, are called lymphangioblasts. Several recent studies
clearly show development of LECs from the venous system in the murine embryo [15-17]. However, an intermediate position favouring a dual origin from embryonic
veins and mesenchymal lymphangioblasts was defined by
studies on avian embryos and Xenopus tadpoles [18-20].
Migration of mesenchymal lymphangioblasts, which are
originally located in the venous system and delaminate
from the endothelium, has been observed in fish [21].
Additionally, our previous studies have demonstrated the
existence of mesenchymal cells which co-express leukocyte (CD45) and lymphendothelial markers (Prox1, Lyve1) in mouse embryos [19]. Recent studies on pathological
lymphangiogenesis in adult mice have provided evidence
of a role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells
(CEPCs) and macrophages (CD11b and F4/80 positive)
in this process [22-24]. Evidence of CEPCs in humans has
been provided in studies on post-transplantation Kaposi's
sarcoma [6] and kidney graft rejection [25].
The detection of cells, which co-express macrophage and
lymphendothelial markers in the adult mouse, prompted
us to investigate such cells in the murine embryo. We used
antibodies against CD31/PECAM-1, a pan-endothelial
marker, in combination with LEC-specific markers: Prox1,
a homeobox transcription factor, Lyve-1, a hyaluronan
receptor, and LA102, a recently defined new epitope on
LECs [26]. Double and triple staining were then performed with macrophage markers CD11b and F4/80.
These studies, in combination with the proliferation
marker Ki-67, provide evidence for the existence of
actively dividing mesenchymal cells, which co-express
macrophage and lymphendothelial markers in early

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/43

mouse embryos. The mesenchymal localization of the
cells in murine embryos suggests an additional source of
LECs, which may integrate into lymph vessels that have
primarily originated and sprouted from embryonic veins.
The existence of highly mobile (macrophage-like) cells
with LEC characteristics seems to be relevant for pathological lymphangiogenesis and inflammation-associated
organ rejection [reviews see: [27,28]].

Results
Cells with pan-endothelial, lymphendothelial and
macrophage characteristics
During early stages of lymphendothelial commitment,
the LEC markers Prox1 and Lyve-1 are expressed by cells
of the cardinal veins of the mouse on approximately
embryonic day (ED) 9.5 [17]. These cells are also positive
for CD31/PECAM-1, a pan-endothelial marker, which is
strongly expressed in blood endothelial cells (BECs) and
more weakly in LECs [29,30]. The precursor cells give rise
to lymph sacs which, in the jugular region, are located in
the angle between anterior and posterior cardinal veins
[15], as can be demonstrated by staining with anti-Lyve-1
antibodies (Fig. 1). However, the lymph sacs are not the
only structures which are Lyve-1-positive. There are large
numbers of scattered cells, preferentially located in the
loose mesenchyme (Fig. 1A). On ED 13.5 the lymphatic
vascular system of murine embryos is made up of a deep
and a superficial part. The deep part consists of the lymph
sacs located alongside the jugular segment of the cardinal
veins (Fig. 1A,B). The superficial lymphatics are located in
the dermis. They are connected to the deep system by lymphatic vessels, which are located in the mesenchyme
underneath the skeletal elements of the shoulder girdle.
Additionally, there are large numbers of scattered Lyve-1positive cells in the loose mesenchyme of the dermis, the
primitive meninges and the parapharyngeal region. The
neural tube, skeletal elements and muscles do not contain
such cells.

Our double staining protocol confirms that LECs of the
jugular lymph sacs are Prox1+ and Lyve-1+ (Fig. 1C). The
new lymphendothelial marker LA102, a monoclonal antibody recognizing a 25 – 27 kDa protein, specifically reacts
with lymphatic vessels of the adult mouse, except for
those of the thoracic duct and the marginal sinus of lymph
nodes, but not with any blood vessels [26]. We investigated the expression of LA102 during early embryonic
lymphangiogenesis of ED 11.5 – 13.5 mice and performed double staining with either Prox1 or Lyve-1. On
ED 12.5 and ED 13.5, we observed that LECs in the jugular lymph sacs were double positive for Prox1 and LA102
(Fig. 1D) as well as Lyve-1 and LA102 (Fig. 1E). The same
results hold true for the superficial lymphatics of the dermis (Fig. 1F). However, in the mediastinal region, we
found some lymphatic vessels which expressed only Lyve-

1, while others demonstrated Lyve-1 and LA102 coexpression (data not shown).
The data show that all three markers, Prox1, Lyve-1 and
LA102 are expressed by LECs of lymph sacs and lymph
vessels, although each is also expressed by some nonendothelial cell types. In order to characterize the scattered mesenchymal Lyve-1+ cells shown in Figure 1A, we
used double and triple staining with lymph/endothelial
and macrophage markers. In our previous studies, we
showed that some mesenchymal Lyve-1+ cells coexpressed Prox1 [19]. Here, we detected a small number
of Prox1+/CD31+ mesenchymal cells in the dermatomes
on ED 10 (Fig. 2A,B). CD31 expression in these cells,
which we regard as lymphangioblasts, is lower than in
BECs. Co-staining with LA102 and Prox1 antibodies
revealed that some scattered cells in the mesenchyme are
double positive (Fig. 2C). On ED 12.5 we observed single
cells in the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube
which co-expressed Lyve-1 and LA102, but there were also
cells only positive for LA102 (Fig. 2D). It has been
reported that CD11b+ macrophages may contribute to
pathological lymphangiogenesis in the cornea of adult
mice [22]. We detected a small number of Prox1+/CD11b+
cells in the mesenchyme of ED 12.5 mice (Fig. 2E). LECs
of the jugular lymph sacs on ED 13.5 were CD11b-negative, but a few Lyve-1+/CD11b+ cells were located immediately adjacent to the lymph sacs (Fig. 2F), and appeared to
be integrated into the superficial dermal lymph vessels
(Fig. 2G).
We then used the macrophage marker F4/80 for further
characterisation of mesenchymal Lyve-1+ cells. A large
number of scattered cells of the dermatomes, mediastinum and pimitive meninges co-expressed Lyve-1 and F4/
80 in ED 13.5 embryos and some cells expressed only
Lyve-1 or F4/80 (Fig. 3). There was a distinct difference
between the frequencies of CD11b+ and F4/80+ cells in the
mesenchyme. Many more F4/80+ cells could be found,
and many of these were Lyve-1+. We, therefore, extended
our studies by applying three markers: Prox1, Lyve-1 and
F4/80. We found cells in the developing lymph sacs positive for all three markers in ED 13.5 mice (Fig. 4A–F).
More peripherally, in developing lymph vessels, we also
found a small number of cells positive for all three markers (Fig. 5A,B). In very rare cases, we could observe various
marker combinations in adjacent cells of lymph vessels.
Figure 5A shows such an example with 3 cells: one positive only for F4/80, one expressing F4/80 and Lyve-1, and
a third positive for F4/80, Lyve-1 and Prox1. The fact that
two LEC markers, Prox1 and Lyve-1, can be found in F4/
80+ cells, which appear to be integrated into lymph vessels, is a strong indication for a mesenchymal source of
LECs in murine embryos.

Proliferation studies
Ki-67 is a well-established proliferation marker and is
increasingly expressed in the nucleus in all active phases
of the cell cycle, but not in G0 phase [31]. To extend our
studies on the source of LECs, we performed double staining with anti-Ki-67 and anti-Lyve-1 antibodies of ED 11.5
– 13.5 mice. Nuclei were counter stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI). Double positive LECs
could be detected in regions of active lymphangiogenesis:
the early jugular veins, the jugular lymph sacs, which
extended sprouts into dorso-lateral directions, the mediastinum and the dermis (Fig. 6). Mouse embryos on ED
11.5 exhibited very few cells in the cardinal veins positive
for both markers, whereas LECs of the developing jugular
lymph sacs as well as mesenchymal cells in the dermis coexpressed Ki-67 and Lyve-1 at high rates (Fig. 6A,B). The
dermatomes of ED 12.5 and 13.5 mice displayed scattered
Lyve-1+ cells, which also showed proliferating characteristics (55% and 33%, respectively; Fig. 7). However, the
total number of Lyve-1+ cells in the dermatomes was low
compared with the number of lymph sac ECs. In the jugular lymph sacs (Fig. 6C) and in sprouts derived from
them (Fig. 6D) the Ki-67 labelling rate was 22 – 30% (Fig.
7). The data show that a greater number of Lyve-1+ cells
are present in the lymph sacs than in the dermatomes, but
the latter proliferate at equal or, in ED 12.5 embryos, even
higher rates.

Discussion
Embryonic lymphangiogenesis
Our data show that there is a cell type in early mouse
development, which combines lymphendothelial (Lyve1+, Prox1+) and macrophage (F4/80+) characteristics.
Also, there are cells that express Lyve-1 and F4/80, as well
as cells that have only one of these markers. The triplepositive cells appear to be integrated into the lining of
early lymph vessels, and, in sum, the data are in favour of
an origin of LECs from mesenchymal, macrophage-like
cells. Although these cells may contribute only to the
minor part of the lymphovascular system, their existence
and possible contribution to pathological lymphangiogenesis should not be neglected.

Recent data by Srinivasan et al. [15] have provided clear
evidence that the major part of the lymphovascular system of mice is of venous origin. The jugular segment of the
cardinal veins is the source of the jugular lymph sacs,
which then grow into peripheral parts of the body. Prox1expressing venous ECs are the source of the jugular lymph
sacs in the anterior region of the embryo. The posterior
cardinal veins give rise to the posterior lymph sacs, which
are the source of the lymphatics in the mesenteries and the
posterior organs. The earliest Prox1-positive ECs are
located in the jugular segment of the cardinal veins of ED
9.75 mice. A third place of origin of lymphatics is the

Mouse embryos lacking Syk and Slp-76 functions develop
abnormal blood-lymph-endothelial connections, and
Slp-76 deficient cells confer this phenotype on chimeric
embryos [40,41]. Syk and Slp-76 are expressed in hematopoietic cells, but not in ECs. The incorporation of defective cells into abnormally fused lymph vessels and the
rescue of the phenotype by GFPSlp-67-expressing circulating cells indicate a hematopoietic origin of LECs [40].
Normal Syk and Slp-76 functions may be required in early
stages of development, when hemangioblasts divide into
hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Syk and Slp-76
are expressed by platelets and eosinophils, but not macrophages or dendritic cells [40].

orbital region [15]. Loss of Prox1 expression abolishes
development of lymphatics [17]. Regular development of
veins is another prerequisite for the generation of LECs.
The absence of Coup-TFII, an orphan nuclear receptor
transcription factor, causes embryonic death around ED
10, abnormal expression of arterial marker genes in the
veins, and loss of jugular lymph sacs [15,32-36]. A contribution of hematopoietic cells to the lymphatics does not
seem to exist. Runx1-null mice, which do not develop
definitive hematopoietic cell [37], have normal jugular
lymph sacs, and descendents of hematopoietic stem cells
are not detectable in the mouse carrying a reporter gene
under the control of the Runx1 promoter [15]. In all, these
data show that the venous system is the main source of the
embryonic lymphovascular system in mice.
Nevertheless, even the highly detailed studies on the
venous origin of embryonic LECs cannot rule out the possibility of a minor contribution of mesenchymal cells to
the lymphatics [15,17]. In both of the studies cited, scattered Prox1-positive cells were observed along the anteroposterior axis of the body wall of early embryos – at great
distances from the developing lymph sacs. In the transgenic mice studied by Srinivasan et al. [15] some cells
were detected, which did not fit into the anticipated pattern of the venous origin of LECs. Thus, there are some
observations that argue for an additional source of LECs.
The number of LECs derived from macrophage-like, mesenchymal precursors may be low, but that does not necessarily rule out functional importance. This is supported by
studies on Syk and Slp-76 knockout mice. These adapter
proteins mediate outside-in integrin signalling [38,39].

Incorporation of macrophages into lymph vessels has
been indicated by studies on pathological lymphangiogenesis [22-24]. Our studies strongly suggest that similar
mechanisms are found in embryonic lymphangiogenesis.
In the adult, macrophages originate from circulating
monocytes, but, in the embryo, their early development
in the mesoderm is independent of the hematopoietic system. They can be isolated from the epiblast before gastrulation. So, they are present before the development of
hematopoietic cells in blood islands [42]. After gastrulation, macrophages are found in all embryonic compartments, which is also evident in the studies presented here.
Mesenchymal macrophages can give rise to stationary
cells, which is best documented in the central nervous system (CNS) where they form the microglia [43], which has
self-renewal potential. Our studies provide initial evidence for the incorporation of macrophage-like cells into
the lining of lymph vessels during normal development.
There are large numbers of Lyve-1+ single cells in the mesenchyme of murine embryos, which are highly proliferative and obviously represent a heterogeneous cell
population. Many of the cells express the pan-leukocyte
marker CD45 [19]. Here, we show that some of the cells
co-express other LEC markers such as Prox1 and LA102.
Co-localization of Prox1 and CD31/PECAM-1 in scattered
cells in the dermatomes of ED 10 mouse embryos is a
strong indicator of a lymphangioblastic cell population.
Prox1 is the most reliable marker that distinguishes
between LECs and BECs in healthy and diseased tissues
[29,30], and CD31 is a highly reliable pan-endothelial
marker. In birds, similar cells are present, and grafting of
quail dermatomes into chick embryos has demonstrated
the lymphangiogenic potential of this tissue [20]. Many of
the Lyve-1+ single cells in the mesenchyme express F4/80,
but only some are CD11b+. The F4/80 antibody recognises an extra-cellular membrane molecule, highly
restricted to mature macrophage subpopulations. The
antigen is not present on granulocytes, lymphocytes, mast
cells, platelets, endothelial cells and blood monocytes
[44]. CD11b is found on 'classical' macrophages such as

This receptor, called PVR, directs immune cell migration
[48,49,52]. The VEGF-PDGF-system is indispensable for
the development of vessels in vertebrates (ECs, pericytes,
smooth muscle cells), and it is tempting to speculate that
vascular wall cells are derived from macrophage-like cells
during phylogeny, and some LECs still do so during
ontogeny.

alveolar and peritoneal macrophages, but not on dendritic cells [45]. We detected a small number of Prox1Lyve-1-F4/80 triple-positive cells, which were obviously
integrated into the lining of lymph vessels. Although this
is a rare event, it demonstrates heterogeneity of LECs,
probably due to heterogeneity of lymphangiogenic mechanisms, which may be relevant not only during embryonic lymphangiogenesis, but also in phylogeny and
during pathological lymphangiogenesis.
Phylogenetic lymphangiogenesis
Development of LECs from macrophage-like progenitors
might reflect an ancestral mechanism. This assumption is
based on the observation that insects, which do not possess ECs [46], have macrophages that express ancestors of
typical angiogenesis-associated molecules of vertebrates
[47-49]. The tubular heart (also called dorsal vessel) of
insects is lined by contractile muscle cells, but not ECs
[46]. In Drosophila supply with oxygen is accomplished by
a tracheal system. Red blood cells are not present and the
so-called hemolymphatic system fulfils functions of a typical lymphatic system. It has, therefore, been speculated
that the lymphovascular system evolved before the blood
vascular system, although during ontogeny the latter
develops first [50]. Three types of immune cells are found
in Drosophila: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes
[51]. Plasmatocytes, which are capable of phagocytosis,
are comparable to the monocyte/macrophage lineage of
vertebrates. They possess a single ancestor for the VEGF
(Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) and PDGF (Platelet-derived Growth Factor) receptors found in vertebrates.

Pathological lymphangiogenesis
Lymphangiogenesis in embryos and adult organisms have
many mechanisms in common, but they may also differ
to some extent. Lymphangiogenesis in the adult takes
place in the proliferation phase of the endometrium [53].
Pathological lymphangiogenesis can be observed in
inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [54], in and around tumours that express the
lymphangiogenic growth factors VEGF-C and -D [55-57],
and during wound healing, where it occurs after blood
vessels have formed [58]. In these scenarios, new lymphatics are mostly formed from pre-existing ones, however, exceptions have been observed. One of these
exceptions is the healing of dermal wounds in the mouse
tail [59]. In this model, LECs do not sprout from lymph
vessels, but migrate as single cells from distal to proximal
parts of the tail and organize into vessels in the direction
of interstitial fluid flow. It is tempting to speculate that the
dermis of adult organisms still contains lymphendothelial
precursor cells, which is in line with our observation of
lymphangioblasts in the early dermatomes of murine and
avian embryos [2,19].

Macrophages may support pathological lymphangiogenesis in two ways: either by transdifferentiation and direct
incorporation into the endothelial layer or by stimulating
division of pre-existing local LECs [22,23,60]. Thereby,
VEGF-C seems to have a dual role as inducer of LEC proliferation and chemoattractant of macrophages [61]. In
diabetes, wound healing is impaired, due to decreased
numbers of macrophages (F4/80+, Lyve-1+, podoplanin+)
and lymph vessels [62]. A pool of macrophages expressing
VEGFR-3, CD45 and CD11b has been found in the conjunctiva of normal and inflamed murine eyes [63]. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether their
incorporation into lymph vessels is permanent or represents some kind of lymphendothelial mimicry [24].
Evidence for circulating cells with lymphendothelial characteristics has been found in human diseases. In patients
with gender-mismatched renal transplants and inflammation-associated transplant rejection, Kerjaschki et al. [25]
observed lymphangiogenesis with Ki-67 labelling rates of
2.3% of LECs, and incorporation of circulating recipientderived cells into kidney lymph vessels in the range of 2.7
– 7%. The Ki-67 labelling rates are clearly lower than
those we observed in embryonic LECs (in the mouse),

whereas the incorporation of circulating progenitor cells
into the lining of lymph vessels appears to be relatively
high in the adult human. The second disease, which
shows involvement of circulating lymphatic progenitor
cells, is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The cell of origin in KS has
long been a subject of debate. Mesenchymal cells, smooth

muscle cells, BECs, LECs, Schwann cells and fibroblasts
have been discussed. An endothelial origin has then been
favoured, but it has remained unclear whether these are
BECs or LECs [64,65]. Studies on the expression of lymphendothelial markers VEGFR-3, podoplanin and Lyve-1,
and studies showing the mitogenic effect of VEGF-C seem

Proliferation studies of Lyve-1+ cells with Ki-67 antibodies in ED 12.5 and ED 13.5 mice
Proliferation studies of Lyve-1+ cells with Ki-67 antibodies in ED 12.5 and ED 13.5 mice. For each ED, at least 5
sections of at least 3 mice were evaluated. The total number of cells counted was: 197 in lymph sacs (LS) on ED 12.5; 406 in
lymph sacs (LS) on ED 13.5; 45 in sprouts from lymph sacs (Sp) on ED 12.5; 75 in sprouts from lymph sacs (Sp) on ED 13.5; 43
in scattered cells in the dermatomes (D) on ED 12.5 and 40 in scattered cells in the dermatomes (D) on ED13.5. Mean and
standard deviation are shown. The value for D 12.5 is significantly higher than all others.

to prove that KS is derived from LECs [5]. However, examination of biopsies from KS skin lesions, which developed
after transplantation in immuno-suppressed recipients of
kidneys, showed that a high proportion of KS cells were of
donor (kidney) origin [6]. These findings suggest that KS
cells are derived from highly mobile cells. It is probable
that these are macrophage-like, which originated in the
donor organ. Cells with macrophage and endothelial
characteristics have been isolated from peripheral blood
of KS patients [66].

Conclusion
In summary, we describe mesenchymal cells with macrophage and lymphendothelial characteristics in murine
embryos. These cells seem to participate in normal lymphangiogenesis and might represent a relict of the phylogenetic development of lymph vessels from immune cells.
Similar cells may take part in pathological lymphangiogenesis in the mouse and in human beings, and may be
the cell of origin in Kaposi's sarcoma.

Methods
Animals
NMRI and C57BL/6 wild type mouse embryos from ED
10 to 13.5 were studied. Embryos were removed from the
uterus and remained either unfixed, or were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA), or in 100% ethanol containing
3% acetic acid. We did not observe any differences
between the two strains.
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse embryos were embedded in paraffin and sectioned
into 8 μm slices with a microtome (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and placed onto slides. Sections were stained with
rabbit-anti-mouse Lyve-1 antibodies (Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY). The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany). Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen.
Sections were counter stained with nuclear fast red.
Proliferation studies
Paraffin sections were stained with rabbit-anti-mouse
Lyve-1 antibodies [67,68] and Ki-67 (Dako, Hamburg,
Germany). The Ki-67-antigen was used with citrate buffer
in the microwave oven for antigen retrieval. The second-

ary antibodies, Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rat IgG,
and Alexa 594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, US), were applied at a dilution of
1:200, for 1 hour (h). Sections were counter-stained with
DAPI.

Immunofluorescence
Embryos of various developmental stages remained
unfixed or were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes. They were
rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), transferred to
5% and 15% sucrose in PBS, and embedded in Tissue
Freeze Medium (Sakura Finetek Europe, NL). Cryosections of 20 μm thickness were prepared. Non-specific
binding of antibodies was blocked by incubation with 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h before incubation
with the primary antisera. The following primary antibodies were used in this study for double and triple staining:
rabbit-anti-mouse LYVE-1 (Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY),
rat-anti-mouse CD31/PECAM-1 (1:50; BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, US), rabbit-anti-human Prox1 (1:750; ReliaTech, Braunschweig, Germany), rat-anti-mouse Ki-67
(1:50; Dako, Hamburg, Germany), rat-anti-mouse CD11b
(1:50; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, US), rat-anti-mouse
F4/80 (1:100; Hycult Biotechnology, Uden, Netherlands),
and rat-anti-mouse LA102 (pure supernatant, T. Ezaki,
Japan). The sections were incubated with the primary
antibodies for 1 h, except for Prox1, which was incubated
overnight. In the negative controls, the primary antibody
was omitted. Typical controls have been published [19].
After having been rinsed, the secondary Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rat IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goatanti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, US) were
applied at a dilution of 1:200. Alexa 350-conjugated goatanti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) was applied at 1:50 for
1 h. After having been rinsed, the sections were mounted
under cover slips with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, GB). They were then
viewed with the DM5000B epifluorescence microscope
(Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and Zeiss Axioplan 2 LSM
510 (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).
