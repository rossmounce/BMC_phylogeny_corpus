Lineage-specific late pleistocene expansion of an
endemic subtropical gossamer-wing damselfly,
Euphaea formosa, in Taiwan
Jen-Pan Huang1,2 and Chung-Ping Lin1*

Abstract
Background: Pleistocene glacial oscillations have significantly affected the historical population dynamics of
temperate taxa. However, the general effects of recent climatic changes on the evolutionary history and genetic
structure of extant subtropical species remain poorly understood. In the present study, phylogeographic and
historical demographic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences were used. The aim was to
investigate whether Pleistocene climatic cycles, paleo-drainages or mountain vicariance of Taiwan shaped the
evolutionary diversification of a subtropical gossamer-wing damselfly, Euphaea formosa.
Results: E. formosa populations originated in the middle Pleistocene period (0.3 Mya) and consisted of two
evolutionarily independent lineages. It is likely that they derived from the Pleistocene paleo-drainages of northern
and southern Minjiang, or alternatively by divergence within Taiwan. The ancestral North-central lineage colonized
northwestern Taiwan first and maintained a slowly growing population throughout much of the early to middle
Pleistocene period. The ancestral widespread lineage reached central-southern Taiwan and experienced a spatial and
demographic expansion into eastern Taiwan. This expansion began approximately 30,000 years ago in the Holocene
interglacial period. The ancestral southern expansion into eastern Taiwan indicates that the central mountain range
(CMR) formed a barrier to east-west expansion. However, E. formosa populations in the three major biogeographic
regions (East, South, and North-Central) exhibit no significant genetic partitions, suggesting that river drainages and
mountains did not form strong geographical barriers against gene flow among extant populations.
Conclusions: The present study implies that the antiquity of E. formosa’s colonization is associated with its high
dispersal ability and larval tolerance to the late Pleistocene dry grasslands. The effect of late Pleistocene climatic
changes on the subtropical damselfly’s historical demography is lineage-specific, depending predominantly on its
colonization history and geography. It is proposed that the Riss and Würm glaciations in the late Pleistocene period had
a greater impact on the evolutionary diversification of subtropical insular species than the last glacial maximum (LGM).

Background
Climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene period have significantly affected the population dynamics and genetic
structures of extant taxa. The effects of glacial expansions
and contractions on genetic characteristics and population demographics depend on the latitude, topography
and life history of the species in question [1,2]. Genetic
studies concerning temperate species in North America
and Europe reveal a widespread pattern of northern

expansion and southern refugia after the retreat of
continental ice sheets [3]. In contrast, the tropics and
sub-tropics had relatively stable climates during the Pleistocene period [4], which could have initiated different
responses to glacial cycles and allowed inhabitants to
generate genetic and demographic patterns distinct from
those of temperate species [1,2]. The general effects of
the Pleistocene ice ages on historical genetic structures of
tropical and subtropical species remain largely unknown.
However, several recent studies have demonstrated that
tropical and subtropical species exhibit greater genetic
diversity and limited post-glacial demographic expansion
than temperate species [5,6].

Taiwan is a subtropical island of approximately
36,000 km 2 located almost 100 km from the Asian
mainland (Figure 1). The island was created by the collision of the Philippine Sea plate and Eurasian plate
approximately 9 Mya [7], and uplifting processes thrust
the proto-Taiwan above sea level approximately 5 Mya
in the Pliocene [8]. Land bridges between Taiwan and
the adjacent Asian continent formed and submerged
intermittently during Pliocene and Pleistocene glacial
cycles owing to changes in sea levels [9,10], resulting in
Taiwan’s fauna and flora having periodic contact with
the Asian continent. Taiwan’s central mountain range
(CMR) reached its current altitude approximately 1 to
2 Mya, and currently includes more than 200 peaks
exceeding 3,000 m [7,8]. The CMR transects the island
from north to south, leaving a small portion of flat
plains along the southwest coast (Figure 1B). The topographic complexity and high altitude of the CMR provided opportunities for diversification in Taiwan’s
endemic organisms [11,12].
A phylogeographic study of Taiwanese terrestrial organisms including higher plants (oak, Cyclobalanopsis glauca
[13]; beech, Castanopsis carlesii [14]), vertebrates (bamboo
viper, Trimeresurus stejnegeri [15]; rice frog, Rana limnocharis [16]) and invertebrates (common cricket, Loxoblemmus appendicularis [17]) demonstrates that the CMR is
a prominent geographical barrier to species movement
and gene flow among populations. The lowland to midelevation species in Taiwan exhibit a general pattern of
eastern and western allopatric phylogroups separated by
the CMR. However, several high-elevation small mammals
including the mole-shrew (Anourosorex yamashinai) [18]
and wood mouse (Apodemus semotus) [19] display distinct
patterns of north-south phylogeographic sub-divisions.
These divisions suggest that high mountain ranges could
function as sky islands, providing interglacial refugia for
high-altitude species, but genetic studies investigating
strong dispersers demonstrate that the CMR is not an
effective geographic barrier for vagile organisms such as
the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) [20], montane
bird (Liocichla steerii) [21] and wood spider (Nephila
pilipes) [22], which generally exhibit high gene flow
among homogeneous populations.
The Pleistocene river drainage plays a central role in
shaping the biogeography and current genetic structures
of Taiwanese freshwater fauna. Endemic freshwater vertebrates fall into three major biogeographic regions, the
eastern, southern and north-central regions, reflecting
the paleo-drainages of Pleistocene land bridges [23]
(Figure 1A). Previous research concerning freshwater
organisms including minnows (Zacco pachycephalus)
[24], ray-finned fish (Varicorhinus barbatulus) [25] and
stream crabs (Candidiopotamon rathbunae) [26] reveals
substantial genetic differentiation among populations

that primarily correspond to these paleo-drainages.
Studies investigating low-elevation wetland fishes suggest that low genetic divergence among populations
[27] could result from seasonal flooding or periodic
connections to ancestral river drainages. Early studies
indicate that the genetic structure of freshwater fauna
with strict aquatic life histories is primarily the result of
interplay between vicariance caused by ancient river
drainages and the organism’s vagility. However, a phylogeographic study concerning the predominant and
diverse aquatic insects in Taiwan’s freshwater ecosystems have not been conducted.
Aquatic insects have a complex life history comprising
an aquatic immature stage constrained by freshwater habitats, and a winged adult stage with dispersal being limited
by terrestrial barriers and flying ability [28]. The dispersal
abilities of aquatic insects vary greatly among taxa and
according to age and sex, ranging from strong dispersers
such as dragonflies to less vagile mosquitoes [29]. Determining whether aquatic insects were affected by the same
isolating barriers that generated genetic structure in terrestrial and freshwater fauna is a prerequisite for understanding the relative impact of river drainage and mountain
vicariance in Taiwan. Euphaea formosa Hagen, 1869
(Insecta: Odonata), is a gossamer-wing damselfly species
endemic to Taiwan, found throughout the island in the
lowlands and fast flowing mountain streams at an altitude
of less lower than 1,500 meters. The dispersal ability of
adult E. formosa has not been estimated but observations
from mark-recapture studies suggest that adult dispersal
could be high (>10 km). Therefore, E. formosa is a suitable
freshwater insect candidate that should have developed
the same genetic signatures observed in more vagile
terrestrial species in Taiwan [20-22].
The present study uses DNA sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) and nuclear internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) to investigate the phylogeography
and demographic history of E. formosa. The aim was to
determine whether this endemic damselfly exhibits phylogeographic patterns and a genetic structure similar to terrestrial and freshwater fauna in Taiwan. Furthermore, the
historical demography and lineage divergence time of
E. formosa was investigated to determine the concordance
between the population history and major climatic cycles
during the Pleistocene period.

Results
Sequence variation

A total of 500 bp of mitochondrial COII sequences were
obtained from 159 individuals. The samples included 51
unique haplotypes in E. formosa and four in E. yayeyamana. The nuclear ITS sequence contained 681 bps
including 100 unique haplotypes in 125 E. formosa and
two in E. yayeyamana. The AT content was 71% for

COII but ITS demonstrated no bias towards A-T rich
sequences (46%). The pairwise sequence divergence of
COII ranged from 0 to 8.2% within E. formosa, and from
4.8 to 9.4% between E. formosa and E. yayeyamana. For
ITS, the pairwise sequence divergence ranged from 0 to
1.7% within E. formosa, and from 1.7 to 3.2% between
E. formosa and E. yayeyamana. A microsatellite locus
with GA repeats (0-8) appeared in the ITS1 region. The
estimated ω ratio of COII sequences (0.021 in M0) was
much less than one, and the LRT of M1 vs. M2 was
insignificant (c 2 = 0.046, p = 0.977, df = 2). These
results indicate that the M2 selection model did not fit
the data significantly better than the M1 neutral model.
Therefore, the neutral evolution of COII nucleotide sites
in Euphaea damselflies is possible.
Gene Trees and Species Phylogeny

The HKY+I+Γ (lnL = -2276) and TVMef+I (lnL = -3225)
models were selected as the best-fitting models concerning
sequence evolution of COII and ITS, respectively. The
COII phylogeny was well resolved with strong support at
the species level, suggesting a monophyletic E. formosa
with respect to sister E. yayeyamana (Figure 2A). This
phylogeny identified two distinct COII haplotype clades
(North-central & widespread) separated by a deep phylogenetic split. The North-central clade was restricted to
northern and central Taiwan, with the exception of two
derived southern haplotypes (H41 & H43), suggesting
recent long-range dispersal. This clade had a balanced tree
topology, suggesting a relatively large population that had
been stable for a long time period. In contrast, the widespread clade contained two high frequency haplotypes
(H01 & H17) that were widely distributed throughout the
island. The widespread clade had a star-like phylogeny,
indicating rapid population expansion. The ITS tree suggested a monophyletic E. formosa sister to E. yayeyamana
(Figure 2B). This tree presented with a shallow topology
and revealed no apparent population sub-structuring
within E. formosa. The species tree estimated with
*BEAST recovered E. formosa as a reciprocally monophyletic group, with E. yayeyamana being a sister species
(Figure 1C). Within E. formosa, the haplotypes were
grouped into the North-central and widespread clades, but
the relationships among the sampled populations within
these two clades were not resolved. This indicates a high
number of shared haplotypes among the populations of
both North-central and widespread clades.

with the highest COII nucleotide diversities, representing
ancestral sources of extant E. formosa, were present in
five major river systems in northern and central Taiwan
(TSKL, 0.026; TC, 0.028; TDtk, 0.023; CSlhc, 0.023; FG,
0.026). These populations corresponded to the two proposed paleo-drainage systems of Taiwan, with the exception of the southern population from the Fongkang river
(FG) (Figure 1A). However, the populations from eastern
Taiwan (site 21 to 31) and the three river systems of the
proposed paleo-drainage in the southwestern plains (PJ,
TW & KP), exhibited low COII nucleotide diversities
(0.001-0.008), indicating recent origins or population bottlenecks. The relatively high h (0.657) and low π (0.003)
values within the widespread COII clade suggested rapid
population growth from a small ancestral population
(Table 1). The North-central COII clade, which had high
values for h (0.996) and π (0.021), indicated a stable
population with a long-term, large population size or
admixed populations from separated ancestral lineages.
However, ITS exhibited high haplotype diversities and
low nucleotide diversities in all populations, suggesting
population expansion. Population differentiation (FST)
was higher in the North-central clade than the widespread COII clade (Table 1). The number of individuals
estimated to be long-term effective migrants (Nm) in the
widespread COII clade was greater than that of the
North-central COII clade and ITS estimation. Tajima’s D
of the widespread COII clade and ITS were negative and
significantly different to zero, suggesting past population
expansions. Tajima’s D of the North-central COII clade
was positive, but not significantly different to zero. Fu’s
F S calculated for the widespread, North-central COII
clade and ITS were negative and significantly different
from zero, implying past population growth. The
AMOVA of COII indicated non-significant (8% of molecular variance) genetic differentiation between east and
west groups and among east, south, and North-central
groups (Table 2). Significant population differentiation
(P < 0.0001) was evident among populations within
groups (24-26%) and within populations (67%). The
majority of ITS variance was evident within populations
(97%). No significant correlation was detected between
pairwise genetic and geographic distances of the widespread COII clade (r = -0.078, P = 0.923), whereas significantly positive correlations between pairwise genetic and
geographic were present in the North-central COII clade
and ITS (r = 0.637 and 0.103, P = 0.073 and 0.061,
respectively).

Population genetics

The haplotype diversities (h) of COII ranged from 0 to 1,
and the haplotype diversities of ITS ranged from 0.75 to
1 (Additional file 1). The nucleotide diversities (π) of
these two gene regions varied between 0 and 0.028 for
COII, and between 0.002 and 0.009 for ITS. Populations

Demographic history and coalescence time

The North-central COII clade exhibited a multimodal
mismatch distribution, indicating a relatively stable
population throughout time. This finding differs significantly from the simulation of sudden expansion and

0.314 and 0.268; r = 0.0197 and 0.0197, P = 0.199 and
0.197) (Figure 3A). The widespread COII clade exhibited
a smooth unimodal distribution, suggesting past population expansions (Figure 3B). However, this mismatch
distribution did not converge with the expected sudden
demographic and spatial expansion models using the
least square procedure. The EBSP of the North-central
COII clade revealed a slowly growing curve (Figure 3C).

These results suggest these were relatively stable populations during the past 1.5 million years, with an approximate two fold increase in population sizes from 4.82 to
8.90, beginning approximately 0.6 Mya and during the
late Pleistocene glacial cycles (EBSP 95% HPD of Neτ =
0.66-8.66 and 4.62-13.53, respectively) (Figure 3C). For
the widespread COII clade, the EBSP with 95% HPD
demonstrated that the population underwent population
growth approximately 0.03 Mya, towards the end of

of Neτ = 0.01-4.84) (Figure 3D). During the interglacial
Holocene period, the populations increased more than
two-fold, reaching a size of 4.84 (EBSP 95% HPD of
N e τ = 1.08-9.02). The estimated T mrca for E. formosa
and sister species E. yayeyamana was approximately
2.6 Mya in the late Pliocene (mean = 2.586, 95% CI =
0.483-6.216, ESS = 1298). The Tmrca for the origin of
E. formosa was approximately 0.3 Mya in the middle
Pleistocene period (mean = 0.319, 95% CI = 0.127-1.752,
ESS = 1086).

Discussion
Evolutionary history of Euphaea formosa

This study provides the first phylogeographic analysis of
endemic freshwater insects in Taiwan. The phylogenetic
results suggest that the common ancestors of E. formosa
and its sister species E. yayeyamana of the southern
Ryukyu Archipelago, began diverging approximately
2.6 Mya during the late Pliocene (Figure 1C), approximately 2.5 Mya after the emergence of Taiwan above
sea level (4-5 Mya [8]). During the Pleistocene glaciations, the continental shelf under the East China Sea
emerged and provided land bridge connections between
the southern Ryukyus Archipelago and the Asian

continent [9,10]. These land bridge connections allowed
ancestral Euphaea lineages from the Asian mainland to
disperse and colonize Taiwan, Ishigaki and Iriomote
Island. The subsequent vicariant isolation and divergence between Taiwan and the southern Ryukyu Archipelago is likely to have initiated diversification between
these two insular species during the Pleistocene glacial
cycles. In addition to vicariant isolation, ecological adaptation to the greater availability of larval prey in Taiwan
compared with the Ishigaki and Iriomote islands is
another probable factor contributing to the larger body
size of E. formosa compared with E. yayeyamana [30].
With the exception of size, no morphological characteristics distinguish between these two damselflies, and the
molecular phylogenies in this study clearly demonstrate
that E. formosa and E. yayeyamana are monophyletic
sister species with average genetic distances of 8%
(COII) and 2.5% (ITS). Therefore, these two insular gossamer-wings are distinctive “genetic” and “phylogenetic”
species [31].
The mitochondrial COII and nuclear ITS gene trees for
E. formosa were not fully congruent. In addition to
incongruence associated with the gene tree/species tree,
the results suggested a possible introgression or incomplete sorting of lineages in the ancestral polymorphism of
these two markers. The jointly estimated coalescence

Figure 3 Mismatch distributions and Bayesian demographic analyses of E. formosa COII sequence data. (A) The North-central clade has a
multimodal distribution that differs from sudden demographic and spatial expansion models. (B) The widespread clade exhibits a distinct
unimodal distribution. (C) The EBSP of the North-central clade demonstrates relatively stationary populations between 0.6 and 2 Mys, with a
demographic expansion over much of the Pleistocene glacial cycles. (D) The EBSP of the widespread clade indicates a population growth
beginning near the end of the glacial Würm period (0.03 Mya) and into the Holocene interglacial period.

time for COII and ITS suggests that the extant E. formosa
populations probably originated approximately 0.3 Mya,
during the middle Pleistocene period. The existence of a
deep phylogenetic split and substantial genetic differentiation between the North-central and widespread COII
clades, together with the monophyly of haplotypes from
these two lineages, imply that there were at least two periods of colonization on the island. Alternatively, there
was a single colonization followed by divergence of the
two clades within Taiwan (Figure 1&2). These two evolutionary scenarios are equally plausible for the origin of
extant E. formosa, where the ancestral E. formosa colonized northwestern Taiwan via the emerging land bridges
and rivers connecting it to the Asian continent as a result
of lowered sea levels during repeated glacial periods
approximately 0.3 Mya during the middle Pleistocene
period [9,10].

Previous estimates of colonizing periods for Taiwanese
freshwater fishes are less than one Mya, falling within the
time frame of the middle to late Pleistocene. These estimates include minnows (0.06 Mya [24]), cyprinid fish
(0.11-0.39 & 0.1-1 Mya [32,33]) and goby (0.87 Mya
[34]), but the colonizing period for spiny loach is estimated to be the middle to late Pliocene period (2.22-2.75
& 3.41-4.23 Mya [35]). In contrast, several studies concerning Taiwanese lowland terrestrial animals estimate
the colonization periods to be greater than two Mya,
ranging from the Pliocene to early Pleistocene periods
(bamboo viper, 2-3 Mya [15]; lizard, 5-8 Mya [36]; crab,
5-7 Mya [26]; common cricket, 1.8 Mya [17]). Assuming
an average mitochondrial COII clock for the insects
(1.15% divergence/lineage/myrs [37]) and a scaled ITS
clock, the estimate based on the current study is that
ancestral E. formosa first colonized the island during the

Huang and Lin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/94

early to middle Pleistocene period (0.13-1.8 Mya), preceding the colonizing periods for the majority of Taiwanese freshwater fish, which have low migratory
capabilities limited by availability of continuous aquatic
habitats. Therefore, E. formosa, a vagile aquatic insect
present in lowland rivers and streams, exhibits an ancient
colonization history older than most freshwater vertebrates but younger than lowland terrestrial animals.
In addition to the apparently higher dispersal ability
assisted by winged adults, an explanation for the antiquity of E. formosa’s colonization could be the past climate and vegetations in the continental land bridges
during the Pleistocene glaciations. Paleo-environmental
and palynological studies suggest that the climate of
exposed land bridges connecting the Asian continent to
lowland Taiwan during extended glaciations were cooler
and dryer than at present, and the vegetation zones in
these continental land bridges were predominantly grasslands [38,39]. Dry grassland habitats with limited river
systems and frequently interrupted water supplies caused
by weaker monsoons acted as migratory barriers for
freshwater fish, but were relatively weak barriers for
Euphaea damselflies, particularly at the larval stage.
Euphaea formosa are damselflies of the only two odonate
families known to possess lateral abdominal gill appendages in addition to the usual three caudal gills (the
Oriental-Palearctic Euphaeidae & Neotropical Polythoridae [40]). Lateral abdominal gills were considered an
adaptation to riverine habitats subject to intermittent
oxygen deficiency [40], which would allow heavy sclerotized larvae to take refuge in the hyporheal zone where
oxygen concentration is low during dry seasons [41,42].
The ability of E. formosa larvae to survive in periodically
dry streambeds, which probably characterized the river
systems of the Pleistocene dry grasslands, could facilitate
an early colonizing history into the lowlands of Taiwan
compared with other freshwater fish.
Phylogeography and lineage-specific population
expansion

The AMOVA indicated no significant genetic differentiation in mitochondrial COII or nuclear ITS between east
and west groups or among east, south and North-central
groups (Table 2). Therefore, it is unlikely that river drainages or the CMR constituted a strong physical barrier to
current gene flow among populations. However, substantial genetic differentiation appears among populations
within regions. These results suggest that E. formosa populations are not panmictic, and that current gene flow
among populations is likely to be restricted by geographic
distances. Nevertheless, Pleistocene river drainages and
the CMR played major roles in shaping the colonization
and diversification history of E. formosa. Genetic analyses
suggested that extant E. formosa populations could be

derived from two independent ancestral source lineages
due to past allopatric fragmentation, which reflected the
Pleistocene river drainages of continental land bridges. In
this scenario, the North-central clade (north of Choshui
River) likely derived from the paleo-drainages of northern
Minjiang and adjacent northwestern Taiwan first colonized northern Taiwan early during the Pleistocene period
(Figure 1&2). Later, the ancestral widespread clade, which
originated from the paleo-drainages of southern Minjiang,
reached central-southern Taiwan in the middle of the
Pleistocene period. These interpretations have been supported by the findings that E. formosa populations with
the highest genetic diversity were distributed between five
major river systems corresponding to these paleo-drainages [9,23] (Additional file 1). An alternative scenario
concerning postglacial re-colonization from two previously
isolated refugia is equally likely to generate the genetic
divergence between the North-central and widespread
clades. The land bridges connecting the Asian continent
with the island of Taiwan have been proposed as glacial
refugia for lowland freshwater species such as endemic
minnows and cyprinid fish [9,24,33]. The average temperature during the Pleistocene glaciations in East Asia was at
least 5°C lower than at present [38,39]. Therefore, during
the glacial maxima the distribution of E. formosa would
have been restricted to the edge of the island and the
exposed continental land bridges. The paleo-drainages of
northwestern Taiwan and southern Minjiang could have
acted as isolated glacial refugia for ancestral E. formosa
populations. As a warmer climate and more favorable
habitats appeared during the Pleistocene inter-glaciations,
E. formosa repopulated the lowlands of western Taiwan
from the two refugia.
The phylogeographic and historical demographic analysis carried out in this study indicated that the effect of
Pleistocene climatic changes on the population dynamics
of E. formosa were lineage-specific and depended predominantly on the colonization history and geography of the
two evolutionarily independent clades. The haplotype
diversity of COII was higher in northwestern populations
than populations in the south, with the most eastern
Taiwan populations having only the widespread haplotypes H01 and H17. This pattern of haplotype distribution
indicates that the founders of the eastern populations originated from western Taiwan and moved to southern
regions of the island. This southern dispersal route into
eastern Taiwan is evident in an endemic cyprinid fish [33]
and the common cricket [17]. In addition to the historical
range expansion, this study provides clear evidence that
the widespread clade experienced a demographic expansion approximately 0.03 Mya during the late Pleistocene
period. The onset of this demographic expansion was
associated with the Holocene interglacial period, when the
warmer climate and available lowland streams on the

Huang and Lin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/94

eastern side of the CMR could have permitted the damselfly to colonize and expand into eastern Taiwan. In contrast, the North-central clade maintained a slowly growing
population size throughout much of the early and middle
Pleistocene periods, possibly because of the stable aquatic
habitats of northern Taiwan. Northern Taiwan experiences northeast monsoons during the winter (dry seasons)
and has much higher precipitation than central and southwestern Taiwan [43], and the water levels of these northern rivers and streams are stable throughout the year and
are capable of sustaining constant population sizes and
maintaining high genetic diversity. In contrast, the widespread clade of the central and southern rivers experienced more frequent seasonal droughts during winterspring dry seasons, and consequently generated smaller
population sizes and decreased genetic diversity due to
genetic drift in fluctuating populations. The rivers and
streams in eastern Taiwan are much shorter than those of
western Taiwan owing to the steep slopes of the eastern
CMR. Therefore, they support smaller populations with
lower genetic diversity.
The historical demography of extant species was affected
by climatic cycles during the Pleistocene period [2,3]. Phylogeographic studies concerning European and North
American fauna suggest that the last glacial maximum
(LGM, approximately 0.018 Mya) was a major climatic
event structuring the historical population dynamics of
temperate taxa [2,3]. After the retreat of the LGM, temperate species frequently expanded from southern refugia
into previously glaciated northern ranges. However, the
findings of this study indicate that the onset of demographic expansion in subtropical E. formosa predated the
LGM period, occurring during the middle or late Pleistocene period (0.03 and 0.6 Mya). Recent research investigating an endemic babbler in East Asia suggests a similar
late Pleistocene population growth (0.17 Mya), after
release from separated glacial refugia around southeast
China [44]. E. formosa demonstrates a less drastic demographic expansion trend in terms of magnitude of population growth than many temperate taxa [1-3]. Therefore, a
post-LGM population expansion model that characterizes
several temperate species cannot describe the Pleistocene
population dynamics of subtropical lowland taxa such as
E. formosa. These results imply that earlier glacial periods
such as Riss and Würm during the late Pleistocene period
could have had greater impact on the historical demography and levels of genetic diversity in subtropical and tropical species than previously thought. Tropical species are
often phylogeographically older than their temperate
counterparts, and are likely to experience earlier climatic
oscillations in the Pleistocene period [5]. A relatively mild,
late Pleistocene climate in subtropical East Asia [4] and
available glacial refugia in continental land bridges [9]
could have alleviated demographic stresses during the

Page 9 of 13

Pleistocene glaciations, which in turn generated relatively
modest population fluctuations in E. formosa.

Conclusions
This study has investigated Pleistocene climatic, geographic
and natural history factors underlying the evolutionary
diversification of an aquatic insect in Taiwan. The endemic
gossamer-wing damselfly originated during the early to
middle Pleistocene period, earlier than the late Pleistocene
colonization of the majority of Taiwanese freshwater vertebrates. The antiquity and colonization history of E. formosa
could be due to the flying ability of the adult and larval
tolerance to the periodically dry grassland habitats
that characterized Pleistocene land bridges. The extant
E. formosa population consists of two phylogenetically
independent lineages that either originated from the Pleistocene river drainages of northern and southern Minjiang
or re-colonized from two separated refugia. Each lineage
has undergone divergent evolutionary trajectories within
the island. The present findings revealed the spatial and
demographic expansion of the widespread lineage that can
be dated to the late Pleistocene period (approximately
30,000 years ago). This population expansion was probably
due to the availability of habitats in eastern Taiwan during
the warmer Holocene interglacial period. In contrast, the
North-central lineage has maintained a relatively stable
population during the past one and half million years,
possibly because of the stable aquatic habitats of northern
Taiwan. The ancestral E. formosa expanded into eastern
Taiwan via a southern dispersal route, indicating that the
CMR formed a barrier to the east-west dispersal of this
damselfly. However, the CMR and Pleistocene river drainages are not strong geographic barriers to current gene
flow among E. formosa populations, with genetic structures
being shaped by geographic distances within the three biogeographic regions. This study led to the proposal that the
Riss and Würm glaciations in the late Pleistocene period
had a greater impact on the evolutionary diversification of
subtropical insular species than the LGM. Further studies
investigating taxa with diverse life history characteristics
could elucidate the general effect of recent climatic oscillations on the evolutionary diversification of subtropical
species.
Methods
Biology of E. formosa and sampling

Male E. formosa damselflies are characterized by black
bands on the hind wings and distinct red stripes on the
thorax (Figure 1). Adults occur on the wing from April to
November, with a population peak between June and
August. They appear near streams with rapid water flow
and an open canopy. Mature males with established territories usually perch on rocks or plants, and exhibit aggressive territorial behavior towards intruding con-specific

Huang and Lin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/94

males. Females appear periodically inside these territories
and mate with territory owners.
One hundred and fifty nine E. formosa individuals from
32 sites, representing 27 major rivers and streams
throughout Taiwan, were sampled (Figure 1B, Additional
file 1). Voucher specimens were preserved in 95% ethanol
and stored at -80°C in Tunghai University. For outgroups, five Euphaea species from Southeast Asia including E. decorata, E. impar, E. refulgens, E. subcostalis, and
E. yayeyamana, which are endemic to the Ishigaki and
Iriomote Islands of the Ryukyu Archipelago situated
200 km east of Taiwan, were used. The ITS sequence of
E. impar was obtained from GenBank (AJ746322). An
earlier study comparing external morphological characters of E. formosa and E. yayeyamana demonstrated no
distinct differentiation, except that E. yayeyamana is
smaller (insular dwarfism) [30]. This suggests a close
phylogenetic relationship between these two species. To
determine the taxonomic status and the degree of genetic
differentiation between these Euphaea species, six
E. yayeyamana individuals were used for the analyses.
DNA extraction, sequencing, and alignment

DNA was extracted from insect thoracic muscle using
the standard CTAB, pheno-chloroform protocol, followed by ethanol precipitation [45]. The primers C2-J3102 [46] and Euphaea-specific C2-N-3740 (5’-TCA
TCT AGT GAG GCT TCA-3’) were used to amplify the
COII gene. A eukaryote-specific 18SF/28SR primer set
was used to amplify ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S genes [47].
PCR reactions were performed in an Ependorf thermocycler (Mastercycler Gradient, Hamburg, Germany).
PCR reactions contained a total volume of 50 μl, composed of 1 μl of ProTaq polymerase (2 u/μl, Protech
Technology, Taiwan), 2 μl of 10 mM of each primer,
4 μl of 1 mM dNTPs, 5 μl of ProTaq buffer, 35 μl of
ddH2O and 1 μl of extracted DNA (100 to 400 ng/μl).
For COII, the PCR profile was as follows: denaturing at
94°C for one minute, 35 cycles of amplification at 94°C
for one minute followed by 53°C for one minute and
72°C for one minute, and a final extension at 72°C for
10 minutes. For ITS, the PCR profile was the same as
that for COII except the annealing temperature was
52°C. PCR products were purified using a Gel/PCR
DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid, Taipei,
Taiwan) and cloned into competent cells (dH-5a) using
the T&A cloning kit (RBC, Taipei, Taiwan). Positive clones
were confirmed by performing PCR reactions using M13F/
M13R primers. Plasmid DNA was sequenced in both
directions on an ABI PRISM™ 377 automatic sequencer
(Perkin Elmer, USA) at the Mission Biotech, Taiwan.
Manually inspected and edited DNA sequences from raw
chromatograph data were aligned using the Clustal W
method in MegAlign (DNAStar package, Madison, USA).

COII sequences were translated into amino acid sequences
using a mitochondrial genetic code of Drosophila in
MacClade v.4.06 [48] to check for possible stop codons
caused by ambiguous sequencing. Thirteen paralogous
ITS2 sequences with large indels (20 to 58 bps) were
excluded from the analyses. Sequences used in this study
were deposited in GenBank (EU603519-EU603681). The
sequence alignment and associated phylogenetic trees
were submitted to the TreeBASE http://purl.org/phylo/
treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11020.
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Maximum
Parsimony (MP) in PAUP* v.4.0b10 [49]. Parsimony
branch supports were calculated using bootstrapping of
1,000 replicates of tree bisection and reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping, with 10 replications of random sequence
addition. For Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses, the best-fitting model of nucleotide
substitution was selected in MODELTEST v.3.7 [50] using
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). ML branch supports were calculated with 100 bootstrap replications in
the PhyML 3.0 web sever [51]. Bayesian analyses were carried out using MrBayes v.3.1.2 [52], with prior settings and
the parameters of nucleotide substitution models being
estimated using MODELTEST. Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) were calculated separately for each gene
partition. Two separate Bayesian runs, each with four
Markov chains, were performed simultaneously. The
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) searches were run
for 1 × 107 and 6 × 10 6 generations for COII and ITS,
respectively, with trees being sampled for every 100 generations. MCMC runs were terminated after the average
split frequencies went below 0.01 and the Convergence
Diagnostic Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF)
approached one, suggesting convergence of the two separate runs [53]. One quarter of the sampled trees (25,000
and 15,000 for COII and ITS respectively) were discarded
as burn-in. The remaining trees were imported into
PAUP* for constructing a 50% majority consensus tree.
A species tree was co-estimated from COII and ITS gene
trees using *BEAST [54] implemented in BEAST v.1.6.1
[55]. The substitution model, clock model and tree model
of the two genes were set as unlinked. The mutation rate
of COII was set to the average value found in arthropods
(1.15% divergence/lineage/myrs [37]), and the mutation
rate of ITS (0.49%, 95% PD = 0.00248-0.00727, ESS = 362)
was estimated relative to COII. The relaxed local clock
model was used, with estimated rate change counts of 2.0
and 1.3 for COII (95% PD = 1-4, ESS = 1200) and ITS
(95% PD = 0-3, ESS = 4743), respectively. The species tree
prior was set to the default option of Yule process. The
MCMC analyses were run for 5 × 108 generations, with
parameters sampled for every 1 × 104 generations and the

Huang and Lin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/94

first 10% of the runs being discarded as burn-in. The convergence of runs was determined by examining likelihood
scores through time plot using TRACER v. 1.5 [55].
Neutrality and population genetic analyses

A codeml module of PAML (v. 4, [56]) was used to
detect the signature of natural selection at COII. The
non-synonymous versus synonymous substitution ratio
(ω: dN/dS) was calculated under model M0 (no site rate
heterogeneity) with likelihood tree topologies obtained
from the phylogenetic analyses. The Likelihood Ratio
Test (LRT) was used to detect the significance between
model M1 (nearly neutral) and model M2 (selection)
using chi-square statistics. Haplotype diversity (h),
nuclear diversity (π), exact tests of population differentiation, pairwise and overall F ST among populations
were calculated using DnaSP v.4.0 [57]. Mantel tests
were used to examine the association between the
genetic (FST) and geographic distance (km) of populations using 10,000 permutations and a Reduced Major
Axis (RMA) regression in IBD [58]. The population
genetic structures were tested with the Analysis of
Molecular Variance (AMOVA) with 1,000 permutations
in ARLEQUIN v.3.01 [59]. Populations were assigned to
two (east or west) and three groups (east, south, or
north-central) to test for restricted gene flow among
biogeographic regions identified in earlier studies. Three
hierarchical levels of genetic variance including within
populations (F ST ), among populations within groups
(FSG) and among groups (FGT) were calculated. Tajima’s D and Fu’s FS were computed using ARLEQUIN
with 1,000 permutations. Positive values of Tajima’s D
and Fu’s FS indicated possible balancing selection (single
locus) or population subdivision (multiple loci), whereas
negative values suggested positive selection (single
locus) or expansion of population size (multiple loci).
Demographic history and divergence time

The demographic history was inferred from nonrecombined COII haplotypes using a mismatch distribution analysis with 1,000 bootstrap replications in
ARLEQUIN. The analyses were carried out separately
for the North-central and widespread clades of COII
because of a deep phylogenetic gap between these two
lineages (see phylogeny result below). The goodness of
fit between observed data and expected demographic
models was estimated using the Sum of Square Deviations (SSD). The Harpending’s Raggedness index (r)
was calculated with 1,000 permutations to test the significance of r between the observed and simulated distributions. A Bayesian coalescence-based framework
[60] was employed to infer the demographic history
and lineage divergence time in E. formosa on the basis
of both loci. We computed the posterior distributions

Page 11 of 13

of effective population sizes (N e τ), time to the most
recent common ancestor (T mrca ) and the multi-locus
Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot (EBSP) [61] using a linear model implemented in BEAST v.1.6.1 [55]. COII
and ITS were set as unlinked while assuming the same
demographic history. The mutation rate setting was
the same as in the above *BEAST analyses. The starting
population size was set to one, and the scale factor k
was set to two. Both gene trees were reconstructed
using an uncorrelated relaxed lognormal clock model.
The window size for COII and ITS random walk integer
was set to two and eight, respectively. The MCMC
searches were run for 1 × 10 8 generations with parameters sampled for every 1 × 10 4 generations and the
first 10% of the runs being discarded as burn-in. Each
analysis was repeated several times to optimize the scale
factors until there were no suggesting messages in the
log file. The Effective Sample Size (ESS) of estimated
parameter values was determined using Tracer v. 1.5
[55], and the EBSPs were visualized using R (v. 2.12.0;
http://www.r-project.org/).
