Abstract
Papillomaviruses (PVs) are associated with the development of neoplasias and have been found in several different
species, most of them in humans and other mammals. We identified, cloned and sequenced PV DNA from
pigmented papilloma-like lesions of a diamond python (Morelia spilota spilota). This represents the first complete
PV genome discovered in a Squamata host (MsPV1). It consists of 7048 nt and contains the characteristic open
reading (ORF) frames E6, E7, E1, E2, L1 and L2. The L1 ORF sequence showed the highest percentage of sequence
identities to human PV5 (57.9%) and Caribbean manatee (Trichechus manatus) PV1 (55.4%), thus, establishing a new
clade. According to phylogenetic analysis, the MsPV1 genome clusters with PVs of mammalian rather than
sauropsid hosts.
The members of the family Papillomaviridae are nonenveloped, icosahedral viral particles with a diameter of
50 to 55 nm and a small (~8 kbp), circular, double
stranded DNA genome, which is transcribed into one
single direction [1]. The family may be divided into at
least 29 genera with a vast number of species, types,
subtypes, and variants of papillomaviruses (PVs), based
on nucleotide identities of the L1 open reading frames
(ORFs) [2]. Due to the high genetic diversity and the
host range it is anticipated, that the family Papillomaviridae has a long evolutionary history, but details remain
yet vague.
DNA of PVs can be detected in a wide range of vertebrate species, thus far including humans, various other
mammals, birds, and turtles (additional file 1). PVs have
been found to play a role in several human diseases of
the skin and mucous membranes. The DNA of PVs can
be amplified from samples of clinical asymptomatic individuals, but more importantly their influence on the
development of certain benign and malignant disorders
was demonstrated repeatedly [3,4].
The sequences of three PVs from birds, namely the
Chaffinch (Fringgilla coelebs), the Yellownecked Francolin (Francolinus leucoscepus) and the Timneh African
gray parrot (Psittacus erithacus timneh), have been

determined [5-7]. Various data suggest the existence of
sauropsid-specific PVs in association with papillomas in
lizards, snakes, crocodiles and turtles [8-11]. Sequences
of the entire genome from two PVs of turtles were
determined recently from the Loggerhead turtle (Caretta
caretta) and the Green seaturtle (Chelonia mydas) [12].
Upon phylogenetic analysis, these five sauropsid PVs
cluster together and appear clearly distinct from the
PVs infecting mammalian species.
Here, we report on the cloning, sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis of a PV-specific DNA
from the Australian diamond python (Morelia spilota
spilota).
Samples from a diamond python with small black
papillated and pedunculated exophytic skin proliferations were taken and stored at -20°C until processing.
Total DNA from a 25 mg tissue sample was isolated
using a QIAamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. One microliter
of the extracted DNA was used for RCA [13], using a
TempliPhi Amplification kit (General Electrics Biosciences). Slight modifications were applied to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer: 1 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs was added and the reaction time was prolonged
to 16 h at 30°C. Amplified DNA was cloned into the
EcoRI or XhoI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene)
using standard procedures.
The nucleotide sequence of cloned DNA and of precipitated RCA product was determined (Microsynth) on

for the E1, E2, L2 and L1 proteins from those fifty papillomaviruses including MsPV1 and the 5 previously published sauropsoid PVs were aligned on the amino acid
level by using the Perl script transAlign.pl [14]. This
script translates the nucleotide sequences to amino acid
sequences and passes them to ClustalW [15]; (version
2.0.10, Gonnet matrix, default settings) before back-translate to DNA sequences. The four sets of aligned nucleotide sequences representing the four sets of protein
sequences were combined to a single multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) by concatenating the sequences from
each virus. The resulting single MSA, 8709 nucleotide
positions in length, was then shortened to 5100 nucleotide positions by using GBlock (version 0.91b; half gap

positions allowed [16]). The optimal model of DNA evolution was evaluated for best fit of the data set using
ModelTest (version 1.4.4; default settings [17]). Bayesian
phylogeny was inferred using MrBayes (version 3.2; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with GTR substitution
matrix, variable gamma rates, invariant sites, two runs
four chains of 1’000’000 generations), and displayed with
FigTree (1.3.0) [18]. The MCMC was sampled every
1’000 cycles. Stationarity was reached after less than
10’000 cycles according to Tracer analysis [18]. The tree
was midpoint rooted. Pairwise alignments were made in
Needle (Emboss) using the ednafull matrix with a gap
penalty of 10.0 and a extend penalty of 0.1. The nucleotide sequence data of the PV was deposited in GenBank
under accession no. HQ262535.
Analyses of the cloned sequence confirmed that papillomavirus DNA had actually been detected. The amplified genome consists of 7048 bp and has a GC content of
41%. ORFs putatively encoding E6, E7, E1, E2, E4, L2 and
L1 but no E5 were identified (Figure 1). Deduced amino
acid sequences of the putative proteins revealed a degenerate ATP-dependent helicase motif GQPNTGKS in E1,
two putative metal-binding motifs (CX2CX29CX2C) in E6,
one such motif in E7, and one pRb binding domain
(LXCXE) [19,20]). The deduced amino acid sequences of
both structural proteins L1 and L2 are predicted to harbour a basic tail at their C termini.
A non coding region (NCR1) between the stop-codon
of the L1 ORF and the start-codon of the E6 ORF was
473 nt in length. A second non coding region (NCR2)
of 178 nt was between the stop-codon of the E2 and the
start-codon of the L2 ORF.
In addition, papillomavirus-specific DNA motifs were
identified in the readily determined genome sequence.
Four putative consensus sequences for E2 binding
(ACCN 5-7 GGT) were detected; two of these were
located in the NCR1 (positions 6919-6931 and 32-43)
and two were located within the predicted L1 ORF
(positions 5936-5948 and 5990-6000). Within the NCR1,
a putative origin of DNA replication was identified, consisting of two E2-binding regions flanking a region with
54% A/T content. Two polyadenylation consensus
sequences (AATAAA) were predicted, one within the
NCR1 (position 6729-6734) and the other within the
NCR2 (position 3816-3821).
In order to possibly allocate the novel PV in the evolutionary context, phylogeny based on the aligned E1E2-L2-L1 sequences was determined. Sequences of fifty
PVs, representing all presently classified genera and
MsPV1 were included in these analyses (Figure 2).
While all other sauropsid PVs clustered together,
MsPV1 was located far from any of them. Interestingly,
MsPV1 was found in relative proximity to the PV
(TmPV1) of a marine mammal, the manatee (sea cow).

Furthermore, Needle alignments which reflect global
alignments of the entire genes in contrast to the alignment used for the tree were made. Upon these pairwise
alignments on the nucleotide level of the L1 ORF the
highest percentage of sequence identities was found
with a human PV (HPV5; 57.9%) and with TmPV1 on
the E1 ORF (55.6%) (Table 1). Consequently MsPV1
may be regarded as rather a close to the root prototype
of a new PV clade that might establish a new genus
regarding to the guidelines of PV classification [2,21].
While many PVs have been described in humans and
other mammalian species, the number of known PVs
infecting non-mammalian species is limited (additional file
1). The described MsPV1 genome represents the first PV
isolated from a snake. It contains the characteristic ORFs
E6, E7, E1, E2, L1 and L2, a large non-coding region
between L1 and E6 as well as a small non-coding region
between E2 and L2. The size of the viral genome (7048 bp)
is comparable with the two turtle PV genomes (CcPV1;
7020 bp and CmPV1; 6953 bp), which are all relatively
small. However, while the latter two viruses have short versions of E1, E2, L2 and E6 ORFs as well as the NCR, the
small size of MsPV1 is primarily due to comparably short
E2 and L2 ORFs and also comparably short NCRs.
The genomic sequences of the PVs from three bird
and two turtle species have previously been published
[5-7,12]. According to our and other’s phylogenetic analysis, they cluster together. However, our newly discovered PV genome isolated from the snake did not at all
cluster with the five other sauropsid PVs (CcPV1,
CmPV1, FcPV1, FlPV1 and PePV1). Upon pairwise
alignment of individual ORFs, MsPV1 shares much
higher percentage of sequence identities with mammalian PVs than with any of the known sauropsid PVs
(Table 1). This finding raises interesting questions in the
context of PV evolution. While co-evolution with the
host has been suggested and demonstrated to play a
role in PV evolution [5,22,23] it has also been shown
that PV evolution is probably a complex matter and
other mechanism such as crossing of species barriers

and adaptive radiation have to be considered as well
[24-26].
Turtles as putative representatives of the Anapsida
and snakes as representatives of the Diapsida are phylogenetically distinct with a common ancestor dating back
more than 200 million years [27]. However, the three
PVs isolated from birds (FcPV1, FlPV1 and PePV1),
which also belong to the Diapsida, are phylogenetically
much closer to the turtle PVs (CcPV1, CmPV1) than to
MsPV1. As the snake PV appears closer to mammalian
PVs, one explanation could be that it belongs to a lineage of PVs, which existed already in Amniota species,
that lived before the split of Synapsida (mammals and
mammal-like reptiles) and Sauropsida. The five other
sauropsid PVs could under these circumstances go back
to a second distinct ancestral lineage. However, an alternative explanation could be that some ancestor of this
virus had been able to cross species barriers between
the Sauropsida and the Synapsida, even long after their
separation.
The limited number of available sauropsid PV
sequences does not allow to precisely elucidate the
ancient events. However, the sequence of this first PV
genome found in a snake may be a valuable piece in the
puzzle of the history of PVs.
