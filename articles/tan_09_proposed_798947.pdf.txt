Abstract
Background: The development of high throughput experimental technologies have given rise to
the “-omics” era where terabyte-scale datasets for systems-level measurements of various cellular
and molecular phenomena pose considerable challenges in data processing and extraction of
biological meaning. Moreover it has created an unmet need for the effective integration of these
datasets to achieve insights into biological systems. While it has increased the demand for
bioinformatics experts who can interface with biologists, it has also raised the requirement for
biologists to possess a basic capability in bioinformatics and to communicate seamlessly with these
experts. This may be achieved by embedding in their undergraduate and graduate life science
education, basic training in bioinformatics geared towards acquiring a minimum skill set in
computation and informatics.
Results: Based on previous attempts to define curricula suitable for addressing the bioinformatics
capability gap, an initiative was taken during the Workshops on Education in Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology (WEBCB) in 2008 and 2009 to identify a minimum skill set for the training
of future bioinformaticians and molecular biologists with informatics capabilities. The minimum skill
set proposed is cross-disciplinary in nature, involving a combination of knowledge and proficiency
from the fields of biology, computer science, mathematics and statistics, and can be tailored to the
needs of the “-omics”.
Conclusion: The proposed bioinformatics minimum skill set serves as a guideline for biology
curriculum design and development in universities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Background
The advancement of modern technology in recent years has
given rise to the development of innovative high throughput, automated biotechnologies such as next-generation
and whole-genome sequencing technologies that allows
for the generation of genome-scale data providing unprecedented systems-level measurements for detecting temporal and conditional changes in various types of cellular
components [1]. The generation of such data has expanded
and transformed the practice of traditional biological
research, signaling the dawn of the “-omics” era [2].
The “-omics” era has brought with it numerous
challenges and hurdles, the most significant being the
processing of the massive amount of datasets and the
extraction of biological meaning from them [3]. Another
considerable challenge lies in the effective integration of
these datasets to achieve global insights into cellular and
molecular behavior and biological systems [3,4]. In view
of these challenges, bioinformatics has proved to be
increasingly vital for the “-omics” to meet the critical
need for the management, analysis and integration of the
massive-scale datasets [5]. This has increased the
demand for highly trained and experienced bioinformatics experts who can handle the data deluge as well as
interface with biologists. The number of courses in
bioinformatics and computational biology producing
such specialists has indeed burgeoned.
Concurrently, it has also raised the requirement for
biologists to possess an ever-increasing capability in
bioinformatics and to communicate seamlessly with the
bioinformatics specialists and experts. This requirement
may be achieved by various means, including ad hoc
training courses, bridging Masters programs, as well as
embedding in the typical undergraduate and graduate life
science education, basic training in bioinformatics geared
towards acquiring a minimum skill set in computation and
informatics.
Various attempts have been made to address and define the
current needs and issues involved in bioinformatics
education. In 2001, the Workshop on Education in
Bioinformatics (WEB) http://surya.bic.nus.edu.sg/web01/
was launched at the 2001 International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) as a
satellite meeting to provide, for the first time, a platform
for bioinformatics educators to discuss fundamental
educational and pedagogical issues determining the nature,
extent, and content of, and delivery tools available for,
bioinformatics degree and training programs, and to
provide focus points and suggestions for improvement of
nascent degree programs [6]. More recently in 2009, the
RECOMB Bioinformatics Education Conference http://
casb.ucsd.edu/bioed/ has focused its attention not just on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S36

equipping biology students with new skills, but also on
shifting the mindset towards more computational courses
in standard biology curricula, even though the best way to
achieve this remains elusive [7]. Specific to an Asian
context, the 3rd East Asia Bioinformation Network meeting
http://eabn.apbionet.org/3eabn08/docs.shtml, held in Singapore (April 2008) witnessed the proposal for minimum
skills required of biologists in bioinformatics and biocomputation (msrBIC), particularly for resource-lacking developing countries of the Association for Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
The first Workshop on Education in Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology (WEBCB) was conducted in
October 2008 with the main purpose of identifying a
minimum skill set for new generation biologists to cope
with the main informatics needs and challenges of the
“-omics” era to be used as a guideline for the development and design of a new bioinformatics or integrated
life science curriculum in the future. As follow-up, a
second WEBCB panel discussion session was held on
September 8, 2009, to present the 2008 report and
collate the conclusions from the two WEBCB meetings.

Results and discussion
Proposed minimum skill set as deliverables of
bioinformatics education
The 2008 one-day workshop, jointly organized by (APBioNet), International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology (IUBMB) and The Federation of Asian and
Oceanian Biochemists and Molecular Biologists
(FAOBMB) was attended by 56 students and bioinformatics researchers and educationists across various countries; the second 2009 follow-up workshop was also well
attended. While all participants recognized bioinformatics
as an inter-disciplinary field encompassing concepts and
techniques from the areas of biology, computer science, as
well as mathematics and statistics, as expected, not all
could agree on a definitive set of topics for implementation
in a standard curriculum.

Some of the major challenges in bioinformatics education raised included the need for unifying the diverse
disciplines within the field of bioinformatics, imparting
to students thinking skills to handle bioinformatics
problems and establishing universal standards for bioinformatics courses at different levels. Bioinformatics
experts originating from computer science tended to
request for a higher content of the “hard” sciences,
pushing for more mathematical and statistical content.
Those with biology backgrounds, generally not formally
trained in computing, would steer towards a more
conservative, tool-user approach to bioinformatics
which the computing community deems as inadequate.

The lack of consensus is reflected in the absence of any
clear definitive standard yardstick one can apply to
graduates of a standard university biology course to
measure their competence in handling the computational
challenges of today’s research environment.
The outcome of these and other workshops thus
gravitated towards the definition of a standard set of
minimum skills for competency in bioinformatics
research that might be agreed upon by all participants.
The minimum skill set, as described next, may then be
tested against any existing curriculum for comparison or
benchmarking.
Definition of minimum skill set
An undergraduate life science curriculum should endeavour to imbue in their students with the necessary skill
sets to survive and thrive in the “-omics” age of research,
where there is an over-abundance of data, information
and knowledge and a scarcity of ability to transform that
into insight, knowledge, positive returns and outcomes
to the society that has subsidized the tertiary educational
process.

Whereas different institutions have differing emphasis
and criteria for a successful modern life science
curriculum, there are signs of some consensus in
defining a minimum skill set for bioinformatics. Instead
of tackling questions such as “How to teach bioinformatics” or “What to teach in bioinformatics to biology
students”, which baffle many educationists as they cope
with competing demands on typically packed biology
schedules, defining a minimum skill set approaches the
problem from the product of the curriculum, the trained
student. What are the skills one would reasonably expect
from a graduate of a biology course? What knowledge,
skills and abilities should they possess? What can we
expect them to do proficiently?
Minimum bioinformatics skill Set
The minimum bioinformatics skill set expected of a
biology graduate, as listed below, represents a distillation of the collective thoughts and ideas of multiple
researchers in several contexts of developed countries
which may not be applicable to the needs or capabilities
of resource-limited developing countries whose societies
have not yet entered the knowledge-based economy. The
minimum skill sets for such developed countries should
be more than that for developing countries, for example,
such as that enunciated for countries in the Association
for South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) during the 3rd
East Asia Bioinformation Network (3rd EABN) 2008,
Singapore held in April 2008 http://eabn.apbionet.org/
3eabn08/docs.shtml

1. Basic essential knowledge in the specific domains of
computer science, statistics and mathematics that intersect with modern biology
Modern biology is increasingly open to application of
specific domains of computer science, statistics and
mathematics. From techniques of programming such as
dynamic programming underlying the basis of sequence
comparison, alignment and analysis, to knowledge representation, machine learning and data mining in recent
years, covering artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic
algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMM), support
vector machine (SVM), these have had tremendous impact
in modern biology. Traditional topics in statistics and
probability, integral and differential calculus, linear algebra, and so on, must not be forgotten either. Such topics
are already present in today’s curriculum of diverse
disciplines from financial engineering and economics to
physics and chemistry, and so biology should be no less
quantitatively rigorous. The main contention here seems to
be how such mathematical and computational ideas
should be conveyed to undergraduate biologists and the
associated pedagogy involved in a packed curriculum. Can
we develop a meaningful understanding of such ideas
without knowledge of programming or some degree of
mathematical formalism?
2. Expertise in communicating and representing biological knowledge and processes in mathematical, statistical and computing terms and concepts
Much of bioinformatics today may be taught as a course in
how to use bioinformatics tools and indeed, many textbooks are starting to look like cookbooks of recipes and
protocols which biology students can follow without
understanding the underlying principles. They often end
up misusing these techniques and misinterpreting the
results. Based on a solid foundation on the concepts, and
a lack of fear in dealing with mathematical, statistical and
computing ideas, biologists still need the ability to represent
biological knowledge in such terms and to communicate
with people from other disciplines in their language. Such
cross-disciplinary communications are vital in today’s
integrative research environment where a physicist may be
locking intellectual horns with clinicians, or a bioengineer
with an ethicist. A curriculum that includes training students
in communicating scientific ideas and presenting knowledge can be transformative. In representing and abstracting
biological knowledge in mathematical, statistical or computing terms, we take it to another level of rigour needed in
today’s world of the “-omics”.
3. Ability to use and/or develop efficient bioinformatics
and biocomputational tools and techniques for the
acquisition, interpretation, analysis, prediction,

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S36

modeling, simulation and visualization of experimental
and other biological data
The range and breadth of the tools and techniques
available today almost defy cataloguing. The average
undergraduate curriculum is bound to include some
explanation of the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST), multiple sequence alignment or the drawing
and interpretation of some phylogenetic tree. The more
advanced courses may even go into SVM predictions or
graphical visualization of 3D models of structure,
homology modeling or ligand-receptor docking. Any
card-carrying biologist must have some ability to use and
in some cases, modify and develop these tools to fit the
task. Indeed, one must be able to traverse a bioinformatics software application from its basic usage to a
critical understanding of the principles underlying the
application, including comprehension of documentation
and publication describing the application.
Moreover, these tasks increasingly form an interconnected pipeline of workflows in today’s research laboratory. Picking up a few scripting (bash, Perl or Python)
and programming languages (Java or C) and mastering
at least one, may not be too far fetched an idea to
include in more ambitious curricula.
4. Proficiency in the search, retrieval, processing, curation, organization, classification, management, and
dissemination of biological data and information in
databases for deriving biological insight and knowledge
discovery
The earliest activities of bioinformatics included the
building of databases. Knowledge of the structure and
content of basic primary databases such as those from
NCBI down to boutique ones is essential as much as the
ability to manipulate and process large databases. As more
data is produced by the “-omics”, and now with next
generation sequencing in the fore, another wave of data
deluge is to be expected. In making sense of the
voluminous data generated in today’s high throughput
laboratory research, topics in database design and curation
and the organization of the information through use of
controlled vocabularies, ontologies and other aspects of
information science is inevitable in the undergraduate
curriculum.
Many of our graduates end up in such research laboratories
and equipping them with basic proficiency in dealing with
database transformation or extraction of data subsets is an
essential skill. Younger biologists more in tune with the
Internet age are often expected to build and run their
laboratory website and maintain databases of data created
in their laboratory. Information dissemination over the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S36

electronic network is a basic routine task. In fact, every
biological research endeavour today starts with the search
and retrieval of information from a simple Google query to
a complex interrogation of specialty databases. Scientific
literature is almost entirely electronic today, and bibliographic reference management to bibliometric analysis of
the principal investigator’s H-index is something many take
for granted. Therefore, proficiency in all these tasks leads to
a better competitive chance at deriving biological insight
and knowledge discovery. Mastering SQL in this context or
learning how to apply PHP to connect a web form with a
database query would be helpful, perhaps as much as
understanding the underlying principles of network connectivity and the TCP/IP Internet protocol.
In this way, a well-trained biologist should be able to
reduce a biological problem to its informatic sources,
and to analyse the data computationally and algorithmically, and wherever possible, to code simple programs
to facilitate the integrative process of solving complex
biological problems.
5. Critical thinking and problem solving skills in
quantitative aspects of biology
As in all basic sciences at the undergraduate level and
beyond, critical thinking is an essential component of
university education. Coupled with problem solving, the
combination is formidable, particularly when applied to
the challenge of shifting biology education from a totally
qualitative exercise to a balance of the quantitative with the
qualitative. Any biology student graduating with strength
in critical thought and ability in problem solving would be
sought after for employment, whether in biological
research or otherwise.
The minimum skill set of five key areas proposed above is
cross-disciplinary in nature, involving a combination of
knowledge and proficiency from the fields of biology,
computer science, mathematics and statistics. It is flexible
enough to be curriculum-tailored to the needs of the
“-omics”. It serves as a guideline for bioinformatics
curriculum design in universities at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels. Such curricula equip students with
knowledge in particular biological domains and software
applications and provide bioinformatics training and
education that nurture transferrable skills such as critical
thinking and problem-solving.
Based on a curriculum covering the minimum skill set
proposed, an undergraduate life science student, in addition
to being well-versed with biological research techniques,
should gain exposure to most components in the skill set,
accompanied with a limited small-scale application and
integration of a few selected bioinformatics tools and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S36

techniques to a research project. A student studying
bioinformatics at the Master’s level, on the other hand,
should minimally possess knowledge on all components in
the minimum skill set, in addition to in-depth applications
of a variety of bioinformatics tools and techniques to a
biological problem, while one at the PhD level should gain
proficiency in all components described in the minimum
skill set, both in theory and application to a wide enough
body of problems covered in the PhD thesis.

Benchmarking the minimum skill set against published
bioinformatics curricula
Following the proposal of a minimum skill set, its usefulness
in evaluating the quality of bioinformatics education was
assessed by comparison against several university bioinformatics curricula described in the literature.

In 2008, Koch et al. reported a basic bioinformatics
curriculum, consisting of topics and skills taught in
nearly all universities and research institutes in Germany
[8]. In agreement with the proposed minimum skill set,
the authors recognized bioinformatics as a strongly
multi-disciplinary field where fundamentals in biology,
mathematics and computer science are critical. In
general, the basic bioinformatics curriculum they
described, at both the undergraduate and master’s
level, fit the scope of the proposed minimum skill set,
imparting students with essential knowledge and principles in the relevant fields of biology, mathematics and
computer science. A prototypical curriculum example
provided is the consecutive bioinformatics bachelor’s
and master’s program implemented in The Free University Berlin. The program covers the fundamentals in
the areas of mathematics, computer science, biochemistry/chemistry and physiology, which represent important elements in the proposed skill set.
On the other hand, Yale University has developed an interdepartmental Ph.D. program in computational biology
and bioinformatics which focuses on three broad core
areas of competency, which include computational biology
and bioinformatics, biological sciences and informatics
(including computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics) [9]. The areas of minimum expected competency
listed, namely in biology - introductory biology and
biochemistry, computer science - introduction to programming, concepts, techniques, and applications of computer
science and data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, lists,
trees, heaps, and graphs), sorting and searching, storage
allocation and management, and data abstraction, mathematics and statistics - multivariate calculus, linear algebra,
and introductory statistics, are found to fall within the
typical scope, and even surpassing the requirements (in the
area of statistics) of the proposed minimum skill set.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S36

In the allied field of biomedical informatics, Altman and
Klein at Stanford [10] have built an integrated PhD, MS,
certificate program and undergraduate major in biomedical computation. Key skills covered in their training
match the skill set described here. Finally, Wingreen and
Botstein [11] in Princeton University describe a first year
graduate course in quantitative biology using a close
reading of classic and pedagogically most successful
papers whose nature and quality function as “vehicles
for teaching both biology and quantitative analysis”.
Here the basic skill set, though advanced in nature, are
fundamentally similar. Physics graduates share their
strengths in quantitative science and biology graduates
share their knowledge of biology as they tackle biological problems exemplified by the papers in a quantitative,
informational and computational manner.

Conclusion
The minimum skill set in bioinformatics recommended for
the future generations of biological/life scientists serves as a
guideline for the development of an integrated life sciences
curriculum across both the undergraduate and graduate
levels. This should also encompasses both lifelong and
transferrable skills such as critical thinking and problemsolving skills, in addition to the essential knowledge in the
specific domains of biology, computer science, statistics
and mathematics, which will prove useful in meeting the
informatics needs and challenges of the “-omics” era in
various ways. Most significantly, the acquired expertise in
biological and mathematical knowledge and computer
languages will facilitate mining of high throughput data
and information to extract valuable biological meaning,
and the development of efficient bioinformatics tools for
the analysis, prediction and modeling of these experimental data. At the same time, proficiency in database
management and Internet technologies will allow for the
creation and maintenance of online websites and databases
for the storage, management, presentation and sharing of
high throughput experimental data, to further boost
research growth and progress in the field.
A sampling of bioinformatics curricula reported in developed countries appear to fulfill and surpass the minimum
skill set requirements. For developing countries, which are
still lagging in the practice of high throughput biological
research, these skill set requirements would more than
enable the best of their graduates to be equipped with a
fundamental base to build on should they intend to
venture overseas for graduate studies. As the field of
bioinformatics rapidly progresses, the expectation of
biology graduates will increase, and this minimum skill
set is expected to change and expand in scope, particularly
as systems biology starts to mature. The question still
remains, how an undergraduate or graduate life science

curriculum already packed with a full schedule of the
fundamentals to the latest developments in biology can
cope with the additional bioinformatics demands of the
new biology.
