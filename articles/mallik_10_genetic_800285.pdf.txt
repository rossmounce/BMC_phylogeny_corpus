Abstract
Background: Genetic relationships among 81 strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A isolated from clinical and non-clinical
sources were discerned by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and multilocus restriction typing (MLRT) using
six loci each. Such studies may reveal associations between the genotypes of the strains and their sources of isolation.
Results: All loci were polymorphic and generated 62 electrophoretic types (ETs) and 12 restriction types (RTs). The
mean genetic diversity (H) of the strains by MLEE and MLRT was 0.566 and 0.441 respectively. MLEE (DI = 0.98) was
more discriminatory and clustered Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strains into four groups, while MLRT (DI = 0.77) identified
two distinct groups. BURST (Based Upon Related Sequence Types) analysis of the MLRT data suggested aquatic
serotype O:6,30-6,31 isolates to be the ancestral strains from which, clinical O:6,30-6,31 strains might have originated by
host adaptation and genetic change.
Conclusion: MLEE revealed greater genetic diversity among strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A and clustered strains in
four groups, while MLRT grouped the strains into two groups. BURST analysis of MLRT data nevertheless provided
newer insights into the probable evolution of clinical strains from aquatic strains.
Background
Yersinia enterocolitica is an important food- and waterborne gastrointestinal agent. It is known to cause a variety of syndromes ranging from mild gastroenteritis to
more invasive diseases like terminal ileitis and mesenteric
lymphadenitis mimicking appendicitis [1]. Blood transfusion associated septicaemia due to Y. enterocolitica has
been reported to have high mortality [2]. Post infectious
sequelae include reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum [1].
Y. enterocolitica is classified into six biovars (1A, 1B, 2,
3, 4 and 5) and more than 50 serotypes [3]. On the basis
of pathogenicity, it has been grouped into highly pathogenic (biovar 1B), moderately pathogenic (biovars 2-5)
and the so called non-pathogenic (biovar 1A) biovars.
Recently, using comparative phylogenomics, Howard et al

[4] suggested that these groups might represent three
subspecies of Y. enterocolitica. The biovar 1A strains are
quite heterogeneous serologically and have been isolated
from a variety of sources viz. stools of diarrheic humans,
animals, food and aquatic sources [5]. The biovar 1A
strains are thought to be non-pathogenic as they lack pYV
(plasmid for Yersinia virulence) plasmid and major chromosomal virulence determinants [1]. However, some biovar 1A strains are known to produce symptoms
indistinguishable from that produced by the pathogenic
biovars [6,7]. Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A has also been
implicated in nosocomial [8] and food-borne [9] outbreaks. A serotype O:6,30 (biovar 1A) strain was reported
to cause placentitis and abortion in pregnant ewes [10]. Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1A was the most predominant biovar isolated from both livestock and humans during a
survey in Great Britain in 1999-2000 and surely needs to
be studied further [11]. Several recent studies suggest
that these strains might possess novel, as yet unidentified,
virulence determinants [12-16].

Serological heterogeneity notwithstanding, Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A has only limited genetic heterogeneity as
revealed by different genotyping methods such as repetitive elements sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting [17], 16S-23S intergenic spacer (IGS) region and
gyrB restriction fragment length polymorphism [18], and
multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA) [19]. Overall, these studies revealed presence of
two clonal groups among biovar 1A strains. These studies
also showed that clinical and non-clinical serotype
O:6,30-6,31 (biovar 1A) strains clustered into two separate groups but failed to reveal any unequivocal associations between genotypes and the source of isolation.
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) is an
important tool used to study genetic relationships where
allelic variations in housekeeping genes are indexed using
electrophoretic mobilities of corresponding enzymes
[20,21]. The technique has been used to study epidemiology of several pathogenic bacteria [22-26]. Multilocus
restriction typing (MLRT), a recently developed tool,
analyses restriction fragment length polymorphism of
several housekeeping genes [27-29].
The objective of this study was to use MLEE and MLRT
to gain further insight into the genetic heterogeneity and
relationships among clinical and non-clinical strains of Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1A.

Methods
Bacterial strains

Eighty one strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A were
examined in this study. Of these, sixty-five were isolated
from clinical and non-clinical sources in India viz. diarrheic human patients (35), wastewater (18), swine (7) and
pork (5) [30-32]. All isolates have been authenticated, and
deposited with Yersinia National Reference Laboratory
and WHO Collaborating Centre, Institut Pasteur, Paris
(France). Of the remaining 16 isolates, ten were obtained
from Elisabeth Carniel (Yersinia National Reference Laboratory and WHO Collaborating Centre, Institut Pasteur,
Paris, France) and six from Jürgen Heesemann (Max von
Pattenkofer Institute, Munich, Germany). Y. enterocolitica 8081 (biovar 1B, serotype O:8), kindly provided by
Mikael Skurnik (Haartman Institute, Finland) was used as
the reference strain for both MLEE and MLRT.
The serotypes, sources of isolation, country of origin
and reference laboratory accession numbers of these
strains have been reported previously [17]. All strains
were maintained as glycerol stocks at -40°C.
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE)

The enzyme extracts were prepared as per the method
described by Selander et al [20]. Briefly, cultures grown
overnight in tryptone soy broth (TSB) were harvested by

Page 2 of 13

centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The cells
were washed twice in potassium phosphate buffer (0.15
M, pH 7.0) and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM NADP,
pH 6.8). The bacteria were lysed by sonication (Sonics)
on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to
obtain the supernatant (enzyme extract), which was
stored in aliquots of 200 μl each at -40°C until use.
The enzyme extracts were subjected to horizontal gel
electrophoresis in 0.9% (w/v) agarose and stained for specific enzyme activities according to the procedures
described by Selander et al [20]. The enzymes studied
were: malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC 1.1.1.37), malic
enzyme (ME; EC 1.1.1.40), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P; EC 1.1.1.49), isocitrate dehydrogenase
(IDH; EC 1.1.1.42), alpha esterase (EST-A; EC 3.1.1.1) and
glutamate dehydrogenase (GD2; EC 1.4.1.4). The
enzymes MDH, ME, G6P and IDH were electrophoresed
in Tris citrate buffer (pH 8.0). For EST-A, potassium
phosphate buffer (gel buffer, pH 7.0; electrode buffer, pH
6.7) was used and GD2 was electrophoresed in a lithium
hydroxide buffer (gel buffer, pH 8.3; electrode buffer, pH
8.1).
Replicate samples from reference strain were run on
each gel, which facilitated comparison of the gels. The
mobilities of the enzymes from different samples on the
same gel were compared. For each enzyme, the distinct
mobility variants were designated as electromorphs and
numbered in order of decreasing rate of anodal migration. The electromorphs of an enzyme were equated with
alleles at the corresponding structural gene locus. Each
strain was characterized on the basis of combination of
its electromorphs obtained for the six enzymes. Distinct
profiles of electromorphs corresponding to multilocus
genotypes were designated as electrophoretic types (ETs).
Statistical analyses

Computer programs written by Prof T. S. Whittam were
used to analyze the ET data and calculation of genetic
diversity [20]. Genetic diversity (h) at an enzyme locus
(i.e., the probability that two isolates differ at the j locus)
was calculated from the allele frequencies as hj = n (1 Σxi2)/n - 1), where xi is the frequency of the ith allele at
the j locus and n is the number of isolates [33]. Mean
genetic diversity per locus (H) was calculated as the arithmetic average of h values for all loci. The genetic distances between pairs of ETs were calculated as the
proportions of loci at which dissimilar electromorphs
occurred. Clustering of data was performed from a
matrix of pairwise genetic distances by the average-linkage method (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages or UPGMA).

Multilocus restriction typing (MLRT)

Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy tissue kit
(Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The six
genes encoding housekeeping enzymes: malate dehydrogenase (mdh), adenylate cyclase (cya), glutamine synthetase (glnA), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (icdA) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA) were selected. For amplification of these
genes, Yersinia consensus primers were designed using
nucleotide sequences from Y. enterocolitica 8081 (biovar
1B, AM286415), Y. pestis (AE009952) and Y. pseudotuberculosis (BX936398) available at EMBL and GenBank databases, after pairwise alignment of the sequences using
ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalW. Primers were
designed with PRIMER SELECT software (DNAStar),
and synthesized from Microsynth. The details of the
primers are given in Table 1.
Polymerase chain reactions were performed in 25 μl of
reaction mixture containing 1 × PCR buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM
MgCl2), 200 μM of each dNTP (MBI Fermentas), 20
pmoles each of forward and reverse primers, 2 U
DyNAzyme™ II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and 100 ng
of template DNA. All amplifications were performed in a
PTC-100™ thermal cycler (MJ Research) according to the
following cycling conditions: initial denaturation for 5
min at 94°C, 30 amplification cycles each consisting of 1
min denaturation at 94°C, annealing for 45 s at the temperatures as given in Table 1, and 1 min elongation at
72°C. The final extension was carried out at 72°C for 10
min. 5 μl of the PCR product was electrophoresed in 1%
(w/v) agarose gel containing 0.5 μg ml-1 ethidium bromide (EtBr) at 80 V for 1 h in 1 × Tris-acetate EDTA buffer (1 × TAE: 40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
The 100 bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs) served as
the molecular size marker.
The restriction enzymes for MLRT were selected by an
in silico restriction analysis of respective gene sequences
of Y. enterocolitica 8081 (biovar 1B) available in GenBank
using MapDraw (DNAStar) such that polymorphism in
the restriction sites was revealed. The PCR amplicons of
six genes for all the 81 strains were digested with enzymes
as shown in Table 1. Restriction digestion was carried out
overnight at 37°C in 25 μl reaction mixture containing 8
μl of the PCR amplicon, 2.5 μl of 10 × buffer and 2 U of
restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Restriction
digests were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
(2.5% gel containing 0.5 μg ml-1 EtBr in 1 × TAE buffer).
Gels were run at 60 V and photographed under UV transillumination. The 50 bp and 100 bp DNA ladders (New
England Biolabs or MBI Fermentas) served as the molecular weight standards.
The restriction patterns for all the isolates were analyzed using Diversity Database Software (version 2, Bio-

Page 3 of 13

Rad). Distinct restriction patterns for each locus were
considered to represent separate alleles, and each allele
was assigned a numeral. As with MLEE, the combination
of alleles at each of the six loci gave a restriction type
(RT). Strains were considered different if the allele of any
of the six loci differed. The genetic diversity h was calculated as described for MLEE. The restriction profile for
each isolate was entered into a database and used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on unweighted-pair
group method with average (UPGMA) linkage of distance, using the START (Sequence Type Analysis and
Recombination Tests) software package http://outbreak.
ceid.ox.ac.uk/software.htm. In addition, clonal complexes
within 81 biovar 1A strains were investigated using the
BURST (Based Upon Related Sequence Types) algorithm
of START software package.
DNA sequencing and analysis

For each allele identified for the six genes used in MLRT,
one amplicon was sequenced to confirm its identity. PCR
products were purified with the QIAquick gel extraction
kit (Qiagen) and DNA sequencing was performed by the
Big-Dye terminator kit using an automated DNA
sequencer (ABI PRISM 3730 genetic analyzer).
Linkage disequilibrium analysis

Linkage disequilibrium for MLEE and MLRT data was
calculated on the basis of the distribution of allelic mismatches between pairs of bacterial isolates among all the
loci examined. The ratio of the variance observed (VO) in
mismatches to the variance expected (VE) at linkage equilibrium provides a measure of multilocus linkage disequilibrium and can be expressed as the index of association
(IA) as: IA = VO/VE - 1 [34,35]. For populations in linkage
equilibrium, VO = VE and IA is not significantly different
from zero, whereas values of IA significantly greater than
zero indicate that recombination has been rare or absent.
To determine whether VO was significantly different from
VE in any sample, a Monte Carlo procedure was iterated,
wherein alleles are repeatedly scrambled to eliminate any
effect of linkage disequilibrium [36]. The LIAN version
3.5 software program [37] was used to calculate IA and
standardized IA (ISA) values and perform Monte Carlo
procedure.
Calculation of diversity index

Simpson's diversity index (DI), a measure of the discriminatory ability of a given typing method, was calculated for
MLEE and MLRT as described by Hunter and Gaston
[38].
Nucleotide sequence accession number

Results
Electrophoretic types (ETs) and genetic diversity

Activities of six enzymes were detected in all 81 strains of
Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A and the reference strain Y.
enterocolitica 8081. All enzyme loci studied were polymorphic and the number of alleles ranged from three
(isocitrate dehydrogenase) to fifteen (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) (Table 2). The mean number of
alleles per locus was 7.5. Esterase was the most polymorphic (h = 0.827), while glutamate dehydrogenase was the
least polymorphic locus (h = 0.250). The mean genetic
diversity (H) of all strains was 0.566 ± 0.088. Among the
81 Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strains, 62 ETs (electrophoretic types) were identified. The reference strain Y enterocolitica 8081 formed a distinct ET, ET63 (Table 3). Fifty
seven ETs were represented only once in the data set. The
ETs which were represented more than once were ET1
(ten isolates), ET8 (six isolates), ET6 (three isolates), and
ETs 20, 36 and 42 (two isolates each).
The genetic relationships among strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A as revealed by cluster analysis using
UPGMA are shown in Figure 1. The shortest genetic distance (0.167) between the ETs corresponded to a single
locus difference. The strains were grouped into 4 groups
(I to IV) diverging at genetic distance of 0.76. The group I
comprising 38 ETs (ET1-20, 22-24, 26, 29-35, 42-44, 49,
60-62) was the largest with 56 isolates belonging to different serotypes and sources. This group was highly diverse

with several subclusters. This group also contained the
most common ET, ET1 which was represented by 9 clinical isolates belonging to serotypes O:6,30-6,31 (3 isolates)
and O:6,30 (6 isolates), and one pork isolate of serotype
O:7,8-8-8,19. Another ET, ET18 was also predominant
and contained 6 Indian strains which included three
wastewater serotype O:6,30-6,31 isolates, one wastewater
serotype O:10-34 isolate and two NAG isolates one each
of aquatic and clinical source. Group II included 4 ETs
(ET56-59) containing one pig throat isolate and 3 clinical
isolates. Group III was formed by 18 isolates representing
17 ETs (ET 21, 25, 27, 28, 36-41, 48, 50-55). These strains
belonged to diverse serotypes and sources from India (15
isolates) and France (3 isolates). The three French isolates
formed a separate subgroup at a genetic distance of 0.64.
Group IV included three European clinical serotype
O:6,30 isolates representing ETs 45-47. MLEE dendrogram revealed that ET1 and ET36 represented by multiple isolates showed close association (linkage distance =
0.0) between isolates from pork/pig throat and human.
Multilocus restriction typing

PCR amplicons were obtained for all six loci using primers and PCR conditions given in Table 1. For each of the
six loci, PCR amplicons of respective sizes were obtained
for all the 81 strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A. The
amplicons were digested with restriction enzymes as
shown in Table 1. The RFLP profiles for each of the six
loci are given in Additional file 1. Collating the PCRRFLP data for six loci in 81 strains, 12 restriction types
(RTs) were identified (Table 3). Reference strain Y. entero-

colitica 8081 (biovar 1B, serotype O:8) was represented
by a distinct RT, RT13. RT1 was the most common
restriction type and was present among 31 (37%) isolates.
The second commonest type was RT2, represented by 20
(25%) isolates while RT3 was the third commonest (15
isolates, 19%) restriction type. Reproducibility of MLRT
was checked by repeating RFLP using selected isolates.
Same allelic profiles were obtained indicating reproducibility of MLRT.
The number of alleles present per locus and genetic
diversity among 81 strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
as determined by MLRT are given in Table 2. Glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) locus was the most
diverse (h = 0.644) while isocitrate dehydrogenase (icdA)
was least diverse (h = 0.336). The mean genetic diversity
(H) of all isolates was 0.441 ± 0.048.

The genetic relationships among strains analyzed by
cluster analysis using UPGMA are shown in Figure 2.
MLRT clustered biovar 1A strains into two clonal groups
(A and B) while the reference strain (Y. enterocolitica
8081, biovar 1B) formed a separate group, at the linkage
distance of 0.78. The group A comprising most (64 of 81)
of the isolates was represented by 9 different RTs. Within
the group A, two subgroups were identified namely, A-I
and A-II. In subgroup A-I, all wastewater serotype
O:6,30-6,31 isolates, human NAG and European O:6,30
isolates were present. Subgroup A-II comprised of all
clinical O:6,30-6,31 isolates, most clinical O:6,30 isolates,
three pork and pig throat isolates each, and five wastewater isolates belonging to different serotypes. The most
common RT, RT1 representing 31 isolates was present in
this subgroup. The group B comprised of 15 isolates
belonging to RT3 and a single isolate each of RT8 and

Mallik and Virdi BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:158
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/158

RT11. Genotypically, this group was quite homogeneous
despite belonging to different serotypes, sources and geographic origin.
The analysis of MLRT data by BURST program identified two clonal complexes (Figure 3) corresponding to the
clonal groups identified above. The clonal complex A
comprising 9 RTs (64 strains) revealed that wastewater
serotype O:6,30-6,31 isolates represented by RT2 were
present in the innermost circle as ancestral strains. The
clinical serotype O:6,30-6,31 strains represented by RT1
and RT12 were present in the outer circle as single locus
variants (Figure 3a) The double locus variants (RT5 and
RT9) and the satellite RTs (RT6 and RT10) were represented by serotypes which are relatively not common.
However, not much information could be inferred from
clonal complex B (Figure 3b).
Sequencing of amplicons from representative strains
confirmed the identity of the genes. Analysis of the
sequences also confirmed the restriction patterns
observed for each of the six genes. This is the first report
on MLRT of Y. enterocolitica.
Analysis of linkage disequilibrium and discriminatory
indices

The frequency of recombination in natural populations
can be estimated by calculating index of association (IA)
between loci [35]. The results of the analysis of multilocus linkage disequilibrium in Y. enterocolitica are summarized in Table 4. The IA and ISA values for the 81 strains
studied by MLEE were 0.613 and 0.128 respectively,
which differed significantly (p < 0.001) from zero indicating that the strains were in linkage disequilibrium. Similarly, significant level of linkage disequilibrium was
observed on analysis of MLRT data. The IA and ISA values
were 3.357 and 0.672 respectively, and differed significantly (p < 0.001) from zero. Simpson's diversity index
(DI) for MLEE and MLRT was 0.98 and 0.77 respectively.

Discussion
Indexing allelic variations in sets of housekeeping genes
provides a good measure of overall genetic heterogeneity
in populations of microorganisms [21]. Methods based
on this principle such as MLEE, MLRT and MLST (multilocus sequence typing) provide good insight into the
genetic relationships among strains. In the present study,
we used MLEE and MLRT to assess the genetic relationships among 81 strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A isolated from clinical and non-clinical sources.
MLEE clustered Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A into four
groups. A close analysis of data presented by Dolina and
Peduzzi [23] who studied human, animal and aquatic
strains of Y. enterocolitica isolated from Switzerland by
MLEE, revealed that 51 biovar 1A strains clustered into

Page 8 of 13

two major groups, although minor clusters having one
and six isolates each were also observed. Another study
that used fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) also clustered biovar 1A strains into two
groups: one group comprised of biovar 1A strains; while a
few biovar 1A strains clustered with atypical pathogenic
biovars constituting the second group [39]. Further study
by comparative genomic DNA microarray however
showed that these biovar 1A strains constituted a single
group [4]. Other studies using rep-PCR genotyping [17],
16S-23S IGS and gyrB RFLP [18], and MLVA [19] have
also clustered biovar 1A strains into two clonal groups.
MLEE revealed a total of 62 electrophoretic types (ETs)
among 81 biovar 1A strains and showed high degree of
discrimination (DI = 0.98). Studies of allelic variation by
MLEE also revealed sufficient genetic diversity (H =
0.566) among strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A. Similar genetic diversity was also reported in previous MLEE
studies on Y. enterocolitica [22,23].
In the present study however, based on the number of
distinct ETs generated, the clinical serotype O:6,30 and
O:6,30-6,31 isolates were shown to be heterogeneous
with mean genetic diversities (H) of 0.514 ± 0.112 and
0.442 ± 0.078 respectively. Previous studies in which
other techniques namely rep-PCR [17], 16S-23S IGS and
gyrB RFLP [18], and MLVA [19] were used to type these
strains did not reveal this heterogeneity. Fearnley et al
[39] also reported heterogeneity among serotype O:6,30
strains wherein seven AFLP types were identified among
eight strains.
In the MLEE dendrogram, two ETs showed some pork
and pig strains to be identical to the strains isolated from
diarrheic human subjects suggesting that like pathogenic
biovars [11,22,40], pigs may be the source of biovar 1A
strains isolated from human patients. No such grouping
of human and pork/pig isolates was evident from earlier
studies [17,18]. However, this observation needs to be
explored further by making use of a larger number of pig/
pork isolates belonging to biovar 1A.
Multilocus restriction typing (MLRT) has recently been
used to discern phylogenetic relationships among strains
of Streptococcus pneumoniae [41], Neisseria meningitidis
[28,42], Burkholderia cepacia [27,43], Staphylococcus
aureus [44] and Escherichia coli [29]. MLRT has been
reported to show good correlation with PFGE [27,29] and
has been advocated as a cost effective alternative to
MLST, which is relatively an expensive technique [28,42].
In the present study, MLRT divided 81 strains of Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1A into 12 RTs based on a combination criteria of number of alleles and restriction patterns
observed at each of the six loci examined. Cluster analysis
of MLRT data revealed two clonal groups - A and B. The
reference strain Y. enterocolitica 8081 (biovar 1B) formed
a distinct RT. Although MLRT profiles showed good

reproducibility, the method failed to rival the discriminatory ability of MLEE. In the context of Y. enterocolitica
biovar 1A, the discriminatory ability of MLRT (DI = 0.77)
was lower than even rep-PCR (DI = 0.84) [17] and MLVA
(DI = 0.87) [19].
Two clonal complexes were identified following BURST
analysis of MLRT data. The primary clonal complex contained all but 3 RTs, representing 78% of the isolates. The
other complex contained the remaining strains. The
approach used in the BURST analysis specifically examines the relationships between closely related genotypes
in the clonal complexes [45]. This analysis revealed that
in the primary clonal complex, wastewater serotype
O:6,30-6,31 isolates represented the ancestral strains
while, clinical serotype O:6,30-6,31 strains occupied
radial position as single locus variants. This observation
corroborates the recent findings obtained from the study
of VNTR loci which also suggested that the clinical serotype O:6,30-6,31 strains probably originated from the
wastewater strains, by host adaptation and genetic
change [19].
The analysis of linkage disequilibrium indicated clonal
structure for Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A as values of IA
and ISA were found to be significantly different from zero

for both MLEE and MLRT data. Other genera, which
have been reported to have clonal structure, include Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B [46], Mycobacterium spp. [47], Vibrio cholerae [24] and Pseudomonas
stutzeri [25].
Both MLEE and MLRT showed European strains to be
more heterogeneous than the Indian strains. MLEE
revealed that each of the 15 strains from France and Germany had distinct electrophoretic profiles indicating
their heterogeneity. MLRT also revealed that the European strains, which displayed 5 RTs were more heterogeneous compared to Indian isolates. Genetic heterogeneity
of European biovar 1A strains has been reported earlier
using PFGE [48] and FAFLP [39]. A previous study using
multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis also
identified 13 MLVA types among 15 European biovar 1A
strains [19]. This suggests that European and Indian
strains may constitute separate groups and might be
evolving independently in two different settings. It would
be interesting to explore these evolutionary aspects by
comparative whole genome sequencing or multilocus
sequence typing of Indian and European strains. It was
also observed that strains with different serotypes (O
antigen) types produced identical ETs or RTs and were
closely related genetically. Also, in some cases, same O

antigen was shared by strains that were different genotypically. These observations indicate O antigen switching in
strains of Y. enterocolitica as suggested recently by MLST
[49]. Such observations have however been reported in
other bacteria also [24,41,50]. Thus, given the enormous
discriminatory power of genotyping techniques such
observations also emphasize the need to discuss threadbare, the question of suitability of widely used typing
techniques like serotyping.

Conclusion
More diversity was observed among clinical and nonclinical strains of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A when MLEE
was used. Sixty-two electrophoretic types were identified
among 81 strains, which clustered into four distinct
groups. MLRT identified 12 restriction types and was distinctly less discriminatory, clustering the strains into two
groups. The BURST analysis of the MLRT data nevertheless provided newer insights into the probable evolution
of clinical strains from those present in the aquatic environments.
