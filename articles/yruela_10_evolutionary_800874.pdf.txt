Evolutionary divergence of chloroplast FAD
synthetase proteins

Abstract
Background: Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetases (FADSs) - a group of bifunctional enzymes that carry out the
dual functions of riboflavin phosphorylation to produce flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and its subsequent
adenylation to generate FAD in most prokaryotes - were studied in plants in terms of sequence, structure and
evolutionary history.
Results: Using a variety of bioinformatics methods we have found that FADS enzymes localized to the
chloroplasts, which we term as plant-like FADS proteins, are distributed across a variety of green plant lineages and
constitute a divergent protein family clearly of cyanobacterial origin. The C-terminal module of these enzymes does
not contain the typical riboflavin kinase active site sequence, while the N-terminal module is broadly conserved.
These results agree with a previous work reported by Sandoval et al. in 2008. Furthermore, our observations and
preliminary experimental results indicate that the C-terminus of plant-like FADS proteins may contain a catalytic
activity, but different to that of their prokaryotic counterparts. In fact, homology models predict that plant-specific
conserved residues constitute a distinct active site in the C-terminus.
Conclusions: A structure-based sequence alignment and an in-depth evolutionary survey of FADS proteins,
thought to be crucial in plant metabolism, are reported, which will be essential for the correct annotation of plant
genomes and further structural and functional studies. This work is a contribution to our understanding of the
evolutionary history of plant-like FADS enzymes, which constitute a new family of FADS proteins whose C-terminal
module might be involved in a distinct catalytic activity.

Background
Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are essential cofactors for numerous
enzymes (i.e., dehydrogenases, oxidases, reductases) that
participate in one- and two-electron oxidation-reduction
processes critical to the major metabolic routes in all living
organisms [1-4]. Riboflavin (RF), the precursor of FMN
and FAD can be de novo synthesized by plants, fungi and
many bacteria, but in mammals the only known RF source
is the exogenous riboflavin (vitamin B2) obtained through
the diet [5-7].
In most prokaryotes, the synthesis of FMN and FAD
is catalyzed from RF and ATP by a single bifunctional
enzyme, usually known as FAD-synthetase (FADS),
through the sequential action of its two enzymatic

activities: an ATP:riboflavin kinase (RFK, EC 2.7.1.26)
that transforms RF and ATP into FMN, and an ATP:
FMN adenylyltransferase (FMNAT, 2.7.7.2) that catalyzes the subsequent adenylylation of FMN to FAD.
Thus, FADS is a bifunctional RFK/FMNAT enzyme [8].
FADSs are typically 310-340 residues in length and are
folded in two modules [9-11], each one mainly involved
in one of the activities. The RFK reaction has been
related with the C-terminal module (RFK-module),
while the N-terminal module is mainly related to the
FMNAT activity (FMNAT-module); hence, two independent substrate binding and catalytic sites are in
charge of each activity [11,12]. In one hand, the RFKmodule (~ 180 aa) folds in a globular domain and its
overall topology is similar to that found in the RFKs
from Homo sapiens (HsRFK) and Schizosaccharomyzes
pombe (SpRFK), with differences only observed in the
loops connecting secondary structure elements [13,14].
Furthermore, the substrate binding motifs PTAN and

GxY of the RFK-module are conserved among FADSs
and eukaryotic RFKs. In the other hand, the FMNATmodule consists of an a/b dinucleotide binding domain
with a typical Rossmann fold topology (~ 150 aa) [9-11].
Moreover, it seems to be remotely similar to the nucleotidyltransferase (NT) superfamily and contains the typical (H/T)xGH and xSST/SxxR motifs involved in
binding nucleotide and phosphate groups. Interestingly,
monofunctional enzymes with only RFK activity have
been described in Bacillus subtilis [15] and Streptococcus
agalactiae [16] but no monofunctional FMNAT
enzymes have been reported in prokaryotes.
A different scenario is found in eukaryotes, where
both activities are generally split in two different
enzymes with either RFK or FMNAT activity [17-20].
As mentioned above, the RFK enzymes show sequence
and structure similarity to the RFK-module of prokaryotic FADS [13,14]. However, eukaryotic FMNATs share
little or no sequence similarity to the FMNAT-module
of FADS, as these enzymes belong to two different protein superfamilies, which are thought to require different
sets of active-site residues to carry out the same chemistry [21-23]. The eukaryotic FMNAT-module is currently
classified as a member of the 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase-like family belonging
to the “adenosine nucleotide a-hydrolase-like” superfamily, which has motifs different from those of NTs.
In plants only a few efforts have been devoted to this
system. Early studies characterized apparently monofunctional enzymes with either RFK or FMNAT activities in several plant species [24-27]. In those studies the
subcellular localization of RFK and FADS was not
addressed although it is known that plants use flavin
nucleotides in mitochondria, plastids and in the cytosol.
In an earlier work RFK activity was associated to the
cytosol and to an organellar fraction containing chloroplasts and mitochondria [28]. More recently, a bifunctional enzyme with both FMN hydrolase and RFK
activities has been described in Arabidopsis thaliana
(AtFHy/RFK) [29], whose N-terminal module responsible for the FMN hydrolase activity, shares sequence
similarity with members of the haloacid dehalogenase
(HAD) superfamily. AtFHy/RFK enzyme was predicted
to be cytosolic [29]. Additionally, two more enzymes
with FMNAT activity have been identified, cloned and
characterized in the same species [30]. These AtRibF1
and AtRibF2 enzymes, herein plant-like FADS proteins,
have an N-terminal module which is found to be homologous to the FMNAT-module of FADS, but instead its
C-terminal module does not catalyze RF phosphorylation. AtRibF1 and AtRibF2 were localized to the chloroplast [30]. In mitochondria, the catalytically conversion
of RF into FMN and FAD has been reported, due to the
existence of mitochondrial RFK and FADS enzymes

[31], but nevertheless FADS activity was much lower
than in chloroplasts. These results agree with the cited
confocal microscopy studies [30], but the hypothesis for
the localization of FADS isoforms (AtRibF1 and
AtRibF2) in mitochondria cannot be ruled out on the
basis of bioinformatics (TAIR) analysis [31]. The mitochondrial FAD-forming enzymes reside in two distinct
monofunctional enzymes, which can be separated in
soluble and membrane-enriched fractions. It is worth
mentioning that the genes encoding organellar RFK
activity remains unidentified.
In order to investigate RFK and FMNAT activities in
plants we have conducted an extensive bioinformatics
survey using the available genomes in public databases.
Here we report the identification of a conserved C-terminal module in plant FADS enzymes, which does not
contain the typical RFK active site sequence, suggesting
that it belongs to a new family of FADS proteins. The
activity of this module is discussed.

Results and Discussion
Sequence and evolutionary analysis

As shown in Table 1, most prokaryotic genomes (1178/
1194) surveyed in this study, including cyanobacteria, contain a single gene encoding for a bifunctional FADS
enzyme, hereafter identified as FADS-type I protein.
Sequence searches in a variety of repositories of green
plant sequences allowed us to identify a related group of

genes, which contain two domains with high similarity
(see Methods section) to FADS-type I sequences (Figure 1
and 2), and are also present in a single copy in most cases
with currently available complete genome (14/18). This
result agrees with previous work by Sandoval et al. [30].
The N-terminal module of these proteins displays high
similarity to the FMNAT-module of prokaryotic FADStype I, showing the typical motifs HxGH and xSST/SxxR
involved in FMNAT activity, also common to other NTs.
However, several observations can be made with respect
to the C-terminal module in plant proteins: i) its length is
40 to 60 residues shorter; ii) the PTAN motif characteristic of the RFK activity mutates to PxS; iii) a LNxPP motif
is found conserved in plants, next to the invariant GxY
motif. AtRibF1 and AtRibF2 belong to this group of proteins and were recently characterized by Sandoval et al.
[30], who did not detect any RFK activity in these
enzymes. This experimental observation, together with the
absence of the PTAN motif suggests a different enzymatic
activity for this module. Therefore we named these proteins as plant-like FADS.
Furthermore, a few bacterial parasites and pathogens
isolated from plant, human or soil material and belonging to phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes and
Spirochaetes contain extra sequences with significant
similarity to FADS-type I (E-values ≤ 1.5×10-10). However, as shown in Figure 1 and 2, these sequences do
not conserve the catalytic PTAN motifs, and have
shorter C-terminal modules similar in length to plant
like-FADS, suggesting that they might constitute
another divergent type of FADS, which we label as
FADS-type II (see Table 1).
In our sequence searches, plant-like FADS proteins
are distributed across a variety of green plant lineages.
Among land plants we found 84 matches (62 in Eudicots, 11 in Monocots, 6 in Coniferophyta, 3 in Magnoliids, 1 in Bryophyta, 1 in Lycopodiophyta). Other than
land plants, plant-like FADS proteins were restricted to
unicellular photosynthetic organisms belonging to phylum Chlorophyta (Micromonas pusilla, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, Coccomyxa sp. and Ostreococcus lucimarinus) (see Table 2). All plant genomes surveyed encode
these proteins in the nuclear genome (sequence searches
in chloroplast genomes did not produce matches). Our
search strategies did not find plant-like FADS proteins
in any other eukaryotic genomes. These observations
might imply that these genes have a prokaryotic origin,
somewhat related to the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts. On the other hand, all green plant genomes
explored have a copy of the cytosolic bifunctional FHy/
RFK protein except two Micromonas species that have a
monofunctional RFK enzyme like in most eukaryotes.
Proteins related to the HAD domain of FHy/RFK have
been found in either bacteria or eukaryotes but this

Page 4 of 13

enzyme has been suggested to be unique in plant
lineages probably being originated by fusion of a HAD
to an eukaryotic-type RFK [29].
With the aim of further exploring the origin of plantlike FADS proteins, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis, which is summarized in the phylogram in Figure 3.
According to this tree, which was rooted by taking the
sequence of the cytosolic protein AtFHy/RFK from Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup, plant-like FADS proteins are closer to the group of cyanobacteria than any
other bacterial species, which were selected to represent
taxa included in Table 1. Indeed proteins from both cyanobacteria and green plants are enclosed in a clade with
an associated approximate likelihood ratio (aLRT) of
0.80. These observations suggest that plant-like FADS
proteins have a prokaryotic origin closely related with
cyanobacteria, although shaping a divergent group of
sequences, as illustrated in Figure 3. Note that AtFHy/
RFK clusters apart from prokaryotic FADS, confirming a
different origin for this enzyme. The tree also suggests
that plant-like FADS proteins diverged from bacterial
FADS probably before the separation of the two major
plant phyla (Streptophyta -plants and their closest green
algal relatives- and Chlorophyta -the rest of green algae), since they are present in species from both. In order
to further investigate this, we searched for putative
plant-like FADS homologues in Mesostigma viride, proposed to be the earliest plant lineage and anterior to the
divergence of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta [32].
Unfortunately, the nuclear genome of this species is not
available and the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes yielded no sequence matches. Our findings could
indicate that plant-like FADS indeed derived from cyanobacterial FADS, despite the fact that they are now
encoded in the nuclear genome [33].
Moreover, these results reveal that most bacteria containing FADS-type II sequences have also typical FADStype I proteins (see Table 1) and the tree in Figure 3
shows that these two types of sequences cluster together,
implying that they might actually be paralogous genes.
Only the genomes of Eubacterium saphenum ATCC
49989, Mycoplasma conjunctivae, Treponema pallidum
subsp. Pallidum contain exclusively FADS-type II proteins. Although the tree does not support that FADStype II proteins constitute a distinct evolutionary class,
their shorter and non-conserved C-terminal domains still
clusters them clearly as a distinct functional group,
which might have lost the C-terminal activity typical of
FADS-type I proteins.
We also note the observed variability in terms of RFK
and FMNAT enzymatic activities in bacterial genomes.
While most prokaryotes have a single copy of a typical
FADS-type I sequence, in 4 species both enzymatic
activities are separated in monofunctional proteins,

which correspond to RFK or FMNAT modules, respectively. In other cases the FADS-type I sequence was
accompanied by either monofunctional prokaryotic
FMNAT (5 genomes) or monofunctional prokaryotic
RFK (2 genomes). For instance, the genome of Alistipes
putredinis contains both a monofunctional RFK and a
FADS-type II sequence. Furthermore, although most
bacterial FADS and RFK proteins include the conserved
PTAN motif, some sequence variants can be found,
including PTLK, PTLN, PTIN or KTAN, which nevertheless conserve the C-terminal module length. As these
genomes do not contain any other RFK related proteins,
these sequence variants are supposed still to be responsible for the RFK activity.
FADS-type I sequences were also found in 8 eukaryotic
species (Table 2), including Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis sp., Trichoplax adhaerens, which is considered
to be the most primitive multi-cellular animal known, or
the freshwater amoeba Paulinella chromatophora, which
harbours a cyanobacterial endosymbiont.
It has been proposed that the double enzymatic activity
of FADS proteins might be the result of a gene fusion
event that genetically perpetuated an ancient proteinprotein interaction [8,34]. If this hypothesis holds true, it
is remarkable that 1190 out of 1194 bacterial genomes
have a copy of this fused gene (Table 1) while monofunctional RFKs are vastly predominant (658/755) across
eukaryotic genomes (Table 2). This observed unbalance
suggests that this fusion event, or functional coupling,
would have been evolutionary favoured only in unicellular organisms, from which chloroplasts are thought to be
derived.
We would like to remark that FADS proteins are
annotated in sequence databases with confusing or

contradictory names such as riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibF (i.e., YP_002487514.1), FMN adenylylate transferase (i.e., NP_692523.1), FMN adenylyltransferase (i.e.,
YP_001623829.1), FAD synthase (i.e., YP_518746), riboflavin kinase/FMN adenylyltransferase (i.e., YP_932710),
flavokinase/FAD synthetase (i.e., YP_002783884), riboflavin kinase/FAD synthetase (i.e., NP_975116.1). Indeed,
non-strictly FADS sequences are also named as that
(i.e., YP_003062293.1). In the case of plants, plant-like
FADS sequences are found as riboflavin kinase (i.e., gb|
CO899788.1|, gb|BG509026.1|, gb|CN491424.1|) or protein-s isoprenylcysteine o-methyltransferase (i.e.,
PTHR12714, gb|GR935784.1)|, cassava1385). This misleading variability in names is of no benefit to users,
and clearly so a consensus in the nomenclature would
be desirable. We hope this work makes a contribution
in this direction.
A putative molecular function for the C-terminal module
in plant-like FADS proteins

PSI-BLAST searches of both the complete sequence of
the plant-like FADS AtRibF1 and its C-terminus
matched only NTs and RFKs (10 iterations, E-value
< 3×10 -8 ) from bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast and
human. No other family was identified as related to the
C-terminus of plant-like FADS. The similarity between
the newly identified C-terminal module and NTs was
further explored in the pdb70 structural library using
the fold-recognition algorithm HHPred in local and global mode. Local searches provided significant matches
(E-value ≤ 1.4×10-17) to: the RFK-module of TmFADS
(pdb 1mrz, 1s4m, 1t6x, 1t6y, 1t6z, 2i1l; [9,10]), SpRFK
(pdb 1n08, 1n05, 1n07, 1n06; [13]), HsRFK (pdb 1nb0,
1nb9, 1p4m, 1q9s; [14]) and Trypanosoma brucei RFK
(pdb 3bnw). Apart from these hits, global searches with
the C-terminal domain yielded significant matches
(E-values ≤ 2.5×10-6) to: nicotinamide mononucleotide
(NMN) adenylyl transferase/ribosylnicotinamide kinase
from Haemophilus influenzae (pdb 1lw7), ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase from H. sapiens (pdb
3elb), nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (pdb
2qjt) from Francisella tularensis and the C-terminal
module of bifunctional nicotinamide mononucleotide
(NMN) adenylyltransferase/Nudix hydrolase from Synechocystis sp. (SyNadM-Nudix) (pdb 2qjo; [35]).
To evaluate the possible role of the C-terminal module
of plant-like FADSs and the molecular arrangement of
this protein region we modelled the AtRibF1 structure
using all the above mentioned protein structures as templates. The best predicted models, as expected in terms
of sequence similarity and alignment quality in putative
binding and catalytic regions were obtained with the
X-ray structure of TmFADS, SpRFK and HsRFK. In order
to annotate putative functional residues, the comparative

models were superposed to the original templates,
including all ligands present in the experimental coordinates. The superposition in Figure 4 indicate that plant
conserved residues 290 P×S 292 and 302 GVY 304 in the
model occupy equivalent positions with respect to the
ligands (ADP and FMN) present in the crystallographic

structure of TmFADS. Similar results were obtained with
SpRFK and HsRFK (data not shown). The predicted secondary structure of AtRibF1 corresponds well with that
of TmFADS (see Figure 1 and 2), although it lacks the
last a-helix at the N-terminal end, which is conserved
also in SpRFK and HsRFK. This helix appears to be

crucial for a correct orientation of the bound flavin substrate [14] and its absence in AtRibF1 is in agreement
with the observed lack of RFK activity [30].
Figure 4 shows the specific-plant conserved residues
Leu295, Asn296, Leu297, Pro298 and Pro299
(295LNLPP299 motif), Cys307, Cys319, Glu331, Gln344,
Glu352, Phe353 and Gly354. It can be observed that the
LNLPP motif is located in a flexible loop, in an opposite
site of that bound FMN or ADP in TmFADS and orientated towards a cavity. Furthermore, the conserved residues Ser292, Cys307, Glu331 and Glu352 appear
orientated towards this cavity suggesting that this site
could possibly be a putative new binding-site in plantlike FADSs. It is also worth mentioning that Glu331 residue, invariant also in FADS and RFK families (i.e.,
Glu268 in FADS-type I from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes [11]), has been proposed to act as a catalytic base.
As mentioned above, remote similarity of the Cterminal module of plant-like FADSs was found with
the C-terminal domain of other families such as
SyNadM-Nudix (E-value = 6.8×10-08), which belongs to
a large superfamily of pyrophosphohydrolases (see Additional file 1; Figure S4). In Arabidopsis 27 Nudix hydrolase genes have been found and the proteins they
encode are able to hydrolyze various types of nucleoside
diphosphates derivatives such as ADP-glucose, ADPribose and a wide range of its derivatives, FAD, NADH,
NADPH, and diadenosine polyphosphates [36]. Moreover, a remote sequence consensus of this protein
region including the LNxPP motif was found with serine/threonine phosphatases 2C and members of the
hydrolase superfamily. These observations suggest that
the C-terminal module of AtRibF1 could have a function
other than RFK enzymatic activity. Sandoval et al. [30]
showed that purified recombinant AtRibF1 and AtRibF2
enzymes only display FADS activity, with undetectable
RFK activity and hence assumed that these are indeed
monofunctional enzymes. However, they were able to
measure FMN hydrolase, FAD pyrophosphatase and
RFK activities in Percoll-isolated chloroplasts.
As mentioned above, our bioinformatic analyses point
out that plant-like FADS proteins could be bifunctional
enzymes. More precisely, structural similarities predict a
hydrolase and phosphatase activity for the C-terminal
module, although the possibility to have a nonenzymatic regulatory role or to be a simple evolutionary
relic should not be dismissed. Nevertheless, considering
the results of Sandoval et al. [30] and ours, we could
speculate that some of the measured activities in isolated chloroplasts (i.e., FMN hydrolase or FAD pyrophosphatase) could be associated to this C-terminal module.
In order to test this hypothesis we have designed some
experiments with recombinant plant-like FADS from
soybean (Glycine max) and preliminary results seem to

Page 10 of 13

indicate that its C-terminal module might have a hydrolytic activity since GmFADS was able to convert FMN
into RF (data not shown). Interestingly, this activity was
not detected in purified FADS from C. ammoniagenes, a
typical FADS-type I protein [11]. While these preliminary results seem to be in agreement with our theoretical
analyses, clearly further investigations are necessary to
confirm the possible enzymatic role of the C-terminal
module of plant-like FADS. Future work will be done by
using recombinant plant-like FADS (GmFADS) in order
to confirm this observed hydrolytic enzymatic activity.

Conclusions
Plant-like FADS enzymes are distributed across a variety
of green plant lineages and constitute a divergent protein family clearly of cyanobacterial origin. Homology
models predict that plant-specific conserved residues are
orientated towards a cavity, building a distinct active
site when compared to that involved in substrate binding and catalysis in the C-terminus of typical FADS-type
I enzymes. The remote relationship reported here
between plant-like FADS proteins and members of pyrophosphohydrolase or phosphatase superfamilies as well
as preliminary experimental results suggest that the Cterminal module of these proteins, clearly of bacterial
origin, might be involved in a catalytic function.
Methods
Sequence analysis

The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (nr),
nucleotide collection (nr/nt) and concise microbial protein databases, and the CyanoBase (http://genome.
kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/) sequence library, were scanned
with PSI-BLAST [37] and TBLASTN, in order to
retrieve sequences similar (E-values < 10-14) to: i) FADS
from Thermotoga maritima (UniProtKB Q9WZW1
[9,10]), ii) RFK from Bacillus subtilis (GenBank
AAC00333.1) and iii) the plant-like FADS AtRibF1
(At5g23330, NP_568429, GenBank ACH56223.1) or
AtRibF2
(At5g08340;
NP_568192,
GenBank
ACH56224.1). To increase sensitivity, further similar
sequences were retrieved by scanning either the Nterminal or the C-terminal modules of prokaryotic and
plant-like FADS and RFK proteins.
In order to increase the recovery of plant sequences,
which are currently distributed from a variety of repositories, the AtRibF1 sequence was also scanned against
JGI Genome portal (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/), Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/) and PLAZA (http://
bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) with E-values
< 10-50. Finally, further searches were performed against
NCBI Expressed Sequence Tags (filter: Viridiplantae)
and TIGR Plant Transcript Assembly databases, with
E-values < 10-20.

Multiple alignments

Phylogenetic analysis

The multiple alignment in Figure 1 and 2 was constructed in three steps, using the AtRibF1 protein as
seed:

The trimmed multiple alignment described above was
used to drive a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
with PhyML [42] and the best fitting amino acid substitution model selected with ProtTest [43]. The tree was
midpoint-rooted and plotted with FigTree (http://tree.
bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).

1) A sequence profile of plant-like proteins was
compiled with ClustalW [38].
2) A selection of bacterial and eukaryotic sequences
was aligned to the profile.
3) The sequence of Thermotoga maritima was added
following the fold recognition alignment produced
by HHPred [39] using the Protein data Bank structure 1mrz. This template was predicted to be the
best modelling template by the BioInfoBank Meta
Server (see below).
The multiple alignment used to drive the phylogenetic
analysis summarized in Figure 3 was constructed as follows:
1) A representative set of FADS-type I and FADS-type
II sequences were multiply aligned with CLUSTALW
[38] and their secondary structure was predicted with
PSIPRED [40] taking the Thermotoga maritima
sequence as a representative. The sequences selected
are representative of bacterial species having FADStype I and/or FADS-type II, and belonging to phyla
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes and Tenericutes. Also sequences from species containing only
FADS-type I, which belong to phyla Chlamydiae,
Chlorobi, Chloroflexi (green non-sulfur bacteria), Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria (purple bacteria) and Thermotogae are included, providing a good coverage of
diverse phylogenetic bacterial groups.
2) The sequence of the cytosolic protein AtFHy/RFK
from Arabidopsis thaliana [29] was added and
aligned as an outgroup, and the resulting multiple
alignment was converted to a hidden Markov model
in HHSearch format with hhmake [39].
3) All plant-like FADS protein sequences that covered most of both domains (from the HxGH to the
GxY motif) were considered complete, aligned with
CLUSTALW [38] and converted to a hidden Markov
model, including the PSIPRED secondary structure
prediction of AtRibF1. The plant sequences selected
cover the diverse phylogenetic groups of green
plants as shown in Additional file 1; Figure S1.
4) The profiles 2) and 3) were globally aligned with
hhalign [39] and the resulting alignment was
trimmed by removing the poorly aligned segments,
following the protocol “automated1” of the trimAL
software (http://trimal.cgenomics.org/) [41]. The original and trimmed alignments are available in Additional file 1; Figures S2 and S3.

Molecular modelling

To further investigate possible molecular functions of the
C-terminal module of plant-like FADS proteins the complete protein sequence of AtRibF1 as well as its C-terminal
domain were submitted to the BioInfoBank Meta Server
[44]. The best aligned template provided by FUGUE [45]
and PSI-BLAST [37] were subsequently employed to drive
homology modelling with Modeller [46]. Further templates were found with HHpred [39] scans of the pdb70
library. Structural superposition and alignments were performed with the software MAMMOTH [47]. Molecular
structures and models were inspected, analyzed and
plotted with PyMol [48]. Secondary structure predictions
were made with PSIPRED [40].
Production of GmFADS and activity measurement

GmFADS gene synthesis, and E. coli protein overexpression and purification were carried out by GeneScript USA Inc. Conversion of FMN into RF was qualitatively assayed by addition of GmFADS or CaFADS
[11] (final enzyme concentration ~ 0.2 μM) to a solution
(final volume, 150 μl) containing 50 μM FMN, either 0
or 0.2 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl 2 , in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0. After incubation overnight at 25°C or 5
min at 37°C the reaction was stopped by boiling the preparations for 5 minutes. Transformation of FMN was
visualized by resolving the products of the reaction at
room temperature and in the dark by TLC on Silica Gel
SIL-G-25 (20 cm × 20 cm, thickness 0.25 mm) plates.
The moving phase was a solution of butanol:acetic acid:
water (12:3:5). Flavin TLC spots were visually examined
and scanned by determining their fluorescence under an
ultraviolet light [11].
