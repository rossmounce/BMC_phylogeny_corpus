Abstract
Background: The environmental sequencing of the Sargasso Sea has introduced a huge new
resource of genomic information. Unlike the protein sequences held in the current searchable
databases, the Sargasso Sea sequences originate from a single marine environment and have been
sequenced from species that are not easily obtainable by laboratory cultivation. The resource also
contains very many fragments of whole protein sequences, a side effect of the shotgun sequencing
method.
These sequences form a significant addendum to the current searchable databases but also present
us with some intrinsic difficulties. While it is important to know whether it is possible to assign
function to these sequences with the current methods and whether they will increase our capacity
to explore sequence space, it is also interesting to know how current bioinformatics techniques
will deal with the new sequences in the resource.
Results: The Sargasso Sea sequences seem to introduce a bias that decreases the potential of
current methods to propose structure and function for new proteins. In particular the high
proportion of sequence fragments in the resource seems to result in poor quality multiple
alignments.
Conclusion: These observations suggest that the new sequences should be used with care,
especially if the information is to be used in large scale analyses. On a positive note, the results may
just spark improvements in computational and experimental methods to take into account the
fragments generated by environmental sequencing techniques.

Background
The environmental sequencing of the Sargasso Sea [1] has
raised expectations in fields as diverse as marine ecology
and energy conservation. As a result of the work a huge
new resource of genomic information, comprising more

than one million distinct protein sequences from an estimated 1,800 new species, has been made available to the
public sequence databases.

The quantity of new protein sequences made available by
this project is remarkable. At the time of their sequencing
there were almost as many protein sequences in the Sargasso Sea resource as were held in the current public databases. At 90% redundancy the combination of
SWISSPROT, TREMBL and TREMBLnew databases [2], for
example, contained 783,110 protein sequences as of April
2004, while the Sargasso Sea resource has 643,044
sequences. The environmental genomics community has
plans to gather bacteria from more of the world's oceans
and from other environments, which makes the released
sequences only a taste of what is to come.

Initial analyses [3,4] have compared the functional and
base composition of the sequences in the Sargasso Sea
database with several other environmental resources.
Here we hoped to answer a different question, how the
Sargasso Sea sequences are distributed in the context of
known protein families. We were interested in how the
composition and structure of the new sequences influences their classification into previously known protein
families, whether the new sequences complemented the
sequences in the existing public databases or whether they
formed distinct groups separated by discontinuities. If the
new sequences were distinct, to what extent were they different to the sequences from the cultivated species in the
current databases and what can they tell us about the limitations of the analyses based on those sequences?
We find however that the high proportion of sequence
fragments in the resource means that it is impossible to
reach any conclusions about the sequence distribution
and that studies carried out with the new resource may be
unduly biased by these sequence fragments. Since it is
beyond doubt that environmental sequencing projects
will push the numbers of protein sequences far beyond
today levels, it is important to understand the effects of
such large numbers of sequences from such radically different origins will have on our understanding of sequence
space and what effect will this have on analysis of protein
structure and function.

Results and discussion
While the protein sequences in the public online databases were derived from organisms from a wide range of
ecosystems, the sequences from the Sargasso Sea are from
a clearly differentiated marine environment. In addition,
the species sequenced from the Sargasso Sea, and those
that will be sequenced in similar projects in the future, are
non-cultivated species, something else that sets them
apart from the species whose sequences have traditionally
made up the protein databanks. The details of the process
for identifying genes (alignments with bacterial protein
sequences were used to determine the most likely coding
frames and the stop and start codons) is also likely to play
a role in the relative distribution of sequences in the database.
One further difference from the sequences in the current
databases is the technology used to sequence them. The
Sargasso Sea sequences come from a pull of the entire
DNA present in the Sargasso Sea and were sequenced
using shotgun technology with low coverage. Hence there
are no complete genomes present in the resource and for
most of the annotated genes the species is unknown.

Make up of Sargasso Sea protein sequence resource
The sequences have a low GC-content and consequently a
high isoleucine, asparagine and lysine content (40% over
average) coupled with decreases in the content of certain
other amino acids (see Figure 1). The isoleucine, asparagine and lysine content and the lower GC-contents of the
Sargasso Sea is only comparable to a small number of
other bacterial genomes, such as Staphylococcus aureas, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Campylobacter jejuni[5]. The relative
figures for isoleucine, lysine and asparagine are 8.58, 7.56
and 5.68% for S. aureus and 8.18, 7.74 and 5.75% for the
Sargasso Sea sequences. While it is surprising to find that
an entire environment can have such a distinct GC-content, a recent study by Foerster et al. [4] has confirmed our
findings and suggests that environment may actually
shape GC-content.

Another very important observation is that the Sargasso
Sea sequences are shorter, on average 205 residues compared to the typical 342 of the Curr-nr database. In fact
many Sargasso Sea sequences are fragments of whole protein sequences and this fact has been explicitly mentioned

80,000 sequences and a smaller 11th section (with identifiers beginning with "eaa") has the remaining sequences.
The distribution of sequence lengths within each of these
sections is not identical, as can be seen in figure 2b. The
figure shows that eight of the 11 sections compared ("eaa"
to "eah") are composed entirely of sequences with fewer
than 400 residues. While the other three sections ("eak",
"eai" and "eaj") do contain sequences of greater than 400
residues, there are relative fewer full length sequences
than would be expected from the sequence length distributions of the whole prokaryotic genomes, which have a
significant tail of longer sequences.

Length distribution for the Sargasso Sea resource
Length distribution for the Sargasso Sea resource.
Figure 2a shows the percentages of sequences in each of 18
different length bins. Bars in blue represent the number of
sequences in each bin for the SSea-nr database, those in yellow show the corresponding distribution for the Curr-nr
database and those in orange show the length distribution for
sequences from all completely sequenced prokaryotic
genomes. The distribution shows clearly that the lengths of
the Sargasso Sea sequences are much more highly concentrated at lengths between 50 and 300 residues. In figure 2b
the same bins are used, but the Sargasso Sea sequences are
split into their eleven constituent parts. This shows clearly
that most of the fragments are to be found in sections "eaa"
to "eah". The section "eaa" contained only 21,000 sequences,
compared to the 100,000 sequences in the other bins.

before [6]. The influence of sequence fragments can be
seen graphically when the distribution of Sargasso Sea
sequence lengths is compared to those from a non-redundant database made up of SWISSPROT, TREMBL and
TREMBLnew sequences (the Curr-nr database) and those
from a database made up of the sequences from all completed bacterial genomes (Figure 2a).
The protein sequences in the Sargasso Sea resource are
split into 11 sections by name. Of these 11 sections, 9 contain 99,999 sequences each. The first section (which has

The relationship between the Sargasso Sea sequences and
known protein families
BLAST [7] searches of the Sargasso Sea database failed to
find a single similar sequence for 47 of the 237 query
sequences. For 14 of the 47 cases, remotely related Sargasso Sea sequences could be found using PSI-BLAST
when the Sargasso Sea sequences were combined with the
Curr-nr sequences (the Combined-nr database), something which indicates that the standard sequences are able
to occupy an intermediate position between the query
sequence and Sargasso Sea sequences in a small number
of cases.

However, combining the Sargasso Sea sequences with the
current non-redundant databases did not appear to help
in the search for remotely homologous proteins. As part of
the investigation into the effects on alignments for structure prediction (see below), PSI-BLAST searches were carried out with a set of 51 query proteins (63 domains) from
the homology modelling section of the CASP 4 and CASP
5 (the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) experiments [8]. The searches were supposed to determine whether the sequences from the
Sargasso Sea (the SSea-nr database sequences) would help
to detect templates that could be used in model building.
PSI-BLAST profiles were first generated as per the methods
section and then the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [9] was
searched with the profiles. Candidate sequences that
could be used as templates were discovered for 48 of the
63 domains in searches of the standard database (Currnr), while when the Combined-nr database was used (the
database to which the SSea-nr sequences had been added)
only 42 of the 48 templates could be identified. The addition of the Sargasso Sea sequences actually decreased the
capacity to detect templates.
The same effect was apparent when searching for
sequences belonging to known protein families. We compared those 181 query proteins for which PSI-BLAST had
detected at least 5 homologous sequences from searches
of each of the three sequence databases (SSea-nr, Curr-nr,

and Combined-nr) and found that searches of SSea-nr
database turned up fewer sequences on average (618
sequences) than searches of the Curr-nr database (807
sequences). PSI-BLAST searches of the Combined-nr database turned up fewer sequences than the two databases
separately (1099 sequences), of which almost half were
from SSea-nr database. The number of sequences found
from the Curr-nr database, the database that included the
sequences with functional and structural information,
dropped to just 552.
While some small variations might be expected due to differences in E-values related to the different size of the
databases being used, case by case investigations documented below made it clear that what was actually happening had little to do with database size.
In many cases searches of the Sargasso Sea and the Combined-nr databases reached a point where fewer sequences
were found with successive iterations. For example, a
search of the Sargasso Sea with the query 1qorA found
2740 sequences on round 2 and only 1559 on round 3. In
other words the profile used to search for sequences in the
3rd round finds 1,181 fewer sequences before converging.
In this case the profile has lost 40% of the sequence information. This did not happen with the corresponding
searches of the Curr-nr database with this target. The same
thing happens with query 2dkb (2122 sequences on
round 3, 1766 on round 4) and with a number of others.

Profiles and optimal sequences
PSI-BLAST creates multiple sequence alignments using the
sequences it finds in each search iteration. The program
then constructs a profile based on the frequency of amino
acids at each residue position in the multiple sequence
alignments and by taking into account substitution matrices. PSI-BLAST uses these profiles to search the databases
on subsequent search iterations, so the information contained in the profiles is directly linked to the sequences
found with each iteration. In order to investigate the odd
effects of addition of the new sequences to the databases,
and in particular how searches based on known families
are affected we concentrated on these profiles.

Profiles are effectively a matrix formed by the 20 amino
acids and the number of residue positions in the query
sequence. Each residue in each position in the matrix has
a probability score associated to it, a probability score that
is calculated from the frequency of each residue in that
position in the multiple alignment and from the replacement probabilities that come from the substitution matrix
that is used.
The profile can be used to derive the so-called optimal
sequence, defined as the sequence that can be obtained
from the highest scoring residues in each position in the
profile. The sequence reflects the conservation of each residue position and also the similarity score of the residue
pairs. The profile generated from a correctly aligned set of
homologous proteins should be enriched in high-scoring

residues in those positions that have the most conserved
amino acids in the family. In these cases the optimal
sequence will be similar to the homologous proteins that
have gone to make up the profile.
However, if the conserved positions are not properly
aligned, the optimal sequence will reflect random matching residues and, by virtue of its definition, will be dominated by residues with a high average similarity score, i.e.
by rare residues such as tryptophans and, to a certain
extent, cysteines (Figure 3). This is what can be observed
in the optimal sequences generated from Sargasso
sequences. The effect has nothing to do with the residue
make up of the Sargasso Sea – the Sargasso Sea sequences
have the same percentage of tryptophans and cysteines as
the sequences in the current databases and actually have
less low complexity regions than the current databases.
On closer inspection these rare residue repeats were also
found in the optimal sequences of PSI-BLAST profiles generated from other databases – however, they were found
much more frequently in profiles generated from searches
of the SSea-nr and Combined-nr databases.
That the optimal sequences extracted from the PSI-BLAST
matrices contain high proportions of tryptophans and
cysteines can be seen clearly in Figure 4. Here we compare
the proportions of each residue in the optimal sequences
generated from PSI-BLAST searches of the Combined-nr
database with the background levels of each residue in the
sequences of the Sargasso Sea and Current databases that
make up the Combined-nr database. There are ten times
as many tryptophan residues in the optimal sequences as
in the database sequences and cysteine is represented five

Alignment conservation (entropy)
The optimal sequences are generated from the PSI-BLAST
profiles for each target, while the profiles are calculated
directly from the PSI-BLAST alignments. It is possible to
measure the conservation of residue positions in an alignment using residue entropy. We calculated the residue
entropy for all 237 of the PSI-BLAST multiple alignments
generated from searches of the Combined-nr database
(which contains both Sargasso Sea and current database
sequences) and plotted entropy directly against each of
the optimal sequences for each of the 237 target
sequences (we show an example in Figure 5). We also
plotted entropy against the residue type of the optimal
sequences drawn from the profiles (Figure 6).

The plot of entropy versus optimal sequence residue (Figure 6) clearly correlates tryptophans in the optimal
sequences with low entropy and therefore with poor residue conservation. Tryptophan is the most frequent residue in the optimal sequences; it has the lowest entropy
and the lowest variance around the mean of all the residues. Not only that, but repeated tryptophan residues
have even less entropy and very little variation in entropy
score, showing that repeated tryptophans always mark residues with little or no evolutionary information.
One more example of the relationship between entropy
and optimal sequence is shown in the plot of entropy
against the optimal sequence of target T0171 in Figure 5.
While much of the optimal sequence is characterized by a
series of jagged peaks and troughs, representing the variable levels of conservation at each position, the part of the
optimal sequence that is a long string of tryptophans
essentially flat-lines, showing that all conservation has
disappeared from these residues.
The regions of repeated rare residues in the optimal
sequences are clearly symptomatic of those regions of low
entropy and low conservation that are devoid of all evolutionary information. These repeated residues are most
often tryptophan. We chose to use a scoring scheme based
on the repeated rare residues (Profile Discriminatory
Quality, see below) in order to make comparisons,
because this score better highlighted the clear differences
between the different databases used in the study.
Profile discriminatory quality
We calculated the discriminatory quality of the three databases used for the query proteins searches as per the methods section. Discriminatory quality was the percentage of
the optimal sequence that was not made up of tryptophan
or cysteine repeats. If the optimal sequences are free of

A plot of residue entropy against the optimal sequence for CASP target T0171. Here the relative entropy is plotted against the optimal sequence of query T0171. Relative entropy is calculated from the alignments from the final iteration of
the PSI-BLAST search of the Combined-nr database. The optimal sequence is drawn from the PSI-BLAST profile of the same
target. Notice that the entropy flattens out and that this region of low entropy and low conservation coincides with the long

cysteines and tryptophans, the profile discriminatory
quality will be 100. The discriminatory quality of the current databases (Curr-nr) is considerably higher than the
Sargasso Sea database. The discriminatory quality score of
profiles generated from the Curr-nr database is 93.69 over
all query sequences, compared to 88.49 for the SSea-nr
database. Therefore searches against the SSea-nr database
turn up optimal sequences with almost twice as many
tryptophans and cysteines as searches against the current
databases.
The effect of combining the two sequence databases is to
make the discriminatory quality of the profiles substantially worse – the Combined-nr database has a discriminatory quality score of just 85.22 over all query sequences.
Profile Discriminatory Quality was calculated from profiles generated for all 237 target sequences so the SSea-nr
and Combined-nr scores include those PSI-BLAST
searches which found no sequences and therefore will
have had discriminatory quality scores approaching 100.
Given the strange composition of the Sargasso Sea
sequences in terms of fragments (fig 2a) it is quite possible that the presence of fragments is behind the results
obtained with the database searches.

In order to find out if this is the case and what other reasons might be causing the odd behaviour of the Sargasso
Sea sequences, we created three more databases that we
could use for comparison. Two of the databases were created in order to eliminate as many fragments as possible.
First to investigate the effects of fragments on the profiles
we created a combined 90% redundant database from the
Curr-nr sequences and sections eak, eaj and eai of the Sargasso Sea (Combined_itok). These three sections have a
length distribution that is much more similar to that of
the Curr-nr and the combined prokaryote databases (see
Figure 2). This version of the database contained
1,025,174 sequences
While many of the fragments from the Sargasso Sea were
eliminated while creating the Combined_itok database, it
was clear from Fig 2b that there are still a number of fragments in sections eak, eaj and eai of the Sargasso Sea
resource. We attempted to remove as many fragments as
possible, this time by creating a Sargasso Sea resource with
a minimum sequence size of 250 residues. Although not
all the fragments will have been removed, the smallest
fragments will have been taken out. The non-redundant
database created in this way (Combined_GT250) had
1,053,952 sequences, approximately the same size as the
Combined_itok database (1,025,174 sequences).

Figure 6
A plot of entropy versus optimal sequence residue
A plot of entropy versus optimal sequence residue.
Bars in orange show the mean relative entropy for each of
the 20 amino acids. Entropy is shown on log scale. Amino
acid type for each residue position was determined from the
optimal sequences generated from the PSI-BLAST profiles
and came from searches of the Combined-nr. The bar
marked "WW" refers to tryptophans in repeats. The purple
line shows the variance of the relative entropy. Positions
with repeat tryptophans clearly have the lowest mean
entropy and the lowest variance.
As a comparison and in order to eliminate the effect of
database size we generated an updated version of the
Curr-nr database, this time with sequences from the April
10, 2005 version of the combined SWISSPROT, TREMBL
and TREMBLnew databases. This database contained no
sequences at all from the Sargasso Sea resource and had
1,005,858 sequences, almost the same size as the two
databases created above.
The profile discriminatory quality for these two new databases was measured as in the methods section. The results
are shown in Table 1. It seems that increasing size of the
search database makes little difference to discriminatory
quality. What does make a difference to the discriminatory quality is the fragment content.
The mean discriminatory quality of the profiles generated
from the Curr-nr (April 2005) and Curr-nr (April 2004)
databases are almost identical despite the difference in
database size. Despite the fact that the Curr-nr (April
2005) and Combined_itok are practically the same size,
the mean discriminatory quality of the profiles generated
from the latter are considerably worse. This confirms that
the strange effects that are being seen in the
Combined_itok and Combined-nr databases are not simply the result of adding new sequences to the existing
databases.
While reducing the number of fragments by using the better quality sequences from sections eaj, eai and eak does

have the effect of improving the mean discriminatory
quality of the profiles, the improvement is by less than
one point. However, removing those fragments with fewer
than 250 residues improves the discriminatory quality
score by 6.5 points compared to the Combined-nr database and by more than 5.5 points combined to the
Combined_itok database.
One other difference between the results from these two
databases was that there were more Curr-nr sequences
found
from
searches
of
the
fragment-poor
Combined_GT250 database (778 sequences on average)
than from the fragment-rich Combined_itok database
(631 sequences). The fact that more Curr.-nr sequences
were found with the higher quality Combined_GT250
database suggests that removing most of the fragments
increases the searching power of PSI-BLAST.
The
profile
discriminatory
score
for
the
Combined_GT250 database is still not as good as that of
the Curr-nr (April 2005) database, but this difference is
almost certainly due to the fact that the
Combined_GT250 database still contained fragments,
fragments that were greater than 250 residues in length
and that affected profiles generated for the longest of the
query sequences.
As a further test we also created our own fragmentised
database with the April 2005 version of the Curr-nr database. All sequences were split randomly once and the largest part of the sequence retained for the database. Searches
with the 237 query sequences of this database gave profile
discriminatory scores of 89.1, compared to the 93.36 of
the non-fragmented database, confirmation that a simple
fragmentation of the current databases was enough to recreate much of the deleterious effects of the Sargasso Sea
sequences.
An example: the Ftsa family
We looked at one family in particular, the Ftsa family. Ftsa
is essential for bacterial cell division. We took the Thermotoga Maritima Ftsa sequence from the solved PDB structure
1ef4A and used it as the query in a PSI-BLAST search of the
Combined-nr database. 1ef4A has 419 residues. There are
three clear ATP-binding motifs, one in the N-terminal,
one in the centre of the sequence and one at the C-terminal end of the sequence [10].

The sequences found in each round were aligned using
CLUSTALW [11]. The results were instructive even in the
first iteration (effectively just a BLAST search). BLAST
found 165 sequences from the combined database, 74
from the Curr-nr database and 91 from the SSea-nr database. The alignment showed that all the sequences bar

databases, the combined database with all the Sargasso Sea sequences (Combined-nr), the public databases at the time of deposition of
the sequences (Curr-nr (April 2004)), the same databases a year later (Curr-nr (April 2005)) and three databases of similar size (i) the
current databases and sections eai, eaj and eak of the Sargasso Sea resource (Combined_itok), (ii) the current databases and sequences
from the Sargasso Sea of length 250 or greater (Combined_GT250) and (iii) a fragmentised version of the April 2005 databases (Curr-nr
(April 2005) Frags). Profiles were generated for all 237 target sequences and profile discriminatory quality is described in the methods
section. The size of each database in thousands of sequences is also shown. The table shows that profiles generated from databases
with a high proportion of fragments have less discriminatory power.

base were fragments that were not long enough to align all
three binding motifs. In fact even 20 of the 42 sequences
detected from sections "eak" to "eai" of the Sargasso Sea
database also turned out to be fragments and not long
enough to align all three motifs. None of the Curr-nr
sequences were fragments.

sequence families from the current databases. Here we
describe some of them, with particular emphasis on the
influence of the high proportion of fragments in the
resource. Differences may be related to differences in family distributions or may simply be due to the influence of
the anomalous sequence size distribution.

Interestingly one of the 22 whole protein sequences from
the Sargasso Sea found by the BLAST search had mutations in each of the three motifs that were not apparent in
the sequences from the Curr-nr database, a second whole
sequence had mutations in two of the motifs and a
number of the fragments from the SSea-nr database had
unique and distinct mutations at the C-terminal motif.
This suggested that there might indeed be sequence variations in the families present in the Sargasso Sea resource,
although clearly this effect was from a single example and
on a large scale any such effects were being drowned out
by the poor alignments and the high fragment content.

Regions of low complexity
We ran the low complexity detection program SEG [13]
for all the sequences in both the Curr-nr and SSea-nr databases in order to detect regions of low complexity in the
sequences that might be biasing the PSI-BLAST searches.
SEG finds that in fact the Sargasso Sea sequences have proportionally more complexity than the sequences in the
current databases (Curr-nr). 5.7% of the Sargasso Sea
sequences are masked by SEG, compared to almost 8% of
the sequences from Curr-nr (see Figure 1). A database
composed of all prokaryotic sequences from complete
genomes had just 6.2% of residues in SEG-defined low
complexity regions, suggesting that the complexity of the
Sargasso Sea sequences was in line with what would be
expected. PSI-BLAST searches with the query sequences
were carried out both with SEG on and off. It made little
difference to final result.

In the second round CLUSTALW was no longer able to
produce a good alignment of the 776 sequences found.
While the first motif is relatively well aligned, the central
motif is not at all aligned. The alignment from MUSCLE
[12] is somewhat better, though far from perfect. The central motif is well conserved in this alignment. The N-terminal and C-terminal motifs are not well conserved,
though more than half the sequences found in the second
round are too short to have both the N-terminal motif and
the C-terminal motif. One fragment has only 32 residues.
The results from the second round show how the fragments invade the profile and begin to destroy the discriminatory quality. After 4 rounds the N-terminal and Cterminal motifs are still recognisable in the optimal
sequence calculated from the PSI-BLAST profile, but the
central motif has disappeared.
Additional features of the Sargasso Sea resource
During the sequence analysis we detected a number of
interesting differences with the standard behaviour of

Sequence clustering
To assess the distribution of the Sargasso Sea sequences in
relation to the rest of the known sequences, we collected
all sequences found from the BLAST searches of the Combined-nr database (as above). Fig. 7 shows the results of
the distribution of the E-values from the BLAST searches.
These scores are a measure of the similarity between the
detected sequence and the query.

Even though the Combined-nr database contained substantially more Curr-nr sequences than SSea-nr sequences,
BLAST detected as many Sargasso Sea sequences as Currnr sequences. However, the Sargasso Sea sequences were
found with substantially higher E-values. While the
shapes of the two distributions are similar, the Sargasso
Sea sequence distribution is shifted relative to the Curr-nr

the Sargasso Sea. Both databases contained approximately
780,000 sequences. We used cd-hit [14] to create nonredundant databases for the two at 90, 80, 70, 60 and
50%. The results are shown in Table 2.

It is clear that the Sargasso Sea sequences have more
redundancy. This might perhaps not be surprising given
their dependence on a very unique ecosystem and might
it would be easy to leap to wrong biological conclusions,
but again it might be wrong to interpret the results this
way since this pattern would also be typical of a database
composed of fragments of sequences.

sequence distribution and it has a higher mean E-value
(lower level of sequence similarity with the target
sequence). If there were no length bias in the Sargasso Sea
database, this behaviour would indicate that the Sargasso
Sea sequences were more divergent. However, the higher
E-values of the Sargasso Sea sequences is also likely to be
due to the amount of sequence fragments in the databases
since in BLAST the shorter the alignment, the higher the Evalues in general. This shows too that even the results of
BLAST searches with Sargasso Sea resource should be
treated with extreme caution.
Redundancy
To investigate further the different sequence distribution
we created a sequence database from all the bacterial and
archaea sequences in the SWISSPROT and TREMBL databases. As a comparison we created a second database of a
similar size from sequences from groups "ead" to "eak" of

Sequences in homology modelling
The capacity to build models by homology is one of the
techniques that have improved over recent years, in part
due to the expansion of the sequence databases. The different organisation of the Sargasso Sea sequences with
respect to the previously known databases might affect
this capacity. To assess this question we compared the
accuracy of the alignments that could be obtained with
and without the Sargasso Sea sequences.

The addition of the new sequences adversely affected the
quality of the pair-wise target-template alignments in 12
of the 32 cases we tested. In these cases the difference in
the number of correctly aligned residues in the pairwise
alignments implied by the multiple sequence alignment
was an average of 17%. In 11 cases the differences were
small (no more than 1%), and in just seven cases the
alignment shows a modest improvement (an average of
10%), demonstrating again that far from improving the
quality of the models, the Sargasso Sea sequences have a
tendency to decrease model quality. Again this could be a
consequence of sequence fragments.

Conclusion
The sequences from the Sargasso Sea differ markedly from
those currently in the databases, only 11,700 sequences
(under 2%) of the 90% redundant Sargasso Sea database
overlapped at 90% identity with the equivalent sequences
from the current databases. In addition the new sequences
have a much higher isoleucine, asparagine and lysine content and are considerably shorter on average than the
sequences currently in the databases. This last observation
is due to the sequence fragments from incomplete ORFs
that are found in all sections of the Sargasso Sea resource.
The Sargasso Sea sequences form the first large set of environmental sequences released to the databases and it is
therefore interesting to investigate the consequences of
adding a great number of sequences from a radically different environment to the protein families in the current
databases. For example, some of these new environmental
sequences may well occupy distinct and differentiated

regions of sequence space at the periphery of the previously known protein families, or may be effective at populating sparsely-populated protein sequence space.

nisable from PSI-BLAST searches, the fragmentary nature
of the new sequences often distorts the multiple alignments to such an extent that family characteristics are lost.

From a practical point of view, more sequences in the
databases ought to lead to more powerful automatic tools
for sequence searching, creating multiple alignments and
predicting function by linking clusters in sequence space.
In particular it is a commonly held belief that the growth
of sequence databases has increased and will continue to
increase our capacity to define protein families [15], propose new functions [16,17], predict binding sites [18],
predict secondary structure [19] and derive models by
homology [8].

Chen and Pachter [21] have recently highlighted the problems of including partial, fragmented sequences from
environmental sequence projects in phylogenetic analyses
and in multiple sequence alignments. They describe the
problem as an extreme case of the missing data problem
[22]. This is almost certainly what is happening here as
well. Since almost all multiple sequence alignment methods penalise terminal gaps, they are not good at aligning
sequences if there is a high proportion of partial, fragmented sequences in the sequences to be aligned.

We analysed whether the new sequences fulfilled their
promise and to what extent they could be assigned to
known families from the standard databases. However,
we found that the high proportion of sequence fragments
in the resource made it impossible to reach any conclusions about the sequence distribution. In addition the
new sequences result in more profile drift, a decrease in
the quality of pairwise and multiple alignments, more difficulty in detecting homologues and defining families and
conserved functional regions.

The practical consequence of the Sargasso Sea sequences
for bioinformatics tools
As we have shown here, the quality of the sequences in the
Sargasso Sea resource means that it is difficult to carry out
large scale investigations into whether these sequences
represent a discontinuity in the previously known protein
sequence space, or whether our knowledge is biased
towards the small corner of the ecosphere we know about.

Our results show that PSI-BLAST multiple alignments
built from these sequences tend to have large, poorly
aligned regions with little conservation and low entropy.
These "dead" zones of poor conservation and low entropy
are characterised by repeated rare residues in the optimal
sequences drawn from the profiles. The dead zones indicate where profiles have lost evolutionary information
and search power – in fact those profiles that contained
large dead zones also often found fewer sequences with
successive PSI-BLAST iterations.
PSI-BLAST has many well documented flaws [20], none of
which were found to have had any bearing on the overall
results. The strange results are almost certainly an example
of severe database contamination. The poor quality of the
alignments generated from the Sargasso Sea sequences
were universal, the other two multiple methods used in
this study, CLUSTALW and MUSCLE, also had great difficulty in aligning related Sargasso Sea sequences. Nor are
hidden Markov model methods much more successful at
generating profiles with Sargasso Sea sequences (A. Rojas,
personal communication).
We have shown conclusively that the peculiar behaviour
of the Sargasso Sea sequences in this study is caused by the
high proportion of sequence fragments. The fragments
adversely affect the building of multiple sequence alignments and profiles. The results show that even where
sequences can be clustered into sequence families recog-

When first released these environmental sequences were
included in many of the public searchable databases, and
for a time results from the main publicly available BLAST
servers were tainted by the sequences. They have since
been removed from all the main web-based BLAST servers
[23]. These results justify the decision to remove them on
the grounds that the fragments were distorting the
searches and the profiles.
The expansion represented by these environmental
sequences exposes certain limitations in the current techniques. If researchers are to make use of the new wealth of
environmental sequences, how will they deal with the
problems caused by the high proportion of sequence fragments if the new sequences are of such poor quality? This
is an emerging problem, not only because of the number
of environmental sequencing projects currently underway, but also because sequence fragments are being
deposited directly into Uniprot by gene annotation
projects. Even though they are in smaller number, these
sequence fragments are not benign and a number of them
have already appeared in expert databases such as Pfam
[24].
The hope is that these new sequences will push us to
improve bioinformatics tools, possibly by developing
methods better suited to deal with large numbers of
incomplete sequences. Simple, makeshift solutions
include filtering databases prior to their use or allowing
users to put a length filter on the sequences included in

environmental

The quality of the sequences and possible biological
conclusion
The Sargasso Sea sequences are from a range of species
subject to the same environmental pressure. This has led
researchers to investigate whether there are differences
from the current databases. For example, Meyer [6] used
iron-sulphur proteins to suggest that the Sargasso Sea
resource showed that microbial diversity has been underestimated by an order of magnitude. While the distribution of the sequences in the Sargasso Sea resource and
those in the current databases may indeed be different, the
results from this study suggest that additional work may
have to be considered before any secure conclusions can
be made.

Indeed the same is true about any study where Sargasso
Sea sequences are used in database searches or multiple
alignment methods. For example, while one interpretation of the E-value distribution we found in Figure 7
might be that there is true biological divergence of the
sequences, the most likely explanation is that the fragment content of the Sargasso Sea resource is the cause of
the higher E-values. In general, the shorter the alignments
in BLAST the higher the E-values, so the E-values for the
Sargasso Sea sequences must be greater simply because
they are fragments. If the E-values of the partial sequences
are higher than for the full sequences, then BLAST will
automatically find less homologues, and so even BLAST
results should be treated with care when the Sargasso Sea
resource is used.
Recently there have been a rash of studies that have used
Sargasso Sea sequences in comparisons using BLAST or
phylogenetic profiles based on alignments [for example
[3,25-27]]. While the results of these studies are of great
interest, the fact that the Sargasso Sea fragments introduce
a bias into such studies may need to be taken into
account.
Despite these reservations we did observe interesting deviations from of the behaviour of normal families in isolated examples that might indicate that there are
differences in the distribution of sequence families in the
Sargasso Sea resource, small differences that are being
masked by the poor quality of the Sargasso Sea sequences.
Given the masking effect of the sequence fragments, it is
difficult to tell to what extent these small changes are a
result of the unique evolutionary pressures on the Sargasso Sea sequences and to what extent they might be due
to errors resulting from the low coverage depth of the
shotgun sequencing techniques used to sequence the Sargasso Sea sequences.

In the future the sequences from new environmental
genomics initiatives may still provide us with invaluable
insights into some of the key issues in evolution. In particular, the flooding of the databases with sequences from
environmental sequencing projects may impact on key
predictions for the total number of families and folds [2830] and the number of structures needed to cover the
sequence space by structural genomics efforts [31,32].
Revisiting these predictions in the light of the sequences
from the environmental sequences may make us more
aware of where we have reached in our efforts to describe
global protein sequence space.

Methods
Search databases
The Sargasso Sea database was built from sequences
culled from the whole genome shotgun sequencing of the
Sargasso Sea from the GenBank database [33]. A 90%
redundant database was created from these sequences
with the clustering program cd-hit. There were just over a
million sequences in the original resource deposited in
GenBank and the non-redundant Sargasso Sea database
(SSea-nr) contained 643,044 sequences.

There is a small fraction of the Sargasso Sea sequences,
fewer than 100 sequences, that contain a non-standard
amino acid (marked as X in the sequence), in every case as
a result of a translation from the base "N" (any). All these
100 sequences appear in section 6 of the 17 separate environmental sequence files in GenBank, clustered in 4 close
groups.
A local non-redundant database was built from the
sequences stored in the SWISSPROT, TREMBL, and TREMBLnew databases as of April 2004, the date of publication
of the new sequences. This database was also clustered at
90% redundancy. The resulting non-redundant database
(Curr-nr) contained 783,110 protein sequences.
A third non-redundant database was built by amalgamating the two non-redundant databases. This combined
database (Combined-nr) had 1,414,454 sequences at
90% identity after clustering with cd-hit. Only 11,700
sequences (0.82% of the whole database) were removed
by cd-hit during the process.
Query sequences
For the experiments involving sequence search methods
we needed target sequences. We took 87 query sequences
from CASP experiments 5 [34] and 6 [35] and selected
150 more query sequences from the PDB. These PDB
sequences had been used in a previous study [18] because
each of them had a remotely homologous PDB template
that contained site residue information. A total set of 237
query sequences were used in the study.

Creating the profiles for scoring the alignments
PSI-BLAST sequence profiles were generated from all three
non-redundant databases for each of the 237 query
sequences. The profiles were generated by running PSIBLAST for four iterations and with the default options.
The profiles were used to deduce the optimal sequences
for each of the target sequences and each of the databases.
Profile discriminatory quality
In a number of cases PSI-BLAST actually started to find
fewer sequences with successive iterations of the databases. We assessed the profiles generated by PSI-BLAST for
these sequences and the optimal sequences extracted from
the PSI-BLAST multiple alignments. We found that the
optimal sequences in these cases were characterised by
their low complexity and by very high proportions of tryptophans and cysteines. High proportions of tryptophans
and cysteines in the optimal sequences are a side effect of
the loss of discriminatory quality in sequence profiles.

We used the quantity of cysteines and tryptophans in the
optimal sequences from profile generated by PSI-BLAST in
order to generate a measure of the discriminatory quality
of each profile. Profile discriminatory quality here is
defined as:
100 - (W + C-wb-cb)
where W is the percentage of tryptophans in the optimal
sequences, C the percentage of cysteines in the optimal
sequences and wb and wc the background percentages of
cysteines and tryptophans in the sequence database that
PSI-BLAST used to build the profile. If the discriminatory
quality of the profiles were perfect there would be no
more cysteines and tryptophans in the optimal sequences
than in the sequence databases and the profile discriminatory quality would be 100.
Sargasso Sea sequences in comparative modelling
The Sargasso Sea resource was also used to create alignments for the purposes of building 3D structural models.
31 domains from 27 CASP 4 [36] and CASP 5 [8] comparative modelling targets from a previous study [37] were
used for the comparison. The targets were chosen because
they were targets for which PSI-BLAST had been able to
identify a structural template at the time of the CASP
experiments. The best template for each of the considered
CASP 4 and CASP 5 targets was defined as the protein with
the highest structural similarity with the target structure
according to the LGA structural alignment method [38].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/213

Sequences were collected that had a percentage sequence
identity with the target sequence that was equal or higher
to that of the best template and CLUSTALW was used to
create multiple alignments, first with the sequences found
from the search of the NR databases frozen at the time
(the CASP-set of sequences) and then with the CASP-set
sequences added to those sequences found from the
search of SSea-nr (this set of sequences was called the
CASP-SS-set). The pair-wise alignments between target
and template implied by the multiple sequence alignment
were extracted and compared with the structural alignment. Correctness of the target-template sequence alignments was computed with respect to the LGA structural
alignment of the pair.
