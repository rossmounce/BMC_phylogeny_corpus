Abstract
Background: Given the high prevalence of mother to child infection, the development of a better
understanding of African subtype C HIV-1 transmission and natural evolution is of significant
importance. In this study, we genotypically and phenotypically characterized subtype C viruses
isolated over a 67-month follow-up period from an in utero-infected Zambian infant. Changes in
genotype and phenotype were correlated to alterations of the host humoral immune response.
Results: A comparison of baseline maternal and infant samples indicated that the infant sequences
are monophyletic and contain a fraction of the diversity observed in the mother. This finding
suggests that selective transmission occurred from mother to child. Peaks in infant HIV-1 Env
genetic diversity and divergence were noted at 48 months, but were not correlated with changes
in co-receptor usage or syncytia phenotype. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an accumulation of
mutations over time, as well as the reappearance of ancestral lineages. In the infant C2-V4 region
of Env, neither the median number of putative N-glycosylation sites or median sequence length
showed consistent increases over time. The infant possessed neutralizing antibodies at birth, but
these decreased in effectiveness or quantity with time. De novo humoral responses were detected
in the child after 12 months, and corresponded with an increase in Env diversity.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a correlation between HIV-1 Env evolution and the humoral
immune response. There was an increase in genetic diversification in the infant viral sequences after
12 months, which coincided with increases in neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, episodes of
viral growth and successive immune reactions in the first 5–6 years were observed in this slow
progressor infant with delayed onset of AIDS. Whether this pattern is typical of slow progressing
subtype C HIV-1 infected infant needs to be further substantiated.

Background
Subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
accounts for over 56% of HIV-1 infections [1-3]. Globally,
HIV-1 infection is one of the leading causes of childhood
morbidity and mortality. HIV-1 infected children account
for 20% of all HIV-1 related deaths; 7% of individuals living with HIV-1 infection, and 16% of new HIV-1 infections annually [4]. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 subtype C
is responsible for approximately 50% of infections and a
significant number of infections are in infants and children. Transmission of HIV-1 from infected mothers to
their infants is the primary mode of HIV-1 infection in
children and can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postnatally through breast milk. The use of antiretroviral regimens has successfully reduced the rate of HIV-1 infection
in infants in the developed world to approximately 1%;
nevertheless, such regimens have only recently become
available in many of the developing nations where HIV-1
mother to child transmission (MTCT) is most significant
[5].
HIV-1 MTCT is complex, and its determinants are not
completely understood. Several factors, including high
maternal viral load, maternal env gene homogeneity, and
rapid viral replication kinetics, have been correlated with
perinatal HIV-1 transmission [6-8]. In addition, advanced
maternal disease status, lack of drug therapy, and lack of
breast-feeding alternatives contribute to increased MTCT
[9]. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the
transmission of minor [9-12], major [9,11], and multiple
[9,13,14] HIV-1 genotypes from mother to infant. Our
understanding of perinatal transmission and disease progression in infants is mainly derived from studies of subtype B infected individuals. The applicability of such
findings to other subtypes remains to be substantiated.
The natural history of subtype C HIV-1 infection has not
been extensively studied in children. It is known that
infant disease survival times are considerably shorter than
those of HIV-infected adults, and that without treatment,
most HIV-1 infected African children die before their third
birthday [15]. Given the expanding distribution of subtype C infections, a complete understanding of virus
transmission and natural evolution is increasingly important.
HIV-1 transmission is, in part, a function of the receptor
binding by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) that mediates
virus-cell fusion. Alteration of Env has been linked to
expanded host range, alternative co-receptor usage and in
vitro syncytium induction and associated with viral pathogenesis and disease progression [16-25]. Accumulating
evidence suggests that subtype C Env displays biological
properties, such as near-exclusive CCR-5 utilization, that
distinguish it from other subtypes. In addition, the sub-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/67

type C Env glycoprotein, third variable region (V3) is
more conserved than the previously defined "constant"
regions [26,27]. Whether differences in cellular tropism,
transmission and pathogenetic outcome observed
between subtype C and other subtypes correlate with the
Env glycoprotein biological or genetic properties need to
be examined. In addition, whether there exist differences
in Env evolution in infected children based on viral subtype, remains to be determined. Recently it has been suggested that particular changes in env in Zambian adults
correlated with heterosexual transmission. Viruses with
shorter Env length, and fewer putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) were suggested to be more susceptible
to neutralizing antibodies, yet more efficient at transmission [28]. Similar correlates have not been reported for
transmission to children.
In the present study, we investigated the longitudinal variation of the viruses in a subtype C HIV-1 infected Zambian mother/infant pair (MIP 1157). This pair was
antiretroviral therapy naïve over a six-year follow-up
period. The extended follow-up enabled us to examine the
interplay between humoral immune selection and virus
evolution. We describe changes in the infant Env C2-V4
region over the follow-up period, and correlate these
changes with alterations in viral phenotype and host
humoral immune response. Our findings indicate that
genetic diversification in the infant Env gene increased
after 12 months, and is correlated with increases in neutralizing antibody titers.

Results
HIV-1 infected mother-infant pair
We characterized HIV-1 transmission and longitudinal
evolution of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein in a Zambian mother and infant pair (MIP 1157) for more than 6
years. The mother and child are anti-retroviral naïve and
remain clinically asymptomatic. Infant 1157 was infected
in utero since HIV-1 sequences were detected by DNA PCR
of infant blood samples collected at birth. The baby was
delivered naturally, healthy and with normal birth weight,
and was breast-fed until 20 months of age. The child
remains clinically asymptomatic throughout the followup study period and his CD4 counts was 658 cells/µl at 6
years old. The child has been evaluated at the study clinic
where blood specimens were collected every 6 months for
the first 24 months and at 12-month intervals thereafter.
The prolonged survival of this infected child is unusual
since most untreated HIV-1 infected African children do
not survive beyond the first three years of life. The
extended follow-up of infant1157 provided us with an
opportunity to investigate correlates of virus transmission
in the Env glycoprotein and to track genetic variation and
evolution of this gene over time.

sion, where a subset of the maternal quasispecies was
passed into the child (Figure 1). As would be expected in
a restricted transmission, genetic variation in the HIV-1
Env gene is lower in infant birth sequences than in maternal sequences from the same timepoint (Table 1). The
mean number of nucleotide substitutions within the
mother's env sequences at birth was 3.2, compared to 1.67
in the infant (Table 1), and the mean number of amino
acid differences was 2 in the mother and 1 in the infant.
These findings from phylogenetic and diversity analyses
indicate that the infant possesses a subset of the maternal
diversity at the time of birth.

MIP1157 viruses use CCR5 as co-receptor and belong to
subtype C
All viral isolates recovered from MIP 1157 replicated efficiently in PBMC and monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDM), but failed to grow in MT-2 and C8166 T-cell
lines. Viral isolates did not induce syncytia in infected
PBMC and MDM. We evaluated viral co-receptor usage in
cell lines that co-express CD4 with a single co-receptor. All
isolates failed to infect CXCR4-expressing CEMx174-GFP
cells, and similarly, none of the viruses grew in cells
expressing only CCR3 (HOS-CD4-CCR3) (data not
shown). In addition, 1157 viruses failed to replicate in
PBMC homozygous for the ∆32 deletion variant of CCR5.
In contrast, cells expressing normal CCR5 and CD4
(GHOST-CD4-CCR5) were readily infected, suggesting
that 1157 HIV-1 isolates primarily use CCR5 as co-receptor (data not shown). This is in agreement with infectivity
assays demonstrating that only primary PBMC and MDM
support viral growth. Phylogenetic analyses clustered all
1157 env sequences with subtype C.
Transmission pattern
Viral env sequences from both the mother and infant at
birth were analyzed to examine the genealogical pattern
of perinatal transmission. Infant birth samples were
monophyletic relative to the mother in all phylogenetic
analyses (Bayesian [BA], maximum likelihood [ML] and
neighbor joining [NJ]). In all cases, phylogenetic trees
support the concept of a restricted pattern of transmis-

Longitudinal variation in env sequences
Given the lack of diversity in Env from the infant birth
sample, and the extended survival of the child in the
absence of antiretroviral therapy, it was of significant
interest to investigate evolution of the Env gene over time.
Since antiretrovirals were unavailable, the primary selective pressures acting on Env from infant 1157 were maintenance of replication and immune surveillance.
Population-level changes in the genetic make-up of the
quasispecies within the infant were followed by measuring genetic divergence and genetic diversity over time.
Genetic divergence measures the number of differences
from each contemporaneous set of sequences relative to
the baseline population, whereas genetic diversity is an
estimate of effective population size based on the average
number of pair-wise differences within each set of contemporaneous sequences. The genetic diversity and
genetic divergence of the infant Env C2-V4 region
increased up to 48 months, but subsequently decreased or
leveled off (Figure 2).

Changes in Env genetic divergence and diversity, and in
particular, the replacement of lineages over time (correlated with the stabilization of diversity and divergence),
become evident when visualized in a phylogenetic tree.
We constructed phylogenetic trees using NJ, ML and BA.
All methods yielded similar results and only the NJ result
is shown. There is an association between time of collection and sequence change (longer branches denote more
changes) as early time point sequences appear on short
branches, scattered at the base of the tree, while later
sequences appear on long branches (Figure 3). Samples
collected at 67 months are grouped into 6 different lineages, three that are closely associated with 48-month
sequences, and three that are associated with sequences
from earlier lineages. These would indicate that viral lineages persist in the infant and reappear at later times, e.g.
some sequences collected at 67 months are closely related
to sequences collected at 12, 18, and 48 months (see
arrows in Figure 3). Alternatively, the virus may be
selected to recreate those previous lineages as the immune
pressure on particular epitopes in Env wanes.

amino acid differences (AA) as median (min-max); number of putative N linked glycosylation sites (PGNS) as median (min-max), and sequence
length in codons (L) as median (min – max).

The temporally dependent lengthening of branches seen
in phylogentic trees from BA, ML and NJ analyses was similar to the idealized shape expected under continual selection. As an estimate of the relative strength of selective
pressure we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous (dN)
to synonymous (dS) changes (dN/dS) for each timepoint.
We observed a high ratio of non-synomymous to synonymous substitutions over time as estimated by ML in PAML
(Figure 4). Estimates of the overall dN/dS ratio in the
infant ranged from 0.42 (i00 m) to 1.36 (i24 m). We next
calculated the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per codon for each contemporaneous
set of sequences to assess how selective pressure was distributed along the region of Env sequenced. Non-synonymous variation was evenly distributed in the mother and
infant throughout the fragment at baseline (Figure 4). As
time progressed, the number of non-synonymous changes
increased in the infant Env (Figure 4), but not in the
mother (data not shown). A comparison across timepoints indicates that non-synonymous variation concentrated on the first portion of the constant region 2 (C2),
the first portion of the constant region 3 (C3), and the terminal portion of the variable loop 4 (V4) (Figure 4). The
overall high values of dN/dS, indicated by the relative
amounts of red and green in the different panels of figure
4, and tree shape (Figure 3) suggest that positive Darwinian selection is playing a strong role in shaping molecular
evolution in these samples.
A recent report suggested that subtype C viruses transmitted between members of Zambian discordant couples
possess envelope glycoproteins that are under-glycosylated, neutralization sensitive and contain short loop
structures [28]. To explore the potential role of specific
sequence characteristics in virus transmission between
mother and child, we compared the sequence length pol-

ymorphism and variation in the number of PNGS for
baseline maternal and infant Env C2-V4 sequences. There
are 15 PNGS in this region of 1157 Env. Maternal and
infant baseline sequences are all of the same length, and
showed little variation in the PNGS (Table 1 and Figure
4). In the mother, there were 4 sequences, out of 26, that
lost a PNGS, and the position at which this site was
ablated was not conserved among any of the four. In the
infant, 6 of 48 sequences lost a single PNGS, but in parallel with the mother, there was no conservation in the position of that loss. Moreover, only one variable PNGS was
shared between the mother and the infant.
A similar evaluation of the C2-V4 length polymorphism
and PNGS alteration was carried out on subsequent infant
samples to assess the longitudinal variation in these two
parameters (Table 1 and Figure 4). Length polymorphism
was only observed in infant sequences where putative
insertions and/or deletions occur in a subset of sequences
at amino-acid positions 106–109 and 166–180. Maternal
sequences remained of constant length, 183 amino acids,
throughout the follow-up. All transmitted sequences in
the infant were initially of the same length (also 183
amino acids). Length polymorphism in the region spanning amino acids 166–180 appeared 6 months postpartum, whereas polymorphism in the region spanning 106–
109 was first observed at 12 months. The longest
sequences, isolated at 48 and 67 months, were 185 amino
acids in length, whereas the shortest sequences, 173
amino acids, were isolated at 29 and 36 months. All infant
PNGS present at baseline remain present in a fraction of
sequences from subsequent timepoints; however, only 3
sites remained fixed over the entire course of infection.
The largest PNGS variation was observed at positions 7,
104, and 177, which oscillate between high and low prevalence (Figure 4, months 24, 36 and 48; position 7). In

addition, there are 2 sites gained, one at position 72 at 6
months, and the other at position 109 at 12 months. Both
of these polymorphisms are low in frequency and both
are adjacent to another PNGS.
Replication Kinetics
In order to determine whether there are differences in the
rates of replication between early and late viral isolates,
the replication kinetics of the infant isolates from 6, 12
and 48-month in primary PBMC were determined by
measuring the accumulation of RT units in supernatant
over time. All the viral isolates displayed similar replication kinetics with a steady increase during the first 3 days
of incubation and peaked by day 3(Figure 5). The RT units
dropped after 3 days and remained relatively stable for the
duration of the experiment (Figure 5). In addition, the
similar replication kinetics of these viral isolates was also
observed in MDM (data not shown).
Neutralization of infant HIV-1 isolates
To determine whether Env evolution correlated with the
development of infant anti- HIV-1 humoral immunity, we
analyzed neutralization of infant 6-month, 12-month and
48-month viral isolates by contemporaneous and noncontemporaneous plasma (Figure 6). The neutralization
of the 6-month viral isolate by baseline infant plasma
(i00) was 68% compared to 90% by baseline maternal
plasma (m00) at the same dilution (1:20), indicating that
only a subset of the maternal neutralizing antibody repertoire was passively transferred to the child. As expected,
the ability of the contemporaneous plasma to neutralize
the 6-month viral isolate (85%) was less than that
achieved by 12, 24, 48 and 67-month plasmas, which
achieved 91%, 95%, 89% and 90% neutralization, respectively (Figure 6A). The increase in neutralization by 6- to
67-month plasma as compared to at birth plasma suggested that de novo humoral immune responses against
early viral genotypes persisted and became progressively
stronger with time (Figure 6A). Evaluation of the contemporaneous plasma neutralization of the 12-month infant
viral isolate indicated a very low level of activity (Figure
6B). Only 15% of the input virus was neutralized by the
infant 12-month plasma at a 1:20 dilution; whereas, the
infant plasma at birth neutralized 43%. This was 3-fold
higher than the contemporaneous infant sera, but lower
than the maternal plasma at delivery suggesting that most
of the neutralizing antibody in the infant during the first
months of life was of maternal origin. Moreover, during
the first 12-month of infection, the level of neutralizing
activity against the 12-month virus was observed to
decrease with time indicating decay of the maternal
humoral component. Thereafter, increasing titers of neutralizing antibody were detected in non-contemporaneous 24, 48, and 67-month plasma, which achieved 60,
66%, and 72% neutralization, respectively (Figure 6B).

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/67

These data suggest the development of effective humoral
immune responses in the infant. This increase in neutralizing humoral immunity may, in part, be responsible for
observed increases in infant viral diversity during the
same period. Evaluation of neutralization of the infant
48-month virus isolate revealed high titer neutralization
from the maternal baseline plasma (84%), but very low
level of neutralization from the infant's plasma at 24 or 48
months (Figure 6C). Nevertheless, the 67-month infant
plasma neutralized 72% of the i48 m virus, suggesting a
delayed but continuing infant immune response against
the diversifying viral population.

Discussion
Longitudinal evolution of HIV-1 subtype C has rarely
been evaluated in infected children. The survival of infant
1157 for more than 6 years post-infection provided us
with an opportunity to track genetic variation and phenotypic evolution in the viral envelope glycoprotein over
that period. In addition, we were able to examine correlations between these viral properties and the humoral
immune response of the child. Detection of HIV-1
sequences in PBMC collected from the child at birth indicated in utero infection. The pattern of genetic variation
shown by phylogenetic analysis at baseline is compatible
with an episode of selective transmission, as reported in
previous studies [9-12,27,29]. In utero infection of infants
has been reported to result in more rapid disease progression [30-32]; however, the extended survival of infant
1157 suggests the route of infection alone is not predictive
of disease progression in subtype C infected children.
HIV-1 has replication and mutation rates that generate
high numbers of progeny and significant genetic variation. The env gene has been calculated to diverge at a rate
of about 1% per year [33]. The patterns of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, even for subtype B viruses, are
ambiguous. Delwart et al. reported several-fold higher
diversity at the early stage versus the late stage of infection
[34]. In contrast, other studies have shown that viral
sequences in env are more homogenous early in infection
and diversify with disease progression and decline in
CD4+ T cell counts [33,35-40]. Here we show that birth
env sequences in the recipient child were highly homogenous, as indicated by env diversity, and were closely
related to, but encompassed only a subset of the contemporary maternal variation. Genetic analysis at multiple
timepoints showed that diversity in env as well as divergence from the initial infecting species increased with
time up to 48 months. This increase in diversity and divergence correlated with parallel increases in non-synonymous changes. Whether such an increase is unique to this
case needs to be further substantiated. Our findings contrast with those from studies of subtype B infected adults
where, in patients infected with viruses that undergo co-

receptor switching, the peak of diversity correlated with
the development of CXCR4 utilization and the peak of
divergence correlated with the maximal prevalence of
CXCR4 utilizing species [33]. These phenomena are not
relevant to 1157 since no alternative co-receptor usage
was detected in either the mother or the child. Although
X4-utilizing subtype C strains have been described [4144], they are unusual, thus pointing to distinct evolutionary pressures on the various subtypes. Since subtype C
infected individuals possess X4-expressing cells, it is likely
that immunological and viral replicative selection in these
individuals do not force or allow subtype C to efficiently
utilize these targets or other constraints make such utilization significantly unfavorable.
Interestingly, we have observed the apparent reappearance of earlier lineages at the 67-month time point, and
this is probably correlated to the decrease in viral genetic
divergence at the same time point. Our observation would
indicate that viral sequences, presumably emerging from
latently infected cells, can reintroduce ancestral lineages
and thus could lead to the decrease in divergence. It is
tempting to speculate that such reintroduction might
coincide with the waning of the immune response to
these 'earlier' viruses in much the same way as antiretroviral therapy interruption often results in repopulation of
the patient with drug-sensitive ancestral strains. Alternatively, the host environment may have altered in such a
fashion that an ancestral variant becomes more viable due
to higher replication fitness and decay of immune selection.
Our sequence analysis also revealed a substantial amount
of variation (mutation, deletion and insertion) in env C3
and V4 regions in infant samples, implying that C3 or V4
domain is a likely target of immunological or replicative
selective pressure during subtype C virus evolution and
disease progression in children. The significance of C3
and V4 variation is currently under investigation. It is
important to recognize that definitions of the constant
and variable domains in Env are derived primarily from
studies of subtype B viruses, and the patterns of sequence
diversity in those isolates may not be reflected in other
subtypes such as subtype C.
Our neutralization assays support the concept that the
humoral immune response developed in parallel with the
evolving HIV-1 envelope sequences and constitutes part
of the selective pressure on the gene [45,46]. The persistence of high level neutralizing antibodies against early
infant viral isolates indicated that the infant immune system is capable of developing and maintaining strong
responses to eliminate the initially transmitted and replicating virus (Figure 6A). It has been shown that neutralization escape mutants with reduced sensitivity to

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/67

autologous sera emerge rapidly in HIV-1 infected adults
[46-48], but patients subsequently developed additional
neutralizing antibodies to the 'escape' viruses after a delay
[49]. The initial effectiveness of the infant sera is likely due
to a significant contribution by maternal antibodies to
neutralization titer. Nevertheless, the child does not
receive the full repertoire of maternal neutralizing antibody since a disparity was observed between the effectiveness of maternal and infant baseline neutralization titers.
This idea is reinforced by the fact that the maternal baseline serum continues to be effective against the infant
viruses for the duration of infection; whereas the ability of
the infant serum to neutralize contemporary viruses is
reduced after the early timepoints. Moreover, differences
in the susceptibility of viral isolates to be neutralized by
antibodies was independent of the replication rates, since
the 6, 12 and 48-month viral isolates replicated with
nearly identical kinetics.
The observed viral diversity increase at 12-months might
coincide with the diminution of maternal antibody effectiveness. However, the increasing titer of antibodies
beyond 12 month implied the development of de novo
infant humoral immune responses against the diversifying population. This response, as might be anticipated, is
always in reaction to the viral alterations, not in anticipation of it. This conclusion is supported by the finding that
despite an apparent failure of the humoral immunity to
control HIV-1 replication through neutralizing antibodies
at 48 months, infant 1157 mounted an effective neutralizing response to that virus at subsequent timepoints (67
month) (Figure 6C) and this coincided with a decrease in
viral diversity (Figure 2). However, the role of cell-mediated immunity in controlling viral replication cannot be
determined for this infant since viable cells were not available.
It has been suggested that a more antigenically diverse
virus population would correlate to a broader immune
reactivity, a slower rate of disease progression [50,51], and
selection of neutralization escape mutants in HIV-1
infected individuals, including long-term non-progressors
[47,52-54]. Our study, even though with only one mother
infant pair, appears to support this hypothesis but further
analysis involving a larger number of patients, including
rapid and slow progressors, followed longitudinally will
be needed to substantiate this observation. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms of humoral
immune escape with a more precise definition of the
regions in Env where such mutations cluster is likely to
impact vaccine design.
It has recently been observed that viruses with shorter V1V4 Env length, and fewer glycans are more susceptible to
neutralizing antibodies, but mediate more efficient trans-

mission in discordant couples [28]. Assuming this concept, one would expect to see a relative lengthening of
Env, and an increase in the number of glycans with time.
Our analysis of MIP 1157 longitudinally, which was
based on C2-V4 sequences, cannot be used for direct comparison for transmission, we did, however, observe
increases in variation at PNGS and in sequence length
over time. The variation in Env over the follow-up period
frequently resulted in the deletion, addition, or relocation
of potential N-glycans, suggesting a role of N-glycans for
immune selection in the HIV-1 evolution. The hot spots
of N-glycan variation were particularly evident in the C2
and C3 regions. Similar changes in potential glycosylation
sites have been hypothesized to modify a "glycan shield"
for evading neutralizing antibodies [48].

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that genetic diversification in the
infant sequences increased after 12 months, and this coincided with increases in neutralizing antibody titers. In
addition, episodes of viral growth and successive immune
reactions in the first 5–6 years were observed in this slow
progressor infant with delayed onset of AIDS. Longitudinal studies such as the one described here underscore the
dynamic and complex interactions of viral populations
and immune responses. Whether this pattern of viral host
interaction is typical of slow progressing infected infant
needs to be further substantiated.

Methods
Patient population and sample collection
The mother-infant pair (MIP) 1157 characterized in this
study was recruited to investigate the routes of transmission of HIV-1. Venous blood was obtained from the
mother before delivery and from the infant within 24
hours of delivery. Follow-up blood specimens were
obtained when the pair returned for visits at 6, 12, 18, 24,
29, 36, 48 and 67-months after delivery. The HIV-1 serological status of the mother was determined by two rapid
assays, Capillus (Cambridge Biotech, Ireland) and Determine (Abbott laboratories, USA), on the initial blood
samples. The positive serological result was confirmed by
immunofluorescence assay (IFA), as previously described
[55]. The status of HIV-1 infection in the infant was determined by performing viral isolation from the infant's
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and by PCR
on DNA isolated on the day of birth.
Viral isolation
HIV-1 was isolated sequentially over a 67-month postdelivery period by standard co-culture procedures. Donor
HIV-1-negative PBMC were purified using Lymphoprep
(Life Technology). The purified lymphocytes were then
propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5 µg/ml of phy-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/67

tohemagglutinin (Sigma) for 40 h before co-culturing
with MIP 1157 PBMC or whole blood at a combined final
concentration of 2 × 106cells /ml. Equal numbers of fresh
uninfected PHA-stimulated PBMC were added to the culture weekly. Virus production was monitored using a
commercial ELISA to measure HIV-1 p24 antigen levels
(Coulter immunology, FL). Virus stocks were prepared
when p24 antigen concentration exceeded 10 ng /ml
(about 7–10 days). Viral isolates were recovered from 6month maternal and 6, 12, 18, 24, 29, and 48-month
infant samples
Biological phenotype
Phenotype, syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytiuminducing (NSI), was determined by infecting MT-2 cells in
a 12-well tissue culture plate (5 × 105 cells / well) with 5
ng of p24 virus stock per well. Cell cultures were observed
daily for syncytia formation, over a course of 10 days. Levels of p24 antigen were determined in supernatants collected on day 2, 4, 7, and 10 post-infection. Virus was
scored as SI if syncytia formation and increasing level of
p24 antigen were observed within the 10-day period, and
as NSI if syncytia failed to form within that time.
Cell tropism
To define the viral tropism, primary monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDM), and MT-2 or C8166 T-cell lines
were infected with the virus stocks using standard methods. Primary monocytes were obtained from gradientpurified PBMC by adherence to plastic culture dishes [56].
Adherent cells were cultured for 7 to 10 days in RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 10 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage, colony-stimulating factor (GIBCO)
to promote differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.
Differentiated macrophages, or T-cell lines, were infected
with 5 to 10 ng of HIV-1 p24 antigen per 5 × 105 cells and
incubated for 4 to 5 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the infected
cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and resuspended in fresh culture medium. Culture
supernatants were removed at 3, 7, and 14 days postinfection and assayed for HIV-1 p24 antigen. A culture
well was considered virus-positive if increasing level of
p24 antigen was observed.
Chemokine co-receptor usage
Determination of co-receptor usage was carried out using
cell lines obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID,
NIH from Dr. Nathaniel Landau that express specific coreceptors (CEMx174-GFP cells [CXCR4], Ghost-CCR5
cells [CCR5] and HOS-CD4-CCR3 cells [CCR3]). PBMC
from an individual homozygous for CCR5 mutation ∆32
were obtained from Dr. James Hoxie (University of Pennsylvania). To test for co-receptor usage, the CCR5-∆32
PBMC and the three co-receptor-specific cell lines were

blood donor. The laboratory isolate 128A was used as a
replication kinetics control. After incubation at 37°C for
6 hours, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and refilled
with fresh medium. All infected cultures were sampled
and supplemented with a 50% volume of fresh culture
medium at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15. Viral replication kinetics in PBMC was determined by measuring RT
units in culture supernatants at day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
and 15-postinfection. Viruses were lysed using 10% Triton
X-100 (1% final concentration) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and RT units was measured using
EnzChek Reverse Transcriptase Assay Kit (Invitrogen,
Eugene, Oregon). The assay was performed in triplicate.

seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml into 24-well culture
plates. The cells were infected with 5 ng /ml of HIV-1 p24.
The infected CEMx174-GFP and Ghost-CCR-5 cells were
observed microscopically on day 2–3 post-infection for
green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Wells exhibiting a count of GFP-expressing cells greater than or equal
to 3-fold the negative control wells were scored as positive. Uninfected control wells produced only one to two
GFP expressing cells per well. HIV-1 strains SF2 and NL43 were used as positive controls for viruses that use
CXCR4, and HIV-1 strain SF128A was used as positive
control for CCR5 utilization. Positive control viruses consistently gave 7-fold, or greater, GFP- expressing cells than
the background control.
Infection of CCR5-∆32 PBMC and HOS-CD4-CCR3 cells
was monitored by measuring HIV-1 p24 antigen production in culture supernatants. HIV-1 p24 was measured at
3 days post-infection for HOS-CD4-CCR3 cells, and at 3,
7 and 10 days post-infection for the CCR5-∆32 PBMC.
Cultures were considered positive for viral growth if more
than 100 pg/ml of p24 was detected.
Viral isolates replication kinetics
Equivalent infectious units, 100 TCID50, of the infant viral
isolates obtained at 6, 12 and 48-month follow up were
added to triplicate wells in a 12-well plate containing 6 ×
106 PHA-stimulated PBMC from a HIV-1 seronegative

Virus neutralization assay
Plasma neutralization activity was determined through
infections of TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program catalogy no. 8129, TZM-bl) as
described in Wei et al (2003) with modifications. TZM-bl
cells stably express high levels of CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4.
The cells contain HIV-1 LTR promoter cassettes that
express luciferase and β-galactosidase in response to stimulation with HIV-1 Tat. TZM-bl cells were plated at a density of 6 × 103/well in 96-well tissue culture plates
(Falcon) and cultured overnight in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS. Test plasma was heat-inactivated at 56°C
for 30 min, spun at 3,000 × g for 5 min and diluted 1:20,
1:100 and 1:500 in DMEM plus 6% FBS. Viral aliquots of
100 TCID50/ml were prepared in DMEM supplemented
with 6% FBS and 80 µg/ml DEAE dextran, to a combined
total volume of 100 µl. The virus aliquots (100 µl) were
combined with 100 µl of the different test plasma dilutions and the mixture was incubated for 1h at 37°C. Following incubation, the virus-plasma mixture was added to
TZM- bl cells and incubated at 37°C for two days. Following two washes with PBS, the level of virus infection was
measured by luciferase activity. Cells were lysed using
Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and the
luciferase activity was measured using a LUMIstar luminometer (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany).
The assay was performed in triplicate. Controls included
cells infected by virus inoculated with medium or normal
human plasma instead of the test plasma. Effective neutralization by the plasma would reduce the level of luciferase versus controls lacking plasma. The luciferase
activity in the control wells without plasma was defined as
100 %, and the neutralization titer of the test plasma was
calculated relative to this value.
Polymerase chain reaction, gene cloning, sequencing and
subtype identification
Genomic DNA was purified from patient PBMC using the
ISOQUICK kit (ORCA Research, Inc.). Primers used for
amplification of the subtype C env gene were designed
based on a reference alignment of all HIV-1 subtypes

obtained from the Los Alamos HIV-1 Sequence Database
http://hiv-web.lanl.gov. Nested PCR, as previously
described [27], was used to amplify a 617 bp fragment
containing the C2-V4 region of the maternal and infant
env gene from samples collected at birth through 67month. The amplified fragments were cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced in both
directions with dideoxy terminators (ABI BigDye Kit).
Sequence alignment and analyses
Nucleotide sequences were translated and the amino acid
sequences aligned using Clustal W, as implemented in
BioEdit (Hall 1999)[57], and further refined manually,
preserving the reading frame.

Bayesian (BA), maximum likelihood (ML), and neighborjoining (NJ) phylogenetic analyses were implemented to:
1) determine subtype affiliation (aligning infant clones to
a reference panel from the HIV database at Los Alamos
National Laboratory http://www.hiv.lanl.gov; 2) assess
the transmission pattern between 1157 mother and infant
(samples collected at birth from the mother and the infant
were evaluated), 3) visualize how viral populations
change with time (all samples collected from mother and
infant were included). Bayesian searches were run in
MrBayes version 3.04 [58] for 5 × 106 generations. Trees
were sampled every 1000 generations. Convergence was
reached after 1.5 × 106, and a majority rule consensus was
built based on the last 3000 trees. ML searches were
implemented in Treefinder [59] using a general timereversible model of nucleotide substitution for each
codon position. NJ analyses were performed in PAUP*
ver4.10b [60], estimating distances by maximum likelihood, after selecting the best fitting model of nucleotide
substitution in Modeltest ver 3.5 [61]. Support for the
nodes in ML and NJ was evaluated by running 1000 pseudoreplicates in bootstrap analyses.

ing a similar mutation rate at each timepoint. Viral
divergence was calculated as the average genetic distance
to the viral population in the infant at birth.
The relative strength of positive selection was evaluated in
a ML framework using PAML ver 3.13. [65]. To estimate
the overall dN/dS for each set of contemporaneous
sequences we implemented the one-rate codon model
described by Yang and Nielsen (1998) [66]. The number
of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
observed per site in the infant Env domains (C2-V4) was
calculated in Datamonkey so as to visualize the distribution of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
along the sequence and to identify regions that accumulate most variation ('hot spots').

Genetic diversity, temporal structure and estimates of
selective strength
Samples were grouped into contemporaneous sets according to the time of collection. Sites with alignment gaps,
corresponding to putative insertions or deletions, were
excluded from comparisons. Variation in the pattern of
genetic diversity for each time-point was explored using
MEGA3, [62] and DNAsp ver 4.06 [63], Datamonkey [64]
and PAML ver 3.13. [65], and the number and location of
putative glycosylation sites (PNGS) were estimated using
N-GlycoSite from the Los Alamos National Laboratory
database http://hiv-web.lanl.gov. Viral diversity and viral
divergence from the initial population were calculated for
each timepoint. Viral diversity estimates were based on π,
the average nucleotide differences between sequences per
site. Changes in viral diversity were used to estimate relative changes in the effective viral population size, assum-
