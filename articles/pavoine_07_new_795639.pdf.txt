Abstract
Background: The development of post-genomic methods has dramatically increased the amount
of qualitative and quantitative data available to understand how ecological complexity is shaped.
Yet, new statistical tools are needed to use these data efficiently. In support of sequence analysis,
diversity indices were developed to take into account both the relative frequencies of alleles and
their genetic divergence. Furthermore, a method for describing inter-population nucleotide
diversity has recently been proposed and named the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA),
but this procedure can only be used with one locus. In order to tackle the problem of measuring
and describing nucleotide diversity with more than one locus, we developed three versions of
multiple DPCoA by using three ordination methods: multiple co-inertia analysis, STATIS, and
multiple factorial analysis.
Results: This combination of methods allows i) testing and describing differences in patterns of
inter-population diversity among loci, and ii) defining the best compromise among loci. These
methods are illustrated by the analysis of both simulated data sets, which include ten loci evolving
under a stepping stone model and a locus evolving under an alternative population structure, and
a real data set focusing on the genetic structure of two nitrogen fixing bacteria, which is influenced
by geographical isolation and host specialization. All programs needed to perform multiple DPCoA
are freely available.
Conclusion: Multiple DPCoA allows the evaluation of the impact of various loci in the
measurement and description of diversity. This method is general enough to handle a large variety
of data sets. It complements existing methods such as the analysis of molecular variance or other
analyses based on linkage disequilibrium measures, and is very useful to study the impact of various
loci on the measurement of diversity.

Background
The exponential increase in sequencing abilities is modifying the way genetic diversity is assessed. For instance,

multilocus sequencing (MLS) now allows the estimation
of genetic relatedness among microorganisms for both
housekeeping genes and accessory genes such as virulence

or symbiotic determinants [1]. Thus, several publications
reported complex MLS schemes studying more than ten
genes located in different genomic regions and involved
in various metabolic pathways. These studies have indicated the influence of various parameters, such as recombination rate [2] or epidemiological traits [3], on the
diversification of bacterial populations. Furthermore,
recent progress in sequencing technologies suggests that
still more and more sequence data will be available to
study questions related to community ecology in the near
future [4]. New statistical methodologies should therefore
be developed to deal with the complexity of data sets that
will be produced. One of the main problems raised by the
increase in sequence information is the assessment of congruence among population structures depicted by different molecular markers [5]. In bacterial lineages, especially
for those in which sex is common, the diversity of each
locus could be shaped by the gain/loss of genes, gene flow
boundaries and specific selective pressures [6]. The problems which can arise from the overall analysis of a MLS
data set in which loci do not share congruent evolutionary
constraints include, among others, misleading inferences
of genetic relatedness and phylogenetic relationships [7]
or overestimation of linkage disequilibrium [8].
Bacterial isolates which are characterized by MLS usually
belong to several genetic groups (i.e. species or populations) which can be defined according to the sampling
strategy or according to more refined methodologies [9].
For each locus of a MLS data set, the different sequence
types recovered are called alleles. In this context, the properties of the data set can be summarized by two sets of
matrices. The first set includes G matrices {F1,..., Fg,..., FG},
in which G is the number of loci. Each of these matrices
contains the frequencies of the different alleles recovered
at a given locus among the populations under study. The
dimensions of these matrices are thus (ρ1, r), ..., (ρg, r), ...,
(ρG, r), in which ρg is the number of alleles observed at
locus g and r is the number of populations delineated. The
second set also includes G matrices called {D1,..., Dg...,
DG}, which contain the pairwise genetic distances
between the alleles observed at locus g. Usually, the information contained within these two sets of matrices are
analyzed independently using respective population
genetic statistics (i.e. diversity indices and differentiation
measures) and phylogenetic methods. Yet, while it is possible to perform analyses over all loci in either a population genetic or a phylogenetic framework, few
methodologies are available to assess the congruence of
the information obtained from different loci. In particular, a comparison of the patterns revealed by differentiation measures among the populations sampled, i.e.
population structure, is a problematic issue.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/156

Multivariate analysis is an interesting methodological way
to approach this problem. For instance, Moazami-Goudarzi and Laloë [5] have proposed a two-step procedure to
test the dissimilarity in population structures revealed by
different microsatellite loci. Although this analysis can be
used to test the similarity of population differentiations
inferred from a set of markers, it can be noted that: i) it can
not be used to describe population structures, and ii)
genetic divergence among alleles are not taken into
account, while these can be quite informative. Consequently, further improvements should be considered
since alternative statistical approaches are available [10].
In this context, the aim of this survey is to propose a new
procedure called multiple double principal coordinate
analyses (mDPCoA). The mDPCoA aims at comparing
inter-population structures provided by the different
markers of a MLS scheme. Firstly, a pattern of population
differences is obtained for each MLS marker using a double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) which is a
recently developed ordination method which takes into
account both the frequency of alleles and their genetic
divergence [11] (see Eckburg et al. [12] and Bik et al. [13]
for applications of this method to the analysis of bacterial
diversity). Secondly, population patterns are compared
using three different methods: the Multiple Co-inertia
Analysis [14], STATIS [15], and the Multiple Factorial
Analysis [16]. Finally, a permutation procedure can be
used to test the pairwise correlation among MLS markers.
These analysis pipelines have been used on either simulated or published MLS data sets to check the accuracy and
the relevance of the procedures. The results obtained illustrate the ability of this methodology to make inferences
on various features of populations under study.

weight of a population is the proportion of individuals
drawn from this population), and B ρg be the diagonal
matrix containing the allele weights for the gth locus (the
weight of an allele is its frequency over all the populations
studied). The matrices of distances must be Euclidean

[20], which is obtained with, for example, either Lingoes
[21] or Cailliez [22] correction.
For a single locus g, the analysis of the among-population
diversity corresponds to a DPCoA, which results in three
main steps:
1. Defining a Euclidean space composed by principal axes
of the distances among the alleles. The coordinates of the
alleles in this space are in Rg such that:

−Qtg Dg Q g = R g R tg , where Q g = I ρg − B ρg 1ρg 1tρ is a prog
jector which proceeds to weighted centering, with I ρg the

ρg × ρg matrix of identity and 1ρg a ρg × 1 vector of units.
That is to say, Qtg Dg Q g is the matrix centered by rows and

size the information provided by the G loci. This definition is done by maximizing

3. Proceeding to the singular value decomposition of the
triplet (Cg, Iµ g , Br), where µg is the number of principal
axes for the alleles of the gth locus. This third step leads to
a set of positive eigenvalues, in a diagonal (νg × νg) matrix
Ψg, and to a base of orthonormal eigenvectors, in a (r × νg)
matrix Vg, defining the new Euclidean space. The eigenvectors constitute the principal axes of the distances
among populations. In this new space, which is the
DPCoA space, the coordinates of the alleles are in Xg =
RgVg, and the coordinates of the populations in Yg = CgVg.
A consideration of the set of all the loci leads thus to G tri-

Our objective being to evaluate the consistency among the
patterns of inter-population diversity provided by each
locus, considering evolutionary distances among alleles,
we had to find a Euclidean space allowing the direct comparison among the individual DPCoA analyses. We evaluated three alternative solutions taken from the K-table
multivariate analysis: the multiple co-inertia analysis
(MCoA) [14], STATIS [15] and the multiple factorial analysis (MFA) [16].

The value πg is a weight attributed to the triplet (Yg, Iν g ,
Br) so as to homogenize the impact of each triplet in the
multiple analysis. We use πg equal to the inverse of the
inertia of the triplet (Yg, Iν g , Br), sum of all its eigenval1

the matrix [v[1]|...|v[k]|...|v[k]]. The individual analyses can
be projected on the MCoA space. In this space, it is possible to compare the coordinates of the populations according to the consensus of the information provided by the
different loci to the coordinates of the populations
obtained from each locus. While V contains the consensual coordinates of the populations, the coordinates at
which the gth locus positions the populations are obtained
−1 t
from L Yg = π g Yg U g . Because Yg = Br Fg X g , the matrix

L X g = π g X g U g positions the alleles of the gth locus, so
that each population is at the centroid of its allelic composition. However, to compare the individual analyses
with the compromise, it is better to Dr-normalize L Yg and

L X g because V is by definition Dr-normalized.

Relationships between the multiple DPCoA and the
measurement of diversity
Consider for the two next paragraphs, only one locus – the
locus g. The DPCoA is centered around a diversity index
called "nucleotide diversity" by Nei and Li [23], or "quadratic entropy" by Rao [24], and which is at the core of the
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) [25-27]:

In the first step of the DPCoA, all the points (i.e. alleles
and populations) are in a space called "common space"
[11]. In this common space, the inertia (i.e. variance) of
the allele points weighted by pi is equal to Hg(pi), the
diversity of the population i, according to locus g. The
inertia of all the allele points weighted by

∑ i=1 µi pi
r

is

equal to HTOTAL, g, the total diversity of the data set.
Finally, the inertia of all the population points weighted
by µ = (µ1,..., µi,..., µr) is equal to HINTER, g, the component
of diversity among populations [11]. At the end of the
DPCoA analysis, all the points are projected in a subspace
which optimizes the representation of the differences
among populations. In this subspace, only HINTER, g is
maintained, which is thus the focus of the analysis: optimally displaying the diversity among populations.
Consequently, the multiple DPCoA allows us to optimize
the description of diversity among populations obtained
with several loci. The first goal of this method is to
describe the differences in population patterns across the
loci, hence studying the congruence among loci. Another
objective may be to erase these differences and provide a
compromise population pattern revealed by the majority
of the loci. The DPCoA-STATIS is advocated for this purpose. Concerning the measurement of diversity, when several loci are considered to measure diversity, the sum or
average of the diversity components over the loci is currently used as a global measure of diversity [see for example [28,29]]. With such processes, the weights given to the
loci for the sum or averaging are uniform. We have just
shown that STATIS provides optimal locus weights for the
calculation of the component of diversity among populations. The great advantage of these multivariate analyses is
that visualization of the differences among loci is possible

Associated tests
We performed both Mantel and Rν tests to evaluate the
significance of the differences in population patterns
among loci. For each locus, distances among populations
are calculated with the inter-population diversity HINTER,
g({µi}:{pi}) according to Nei and Li [23] and Rao [24,27].
We just said that this statistic is at the core of the DPCoA.
As we apply formula (HINTER, g) in a pairwise fashion, the
distance between population i and population j for locus
g is µiµjdpop, g(pi, pj). We choose µiµjdpop, g(pi, pj) and not
simply dpop, g(pi, pj) to take into account differential sample sizes, exactly in the way that we considered them in
ordination procedures. The Mantel test calculates correlations among the raw distance measures, while the Rν test
compares principal coordinates obtained by PCoA. Rν
correlations are always higher than Mantel correlations
because their values lie between 0 and 1, while Mantel
correlation values lie between -1 and 1.
Application to simulated and real data sets
We used the following procedure to test the methodologies presented above based on simulated and real data
sets. First, pairwise correlations among loci by Mantel
and/or Rν tests were assessed to define groups of consistent loci. At this step, atypical loci can be identified. Then
mDPCoA was performed to describe both the compromise population structure and the differences among
groups of loci. Finally, we describe the connections
between the observed structures and ecological, evolutionary or functional data.
Application to a simulated data set
Simulation process
In order to assess the efficiency of the present method,
simulated sequence data sets, which illustrate various
population structures, were obtained assuming linkage
equilibrium among loci. Assuming recombination, the
different markers can indeed have different histories and
thus different population structures. Moreover, if every
marker has an independent history, finding similarities
and differences among their genetic structures would be
more difficult. Using SIMCOAL 2.0 [30] we considered a
one-dimensional stepping stone model with eight populations of constant size [31]. The eight populations
evolved 106 generations after emerging from a single
ancestral population. For each population, 60 individuals
were sampled out of 10000 individuals. In this context,
we simulated DNA sequence evolution of ten loci of 300
base pairs under a Jukes and Cantor model [32] assuming
a mutation rate of 5 × 10-6. The stepping stone model
allows migration between adjacent populations: for

Page 5 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

We applied the mDPCoA approach first on the complete
data set, second on the allele distances only and then taking into account just the allele frequencies. We evaluated
the intensity of inter-population structure by measuring
the AMOVA ϕST parameter [25].
Results
The correlations among locus 11 and the ten other loci are
very low and not significant as expected (Figure 1). Thus,
we correctly identified the atypical locus. These correlations decrease when migration rate decreases. Test statistics based on both the Mantel correlation and the Rν
correlation between the atypical locus and other loci
clearly behave in a similar way, and results are hardly
changed when removing allele frequencies or distances.

Regarding the correlation tests among the 10 loci submitted to the stepping stone model, the inter-population
structure measured by the AMOVA ϕST parameter
increases slightly when the migration rate decreases from
5 × 10-2 to 5 × 10-4 and then increases very quickly (Figure
2). Values of the Mantel correlation, the percent of significant tests according to the Mantel correlation and the percent of significant tests according to the Rν correlation are
three parameters correlated with ϕST, especially when
using both allele frequency and allele divergences. The
raw value of the Rν correlation is steadier. These results
show that a non-significant correlation may be due to
either an absence of genetic structure (e.g. no differentiation among populations) or reliable differences in the
inter-population structures revealed by the different loci.
The graphical analysis completed by ϕST values will help
to reach a conclusion between the two alternatives.
Regarding the mDPCoA, we present below the results of
the DPCoA-MCoA approach, which we expected to provide a description of the difference among the ten first loci

example, at time t, the population 4 can exchange individuals with populations 3 or 5, but not with other populations. We chose the following migration rates: 5 × 10-2, 102, 5 × 10-3, 10-3, 5 × 10-4, 10-4, 5 × 10-5, 10-5, 5 × 10-6. We
also simulated an eleventh locus that reveals a different
population structure. For this locus, we assumed no
migration between odd populations (i.e. populations 1, 3,
5, 7) and even populations (i.e. populations 2, 4, 6, 8) and
a migration rate of 10-3 among odd or even populations,
with other parameters kept unchanged. Such a simulation
resulted in two clades of alleles which are obviously divergent, the first clade being specific to some populations
(e.g. odd ones), the second clade being specific to other
populations (e.g. even ones). Such genetic structure can
be observed in case of either balancing/disruptive selection [e.g. [33]] or horizontal transfer of an outlier allele
[e.g. [7]].

of the Figure 3, only the results for migration rates 10-2,
10-3, 10-4 and 10-5 are shown since intermediate migration
rates revealed intermediate inter-population structure).
Indeed, for migration rates higher than 10-2, where no
inter-population structure was highlighted in the previous
paragraph, the atypical locus takes the first axis of the
compromise analysis, which therefore distinguishes odd
from even populations. With a migration rate of 10-3, the
stepping stone model interacts with the structure provided by locus 11; the 10 first loci with a stepping stone
model take the first axis and locus 11 roughly takes the
second axis. With a migration rate lower than 10-3, the
first two axes of the DPCoA-MCoA only represent the
stepping stone model. Whatever the migration rate, the
projection of the individual loci on the DPCoA-MCoA factorial axes emphasizes locus 11's special status (Figure 3).
This last result is also emphasized by specific results of the
DPCoA-STATIS approach as interstructures. With a migra-

and explicit results but which could also encompass the
features of complex MLS data sets. We chose to focus on
nitrogen fixing bacteria belonging to the genus Sinorhizobium (Rhizobiaceae) associated with the plant genus Medicago (Fabaceae). The data set we chose is a combination
of two data sets fully available online from GenBank and
published in two recent papers [8,34]. The complete sampling procedure is described in the two papers and summarized in an additional file [see Additional file 3]. Based
on the sampling scheme, we delineated six populations
according to geographical origin (France: F, Tunisia Hadjeb: TH, Tunisia Enfidha: TE), the host plant (M. truncatula
or similar symbiotic specificity: T, M. laciniata: L), and the
taxonomical status of bacteria (S. meliloti: mlt, S. medicae:
mdc). Each population will be called hereafter according
to the three above criteria, e.g. THLmlt is the population
sampled in Tunisia at Hadjeb from M. laciniata nodules
which include S. meliloti isolates. S. medicae interacts with
M. truncatula while S. meliloti interacts with both M. laciniata (S. meliloti bv. medicaginis) and M. truncatula (S.
meliloti bv. meliloti) [35,36]. The numbers of individuals
are respectively 46 for FTmdc, 43 for FTmlt, 20 for TETmdc, 24 for TETmlt, 20 for TELmlt, 42 for THTmlt and 20
for THLmlt [see Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7].

Four different intergenic spacers (IGS), IGSNOD,
IGSEXO, IGSGAB, and IGSRKP, distributed on the different replication units of the model strain 1021 of S.
meliloti bv. meliloti (Figure 4) had been sequenced to
characterize each bacterial isolate (DNA extraction and
sequencing procedures are described in an additional file
[see Additional file 3]). It is noteworthy that the IGSNOD
marker is located within the nod gene cluster and that specific alleles at these loci determine the ability of S. meliloti
strains to interact with either M. laciniata or M. truncatula
[37].
For each locus, we selected a model of evolution using the
software PHYML [38] and its R interface provided by ape
[18,19]. This software compares the models by likelihood
ratio tests. When several models were not significantly different according to a χ2 test we selected the model with the
smallest number of parameters. From this procedure, we
selected Felsenstein's model F84 [39,40] for IGSNOD,
IGSEXO, IGSGAB, and Felsenstein's model F81 [40,41] for
IGSRKP. Then, using the ape package, a set of matrices

Location
Location of genetic markers on the genome of Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021. Gene clusters located
nearby each genetic marker are indicated by black boxes. It is
noteworthy that the IGSNOD marker is located near genes
involved in symbiotic specificity (nod genes), symbiotic efficiency (nif/fix genes), secretion (virB gene) and conjugation
(tra genes). IGSRKP and IGSEXO are located near genes involved
in the synthesis of surface polysaccharides, which are also
involved in the symbiotic interaction. IGSGAB is physically close
to genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways.

locus was computed according to these selected models,
and Neighbor-Joining trees with bootstrap values were
obtained from these distance matrices to illustrate the
data sets (Figure 5).
We applied the multiple DPCoA to this data set, and compared the results to those obtained with STRUCTURE
[42,43]. STRUCTURE estimates population structure
using genotype data. The basic hypotheses are linkage
equilibrium within subpopulations (or possibly weak
linkage [44]) and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (if the
organism under study is not haploid).
Results
Mantel and Rν tests demonstrated that the locus IGSNOD
provides a very specific ordination of populations, while
the three other markers IGSRKP, IGSEXO and IGSGAB, were
significantly congruent (Table 1).

With DPCoA-MCoA (Figure 6), the first axis, which
expresses 94% of the diversity among populations, separates the two bacterial species, S. meliloti and S. medicae,
while the second axis, with 6% of the diversity among
populations, distinguishes the impact of the host plants,
M. laciniata and M. truncatula. The DPCoA-STATIS analyTable 1: Pairwise correlations among loci with the complete real

sis reveals a very similar pattern (Figure 7). Consistently,
the STRUCTURE analysis indeed defined two main clusters including respectively S. meliloti and S. medicae, without any trace of admixture between the two species.
However, these results are a compromise with the information provided by IGSRKP, IGSGAB, IGSEXO and IGSNOD.
Although the four markers effectively delineate the two
bacterial species, they express this segregation differently.
The DPCoA-MCoA indeed revealed that the segregation
between S. meliloti and S. medicae is supported by more
than 90% population variation for the three most coherent markers, i.e. IGSRKP, IGSGAB and IGSEXO, while it only
concerns a minor part of the population variation
observed for IGSNOD. The discrimination between the
impact of the two host plants, i.e. M. truncatula and M. laciniata, which appears in axis 2, is the main structure for the
IGSNOD marker. The interstructure obtained by using STATIS (Figure 7A), i.e. the eigenanalysis of the Rν matrix,
illustrated the special status of IGSNOD.
It is noteworthy that based on DPCoA-MCoA, the secondary structure is due to a host-plant effect (e.g. IGSGAB) and/
or a geographical origin effect (e.g. IGSEXO) discriminating
between French and Tunisian populations of S. meliloti.
Interestingly, the effect of geographical distance on the
population structure of S. meliloti is not detected by compromise analyses. Because both STATIS and MFA aim at
pointing out similarities among loci, these approaches
failed at highlighting the secondary structure observed
using DPCoA-MCoA (Figure 7B and Figure 8).
There is a clear relationship between the patterns of population differences and the distribution of allelic diversity
(Figure 6B). For instance, the two bacterial species did not
share any alleles in common, even for the IGSNOD locus.
Furthermore, the populations associated with M. laciniata
did not share any alleles with the populations associated
with M. truncatula for the IGSNOD locus, resulting in three
independent allelic pools belonging respectively to S.
medicae and the two biovars of S. meliloti. Furthermore,
the distance between the IGSNOD alleles associated with
M. laciniata and those associated with M. truncatula is very
high, almost as high as the distance which separates S.
meliloti and S. medicae on IGSEXO. The particular polymorphism pattern observed for IGSNOD might be explained by
both the host-plant selective pressure that acts on nod
genes and the events of horizontal transfer that affect the
nod gene cluster [34].

Neighbor-Joining trees for the representation of the distances among alleles
Neighbor-Joining trees for the representation of the distances among alleles. The alleles belonging to S. medicae isolates are surrounded by a plain-line circle. Only IGSNOD presents alleles found only in S. meliloti bv. meliloti populations and alleles found only in S. meliloti bv. medicaginis. Consequently, for IGSNOD, alleles are also divided according the two biovars of S.
meliloti, by broken-line circles. Bootstrap values higher than 50% are given in boxes. Nodes with bootstrap values higher than
50% are indicated by plain circles and in case of possible ambiguity, a broken line links the node to the bootstrap value. The
interrupted lines have a length of 0.0986 for IGSNOD, 0.1075 for IGSEXO, 0.0456 for IGSGAB and 0.0421 for IGSRKP.

sequence divergences are kept, like in the complete analysis, IGSEXO, IGSGAB, and IGSRKP are significantly correlated
sharing a strong separation between the species S. medicae
and S. meliloti (correlations vary from 0.81 and 0.93
according to Mantel and are superior to 0.999 according
to Rν; significance of correlation tests was assessed according to a 0.05 threshold). Regarding the DPCoA-MCoA factorial maps, the population structure is maintained on
axis 1, which in that case exhibits 96% of the inter-population diversity. IGSNOD stands out by presenting very distinct alleles according to the host plant. On the second
axis, with 4% of the inter-population diversity, the differ-

ences between populations according to host plants are
maintained for IGSGAB as a secondary structure. Yet, the
secondary structures of both IGSRKP and IGSEXO become
hardly interpretable. When only the allele frequencies are
kept, due to the high differentiation between the two species S. medicae and S. meliloti for all the loci when allele
distances are removed, all the pairwise correlations
between loci are significant according to the Mantel statistic (correlations greater than 0.83), and all except IGSEXOIGSNOD (0.61) and IGSRKP-IGSNOD (0.63) correlations
according to the Rν statistic. Regarding the DPCoA-MCoA
factorial maps, the first axis of all the loci represents the

the Rν matrix, and B) the best compromise. Eigenvalue barplots are provided in boxes. In the interstructure (A), the
smaller the angle between two loci, the more similar the
inter-population patterns provided by the two loci.

The conclusions which can be drawn from these analyses
of the effects of distances and frequencies on the interpopulation diversity are as follows. In all of the analyses,
the most peculiar locus remains IGSNOD. The high separation of populations according to their host plant is due to
distinct and distant alleles for IGSNOD and allele distances
for IGSGAB. The differences among IGSGAB, IGSRKP, and
IGSEXO are due to differentiation patterns among S.
meliloti populations. Finally, the distinction between the
French and the Tunisian populations mostly relies on
allele frequency data.

Discussion
The MDPCoA approach provides a useful tool for: (i)
identifying atypical loci by both tests and factorial maps;
(ii) describing differences in population structures
between groups of congruent loci by factorial maps; (iii)
including evolutionary distances among alleles, which is
seldom done.
Missing data
In all the analyses we performed, the weight of a population is the number of individuals sampled from this population divided by the total number of individuals
sampled. Given that we consider several loci, this definition of the weights supposes that we have identified the
allelic composition of each individual for all loci. In case

of missing allelic data, i.e. if the allelic content of some
individuals is missing for one or several loci, one should
define different weight systems depending on the loci.
According to the gth locus, the weight of population i is the
number of characterized individuals from population i
divided by the total number of characterized individuals.
This would lead to G different systems of weights, i.e. one
per locus. Unfortunately, neither STATIS nor the MCoA
nor the MFA can support different population weights.
Consequently, one will have to assume a similar set of
population weights over loci although some data are
missing. To overcome this problem, it may be assumed
that the weight of a population is the number of individuals sampled from this population divided by the total
number of individuals sampled, whether or not the allelic
information for all the loci and for all the individuals is
available.

Effects of frequencies and distances
The effect of frequencies and distances comprises two
components: the effect due to sampling error and the
effect due to population structure. The effects of sampling
error on the component of nucleotide diversity within
and between populations have been studied elsewhere
[23,46], and might be the object of further research in the
context of the mDPCoA.

Another case of usual missing data is the lack of nucleotide divergence among alleles. In that case, we suggest
fixing the distance among any two different alleles equal
to 1, so that the DPCoA is equal to the non-symmetric correspondence analysis [11,45]. Furthermore, the inertia of
the allelic points per population in the DPCoA "common
space" is then equal to the gene diversity index H, introduced by Nei [28], and the inertia of the population
points is equal to the gene diversity among populations
defined by Nei [28] in its decomposition of gene diversity.

The relative effects of frequencies and distances on the
analysis of population structure depend on the degree of
differentiation among the populations under study. In
case of low differentiation, population structure is usually
due to variations in allelic frequencies. For instance, differences among French and Tunisian populations of S.
meliloti that are highlighted by IGSEXO, IGSGAB and IGSRKP
are due to allelic frequencies. Conversely, as the number
of alleles shared by the different population decreases,
taking into account the information provided by sequence

The inertia among population points in the best compromise plot and DPCoA-STATIS is a measure of gene diversity among populations averaged over the G loci, where
the weights given to the loci are not simply uniform but
set optimal for synthesizing what is common to the loci.
This process gives less weight to outliers and reflects the
distances among populations as they are seen by the
majority of the loci.

divergence is crucial to efficiently describe their relationships. For instance, the specific inter-population structure
of IGSNOD is mainly due to sequence divergence.
Pertinence of the correlation tests
Both correlation tests (Mantel and Rν) can be non-significant for two reasons: either because of an absence of population structure or because the two loci compared reveal
different population structures. As highlighted in a previous section, the estimated ϕST parameter and the factorial
maps obtained by one of the three versions of the mDPCoA (with MCoA, STATIS or the MFA), can be used to
choose among the two alternatives. Concerning the relative interest of the two tests, the Rν test is revealed to be
more powerful when applied to our simulated data set, so
we advocate its use.
Relative advantages and disadvantages of the three
proposed analyses – choice of a method
The three methods are alike in their procedure because
they are all based on a compromise. However, they differ
in the way the compromise is obtained. With the MCoA,
the compromise is built during the definition of the factorial axes. It maximizes the average correlation among the
individual analyses and the compromise. With STATIS,
the compromise is obtained before going to the core of
the multivariate ordination analysis. Here, the compromise maximizes the correlations among the patterns of
inter-population diversity provided by the loci. With the

MFA, the pieces of information given by the loci are simply added to each other by creating a large table juxtaposing the information on the loci. This last method is the
simplest, where pieces of information are simply added.
On the other hand, MCoA and STATIS first compare the
patterns of inter-population diversity provided by the loci,
either for visualizing in a single space the differences
among loci or for erasing these differences, and find a best
compromise over the loci, respectively.
Unfortunately, the representation of the differences
among loci with STATIS is not optimal [15] because STATIS focuses on similarities instead of dissimilarities
among loci. Consequently, in comparison to alternative
methods, it theoretically lacks an optimal explicability,
and an efficient description of the differences in population patterns among loci. The description of the differences among population patterns is thus more precise
using MCoA and MFA. Conversely, the main advantage of
STATIS over other methods is that it provides a simpler
compromise pattern.
The choice among the three methods therefore depends
on the goal of the underlying study. If the objective is to
obtain the best compromise over the loci, then we advocate the use of DPCOA with STATIS. However, if the
objective is to obtain a detailed comparison among the
population patterns provided by the G loci, then we
encourage the use of the DPCoA with the MCoA.

Complementarity between mDPCoA and other analyses
The mDPCoA could be associated with other tools to
study population structure, including the AMOVA, which
forms the basis of the DPCoA, Linkage Disequilibrium
(LD) statistics, and also recent approaches such as STRUCTURE or CLONAL FRAME.

The AMOVA averages molecular variability over loci to
test the existence of differences between populations or
groups of populations in terms of both allele frequencies
and nucleotide distances among alleles. The Mantel and
Rv statistics associated with the mDPCoA use the same
information to test the differences between the inter-population structures inferred by several loci.
Both linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures and the mDPCoA aim at assessing whether there is a significant association among the polymorphism patterns observed for
different molecular markers. However, LD approaches
and mDPCoA differ in several ways. Without discrepancies among the population structures, mDPCoA would
fail to detect that different loci evolve independently, even
if these are in linkage equilibrium at the population scale.
Conversely, in the Sinorhizobium spp. data set, the mDPCoA detected that IGSNOD pattern of population differences was drastically different from the ones obtained
with IGSRKP, IGSGAB and IGSEXO, suggesting a horizontal
gene transfer of nod genes between S. meliloti bv. meliloti
and S. medicae. Because of the differentiation between S.
meliloti and S. medicae, LD measures would have failed to
detect such a transfer event. Linkage disequilibrium measures and mDPCoA therefore appear as complementary
tools to study the influence of sex during the evolution of
bacterial lineages.
The mDPCoA is above all a descriptive method, as it does
not rely on any assumptions about models of evolution
such as linkage equilibrium or selective neutrality. Nevertheless, this analysis pipeline can raise questions that will
be investigated using complementary analyses. Thus,
demonstrating differences among population structures
obtained from different loci raised questions regarding
the definition of population boundaries, or the genealogy
of both genes and individuals. A consensus population
structure could be inferred without any a priori knowledge
using STRUCTURE, and its efficiency can be confirmed
and illustrated using the correlation tests and the graphical outputs of the mDPCoA. CLONAL FRAME is an
explanatory method, estimating clonal relationships and
looking for key recombination events with a view of finding the mechanisms implied in microevolution [47]. It
can be used to gain insights into the history of an atypical
locus. Finally, the detection of selection traces and mechanistic experiments can be of great interest to explain
mDPCoA results. These different approaches thus com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/156

plement the mDPCoA, and conversely, the mDPCoA
complements these approaches. For instance, both
STRUCTURE and CLONAL FRAME imply working on
MLS analyses, and the choice of the finite set of loci used
in these analyses may be crucial. Each method can be
improved by looking at the results returned by the two
others. A joint interpretation of the results of the alternative methods may thus allow a better interpretation of the
results and lead to a deeper analysis of particular loci for a
better understanding of the data.

Conclusion
All three methods proposed can be used for a better
description of inter-population genetic diversity measured over more than one locus. They imply a new reflection on the role of means in measures of diversity: can we
work on average information over loci, or do we first need
to examine the differences among the patterns of diversity
given by the loci? Sometimes, the differences among loci
are so high that the compromise obtained by the multivariate analyses will be unstable and the use of averaged
information can hamper interpretation. This issue is
related to the question raised decades ago: can we build a
unique, very synthetic measure of biodiversity, or do we
have to make up our mind to define several conflicting
measures? As it is based on multivariate analyses, the multiple DPCoA in its three forms can be used to analyze large
data sets. It allows a comparison of genetic diversity measured on various loci. It complements existing tools such as
AMOVA and linkage disequilibrium measures. It is used
here on molecular data because it is in genetics the question of congruence among markers was raised several
years ago. We illustrated this procedure using a limited
but complex sequence database. The method will have to
be tested on other data sets, yet the results are already very
promising. Moreover, mDPCoA is potentially more general than we presented here since it can be extended to any
data set where pairs of matrices comprise a matrix with
abundance or presence/absence and a matrix of dissimilarities. Further applications in ecology could thus be considered, such as the description of inter-community
diversity based on both genotypic and phenotypic features.
