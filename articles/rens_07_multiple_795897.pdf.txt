Echidna sexshares study of the karyotypethethe short-beaked echidna shows that monotremes appear to have a unique XY sex chromosome

Abstract
Background: Sex-determining systems have evolved independently in vertebrates. Placental
mammals and marsupials have an XY system, birds have a ZW system. Reptiles and amphibians have
different systems, including temperature-dependent sex determination, and XY and ZW systems
that differ in origin from birds and placental mammals. Monotremes diverged early in mammalian
evolution, just after the mammalian clade diverged from the sauropsid clade. Our previous studies
showed that male platypus has five X and five Y chromosomes, no SRY, and DMRT1 on an X
chromosome. In order to investigate monotreme sex chromosome evolution, we performed a
comparative study of platypus and echidna by chromosome painting and comparative gene mapping.
Results: Chromosome painting reveals a meiotic chain of nine sex chromosomes in the male
echidna and establishes their order in the chain. Two of those differ from those in the platypus,
three of the platypus sex chromosomes differ from those of the echidna and the order of several
chromosomes is rearranged. Comparative gene mapping shows that, in addition to bird autosome
regions, regions of bird Z chromosomes are homologous to regions in four platypus X
chromosomes, that is, X1, X2, X3, X5, and in chromosome Y1.
Conclusion: Monotreme sex chromosomes are easiest to explain on the hypothesis that
autosomes were added sequentially to the translocation chain, with the final additions after
platypus and echidna divergence. Genome sequencing and contig anchoring show no homology yet
between platypus and therian Xs; thus, monotremes have a unique XY sex chromosome system
that shares some homology with the avian Z.

Background

no platypus homologue of the human X-borne XIST in platypus [12] and marsupials [13]. In addition, platypus Ensembl
release 44 and separate mapping work (F Veyrunes, personal
communication) show an absence of human X-linked orthologues from platypus X- chromosomes, contradicting original
localizations using radioactive fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with heterologous cDNA probes [14-18]. It follows that SRY and the therian XY sex determining system
have evolved between 166 and 148 MYA after the divergence
of monotremes and before the divergence of marsupials,
which is being explored further (F Veyrunes, personal
communication).

Monotreme mammals are receiving increasing attention in
genomic research, with interests varying from karyotype evolution and gene mapping, to comparative sequencing. This
should not come as a surprise, as monotremes (mammalian
Subclass Prototheria) occupy a unique branch at the base of
the mammalian phylogenetic tree, and serve as an evolutionary outgroup for marsupial and eutherian species (that
together comprise Subclass Theria). The time of divergence of
Prototheria and Theria is estimated to be in the Early Jurassic
(166 million years ago (MYA)), while marsupials and eutherians diverged in the Late Jurassic (148 MYA) [1]. Five extant
monotreme species are recognized; platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and three long-beaked echidnas (Zaglossus bruneiji,
Zaglossus attenboroughi, Zaglossus bartoni). Zaglossus
bartoni is divided into three subspecies Z. b. smeenki, Z. b.
diamondi, and Z. b. clunius [2].
A full karyotype characterization is essential for genomic
research in any species. It is particularly important for
monotremes because of their exceptional sex chromosome
complement. The inclusion of a set of tiny chromosomes was
recognized early and thought to be a reptilian feature [3], but
this suggestion was later refuted [4]. A surprise was the discovery of several unpaired chromosomes [5]. A final identification and description of the platypus unpaired
chromosomes was achieved only recently by our chromosome
painting studies [6,7]. The 21 autosome pairs were assigned
by chromosome paints. Ten paints identified ten unpaired
mitotic chromosomes as well as the ten members of the meiotic chain and the homologous regions between them. Five
paints identified X chromosomes present in single copy in
males but two copies in females, and five paints identified Y
chromosomes that were present only in males. It was, therefore, concluded that the ten male unpaired chromosomes
consisted of five X and five Y sex chromosomes. The ten sex
chromosomes form a multivalent chain at meiosis held
together by chiasmata within homologous pairing regions.
Alternate segregation of these chromosomes into
X1X2X3X4X5 and Y1Y2Y3Y4Y5 sperm was proposed and must
be very efficient as shown by meiotic analysis of spermatids
and sperm using the paint probes [6]. Remarkably, X5 shows
some homology with the chicken Z, as demonstrated by its
inclusion of the DMRT-1, DMRT-2 and DMRT-3 orthologues
[6,8]. Chicken Z is largely homologous to parts of human
chromosomes 5 and 9, with some genes represented on 8 and
18 [9]. A region containing ATRX, RBMX and genes flanking
XIST, present on Xq in human and other therians, maps to
chromosome 6 in platypus [10], as does SOX3, the gene from
which the sex-determining SRY gene evolved (M Wallis, personal communication), and this is consistent with the absence
of a platypus homologue of the Y-linked SRY. Other genes
involved in the eutherian sex determining pathway have
recently been mapped to platypus autosomes, so do not qualify as candidate primary sex determining genes [11]. There is

To provide new clues to the organization, function and evolution of the platypus multiple sex chromosomes, we defined
the sex chromosomes of the distantly related short-beaked
echidna, T. aculeatus, and established the sex chromosome
order in the echidna multivalent chain. Our genome-wide
comparison using chromosome painting between echidna
and platypus (called Tac (for T. aculeatus) and Oan (for O.
anatinus) in this report) showed, surprisingly, that one member of the Oan chain is replaced by an autosome in Tac, and
the X homologous to Oan X5 occupies a central position in the
Tac chain rather than a position at the end as seen in Oan. To
investigate the participation of the ancestral avian Z in the
evolution of the monotreme sex chromosome system and to
map genes to the members of the sex chromosomes, we also
localized the platypus homologues of genes on chicken autosomes and Z. We conclude that the ancestral monotreme sex
chromosome system bears considerable homology to the sex
chromosomes of birds.

Results
Characterization of the short-beaked echidna
karyotype
The male short-beaked echidna has 63 chromosomes and the
female 64 [5]. We characterized and classified the male karyotype by flow cytometric analysis, flow sorting, and chromosome painting. The chromosomes produced 36 peaks in the
flow karyotype (Figure 1); 17 peaks represent single chromosome pairs and 4 peaks represent 2 chromosome pairs each.
The homologues of chromosomes 1, 6, 16, and 27 (which are
frequently heteromorphic) each sort in two different peaks.
The nine remaining peaks represent single chromosomes,
which we show to be the nine unpaired sex-chromosomes
that constitute the meiotic chain in the male echidna. Thus,
the male echidna has 27 autosome pairs and 9 sex
chromosomes.
The chromosome paints were used to identify autosome pairs
and sex chromosomes in male and female echidnas. Figure 2
shows a G-banded karyotype of male (upper) and female
(lower) echidna chromosomes arranged in size and identified
by the chromosome painting results (see below). The upper
part of both the male and female karyotypes show 27 pairs of

autosomes that should form bivalents at meiosis, and the
lower parts show the nine unpaired sex-chromosomes in
male and five paired sex-chromosomes in female. The paired
autosomes can be divided into a group that contains submetacentric chromosomes (chromosomes 1 to 8) and a group of
smaller metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes.
Chromosomes 3, 6 and X5 contain nucleolus organizer
regions (Figure 2) determined by Ag-NOR (nucleolar organizing region) staining and by FISH using a probe specific for
28S rDNA (Figure 3).
Special attention was given to chromosome pair 27, as it
shows complete homology with platypus X4 and partial homology with platypus Y3 and Y4 (see below), and might, therefore, be an unrecognized sex chromosome. However, both the
paints, produced from the two peaks representing the heteromorphic chromosome pair 27, painted both chromosomes 27
totally in both male and female metaphases (Figure 4a).
Based on this analysis, the pair was defined as an autosome
pair and this was confirmed by analysis of meiotic preparations, which revealed that 27 is not part of the chain.
Chromosome painting in echidna reveals non-specific signals
that are present on more than one chromosome pair, indicated by coloured bars next to chromosomes in Figure 2. For
instance, when the paint specific for chromosome 1 was
hybridized to metaphases, stronger signals were visible on the
region indicated on chromosome 1 and a region on chromosome 2. A hybridized chromosome 4 paint gave strong signals
on chromosomes 4, 7, and 16 (and others as indicated),

weaker signals on X1 and Y1, and even weaker signals on chromosomes 1 and 2.
The chromosome specificity of these regions was apparent
using paints produced by microdissection of these regions.
Hybridization to these regions (which hamper identification
of chromosomes, and especially pairing regions of the sex
chromosomes) was not blocked by pre-hybridization with
echidna Cot-1 DNA. To facilitate chromosome identification,
an image enhancement procedure was developed to remove
these non-specific signals from the image [19]. Molecular
characterization of these regions is not considered in this
paper.

Sex chromosomes in the echidna male
The nine chromosome paints that identified unpaired chromosomes (denoted by X1, Y1, X2, Y2, and so on) were used to
identify the sex chromosomes of the echidna and predict their
order in the meiotic chain. Paint X1 hybridized to the whole of
chromosome X1 and the long arm of Y1 (Figure 4b), whereas
paint Y1 hybridizes to the single chromosome Y1 and the short
arm of X1 (Figure 4c). X1 is known to be the first chromosome
in the chain [20], and its short arm pairs with the
acrocentricY1q (second chromosome). The paint X2 shows a
complete coverage of a single chromosome X2 as well as signals on the pairing regions on Y1p and Y2p (Figure 4d). This
result shows that X2 is the third and Y2 the fourth in the chain.
Paint Y2 covers Y2 and paints the pairing regions on X2 and X3
(Figure 4e). Paint X3 paints the entire chromosome X3 as well
as the long arm of Y2 (Figure 4f), so is the fifth chromosome

Figure 2 karyotype of T. aculeatus
G-banded (see previous page)
G-banded karyotype of T. aculeatus. Top: the male has 27 chromosome pairs and 9 unpaired chromosomes. Three kinds of information are given next to
the chromosomes. Chromosomes 3, 6, and X5 contain the NOR regions. Certain chromosomes have specific regions represented by colored bars on the
left of the chromosomes, 'w' means that the region is relatively under-represented (see text). The numbers on the right refer to platypus chromosome
paints that hybridized to the indicated regions. Middle: the pairing regions of the nine sex chromosomes determined by chromosome painting on mitotic
preparations. Those of Y3 with X3 could not be determined in mitotic metaphases. Bottom: G-banded female karyotype of T. aculeatus. The female has 32
chromosome pairs and no unpaired chromosomes.

in the chain. The order of the last four elements is less certain
at this stage. Paint Y3 covers the tiny chromosome Y3 with no
signal denoting pairing regions on X3 and X4 (Figure 4g).
Paint X4 hybridized to chromosome X4 and to Y3 and the heterochromatic centromeric regions of chromosome 22 or 23
(Figure 4h). Y3 is also painted by chromosome paints 25 and
26, suggesting that it contains shared large non-specific
sequences. Paint Y4 hybridized to chromosome Y4 and to X5 p
(Figure 4i). Paint X5 paints the whole X5 and the long arm of
Y4 (Figure 4j); it also showed hybridization to a heterochromatic centromeric region on an autosome.

Sex chromosomes in the echidna female
The same set of nine sex chromosome paints was hybridized
to female metaphases to verify which element is an X-chromosome (defined as having one copy in the male and two copies in the female) and which element is a Y-chromosome (one
copy in the male and absent in the female). Figure 5 shows
some examples of these hybridizations. For instance, chromosome paint Y2 hybridized to the pairing regions of X2 and
X3, but identified no copy of the male-specificY2 (Figure 5b).

The results show that indeed X1-X5 are X chromosomes and
Y1-Y4 are Y chromosomes. These results also clarified the
order of the alternating X and Y chromosomes.
Homologous regions between adjacent X and Y chromosomes
are, therefore, demonstrated for all members of the chain of
nine except between the small X3, Y3 and X4. These pairing
regions all include the distal end of one chromosome arm and
do not cross the centromere of the unpaired chromosome.
The order of the first five chromosomes of the chain can be
deduced from the homology relationships as X1Y1X2Y2X3.
However, the order of the last two X and two Y chromosomes
is uncertain by chromosome painting on echidna mitoses, as
the pairing regions are too small to detect. However, the
results of cross-species painting (see below) and our analyses
of chromosome painting of meiotic chains (Figure 5e–g)
revealed that X4 is the seventh element in the chain (Figure
5g), confirming the order shown in Figure 2.

Genome wide comparison between echidna and
platypus
Cross-species chromosome painting was used to define chromosome regions conserved between Oan and Tac and to
identify rearrangements that differentiate the karyotypes of
the two species. Figures 2a and 6 show the Oan and Tac homology maps, with the homologous regions indicated on the
right of each chromosome.

Cross-species painting showed that entire Oan chromosomes
1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 19 are conserved in the Tac karyotype
as chromosomes 1, 4, 3, 10, 11, 14, 19, and 22, respectively
(Figures 2a, 6 and 7b). Oan chromosomes 15 and 20 are conserved on either Tac 25 or 26, which are similar in size and
could not be separated by flow sorting.
Several platypus chromosomes (Oan 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13)
paint two echidna chromosomes or chromosome arms, representing a centric fusion in the platypus lineage, or a fission in
the echidna lineage (Figures 2a and 7a,d). Vice versa, there
are also four echidna chromosomes (Tac 2, 7, 9, 12) each of
whose arms are homologous to two platypus chromosomes,
implying either fissions in the platypus lineage or fusions in
the echidna lineage (Figures 6 and 7c). It is not possible to distinguish centric fusions from centric fissions without reference to outgroup species.

Male Tac chromosome identification. (a) Tac 27 is a pair. (b) Paint X1 identifies X1 and Y1q. (c) Paint Y1 covers chromosome Y1 and X1p. (d) Paint X2
identifies X2 and the region of homology on Y1 and Y2. (e) Paint Y2 identifies Y2 and the region of homology on X2 and X3. (f) Paint X3 covers X3 and the

arrow head points to a heterochromatic centromeric region on an autosome.

Tac homologous regions for Oan 18, 17p and 21 could not be
determined, probably because these regions are homologous
to Tac chromosomes with large amounts of 'non-chromosome-specific' repetitive DNA (see first section of results).
Similarly, homologous regions were not determined for short
regions on Tac 3p, 4p, 5p, 6p, 8p, 13p, 15q, 16p, 17q, 18, 20,
21, 23, 24p and the large regions on 1q and 2q. These blocks
correspond to specific Tac regions identified by paints made
from the equivalent regions by microdissection (depicted in
different colors at the left in Figure 2 top).
The NOR-bearing regions are not on homologous chromosomes in the platypus and echidna. In platypus, Oan 6 contains the NOR region; this chromosome is homologous to Tac
16. In echidna, Tac chromosomes 3, 6, and X5 are the NOR
bearing chromosomes (Figure 3); these chromosomes are
homologous to Oan 5, 7, and 12p.

Comparison of platypus and echidna sex chromosomes
Cross-species painting with Oan and Tac X-Y probes shows
that Oan X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3 are homologous to Tac X1, Y1, X2,
Y2, and X3, respectively (Figures 8a–d and 9a–c), but one X
chromosome in each and homologous regions of the flanking
Y chromosomes are non-homologous. Reciprocal chromosome painting shows that Oan X5 and Tac X4 are homologous.
The Oan X5 paint hybridized to Tac X4 (Figure 8h), the Tac X4
paint hybridized to Oan X5 (Figure 9f); neither hybridization
detected pairing regions in adjacent Y chromosomes. Confirmation that the large Tac X4 chromosome is the genetic
homologue of the Oan X5 is provided by the assignment of the
DMRT1 gene complex to Tac X4q (Figure 10a).
An important result was that Oan Y3 and X4 paints hybridized
to a Tac autosome, and that Tac X5 paint hybridized to an Oan
autosome. Oan paint X4 hybridized to the whole Tac 27 (Figure 8f). Oan paint Y3 hybridized to a small region of Tac chromosome 27 (Figure 8e), confirmed as an autosome (Figure
4a). Oan paint Y4 hybridized to Tac Y4p and the distal end of
Tac X4p (Figure 8g). Reciprocally, Tac X5 paint hybridized to
platypus chromosome 12p (Figure 9d). Tac paint Y4 hybridized to four regions: the two homologues Oan 12p, Oan X5p
and Oan Y4p and Tac 27 identified Oan Y3, Oan X4, and Oan
Y4q (Figure 9e). Many metaphases were observed to confirm
these signals. We conclude that Tac Y4q and X5 represent
autosomes in platypus and parts of Oan Y3, X4 and Y4q are
homologous to autosomal regions in echidna.
In the echidna, there are only four Y chromosomes, compared
to five in the platypus, suggesting that the small Y5 in platypus

has been completely lost in the echidna lineage [21]. A
surprising result, therefore, was the hybridization of the Oan
Y5 paint to Tac Y3, a strong indication that Oan Y5 is
represented in the echidna chromosome chain of nine (Figure
8i). No reliable signals on chromosomes other than Tac Y3
were observed. Attempts to hybridize the chromosome paint
of Tac Y3 paint onto Oan male metaphases produced no reliable signal.

Mapping chicken-human homologous genes
In order to test the hypothesis that the bird Z chromosome is
represented in the monotreme sex chromosome chain, platypus homologues of nineteen chicken-Z genes (together with
chicken 2, 3, and 13 genes) were mapped to platypus chromosomes by two independent methods, PCR amplification of
chromosome specific DNA and FISH localization of platypus
bacterial artificial chromosome (BACs). Gene mapping
results are summarized in Figures 11 and 12, and see Additional data file 1. This file also shows platypus contigs that
contain the mapped and predicted genes extending the
regions of homology.
Gene loci in chicken are designated in the following section
according to their established conserved synteny with human
chromosomes. For instance, chicken Z is homologous with
regions of human chromosomes 5, 9, 8 and 18 and chicken
chromosome 2, 3 and 13 also share homology with human
chromosome 5 [9]. Figure 12 presents a standard idiogram,
based on G-banding and chromosome painting, on which the
present and previous [10,11,22-25] gene assignments are
shown. Consideration of the contigs in Ensembl to which
these genes belong greatly expands the size of the syntenic
regions (Additional data file 1). Most of the conserved
syntenies that we have observed between platypus chromosomes and chicken Z are in five groups.
The first group includes platypus homologues of chicken Z
and human 9 (Gallus gallus (GGA)-Z/Homo sapiens (HAS)9) genes. Three genes mapped to platypus X5, one mapped to
X2 and two mapped to X3 (Figure 12). Consideration of the
contigs to which these genes belong greatly expands the size
of the homologous regions (Additional data file 1).
The second group includes platypus homologues of chicken Z
and human 5 (GGA-Z/HSA-5) genes. Ten genes are distributed over platypus chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and the sex chromosomes. Only one GGA-Z/HSA-5 gene (PDE6A) mapped to
platypus X1 by both PCR and BAC-clone mapping. This gene
mapped on the pairing region of X1p and Y1q, distal to the

centromere on each (Figure 10b,c), and is contained in platypus contig 269 with nine other genes, four of which are
homologous to GGA-13/HSA-5q (Additional data file 1). Two
platypus genes (LMNB1 and DMXL1) homologous to chicken
Z and human 5 (GGA-Z/HSA-5) mapped to platypus X5 by
both PCR and BAC-clone mapping. The homologue of the
chicken gene LMNB1 PCR-mapped also to X1 but not to Y1,
suggesting that the PCR product of X1 may represent a section
of the X5 gene that has a copy (paralogue) on X1. Likewise,
DMXL1 was PCR-mapped also to Oan 10 as well as X1 (but not
Y1), again indicating that a section of the DMXL1-X5 gene has

a copy (paralogue) on both Oan 10 and X1. The seven other
GGA-Z/HSA 5 genes map to Oan 1, 2 and 3 by PCR or BACFISH.
The third group includes platypus homologues of chicken 13
and human 5 (GGA-13/HSA-5), and chicken 3 and human 2
(GGA-3/HSA-2) genes. Five GGA-13/HSA-5 genes and one
GGA-3/HSA-2 gene mapped to the pairing regions of X1 and
Y1 (Figures 11 and 12). PANK3 also PCR-mapped to Oan 8,
which might be a paralogue. Thus, the three GGA-Z/HSA-5
homologues on X1 are accompanied by GGA-13/HSA-5 genes

and one GGA-3/HSA-2 gene. The majority of genes in the
respective contigs (10, 269, 847, 127) are GGA-13/HSA-5
genes, one is a GGA-3/HSA-8 gene and three are GGA-3/
HSA-2 genes.

The fourth group includes platypus homologues of chicken 2
and human 5 (GGA-2/HSA-5), and chicken 2 and human 18
(GGA-2/HSA-18) genes. Three GGA-2/HSA-5 genes mapped
to Oan Y2 and X3. These three genes are accompanied by the
GGA-2/HSA-18 gene P15RS. This gene is in contig 29, which

contains 7 GGA-2/HSA-5 genes, 3 GGA-2/HSA-9 genes and 3
GGA-2/HSA-18 genes.

Homology between platypus and echidna
chromosomes

The fifth group includes platypus homologues of chicken Z
and human 8 (GGA-Z/HSA-8), and chicken Z and human 18
(GGA-Z/HSA-18) genes. Two GGA-Z/HSA-8 genes mapped
to platypus chromosome 5, and one GGA-Z/HSA-18 gene
mapped to platypus chromosome 3.

Ten chromosomes are completely conserved between echidna
and platypus. The non-conserved chromosomes differ
between the two species by centric rearrangements only,
which are charted in Figures 2 and 6. Without comparative
data from an outgroup it is not possible to distinguish fusions
in one lineage from fissions in the other.

Thus, mapping platypus homologues of chicken Z genes
revealed homology not only with platypus X5 but also with
platypus X1, Y1, X2 and X3. Other genes from human chromosomes 5 and 9, which are not homologous to the chicken Z,
also mapped to platypus sex chromosomes. A set of GGA-Z
genes homologous to HSA-5, 8 or 18 (see above), but so far
not HSA-9, mapped to platypus autosomes. So far, no chicken
Z genes have been mapped to platypus X4, but this may not be
surprising as X4 is homologous to an echidna autosome.
A selection of these genes was PCR-mapped to echidna chromosome-specific DNA using the same primers. GPR98 (Oan
1) mapped to Tac 1, GRHL1 (Oan X1, Y1) mapped to Tac X1
but not Y1, RAPGEF6 (Oan X1, Y1) mapped to Tac X1 and Y1.
MLLT3 (Oan X2) mapped to Tac X2, TRIO (Oan Y2, X3)
mapped to Tac Y2 and X3, TSCOT (Oan X3) mapped to Tac X3,
and LMNB1 (Oan X1, X5) mapped to Tac X4. DMRT1 (Oan X5)
mapped to Tac X4 by BAC-FISH (Figure 10a). These results
confirm homologies between the platypus and echidna chromosomes determined by chromosome painting.

Discussion

We confirm previous cytological studies of echidna mitotic
and meiotic chromosomes that showed that the male shortbeaked echidna has 63 chromosomes - 27 pairs of autosomes
and 9 sex chromosomes [20,21,26] - and establish that the sex
chromosome constitution is 5 Xs and 4 Ys. These
chromosomes form a chain of nine at meiosis, expected (by
analogy to platypus) to be in an alternating X-Y order. Adjacent members are expected to be held together by pairing
within 16 pseudoautosomal regions (one per chromosome
arm except for X1q and X5p, which terminate the chain). Each
sex chromosome and 13 of the expected 16 pairing regions of
the 5 Xs and 4 Ys (Figure 2, middle) were identified in this
study. The alternating order in the chain is directly confirmed
by painting in meiosis I metaphases (Figure 5e–g).

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R243

Rens et al. R243.11

Both platypus and echidna have prominent NORs on the
short arm of chromosome 6, which was thought to be homologous, because of their similar size and morphology [21].
However, chromosome painting shows that platypus chromosome 6 is homologous to echidna chromosome16. In addition, echidna has NORs on X4 and chromosome 3. Nonhomology of NOR-bearing chromosomes is not surprising in
view of their rearrangement in many closely related species.

Differences between platypus and echidna sex
chromosome chains
The constitution of the sex chromosome system in Tac differs
from that in Oan in their number, order and in the identity of
one XY pair. Firstly, chromosome painting shows that there
are five Xs and five Ys in platypus but five Xs and only four Ys
in the echidna. The missing platypus Y5 is a very small chromosome, and it had been previously supposed to have been
lost from the echidna lineage [21,27]. However, the presence
of a strongly hybridizing region on the larger echidna Y3 using
the platypus Y5 paint suggests that the content of this platypus
Y is incorporated into echidnaY3. The surprising finding is
that these two Y-chromosomes are at different locations in
the chain. Secondly, Oan X5 and Tac X4 are shown to be
homologous chromosomes by chromosome painting, and by
sharing the DMRT1 gene cluster (Figure 10a). However, they
occupy different positions in the chain. Thirdly, the most
telling result we obtained was the finding that the platypus
and echidna sex chromosome chains contain elements (Oan
chromosomes Y3, X4 and Y4, and Tac X5 and Y4) that are not
homologous; platypus X4 paints an autosome (chromosome
27) in echidna and echidna X5 paints an autosome (chromosome 12) in platypus.
Thus, the chain in these monotreme species differs in both
order and constitution, indicating that the chain continued to
evolve after the divergence of platypus and echidna
approximately 25 MYA [28]. One can speculate that the pri-

mary sex determining locus is more likely to be found on the
non-pairing regions of the X or Y chromosomes that are
shared between platypus and echidna rather than on those
that are autosomal in either.

chicken chromosomes that are homologous to human
autosomes.

Although the comparative painting reported here is a
genome-wide comparison between the two monotreme
species, it cannot, of course, reveal the gene content of the
chromosomes, which requires comparative gene mapping.

Mapping chicken-human homologous genes
Comparative gene mapping was used to establish that homologous genes are together in the same contiguous region in
both species indicating chromosome homology. This does not
exclude the possibility of non-orthology for some of the contiguous genes, but the likelihood of multiple, independent
exceptional events is reduced as more homologues are
discovered in the region. As the chance of independent evolution of syntenic regions is reduced, the likelihood of shared
descent from the same chromosomal region in a common
ancestor is increased.
The comparative mapping results show that monotreme sex
chromosomes contain genes homologous to the chicken Z
chromosome and chicken autosomes, with the implication
that the sex determining system might be related to an
ancestral sauropsid system. The early finding of the DMRT1
gene on platypus X5 prompted our search for other chicken Z
genes on this chromosome by mapping homologues of GGAZ/HSA-9 genes followed by homologues of GGA-Z/HSA-5
genes. This led to the observation of chicken Z and autosomal
homologues on other platypus sex chromosomes.
With regard to platypus X1, the preliminary results of the
draft genome sequence of the female platypus (Ensembl
release 44) and a recent comparative mapping study of therian X-linked genes (F Veyrunes, personal communication)
show that platypus X1 does not share homology with the therian X as previously reported [14-18]. X-linked genes on
human Xq assigned by FISH localization of BACs so far all
map to platypus chromosome 6 [10]. These on human Xp
map to platypus chromosome 15 and 18 [23] (F Veyrunes,
personal communication). The results presented here reveal
instead that platypus X1 shares homology with chicken
chromosomes 3, 13, and Z and the corresponding human
chromosomes 2, 5, 8, and 9 (Additional data file 1). Thus, our
mapping data show that X1 shares homology with those

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R243

Rens et al. R243.13

The implications of some of the platypus gene assignments
require further discussion. For example, the motivation to
map RAPGEF6 was that this gene is close to the chicken Z
HINT1 homologue in human (HSA-5q), although on a different chromosome in chicken (GGA-13). HINT1 might be
involved in the chicken sex determining pathway, so may be a
candidate for the primary sex determining locus in platypus;
mapping a HINT1 homologue was unsuccessful. However,
the localization of RAPGEF6 to Oan X1, Y1 makes it unlikely
that this region contains the primary sex determinant. Note
that platypus X1p and Y1q contain homologues of genes on
chicken 3, 13 and Z (mapped in this report). The chicken 13
and the chicken Z regions were presumably syntenic before
the divergence of Prototheria and Theria as these regions are
syntenic in both monotremes and human.
The platypus homologues that map to X2 (MLLT3), X3
(TSCOT, PALM2), and both X3 and Y2 (CDH12, DNAH5,
TRIO, P15RS) assign their respective contigs to these sex
chromosomes (Figure 12 and Additional data file 1), indicating that parts of chicken 2 and chicken Z were fused before the
divergence of Prototheria and Theria, and that the fission of
chicken chromosome 2 into the regions on human
chromosome 5, 9, and 18 occurred after the divergence of
Prototheria and Theria.
Previous work showed that platypus chromosome X5 contains
the DMRT1-2-3 complex, whose homologue maps to the Z
chromosome in chicken, and to human chromosome 9 [6,8].
We show here that several other genes with homologues on
the chicken Z also map to the platypus X5. Identification of
the contigs that include these genes maps a large fraction of
the chicken Z to platypus X5, indicating that a large region of
human 9 homologous to chicken Z is conserved on platypus
chromosome X5. Platypus major histocompability complex
(MHC) class III genes have been mapped recently to the pairing segments of X5 and Y4 and MHC class I and II genes have
been mapped to the pairing regions of X3 and Y3 [29]. We note
that platypus X4 (homologous to the echidna autosome Tac
27) separates these two clusters, while in echidna the homologues of platypus X5 and Y4 (that is, Tac X4 and Y4) that carry
the MHC genes are adjacent to X3 and Y3, suggesting that the
insertion of X4 in platypus was a later event in the evolution of
the monotreme meiotic chain. So far, no homologues of

chicken Z map to platypus X4, possibly because it is homologous to an echidna autosome.
The gene mapping results described here assign several genes
to the pairing regions of platypus Y chromosomes. The
sequence reported in Ensembl does not provide this information as it is based on the female genome, so Y-linked genes are
not included.
Not all chicken Z homologous genes are located on the
monotreme sex chromosomes. Seven additional GGA-Z/
HSA-5 genes map to platypus autosomes 1, 2, or 3 (Figures 11
and 12). The GGA-Z/HSA-8 genes LPL and CHRNB3 map to
platypus chromosome 5 and the GGA-Z/HSA-18 gene
ATP5A1 maps to platypus chromosome 3. Platypus chromosome 3 contains homologues of genes localized on chicken Z
and human 5 and 18. This means that these two human
regions were syntenic before monotreme-therian divergence
and became separated only in the mammalian lineage after
this divergence.
The monotreme regions homologous to chicken Z are considerably rearranged and distributed over autosomes and at
least four X chromosomes and the corresponding Ys. The

(single) Z homologues on X1, Y1 and X2 are accompanied by
other non-Z homologues in their respective contigs. X3 seems
to have a large region homologous to chicken Z as it contains
contig 278 with a size around 0.8 Mb. This contig has chicken
Z genes that are homologous only to human chromosome 9
and 5. In Ensembl release 45, contig 278 is part of ultracontig
84 with a size of around 8 Mb containing more chicken Z
(human 5 and 9) homologous genes. Only chicken Z genes
have so far been mapped to platypus X5 and most of these are
homologous to human 9 and a few to human 5. As both X3 and
X5 contain human 5 and 9 genes (that are homologous to
chicken Z), the separation into these human 5 and human 9
regions must have occurred later in the therian lineage.
Finally, the platypus autosomes 1, 2 and 3 also contain
chicken Z genes, suggesting that these chromosomes may
represent the partners in original translocations involving a
putative ancestral Z chromosome.
The results shown in Figure 12 all confirmed the homologies
found by chromosome painting in this report and in our
previous paper [7]. In particular, a number of FISH assignments confirmed the pairing regions between X and Y chromosomes. These early mapping results should help in the
identification of the primary sex-determining locus, in the

investigation of mechanisms of dosage compensation and in
understanding the evolution of vertebrate sex chromosomes.
An exchange mechanism for the evolution of the multiple sex
chromosomes of the platypus was postulated previously
[7,21]. The chain development was suggested to start with an
ancestral pair of differentiated sex chromosomes, one of
which was repeatedly involved in exchanges with autosomes.
An alternative view [27,30] suggests that the chain arose as
the result of hybridization between two ancestral monotreme
populations, each with a different set of Robertsonian translocations resulting in a male heterozygous for unpaired sex
chromosomes. Common to all models is that the rearranged

autosomes in the chain evolved into Y chromosomes. Our
finding that different rearrangements occurred in the two
monotreme lineages after the platypus-echidna divergence
(25 MYA [28]) is easier to reconcile with a model of successive
translocation, rather than the unlikely alternative of additional hybridizations between populations differing in other
Robertsonian rearrangements.

Conclusion

Our cross-species painting studies of the monotreme sex
chromosome complements shows that the platypus and
echidna translocation chains share homology over four of the

five X chromosomes, but one in each species is entirely nonhomologous. This means that the chains continued to evolve
after the divergence of platypus and echidna.
Our comparative mapping studies show chicken Z homologous genes in the sex chromosome system with the main clusters on platypus X3 and X5 and echidna X3 and X4. Other Z
homologous genes map to autosomes, indicating many rearrangements between the monotreme and avian lineages.
In combination with the mapping data available in current
Ensembl release 44, our results also reveal homology of platypus X1 to chicken 3, 13, Z, 11, and 12, which are homologous
to human autosomes. This suggests that the monotreme's XY
chromosome system is unrelated to the therian XY system.
This is further explored by F Veyrunes (personal communication) in comparative studies with therian X-linked genes, and
it may mean that the therian XY system evolved after the prototherian and therian divergence, but before the divergence of
marsupials, and is, therefore, younger than previously anticipated [31].

It is important to note that three monotreme X chromosomes
have large differential regions. The differential region on platypus X5 (echidna X4) is homologous to chicken Z, that of X3 is
homologous to chicken 2 and Z, and the large differential
region on X1 seems mostly homologous to chicken 3 and 12.
These differential regions are completely different from those
of the therian X and Y chromosomes, indicating again that the
monotreme and therian sex chromosome systems have different origins. We believe that the comparative mapping results
reported here will be useful in the continuing search for the
monotreme sex determining switch, and in future studies on
sex chromosome evolution and dosage compensation
mechanisms.
It will be instructive to extend the genome comparison
between birds and monotremes to other amniotes, such as
snakes and lizards. These comparisons will enable the construction of the ancestral karyotype of sauropsids and mammals and reveal the chromosome evolutionary events that
occurred at the origin of the sauropsid and mammalian
lineages.

Materials and methods

Fluorescence microscopy

Chromosome paint generation
Primary fibroblast cultures from the short-beaked echidna
(T. aculeatus, 2n = 63 male, 64 female) were established routinely in standard medium at 32°C (AEEC permit no.
R.CG.07.03 and AEC permit no S-049-2006, NSW P&W permit S10443). Flow sorting, chromosome paint production
and FISH were performed according to the protocol
described previously [7,32]. Platypus (2n = 52) chromosome
paints and metaphases were generated as previously
described for the characterization of the platypus sex chromosome complement [7].

Cot-1 preparation
Cot-1 DNA was prepared as described [33], except that the
renatured (double-stranded) Cot-1 DNA was separated from
the digested (single-stranded) DNA using a phenol-chloroform-extraction method. Purified echidna Cot-1 DNA (30 mg)
was used for FISH.

Preparation of meiotic cells
Meiotic cells were obtained from animals captured at the
upper Barnard river, New South Wales, Australia during
breeding season (AEEC and AEC permits to FG as above). The
captured animals were euthanased with an intraperitoneal
injection of pentobarbitone sodium (Nembutal, Boehringer
Ingelheim, NSW, Australia) at a dose of 0.1 mg/g body
weight. Meiotic cells were obtained by disaggregating the testis. The material was either directly fixed in methanol/acetic
acid (3:1) or incubated in 0.075 KCl M at 37°C as hypotonic
treatment to improve spreading of metaphase cells and then
fixed.

Chromosome microdissection
Microdissection-derived chromosome specific paints of specific blocks were generated as described previously [34]. In
short, short-beaked echidna metaphases were dropped onto
wet cover slips and subsequently digested with 0.015%
trypsin for 1 minute and stained with Giemsa. Microdissected
material was collected in a drop containing 10 mM NaCl, 10
mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton ×100,
1.44 mg/ml Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK), 30% glycerol. After 1 hour incubation at 60°C this
drop was transferred to 5 μl of 1× sequenase buffer (USB,
Staufen, Germany), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 μM 6 mW primer. A
PCR protocol for low temp cycles was next: 5 minutes at 92°C
followed by 8 cycles of 2 minutes 20 s at 25°C, 2 minutes at
34°C, 1 minute at 90°C. At the start of each cycle 0.4 units of
sequenase (USB) was added. For the high temp cycles 45 μl 1×
Buffer D (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 0.2 mM dNTP, 5 μM 6
mW primer, 0.3 u SuperTaq polymerase (HT Biotechnology,
Cambridge, UK), 0.05% W1 (Sigma) were added. This solution was subjected to 33 cycles of 1 minute at 92°C, 2 minutes
at 56°C, 2 minutes at 72°C with a final extension for 5 minutes
at 72°C. The DNA was labeled using a standard protocol [32].

Images were captured using the Leica QFISH software (Leica
Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) and a cooled CCD camera
(Photometrics Sensys, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA)
mounted on a Leica DMRXA microscope equipped with a
63×, 1.3 NA objective. Cy3, FITC 9 (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) signals
were captured separately as 16 bit black and white images,
and merged to a color image. The DAPI image was enhanced
with a spatial filter to obtain enhanced chromosome bands.
All image processing was performed with Leica CW4000
software.

Characterization of the short-beaked echidna
karyotype
The Tac paints produced were hybridized to male (three individuals) and female (one individual) Tac metaphase preparations. Multicolor chromosome painting was used to ensure
that different peaks represent different chromosomes, to
define the order of the unpaired chromosomes and to determine the homologous parts that link these chromosomes in
the meiotic chain.

Mapping chicken-human chromosome 5, 9, 8, 18
homologous genes on platypus and echidna
chromosomes
Twenty-nine genes were mapped to platypus chromosomes
(Table 1), and eight of these to echidna chromosomes. Two
methods, PCR and BAC-clone mapping (indicated by 'a' and
'b' in Table 1) were used to localize the platypus homologues.

PCR
A human or chicken exon of the specific gene was blasted to
find alignments with the NCBI trace archives of platypus
using discontiguous megablast. The alignment was used to
design platypus specific primers using PrimerQuest [35]. The
primers were used first to amplify pools of chromosome
specific DNA, and second to amplify chromosome specific
DNAs of the positive pool. The exon was considered to be
mapped to a single chromosome if only one pool was positive
and only one 'chromosome' in that pool was positive. The size
of the PCR product was checked to verify that it was as
expected from the primer design section, and the product was
sequenced for confirmation.
The sequence of the PCR products was blasted to find alignments with the Ensembl Platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus
database release 5. The platypus contigs in the database contain several predicted genes, which were identified by blasting to find alignments with the NCBI human genome
database. Homologues of these genes were subsequently
localized in chicken by BLAST alignment in Ensembl
Chicken.

*The two methods used to localize the platypus homologues are: a, PCR; b, BAC-clone. See text for details.

BAC-clone mapping
The above PCR product was used to screen a platypus BACclone library (Oa-Bb, Clemson University, South Carolina,
USA). Positive clones were labeled by nick translation and
positioned on platypus chromosomes by FISH. The presence
of the target gene in the BAC clones above was confirmed by
sequencing using the same gene specific primers.

Chromosome homology by comparative gene
mapping
Comparative gene mapping was used for the assessment of
chromosome homology. It is important to consider whether
the homologous genes are likely to be true orthologues. The
definition of orthologues is two genes from two different species that derive from a single gene in the last common ancestor of the species [36]. Absolute proof of orthology is difficult
on this criterion and was not pursued in this report. Instead,
support for chromosome homology was provided when
homologous genes were together within the same contiguous

region in both species. Instances of non-orthology in the syntenies may exist but the likelihood of multiple, independent
exceptional events is reduced when several gene homologues
are found in one region.
