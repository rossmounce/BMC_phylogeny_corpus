Abstract
Background: Mink enteritis virus (MEV) causes a highly contagious viral disease of mink with a worldwide distribution.
MEV has a linear, single-stranded, negative-sense DNA with a genome length of approximately 5,000 bp. The VP2
protein is the major structural protein of the parvovirus encoded by the vp2 gene. VP2 is highly antigenic and plays
important roles in determining viral host ranges and tissue tropisms. This study describes the bionomics and vp2 gene
analysis of a mutated strain, MEV-DL, which was isolated recently in China and outlines its homologous relationships
with other selected strains registered in Genbank.
Results: The MEV-DL strain can infect F81 cells with cytopathic effects. Pig erythrocytes were agglutinated by the MEVDL strain. The generation of MEV-DL in F81 cells could infect mink within three months and cause a disease that was
similar to that caused by wild-type MEV. A comparative analysis of the vp2 gene nucleotide (nt) sequence of MEV-DL
showed that this was more than 99% homologous with other mink enteritis parvoviruses in Genbank. However, the
nucleotide residues at positions 1,065 and 1,238 in the MEV-DL strain of the vp2 gene differed from those of all the
other MEV strains described previously. It is noteworthy that the mutation at the nucleotide residues position 1,238 led
to Asp/Gly replacement. This may lead to structural changes. A phylogenetic tree and sequence distance table were
obtained, which showed that the MEV-DL and ZYL-1 strains had the closest inheritance distance.
Conclusions: A new variation of the vp2 gene exists in the MEV-DL strain, which may lead to structural changes of the
VP2 protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MEV-DL may originate from the ZYL-1 strain in DaLian.
Background
Parvoviruses are autonomous, single-stranded DNA
viruses that have a genome length of approximately 5,000
bp [1-3]. Parvoviruses are capable of infecting a variety of
hosts, for example, parvovirus B19 cause disease in
humans, while others such as feline panleukopenia virus
(FPV), canine parvovirus (CPV), raccoon parvovirus
(RPV) and blue fox parvovirus (BFPV) infect carnivores,
and sometimes even fatal to susceptible animals [4-10].
The mink enteritis virus (MEV) disease was first reported
by Schofield (1949) [11]. In 1952, Wills [12] isolated and
identified the viral pathogen. MEV is a contagious disease
can cause acute hemorrhagic enteritis in mink, in partic* Correspondence: leilc@jlu.edu.cn

ular in younger animals, and it is frequently associated
with leucopenia [9].
MEV is classified as a FPV subgroup, a classification
which also includes CPV, RPV, and BFPV [13,14]. A comparison of the sequence of amino acid residues between
laboratory strains and isolated wild type (wt) strains
showed homology of more than 98% [15-21]. The nucleotide sequence of the carnivorous animal parvovirus also
has a high level of homology, and the FPV, MEV, RPV, and
BFPV cannot be distinguished from each other by DNA
sequence alone [22].
VP2 protein is the main structural protein of parvovirus
capsid encoded by vp2 gene. That either residue 93 or
residue 300 in VP2 protein of CPV binds to the cellular
transferrin receptor (TfR) determines CPV infectivity of
canine [23]. Those capsid regions are also highly anti-

genic, and serves as the target of many neutralizing antibodies [15].
Tingxiu Jiang [3] reported the first incidence of MEV
disease in China in 1981. Nearly 30 years later, this disease has now spread widely across China and affects
almost all of the mink cultivation sites [24]. In recent
years, although a vaccine has been used to prevent further spread of the disease, the number of infections still
continues to grow [24]. This may be related to the capacity of the MEV to continuously mutate. In this study, the
MEV-DL virus strain, which is a characteristic parvovirus, has been isolated with a mutation within VP2 protein.

Methods
Sample origin and bionomics

Samples of feces from minks with signs of illness were
taken from DaLian in China and used for the isolation of
MEV-DL. The fecal samples were manipulated according
to the methods that have been described previously [25].
The isolated viral particles were then inoculated into F81
cells. When the cytopathic effects of the virus on F81 cells
reached 80%, cultures were scraped, then centrifuged
after a freeze-thaw cycle twice, and the supernatant was
collected [26,27]. Electron microscopy, animal studies
[28,29], and hemagglutination tests [23] were used to
analyze the bionomics of the MEV-DL strain.
vp2 gene cloning and sequencing

According to the vp2 gene sequence published in Genbank (accession number: M23999), a pair of specific
primers were designed to amplify the vp2 gene of the isolated strain of MEV; the sequence of the forward primer
was 5'-GCACCAATGAGTGATGGAGCAGTTC-3' (nt
294-318) and the reverse primer sequence was 5'TCTAAGGGCAAACCAACCAACCACC-3' (nt 2,2922,317). The size of the resulting product was 1,999 bp.
The fecal samples from the mink that had been infected
naturally were homogenized, frozen and thawed in normal saline before being subjected to centrifugation at
4,000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was used
as the template for PCR, for which the following conditions were applied: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1
min, annealing at 55°C for 45 s and polymerization at
72°C for 2 min 30 s. After electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining, the PCR products were extracted from the gel and puriﬁed. The
puriﬁed products were cloned into the PMD18-T vector,
transformed into DH-5α, and then incubated at temperature of 37°C for 16 hours. The positive clones were
sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering
Technology & Services Co., Ltd.

Phylogeny

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA 4 [30],
and seventeen vp2 gene sequences from MEV, CPV and
FPV in Genbank were used in this study. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method
[31], and a bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates was performed to assess the confidence level of the branch pattern. The sequence distances were determined using the
Jotun Hein method [32]. The nt sequences of the vp2
gene of the analyzed parvovirus were as follows: MEV-e
(U22191), Abashiri (D00765), ZYL-1 (GU272028), MEVDL (HM015824), Suning (FJ712217), LYT-2 (FJ712221),

(FJ432717) and 11/09 (GU45715).

Results
Bionomics

Sixty hours after inoculation of MEV-DL strain into normal F81 cells, these cells were integrated into a cell colony
and cellular strings with the intracellular particles
increased. The results from electron microscopy showed
that the viral particles existed as a sphere with a diameter
of approximately 20 nm. Hemagglutination assays
showed that MEV-DL can agglutinate pig erythrocytes.
Animal inoculation experiments demonstrated that the
MEV-DL cultures infected minks and caused diarrhea 10
days after inoculation; 15 days after inoculation, clinic
symptoms of the minks disappeared.
vp2 gene sequencing analysis and phylogenetic analysis

The PCR amplification of the MEV-DL strain vp2 gene
products were cloned into PMD18-T and sequenced. A
comparative analysis of the vp2 nucleotide sequence
(1,755 bp) of this strain was performed against other
MEV vp2 sequences that are stored in Genbank. This
analysis showed that the mutated strain of MEV-DL was
more than 99% homologous with the other strains of
MEV cited above ( Figure 1). It was found that there were
33 different nt positions that existed in vp2 gene fragments among published vp2 sequences of MEV strains.
(Additional file 1), but differences occurred at only 16
amino acid residues in the VP2 protein among the strains
listed above (Table 1).
Specifically, the 1,065 and 1,238 nucleotide residues in
the vp2 gene of the MEV-DL strain differed from those of
all MEV strains that have been described previously. It is
noteworthy that only the mutation at position 1,238 led
to an Asp/Gly replacement mutation at the 413 amino

acid residue of the VP2 protein, which may lead to structural changes, such as alterations in the alpha, amphipathic regions and tum regions forecasted by DNASTAR
software.
At the phylogenetic level, the vp2 gene sequences of the
MEV-DL and ZYL-1, as well as the vp2 gene sequences of
FPV and MEV, formed clusters when compared to the
vp2 gene sequences of CPV (Figure 2). The results also
showed that the vp2 gene sequence of the ZYL-1 strain
(accession number: GU2772028), which was isolated
from DaLian in China, had a nucleotide sequence homology up to 99.9% with the relevant sequence of the MEVDL strain, whereas the LYT-2 isolation strain (accession
number: FJ712221) only had a nucleotide sequence
homology up to 99.4% when compared to the MEV-DL
strain ( Figure 1).

Discussion
MEV, FPV, BFPV, RPV and CPV are all classified in the
same family and more than 98% of their nucleotide
sequences are shared [13]. However, the evolutionary rate
of parvoviruses varies between species; for instance, CPV
had a nucleotide substitution rate that was similar to that
of the RNA viruses, such as HIV, whereas FPV had a slow
rate of nt substitution compared to CPV [33]. The average annual replacement rates of CPV and FPV are 1.7×104 and 9.4×10-5, respectively [33]. In the past 40 years, 33
nucleotide substitution positions have been found in the
vp2 gene among the MEV strains Mutated bases in the
vp2 gene in MEV-DL were included in this study. Additionally, a mutated base was also found in BFPV vp1 gene
at position 296 [34]. Therefore, it can be concluded that
more nucleotide substitution positions may exist in the

MEV genome than was previously thought, and MEV
may have a greater rate of evolution.
Three antigenic variants of MEV have been identified,
which differ by only small numbers of amino acid
sequence changes in the capsid protein [35]. Crossimmunity to these strains has protected mink from infection by both homologous and heterologous MEV strains
[35]. The vp2 gene encodes the major structural protein
of parvoviruses [36]. It determines the antigenicity of the
parvovirus and its host specificity [18]. Therefore,
research into the vp2 gene is of great interest with regards
to vaccine research and viral identification. In our study,
analysis of the vp2 gene sequence showed that nt residues
at positions 1,065 and 1,238 in MEV-DL strain differed
from those of all MEV strains described previously. Furthermore, only a mutation at position 1,238 led to an
Asp/Gly replacement in the VP2 protein, which is a new
variant that has not been reported previously in MEV.
Different parvoviruses show differences in host tropism. For example, FPV can infect mink, but cannot
infect canines [37]; likewise, CPV-2a can cause disease in
cats, but cannot infect mink [38]. FPV virus could bind
with canine transferrin receptors and cause the subsequent infection of canine cells if the 93 and 323 amino
acid residues of FPV VP2 protein changed to be the same
as that of CPV [39]. In contrast, changes to residues in the
vicinity of residue 300 of the amino acid sequence can
reduce the amount of adsorption of the virus into canine
cells [39]. In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, the original
CPV-2a and CPV-2b strains were replaced by the new
CPV-2a and CPV-2b strains, which had resulted from a
change in residue 297 of the amino acid sequence of the
VP2 protein [40-43].
Sixteen amino acid residues are known to be variable in
VP2 proteins of nine MEV strains listed in table 1, and
these include in particular the amino acid residues in the
vicinity of residue 300 (Table 1). This may lead to changes
in MEV-specific adsorption by the host, and further studies should be developed to explain whether the mutation
that affects position 413 (Asp/Gly replacement) would
lead to changes in host adsorption of MEV and subsequent pathogenicity.
The VP2 protein region (between residues 267 and 498)
forms the GH loop located between the βG and βH
strands and is affected by the greatest variability among
parvoviruses due to its exposure on the capsid surface
[44]. In the present study, a strain of MEV has been
shown to have a difference at position 413 (Asp/Gly).
Residue 413 was not exposed on the capsid surface, as
forecasted by DNASTAR, and the change of this position
led to alterations in the structure of the alpha, amphipathic and tum regions. This change would be likely to
have a significant effect on the structure of the VP2 protein, and so influence its antigenicity and bionomics. This

may help to explain the differences between other MEV
strains and the variation in response to vaccines that are
presently used in China.
In this paper, the vp2 nucleotide sequence of the MEVDL strain has been shown have a homology of up to
99.9% with the ZYL-1 strain (accession number:
GU272028). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that only
minor changes have occurred between the MEV-DL and
ZYL-1 strains. These results infer that the MEV-DL strain
may originate from the ZYL-1 strain that was already
present in China and, therefore, have little or no relationship to other MEV strains found elsewhere. Due to the
high rate of nt substitution in MEV strains, it is necessary
to isolate the current MEV strains to understand and prevent the disease caused by MEV.
