Abstract
Background: Recent studies strongly suggest that some respiratory viruses are associated with the induction of
acute wheezing and/or exacerbation of bronchial asthma. However, molecular epidemiology of these viruses is not
exactly known.
Methods: Using PCR technology, we attempted to detect various respiratory viruses from 115 Japanese children.
Furthermore, the detected viruses were subjected to homology, pairwise distance, and phylogenetic analysis.
Results: Viruses were detected from 99 (86.1%) patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) alone and human
rhinovirus (HRV) alone were detected in 47 (40.9%) and 36 (31.3%) patients, respectively. Both RSV and HRV were
detected in 14 (12.2%) patients. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) alone and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)
alone were detected in 1 (0.9%) patient each, respectively. Homology and phylogenetic analyses showed that the
RSV and HRV strains were classified into genetically diverse species or subgroups. In addition, RSV was the
dominant virus detected in patients with no history of wheezing, whereas HRV was dominant in patients with a
history of wheezing.
Conclusions: The results suggested that these genetically diverse respiratory viruses, especially RSV and HRV, might
be associated with wheezing in Japanese children.

Background
A range of respiratory viruses are known to cause acute
respiratory infections (ARI), including the common cold,
bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in humans [1]. The major
pathogens are potentially respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV),
enterovirus (EV), influenza viruses (InfV), adenoviruses
(AdV), and human bocavirus (HBoV) [2,3]. Respiratory
infections by RSV, HRV, and HPIV are implicated in
the induction of wheezing and the exacerbation of
asthma, although their mechanisms are not clearly
known [4]. The prevalence of asthma in developed

countries is around 10 to 15% in children, while the prevalence is lower but increasing rapidly in developing
countries [5]. Accumulating evidence indicates that the
etiology of most cases of asthma, namely virus-induced
asthma, is linked to such respiratory virus infections
[6-9]. In addition, other epidemiological studies suggest
that about 70% of infants have experienced an RSV
infection by the age of 1 year, and 100% by the age of 2
years; the host response to the virus varies greatly, but
includes upper respiratory tract infections, typical
bronchiolitis (with crepitations but no wheeze), and
RSV-induced wheezy bronchitis [10,11]. In addition,
HRV includes over 100 serotypes and most of these are
epidemic, although their epidemiology is not known
[12]. Similarly, most children are infected at least once
with HPIV early in life, but reinfections occur throughout life [13]. HBoV and HMPV are recently discovered

agents of ARI, and these viruses are also associated with
the common cold, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [14].
However, the relationships between these viruses and
virus-induced wheezing are not exactly known.
Genetic analyses including sequence and phylogenetic
analyses of various viruses enable detailed genetic characterization of these agents. With the use of these methods,
detailed molecular epidemiological studies have been
reported, even in non-culturable viruses such as HRV
species C (HRV-C) or HBoV [15,16]. However, molecular
epidemiology of various respiratory viruses with regard
to virus-induced asthma is not exactly known. From
these backgrounds, we detected various respiratory
viruses and performed a molecular epidemiological study
of them in Japanese children with acute wheezing illness.

Methods
Subjects

One hundred fifteen wheezy Japanese children were
enrolled in the present study. A summary of patient data
is shown in Table 1. All patients visited the National
Hospital Organization Yokohama Medical Center from
November 2007 to March 2009. Of these patients, 39 had
a history of wheezing, while the other 76 patients had no
such history. In addition, 66 patients had viral bronchitis
and/or bronchiolitis at consultation. These patients were
treated with infusion, oxygen, and b2-agonist or epinephrine nebulization. Informed consent was obtained
from the parents of all subjects for the donation of the
nasopharyngeal swabs used in this study.
DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing

For viral DNA/RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequence
analysis, nasopharyngeal swab samples were centrifuged
at 3000 × g at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatants
were used for RT-PCR and sequence analysis as
described previously [17]. Viral nucleic acid was
extracted from the samples using the High Pure Viral

Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The reverse transcription reaction mixture was
incubated with random hexamers at 42°C for 90 min,
followed by incubation at 99°C for 5 min, and then
amplification by thermal cycling. The PCR procedures
for amplification of various viral genes including RSV
[18], HRV [19,20], HMPV [21], HPIV [22], EV [19,20],
InfV [23], AdV [24], and HBoV [25] were conducted as
previously described. The primers for PCR are shown in
Table 2. To avoid carry over and cross-contamination in
PCR, the extraction of viral RNA/DNA was conducted
in a room physically separate from that used for performing PCR. Furthermore, positive and negative controls were included in all PCR assays. PCR products
were determined by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel.
Purification of DNA fragments and nucleotide sequence
determination procedures were performed as described
previously [17].
Phylogenetic analysis and calculation of pairwise
distances

We performed homology and phylogenetic analysis of the
G gene of RSV, and the VP4/VP2 coding region of HRV,
because these viruses were the most commonly detected
strains. The nucleotide positions of the nucleotide positions of the G gene of RSV were 673-912 (240 bp, for
subgroup A) or 670-963 (294 bp, for subgroup B), and
the VP4/VP2 coding region of HRV were 623-1012 (390
bp). We used the CLUSTAL W program on the DNA
Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) homepage http://clustalw.
ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html and TreeExplorer (Version 2.12)
http://evolgen.biol.metro-u.ac.jp/TE/. Evolutionary distances were estimated using Kimura’s two-parameter
method, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [26]. The reliability of
the tree was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replications.
We selected the reference strains as previously described
to construct the phylogenetic trees of RSV and HRV

[17,27]. Moreover, we calculated subgroup or species frequency distributions using pairwise genetic distances for
each strain, as previously described [17].
Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, Version 10.0). All data are expressed as mean ± SD.
We performed bivariate analyses using Pearson c2 and
Fisher exact tests to compare the prevalence of respiratory
viruses and other variables between the study groups. The
Student’s t-test was used to compare mean age in the study
group. Statistical significance was set at the level of p< 0.05.
Ethics approval

All samples were collected after written informed consent was obtained from the subjects’ parents. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on
Human Research of National Hospital Organization
Yokohama Medical Center.

Viruses detected in the present subjects

We genetically detected RSV, HRV, HMPV, HPIV, EV,
InfV, AdV, and HBoV in samples from 115 Japanese
children with acute wheezing (Table 3). RSV alone was
detected in 47 patients (40.9%). Among these, subgroups
A (RSV-A) and B (RSV-B) were found in 27 and 20
patients, respectively. HRV alone was detected in 36
patients (31.3%), and among these, HRV species A
(HRV-A), B (HRV-B), and C (HRV-C) were found in 17,
2, and 17 patients, respectively. Both RSV and HRV
were detected in 14 patients (12.2%). Among these,
combinations of RSV-A + HRV-A, RSV-A + HRV-B,
and RSV-A + HRV-C were found in 5, 1, and 1 patient,
respectively. In addition, RSV-B + HRV-A, RSV-B +
HRV-B, and RSV-B + HRV-C were found in 2, 1, and 4
patients, respectively. HMPV alone and HPIV alone
were detected in 1 patient each, respectively. Finally, no
viral genes for RSV, HRV, HMPV, HPIV, EV, InfV,
AdV, and HBoV were detected in 16 patients (13.9%).
From these data, RSV was revealed to be the dominant
species detected in patients with no history of wheezing
and/or asthma (38 patients vs. 9 patients, p< 0.05), while
HRV was dominant in those with a history of wheezing
and/or asthma (12 patients vs. 24 patients, p< 0.05).
These results suggested that RSV and HRV were the
major causative agents of acute wheezing in the present
study. Moreover, both RSV and HRV were detected in
over 10% of patients with acute wheezing.
Seasonal variations of detected viruses

To address relationships between seasonal variations of
respiratory viruses and acute wheezing, we showed
detected viruses during investigation period as Figure 1.
Prevalence of RSV was found from autumn to winter,
while prevalence of HRV was found in all season. In addition, both viruses were detected from autumn to winter.
Homology, phylogenetic analysis, and pairwise distances
of RSV and HRV

We performed phylogenetic and homology analysis, and
calculated the pairwise distances of RSV and HRV in
the present cases. The phylogenetic tree based on G
gene of RSV, and the VP4/VP2 coding region of HRV
are shown in Figure 2 and 3. The homology and pairwise distances are shown in Table 4. First, the RSV was
classified into two subgroups, A and B. In addition,
strains belonging to both subgroups were subdivided
into three genotypes (GA2, GA5, and BA, Figure 2).
HRV was classified into three species: HRV-A, -B, and
-C. Strains belonging to these species were subdivided
into many clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3).
The homology of RSV-A was relatively high (over 80%),
while it was quite low for other viruses and all species

of HRV (over 30% divergence). Notably, the genetic
diversity of HRV-C was wide (52 to 100%). In addition,
the pairwise distances of HRV-A and HRV-C strains are
high (over 0.2), while those for RSV-A and RSV-B
strains are low. Based on these results it is suggested
that acute wheezing-associated HRV has wide genetic
diversity.

Discussion
We detected and genetically analyzed major ARI viruses
including RSV, HRV, HMPV, and HPIV in samples
from 115 Japanese children with acute wheezing during
a 17-month period (November 2007 and March 2009).
These viruses were detected in over 80% of the patients.
The dominant viruses were RSV and HRV, and both
were detected in over 10% of the patients. In addition,
these viruses were confirmed as belonging to various
subgroups, genotypes, or species. All three species of
HRV detected showed wide genetic diversity (more than
30% divergence). Interestingly, RSV was the dominant
species detected in patients with no history of wheezing
and/or asthma, while HRV was dominant in patients
with a history of wheezing and/or asthma. The results
suggested that RSV and HRV were major ARI viruses
regarding virus-induced acute wheezing in the present
study.
It is suggested that various respiratory viruses such as
RSV, HRV, HMPV, HPIV, EV, InfV, AdV, and HBoV
are detected in patients with lower respiratory tract
infections including bronchiolitis and pneumonia [6,7].
These viruses are also detected in cases of acute wheezing [6,7]. Thus, they may be associated with both lower
respiratory tract infection and acute wheezing in children [6,7]. At present, this disease status is recognized
by physician and pediatrician as virus-induced asthma

[28,29]. It may be important to address the genetic
properties of ARI viruses associated with these diseases.
However, few studies have been conducted into the
genetic analysis of these viruses in acute wheezing. To
better understand the relationships between viral properties and acute wheezing, it may be important to
genetically analyze ARI viruses detected in the wheezy
children. We studied the molecular epidemiology of
these respiratory viruses detected in Japanese children
with acute wheezing. To the best of our knowledge, the
present study is the first to report the detection of RSV,
and HRV-A, -B, -C with different genetic characteristics
in Japanese children with acute wheezing.
Many studies suggest that RSV is a major candidate as
an inducer of acute wheezing [4,10,11] and it may infect
all children under the age of 2 years [10,11]. Furthermore,
some of these children may develop bronchiolitis and/or
pneumonia with acute wheezing [10]. Sugai-Goto et al.
demonstrated that genotypes and the major genes (F, G,
and N) of RSV isolated from hospitalized children with
bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia accompanied by acute
wheezing were not significantly different when compared
with RSV strains detected from upper respiratory tract
infections [27]. These viruses belong to subgroup A, genotype GA2 and subgroup B, genotype BA [27]. Furthermore, Nakamura et al. showed similar genetic data from
various acute respiratory infections in Okinawa, Japan
[30]. Our findings regarding the properties of G gene in
the RSV strains detected were comparable with the abovementioned reports. In contrast, it has been suggested that
a specific genotype, GA3 type virus, might be associated
with a significantly greater severity of illness [31]. Riccetto
et al. demonstrated that the severity of illness of RSV
infection in infants can be associated with other factors
such as body weight and prematurity [32], and any

association between the viral properties and pathogenicity
of RSV has yet to be elucidated. Another report suggested
that host immunity such as TLR4 polymorphism is linked
to symptomatic RSV [33]. Thus, both the antigenicity of
the viruses and host immune conditions may play

important roles in the pathophysiology of severe respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and
virus-induced asthma [1,34].
For a long time, HRV was simply thought to be causative agents of the mild common cold [12]. In general,

this acknowledgement may not be incorrect in nonasthmatic people [35]. However, it is suggested that
HRV induces wheezing and exacerbation of symptoms
in most asthmatics [12]. However, the molecular

epidemiology of each HRV species is not yet known,
because HRV is relatively difficult to isolate and detect.
Thus, non-culturable HRV-C was only recovered a few
years ago. Very recently, Mizuta et al. demonstrated

that HRV-A isolates showed wide genetic diversity, and
some viruses belonging to specific clusters of the phylogenetic tree of HRV-A isolates might be associated with
bronchiolitis [17]. In addition, a new study suggested
that HRV-C has a stronger link to virus-induced asthma
than HRV-A and -B strains [36]. However, our results
did not reveal a similar tendency, although the reasons
for this are unknown.
In this study, both RSV and HRV were detected from
over 10% of patients with acute wheezing. Chung et al.
demonstrated that both RSV and HRV were detected in
3.9% of Korean children with acute wheezing [37]. Thus,
our data and that of other studies may be comparable,
although the percentages of virus detection differ. We
additionally compared the severity of clinical symptoms
between dual virus-detected patients and those in whom
RSV or HRV was detected alone. However, there were
no significant findings. In addition, RSV, HRV, HMPV,
HPIV, EV, InfV, AdV, and HBoV were not detected in
over 10% of patients. Although we were unable to
explain why, it might be that other respiratory viruses
and bacteria were involved.
It should be noted that some respiratory viruses might
be detected in healthy children [1,38-40]. As mentioned
above, various species of HRV have been relatively frequently detected in healthy children (around 10-20%)
[39,40], although RSV was detected less frequently in
healthy and asymptomatic persons [40]. Thus, to better
understand the etiology of these viruses, it may be
important to determine the prevalence of these viruses
in healthy children. A limitation of this study is that we

did not examine such prevalence in healthy children
and instead focused mainly on detailed molecular epidemiological analysis of various respiratory viruses
detected in children with acute wheezing. Additional
molecular epidemiological studies of viruses detected in
wheezy and healthy children would be of value.
In the present study, HMPV and HPIV were detected
in samples from the subjects, albeit rarely (each virus
was detected in one of only two patients). It is suggested
that HMPV and HPIV are also associated with bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia [41]. However, it is not
known how these viruses are linked to the induction of
wheezing and exacerbation of asthma [42]. A previous
study suggested that sputum from HPIV infection contains tryptase due to activation (degranulation) of mast
cells, and this activation may strongly induce an asthmatic attack [43]. Thus, HPIV infection may induce
asthmatic conditions [7]. Additional studies regarding
the relationships between HPIV and HMPV infection
and virus-induced asthma are warranted.

Conclusions
Our data suggested that both RSV and HRV with various genetic characteristics were associated with acute
wheezing illness in Japanese children. In particular,
HRV shows widely genetic diversity. Larger studies to
examine the detailed genetic characteristics of the various respiratory viruses detected in wheezy and healthy
children may be needed.
