Abstract
Background: Due to their high level of genotypic and phenotypic variability, Mus spretus strains were introduced
in laboratories to investigate the genetic determinism of complex phenotypes including quantitative trait loci. Mus
spretus diverged from Mus musculus around 2.5 million years ago and exhibits on average a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in every 100 base pairs when compared with any of the classical laboratory strains.
A genoproteomic approach was used to assess polymorphism of the major milk proteins between SEG/Pas and
C57BL/6J, two inbred strains of mice representative of Mus spretus and Mus musculus species, respectively.
Results: The milk protein concentration was dramatically reduced in the SEG/Pas strain by comparison with the
C57BL/6J strain (34 ± 9 g/L vs. 125 ± 12 g/L, respectively). Nine major proteins were identified in both milks using
RP-HPLC, bi-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-Tof mass spectrometry. Two caseins (b and as1) and the whey
acidic protein (WAP), showed distinct chromatographic and electrophoresis behaviours. These differences were
partly explained by the occurrence of amino acid substitutions and splicing variants revealed by cDNA sequencing.
A total of 34 SNPs were identified in the coding and 3’untranslated regions of the SEG/Pas Csn1s1 (11), Csn2 (7)
and Wap (8) genes. In addition, a 3 nucleotide deletion leading to the loss of a serine residue at position 93 was
found in the SEG/Pas Wap gene.
Conclusion: SNP frequencies found in three milk protein-encoding genes between Mus spretus and Mus musculus
is twice the values previously reported at the whole genome level. However, the protein structure and posttranslational modifications seem not to be affected by SNPs characterized in our study. Splicing mechanisms
(cryptic splice site usage, exon skipping, error-prone junction sequence), already identified in casein genes from
other species, likely explain the existence of multiple as1-casein isoforms both in SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J strains.
Finally, we propose a possible mechanism by which the hallmark tandem duplication of a 18-nt exon (14 copies)
may have occurred in the mouse genome.

Background
Classical laboratory inbred strains of mice offer the most
valuable model system for medical research, allowing for
instance the analysis of complex traits. However, laboratory strains were derived from a limited number of
founding mice that belonged to several Mus musculus
subspecies: Mus m. domesticus, Mus m. musculus, M. m.
castaneus and the hybrid M. m. molossinus [1].

Therefore, their genetic variation does not encompass
the diversity seen in mice trapped in many geographical
areas in the wild. To overcome this lack of polymorphism, strains that belong to different species of the Mus
genus have recently been established from wild progenitors. Among these emerges the short-tailed species Mus
spretus, a western Mediterranean mouse, that splitted
from Mus musculus around 2.5 million years ago [1].
Although they are sympatric, these species rarely generate hybrids in nature. Under laboratory conditions, they
produce viable and fertile offspring with a large number
of polymorphisms of natural origin, but male offspring

are sterile. Strains of Mus spretus are frequently utilized
in combination with Mus musculus strains for quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies, due to their high degree of
sequence and phenotypic diversity [2]. Indeed, Mus spretus mice have been valuable for the identification of loci
contributing to differences in immune response [3] and
were used to generate the first high-density genetic map
for the mouse [4].
Any inbred strain derived from Mus spretus exhibits
on average a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in
every 100 base pairs when compared with any of the
classical laboratory strain. By comparison, the frequency
of SNPs between humans is roughly one order of magnitude lower. However, a comparison study between the
brain proteomes of Mus musculus and Mus spretus [5]
revealed a considerable discrepancy between the frequency of qualitative protein polymorphisms detected
by 2-DE (around 8%) and the frequency predicted on
the basis of SNPs (possibly up to 90%). The protein
polymorphism between mouse species has been analyzed from different tissues [5,6]. Milk protein polymorphism plays an important role in genetic diversity
analysis and phylogenetic studies. In addition, it contributes to improve our understanding of mammary evolution and of the role and sustainable use of genetic
variation in farm animals. To our knowledge, although
mice can be a pertinent model system for the identification of candidate genes for QTL of milk production
traits in cattle [7,8], no proteomic studies have been carried out so far to analyse the diversity of mouse milk
proteins and their polymorphism across Mus species.
In this report, we compared the major milk proteins
between SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J strains. SEG/Pas was
derived from Mus spretus, while C57BL/6J is a reference
laboratory strain belonging to the Mus musculus species.
The majority of the genome sequence data available for
Mus spretus are from SPRET/Ei, while the SEG/Pas genome sequence data are limited and even absent concerning the major milk protein encoding genes.
In our study, polymorphisms occurring in major milk
proteins between C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas were analyzed
and characterized. We used both proteomic and genomic approaches to highlight differences between both
strains. Interestingly, three of the main milk proteins
showed structural differences, with allelic variation and
some flexibility in splicing patterns of primary transcripts arising from the corresponding genes.

Methods
Mice

Mice from the C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas inbred strains
were housed at the INRA (Jouy-en-Josas, France) and
Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) research centers, respectively. Milk samples were collected during the first part

Page 2 of 13

of lactation, i.e. at day (d) 4, 8 and 10 from parturition,
and the second part of lactation (d14). Females were
separated 2 hours before milking, injected with 0.2 U
synthetic oxytocin (CEVA SANTE ANIMALE, Libourne,
France) and then anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (0.01 mL/g of body weight) of a solution containing
1 mL Imalgène 1000 (MERIAL, Lyon, France), 0.5 mL
Rompun (Bayer Pharma, Puteaux, France) in a final
volume of 10 mL water. After milking, the collected
milk samples were diluted with water in a 1:3 (v:v) ratio,
skimmed by centrifugation (4,000 rpm; 4°C, 15 min) and
stored at -80°C. Animal care and experimentations were
in accordance with guidelines of the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research.
RP-HPLC analysis

Protein concentration of milks was determined using a
Bradford assay [9]. Clarified skimmed milk samples were
analysed by RP-HPLC as previously described [10].
Chromatographic peaks were collected and dried in a
vacuum system.
SDS-Poly Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
analysis

Pooled chromatographic fractions corresponding to each
peak were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE as previously described [10]. Proteins (25 μg) from skimmed
milk collected on day 4, 8, and 14 of lactation were also
analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE mini-gels.
2D-Gel Electrophoresis analysis

Milks were further characterized by 2D Electrophoresis.
Skimmed milk samples containing 350 μg of proteins
were diluted in a rehydration solution containing urea/
thiourea (7M/2M), chaps (4%), DTT 100 mM, IPG pH
4-7 carrier ampholytes (0.5%) and a trace of bromophenol blue to obtain a final volume of 450 μL. The rehydration step was performed in active mode (50 volts) on
24-cm Immobiline drystrip pH 4-7 for 12 hours in a
Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). Afterwards, isoelectric
focusing (IEF) was run by increasing progressively the
voltage to reach a plateau at 10 kV and a total applied
voltage of 74 kVh in 13 hours. The focused proteins
were successively reduced (10 mg/ml DTT), and alkylated (200 mM iodoacetamide) and the strips equilibrated in a solution of 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 M Tris
pH 8.8 and 30% glycerol. The strips were then loaded
on the top of home-cast linear 12.5% polyacrylamide
gels (25 × 20 cm) and were embedded in a solution of
1% of agarose. SDS-PAGE were performed in an Ettan
Dalt six electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare) at 5 mA/
gel for 30 min, 8 mA/gel for 30 min and finally at
1.5 W/gel until the front of migration reached the bottom of the gels. Proteins were stained with BioSafe

Coomassie blue (Bio-Rad) and the gels were imaged on
a LabImager (GE Healthcare).

Genes

Protein bands or spots from 1-D or 2-D gels were excised
and the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin.
Tryptic peptides were analysed on a Voyager DE-STR
Maldi-Tof mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc.,
Framigham, MD). Peptides co-crystallized with a-CHCA
matrix (5 mg/mL dissolved in Acetonitrile/TFA 50/0.3%),
were desorbed and ionized with a nitrogen laser at 337
nm in the positive ion mode and delayed extraction. Spectra were internally calibrated using both trypsin autolysis
peaks (842.5090 Da and 2211.1040 Da) in Data Explorer
software (Applied Biosystems). After deisotoping, the
peptide mass lists were searched against the SwissProt
2007 and UniProt 2007 databases with the MS-Fit Protein
Prospector software (http://www.expasy.org).
LTQ-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry

HPLC fractions corresponding to the Whey Acidic Protein (WAP) were solubilized in an acetonitrile/water/formic acid 50/49/1 (v/v/v) solution. The sample solution
was infused at a flow rate of 100 μL/min in an electrospray source of a LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA, MA). Proteins were ionized with a spray
voltage of 1 kV and a temperature of 200 °C. Spectra
were averaged for 5 min and deconvoluted with MaxEnt
algorithm.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR

Mammary glands from milked animals killed by cervical
dislocation were dissected. The mammary tissue was
collected from C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas lactating mice.
Total RNA was extracted from the mammary tissue
samples using RNAlater (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity, quality and purity
were analyzed as previously described [11]. RNA were
mixed with 1 μL of 2/3 random primers (3 μg/μL) and
1/3 oligo (dT) 20 (50 μM) to a final volume of 20 μL.
Synthesis of the first complementary DNA strand was
performed with reverse transcriptase (RT) (SuperScript™ III, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines. Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out at
50°C for 45 min. RT was inactivated at 70°C for 15 min.
In order to remove RNA complementary to the first
cDNA strand, 2 units of E. coli RNaseH were added.
Finally, the mix was incubated at 37°C for 20 min.
PCR amplification of cDNA, subcloning and sequencing

Primers were designed to amplify the cDNA from
Csn1s1, Csn2 and Wap transcripts (Table 1). The primers were purchased from MWG Biotech (France). PCR

products were analyzed by electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide (0.1 μL/mL) in agarose gel
in tris/borate/EDTA buffer. The PCR products for Wap
and Csn2 were directly sequenced using primer pairs
used for PCR. The PCR products yielded for Csn1s1
were cloned in pCR®4-TOPO® plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 E. coli cells according
to the protocol supplied in the Kit for sequencing (Ref.
K4575-J10). Clones were tested by PCR, using M13
reverse and forward primers, and recombinant plasmids
were sequenced from both strands by GATC Biotech
(Konstanz, Germany).

Results
Analysis of the milk protein fraction at mid-lactation

The protein concentration of milks collected on the 10th
day of lactation from SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J mice differed significantly : 34 ± 9 g/L vs. 125 ± 12 g/L, respectively (Figure 1), being almost four times lower for SEG/
Pas than for C57BL/6J.
The RP-HPLC method previously described [10]
allowing protein polymorphism detection in Mus musculus strains was applied to compare the major protein

fraction of SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J milks. Elution profiles of the main milk proteins thus obtained are given
in Figure 2. The protein content of each peak was subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein bands
extracted from the gel were identified through PeptideMass Finger printing (PMF), using a MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometer. Depending on the mouse strain, b- and
as1-caseins as well as WAP exhibited different retention
times.
To assess that the chromatographic retention time differences are real and not due to experimental artifact,
milk samples were first analyzed in duplicate. Identical
elution patterns were recurrently obtained with the
same sample and with several individual milks, at the
same stage of lactation. b-casein and WAP from SEG/
Pas were eluted earlier than those from C57BL/6J. Two
isoforms of a s1 -casein were observed, as previously
described [10]. However, they showed a longer retention
time in SEG/Pas than those from C57BL/6J.
To further confirm and characterize such a protein
polymorphism, milk samples from C57BL/6J and SEG/
Pas were subsequently analysed by 2-DE (Figure 3). The
main spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. as1-, b- and g-caseins, as well as a-lactalbumin
and serum albumin displayed several spots in the gels.
Conversely, WAP was present as a single spot. The
major milk proteins were all identified, except -casein,
probably because this glycosylated protein has a pI
below 4.0 which was the lower limit of the IEF strip

used here. In SEG/Pas, WAP showed a different electrophoretic mobility, with a lower apparent pI and a higher
molecular mass, compared to C57BL/6J. Relative
proportions of a s1 -casein isoforms were also speciesdependent. In 2D gels, the minor as1 -casein isoforms
appeared to be in higher amount in SEG/Pas, whereas
the major a s1 -casein isoform was less abundant compared to C57BL/6J. This result was in accordance with
the chromatographic pattern shown in Figure 2. Finally,
2-DE analysis allowed highlighting a-lactalbumin, which
was not detected in our chromatographic analysis
conditions.
Evolution of major milk proteins over the lactation period

To test whether the overall major protein composition
varies over the lactation period in milk from SEG/Pas
and C57BL/6J, milk was collected from females at day
(d) 4, 8, and 14 after parturition. Skimmed milks were
analysed in SDS-PAGE. Mono dimensional electrophoresis patterns of proteins (Figure 4) at d4, d8 and d14
displayed no visual differences within strains, except for
-casein. In the SEG/Pas strain, at day 4, -casein
appeared as a diffused band, between 30 and 37 kDa.
This -casein form declined progressively, whereas a
sharper band (30 kDa) became predominant during the
second part of lactation (d14). By contrast, as far as
C57BL/6J milk is concerned, -casein appeared as a
more resolved and intense band at ca. 30 kDa, whatever
the stage of lactation and topped by a smear of which
the intensity increases with the lactation stage.

Clarified milk samples (100 μl; ca. 350 μg of proteins) were injected
on a Jupiter C5 Reverse Phase column (300 Å pore size, 5 μm,
150 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, Paris, France). The elution was
achieved by a two steps linear gradient: 100% A (TFA/H2O
1.1:1000 v/v) to 20% solvent B (TFA/CAN 1:1000 v/v) over 10 min
followed by 37% solvent B to 60% over 45 min at a flow rate of
1 ml/min. The column was kept at 40°C. Proteins showing a
different behavior between mouse species are indicated in pink.

To characterize Csn1s1 polymorphism, mRNAs encoding as1-casein were isolated from SEG/Pas and C57BL/
6J mammary glands, reverse transcribed, amplified, and
cloned. Clones showing inserts of different sizes were
selected and sequenced. Four Csn1s1 cDNAs were
found in each species. Figure 5 shows the transcripts
identified in SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J tissues together
with the intron/exon structure organization of the
mouse Csn1s1 gene. Full-length nucleotide sequences
of the SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J Csn1s1 mRNA were
determined (GenBank:GU983862 and GenBank:
NM_007784.2, respectively). Alignment of SEG/Pas
and C57BL/6J Csn1s1 cDNA sequences showed 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3’UTR
and 11 SNPs in the coding region; five of them correspond to amino acid substitutions (V53I, E124K,
L135F, Y231H, K293E) in the SEG/Pas strain. Three
internally deleted transcripts were identified from
C57BL/6J mammary gland. They corresponded to: (a)
cryptic splice site usages occurring within exon 8 (for
comparative purposes we adopted a generic exon numbering, valid for all species for which the CSN1S1

use then), leading to the deletion of its first codon
(CAG), and within exon 21 of which 57 nucleotides
are lost during the course of the primary transcript
processing; (b): skipping of exons 9 and 10; (c) skipping of exon 16.3. Likewise, two internally deleted
transcripts were also identified in SEG/Pas mammary
gland, due to the same cryptic splice site usages, leading to (a’) the loss of 57 nucleotides in exon 21; (b’)
deletion of the first codon (CAG) in exon 8 and exonskipping events affecting exons 9, 16.14 and 17. An
additional transcript, longer than the proper mRNA,
was also identified. This isoform results from insertion
of 33 nucleotides from the 3’ end of intron 10. None
of these deletions or insertion shifted the reading
frame, but the putative proteins encoded by these differentially spliced transcripts differ by their molecular
weights and potential phosphorylation sites (Table 2).
Altogether, these data reveal a “loud” polymorphism in
the Csn1s1 transcripts in both C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas
strains, giving rise to a large diversity of expression
products.

matured transcripts (Figure 5).

Csn2 polymorphism

Similarly, Csn2 transcripts encoding b-casein were isolated from the mammary gland of SEG/Pas and C57BL/
6J mice, reverse-transcribed to cDNA which were amplified and sequenced. Alignment of C57BL/6J and SEG/
Pas Csn2 cDNA sequences (GenBank:NM_009972-1 and
GenBank:GU734712, respectively) revealed the existence
of 3 SNPs in the 3’UTR and 7 SNPs in the coding
region, six leading to amino acid substitutions in the
SEG/Pas polypeptide chain (T134A, L152V, Q160E,
L174V, L181V and L208V), all occurring in exon 7 (Figure 6). Moreover, one additional transcript, showing a
deletion of the first CAG codon, encoding a glutaminyl
residue (Q41) in exon 6, was identified in both strains.
Wap gene polymorphism

Given the difference in electrophoresis mobility, the
polymorphism of the Wap gene was also investigated.
C57BL/6J cDNA encoding Wap sequenced in this work
is identical to the reference mRNA sequence available in
databases (GenBank:NM_011709.4). On the other hand,
as shown in Figure 7, the comparison with SEG/
Pas cDNA (provisory accession number GenBank:
GU734713) highlights 8 SNPs in the ca. 450 nucleotide

fragment that was sequenced. Six of them are located in
the coding region while 2 are in the 3’UTR. Three SNPs
are responsible for amino acid substitutions: K36E,
T94A and M99K. In addition, a 3 nucleotide deletion
occurring in the SEG/Pas sequence was shown to lead
to the loss of a serine residue at position 93 (ΔS93).
The predicted molecular weights (monoisotopic
masses) of C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas WAPs deduced
from nucleotide sequences are 12,432.61 and 12,313.57
Da, respectively (Table 3). Such a weak difference
(119.04 Da), due to amino acid substitution and deletion cannot account for the retarded electrophoretic
mobility observed with SEG/Pas WAP in mono (SDSPAGE) and 2D electrophoresis (Figures 4 and 3,
respectively). Even though there is no evidence for
post translational modifications of murine WAP in the
literature, this result suggested that post translational
modifications might occur in SEG/Pas WAP. To test
this hypothesis, the chromatographic fractions corresponding to WAP from C57BL/6J and from SEG/Pas
were collected and analysed on LTQ-Orbitrap mass
spectrometer. Native masses were 12,415.60 and
12,296.54 Da, for C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas, respectively.

above according to the one-letter code. Horizontal arrows indicate the position and orientation of primers used for amplification. Pink frames
show the SNP between C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas and blue frames indicate the translation-initiation and termination codon. Red amino acid
residues in SEG/Pas sequence represent amino acid substitutions (K36E, T94A, M99K); Δ represents the loss of the serine in position 93.

masses for WAP from C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas is 17.01
and 17.03 Da, respectively. This mass corresponds to
the formation of a pyroglutamic residue at the Nterminal position. In addition, the mass difference
recorded between SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J WAPs
(119.06 Da) is identical to the difference (119.04 Da)
between predicted molecular weights. Therefore, no
evidence for post-translational modifications of the
WAP from SEG/Pas was detected.

Discussion
Several technical approaches, including gel electrophoresis, RP-HPLC, mass spectrometry, cDNA cloning and
sequencing, allowed to get a detailed description of the
milk protein fraction across two mouse strains belonging to the Mus spretus or Mus musculus species. In this

manner, we first observed that the protein content
of Mus spretus milk is by far very low compared with
that of C57BL/6J. In addition, we identified several polymorphisms differentiating these two species, as well as
so far undescribed casein splice variants.
The protein content varies across mouse species

Piletz and Ganschow [12], in a comprehensive study,
have already reported that the milk protein concentration in fifty inbred strains of mice belonging to the Mus
musculus species ranges between 97 g/L (in the C3H/
HeJ strain) and 213.6 g/L (in the YEBT/Ha strain). Such
a strain effect, affecting more generally the concentration of all milk components, was also observed across
five Mus musculus strains [13], however to a less exent
(10% of the mean milk concentration). More recently,

Riley et al. showed that the protein concentrations in
QS5i and CBA milk are 87.6 ± 7.7 and 91.6 ± 8.9 g/L,
respectively [14]. Here, we show that the protein concentration in the milk of SEG/Pas mice was four folds
lower compared with C57BL/6J mice and therefore similar to the protein concentration previously reported in
PWK/Pas Mus m. musculus milk (32 ± 6 g/L) [10].
Thus, two strains recently introduced in animal facilities
and belonging to Mus spretus and Mus m. musculus,
display a much lower milk protein concentration by
comparison with the classical Mus m. domesticus subspecies. Therefore, the milk protein concentration
greatly varies between mouse species but also within
mouse species and between strains. The range of variation between mice is quite of the same order with that
observed in phylogenetically distant species, since the
concentration of milk proteins may account for more
than 200 g/L in some lagomorph species, whereas in
human milk, it does not exceed 10 g/L [15].
In distinct mouse strains, the composition of major milk
proteins varies over the lactation period

Within species only -casein showed evolution in electrophoresis pattern during the course of lactation, likely
corresponding to changes in the level of post-translational modifications (glycosylation). During the early
stages of lactation, the SEG/Pas -casein gave rise to an
indistinct band in SDS-PAGE suggesting some heterogeneity in the glycosylation level of the protein, as
reported in QSi5 and CBA Mus musculus strains [14].
This pattern progressively disappeared, to finally give
rise to a discrete band of a lower apparent molecular
weight. This is indicative of a less glycosylated form of
-casein in the second part of lactation. By contrast,
from the beginning of lactation the less glycosylated
form of C57BL/6J -casein was highly expressed compared with the other strains. In addition, we observed
that expression of ε-casein increased from the early
stages of lactation to reach a stabilized level at mid lactation (data not shown), as reported by Riley et al. [14].
Consistent with this, Rudolph et al observed low levels
of ε-casein mRNA between days 1 and 2, in contrast
with the expression of most milk protein genes [16].
Protein polymorphisms distinguish Mus spretus and Mus
m. domesticus milk

Of the nine major proteins from mouse milk three only,
namely as1-casein, b-casein and WAP, showed obvious
variations in electrophoretic mobility and/or chromatographic retention time between SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J,
reflecting variation in charge, hydrophobicity and
molecular weight. Sequencing cDNAs encoding Csn1s1,
Csn2 and Wap in both mouse species revealed differential splicing patterns and SNPs in coding sequences, of

Page 9 of 13

which some were responsible for amino acid substitutions. Most of the splicing variants, observed with casein
mRNAs, were shared by both C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas.
On the other hand, SNPs inducing amino acid substitutions are the most discriminating features to distinguish
SEG/Pas from C57BL/6J.
A polymorphism in the WAP encoding gene was suspected between C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas from chromatographic as well as 2D- and 1D-electrophoresis gel
behaviour. Indeed, the WAP variant in SEG/Pas is
remarkably slowed and ran as a smearing spot at a
molecular weight higher than expected from its amino
acid sequence. From the Wap transcripts sequences,
proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric
points (pI) are predicted: MW: 12,432.61/pI: 5.00 and
MW: 12,313.57/pI: 4.83 for the C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas
WAPs, respectively. The 119.04 Da difference in molecular weight cannot account for the dramatic difference
in mobility of the variants on SDS-PAGE gels, whereas
the horizontal shift observed in 2D electrophoresis
agrees with the 0.17 difference in isoelectric points.
Genetic polymorphisms across mouse strains have been
previously reported for the Wap gene. Indeed, WAP-A
and WAP-B are used to ascribe C57BL/6J and YBR variants, respectively [17]. The protein variant encoded by
WAP-B has one cysteine less and one arginine more
than the WAP-A variant. Comparison of C57BL/6J and
SEG/Pas Wap cDNA sequences revealed mutations
associated with 3 amino acid substitutions (K36E, T94A
and M99K; numbering of amino acid residues is that of
the pre-protein of C57BL/6J) and one amino acid deletion (ΔS93). Interestingly, the deletion of S93 together
with T94A and M99K substitutions provide a domain II
peptide sequence which is closer to the rat WAP than
to the C57BL/6J WAP [18]. Likewise, K36E substitution,
located within domain I, leads to an acidic residue (E or
D) that is conserved in most species, except for the Mus
musculus strains. Elsewhere, we found that the KSPT
(or ESPT) insertion in the C-terminus part of the rat
protein is due to incorporation of an intron sequence at
the splice site junction between exons 3 and 4. Since
these mutations in the SEG/Pas WAP are not located in
the four disulfide core (4-DSC) domains containing the
conserved cysteine residues, it is likely that they have
small effects, if any, on the three-dimensional structure
of the protein. Amino acid sequence of mouse WAPs
does not highlight any potential site for post-translational modifications, in contrast to pig WAP which,
from molecular weight considerations, appears to be glycosylated [19]. Neither WAP-A, nor the SEG/Pas WAP
stained positively with the periodic acidic-Schiff (data
not shown), suggesting that they are not glycosylated.
Moreover, Orbitrap mass spectrometer data confirmed
the absence of post-translational modifications in WAP

Boumahrou et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/80

from both strains. Thus the shift observed in 1D and 2D
electrophoresis gels between C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas
seems not to result from molecular mass alterations, but
rather reflects changes in protein conformation that
may affect the constant SDS/protein ratio or the shape
of the SDS-protein complex. Indeed, numerous studies
aimed at testing the sensitivity of electrophoresis in
detecting protein polymorphisms have shown that protein migration in SDS gels is often depending on their
shape which in turn varies with their conformation
[5,20,21]. WAP displays a lipoprotein-like structure,
although the amount of lipid associated with WAP is
heterogeneous [17]. Therefore, our hypothesis is that
the amount of associated lipid is higher in SEG/Pas
WAP than in WAP-A, thus impairing the expected
migration.
The Wap gene was also sequenced from strains 129/SvJ
[22] and GR (GenBank:MMU 38816) belonging to Mus
musculus species. WAP from 129/SvJ is identical to the
C57BL/6J WAP-A. By contrast, WAP from GR differs
from WAP-A by three amino acid substitutions (L11R,
P35Q and M90T), the first one being located in the signal
peptide. Thus, at least three WAP variants exist within
the Mus musculus species and one in Mus spretus (this
work). Following the nomenclature used by Hennighausen and Sippel [23], we propose to name WAPs from GR
and SEG/Pas WAP-C and D, respectively.
The frequency of SNPs in the coding region of Wap
cDNA from SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J was estimated to
1.76%. This frequency was only 0.5% within the coding
region of Wap from C57BL/6J and GR that belong to
the same Mus musculus species.
A comparison of C57BL/6J nucleotide sequences published for b- and a s1 -caseins with the C3H/HeN and
FVB/N mice strains sequences, respectively, did not
reveal any genetic polymorphism. By contrast, sequencing data provided here for C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas as1and b-caseins cDNA clearly show the existence of SNPs
in the coding regions, leading to 5/6 amino acid substitutions, as well as in the 3’UTRs.
Comparisons of coding and non coding (3’UTR)
orthologous milk protein genes in Mus musculus and
Mus spretus indicate that, on average, Mus spretus exhibits one SNP in every 60 to 100 bp and 20 to 50 bp,
respectively. We found that SNPs occur at higher frequencies in non-coding (3’UTR: 2.86%) than in coding
(1.3%) sequences in Csn1s1, Csn2 and Wap genes.
These results agree with previous data indicating that
SNPs occur at higher frequencies in non coding (2.2%
and 1.4% in introns and both 3’ and 5’UTRs, respectively) than in coding (0.6%) regions in Mus spretus [5].
However, the SNP frequencies in milk protein genes
reach twice the values reported at the whole genome
level. Comparing C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas, others have

Page 10 of 13

also estimated the polymorphism rate at the whole genome level to range between 1 and 2% [1,4].
Therefore, selection pressure seems to be lower on
milk protein genes than on the rest of the genome.
However, highly conserved hydrophobic domains and
multiple phosphorylation sites, identified both in as1and b-caseins, are less subjected to mutations, confirming functional constraints acting to conserve the overall
architecture of the corresponding molecules. Likewise,
despite a significant rate of polymorphism between
C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas, no mutations were detected in
the WAP 4-DSC domains that are essential for its structure and function.
as1-casein molecular diversity is mainly due to post
transcriptional modifications

RP-HPLC analyses were indicative of the existence of
several as1 -casein isoforms and polymorphisms, since
as1-caseins from C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas milks show different retention times. In a previous study [10], we
reported that the minor and the major isoforms of as1casein exhibited different chromatographic elution behaviour between milk from C57BL/6J and PWK/Pas mice.
Indeed, comparison of chromatographic profiles from
C57BL/6J, SEG/Pas and PWK/Pas, revealed that the two
as1-casein isoforms from C57BL/6J had a shorter retention time than the isoforms from PWK/Pas and SEG/
Pas milks. Despite they belong to different species, as1casein isoforms from PWK/Pas and SEG/Pas show a
similar chromatographic elution pattern.
Since tryptic peptide masses that allow the identification of as1-casein in both fractions did not distinguish
between isoforms, native masses of proteins contained
in each chromatographic fraction of a s1 -casein were
measured using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data
not shown). We obtained several masses ranging
between 31,800 and 35,000 Da which correspond to as1casein. However, it was not possible to assign the different isoforms identified from cDNA sequencing to the
molecular weights obtained, within each fraction. This
result suggests the existence of additional isoforms
including different phosphorylation levels. Such a
hypothesis is consistent with the electrophoresis (1D)
patterns of as1-casein chromatographic fractions which
were shown to contain at least two bands, either with
C57BL/6J or SEG/Pas milks (data not shown). Bands
from minor fractions migrate faster than those present
in the major fractions, thus suggesting that the former
contains the shortest variants (278+282 aa and 269+279
aa), whereas the major fraction contains the full-length
protein (298 aa) together with protein variants arising
from c (292 aa) or c’(309 aa) mRNA isoforms. Moreover, the partial deletion of exon 21 in isoforms a
(C57BL/6J) and a’ (SEG/Pas) should strongly modify its

Boumahrou et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:80

originated from skipping events during the processing
of the primary transcripts. The phenomenon has been
reported in small ruminants [26,30] and in humans
[29,36]. Regarding exons 9 and 10 which are alternatively skipped, “en bloc“ from the C57BL/6J mRNAs,
this could be explained, as far as exon 9 is concerned,
by weakness in the consensus sequence at the 3’
acceptor splice site of intron 8. However, there is no
obvious explanation for exon 10 skipping. Likewise, in
SEG/Pas, two exons (16.14 and 17) were simultaneously deleted. Since genomic sequences are not
available for Mus spretus, it is difficult to explain why
this kind of event may have occurred. Exon 16.3,
which is skipped in C57BL/6J, is located in a chromosomal region where major rearrangements have been
reported in the mouse genome (GenBank:NC_000071).
This is also the region where one can posit that exon
15 in cattle (generally in bovidae species) might have
resulted from the “exonisation” of a 24 nucleotides
intronic region located between exons 14 and 16, from
comparison of orthologous CSN1S1 genes between
several species. In mouse Csn1s1, there is a tandem
repeat of 14 copies of a 18 nucleotides exon (exon 14
in Rijnkels et al [37] and exon 16.1 in the numbering

chromatographic behaviour since the 19-aa deleted segment encodes a number of hydrophobic residues,
including 4 phenylalanyl (F68, F72, F77 and F83), 1 isoleucyl (I71) and 2 alanyl (A77 and A82) residues. This
large deletion is due to the usage of a cryptic splice site
occurring in exon 21, 57 nucleotides downstream from
an AG defining the proper end of intron 20, in frame
and following a rather strong polypyrimidine tract (n =
20) although interrupted by a triplet of contiguous G.
The same deletion was also reported in the as1-casein
from the mouse FVB/N strain (GenBank:AAH40246).
Even though such an event seems to be relatively rare, a
casual improper splicing using an exon cryptic splice
site and leading to the loss of 132 aa residues was also
reported in the equine CSN2 mRNA [24]. On the other
hand, the loss of a CAG, induced by an error-prone
junction sequence, is much more frequent. This defect
in accuracy was observed both with b-casein (already
mentioned in GenBank:AK021328) and for the first time
in as1-casein (this work). It leads casually to the loss of
a glutaminyl residue (Q) promoted by the nucleotide
sequence at the junction between intron 7 and exon 8
for Csn1s1 mRNAs and between intron 5 and exon 6
for Csn2 mRNAs. The mechanism by which AG defining the 3’ splice site is accurately and efficiently recognized involves a 5’ to 3’ scanning process [25]. The first
AG downstream of the branch point-polypyrimidine
tract is selected preferentially. However, the occurrence
of competitive AG, downstream from the proximal one,
can alternatively trigger its usage. The occurrence of a
tandem CAG triplet codon at an intron-exon junction
would be a facilitating feature. The casual deletion of
the CAG codon was first detected in casein-coding
genes in goat [26], and later in ovine [27], bovine and
water buffalo [28]. Such a splice-acceptor site slippage
was also reported in the human a s1 -casein [29,30].
Examples of insertion/deletion of Q are well documented and occur in all calcium-sensitive casein premRNAs, as well as in a number of other proteins in
mice and humans such as ABCG8 [31,32], IGF-1 receptor [33] and PAX3 [34]. More generally, alternative splicing at short-distance tandem site is widespread in
many species [35].
The insertion of 33 nucleotides upstream of exon 11
in Csn1s1 SEG/Pas is likely due to the usage of a cryptic
splice site. Since the relevant genomic sequence of Mus
spretus is not available yet, it is difficult to sustain such
an hypothesis. However, there is an imperfect polypyrimidine tract containing several purine bases in the
genomic sequence of Mus musculus, upstream from the
3’ acceptor cryptic splice site.
Additionally, several as1-casein isoforms identified in
C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas as splicing variants arise from
“clean” skipping of exon sequences. These isoforms

15 existing only in cattle, sheep and goats. The red intronic
segment (30 nucleotides) appears to be conserved between several
species (cattle, mice, pigs and humans). In addition in mice, there is
a 350-nucleotides insertion between exon 16.14 and 17,
contributing to enlarge this genome segment, as compared with
cow (3 kb vs. 2 kb).

adopted in Figure 5). Multiple alignments of genomic
sequences spanning the first to the third exon copy
suggest that this structure results from a first duplication event that involved exon 16 and a part of the
downstream intron (Figure. 8). Later, a subsequent tandem duplication of this basic motif might have
occurred seven times. This exon 16 which is present in
humans [29] camel, horse, guinea-pig and pig [30,37]
is also present in bovine [29]. It was shown to correspond to a short “virtual exon” occurring within intron
15 and surrounded by quite perfect consensus splice
sequences, except the 5’ donor splice site which is
absent in the bovine genome.
About 45 different genetic variants are expressed from
the 6 main bovine milk protein loci (Miranda et al.,
unpublished results) and considerable differences in allele
frequencies were observed among breeds. The situation is
still much more complex in less selected ruminants such
as goats in which ca. 35 alleles have been found at
CSN1S1 and CSN3 loci [30]. However, comparative analysis of the casein gene cluster genomic sequences across
species shows that the organization and orientation of
the genes is highly conserved. The conserved gene structure indicates that the molecular diversity of caseins is
primarily achieved through variable species-specific use
of exons (exon-skipping or differences in exon usage)
and high evolutionary divergence. Caseins are the most
divergent of the milk proteins with an average pairwise
percent identity ranging between 44 and 55% across placental mammals [38].
By contrast to the rapid evolution of casein genes previously put forth [39], milk protein genes in general
seemed to evolve more slowly than others in the bovine
genome, despite selective breeding for milk production.
The most conserved genes were those for proteins of the
milk fat globule membrane, suggesting that the mechanism for milk-fat secretion is essential. Diversity in milk
composition could not be explained by diversity of the
encoded milk proteins and although gene duplication may
contribute to species variation, this is not a major determinant [40]. Thus, other regulatory mechanisms must be
involved. For example, on the basis of analysis of the opossum genome, Mikkelsen et al [41] concluded that most of
the genomic diversity between marsupials and placental
mammals comes from non-coding sequences, arising from
sequence inserted by transposable elements.
Sharp et al. [42] proposed models for evolution of the
WAP gene in the mammalian lineage either through
exon loss from an ancient ancestor or by rapid evolution
via exon shuffling, whereas a functional WAP gene has
been lost in humans, cattle and goats.
The question remains however to know whether polymorphisms of milk proteins is larger between mice inbred
strains than between breeds of ruminants for example?

Conclusions
Of the nine mouse milk major proteins, only three
showed variations in chromatographic retention time
(as1-casein, b-casein and WAP) or electrophoretic mobility (WAP) between mice species.
Considering the high frequency of SNPs between
C57BL/6J and SEG/Pas, most of the other major milk
proteins might be also affected by single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs). Our hypothesis is that most of the
SAPs have no consequences on the structural properties
of proteins, and therefore result in “silent” polymorphism
not detected by electrophoresis or chromatographic
methods used.
Our results also revealed different known alternative
splicing mechanisms giving rise to a large diversity of
proteins of different molecular weights, isoelectric points
and hydrophobicities within each mouse strains.
