Abstract
Background: In order to estimate whether multi-spacer typing (MST), based on the sequencing
of variable intergenic spacers, could serve for the identification of Rickettsia at the species level, we
applied it to 108 rickettsial isolates or arthropod amplicons that include representatives of 23 valid
Rickettsia species.
Results: MST combining the dksA-xerC, mppA-purC, and rpmE-tRNAfMet spacer sequences identified
61 genotypes, allowing the differentiation of each species by at least one distinct genotype. In
addition, MST was discriminatory at the strain level in six species for which several isolates or
arthropod amplicons were available.
Conclusion: MST proved to be a reproducible and high-resolution genotyping method allowing
clear identification of rickettsial isolates at the species level and further additional differentiation of
strains within some species.

Background
Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular, Gram-negative bacteria, the vectors and reservoirs of which are mainly arthropods, although they may also infect vertebrate hosts [1].
Currently, the genus Rickettsia contains 24 validated species, 22 of which are classified into 2 groups: i) the typhus
group including R. prowazekii [2] and R. typhi [3]; and
ii)the spotted fever group made of R. rickettsii [4], R.
conorii [5], R. africae [6], R. sibirica [7], R. slovaca [8], R.
honei [9], R. japonica [10], R. australis [11], R. akari [12], R.
felis [13], R. aeschlimannii [14], R. helvetica [15], R. massiliae [16], R. rhipicephali [17], R. montanensis [18], R. parkeri
[19], R. heilongjiangensis [20], R. tamurae [21], R. asiatica
[22], and R. peacockii [23]. Among spotted fever rickettsiae, R. peacockii is the only validated species for which no
established strain is available. Two additional species, i.e.,

R. bellii [24] and R. canadensis [25], initially classified
within a third group named "ancestral group" [26], may
not belong to a single group [20] but lie outside from the
former two groups. In addition to the 24 recognized species, more than 20 rickettsial isolates which have not been
fully characterized or have not received a species designation, have been described and their current classification
is uncertain [27].
Various DNA-based techniques have been developed for
the species identification of rickettsiae. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences have frequently been used, but since the sequences are highly
conserved, significant inferences about intragenus phylogeny are not possible [1,28]. In recent years, several genes
have been sequenced for most of the known rickettsial

isolates, including the citrate synthase – encoding gene
(gltA) [29], and the Rickettsia-specific ompA [30], ompB
[31], sca1 [32], sca2 [33], and sca4 [34] genes, encoding
autotransporter proteins. The usefulness of DNA taxonomy has been recognized for living organisms [35] and
Maiden et al. [36] have demonstrated the usefulness of
multiple gene sequencing for prokaryotic taxonomy.
Using multi-gene sequencing, we proposed gene
sequence-based criteria for the identification of rickettsial
isolates at the genus, group and species levels [20]. However, we observed that such a method lacks intra species
discriminatory power [37]. As a consequence, there is no
current method that both identifies rickettsiae at the species and strain levels, and produces results that are reproducible and comparable among laboratories.
Recently, we developed a new genotyping tool named
Multi-Spacer Typing (MST), based on the assumption that
intergenic spacers, which are less subject to evolutionary
pressure than coding sequences, would be more appropriate for typing bacteria at the strain level than genes [37].
We demonstrated that MST using three intergenic spacers
was suitable for typing R. conorii (31 genotypes among 42
tested strains), R. sibirica (3 genotypes among 14 tested
strains), and R. prowazekii (4 genotypes among 15 studied
strains) at the strain level, and produced species-specific
signatures [37-39]. Herein, we hypothesized that the three
intergenic spacers successfully used for R. conorii, being
also present in R. sibirica and R. prowazekii, could also
exhibit species-specific signatures in other Rickettsia species. Thus, in order to estimate the suitability of MST for
identifying rickettsiae at the species level, we applied it to

Additional file 1].

Results
PCR amplification and sequencing
The dksA-xerC, mppA-purC, and rpmE-tRNAfMet intergenic
spacers were amplified from all the strains of Rickettsia
studied except R. canadensis and R. bellii, for which the
mppA-purC spacer PCR could not amplify any fragment.

The size of the dksA-xerC spacer ranged from 92 for R.
prowazekii to 687-bp for R. montanensis. Depending on
species and strains, the dksA-xerC spacer was made of 31
different repeats named R1 to R31 that varied in size, from
25- to 107-bp, in number and in arrangement. The repeats
were classified into two groups depending on their sizes,
from 25- to 65-bp for the first group which includes 9 different repeats, and 86- to 107-bp for the second group.
Sequences of both groups share a highly conserved 5'part, and differ in their 3'-end. The sequences of these
repeats are shown in Figure 1; and their repartition within
the different Rickettsia strains reported in Additional file 2.
Overall, the dksA-xerC spacer allowed the identification of
42 different genotypes. These included 19 genotypes
within the R. conorii species, two within the R. felis species,
three within the R. sibirica species, and two within the R.
slovaca species. Other species each exhibited a unique
dksA-xerC spacer sequence, except R. africae which had the
same sequence as R. conorii subsp. Caspia isolate Chad, R.
parkeri which had the same sequence as R. conorii subsp.
Caspia isolate A-167, and R. massiliae which had the same
sequence as R. rhipicephali.

MppA-purC amplicons ranged from 80-bp for R. akari to
180-bp for R. felis. The degree of pairwise nucleotide
sequence similarity ranged from 50.5% between R. conorii
and R. felis to 100% between R. honei and R. africae or R.
helvetica and R. tamurae. Using the BLAST software, we
identified, within mppA-purC spacer sequences, the presence of a 25- to 102-bp Rickettsia palindromic element,
depending on species, that has a high degree of similarity
with the Rickettsia palindromic element 1 (RPE-1) family
[40,41]. Thirty-one distinct genotypes were identified
among mppA-purC spacer sequences [see Additional file
2]. R. conorii strains were classified into eight genotypes, R.
felis strains and amplicons into three genotypes, R. massiliae strains and amplicons into two genotypes, R. sibrica
strains into three genotypes, and R. slovaca strain and
amplicons into two genotypes. Each of the other species
had a unique mppA-purC genotype, with the exception of
R. africae, which exhibited the same genotype as R. honei,
and R. asiatica and R. tamurae which exhibited the same
genotype as R. helvetica.
The size of the rpmE-tRNAfMet spacer sequence ranged
from 175 for R. typhi to 402-bp for R. asiatica. The degree
of pairwise nucleotide sequence similarity ranged from
69.6% between R. typhi and R. aeschlimannii to 100%
between R. honei and R. africae. Using the BLAST software,
we identified, within rpmE-tRNAfMet spacer sequences, the
presence of a Rickettsia palindromic element that has a
high degree of similarity with the Rickettsia palindromic
element 2 (RPE-2) family [40,41]. Twenty-nine distinct
genotypes were identified among rpmE-tRNAfMet spacer
sequences [see Additional file 2]. R. conorii strains were
classified into four genotypes, R. felis strain and amplicons
into two genotypes, R. prowazekii strains and amplicons
into three genotypes, and R. sibirica strains into two genotypes. Each of the other species exhibited a unique rpmEtRNAfMet spacer sequence, except R. africae and R. honei,
which had the same sequence.
MST genotyping
By combining the genotypes obtained from the three
intergenic spacers we studied, we identified 61 MST genotypes among the 108 strains and arthropod amplicons.
Thirty-one MST genotypes were identified within the R.
conorii species, three within R. felis, two within R. massiliae, three within R. prowazekii, three within R. sibirica, and
three within R. slovaca. Each other studied species had a
unique MST genotype. Each Rickettsia species was identified on the basis of a specific dksA-xerC sequence except
for R. africae, R. conorii subsp. Caspia, R. massiliae, R. parkeri and R. rhipicephali for which the three spacer sequences
were necessary.

Discussion
The ability to differentiate bacteria beyond the species
level is essential for identifying and tracking infectious
disease outbreaks and to improve our knowledge of the
population genetics, epidemiology, and ecology of bacterial pathogens. In the past decades, a variety of phenotypic
and genotypic methods have been used for microbial typing, identification, and classification. Commonly used
subtyping methods, such as serotyping, phage typing,
ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, are timeconsuming. PCR and DNA sequence-based typing methods have emerged as the most rapid, reliable, and simple
ways to characterize and type microorganisms and can
reduce interpretation ambiguity. To be reliable, a typing
method should not be influenced by sequence variations
that would occur during culture passage.
Rickettsia species, as intracellular bacteria, undergo lower
rates of genomic changes than extracellular bacteria, and
their genomes, with the exception of R. bellii [42], are
highly collinear [42-46]. As a consequence, intergenic
spacers, previously demonstrated to be more variable
than coding sequences [37], are a valuable target for genotyping these bacteria. The most widely used intergenic
spacer in bacteria, i. e., 16S–23S rRNA, is not useable in
Rickettsia species as both genes are not contiguous [44].
We have previously demonstrated the versatility of MST
by applying it to several bacterial species in addition to
rickettsiae, including Yersinia pestis [47], Coxiella burnetii
[48], Bartonella quintana [49] and Bartonella henselae [50].
For rickettsiae, we have demonstrated that it is insensitive
to culture passage in both R. conorii and R. prowazekii
[37,38]. This makes MST a reliable typing method for
strain tracing. The three intergenic spacers used in our
study were previously selected among the most variable
intergenic spacers conserved in both the R. conorii and R.
prowazekii genomes [37]. We could detect the three spacers in all studied rickettsial strains and arthropod amplicons except for the mppA-purC spacer that could not be
found in R. canadensis and R. bellii. This was explained in
the latter species by the fact that the mppA and purC genes
are not contiguous in the genome [42]. To date, only one
gene, i. e., sca1, a member of the sca-family of auto-transporter genes, has been found in all Rickettsia species [32].
However, this gene was shown to be discriminatory at the
species level but not at the intra-species level. In contrast,
MST identified 61 distinct genotypes that include genotypes specific of each of the 23 studied species. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first reproducible method
that allows identification of rickettsiae at the species and
strain levels and can be applied to both isolates and clinical or arthropod specimens. In addition to the previously
studied R. conorii, R. prowazekii and R. sibirica species for
which MST has demonstrated intra-species variability, we
showed that this method was also discriminatory for R.

felis, R. massiliae, and R. slovaca strains and amplicons.
Therefore, the discriminatory power of MST was highly
correlated to the analyzed species. For R. africae, for which
a large number of strains and tick amplicons from various
geographic origins were tested, this lower genetic diversity
may reflect a more recent emergence of this species than
R. conorii. However, we cannot exclude that the observed
differences could be due to a bias in specimen selection.
We identified repeated elements within the three studied
spacers. The high density of repeated sequences appears to
be a characteristic of Rickettsia genomes [40,41,45]. These
repeated sequences are classified into several categories.
The most remarkable of these elements are the RPEs,
which represent 3.2% of the R. conorii genome [41]. The
RPEs identified within the mppA-purC and rpmE-tRNAfMet
spacers belong to the RPE-1 and RPE-2 families, respectively. Although usually confined to intergenic regions in
prokaryotes [51], some RPE families, including the RPE-1
and RPE-2 families, are also found inserted in-frame
within genes in Rickettsia genomes [41,45]. Their exact
function at that location is unknown but it has been suggested that they may play a role in the creation and the
modification of proteins [41]. The presence of RPEs in the
studied intergenic spacers may in part explain their high
rate of interspecies nucleotide variability.
Within the third intergenic spacer, i.e., dksA-xerC, we have
previously identified a second category of repeated elements named variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTRs). These repeats are present at a single genomic
locus and show interindividual length variability [51].
Such VNTRs are recognized in eukaryotes as source of
DNA variability [52], and are also described in bacteria,
where they are found within genes and mainly play a role
in implementing size variation of membrane-associated
proteins. Such a location is found within the ompA gene in
rickettsiae. The main characteristic of the VNTRs herein
described is their unusual presence within a non-coding
sequence. We identified 31 repeat types, classified into
two groups depending on their sizes. Another feature of
these VNTRs is that their number and arrangement vary
depending on strains and species, from a single repeat to
10 repeats. Such a variability makes the dksA-xerC the
most discriminatory of the three spacers, with 42 genotypes identified. In a recent work, Vitorino et al. proposed
that PCR amplification of VNTRs within the dksA-xerC
might serve to identify rickettsial isolates [53]. However,
these authors only took into account the size of the
VNTRs, not their sequence variability. Using optimal conditions of electrophoresis resolution that would discriminate size differences of 1-bp, which may be difficult to
achieve in routine laboratories, PCR amplification of
VNTRs would discriminate only 22 different types among
our 42 dksA-xerC genotypes. As an example, this would

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/72

not differentiate R. felis from R. massiliae and R. helvetica,
all three being recognized or suspected human pathogens.
This supports the MST method that relies on DNA
sequences.

Conclusion
MST using the dksA-xerC, mppA-purC, and rpmE-tRNAfMet
intergenic spacers is an efficient and reproducible typing
method able to identify 23 validated Rickettsia species. It
also allows the discrimination at the strain level in six species. Thus, it constitutes a powerful tool for identification
of these bacteria, in particular within clinical specimens.

Methods
Rickettsial strains or PCR amplicons
The strains or PCR amplicons used in this study are listed
in Additional file 1. Rickettsial strains were propagated at
32°C on Vero cell (ATCC CRL-1587) monolayers in
Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM, Seromed, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum
(Seromed) and 2 mM glutamine. When cells stained with
Gimenez were heavily infected (3 to 5 days), the cultures
were harvested, centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in MEM and stored at -70°C until processed further.

For the three Rickettsia species previously studied by MST,
we included a representative strain of each distinct genotype, i.e., 27 strains for R. conorii subsp. conorii [37], two
for R. conorii subsp. caspia, and one each for R. conorii
subsp. indica and R. conorii subsp. israelensis [54]; one
strain for R. sibirica subsp. sibirica, and two for R. sibirica
subsp. mongolitimonae [39]; and two strains and a louse
amplicon for R. prowazekii [38].
For the other 20 valid Rickettsia species studied, we
included a minimum of one strain and, when available,
several strains and/or arthropod amplicons [see Additional file 1]. These extra-strains or arthropod amplicons
had been identified using gltA and ompB gene amplification and sequencing as previously described [28,29]. All
studied strains are detailed in Additional file 1.
PCR amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from rickettsial cultures
using the QIAamp Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We
used the primers dksAF: 5'-TCCCATAGGTAATTTAGGTGTTTC-3' and dksAR: 5'-TACTACCGCATATCCAATTAAAAA-3', mppAF: 5'-GCAATTATCGGTCCGAATG-3'
and mppAR: 5'-TTTCATTTATTTGTCTCAAAATTCA-3', and
rpmEF: 5'-TTCCGGAAATGTAGTAAATCAATC-3' and
rpmER: 5'-TCAGGTTATGAGCCTGACGA-3', to amplify
the intergenic spacers dksA-xerC, mppA-purC, and rpmEtRNAfMet, respectively. The primers were obtained from

Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). PCR reactions were carried out in a PTC-200 automated thermal-cycler (MJ
Research, Waltham, Mass.) using the previously described
conditions [37]. PCR products were purified using a
QIAquick Spin PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) as
described by the manufacturer. Sequencing reactions were
carried out using the d-Rhodamine Terminator cycle
sequencing ready reaction kit with Amplitaq Polymerase
FS (Applied Biosystems, Coignieres, France) as described
by the manufacturer. For all PCR products, sequences
from both DNA strands were determined twice. Sequencing products were resolved using an ABI 3100 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was
performed using the software package ABI Prism DNA
Sequencing Analysis Software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). Sterile water was used as a negative control in
each assay.
Sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers detailed in Additional file 1.
