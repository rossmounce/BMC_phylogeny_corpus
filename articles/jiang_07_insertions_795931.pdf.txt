Abstract
Background: In protein evolution, the mechanism of the emergence of novel protein domain is
still an open question. The incremental growth of protein variable regions, which was produced by
stochastic insertions, has the potential to generate large and complex sub-structures. In this study,
a deterministic methodology is proposed to reconstruct phylogenies from protein structures, and
to infer insertion events in protein evolution. The analysis was performed on a broad range of
SCOP domain families.
Results: Phylogenies were reconstructed from protein 3D structural data. The phylogenetic trees
were used to infer ancestral structures with a consensus method. From these ancestral
reconstructions, 42.7% of the observed insertions are nested insertions, which locate in previous
insert regions. The average size of inserts tends to increase with the insert rank or total number
of insertions in the variable regions. We found that the structures of some nested inserts show
complex or even domain-like fold patterns with helices, strands and loops. Furthermore, a basal
level of structural innovation was found in inserts which displayed a significant structural similarity
exclusively to themselves. The β-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase domain family is provided as
an example to illustrate the inference of insertion events, and how the incremental growth of a
variable region is capable to generate novel structural patterns.
Conclusion: Using 3D data, we proposed a method to reconstruct phylogenies. We applied the
method to reconstruct the sequences of insertion events leading to the emergence of potentially
novel structural elements within existing protein domains. The results suggest that structural
innovation is possible via the stochastic process of insertions and rapid evolution within variable
regions where inserts tend to be nested. We also demonstrate that the structure-based phylogeny
enables the study of new questions relating to the evolution of protein domain and biological
function.

Background
The majority of protein folds descend from a relatively
small set of ancestral domains through divergent evolution [1-4]. The mechanism by which new structures

emerge or evolve from existing proteins is still an open
question. Unlike sequence evolution, the drift of the core
of a domain structure is unlikely be stable and functional.
Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that structural

innovation is more likely to be the result of evolution at
the periphery of the conserved core of domains. A recent
study about the indels in protein sequences found that the
fraction of domains and individual unaligned regions
increasing in size is almost twofold larger than the fraction decreasing in size [5]. Ancient domain families show
bias towards insertions in the variable region which grow
in size [5]. In comparison with deletions, a succession of
insertions and rapid evolution appears to be a reasonable
process that could lead to the emergence of novel protein
architectures [2,6,7]. Determining the extent and the
mechanism of emergence of protein structure is difficult
because observations are limited to extant protein folds.
The evolution of sub-structures over time must then be
inferred from this limited information.
Because of a high degree of inter-residue dependence, protein structures evolve much more slowly than their
sequences [8]. These structural constraints are relaxed in
some parts of protein structures; these are typically surface
loops where mutations, insertions, and deletions can
occur with lesser consequences to the biological function
for which a gene is selected. It was observed that the probability of observing insertions and deletions in a pairwise
alignment of protein sequences correlates with their evolutionary distance [9,10]. The study of structural similarity
of loop regions in homologous proteins also observed a
linear correlation between sequence and structural similarities [11]. These observations are consistent with the
assumption that insertion and deletion events are continuous processes that parallel the better characterized process of substitution.
Incremental change in loops through insertion or deletion
is a possible mechanism that can generate new polypeptidic folds [6]. The proposed model of emergence assumes
that regions with faster evolutionary rates, such as surface
loops, are the most probable locations for the occurrence
of rare events. As proteins evolve, insertions can accumulate in these loop regions without affecting the folding of
the core structure. Unless an insert is eliminated by purifying selection, multiple and nested insertions will make
surface loops appear to grow over time. These variable
regions have the ability to explore the conformational
space and thus acquire novel sub-structures. Subsequently, a fraction of novel structural features generated
via this process can be positively selected, and eventually
become independently folding units (e.g. domains).
The key element leading to structural emergence under
the proposed model is thus the extension of surface loops
into nascent substructures. Testing this model requires to
infer the sequence of events (phylogenies) leading to
structural variability in protein structures. A series of efficient and robust tools were developed to produce struc-

ture-based phylogenies of protein domains and high
quality structure-based multiple sequence alignments.
Phylogenetics usually relies on the signal in biological
sequences to infer the evolution of a gene. The tertiary
structure of a protein evolves much slower than its
sequence, and potentially contains a phylogenetic signal
which is likely to persist beyond the timeframe where
sequence signal becomes saturated.
The structure-based phylogenetic method utilizes a distance measure QH [12,13] to compute trees using the
Neighbor-Joining algorithm [14]. We also developed a
method to build the structure-based multiple sequence
alignments. This tool is derived from a multiple sequence
alignment method proposed by Casbon and Saqi [15],
which generates multiple structure-based alignment by
running T-Coffee [16] to perform hierarchical alignment
using information from the pairwise structural alignments. In this work, we used the application Flexible
structure AlignmentT by Chaining Aligned fragment pairs
with Twists (FATCAT) [17] to produce the pairwise alignments. According to the results presented in this work, the
trees inferred with QH distances are consistent with results
of sequence-based methods. The structure-based phylogenetic method is efficient and robust. Because the sequence
identity amongst domain families is often low, the structure-based phylogenies are also more suitable for this
study than sequence-based phylogenetic methods.
This work used the structure-based phylogenies to infer a
possible sequence of insertion events leading to the extant
domain structures. The objective was to assess whether
complex and novel protein structures can arise through
the incremental growth of variable regions in protein
domains. The analyses were performed on a large test set
of homologous proteins built from Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database [18]. The study revealed
a large portion of insertions are bounded by earlier insertions in the variable regions of protein domains. We demonstrate that the average size of inserts created by nested
insertions is substantially larger than block inserts. We
analyzed the conformations of inserts, and found some
structures of nested inserts show complex or even
domain-like fold patterns including helices, strands and
loops. The β-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase domain
family was used as an example to illustrate the inference
of insertion events, and how the incremental growth of a
variable region is capable to generate novel structures.

Results
Statistics of insertions
The results of the quantitative study of insertions are listed
in Table 1. In the test set, 98% of domain families belong
to the four SCOP classes all α, all β, α/β, and α+β. The
detected insertions are not evenly distributed in the four

classes. The amount of insertions in all β class is significantly larger than all α class. All α class has 97 families,
753 domains, and 796 inserts. For all β class, there are 114
families, 937 domains, and 1788 inserts. The size of all β
class is slightly bigger than all α class. Whereas the inserts
detected in all β class are almost twice as many as the
inserts of all α class. The numbers of insert-containing
regions per domain for all α, all β, α/β, and α+β classes are
1.1, 1.9, 3.1, and 1.5, respectively. The results indicate that
domains from SCOP class α/β have more variable regions
on average than those from other three classes.
Our method detected 7356 insert-containing regions,
including 5555 block insertions and 1801 nested insertions. There are a total of 9691 insertions with size >1
observed in the 7356 inserts, in which 5555 are block
insertions and 4136 insertions are nested. A total of 211
out of 447 families contained lineages with nested insertions. Consequently, our analysis of SCOP family test sets
found that 24.5% of all insert-containing regions have at
least one nested insertion while the remaining proportion
are inserts that appear to have been inserted in a single
step (block insertion). Overall, 42.7% of the inferred
insertion events are those nested into an insert region. The
addition of more homologous domains in a given family
is likely to divide some of the block insertions into nested
insertions. This, in turn, will increase the number of
observations of nested insertions, although it is impossible to determine how much this would affect the net proportion of these two types of inserts.
The distributions of insert rank and size were analyzed.
The distribution of insert rank of the insert-containing
regions fits an exponential decay (Figure 1). The total
numbers of inserts with rank from 1 to 6 are 5555, 1378,
331, 77, 11, and 4, respectively. Four domains have maximal insert rank 6. They are domains d1gw0a3, d1aoza3,
and d1gska3 from the multidomain cupredoxins family,
and d1qhoa4 from the amylase family. Figure 2 shows the
distributions of insert size with insert rank. The average
sizes of inserts with rank ranging from 1 to 6 are 5.5, 14.3,

23.8, 35.9, 42, and 31, respectively. Despite the average
size for inserts with rank 6, which were calculated from a
small portion of samples, the insert size tends to increase
with the insert rank. The observations are consistent with
the model that variable regions of a protein appear to
"grow" because of the accumulation of nested insertions.
The inserted protein segments generated by the nested
insertions are much longer than the block inserts. The
average size of nested inserts with rank >1 is 17.2 residues
long, whereas the average size of block inserts is 5.5. It
indicates that block insertions, by virtue of their length,
are less likely to be the site of structural innovation.
Insertions produce complex sub-structure
To investigate whether insertions can create novel protein
structure, structural complexity and novelty analyses were

tures, and 30 nested inserts were identified as novel out of
a set of 80 complex nested inserts. The nested insertions
produced about twice as many novel structures as the
block insertions. This is in part because nested inserts are
averagely longer, and because stabilizing substitutions
can accumulate between insertion events to stabilize the
intermediate structures. It should be noted that some
observed large complex 'block' inserts could be the product of nested insertions but there were not enough structures in the analysis to permit their identification.

performed on a large dataset of protein domains. Our
functional definition of complexity is when the p-value of
the alignment of a segment to itself is below a significance
threshold. Our functional definition of novelty is when a
segment is complex and does not align with any other
polypeptide segments other than itself. The screening of
all identified inserts identified 77 complex block inserts
and 80 complex nested inserts. The properties of the complex inserts are given in Table 2. The complex inserts were
classified by their secondary structural content as Helices,
Helices+Strands, Strands, and Loops. In comparison to
the nested inserts, the secondary structures of the complex
block inserts have more Loops and less Helices+Strands
local conformations. The average size of the complex
block inserts is 41 residues, which is smaller than the average 53 residues of the complex nested inserts. By comparing the complex inserts with domains from other
superfamilies in the ASTRAL SCOP 1.69 subset, 17 out of
77 complex block inserts were identified as novel struc-

Several representative inserts (insert region only) are
shown in Figure 3 as examples of the structures produced
by incremental growth through nested insertion events.
The insert structures were colored with the mapping
method described in the methodology section. The color,
scaled from blue to red, indicates the insert rank to which
each site is classified. For the colored inserts, the more
blue intensive color implies the earlier the ancestral insertion event. This illustrates how incremental growth within
variable region is capable to generate complex structural
patterns.
It is much more difficult to demonstrate that existing
domains have emerged via this mechanism. Evidence that
a given domain in a gene is significantly similar to an
insert-nesting variable region in an unrelated gene would
constitute a demonstration that these novel folds can be
propagated through the proteome. However, it is fair to
assume that most common domains are relatively ancient
and that structural intermediates are thus unlikely to exist
to this day. The analysis of distant but evolutionarily
related protein folds may provide further insight into this
possibility.
An example of the growth of variable region via stepwise
nested insertions

observed in the β-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase family (The sequence based phylogenetic tree is provided in

before with structure-based phylogenetic method because
sequence similarity amongst these domains is too low to
be aligned with confidence [19]. The domain d1ci9a_ is a
novel esterase isolated from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB)
with high deacetylation activity on cephalosporins [20].
Unlike other esterases, the protein is homologous to penicillin binding proteins, notably class C β-lactamases and
D-alanyl-D-alanine-transpeptidases
(DD-peptidases)
[20,21].
A novel nested insert was discovered on the EstB domain
with insert rank of 3. The multiple sequence alignment of

the variable region of all domains is given in Figure 4(a).
The multiple structural alignment in Figure 4(b) shows
the structural variation of different domains in the region.
The structure-based phylogenetic tree of the family was
built, and the insertions of d1ci9a_ were detected by comparing the structural consensus. The nested insertions of
d1ci9a_ are color mapped according to the insert rank as
shown in Figure 4(c). In Figure 5, the structure-based phylogenetic tree of the family was rooted with a domain
d1u60a from the Glutaminase family, which also belongs
to the β-lactamase/transpeptidase-like superfamily. The

common structures of clades marked with circles. C1 represents the ancestor and thus the core structure of the βlactamase family. The inserts are shown in blue: By comparing the structures of C1 and C2, the first large insert can
be identified as a segment with a small β hairpin and a
short helix. In Figure 4(c), the insert is indicated in green
on the d1ci9a_ variable region. From C2 to C3, the loop
between the two β strands of the first insert region grows
longer. This is the second nested insertion
(d1ci9a_:233–237), the yellow segment in Figure 4(c).
The third nested insert is an extra β-hairpin
(d1ci9a_:242–261) of the EstB domain, which is red in
Figure 4(c). It was inserted into the same variable region
subsequently to the first hairpin insert in C3.

Phylogenetic consistency of signal
To validate the phylogeny and nested insertion events
inferred with structure-based method, we also performed
sequence-based phylogenetic analysis using the structurebased multiple sequence alignment (see Figure 6 and
additional file 1). The unrooted sequence-based and
structure-based trees are similar, and the stepwise growth
of the same variable region is also detected in the
sequence-based phylogeny. The topologies of the consensus trees inferred from bootstrap with distance method
and the maximum likelihood method PHYML are consistent. A sequence-based phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 6, and the confidence values of branches produced
with bootstrap method in 1000 replicates is also shown.
The main difference between the structure-based and
sequence-based trees is the location of root. Given the

inherent low sequence similarity within this dataset, a
consistent "rooting" of this tree is not expected. The consensus structures of the node list from root C1 to d1ci9a
suggest the iterative growth of the variable region along
the path within the structure-based phylogeny (Figure 5).
The consensus structures C1, C2, and C3 and their
sequence in the node list of sequence-based phylogeny are
the same as those of structure-based method. The
sequence of ancestral consensus structures indicates a
probable sequence of insertion events on the evolutionary
path from root to the domain d1ci9a.
The EstB has a structural homology to β-lactamase, but
shows no β-lactamase activity even though the nature and
arrangement of active-site residues is very similar between
EstB and the homologous β-lactamase. Modeling studies

suggested steric factors account for the enzyme's selectivity for ester hydrolysis versus β-lactam cleavage [21]. One
of the steric factors comes from the nested insert. The
insert hairpin covers part of the active site entrance in
EstB, which may affect the enzyme's selectivity by narrowing the access path to the active site tunnel. The stepwise
nested insertions observed in the evolution of EstB demonstrate that the stepwise nested insertions can create
novel complex sub-structure and affect the function of
protein.

Discussion
Applicability of the structure-based phylogenetic method
For sequence-based phylogeny, manual editing of alignments is necessary to remove variable/gapped regions,
and most methods cannot provide a reliable tree when the

based methods. However, it is important to note that consistency with sequence-based phylogeny in difficult cases
does not constitute a definitive proof of the suitability of
QH at capturing phylogenetic distances.

similarity amongst sequences is low. In contrast with
sequence phylogenies, the substructures of a protein
which are not suitable for sequence-based phylogeny
actually constitute a source of phylogenetic signal. The
structure-based phylogeny is thus expected to be more
robust than sequence-based methods when domains in a
family have low to very-low sequence similarities and
regions which cannot be unambiguously aligned.

Effect of flexible structural alignment
Many programs for the alignment of protein structures
have been developed. Most structural alignment methods,
such as CE [25] and DALI [26], assume that protein molecules are rigid bodies. This assumption is made despite
the knowledge that many proteins are flexible molecules.
The validity of the rigid body assumption is further questionable for variable regions since it is usually more flexible than the conserved core of the structure. When flexible
molecules in different conformations are compared to
each other as rigid bodies, even strong structural similarities can be missed. Several flexible structural alignment
algorithms including FlexProt [27] and FATCAT [17] have
been developed to solve the problem. In this study, flexible structural alignment method FATCAT was used to generate the pairwise structural alignment.

The SCOP database contains families with low sequence
identity (<30%) despite having very close structures and
functions [18]. These families are appropriate for tertiary
structure phylogeny because more distant homologs usually have more insertions and structural variations. Several
works have utilized structure-based methods to study
these SCOP families with low sequence homology,
including the β-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase family
[19], the Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)-like
family [22], and the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases
family [23].
The structure-based distance metrics used in this work
provide a reasonable estimate of phylogenetic distance.
Several protein structural distance measures, including
Root Mean Square Distances (RMSD) [19], and Hausdorff
distance of loops [11,24], and QH [12,13], have been
applied to phylogenetic analysis. The distance metric QH
adopted in this work, which considers the differences of
the aligned segments and the non-aligned gap regions
simultaneously, has been successfully applied to study the
evolution of structures in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
[12], and has been built into the molecular modeling software VMD since version 1.8.3. Based on previous work
and our results, the topologies of trees inferred with QH
distance are generally consistent with results of sequence-

A

Because the information used for phylogeny relies on
structural distances, a reliable alignment of regions with
higher structural variability is very important. Although
some sub-structures may be homologs, the presence of a
flexible hinge may cause a rigid body structural alignment
method to fail to detect similarity. The structural alignment of protein 2ak3 and 1aky is such a case. The flexible
regions of 2ak3 (125–161) and 1aky (131–168) have similar conformations but interact differently with the rest of
the protein. The structures of the two domains and the
flexible structural alignment created by FATCAT are illustrated in Figure 7. Because this type of signal is critical to
our analyses, we used the flexible structural alignment

algorithm FATCAT to generate the pairwise alignments of
domain structures. The contributions of flexible structural
alignment have been extensively discussed before
[17,27,28].
Accuracy of structure-based multiple sequence alignment
The accuracy of the structure-based multiple sequence
alignments produced with the alignment tool developed
for this study has been tested with a hard benchmark
SABmark1.65 [29]. The average developer scores of our
method for the superfamily and twilight sets in SABmark
are 82.6 and 64.3, respectively. The average developer
scores of T-Coffee are 57.7 and 27.4, respectively. The
accuracy of the method proposed in this paper is thus sufficient to perform subsequent phylogenetic analyses on
more difficult, sequence-based problems. The effect of
using more accurate alignment methods on the phylogeny of distantly related sequence will be tested in the
future.

There are a few databases providing protein structurebased alignments for homologous families, including
HOMSTRAD [30] and PALI [31]. The structure alignment
methods used by HOMSTRAD and PALI were COMPARER [32,33] and STAMP [34], respectively. In general,
the structure-based sequence alignment can improve the
accuracy of sequence alignment especially when
sequences are distantly related. Both COMPARER and
STAMP are rigid-body superposition programs. In this
study, the multiple structure-based alignments of homologous families were produced by flexible alignment algorithm FATCAT. As discussed in the "Effect of flexible
structural alignment" section, the flexible alignment
method is very important for improving the accuracy of
alignments.

Conclusion
The signal provided by the tertiary structure of protein
domains was used to infer phylogenies. It is important to
contrast the nature of sequence and structural signals. The
signal from structures is generated by the similarity of the
shared regions (core) and the presence and magnitude of
differences of their variable regions (loops). It is unclear
whether the signal provided by the distance between the
structures of the conserved cores reflects evolutionary distances. As cores are assumed to remain constant over time,
the difference between sequences may be restricted to the
presence and structure of the variable regions. An important caveat, our reconstruction of sequences of insertion
did not account for the influence of deletion. Deletions in
this context would appear as simultaneous insertions
events in all other lineages. This would systematically
increase the distance to all other related structures that are
conserving the deleted segment. The effect of deletions on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/444

phylogenies would, therefore, bias this lineage toward the
root of the tree.
It is clear that the underlying process of evolution of
sequence and structure are different: homologous positions in sequences are subjected to a substitution process
while their geometry is assumed to remain constant. The
relative stability of structure over time, however, suggests
that some of the tertiary structures contain phylogenetic
signals that persist beyond the saturation of the substitution process of their coding sequence. The consequence to
this is that 3D signal can be used to tackle questions spanning at unreachable evolutionary depths up to now.
One of these questions is whether a parsimonious process
of innovation can be inferred from existing domain structures. As structural innovation is expected to be infrequent
and spanning evolutionary distances which are not tractable at the sequence level, we constructed tertiary structurebased phylogenies. We reported that inserts which appear
to have evolved iteratively are longer, more complex and
some appear to be novel. For this reason, we propose that
the methodology presented in this work is an early step to
use tertiary structure phylogenetic analysis to study the
evolution of structures and functional diversification.

Methods
Construction of test set
The test set of protein domain families was built from
ASTRAL SCOP 1.69 domain subset (<95% sequence
homology) [35]. The domains were sampled from the first
six SCOP classes, including all alpha proteins, all beta proteins, alpha and beta proteins (a/b), alpha and beta proteins (a+b), multi-domain proteins, and the class of
membrane and cell surface proteins and peptides. Other
classes with either smaller size peptides or not a true class
were excluded. The protein structure files in the domain
list were then downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
[36]. Domain structures were produced by extracting the
polypeptide chains according to the domain definition of
SCOP. When a SCOP domain was found discontinuous
on one chain by definition, the segments in the middle of
domain regions were kept.

Furthermore, domains with missing residues were
excluded. In the final domain structure file, the amino
acid sequence in the SEQRES records linearly corresponds
to the ATOM records. To generate a rooted phylogenetic
tree for the quantitative study of insertion history, a final
filtering was performed on the domain set by selecting
superfamilies that contained at least two families and at
least one family with three or more domains. The immunoglobulin superfamily, which has 782 domains, was discarded because it is difficult to generate multiple sequence
alignment for such large number of domains. After the fil-

tering, the test set includes 3716 domains, belonging to
222 superfamilies, and 975 families in which there are
447 families with at least 3 domains.
Phylogenetic tree
Flexible structural alignment was performed on every pair
of domains in the superfamily using FATCAT [17]. From
these pairs of aligned structures, a pairwise distance
matrix was derived for each family using the structural distance measure QH [12,13]. The structural distance measure QH considers the structural distances of both the
aligned core structures and the unaligned variable regions
[12,13]. The structure-based tree was then generated using
the Neighbor Joining algorithm [14]. To root the phylogenetic tree of each family, an outgroup domain was chosen
from an adjacent structural family within the same superfamily.
Structure-based multiple alignment
To produce an accurate multiple sequence alignment of a
domain family for pinpointing insertion events, the structure-based multiple sequence alignment of each family
was constructed with a similar method proposed by Casbon and Saqi in building S4, a database of structure-based
sequence alignments of SCOP superfamilies [15]. This
method generates high quality multiple structure-based
alignment by running T-Coffee to perform hierarchical
alignment using information from the pairwise structural
alignments. T-Coffee has been successfully applied to
incorporate sequence and structural information in building structure-based multiple sequence alignment
[15,37,38]. In order to align the flexible regions of
domains together, we used FATCAT [17] instead of SAP
[39]. Our method includes the following procedures: 1.
Run FATCAT to generate pairwise structural alignment for
each pair of domains in a family; 2. Generate a T-Coffee
library file from the pairwise structural alignments using
the formula introduced by Casbon and Saqi [15]. A T-Coffee library file consists of the weights of equivalent residues in each pairwise structural alignment of all pairs of
domains; 3. Run T-Coffee (version 2.66) [16] to produce
a multiple sequence alignment from the library file.
Detect insertions and nested insertions
Because the phylogenies are rooted, it is possible to identify at which node in the tree a site enters the conserved
core for all descending structures. Given a phylogenetic
tree, with a set of internal nodes N = {n1,..., nM-2}, relating
to a set of M domains D = {d1,...,dM}, an evolutionary
path is defined as a sequence of nodes starting from the
root n0 to the ith leaf (domain), denoted as pi = {n0,...,
nk,..., di}, in which n(k) ∈ N. The ancestral structural consensus for internal node nk is inferred by comparing the
structures of all descendant domains. A site of the consensus is marked as "A" if over 90% of the structures in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/444

structure-based multiple sequence alignment of all the
descendant domains have aligned residues at this site;
otherwise the site is denoted as a gap ('-') (Figure 8). n0 is
the consensus sequence of all descendent domains. A variable region is defined as a segment of consecutive gap
sites with size >1 on n0 bounded by the shared consensus
sites, which are denoted as "A". In Figure 8(b), the character sequences of the ancestral structural consensus of the
nodes in the path p5 are grouped together to infer the
sequence of insertions in domain d5. By comparing the
structural consensus of the nodes, a segment is considered
as an insertion at nk if it has no homolog in the sequence
of nk-1. To minimize the effect of alignment artifact, small
insertions with only one site were ignored. Therefore, only
insertions with two or more residues were considered in
this study. A new insertion at nk was considered as nested
insertion if it was bounded by sites previously identified
as inserts during the traversing from n0 to nk-1. In Figure
8(b), three insertion-containing regions, var1, var2, and
var3, can be detected. The insertion between n2 and n1 at
site 8 and 11 in var2 is a nested insertion because it is
bounded by the earlier insertion at site 7 and 12 between
n1 and n0. In contrast, the insertions in var1 and var3 are
non-nested, e.g. block insertions.
Insert rank
Insert rank is a value to define the nesting depth of insertions. The insert rank of a nested insert is a value greater
than 1. The insert rank of the nested insert var3 in Figure
8(b) is 3, which indicates three insertions are observed.
For the non-nested inserts of var1 and var3, the insert rank
is 1.
Mapping of insertions into structures
Insertions were mapped into domain's original 3D coordinates for visualization. The temperature factors/beta
values of insert residues in the PDB format file were modified with scaled values to be consistent with the insert
rank. After mapping, the color of residues in the insert
region shifts from blue (rank 1) to red (the highest rank).
Determine complex and novel inserted sub-structure
To study the potential of an insert to be a novel fold unit,
we define the structural complexity as follows: a sub-structure is complex if the similarity to itself is considered significant. Sub-structures whose self similarity is not
significant are too simple to be considered (e.g. a small
segment of helix, a very short polypeptide, etc.). We
restricted the evaluation of complexity to block inserts
with rank = 1, length ≥ 10 and nested inserts with rank >2,
length ≥ 10. Every insert extracted from the SCOP domain
was aligned against its source domain using FATCAT. An
insert was then considered complex if the P-value of the
structural alignment was <0.05. The P-value determined
by FATCAT is a reasonable threshold to assign significance

in structural similarity [28]. The assignments of secondary
structures for the complex inserts were analyzed with
Stride [40,41].
To investigate whether there was any direct evidence to
show insertions created novel structures, all the complex
inserts were compared to domains from other superfamilies in the ASTRAL SCOP 1.69 domain subset (<95%
sequence homology) using FATCAT. The alignment of a
significant match is defined as P-value < 0.05 and aligned
length >80% of the insert size. An insert will be considered as a novel structural unit if there is no significant
match of the nested insert in the SCOP domain subset.
Other methods
The statistical distributions of inserts (Figure 1 and Figure
2) were generated using R [42]. The phylogenetic trees
were rendered with TreeView 1.6.6 [43]. The illustrations
of protein structures were prepared with VMD [44] and
Pymol [45]. Sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was

performed with both distance-based method provided by
PHYLIP [46] and maximum likelihood method PHYML
[47,48]. The sequence-based phylogenies were built with
PROTDIST program and JTT substitution matrix. The programs SEQBOOT and CONSENSE were used to estimate
the confidence of branches from 1000 bootstrap replicates. The maximum likelihood phylogeny was built with
PHYML using the JTT substitution matrix and keeping all
other options to the default setting using the PHYML web
server [48]. The annotated multiple sequence alignment
of Figure 4(a) was generated using JalView [49].
