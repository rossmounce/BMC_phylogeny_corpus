Abstract
Background: Kazal-like serine protease inhibitors are defined by a conserved sequence motif. A
typical Kazal domain contains six cysteine residues leading to three disulfide bonds with a 1–5/2–
4/3–6 pattern. Most Kazal domains described so far belong to this class. However, a novel class of
Kazal domains with two disulfide bridges resulting from the absence of the third and sixth cysteines
have been found in biologically important molecules, such as human LEKTI, a 15-domain inhibitor
associated with the severe congenital disease Netherton syndrome. These domains are referred
to as atypical Kazal domains. Previously, EPI1, a Kazal-like protease inhibitor from the oomycete
plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans, was shown to be a tight-binding inhibitor of subtilisin A. EPI1
also inhibits and interacts with the pathogenesis-related P69B subtilase of the host plant tomato,
suggesting a role in virulence. EPI1 is composed of two Kazal domains, the four-cysteine atypical
domain EPI1a and the typical domain EPI1b.
Results: In this study, we predicted the inhibition constants of EPI1a and EPI1b to subtilisin A using
the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm (Laskowski algorithm). The atypical domain
EPI1a, but not the typical domain EPI1b, was predicted to have strong inhibitory activity against
subtilisin A. Inhibition assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that recombinant
domain EPI1a exhibited stable inhibitory activity against subilisin A and was solely responsible for
inhibition and interaction with tomato P69B subtilase.
Conclusion: The finding that the two disulfide bridge atypical Kazal domain EPI1a is a stable
inhibitor indicates that the missing two cysteines and their corresponding disulfide bond are not
essential for inhibitor reactivity and stability. This report also suggests that the Laskowski algorithm
originally developed and validated with typical Kazal domains might operate accurately for atypical
Kazal domains.

Background
Proteases play essential roles in biological systems, not
only digestion and protein turnover but also a diversity of

specific processes [1]. To regulate the activity of proteases
and avoid cellular damage, organisms also produce protease inhibitors [1]. So far, 48 distinct families of protease

inhibitors have been described, one of which is the Kazal
family of serine protease inhibitors (I1 family) [1]. Kazal
type inhibitors are widely distributed in animals, apicomplexans and oomycetes. They are thought to play important roles in maintenance of normal cellular and
physiological processes of animals [2,3], and pathogenesis of mammalian parasitic apicomplexans and plant
pathogenic oomycetes [4-7]. Kazal-like serine protease
inhibitors are defined by a conserved motif in their amino
acid sequences. Typical Kazal domains contain six
cysteine residues forming a 1–5/2–4/3–6 disulfide bond
pattern [3,8]. Most Kazal domains described so far belong
to this class. However, a novel class of Kazal domains has
been described in recent years, in which the third and
sixth cysteines are missing resulting in the loss of the 3–6
disulfide bond [3,7,9]. These two disulfide bridge
domains are referred to here as atypical Kazal domains.
Atypical Kazal domains were first reported in the human
serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI, a 15-domain inhibitor
associated with the severe congenital disease Netherton
syndrome [2,9]. Domain 2 and 15 of LEKTI are typical
Kazal domains with complete 6 cysteine residues, whereas
the remaining 13 domains represent atypical two
disulfide bridge Kazal domains [3,9,10]. The functionality
of some atypical Kazal domains from LEKTI has been
examined. Domain 1 of LEKTI does not inhibit any of the
standard proteases [11]. Domain 6 exhibits significant
inhibitory activity on trypsin, but this inhibition is only
temporary [3,9,11]. A recombinant protein containing
four atypical domains of LEKTI (domain 6, 7, 8 and 9)
inhibits both trypsin and subtilisin A permanently [10],
indicating that atypical Kazal domains can be effective
inhibitors. However, it is unclear whether a single atypical
domain can be a stable inhibitor. Multi-domain interactions could be responsible for the stable inhibitory activity observed for the recombinant protein [10]. Additional
structural and functional studies on atypical Kazal
domains are needed to understand the impact of the
disulfide bridges on inhibitor activity and stability.
As a result of exhaustive biochemical studies of the third
domain of turkey ovomucoid protein performed by the
late Michael Laskowski Jr. and collaborators, much is
known about the relationship between domain sequence
and inhibition specificity in Kazal inhibitor-serine protease interactions. This work culminated in the development of an additivity-based sequence to reactivity
algorithm, referred to from here on as the Laskowski algorithm, that predicts the inhibition constants (Ki) between
Kazal domains and a set of six serine proteases based
solely on the sequence of the inhibitors [12,13]. Structural
studies of Kazal domain-protease complexes revealed that
there are 12 contact positions (P6, P5, P4, P3, P2, P1, P1',
P2', P3', P14', P15' and P18') responsible for interactions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/6/15

between Kazal domains and their cognate serine proteases
[12,14-16]. Changes in noncontact residues often do not
affect equilibrium constants (Ka, the reciprocal of Ki),
whereas changes in contact residues result in significant
alterations of Ka [12]. Among the 12 contact residues, P3,
the second conserved cysteine residue, and P15', a conserved asparagine, show little variation in naturally occurring Kazal domains, but the remaining ten contact
residues are hypervariable [12]. Therefore, the Laskowski
algorithm was established based on the residues at the 10
contact positions and allows for the calculation of Ka or
Ki of a Kazal domain against a selected set of six serine
proteases based on the domain sequence alone
[12,13,17]. This algorithm was developed based on 191
variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain (19 amino
acid mutants in the ten contact residues plus the wild
type) and was validated with a number of typical Kazal
domains [12,13,17]. Theoretically, the algorithm should
be applicable to atypical Kazal domains since the missing
cysteine residues are different from the hypervariable contact residues. However, the accuracy of the algorithm in
predicting the reactivity of atypical Kazal domains has not
been tested (M. Laskowski, Jr., pers. comm.).
Kazal-like inhibitors are ubiquitous in oomycetes [7], a
group of eukaryotic microbes that includes many devastating plant pathogens [18]. A total of 35 putative extracellular proteins with 56 predicted Kazal-like domains were
identified from five plant pathogenic oomycete species
[7]. Among them, the Phytophthora infestans Kazal inhibitors EPI1 and EPI10 inhibit and interact with the pathogenesis-related P69B subtilisin-like serine protease of the
host plant tomato, suggesting a role in virulence [7,19].
Both EPI1 and EPI10 contain an atypical Kazal domain
[7,19]. Atypical domains are common in Kazal-like inhibitors of plant pathogenic oomycetes. One-fourth (14/56)
of oomycete Kazal domains belong to this type [7]. These
domains are distributed in 14 different proteins from
three Phytophthora species, P. infestans, P. ramorum and P.
sojae, some of which have multiple domains. Remarkably,
phylogenetic analysis of the 56 domains revealed that all
the atypical domains form a significantly distinct cluster
(M. Tian, Z. Liu and S. Kamoun, manuscript in preparation), suggesting that the loss of one disulfide bridge in
Phytophthora Kazal-like domains predates speciation.
Characterizing the atypical Kazal domains would help to
understand the biochemical and biological functions of
these inhibitors.
P. infestans EPI1 is an ideal candidate to characterize atypical Kazal domains. EPI1 was identified as a tight-binding
inhibitor of subtilisin A and inhibits and interacts with
P69B subtilisin-like serine protease [7]. EPI1 is composed
of two putative Kazal domains, atypical domain EPI1a
and typical domain EPI1b [7]. The predicted 12 contact

residues of both domains follow the Kazal consensus,
with P3 and P15' conserved cysteines and asparagines,
respectively, and the remaining 10 contact residues variable relative to other Kazal domains. In this study, we predicted the inhibition constants of EPI1a and EPI1b to
subtilisin A using the Laskowski algorithm [12]. The atypical domain EPI1a, but not the typical domain EPI1b, was
predicted to be a strong inhibitor of subtilisin A. A recombinant EPI1a exhibited stable inhibitory activity against
subilisin A and appeared solely responsible for inhibition
and interaction with tomato P69B subtilase, providing
evidence that the missing two cysteine residues and the
corresponding disulfide bond might not be essential for
inhibitor reactivity and stability. This report also suggests
that the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm
(Laskowski algorithm) originally developed and validated
with typical Kazal domains might operate accurately for
atypical domains.

Results
The atypical Kazal domain of EPI1 is predicted to be a
functional inhibitor of subtilisin A
The inhibition constants of two Kazal domains of EPI1
against subtilisin A were predicted using the Laskowski
algorithm [12] based on the sequence of their 10 hypervariable contact residues (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the atypical Kazal domain EPI1a was predicted to be a strong
inhibitor of subtilisin A with a Ki of 4.3 nM, a value that
is remarkably similar to the experimentally determined Ki
of 2.77 +/- 1.07 nM for the entire EPI1 protein against
subtilisin A [7]. In contrast, the typical Kazal domain
EPI1b, which contains the complete set of six cysteine residues, may not be functional against subtilisin A since the
predicted Ki was high at 50 mM. Therefore, these computational analyses predicted that the atypical domain EPI1a
is solely responsible for the inhibition of subtilisin A.

Expression and purification of the two Kazal domains of
EPI1
To test the protease inhibitory activities of EPI1a and
EPI1b, the two Kazal domains of EPI1, and assess the predictions of the Laskowski algorithm, we expressed and
purified the two recombinant domains in Escherichia coli
as fusion proteins with the FLAG epitope tag at the aminoterminus. The sequences of the recombinant proteins are
shown in Fig. 2A. The predicted molecular mass for FLAGEPI1a (rEPI1a) and FLAG-EPI1b (rEPI1b) was 10181 Da
and 8996 Da, respectively. To determine the purity of the
purified recombinant proteins, we ran 0.5 µg of purified
rEPI1a and rEPI1b on SDS-PAGE gel and stained with silver nitrate. Bands of the expected sizes were observed for
both proteins. There was only a single band for rEPI1b,
indicating high purity (Fig. 2B). The rEPI1a sample
revealed two closely-migrating bands (Fig. 2B). The two
bands reacted to the FLAG antibody and are likely to represent rEPI1a with and without the signal peptide OMPA,
which is located immediately before the FLAG peptide in
the vector pFLAG-ATS and is responsible for secreted
expression in E. coli. Similar release of the mature protein
was commonly observed with other proteins expressed
using pFLAG-ATS (M. Tian and S. Kamoun, unpublished).
We also stained the gel loaded with purified rEPI1a protein with Coomassie blue. Compared with the band corresponding to the rEPI1a without OMPA, the slowermigrating band was much weaker (data not shown), indicating the secreted version of rEPI1a was the major component of the purified rEPI1a protein solution. Besides
these two bands, no other proteins were detected by silver
staining suggesting that the rEPI1a preparation was highly
pure.

The atypical Kazal domain EPI1a inhibits the serine
protease subtilisin A
We performed inhibition assays of subtilisin A by incubating 0.2 µM of subtilisin A with 0.2 µM of rEPI1a, rEPI1b
or buffer control in a volume of 50 µl. The remaining protease activity was measured using the QuantiCleave™ Protease Assay Kit as described in methods. In repeated
assays, rEPI1a was found to inhibit about 91% of the
measured activity of subtilisin A, whereas rEPI1b did not
display any significant inhibition (Fig. 3). These results
are consistent with the prediction of the Laskowski algorithm (Fig. 1). It is unlikely that the FLAG tag interfered
with the inhibitory activities considering that both the
active rEPI1a and inactive rEPI1b carry the FLAG sequence
and that these experiments were conducted in parallel.
EPI1a inhibits the tomato pathogenesis-related P69B
subtilase
EPI1 inhibits and interacts with the pathogenesis-related
P69B subtilase of tomato [7]. To test which of the two
domains of EPI1 inhibits P69B, we first used agroinfiltration to transiently express P69B fused with the epitope tag
HA at the C-terminus in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves.
Intercellular fluids were collected from leaves infiltrated
with either Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing pCB302-

P69B, or A. tumefaciens containing the empty binary vector pCB302-3. 10 µl of intercellular fluids from the two
treatments were used in in-gel protease assays. A distinct
additional protease band was observed in the P69Bexpressing sample but not in the control suggesting that
P69B-HA is functional (Fig. 4A). 10 µl of P69B-expressing
N. benthamiana intercellular fluids were incubated with 20
pmol of the EPI1 recombinant protein rEPI1 [7], rEPI1a,
rEPI1b, or buffer and the remaining protease activity was
detected by in-gel protease assay. rEPI1a, containing the
atypical Kazal domain, completely inhibited the P69B
band similar to rEPI1. rEPI1 and rEPI1a also inhibited the
activity of two other extracellular proteases from N.
benthamiana (Fig. 4B). The identity of these N. benthamiana proteases is unknown but they could also be subtilisin-like serine proteases, such as homologs of tomato P69.
In these experiments, rEPI1b did not exhibit any inhibition towards P69B or other protease bands.
EPI1a interacts with tomato P69
We previously showed that rEPI1 interacts with P69B [7].
Here, we tested whether the atypical Kazal domain EPI1a
interacts with P69B subtilase by coimmunoprecipitation.
Coimmunoprecipitation was performed on BTH-induced
tomato intercellular fluids incubated with rEPI1a, rEPI1b

or buffer control using FLAG antibody covalently linked
agarose beads. Western blots were hybridized sequentially
with P69 and FLAG antisera and revealed that P69 subtilases co-precipitated with rEPI1a (Fig. 5). This indicates
that rEPI1a interacts with P69 subtilases. Since the P69
family of subtilases have at least six homologs (P69AP69F) [20,21] and the peptide used to generate the P69
antisera is conserved among several homologs [7], we
cannot conclude that P69B subtilase is the only protein
that was pulled down with rEPI1a. In contrast to rEPI1a,
rEPI1b could not be detected after coimmunoprecipitation with BTH-induced tomato intercellular fluids (Fig.
5). However, rEPI1b was detected in control coimmunoprecipitations with the extraction buffer of tomato intercellular fluids (data not shown), suggesting that this
protein is not stable in BTH-induced tomato intercellular
fluids.
EPI1a exhibits stable inhibitory activity
To determine whether EPI1a is a temporary or stable
inhibitor of subtilisin, we performed stability analyses by
incubating subtilisin A with or without rEPI1a for increasing periods of time and measuring the remaining protease
activity. To determine the optimal concentration of EPI1a
for the stability analyses, we first performed inhibition

assays with varying concentrations of EPI1a (Fig. 6A). The
concentration of 0.15 µM of EPI1a resulted in inhibition
levels of about 80% of the measured protease activity and
was selected for the stability analysis. This concentration
is within the linear part of the curve (Fig. 6A), suggesting
that hydrolysis of rEPI1a could be easily detected as a
decrease in inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of
rEPI1a did not show any decrease over 3 hours of incubation with subtilisin A (Fig. 6B), indicating that EPI1a is a
stable inhibitor of subtilisin A. These results are in sharp
contrast with those reported for domain LD-6 of LEKTI,
which lost 50% of inhibitory activity after 1 hour of incubation with trypsin and lost all inhibitory effect after 3–4
hours [3].

Discussion
Atypical Kazal domains with two disulfide bridges occur
in biologically important molecules. The 15-domain
human serine protease inhibitor LEKTI that carries 13
atypical Kazal domains is associated with the severe congenital disorder Netherton syndrome [2]. The protease
inhibitors EPI1 and EPI10 of P. infestans contain an

atypical Kazal domain and have been implicated in virulence of this devastating plant pathogen [7,19]. Although
the structure and function of atypical Kazal domains from
LEKTI have been studied, the effects of the loss of Cys 3,
Cys 6 and the corresponding disulfide bond on inhibitor
reactivity and stability was not assessed and there is no
evidence showing that a single atypical Kazal domain can
be a stable inhibitor by itself [3,10,11]. In this study, we
describe that the atypical domain EPI1a of the twodomain EPI1 protein is a stable inhibitor of the subtilisin
family of serine proteases. No loss of inhibitory activity
was found even after incubating EPI1a with subtilisin A
for 3 hours. The loss of Cys 3, Cys 6 and the corresponding
disulfide bond does not have major adverse effects on
inhibitory activity or stability, indicating that these two
cysteine residues might not be essential for the function of
Kazal domains. This finding is important for determining
the biochemical and biological functions of Kazal inhibitors containing atypical Kazal domain(s). Kazal-like proteins have been reported from animals, apicomplexans,
oomycetes, as well as the bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea
[7]. The availability of genomic sequence from a diversity
of organisms is likely to reveal an increasing number of
atypical Kazal inhibitors. For example, so far, a total of 14

atypical Kazal domains have been identified in plant
pathogenic oomycetes [7].
The structural mechanism underlying the stability of
EPI1a is not clear. The three-dimensional structure of the

Page 6 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biochemistry 2005, 6:15

atypical domain 6 (LD6) of LEKTI was determined. The
overall structure of LD6 resembles the three-dimensional
fold of typical Kazal-type inhibitors, but the backbone
geometry of its canonical loop is not well defined, providing a possible explanation for its temporary inhibitory
activity [11]. There are 13 residues between the first
cysteine residue (Cys 1) and the second one (Cys 2) in
LD6, instead of 6–9 in most typical Kazal domains [11].
The lack of one disulfide bond and the longer sequence
stretch between the first two cysteines were proposed to be
the factors responsible for the instability of LD6 [11].
Indeed, the longer sequence stretch between the first two
cysteines could explain the difference between EPI1a and
LD6. There are only 3 residues between Cys 1 and Cys 2 in
EPI1a, which is shorter than in most Kazal domains. The
longer sequence stretch of LD6 might lead to the abnormal canonical loop and the non-permanent inhibitory
activity. Future work to determine the three-dimensional
structure of EPI1a and compare it with LD6 of LEKTI and
other Kazal domains should help to unravel the structural
mechanism underlying the functionality of atypical Kazal
domains.
The Laskowski algorithm was developed and validated
based on typical Kazal domains [12,13]. The algorithm
exploits an exhaustive analysis of all amino acid variants
in the ten hypervariable contact residues of turkey ovomucoid third domain, a typical Kazal domain. The accuracy
of the algorithm in predicting the reactivity of atypical
Kazal domains has not been evaluated (M. Laskowski Jr.,
pers. comm.). Here we found that the algorithm correctly
predicted which of the two EPI domains is likely to inhibit
subtilisins. Our experimental data showed that the atypical Kazal domain EPI1a inhibited subtilisin A, and inhibited and interacted with P69 subtilase similar to the entire
EPI1 protein [7]. Also, using the algorithm, the atypical
Kazal domain EPI1a was predicted to be a strong inhibitor
of subtilisin A with a predicted Ki of 4.3 nM, which was in
very good agreement with the experimentally determined
Ki of 2.77 +/- 1.07nM [7]. As expected from the predicted
Ki of 50 mM, the typical EPI1b domain was not an effective inhibitor of subtilisin A. In summary, it appears that
the Laskowski algorithm operates accurately for atypical
Kazal domains such as EPI1a. Perhaps, this is expected
since the Cys 3 and Cys 6 residues of typical Kazal
domains are not contact positions. Nonetheless, our
observations and the concordance between predicted and
experimental data suggest that gross structural changes
that could result from the loss of one disulfide bridge in
atypical Kazal domains may not affect the specificity of
the interactions between Kazal domains and their cognate
serine proteases.
Atypical Kazal domains are ubiquitous in serine protease
inhibitors of plant pathogenic oomycetes. Fourteen of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/6/15

total of 56 Kazal-like domains identified in five plant
pathogenic oomycetes have only four cysteines. Two of
these Kazal-like inhibitors EPI1 and EPI10 of P. infestans
target the defense-related protease P69B of the host plant
tomato. The first atypical Kazal domain of EPI1 appears to
be solely functional in inhibiting and interacting with
P69B. In the three-domain EPI10, the second domain is
also an atypical domain that was predicted to be functional against subtilisin based on the Laskowski algorithm
[19]. These findings raise some interesting questions.
What are the biochemical and biological implications of
the loss of the disulfide bridge? Are there any evolutionary
advantages of the two-disulfide bridge Kazal domain over
the three-disulfide bridge domain in counteracting and
co-evolving with host proteases? Additional functional
and structural studies are needed to address these
questions.

Conclusion
In this study, the functionality of a two disulfide bridge
atypical Kazal domain EPI1a from Phytophthora was characterized. EPI1a was predicted to be a strong inhibitor of
subtilisin A using the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm (Laskowski algorithm). Inhibition assays
and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that
recombinant domain EPI1a exhibited stable inhibitory
activity against subilisin A and was solely responsible for
inhibition and interaction with tomato P69B subtilase,
providing evidence that the missing two cysteines and
their corresponding disulfide bond are not essential for
inhibitor reactivity and stability. This report also suggests
that the Laskowski algorithm originally developed and
validated with typical Kazal domains might operate accurately for atypical Kazal domains.

Methods
Prediction of inhibition constants
The putative ten hypervariable contact residues of EPI1a
and EPI1b were identified based on similarity to canonical animal Kazal domains [14-16] and are shown in Fig.
1. Predicted inhibition constants for the EPI1 domains
against subtilisin A (Carlsberg) were generated by Drs. M.
A. Qasim and M. Laskowski Jr., Purdue University, with
the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm
(Laskowski algorithm) described by Lu et al. [12].
Plant growth and BTH treatment
Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivar Ohio 7814 and
N. benthamiana plants were grown in pots at 25°C, 60%
humidity, under 16 hour-light/8 hour-dark cycle. We used
the salicylic acid analog benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) to induce PR proteins.
BTH treatment of tomato plants followed the exact same
procedure described previously [7].

Bacterial strains and plasmids
E. coli XL1-Blue and A. tumefaciens GV3101 were used in
this study and were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB)
media [22] at 37°C and 28°C, respectively. Plasmids
pFLAG-EPI1a and pFLAG-EPI1b for protein expression
were constructed by cloning the PCR amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the coding sequence of Kazal
domains EPI1a and EPI1b together with some flanking
sequence into EcoRI and KpnI sites of pFLAG-ATS (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), a vector that allows secreted expression in
E. coli. The primers used for amplification of epi1a are
epi1a-F1(5'-gcggaattcTCAAAGCCCGCAAGTCATCAG-3')
and
epi1a-R1(5'-gcgggtaccTTACTTGCTGGGAGGCTGCTCGCCAG-3'). The primers used for amplification of
epi1b are epi1b-F1(5'-gcggaattcCACCGGTAGCTCCACTGGCGAGCAGC-3') and epi1b-R1(5'-gcgggtaccTTATCCCTCCTGCGGTGTC-3'). The introduced EcoRI and KpnI
restriction sites for cloning are underlined. The letters in
upper case represent gene specific sequence. The detailed
sequence information for the expressed fusion proteins
FLAG-EPI1a (rEPI1a) and FLAG-EPI1b (rEPI1b) is shown
in Fig. 2A. Plasmid pCB-P69B is a construct with the open
reading frame of the P69B gene [GenBank: Y17276] fused
with the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the C-terminus cloned
into the binary vector pCB302-3 [23] and was described
elsewhere [19].
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses
Proteins were subjected to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as previously described [22]. Following electrophoresis, gels were
stained with silver nitrate following the method of Merril
et al. [24] or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue [22], or the
proteins were transferred to supported nitrocellulose
membranes (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a
Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Detection of antigen-antibody complexes was
carried out with a Western blot alkaline phosphatase kit
(BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Antisera to P69 subtilases were raised against a peptide specific for the tomato
P69 family [7]. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Expression and purification of rEPI1a and rEPI1b
Expression and purification of rEPI1a and rEPI1b was
conducted as described previously for other pFLAG-ATS
derived constructs [7,25]. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). To determine the purity, 0.5 µg of
the purified protein was run on a SDS-PAGE gel followed
by staining with silver nitrate.
Transient expression of P69B subtilase in planta
Transient expression of P69B-HA in planta was performed
according to the agroinfiltration method described previ-

ously [26]. A. tumefaciens strains carrying plasmids pCBP69B, empty vector pCB302-3 [23], and pCB301-P19 (J.
Win and S. Kamoun, unpublished) were used. pCB301P19 is a construct expressing the P19 protein of tomato
bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing in N. benthamiana that significantly
enhances in planta transient expression [27]. Overnight
agrobacteria cultures were harvested by centrifugation at
2000 g for 20 min, and resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2, 10
mM MES (pH 5.6) and 150 µM acetosyringone. Resuspended agrobacteria cultures of pCB-P69B or pCB302-3
with an optical density (OD600) of 1.0 were mixed with
equal volumes of a culture of pCB301-P19 with an optical
density (OD600) of 2.0. The mixtures were kept at room
temperature for 3 hours and then infiltrated into leaves of
6-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Intercellular fluids
from infiltrated leaves were isolated 5 days after
infiltration.
Isolation of intercellular fluids
Intercellular fluids were prepared from tomato and N.
bethamiana leaves according to the method of de Wit and
Spikman [28]. For tomato leaves, a 0.24 M sorbitol solution was used as extraction buffer. For leaves from N.
benthamiana, a solution of 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaPO4
pH 7 [26] was used as extraction buffer. The intercellular
fluids were filter sterilized (0.45 µM), and were used
immediately or stored at -20°C.
In-gel protease assays
In-gel protease assays were performed with 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using BIO-RAD's zymogram buffer system as described earlier [7].
Inhibition assays of subtilisin A by EPI1 Kazal domains
Inhibition assays of subtilisin A by EPI1 Kazal domains
were performed using colorimetric QuantiCleave™ Protease Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 0.2 µM of subtilisin
A (Carlsberg) (Sigma, St. Luis, MO) was preincubated
with different amount of purified EPI1 Kazal domains, in
a volume of 50 µl buffer for 30 min at 25°C, and then the
remaining protease activity was measured following the
procedures as described previously [7]. Analysis of the stable inhibitory activity of rEPI1a against subtilisin A was
performed by incubating 0.2 µM of subtilisin A with 0.15
µM of rEPI1a in 50 µl buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) for a
time period of 0–180 min at 25°C and then measuring
residue enzyme activity.
Coimmunoprecipitation
Coimmunoprecipitation of Kazal domains rEPI1a and
rEPI1b with BTH-treated tomato intercellular fluids was
performed using the FLAG-tagged protein immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma, St. Luis, MO) as described previously

[7]. 100 pmol of purified rEPI1a or rEPI1b were preincubated with 300 µl of tomato intercellular fluids for 30 min
at 25°C. 40 µl of anti-FLAG M2 resin was added and incubated at 4°C for 2 h with gentle shaking. The precipitated
protein complexes were eluted in 60 µl of FLAG peptide
solution (150 ng/µl) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analyses.
