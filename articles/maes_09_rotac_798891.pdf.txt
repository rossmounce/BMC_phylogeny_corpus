Abstract
Background: Group A rotaviruses are the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and
children worldwide and continue to have a major global impact on childhood morbidity and
mortality. In recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of
two new live, orally administered vaccines. Although both vaccines have proven to confer a good
protection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, these vaccines will have to be screened and may
have to be updated regularly to reflect temporal and spatial genotype fluctuations. In this matter,
the genetic characterization of circulating and new emerging rotavirus strains will need to be
compulsory and accurate. An extended classification system for rotaviruses in which all the 11
genomic RNA segments are used, has been proposed recently. The use of this classification system
will help to elucidate the role of gene reassortments in the generation of genetic diversity, host
range restriction, co-segregation of certain gene segments, and in adaptation to a new host species.
Results: Here we present a web-based tool that can be used for fast rotavirus genotype
differentiation of all 11 group A rotavirus gene segments according to the new guidelines proposed
by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG).
Conclusion: With the increasing sequencing efforts that are being conducted around the world
to unravel complete rotavirus genomes of human and animal origin, this tool will be of great help
to analyze and correctly classify the large amount of new data. The web-based tool is freely available
at http://rotac.regatools.be.

Background
Group A rotaviruses are the major etiological agent of
severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide,
leading to significant morbidity and mortality. More than
125 million infants and young children develop rotavirus
diarrhea globally each year, resulting in 440.000 deaths in
children, mostly in the developing countries [1].
Although the infant mortality rate due to rotavirus disease

is low in developed countries, the consequences of the
disease can be very costly and cause a significant economic burden, which can be both direct (medical costs,
outpatient visits, diagnosis, medication) and indirect (lost
working hours of parents). For example, the costs associated with rotavirus diarrhea in the United States were estimated at $100-400 million to the healthcare system and
$1 billion to the society [2,3].

Extensive genetic variation and reassortment of the 11
double-stranded RNA rotaviral genome segments has
resulted in the presence of a large spectrum of different
rotavirus genotypes in humans and animals. Rotaviruses,
which form a separate genus in the family Reoviridae, are
divided into seven (A to G) antigenically distinct groups
that infect mammalian and avian species, of which group
A rotaviruses are the most important due to their high
prevalence and pathogenicity in both mammalian and
avian species. Group A rotaviruses have a genome that is
enclosed in a triple-layered icosahedral capsid, consisting
of 11 segments encoding six viral structural proteins (VP1
to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins
(NSP1 to NSP6) [4]. Like influenza viruses, a dual classification system for group A rotaviruses has been established
depending on two outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7,
defining respectively P en G genotypes. Recently, a genotyping system based on complete nucleotide sequences of
all 11 genomic RNA segments has been proposed by Matthijnssens and colleagues [5]. In this new classification
system, nucleotide identity cut-off percentages were
defined to identify different genotypes for each of the 11
segments (Table 1). Likewise, a nomenclature for the
comparison of complete rotavirus genomes was considered in which the notation Gx-P [x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-NxTx-Ex-Hx (with x indicating the number of the genotype)
is used for the VP7, VP4, VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP1,
NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 encoding genes, respectively. In this new group A rotavirus classification system,
the complete open reading frame (ORF) of a rotavirus
gene is compared to other complete ORFs of cognate
genes available in the GenBank database. If pairwise
nucleotide identities between the gene of the novel strain
under investigation (strain A) and the strains belonging to
an established genotype X are above the cut off value of
that gene segment (Table 1), strain A can be assigned to
genotype X. The exact relationship between the gene of
strain A and cognate genes of all established genotypes,
has to be obtained phylogenetically. When all the pair-

wise nucleotide identities between a gene of the new
strain B, and the cognate genes of all the established genotypes are below the cut-off value for that gene segment
(Table 1), strain B may be the prototype of a new genotype
[6]. If only a partial ORF sequence of a rotavirus genome
segment is available, assigning it to a specific genotype is
less certain because the genotypic diversity across the ORF
is not a constant value. Some regions of the ORF may be
highly variable, while others may be more conserved.
Since the cut-off percentage values for each of the 11
genome segments has been calculated based on entire
ORFs, applying these cut-off percentages to only a part of
the ORF, might lead to erroneous conclusions. In accordance with the recommendations of the RCWG, only under
certain circumstances when all three of the following
restrictions are obeyed, a partial gene sequence might be
used to assign a rotavirus gene to an established genotype:
(a) at least 50% of the ORF sequence should be determined; (b) at least 500 nucleotides of the ORF should be
determined; and (c) identity between strain X and a strain
belonging to an established genotype A should be at least
2% above the appropriate cut-off sequence (Table 1),
before strain X can be assigned to genotype A.

Implementation
The classification tool for group A rotaviruses (RotaC
v1.0) is written in java with a simple object model in order
to make it easy to maintain the code. The interface of the
website is written in perl. The RotaC tool can analyze up
to a 1000 nucleotide sequences in 'strict' FASTA-format (a
first line with a sequence identifier preceded by '>', followed by a second line with the sequence). The analysis of
nucleotide sequences with a length below 500 bases is not
suitable according to the RCWG guidelines and is not
allowed in the RotaC tool.
The genotyping process consists of several subsequent
steps. In a first step, the appropriate gene segment is identified by comparing the query sequence with a full

genome reference alignment consisting of well-characterized group A rotavirus sequences and by the neighborjoining algorithm. After the recognition of the segment of
origin, the query sequence is aligned using the profile
alignment functions of Clustal W v2.0[7] with a reference
alignment of the appropriate segment (detailed information about the alignments used with the RotaC tool can be
found on http://rotac.regatools.be). In a second step, a
distance matrix, based on pairwise alignments with the
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [8], and a phylogenetic
tree based on the neighbor-joining algorithm using the
Paup* software [9] are constructed and analyzed to identify the genotype of the query sequence by using the nucleotide identity cut-off values summarized in Table 1. The
reliability of the clustering of the neighbor-joining tree is
assessed using 100 bootstrap replicates, considering 70%
as the cut-off value. If the query sequence has a shared
identity of at least 3% above the appropriate cut-off value
with an established genotype, the query sequence is considered as a member of that specific genotype. If the
shared identity is at least 3% below the cut-off value, the
query sequence is considered as a new genotype of the
proper rotavirus segment. For identities less than 3%
below or above the cut-off value, the tool provides only
tentative conclusions. In this case, it is recommended to
send the sequence to the Rotavirus Classification Working
Group for further phylogenetic analysis and correct identification of the genotype. For queries covering less than
50% of the ORF region, no conclusion will be drawn. The
user should pay attention that the assignment of a genotype to the query sequence with identities less than 3%
below or above the genotype cut-off values should be confirmed by more extensive phylogenetic analysis, or should
be send to the RCWG for further analyses and/or validation.

Results and Discussion
Due to the very limited number of completely sequenced
rotavirus genomes, studies on reassortments have been
limited to a few gene segments. Recently, the increased
availability of complete rotavirus genome sequences, and
the introduction of an extended classification and nomenclature system, comprising all 11 rotavirus gene segments,
has prompted many investigators to start complete rotavirus genome sequencing projects. Both reassortments
between strains belonging to the same host species, and
between strains belonging to different host species have
been documented several times in the past [10-12]. The
new classification system creates a necessary framework to
thoroughly analyze possible interspecies transmissions of
whole rotaviruses from one host to another, and to study
the effect of reassortments on the generation of genetic
rotavirus diversity, host range restriction, co-segregation
of certain gene segments, and adaptation to a new host
species [5]. A Rotavirus Classification Work Group was setup

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/238

to evaluate potentially new genotypes that will be discovered when more and more complete rotavirus genomes
from multiple host species will be sequenced [6]. The
analyses of complete rotavirus genomes, and the assignment to the appropriate genotypes will be highly facilitated by the use of the free online RotaC-tool. The RotaCtool will be updated regularly, an will work closely
together with the RCWG in order to update the tool with
new genotypes, to reflect all established and new genotypes.

Conclusion
There are several useful web-based tools and database
resources for the genotyping analysis of viral sequences,
based on phylogenetic trees, or sequence similarities of
whole/partial sequences for the genotyping of HIV-1/HIV2, HTLV-1/HTLV-2, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and
poliovirus sequences [13-17]. Here we have introduced a
reliable and easy-to-use automated classification tool for
group A rotaviruses. Our RotaC classification tool is in
agreement with the rotavirus classification strategy and
guidelines as proposed by the Rotavirus Classification
Working Group. The web-based RotaC tool can be freely
accessed at http://rotac.regatools.be.
