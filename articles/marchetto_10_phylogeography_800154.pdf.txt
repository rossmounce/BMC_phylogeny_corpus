Abstract
Background: Owing to its independence from the main Central European drainage systems, the Italian freshwater
fauna is characterized by a high degree of endemicity. Three main ichthyogeographic districts have been proposed in
Italy. Yet, the validity of these regions has not been confirmed by phylogenetic and population genetic analyses and a
phylogeographic scenario for Italy's primary freshwater fish fauna is still lacking. Here, we investigate the
phylogeography of the Italian vairone (Telestes muticellus).
Results: We sampled 38 populations representing the species' entire distribution range and covering all relevant
drainage systems, and genotyped 509 individuals at eight variable microsatellite loci. Applying various population
genetic analyses, we identify five distinct groups of populations that are only partly in agreement with the proposed
ichthyogeographic districts. Our group I, which is formed by specimens from Veneto and the Po River system draining
into the Adriatic Sea, corresponds to the Padano-Venetian ichthyogeographic district (PV), except for two Middle
Adriatic drainages, which we identify as a separate group (III). The Tuscano-Latium district (TL) is equivalent to our
group V. A more complex picture emerges for the Ligurian drainages: populations from Central Liguria belong to group
I, while populations from West (group II) and East Liguria (group IV) form their own groups, albeit with affinities to PV
and TL, respectively.
Conclusions: We propose a phylogeographic scenario for T. muticellus in which an initial T. muticellus stock became
isolated from the 'Alpine' clade and survived the various glaciation cycles in several refugia. These were situated in the
Upper Adriatic (groups I and II), the Middle Adriatic (group III), (East) Liguria (group IV) and Tuscano-Latium (group V).
The population structure in the vairone is, in principal, in agreement with the two main ichthyogeographic districts (PV
and TL), except for the two populations in the Middle Adriatic, which we identify as additional major "district".
Background
It is now well established that the Quaternary ice ages
were among the main contributing factors shaping the
present distribution of species and of populations within
species [1-3]. At least in the temperate and polar zones,

the cyclic climate changes caused a shift of biomes in a
North-South direction and repeatedly produced the situation that different populations belonging to the same
species were separated by geographic barriers [4]. Species
inhabiting North America and Europe, the two continents that were covered by the most extensive glacial
sheets, were influenced in different ways with regard to
the impact of ice ages on migration: in North America the
main geographical barriers had the same orientation as
the biomes' shift, while in Europe, due its complex geog-

raphy, strong barriers to migration existed. The Mediterranean Sea, for example, limited migration towards
North Africa so that many taxa were restricted to the
large southern European peninsulas - the Iberian, the
Balkan and the Italian - during the maximal glacial
expansions. In addition, the most important mountain
chains bordering these glacial refugia limited areal reexpansion towards Central and northern Europe during
the interglacial periods. The combination of these two
geographical features isolated populations of various
taxa, thereby triggering genetic diversification and (allopatric) speciation [2].
Phylogeography, i.e. the integration of the phylogenetic
inferences and/or population genetic relationships
among individuals or taxa on one hand, and their geographic distribution on the other hand [5], offers the
means to reconstruct the historical processes that triggered the geographic distribution of biodiversity. In this
context, freshwater fishes constitute an important model
group because their dispersion, diversification and speciation are strictly related to the processes that shaped
the landmass and the hydrogeographic systems, which
they inhabit [6,7]. There are only few ways by which a primary freshwater fish can reach a new river basin: by river
capture [8], by downstream river confluence when the sea
level is lowered [9], by dispersal over the sea under lower
salinity conditions ("lago-mare" phase; [10]), or by lakes
formed during the retreat of glaciers [6].
The Italian peninsula - isolated from continental
Europe by the Alps, the highest mountain chain with an
East-West orientation - hosts a relatively high number of
endemic freshwater taxa [10-13]. Its independence from
the main Central European drainage systems Danube,
Rhine and Rhône favored this high degree of endemicity.
The Italian hydrographic structure is largely influenced
by the North-South orientated Apennine barrier, which
modulated the allopatric distribution and the diversification of various freshwater taxa [10]. Based on the distribution of cyprinid fishes, three main ichthyogeographic
districts were identified [10]: (i) the Padano-Venetian district (PV) including basins from the Vomano river to the
Krka river, which all drain into the Adriatic Sea; (ii) the
Tuscano-Latium district (TL) from the Serchio river to
the Tevere river, which drain into the middle Tyrrhenian
Sea; and (iii) the South Italy district (SI) (Fig. 1). Despite
the importance of the Italian peninsula as major glacial
refugia in general and its role in shaping the distribution
and diversity of the Central European freshwater fish
fauna in particular, little is known about the phylogeography of freshwater fishes in that area, and detailed studies
based on molecular markers and including specimens
from all relevant river basins are lacking. Therefore, limited knowledge on the recent evolution of the Italian
hydrographic systems at regional and local scale is avail-

able, and a clear-cut picture of the more recent changes in
the Italian hydrographic structure is lacking.
The vairone is a primary freshwater fish belonging to
the family Cyprinidae, it is distributed in and around the
Alps, and represents a good candidate for phylogeographic inference [14-17]. The taxonomic status and the
generic assignment of the vairone are, however, under
debate. Some authors stick to its original genus name
Leuciscus [14-16], while others assign it to Telestes based
on its position in the phylogeny of European cyprinids
[18-21]. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) revealed the existence of two main lineages within the vairone, T. souffia and T. muticellus
(note that T. souffia is listed as subspecies of Telestes souffia by some authors [14,15], while being granted species
rank by others [16,17,21]). In the present study, we use
the latter assignment, i.e. Telestes muticellus, because of
its great genetic distance (> 5% in mtDNA) to the 'Alpine'
clade [15].
The vairone inhabits cold running waters with high levels of dissolved oxygen. Its diet primarily consists of benthic invertebrates and, occasionally, of algae and plant
remains. It exhibits a gregarious behavior, and the breeding period lasts from May to August; egg deposition takes
place in the nocturnal hours on gravel, and larvae hatch
after six days. Sexual maturity is reached after two to
three years. The vairone is included in the red list of
threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [22] as "Least Concern", and
is listed in the Appendix III of the Bern Convention. In
the last years, the Italian vairone has suffered a decrease
in distribution range and in population size due to habitat
degradation.
Here, we use the endemic Italian vairone (Telestes muticellus) as a model to assess the phylogeographic history of
primary freshwater fishes in Italy [23]. This species
appears highly suitable for this purpose, as it has a fragmented distribution that is restricted to Central and
northern Italy and, there, covers the two main ichthyogeographic districts (PV and TL). Previous phylogeographic studies based on mtDNA indicated a population
genetic structure largely in agreement with these ichthyogeographic districts but, at the same time, highlighted a
more complex distribution of haplotypes in the Tyrrhenian basins of Liguria, where the freshwater fauna is considered introduced [10,24,17]. However, these studies
were based on relatively small sets of populations only,
and the results have not been corroborated with nuclear
DNA markers. In this study, we used a sample of 38 populations (N = 509) covering the entire distribution range
of T. muticellus and representing all relevant drainage
systems, and applied eight microsatellite markers to infer
the phylogeographic history of this species. Specifically,
we were interested in the question whether populations

of T. muticellus are structured according to the main ichthyogeographic districts that have been proposed on the
basis of the distribution of cyprinid fish but without taking genetic information into account. We also aimed at
identifying potential glacial refugia permitting vairone
populations to outlive periods of maximal glacial extensions during Quaternary ice ages, as well as possible postglacial re-colonization routes. The "permeability" of
major barriers (such as the Apennine) was of particular
interest to us. Finally, by integrating our population
genetic data, sea level fluctuations information and the
bathymetric profiles of the Adriatic Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea, we intended to reconstruct the ways by which
vairone populations dispersed and to suggest the recent
changes in the hydrographic pattern that allowed the dispersion of the vairone from one basin into another.

Methods
Sampling

A total of 509 individuals from 38 populations were sampled between 2002 and 2008 covering the entire distribution range of T. muticellus (Fig. 1, Table 1). We sampled
between four and twenty individuals per population so
that each of the drainage systems was represented by at
least 20 individuals. Twenty-one populations belong to
the Padano-Venetian ichthyogeographic district (pops. 1
- 21), six to the Tuscano-Latium district (pops. 34 - 39)
and eleven to Ligurian basins (pops. 23 - 33) draining into
the Tyrrhenian Sea. A single population of 15 individuals
belonging to the subspecies T. souffia souffia from SouthEast France (pop. 22; Fig. 1, Table 1) was included in
order to evaluate possible hybridization events with
neighboring populations of T. muticellus (see [14,15]). All
specimens were collected using electric fishing gear; a
clip of the anal fin was preserved in 100% ethanol and
stored at 4°C as DNA sample.
Molecular analyses

Total DNA was extracted using a standard extraction kit
(DNeasy tissue kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All individuals were genotyped at eight highly informative microsatellite loci isolated for T. souffia (Lsou05, Lsou08,
Lsou09, Lsou10, Lsou11, Lsou19, Lsou21, Lsou34; [25]).
Microsatellites were amplified with fluorescently labeled
forward primers (FAM, HEX and NED). Three different
sets of markers were used such that all fragments could
be separated within a single capillary without overlap and
scored unambiguously. The first set included Lsou05,
Lsou08 and Lsou19, the second set included Lsou10 and
Lsou34, and the third set included Lsou09, Lsou11 and
Lsou21. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in 10
μL reaction volumes containing 5 μL QIAGEN Multiplex
PCR Master mix, 3 μL ddH2O, 1 μL DNA (20 ng/μL) and
1 μL primer mix (2 pmol/μL per primer) on a Veriti ther-

mal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR profile started
with an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 90 s at 56°C, 90 s at
72°C and ended with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.
Fragment lengths were determined with the internal size
marker Genescan-500 ROX (Applied Biosystems) on an
AB 3130 automated capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and scored with GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analyses

Allele binning was performed with TANDEM[26]. The
software MSA[27] was used to determine mean microsatellite allele numbers (AN), observed heterozygosities (Ho)
and expected heterozygosities (He) within populations.
GENEPOP version 3.2a [28] was employed to estimate deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) across
populations (within loci) and across loci (within populations) using the probability test, with 10000 dememorization steps, 100 batches and 5000 iterations per batch
based on the approach by Guo and Thompso [29]. Computation of pair wise multilocus FST values [30] among
populations, as well as RST and FIS values was performed
using the software ARLEQUIN version 3.1 [31] with 1000
permutation and an allowing a level of missing data of
0.05. Allele frequencies, a pair wise population matrix of
Nei's genetic distance were computed by GENEALEX[32].
A neighbor joining (NJ; [33]) population tree was generated based on Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards chord distances (DC) [34], which were calculated in PHYLIP version
3.67 [35]. Following the recommendation of Van Dongen
[36] with respect to relatively low numbers of loci, 10000
bootstrap pseudo-replicates were performed over individuals rather than loci. Bootstrap replicates were generated using the application SEQBOOT (available in PHYLIP
package).
Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA, [37]), which
displays the genetic similarity among samples in a threedimensional graphical space, and an assessment of the
genetic variability in each population were undertaken
using the software GENETIX version 4.02 [38]. STRUCTURE
version 2.2 [39] was used to determine the population
structure by Bayesian clustering analysis, with a burn-in
of 5 × 104 and 106 iterations, and not using prior population information. The most likely value for the number of
populations (K) was determined by the "L(K)" method
suggested by Evanno et al. [40], varying K from a minimum of one to a maximum of 11 and always performing
10 runs for each value of K.
Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA),
based on allele frequency information [41], was carried
out using ARLEQUIN. Variance components were
extracted for the (i) among group, (ii) between sampling

sites within groups, and (iii) within sampling sites hierarchical levels. The populations were partitioned into
groups according to their geography and following the
outcomes of the pair wise multilocus FST calculations, the
FCA, the NJ tree and the Bayesian clustering analysis.

Results
Two of the microsatellite markers could not be successfully amplified in a small number of populations and were
coded as missing data for the subsequent analyses:
Lsou09 in populations 20 and 21, and Lsou11 in populations 20, 21, 22 and 26 (Additional file 1). All eight microsatellite loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles
ranged from 9 to 17 at any single locus (mean 13.4). Mean
expected heterozygosity per population ranged from 0.12
(s. d. 0.27, pop. 38) to 0.6 (s. d. 0.21, pop. 3), and averaged
0.45 across all loci and populations. In general, the differences between expected and observed heterozygosities
were low, ranging from 0 to 0.16 (mean 0.05) (see Additional file 1 for more details).
Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were observed in a number of populations
and mainly in two loci, Lsou09 and Lsou11. This was
most likely due to problems with the amplification of
these loci in a small subset of samples (see above), which
resulted in missing data in the evaluation of the departure
from HWE. In the remaining loci the departures from
HWE were due to an excess of homozygosity (Additional
file 1).
FST within loci and among populations were highest for
Lsou10 (0.46), Lsou11 (0.5) and Lsou34 (0.4) (Additional
file 2). Allele frequencies of all populations belonging to
the Tuscano-Latium district showed a genetic pattern different from the other populations (Additional file 3). Populations from middle Adriatic (20 and 21) had
characteristic allelic patterns in Lsou08 and Lsou21, while
population 22, constituted by T. souffia, was characterized by a private allelic pattern in loci Lsou05, Lsou09,
Lsou19 and Lsou34.
Nei's distances among populations also indicate the
great difference between the single population of T. souffia souffia and the populations of T. muticellus. Six principal groups of populations were recovered by FST and
RST (Additional file 2) and Nei's distance (not shown): (i)

the largest group included the specimens from the Venetian basins (pops. 1 and 2), the Po basin (pops. 3 to 19)
plus the populations of Central Liguria (pops. 27, 28 and
29); (ii) a second group included two populations from
West Liguria (pops. 23 and 24), which showed the lowest
Nei's distance to populations from the opposite side of
Apennine chain (pops. 15, 16 and 17) belonging to the
Padano-Venetian district; (iii) the third group included
specimens from middle Adriatic and showed large distances to all the others populations; (iv) individuals from
Tuscano-Latium district form the fourth group (pops. 34
to 39); (v) individuals from East Liguria (pops. 30 to 33),
which showed the smallest distance to populations of
Tuscany, formed another group. The remaining two populations from Western Liguria (pops. 25 and 26) showed
FST and Nei's distance values intermediate between the
Padano-Venetian populations and the other two Western
Ligurian populations (pops. 23 and 24); (vi) the last group
is equivalent to population 22 (T. souffia souffia) and was
excluded from the further analyses - also, because there
was no sign of introgression with neighboring T. muticellus populations in a STRUCTURE analysis.
Because of the unsuccessful amplification of two loci in
a few populations, two NJ trees were constructed, one
with all populations without the two not amplified loci
(Fig. 2a), and one with all loci without the populations
with missing amplifications (not shown). The general
topology of the two trees was in agreement and in congruence with the pattern of the observed FST values
among populations. Four main groups were recovered: (i)
the populations of the Padano-Venetian district (pops. 1
to 19) plus Central Liguria (pops. 27 to 29) and including
a clade formed by the populations from Western Liguria
(pops. 23 to 26); (ii) the two populations from the Middle
Adriatic (pops. 20 and 21); (iii) populations from East
Liguria (pops. 30 to 33); and (iv) populations from the
Tuscano-Latium district (pops. 34 to 39). These clades
were supported by high bootstrap values (Fig. 2a).
In the FCA plot of the entire data set, three main clusters of individuals were resolved: (i) the Tuscano-Latium
and East Ligurian populations; (ii) the populations from
the Middle Adriatic; and (iii) populations belonging to
the Po basin, the Venetian basins, and the West and Central Ligurian basins (Additional file 4a). The first three

then divided the data set according to the two sea catchments. The FCA conducted on the Adriatic basins
showed the distinction between the middle Adriatic basin
and the rest of the Padano-Venetian district (Additional

another one by the Tuscano-Latium populations (Additional file 4c).
The most probable number of K populations in the
Bayesian clustering analysis was 5 when applying the
"L(K)" method suggested by Evanno et al. [40] (Fig. 2b;
Additional file 5). With K = 5, a population structure with
four principal groups was recovered: (i) individuals from
the Veneto and Po River populations (pops. 1 to 19) and
Central Liguria (pops. 27 to 29); (ii) individuals from the
Middle Adriatic populations (pops. 20 and 21); (iii) individuals from West Liguria (pops. 23 to 26); and (iv) specimens from East Liguria (pops. 30 to 33) and TuscanyLatium (pops. 34 to 39). The genomes of the first group
consisted of two distinct genetic pools.
In order to quantify population genetic structuring
within and among populations a hierarchical AMOVA
was computed grouping the populations into five groups
following the grouping suggested by FST analysis, the
FCA, the NJ tree and the Bayesian assignment tests.
Twenty-nine percent of the variation occurred among
groups, 7.7% among populations within groups, and
62.8% of the variation was attributed within populations
(Additional file 6). FIS values are shown in Additional file

Discussion
Population structure and phylogeography of the Italian
vairone

Our phylogeographic and population genetic analyses
based on eight microsatellite markers identified five principal clusters of populations in the Italian vairone. We
used information on the geographic origin of the populations, the population NJ tree, the FCA plots as well as the
results from the Bayesian assignment test to infer these
groups. We note, however, that - despite of the overall
support for this grouping - certain analyses resulted in a
somewhat deviating picture. These cases are discussed
below.
The most widespread group I corresponds to the
Padano-Venetian district and includes populations from
two Upper Adriatic basins (pops. 1 and 2) and the Po
drainage (pops. 3 to 19). The geographic extension of
these populations reflects the expansion of the Po river
basin up to the Meso-Adriatic depression, which
occurred during the last glacial maximum coinciding
with the eustatic sea level regression by 120 m [42,43].
Interestingly, three populations of Central Ligurian
basins are also included in this group (pops. 27 to 29),
although these rivers drain into the upper Tyrrhenian
Sea. This clustering of Central Ligurian populations with
those from the Po system in all analyses clearly suggests a
limited period of "permeability" of the Apennine barrier,
allowing gene flow between the Po drainage and Central

Page 8 of 12

Liguria. Group I was consistently recovered in the STRUCanalyses and in the FCA plots. Yet, in the population tree, it did not come out as monophyletic, since
another group (group II) was resolved within group I (see
below). The population assignment tests with STRUCTURE
further indicated that the genomes of group I individuals
are composed of two genetic pools. This may be
explained by the existence of at least two isolated lineages
prior to the last glacial maximum that became admixed
secondarily.
Group II includes four populations from West Liguria
(pops. 23 to 26) and shows affinities with group I, i.e. the
fishes from the Padano-Venetian district. In the population tree, group II was actually resolved within group I
populations, while in the Bayesian population assignment
tests, group II formed a unique cluster (Fig. 2). It is evident, though, that some individuals show the genotypic
signature of group I. This pattern could be the result of
introgression of Padano-Venetian genomes from the
Central Ligurian populations into an older, isolated western Ligurian stock. Alternatively, the West Ligurian
basins might have been colonized directly from the upper
reaches of the Po system via river capture, as is indicated
by the close genetic affinity of population 18 (river Orba)
from the Po system to the geographically close populations of West Liguria (Figs. 1, 2). The individual profile of
the West Ligurian populations in the STRUCTURE analyses
might then be the result of repeated bottlenecks as a consequence of westward dispersal.
Group III consists of two populations only (pops. 20
and 21) that were sampled at the southern edge of the distribution range of T. muticellus in two rivers draining into
the Adriatic Sea (Tesino and Burano). These two populations clustered together in all analyses and appeared
equidistant from groups I and II, group VI and group V,
respectively, in the population tree and the FCA plot (Fig.
2; Additional file 4). The Padano-Venetian ichthyogeographic district, which also comprises the Middle Adriatic basin including rivers Tesino and Burano, has been
defined based on the extension of the Po basin during the
last glacial maximum due to the lowering of the sea level
[12] (Fig. 1c). Now, our new analyses of the Italian vairone
contradict the view of a close affinity of the Middle Adriatic populations to the Padano-Venetian ones, but support the existence of an isolated Middle Adriatic stock,
instead.
Group IV from East Liguria (pops. 30 to 33) was
resolved as separate cluster in the population tree and in
the FCA plot. Yet, the Bayesian analyses of population
structure suggest its close affinity to populations from the
Tuscano-Latium district (group V). An origin of the East
Ligurian T. muticellus in Tuscany has already been suggested based on mtDNA markers [17].

Group V corresponds to the populations of the Tuscano-Latium district (pops. 34 to 39) that were sampled
in the Apennine in the upper reaches of the Ombrone,
Albegna and Tevere rivers, which all drain into the middle Tyrrhenian Sea. This group was recovered in the FCA
plots and the population NJ tree. In the STRUCTURE analyses, it clusters with group IV individuals. The high levels
of genetic similarity between the six Tuscano-Latium
populations suggest that the three basins sampled shared
contact events. These are likely to have occurred in the
upper or middle watercourses, where hydrogeographic
structures appear conducive for historical transitory river
captures. Because of the large distance between the estuaries of the Ombrone and Albegna rivers to the Tevere
river and the bathymetric profile of the Tyrrhenian Sea, a
connection via downstream river confluence, e.g. during
the last glacial maximum when sea levels were substantially lower than at present, appears highly unlikely.
Previous mitochondrial DNA based studies of the Italian vairone [17,44] identified three distinct clusters,
which are, overall, in agreement to the ones identified
here. Using a smaller set of samples, Zaccara et al. [17]
found a clear separation between T. muticellus populations from Tuscany (group V in our study), East Liguria
(group IV) and the Padano-Venetian district (group I).
Interestingly, their specimens from Western Liguria
(group II) clustered together with populations from the
Po drainage, just as they do in our population tree (Fig.
2a). However, neither were Central Ligurian populations
included in the study of Zaccara et al. [17] (these belong,
according to our new analyses, to group I), nor were the
Middle Adriatic populations (our group III) studied.
Thus, with 509 specimens from 38 populations covering
the species' entire distribution range, the present work is
the most extensive phylogeographic study of T. muticellus.
A biogeographic scenario for Italian freshwater fishes

The vairone has previously been studied in the context of
postglacial re-colonization scenarios in and around the
Alps (see e.g., [14,15,17]). There are several reasons that
make this species suitable for phylogeographic research.
First, the vairone occurs in all major river systems draining off the Alps (Danube, Rhine, Rhône, Po) as well as in
many small rivers draining directly into the Mediterranean Sea. Second, the vairone is restricted to certain habitat types within these rivers, making recent large-scale
migrations highly unlikely [45]. Third, in most parts of its
distribution range, there is no evidence for humaninduced faunal translocation, so that the species' present
population structure should display its phylogeographic
history. In the present study, we use the Italian vairone (T.
muticellus) as a model to infer the phylogeography of Ital-

Page 9 of 12

ian freshwater fish species, suggesting a scenario that
might serve as a model for other species as well. Specifically, we were interested in the ways by which the vairone,
a reophilic species, was able to colonize different river
basins through different routes. This should allow us to
suppose recent changes in the shape and connection of
the hydrographic basins at regional and local scale.
A first outcome from our study is that the populations
of T. muticellus are highly structured and fall into five distinct groups, which correspond to geographic areas and
drainage systems (see above). Overall, our analyses highlight the existence of strong barriers between geographic
areas and major drainage systems, which is reflected in
the discrete clustering of populations according to drainage systems, as well as in the significant FST-values
between populations even within drainages (Additional
file 2).
In our analyses based on nuclear markers, the Apennine emerges as a strong barrier between populations
from PV (pops. 1-19) and TL (pops. 34-39). This is in
contrast to previous mtDNA based results. Using the
very same samples as we do here, Zaccara et al. [17]
found mtDNA haplotypes of Tuscano-Latium origin in
the Po basin, pointing to a past connection between these
two major ichthyogeographic districts. This discrepancy
between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA is best
explained by a scenario in which some individuals
crossed the watershed from the TL district into tributaries of the Po basin. While the descendant lines kept their
TL identity in the mtDNA (due to the clonal mode of
inheritance of mtDNA), their original nuclear DNA signature disappeared (due to repeated and unidirectional
crosses with PV fish leading to a homogenization of the
genome towards the native type). This scenario dates the
connection between the Padano-Venetian and the Tuscano-Latium ichthyogeographic district in an epoch
ancient enough to maintain the genetic differences in the
mtDNA, but not in the microsatellites (dated in 0.5 millions years ago by Stefani et al. [44]). This outcome also
illustrates the importance of studying both mtDNA and
ncDNA to infer a species' phylogeographic history.
While, with the eight microsatellite markers applied, we
could not detect the obviously more ancient introgression
event(s) in T. muticellus between the two ichthyogeographic districts, several more recent contacts between
vairone populations within the two districts became evident. In the PV district, the contacts between isolated
basins, e.g. between the Po drainage (pops. 3-19), the Bacchiglione (pop. 2), and the Tagliamento (pop. 1), were
possible during periods of glaciation, when the sea level
was markedly lowered (see also Salzburger et al. [15]).
During these periods, the estuary of the Po reached the
middle Adriatic pit, connecting the rivers of the entire PV

Marchetto et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:111
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/111

ichthyogeographic district via downstream river confluence (Fig. 1c). The bathymetric profile of the Adriatic Sea,
which is a shallow sea with a gently declining profile,
made river confluence possible. The Tyrrhenian Sea, on
the other hand, is rather deep and has a much steeper
profile, so that downstream river confluence is a rather
unlikely cause for the observed gene flow between rivers
of the TL district. There, historical connections in the
middle and upper courses of the rivers, caused by local
plate-tectonic events along the Apennine ridge, are most
probably responsible for faunal exchange [46,47]. The
genesis and the evolution of the Apennine chain favored
such kind of exchange, with a wrinkle structure that
caused the formation of valleys parallel to the direction of
the mountain chain. On the Tyrrhenian side, rivers follow
these valleys for long traits, assuming a trend with a
North-South orientation, while, on the Adriatic side, rivers are principally orthogonal to the mountain chain. The
closing of these valleys could cause the overflowing with
the outlet of a river into those of the adjacent valley [48].
Connections between rivers belonging to different sides
of a watershed were also suggested for rivers with terminally aligned traces, such as river Lerone and Orba (see
Table 1 and Fig. 1) [48]. Such temporal connections
between rivers in the past can also explain the phylogeographic pattern observed in the Ligurian basins, where
"passover events" occurred from the PV district along the
west side of the Alpine chain (pops. 23-26), and from the
TL district along the upper Tyrrhenian slope of the Apennine chain (pops. 30-33). The origin of the Middle Adriatic populations (pops. 20 and 21) remains somewhat
elusive.
From our analyses at least four different refugia can be
delineated, where Italian vairone populations outlived the
last glacial maximum: one for the Upper Adriatic basins,
one for the Middle Adriatic rivers, one in the TuscanoLatium area and at least one in (East) Liguria. The areal
expansion in the Italian vairone has already been implicated with population bottlenecks (in the refugia) followed by demographic expansions, as a consequence of
environmental alterations during these periods [17]. Our
new analyses corroborate this view.
The population assignment tests with STRUCTURE indicate the existence of two distinct refugia for the Upper
Adriatic basins, since the genomes of the sampled individuals appear admixed from more than one genetic pool.
The formation of different genetic pools can be attributed
to the cyclic variation of the sea level of the Adriatic Sea
during glacial cycles. In periods of maximal glaciation,
the Po connected all river systems as far as to the MesoAdriatic depression (see Fig. 1c); during these cold periods, the typical vairone habitat shifted towards lower altitudes, whereas - during interglacial periods - the present
situation with many isolated populations was restored

Page 10 of 12

[45]. Several factors may account for the generally high
degree of isolation between Italian vairone populations,
particularly in the Adriatic drainages. First, suboptimal
environmental conditions during cold periods could although allowing for survival of vairone populations have inhibited long distance dispersal, thereby limiting
gene flow. Such a situation has been reported for the minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus), another cold-adapted rheophilic freshwater fish species [49]. Second, the sandy
substrate on the bottom of the Adriatic Sea, which is
where the rivers drained to during glaciation (see Fig. 1c),
appears unsuitable for egg deposition by the vairone.
Since the vairone requires gravely, shallow and well-oxygenated waters, proper spawning grounds may only have
been available in the middle parts of rivers, again limiting
dispersal. Finally, the (temporarily) increased salinity levels close to the river mouths could have led to barriers for
downward migration for stenohaline species such as the
vairone.

Conclusion
Taken together, the following phylogeographic scenario
arises for T. muticellus: an initial T. muticellus stock
became isolated from its 'Alpine' allies, possibly triggered
by the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis some five million
years ago [15]. The Italian vairone survived the various
glaciation cycles in several refugia, most likely situated in
the Upper Adriatic (groups I and II), the Middle Adriatic
(group III), (East) Liguria (group IV) and TuscanoLatium (group V); the latter two show closer affinities
(see Fig. 2) and might originate from a common Tyrrhenian stock. This grouping is, overall, in agreement with
the two main ichthyogeographic districts, Padano-Venetian and Tuscano-Latium, except for the two populations
in the Middle Adriatic, which we identify as additional
major district. Although in principle dividing the PV and
TL districts, the Apennine barrier was "permeable" at
some point, leading to the introgression of mitochondrial
haplotypes from Tuscano-Latium into the Po drainage
[17]; this can be the result of local events of river capture,
as suggested by Ghelardoni [48]. Owing to a more complex phylogeographic history, the T. muticellus stocks in
the isolated smaller rivers in Liguria do not form a unique
cluster. Populations from East Liguria group with those of
the Tuscano-Latium district, whereas stocks from Central and West Liguria show affinities to the Padano-Venetian fishes (note that it is unlikely that this situation is due
to recent human-induced faunal introductions in Liguria
as suggested by Balma et al. [50], since most of the Ligurian populations do show private genetic signatures).
Future studies in other freshwater taxa will now be necessary to evaluate the universal validity of the "vairone scenario" proposed here.
