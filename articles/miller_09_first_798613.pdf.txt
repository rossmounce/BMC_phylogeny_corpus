Abstract
Background: Arcobacter spp. are a common contaminant of food and water, and some species,
primarily A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus, have been isolated increasingly from human diarrheal stool
samples. Here, we describe the first Arcobacter multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method for A.
butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii, A. cibarius and A. thereius.
Results: A sample set of 374 arcobacters, including 275 A. butzleri, 72 A. cryaerophilus, 15 A. skirrowii
and 8 A. cibarius isolates from a wide variety of geographic locations and sources, was typed in this
study. Additionally, this sample set contained four strains representing a new Arcobacter species, A.
thereius. The seven loci used in the four-species Arcobacter MLST method are the same as those
employed previously in C. jejuni, C. coli, C. helveticus and C. fetus (i.e. aspA, atpA(uncA), glnA, gltA, glyA,
pgm and tkt). A large number of alleles were identified at each locus with the majority of isolates
containing a unique sequence type. All Arcobacter isolates typed in this study contain two glyA genes,
one linked to lysS (glyA1) and the other linked to ada (glyA2). glyA1 was incorporated into the
Arcobacter MLST method while glyA2 was not because it did not increase substantially the level of
discrimination.
Conclusion: No association of MLST alleles or sequence types with host or geographical source
was observed with this sample set. Nevertheless, the large number of identified alleles and
sequence types indicate that this MLST method will prove useful in both Arcobacter strain
discrimination and in epidemiological studies of sporadic Arcobacter-related gastroenteritis. A new
Arcobacter MLST database was created http://pubmlst.org/arcobacter/; allele and ST data generated
in this study were deposited in this database and are available online.

Background

The genus Arcobacter is a member of the Gram-negative, εProteobacterial subdivision. The majority of isolated arcobacters belong to one of three species: Arcobacter butzleri,
A. cryaerophilus or A. skirrowii. Additional members of this
taxon include: A. cibarius, isolated from broiler carcasses
[1]; A. nitrofigilis, a nitrogen-fixing organism isolated originally from estuarine plant roots [2]; A. halophilus, isolated
from a hypersaline lagoon [3]; Candidatus Arcobacter
sulfidicus, a sulfide-oxidizing marine organism [4]; A.
mytili sp. nov., isolated from mussels [5]; A. thereius sp.
nov, isolated from pigs and ducks [6] and A. marinus sp.
nov [7]. Arcobacter butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii and
A. cibarius have been isolated often from both animals [810] and food sources [10-13], water and agricultural runoff [10,14-16], and domestic pets [17].
The prevalence of arcobacters in food, raw milk and water
would suggest a potential for food- or water-borne Arcobacter-associated human illness. Arcobacter spp., primarily
A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus, have been isolated from
human diarrheal stool samples [18-22]. However, no
direct connection between consumption of Arcobactercontaminated food or water and human illness has been
established, although it is likely that transmission of arcobacters occur via these routes. Arcobacter spp. have been
isolated also from the stools of healthy humans [20,23].
Thus, while host predispositions such as age and immune
status may play a role, it is possible that some A. butzleri
and A. cryaerophilus strains are non-pathogenic and are
human commensals. The presence of a subset of nonpathogenic strains alongside pathogenic strains within A.
butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and perhaps the other food- and
water-associated Arcobacter species, such as A. skirrowii
and A. cibarius, would indicate a need for an accurate typing method to distinguish human-pathogenic and
human-commensal arcobacters. Arcobacter typing methodology would also be useful in studies of transmission
routes and source tracking during outbreak and extended
epidemiological investigations. Typing of Arcobacter
strains using such methods as enterobacterial repetitive
intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis has been reported (reviewed in
[10]).
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), a typing method
based on partial, yet defined, sequence information at
seven housekeeping loci, was developed first within the εProteobacteria for C. jejuni [24]. It has proven useful for
strain characterization, lineage identification and C. jejuni
epidemiology (reviewed in [25]). Within Campylobacter,
MLST methods are available also for C. coli [26,27], C. lari
[27], C. upsaliensis [27], C. helveticus [27], C. fetus [28] and
C. insulaenigrae [29]. The existence of multiple MLST

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/196

methods within a genus provides insights into much
broader areas, such as the degree of horizontal gene transfer between species and bacterial evolution and speciation
within a genus; MLST can provide additional, clarifying
genotypic information for a novel or potentially novel
species [29]. Development of the non-jejuni Campylobacter
MLST methods was assisted by the availability of draft C.
coli, C. lari and C. upsaliensis genomes [30]. Construction
of degenerate primer sets, based on alignments of these
genome sequences at the seven MLST loci, permitted
extension of the MLST methods into two species, C. insulaenigrae and C. helveticus, for which no genomic information existed [27,29]. Similarly, the existence of the
recently completed A. butzleri strain RM4018 genome
[31], as well as a draft genome of A. halophilus strain
LA31B (Miller et al., unpublished data), provided useful
information for the development of an MLST method
suitable for typing of Arcobacter species.
Here, we describe a new MLST method for multiple Arcobacter species, including the three most frequently-isolated Arcobacter spp., A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A.
skirrowii. The Arcobacter MLST gene set is identical to the C.
jejuni gene set (i.e. aspA, atpA(uncA), glnA, gltA, glyA, pgm
and tkt), permitting phylogenetic comparison of data
across the two genera. A sample set of 374 isolates of
diverse geographic origin and source was typed in this
study. Almost 300 sequence types and 1176 alleles across
seven loci were identified.

Results and Discussion
Design of the Arcobacter multilocus sequence typing
method
In order to optimize cross-species and cross-genus comparisons, the four genes (atpA(uncA), glnA, glyA and tkt)
common to the Campylobacter MLST methods described
previously [24,26-29], together with the three additional
loci (aspA, gltA and pgm) present within the C. jejuni
method [24], were targeted in the Arcobacter MLST
method. For optimal phylogenetic comparison, the same
allelic endpoints were considered. Development of the
Arcobacter MLST method was assisted by the concurrent
completion of the A. butzleri strain RM4018 genome
sequence [31]. Gene sequences for the seven C. jejuni
MLST loci were extracted, where applicable, from the
existing Arcobacter and thermotolerant Campylobacter
genome sequences, and aligned. Degenerate primers, situated approximately 300 bp upstream and downstream
from the allelic endpoints, were designed and 94 Arcobacter strains (i.e. 69 A. butzleri, 21 A. cryaerophilus and 4
A. skirrowii) were amplified and sequenced. Sequence
information from this sample set was aligned and used to
construct the butzleri-specific primers listed in Table S1
[see additional file 1]. For the non-butzleri species, some
loci did not amplify efficiently, using primers based on

Page 2 of 10

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:196

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/196

the Campylobacter/Arcobacter alignments. For these loci,
improved primer pairs were constructed by incorporating
sequences from the draft A. halophilus genome (Miller et
al., unpublished data) into the Campylobacter/Arcobacter
alignments. These improved primer pairs efficiently
amplified the seven MLST loci (i.e. aspA, atpA, glnA, gltA,
glyA, pgm and tkt) of A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii [see
additional file 1 - Table S1].
Initial typing of the Arcobacter sample set at the glyA locus
resulted in mixed sequencing reads for some strains, suggesting that at least two glyA genes might be present. The
presence of multiple glyA genes was confirmed later upon
completion of the A. butzleri strain RM4018 genome [31].
In this strain, two nearly-identical, complete glyA genes
are present in the genome, one (glyA1) linked to lysS and
the other (glyA2) to ada. Therefore, to eliminate generation of mixed traces, amplification primers were designed
within the lysS and ada genes. PCRs using the lysS and glyA
reverse primers amplified specifically glyA1 and PCRs
using the ada and glyA forward primers amplified specifically glyA2. All Arcobacter isolates typed in this study contained at least two glyA genes, suggesting that the presence
of multiple glyA genes is an unusual feature common to
the genus. The glyA locus in other Campylobacter MLST
methods is also linked to lysS. For this reason, and for the
fact that the glyA2 locus is less discriminatory than glyA1
(see below), the lysS-linked glyA1 locus was incorporated
into the Arcobacter typing method.
Arcobacter strain characterization
To address the ability of the Arcobacter MLST method to
amplify successfully as many A. butzleri strains as possible,

we wanted a large sample set with broad geographic origins and sources. A description of the Arcobacter isolates
by geographic origin and source is listed in Tables 1 and
2. A total of 275 A. butzleri isolates were typed, as well as
an additional 99 isolates representing other Arcobacter
species, e.g. A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii [see additional
file 2 - Table S2]. All 366 A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii and A. thereius isolates amplified and sequenced successfully with one or more of the primer pairs listed in
Table S1 [see additional file 1]. Arcobacter cibarius demonstrated variable tkt amplification results, i.e. weak amplification of some loci with each primer pair and no primer
pair amplifying all loci [see additional file 1 - Table S1].
Genetic diversity of the Arcobacter MLST loci
A large number of Arcobacter MLST alleles and sequence
types (STs) were identified in this study (Table 3). Allelic
density (i.e. no. alleles/no. strains) ranged from approximately 30% (111/374) at the glnA locus to 63% (236/
374) at the glyA1 locus. The high density of alleles translated also into a large number of STs (Table 3). Among the
275 A. butzleri isolates characterized in this study, 208 STs
were identified. In fact, among all of the Arcobacter STs, no
more than five strains were determined to possess the
same ST and 228 of 374 strains (61%) contained unique
STs. A large percentage of variable sites were identified at
all of the Arcobacter MLST loci (Table 4). Arcobacter cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii strains contained the highest
number of variable sites per locus, relative to the number
of alleles identified, and the largest number of variable
sites for all species occurred at the glyA and/or pgm loci.

The identification of MLST alleles associated with particular food animal sources was first described in C. coli [32].
However, analysis of the A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus
MLST alleles and STs revealed no apparent host-association. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of A. butzleri and
A. cryaerophilus alleles and STs did not identify any clusters
or groups associated with geographic origin
The dn/ds ratio (i.e., the ratio of substitution rates at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites) was substantially < 1
for all of the MLST loci characterized in this study (Table
4), ranging from 0.000 at A. butzleri gltA to 0.181 at A. skirrowii tkt. These low values for the Arcobacter MLST loci are
consistent with those described previously for Campylobacter [24,27,29], indicating that those loci in both genera
are not subject to positive selection.
The presence of a large number of MLST alleles within the
Arcobacter sample set might indicate that the Arcobacter
MLST alleles are genetically unstable, prone to change

either by accumulation of point mutations or horizontal
gene transfer. Four A. butzleri type strain isolates, obtained
from different labs and including the genome sequence
strain RM4018, were typed in this study. In addition, 17
related strains, isolated after passage of the A. butzleri type
strain through swine, were also typed. As expected, all 21
strains were the same sequence type, ST-1, and contained
the same glyA2 allele (data not shown), suggesting that A.
butzleri STs are relatively stable, even after passage through
a food animal.
Association of Arcobacter alleles and STs with species
and subgroups
Within each of the aspA, atpA, glnA, gltA, pgm and tkt loci,
phylogenetically discrete clusters were identified that
associated with species (data not shown). An example is
illustrated in Figure 1A for the atp locus, showing that the
A. butzleri, A. skirrowii, A. thereius and A. cryaerophilus alleles form distinct groups. However, for the latter species
two separate clusters, termed here 'group 1' and 'group 2'

were observed. Two phylogenetically-distinct clusters of
A. cryaerophilus alleles were identified also at the glnA, gltA,
pgm and tkt loci [see additional file 2 - Table S2], but not
at the aspA locus that formed only one cluster. The existence of species-associated clustering at these six loci permits tentative identification of lateral transfer events.
These events were not observed in A. butzleri because no
alleles related phylogenetically to other species were identified, however, alleles related phylogenetically to those
identified in A. butzleri were identified within A. cibarius
and A. skirrowii (i.e. tkt-90, tkt-91, aspA-73 and glnA-1).
Similarly, A. skirrowii alleles were identified within A. cryaerophilus and A. thereius (e.g. aspA-125 and glnA-95), and
an A. thereius allele was identified in A. cryaerophilus (glyA306; see Figure 1B). Lateral transfer events identified by
MLST have been reported previously [27,32].
Clustering of the glyA alleles (including alleles at both glyA
genes) is noticeably different from clustering at the other
six loci (Figure 1B). Here, as at the other six loci, the A. butzleri and A. thereius glyA alleles form separate clusters distinct from the alleles of the other characterized
arcobacters. However, the glyA alleles of A. cryaerophilus
and A. skirrowii are indistinguishable phylogenetically,
with the A. cibarius glyA alleles forming a deep branch
within the A. cryaerophilus/A. skirrowii cluster. Additionally, the A. cryaerophilus/A. skirrowii glyA cluster is highly
divergent, relative to the A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii
clusters at the other MLST loci.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Arcobacter STs, following
CLUSTAL alignment of the concatenated allele sequences
for each unique profile, indicated that these STs clustered
also by species (Figure 2). Arcobacter thereius profiles
formed a clade distinct from A. skirrowii and the other
Arcobacter species, providing additional evidence that the
strains within this clade are exemplars of a novel Arcobacter species. Two groups of A. cryaerophilus profiles were
observed: 'group 1' and 'group 2' profiles were composed
primarily of 'group 1' and 'group 2' MLST alleles, respectively. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell protein

extracts and 16S restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, two subgroups within A. cryaerophilus
were identified by Kiehlbauch et al. and Vandamme et al.
[33,34]. These A. cryaerophilus subgroups differ also in
their fatty-acid composition, specifically in the amounts
of 16:1 cis 9 and 16:1 trans 9 fatty acids [33], and in their
AFLP profiles [35], although they are not differentiated by
DNA:DNA hybridization analysis [33]. Only 7 of the 72
A. cryaerophilus strains in this study were characterized previously at the subgroup level by either AFLP or whole protein profiling [see additional file 2 - Table S2]. However,
the subgroup identities of these strains did not correlate
well with the MLST groups. Considering these results, it is
possible that the cryaerophilus subgroups identified by
Vandamme et al. [33] are not analogous to the MLST
groups identified here, although additional investigations
will be necessary to resolve this issue.
The Arcobacter glyA1 and glyA2 loci
As described above, Arcobacter strains contain two
unlinked glyA genes in their genomes. The ada-linked
glyA2 alleles are less discriminatory than the lysS-linked
glyA1 alleles: incorporation of glyA2 into the typing
scheme in place of glyA1 would result in 197 STs for A butzleri, instead of 208, and 58 STs for A. cryaerophilus,
instead of 59. Therefore, this reduced level of discrimination was one of the reasons why the ada-linked glyA2 locus
was not incorporated into the Arcobacter MLST method.
Additionally, inclusion of both glyA loci in the Arcobacter
MLST method, thus creating an eight-locus typing
scheme, would not increase significantly the discriminatory power of the seven locus method. A large number of
STs contain different glyA1 and glyA2 alleles: for example,
the A. butzleri genome sequence strain RM4018 contains
the glyA-1 allele at the glyA1 locus and glyA-142 at the
glyA2 locus [see additional file 2 - Table S2].

The presence of two highly-similar glyA loci is an unusual
feature of the Arcobacter genomes and multiple copy genes
are not generally members of MLST schemes. However,
the data suggest that despite the presence of two glyA loci

Condensed dendrogram of unique Arcobacter STs. For each unique ST, the profile allele sequences were extracted and
concatenated. The concatenated allele sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X (ver. 2.0.5). The dendrogram was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm and the Kimura two-parameter distance estimation method. Bootstrap values of
>75%, generated from 500 replicates, are shown at the nodes. The scale bar represents substitutions per site. The tree is
rooted to C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168. The A. halophilus strain LA31B concatenated sequence was extracted from the draft A.
halophilus genome. 'Group 1' A. cryaerophilus sequence types include: ST-209, ST-220, ST-221, ST-231, ST-232 and ST-270.

within every strain, the Arcobacter glyA loci are remarkably
stable. There is no compelling evidence in this study (with
the possible exception of ST-240) of gene conversion
events between the two glyA genes (manifesting as the
presence of both identical and different glyA1/glyA2 alleles
within an ST), and only one putative lateral transfer event
was identified at glyA. Therefore, inclusion of glyA1 in the

typing scheme is merited, since the large number of glyA
alleles identified in this study would substantially
enhance Arcobacter strain discrimination.

Conclusion
The large number of MLST alleles and STs identified in
this study indicates that the Arcobacter MLST method

described here is useful for strain discrimination for the
three major Arcobacter species, i.e. A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii, as well as two additional Arcobacter
species, A. thereius and A. cibarius. Additional genomic
sequence data should permit revision and expansion of
this typing method into additional Arcobacter species. No
association, with either host or geographical source, of
Arcobacter alleles or STs was observed in this study; however, the large suite of alleles and STs present within this
sample set make identification of such associations difficult, since most alleles and STs were observed infrequently. Typing of additional Arcobacter isolates, thereby
increasing potentially the numbers of each allele and ST,
may reveal heretofore undetected association patterns
within this genus. The increasing association of arcobacters with human illness, transmitted potentially by
contaminated food or water, makes this method a valuable addition to Arcobacter typing. This method should
prove useful in investigations of sporadic and outbreak
arcobacterioses and Arcobacter epidemiology.

The A. butzleri set typed in this study consisted of 275 isolates from 16 countries across four continents (N. America, Europe, Asia and Africa), and from a wide variety of
food sources and animals (Tables 1 and 2); additionally
102 strains (37%) were isolated from both healthy and
diarrheal human stool samples [see additional file 2 Table S2]. Furthermore, to assess the versatility of the
Arcobacter MLST method in typing strains of non-butzleri
species, we assembled a set of isolates from four other
Arcobacter species: A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii, A. cibarius
and A. thereius. The size and scope of the non-butzleri sample set was limited necessarily by the relatively few isolates
available for the non-butzleri species. Nevertheless, 99
non-butzleri isolates were assembled. The majority of
these were A. cryaerophilus (N = 72) and A. skirrowii (N =
15), obtained predominantly from cattle and swine; the
remainder included eight A. cibarius strains and four A.
thereius strains. A large number of strains in the Arcobacter
strain set were of unknown origin (N = 57; 15%).
Growth conditions and chemicals
All Arcobacter strains were cultured routinely under aerobic conditions at 30°C on Brain Heart Infusion agar (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 5% (v/v)
laked horse blood (Hema Resource & Supply, Aurora,
OR). Arcobacter halophilus was grown on Brain Heart Infusion -blood media supplemented with 4% (w/v) NaCl.
PCR enzymes and reagents were purchased from New
England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Epicentre (Madison,
WI). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). DNA sequencing chemicals and capillaries were pur-

chased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). PCR
and sequencing oligonucleotides were purchased from
MWG-Biotech (High Point, NC).
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
MLST primer sets are listed in Table S1 [see additional file
1]. Each MLST amplification mixture contained: 50 ng
genomic DNA, 1 × MasterAmp PCR buffer (Epicentre,
Madison, WI), 1 × MasterAmp PCR enhancer (Epicentre),
2.5 mM MgCl2, 250 μM (each) dNTPs, 50 pmol each
primer, and 1 U Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). PCRs for MLST were performed on a Tetrad
thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the following
settings: 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 2 min. Amplicons were purified on a BioRobot
8000 workstation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cycle sequencing reactions were performed on a Tetrad thermocycler,
using the ABI PRISM BigDye terminator cycle sequencing
kit (version 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
standard protocols. Cycle sequencing extension products
were purified using BigDye XTerminator (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM
3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), using POP-7
polymer and ABI PRISM Genetic Analyzer Data Collection
and ABI PRISM Genetic Analyzer Sequencing Analysis
software.
MLSTparser3 and allele number/sequence type
assignment
The Perl program MLSTparser [27] was modified to create
the program MLSTparser3. The new features of
MLSTparser3 include: 1) incorporation of the MLST
schemes for C. fetus, C. insulaenigrae and the novel Arcobacter MLST schemes described in this study, in addition
to the original MLST schemes for C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari,
C. upsaliensis and C. helveticus; 2) automatic association of
allele with species, based on phylogenetic analyses of the
ten MLST loci present in the different Campylobacter/Arcobacter MLST methods, permitting immediate identification of chimeras; and 3) automatic assignment of
sequence type (ST), based on the profile of seven MLST
alleles. Novel alleles and STs are flagged by MLSTparser3
and assigned an arbitrary number.

MLSTparser3 was used to identify the MLST alleles and ST
of each Arcobacter strain typed in this study. A new Arcobacter MLST database was created http://pubmlst.org/
arcobacter/; allele and ST data generated in this study were
deposited in this database and are available online.
Phylogenetic analyses
Variable sites and calculation of the dn/ds ratios were performed using START2 http://pubmlst.org/software/analy
sis/. A dendrogram of unique Arcobacter STs was constructed by concatenating the allele sequences comprising

each ST. Allele sequences for each strain were concatenated in the order aspA-atpA-glnA-gltA-glyA-pgm-tkt for a
final composite length of 3341 bp; in addition, the MLST
alleles of the A. halophilus strain LA31B were extracted
from the draft genome (Miller et al., unpublished data),
concatenated and incorporated into the ST analysis.
Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALX
(ver. 2.0.5; http://www.clustal.org/), and dendrograms
were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with
the Kimura 2-parameter distance estimation method.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA version 4 [36].
