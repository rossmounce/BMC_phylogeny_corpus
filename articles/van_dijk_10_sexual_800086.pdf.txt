Abstract
Background: The evolutionary interests of males and females rarely coincide (sexual conflict), and these conflicting
interests influence morphology, behavior and speciation in various organisms. We examined consequences of
variation in sexual conflict in two closely-related passerine birds with contrasting breeding systems: the Eurasian
penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (EPT) exhibiting a highly polygamous breeding system with sexually antagonistic
interests over parental care, and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit Anthoscopus minutus (CPT). We derived
four a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory and tested these using data collected in Central Europe (EPT) and
South Africa (CPT). Firstly, we predicted that EPTs exhibit more sexually dimorphic plumage than CPTs due to more
intense sexual selection. Secondly, we expected brighter EPT males to provide less care than duller males. Thirdly, since
song is a sexually selected trait in many birds, male EPTs were expected to exhibit more complex songs than CPT males.
Finally, intense sexual conflict in EPT was expected to lead to low nest attendance as an indication of sexually
antagonistic interests, whereas we expected more cooperation between parents in CPT consistent with their socially
monogamous breeding system.
Results: Consistent with our predictions EPTs exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in plumage and more complex
song than CPTs, and brighter EPT males provided less care than duller ones. EPT parents attended the nest less
frequently and less simultaneously than CPT parents.
Conclusions: These results are consistent with sexual conflict theory: species in which sexual conflict is more
manifested (EPT) exhibited a stronger sexual dimorphism and more elaborated sexually selected traits than species
with less intense sexual conflict (CPT). Our results are also consistent with the notion that EPTs attempt to force their
partner to work harder as expected under sexual conflict: each member of the breeding pair attempts to shift the costs
of care to the other parent. More brightly colored males benefit more from desertion than dull ones, because they are
more likely to remate with a new female. Taken together, the comparison between two closely related species with
contrasting breeding systems suggest that sexual conflict over care has influenced the evolution of behavior and
morphology in penduline tits.
Background
Reproduction has long been viewed as a cooperative
exercise between male and female partners. Yet, the evolutionary interests of males and females are often different (sexual conflict, [1]). Only in the rare case of
semelparity, or when there is full and lifelong monogamy
of the pair members will the interests, e.g. in mating rate
or amount of parental care, be equal for both sexes [2,3].
Only recently, however, have researchers started to

explore the implications of sexual conflict on speciation,
breeding systems, and evolution of various life-history
traits [4-7]. Sexual conflict is a potent evolutionary force
that may mold morphology and behavior [8,9], and promote speciation [10]. For instance, behavioral traits of
dung fly, Sepsis cynipsea, in populations undergoing
intense sexual conflict diverged to a greater extent than
flies under relaxed conflict, resulting in different levels of
reproductive isolation [11]. Extra-pair copulations in
monogamous passerines may also result from sexual conflict. The negative selection for direct benefits from
extra-pair copulations for females appears to be greater
than the positive selection for indirect benefits, which

supports the notion that extra-pair copulations reflect
pre-zygotic sexual conflict [12].
Conflicts between parents over care (post-zygotic sexual conflict, [13]) emerge via a trade-off between parental
effort and alternative mating opportunities for each parent. As a result, each parent is expected to avoid the costs
of care and shift those costs to its partner [5,14]. This may
happen through a continuous adjustment of parental
effort in response to the mate's current effort (best
response rule, [15]), or through a discrete decision to
either care for the offspring or to desert the partner and
offspring [16,17]. Conflict over care typically occurs
when there is an opportunity to reduce parental contribution. For example, a parent may desert the brood when
one parent is sufficient to successfully raise the offspring
[17,18]. This may occur when resources are plentiful [19]
or when offspring require little care, as is often the case
with precocial young [20,21]. By deserting, the parent
may benefit from finding a new mate and breeding again,
thereby enhancing its reproductive success ([3,22,23], but
see: [24]). With increasing levels of polygamy, variance in
reproductive success increases and thus polygamous
breeding systems are usually associated with intense sexual selection [24-28]. Subsequently, sexual selection is
expected to act stronger in species experiencing greater
disparity in care provisioning.
Here we test a priori predictions of sexual conflict theory about the impact of sexual conflict on morphology
and behavior by comparing two closely related species of
penduline tits [29,30]: the sequentially polygynandrous
Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (henceforth
EPT) and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit
Anthoscopus minutus (henceforth CPT).
The EPT is a small passerine (body mass about 9 g)
with a widespread distribution across Europe and Central
Asia. Intense conflict between parents is indicated by several studies that showed that parental care is carried out
by a single parent only (either the male or the female)
[23,31,32]. In addition, about one third of clutches is
deserted naturally by both parents; a pattern consistent
between five European populations [23,31,33-35]. Both
polygyny and polyandry are common, and since the
deserted parents often obtain new mates both sexes may
mate with up to six partners in a single breeding season.
By deserting the clutch both males and females enhance
their own reproductive success, whereas caring reduces
reproductive success in both sexes ([23,36]; Figure 1). In
contrast, the CPT (body mass about 6 g, endemic to
southern Africa) is socially monogamous, and parents
cooperate to incubate the eggs and rear the brood
together, sometimes assisted by helpers at the nest [3638]. The pair usually stays together throughout and
sometimes across breeding seasons (Lloyd P, van Dijk RE,
Pogány Á unpublished data).

Figure 1 Sexual conflict in Eurasian penduline tits (after [23]).

Firstly, given that EPT is frequently polygamous and
thus likely experiences a larger variance in reproductive
success, we predicted more intense sexual selection in
EPT than in the socially monogamous CPT. This is
expected to result in a stronger sexual plumage dimorphism and more complex song in EPT than in CPT. Both
song and plumage are often sexually selected traits in
birds, including penduline tits ([39-41], Pogány, Á. et al.
unpublished data).
Secondly, we tested the prediction that male EPTs with
a wider eye-stripe, which signals male attractiveness
[42,43], desert the nest more often than males with a narrower eye-stripe, thus imposing the costs of parental care
on their mate. We expected that males with wider eyestripes desert more frequently than males with narrower
ones, since males with wider eye-stripes more often and
more quickly procure new mates after desertion [40]. As
such, males with wider eye-stripes should derive greater
benefits from desertion to offset the potential cost of
biparental desertion. Females mated to males with wider
eye-stripes, however, face the costs of care and/or
reduced reproductive success ([23]; Figure 1).
Finally, nests of both species are sophisticated structures (see below) and built by both sexes. Following predictions from sexual conflict theory (e.g. [5]), however,
we expected that in EPT, in which nest desertion is common, parents will attempt shifting the costs of care to
their mate. Nest desertion by both males and females
takes place at around the third day of the egg laying phase
[44-46] and the process of desertion appears to be rapid
in our population during which either the male or the
female may desert first [36,45]. This is consistent with the
prediction from sexual conflict theory that parents
attempt to force their mate to work harder [47]. Given the
intense conflict in EPT [23], a parent may abstain from
building a nest expecting its mate to make up the shortfall. Specifically, we predicted EPT pairs to attend the
nest less frequently and less synchronously during the
egg-laying phase than in CPT, in which parents are
expected to cooperate over nest attendance. In the coop-

erating CPT we predicted synchronous nest attendance
and coordinated nest building by both parents.

Results
Plumage

Consistently with the prediction, in EPT, the eye-stripes
of males were significantly (28%) larger than that of
females, whereas in CPT the size of the eye-stripe was
not different between males and females (Figure 2; sex: F
= 9.881, P = 0.002; species: F = 295.358, P < 0.001; interaction sex × species: F = 10.290, P = 0.002, N = 206 individuals; Table 1).
Male EPTs with large eye-stripes deserted their first
clutch more often than those with small and thus less
attractive eye-stripes (Figure 3a; binary logistic regression
model; model effect estimate ± SE = 2.647 ± 1.226, Wald
= 4.661, df = 1, P = 0.031, N = 121 males). Females, however, did not care more often for clutches of males with
large eye-stripes (Figure 3b; 0.222 ± 0.786, Wald = 0.080,
df = 1, P = 0.778, N = 121 males).
Song

From the song recordings of EPT (127.5 ± 48.4 min
(mean ± SD), 16 males) 2229 syllables were analyzed.
Adding all recordings from all males together, the total
number of different syllables sung in the population ('repertoire size') in EPT did not increase after 46% of the total
recording time. Additionally, after the first 52% of
recorded syllables (i.e. the first hour of recording from all
16 males) we obtained 14 out of the 16 different syllables
we recorded in total (i.e. 88%). All different syllables sung
by an individual male were obtained after 71% ± 24% of
the total number of syllables recorded per individual. We
may have underestimated the repertoire size for individual males, although this would only make our results
more conservative (see below). The song recorded from
CPT (220.9 min ± 94.3 min, 9 males) contained a total
1918 syllables. We did not find variation in the number of
different syllables sung by CPT, so we are confident that
we obtained the full repertoire size for CPT.
The song output was not significantly different between
species: EPT males sang 62.8 ± 32.0 (N = 16 males) syllables per hour at the nest, whereas CPT males sang 54.0 ±
42.8 (N = 9 males) syllables per hour (t = 0.581, P = 0.567,
N = 25 males, d = 1.461, 1-β = 0.92). EPTs used 8.3 ± 2.8

different syllables (N = 16 males), whereas song was
invariably mono-syllabic in CPT (N = 9 males; Figure 4;
one-sample t-test with test value = 1; t = 10.474, P <
0.001, d = 3.029, 1-β > 0.99).
Nest attendance

Eurasian and Cape penduline tits differed significantly in
the frequency of synchronous nest attendance by male
and female (0.20 ± 0.28% (N = 21 pairs) versus 5.56 ±
2.07% (N = 7 pairs), respectively; Figure 5; Mann Whitney
U; Z = ± 3.902, P < 0.001, N = 28 pairs, d = 2.949, 1-β
>0.99). This result was corroborated by comparing the
absolute time spent at the nest by male and female jointly
(EPT: 115s ± 162s, CPT: 2343s ± 864s; Mann Whitney U;
P < 0.001).
Comparing the expected versus observed times at the
nest by both parents, we found a significant effect of species (Figure 5; F = 20.366, P < 0.001, N = 28, η2 = 0.439, 1β = 0.99): EPTs spent significantly less time together at
the nest than expected by chance (Figure 5; 0.20% versus
3.23% of time, respectively;Z = ± 4.015, P < 0.001, N = 21

Discussion
Penduline tits (Remizinae) are emerging as one of the
model systems in investigations of parental conflict
[4,23,31,48]. Here we found support for several a priori
predictions of sexual conflict theory by comparing the

behavior and plumage dimorphism of two closely related
species. Firstly, we found substantial sexual plumage
dimorphism in EPT, but not in CPT. Secondly, we found
that EPT males had a more complex song (i.e. a larger
song repertoire) than CPT males. These results together
suggest that sexual conflict influences the evolution of
plumage dimorphism and complexity of song through
intensified sexual selection. We realize that the power to
detect a significant difference between the sexes of CPT
in size of the eye-stripe is low. However, the sample size
required to detect a sexual dimorphism in the size of the
eye-stripe in CPT, given the effect size and power (Nrequired), is unrealistically large (13581), yet with our sample
we would have been able to detect a sex difference in eyestripe size in CPT if it had been of a similar intensity as in

EPT (Nd,1-β; Table 1). Therefore eye-stripes are sexually
monomorphic in CPT. We note that EPT males and
females can easily be distinguished in the field, but not
CPTs (see various field guides), and we thus suspect our
results would be robust even with larger samples sizes.
Thirdly, we found that EPT males with wider eyestriped were more likely to desert their mate than males
with narrower eye-stripes. However, females mated to
males with wider eye-stripes did not provide care more
often than those females that were mated to males with
narrower eye-stripes. This somehow contradicts the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis, which
predicts that females mated with more attractive males
are willing to invest more in the offspring than females
mated to less attractive males [49,50]. One interpretation
is retaliation by the females to avoid being exploited by
the males: if an attractive male deserts, a female may still
desert, despite the loss of the eggs (see also [3,32]). Nevertheless, although females may obtain direct and/or
indirect benefits from mating with attractive males, they
also pay the full costs of caring or, in case they desert too,
their efforts invested in nest building and egg-laying
appear to be in vain. This points to the dilemma of EPT
females: by choosing an attractive mate she may actually
lose [8].
Sexual conflict may be associated to a process of
manipulation by one parent and resistance by the other.
This potentially affects the evolution of various traits
[2,8], and may also explain the difference in sexual dimorphism and song complexity between the two species of
penduline tit. Evidence for this arms race between male
and female partners derives from pre-copulatory sexual
conflict where males are harmful to females during copulation [2,9,51,52]. Males may, for instance, cause genital
damage to the female [51], or force the female to mate at a
suboptimal rate [4,6,9,53,54]. Males may also try to
exploit the female's perception system during mate choice
and parental investment, for instance through exaggerated sexually selected traits in males, such as ornaments
or song. Females are expected to counter-adapt through
more selective mate choice [4,6,8] leading to female resistance to mating and the evolution of exaggerated male
display to overcome this resistance ('sexually antagonistic
coevolution', [8,55]; see also [56,57]). In that light, the
evolutionary driving force of preference is resistance to
male-imposed costs, rather than gaining benefits from
mating with preferred males, as described under classic
sexual selection [6,8,55]. Mediated by such a dynamic
process male EPTs may try to manipulate their partner
via elaborate plumage and song. This, in conjunction
with resistance by the female, may have led to the exaggeration of those traits in EPT, but not in CPT.
An alternative explanation for the elaboration of traits
in EPT is the higher population density than in CPT and

Page 5 of 9

thus more intense selection driven by male-male competition [58,59]. However, this argument has been challenged [60,61] and breeding density itself is not a selective
process, but rather an environmental trait that amplifies
or de-amplifies sexual conflict. For instance, more potential mates may be available when breeding densities are
high and a parent may then benefit more from desertion
rather than caring for the offspring. We believe sexual
conflict is a more parsimonious explanation than the
alternatives, because our previous work showed strong
evidence of intense sexual conflict in EPT [23] and the
intensity of sexual conflict is unrelated to breeding density in EPT [35].
Finally, we found that EPT parents not only spend less
time overall on nest attendance than CPT, but they also
were at the nest less synchronously. The latter was also
true when we compared the estimated absolute time the
parents spent jointly at the nest, confirming that the difference in day length between our two study sites does not
alter our results. These results suggest that EPT parents
appear to avoid each other at the nest - consistent with our
argument above that one parent may force the partner to
work harder. An alternative explanation for the observed
pattern in EPT is role division so that EPT partners may
take over the job of nest building from each other rather
than actively avoiding each other at the nest. This would
also result in less time spent together at the nest, albeit that
this should be interpreted as a more cooperative behavior
as opposed to avoidance due to conflict. The fact that the
total time spent on nest attendance (total frequency of
individual and joint attendance) is lower in EPT than in
CPT, however, corroborates the idea that they actively try
to avoid each other, rather than taking over each other's
work as a cooperative effort (see [13]).
An alternative hypothesis, mate guarding [62-64], predicts the opposite pattern to what we found: due to frequent mate change and dense breeding population in
EPT, one would predict more intense mate guarding in
EPT than in CPT and thus more synchronous appearance
at the nest.
We acknowledge alternative selective processes to sexual conflict that may influence the evolution of morphology and behavior by acting themselves or acting with
sexual conflict. To establish the generality of these results
and to test alternative hypotheses, we need phylogenetic
comparative studies using the appropriate framework.
We are currently working on the first comprehensive
phylogenetic hypotheses for Remizinae (van Dijk et al, in
preparation), which will serve as backbone for future
analyses [65-67].

Conclusions
We tested a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory
using two closely-related species of penduline tits that

van Dijk et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:107
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/107

exhibit different breeding systems. Differences in behavior and morphology between the two species were consistent with the predictions of sexual conflict theory.
Although various studies have found support for these
predictions in relation to pre-zygotic sexual conflict (sexual conflict over mating), whether the same is true for
sexual conflict exhibited after fertilization was hitherto
unclear. Detailed data from the field, collected from multiple, closely-related species exhibiting a variety of breeding systems in various habitats will further advance this
field. The diverse breeding systems of penduline tits are
an excellent model system to understand how sexual conflict and cooperation may have shaped the evolution of
morphology, behavior, neuro-endocrinology and genome
of organisms.

Methods
Study sites and data collection

We studied EPTs between April and August in five consecutive breeding seasons (2003-2007) in a reed marsh at
a 1321ha fishpond system, Fehértó, in southern Hungary
(46°19'N 20°6'E), where approximately 60-90 males and
45-50 females bred each year. We studied eight and six
breeding pairs of CPT in September 2006 and 2007,
respectively, in coastal scrubland at the 572ha Koeberg
Nature Reserve near Cape Town, South Africa (33°40'S
18°26'E). The low number of monitored nests in CPT
compared to EPT is due to the lower population density
in CPT, as large territories are used by family groups [37].
Both species build similar, domed nests, initiated by the
male. In EPT males are unpaired, whereas most CPT
males are paired at the onset of building. The nest is finished and maintained jointly by both male and female
after pair formation in both species. The egg-laying phase
is initiated at a similar stage of nest building, i.e. when the
parents start building the entrance tube to the nest.
We searched both study areas for nest-building penduline tits, and visited each nest about every other day to
determine which parent attended the nest [32]. At each
EPT nest we recorded the date of pair formation. We considered a male to be mated as soon as the pair was seen
copulating near the nest or when male and female were
seen to build the nest together. For time in season we
used a date format as the number of days since 1 April in
each year. We trapped and banded birds with one numbered metal band from the Hungarian Ornithological
Institute (EPT) or the South African Bird Ringing
Scheme (CPT), and a unique combination of three color
bands (A.C. Hughes, Middlesex, UK). Three digital photographs were taken of each side of the bird's head using
an Olympus FE-100 and a Fujifilm FinePix A203 digital
camera. In all photographs we kept a ruler in the background as a reference to measure the size of the eyestripes. The birds were hand held touching the ground

Page 6 of 9

and the camera was positioned at an approximately fixed
distance (about 20 cm) from the bird to standardize aberrations. The area of the eye-stripe (to the nearest 0.01
cm2), signaling attractiveness in EPT [42,43], was quantified from the digital photographs using Adobe Photoshop
7.0. We took the average of the three measurements for
the size of the eye-stripe.
The song of 16 male EPTs was recorded in 2006 for
127.5 ± 48.4 min (mean ± SD) at a randomly selected time
of day between 06:28 and 17:50 (CET), using a Marantz
PMD 660 portable digital recorder with a Sennheiser
ME66 directional microphone. It is worth noting here
that Eurasian penduline tits, as well as other species of
penduline tits in the genus Remiz, sing little compared to
other species of song birds and do not engage in the dawn
or dusk chorus (van Dijk, RE, Bot, S, and Pogány, Á, pers.
obs.). Using the same equipment as for EPT, we recorded
the song of 9 CPT males (recording time 220.9 min ± 94.3
min). All recordings for CPT were made during the
morning (06:20 - 11:30 UTC). For both species, in the
analyses we only included song recordings from mated
males. Sonograms of the recordings were created and
analyzed using Audacity v. 1.2.6 and Avisoft-SASLab
Light v. 3.74.
To investigate nest attendance during nest building,
which continues through the laying period, we filmed
nests in 2006 and 2007 in both EPT and CPT using a
time-lapse video camera (Sony digital handycam, DCRHC44E) storing one frame every five seconds. In CPT we
knew precisely the date when the first egg was laid, and
nest attendance of parents was recorded during the second and third days of egg-laying (547 min ± 82 min per
day, N = 7 pairs). In EPT egg-laying dates were often not
known, therefore we recorded nest attendance from after
pair formation and during egg-laying for EPT (329 min ±
184 min per day, N = 21 pairs), i.e. a more extended
period than for CPT. The period before egg-laying
involves more nest building than maintenance. We anticipate that this would not influence our results, since the
parents are expected to spend more time at the nest during nest building than during nest maintenance, which
would result in more nest attendance in EPT than in CPT.
The pattern we predicted and found is opposite to this
(see Results). Recordings were analyzed frame by frame
using MATLAB v. 6.5 (256240 and 96632 frames in total
for EPT and CPT, respectively), coding nest attendance
(i.e. presence of bird on or inside the nest) as: (i) maleonly, (ii) female-only, (iii) joint nest attendance by male
and female, or (iv) both parents absent. When EPT parents are inside the nest, the head is still visible. CPT parents often close the entrance spout when they have
entered the nest and when they leave it again. This was
visible on our video recordings. We were thus able to
accurately score the time the parents spent on as well as

van Dijk et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:107
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/107

inside the nest. Behavioral observations carried out for a
previous study showed that EPT parents are rarely near
the nest together (for instance, one parent building at the
nest with the partner perching nearby), so this will not
have confounded our results (van Dijk, RE, Szentirmai, I,
Székely, T unpublished data). CPT parents, however, are
often together near the nest, as is shown by our results.
To distinguish male and female parents from intruders
we used individual differences in plumage [43,68], behavior (e.g. females are more often and for longer periods
inside the nest than males; intruders are often on the outside of the nest and build very little), and color bands.
Ambivalent records, i.e. when the identity of an individual was ambiguous, were excluded (7.1% and 4.8% of total
records of EPT and CPT, respectively). These excluded
frames consisted of those frames where an individual was
present plus all following frames with none of the parents
present until a frame where a new bird appeared that
could be identified. The aim of latter was to avoid a bias
towards estimated absence. As nest desertion takes place
during egg-laying in EPT, we only included pre-desertion
records.
Data analyses

We used binary logistic regression models with backward
elimination to predict parental care strategy (male or
female as response variable; care/desert) at the first
clutch of EPT in response to the size of the male eyestripes. The initial model included year as a categorical
covariate and mating date as a continuous covariate. Neither covariate contributed significantly to the model (P >
0.255), so both were removed from the final model. The
final model provided an adequate fit to both male strategy (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit; χ2 = 10.289, df =
8, P = 0.245), and female strategy (χ2 = 6.400, df = 8, P =
0.603).
All CPTs videotaped were color banded. The analyses
for nest attendance by CPTs included one male that was
recorded at two nests in consecutive years with a different female, so we included these as two data. Out of the
21 EPT nests filmed, one male and 18 females were not
color banded. Adult returning rates between years are
low (5% for males, 2% for females; [69]), therefore it is
unlikely that we observed the same unbanded individuals
in different years. Additionally, of eight unbanded females
in 2006 and the ten in 2007, three and six bred simultaneously, respectively, and we can thus be certain that these
are different individuals. For the remaining nine females
we cannot exclude the possibility of pseudoreplication,
although we suspect it is unlikely given (i) the size of our
breeding population and (ii) that the composition of pairs
was nearly always different (out of 194 pairs that produced a clutch, only six pairs remained together and produced a second clutch between 2002 and 2007).

Pseudoreplication in the plumage analyses was avoided
by randomly choosing one measurement per individual.
To examine the degree of synchrony in nest attendance
by male and female, i.e. male and female being together at
the nest simultaneously, we first calculated the time that
the male and female can be expected to spend together at
the nest by chance, by multiplying the total percentage
nest attendance by the male, i.e. male-only attendance
plus attendance by male and female together, with the
total percentage nest attendance by the female. We then
compared the difference between observed and expected
patterns of nest attendance by both species using a General Linear Model (GLM). A GLM was also used to compare the total proportion of time the parents spent at the
nest, i.e. the sum of male-only, female-only and joint nest
attendance, between the two species. Both GLMs
included year as a factor and the first day of filming as a
covariate, although neither contributed significantly to
either of the models (P > 0.138) so they were excluded
from the final models. Day lengths are different between
Hungary (15 h 46 min ± 0 h 11 min, Budapest) and South
Africa (11 h 41 min ± 0 h 12 min, Cape Town) and to test
whether this might confound our results we estimated
the absolute time the parents attended the nest per day as
the percentage of time spent at the nest × day length (day
lengths for both study sites collected from http://
www.timeanddate.com). We then compared whether the
absolute time spent at the nest by both parents is different between EPT and CPT.
We provide effect sizes [70] and power analyses, and
applied the asymptotic relative efficiency when estimating power of Mann-Whitney U-tests [71]. If the power of
the statistics was relatively low for CPT (i.e. 1-β ≤0.5), we
provide the sample size that would be required to find a
statistical significant difference between the two groups
given Cohen's effect size d of the underlying data of CPT
and power 1-β = 0.8 (Nrequired), and the required sample
size given the effect size d in EPT and power 1-β = 0.8
(Nd,1-β). All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 14.0.0 (SPSS Inc., USA), except power analyses,
which were carried out in R (R Development Core Team
2005). We provide mean ± SD, and two-tailed probabilities.
