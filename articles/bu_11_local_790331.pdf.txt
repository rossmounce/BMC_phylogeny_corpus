Local synteny and codon usage contribute to
asymmetric sequence divergence of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene duplicates
Lijing Bu, Ulfar Bergthorsson and Vaishali Katju*

Abstract
Background: Duplicated genes frequently experience asymmetric rates of sequence evolution. Relaxed selective
constraints and positive selection have both been invoked to explain the observation that one paralog within a
gene-duplicate pair exhibits an accelerated rate of sequence evolution. In the majority of studies where asymmetric
divergence has been established, there is no indication as to which gene copy, ancestral or derived, is evolving
more rapidly. In this study we investigated the effect of local synteny (gene-neighborhood conservation) and
codon usage on the sequence evolution of gene duplicates in the S. cerevisiae genome. We further distinguish the
gene duplicates into those that originated from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event (ohnologs) versus smallscale duplications (SSD) to determine if there exist any differences in their patterns of sequence evolution.
Results: For SSD pairs, the derived copy evolves faster than the ancestral copy. However, there is no relationship
between rate asymmetry and synteny conservation (ancestral-like versus derived-like) in ohnologs. mRNA
abundance and optimal codon usage as measured by the CAI is lower in the derived SSD copies relative to
ancestral paralogs. Moreover, in the case of ohnologs, the faster-evolving copy has lower CAI and lowered
expression.
Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that relaxation of selection for codon usage and gene expression
contribute to rate asymmetry in the evolution of duplicated genes and that in SSD pairs, the relaxation of selection
stems from the loss of ancestral regulatory information in the derived copy.

Background
The appearance of novel biochemical traits contributing
to phenotypic diversity is inextricably linked with the
constant input of new genetic fodder via gene and genome duplication. However, a mere duplication of an
ancestral locus far from guarantees the origin of a novel
gene product and the majority of gene duplicates end
up being silenced following a brief evolutionary existence [1,2]. For those paralogs that emerge unscathed by
deleterious mutations, the first clues as to how paralogs
are able to forge an independent evolutionary trajectory
may be provided by studying their patterns of expression divergence and relative rates of molecular
evolution.

Early studies of DNA sequence divergence between
paralogs suggested there was little or no difference
between duplicate gene-copies in their rates of evolution
[3-7]. These results were used to argue against the
hypothesis proposed by Ohno that following gene duplication, one copy is under relaxed selection and begins
to accumulate previously ‘forbidden’ mutations [2].
However, these analyses may have had limited power to
detect differences in evolutionary rates, or rate asymmetry, because they analyzed old duplicates, while an
increase in the evolutionary rate is easiest to detect in
young gene duplicates [8]. Subsequent studies have
demonstrated relatively large rate asymmetry between
duplicate genes [9-13]. For instance, 20%-30% of paralogous gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae displayed significant differences in evolutionary rate [11] and one or
both paralog(s) exhibited accelerated evolution in 17%
of the cases [12].

The phrase “gene duplication” appears to imply that
all functionally relevant features of an ancestral gene are
duplicated and therefore the two resulting gene copies
ought to be functionally equivalent. In fact, there may
be numerous differences between the two “copies”. The
derived copy often does not retain the full regulatory
element repertoire of the ancestral copy or has some
structural or genomic location differences relative to the
ancestral gene [8,14-16]. These differences suggest that
the derived copy might be expected to evolve under
divergent constraints relative to the progenitor gene,
either due to relaxation of natural selection or due to
selection for novel attributes. In the majority of studies
where asymmetric divergence has been established,
there is no indication as to which gene copy, ancestral
or derived, is evolving more rapidly. ‘Derived’ and
‘ancestral’ in the context of this study refer to the location of the paralogs in the genome rather than function.
Recently, a study of gene duplicates in the mouse genome found that relocated gene copies following duplication, and in particular retrotransposed copies, evolved
faster than paralogs in their ancestral location [16].
Similarly, a study in four mammalian genomes found
that genes that came to reside in a different location following gene duplication were more likely to display evidence of adaptive evolution relative to gene copies that
did not relocate [17].
In the case of a new gene-copy originating from a
small-scale duplication (SSD) event and relocating some
genomic distance from the ancestral copy, the identity of
the ancestral and derived copies can be established by
conservation of synteny flanking the paralogs or chromosomal location in comparison to a single-copy ortholog
in an outgroup genome [15,16]. Distinguishing the ancestral from the derived copy becomes problematic in the
case of whole-genome duplication (WGD henceforth).
For example, in the instance of a genome resulting from
allopolyploidy where duplicate gene-copies result from
hybridization rather than gene duplication, naming
ancestral and derived genes has no biological relevance.
Here we examine paralogs with low synonymous
divergence in the S. cerevisiae genome to determine if it
is the derived copy that evolves faster than the ancestral
copy following gene duplication. Most duplicates in
yeast originated from a WGD event [12,18] and for reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it is inappropriate to assign ancestral and derived status to gene
copies in the same manner as duplicates arising from
SSD events. Gene duplicates that were previously identified as resulting from the WGD event are henceforth
referred to as ‘ohnologs’ and were analysed separately
from those resulting from SSD events to test if these
two pools of duplicated genes behaved differently with
respect to their rates of molecular evolution.

Results
Greater conservation of synteny in ohnologs

We initially commenced the analysis with 43 pairs of
ohnologs and 15 SSD-derived gene duplicate pairs. These
only included gene pairs that could be unambiguously
assigned a single ortholog in an outgroup genome and
the identification of local synteny conservation. Despite
massive gene loss and genomic rearrangements in the
evolutionary period subsequent to the WGD event,
ohnologs have more extensive tracts of synteny relative
to SSD-originated gene duplicates (Table 1). For instance,
the average total upstream and downstream number of
syntenic genes in the flanking regions for ohnologs versus
SSD pairs is 19.87 and 4.67, respectively. Additionally,
Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests revealed no significant difference in the extent of syntenic tracts in the upstream
and downstream flanking regions within each population
of yeast paralogs (ohnologs and SSD pairs).
Rate of molecular evolution of ohnologs is decoupled
from synteny conservation

Nine and zero of 43 ohnolog pairs displayed significant
asymmetry based on Tajima’s Relative Rate test (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) using DNA (Additional
File 1, Table S1) and amino acid sequences (Additional
File 2, Table S2), respectively. Of these nine pairs of
ohnologs, the faster evolving copy was associated with
less synteny conservation in seven instances. This would
indicate that the rate of evolution for paralogs formed
via polyploidization might be influenced by the degree
of preserved synteny. However, a nonparametric rank
correlation test testing for association between synteny
(sum of upstream and downstream continuous synteny)
and the number of unique nucleotide sites was nonsignificant (Kendall’s tau = 0.0132; p = 0.91). Likewise,
we found no significant association between synteny
preservation and the number of unique sites at the
amino acid level (Kendall’s tau = 0.0086; p = 0.94).

Derived gene copies originating from SSD events exhibit
accelerated rates of molecular evolution

Seven of 15 SSD pairs showed significant asymmetry using a
Tajima’s Relative Rate test at the nucleotide and amino acid
level, respectively (Additional File 3, Table S3 and Additional
File 4, Table S4). Six of these seven SSD pairs exhibited rate
asymmetry both at the nucleotide and amino acid level. In
all seven instances of significant rate asymmetry between
paralogs at the nucleotide level, the derived copy exhibited
accelerated rates of molecular evolution. In six of the seven
instances of significant rate asymmetry at the amino acid
level, the derived copy was the faster-evolving paralog. A
Wilcoxon signed-ranks test of all 15 SSD pairs showed that
collectively, the derived copies tend to possess a greater
number of unique sites, suggesting accelerated molecular
evolution at the nucleotide level (T = -25.0; p = 0.024) as
well as the amino acid level (T = -21.0; p = 0.029).
CAI Results

Codon adaptation index (CAI) is a measure of optimal
codon usage and it is positively correlated with levels of
gene expression [19]. Following gene or genome duplication, there may be a period of relaxed selection

Page 3 of 9

resulting in lower CAI. If relaxation of selection does
not apply equally to both paralogs, we may observe
greater reduction in the use of optimal codons and CAI
in one of the paralogs. We tested for the degree of association between the difference in CAI values between
the two paralogs and the degree of rate asymmetry at
the nucleotide level (difference in unique sites between
the two paralogs generated from the Tajima’s Relative
Rate test) for both pools of gene duplicates in the S. cerevisiae genome. For SSD pairs, the derived paralogs
have a significantly lower CAI than the ancestral paralogs (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test: T = 39.5; p = 0.011).
However, we did not find a significant association
between nucleotide rate asymmetry and change in CAI
(Kendall’s tau = 0.226; p = 0.25) (Figure 1). That is, faster-evolving paralogs did not have lower CAI values
than slowly-evolving paralogs for SSD pairs. In contrast,
we find a strong negative correlation between rate asymmetry and a difference in CAI values among ohnologs
(Kendall’s tau = -0.453; p < 0.0001) (Figure 2). Here, the
faster-evolving paralogs resulting from the whole genome duplication event also have lower optimal codon
preference.

Figure 2 Negative relationship between nucleotide sequence asymmetry and codon adaptation index (CAI) for 43 pairs of ohnologs
in the S. cerevisiae genome. The sequence asymmetry measure on the x axis was calculated as the difference between unique nucleotide sites
at the ancestral-like copy and the derived-like copy within an ohnolog pair. The y axis represents the difference in CAI values between the
ancestral-like copy and the derived-like copy for the same ohnolog pair. There was a significant negative correlation between differences in rate
asymmetry and CIA values for ohnologs (Kendall’s tau = -0.453; p < 0.0001).

Ohnologs and SSD duplicate pairs also differ with respect
to their CAI values. The median CAI value for ohnologs
and SSD pairs are 0.70 and 0.11, respectively. Indeed, CAI
values averaged across both paralogs were determined to
be significantly greater for ohnologs relative to SSD pairs
(Wilcoxon two-sample test: Z = -4.723; p < 0.0001).
Faster-evolving paralogs have lower mRNA abundance

The preceding CAI results suggest that relaxed selective
constraints due to reduced expression of the derived
paralog may contribute significantly to rate asymmetry
between ancestral and derived paralogs. We find that
ancestral paralogs are expressed at significantly higher
levels (greater mRNA abundance) than derived paralogs
for SSD pairs (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test: T = 37.5; p <
0.017). In contrast, ancestral-like ohnologs with greater
syntenic preservation do not differ significantly in their
expression levels compared to derived-like ohnologs
with lower syntenic preservation (Wilcoxon signed-ranks
test: T = 52; p = 0.54).
We additionally tested if there is a relationship
between transcription levels of paralogs and their degree

of rate asymmetry at the nucleotide level. Figure 3
shows a significant correlation between the ratio of
paralog-specific RNA and the ratio of unique sites in
derived and ancestral copies of SSD pairs (r = 0.87, Kendall’s tau = 0.74, p < 0.0002). Likewise, we find a significant association between the ratio of paralog-specific
RNA and the ratio of unique sites in derived and ancestral copies for ohnologs (r = 0.38, Kendall’s tau = 0.225,
p = 0.0343).

Discussion
Duplicated genes frequently experience an initial
increase in their rate of evolution and nonsynonymous
substitutions relative to synonymous substitutions.
Moreover, recent analyses of young gene duplicates in
several eukaryotic genomes indicate that paralogs exhibit
asymmetric rates of sequence divergence in the evolutionary period soon after duplication [11,16,20-24].
Together, these observations indicate that initial relaxation of selection, or adaptive evolution, after duplication
is limited to one of the paralogs, and that the slowerevolving paralog is more constrained by its ancestral

function [11,22]. The majority of past studies did not
distinguish between the ancestral and derived copies
within a gene-duplicate pair, which in turn has precluded an unambiguous assessment of which copy is
under stringent versus relaxed selective constraints.
There is some evidence that derived paralogs evolve
faster than their counterparts residing at ancestral locations. In their study of evolutionarily young rodent gene
duplicates, Cusack and Wolfe [16] assigned ancestral
versus derived states to paralogs and demonstrated that
genomic relocation of one paralog by retrotransposition
engenders rate asymmetry in the sequence evolution of
paralogs, commonly manifested as an accelerated rate of
sequence evolution in the relocated paralog. Likewise, in
bacterial genomes, the majority of paralogs that appear
to have moved away from their ancestral gene neighborhood evolved faster than static paralogs [25]. Furthermore, a study of gene duplicates in four mammalian
genomes determined that signatures of positive selection
were more frequent in the derived copies than genes at
their ancestral locations [17].
In this study, we analysed the rate of evolution in
yeast paralogs for which an ancestral versus derived status could be assigned by analyzing synteny as

manifested in gene-neighborhood conservation. There
was significantly greater gene-neighborhood conservation in ohnologs relative to SSD pairs. Although ohnologs originated from an ancient polyploidization event
and rampant genome-wide deletions have since restored
functional normal ploidy in these Saccharomyces species
[26,27], it is noteworthy that this extensive gene-neighborhood conservation has persisted. There is no difference in the extent of gene-neighborhood conservation
in the upstream and downstream regions of the paralogs
for both populations of duplicates (ohnologs and SSD),
suggesting, on average, equal rates of preservation/loss
of upstream and downstream neighboring genes.
The majority of gene duplicates with low sequence
divergence in S. cerevisiae stem from an ancient WGD
event rather than segmental duplications. Subsequent to
the WGD event, there has been extensive loss of genetic
material with an estimated 10% of the original ohnologs
remaining [12]. Deletions of genetic material within a
WGD-derived homology block have the potential to
remove or rearrange regulatory sequences for the
remaining genes in the block. Therefore, the DNA
sequence of a paralog associated with more extensive
gene-neighborhood conservation (i.e. local synteny)

Bu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/279

might be under stronger purifying selection than a paralog residing in regions that have endured more gene
loss and rearrangements. While it is problematic to
assign ancestral versus derived states to gene duplicates
originating from WGD events, we reasoned that a paralog within an ohnolog pair could be characterized as
being ancestral-like or derived-like based on the extent
of gene-neighborhood conservation it shared with a single-copy ortholog in an outgroup genome. We then
sought to test the hypothesis that ancestral-like genecopies within ohnolog pairs are more likely to maintain
ancestral gene function and therefore exhibit lower rates
of sequence evolution. In contrast, gene-copies displaying a reduction in the extent of local synteny relative to
the ortholog may be predisposed to accelerated rates of
sequence evolution and the resultant fates of neofunctionalization or nonfunctionalization. However, we find
no evidence of an association between rate asymmetry
in ohnologs and local gene-neighborhood conservation.
In other words, for ohnologs, a decline in local geneneighborhood conservation (derived-like) does not
engender accelerated rates of sequence evolution either
at the nucleotide or amino acid level. This is in contrast
to a study of vertebrate genomes that found a significant
correlation between synteny preservation and sequence
conservation [28]. We speculate that the greater number
of regulatory sites in vertebrate genomes might engender greater sensitivity to syntenic changes relative to
yeast. However, ohnologs in yeast do exhibit a strong
significant relationship between rate asymmetry and
CAI such that the faster-evolving paralogs have lower
CAI. The rate asymmetry in ohnologs also seems to be
to some degree caused by relaxation of selection for
codon usage in one copy.
Among the SSD pairs in our sample, it is the derived
copy that evolves faster on average, both at the nucleotide and the amino acid level. This lends credence to
Ohno’s original hypothesis that duplication enables
redundancy, enabling one copy to explore new evolutionary space by accumulating mutations [2]. It is likely
that segmental duplications frequently do not capture
the full repertoire of regulatory sequences [8] associated
with the ancestral genes and/or result in the insertion of
the derived copy into a region of the genome with different chromatin structure and potentially under the
influence of different regulatory elements. Under these
conditions, mutations that interfere with the ancestral
gene’s original function would still be selected against,
whereas the derived copy could be under relaxed or
positive selection. For SSD pairs, the rate asymmetry at
the nucleotide level is likely due to a regime of relaxed
selective constraints as there is a significant reduction in
the CAI of the derived paralogs within SSD pairs. The
CAI compares the codon usage of a gene to codon

Page 6 of 9

usage in highly expressed genes; hence, the reduction in
the CAI values of derived paralogs suggests that selection for optimal codon usage has been relaxed in the
derived copy. Puzzlingly, we failed to detect any correlation between nucleotide sequence asymmetry of SSD
paralogs and changes in their CAI values. This may
stem from limited power given the small sample size of
available SSD duplicates in the yeast genome.
If the rate asymmetry in paralogs is largely a consequence of relaxation of selection in the derived paralog,
it should also be manifested as different levels of expression among the two copies. Previous work has shown
that the evolutionary rate in yeast is strongly influenced
by gene expression [29,30]. In both the yeast ohnologs
and SSD pairs studied here, mRNA abundance is correlated with the rate of evolution. Moreover, within SSD
pairs, it is the derived paralogs that have lowered
mRNA abundance relative to the ancestral loci. Both the
CAI and mRNA abundance suggest that selective constraints on gene expression is a significant driver of evolutionary rate asymmetry in paralogs.

Conclusions
Following gene duplication, there is a general increase in
the rate of evolution, and this increase is frequently
asymmetric in that one paralog evolves at an accelerated
pace. Asymmetry in the rate of molecular evolution
after duplication has been variously associated with the
evolution of novel functions, change in the number of
interactions, and relaxation of selection. Here we
address the related question if certain factors predispose
one paralog to evolve faster. For instance, segmental
duplications may translocate the derived copy to a different regulatory environment where it may evolve
under different or reduced constraints [8]. Despite a
limited sample of gene-duplicate pairs originating from
recent small-scale duplications in S. cerevisiae, we find
that the derived copy tends to evolve faster and is under
reduced selection for codon usage. Accelerated rates in
ohnologs are also associated with reduced selection for
codon usage. Moreover, the rate of evolution is negatively correlated with mRNA abundance for ohnologs as
well as SSD pairs. This adds to the evidence from mammals [17] that genes are not born equal and that the
duplication process predisposes the derived copy to an
evolutionary trajectory of initially reduced selective constraints and one that is perhaps more conducive to the
evolution of new functions.
Methods
Identification of Gene Duplicates in S. cerevisiae with Low
Synonymous Divergence

We initially selected gene families in the S. cerevisiae
genome identified in a preceding study [31] that

Bu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/279

comprised only two members and synonymous divergence (KS) ≤ 0.35. This set had been extracted via the
Genome History program [32] using the following parameters: (i) minimum translated ORF length of 100 aa,
(ii) minimum number of aligned residues to accept pair
being 100 aa, and (iii) using the BLAST matrix BLOSUM62 and acceptance of all BLAST hits with e ≤ 1e07. The majority of gene duplicates within this initial
sample were identified as ‘ohnologs’ [33] or duplicates
originating from a WGD event [12,34-37]. To further
increase representation of gene duplicate pairs originating from small-scale duplication (SSD) events, we raised
the KS cut-off to 1.0 for two-member families and additionally included three-member gene families with KS
cut-off equal to 0.35. Ohnologs and SSD pairs in S. cerevisiae were distinguished by consulting Byrne and
Wolfe’s reconciled ohnolog list from recent comparative
genomics studies [36]. The initial dataset after this first
set of filtering procedures comprised 47 ohnologs and
31 SSD pairs.
Determination of the extent of synteny preservation with
outgroup genomes

Synteny blocks (regions of conserved gene order) were
retrieved on the YGOB database http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/
ygob/). For ohnologs, the single-copy ortholog within the
reconstructed ancestor chromosome that is hypothesized
to exist immediately before the occurrence of the WGD
event 100-200 mya [37] was used as a reference outgroup.
For SSD-originating paralogs, the sequence of the most
recent ancestor of the paralogs was inferred based on
related genes in seven post-WGD yeast species (Saccharomyces paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus,
S. castellii, Candida glabrata, and Kluyveromyces polyspora) using the codeml program of PAML by the setting
the RateAncestor = 1 [38-40]. Tajima’s Relative Rate test
was then performed using DNA and protein sequences in
triplets containing the two focal S. cerevisiae paralogs and
their inferred ancestral sequence. In addition, duplications
involving more than one gene locus, also referred to as
‘linked sets’ [31] were treated as a single duplication.
We used two measures to quantify the extent of geneneighborhood conservation of each S. cerevisiae paralog in
its upstream and downstream flanking regions. The first
measure tallied the number of continuously shared genes
with the outgroup genome in both the upstream and
downstream directions. The second measure tallied the
total number of genes shared with the outgroup genome
within a block comprising 20 loci in both the upstream
and downstream flanking regions. After excluding duplicate pairs with neither synteny nor outgroup information,
the sample size of our study comprised 43 and 15 pairs of
ohnologs and SSD-originated duplicates, respectively
(Additional Files 1-4, Tables S1-S4).

Determining the degree of asymmetry among paralogs

Tajima’s Relative Rate test [41], as implemented in
MEGA version 4.0 [42] was used to determine if one of
the paralogs was evolving faster. For SSD pairs, the
designated outgroup sequence was a single-copy ortholog in an outgroup genome closely-related to S. cerevisiae. In the event that multiple outgroup species
possessed a single-copy ortholog corresponding to S.
cerevisae’s paralogs, we selected as outgroup the ortholog in the most closely-related outgroup genome. With
respect to three-member gene families, the Tajima’s test
was only performed for the two most closely-related
gene copies. For ohnologs, the outgroup was the phylogenetically closest species that contained a single-copy
ortholog to the S. cerevisiae duplicate pair and diverged
from the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group prior to the
WGD event.
Genome and protein sequences of 11 fully sequenced
yeast species were downloaded from the YGOB http://
wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/ygob/ and KEGG http://www.genome.jp/
kegg/catalog/org_list.html databases. Outgroup identification was performed using DNA and protein sequences
of the paralogs as queries in BLASTN and BLASTP
searches against the genomic and protein sequences of
the 11 yeast species. The BLAST outputs were filtered
and organized using a Perl script. Gene duplicate pairs
and their associated outgroup sequences were first
aligned with ClustalW 2.0 and then manually checked
and improved, when necessary, before the analysis.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test if, collectively speaking, the ancestral and derived copies of a
gene duplicate pair are evolving at the same rate. Since
the ohnolog copies could not be classified as ancestral
or derived, this tests if the rate of evolution is associated
with the conservation of flanking synteny. Five pairs of
ohnologs with equal number of unique sites were
excluded from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to yield a
final sample of 38 ohnolog pairs. For SSD pairs, the
paralog with the greater upstream synteny compared to
the outgroup is taken to be the ancestral copy. In the
event that both paralogs have equal continuous synteny,
the total synteny gene number within 20 gene loci was
further included as a measure of synteny conservation.
If the information above was insufficient for distinguishing the ancestral and the derived copies, the total synteny within 20 upstream and downstream gene loci was
utilized.
Relationship between codon usage, mRNA abundance
and rate asymmetry

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) was calculated
using the JCat tool http://www.jcat.de[19,43]. The JCat
tool uses the method of Carbone and colleagues [44] to
select a set of reference genes with optimal codon

Bu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/279

usage. In order to determine if differences in the rates of
evolution are related to changes in optimal codon usage,
we tested for correlation between the difference in number of unique sites (number of unique sites at the ancestral locus - number of unique sites at the derived locus)
and the difference in CAI between paralogs (CAI of
ancestral locus - CAI of derived locus).
An association between CAI and rate asymmetry
between paralogs would suggest that gene expression is
imposing differential constraints on the paralogs. As a
proxy for gene expression, we obtained mRNA abundance data for all the paralogs in this study from a dataset consisting of transcript counts using single-molecule
sequencing [45]. This data was used to test for an association between mRNA abundance and nucleotide rate
asymmetry for both SSD pairs (Figure 3) and ohnologs.
