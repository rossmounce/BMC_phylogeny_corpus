Abstract
Metagenomic based strategies have previously been successfully employed as powerful tools to
isolate and identify enzymes with novel biocatalytic activities from the unculturable component of
microbial communities from various terrestrial environmental niches. Both sequence based and
function based screening approaches have been employed to identify genes encoding novel
biocatalytic activities and metabolic pathways from metagenomic libraries. While much of the focus
to date has centred on terrestrial based microbial ecosystems, it is clear that the marine
environment has enormous microbial biodiversity that remains largely unstudied. Marine microbes
are both extremely abundant and diverse; the environments they occupy likewise consist of very
diverse niches. As culture-dependent methods have thus far resulted in the isolation of only a tiny
percentage of the marine microbiota the application of metagenomic strategies holds great
potential to study and exploit the enormous microbial biodiversity which is present within these
marine environments.

Introduction
It has been estimated that pelagic bacteria are extremely
abundant, achieving densities of up to 106 per ml of seawater, and account for most oceanic biomass and metabolism [1]; while numbers of bacteria which are thought to
colonize marine snow can reach levels of up to 109 per ml
[2]. Marine environments, including the subsurface are
believed to contain a total of approximately 3.67 × 1030
microorganisms [3] and with approximately 71% of the
earth's surface of 361 million square kilometers covered
by the ocean, this environment represents an enormous
pool of potential microbial biodiversity and exploitable
biotechnology or "blue biotechnology". This untapped

potential has resulted in the recent acceleration in interest
in the study of marine microorganisms, with the aim of
not only providing us with more information on the key
role they play in marine food webs and biogeochemical
cycling in marine ecosystems, but also in exploiting their
ability to produce novel enzymes and metabolites/compounds with potential biotechnological applications. As
with terrestrial environments, where more than 99% of
bacteria cannot be cultured by conventional means, the
same is true for marine environments where the vast
majority of these marine microbes have to date not yet
been identified, classified or indeed cultured. According
to Amann and colleagues as few as 0.001–0.1% of

microbes in seawater are currently cultivable [4]. In this
respect the recent advances in culture independent techniques to assess microbial diversity and ecology, such as
phylogenetic studies based on small ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) analysis and metagenomics, which were initially
developed for terrestrial based research are now increasingly being employed in marine environments and are
proving extremely useful [5,6]. A clear example of this was
the large scale metagenome sequencing project which was
recently undertaken on oligotrophic seawater samples
from the Sargasso Sea [7] and the Global Ocean Sampling
(GOS) expedition [8].
In this review, we highlight the exciting potential that
metagenomic based approaches offer us in gaining access
to protein-coding genes with biotechnological potential
from uncultivable marine microorganisms; thereby allowing us to exploit, to a much greater extent than heretofore,
the potential of this vast, and as yet untapped, marine
microbial biodiversity resource.
Metagenomics
Against the background whereby it is widely believed that
more than 99% of bacteria in any given environment cannot be cultured when conventional approaches are
employed, metagenomic based approaches have emerged
as an attractive option to allow an assessment of the
microbial genomes present within these environments
[9]. Metagenomics involves the direct cloning of environmental DNA into large clone libraries to facilitate the
analysis of the genes and the sequences within these
libraries (Figure 1) [10,11]. Metagenomics was initially

employed to study non-culturable microbiota and
focused primarily on providing a better understanding of
global microbial ecology in different environmental
niches. With the advent of efficient cloning vectors such as
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and cosmids,
together with improved DNA isolation techniques and
advanced screening methodologies using robotic instrumentation; it is now possible to express large fragments of
DNA and subsequently screen large clone libraries for
functional activities [12]. Such approaches have been particularly successful in terrestrial environments, where
genes involved in antibiotic production, antibiotic resistance and degradative enzymes have been identified
among others [10,13,14]. These approaches coupled with
additional innovative screening approaches such as Substrate-Induced Gene Expression screening (SIGEX) have
facilitated the cloning of catabolic operons potentially
involved in benzoate and catechol degradation among
others [15]. These functional based screening approaches
have also been supplemented with homology-based
screens, primarily involving polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based approaches targeting novel genes with
sequences similar to known genes. This has resulted in the
cloning of genes such as polyketide synthases [16], alkane
hydroxylases [17], cyclomaltodextrinases [18], xylanases
[19] and beta-xylanases [20]. Recently novel methods
such as pre-amplification inverse-PCR (PAI-PCR) [21]
and metagenomic DNA shuffling [22] have been
employed to isolate new biocatalysts. PAI-PCR which has
been employed to isolate glycosyl hydrolase genes from
horse and termite guts, offers the potential to clone genes
for which the copy number of target DNA sequences is
low, while the shuffling approach, which has been used to
construct novel biocatalysts, simulates and accelerates the
evolutionary process using molecular biological tools.
Homology-based screening approaches are by definition
quite limited, given that homologs of existing genes are
being targeted and this often results in no novel gene families being detected. The large scale Global Ocean Sampling Project has revealed that despite the large increase in
DNA sequence data we have yet to approach saturation
for the discovery of new protein folds, implying that there
is a large resource of truly novel proteins and enzymes in
uncultured marine microbes [8]. It is thus widely believed
that functional-based screening holds far more potential
for identifying entirely new enzymes with novel biocatalytic activities [23].
Marine microbes as good sources of novel biocatalysts
All marine ecosystems are inhabited by microbes, which
are both taxonomically diverse and metabolically complex. Marine microbes are both the primary producers of
biomass in the oceans, harvesting light and fixing carbon,
and the primary recyclers of nutrients. Microbial processes
are essential for all the major cycles necessary for the

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:27

maintenance of ocean life. Marine microbes are also
known to be involved in the global cycling of bio-elements such as nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorous,
iron, sulphur and trace elements. The precise contribution
of marine microbes to these biogeochemical cycles is
unknown. However, because of the versatility of their biochemical capabilities and the vast microbial biomass
present in marine ecosystems, they are believed to be the
main components responsible for the maintenance of
these cycles, which help sustain all living things in these
ecosystems. [24].
The marine environment is extremely diverse and marine
microbes are exposed to extremes in pressure, temperature, salinity and nutrient availability. These distinct
marine environmental niches are likely to possess highly
diverse bacterial communities, possessing potentially
unique biochemistry. Enzymes isolated from microbes
from such environments are likely to have a range of quite
diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics that
have allowed the microbial communities to adapt and
ultimately thrive in these conditions. For example bacteria
which colonize marine snow are known to produce extracellular enzymes, whose function is to degrade proteins
and polysaccharides within the snow [2]. Thus the potential exists to exploit the enzymes produced by these
marine microbes which are likely to possess unique biocatalytic activities capable of functioning under extreme
conditions.
Microbes are also known to form symbiotic relationships
with various marine invertebrates within diverse marine
ecosystems; including species of sponges, corals, squids,
sea squirts and tunicates among others. The symbioses
between the marine invertebrates and the microbes are
thought to offer each partner a number of advantages. For
example, in the case of sponges symbiotic bacteria are
believed to provide a source of nutrients for the sponge
host, process sponge metabolic waste and produce secondary metabolites which play a role in the overall
defence mechanisms of the sponge [25]. These sponges
are rich sources of biologically active and pharmacologically valuable natural products, with the potential for
therapeutic use, and the bacterial symbionts of these
sponges are widely believed to be the producers of many
of these products [26,27]. Marine sponges are also known
to contain large amounts of halogenated organic compounds such as fatty acids and alkaloids and are thus a
potential useful source of both halogenases and dehalogenases a group of biotechnologically important enzymes
which can be used in the production of pharmaceuticals,
herbicides and pesticides [28-31].
The potential for the discovery of novel enzymes from
marine microbes is illustrated by the fact that quite a

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/27

diverse range of enzymatic activities have to date been
identified from cultured marine microbes (Table 1), with
the need for novel biocatalysts giving rise to many new
enzymes being isolated from the marine environment.
These include bacteria isolated from Antarctic seawater
and marine sediments among others. Novel enzymes
which have recently been identified from marine environments include a non-specific nuclease isolated from a bacteriophage which predates on the marine thermophile
Geobacillus sp. 6K51. This enzyme has been shown to have
no known homology to any previously isolated enzymes
and a temperature optimum of 60°C [32]. At the other
end of the temperature scale are the cold-adapted
enzymes such as the lipase isolated from the γ-proteobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. This lipase
is the first member of a new family of lipases, which share
homology to the α/β hydrolases superfamily [33]. Other
recently reported enzymes include phospolipases [34],
extracelluar amylotic enzymes [35], agarases [36] and
endochitinases [37].
Even environments such as the deep sea floor, where to
date only limited numbers of cultivable bacteria have
been isolated, mainly obligate sulphate reducing anaerobes and methanogens together with facultative anaerobic heterotrophs such as Halomonas and Psychrobacter,
now appear to be reservoirs for microbes with enzymatic
activities with potential biotechnological applications.
For example a number of cultivable aerobic microbes
have recently been isolated from the deep subseafloor sediments from off-shore the Shimokita peninsula in Japan at
a water depth of 1,180 m. These microbes produced a variety of different enzymatic activities including protease,
amylase, lipase, chitinase, deoxyribonuclease and phosphatase activities [38].
However, these novel enzymes have all been isolated
from the cultivable fraction of microbes from the diverse
range of marine environments which were studied. As we
know this cultivable fraction represents only a small proportion of the total bacteria present in these environments. Hence, if the entire potential of these
environments is to be explored and ultimately exploited
with respect to the presence of novel biocatalysts; then
there is a clear need to employ metagenomic or other culture-independent approaches together with robust heterologous expression systems to facilitate such an approach.
Heterologous expression systems for functional expression
of metagenomic libraries from marine environments
The heterologous expression of novel genes or indeed
gene clusters within suitable hosts will be required if new
biocatalysts are to be identified from unculturable marine
sources. However, significant challenges remain in using
functional metagenomic based approaches to identify

these enzymes; particularly when extreme environments,
such as those present in many marine ecosystems, are
being targeted. One of the main problems is that of low
biomass yields, which coupled with low cell numbers
from these marine environments, can lead to difficulties
in obtaining high yields of DNA for subsequent cloning.
Thus new methods are required to allow metagenomic
library construction from environments with only low
bacterial cell-densities. One potential method of overcoming this problem is the use of multiple displacement
amplification, which has been successfully employed to
assess the microbial diversity of scleractinian coral where
environmental considerations require minimal sample
sizes [39]. In addition, for functional screening to be successful it requires gene expression and proper folding of
the resulting protein in a suitable heterologous host.
While it has been predicted that E. coli expression systems
can be employed to successfully express up to 40% of
genes from 32 complete genome sequences of various
prokaryotic organisms, this is not always easily achievable
[40]. For example insolubility of the target protein
remains a major limitation in E. coli expression systems,
while in some structural genomics projects, up to half of
the targets tested failed to fold properly and accumulated

as insoluble protein or inclusion bodies [41]. With this in
mind a number of alternative bacterial host and expression systems are currently being examined. These include
Streptomyces lividans, Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium
leguminosarum [42,43], which should facilitate the construction of metagenomic libraries with different expression capabilities thereby overcoming some of the
difficulties being encountered with the E. coli system. In
addition the possibility exists that functional expression
of metagenomic DNA from psychrophilic marine microorganisms in heterologous hosts such as E. coli may be
sub-optimal when the host is cultured at a higher temperature. The expression of proteins from these psychrophilic
microorganisms at higher temperatures may lead to the
mis-folding of these proteins and the subsequent formation of inclusion bodies, resulting in loss of function.
While this may not always be the case [44], in general psychrophilic microorganisms produce enzymes which have
become cold-adapted, but which tend to have a low thermal stability. These problems may potentially be overcome through the use of chaperone-based E. coli strains
bearing the chaperonin 60 gene (cpn60) and the cochaperonin 10 gene (cpn10) from the psychrophilic bacterium
Oleispira antartica RB8T [45]. The use of these strains for

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:27

metagenomic library construction could facilitate the
functional screening of these libraries at temperatures
down to 10°C, where increased levels of expression may
in fact be observed [46].
Successes in the marine environment
Researchers have also begun to employ metagenomic
based approaches in an effort to isolate novel compounds
from marine environments. Much of the emphasis to date
has focused on the identification of gene clusters encoding novel biosynthesis pathways for compounds with
potential bio-pharmaceutical applications, from bacterial
populations associated with marine invertebrates [25].
The metagenomic approaches being employed are similar
to those that have previously been successfully employed
in soil, which have resulted in the identification of among
others; a biosynthesis gene cluster for the antibiotic violacein [47]; novel N-acyltyrosine antibiotics [48]; the novel
antibiotic turbomycins [49]; antibiotic compounds
related to indirubin [50]; and a family of novel natural
products, the terragenines [51]. Successes in the marine
environment include identification of the biosynthetic
machinery for the cytotoxic peptide patellamide from the
cyanobacterial symbiont, Prochloron, of a marine didemnid ascidian. Two groups independently identified the
biosynthesis genes for patellamide using a DNA sequencing approach and through a functional metagenomics
approach. Patellamide biosynthesis was found to proceed
though modification of a ribosomally encoded peptide
and not via a non-ribosomal peptide synthetases as had
been previously assumed [52,53].

With respect to biocatalysts, a number of novel hydrolytic
enzymes have recently been cloned from Antarctic sea
water bacterial metagenomic DNA [54], while a novel
low-temperature-active lipase has also recently been isolated from a metagenomic library of Baltic Sea marine sediment bacteria. This low-temperature-active lipase gene
which displayed 54% amino acid similarity to a Pseudomonas putida esterase was successfully heterologously
expressed in E. coli and subsequently biochemically characterised [55]. This highlights the value of employing
metagenomics in marine environments to, in this case,
identify novel lipases. Lipases have important applications not only in the detergent industry but also in paper
processing, as food additives [56] and in biofuel production through catalysing the conversion of vegetable oil to
methylalcohol ester [57]. They also have applications in
synthetic organic chemistry, due primarily to their enantio-/stereoselectivity coupled with their ability to retain
activity in organic solvents. Thus similar metagenomics
approaches in other marine environments may prove
fruitful in identifying other novel lipase genes, with biotechnological applications in these areas.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/27

Another example where metagenomics has been successfully employed to identify novel enzymes from a marine
environment is the recent report of the cloning of two
alkane hydroxylase genes from a metagenomic library
from deep-sea sediment in the Pacific. While this is the
first report of the genetic characterisation of an alkane
hydroxylase from a deep-sea environment, it is also interesting to note that these two alkane hydroxylase genes
were functionally expressed in a Pseudomonas fluorescens
strain [17]. Identification of these novel proteins may
help to increase the range of alkane hydroxylase biocatalytic applications, and again highlights the utility of
metagenomics in identifying potential novel biocatalysts.
Challenges and future directions
There are several key areas which need to be addressed in
order for this exciting area to realise its full potential. The
high microbial diversity of these marine environments
means that large numbers of clones need to be screened in
order to access the full biodiversity of the microbial community and to obtain significant numbers of "hits" which
can then be taken forward for further analysis. This
requirement means that high throughput screens need to
be established to identify positive clones in metagenomic
libraries. The development of cell-based ultra-high
throughput screens would enable more rapid screening of
large metagenomic libraries. Flow cytometry based
approaches such as the SIGEX approach are leading the
way in this area, since millions of clones can be screened
in a short time and sorted for further analysis.

While standard metagenomic approaches allow access to
the full biodiversity of microbial populations, the nature
of the metagenomic approach means that to access low
abundance (< 1%) microbes, extremely large libraries are
required. These large libraries contain significant redundancy with respect to the high abundance microbes
present within the population. A combination of cell sorting technology (FACS and microfluidics) and whole
genome amplification approaches has the potential to significantly improve the ability to access the genetic
resources of low-abundance microbes within any given
population [58-60]. These new approaches to access low
abundance microbial diversity could be used to make targeted 'metagenomic' libraries of low abundance microbes
and increase our ability to access this diversity.
The functional metagenomic approach, typically used for
biocatalyst screening, requires that the desired activity be
expressed in a surrogate host, typically Escherichia coli.
While E. coli has proven to be a flexible and useful host for
heterologous expression there are a significant proportion
of proteins that cannot be expression functionally in this
host. In addition, many functional assays rely on the

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:27

expression of entire metabolic pathways, requiring that
promoters be recognised in the heterologous host for the
co-ordinated expression of entire sets of genes. The range
of surrogate hosts for heterologous expression and their
associated vectors needs to be greatly expanded if we are
to succeed in expressing DNA from the many diverse
phyla that exist in the marine ecosystem, including the
abundant Archaea and microeukarya. Novel complementation assays need to be developed whereby the metagenomic DNA complements a mutation in a surrogate host.
Such methods would be very high throughput since they
would allow the positive selection of desired clones. The
ability to screen extremely large libraries also makes the
use of easier to construct small insert libraries more practical.

alysts which are required to improve current and develop
new, cleaner, industrial production processes, to reduce
energy and raw material consumption, and for the generation of renewable biofuels; marine metagenomics coupled with biotechnology has the potential to contribute to
all these pressing needs.

While metagenomic approaches offer a means to access
the total potential of the microbial gene pool, other
approaches need to be considered which may offer new
avenues of investigation. One such approach may be to
explore the metaproteome of the marine microbes (Fig 1).
In metaproteomics the proteins present in an environmental sample are analysed using high throughput methods such as tandem mass spectroscopy [61], comparison
of this data to metagenomic DNA sequence data allows
one to infer which genes are actively expressed in any population. Using appropriately designed probes this
approach would allow the selection of such active genes
for the screening and analysis of metagenomic libraries.
Using such an approach in tandem perhaps with the more
established metagenomic based approaches would greatly
enhance the probability of obtaining novel biocatalysts.

Conclusion
This review is intended to focus the reader's attention on
the potential of exploiting metagenomics, specifically the
use of metagenomic libraries constructed from unique
marine environments as an approach to successfully
exploit the largely "untapped" resources within various
marine environments. The marine environment is
extremely diverse with microbes flourishing in cold polar
and warm equatorial waters, in sunlit surface waters, in
high-pressure deep sea sediments, in hot acidic water near
hydrothermal vents and in association with various vertebrate and invertebrate animals. These diverse ecosystems
are potentially very useful sources for novel enzymes with
unique properties and great biotechnological potential.
Only a small proportion of the bioresources of marine
microbiota have thus far been examined and an even
smaller proportion has been exploited. Given our present
inability to culture the vast majority of microbes from
these environments the metagenomic approaches outlined in this review offer the only methodology currently
available to access these unique and useful bioresources.
There is an ongoing need for a wide range of novel biocat-
