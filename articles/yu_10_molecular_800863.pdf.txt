Abstract
Background: Phosphomannomutase (PMM) is an essential enzyme in eukaryotes. However, little is known about
PMM gene and function in crop plants. Here, we report molecular evolutionary and biochemical analysis of PMM
genes in bread wheat and related Triticeae species.
Results: Two sets of homoeologous PMM genes (TaPMM-1 and 2) were found in bread wheat, and two
corresponding PMM genes were identified in the diploid progenitors of bread wheat and many other diploid
Triticeae species. The duplication event yielding PMM-1 and 2 occurred before the radiation of diploid Triticeae
genomes. The PMM gene family in wheat and relatives may evolve largely under purifying selection. Among the
six TaPMM genes, the transcript levels of PMM-1 members were comparatively high and their recombinant proteins
were all enzymatically active. However, PMM-2 homoeologs exhibited lower transcript levels, two of which were
also inactive. TaPMM-A1, B1 and D1 were probably the main active isozymes in bread wheat tissues. The three
isozymes differed from their counterparts in barley and Brachypodium distachyon in being more tolerant to
elevated test temperatures.
Conclusion: Our work identified the genes encoding PMM isozymes in bread wheat and relatives, uncovered a
unique PMM duplication event in diverse Triticeae species, and revealed the main active PMM isozymes in bread
wheat tissues. The knowledge obtained here improves the understanding of PMM evolution in eukaryotic
organisms, and may facilitate further investigations of PMM function in the temperature adaptability of bread
wheat.

Background
Phosphomannomutase (PMM, EC 5.4.2.8), catalyzing the
interconversion between mannose-6-phosphate and
mannose-1-phosphate, is an essential and conserved
enzyme in eukaryotic organisms [1,2]. Mannose-1-phosphate is necessary for synthesizing the vital cellular
metabolite GDP-mannose, which plays a crucial role in
the formation of polysaccharide chains required for the

glycosylation of protein and lipid molecules [3,4]. In
higher plants, GDP-mannose also acts as an important
precursor for the biosynthesis of the key antioxidant
ascorbic acid (AsA) [5,6], and the mannose containing
polysaccharides are essential for the development of
functional cell walls [2,4]. From available information,
the copy number of functional PMM in diploid eukaryotic species varies from one (i.e., in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana) to two (e.g., in human).
PMM proteins from different eukaryotic species are
highly similar in primary structure, with more than 50%
amino acid sequence identities found among the PMMs

from S. cerevisiae, Arabidopsis and human [6]. The crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of mammalian
PMMs are well understood [7], and there is also a
wealth of information on human PMM2, whose point
mutations lead to a genetically inherited disease CDG-Ia
[8-11].
Two recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis
show that defect in PMM function reduces AsA biosynthesis and protein glycosylation, causing enhanced
susceptibility to oxidation stress and plant death at high
growth temperature (28°C) [6,12]. The requirement of a
functional PMM protein for Arabidopsis to grow at
28°C is consistent with the pioneering finding of temperature sensitive PMM mutations that arrest S. cerevisiae growth at 37°C [1], suggesting that PMM may be
generally important for the temperature adaptability of
eukaryotes.
Compared to the above progress, little is known about
PMM gene and function in crop plants, although broad
temperature adaptability is vitally important for crops to
achieve high yield potential under diverse environmental
conditions. To improve our understanding on PMM in
crop plants, we have embarked on a systematic molecular
and biochemical analysis of PMM genes in bread wheat
(T. aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), a polyploid crop
species cultivated in both temperate and tropical regions
and with harvest possible under a wide range of temperature conditions [13,14]. Bread wheat belongs to the tribe
Triticeae, which is composed of approximately 350 species, and contains both diploid (such as barley and rye)
and polyploid (e.g., bread wheat) crop plants [15]. The
diploid genomes in Triticeae species are homoeologous,
and may be combined to form polyploids through natural
and artificial hybridizations [16]. Bread wheat was
evolved through natural hybridization between tetraploid
wheat (T. turgidum, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) and Aegilops
tauschii (2n = 2x = 14, DD) about 8000 years ago
[16-18]. T. turgidum was formed about 0.5 million years
ago (MYA) through spontaneous hybridization between
an unidentified Triticeae species containing the B genome and the wild einkorn wheat T. urartu (2n = 2x = 14,
AA) [19-22]. The A, B and D genomes diverged from
each other around 2.5 to 4.5 MYA, whereas the divergence of wheat and barley occurred around 11 MYA
[19-22]. Although bread wheat and related Triticeae species generally contain large and complex genomes, the
advent of structural and functional genomics research in
model cereals (rice, Brachypodium distachyon) has made
it possible to conduct relatively detailed molecular
genetic and biochemical studies of important genes both
within Triticeae and among rice, Brachypodium and Triticeae species. The genomic resources of rice and B. distachyon (e.g., molecular markers, annotated genomic
information) have both been proved to be very useful in

the investigations of important Triticeae genes, such as
Ph1 and Lr34/Yr18 in common wheat and Ppd-H1 and
Cly1 in barley [23-26].
From the information presented above, the main
objectives of this work were to 1) determine PMM
genes and loci in bread wheat and related Triticeae species, and 2) investigate the evolution of Triticeae PMM
genes and the main active PMM isozymes in bread
wheat tissues, with the aid of the genomic knowledge of
rice and B. distachyon.

Results
Isolation and characterization of PMM genes

Two approaches (bioinformatic analysis, molecular cloning) were used to identify and isolate the PMM genes in
B. distachyon, bread wheat and related Triticeae species
(barley, T. urartu, T. turgidum, Ae. tauschii). In total, 17
distinct PMM coding sequences were isolated (Table 1).

A single PMM gene was found for both rice (OsPMM)
and B. distachyon (BdPMM). The cDNA of OsPMM
was reported previously [6], whereas that of BdPMM
was isolated in this work using RT-PCR (Table 1).
Six different PMM genes were isolated from each of
the two bread wheat varieties, Xiaoyan 54 and Chinese
Spring (CS). T. urartu, Ae. tauschii and barley were
each found to contain two distinct PMM genes, while
four different PMM genes were cloned from T. turgidum. Based on the data on exon and intron pattern,
nucleotide and deduced protein identities, chromosomal
location, and phylogenetic clustering analysis of genomic
coding sequences (see below), the A, B and D genomes
were each found to contribute two members to the six
PMM genes in bread wheat, which were thus named as
TaPMM-A1, B1, D1, A2, B2 and D2, respectively (Table
1). The PMM-1 genes in bread wheat and its diploid
and tetraploid progenitor species and barley were homoeologous. Likewisely, homoeologous relationship existed
among the PMM-2 genes from these species.
The intron and exon patterns of the PMM genes from
rice, B. distachyon, and wheat and relatives were highly
similar. Except for OsPMM and BdPMM, both of which
had 11 exons owing to the split of the first exon into
two parts, the remaining genes all had 10 exons and 9
introns (Figure 1). Apart from PMM-A2 homoeologs
and HvPMM-2, the remaining Triticeae PMM genes
cloned in this work all contained intact ORF. The coding region of HvPMM-2 was disrupted by premature
stop codon based on analyzing the PCR products amplified from two barley varieties (Betzes, Zaoshou 3)
(Table 1, Additional file 1).
Consistent with our earlier study [6], the proteins
deduced from the PMM genes of common wheat and
progenitor species, barley and B. distachyon were more

(BdPMM), rice (OsPMM), and Arabidopsis (AtPMM). The exon/
intron structures of the compared PMM genes are highly similar
except that the first exon in BdPMM and OsPMM (underlined with
dashed line) is split into two parts. The positions to which the
intron flanking primers (IFf, IFr) bind are indicated by arrows. The

than 50% identical to the PMMs of human and S. cerevisiae (Additional file 2). The identities among the grass
PMMs were generally above 90%, with BdPMM showing higher identity to its homologs from bread wheat
and related Triticeae species than to OsPMM. The
identities among the deduced PMM-1 proteins of bread
wheat and its diploid and tetraploid ancestors were generally 98% or higher, with complete identity found
among the deduced TaPMM-A1, TuPMM-A1, TtPMMA1 and TaPMM-B1 proteins. The identities among the
deduced PMM-B2 and D2 proteins of bread wheat and
its diploid and tetraploid ancestors were generally 97%.
By contrast, the identities between the deduced PMM-1
and 2 proteins were comparatively lower, being 95%
between B1 and B2 proteins, and 96% between D1 and
D2 proteins. The deduced PMM-B1 (or B2) proteins of
tetraploid and bread wheats were 99% identical. Interestingly, TaPMM-B2 and TtPMM-B2 displayed unusual
amino acid substitutions. The first one, involving the
substitution of a broadly conserved glycine residue by
alanine, was shared between TaPMM-B2 and TtPMMB2 (Additional file 3). The second one was unique to
TaPMM-B2, involving the replacement of a highly conserved arginine residue by cysteine. The four structural
and active site motifs (motifs I to IV), identified by analyzing the crystal structure of HsPMM-1 [7], were generally conserved among the compared plant PMMs
(Additional file 3).
Determination of PMM copy number and chromosomal
locations

To investigate the copy number of PMM genes, we
made use of intron length polymorphisms and designed
a pair of intron flanking (IF) primers (Additional file 4),
which enabled the amplification of PCR fragments containing introns III to V (Figure 1). By carefully analyzing
the products amplified with fluorescently labeled IF primers, six distinct fragments were found for bread wheat
(varieties Xiaoyan 54 and CS), and their size equaled to
that calculated from the six cloned TaPMM genomic
sequences in all cases (Additional file 5). Using the same
strategy, two PMM fragments were found for T. urartu
(accessions DV877 and IE29-1), Ae. tauschii (accessions
AS67 and AS91) and barley (Betzes), respectively, and
for all three species, the size of the amplified fragments
corresponded exactly to the one deduced from the
cloned PMM members (Additional file 5). Four fragments were amplified from T. turgidum (Langdon,
LDN), whose size again showed specific correspondence
to that derived from each of the four cloned TtPMM
members (Additional file 5). Finally, a single fragment
was amplified from B. distachyon (Bd21) and its size
agreed with the one calculated from the cloned BdPMM
genomic sequence (Additional file 5).

The copy number of PMM genes in an additional set
of materials (containing 12 diploid and 9 tetraploid Triticeae species) was also investigated by fragment analysis
using the IF primers (see above). The results showed
that the diploid Triticeae species carrying the Am Am ,
CC, MM, NN, RR, SS, SbSb, SlSl, SsSs, SshSsh, StSt or UU
genomes generally had two different PMM fragments,
whereas the tetraploid Triticeae species containing the
AAGG, DDCC, DDMM, DDNN or UUMM genomes
generally possessed four PMM specific fragments (Additional file 6).
The fluorescently labeled IF primers were further
employed for investigating the chromosomal locations
of wheat and barley PMM members by PCR amplifications. The fragments derived from PMM-A1, B1 and D1
of bread wheat were not amplified from the NT lines
lacking 2A, 2B and 2D chromosomes, respectively
(Additional file 7), indicating that TaPMM-1 homoeologs were located on group 2 chromosomes. This finding was confirmed by the fragment analysis data
obtained with LDN substitution lines (Additional file 7).
The fragments derived from PMM-A2 and D2 members
of bread wheat were not amplified from the NT lines
lacking 4A and 4D chromosomes, respectively (Additional file 7). Moreover, the fragment from TtPMM-B2
was absent in the LDN substitution line lacking the 4B
chromosome (Additional file 7). Together, these results
indicated that TaPMM-2 homoeologs were located on
group 4 chromosomes. Using a similar strategy, the two
barley PMM genes were mapped to the 2H and 4H
chromosomes, respectively (Additional file 8), which are
homoeologous to wheat groups 2 and 4 chromosomes,
respectively [27,28].
The finding of six PMM genes located on groups 2
and 4 chromosomes in bread wheat by this work is consistent with the data generated in the wheat expressed
sequence tag (EST) mapping project http://wheat.pw.
usda.gov/NSF/progress_ mapping.html. The EST
BE489906, a 421 bp cDNA exhibiting higher than 95%
nucleotide sequence identity to the 5’ half of the
mRNAs of the six bread wheat PMM genes, has been
used as a probe to hybridize with the genomic DNA
samples of CS and associated NT lines digested with the
restriction enzyme EcoRI. The hybridization yields 11
positive bands, which are mapped to groups 2 or 4
chromosomes. Our bioinformatic analysis suggests the
presence of three to five EcoRI sites in the genomic
ORF of bread wheat PMM genes, with the last EcoRI
site located in the 8th exon (Additional file 9). Because
the first seven exons give rise to the 5’ half of PMM
mRNAs upon post transcriptional processing, the DNA
blot hybridization with BE489906 probe is expected to
show about 11 to 12 hybridizing bands from six
TaPMM gene members. The hybridization with another

Page 4 of 16

PMM EST probe (BE591860) yields approximately seven
positive bands, which are mapped mainly to groups 2 or
4 chromosomes. Consequently, it is suggested that the
number of homoeologous PMM genes in bread wheat is
likely to be around six. However, we can not exclude
the existence of additional and divergent PMM copies
or fragments in bread wheat genome, because they may
not be amplified by our PCR strategy (owing to mutations in the primer binding sites), or be distinguishable
from one or more of the six completely sequenced
copies during fragment analysis (because of the lack of
difference in intron length).
Duplication of PMM in diploid Triticeae species

The foregoing experiments indicated that there existed
two PMM genes (PMM-1, PMM-2) in diploid Triticeae
species, and a single PMM gene in either B. distachyon
or rice. These findings raised an important question on
how and when the two PMM gene members in diploid
Triticeae species were evolved. To investigate this question, phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the
genomic DNA sequences of PMM genes. Two distinct
clades, one composed of Triticeae PMM-2 homoeologs
and the other of the PMM-1 homoeologs from common
wheat and progenitors, were consistently found in the
phylogenetic trees constructed using different tree building methods (Figure 2). HvPMM-1, BdPMM and
OsPMM fell outside of the two clades, with HvPMM-1
showing a closer association with both clades than
BdPMM and OsPMM (Figure 2). These observations,
plus the established synteny between barley chromosome 2 (harboring HvPMM-1) and rice chromosome 4
(on which OsPMM resides) [27-29], indicated that the
Triticeae PMM-1 genes were most likely the orthologs
of BdPMM and OsPMM, and that the Triticeae PMM-2
member may be derived from PMM-1 through duplication. Trees with topology highly similar to that displayed
in Figure 2 were also obtained when the deduced amino
acid sequences of the PMM genes were used for phylogenetic analysis, but they could not reveal the phylogenetic relationships of PMM-A2 homoeologs to other
PMM genes because TaPMM-A2, TtPMM-A2 and
TuPMM-A2 could not yield intact proteins upon conceptual translation (Table 1).
To find the approximate timing at which the duplication of Triticeae PMM occurred, we first calculated
the number of substitutions per synonymous site for
the grass PMM genes characterized in this work. The
values of synonymous substitutions calculated with
PMM-1 genes were generally lower compared to those
obtained with PMM-2 members (Table 2). This
prompted us to calculate the molecular clocks for
grass PMM-1 and 2 genes, respectively. Based on the
averaged synonymous substitutions between OsPMM

on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of PMM genes by

options). Highly similar results were obtained by alternative tree

and wheat PMM-1 or 2 genes (Table 2), and assuming
that rice and wheat diverged about 60 MYA [22], the
average nucleotide substitution rate for PMM-1 genes
was estimated to be 3.7 × 10 -9 per site per year,
whereas that for PMM-2 genes was 4.2 × 10-9 per site
per year. BdPMM and wheat PMM-1 genes diverged
about 40.2 ± 6.6 MYA (Table 3). The divergence time
between wheat PMM-1 and 2 genes was estimated to
be 18.9 ± 4.0 or 16.6 ± 3.6 MYA, depending on
whether the clock rates of PMM-1 or 2 genes were
used for the calculation (Table 3).

calculated for analyzing evolution rate and potential
positive selection on amino acid sites by appropriate
models (Table 4). The analysis with one-ratio model
(M0) produced an averaged ω value of 0.15, indicating
that purifying selection dominated the evolution of the
examined PMM gene members (Table 4). The analysis
with two-ratio model revealed that the mean ω value of
PMM-2 genes was larger than that of PMM-1 members,
though this difference was not statistically significant by
the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) comparing one-ratio with
two-ratio models (Table 4). The analysis with six site
specific models, M1a, M2a, M3 (k = 2), M3 (k = 3), M7
and M8, suggested that more than 90% of codon sites
were under strong purifying selection (with p ranging
from 0.91 to 0.99, Table 4). Two candidate sites (10 and
96) were found to be under positive selection based on
naïve empirical Bayes (NEB) posterior probability, one
of which (site 10) was significant (Table 4, Additional
file 10). However, the positive selection on site 10 was
not significant according to Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB)
posterior probability, and neither was it supported by
LRT (Table 4).
Transcriptional patterns of six TaPMM genes

Semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments, using member
specific primers, were conducted to compare the transcriptional patterns of six PMM genes in Xiaoyan 54.
In general, the transcripts of the six PMM members
were detectable in both vegetative (root, culm, leaf)
and reproductive (immature spikes) organs, with relatively higher transcript levels detected in the seedling
and flag leaves (Figure 3). The transcript levels of
TaPMM-1 members (A1, B1, D1) were generally and
relatively higher than those of TaPMM-2 members
(A2, B2, D2) (Figure 3). The transcriptional profiles of
the three TaPMM-1 genes were basically similar,
except that the transcript level of D1 in the immature
spikes was much lower relative to those of A1 or B1
(Figure 3). Among the three TaPMM-2 members, B2
and D2 showed a highly similar transcriptional profile
(Figure 3). The transcript levels of A2 in the roots,
culms and immature spikes were substantially lower
than those of B2 and D2 in the same set of organs
(Figure 3).
Biochemical activity of TaPMM proteins

Analysis of evolutionary rate and potential positive
selection

The cDNA sequence of 11 PMM genes (including seven
PMM-1 and four PMM-2 members from bread wheat
and its progenitor species) were aligned (Additional file
10), and the resultant alignment was used to construct a
NJ tree (Additional file 10). The non-synonymous/
synonymous substitution rate ratios (ω = dN/dS) were

First, yeast complementation assays were carried out to
test if the proteins expressed from TaPMM-A1, B1,
D1, B2 or D2 may complement the temperature sensitivity of the sec53-6 mutant of S. cerevisiae. TaPMMA2 was not included because it did not possess an
intact ORF (Table 1). From Figure 4, it is clear that
the expression of TaPMM-A1, B1, D1 or D2 restored
the growth of sec53-6 cells at 30 or 37°C, and to a

similar degree. By contrast, the expression of TaPMMB2 complemented PMM deficiency of sec53-6 only
weakly at 30°C, with no complementation observed at
37°C (Figure 4).
Subsequently, TaPMM-A1, B1, B2, D1 and D2 were
individually expressed in the bacterial cells, and the
resultant recombinant proteins were purified using
nickel affinity chromatography (Additional file 11). The
recombinant proteins of A1, B2, D1 and D2 were examined for catalytic activity using mannose-1-phosphate as
the substrate. The B1 recombinant protein was not
included in this analysis because its deduced amino acid
sequence was identical to that of A1 (Additional file 2).
In three independent experiments, B2 did not show
detectable catalytic activity. By contrast, the recombinant A1, D1 and D2 proteins were all catalytically
active. The average K m (mM, mannose-1-phosphate)
values calculated for recombinant A1, D1 and D2 proteins were 0.46 ± 0.02, 0.40 ± 0.02 and 0.48 ± 0.02,
respectively.

Temperature-activity profiles of the recombinant PMMs of
rice, B. distachyon, barley and bread wheat

OsPMM, BdPMM and HvPMM-1 were expressed in the
bacterial cells, and the resultant recombinant proteins
were purified as described above. The main temperature-activity characteristics of the three PMMs and
TaPMM-A1, D1 and D2 were compared using 1 mM
mannose-1-phosphate as the substrate and at three test
temperatures (24, 30 and 37°C). From Figure 5, it is evident that the activity level of OsPMM was significantly
higher at 30 and 37°C than at 24°C. Moreover, increasing the test temperature from 30 and 37°C did not
decrease OsPMM activity significantly (Figure 5).
BdPMM was most active at 30°C, but its activity level
was reduced by nearly 95% as the temperature increased
from 30 to 37°C (Figure 5). HvPMM-1 was most active
at 24°C, and its activity level also decreased sharply
(by more than 90%) as the temperature shifted from 30
to 37°C (Figure 5). The three bread wheat PMMs exhibited different temperature-activity characteristics.

TaPMM-A1 was less active than BdPMM and HvPMM1 at 24 and 30°C, but its activity level was substantially
higher than those of BdPMM and HvPMM-1 at 37°C,
owing to a 51% increase of its activity as the temperature changed from 30 to 37°C (Figure 5). TaPMM-D2,
although less active than BdPMM and HvPMM-1 at 24
and 30°C, displayed substantially higher activity levels
than BdPMM and HvPMM-1 at 37°C, because the
change of test temperature from 30 to 37°C did not
reduce TaPMM-D2 activity as strongly as that occurred
to BdPMM and HvPMM-1 (Figure 5). The activity level
of TaPMM-D1 was lower than those of BdPMM and
HvPMM-1 but higher than those of TaPMM-A1 and
D2 at 24°C (Figure 5). However, TaPMM-D1 was highly
active at 30°C, with an activity level statistically comparable to that of OsPMM (Figure 5). The shift of assay
temperature from 30 to 37°C reduced the activity of
TaPMM-D1 by about 40%, but the scale of this reduction was much lower compared to that observed for
BdPMM, HvPMM-1 or TaPMM-D2.

Discussion
PMM genes and chromosomal loci in Triticeae species

Through the molecular cloning experiments in this
work, the following suggestions may be made regarding
PMM genes and chromosome loci in Triticeae species.
First, there exist two distinct PMM gene members
(PMM-1 and 2) in the progenitor diploid genomes (i.e.,
A, B and D) of bread wheat. There are four and six
PMM genes (including both active and inactive

members) in tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, respectively. Second, in bread wheat and its diploid and tetraploid progenitors, the loci containing PMM-1 or 2 genes
are located on homoeologous groups 2 and 4 chromosomes, respectively. Third, two PMM genes (HvPMM-1
and 2) exist in diploid barley. The loci harboring
HvPMM-1 or 2 are located on the 2H and 4H chromosomes, respectively. Finally, judging from the fragment
analysis data of PMM genes described in Additional file
6, it is probable that the basic organization of PMM
gene family, as defined for the A, B, D and H genomes
(e.g., two distinct members contained in two separate
chromosomal loci), is conserved in the diploid Triticeae
species possessing AmAm, CC, MM, NN, RR, SS, SbSb,
SlSl, SsSs, SshSsh, StSt or UU genomes. However, further
work is needed to verify if in the 12 Triticeae genomes
the two PMM genes may also be located on homoeologous group 2 and 4 chromosomes.
The existence of two PMM genes in diploid Triticeae
species contrasts with the finding of a single PMM gene
for Arabidopsis, rice and B. distachyon [[6,12], this
work]. A search of recently accumulated genomic data
deposited in the phytozome website (http://www.phytozome.net) reveals that Medicago truncatula, Vitis vinifera, Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays each possess a
single PMM gene. However, both Glycine max and
Populus trichocarpa harbor two PMM copies in their
genomes (http://www.phytozome.net). Two functional
PMM copies have also been found present in several
mammals (e.g., human, mouse and rat) [30-32].

RT-PCR analysis with gene specific primers. The amplification of
tubulin transcripts served as an internal control (for normalizing the
cDNA levels of different reverse transcription samples and for
checking the kinetics of PCR amplification). The numbers of
amplification cycles for TaPMM and tubulin genes are shown on the

three independent experiments.

yeast constructs, harboring the cDNA of TaPMM-A1 (p181-A1), B1
(p181-B1), D1 (p181-D1), B2 (p181-B2) or D2 (p181-D2), were
prepared using the expression vector p181AINE (containing a Leu2
selection marker). These constructs, together with the empty vector
control (p181-VC), were transformed into the sec53-6 strain of S.
cerevisiae, which does not grow at elevated temperatures (30°C or
above) because of temperature sensitive mutation in the native
PMM. The six recombinant strains, sec53-6, and RSY249 (the wild
type progenitor of sec53-6) were serially diluted and spotted onto
the medium lacking leucine, followed by incubation at three test
temperatures (24, 30 or 37°C), The data shown are reproducible in
three independent experiments.

Owing to the possession of identical amino acid
sequences (Additional file 2), it is likely that TuPMMA1 (in T. urartu) behaves like TaPMM-A1, and
AetPMM-D1 and D2 of Ae. tauschii may act like

Biochemically active PMM members in bread wheat and
its progenitors

From the presence of intact ORF, the results of yeast
complementation experiments, and the data of biochemical assays using recombinant proteins, we deduce that
bread wheat expresses four biochemically active PMMs,
TaPMM-A1, B1, D1 and D2. The primary structure and
basic biochemical function of the four PMMs are similar
to their orthologs in human, S. cerevisiae and Arabidopsis. In contrast to TaPMM-A1, B1, D1 and D2,
TaPMM-B2 is probably not active in vivo because it did
not complement PMM deficiency of yeast sec53-6 cells
efficiently, and was not catalytically competent in the
in vitro biochemical assay. The lack of detectable biochemical activity by TaPMM-B2 correlates with the presence of unusual amino acid substitutions in its deduced
protein (Additional file 3). Further work is needed to
determine the specific amino acid change(s) responsible
for decreasing the biochemical activity of TaPMM-B2.

The purified recombinant PMMs were each tested under three
temperature conditions (24, 30 and 37°C), with mannose-1phosphate as the substrate. The OD340 readings, recorded at 10
min after the start of the reaction, were used to compare the
relative activity levels of the six PMMs under different temperatures.
Means ± s.d. were each calculated using the results of triplicate
measurements. Different letters above the bars suggest that the
means differ significantly (P £ 0.05). The data shown are
representative of three independent experiments.

TaPMM-D1 and D2, respectively. Contrary to the above
scenario, it is not possible to deduce the biochemical
activity of TtPMM-B1 and B2 based on the data gathered for TaPMM-B1 and B2, because complete amino
acid sequence identity did not exist between the two B1
or B2 members (Additional file 2).
Main features of PMM evolution in diploid and polyploid
Triticeae species

Despite its vital importance in eukaryotes, the molecular
evolution of PMM has not been investigated in higher
plants previously, and has been studied only recently in
animals. Several investigations suggest that the presence
of two functional PMM copies in human and murine
cells may be caused by a gene duplication event that
occurred 75 to 110 MYA [30,32-34]. From the data presented in this work, the main features in the evolution
of PMM genes in diploid and polyploid Triticeae species
may be summarized below. First, a major event in PMM
evolution in the diploid Triticeae species carrying AA,
AmAm, BB, CC, DD, HH, MM, NN, RR, SS, SbSb, SlSl,
S s Ss , S shS sh, S tS t or UU genomes is the duplication of
PMM. This duplication event gave rise to two different
PMM genes, PMM-1 and 2, located on groups 2 and 4
chromosomes, respectively. Out of the two PMM genes
in diploid Triticeae species, PMM-1 is likely more
ancestral. This possibility is mainly supported by 1) the
phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 2, 2) the existence of
a single PMM gene in rice, and 3) the established syntenic relationship between Triticeae group 2 chromosomes (on which PMM-1 homoeologs are located) and
rice chromosome 4 (on which OsPMM resides) [27-29].
Second, the PMM duplication, as discussed above,
occurred after the divergence between B. distachyon and
wheat, but before the radiation of diploid Triticeae genomes. This is supported by not only the presence of two
different PMM gene members in many diploid Triticeae
genomes examined in this work, but also the estimated
divergence time between TaPMM-1 and TaPMM-2
genes (Table 3). The two estimates, whether 16.6 ± 3.6
or 18.9 ± 4.0 MY, are both much larger than the divergence time between wheat and barley (about 11 MY)
reported in past studies [19-22]. But they are substantially smaller than the divergence time between B. distachyon and wheat (35 to 37.8 MY) calculated by
previous investigations [35,36]. Third, substantial differences exist in the evolutionary patterns of PMM-1 and 2
genes. PMM-1 genes generally had intact ORF, their
transcript levels in the vegetative and reproductive
organs were comparatively higher (Figure 3), and their
protein products were all biochemically active (Figure
5). By contrast, multiple types of defects occurred to
PMM-2 members. The PMM-A2 copies in bread wheat
and its diploid and tetraploid progenitors and HvPMM-

Page 9 of 16

2 in barley possessed mutated ORF (Table 1). TaPMMB2 encoded a protein with undetectable biochemical
activity (Figure 4). The recombinant protein of
TaPMM-D2 was significantly less active than that of the
product of TaPMM-D1 (Figure 5). Moreover, the three
PMM-2 members in bread wheat all exhibited lower
transcript levels relative to their PMM-1 paralogs (Figure 3). Fourth, the differences of PMM-1 and 2 genes
established at the diploid level (i.e., in the Au or D genomes) are basically retained in polyploid wheats. Thus,
PMM-A1 is active in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid
levels whereas the ORF of PMM-A2 is disrupted at all
three ploidy levels. The two PMM genes encoded in D
genome are all active in both Ae. tauschii and bread
wheat. In contrast to the PMM genes in A and D genomes, the origin of the contrasting biochemical features
of the two B genome PMM members in bread wheat is
unclear at present, because the absence of a diploid species containing the B genome made it difficult to study
the evolution of PMM-B1 and B2 members at the
diploid level. Finally, from the data described in Additional file 6, the duplicated PMM genes in the G, C, N,
M and U genomes are also likely retained in the tetraploid species possessing AAGG, DDCC, DDMM,
DDNN or UUMM genomes, although further work is
needed to study the PMM genes in these species in
more detail.
Because PMM-1 and 2 genes were located on groups
2 and 4 chromosomes, respectively, in wheat and progenitors and barley, the duplication event that led to the
formation of two PMM copies in the ancestral Triticeae
species must have occurred interchromosomally. Strong
evidence for the occurrence of interchromosomal duplications in wheat genome evolution has been obtained in
recent years [37-39]. Importantly, it has been suggested
that these duplications are largely conserved across different Triticeae species [39,40]. However, it is still not
well understood how these events might be accomplished in Triticeae genomes. Thus, the PMM duplication reported here may serve as a useful model for
studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the
interchromosomal duplications in Triticeae in the
future.
The average nucleotide substitution rates of grass
PMM-1 or 2 genes estimated based on the 60 MY divergence time between rice and wheat by this work are
both lower than the commonly adopted mutation rate
(6.5 × 10 -9 per site per year) for grass genes [41-44].
This may not be unusual because evolutionary rates frequently differ among different grass genes [45]. For
example, the mutation rates of ten randomly selected
grass genes have been found to vary from 4.1 to 7.1 ×
10-9 per site per year [45]. Furthermore, we estimated
that the divergence time between BdPMM and wheat

Yu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/214

PMM-1 genes was about 40.2 ± 6.6 MY (Table 3) using
the average nucleotide substitution rate calculated for
grass PMM-1 genes. This estimate is comparable to the
previously reported timeline (35 to 37.8 MY) for the
divergence of the two species [35,36].
Possible mechanisms involved in the evolution of PMM-1
and 2 genes

Past studies have suggested several fates in the evolution
of duplicated genes [46-48]. Neofunctionalization leads
to the acquisition of new function by one copy, whereas
subfunctionalization renders the progenitor and the
duplicated copy acquiring non-overlapping but complementary expression patterns. Non-functionalization
results in pseudogenization of one of the duplicates. In
barley, the duplicate copy of HvHox2 (encoding a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor) acquired a
new function in controlling spikelet fertility [49]. In rice,
evidence for subfunctionalization has been obtained for
two C-class MADS box genes (OSMADS3 and
OSMADS58) [50]. The evolutionary process of duplicated genes may be divided into two stages [51]. During
the early stage, the duplicates generally evolve under
purifying selection, with a phase of relaxed selective
constraint immediately after the duplication [51,52].
During the later stage, the great majority of the duplicates become non-functional pseudogenes that are no
longer expressed, with only a few of them being
involved in neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization
[51-53].
From the data in Table 4 and the main evolutionary
features of PMM-1 and 2 genes discussed above, we
suggest that 1) purifying selection, but not positive
selection, may have dominated the evolution of PMM
gene family in wheat and relatives, and 2) despite the
prevalence of purifying selection, the function of PMM2 copies is not as strongly maintained as that of PMM-1
members. The first point is consistent with the findings
that the vast majority of duplicated genes in cellular
organisms experience purifying selection [51,52], even
though some of them are in the process of becoming
pseudogenes [54]. Owing to purifying selection, the
PMM-1 genes are generally and relatively stable. By contrast, TaPMM-A2 is close to becoming a non-functional
pseudogene, because its ORF was mutated and its transcript level was decreased relative to PMM-1 genes (Figure 3). This scenario may also apply to PMM-A2 copies
in the diploid and tetraploid progenitors of bread wheat
and HvPMM-2 in barley although further work is
needed to check if the transcript levels of these members may be lowered than those of PMM-1 genes.
TaPMM-B2 and D2, although possessing intact ORF,
also show signs of degenerative evolution, because their
transcript levels were lower than corresponding PMM-1

Page 10 of 16

members, and the PMM enzyme activity of their recombinant proteins was either undetectable or reduced (Figure 4 and 5). The degeneration of PMM-2 genes and
the comparatively high mean evolutionary rate of these
members indicate the occurrence of relaxed purifying
selection in the evolution of PMM gene family in wheat
and relatives, which may have affected PMM-2 copies
more strongly than PMM-1 paralogs. However, further
work is needed to verify this hypothesis.
In contrast to the degenerative evolution of the duplicated PMM-2 copies in diploid Triticeae species, the
two mammalian PMM members, products of a duplication event occurred before the radiation of mammals
(i.e., 75 to 110 MYA), all encode highly active enzymes
[29-33]. However, unlike PMM2 whose mutation leads
to hypoglycosylation of cellular proteins and severe disease [9,12], the deletion of PMM1 in mouse does not
cause obvious abnormalities in either growth or development under normal conditions [33]. Moreover,
despite their overlapping expression profiles, PMM1
does not compensate for the functional loss of PMM2
[32,33]. These findings have led to the suggestion that
PMM1 may have diverged from PMM2 in physiological
function [33]. This possibility has been confirmed with
the recent discovery that PMM1 but not PMM2 acts as
a glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the brain tissues [55].
Clearly, the unique PMM duplication event in Triticeae
plants revealed in this work differs from the one in
mammals in multiple aspects including the timing of
the event, the evolutionary fates of PMM members after
the duplication, and possibly the main mechanism
involved in the evolution. The evolutionary knowledge
generated in this work increases our understanding of
PMM evolution in eukaryotes, and may be useful for
future studies of PMM evolution in additional plant species such as G. max and P. trichocarpa, both of which
have been found to contain two PMM genes (see above).
The main active PMM isozymes in bread wheat tissues

Among the four biochemically active TaPMMs, functional
similarity may be limited to only TaPMM-A1 and B1
because their deduced proteins were identical, and the
transcriptional patterns of their coding genes were very
similar (Figure 3). By contrast, functional differences are
likely to exist among A1(B1), D1 and D2 members
because of dissimilarities in their deduced amino acid
sequences and transcriptional patterns. For further analysis of the physiological function of PMM genes in bread
wheat, it is necessary to find out the main active PMM isozymes in vivo. Considering the fundamental importance of
PMM in the temperature adaptability of eukaryotes [1,12],
the differences in the temperature-activity profiles of the
four enzymatically active TaPMMs are of particular interest. From the data shown in Figure 5, it is suggested that

Yu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/214

TaPMM-D1 may be highly active in a wider range of temperatures (from 24 to 37°C). The activity of TaPMM-A1 is
less than that of TaPMM-D1, but it is unique in exhibiting
the highest activity at 37°C (although this activity level was
still below that of TaPMM-D1 at 37°C). The activity of
TaPMM-D2 is generally lower than that of TaPMM-D1
and A1, especially at 37°C (Figure 5). This finding and the
observation that the transcript levels of TaPMM-D2 were
considerably lower than those of TaPMM-A1, B1 and D1
in multiple organs (Figure 3) indicate that TaPMM-A1, B1
and D1 are likely to be the main active PMM isozymes in
bread wheat tissues. Moreover, judging from Figure 3, at
least two main PMM isozymes are expressed in each of
the five organs (root, seedling leaf, culm, flag leaf, and
developing spike) examined in this work.
As displayed in Figure 5, rice, a tropical cereal and
adaptable to both tropical and temperate regions [56],
possesses a PMM showing very high activity levels at
elevated test temperatures (30 and 37°C). By contrast, B.
distachyon, barley and bread wheat, originated from
temperate regions [57-59], have the PMMs exhibiting
relatively high activity levels at 24 or 30°C (Figure 5). A
general decrease in the activities of the PMMs of B. distachyon, barley and bread wheat at 37°C seems to correlate with the temperate origin of these species. However,
compared with BdPMM and HvPMM-1, at 37°C, the
magnitude of activity decrease was much smaller for
TaPMM-D1 and D2, and the activity of TaPMM-A1
even increased relative to its performance at 24 and 30°
C. This indicates that bread wheat PMM isozymes may
be generally more stable than their counterparts in B.
distachyon and barley at elevated test temperatures
(such as 37°C), which correlates well with the wide temperature adaptability of the bread wheat crop [13,14].

Conclusion
This work has generated new information on PMM
genes and their evolution in bread wheat and related
Triticeae species. The main active PMM isozymes (e.g.,
TaPMM-A1, B1 and D1) in bread wheat tissues are
revealed. The three isozymes may be more tolerant to
elevated temperatures than their counterparts in barley
and B. distachyon. The insights gained in this work have
broadened the understanding of PMM evolution in
eukaryotic organisms. The resources produced here may
aid future investigations of the physiological function of
this important gene in the temperature adaptability of
bread wheat.

4. The general molecular methods for handling nucleic
acid and protein samples, PCR amplification, DNA cloning, and protein expression in bacterial cells were
adopted from Sambrook and Russell [60]. High fidelity
Taq DNA polymerases, LA-Taq (TaKaRa, China) and
Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech, USA), were
used in PCR amplifications. The accuracy of the yeast or
bacterial expression constructs prepared in this work
was all confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Cloning of PMM cDNA and genomic DNA sequences

Total RNA samples were prepared from the desired leaf
materials using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen,
Germany), and were converted into cDNAs using
Moloney Murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA). Public nucleotide and protein
data banks were searched using the cDNA and deduced
amino acid sequence of rice PMM (OsPMM) [6], leading
to the finding of the ESTs derived from wheat and barley PMM genes. By analyzing the obtained ESTs, the oligonucleotide primers permitting the amplifications of
full length cDNA and genomic DNA sequences of the
PMM genes from bread wheat and related Triticeae species (T. urartu, T. turgidum, Ae. tauschii, barley) were
developed (Additional file 4). With these primers and
the reverse transcription products described above, the
PMM cDNAs from bread wheat and relatives were
amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. The PMM
cDNA of B. distachyon was cloned using a similar strategy, except that the development of the oligonucleotide
primers specific for BdPMM was facilitated by the genome sequence of Bd21 (http://www.phytozome.net/brachy.php). Genomic DNA samples were extracted from
the relevant leaf materials as detailed previously [61],
and used for isolating the genomic coding sequences of
the PMM genes of bread wheat and related Triticeae
species and B. distachyon with the same sets of primers
employed for cDNA cloning.
During the above experiments, at least 70 positive
PCR clones derived from three separate cloning

Yu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/214

experiments were sequenced for each of the plant species examined in this work. This ensured the identification of the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences
corresponding to different PMM genes. The final
nucleotide sequences for the cDNA and genomic DNA
coding regions of a given PMM gene were each constructed from the sequencing information of at least
three independent clones. The nucleotide sequences of
the PMM genes cloned in this work have all been submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers are listed in
Additional file 12.
Investigation of PMM copy number and chromosomal
location

The genomic PCR products amplified with the IF primers (Additional file 4, Figure 1) from Xiaoyan 54 were
confirmed to be derived from PMM genes by cloning
and sequencing. The amplified fragments differed in
size, which was thus useful for distinguishing the different PMM genes and estimating the copy number of
PMM in bread wheat, its Triticeae relatives, and B. distachyon. The forward IF primer was labeled with D4
fluorescence by a commercial company (TaKaRa,
China), allowing the separation and identification of
PCR products via capillary electrophoresis (CE) and
fragment analysis in the CEQ/GeXP Genetics Analysis
System (GAS) (Beckman, USA). The preparation of PCR
products for CE and the subsequent fragment analysis
in CEQ/GeXP GAS were conducted following the supplier’s instructions. Using the same strategy, PMM copy
numbers in the Triticeae species carrying the diploid
AmAm, CC, MM, NN, RR, SS, SbSb, SlSl, SsSs, SshSsh, StSt
or UU genomes, or the tetraploid AAGG, DDCC,
DDMM, DDNN or UUMM genomes (Additional file 6),
were also investigated.
For investigating PMM chromosomal location, the
PMM gene specific fragments, amplified from CS, the
different NT lines of CS, LDN, and the D genome substitution lines in LDN background, were separated using
CE and differentiated by fragment analysis. The IF primers and fragment analysis were also used for mapping
the chromosomal locations of two barley PMM genes
(HvPMM-1 and 2). In this case, the DNA samples
extracted from the barley variety Betzes and its derivative chromosome addition lines in CS background were
utilized as templates for genomic PCR amplifications.

sequences of PMM genes were aligned using the Clustalw2 program (EBI website). The resulted alignment
was used for constructing phylogenetic trees by MEGA4
[62]. The number of substitutions per synonymous site
(dS) was calculated as described previously [63]. The
average nucleotide substitution rates for PMM-1 and 2
genes were estimated by the formula k = dS/2t [64],
assuming a divergence time of 60 MY between rice and
wheat [22]. The obtained rates were then used to estimate the timing of PMM duplication in wheat.
To investigate the potential mechanisms behind the
evolution of PMM genes in bread wheat and its progenitor Triticeae species, two complementary evolutionary
tests (one for difference in the evolutionary rates of
PMM-1 and 2 genes, and the other for the codon sites
under positive selection) were carried out by the
CODEML program implemented in the PAML package
[65]. The NJ tree, constructed using the cDNA sequence
of 11 active PMM-1 and 2 genes, was employed for
these tests. The one-ratio and two-ratio models [66,67]
were used for investigating evolutionary rate, whereas
the site specific models M1a, M2a, M3 (k = 2), M3 (k =
3), M7 and M8 [68,69] were deployed for testing potential diversifying selection at individual codon sites. Statistical analysis of the evolutionary data was conducted
as described previously, with the confidence level set at
or above 0.95 [70,71].
Semiquantitative RT-PCR

The seeds of Xiaoyan 54 were germinated for 48 h at
25°C, followed by 4 weeks vernalization treatment at 4°
C. The vernalized seedlings were then grown in the
greenhouse as described above. The root and seedling
leaf samples were collected after two weeks growth in
the greenhouse. The stem, flag leaf, and immature spike
samples were collected at the bolting stage (after 5
weeks growth in the greenhouse). The isolation of total
RNA samples from the collected materials and cDNA
synthesis were conducted as described above. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of the relative transcript levels
of 6 TaPMM genes in different wheat organs was performed using gene specific primers (Additional file 4),
and following the method detailed previously [72]. The
amplification of wheat tubulin transcripts served as an
internal control, and the reproducibility of the transcriptional patterns revealed was verified in three independent experiments.

Bioinformatic, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of
PMM

Yeast complementation

Bioinformatic investigations of cloned PMM genes were
carried out using the softwares installed in public websites, including EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/),
ExPASy (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/) and NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Full length genomic DNA

The complementation assay was conducted as described
previously [6]. Briefly, five complementation constructs
(p181-A1, B1, D1, B2 and D2) were prepared by cloning
the cDNAs of TaPMM-A1, B1, D1, B2 and D2 individually into the yeast expression vector p181AINE. The

Yu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:214

oligonucleotide primers used for amplifying TaPMM
cDNAs during the cloning are listed in Additional file 4.
The five constructs, together with the empty vector control (p181-VC), were individually introduced into the
sec53-6 strain whose endogenous PMM harbors a temperature sensitive mutation [1]. The recombinant strains
were serially diluted and plated onto agar medium, followed by incubation at three temperatures (24, 30 and
37°C). As controls, sec53-6 and its wild type progenitor
RSY249 were also included in the growth assays. Successful complementation by TaPMM expression was
indicated by restoring the growth of sec53-6 cells at elevated temperatures (30 and 37°C). The complementation
assay was repeated three times to verify the reproducibility of the data obtained.

Biochemical analysis of recombinant PMMs

Additional file 4: Oligonucleotide primers used in this work.

The PMM cDNAs from bread wheat (TaPMM-A1, B1,
D1, B2 and D2), barley (HvPMM-1), B. distachyon
(BdPMM) and rice (OsPMM) were individually cloned
into the bacterial expression vector pET-30a (Novagen,
USA), in order to express recombinant PMM proteins
with a C-terminal histidine tag. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplifying PMM cDNAs during preparing the bacterial expression constructs are provided in
Additional file 4. The induction of PMM cDNA expression in the bacterial cells and the purification of histidine tagged PMMs through metal chelate affinity
chromatography were accomplished as described previously [6]. The purified PMMs were characterized
using 10% SDS-PAGE, and were confirmed to be the
desired histidine tagged proteins by protein blotting
using an anti-histidine antibody (Roche Diagnostic
GmbH, Germany) [6].
The kinetic properties of the purified recombinant
TaPMM-A1, B2, D1 and D2 were investigated using
mannose-1-phosphate as the substrate, and following
the method detailed in our earlier work [6]. The assay
was repeated three times for each of the four recombinant TaPMMs. The resultant data were used to calculate average K m values. The temperature-activity
characteristics of OsPMM, BdPMM, HvPMM-1, and
TaPMM-A1, D1 and D2 were examined using 1 mmol/
L mannose-1-phosphate as the substrate, with the assays
conducted at three different temperatures (24, 30 and
37°C). The OD 340 readings were collected at 10 min
after the start of the enzyme assays. At this time point,
the reactions catalyzed by the six recombinant PMMs
were in the linear phase. The assay was repeated three
times per recombinant PMM per test temperature, with
each assay consisting of three technical replicates. The
OD 340 readings obtained were statistically analyzed
using the software SPSS 10 for comparing the relative
activity levels of the six recombinant PMMs.

Additional file 7: Chromosomal assignment of PMM genes in
hexaploid and tetraploid wheats. The fragments specific for individual
PMM gene members were amplified by PCR, followed by separation via
capillary electrophoresis. The templates for PCR were prepared from
Chinese Spring (CS), the nulli-tetrasomic (NT) lines of CS, the durum
wheat variety Langdon (LDN), and the D genome substitution lines in
LDN background. The PMM genes represented by the major peaks
(fragments) are shown. The minor peaks labeled by asterisks are due to
DNA size markers. The scale on the horizontal axis indicates fragment
size. (a) Compared to the presence of all six PMM specific fragments in
CS, the fragments representing PMM-A1, B1, D1, A2 or D2 genes were
specifically absent from the NT lines lacking chromosomes 2A (N2AT2D),
2B (N2BT2D), 2D (N2DT2A), 4A (N4AT4D) or 4D (N4DT4A). The six PMM
specific fragments were all amplified in the NT lines lacking other groups
(i.e., 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7) of chromosomes (data not shown). (b) The presence
of four PMM specific fragments in LDN. Note that the fragments
representing PMM-A1, B1 or B2 genes were not amplified from the
substitution lines 2D(2A) (lacking 2A chromosome), 2D(2B) (lacking 2B
chromosome) or 4D(4B) (lacking 4B chromosome). The fragment
representing PMM-D1 was amplified from 2D(2A) and 2D(2B) owing to
the presence of 2D chromosome in the two lines. Similarly, the fragment
representing PMM-D2 was amplifiable from 4D(4B) due to the presence
of 4D chromosome in this line. The PMM-A1, B1, A2 and B2 fragments
were all amplifiable in the other substitution lines in which 2A, 2B, 4A
and 4B chromosomes are not involved in the substitution by D genome
chromosomes (data not shown). The data displayed are typical of five
independent sets of experiments.
Additional file 8: Chromosomal locations of barley PMM genes
(HvPMM-1 and 2). The genomic DNA samples, extracted from the bread

genes from Triticeae species. The peaks in blue represent PCR fragments
amplified from specific bread wheat or barley PMM genes. The six PMM
genes in CS are abbreviated as A1, B1, D1, A2, B2 and D2, respectively.
HvPMM-1 and 2 were found in the two addition lines containing barley

2H (CS-2H) and 4H (CS-4H) chromosomes, respectively. The fragment
pattern of the remaining addition lines was identical to that of CS (data
not shown). The peaks marked by asterisks were caused by DNA size
standards. The data shown are typical of three independent experiments.
