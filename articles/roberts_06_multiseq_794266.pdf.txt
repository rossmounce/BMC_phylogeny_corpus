Abstract
Background: Since the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2000, bioinformatic
data have been accumulating at an overwhelming pace. Currently, more than 3 million sequences
and 35 thousand structures of proteins and nucleic acids are available in public databases. Finding
correlations in and between these data to answer critical research questions is extremely
challenging. This problem needs to be approached from several directions: information science to
organize and search the data; information visualization to assist in recognizing correlations;
mathematics to formulate statistical inferences; and biology to analyze chemical and physical
properties in terms of sequence and structure changes.
Results: Here we present MultiSeq, a unified bioinformatics analysis environment that allows one
to organize, display, align and analyze both sequence and structure data for proteins and nucleic
acids. While special emphasis is placed on analyzing the data within the framework of evolutionary
biology, the environment is also flexible enough to accommodate other usage patterns. The
evolutionary approach is supported by the use of predefined metadata, adherence to standard
ontological mappings, and the ability for the user to adjust these classifications using an electronic
notebook. MultiSeq contains a new algorithm to generate complete evolutionary profiles that
represent the topology of the molecular phylogenetic tree of a homologous group of distantly
related proteins. The method, based on the multidimensional QR factorization of multiple
sequence and structure alignments, removes redundancy from the alignments and orders the
protein sequences by increasing linear dependence, resulting in the identification of a minimal basis
set of sequences that spans the evolutionary space of the homologous group of proteins.
Conclusion: MultiSeq is a major extension of the Multiple Alignment tool that is provided as part
of VMD, a structural visualization program for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations. Both are
freely distributed by the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics and
MultiSeq is included with VMD starting with version 1.8.5. The MultiSeq website has details on how
to download and use the software: http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~schulten/multiseq/

Background
In the field of bioinformatics, research activities are often
split into two distinct areas: sequence analysis or structure
analysis. Genomic and other sequencing projects generate
enormous amounts of sequence data that are initially
released with large portions annotated as either putative
or hypothetical. Structural data, even in the era of structural genomics, are produced at a slower pace but analyzed to a high degree before being deposited into the
public databases, such as PDB [1], SCOP [2,3]/Astral [4],
CATH [5] and NDB [6]. This difference in pace has led to
an increasing discrepancy in the relative sizes of these two
data sets. The total size of the sequence databases (NCBI
[7,8], EMBL [9], DDBJ [10], JGI [11], RDP [12], SwissProt/TrEMBL [13], CRW [14], Bayreuth tRNA compilations [15], and the Genomic tRNA Database [16]) is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the structure
databases. For a given protein, the large number of available sequences allows more complete evolutionary analyses. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) are
instrumental in identifying key conserved areas of a
sequence, developing an evolutionary history of a molecule [17], and examining the covariance within a
sequence in response to evolutionary pressure [18]. These
analyses depend on having enough sequences to perform
a well-balanced statistical analysis. The advantages of
structural data are that they provide much more detailed
information about the molecule in question, allowing
specific atomic level interactions to be analyzed. Additionally, since structure is more conserved than sequence
[19], structural data can be used to reconstruct many of
the deeper evolutionary branches that would be difficult
or impossible to determine with sequence data alone [2023].
VMD [24], which currently has more than 30,000 registered users, provides powerful visualization and analysis
capabilities for both structural and dynamics data generated from molecular dynamics simulations, as well as
energetics derived from molecular mechanics force fields.
It is optimized to handle large scale systems containing
millions of atoms. VMD also implements a flexible scripting interface for the creation of custom tools. The previous
Multiple Alignment [25] extension to VMD added only
the capability to use evolutionary information obtained
from multiple structures for interpreting structural results.
Our goal with MultiSeq is to extend VMD's capabilities
further by incorporating the more diverse evolutionary
data available in sequences into the analysis process.
There are already a large number of tools available to analyze bioinformatic data, but, like the field itself, they are
mostly segregated into either sequence or structure tools.
In the sequence world there are tools for viewing, analyzing, and editing an MSA like AE2 [26], CINEMA [27],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/382

ClustalX [28], and Jalview [29]; there are tools for creating
MSAs by aligning individual sequences and profiles, like
ClustalW [30], HMMER [31] and T-Coffee [32]; there are
tools for annotating sequence data such as Pfaat [33]; and
BLAST [34] is used for searching through databases for
related sequences. One popular package, MEGA3 [35],
provides an evolutionary approach to analyzing protein
and nucleic acid sequences, including many easy to use
features for determining sequence based phylogenies.
Similarly, in the structure world there are numerous tools
for visualizing structural data and performing structural
analyses, including RASMOL [36], STAMP [37], STRIDE
[38], and 3DNA [39].
There are also a few programs that combine sequence and
structure data either for specific purposes, such as SwissPdbViewer/SWISS-MODEL [40] and MolIDE/SCWRL3
[41,42] for homology modeling, or as part of a pre-computed database of attributes, of which STING [43] is the
primary example. Modeller [44] allows structural features
to be built using sequences and structures of homologous
proteins and nucleic acids. UCSF Chimera [45], a well
known molecular modeling program that originated to
handle small molecule docking, provides the ability to use
sequence data in conjunction with structural data. However, it lacks some of the features needed to perform wellbalanced evolutionary analyses, such as phylogenetic tree
construction and elimination of bias. Friend [46], a bioinformatics application, has many of the sequence features
required for performing evolutionary analyses, but has
insufficient structural functionality to fully interpret the
results in a structural context. InsightII and Discovery Studio (Accelrys Inc.) and MOE (Chemical Computing
Group Inc.) are popular commercial packages for analyzing protein/drug interactions based on protein structure,
dynamics, and energetics. Both programs can also use
sequence data to perform combined analyses. NCBI's
Cn3D [47] also supports both sequence and structure
data, although it is primarily designed for use with precomputed 3D superpositions and MSAs.
The complementary information provided by fusion of
these two data sources can give insight into evolutionary
changes in sequence, structure, and function. However,
the conceptual spaces of these fields differ, often resulting
in mutual incomprehensibility to researchers in each
field. MultiSeq, in dealing with both sequence and structure data in a way that is accessible to both areas, helps to
bridge this gap. It does so through the use of integrated
cross-referencing that acts as an informal version of ontology-driven knowledge extraction and discovery [48]. We
plan to enhance future versions of MultiSeq to incorporate formal ontological methods, including using the
work of groups such as the Gene Ontology project [49].

There is tremendous utility to be had in combining both
sequence and structure data within an evolutionary
framework using the four pillars of information science,
information visualization, mathematics, and biology to
organize the flow of information. An evolutionary profile
(EP) is a concise and complete representation of the diversity that has been generated by the evolutionary process
within a homologous group of proteins. A key step in the
creation of an EP is the elimination of redundancy present
in the sequence and structural databases [50] due to bias
in the selection of organisms chosen for study. The
sequence and structure QR algorithms have been developed specifically to address this problem [21,22]. These
smaller, more evolutionarily balanced profiles have comparable, and in many cases better, performance in database searches than conventional profiles containing
hundreds of sequences. For more diverse families or
superfamilies, with sequence identity < 30%, structural
alignments, based purely on the geometry of the protein
structures, provide better alignments than pure sequencebased methods. Merging the structure and sequence information allows the construction of accurate profiles for
distantly related groups. The success of using sequence
and structure based EPs for both gene annotation [23] and
the prediction of structurally conserved motifs [51] shows
their effectiveness. We also anticipate the usefulness of
EPs for studying, among other things, the relationship
between protein structure and stability, the evolution of
protein/RNA interfaces, and the basis of protein conformational motion.
The actual process of creating an EP is detailed in Sethi et.
al. [22], a tutorial [52], and a forthcoming applications
paper, but can be summarized as follows:
1. Load a set of sequences and structures and their associated metadata.
2. Align the data, using structural alignments as profiles
for aligning widely divergent sequence groups.
3. Perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine the evolutionary relationships in the data.
4. Check and adjust the alignment using the phylogenetic
tree and taxonomic information as guides.
5. Eliminate any redundant data that may be a source of
bias.
Within this process there are many difficulties, such as
identifying horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events and
misannotated data, both important for proper grouping
of evolutionary data, and developing a statistically wellbalanced set of sequences and structures. MultiSeq

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/382

attempts to lower some of these barriers to combining
sequence and structural data into EPs by consolidating the
tools necessary to perform such analyses in an intuitive
software package (Figure 1).

Implementation and discussion
Importing protein data for analysis
The primary function of MultiSeq is to provide an environment for the evolutionary analysis of bioinformatic
data from both structure and sequence. Before any analysis can be performed, however, the data must first be
imported into the environment, which is often a non-trivial task given the wide variety of sources from which data
may be acquired. MultiSeq provides a consistent interface
to allow data from numerous sources to be quickly and
easily brought into the environment and consolidated for
further analysis.

Structural data for biomolecules come in a bewildering
array of file formats, a large number of which can be read
and processed by VMD. To take advantage of this capability, MultiSeq relies on VMD to parse structure files and
present a 3D representation of the data. After VMD has
loaded the structural data, MultiSeq creates a copy of the
sequence portion of the data, stores that in its own internal data structures for use when displaying 1D representations of the data (see Figure 1), and then establishes a link
between its internal data structures and those of VMD.
This synergy means that MultiSeq works with every format
of structural data that VMD supports, including such common formats as PDB, XYZ, NetCDF, and CHARMM. MultiSeq also makes it easy to load multiple structures, which
is necessary during the construction of a structural profile.
Additionally, MultiSeq extends VMD's ability to load protein structures over the Internet by allowing multiple PDB
codes to be specified and individual domains of protein
structures to be loaded directly from the Astral database
[4].
Sequence data are often stored in a single file containing
multiple sequences, in either an aligned or an unaligned
state. MultiSeq can load sequence files formatted in ALN,
FASTA, Nexus, PIR, and PHY file formats. For FASTA formatted files, description lines are preserved and made
available through the electronic notebook, described
below. Upon loading a sequence file, MultiSeq can automatically download corresponding structural data, if it is
available in one of the known structural databases. Currently supported structural databases are the PDB, Astral,
and the subset of Swiss-Prot that is derived from the PDB.
A final method of loading protein sequence data into
MultiSeq is through the use of a BLASTP [53] search.
Given a target sequence or profile, BLAST discovers a variety of homologous sequences which can then be incorpo-

rated into the analysis. MultiSeq uses a locally installed
version of BLAST to search local sequence databases using
a single sequence, a profile of sequences [34], or a fragment of a sequence or profile. The search can be performed a single time or iteratively using PSI-BLAST, and
the search results are displayed and filtered before being
imported into MultiSeq, as shown in Figure 2. Current filtering options include BLAST e-score, taxonomic classification, and a redundancy filter based on the sequence QR
algorithm [22] on the BLAST generated alignment. As
when loading sequence data from a file, any corresponding structural data for the search results can be automatically downloaded when the search results are imported.
This opens up the possibility of running a BLAST search
against the PDB or Astral databases to load structures that
share sequence similarity with a source sequence or profile, a feature that is particularly useful for finding a template during homology modeling of a protein of
unknown structure [51].
Depending on the size of the protein, MultiSeq can easily
load hundreds of sequences and/or structures. The time

required to perform an analysis of such a large set, however, depends on the analysis method being used.
Organizing data to accommodate various analysis
frameworks
The number of different sources of sequences and structures can be intimidating and calls for an organizational
framework in which to work with the data. At the same
time, the varied uses of these data demand that the framework be flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of
users. MultiSeq addresses this issue by implementing a
flexible grouping system. Each sequence in MultiSeq is displayed beneath its group in the main display, as shown in
Figure 3A. The group header acts as an interface anchor to
allow the user to perform operations on the group as a
whole, and the status bar shows overview information
about the currently selected group. The default grouping is
based on the source of the data, i.e., structures loaded
through VMD appear in the VMD Structures group and
sequences loaded by a BLAST search appear in the BLAST
Results group, but the user can easily expand, rename,
and reorder these groupings as appropriate for the situa-

tion at hand. Additionally, the data can be automatically
grouped by taxonomic classifications (Figure 3B). Separating the data into evolutionarily distinct groupings
allows any analysis to be easily performed on each related
group independently.
Finding metadata automatically via the internet
Metadata (or "data about data") – such as taxonomy,
enzymatic function, or structural classification – related to
sequence and structural data can provide valuable insight
during many bioinformatic analyses. Various databases
accessible via the Internet store this information and
present it when displaying results but otherwise make little use of it. MultiSeq correlates this metadata by cross-referencing both the name of the sequence or structure and
any source information contained in the original file. Currently, MultiSeq can extract NCBI taxonomy information
[54], Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, and SCOP
structural classifications [2]. MultiSeq integrates this
metadata into the evolutionary analysis process through
grouping and phylogenetic tree functions.

Metadata can be added, viewed, and edited using the electronic notebook (Figure 4). The electronic notebook provides a consistent way to interact with all available
metadata for a sequence, regardless of its source. It also
provides a place to store notes regarding the sequence and
any processing that has been performed on it. Changes to
the metadata are saved along with a MultiSeq session,
described below.
Alignment of sequence and structural data
In order to properly analyze multiple homologous
sequences and structures, they must first be aligned. For
structural data, a version of STAMP [37] that has been
modified to better align end regions (details of the modifications are available in the methods section) is used to
perform the alignment. For sequence data ClustalW [30]
is used. In the next version of MultiSeq, a plug-in framework is planned to allow other sequence and structural
alignment programs, such as HMMER [31] and T-Coffee
[32], to be used. It is generally accepted that structural
alignments are more reliable than sequence alignments
for distantly related proteins and RNA molecules
[55,56,19], so MultiSeq allows a structural alignment to
be passed to ClustalW as a profile to seed the alignment
process. This technique can be particularly effective when
the structural profile is in fact an evolutionary profile and
contains a non-redundant sampling of distantly related
structures. In either case, though, the alignment is rarely
perfect and some manual editing is usually required using
MultiSeq's built-in editor.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/382

QR algorithms to eliminate redundancy and bias in data
Although the vast quantity of data available in this postgenomic era brings many new possibilities for analysis, it
also opens up the potential for introducing systematic
errors in these analyses due to the biases inherent in the
makeup of the various databases. MultiSeq includes both
the sequence QR [22] and structure QR [21] algorithms to
help detect and eliminate this redundancy during any step
of the analysis process. The sequence and structure QR
algorithms orthogonally encode a multiple sequence or
structure alignment as a multidimensional matrix, and
then perform a QR factorization on this matrix [57]. The
result is an ordering of the sequences or structures from
most linearly independent to least independent. A nonredundant set from amongst the available data (See Figure
4) is constructed by specifying a cutoff in either sequence
or structural similarity. The QR algorithms can also be run
on a specific region of the MSA so that the non-redundant
set can be generated based on, for example, one domain
of a multi-domain protein or an insertion in the sequence.
The sequence and structure QR algorithms combined with
the grouping and selection capabilities of MultiSeq constitute a powerful environment for constructing EPs for use
in bioinformatics-intensive tasks such as homology modeling [51] or gene annotation [22,23].
Analyzing phylogenetic relationships
Phylogenetic trees, which show the relationships between
related proteins or nucleic acids, are invaluable when performing evolutionary analyses. They provide a guide for
investigating why and how certain attributes developed as
well as identifying misalignments and HGT events. The
accuracy and speed of various tree reconstruction methods, however, varies widely from simple distance based
methods such as unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic averages (UPGMA) [58] and neighbor-joining
(NJ) to complex methods such as maximum likelihood
[59], which take into account an underlying theory of evolution. In general, distance based trees are sufficient for
many common uses [60]. MultiSeq creates UPGMA trees
using the structural measures QH [20] and root mean
square deviation (RMSD) as well as the sequence measure
of percent identity. It also creates trees based on similarity
using the NJ method of CLUSTALW [30]. After a tree has
been computed, it can be decorated and colored with various attributes such as species name, domain of life, and
enzymatic function, as shown in Figure 4. Additionally,
various manipulations such as collapsing, rotating, and
labeling nodes to assist in visualization can be performed.

One further use for phylogenetic trees within MultiSeq is
in conjunction with the QR algorithms to eliminate
redundancy from data. When either the SeqQR or
StructQR tools are used on data being displayed in a phylogenetic tree, those data are highlighted both within the

This feature allows for evaluation of the non-redundant
selection so that the user can adjust the cutoff. The orderings from the QR algorithm indicating which data are
most linearly independent are also displayed in the tree to
assist in this process.
Using visualization to illuminate trends
One way to effectively present complex information is to
color code the data using attributes that are not normally
visible [61]. MultiSeq presets attributes of the data as
coloring in both the 1D representation of the sequence
portion of the data and the 3D representation of the structural portion of the data. It maintains a consistent coloring between the two representations in order to facilitate
an easy mental transition between them. Many different
sequence and structural metrics are currently implemented as coloring choices and the addition of custom
coloring methods is supported through a programming
interface. The current list of standard metrics is: sequence
conservation, sequence entropy, percent sequence identity, sequence similarity, Qres structural similarity, residue
type, and structural RMSD. In addition to calculating
attribute values, MultiSeq can import them from a tab or
space delimited file. This enables the importing of other

types of attribute data, such as those from HD exchange or
Φ-value experiments.
Many of the above coloring metrics are calculated by comparing two or more sequences or structures to get a value
representing the specified attribute. The default behavior
is to use all of the loaded data in the calculation of a metric, however, one can optionally have MultiSeq process
each group independently. Using this feature one can, for
example, view sequence identity across all domains of life
and then quickly switch to sequence identity within the
individual domains. This capability can be very useful for
identifying a signature of a specific group of sequences or
structures.
Another method of assisting in visualization is to hide
attributes that provide no relevant information in the current context. Often, eliminating this extraneous information can lead to patterns being more quickly understood.
One common technique of dealing with this issue in the
world of structural biology is through the use of secondary
structure representations, showing only the backbone and
secondary structure elements of a protein. VMD supports
secondary structure, as calculated by STRIDE [38], as a 3D
representation and MultiSeq can display it for structures

Page 7 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:382

as a graphical 1D representation. MultiSeq also provides a
bar and line representation that is particularly useful
when visualizing attributes that are zero over portions of
the sequence, such as experimental data.
Nucleic acid sequences and structures
MultiSeq also supports bioinformatic analysis of both
nucleic acid sequence and structure data, but the tools are
somewhat more limited in the present release. Nucleic
acid sequences may be imported as unaligned sequences
or as MSAs using any of file formats supported for protein
sequences. These data may be obtained from a variety of
databases including IMG, NCBI (Genbank), Bayreuth
tRNA compilations, CRW, RDP, and the Genomic tRNA
Database. We provide external scripts to convert files from
AE2 format (provided by Gary Olsen) and Bayreuth flatfiles to the FASTA format [62]. BLASTN support for finding related nucleic acid sequences is planned for the next
release.

Once nucleic acid sequence data have been loaded, multiple sequence alignments can be computed using the ClustalW interface within MultiSeq. Only coloring by
sequence identity works with nucleic acids, other
sequence-based coloring metrics specific for nucleic acid
will be incorporated in the next release. STAMP has been
modified to align nucleic acid structures by their backbone phosphorous atoms resulting in a structural alignment analogous to α-carbon based alignment for
proteins. When the alignment is complete the 3D representation displays the structural superposition of the
aligned molecules. The built-in structural alignment analysis tools, such as structure-based trees and coloring metrics, work correctly with nucleic acid structural
alignments.
RNA molecules frequently incorporate nonstandard modified nucleotides that can affect folding, structure, and
function. For example, the TψC loop in tRNA typically
contains a ψ, or pseudouridine, base. There are on the
order of 100 RNA-associated modified bases identified at
this time [63]. The RNA molecule, as opposed to its DNA
gene, must be sequenced to determine the modified bases
included. When this information is available in structure
or sequence files MultiSeq recognizes and appropriately
displays modified bases in the 1D representation. In the
next release of MultiSeq, QR will be available for nucleic
acids, and a canonical, evolutionarily balanced 16S rRNA
will be incorporated to help with phylogenetic analysis. At
that time secondary structure analysis tools for nucleic
acid structures will also be included.
Exporting data
It is often desirable to preserve an entire bioinformatic
analysis so that work can be resumed at a later time. Mul-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/382

tiSeq implements this by saving the entire environment as
a session. When a session is saved, all of the sequence and
structure data loaded into VMD and MultiSeq are saved
along with any alignments and transformations that have
been applied to them. Metrics, annotations, metadata
changes, and representation choices are also saved with
the session. Once a session has been saved, it can later be
loaded and work resumed quickly and easily.
MultiSeq also supports numerous formats for exporting
all or a subset of the data in the environment to a file. This
can be useful if an analysis needs to be run using external
bioinformatics software. For example, MultiSeq can
export all of the files necessary to run a maximum likelihood/parsimony based phylogenetic analysis of sequence
data using PAUP* [64], PHYLIP [65], and PHYML [66] or
a Bayesian based analysis using MrBayes [67].
A final feature of note is MultiSeq's ability to export publication quality graphics. The sequence window, tree
viewer, and plotter can all save PostScript files of their current representation. Since these are vector graphics, they
can be scaled and manipulated using illustration software
with no loss of quality.

Methods
Qres – We use a measure called Qres to calculate structural
similarity of each residue in a set of aligned structures. It
is derived from Q, which is used in protein folding to
compare the pair distances in a protein conformation to
the native one [68]. We have previously used this measure
for deriving protein cores by looking at structural conservation [21,20]. Qres computes the similarity of the Cα-Cα
distances between a residue and all other residues in the
protein, excluding nearest neighbors, to the corresponding distances in a given set of proteins. The result is a value
between 0 and 1 that describes the similarity of the structural environment of a residue in a particular protein to
the environment of that same residue in all other proteins
in the set. Lower scores indicate low similarity and higher
scores high similarity. Formally, Qres is defined as follows:

normalization is ℵ = ((Nseq – 1) (Nres – k))-1, where Nseq
is the number of proteins in the set, Nres is the number of
residues in protein n, and k = 3 except when residue i is the
N or C-terminus in which case k = 2.
QH – For measuring the similarity between two structures,
we use QH, which we have previously derived [21,20].
Like Qres, it is also adapted from Q, but accounts for the
presence of insertions in the structure. Briefly, QH calculates an overall score for the similarity of two structures by
summing the similarity of all residues and then adding a
term for each gap in the alignment. The more that an
insertion perturbs the structure of nearby regions, the
lower the resulting QH value.
QR factorization – The sequence and structure QR algorithms eliminate the redundancy from a collection of
sequences or structures, respectively. The output is the
smallest set of sequences or structures that represents the
evolutionary diversity present in the initial group. These
algorithms are based on a QR factorization with column
pivoting of a matrix encoding the sequence or structure
alignment. We have described each of these algorithms
and their utility in developing EPs previously [21,22].
STAMP – The STAMP structural alignment program generates both structural superpositions and sequence alignments using tertiary structure comparisons [37]. Two
modifications were made to the STAMP structural alignment program included with MultiSeq. First, the program
was modified to work with RNA and DNA by allowing it
to read structure files containing the phosphate backbone
atoms of nucleic acid molecule and to recognize the residues contained in these files. Second, the program was
modified to insert gaps into the multiple sequence alignment so that the trailing, poorly aligned ends of different
structures will be gapped with respect to one another.
These end-gaps are a natural result of the dynamic programming local alignment algorithm used by STAMP.
C++ bioinformatics library – Many of the algorithms are
written in C++, since TCL is less suited for computationally intensive work. To facilitate the development and
implementation of these algorithms, we have developed
libbiokit, a bioinformatics toolkit. This library is comprised
of classes that perform file I/O, such as FASTA and PDB
readers and writers; classes that represent commonly used
bioinformatic data structures, like sequence and structure
alignments; and stand-alone utilities that execute the QR,
QH, Qres, and phylogenetic algorithms along with other
standard measures used in the analysis of bioinformatic
data. Libbiokit is packaged with MultiSeq and is also

Conclusion
MultiSeq allows new approaches to be taken in bioinformatic analysis: new relationships can be found and investigated by combining sequence and structure data;
automatic download and use of metadata along with flexible grouping encourages organized analysis of unfamiliar
data; the ability to remove redundancy from large sets of
data helps to focus and speed up evolutionary analyses;
and integration with several popular bioinformatics tools
along with a versatile input and output ability reduce the
time and "busy work" overhead of performing any analysis. MultiSeq extends VMD's capabilities into the realm of
sequences based data and we hope that MultiSeq will help
bring more widespread use of sequence data to the world
of structural biology and vice versa.
MultiSeq is included with VMD starting with version 1.8.5
[69]. MultiSeq benefits from VMD's cross platform nature
and currently runs on numerous operating systems,
including Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows. Metadata databases are automatically downloaded and
updated via the Internet and can be stored either on the
user's local machine or a workgroup file server. The use of
BLAST for searching requires a locally installed version of
the BLAST software from NCBI and sequence databases
stored either on the local machine or a workgroup server.
Detailed instructions on configuring the software are
available in the MultiSeq manual available online [70]. A
tutorial is also available from the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics to assist in
learning how to use the features of MultiSeq described in
this article [52].
