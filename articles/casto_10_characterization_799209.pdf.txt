human populations provides insights into
An analysis of X-linked genetic variation inpopHuman structurevariation
Abstract
Background: The transmission pattern of the human X chromosome reduces its population size relative to the
autosomes, subjects it to disproportionate influence by female demography, and leaves X-linked mutations exposed to
selection in males. As a result, the analysis of X-linked genomic variation can provide insights into the influence of
demography and selection on the human genome. Here we characterize the genomic variation represented by 16,297
X-linked SNPs genotyped in the CEPH human genome diversity project samples.
Results: We found that X chromosomes tend to be more differentiated between human populations than autosomes,
with several notable exceptions. Comparisons between genetically distant populations also showed an excess of Xlinked SNPs with large allele frequency differences. Combining information about these SNPs with results from tests
designed to detect selective sweeps, we identified two regions that were clear outliers from the rest of the X
chromosome for haplotype structure and allele frequency distribution. We were also able to more precisely define the
geographical extent of some previously described X-linked selective sweeps.
Conclusions: The relationship between male and female demographic histories is likely to be complex as evidence
supporting different conclusions can be found in the same dataset. Although demography may have contributed to
the excess of SNPs with large allele frequency differences observed on the X chromosome, we believe that selection is
at least partially responsible. Finally, our results reveal the geographical complexities of selective sweeps on the X
chromosome and argue for the use of diverse populations in studies of selection.
Background
In humans, females typically carry two X chromosomes
while males are haploid for almost all X-linked loci, complementing their one X chromosome with the smaller Y
chromosome. This relatively small alteration to the standard of simple diploidy followed by all 22 autosomes has
profound consequences for X-linked markers relative to
their autosomal counterparts. Even under conditions of gender equality with respect to migration and population size,
the smaller effective population size of the X chromosome
means that drift may have a more profound influence upon
it compared to the autosomes. Some repercussions of this
are suggested by the results of Rosenberg et al. [1] and
Ramachandran et al. [2], who observed that X chromo* Correspondence: morgan21@stanford.edu

somes are generally more differentiated among human populations than are autosomes. On a worldwide scale, drift has
been invoked to explain why approximately 15% of the
genetic variation observed at X chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is between populations for the
51 Centre D'etude du Polymorphism Humaine-Human
Genome Diversity Project (CEPH-HGDP) populations
while that figure is only 10% for the autosomes [3]. This
observation raises the possibility that X-linked markers
may be superior to autosomal ones for distinguishing
closely related populations. In addition, each X chromosome spends two-thirds of its time carried by a female. This
means that X-linked markers are disproportionately influenced by female demography, making them useful for
detecting differences in the demographies of the two genders. Indeed, many recent studies have found evidence on
the X chromosome for skewed female to male population
size and migration rate ratios [4-6], suggesting that such

differences may be the norm rather than the exception in
human history.
Just as the interaction between demographic factors and
genetic variation is special for the X chromosome, so too is
the interaction between selective forces and X-linked
genetic variation. For the autosomes, a recessive mutation
must become sufficiently common to be present in homozygotes before selection can act upon it; this is not the case for
the X chromosome, where recessive mutations are always
exposed to selection in males. Consequently, given otherwise equal conditions, recessive beneficial mutations arising on the X chromosome are more likely to go to fixation
than those arising on the autosomes, while recessive, deleterious mutations are more likely to be lost [7]. The X chromosome's haploid state in males and its smaller overall
effective population size also mean that selection-driven
fixation or loss of non-neutral X-linked alleles proceeds
more rapidly than comparable processes on the autosomes,
regardless of the initial frequency of the selected allele [8].
While it remains unclear how important recessive, non-neutral mutations are to human adaptation and to evolution in
general, there is some evidence that positive selection acting on recessive, beneficial mutations has been important in
shaping patterns of X-linked genetic variation in humans
[9].
Given the special features of the X chromosome and of its
interactions with the forces that influence human genetic
variation, the analysis of patterns of X-linked genetic variation both independently and in comparison to autosomal
patterns has the potential to reveal features of large
genome-wide genotypic datasets that cannot be detected
using autosomal markers alone. Here we use a number of
methods to characterize the data represented by the approximately 16,000 X-linked SNPs typed as part of a genomewide panel in the 51 globally distributed CEPH-HGDP
populations. We begin by examining the population structure underlying variation on the X chromosome. We then
use Fst values and pairwise allele frequency differences to
examine population differentiation and explore what the
results of these analyses indicate about past demographic
patterns. Finally, we scan the X chromosome for haplotype
structure consistent with the influence of selection. We finish by discussing two regions we identified as being clear
outliers from the rest of the chromosome with respect to
SNP allele frequency distribution and linkage disequilibrium patterns.

Results and discussion
Data

The dataset described previously by Li et al. [3] consists of
656,995 biallelic SNPs genotyped in 938 individuals from
51 populations (in this study we consider all Bantu individuals as one population and all Han Chinese individuals as
one population); 16,297 of these SNPs are located within

Page 2 of 19

the non-pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome. As
the CEPH-HGDP sample set includes 383 females and 615
males, this dataset contains information from 1,261 X chromosomes. The non-pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome consists of approximately 148 Mb of genome
sequence, yielding a marker density of about 22 SNPs per
200 kb. This is about half the marker density of the autosomal SNPs in this dataset (reported by Pickrell et al. [10]
to be 40/200 kb), which is expected given that a tag SNP
strategy was used to select markers for the Illumnia 650K
chip and that the average recombination rate on the X chromosome is about 60% of the average autosomal rate [11].
The genotypes were phased using the program fastPHASE
[12]; for the X chromosome, known haplotypes from male
chromosomes were also used in phasing the female chromosomes.
Population structure

Given the X chromosome's disproportionate sensitivity to
female demography, it is possible that X-linked genomic
variation has a different underlying population structure
than autosomal variation. To investigate this, we analyzed
the X chromosome data with frappe [13], a maximum likelihood based method that establishes K ancestry groups
based on allele frequency patterns and then assigns each
individual K percentages that correspond to his or her proportional membership in each group. As about two-thirds of
the individuals in our sample are haploid for the X chromosome while one-third are diploid, we ran frappe on individual X chromosomes rather than on individuals. The results
of this analysis with K = 7 are shown in Figure 1a. The X
chromosomes are partitioned into seven clusters that correspond to the seven major continental cohorts - Africa, the
Middle East, Europe, Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania, and
America - represented in the CEPH-HGDP sample set. (In
contrast, the data contained in 20 X-linked microsatellites
was only able to resolve the CEPH-HGDP samples into 5
distinct groups [2]). These are the same 7 groups that were
observed when frappe was run on 640,698 autosomal markers [3]. The major difference between these previous autosomal results and Figure 1a is the failure of the Eurasian X
chromosomes to cleanly separate into Middle Eastern,
European, and Central Asian groups. While most Middle
Eastern, European, and Central Asian X chromosomes have
their largest contributions from their respective continents
of origin, most also have sizable contributions from the
other two Eurasian continents. This suggests a lack of clear
genetic distinction between chromosomes originating from
these three continents. Nonetheless, the X chromosome still
carries sufficient genetic information to reveal certain
details of population structure that were previously noted
for the large autosomal dataset. For instance, in both figures
the Adygei have significant European and Central Asian
contributions, the Hazara and Uygur have primarily East

Asian ancestry, and a handful of Sindhi, Makrani, Brahui,
and Balochi individuals have sizable African contributions.
Next, to assess whether the differences we observed
between our X chromosome frappe results and the Li et al.
[3] autosomal results were due to the number of markers
used in each analysis, we ran frappe on just the 19,632

markers found on chromosome 16. As with the X chromosome, the analysis was conducted using haploid chromosomes as opposed to diploid individuals. The results of the
frappe run for K = 7 are shown in Figure 1b. Overall, the
results for chromosome 16 appear very similar to those for
the X chromosome. There are some minor differences

Casto et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R10
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R10

between the two figures, particularly in the way some
admixed populations are partitioned among the seven
groups (note, for instance, the larger European component
in the Yakuts and the larger Middle Eastern component in
the Adygei for the autosomes). However, these differences
may be artifacts of the failure of both datasets (the X chromosome and chromosome 16) to cleanly separate into the
three Eurasian continental groups rather than robust differences in the population structure of autosomal and X-linked
SNP genotypic variation. For completeness, we also ran
frappe on diploid individuals. We did this first for the X
chromosome by running frappe on all CEPH-HGDP
females plus additional 'pseudofemales' created by randomly pairing two male X chromosomes from the same
population. We then ran frappe on diploid individuals for
chromosome 16 using the same number of females and
'pseudofemales'. This time 'pseudofemales' were created by
randomly selecting one chromosome 16 from each male
and then pairing these chromosomes within populations.
The results of these analyses are shown in Additional file 1
and are quite similar to the results from running frappe on
individual chromosomes. Also, to ensure that our choice of
chromosome 16 to represent the autosomes did not bias our
results, we ran frappe on individual chromosomes for chromosome 17. The results are largely the same (Additional
file 1), except that we observe less resolution between Middle Eastern and European chromosomes for chromosome
17. We conclude from this analysis that there are no major
differences in the population structure suggested for the
CEPH-HGDP populations by approximately 16,000 Xlinked SNPs and a similar number of autosomal SNPs.
AMOVA

We carried out an AMOVA analysis on all X chromosome
and autosomal markers using the same population and continental groupings as Ramachandran et al. [2] and Rosenberg et al. [1] (Additional file 2). We evaluated the
genotypes here as haplotypic data of known phase so that
all genotyped X chromosomes could be used. The results
are shown in Table 1. These two previous studies demonstrated that, for microsatellite genotypes in the CEPHHGDP, the within-population variance component is
smaller for X chromosome markers than for autosomal
markers for all of the various population groupings under
consideration. This observation has been attributed to
increased drift caused by the smaller effective population
size of the X chromosome relative to the autosomes. Interestingly, while we observed the same trend for most population groupings with our SNP dataset, some notable
differences were apparent. The within-population variance
components for X-linked markers are indeed smaller than
those for autosomal markers for the World, Eurasian, African, Oceanic, and American groupings. However, for the
individual continents of the Eurasian landmass, the within-

Page 4 of 19

population variance components for X-linked and autosomal markers are nearly the same; for the Middle Eastern
populations, the confidence intervals of the two values
overlap (it should be noted, however, that the X chromosome value is smaller and that the failure of the confidence
intervals to separate could be due to lack of power in the
test) and for the East Asian populations, the autosomal
value is actually lower than the X-linked value (the confidence intervals of the two values do not overlap for East
Asians). To assess the robustness of these findings, we carried out a second AMOVA analysis for the same population
groupings, evaluating the data as diploid genotypes. To use
as much of the dataset as possible in this analysis, we again
created 'pseudofemales' by pairing up random male X chromosomes within populations. We then randomly selected a
single chromosome 16 for male samples and paired these in
the same fashion so that the population sample sizes would
be equal for the two marker types. For this analysis, the
within-population variance component for East Asia is
again smaller for autosomal markers (here represented by
chromosome 16) than for X-linked SNPs (although in this
case the confidence intervals of the two values overlap).
This is contrary to the expectation for gender-neutral
demography that, in populations of finite size, the proportion of X-linked variance occurring within populations
should be smaller than that for autosomal markers and
could be explained by the existence of effectively more
females than males (or a higher female migration rate) in
some parts of Eurasia. Such gender asymmetric demographies can be restricted in time and geographical space,
which may explain why the same pattern was not evident in
the microsatellite AMOVA analyses of the CEPH-HGDP
populations; microsatellites have a much faster mutation
rate than SNPs and so are likely to be less informative about
events that occurred in the more distant past. In contrast to
the studies of Rosenberg et al. [1] and Ramachandran et al.
[2], a study by Segurel et al. [14] using microsatellite markers did find evidence for a higher female effective population size (and a higher female migration rate) in Central
Asia, although it should be noted that these findings specifically applied to patrilineal herding populations and not to a
more general sample set, such as the CEPH-HGDP populations.
Pairwise allele frequency differences

The AMOVA scores calculated above provide an estimate
of how differentiated populations within a particular continental or supracontinental group are from one another. We
would expect, though, that the effects of drift and selection
would be most pronounced between two genetically distant
populations, given the time that these forces have had to
affect allele frequencies in each population independently.
Because of this, we selected three pairs of distantly related
populations - Yoruba-Han, Yoruba-French, and French-

Han, and calculated for each autosomal and X-linked
marker the pairwise allele frequency difference (termed
'delta' or 'δ' by Shriver et al. [15]) for each pair. We found
that the average delta value was higher for X-linked than
for autosomal markers for all three pairs. We also noted that
the distributions of X-linked delta values all have a longer
'tail' region than the autosomal distribution for the same
population pair. To examine these tail regions more closely,
we tallied the number of SNPs for which delta exceeded 0.9
(hereafter referred to as high-delta SNPs) for each population pair (Table 2). On the X chromosome, there were no
SNPs for which delta > 0.9 in the French-Han comparison,
so for this population pair we tallied the number of Xlinked SNPs for which delta > 0.8. High-delta SNPs on the
autosomes and on the X chromosome often occur in clusters, with each cluster presumably representing a single
event, be it drift or selection. To gain a rough estimate of
the number of such events, we divided the autosomes into
13,395 200-kb regions; each region containing at least one
high-delta SNP was deemed a high-delta region. While
some high-delta regions did contain only one high-delta
SNP, many contained multiple high-delta SNPs. We carried
out the same process with the X chromosome, where there
were a total of 744 200-kb regions.
Overall, we observed that there were proportionally more
high-delta SNPs on the X chromosome than on the autosomes for population pairs with one African and one nonAfrican population (25 out of 16,297 compared to 62 out of
640,698 and 159 out of 16,297 compared to 265 out of
640,698 for the Yoruba-French and Yoruba-Han comparisons, respectively; Table 2). For the French-Han comparison, this excess of high-delta SNPs on the X chromosome
was not observed. This apparent disparity between the three
population pairs could be explained by a female-specific
bottleneck during the out of Africa migrations as recently
suggested by Keinan et al. [5]. When there are equal numbers of males and females, the X chromosome is more

heavily influenced by drift than the autosomes due to its
smaller population size; this effect is exaggerated when
there are fewer females than males. But is drift alone sufficient to explain the excess X-linked high-delta SNPs found
for the Yoruba-Han and Yoruba-French pairs? To address
this question, we utilized an equation developed by Segurel
et al. [14] that expresses the expected relationship between
X-linked and autosomal Fst values in terms of Nf/N, the
female proportion of the effective population size, and mf/
m, the female proportion of the total migration rate. This
equation was derived from known relationships between
Fst values and male and female migration rates and effective population sizes under the infinite island model with
populations of equal and constant size. We used the equation to obtain expected delta values for the X-linked SNPs
from the observed autosomal delta values. If autosomal and
X-linked markers differed collectively only by the relative
effects of drift, transformed autosomal delta values
(expected X-linked values) should not differ statistically
from observed X-linked values. We applied this transformation to our three lists of autosomal delta values varying Nf/
N and mf/m from 0.01 to 0.99. As the female portion of the
effective population size and migration rate in humans has
likely varied widely across time and geographical distance,
we wanted to test across all possible values of Nf/N and mf/
m, including 'Nf/N, mf/m' pairs where Nf/N < 0.5, as such
pairs represent female specific bottlenecks (that is, more
than half of the population is male).
Having transformed each of our three lists of autosomal
delta values for all possible pairs of Nf/N and mf/m such
that 0.01 ≤ Nf/N, mf/m ≤ 0.99, we tabulated the number of
high-delta SNPs in each of the resulting lists of transformed
autosomal/expected X chromosome (hereafter referred to as
TA/EX) values (for the French-Han pair, we tabulated the
number of SNPs with delta exceeding 0.8). The results are
shown in Figure 2 for the Yoruba-Han population pair and

the effective population size and the female proportion of migration were both varied over a range from 0.01 to 0.99. For each of the 9,800 possible
pairs of these values, a list of TA/EX values was produced from the observed autosomal delta values for the Yoruba-Han. The color at a given point on
the grid represents the number of high-delta SNPs out of 640,698 total SNPs found in this list. (b) The same as in (a), except that the color at a given

pairs. (In the transformation, the values of Nf/N and mf/m
are combined into a single term, given by (1 + mf/m)/(2 Nf/N). Because Nf/N and mf/m are combined this way, there
are multiple Nf/N, mf/m value pairs that produce the same
TA/EX delta values. This feature of the Segurel et al. [14]
transformation creates the diagonal bands of color in Figure
2 and Additional file 3). We see that for the TA/EX delta
values to contain the same number of high-delta SNPs (or
SNPs where delta exceeds 0.8 for the French-Han pair) as
were observed on the X chromosome, extreme values must
generally be used for both Nf/N and mf/m (for the YorubaFrench pair, Nf/N must be less than 0.08 and mf/m must be
less than 0.05, and for the Yoruba-Han pair, there are, in
fact, no such values). Having transformed our three lists of
autosomal delta values for all pairs of Nf/N and mf/m such
that 0.01 ≤ Nf/N, mf/m ≤ 0.99 and re-tabulated the number
of high-delta SNPs in each (alternatively, the number of
SNPs with delta exceeding 0.8 for the French-Han pair), we
also assigned these SNPs to one of the 13,395 autosomal
regions. The resulting tallies of high-delta regions represented by each list of TA/EX delta values are shown in Figure 2 for the Yoruba-Han pair and in Additional file 3 for
the Yoruba-French and French-Han pair. Again we see that
for the TA/EX delta values to contain the same number of
high-delta regions (or regions containing a SNP where delta
exceeds 0.8 for the French-Han pair) as were observed on
the X chromosome, low values must generally be used for
both Nf/N and mf/m (for the Yoruba-French pair, Nf/N must
be less than 0.52 and mf/m must be less than 0.36, while for
the Yoruba-Han pair, Nf/N must be less than 0.29 and mf/m
must be less than 0.18).
It is possible, of course, that we observe a large number
of X-linked high-delta SNPs because the populations under
study here were characterized by low values for Nf/N and
mf/m (due to, for instance, population bottlenecks; Additional file 4). To assess which values of Nf/N and mf/m are
most consistent with the distributions of autosomal and Xlinked delta values that we observe, we again varied Nf/N
and mf/m from 0.01 to 0.99. We then compared each resulting list of TA/EX delta values to the observed X-linked values using a two-sided Wilcoxon test. The results of this
analysis are shown in Figure 3 for the Yoruba-Han pair and
Additional file 5 for the Yoruba-French and French-Han
pairs. By comparing the results shown in Figures 2 and 3,
one can see that the overall distributions of TA/EX and
observed X-linked delta values are most similar for sets of
TA/EX delta values with proportionally fewer high-delta
SNPs than were observed on the X chromosome. This indicates that while there are Nf/N, mf/m value pairs that produce TA/EX delta values with proportionally similar
numbers of high-delta SNPs compared to what was

Figure 3 Comparison of TA/EX and observed X-linked delta values. The female proportion of the effective population size and the female proportion of migration were both varied over a range from 0.01
to 0.99. For each of the 9,800 possible pairs of these values, a list of TA/
EX delta values was produced from the observed autosomal delta values for the Yoruba-Han comparison. This list of TA/EX values was compared to the list of observed X-linked delta values using a two-sided
Wilcoxon test. The color at a given point represents the resulting P-value of this comparison. Red locations on the grid represent Nf/N, mf/m
value-pairs that produce sets of TA/EX delta values that significantly
differ from the observed X-linked values; white and yellow regions on
the grid represent Nf/N, mf/m value-pairs that produce TA/EX values
that do not significantly differ from the observed X-linked values.

observed for the X chromosome, these Nf/N, mf/m pairs are
not consistent with the distributions of autosomal and Xlinked delta values that we observe. Overall, our results
here suggest that even after accounting for the differential
effects of drift on the X chromosome and the autosomes,
there have been proportionally more events affecting the X
chromosome that cause significant allele frequency changes
resulting in high-delta SNPs. The above analyses were also
carried out using pairwise Fst values in place of delta with
similar results (Additional files 6 and 7); an excess of high
Fst SNPs and regions was observed on the X chromosome
for the Yoruba-Han and Yoruba-French pairs and an excess
of SNPs with Fst > 0.8 was observed on the X chromosome
for the French-Han pair.
Previous studies (Coop et al. [16]; Barreiro et al. [17])
have also noted that a disproportionate number of highdelta and high-Fst SNPs lie within coding regions. We did
not necessarily expect to make the same observation for the
X chromosome, since the hitchhiking of non-coding variants on selected genic alleles is likely to be more common
on the X chromosome. Indeed, while 32% (5,213 out of
16,297) of our X-linked markers are in genes, we found that
only 26.4% of all Yoruba-Han high-delta SNPs were

Casto et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R10

located within genes on the X chromosome. However, after
removing a large cluster of high-delta SNPs (one that contained 68 high-delta SNPs, including 65 non-coding ones)
from consideration, this percentage jumped to 44.4%. SNPs
with large allele frequency differences in the other two population comparisons were also commonly found in genes.
Of the SNPs with delta > 0.8 in the French-Han comparison, 52% were genic, as were 76% of the high-delta SNPs
from the Yoruba-French comparison (Table 3). In general,
we observed that bins of X-linked high-delta SNPs were
enriched for genic SNPs, while bins of X-linked SNPs with
delta values closer to 0 were not (Additional file 8). This
observation could be explained by an excess of genic SNPs
with a minor allele frequency ≤ 0.1. However, we detected
no such excess but noted that high-delta SNPs simply occur
more frequently among genic SNPs where the minor allele
frequency ≤ 0.1 than among non-genic SNPs meeting the
same criterion. These findings suggest that at least some of
the high-delta regions we have identified on the X chromosome have undergone selective sweeps, as selection is more
likely to have targeted coding variants than non-coding
variants; drift acting alone would be expected to influence
coding and non-coding variation equally.
For each of the X chromosomal high-delta SNPs, we
determined which allele was derived and which ancestral
using information from two chimpanzees that were genotyped along with the HGDP samples in Li et al. [3] and
information from the NCBI website [18]. We were able to
determine the ancestral state for the majority of the autosomal and X-linked high-delta SNPs. For the YorubaFrench comparison, 3 out of 25 (12%) high-delta SNPs had
a high derived frequency in the Yorubans, and for the
Yoruba-Han comparison, 26 out of 159 (16.4%) high-delta
SNPs had a high derived frequency in the Yorubans. For the
autosomes, we found that only 5 out of 58 (8.6%) highdelta SNPs had a high derived allele frequency in Africa in
the Yoruba-French comparison; that figure was 18 out of
247 (7.3%) in the Yoruba-Han comparison (Table 3). The
percentage of X-linked high-delta SNPs with high derived
allele frequency in Africa significantly exceeds (chi square
test, P < 0.001) that for the autosomes in the Yoruba-Han
comparison; this could be explained by a higher incidence
of hitchhiking on the X chromosome compared to the auto-

somes. An alternative, and intriguing, possibility is that the
X chromosome has been affected by a disproportionate
number of selective sweeps or drift events (for example,
bottlenecks) involving derived alleles in Africa. Looking
back to our identification of genic and non-genic high-delta
SNPs, we found some evidence that selection may indeed
be a player in this observation. Recall that for the YorubaHan comparison (when we excluded the one exceptional
high-delta region, 65.5 to 67 Mb), 44.4% of all high-delta
SNPs were in genic regions. If we take only those highdelta SNPs that have high derived allele frequency in
Africa, this increases to 50%. Similarly, all three high-delta
SNPs from the Yoruba-French comparison with high
derived frequency in the Yorubans are found in genes.
Tests of selection (iHS, CLR, XP-EHH)

To investigate the relative importance of drift and selection
in creating large interpopulation allele frequency differences on the X chromosome, we wanted to ascertain
whether X-linked high-delta SNPs tend to occur in regions
where the haplotype structure is consistent with the past
influence of selection. We subjected our dataset to three
tests - integrated haplotype score (iHS), combined likelihood ratio (CLR), and cross population extended haplotype
homozogysity (XP-EHH) - that were designed to produce
high scores in chromosomal regions that have been
involved in selective sweeps. Although we will refer to
iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH as 'tests of selection', it should be
remembered that these tests identify regions where selection may have influenced allele frequencies or haplotype
patterns; demographic forces are always a possible explanation for one high iHS, CLR, or XP-EHH score or an entire
set of elevated scores, including the scores we report below.
CLR and XP-EHH are most sensitive to nearly completed
sweeps [19,20], while iHS is useful for detecting on-going,
partial sweeps [21]. iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH were run on
each of the eight continental groups - African agriculturists,
African hunter-gatherers, Middle Eastern, European, Central Asian, East Asian, Oceanian, and American - individually (CLR and XP-EHH were also calculated for selected
individual populations; Additional file 9). Then, following
recommendations from previous work [10], we divided the
X chromosome into 372 400-kb regions and, for each conti-

Figure 4 Top ten regions for iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH scores and all high-delta regions. The numbers on the left side of each figure represent the
beginning position of a region in megabases. Each chromosomal region is 400-kb in length. The letters across the top of each figure represent the
eight continental regions: HG, hunter-gatherer; AA, African agriculturist; ME, Middle East; EU, Europe; CA, Central Asia; EA, East Asia; Oc, Oceania; Am,
America. In the delta figure, the column labels represent the three population comparisons: YH, Yoruba-Han; YF, Yoruba-French; FH, French-Han. For
iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH, each small column contains the numbers 1 to 10 denoting the top ten X-chromosomal regions for each particular test and
continental group with the intensity of the color corresponding to the rank. For XP-EHH, the double line separating the African agriculturist column
from the Middle East column signifies that the XP-EHH scores represented on the left side of the lines were calculated using East Asians as the reference sample while the scores represented on the right side of the lines were calculated using African agriculturists as the reference sample (Additional
file 9). For delta, each blue shaded region contains either a high-delta SNP for the Yoruba-Han or Yoruba-French comparison, or a SNP with delta >
0.8 for the French-Han comparison.

nental group, calculated one iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH score
for each region using the raw scores from that region (see
Materials and methods for details). In order to briefly characterize the results of these calculations, we selected the top
ten regions with respect to test value for each test in each
continental group and displayed them in Figure 4. As can
be seen, the distribution of top regions across the X chromosome and the relationship between the lists of top
regions across continents is rather different for iHS than for
CLR and XP-EHH. Top iHS regions are rarely consecutive
for any given continent and the same region is typically not
highlighted for more than one continent. The observation
that high iHS signals are often not shared across geographical regions has been commented on previously [10]. As top
iHS signals do not tend to cluster in adjacent chromosomal
regions, and as iHS results do not generally overlap with
CLR and XP-EHH scores (since iHS alone detects sweeps
in progress), we suggest that it is difficult to use iHS by
itself to detect targets of past selection; here we use iHS
results only as additional, complementary evidence to argue
for past selection at a given site on the X chromosome.
Unlike iHS, sharing of top signals between certain continents is noticeable with CLR and XP-EHH. Despite a deep
phylogenetic split between the two groups (see Figure 1B in
[3]), the top CLR and XP-EHH signals for African agriculturists and hunter-gatherers cluster in the same two regions,
62.2 to 63 Mb and 91.4 to 92.2 Mb, respectively. Neither of
these regions produces top CLR or XP-EHH signals for any
of the other continental groups. The sharing of these top
signals despite long-standing genetic separation could suggest a genomic response to a selective pressure produced by
a common African environment. Eurasian groups also tend
to produce top CLR and XP-EHH scores in the same Xchromosomal regions. This is not surprising given their
close genetic relationship, and was also observed for autosomal CLR and XP-EHH scores [10]. However, for several
consecutive chromosomal regions, 109.4 to 111.4 Mb, top
CLR and XP-EHH signals appear not only in Eurasia, but
also in East Asia, Oceania, and America. Specifically, this
segment of the X chromosome produces the top two CLR
scores for Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia, the top two
XP-EHH scores for Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania, and
America, and top iHSs in the Middle East and Central Asia;
it will be discussed in more depth in a subsequent section.
Figure 4 displays all of the 61 400-kb X chromosome
regions that contain either a high-delta SNP in the YorubaFrench or Yoruba-Han comparison, or a SNP with a delta
value > 0.8 in the French-Han comparison. We found that
31 of these regions also produced a top iHS, CLR, or XPEHH score for at least one continent. As iHS and XP-EHH
are based on haplotype frequencies, scores for these two
tests and delta values are not expected to be totally independent of one another (although the overall correlation
between delta values and test scores seems to be fairly low;

Page 11 of 19

for example, the Pearson correlation between Yoruba-Han
delta values and raw XP-EHH scores in East Asia is only
0.1764). However, the presence of a high Fst SNP in a
genomic region producing a high XP-EHH score has previously been taken as evidence that the region is a true target
of selection rather than a false positive [20]. It is also interesting to note that these 31 regions were not a random sample of the 61 high-delta regions. There were 4 clusters along
the X chromosome - 18.8 to 20.8 Mb, 65 to 67.4 Mb, 72.2
to 74.2 Mb, and 108.6 to 110.6 Mb - of 4 or more consecutive high-delta regions, and of the 23 individual 400-kb
regions in these clusters, 20 produced top iHS, XP-EHH, or
CLR scores. Conversely, of the 19 high-delta regions that
occurred in isolation (that is, they were not bordered on
either side by another high-delta region), only 3 produced a
top iHS, CLR, or XP-EHH score. It seems then that Xlinked high-delta SNPs, particularly those that occur in
clusters along the chromosome, tend to be found in chromosomal regions where iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH suggest
that the haplotype structure is consistent with selection at
that site.
Finally, we wanted to evaluate whether our results support the conclusions of any of the previous studies of selection on the X chromosome. As most of these studies have
been conducted with a few populations at the most, we
were particularly interested in whether there was evidence
for selection at previously implicated chromosomal sites
but in populations not previously studied. Several X-linked
genes have been suggested as selection targets in earlier
studies (Table 4). Many of them belong to a class known as
cancer/testis, or CT genes. While the molecular functions of
many CT gene products are not well understood, most are
believed to play a role in spermatogenesis [22]. The
remaining genes (listed in Table 4 as 'other genes') were
investigated in single gene studies and are associated with a
particular Mendelian trait of interest. The numbered regions
listed in Table 4 were the top X-linked regions based on
XP-EHH score identified as part of a full genome survey
[20]. These XP-EHH scores were calculated using 3 million
SNPs typed in the HapMap samples. To determine whether
our work supported the hypothesis of selection acting on
these regions and the genes discussed above, we tabulated
and averaged all the CLR scores, XP-EHH scores, and delta
values occurring within a given gene or region. We then
compared this average score to averages of all other sets of
consecutive scores of the same size (for instance, if there
are x CLR scores in region A, we calculated the average
CLR score for all other x-sized sets of consecutive CLR
scores). If the average score for our region or gene of interest was higher than the averages of 95% of the other such
regions, we considered this evidence of selection on this
chromosomal region. The results of this analysis are outlined in Figure 5. We saw no evidence of selection (by our
criteria) for most of the non-CT genes from our literature

Casto et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R10
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R10

survey. The only two exceptions for this were DMD, which
produced high XP-EHH scores in both African groups, and
G6PD, which produced high CLR scores in Oceania. Several CT genes did contain high CLR and/or XP-EHH
scores, most notably MAGEA10, which contained high
XP-EHH scores in all three Eurasian continents and Oceania, although these were not accompanied by significantly
elevated CLR scores. We also found some evidence for
selection in seven of the regions outlined by Sabeti et al.
[20]. Importantly, for six out of seven of these regions, evidence for selection was found in continental groups not represented in the HapMap samples, allowing us to more fully
define the geographic extent of these putative selective
events.
Chromosomal regions of interest

In evaluating our results, we identified two regions that
were clear outliers from the rest of the chromosome. The
genic and SNP content of these regions are discussed in
detail below along with the evidence that led us to identify
them as outliers.
65 to 67 Mb

This region was first detected by the delta analysis; in the
Yoruba-Han comparison, 77 high-delta SNPs were found
here. All 67 of the high-delta SNPs found between 65.7 and
67 Mb had a delta score of 1, while the remaining 10 SNPs
had a delta score less than 1. Although the clustering of
such a large number of high-delta SNPs in one region could
be partially explained by an extremely low recombination
rate, we found that rates in this region (0.9 CM/Mb on average for 65 to 66 Mb and 0.7 CM/Mb for 66 to 67 Mb) were
only about one-half to three-quarters that of the X chromosome average of 1.2 CM/Mb, and were higher than those of
neighboring regions [23]. The large number of high-delta
SNPs in this region was accompanied by a near total loss of
haplotype heterozygosity in East Asia (Figure 6). Our CLR
analysis also highlighted this region of the chromosome as
one of interest; it produced high CLR values for the East
Asian and the American populations as well as the African
populations. Interestingly, high iHSs were observed
between 65 and 67 Mb for Europe and Central Asia but not
for Africa, East Asia, or the Americas.
Next, we investigated the genic content of this region.
Our search yielded four genes, one of which, EDA2R,
encodes the ectodysplasin 2A receptor and is closely related
to the autosomally encoded ectodysplasin 1A receptor
(EDAR). Indeed, while each receptor is thought to have its
own unique, non-redundant function, they bind two ligands,
ectodysplasin 2A and ectodysplasin 1A, that differ from
one another by only two amino acids and both serve to activate the NF-KB pathway [24]. EDAR, which has recently
become of interest to human population geneticists as a target of positive selection in humans [25], harbors a non-synonymous mutation that is fixed in East Asian and American

Page 12 of 19

populations. The altered protein that results from this mutation and its effects on the NF-KB pathway are now thought
to be an important determinant of East Asian hair thickness
[25]. EDA2R also contains a non-synonymous mutation
with a high allele frequency difference between Africans
and East Asians. Indeed, this SNP (rs1385699) was one of
the high-delta SNPs identified in this region; the derived
allele frequency is 0% in Yorubans and 100% in the Han
Chinese, although unlike the EDAR SNP, this derived allele
is present at high frequencies in Eurasia (Figure 7).
rs1385699 has also recently been associated with a hairrelated phenotype; an association study of Sardinian men
linked the polymorphism to androgenic alopecia, commonly known as male pattern baldness [26]. The close relationship between EDAR and EDA2R and the obvious
similarities in the allele frequency spectra of their non-synonymous SNPs make it tempting to theorize that these two
polymorphisms could have become targets of selection due
to their affects on a single favored phenotype. However, the
molecular consequences of the rs1385699 mutation are far
from clear. Unlike the EDAR mutation, which alters an
amino acid in the receptor's binding site, rs1385699
changes an amino acid in one of three cysteine rich regions
of EDA2R, which are not involved in ligand binding
[20,26]. Further work is clearly necessary to understand the
relationship, if any, between these two mutations. It should
also be noted that EDA2R is not the only gene in this region
that could be a target of selection. Immediately upstream of
EDA2R is hephaestin (HEPH), which encodes a product
essential for the proper uptake of iron from the diet [27].
Downstream from EDA2R lies the androgen receptor (AR),
which, with its role in sexual development and subsequently in fertility and reproductive ability, is theoretically
attractive as a target of selection [28]. Moreover, the gene is
known to harbor a number of polymorphisms that, like
rs1385699, have been associated with androgenic alopecia
[29]. The androgenic alopecia risk alleles for these polymorphisms are contained within a single haplotype block
that may have been subject to selection in Europe [30],
although we found that the largest CLR values occurred
somewhat upstream of this area. Indeed, it should be noted
that the vast majority (62 out of 77) of the high-delta SNPs
that first attracted our attention to this region lie not in the
AR or EDA2R genes, but in the long intergenic region that
separates these two loci. Hillmer et al. [30] also noted that
this intergenic region shows high levels of linkage disequilibrium and produces high mean Fst scores among the HapMap populations. The accumulated evidence suggests that
this region may contain an important regulatory element.
108.6 to 112.2 Mb

This area of the X chromosome was a clear outlier in the
tests of selection. High iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH scores
were observed between 108.6 and 112.2 Mb for all nonAfrican continental groups. The highest scores were gener-

ally observed in the 800-kb region from 110.2 to 111 Mb.
This area also contained a total of 13 high-delta SNPs from
the Yoruba-Han comparison and 9 high-delta SNPs from
the Yoruba-French comparison. As with the 65 to 67 Mb
region, there is near total loss of haplotype heterozygosity
in East Asia in this region (Figure 6). In examining this
region of the X chromosome for genic targets of selection,
we focused our attention from 110.2 to 111 Mb because of
the distribution of iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH scores and the
location of the aforementioned high-delta SNPs. It was not
clear which of the five genes in this region is the most likely
target of a selective sweep. Of these five genes, three PAK3, DCX, and TRPC5 - encode proteins that are thought
to be most active in the brain, with PAK3 and DCX being
particularly involved in neuronal migration [31,32]. A
fourth gene, CAPN6, encodes a calcium-dependent cysteine
protease also found in the brain and in the placenta [33],
while the fifth gene, ALG13, has a yeast homolog active in
N-glycosylation [34]. PAK3, TRPC5, and CAPN6 have all
been implicated in certain human diseases, including
Alzheimer's disease for PAK3 [35] and neurodegenerative
disease for CAPN6 [36]. Several cases of X-linked mental
retardation have been linked to rare variants in PAK3 [37]
and recent research has theorized that TRPC5 may play a
role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis [38]. All
five of these genes are known to carry at least one non-synonymous mutation, although none of them have large intercontinental allele frequency differences.
62.2 to 63 Mb

High iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH scores tended to cluster on
different parts of the chromosome for African and nonAfrican populations. While the chromosomal segments
described above produced high scores for the tests of selection in non-African groups, high CLR scores were observed
over the interval 62.2 to 63 Mb for the two African groups.
Specifically, the first and third highest CLR scores for the
African hunter-gatherers occurred here along with the first
and second highest CLR scores for the African agriculturists. This chromosomal region contains three genes SPIN4, LOC92249, and ARHGEF9. Mutations in
ARHGEF9, which encodes a Rho-like GTPase, are associated with epilepsy and hyperekplexia (hypersensitivity to
certain external stimuli) [39]. Little is known about SPIN4
and LOC92249. However, all three genes lie between 62.6
and 63 Mb while the highest CLR scores are observed
between 62.2 and 62.6 Mb, so the target of selection in this
region, if any, may lie outside of a known gene.

91.4 to 92.2 Mb

Another chromosomal region producing high test-of-selection scores in the African populations is 91.4 to 92.2 Mb,
where the top two XP-EHH scores in both the African
hunter-gatherers and agriculturists were observed. The
highest XP-EHH scores in this region correspond to the
SNPs found between 91.4 and 91.8 Mb, which is the location of the gene PCH11X, a member of the protocadherin
family of cell adhesion and recognition proteins [40].
PCH11X has a homolog on the Y chromosome and is not
subject to X inactivation. Despite this, PCH11 transcript
levels are twice as high in females compared to males [41].
Previous studies have reported evidence of selection on particular members of the protocadherin family, including the
alpha protocadherin cluster on chromosome 5 and recently
PCH11Y [42,43].

Conclusions
We have explored the possible impacts of both demography
and selection on X-linked genetic variation. With regards to
the former, we were particularly interested in investigating
the possibility of male versus female demographic differences as these can be detected by comparing autosomal and
X-linked data. Previous studies have found evidence for
skewed gender ratios. Indeed, here we showed that evidence for asymmetries in both directions (male Ne/female
Ne less than or greater than 1) can be found within a single
dataset. Our results suggest that the picture of male versus
female demography is complex and that each study
addressing this question should be viewed as providing
insight on a particular geographical scale and period in history rather than an absolute answer.
Of the three analyses that were potentially informative
with respect to asymmetries in the demographics of the two
genders (population structure using frappe, AMOVA, and
delta analysis), we focused particularly on the results of the
delta analysis. We did so because the differences between
the X chromosome and the autosomes were so marked for
this analysis, because these differences were robust to correction for drift, and because this feature of X chromosomal
genetic variation has not previously been noted. We
observed that more high-delta SNPs occurred in genes than
would be expected by chance and that many high-delta
SNPs occurred in regions with top iHS, CLR, or XP-EHH
scores. Given these two pieces of evidence, we believe that
while demographic processes and drift are important in
shaping X-linked genotypic variation, the forces of selection are necessary to explain the observed excess of Xlinked high-delta SNPs.

Figure 5 Previously implicated X-linked selection targets with elevated CLR, XP-EHH, or delta scores. Each row represents a particular delta
comparison or a particular test as labeled. Each column represents a X-chromosomal region or locus that previous research has identified as being
under selection. Colored boxes designate regions where elevated test scores were observed (see text and Materials and methods for details); blue
boxes represent elevated CLR scores, red boxes represent elevated XP-EHH scores, and green boxes represent elevated delta values. Gray boxes denote regions where there are no scores for the corresponding test.

As selection is likely to have been important in shaping
patterns of genetic variation on the X chromosome, we used
iHS, CLR, and XP-EHH scores to identify possible targets
of selection. Our objective in this was both to identify novel
targets and use the diverse populations in our dataset to better define the geographical extent of previously described
selective sweeps. We found that putative sweeps often
encompass neighboring continents, but that the pattern is
complex. Coop et al. [16] enumerated three major geographical distributions for selective sweeps as 'West Eurasian', 'East Asian', and 'non-African' sweeps, but we found
evidence that certain subtypes exist. For instance, some
non-African sweeps extend to Oceania and America, while
some do not. We also found evidence for selection at several loci previously implicated as X-linked selection targets
and our results show that previously described sweeps often
extend outside the populations in which they were originally discovered. These findings reinforce the importance
of using geographically diverse sample sets in scans for
genomic targets of selection.
Finally, we highlighted two X-chromosomal regions that
are outliers relative to the rest of the X chromosome with
respect to SNP allele frequency distribution and haplotype
structure. We believe that it is likely these loci were influenced by selection in the past. In the case of the 65 to 67

Mb region, we found a promising candidate for a target
polymorphism - rs1385699, a non-synonymous SNP with
known phenotypic associations and large allele frequency
differences between African and East Asian populations.
Overall, both regions represent interesting foci for future
research into the role of selection in shaping genetic diversity on the X chromosome.

Materials and methods
Frappe

We used the program frappe [13] to estimate the population
structure underlying 16,297 X-linked SNP genotypes. The
input files for frappe were generated using plink [44]; each
X chromosome was converted into a diploid individual by
making all loci homozygous for each haploid genotype.
Frappe was then run with a maximum iteration of 500 and a
step of 100 with K set to 7. The program output was displayed as a figure using Distruct [45]. This process was
repeated to estimate population structure for 19,632 chromosome 16 SNP genotypes.
FST

The AMOVA analysis was carried out on the X chromosome using the program Arlequin [46]. A total of 14 CEPHHGDP population groupings were analyzed, including 12
that were previously examined by Rosenberg et al. [1] and

X Chromosome Position in MB

Figure 6 Change in haplotype heterozygosity between African agriculturists and East Asians. All sets of five consecutive X-linked SNPs were
assembled into haplotypes. Haplotype heterozygosity was then calculated for all haplotypes in the Yoruba and the Han. The abscissa represents the
chromosomal position of the center SNP while the ordinate gives the value of the Han heterozygosity as a proportion of the Yoruba heterozygosity
(Han heterozygosity/Yoruba heterozygosity). The green data points represent haplotypes centered between 65 and 67 Mb and the blue data points
represent haplotypes centered between 108.6 and 112.2 Mb.

Ramachandran et al. [2] using microsatellite markers. We
also included two additional groupings by dividing the six
African populations into hunter-gatherer and agriculturist
groups. The AMOVA values reported for each of the 14
groupings were calculated using all of the X-linked markers
that were polymorphic within a particular group. The 95%
confidence intervals were calculated from 20,000 bootstrap
runs. This process was then repeated to calculate the
reported AMOVA values for chromosome 16.
Delta

We calculated the allele frequency difference, or delta, for
each of the 656,995 SNPs in our dataset for three population pairs: Yoruba-Han, Yoruba-French, and Han-French.
For each comparison, we selected all SNPs for which delta
was greater than 0.9 and called these high-delta SNPs. Once
we observed that there were no X-linked high-delta SNPs
for the Han-French comparison, we enumerated all SNPs in
this comparison for which delta exceeded 0.8. To determine
how many of the X-linked SNPs in our dataset were in
genic regions, we downloaded the chromosomal positions
of known genes from the UCSC Genome Browser Website
[34]. All SNPs found within annotated gene boundaries
were scored as genic SNPs. The ancestral allele for some

SNPs was established using genotypes for two chimpanzees
that were genotyped along with the CEPH-HGDP samples
on the 650K Illumina chip. For SNPs that were fixed in the
two chimpanzees, the fixed allele was taken as the ancestral
allele. SNPs that were either polymorphic in the chimpanzees or for which there were missing data were not assigned
an ancestral allele. We then searched for SNPs without an
assigned ancestral allele in the NCBI database. Ancestral
allele information from this database allowed us to assign
ancestral alleles to some of these remaining SNPs.
iHS

Of the 16,297 X-chromosomal SNPs in our database, we
were able to calculate raw iHSs for 11,623 to 15,532,
depending on the continental group analyzed. We used an
EHH cutoff value of 0.1, rather than the standard value of
0.05, in order to slightly increase the number of scores that
we were able to obtain. For each continent, we then calculated the average raw iHS observed for each observed
derived allele frequency. Any SNP with an iHS that differed
by 2 or more from the average score for the same observed
allele frequency was considered a high iHS SNP. After
breaking the X chromosome up into 372 400-kb regions,
we tabulated both the total number of SNPs with an iHS per

region and the total number of high iHS SNPs per region.
The iHS assigned to each 400-kb region is the ratio of these
two values (number of high iHS SNPs: number of total
SNPs with iHSs; Additional file 10).
CLR

For each continental group, we ran the short and long arms
of the X chromosome separately, using a grid size of 30,000
for the short arm and 50,000 for the long arm. All SNPs that
had been assigned an ancestral allele were treated as
unfolded. For each sample set, we then converted the raw
CLR scores into 372 data points by assigning to each 400kb region the average CLR score observed in that region
(Additional file 10).
XP-EHH

For each continent and each test, a chromosomal region
was assigned the value of the average XP-EHH score
observed within that region for that test. As with iHS, XPEHH scores cannot be calculated for SNPs near the centromere and the chromosome ends. This left some regions

near these physical boundaries with no raw XP-EHH scores
for some rounds of XP-EHH testing. These regions were
assigned a value of zero for that round (Additional file 10).
