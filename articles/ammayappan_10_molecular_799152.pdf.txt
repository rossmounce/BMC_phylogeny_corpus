Molecular characterization of the virulent
infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV)
strain 220-90
Arun Ammayappan1,2, Scott E LaPatra3, Vikram N Vakharia1*

Abstract
Background: Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is the type species of the genus Novirhabdovirus,
within the family Rhabdoviridae, infecting several species of wild and hatchery reared salmonids. Similar to other
rhabdoviruses, IHNV has a linear single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 11,000 nucleotides.
The IHNV genome encodes six genes; the nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, glycoprotein, non-virion
protein and polymerase protein genes, respectively. This study describes molecular characterization of the virulent
IHNV strain 220-90, belonging to the M genogroup, and its phylogenetic relationships with available sequences of
IHNV isolates worldwide.
Results: The complete genomic sequence of IHNV strain 220-90 was determined from the DNA of six overlapping
clones obtained by RT-PCR amplification of genomic RNA. The complete genome sequence of 220-90 comprises
11,133 nucleotides (GenBank GQ413939) with the gene order of 3’-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5’. These genes are separated by
conserved gene junctions, with di-nucleotide gene spacers. An additional uracil nucleotide was found at the end
of the 5’-trailer region, which was not reported before in other IHNV strains. The first 15 of the 16 nucleotides at
the 3’- and 5’-termini of the genome are complementary, and the first 4 nucleotides at 3’-ends of the IHNV are
identical to other novirhadoviruses. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis of the glycoprotein genes show
that 220-90 strain is 97% identical to most of the IHNV strains. Comparison of the virulent 220-90 genomic
sequences with less virulent WRAC isolate shows more than 300 nucleotides changes in the genome, which
doesn’t allow one to speculate putative residues involved in the virulence of IHNV.
Conclusion: We have molecularly characterized one of the well studied IHNV isolates, 220-90 of genogroup M,
which is virulent for rainbow trout, and compared phylogenetic relationship with North American and other strains.
Determination of the complete nucleotide sequence is essential for future studies on pathogenesis of IHNV using a
reverse genetics approach and developing efficient control strategies.

Background
The infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is
probably one of the most important fish viral pathogens
causing acute, systemic and often virulent disease predominantly in both wild and cultured salmon and trout
[1,2]. The first reported epidemics of IHNV occurred in
sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) fry at Washington
and Oregon fish hatcheries during the 1950s [3-5].
IHNV is native to salmonids of the Pacific Northwest

region of North America and its current geographical
range extends from Alaska to northern California along
the Pacific coast and inland to Idaho [1,6]. IHNV has
spread to Asia and Europe, most likely due to the movement of infected fish and eggs [2].
As for all the Rhabdoviridae, the genome of IHNV
consists of a single-stranded negative-sense RNA. The
gene order of IHNV is 3’-leader-N-P-M-G-NV-L-trailer5’ [7]. The negative-strand RNA genome is connected
tightly with the nucleoprotein N and forms the core
structure of virion. This encapsidated genomic RNA is
also associated with the phosphoprotein P and polymerase protein L, which is involved in viral protein

synthesis and replication. Their genome codes for five
structural proteins, a nucleoprotein (N), a polymeraseassociated protein (P), a matrix protein (M), an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (L) and a surface glycoprotein (G), and a nonstructural protein (NV).
The diversity among IHNV isolates in the Hagerman
Valley region was first reported by LaPatra, who used
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to examine the
heterogeneity of serum neutralization profiles of 106
IHNV isolates at four rainbow trout culture facilities
between 1990 and 1992 [8,9]. Ten different serum neutralization groups were found, with three groups representing the majority (91%) of the isolates. Later, based
on partial sequence analyses of the G gene of 323 field
isolates, three major genetic groups of IHNV were
defined, designated as the U, M, and L genogroups
[10,11]. The M genogroup is endemic in the rainbow
trout farming region in Idaho where phylogenetically
distinct sub-groups, designated MA-MD have been
reported [12]. The MB, MC, and MD sub-groups are
the three most prevalent and widely distributed types of
IHNV in the virus-endemic region, and they have been
shown to co-circulate in the field for over 20 years [12].
To date, the complete nucleotide sequence of low virulence WRAC strain, belonging to the MA sub-group,
and strain K (Kinkelin, France) has been determined
[13,14]. Isolate 220-90 of the MB sub-group is virulent
to rainbow trout and widely used as a challenge virus in

many studies [8-12]. However, the complete nucleotide
sequence of this isolate is not available. Therefore, to
find out the molecular characteristics of IHNV isolate
220-90, we analyzed the entire genomic sequences and
compared it with other IHNV strains.

Methods
Cells and Viruses

The IHNV strain 220-90 was kindly provided by Scott
LaPatra, Clear Springs Foods Inc., Idaho, USA. The
virus was initially recovered from acutely infected juvenile rainbow trout during routine examinations of
hatchery-reared fish, conducted from 1990 to 1992 in
the Hagerman Valley, Idaho, USA [8]. Specimens for
virus isolation were collected when mortality increased
above 200 fish day-1. Viruses were isolated and identified
by methods previously described [15]. The epithelioma
papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell line from common carp
Cyprinus carpio [16] was used for the isolation, propagation, and identification of IHNV isolates. Cells were propagated in minimum essential medium (MEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2mM Lglutamine (ATCC, Manassas, VA). For routine cell propagation, the EPC cells were incubated at 28°C. To propagate the virus, the cells were infected and incubated
at 14°C until cytopathic effects were complete. The
supernatant was collected 5 days post-infection, clarified
and stored at -80°C for further processing.

RT-PCR amplification of the IHNV genome

Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant
using Qiagen RNAeasy kit, according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stored at -20°C.
The consensus PCR primers were designed using published IHNV genome sequences (GenBank accession
numbers X89213; L40883) from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The complete genome sequences were aligned, and highly conserved
sequence segments were identified and used to design
overlapping primers. The oligonucleotide primers used
in this study are listed in Table 1. RT-PCR amplification
of the IHNV genome was carried out essentially as
described for viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus
(VHSV), using Superscript III RT™ and pfx50™ PCR kits
from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA [17]. The RT-PCR products were purified and cloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO®
TA vector from Invitrogen.
To identify the 3’-terminal region of the genomic
RNA, viral RNA was polyadenylated as described previously (17), and used as a template for RT-PCR amplification. The cDNA was reverse transcribed using an
oligo (dT) primer (5’-GCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTT
TTTTTTTTTT-3’), followed by PCR with the IHNVspecific primer NheR (5’- CGTTTCTGCTAGCTT
GTTGTTGG-3’). The 5’-terminal of genomic RNA was
identified by rapid amplification of the 5’-end, using a
5’RACE kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis

Plasmid DNA from various cDNA clones was sequenced
by dideoxy chain termination method, using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster
City, CA). Three independent clones were sequenced for
each amplicon to exclude errors that can occur from RT

and PCR reactions. The assembly of contiguous
sequences and multiple sequence alignments were
performed with the GeneDoc software [18]. The pairwise nucleotide identity and comparative sequence analyses were conducted using Vector NTI Advance 10
software (Invitrogen, CA) and BLAST search, NCBI.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA4
software [19]. Construction of a phylogenetic tree was
performed using the ClustalW multiple alignment algorithm and Neighbor-Joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Database accession numbers

The complete genome sequence of IHNV 220-90 strain
has been deposited in GenBank with the accession no.
GQ413939. The accession numbers of other viral
sequences used for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis are listed (see additional File 1: Information about the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus
(IHNV) isolates used in this study for comparison and
phylogenetic analysis).

Results
The complete nucleotide sequence of 220-90

The entire genome of IHNV 220-90 strain was amplified
as six overlapping cDNA fragments that were cloned,
and the DNA was sequenced (Fig. 1). The complete
genome sequence of 220-90 comprises 11,133 nucleotides (nts) and contains six genes that encode the
nucleocapsid (N) protein, the phosphoprotein (P), the
matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), the non-virion
(NV) protein, and the large (L) protein (Fig. 1), The
gene order is 3’-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5’, like other novirhabdoviruses. The genomic features and predicted proteins
of 220-90 are given in Table 2. All the genes are separated by untranslated sequences that are called gene

are shown; the numbers indicate the starts and ends of the respective ORFs. Six cDNA fragments (F1 to F6) were synthesized from the genomic
RNA by RT-PCR. The primers used for RT-PCR fragments are shown at the end of each fragment. The RNA genome is 11,133 nucleotides long
and contains a leader (L) and trailer (T) sequences at its 3’-end and 5’-end, respectively. The coding regions of N, P, M, G, NV and L genes are
separated by intergenic sequences, which have gene-start and gene-end signals.

Predicted molecular weight of proteins in kilodaltons (kDa)

junctions. The untranslated regions at the 3’ and 5’ ends
are called the ‘leader’ and ‘trailer’, respectively. An additional uracil nucleotide was found at the end of the 5’trailer region, which was not reported before in other
IHNV strains.
ORF 1 or Nucleocapsid (N) protein gene

The first ORF, extending from nts 175-1350, contains
391 residues and it encodes nucleoprotein (N) with a
deduced molecular mass of 42 kDa. The N gene starts
with the conserved sequence (CGUG) and has the putative polyadenylation signal (UCUUUUUUU). The 5’untranslated region of 174 nts is followed by the first
AUG codon of the 1176 nts open reading frame (ORF).
Comparison of the published IHNV nucleoprotein
sequences with IHNV 220-90 shows that it is 98% identical to the 193-110, HO-7 and LR-80 isolates (Table 3).
The ORF 1 has 5’ untranslated region of 112 nts (from
putative gene start to AUG) and 3’ untranslated region
of 80 nts (from stop codon to the gene end).
ORF 2 or Phosphoprotein (P) gene

The P gene of 220-90 is 767 nts long and encodes a
protein of 230 amino acids (aa) with a predicted MW of
26.0 kDa (Table 2). The predicted P protein contains 6
serine, 5 threonine and 1 tyrosine residues, identified as
possible phosphorylation sites using NetPhos 2.0 server
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/. Among novirhabdoviruses, the
IHNV-P protein has an amino acid sequence identity of
35% with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV),
65% with Hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV), and 30% with
snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) (Table 3).
ORF 3 or Matrix (M) gene

The M gene of 220-90 is 744 nts long and encodes an
M protein of 195 aa residues with a predicted MW of
22.0 kDa (Table 2). Among novirhabdoviruses, the M
protein has an amino acid sequence identity of 36%
with VHSV, 74% with HIRRV, 35% with SHRV (Table
3). A 5’-untranslated region of 53 nts is followed by an
ORF and succeeded by 103 nts 3’ UTR.

ORF 4 or glycoprotein (G) gene

The gene for the G protein is located between 2948 and
4567 nts from the 3’-end of the viral genome. A 3’ UTR
of 51 nts is followed by an ORF (nts 1524) that encodes
a polypeptide of 508 aa residues, with a calculated MW
of 56.6 kDa, and succeeded by 42 nts 3’ UTR. The predicted G protein contains 20 serine, 6 threonine and 6
tyrosine residues, identified as possible phosphorylation
sites using NetPhos 2.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/.
Four putative N-glycosylation sites were identified at
amino acids 56-59 (NASQ), 400-403 (NNTT), 401-404
(NTTI) and 438-441(NETD) and one O-glycosylation
were identified at amino acid position 492. We compared the G protein of 28 IHNV strains from different
parts of the world. The regions between amino acid
positions 32-52, 131-204, 289-369, 380-416 are highly
conserved. The regions between amino acids 247-257
and 269-276 have a greater genetic diversity than any
other part of the G protein. The IHNV glycoprotein has
the following domains: signal peptide at N-terminal (120aa), ectodomain (21-459aa), transmembrane domain
(460-482 aa) and endodomain (483-508 aa), which were
predicted by SignalP server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/.
ORF 5 or Non-virion (NV) protein gene

The NV protein gene is located between 4570 and 4938
nts from the 3’-end of the viral genome. It encodes a
polypeptide of 111 aa residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 13.2 kDa. The predicted NV protein contains 1 serine, 2 threonine and 1 tyrosine residues,
identified as possible phosphorylation sites using NetPhos 2.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/. The function of
NV protein is not clearly known. NV is a non-structural
protein of novirhabdoviruses, which could be detected
only in the infected cells [20].
ORF 6 or Polymerase (L) gene

ORF 6 encodes the largest protein, the polymerase,
which starts at position 5017 and ends at position

10977. It encodes a polypeptide of 1986 aa residues,
with a deduced molecular mass of 225.0 kDa. The L
protein contains 67 serine, 38 threonine and 9 tyrosine
residues as possible phosphorylation sites. The predicted
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain is
situated between residues 18 and 1159. The deduced L
protein of IHNV exhibits 60%, 84%, and 58% identities
with VHSV, HIRRV and SHRV, respectively (Table 3).
The Genomic termini and untranslated sequences

Rhabdoviruses have conserved untranslated regions
between open reading frames for optimal translation of

viral proteins [21]. These sequences consist of a putative
transcription stop/polyadenylation motif (UCURUCU7)
which signals reiterative copying of the U sequences to
generate poly (A) tail to the mRNA. This sequence is
followed by an intergenic di-nucleotide AC or GC
which are not transcribed, and a putative transcription
start signal, CGUG (Fig. 2A). The gene junctions of different novirhabdoviruses are shown in Table 4.
The untranslated region of 3’ leader and 5’ trailer are
60 nts and 102 nts in length, respectively. The 3’ leader
of 220-90 is 63% A/T rich, whereas 5’ trailer is 60% A/T

rich. Like other rhabdoviruses, the genomic termini of
IHNV 3’-terminal nucleotides exhibit complementarities
to the nucleotides of 5’-terminus of the genomic RNA
(Fig. 2B). The complementary nature of genomic termini
involves the formation of a panhandle structure, which
is important for replication of rhabdoviruses.
Homology and phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were generated from the nucleotide
sequences of the ORFs and of the complete genome.

The complete genome and gene proteins of IHNV were
also compared with different members of novirhabdoviruses and the results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
Among novirhabdoviruses, HIRRV is closely related to
IHNV and has an identity of 72%. Comparison of the
UTRs and protein coding sequences of 220-90 strain
with novirhabdoviruses shows that non-virion protein is
highly variable than any other region of the genome
(Table 3). The 3’- and 5’- UTRs are more conserved

among Rhabdoviridae family members than protein coding genes (data not shown). The complete genome comparison of 220-90 with other two available sequences of
IHNV strains reveals 96% identity with WRAC, and 95%
with strain K (X89213).
The phylogenetic tree analysis of sequences of nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), phosphoprotein (P), and nonvirion protein (NV) of various IHNV strains are shown
in Fig. 3. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene shows
clustering of 220-90 with HO-7, 193-110 and LR-80 and
maintains 98% identity with those strains. Among the
available sequences, WRAC strain exhibits very close
identity (98%) with 220-90 for both P and M genes. All
the strains display 98% identity with the 220-90 M gene,
which demonstrates the highly conserved nature of M
gene. When the NV genes were compared, 220-90 strain
shows 95-97% identity with other IHNV strains. Previously, the North American IHNV isolates were genogrouped as U, M and L based on glycoprotein
sequences [10]. Phylogenetic tree of the G genes displays
that 220-90 strain belongs to the M genogroup (Fig. 4).

Discussion
A virulent IHNV strain 220-90 was isolated from the
hatchery-reared juvenile rainbow trout during 90’s in the
Hagerman Valley, Idaho, USA [8]. IHNV is endemic
throughout the Pacific Northwest region of North America, with range extending from Alaska to northern California along the Pacific coast and inland to Idaho. It causes
systemic disease predominantly in both wild and cultured
salmon and trout [1,2,10]. The disease typically occurs in
rainbow trout fry maintained in the multiple outdoor rearing units of rainbow trout farm facilities [8,12].
To date, the complete genome sequences are available
for only two IHNV strains [13,14]. Previously, only the
G protein gene sequence for 220-90 strain was determined (GenBank accession no. DQ164101). Comparison
of the G gene sequence of 220-90 isolate with the published sequence of the same shows nine nucleotide
changes, which results in 7 aa changes. This may be due
to different passage number of the virus in cell culture.
To fully understand the molecular characteristics of a
virulent IHNV, we determined the complete nucleotide
sequence of 220-90 strain. The genome is 11,133 nts
long and the gene organization (N, P, M, G, NV and L)
is similar to all members of the Novirhabdovirus genus.
The termini of the viral genome have conserved
sequences at the 3’-end (CAUAU) and at the 5’-end
(GUAUA) as other members of Novirhabdovirus genus.
Out of first 16 nucleotides of the 3’-terminus, 15
nucleotides are complementary to 5’-terminus of the
genome (Fig. 2B), which forms the panhandle structure
that may be involved in replication [22]. The length of
the 3’-leader of 220-90 is 60 nts, which is similar to

Page 8 of 11

HIRRV but slightly shorter than VHSV and SHRV (53
nts). IHNV has the second longest 5’ trailer (120 nts)
than other novirhabdoviruses, such as VHSV (116 nts),
SHRV (42 nts), and HIRRV (73 nts). Even though the
length of 3’-leader is consistent between the members of
genus Novirhabdovirus, the length of the 5’-trailer is
highly variable (from 42nt to 116nt). It is possible that
the difference in the length of trailer sequences may
have some functional significance, which remains to be
seen.
All the genes of VHSV start with a conserved gene
start sequence (-CGUG-) like other novirhabdoviruses,
followed by an ORF and conserved gene-end sequence
(A/GUCUAU/ACU 7 ). All the genes end with 7 uracil
(U) residues, which are polyadenylation signal for polymerase when it transcribes a gene. Polymerase adds poly
(A) by stuttering mechanism [23]. After this poly (A)
signal, there are two conserved intergenic di-nucleotides
(G/AC), which are untranscribed and act as spacers
between two genes. Polymerase skips these two nucleotides to next gene start sequence and starts transcribing
next gene [23]. Transcription of rhabdovirus mRNAs is
regulated by cis-acting signals located within the 3’ leader region and untranslated region between each gene
ORF [23-26]. In case of NV, the stop codon of NV gene
is merged with gene-end sequences (Fig. 2A). Transcription of rhabdovirus mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting
signals located within the 3’ leader region and untranslated region between each gene ORF [23-26]. The Kozak
context for each gene was compared, as shown in Fig. 5.
At position -3, all the genes have adenosine (A) nucleotide, except the ORF of N gene.
We observed that aa residues between 1-22, 106-150
and 206-268 are highly conserved in the N protein,
whereas residues 30-31, 41-43, 177-181, 203-205 and Cterminal region from residue 312 are variable. Phylogenetic analysis of the N protein shows grouping of 22090 with LR-80, HO-7 and 193-110 strains, with an identity of 98%. Phylogenetic tree of the P protein shows
clustering of 220-90 with WRAC strain, having an identity of 98%. The matrix (M) protein is an important
structural component of virion, forming a layer between
the glycoprotein containing outer membrane and the
nucleocapsid core. Matrix protein of IHNV is highly
conserved (Table 3). IHNV strains used in this study
exhibit very close (98%) identity with 220-90. In phylogenetic analysis of M protein, WRAC and strain K,
which is the same strain as Kinkelin from France
(X89213), form a cluster that exhibit 99-100% identity
with each other, and 98% identity with 220-90. Matrix
protein of rhabdovirus is involved in viral assembly, condensation of nucleocapsid, formation of bullet-shaped
virion [27,28] and induces apoptosis by shutdown of
host cell machinery in infected cells [29,30]. Because it

is highly essential for assembly and release of virion, the
matrix protein maintains highest homology among
IHNV along with the polymerase protein.
The non-virion protein (NV) of 220-90 shows identity
of 95-97% with other IHNV strains. The NV protein of
IHNV is conserved than counterpart of VHSV, which
showed high genetic diversity [17]. It was demonstrated
that NV-knockout IHNV replicated very slowly in cell
culture and was non-pathogenic in fish [31]. On the
contrary, NV-knockout SHRV replicated very well as
wild-type virus and it was shown that NV protein of
SHRV is not essential for pathogenesis [32]. These studies suggested that each species of Novirhabdovirus
genus has its own characteristics and one can not ignore
the importance NV in pathogenesis. The conserved nature of NV and its importance for growth and pathogenesis suggests that NV is highly essential for IHNV. All
the available L sequences for IHNV strains show highest
conservation (98%) as that of matrix protein (Table 3).
The L protein is packaged into the virus particle and is
involved in both transcription and replication [23].
Genomic comparison of IHNV strains isolated from
various marine species from different parts of the world
sheds light on the correlation of genetic sequences with
viral tropism and pathogenicity. The glycoprotein (G) is
believed to be involved in virulence and tropism because
it’s involvement in viral attachment and cell entry [33].
Comparison of glycoproteins of various IHNV strains
has shown long blocks of conserved region (data not
shown). The regions between residues 8-22; 32-52; 131214; 289-369; and 380-416 are highly conserved and the
rest is showing genetic variations, which are scattered all
over the protein. The major neutralizing epitopes have
been mapped to two antigenic sites for IHNV, at amino

acid residues 230-231 and 272-276 [34,35]. In this analysis, we found no amino acid substitutions at positions
230-231 among 28 strains compared. On the other
hand, residues 270-276 are highly variable, which supports earlier findings [34,35], and suggests the involvement of this site in antigenic variation and virulence.
A wide sequence analysis of mid-G region (303 nts)
within the glycoprotein gene of 323 North American
IHNV isolates revealed a maximum nucleotide diversity
of 8.6%, indicating low genetic diversity overall for this
virus [10]. The North American IHNV isolates, genogrouped as U, M and L by phylogenetic analysis, vary in
topography and geographical range [10]. The phylogenetic analysis of the glycoprotein of 220-90 (Fig. 4)
shows clustering with LR-80, FF030-91, 193-110 and
HO-7 strains, which exhibits that 220-90 belongs to the
M genogroup.
