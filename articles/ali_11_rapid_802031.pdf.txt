Abstract
Background: Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST), an obligate fungal pathogen causing wheat yellow/stripe rust, a
serious disease, has been used to understand the evolution of crop pathogen using molecular markers. However,
numerous questions regarding its evolutionary history and recent migration routes still remains to be addressed,
which need the genotyping of a large number of isolates, a process that is limited by both DNA extraction and
genotyping methods. To address the two issues, we developed here a method for direct DNA extraction from
infected leaves combined with optimized SSR multiplexing.
Findings: We report here an efficient protocol for direct fungal DNA extraction from infected leaves, avoiding the
costly and time consuming step of spore multiplication. The genotyping strategy we propose, amplified a total of
20 SSRs in three Multiplex PCR reactions, which were highly polymorphic and were able to differentiate different
PST populations with high efficiency and accuracy.
Conclusion: These two developments enabled a genotyping strategy that could contribute to the development of
molecular epidemiology of yellow rust disease, both at a regional or worldwide scale.

Background
Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST), an obligate basidiomycete that causes wheat yellow/stripe rust, a serious
disease in all major wheat growing regions [1-5]. The
development of different molecular markers has aided
the description of possible PST migration patterns [6],
the emergence of high temperature-adapted strains [7,8]
and the existence of recombination [9,10]. Despite these
recent developments, numerous questions still need to
be addressed, e.g. the evolutionary history of PST, its
centre of origin, its historic migration pathways or more
recent migrations causing new epidemics. These studies
necessitate the genotyping of a large number of isolates,
a process that is limited by both DNA extraction and
genotyping methods.

Two or three cycles of PST spore multiplication on
plants are usually necessary after sampling before DNA
extraction. Because of its obligate nature, PST cannot be
cultured on routine media to obtain sufficient biomass for
DNA extraction [11]. Spore production may be further
complicated when dealing with exotic isolates, which
involve the mandatory use of expensive, time-consuming
and wholly-contained facilities. In addition, using a given
set of susceptible varieties to increase the spores of exotic
isolates may give rise to bias. We had previously observed
very low levels of infection or even resistance reactions in
previously considered fully susceptible varieties such as cv.
Victo [12], Michigan Amber and Cartago when inoculated
with Pakistani isolates. This can result in the loss of isolates having avirulence factors recognized by unknown
resistance genes in varieties used to increase spores. One
alternative is to extract DNA from one or few spores, and
then increase it through a whole genome multiple displacement amplification [11] before performing genotyping.
However, the sophistication required for this method, as

well as the need to prevent any contamination from other
organisms, limits its use. We therefore tested here a third
procedure, i.e. the direct extraction of fungal and plant
DNA from single spore-infected leaf.
Another issue was the availability of a set of molecular
markers sufficient to describe the population structure of
a pathogen. The use of microsatellites/simple sequence
repeat (SSR) markers with co-dominance and high polymorphism is of considerable value to the study of dikaryotic fungi such as PST [13]. When SSR detection and
allele sizing are performed using an automated DNA
fragment analyzer based on the separation of fluorescently-labeled amplicons, accurate and efficient genotyping can be achieved [14]. A good way to further enhance
the efficiency of SSR genotyping is to multiplex SSR
amplifications. Multiplex PCR refers to the simultaneous
amplification of several markers in a single reaction,
thereby saving the time and money required to manage
each PCR reaction separately [15]. This method has been
reported as achieving the same specificity as single conventional PCR reactions [14]. We report here a protocol
that enabled the amplification of a set of highly informative SSR markers for PST studies, by means of three multiplex PCR reactions for PST.

Findings
Improvements to PST DNA extraction

To extract DNA from infected leaves, we selected both
sporulating leaves from the first cycle of spore multiplication and leaves sampled in the field with single sporulating
lesion, i.e. infections presumably resulting from a single
spore infection. A Qiagen DNeasy ® plant mini DNA
extraction kit protocol was used to extract DNA from the
sample. The infected leaves were put in 1.5 μL Eppendorf
tubes containing 70 μL lysis (AP-1) solution (65°C) and
one tungsten bead, and then ground for 3 min at 30 rps
with a Retsch-MM300 grinder. An additional 70 μL of
lysis (AP-1) solution was added and the liquid material
was transferred into special tubes for extraction using the
Qiagen DNA ‘Biorobot 3000’ extraction robot. Further
details regarding the protocol are available in the manual
(available at http://www.qiagen.com). The DNA thus
extracted was then quantified on Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and stored at -20°C until
further use for molecular genotyping. The quantity of
DNA was within the range 2 ng μL-1 to 6 ng μL-1, depending on the size of the leaf lesion. It is essential to remember that these extracts were containing the DNA of both
the plant and the fungus. Three PCR multiplex reactions
(targeting 20 SSRs, see below) were used to determine
whether the PST DNA was of sufficiently good quality for
genotyping. The gel pictures for the three multiplexes run
with DNA extracted from both the spores and the infected
leaves are shown in Figure 1. Although the DNA

Page 2 of 5

extractions from infected leaves produced smaller quantities of PCR-amplicons, the amplifications were always sufficient to produce unambiguous signals for all loci when
run on a sequencer. To have an idea about the relative
amount of PST DNA in wheat DNA, we made a dilution
of DNA extracted from PST infected lesion and DNA
extracted from pure PST spores. In case of infected leaf
extracted DNA, a dilution of two times resulted in no or
very weak amplifications, while for DNA extracted from
PST spores, a dilution of 20 times was necessary to reach
to the lowest concentrations for PCR amplification. This
indicates that the infected leaf DNA contains 1/5 of fungal
DNA and 4/5 of leaf DNA. Thus at least 3 μL of the
infected leaf extracted DNA must be taken to have enough
PCR amplification. Further dilution will reduce the amplification to be able to read the alleles unambiguously.
Extraction made from infected leaves of different ages, different varieties or with different infection times gave equal
amplification. However, the quantity of the infection lesion
is important. An infection lesion of at least 2 cm long
must be used to have enough quantity of pathogen spores
and hyphae for DNA extraction and subsequent amplification. Indeed, the amplification of DNA extracted from
non-infected leaves from two wheat varieties (Michigan
Amber and Sogood) did not achieve any amplification
(Figure 1). The extractions from infected leaves were first
validated in four different isolates (two from France and
two from Pakistan), for which SSR typing was strictly identical to the genotypes obtained from the DNA extracted
from spores (data not shown). This technique was then
applied to a set of more than 100 isolates sampled in Pakistan in 2010 which displayed little or no spore production
during multiplication. The SSR amplification was highly
efficient, while allelic patterns were matching those of isolates sampled at the same location but genotyped after
DNA extraction from spores (data not shown). This technique could also be used for single sporulating lesion
infected leaves sampled in the field as such an infection
normally results from a single spore and has the same genotype. However, in the case of leaves infected with several
sporulating lesions, they need to be cloned to obtain single
spore lesions that can then be used in the same manner as
discussed above. In both cases however, at least half of the
sporulating lesions must be preserved in order to retrieve
the isolate if it is required in the future. One option would
be to isolate samples through mono-chlorosis isolation or
single spore inoculation, and then use the infected leaf for
DNA extraction while at the same time retrieving the
spores for future pathotyping and other biological/epidemiological studies. This direct use of infected leaves for
DNA extraction is applicable for any wheat pathogen
while considering the purity of races per lesion, eliminating the costly and critical step of exotic isolate multiplication in full confinement.

Development of an efficient and multiplexed set of SSR
for the PST population study

Another aim of this study was to obtain a reliable combination of different SSR markers that could be amplified
during a small number of PCR reactions, rather than a
separate PCR amplification for each SSR. We benefited
from a total set of 22 previously developed SSRs [13,16]
and a set of 13 SSRs sequences kindly provided by Dr. X.
Chen (Washington State University, Pullman, USA), out
of which only nine were amplified and two were

polymorphic. Amplifications were performed first of all on
each individual SSR and they were then combined in three
multiplexes as a function of their allele sizes. Based on
their polymorphism (assessed using a set of eight isolates
representing different genetic groups of global PST populations) and after selection for a successful amplification in
multiplex PCR reactions, a total of 20 SSRs were chosen.
For each SSR locus, the forward primer was labelled with
black, green or blue florescent dyes, the red fluorescent
dye being reserved for the size marker (Figure 2). SSR loci

in the same or closed allele size range were then labelled
with different florescent dyes to achieve the maximum
possible number of loci per run of the sequencer. Table 1
provides details on the SSRs combined in each multiplex
PCR reaction.
The PCR reactions were performed using a QIAGEN
kit containing a single mix of Taq-polymerase, MgCl,
dNTPs and buffer, referred to as the Type-it microsatellite kit specially designed for Multiplex PCR reactions.
Each reaction contained 2 μL water, 1 μL Q-solution, 1
μL of the primer mix (containing 2 μM of each SSR primer), 5 μL of the Type-it mix and 1 μL (15 ng) of DNA.
The amount of DNA was increased to 3 μL and no
water was added for infected plant leaves, as the PST
DNA was diluted with plant DNA. An optimization step
was performed to identify the optimum melting temperature for all the SSRs in a given Multiplex. The optimum PCR conditions thus determined were the same
for all three multiplexes, with preheating at 95°C for
5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for
90 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension step at
60°C for 30 minutes, using an iCycler (Biorad) thermocycler. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel
to reveal the amplification products. The amounts of
PCR product added to 35 μL of the Sample Loading
Solution, containing 0.4 μL Beckman Coulter 400-bp
size standard, varied as follows:1.5 μL for Multiplex-1
and Multiplex-3 and 2.2 for Multiplex-2 in the case of
spore DNA; 3 μL for Multiplex-1 and Multiplex-2 and 4
μL for Multiplex-2 in the case of infected leaf DNA.

Amplicon fragments were separated using a Beckman
Coulter CEQ-8000 DNA Analyzer with the default
FRAG-3 run method. The fragments were read using
CEQ-8000 Genetic Analysis System Software (Beckman
Coulter) to record alleles manually for each locus
according to amplicon fragment lengths. All the alleles
were readable and there was no difference between
allele lengths whether the PCR was performed for each
SSR separately or in a multiplex reaction. Allele sizes
were within the range of previously reported alleles for
previously developed SSR markers [13,16], while for two
new SSRs, the allele sizes were within the range of 211213 bp for WU-6 and 325-334 bp for WU-12. The technique was then used to genotype more than a thousand
isolates representing the worldwide PST population and
we found no ambiguity in terms of allele reading,
together with an efficient discriminating power for this
set of SSRs. The data on these worldwide set of isolates
would be used to infer about the PST phylogeny and
evolutionary biology. The development of this multiplex-based amplification technique, together with the
reading of allele length through a sequencer, achieved
gains in time and accuracy, as well as regarding the
reproducibility of the results.

Conclusions
The extraction of DNA from infected leaves, together
with a Multiplex-based PCR reaction and the reading of
fluorescently labeled alleles through a sequencer thus
provides a ready-to-use method for the efficient

genotyping of PST, and enables clear gains in terms of
time, money, reproducibility and accuracy. Because of
the high level of polymorphism of the SSR markers
selected, the proposed SSR set could also constitute a
genotyping reference at worldwide level, enabling the
rapid comparison of genetic analyses. Such easily comparable sets of markers constitute an essential tool for
molecular epidemiology and to trace emerging races in
a fungus that is known for its highly efficient long distance migration [17]. Furthermore, the genotyping of
large number of isolates from different geographical
regions coupled with recent population genetics analyses
would assist to address ancestral relationship between
different geographically spaced populations, describe the
ancient migration routes and the role of host and geography on pathogen population structuring. This will
help us to understand overall evolution of pathogens
and to consequently orientate disease management
strategies.
