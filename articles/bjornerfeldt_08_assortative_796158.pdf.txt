Abstract
Background: There are around 400 internationally recognized dog breeds in the world today,
with a remarkable diversity in size, shape, color and behavior. Breeds are considered to be uniform
groups with similar physical characteristics, shaped by selection rooted in human preferences. This
has led to a large genetic difference between breeds and a large extent of linkage disequilibrium
within breeds. These characteristics are important for association mapping of candidate genes for
diseases and therefore make dogs ideal models for gene mapping of human disorders. However,
genetic uniformity within breeds may not always be the case. We studied patterns of genetic
diversity within 164 poodles and compared it to 133 dogs from eight other breeds.
Results: Our analyses revealed strong population structure within poodles, with differences
among some poodle groups as pronounced as those among other well-recognized breeds. Pedigree
analysis going three generations back in time confirmed that subgroups within poodles result from
assortative mating imposed by breed standards as well as breeder preferences. Matings have not
taken place at random or within traditionally identified size classes in poodles. Instead, a novel set
of five poodle groups was identified, defined by combinations of size and color, which is not officially
recognized by the kennel clubs. Patterns of genetic diversity in other breeds suggest that assortative
mating leading to fragmentation may be a common feature within many dog breeds.
Conclusion: The genetic structure observed in poodles is the result of local mating patterns,
implying that breed fragmentation may be different in different countries. Such pronounced
structuring within dog breeds can increase the power of association mapping studies, but also
represents a serious problem if ignored.
In dog breeding, individuals are selected on the basis of morphology, behaviour, working or show
purposes, as well as geographic population structure. The same processes which have historically
created dog breeds are still ongoing, and create further subdivision within current dog breeds.

Background
The behavioral and morphological diversity present in

modern purebred dogs is remarkable. For at least 4,000–
5,000 years, dogs have existed in a variety of sizes and

shapes, but the majority of the currently recognized 400
breeds have only existed since around 1850 or later, when
dog shows became popular, Kennel Clubs were founded
and Stud Books were established [1,2]. In parallel to phenotypic selection, genetic differentiation between breeds
has increased and is today very large [3-5]. The reasons for
this high degree of genetic differentiation are the reproductive isolation among breeds, founder effects and bottlenecks experienced during the time of breed creation or
later, extreme selection and use of popular sires [3,6-11].
The isolation and small effective population size of modern breeds has resulted in widespread inbreeding and the
expression of a large number of genetic diseases. Many of
these are also among the most frequently occurring diseases in humans, such as cancer, heart problems, deafness, blindness and joint diseases [6,8,9,12-14]. The
genetic disorders in the dog often mimic human diseases
closely in physiology, disease presentation and clinical
response. More than 360 genetic diseases that are found in
humans have also been described in dogs, about 46%
occurring mainly in either one or a few breeds [8,10,15].
The fact that purebred dogs are separated into genetically
differentiated breeds and that they live in the same environment as humans, makes them an ideal model to map
genes for human disorders [5,8,13]. Another advantage is
that linkage disequilibrium (LD) in dog breeds extends
over 20–100 times longer genomic regions than in
humans, which means that a smaller number of markers
are required for genome-wide scans in dogs. This, together
with the low haplotype diversity within LD regions and
high degree of haplotype sharing among breeds
[9,10,14,16], facilitates the identification of chromosomal regions where candidate genes are located.
Association mapping of phenotypic traits or diseases is a
population-based approach (instead of pedigree-based)
and depends highly on the level of LD [14], which in dogs
is related to the genetic uniformity of breeds. Dogs are
today divided into different breeds based mainly on morphological appearance and/or behavior. Breeds are
defined as "intraspecies groups that have relatively uniform physical characteristics developed under controlled
conditions by man [4]." However, homogeneity within
breeds may not always be the case. For example, the official standards for many breeds allow a number of color
types and patterns, while other combinations are unacceptable [17]. Variation in size can lead to the identification of different types within a breed. Additionally,
breeders are increasingly interested in specializing in
either dogs for show, or dogs for working purposes or as
pets. These divergent selective forces within breeds are a
form of disruptive selection: extreme forms are favored
while intermediate forms are selected against [18]. Since
human preferences play the same role of assortative mat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/28

ing in keeping the breeding lines separate, these are likely
to lead to the formation of genetically separated groups,
thus violating the assumption of uniformity within
breeds.
One example of this breed fragmentation is the case of the
poodle. According to the World Canine Organization, FCI
(Fédération Cynologique Internationale) [19], poodles
are grouped in four different sizes: standard (45–60 cm,
withers height), medium sized (35–45 cm), miniature
(28–35 cm) and toy (< 28 cm). At the same time, five uniform colors are allowed: black, brown, white, silver and
apricot [19]. Despite the different sizes and colors, all
poodles are currently recognized as a single breed. Disruptive selection for very specific phenotypes and assortative
mating might have led to fragmentation, and to genetically differentiated types within this breed. In this study
we used purebred poodles from Sweden as an example to
study how genetic diversity at 27 microsatellite loci is partitioned within a single dog breed, and then compare this
pattern to variation within and among eight other purebred dog breeds. This knowledge can contribute to a better understanding of the history and relationship between
breeds, exemplifies the genetic diversification of populations as a result of disruptive selection, and it is also vital
to the design of optimal search strategies for association
mapping of diseases or phenotypic traits [9,20].

Results
The study of 164 Swedish poodles revealed an average of
4.4 alleles per locus, a significant (p < 0.05) heterozygote
deficit across all 27 markers (HE = 0.64, HO = 0.56), and
positive inbreeding coefficient (FIS = 0.133). This heterozygote deficit was consistently found in 20 of 27 markers,
indicating that the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium affects the whole genome rather than being a
local, locus-specific phenomenon such as selection or
genotyping problems (e.g. allelic dropout). Heterozygote
deficit could indicate a preferential mating with relatives
within poodles, or the presence of population structure
within the breed (Wahlund effect) [21].
To assess whether the heterozygote deficit was due to the
fragmentation of poodles into the four discrete size classes
acknowledged by FCI, we measured the degree of population differentiation using FST [22] (Table 1). Standard
poodles were very well separated from the smaller poodles, with pairwise FST values in the range of 0.184 to
0.234 (p < 0.01 in all cases), which suggests very limited
genetic exchange between them. On the other hand, the
differentiation between the three smaller size classes
(medium sized, miniature and toy) is much lower, with
FST values at least 6.8 times smaller than the smallest value
observed between any of them and standard poodles.
Among them, miniature and toy poodles were indistin-

ues. Larger K values failed to separate the other sizes (Figure 1A).

We used the program STRUCTURE to identify the groups
into which poodles are divided. We determined the
number of existing clusters in two ways, by considering
the log 'probability of data' lnP(D) for different numbers
of K, and by using the statistic ∆K [23], which considers
the rate of change in lnP(D) among successive K values.
The latter approach indicated that the optimal number of
groups was K = 2. However, lnP(D) continued to increase
with increasing K until K = 5, and thereafter lnP(D)
decreased. At K = 2, standard poodles appeared separated
from the smaller poodles (medium sized, miniature and
toy), and they remained separated with increasing K val-

To corroborate that the genetic differentiation observed
between the poodle size classes is inversely related to the
current gene flow between them, we examined pedigree
information from the Swedish Kennel Club [24]. We
recorded the size registered for the parents, grandparents
and great-grandparents for all 164 poodles studied. The
pedigree information indicated that the gene flow estimates between the different poodle size classes are almost
identical considering parents, grandparents (data not
shown) or great-grandparents, suggesting that the patterns
of gene exchange have remained relatively constant over
recent times (Figure 2). The pedigree information con-

firms the complete isolation of standard poodles (100%
of the parents, grandparents and great-grandparents were
standard poodles). Similarly, about 87% of the ancestors
of the medium sized poodles belonged to the medium
size size-class, while the corresponding proportions were
only around 63% for miniature and around 36% for toy.
The genetic exchange between the two smallest sizes thus
appeared to be very large and 52–61% of the ancestors
(based on the number of parents and great-grandparents,
Figure 2) of toy were in fact miniature poodles. The patterns of genetic exchange suggested by the pedigree closely
parallel the genetic differentiation between the size classes
(Table 1), as confirmed by a Mantel correlation test (Z =
0.650, p = 0.039).
Since the analysis with STRUCTURE suggested that the
likelihood of the clustering within poodles was highest
with K = 5, we examined more closely the characteristics
for each dog available at the registry. This revealed that the
five groups at K = 5 could be clearly defined by a combination of size and coat-color. Multiple runs of the program consistently provided the same results. After
rearranging the results of STRUCTURE shown in Figure 1A
according to size and color criteria, the division between
groups could be seen more clearly (Figure 1B). As indicated above, at K = 2, the first group to separate from the
rest corresponds to the standard poodles. At K = 3, a new
group is formed within the smaller size classes of poodles
by separating individuals with black and brown coat
colors from those with the other three colors (silver, white

and apricot). At K = 4 the group of black and brown small
sized poodles is further subdivided and medium sized
form a separate group from miniature and toy. Finally, at
K = 5 the group containing the small (medium sized, miniature and toy) poodles of pale colors, is separated into
two groups: one containing silver (grey) and white dogs
and the other dogs with apricot color. Consequently, our
results indicate that the genetic diversity within poodles is
clearly separated into two groups which differ by size
(standard versus smaller poodles) and that actually five
separate clusters can be discerned based on a combination
of color and size. Using FST to measure the degree of differentiation between the five groups (Table 2) confirms
that standard poodles are very different from the three
smaller-bodied groups of poodles (pairwise FST = 0.197 to
0.265). However, the differentiation among the four
groups of smaller poodles, defined on the basis of color
and size, is about four times larger than the largest difference observed between the size classes for the three smallsized poodles, reaching FST values of up to 0.120 (Table
1).
A reanalysis of the pedigree information revealed that the
clusters shown by the STRUCTURE analysis matched better the breeding practices for poodles. For each one of the
five groups defined, more than 80% of the parents and
great-grandparents originated from the same group (data
not shown), as compared to the much lower values for the
size classes (just 35% for toy poodles, Figure 2). Our analysis of pedigree and phenotype data thus confirmed that
the genetic clusters identified within poodles are the result
of specific breeding preferences of dog owners, and not
just originating from mating related dogs. To our knowledge, these groups have not been identified or suggested
before, thus our genetic analysis revealed hidden population substructure within poodles.
These five groups of poodles were also genetically compared to 133 dogs from eight other breeds (Table 2).
Standard poodles were as differentiated from smaller poodles as different breeds are from each other (pairwise FST =
0.150–0.517). For instance, the pairwise FST value
between standard poodles and black and brown medium
sized poodles was 0.265, larger than 40% of the comparisons between the five groups of poodles and the other 8
breeds included in this study. For example, the FST value
between giant schnauzer and small white and silver poodles is just 0.170. A neighbor-joining analysis (Figure 3)
based on another measure of genetic differentiation, Nei's
[25] standard genetic distance (DS), shows standard poodles at the end of a long branch, indicating genetic
uniqueness and separation from all other poodles.
One possible explanation for the large difference between
standard and small sized poodles could be a past bottle-

neck that reduced the diversity in the first compared to the
latter. This bottleneck could translate into a strong differentiation by founder effects and drift. However, this does
not seem to be the main reason for their uniqueness,
because their allelic richness was similar to that observed
in other groups of poodles after correcting for differences
in sample size (Table 3).

Poodles could represent a unique case among dogs if they
developed from the mixing of separate dog lineages. If this
was the case, we would expect to find a larger genetic
diversity in poodles than that observed in other breeds
and, more importantly, a larger inbreeding coefficient FIS
due to population fragmentation (Wahlund effect; [21]).
When considering all poodles as members of a single
group, they show high genetic diversity (HE, Table 3) and
a large inbreeding coefficient FIS, further evidenced by a
significant heterozygote deficit. However, several other
dog breeds also had high levels of microsatellite diversity
HE (i.e., Siberian husky), FIS values as large as those in
poodles (i.e., German shepherd) or significant heterozygote deficits (6 different breeds, see Table 3). Although the
allelic richness corrected for sample size was larger when
all poodles were considered as one single group, the differences compared to the other breeds were small (Table
3). It could be argued that differences in genetic diversity
between breeds are the result of differences in population
size. However, this does not seem to be the case. Genetic
diversity (bootstrapped allelic richness, Table 3) was not
correlated to breed population size as inferred by the
number of registries at the Swedish Kennel Club during
2005 (r = 0.207, p = 0.592, data not shown). Similarly, the
inbreeding coefficient FIS was not correlated with breed
population size either (r = 0.217, p = 0.576). Since genetic
diversity and inbreeding coefficient are not related to population size, the large differences in diversity and positive
inbreeding coefficient in some breeds could be indicative
of some degree of genetic fragmentation within these
breeds, similar to that observed in poodles.

Discussion
In order to compare the uniqueness of the five poodle
groups in relation to the differentiation between recognized dog breeds we conducted assignment tests. If breeds
(and groups within poodles) are well differentiated, most
of the individuals should be correctly assigned to their
nominal group. In a first test we divided all poodles into
two groups (standard poodles and smaller sizes, as suggested by STRUCTURE for K = 2), and compared them to
dogs from 8 other breeds. Only 2 out of 297 dogs were
incorrectly assigned and none of these mis-assignments
corresponded to poodles. This indicates that established
dog breeds are well-isolated populations with unique
microsatellite allele frequencies (as previously shown by
Refs. [1,3,4]), and that a similar degree of differentiation
exists between standard poodles and the group of small
sized poodles. A second assignment test was made examining only the four coat-color/size groups of small poo-

About 400 dog breeds exist today. All of these breeds are
characterized by unique morphology, characteristic
behavior and often also by a suite of genetic diseases. The
morphological differences between breeds are so large
that they easily exceed the differentiation between all species in the Family Canidae [26,27], and probably no other
vertebrate has comparable phenotypic diversity. Our
results suggest that currently the number of genetically
differentiated groups of purebred dogs might be even
larger than the number of breeds: some breeds, such as the
poodle, are likely to encompass multiple genetically
divergent subgroups. Selection patterns within breeds
might lead to an increase in the number of genetically differentiated dog breeds.
Poodles represent a breed encompassing apparent phenotypic diversity, which translates in the identification of

four classes with regard to body size. However, our analyses revealed that this is not the only reason for the poodle
intra-breed structure. Only a limited set of coat colors are
accepted in purebred poodles, as for most modern breeds,
and coats are required to be uniform [17,19]. Since other
colors and coat patterns are not acceptable in registered
purebred poodles, this results in disruptive selection by
which some extreme combinations are favored while
intermediate types are rejected. As a consequence of this,
the genetic diversity of poodles is fragmented into five distinct groups defined by a combination of size and color
(Figure 1B). One of the groups, standard poodles, appears
as different from the other poodle groups as recognized
dog breeds are different from each other (Table 2). This
result emphasizes how strong the intra-breed differentiation can be.
Historically, standard poodles were used as working dogs,
while the three smaller poodle classes were mostly bred
for company. Standard poodles have been bred separately
from the smaller sizes for more than 100 years in Europe
(Barbro Teglöf, responsible for the breeding committee of
the Swedish Poodle Club, personal communication). In
the US, however, some degree of interbreeding among the
recognized poodle size classes occurs. This could result in
different patterns of differentiation in American poodles.
Our results show a strong differentiation between standard poodles and the smaller sizes (Figure 3, Table 2). Due
to these different breeding practices, it is possible that

standard poodles are not as differentiated from small
sized poodles in the US as they are in Europe. This study
is based on poodles born in Sweden; population structure
in other countries may be similarly affected by local regulations and breeding practices.
The long isolation between standard poodles and the
smaller sizes in Europe has resulted in a differentiation as
pronounced as that between well defined breeds. Founder
effects and subsequent bottlenecks during the history of
breeds, together with highly selective breeding practices
[9,11], have led to the differentiation between breeds and
probably have also led to the strong separation between
standard poodles and the group of small sized poodles.
This process results in a rapid random genetic drift and
unique allele frequencies. Consequently, attempts to
reconstruct the relationship between breeds based on
their allelic composition [3-5,28,29] are likely to have
been heavily influenced by such random effects (Figure 3)
and may not necessarily reflect true breed history. For
example, our results suggest that, for neutral genetic markers, standard poodles are as differentiated from black and
brown medium sized poodles as from giant schnauzers or
Siberian huskies (Table 2). This indicates that genetic distance based on neutral allelic frequencies might actually
be a poor indicator of breed relatedness.
The four groups within the small sized poodles show
lower levels of differentiation, below the values com-

monly observed between the other breeds or between
them and standard poodles (Figure 1B, Table 2). Nevertheless, our results confirm that these dogs do not constitute a panmictic breeding population where all
individuals randomly breed to each other. The situation
observed in this study for the poodles, intra-breed structure, may be present in other breeds as well, as suggested
by the large inbreeding coefficient in some of the breeds
(Table 3), consistent with population fragmentation [30].
Similarly, Schelling, Gaillard and Dolf [29] observed that
while longhaired and smooth dachshunds were genetically similar, wirehaired dachshunds clustered separately
in a phylogenetic tree. For some breeds such as German
shepherds, Siberian huskies and Labrador retrievers, two
different lines of selection are maintained within the
breed, separating animals intended for competition in
dog shows for their appearance, and animals selected for
work. In these cases the morphology of the two types is
becoming more and more divergent over time, which will
likely result in an intra-breed population structure comparable to that observed in poodles. The existence of separated lines of selective breeding within the same breed is
likely to lead to the establishment of distinct genetic clusters within recognized dog breeds. Thus, an ongoing process of selective breeding is leading to a progressive
increase in the number of dog breeds, and this increase
will continue as long as the popularity of purebred dogs
and dog shows continues.

Conclusion
The partitioning of genetic diversity into discrete classes
(breeds) has made the dog an exceptional model for the
study of the association between genotype and phenotype
and for the identification of genes involved in phenotypic
and behavioral traits or diseases [8,10,14,15,20]. However, the use of dogs as a model is determined by the uniformity within breeds. Our results suggest that genetically
divergent groups of dogs can exist within the same breed.
The implications of this for association mapping studies
are two-fold. First, the number of genetically identifiable
breeds may be even larger than suspected (about 400),
increasing the value of dogs as a model organism for association studies. Since these genetically differentiated
groups are likely to include only a small part of the haplotype diversity attributed to the breed and to represent
more inbred lines, LD is expected to be larger [14]. This
would facilitate the identification of markers linked to the
trait under study. Second, this intra-breed structure violates the assumption of uniformity within breeds. Such
cryptic (unrecognized by the official kennel clubs' policies) population structure, if ignored, is likely to confound association studies. Association studies should
target genetically homogeneous groups within breeds,
which may often be phenotypically and/or behaviorally
separated.

Assortative mating is leading to the creation of strong population structure within dog breeds and has contributed
to the extreme plasticity of dogs and domestic animals
under selection. Domestic animals are invaluable models
to understand evolution, and in the same way that they
were a major source of inspiration for Darwin [31], they
continue to help us understand the origin of biodiversity.

Methods
Samples
Buccal swabs were taken from 297 purebred dogs registered by the Swedish Kennel Club (SKK) [24]. Of these
samples, 164 corresponded to poodles (41 of each size:
standard, medium sized, miniature and toy). The sampling also included bull terriers (n = 18), fox terriers
(smooth) (n = 18), fox terriers (wire) (n = 18), German
shepherds (n = 16), giant schnauzers (n = 17), miniature
schnauzers (n = 14), Labrador retrievers (n = 16) and Siberian huskies (n = 16). Samples were collected at a dog
show in December 2004, and by direct correspondence
with dog owners during 2005. The registration numbers
in the Swedish Kennel Club were recorded for all individuals to avoid sampling dogs that share any parent. For the
poodles the registration numbers were also used to track
the size and color of the ancestors (parents, grandparents
and great-grandparents, although, to simplify, we do not
show data for grandparents in this paper). The buccal cells
were taken using nylon bristle cytology brushes (Medical
Packaging Corp, Camarillo, CA) by brushing the inside of
the dog's cheek for at least 20 seconds. The brush with the
sample was immediately put into a tube with 1 ml Laird's
buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 7 mM
SDS, adjusted to pH 8.5). As soon as the samples arrived
at the laboratory they were kept at -20°C until processing.
Laboratory methods
Genomic DNA was extracted from 400 µl of the buffer
containing the cytology brush with the sample, by digestion with 0.3 mg of proteinase K. The samples were then
incubated over-night at 37°C and DNA was extracted
using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol [32].

Twenty-eight biparentally inherited autosomal microsatellites, distributed across the canine genome, were typed
for all dogs: Ren94K11 (mapped to canine chromosome
CFA12), C17.402 (CFA17), Ren239K24 (CFA29),
C18.460 (CFA18), Ren274F18 (CFA19), Ren181K04

PEZ12 (CFA03) [39]. The microsatellites were amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplifications
for each sample were done in 14 reactions of 10 µl each,
which included 12 multiplexes of two or three loci, and
two loci amplified separately (PEZ05 and PEZ12). The
PCR mix included 1x HotStar buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany), 0.25 mM dNTP, 0.32 µM of each primer, 3.0
mM MgCl2, 0.025x Q solution, 0.45U HotStarTaq and 2
µl DNA template. The PCR profile included an initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 15 minutes followed by 10
touchdown cycles (30 s of denaturation at 95°C, 30 s
annealing starting at 58°C and decreasing 0.5°C each
cycle, followed by extension at 72°C for 45 s), followed
by 20 additional cycles (denaturation at 95°C for 30 s,
annealing at 53°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 45
s), and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min in a PTC0225 DNA Engine Tetrad (Bio-Rad). PCR products were
pooled in seven different pools and genotyped on a MegaBACE 1000™ instrument (Amersham Biosciences). Genotypes were identified using the software Genetic Profiler
v2.2 (Amersham Biosciences).
Data analysis
For each microsatellite marker and breed, a test for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium frequencies was
performed using GENEPOP on the Web 3.1c [40]. A
locus-by-locus analysis of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium frequencies indicated that one marker
(Ren181K04) showed a heterozygote deficiency for all
breeds and groups of poodles, suggesting presence of null
alleles, genotyping errors or tight physical linkage to a
selected trait. This marker was excluded from all analyses.

We used the program Microsatellite Toolkit 3.1 [41] to
calculate expected and observed heterozygosity (HE and
HO) [42] for each breed and groups within poodles. Since
sample size was different for each breed, we also used a
bootstrapping procedure (as in Hailer et al.) [43] to compare levels of genetic diversity after correcting for sample
size: 14 individuals (corresponding to the sample size for
miniature schnauzer, for which the number of individuals
studied was smallest) were randomly sampled 100 times
with replacement from each original population sample,
and the average number of alleles per locus was calculated
across these 100 replicates. FIS values for each locus and
across loci were calculated using FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [44].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/28

strap pseudoreplicates across loci. For poodles, FST values
were compared to gene flow estimates based on three generations of pedigree information using a Mantel test [47].
The pedigree-based matrix was calculated as 1-(average
gene flow between groups); where the average gene flow
between groups had been estimated from the great-grandparents of each individual dog (see Results, Figure 2); values of zero were assigned to the diagonal.
An additional estimate of the degree of differentiation
between breeds (or between groups of individuals within
poodles) was the proportion of self-assignment. The
assignment program Doh [48] was used to evaluate if the
individual genotypes allow correct assignment of each
individual dog to its breed. The program uses the individual's genotype and determines the likelihood of finding
that genotype within each breed. The individual is
assigned to the breed for which it has the highest probability.
All the breed comparisons listed above involve groups of
individuals defined a priori as belonging to one breed or
another. We used the software STRUCTURE 2.1 [49,50]
without population information, to form groups of poodles solely based on their genetic composition. This
approach allowed us to identify how the genetic diversity
is partitioned within poodles. We subdivided these dogs
into an increasing number of populations (K = 1–10 with
a burn-in length of 100,000 and a run length of
1,000,000) and performed five independent runs per K
value to ensure that the results were consistent. The program was run allowing animals to have mixed ancestry
and correlated allele frequencies. We compared the likelihood estimate for each one of the K values essayed in
order to decide the number of subpopulations present
within poodles. In subsequent comparisons we divided
the poodles in the groups suggested by the program
STRUCTURE and each group was treated as a separate
subgroup and subjected to the analyses described above.
