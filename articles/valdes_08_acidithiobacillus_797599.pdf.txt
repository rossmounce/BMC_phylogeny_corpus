Abstract
Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a major participant in consortia of microorganisms
used for the industrial recovery of copper (bioleaching or biomining). It is a chemolithoautrophic,
γ-proteobacterium using energy from the oxidation of iron- and sulfur-containing minerals for
growth. It thrives at extremely low pH (pH 1–2) and fixes both carbon and nitrogen from the
atmosphere. It solubilizes copper and other metals from rocks and plays an important role in
nutrient and metal biogeochemical cycling in acid environments. The lack of a well-developed
system for genetic manipulation has prevented thorough exploration of its physiology. Also,
confusion has been caused by prior metabolic models constructed based upon the examination of
multiple, and sometimes distantly related, strains of the microorganism.
Results: The genome of the type strain A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was sequenced and annotated
to identify general features and provide a framework for in silico metabolic reconstruction. Earlier
models of iron and sulfur oxidation, biofilm formation, quorum sensing, inorganic ion uptake, and
amino acid metabolism are confirmed and extended. Initial models are presented for central carbon
metabolism, anaerobic metabolism (including sulfur reduction, hydrogen metabolism and nitrogen
fixation), stress responses, DNA repair, and metal and toxic compound fluxes.
Conclusion: Bioinformatics analysis provides a valuable platform for gene discovery and functional
prediction that helps explain the activity of A. ferrooxidans in industrial bioleaching and its role as a
primary producer in acidic environments. An analysis of the genome of the type strain provides a
coherent view of its gene content and metabolic potential.

Background

Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a Gram-negative, γ-proteobacterium that thrives optimally at 30°C and pH 2, but
can grow at pH 1 or lower [1]. It is abundant in natural
environments associated with pyritic ore bodies, coal
deposits, and their acidified drainages [2,3]. It is an
important member of microbial consortia used to recover
copper via a process known as bioleaching or biomining
[4].
In a typical bioleaching operation, copper ore is first pulverized and placed in heaps. The heaps are then sprinkled
with sulfuric acid and aerated to promote the microbial
oxidation of iron and sulfur compounds. Some bioleaching heaps are very extensive; for example, the Escondida
mine in northern Chile is putting into operation a heap
that is 5 km long by 2 km wide and 126 m high (David
Dew, personal communication). With a volume of a little
more than one trillion (1012) liters, this bioleaching heap
is arguably the world's largest industrial bioreactor.
Bioleaching of copper ores is a two-step process: first, the
biological oxidation of Fe(II) to produce Fe(III); second,
the chemical oxidation of Cu(I) to the more soluble
Cu(II) by Fe(III) which is reduced to Fe(II) in the process.
A. ferrooxidans plays a key role by reoxidizing the Fe(II) to
Fe(III), thus completing the cycle and allowing bioleaching to continue (Figure 1). The sulfuric acid produced by
the biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds
also promotes the solubilization of the Cu(II). Copper is
recovered from this acidic solution using physico-chemical technologies such as solvent extraction and electroplating.
Bioleaching accounts for 10% of the copper production
worldwide and is especially important as a technology for
ores with a low percentage of copper that are otherwise
uneconomical to extract. Another attractive feature of
bioleaching is that it does not produce pollutants such as
sulfur dioxide and arsenic that result from smelting. However, bioleaching does generate acid mine drainage that
must be managed to prevent its release into the environment. The importance of bioleaching is likely to increase
in the future as the mineral industry exploits ore deposits
with lower copper content as richer ores become depleted.
The increasing importance of bioleaching as a biotechnological process is stimulating increasing interest in the
biology of A. ferrooxidans and associated bioleaching
microorganisms.
A. ferrooxidans is one of the few microorganisms known to
gain energy by the oxidation of ferrous iron in acidic environments, using the low pH of its natural environment to
generate reverse electron flow from Fe(II) to NADH [5-8].
It can also obtain energy by the oxidation of reduced sul-

fur compounds, hydrogen, and formate [9,10]. The
microorganism makes an important contribution to the
biogeochemical cycling of metals in the environment and
has the potential to assist in the remediation of metal contaminated sites by its ability to oxidize and reduce metals.
Ferric iron and sulfuric acid are major by-products of its
energy-transducing processes, and these chemicals can
mobilize metals in the environment including toxic metals such as arsenic [11]. It can also reduce ferric ion and
elemental sulfur, thus promoting the recycling of iron and
sulfur compounds under anaerobic conditions [12,13].
Since the microorganism can also fix CO2 and nitrogen, it
is thought to be a primary producer of carbon and nitrogen in acidic, nutrient-poor environments [14-17].
The study of A. ferrooxidans offers exceptional opportunities to probe life in extremely acidic environments. It may
also offer insights into ancient ways of life in Archaean,
euxinic, acidic seas [18] and suggest potential biomarkers
to be used when searching for evidence of extra-terrestrial
life [19]. One of its unusual properties is its ability to aerobically oxidize solid substrates such as pyrite (FeS2).
Since the substrate cannot enter the cell, initial electron
removal must take place either within the outer cell membrane or completely outside the cell. Although a substantial body of information exists regarding the use of solid
minerals as electron sinks for biological processes (e.g.,
the reduction of ferric iron [20]), considerably less is
known about how microorganisms recognize, attach to,
and extract electrons from solid substrates. Investigations
into the fundamental interactions between bacteria and
mineral surfaces are critical for understanding the intricacies of interfacial biochemistry, biofilm formation, bacterial recognition of mineral surfaces, and the dispersal of
microorganisms in the environment.
A. ferrooxidans thrives in mineral rich, acid environments
where the concentration of dissolved ferrous iron can be
as high as 10-1 M, about 1016 times that found in circumneutral environments. The abundance of soluble iron has
the potential to pose severe oxidative stress that could lead
to DNA and protein damage via the Fenton reaction. This
prompts questions as to the mechanisms that A. ferrooxidans employs for iron assimilation and homeostasis
[21,22] and how it balances its use of iron as both a
micronutrient and as a required energy source. In its natural environment, it must also confront unusually severe
toxicity due to the high concentration of dissolved metals
(e.g., copper, arsenic, mercury).
Although the internal pH of A. ferrooxidans is about pH
6.5, proteins that are either wholly or partially outside the
inner membrane must function at pH 1–2, raising fundamental questions regarding how they fold and make protein-protein contact when confronted with such an

extremely high proton concentration. It also raises questions as to how proton-driven membrane transport and
energy processes function in the face of a proton motif
force (pmf) across the inner membrane that is several
orders of magnitude higher than typically found in neutrophilic environments.
Unfortunately, the lack of a well-developed system for
genetic manipulation has prevented thorough exploration
of the molecular biology and physiology of A. ferrooxidans. A bioinformatics-based analysis of its genome offers
a powerful tool for investigating its metabolism. However, many of the earlier investigations of its genetics and
metabolism were carried out on a variety of strains, some
of which may be only distantly (or not at all) related to A.
ferrooxidans. This allows the possibility that some experimental results, including enzyme identifications were not
reliable indicators of the metabolism of the species.
Genomic analysis of the type strain of A. ferrooxidans can
provide a more coherent view of the gene content and
metabolic potential of the species.
An analysis of amino acid metabolism based on the draft
genome sequence of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was previously reported [23]. Here we present a complete,
genome-based blueprint of the metabolic and regulatory
capabilities of A. ferrooxidans and relate these findings to
its unique lifestyle. This analysis will add to our understanding of the biochemical pathways that underpin the
biogeochemical processes, metabolic functions, and evolution of microbial communities in acidic environments.
This information also advances our understanding of the
role of A. ferrooxidans in industrial bioleaching.

synthesis of most amino acids, although ten genes were
missing [23]. Seven of these missing assignments have
now been detected: a potential 6-phosphofructokinase in
the glycolysis pathway (EC 2.7.1.11; AFE1807), pyruvate
dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1; AFE3068-70); shikimate
kinase in the chorismate synthesis pathway and required
for tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis
(EC 2.7.1.71; AFE0734); homeserine kinase in the threonine biosynthesis pathway (EC 2.7.1.39; AFE3097); Nacetyl-gamma-glutamil-1-phosphate reductase in the
ornithine biosynthesis pathway and required for proline
biosynthesis (EC 1.2.1.38; AFE3073); pirroline-5-carboxilate reductase involved in proline biosynthesis (EC
1.5.1.2; AFE0262); and asparagine synthase (EC 6.3.5.4:
AFE1353). The three genes identified in E. coli which have
not been found in A. ferrooxidans encode ornithine cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.12) involved in proline biosynthesis, aromatic-amino-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57), and
arogenate dehydrogenase involved in tyrosine biosynthesis (EC 1.3.1.43).
A. ferrooxidans has two glutamyl-tRNA synthetases: a more
discriminating one (D-GluRS, AFE0422) that charges only
Glu-tRNA(Glu) and a less discriminating one (ND-GluRS,
AFE2222) that charges Glu-tRNA(Glu) and GlutRNA(Gln). The latter one is a required intermediate in
protein synthesis in many organisms [25]. An indirect regulation of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase by heme status suggests a potential metabolic connection between heme
requirements, nitrogen, and central carbon metabolism
[26].

1. Genomic properties
The genome of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (type strain)
consists of a single circular chromosome of 2,982,397 bp
with a G+C content of 58.77%. No plasmids were
detected in the type strain, although they occur in several
other strains of [24]. A total of 3217 protein-coding genes
(CDSs) were predicted, of which 2070 (64.3%) were
assigned a putative function (Table 1 and Figure 2). The
genome encodes two ribosomal operons and 78 tRNA
genes. A putative origin of replication (Figure 2) has been
identified from marginal GC skew variations in the
genome and by the localization of the dnaN and dnaA
genes (AFE0001 and AFE3309).

Bioinformatic analysis supports prior experimental evidence that A. ferrooxidans has a versatile aerobic metabolism, capable of providing energy and reducing power
requirements from inorganic compounds by the oxidation of Fe(II), reduced sulfur compounds, formate, and
hydrogen. In addition, gene function predictions suggest
that the microorganism is capable of anaerobic or microaerophilic growth using Fe(III) or elemental sulfur as
alternative electron acceptors [27]. Many of the predictions were experimentally validated in a piece-meal fashion in a number of diverse strains of A. ferrooxidans, some
of which may not belong to the same species [28]. Herein,
we describe a coherent view of the metabolic potential of
the type strain that will now allow a systematic appraisal
of the diversity of the metabolic capacity of the A. ferrooxidans pangenome.

2. Chemolithoautotrophy
A. ferrooxidans has a complete repertoire of genes required
for a free-living, chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, including those for CO2 fixation and nucleotide and cofactor
biosynthesis (Additional file 1). Analysis of an earlier
draft genome had predicted genes for the pathways for

2.1 CO2 fixation
A. ferrooxidans fixes CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle) using
energy and reducing power derived from the oxidation of
iron or sulfur [29]. Early studies showed a relationship
between the rate of iron and sulfur oxidation and the rate

of CO2 fixation in A. ferrooxidans (no strain designated)
[30]. Several enzymes of the Calvin cycle have been
described in A. ferrooxidans, including the key D-ribulose1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) [29].
Two structurally distinct forms of RuBisCO (I and II), with
different catalytic properties, are typically present in
autotrophs [31]. Genes encoding Form I (AFE3051-2)
have been cloned and characterized from A. ferrooxidans
[32,33]. Gene clusters potentially encoding a second copy
of Form I (AFE1690-1) and a copy of Form II (AFE2155)
were predicted and shown to be differentially expressed
depending on whether A. ferrooxidans was grown on ironor sulfur-containing medium. [34]. A gene predicted to
encode a novel Rubisco-like protein known as Form IV
[35] was recently identified in the genome (AFE0435) and
is suggested to be involved in stress response (EsparzaMantilla, personal communication) (Additional file 2).
The genomic organization of the three gene clusters
encoding the Rubisco type I and II enzymes in A. ferrooxidans is similar to that found in Hydrogenovibrio marinus
strain MH-110, an obligate chemolithoautotrophic,
hydrogen-oxidizing, marine bacterium. In H. marinus,
these three-gene clusters are regulated in response to CO2
concentration, suggesting the ability to adapt to environmental conditions with different levels of CO2 [36].

2.2 Energy metabolism
2.2.1 Aerobic Iron oxidation
Since ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is rapidly oxidized by atmospheric oxygen at neutral pH, iron exists primarily in the
oxidized form [Fe(III)] in aerobic environments. Therefore, ferrous iron is available for microbial oxidation principally in acidic environments where chemical oxidation
is slow and Fe(II) is soluble, in anoxic conditions such as
in marine sediments and at the interface between aerobic
and anaerobic atmospheres [37]. In anoxic conditions,
phototrophic bacteria can use light energy to couple the
oxidation of Fe(II) to reductive CO2 fixation. Although little is known about the mechanisms involved, this process
has been postulated to be an ancient form of metabolism
and to represent a transition step in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis [38,39].

The bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of A.
ferrooxidans has permitted the identification of the main
components of the electron transport chain involved in
iron and sulfur oxidation (Figure 3). Genes encoding iron
oxidation functions are organized in two transcriptional
units, the petI and rus operons. The petI operon (petC-1,
petB-1, petA-1, sdrA-1, and cycA-1; AFE3107-11) encode
the three subunits of the bc1 complex (PetCAB), a predicted short chain dehydrogenase (Sdr) of unknown function, and a cytochrome c4 that has been suggested to

receive electrons from rusticyanin and pass them to the bc1
complex [5]. The petI operon has been analyzed experimentally in A. ferrooxidans strain ATCC 19859 [5] and
recently in strain ATCC33020 [8].
The rus operon (cyc2, cyc1, hyp, coxB, coxA coxC, coxD, and
rus; AFE3146-53) encodes two c-type cytochromes (Cyc1
and Cyc2), components of the aa3-type cytochrome oxidase (CoxBACD), and rusticyanin, respectively [40]. Cyc2
has been shown to accept electrons directly from Fe(II)
and, given its location in the outer membrane, may carry
out the first step in Fe(II) oxidation [41]. These proteins
are thought to form a "respiratory supercomplex" that
spans the outer and the inner membranes and transfers
electrons from iron (or pyrite) to oxygen [40,42,43].
Based on transcriptional, biochemical, and genetic studies
[28], it was proposed that electrons from ferrous iron oxidation flow through Cyc2 to rusticyanin. From there,
some of the electrons feed the "downhill electron pathway" through c-cytochrome Cyc1 to aa3 cytochrome oxidase, some the "uphill electron pathway" that regenerates
the universal electron donor NADH by the reverse electron flow through c-cytochrome CycA1--> bc1 complex->ubiquinone pool-->NADH dehydrogenase (Figure 3a).
Genome analysis suggests a solution to a long-standing
controversy. A HiPIP (high potential iron-sulfur protein)
encoded by iro has been postulated to be the first electron
acceptor from Fe(II) [44,45]. However, transcriptional
studies of iro in A. ferrooxidans ATCC33020 suggested that
it may be involved in sulfur oxidation. In our analysis of
the type strain, iro (AFE2732) was found to be associated
with the petII gene cluster thought to be involved in sulfur
oxidation [46,47], thus making it unlikely that Iro is the
key iron-oxidizing enzyme.
2.2.2 Aerobic oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds
(RISCs)
Genes encoding enzymes and electron transfer proteins
predicted to be involved in the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) were detected in the
genome (Figure 3b). The oxidative and electron transfer
pathways for RISCs are more complicated than those for
Fe(II) oxidation, making their prediction and elucidation
more difficult [48]. To add further complication, some
steps occur spontaneously, without enzymatic catalysis.
Previous experimental studies in various strains of A. ferrooxidans detected several enzymatic activities involved in
the oxidation of RISCs [1,28], but some of these activities
had not been linked to specific genes. Based on genome
analysis, some of these missing assignments are predicted
and also some novel genes involved in the oxidation of
thiosulfate, sulfide, and tetrathionate are suggested.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

Experimentally validated components of RISC metabolism include: the pet-II operon (AFE2727-31) and alternative quinol oxidases of the bd (AFE0954-5) and bo3
families (AFE0631-4) [7,8]; a sulfide/quinone oxidoreductase encoded by sqr (AFE0267) suggested to be
involved in the oxidation of sulfide to sulfur [49,50]; and
a tetrathionate hydrolase encoded by tetH (AFE0029)
thought to be involved in the oxidation of tetrathionate
[51].
The two homologs of doxDA (AFE0044; AFE0048) present
in the genome are predicted to encode a thiosulfate/quinone oxidoreductase. Both appear to be a fusion of the
separate doxD and doxA genes that are found in other
organisms such as A. ambivalens [52,53]. Both are located
in a major gene cluster composed of two divergent gene
clusters. The first region (AFE0050-47) encodes a protein
with TAT-signal peptide (IPR006311, TIGR01409), a periplasmic solute-binding protein, the first doxDA gene, and
a conserved hypothetical protein. The second region
(AFE0046-42) encodes a conserved hypothetical protein,
a rhodanese enzyme that splits thiosulfate into sulfur and
sulfite [54], the second copy of doxDA, a periplasmic solute-binding protein, a second copy of a gene encoding a
protein
with
TAT-signal
peptide
(IPR006311,
TIGR01409), and a gene encoding a putative carboxylate
transporter. We have detected a similar organization in
the Gluconobacter oxydans genome.
Five genes, predicted to encode thiosulfate sulfur transferase (rhodanese) proteins (AFE2558, AFE2364,
AFE1502, AFE0529 and AFE0151) are dispersed in the
genome [55] but their roles in sulfur oxidation remain to
be firmly established. Notably, some of these predictions
are based on the presence of the rhodanese PFAM00581
motif associated with phosphatases and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases, in addition to sulfur oxidation. Genes
were not detected for several enzymatic functions that
have been experimentally demonstrated in other strains
of A. ferrooxidans including the sulfur dioxygenase that
oxidizes persulfide-sulfur to sulfite in A. ferrooxidans strain
R1 [1,56] and the sulfite oxidase that oxidizes sulfite to
sulfate in Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans [1,57].
2.2.3 Hydrogen and formate utilization
Hydrogen utilization has been demonstrated experimentally in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 [9] and a group 2
hydrogenase from A. ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 has been
characterized [58], but there were no previous reports
describing the hydrogenase genes and their genetic organization or their potential diversity. The A. ferrooxidans
genome encodes four different types of hydrogenases
based on the 2001 classification by Vignais et al. [59] (Figure 4, Additional file 3). Group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenases are
membrane-bound respiratory enzymes that enable the

cell to use molecular hydrogen as an energy source. A. ferrooxidans has both the predicted structural (AFE3283-86)
and the maturation-related genes (AFE3281-2; AFE328790) required for production of a functional respiratory
hydrogenase of this type. In addition, the small subunit of
this predicted complex has the characteristic TAT-signal
peptide used to target the full heterodimer to the periplasmic space [60]. The genomic arrangement of the structural
genes (hynS-isp1-isp2-hynL) is identical to that found in a
thermoacidophilic archaeon (Acidianus ambivalens), a
hyperthermophilic bacterium (Aquifex aeolicus), a denitrifying bacterium (Thiobacillus denitrificans), and two phototrophic sulfur bacteria (Thiocapsa roseopersicina and
Allochromatium vinosum). Like A. ferrooxidans, all of these
bacteria are chemoautotrophs that live in extreme environments, use inorganic energy sources, and have an
active sulfur metabolism that oxidizes and reduces inorganic sulfur compounds [61].
A. ferrooxidans also encodes a group 2 cytoplasmic uptake
[NiFe]-hydrogenase (AFE0701-2). Group 2 hydrogenases
are induced during nitrogen fixation to utilize the molecular hydrogen generated [62]. The cyanobacterial-like
hydrogenase in A. ferrooxidans exhibits the characteristic
features of uptake hydrogenases as determined by EPR
and FTIR [63]. Divergently oriented from the group 2
hydrogenase gene cluster is a predicted σ54-dependent
hydrogenase transcriptional regulator (hupR) (AFE0700).
HupR together with a histidine kinase forms part of a twocomponent regulatory system in R. eutropha [64], but the
histidine kinase appears to be absent from the A. ferrooxidans genome. Despite that, HupR is able to activate transcription in the non-phosphorylated form [65-67],
indicating that HupR is still able to regulate transcription
of the group 2 hydrogenase system in A. ferrooxidans.
Adjacent to the group 2 hydrogenase gene cluster and
transcribed in the same direction is a predicted cysteine
regulon transcriptional activator cysB (AFE0699). This is
followed by a cluster of genes potentially involved in fermentation, including a predicted σ54-dependent transcriptional regulator and a group of isc-like genes
(AFE0672-78). The latter gene group is thought to be
involved in assembling the iron-sulfur cluster of the nitrogenase used in nitrogen fixation, thus suggesting a connection between hydrogen production by the group 2
hydrogenase and nitrogen fixation [68]. The close proximity of the fermentation gene cluster suggests an additional
metabolic coupling with fermentative metabolism, perhaps as part of a σ54 regulatory cascade operating in anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions.
The third predicted hydrogenase encodes a sulfhydrogenase, a group 3b cytoplasmic, bidirectional, heterotetrameric hydrogenase. This hydrogenase, in association with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

other proteins, binds soluble cofactors such as NAD,
cofactor 420, and NADP [59]. Domain analysis predicts
an F420 binding site in the α subunit (large hydrogenase
subunit; AFE0937) and NAD- and FAD-binding sites in
the γ subunit (AFE0939). The predicted NAD-binding site
suggests that A. ferrooxidans can use NADPH as an electron
donor, as has been shown for Pyrococcus furiosus [69]. A
possible role for this hydrogenase could be the recycling
of redox cofactors using protons or water as redox counterparts, as has been suggested for Alcaligenes eutrophus,
thus serving as an electron sink under high reducing conditions [66].
The gene organization and amino acid sequence of a sixgene cluster (AFE2149-54) (Figure 4c) shows significant
similarity to the group 4 H2-evolving hydrogenase complex found in several organisms (e.g., Methanococcus barkeri [70]). In M. barkeri, this cluster encodes a six-subunit
complex that catalyzes the energetically unfavorable
reduction of ferrodoxin by H2, possibly driven by reverse
electron transport. The reduced ferrodoxin produced then
serves as a low-potential electron donor for the synthesis
of pyruvate in an anabolic pathway [71]. Reverse electron
flow for the production of NADH via the oxidation of
Fe(II) in A. ferrooxidans has been shown to be driven by
the proton motif force (PMF) across its membrane that
results from the acidity of its environment [72]. The predicted activity of the group 4 hydrogenase complex may
exemplify another where A. ferrooxidans exploits the natural PMF to generate reducing power and couple it to redox
reactions.
Another possible role for the group 4 hydrogenase complex involves the oxidation of formate. Two clusters of
three genes (AFE1652-4 and AFE0690-2) potentially
encode a formate dehydrogenase complex consisting of a
formate dehydrogenase accessory protein FdhD-1, a
hypothetical protein, and a molybdopterin formate dehydrogenase. The second cluster is divergently oriented from
a gene encoding a predicted σ54-dependent transcriptional regulator. It has been reported that this complex
associates with a hydrogenase group 4 complex in E. coli
to create a formate hydrogenase supercomplex [73]. We
propose a similar model for A. ferrooxidans, thus offering
a biochemical basis for its ability to oxidize formate [10].
2.2.4 Anaerobic metabolism
Several strains of A. ferrooxidans have been reported to use
electron acceptors other than O2, including the use of ferric iron for the oxidation of sulfur and hydrogen and the
use of sulfur for the oxidation of hydrogen by A. ferrooxidans JCM 7811 [74]. In that strain, the reduction of ferric
iron was accompanied by the increased expression of a 28
kDa c-type cytochrome that was suggested to be responsible for this activity [74]. The reduction of ferric iron dur-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:597

ing sulfur oxidation was also shown for the type strain
ATCC 23270 [75]. However, a gene potentially encoding
this cytochrome could not be identified in A. ferrooxidans
ATCC 23270 [76]. A candidate iron reduction complex
has been investigated in A. ferrooxidans AP19-3 by electrophoretic purification and enzymatic assays [77,78]. However, potential genes encoding this complex could not be
detected in our genome analysis.
The use of sulfur as an electron acceptor was investigated
in A. ferrooxidans NASF-1 where aerobically grown cells
were found to produce hydrogen sulfide from elemental
sulfur using NADH as electron donor via a proposed sulfur reductase [79]. However, the observed molecular
weights of the subunits of this sulfur reductase do not correspond to those predicted from an analysis of the group
3b hydrogenase genes in the type strain genome, with the
caveat that post-translational modifications could explain
the differences in molecular weights. However, a gene
cluster (AFE2177-81) was detected in the type strain that
is predicted to encode a sulfur reductase enzyme with significant similarity of amino acid sequence and gene order
to the cluster suggested to be responsible for sulfur reduction in Acidianus ambivalens [80]. We hypothesize that this
enzyme could associate with the predicted group 1 hydrogenase to form a supercomplex, facilitating the use of
hydrogen as an electron and energy source with sulfur
serving as the final electron acceptor.
2.3 Nitrogen metabolism
A. ferrooxidans can meet its nitrogen needs by either nitrogen fixation or ammonia assimilation. Diazotrophic
growth of A. ferrooxidans was first demonstrated in early
studies of acetylene reduction and 15N2 assimilation [15]
and the structural genes for the nitrogenase complex were
later sequenced [81-83].
2.3.1 Ammonia uptake and utilization
The A. ferrooxidans genome contains genes predicted to be
involved in ammonia uptake (amt1, amt2 and amtB;
AFE2916, AFE2911, and AFE1922). Amt1 and amt2 are
located in a gene cluster that includes a gene potentially
encoding a class-I glutamine amidotransferase (AFE2917)
that has been shown in other organisms to transfer
ammonia derived from the hydrolysis of glutamine to
other substrates. GlnK-1 (AFE2915) is also present in this
cluster and is predicted to encode a P-II regulatory protein
involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in
response to carbon and glutamine availability [84]. A glnA
homolog (AFE0466) is predicted to encode a type I
glutamine synthase that would permit the incorporation
of ammonia directly into glutamine, completing the
inventory of genes necessary for ammonia uptake and utilization.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

2.3.2 Nitrogen Fixation
A putative nitrogenase gene cluster (nifH-D-K-fer1-fer2-EN-X; AFE1522-AFE1515) (Additional file 4) was previously reported in the type strain [68]. These genes potentially encode the nitrogenase complex and proteins
involved in the synthesis of the nitrogenase MoCo cofactor. In other organisms, nitrogenase has been shown to be
oxygen sensitive and its expression and activity are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational
levels [84]. Divergently oriented from the nif operon is a
cluster of genes involved in the regulation of nitrogenase
activity. The first gene of this cluster is a putative σ54
response regulator (AFE1523). This is followed by the
draT and draG genes (AFE1524, AFE1525) that encode a
dinitrogen-reductase ADP-D-ribosyltransferase and a
ADP-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] hydrolase, respectively. These two are involved in the post-translational
modulation of nitrogenase activity in response to ammonium and oxygen concentrations [84]. NifA (AFE1527) is
also present in the same gene cluster. NifA potentially
encodes an enhancer binding protein that, together with
σ54, is involved in the transcriptional activation of the nif
operon in response to the redox, carbon, and nitrogen status. This ensures that nitrogen fixation occurs only under
physiological conditions that are appropriate for nitrogenase activity [85].

Using this genomic information, a gene network for the
regulation of nitrogen fixation and ammonia uptake can
be suggested for A. ferrooxidans that is consistent with similar models derived from other organisms (Figure 5) [84].
In this model, NifA (AFE1527) is the transcriptional activator of the nitrogenase operon and its expression is regulated by a two-component regulatory system encoded by
ntrB and ntrC (AFE2902, AFE2901) that measure oxygen
and nitrogen levels. These signals are integrated by the PII proteins (glnK-1, AFE2915; glnB-1, AFE2462; glnK-2,
AFE2240; and glnB-2, AFE0429) with additional metabolic signals, such as fixed carbon and energetic status
[86]. Two additional copies of ntrC and ntrB, termed ntrY
and ntrX (AFE0024, AFE0023) have been detected in the
genome that could allow cross talk between the sensor/
regulator pairs NtrY/X and NtrB/C, as described in Azospirillum brasilense [87]. The redundancy of the regulatory
genes responsible for nitrogen fixation and assimilation
suggests the presence of a flexible mechanism that is
responsive to environmental changes.
3. Nutrient uptake and assimilation systems
A. ferrooxidans has 72 genes (2.23%) predicted to be
involved in nutrient uptake (Additional file 3) whereas
most heterotrophic γ-proteobacteria typically dedicate
about 14% of their genome information to transport
functions [88]. The potential substrates incorporated
include phosphate, sulfate, iron, ammonia, organic acids,

amino acids, and sugars. This repertoire, especially the
low representation of predicted carbohydrate uptake systems, is a signature of obligate autotrophic bacteria [88].
3.1 Inorganic ion assimilation
3.1.1 Sulfate
A gene for a predicted sulfate permease (AFE0286) of the
SulP family is present in the genome adjacent to a poten-

tial carbonic anhydrase gene (AFE0287). This linkage has
been observed in many bacteria [89], suggesting that the
gene pair forms a sulfate/carbonate antiporter system. Sulfate taken up from the environment is thought to be
reduced to sulfide for cysteine biosynthesis by a group of
genes belonging to the cys regulon [68].

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:597

3.1.2 Phosphate
Previous investigations of phosphate metabolism in A.
ferrooxidans provided evidence for a phosphate starvation
response [90] and for a relationship between polyphosphate degradation and heavy metal resistance and efflux
[91]. However, we still lacked a comprehensive understanding of all the potential components involved in
phosphate metabolism, as well as their integration and
regulation. Our genome analysis identified a complete
repertoire of the genes necessary for phosphate uptake by
the high affinity Pst-transport system. These predicted
genes are arranged in two similar clusters. The first cluster
(AFE1939-41) includes two genes (pstC-1 and pstC-2) that
encode a phosphate permease and a third gene (pstS-1)
that encodes a periplasmic phosphate binding protein.
The second gene cluster (AFE1441-1434) includes a gene
encoding a exopolyphosphatase (ppx, AFE1441) previously described to be involved in heavy metal resistance
and efflux [91], phoU (AFE1440) predicted to encode a
phosphate transport regulatory protein, pstB encoding an
ATP binding protein, and pstA coding for the permease
component. In addition, there are genes encoding a third
homolog of the phosphate permease PstC-3, a second
homolog of the periplasmic phosphate binding protein
PstS-2, and the two-component response regulator PhoR/
PhoB.

The predicted phosphonate utilization gene cluster
(AFE2278-86) contains genes for C-P cleavage and an
ATP-binding protein for the ABC phosphonate transport
system. In spite of the experimental evidence reported
about the utilization of phosphonate in this bacterium
[92], the typical permease subunit that is required to complete phosphonate uptake was not found in the genome.
The genome does contain a gene (AFE1876) for a predicted polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) involved in polyphosphate storage. It has been suggested to be part of a pho
regulon whose expression is activated during phosphate
starvation [89] and in response to heavy metal toxicity
[91].
3.1.3 Iron
Genomic evidence indicates that A. ferrooxidans relies on
diverse standard iron uptake mechanisms to obtain both
Fe(II) and Fe(III) (93). The type strain has candidate genes
(AFE2523-AFE2525) potentially encoding the FeoABC
Fe(II) inner-membrane transport system and an NRAMP
dual Mn(II)/Fe(II) MntH-like transporter (AFE0105). Previously reported gene context analysis indicated that feoA,
feoB, and feoC form part of an iron-regulated operon,
along with an ORF (AFE2522) encoding a putative porin
(designated feoP) that could facilitate entrance of Fe(II)
into the periplasm [93].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

A. ferrooxidans is typically confronted with an exceptionally high concentration of soluble iron in its acidic environment, as high as 10-1M compared to 10-16 M in typical
neutrophilic environments. This raises questions as to the
mechanisms it uses for iron assimilation and homeostatic
control of internal iron concentrations. Given the abundance of both Fe(II) and Fe(III) in its environment, A. ferrooxidans has a surprisingly large number of iron uptake
systems, including eleven distinct putative genes encoding
TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors (tdr) for high
affinity uptake of siderophore-chelated Fe(III) (tdrA,
AFE2935; tdrC, AFE1483; tdrD, AFE1492; tdrE, AFE2040;
tdrF, AFE2998; tdrG, AFE2302; tdrH, AFE2298; tdrI,
AFE2292; tdrJ, AFE2288; tdrK, AFE0763; tdrL, AFE3229).
Also, it has a number of copies of all the accessory genes
needed to transport iron into the cytoplasm, including
seven different copies of the energy transduction genes
tonB (AFE3002, AFE2304, AFE2301, AFE2275, AFE2268,
AFE1487, AFE0770) and exbB (AFE3003, AFE2299,
AFE2273, AFE2270, AFE1485, AFE0768, AFE0485) and
six copies of exbD (AFE3004, AFE2300, AFE2269,
AFE1486, AFE0769, AFE0486), as well as the genes encoding two different ABC iron transporters (AFE1489AFE1491, AFE1493-AFE1495). No genes were detected
that might be involved in standard mechanisms of
siderophore production. However, its multiple
siderophore uptake systems suggest that it is nonetheless
capable of living in environments where iron is scarce
(perhaps at higher pH values) and in which other organisms capable of producing siderophores are present.
For Fe(III) uptake, all the genes involved are organized in
seven gene clusters, some of which include additional
gene functions [22]. One cluster encodes a complete suite
of proteins necessary for Fe(III) uptake (AFE1482AFE1495) that includes not only two outer membrane
receptors (OMRs) of different predicted siderophore specificities, but also three different ABC solute-binding proteins with affinity for iron and molybdenum and may be
a dedicated iron-molybdenum transport system that is
present in a genomic island [94]. This predicted operon
also includes a putative gene (gloA, AFE1482) predicted to
encode a globin-like protein that has been suggested to be
an oxygen sensor regulating the expression of Fe-Mo
uptake [94]. GloA is also associated with an upstream Fur
box, indicating possible regulation via the master iron regulator Fur [21].
3.2 Carbon compound uptake
3.2.1 Amino acids
Among the predicted nutrient transport genes in the A. ferrooxidans genome are five amino acid permeases of
unknown specificity (AFE2659, AFE2457, AFE1782,
AFE0719, and AFE0439) (the same number as found in
the chemolithoautotroph T. crunogena) and one complete

Page 13 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:597

ABC system for dipeptide uptake (AFE2987-92). The addition of leucine to solid media has been reported to
improve the yield of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 33020 during
the first ten days of growth, whereas the addition of
cysteine or methionine inhibits growth [95]. More
recently, the addition of minimal concentrations of glutamate to liquid media was found to accelerate the growth
rate of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (Omar Orellana, personal communication).
3.2.2 Carbohydrate uptake
The suite of genes for carbohydrate transport appears to be
limited, as has been found in most obligate autotrophs
(e.g., T. denitrificans [96], T. crunogena [88], M. capsulatus
[97], N. europea [98], and N. oceanii [99]). This suite of
predicted genes includes two outer membrane carbohydrate selective porins of the OPRB family (AFE2522,
AFE2250), one carbohydrate transporter of unknown specificity (AFE2312) that is related to the major facilitator
superfamily (PF00083, PS50850) and very similar to
xylose and galactose proton symporters [100], and an
MFS transporter (AFE1971) with marginal similarity to
sugar/nucleoside symporters. It also includes genes for an
incomplete PTS system for carbohydrate uptake
(AFE3018-23) potentially encoding EII-A, a kinase/phosphatase HprK, an ATPase, an IIA component, a phosphocarrier protein Hpr, and a phosphoenolpyruvate
phosphotransferase. However, we could not identify a
gene encoding the IIC sugar permease component, thus
making it unlikely that A. ferrooxidans has a functional
sugar-transporting PTS system. Instead, we suggest that
this PTS system could be involved in molecular signaling
as part of a regulatory cascade involving RpoN, as
described in other proteobacteria [101]. In this model, a
decrease of fixed carbon leads to low levels of phosphoenolpyruvate and cyclic-AMP that in turn maintain most
PTS proteins in the dephosphorylated form. This promotes the utilization of glycogen as a carbon source to
replenish the phosphoenolpyruvate levels, thus restoring
the levels of phosphorylated PTS proteins [102].
4. Central carbon metabolism
It has been shown in many organisms that the 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde generated by CO2 fixation via the
Calvin cycle enters the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnass pathway, thus providing fixed carbon that can be channeled in
either of two directions: for glycogen biosynthesis and
storage, or to provide carbon backbones for anabolic reactions. The genes predicted for these two pathways in A. ferrooxidans, together with their reactions and potential
interconnections with other biosynthetic pathways, are
shown in Figure 6.
4.1 Carbon storage and utilization
The genome also contains genes predicted to encode the
five enzymes required for glycogen biosynthesis from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

fructose-6P. As has been shown in other organisms, glucose-1P-adenylyltransferase (glgC, AFE2838) is predicted
to synthesize ADP-glucose. A specific glycogen synthase
(glgA, AFE2678) would then transfer the glucosyl moiety
of ADP-glucose to a glycogen primer to form a new 1,4glucosidic bond. Subsequently, a branching enzyme
(glgB, AFE2836) is predicted to catalyze the formation of
branched 1,6-glucosidic linkages.
The carbon stored in glycogen is thought to be released by
glucan phosphorylase (glgP1, AFE1799; glgP2, AFE0527),
thus regenerating glucose-1P from the non-reducing terminus of the 1,4 chain. The pathway for the conversion of
glucose-6P to 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-gluconate is also predicted to be present, except for the last step that replenishes the levels of pyruvate and 3P-glycerate. In addition,
a gene encoding phosphoribulokinase was not detected,
thus suggesting that either alternate genes encode the
missing functions or else that A. ferrooxidans regenerates
pyruvate and 3P-glycerate from stored glycogen by alternate pathways. Expression data obtained from A. ferrooxidans growing with sulfur and iron as energy sources have
shown that genes involved in glycogen synthesis and utilization are differentially expressed [103]. Specifically,
growth in sulfur-containing media preferentially activates
genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis, whereas growth
on iron-supplemented media upregulates genes involved
in glycogen breakdown. This suggests that A. ferrooxidans
channels fixed carbon to glycogen when sulfur is available
as an energy source and uses glycogen as a reserve carbon
donor when iron is the energy source.
4.2 Carbon backbone formation
The genome contains three genes (AFE1802, AFE1676
and AFE3248) that are predicted to encode fructose
biphosphate aldolase (EC. 4.1.2.13), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of fructose-1,6-bP. The interconversion of fructose-1,6-bP to fructose-6P in most
heterotrophic bacteria is carried out by fructose biphosphatase and phosphofructokinase enzymes. In A. ferrooxidans, a gene encoding a fructose biphosphatase enzyme
was found (AFE0189) that we suggest allows a direct flux
of fixed carbon to glycogen storage. A potential phosphofructokinase candidate gene (AFE1807) was also found, a
member of the PfkB family of sugar kinases (cd01164). It
is located near putative genes involved in glycolysis/glyconeogenesis (e.g., phosphoglycerate mutase and phosphoenolpyruvate
synthase),
thus
generating
a
bidirectional metabolic path for the utilization/generation of glycogen.

Putative genes for all the enzymes involved in the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-P to pyruvate and acetyl-coA, as
well as for the citric acid (TCA) cycle, were detected with
the exception of genes encoding the E1-3 subunits of αketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus, the TCA cycle is

incomplete, as has been described in a number of obligate
autotrophic bacteria and archaea – a likely hallmark of
this lifestyle [104].
5. Heavy metal resistance
Bioleaching microorganisms, such as A. ferrooxidans, typically live in environments that have high concentrations
of soluble heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, mercury, and silver),
as well as unusually high concentrations of potentially
toxic metals (e.g., copper and iron). This has prompted
numerous studies of the mechanisms employed by A. ferrooxidans for metal resistance [105]. In contrast to the
genomic perspective presented herein, those investigations were conducted on multiple strains and thus do not
provide a coherent view of the repertoire of heavy metal
resistance genes present within one strain.

Our genome analysis confirmed the presence of a divergent gene cluster (AFE2857-60) previously identified as
involved in arsenic resistance. The cluster includes genes
encoding an arsenate reductase (ArsC), the arsenate
repressor (ArsR), the divergently-oriented arsenate efflux
pump (ArsB), and a hypothetical protein (ArsH). The
arsCRB gene cluster was shown to confer resistance to
arsenate, arsenite, and antimonium in E. coli, but the function of arsH is unknown [106,107].
Mercury resistance has been investigated in several strains
of A. ferrooxidans [108-110]. Genome analysis of the type
strain identified three genes potentially encoding the welldescribed Mer components, i.e., the repressor accessory
protein (MerD, AFE2483), the mercury reductase (MerA,
AFE2481), and the mercuric ion transporter (MerC,
AFE2480). Four candidate genes potentially encoding
members of the family of MerR-like transcriptional regulators were also found (AFE2607, AFE2509, AFE1431, and
AFE0373).
The A. ferrooxidans genome also contains several genes
(Additional file 3) predicted to be part of heavy metal tolerance systems [111], including genes for the copCD copper extrusion system, ten clusters of genes predicted to
belong to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)
family of transporters, three genes encoding cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) proteins, three genes encoding copper translocating P-type ATPases, and two genes encoding
other P-type ATPases of unknown specificity. These
genome-based predictions offer new opportunities for
experimental validation of heavy metal resistance in A.
ferrooxidans and also provide new markers for detecting
similar genes in other microorganisms
6. Extrusion of toxic organic compounds
The ability to extrude toxic organic compounds is widespread, and our inspection of the A. ferrooxidans genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

suggests that this bacterium is well equipped to deal with
toxic organic molecules. Its genome contains a gene predicted to encode the toluene tolerance protein TtgD
(AFE1830) as well as a cluster of proteins often associated
with toluene resistance that includes a Tol-Pal-associated
acyl-CoA thioesterase (AFE0063) and TolBARQ
(AFE0064-67).
The genome also includes a predicted complete ABC gene
cluster (AFE0158-63) involved in drug extrusion that has
significant similarity to the toluene ABC resistance proteins reported in other organisms. Resistance to toluene/
xylene and related aromatic hydrocarbons and organic
solvents may be needed by A. ferrooxidans when growing
in runoff from coal wastes where it might encounter aromatic hydrocarbons [112] or in bioleaching operation
heaps that are irrigated with recycled water containing carboxylic acids and other organic compounds from solvent
extraction operations [113].
An alternative hypothesis for the role of drug-related compound extrusion mechanisms present in microbes associated with biogeochemical cycles has been proposed [114].
A homolog of TolC has been shown in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to excrete anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate
(AQDS) that is used as an extracellular electron shuttle. It
has been proposed that AQDS may be particularly important to transfer electrons from cells embedded in the interior of biofilms to reduce Fe(III) present in the solid
substrate to which the biofilm is attached. It is possible
that a similar mechanism may be used by A. ferrooxidans
in the reverse process, namely, to convey electrons from
the oxidation of Fe(II) present in solid minerals to cells
not in contact with the substrate.
Two additional ABC systems potentially involved in drug
extrusion are also predicted in the genome, each associated with a HlyD secretion protein family (AFE2861-64,
AFE1603-7). The first is directly downstream from the ars
genes; the second cluster may have originated through lateral gene transfer since it is flanked by truncated transposases and hypothetical genes and it also exhibits
anomalous G+C content.
A. ferrooxidans may also be resistant to some antibiotics
due to the presence of a two-gene cluster (AFE1977-78)
potentially encoding a fosfomidocyn resistance protein
and a TonB-family protein, respectively, and also a gene
potentially encoding an AmpG permease protein
(AFE1961).
7. Stress responses
For aerobically growing bacteria, the autooxidation of oxidases in the respiratory chain is the main source of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of

Page 16 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:597

ROS can also result from exposure to redox active metals,
including iron. Aerobic biomining microorganisms such
as A. ferrooxidans that thrive in iron-rich environments are
thus expected to be well equipped to deal with disturbances in oxidant-antiooxidant balance. Surprisingly, an
unexpectedly low number of genes encoding known ROS
detoxification functions were identified in the genome.
These genes include a Mn-superoxide dismutase encoded
by sodA (AFE1898), two non-identical copies of ahpC-like
(AFE1468, AFE0985) and ahpD-like (AFE02014,
AFE1814) members of the alkylhydroperoxidase family,
and nox, (AFE1803) potentially encoding a NADH oxidase (FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family protein). This latter is considered to be
important in oxygen scavenging in anaerobes because of
its potential to reduce oxygen to water [115]. No genes
coding for known catalases were detected.
On the other hand, A. ferrooxidans is predicted to have a
complete set of components needed for non-enzymatic
neutralization of ROS. This mechanism maintains high
levels of low molecular weight thiols in the cytoplasm
that, in combination with specific disulfide reductases,
provide a reducing intracellular environment and maintain the thiol/disulfide balance of other molecules
(unpublished results). Seven distinct thioredoxins (txr;
AFE2867, AFE2848, AFE2590, AFE2362, AFE1979,
AFE0657, AFE0047) and one thioredoxin disulfide
reductase (trxB, AFE0375) are present. Also present are the
genes of the glutathione system necessary for glutathionetripeptide synthesis from the amino acids L-cysteine, Lglutamate, and glycine (gshA, AFE03064; gshB,
AFE03063), four distinct glutaredoxins (gxr; AFE3038,
AFE2449, AFE2263, AFE0367), and the glutathione
reductase gorA (AFE0366).
In some bacteria, when basic protection is not sufficient,
e.g., when sudden large increases in ROS occur, rapid global responses are induced to cope with the oxidative stress
[116]. Often survival during the period of stress is aided
by the simultaneous employment of multiple strategies.
The strategies predicted to be available to A. ferrooxidans
include repair of oxidative damage (e.g., nfo), bypassing of
damaged functions (e.g., resistant isozymes acnA, fumC),
and the exclusion of oxidative stress agents (e.g., acrAB
multidrug efflux pump). Typically, many of these functions are coordinately regulated in response to superoxide
by the SoxRS two-component regulator, and in response
to peroxide by OxyR in Gram-negative bacteria or by PerR
in Gram-positive bacteria. A. ferrooxidans lacks oxyR, soxR,
and soxS orthologs, but has a Fur family regulator similar
to PerR (AFE1467). The role of PerR in the control of A.
ferrooxidans inducible stress response has not been investigated, but could include regulation of the divergently-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

transcribed AhpC family peroxidase (AFE1468). This
arrangement is conserved in other microorganisms [117].
Other antioxidant defenses that are not controlled by the
major oxidative stress regulators include the DNA repair
enzyme endonuclease III (nth, AFE2682), glycoylases
(mutM, AFE2758; mutY, AFE3015), DNA polymerase I
(polA, AFE3094), recombinase protein A (recA, AFE0932),
and other defenses including a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (msrAB, AFE2946-45) and a molecular
chaperone (hlsO, AFE1408).
8. Flagella formation and chemotaxis
Conserved fla or fla-related genes that could encode flagella were not identified in the genome, nor were che genes
that encode classic chemotaxis functions. These observations conflict with Ohmura et al. (1996) [118] who proposed that the formation of flagella was a major factor
mediating the adhesion of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 to
solid sulfur surfaces. This discrepancy could be explained
if the fla genes have been lost in the particular culture used
for sequencing. Since flagella genes are encoded in a multigene operon in many bacteria, their complete loss might
require only one or a small number of excision events. In
contrast, the multiple che genes are usually widely dispersed in bacterial genomes and their collective loss in A.
ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 would presumably require multiple excision events. Alternative hypotheses to explain
this discrepancy include (i) contamination of the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 culture used by Ohmura et al.
(1996) by a flagella-bearing microorganism, and (ii) significant differences between the culture used by Ohmura
et al. (1996) and that used for our genome sequencing
despite their identical designation (ATCC 23270).
9. Adhesion and biofilm formation
For mineral-associated bacteria, adhesion and biofilm formation are critical steps for colonization and subsequent
mineral solubilization [119]. Cell surface structures such
as pili have been shown to play a critical role in autoaggregation of microbial cells involved in biogeochemical
processes [120]. A. ferrooxidans contains several gene clusters potentially involved in the formation of a type IV
pilus (AFE0967-73, AFE0735-39, AFE0416, AFE0183-6,
and AFE0006-7). Some of the relevant genes identified
include those for the σ54-dependent transcriptional regulator pilR (AFE0185) and for the signal transduction histidine kinase pilS (AFE0184). In addition, candidate tad
(tight adherence) genes (AFE2699-AFE2708) were also
detected (Additional file 5). These genes are responsible
for the secretion and assembly of bundled pili. In A. actinomycetemcomitans, they are essential for tight adherence,
autoaggregation, and pili formation during colonization
of dental surfaces [121]. They are also present in Thiomicrospora crunogena [88], a RISCs-oxidizing, chemoau-

totrophic bacterium found in thermal vents. The multiple
copies of genes for pili biosynthesis and adhesion in A.
ferrooxidans could enable attachment and colonization on
various mineral surfaces, such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, and
solid sulfur. The redundancy of related regulatory genes
could allow A. ferrooxidans to respond successfully to environmental changes.
Genes involved in quorum sensing that were previously
identified and characterized include those that encode the
classical autoinducer-binding transcriptional regulator
LuxR (AFE1997) and the autoinducer synthesis protein
LuxI (AFE1999) [122]. In addition, a second route for the
production of homoserine lactones using the act system
was predicted based on the presence of a gene encoding
an acyltranferase (act, AFE2584) that was shown to be
involved in the production of homoserine lactones of C14
length [123].
A five gene operon, containing luxA-galE-galK-pgm-galM,
was assigned gene numbers AFE1341-45, respectively.
This operon has been proposed to be involved in the formation of extra-cellular polysaccharide (EPS) precursors
via the Leloir pathway [100]. GalU (AFE0445) and galTlike (AFE1237) have also been predicted to form part of
the Leloir pathway and genes rfbA, B, C and D (AFE3295,
AFE0441, AFE3294 and AFE0442, respectively) have been
proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the EPS
precursor dTDP-rhamnose. These groups of genes have
been postulated to be involved in biofilm formation in A.
ferrooxidans and their patterns of transcription were characterized in growth media with and without organic carbon supplementation [100].
10. Genetic transfer
A region of the genome (AFE1013-AFE1387, Figure 2) is
enriched (84% versus 54% for the rest of the genome) in
putative genes encoding hypothetical proteins, genes for
DNA metabolism and sequences related to mobile elements such as transposases, plasmids, and bacteriophage
(phage), and pseudogenes. The presence of site-specific
recombinases and phage integrases in this region, as well
as in other regions such as AFE2397-99, AFE0833-35 and
AFE0507-9, indicates that A. ferrooxidans has been the target of phage infection. Although no phages are currently
known to infect A. ferrooxidans, this finding suggests that
further searching might be fruitful. Such phage could
facilitate study of the mechanisms of viral infection in
extremely acidic conditions, as well as serve as useful
transducing agents for the genetic manipulation of A. ferrooxidans, as have been shown for the acidophilic
archaeon, Sulfolobus spp. [124,125].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

The genome contains clusters of genes whose sequence
and gene order show significant similarity to both the Trb
system of the Ri plasmid from Rhizobium rhizogenes and
the Ti plasmid from Agrobacterium tumefaciens [126]. Most
of these predicted genes potentially encode structural proteins of the type IV secretion system involved in conjugative DNA transfer. However, missing from the genome are
the trbC, trbH, and trbK genes that encode an inner membrane lipoprotein, a pili structural protein, and a protein
involved in plasmid immunity, respectively. Notably, one
of two copies of a trbG-like gene is located within a highly
conserved cluster in a position usually occupied by trbH,
and it may assume the role of this missing gene. The
absence of critical components of the conjugation system
suggests that A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 has lost the
capacity to carry out conjugation via the Trb mechanism.
The question arises as to the origin of the Ti plasmid-like
sequences in A. ferrooxidans. One possibility is that it was
acquired from an Agrobacterium-related microorganism or
an ancestor of such through conjugation. A. ferrooxidans
and a free-living or plant root-associated Agrobacterium
might share the same environment at the interface of
acidic drainages and anaerobic soils/water.
Ten proteins predicted to be involved in plasmid stability
and maintenance are present in the genome. This discovery, coupled with the detection of an extensive suite of
predicted conjugation-related genes, provides additional
evidence that A. ferrooxidans was capable of undergoing
conjugation. Even though no natural conjugation partners are known, conjugation between E. coli and A. ferrooxidans has been achieved in the laboratory. The
frequency of detectable marker transfer has been very low
[95,127,128], and must be increased before this technique can be used for widespread genetic manipulation of
A. ferrooxidans. Our finding of conjugation-related genes
could stimulate further attempts.
Forty-one IS elements were identified, of which thirtythree could be classified as members of nine families
according to the scheme of Mahillon and Chandler [129]
(Additional file 3). The largest groups, designated here as
ISafe3 (8 copies) and ISafe4 (3 copies), belong to the
IS110 and IS3 families, respectively [129]. ISafe1, which is
associated with phenotypic switching in A. ferrooxidans
ATCC 19859 [130], was not detected in the genome of the
type strain. Two non-identical copies of a Tn5468 transposon (family Tn7-like) were detected, each containing
tnsABCDorf5 (AFE1201-AFE1205, AFE3199-95). The first
copy is embedded in a suite of genes encoding hypothetical proteins; the second is associated with the atp operon
and the glmSU as described for A. ferrooxidans ATCC
33020 [131].

11. Predicted osmotic balance and potential pH tolerance
mechanisms
Acidophiles exhibit functional and structural properties
that allow them to survive and proliferate in extremely
acidic environments (pH 3 or below) [reviewed in 132].
These include: a) impermeable cell membranes (mostly in
archaea); b) selective outer membrane porins; c) the generation of positive internal potential (Δψ) to create a
chemosmotic barrier inhibiting proton influx; and d) the
removal of excess internal protons by active proton
pumping.

A putative gene (omp40, AFE2741) was identified that had
significant similarity to an outer membrane porin found
in A. ferrooxidans strain ATCC 19859 (133, 134). A large
external, positively-charged loop has been predicted in
Omp40 that may control pore size and ion selectivity at
the porin entrance and may constitute a potential proton
barrier [133,134].
In addition, the following related functions were predicted (Additional file 3): several potassium transporters
including one K+ channel, one K+ uptake protein and one
K+ efflux transporter; two copies of an ABC potassium
import system that could be involved in the generation of
a positive internal potential inhibiting proton influx; four
Na/H+ antiporters and two proton P-type ATPases that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/597

could extrude excess internal protons. These predictions
suggest specific areas for future experimental validation.

Conclusion
• Bioinformatics analysis of the complete genome of the
type strain of A. ferrooxidans (ATCC 23207) provides a valuable platform for gene discovery and functional prediction that is especially important given the difficulties in
carrying out standard genetic research in this microorganism. The models presented herein should facilitate the
design and interpretation of future experiments and enable the experimental investigator to focus on important
issues.
• An analysis of the genome of the type strain provides a
coherent view of the gene content and metabolic potential
of this species (Figure 7).
• Metabolic models support the key capabilities of A. ferrooxidans that pertain to its use in industrial bioleaching,
including its ability to oxidize both sulfur and iron, to
resist low pH, and to live in environments with potentially toxic organic and inorganic chemicals. They also
suggest that it has the ability to precipitate metals in
anaerobic environments, which would be deleterious to
copper bioleaching activity.

• Our analysis also prompts several unexpected predictions, some of which could potentially be useful in biomining such as the proposed connection between biofilm
formation and central carbon metabolism and the presence of several predicted quorum sensing mechanisms.
Indications of past phage infection and conjugation
events suggest potentially fruitful approaches for the
development of efficient methods for genetic manipulation of this microorganism.
• Metabolic models also indicate how this microorganism
could play an important role as a producer of fixed carbon
and nitrogen and as a recycler of metals in bioleaching
operations as well as in natural environments.

Methods
Genome sequencing and assembly
The genome was sequenced and assembled using the
whole genome shotgun method as previously described
[135-137].
Sequence annotation
Gene modeling was performed using CRTICA [138] and
GLIMMER [139]. The lists of open reading frames (ORFs)
generated by both strategies were merged using CRITICA
start sites when models were identical. The translated
ORFs were submitted to BLAST analysis against the UNIPROT database to evaluate overlaps and alternative start
sites. The final list of coding sequences (CDSs) was translated, and these amino acid sequences were then used to
query the following databases (August-December, 2007):
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
nonredundant database, UniProt, TIGRFam, Pfam,
PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro. Manual functional
assignments were performed gene-by-gene, when needed.
Comparative genome analyses were also performed using
the Comprehensive Microbial Resource [140].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The sequence and annotation of the complete A. ferrooxidans strain ATCC 23270 genome is available at the Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) (J. Craig Venter
Institute, http://www.jcvi.org) and in GenBank/EMBL/
DDBJ accession number CP001219.
