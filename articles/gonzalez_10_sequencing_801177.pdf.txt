Abstract
Background: Cucumis melo (melon) belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, whose economic importance among
horticulture crops is second only to Solanaceae. Melon has a high intra-specific genetic variation, morphologic
diversity and a small genome size (454 Mb), which make it suitable for a great variety of molecular and genetic
studies. A number of genetic and genomic resources have already been developed, such as several genetic maps,
BAC genomic libraries, a BAC-based physical map and EST collections. Sequence information would be invaluable
to complete the picture of the melon genomic landscape, furthering our understanding of this species’ evolution
from its relatives and providing an important genetic tool. However, to this day there is little sequence data
available, only a few melon genes and genomic regions are deposited in public databases. The development of
massively parallel sequencing methods allows envisaging new strategies to obtain long fragments of genomic
sequence at higher speed and lower cost than previous Sanger-based methods.
Results: In order to gain insight into the structure of a significant portion of the melon genome we set out to
perform massive sequencing of pools of BAC clones. For this, a set of 57 BAC clones from a double haploid line
was sequenced in two pools with the 454 system using both shotgun and paired-end approaches. The final
assembly consists of an estimated 95% of the actual size of the melon BAC clones, with most likely complete
sequences for 50 of the BACs, and a total sequence coverage of 39x. The accuracy of the assembly was assessed
by comparing the previously available Sanger sequence of one of the BACs against its 454 sequence, and the
polymorphisms found involved only 1.7 differences every 10,000 bp that were localized in 15 homopolymeric
regions and two dinucleotide tandem repeats. Overall, the study provides approximately 6.7 Mb or 1.5% of the
melon genome. The analysis of this new data has allowed us to gain further insight into characteristics of the
melon genome such as gene density, average protein length, or microsatellite and transposon content. The
annotation of the BAC sequences revealed a high degree of collinearity and protein sequence identity between
melon and its close relative Cucumis sativus (cucumber). Transposon content analysis of the syntenic regions
suggests that transposition activity after the split of both cucurbit species has been low in cucumber but very high
in melon.
Conclusions: The results presented here show that the strategy followed, which combines shotgun and BAC-end
sequencing together with anchored marker information, is an excellent method for sequencing specific genomic
regions, especially from relatively compact genomes such as that of melon. However, in agreement with other
results, this map-based, BAC approach is confirmed to be an expensive way of sequencing a whole plant genome.
Our results also provide a partial description of the melon genome’s structure. Namely, our analysis shows that the
melon genome is highly collinear with the smaller one of cucumber, the size difference being mainly due to the
expansion of intergenic regions and proliferation of transposable elements.

Background
During recent years an important effort has been made
to increase the tools available for the genomic analysis
of major plant crop species. Since the first genome
sequence available of Arabidopsis thaliana [1], several
others have been published. They include model plants
such as Brachypodium [2] but, increasingly, species that
have been chosen for their importance in agriculture.
For example the rice [3], maize [4], sorghum [5] or soybean [6] genomes are complex but the wealth of genetic
information matches their economic interest. Consequently, for both scientific and economic reasons an
increasing number of plant genomes are being analyzed,
providing important resources useful for their biological
study and breeding.
Several species of interest from both scientific and
economic perspectives are of the Cucurbitaceae family.
These include melon, cucumber, watermelon and
squashes, all of which have been the object of biological
and agricultural interest for centuries. In recent years
various molecular tools have been established. For
instance, the first assembly of the cucumber genome [7],
as well as an increasing number of genetic and genomic
resources developed for melon, a diploid species with a
relatively compact (around 454 Mb [8]) genome [9].
These include tools such as a collection of more than
129,000 ESTs [10,11], BAC libraries [12,13], oligo-based
microarrays [14,15], TILLING and EcoTILLING platforms [16,17], a set of near isogenic lines (NILs) [18]
and several melon genetic maps [11,19-25]. Recently, we
have built a physical map with 0.9x genomic coverage
using both a BAC library and a genetic map previously
developed in our laboratories [http://melonomics.upv.es/
public_files, [26]], the first report of such a genomic
resource of a Cucurbitaceae species so far. This physical
map has also been integrated with the genetic map by
anchoring a number of physical contigs (representing
12% of the melon genome) to 175 known genetic markers. These tools have been useful in the study of interesting agronomical traits such as virus or fungi
resistance [27,28], sex determination [29,30] or the control of ripening [31,32]. These results demonstrate that
molecular genetic approaches can successfully be used
in melon to address basic questions of biological or
agronomic relevance.
More extensive sequence information would be
invaluable to complete the picture of the melon genomic landscape. Indeed, the sequences of only a few
selected genomic regions have been published, totaling
no more than 500 kb [29,33-35] and as of May 2010 no
more than 173 melon genes can be found in GenBank
[11], although a collection of ESTs probably representing more than 70% of the transcriptome is currently
available [11]. The sequencing of the Sorghum genome

has shown the feasibility of sequencing a plant genome
larger than that of melon (730 Mb) using a Sangerbased whole genome shotgun approach [5]. However,
the development of new massively parallel sequencing
technologies allows envisaging a complete sequencing of
the species at higher speed and at lower cost than previous Sanger-based methods. To this end, both whole
genome sequencing approaches as well as map-based,
BAC-to-BAC strategies have been proposed to sequence
plant genomes [36,37].
A small number of research projects involving 454
sequencing of BAC clones have currently been published. In a pioneering study aimed at analyzing how
454 technology would perform on template derived
from large genomes rich in repetitive content, four barley BAC clones 102-120 kb long, two of which had been
previously sequenced using Sanger technology, were
sequenced using 454 [38]. The results showed that
gene-containing regions could efficiently and accurately
be assembled into contigs, even at read coverages as low
as x10.
In a later work eight BACs belonging to a minimum
tiling path covering ca. 1 Mb of the Atlantic salmon
genome were sequenced using 454 technology, the first
published use of paired-end reads for de novo sequence
assembly [39]. This study demonstrated that although
the inclusion of paired-end reads greatly improved
sequence assembly, there remained a significant number of gaps when compared to Sanger-generated
sequencing data. Thus the authors concluded that,
when it comes to de novo sequencing complex genomes, 454 sequencing should be restricted, at least for
the time being, to establishing a set of ordered
sequenced contigs.
Although these studies show that 454 sequencing can
be used to assemble gene-containing regions from genomic sequences using a BAC-to-BAC approach, the cost
of 454 sequencing individual BACs has led to consider
pooling individual clones as a means to increase
throughput and reduce the cost of genome sequencing.
In one published study, 166 BACs totalling 20 Mb were
divided into six pools of overlapping BACs, aided by
paired-end sequencing. These were then used to 454sequence a minimum tiling path which covered an
entire chromosome arm from Oryza barthii [37]. The
report shows that pooling BACs does not increase the
complexity to a degree that makes assembly impossible,
what makes this approach a feasible strategy for reducing the cost of BAC sequencing. In another work 91
barley BAC clones, pooled by sets of 12 or 24, were
sequenced using 454 technology [40]. The introduction
of short sequence tags to fragmented BAC DNA prior
to pooling and sequencing helped to resolve the assembly of multiplex sequencing data by establishing

González et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/246

relationships between BAC clones and sequence reads,
reducing sample complexity.
Here we present a pilot project aiming to sequence
two pools of 35 and 23 melon BACs using the 454 system and a combination of shotgun and paired-end
sequencing. The goal of the study was twofold: obtain
sequence data for a significant proportion of the melon
genome and thus insight into its structure, and test the
strategy of massively sequencing pools of BACs. The
results obtained allow an accuracy assessment of 454
sequence and assembly data as compared with sequence
data produced using classical Sanger technology. Overall, the study provides approximately 7 Mb or 1.5% of
the melon genome as a first step towards the complete
sequence. The analysis of this data has provided insight
into characteristics of the melon genome such as gene
density, transposon content and synteny with cucumber.

Results and discussion
Selection of BAC clones for pooling and sequencing

Two pools of DNA prepared from BACs were
sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing method. These
BACs had been produced from DNA of the double haploid line PIT92 obtained from the cross of PI 161375
and T111 as described in [12].
A set of 178 genetic markers selected from previous
versions of the PI 161375 × T111 melon genetic map
(mainly RFLPs [21] and SNPs [24,31,41,42]) were used
to anchor 845 BAC clones from our genomic library to
the genetic map [26]. Of these, a batch of 32 BACs
anchored to genetic markers distributed throughout the
genome (See Figure 1) were chosen for 454-sequencing.
In order to test the quality of the sequencing and
assembly procedures, one previously Sanger-sequenced
BAC (Cm13_J04, Acc. No. EF657230.1) was selected
from the MRGH63 contig constructed on the basis of
BAC end information [12,35]. We also added to the
pool BACs Cm43_H20 and Cm14_M22 of this contig
that are known to overlap with the former (Additional
file 1 Figure S1). In all, this first pool of BAC clones
consists of 35 BACs mapping to 33 different loci.
A second batch of 20 BACs anchored to genetic markers distributed throughout the genome but different
from those corresponding to the first set of 35 BACs
was also chosen for 454-sequencing (see Figure 1).
Three additional BACs were included in this second
pool: the above-mentioned BAC Cm43_H20, and two
randomly chosen BAC clones not linked to any known
genetic marker (BACs Cm21_I02 and Cm12_I23). In all,
the second pool consists of 23 BACs mapping to at least
21 different genetic loci.
In all, the selected two sets of BACs represent an estimated 7.5 Mb of the melon genome, based on BAC
library average insert size. The complete list of selected

BAC clones, together with their corresponding genetic
markers can be found in Table 1. Information regarding
genetic map position, marker type and references of the
genetic markers can be found in the Additional File 2
Table S1.
Sequencing and assembly

Both shotgun and 3 kb paired-end libraries were constructed for each pool of BACs and the sequencing was
carried out independently as described in the Methods
section. A summary with the details of the different 454
runs, including number of reads, total length and average read size can be found in Table 2. In total, over one
million reads representing 274 Mb of sequence from the
35 BACs pool and over 400,000 reads totaling 105 Mb
from the 23 BACs pool were produced. The raw data
(sff files) have been deposited in the SRA archive of the
NCBI under the accession number SRA024701.1.
A global assembly of all reads from both BAC pools
was performed as described in the Methods section. In
addition, two independent assemblies were performed
using reads from each pool. The reduced complexity in
the separate assemblies of individual pools of BACs
would suggest a more accurate assembly. Indeed, the
number of contigs slightly increases and their size
decreases in the global assembly, but overall, the result
of the global assembly resembles the results from the
assemblies of the individual BAC pools, except for a few
cases. For example, in the case of the BAC Cm54_I13,
we obtained a single scaffold in the 35 BACs pool
assembly corresponding to two scaffolds from the global
assembly. What separates the two scaffolds (when
aligned to the single one) is a 273 bp gap flanked by
several TA motives. On the other hand, scaffold00040
from the global assembly contained 631 additional
nucleotides and a 522 bp long gap flanked by AT
repeats at one of its extremes compared to its counterpart scaffold from the 23 BACs pool assembly. As we
do not have a reference genome, we considered the larger scaffold as reference. A detailed summary of the
whole process with the metrics of the three assemblies
can be found in Table 3. Based on this information, we
conclude that for assembling a modest number of BACs
it is not worth separating them in smaller pools
(increasing the sequencing costs), and if reduction of
complexity is imperative (when dealing with very repetitive genomes, for example) then the extreme approach
could be considered and barcode each BAC.
The assignment of contigs and scaffolds to BACs was
performed using anchored genetic markers and BACend sequences as described in the Methods section.
Also, the information from the C. melo FPC physical
map [26] together with BAC-end sequences from some
BAC clones in FPC contigs allowed us to manually edit

two scaffolds of the final assembly. The physical map
was also useful in assigning BACs Cm21_I08 and
Cm12_I23 to their corresponding scaffolds, as no
genetic markers correspond to these BACs. Finally, the
previously Sanger-sequenced BAC Cm60_K17 (Acc. No.:
AF499727.1, [12]) was added to the alignment of the
sequenced BACs from the MRGH63 contig in order to
extend the sequence used for subsequent analysis (see
Additional file 1 Figure S1).
The final assembly consists of 73 scaffolds totaling 6.3
Mb, 73% of which are longer than 60 kb, with average
scaffold size 86.8 kb and the largest scaffold 304 kb
long; also, 744 unscaffolded contigs totaling 382 kb of
sequence remain (Table 3). The sequence coverage of
the final assembly is 39x, calculated as the ratio between
the total length of the sequence reads and the assembly

sequence length. Paired-end reads are used in the process of sequence assembly to join contigs (formed by
read alignments) in structures called scaffolds, which
represent sorted and correctly orientated contigs that
are separated by gaps which sizes are estimated based
on the average paired-end size (see, for example, [39]).
The N50 contig size of our assembly was rather small
(30.6 kb) compared to the N50 scaffold size (107.6 kb).
This result confirms the importance of paired-ends
when it comes to assembling a complex genome using
454 sequences.
Regarding the assignment of sequences to particular
BACs, BAC Cm47_C02 could not be assigned to any
scaffold or contig and BAC Cm46_I24 was assigned to a
small contig of less than 1 kb using the genetic marker
sequence information, and to another two small scaffolds

using both BAC-end sequences. All other BACs were
assigned to a unique scaffold or contig, two of which
were smaller than 15 kb, another five in the 60-90 kb
range while the rest was over 90 kb long (Table 1).
The search for BAC ends in the final set of contigs
and scaffolds suggests that at least 42 scaffolds cover the
complete sequence of 44 BACs (including the three
BACs belonging to the scaffold MRGH63). An average
of seven stretches of Ns (produced as a result of contig
scaffolding) was found per scaffold and the total length
of all Ns accounts for 4.8% of the final assembly length
(see Additional file 3 Table S2). Nine additional scaffolds assigned to as many BAC clones were found to
contain only one BAC border each; however, six of
these scaffolds were bigger than 100 kb, and so they
probably represent complete BAC sequences but for

small deletions at their borders, while the rest measured
between 60 and 80 kb and could represent a significant
proportion of their correspondent BAC sequences.
Finally, BAC borders were absent from two BAC
sequences (corresponding to BACs Cm57_M11 and
Cm59_C10), both smaller than 11 kb and therefore
most likely incomplete.
As a summary, of a total of 57 pooled BACs, most
likely complete sequences were produced for 50 BAC
clones, three were incomplete but in the range of 6080 kb and four BACs were attributed very limited
sequence information. As the assignment was performed using a small amount of sequence information,
namely the marker and BAC-end sequences (not available for all BACs), any sequence shorter than the full
BAC insert size has few chances of being assigned to

any particular BAC. This is obvious for the BAC
Cm46_I24 where with each BAC-end sequence and the
marker sequence we assign three rather small
sequences (Additional file 3 Table S2). In our results, a
total of 374 kb distributed in 20 contigs/scaffolds
longer than 2,000 bp remained unassigned after the
final assembly and could account for most of the
sequence of those four problematic BACs. All markers
but one (F149), and all available BAC-end sequences
but three, matched against a contig or scaffold. The
nucleotide sequences of contigs and scaffolds assigned
to BACs as well as of those unassigned assembly
sequences larger than 2 kb have been deposited in the
GenBank database and their accession numbers can be
found in the Additional file 3 Table S2.
The number of gaps per Mb (61) and the estimated
amount of missed sequence in our main assembly (5%)
are lower than those values from the above-mentioned
studies using 454 sequencing of BAC clones [37-39], a
fact most probably due to the absence of paired-end
sequencing in [38,40], to the short reads that were being
produced at the erlier stages of 454 technology (100 bp
on average) [38], to the complexity of the barley and salmon genomes as compared with melon’s [38-40], and to
the higher amount of assembled sequence in the case of
O. barthii [37]. In summary, although using shotgun
and paired-end libraries of pooled BACs remains a
costly proposition for sequencing a whole genome, it is
well adapted to certain situations. Indeed, our results

show that it is a feasible and cost-efficient strategy for
sequencing particular regions of interest of relatively
compact genomes like that of melon. This approach
would also be useful in genome walking strategies for
gene cloning, or resolving a particular region where a
physical map is available.
Sequence accuracy assessment

The quality of the final assembly was assessed by comparing the sequence from scaffold MRGH63 corresponding to BAC Cm13_J04 (Additional file 1 Figure
S1) against the 99 kb-long sequence of the same BAC
previously obtained using a shotgun-Sanger approach
[35]. Table 4 shows the differences between the Sanger
and 454 sequences. Apart from five small stretches of
Ns representing 3.6% of the BAC length, the only other
discrepancies are 15 homopolymeric regions and two
dinucleotide tandem repeats. The differences in homopolymeric regions were found in 15 of the 26 mononucleotide repeats longer than 11 nt, and in all cases but
one the 454 repeat resulted to be one to three nucleotides shorter than the Sanger sequence. It is interesting
to note that no differences were found in the 896 mononucleotide repeats shorter than 11 nt. The discrepancies
in dinucleotide tandem repeats affected two (CT)15 and
(GA)21 microsatellites.
It has been already described that Sanger and 454
technologies have a generally comparable level of accuracy regarding genic regions or other single-copy

Number of homopolymers in the 454 sequence showing differences with the corresponding homopolymers in the Sanger sequence

sequences, homopolymeric stretches being the main
source of read errors in both techniques when low copy
regions are considered [37,38,43,44]. Previous reports
have also shown that longer stretches of A and T are
more likely to cause problem when using pyrosequencing [38]. Indeed, there is a tendency of homopolymers
to be shorter in the 454 sequence than in the Sanger
reads, although at least a report exists where the
stretches were consistently found to be one nucleotide
longer in the 454 sequences [38,43]. In summary, the
polymorphisms detected between the melon 454 and
Sanger sequences in a 100 kb interval involved only 1.7
differences every 10,000 bp, a figure close to previously
reported values [37,38].
Besides homopolymers, repetitive DNA is known to
be more problematic for 454 sequencing than for Sanger due to the shorter length of the 454 reads. Repetitive regions can be collapsed into one consensus
contig causing gaps to appear in the final assembly.
This may be the main reason behind the gaps accounting for an estimated loss of ca. 5% of melon sequence
in our final assembly. Indeed, all five stretches of Ns in
Cm13_J04 consensus sequence are found in two
regions that contain repetitive sequences such as a
transposable element and a TIR-NBS-LRR resistance
gene (data not shown).

Sequence annotation

Ab initio prediction of protein coding, tRNA and rRNA
genes was carried out as described in the Methods chapter. The predictions were validated by homology with
protein sequences at NCBI databases and with ESTs
from the melon unigene v3 database at ICUGI [11]. A
census of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was also performed using the msatcommander software.
A summary of the sequence and annotation features
of all 58 contigs and scaffolds longer than 20 kb, representing 6.2 Mb of genomic sequence, can be found in
Table 5. As a whole, 616 protein coding genes (excluding transposons) were predicted, of which 73.2% were
found to show homology with known C. melo ESTs.
The average gene density is estimated to be 9.9 genes
for each 100 kb but varies on the 2-20 range when individual scaffolds are considered; the average intron and
exon length are respectively 393 bp and 238 bp and
number of exons per gene is 4.9, with 46% of coding
sequence being introns. Predicted proteins were 386 aa
long on average. Regarding SSRs, 4,430 microsatellites
were found representing 1.25% of the total sequence,
about one SSR every 1.3 kb. The GC content composition was 33%, eleven tRNA genes were found in five
BAC clones and no rRNA genes could be found in the
analyzed sequence. Additional file 3 Table S2 contains a

more detailed report of the individual characteristics of
each scaffold or contig larger than 2 kb.
The recent publication of the Cucumber sativus genome sequence begs the comparison of sequence and
annotation characteristics of both cucurbit species [7].
Overall, the statistics of protein-coding genes from both
cucurbits are quite similar. The predictions for the
cucumber genome are a gene density of 10 per 100 kb,
mean protein length of 349 amino acids, average number of exons per gene, exon length and intron length of
4.8, 238 bp and 483 bp, respectively, and tRNA gene
density of 2.9 per Mb. While the gene density, mean
exon length and average number of exons per gene are
very similar in both species, in cucumber the protein
length is only slightly smaller (0.9x), and mean intron
length is just 1.2 times greater.
The apparent similar gene density, together with the
similarity in average protein length, number of exons
and average exon and intron lengths, seems contradictory with the difference in genome size between both
species. Indeed, the estimated size of the melon genome
is 1.3x that of cucumber [7,9]. It has to be taken into
account, however, that the cucumber gene density was
calculated based on as much as 70% of the complete
genomic sequence, which most probably included genepoor regions, while the melon gene density has been
estimated using BAC clones that have gene- or ESTbased genetic markers and thus probably represent
gene-rich regions. Therefore, it might be the case that
the actual melon gene density is lower than that of

cucumber, hypothesis that is supported by the analysis
of syntenic regions from both genomes (see below in
the “Analysis of microsynteny” section).
Transposon content of the sequenced BACs

Transposons were annotated using sequence similarity
searches with previously characterized transposons as
well as by Ab initio methods based on transposon structural characteristics. As expected, most of the elements
found belong to the retrotransposon class of mobile elements, with the Gypsy family being the most represented. However, the fraction of the genome these
elements occupy is apparently smaller than in other
genomes of similar size. Indeed, while retrotransposons
account for 20% of the genomes of grapevine (504.6
Mb) and Lotus japonicus (472 Mb) [45,46], these elements seem to account for only 7.2% of the melon genome (454 Mb) (Table. 6). Retrotransposons are not
randomly distributed in genomes and while some elements preferentially integrate in gene-rich regions (see
for example [47]), others target heterochromatic regions
for integration, in particular those belonging to the
Gypsy family which are usually present at higher copy
number [48]. Thus, the apparent low retrotransposon
copy number could be due to the fact that heterochromatic regions are under-represented in the 1.5% fraction
of the genome analyzed, which was selected to be representative of the gene-rich regions of the melon genome.
We have also found representatives of all the major
families of DNA transposons, including CACTA, MULE,

Analysis of microsynteny

Four of the longest scaffolds (9, 15, 77 and MRGH63,
totalling 782 kb) were used to search the cucumber genome assembly [50] for syntenic regions, as described in
the Methods section. As it can be expected from the
close phylogenetic relatedness of these two species, a
high degree of collinearity was found in all four regions
analysed (Figure 2). The relative syntenic quality (see
the Methods section) ranged from 84% (for scaffold
MRGH63) to 97% (for scaffold00015), averaging 92%,
and the homologous protein sequences rendered in all
cases e-values lower than 1E-46 with an average identity
of 87% when aligned using BLASTP (see Additional file
4 Table S3). Regarding the annotation characteristics of
the predicted genes, the average protein lengths of the
four melon regions analyzed were x0.8-x1.2 those of
cucumber, with the syntenic melon genes being, as an
average, only x0.96 smaller than the cucumber ones; the
average number of exons of the melon syntenic regions
were x0.84-x1.1 those of the cucumber regions, with the
syntenic melon genes having, as an average, only x0.92
less exons than the cucumber ones; also, although the
average exon length of all syntenic melon genes was
almost identical to that of cucumber, the average
intron length of the syntenic melon genes was x1.3
that of their cucumber counterparts (Additional file 4
Table S3).
Besides, the orientation of the putative syntenic genes
was found to be conserved in all cases. However, a

From the analysis of all contigs and scaffolds longer than 2 kb

number of genes were duplicated in melon. These
included the expansion of a cluster of NBS-LRR genes
present in scaffold MRGH63, which is particularly interesting as the Vat gene and other disease resistance
genes have been mapped to this region [33]. NBS-LRR
genes are the main family of resistance genes in plants,
and are frequently found in clusters [51]. Highly conserved gene order and content together with 95% of
sequence similarity over coding regions has already been
reported by Huang et al. based on the comparison of
four sequenced BAC clones against the sequenced
cucumber genome [7].
Besides the duplication of several genes, a major difference between cucumber and melon syntenic regions
is the number of transposon insertions [Figure 2]. The
cucumber sequences analysed contain only two retrotransposon insertions, one of which seems very old as it
is highly degenerated. On the contrary, the melon syntenic regions contain three DNA transposons (two hATs
and one MULE) and 15 retrotransposons (most of them
from the Gypsy superfamily), including the degenerated
retrotransposon found in cucumber. In particular, transposon activity appears to account for the expansion of
ca. 60 kb in the melon scaffold0077 relative to its
cucumber counterpart. In scaffold MRGH63, a localised
transposon number amplification together with duplication of melon resistance gene homologs (see below)
accounts for an 88 kb-long expansion of the sequence
of melon relative to that of cucumber. Also, transposons
were found to be putatively involved in gene disruption
processes in scaffolds 9 and MRGH63.
These results suggest that transposition activity after
the divergence of the two ancestors of melon and
cucumber has been low in cucumber but very high in
melon. This transposon amplification and mobilization
could be a reason for the 1.8× increase in size of the
melon syntenic regions. Bearing in mind that the melon
genome is estimated to be 1.3× greater that of cucumber, it can tentatively be assumed that transposon activity may be mainly responsible for that difference in
genome sizes.
It is interesting to note that almost half of the melon
specific transposons are interspersed with NBS-LRR predicted genes that potentially form resistance gene clusters. Gene duplications and transposon insertions have
been proposed to provide a structural environment that
permits unequal crossovers and interlocus gene conversion allowing rapid evolution of resistance genes [51]. In
addition, the presence of active retrotransposons interspersed with resistance genes may also contribute to the
resistance gene regulation by silencing related mechanisms [52]. A detailed analysis of syntenic regions containing putative resistance genes between melon and
cucumber may provide new information on the

new resistances in cultivated crops.

Conclusion
A set of 57 BAC clones from a double haploid line of
melon was sequenced in two pools with the 454 system using both shotgun and paired-end approaches
followed by bioinformatic assembly of the fragments
obtained. From this assembly it was possible to obtain
most likely complete sequences for 50 of these BACs,
as judged by the length and the presence of BAC-end
sequences, with a final coverage of 39×. The accuracy
of the assembly was excellent, compared with a BAC
clone already sequenced with the Sanger method,
except in a small number of repetitive sequences, consistent with other 454 sequencing projects [37,38].
These results show that 454-sequencing of pooled

BACs, using both shotgun and paired-end libraries, is
a feasible strategy for sequencing long stretches of
genomic sequence from medium-size genomes such as
that of melon. However, correction using other
sequencing techniques would be needed for medium
to high repetitive content regions.
The analysis of the fraction (around 1.5%) of the
melon genome obtained provides a pilot overview of
this species’ genomic structure. Predicted gene annotations were confirmed in 73% of the cases by comparison
with EST collections. This is probably a good measure
of the completeness of the transcriptome information
currently available for this species. The analysis of the
sequences provides an interesting overview of the features such as microsatellite content, gene density and
average protein length, revealing similarity to that of its
close relative, cucumber.

Finally, the comparison of four melon regions totalling
782 kb against the genomic sequence of cucumber (the
only other Cucurbit species where a draft genome
sequence is available) reveals a high degree of collinearity between both species. The analysis of the detected
syntenic regions suggests that the size difference of the
two genomes is due to the expansion of intergenic
regions, mainly through the activity of transposable elements in melon after the divergence of the two species.
It is particularly interesting to note that almost half of
the detected melon-specific transposons are interspersed
with NBS-LRR predicted genes that potentially form
resistance gene clusters. We have confirmed the utility
of this sequencing method for small genomic fractions,
and the analysis of the data thus obtained has expanded
our understanding of the melon genome structure and
the mechanisms underlying its evolution.

Methods
BAC library

A BamHI BAC library from the double-haploid melon
line ‘PIT92’ (PI 161375 × T111) was previously developed
in our laboratory using pECBAC1 as cloning vector [[12],
http://hbz7.tamu.edu/homelinks/bac_est/vector/
sequence/sequence.htm]. With 23,040 BAC clones distributed in sixty 384-well plates, an average insert size of
139 kb and 20% empty clones, the library represents 5.7
genomic equivalents of the haploid melon genome.
DNA extraction

Two pools of 35 and 23 BACs were selected for the analysis. Individual preinocules were grown on 1 ml 1 × LB
plus 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 300 rpm, 37°C, for 17
h. The following day, 30 μl of each BAC clone from the
preinocules were added into 50 ml tubes containing 20 ml
1 × LB plus 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and grown at 37°
C, 300 rpm for 15 h. The grown cultures were then mixed
to produce two separate volumes representing the two
BAC pools and the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.
Genomic DNA-free BAC DNA extraction was performed using the QIAGEN® Large-Construct Kit (Cat.
No. 12462) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Both final DNA pellets were resuspended in 500 μl TE
pH 8.0 each.
DNA sequencing

All sequencing was performed with a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer machine using FLX chemistry. Two
DNA extractions were done from the 35-BACs pool,
one to create a shotgun library and the other one to create a 3 kb paired-end library. The shotgun library was
used for one titration run and one full run performed
by Lifequencing S. L. at their premises in Valencia,

Page 12 of 15

Spain. The paired-end library was sequenced on two
quarters of a plate followed by a full run performed at
our 454 sequencing facility. For the 23-BACs pool, one
DNA extraction was done which served to create a shotgun and a 3 kb paired-end library. The shotgun library
was sequenced with a full run while the paired-end
library was sequenced on three eighths of a plate; both
runs were performed at our 454 sequencing facility.
Sequence assembly

Sequence assembly was done using Newbler version 2.3
with default parameters. Reads from all BACs were processed together in one assembly run. The sequence of E.
coli strain DH10B (NC 010473.1) was used as screening
database and the vector pECBAC1 as trimming database,
but without 30 bp of sequence flanking either side of the
BamHI restriction site (see below) http://hbz7.tamu.edu/
homelinks/bac_est/vector/sequence/sequence.htm. Additional assemblies of each BAC pool were independently
done using Newbler versions 2.3 and 2.0 (data now
shown); results of these assemblies served for comparison
purposes and only in some cases helped to manually correct some scaffolds in the global assembly.
Sequences of the genetic markers previously anchored
to the analyzed BACs as well as some BAC-end
sequences previously available in our laboratories (GenBank Acc. Nos. can be found in the Additional file 3
Table S2) were used to assign a sequence to a specific
BAC. Based on this information, in some cases we could
join two scaffolds that corresponded to the same BAC
into a single superscaffold that would represent the
whole BAC insert. In these cases a gap was introduced
between the scaffolds so that the final sequence had the
size of the average insert size of the BAC library. The
manually introduced gaps accounted for 7.25% of all the
gaps in the assembly. The sizes of these gaps in nucleotides are as follow: 500 in Scaffold52B05; 1,209 in Scaffold45K01; 1,538 in Scaffold11I12; 1,831 in
Scaffold54E01; 2,288 in Scaffold55F19; 2,586 in Scaffold59B11; and 12,064 in Scaffold54J04.
In order to study how many of the assembled contigs
and scaffolds represented the complete sequence of
BACs, those sequences were searched for BAC borders
in the following ways: 1) by searching at their extremes
the 30 bp sequence corresponding to pECBAC1; 2) by
blasting against individual reads containing the 30 bp
sequence and 3) by blasting against BAC-end sequences
that were already available for some of the sequenced
BACs [see Additional File 3 Table S2].
Sequence annotation

Ab initio gene prediction was performed using the command-line version of Augustus 2.3 software http://
augustus.gobics.de/ using A. thaliana as plant model.

González et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/246

The melon unigene v3 collection at ICUGI [11] was
used to improve the Augustus prediction, setting the
minimum identity parameter to 92. In some cases, the
FGENESH annotation software at http://linux1.softberry.
com/berry.phtml, with Arabidopsis as plant model, was
used to complement or improve the Augustus annotation. The predicted coding sequences were checked
against the non-redundant protein databases at NCBI
using BLASTP searching for protein homologs.
tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE
1.21 software http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/ and
rRNA genes were identified with RNAmmer 1.2 server
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RNAmmer/. Simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) were searched for using the
msatcommander 0.8.2 software http://code.google.com/
p/msatcommander/; the minimum repeat lengths considered were: 10 bp (mononucleotides), 12 bp (di- and
trinucleotides), 16 bp (tetranucleotides), 20 bp (pentanucleotides) and 24 bp (hexanucleotides).
Transposons were annotated using Ab initio and
sequence similarity searches integrated in a pipeline
based on Dawgpaws [53]. The programs used for de
novo prediction of LTR retrotransposons included
LTR_STRUC [54], LTR_finder [55] and LTR_seq [56],
and vary in the type of structures they look for, their
stringency and their search algorithms. The homologybased approach consisted of searching for sequences
that show a high degree of similarity to known transposons. For this, we compiled nucleotide databases of
already characterized transposons obtained from the
RepBase database [57] as well as NCBI [58]. Likewise,
we constructed protein sequence databases of transposases from various transposon families, searching NCBI
for combinations of keywords such as “transposase” and
“CACTA”, “hAT”, “Mariner”, “Mutator” or “PIF”. This
approach is useful for corroborating results obtained
from the de novo programs, as well as identifying other
types of transposons such as DNA transposons. The
output of these various programs was converted into
gff3 format and uploaded into the Apollo genome
viewer and annotation tool [59], along with the gene
annotations, for manual curation. As a first step, each
scaffold was examined and putative transposons were
identified according to the computational evidence.
These were then manually inspected to look for LTRs
or TIRs, query NCBI to determine which family they
belong to, and resolve instances of nested or truncated
elements. These bona fide transposons were used to
query the set of scaffolds in similarity searches, aiming
at identifying partial or degenerated copies and defining
transposon families. This third step is particularly relevant when a large amount of sequence data is available,
as aligning many copies of an element aids to precisely
define its borders and find consensus sequences. At this

Page 13 of 15

point, with the current fraction of the genome available,
we have not found enough copies of a single element to
perform this part of the analysis.
Synteny analysis

Four annotated melon scaffolds were analysed for homology with the Cucumis sativus genome assembly deposited
in Phytozome v5 [50], using the BLASTN algorithm. The
selected cucumber regions were annotated the same way
as the melon BACs. Pairs of homologous genes were tentatively selected on the basis of the gene annotation and
then confirmed by performing BLASTP alignments of
the correspondent predicted proteins. Syntenic regions
were defined as contiguous regions containing two or
more homologous genes in C. melo and C. sativus, irrespective of orientation and exact order of genes, based on
the results of BLASTP comparisons. The relative syntenic
quality in a region, expressed as a percentage, was calculated by dividing the sum of the conserved genes in both
syntenic regions by the sum of the total number of genes
in both regions, excluding transposable elements and collapsing tandem duplications [60].

Note
The C. melo BAC nucleotide sequences are available in
the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers HM854749-HM854824. The raw data can
be found in the SRA archive of the NCBI under the
accession number SRA024701.1.
