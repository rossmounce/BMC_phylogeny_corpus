Abstract
Background: Hair is unique to mammals. Keratin associated proteins (KRTAPs), which contain
two major groups: high/ultrahigh cysteine and high glycine-tyrosine, are one of the major
components of hair and play essential roles in the formation of rigid and resistant hair shafts.
Results: The KRTAP family was identified as being unique to mammals, and near-complete KRTAP
gene repertoires for eight mammalian genomes were characterized in this study. An expanded
KRTAP gene repertoire was found in rodents. Surprisingly, humans have a similar number of genes
as other primates despite the relative hairlessness of humans. We identified several new subfamilies
not previously reported in the high/ultrahigh cysteine KRTAP genes. Genes in many subfamilies of
the high/ultrahigh cysteine KRTAP genes have evolved by concerted evolution with frequent gene
conversion events, yielding a higher GC base content for these gene sequences. In contrast, the
high glycine-tyrosine KRTAP genes have evolved more dynamically, with fewer gene conversion
events and thus have a lower GC base content, possibly due to positive selection.
Conclusion: Most of the subfamilies emerged early in the evolution of mammals, thus we propose
that the mammalian ancestor should have a diverse KRTAP gene repertoire. We propose that hair
content characteristics have evolved and diverged rapidly among mammals because of rapid
divergent evolution of KRTAPs between species. In contrast, subfamilies of KRTAP genes have
been homogenized within each species due to concerted evolution.

Background
The availability of the rapidly increasing number of
genome sequences provides opportunities for investigators to study evolutionary patterns that potentially
account for morphological characteristics, and suggest the
genetic basis for variation in phenotypes. In particular,
gene families in which duplications, rate variation and
pseudogenization occur frequently are likely involved in

functional innovation and adaptation [1]. Examples of
such gene families are those involved in the perception
systems, for example, the odorant receptors [2-4], the
vomeronasal receptors [5-8], and the sweet/umami and
bitter receptors [9-12]. Furthermore, these studies should
facilitate our understanding of the general evolutionary
trends in genomic complexity and lineage-specific adaptation [1]. Here, we studied the evolutionary patterns of the

keratin associated protein (KRTAP) gene family, whose
encoded proteins are major components of hair, with the
goal of revealing the underlying basis for unique mammalian hair and its phenotypic diversity.
Hair is a unique character found on all mammals, but not
on other animals, where it plays a crucial role in the retention of heat within these homoiotherms and presumably
contributed significantly to the rapid radiation of mammals and their rise to become the dominant terrestrial vertebrate [13]. Other functions of hair include sexual
dimorphism, attraction of mates, and protection of skin
[14]. An interesting event in hair evolution has been its
loss in humans [15,16], however; humans actually have a
similar density of hair follicles to that seen in apes [15].
Comparative studies have concluded that hair presents
similar structure and modality of growth throughout
mammals [17-19]. For example, the overall ultrastructure
of hair and the distribution of keratins in monotremes are
similar to that of marsupial and placental mammals [18],
and the localization of acidic and basic keratins in marsupial hairs is similar to that in placentals [19]. However,
most studies have focused on keratins rather than the keratin associated proteins.
The major components of hair are alpha-keratins and keratin associated proteins, each of which are encoded by
multigene families. The alpha-keratins include two multigene subfamilies, type I (acidic) and type II (basic)
[20,21], and form the intermediate filament cytoskeleton
of all epithelia providing stability against stress [22]. In
humans, the alpha-keratin gene family has been extensively studied demonstrating that there are 54 functional
genes that are clustered on chromosomes 12q13.13 and
17q21.2 that show differing expression patterns during
hair development [23]. Hair keratins form an intermediate filament (IF) network by co-polymerization of type I
and type II members, in trichocytes, which are cells that
populate the central hair-forming compartment of the
anagen hair follicle [24,25]. In the hair cortex, hair keratins IFs are embedded in an in interfilamentous matrix,
which consists of hair keratin-associated proteins (KATAP,
usually abbreviated as KAP) [26]. KRTAP contains two
major groups: high/ultrahigh cysteine (HS) and high glycine-tyrosine (HGT) that are considered to have originated independently, and are essential for the formation
of rigid and resistant hair shafts through their extensive
disulfide bond cross-linking with the abundant cysteine
residues of hair keratins or hydrophobic interactions with
keratins [23,26-28]. The genes have been grouped into 27
subfamilies, termed KRTAP1 to KRTAP27, based upon
phylogeny [23,29]. In humans, about 100 KRTAP genes
are identified, that are in five tandemly arranged clusters
(chromosomal regions 11p15.5, 11q13.4, 17q21.2,
21q22.1, and 21q22.3) [30-34]. Previous research on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/241

KRTAP genes has focused on their function and expression, with little emphasis on the origin and evolution of
this gene family. Here, we investigate the evolution of the
KRTAP gene family, including phylogeny and classification, and the mechanisms involved, such as gene duplication, gene conversion, in our endeavor to resolve hair's
evolutionary history and to explain the diversity observed
in extant mammals. We find different repertoires among
mammals which potentially explain the differing hair features of different lineages. An expanded KRTAP gene repertoire was found in rodents. Surprisingly, despite the lack
of hair, human had a similar number of genes with other
primates. Large-scale gene conversion events were
detected in high cysteine KRTAP but fewer in high glycine/
tyrosine, and the latter genes evolve more dynamically.
Compared to the conserved structure and modality of
keratins within mammals, the significant divergence of
characteristics of hair among placental, marsupial and
monotreme species is likely due to interspecific divergence of KRTAP sequences.

Results
Inventory of KRTAP genes in mammals
The recent rapid increase in the availability of comparative genomic data is facilitating the illumination of evolutionary features of organisms. Particularly, mammals are
well represented with data from: placental mammals
including primates – human [35], chimpanzee [36] and
rhesus macaque [37]; rodents – mouse [38] and rat [39];
carnivore – dog [40]; a marsupial, the opossum [41]; and
a monotreme, the duck-billed platypus [42].

Some
gene
sequences
in
GenBank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov have been submitted independently by several researchers. KRTAP genes have been
shown to have size polymorphism within populations
[43-45], and sequences from different individuals at these
loci are diverse and may not align well. For instance, we
identified that a KRTAP gene cluster in Contig:
NT_113931 actually corresponds to the KRTAP region on
Chr17 of the human genome, except that it differs in
sequence length for several KRTAP genes. Therefore, we
removed the genes from Contig: NT_113931 from our
analyses. Furthermore, since many of the draft genome
sequences were generated by whole genome shotgun
assembly, we took care to identify redundant KRTAP
sequences and excluded these from our analysis.
Since KRTAP genes are clustered as tandem arrays at just a
few chromosomal locations and the genome sequences
have high coverage (except platypus), we should be able
to obtain near-complete and non-redundant KRTAP gene
inventories from these mammalian genomes after indepth screening and examination (summarized in additional file 1). In contrast to the mammalian genomes, we

were unable to identify any KRTAP-like sequences from
the chicken, lizard, Xenopus tropicalis or zebrafish
genomes. We also note that the keratin associated protein
10-4 annotated in the chicken genome in GenBank (gene
id: 425968) is actually an oncogenic transcription factor
(JAC), and is not KRTAP-like nor has homology with any
mammalian KRTAP sequences. As an alternative strategy
to identify KRTAP genes in the chicken, we used
Mapviewer from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
mapview/ to identify genes flanking the KRTAP gene clusters in mammals and searched the chicken genome using
BLAST to identify orthologous genomic regions. While
conserved synteny of the flanking genes was observed
within the chicken genome, KRTAP-like genes could not
be found. These results indicate that the KRTAP gene clusters are unique to mammals and have been inserted into
in the ancestral mammalian genome.
We classified our identified KRTAP gene sequences into
two categories, intact and pseudo-genes. Pseudogenes are
defined as coding sequences that are disrupted by
frameshifts and/or stop codons. In placental mammals,
rodents appear to contain an expanded KRTAP gene repertoire with a lower level of pseudogenization relative to
other mammals both in high (including ultrahigh)
cysteine and high glycine KRTAPs (fig. 1). Surprisingly,
although humans have the lowest number of intact genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/241

(101) and the highest number of pseudogenes (21, 17.2%
of total number), the complete repertoire (122) is still
similar in number to that of other mammals. Potentially,
changes in the levels of expression of KRTAP genes may
account for the relative hairlessness of humans. Opossum
has a slightly larger repertoire of genes, and the repertoire
in platypus is probably much larger than that we reported,
since a more complete genome sequence is required to
accurately define gene number.
Classification of KRTAP gene family, and tandem cluster in
the genomes
Without the influence of evolutionary constraint, pseudogenes evolve faster then functional genes. Accordingly,
substitution bias could generate errors in constructing
phylogenies; therefore all pseudogenes were excluded
from our preliminary analysis on subfamily classification.
The high levels of divergence between species and/or subgroups and the homogenization within them caused by
frequent gene conversion (see following text), may also
introduce a bias into the construction of a phylogeny of
all of the high cysteine KRTAPs. To circumvent this problem, we first constructed a neighbor-joining tree of just
the human high cysteine KRTAP protein sequences, and
used this phylogeny to identify subfamilies (Additional
file 2: figure 1). The majority of genes for each subfamily
were found as subfamily-specific tandem cluster in the

genome (Additional file 2: figure 1 and Additional file 1).
Genes with close relationships in our phylogeny tended to
be most closely linked in the genome. This positive correlation between phylogeny and chromosomal location has
previously been observed in several other gene families
[46,47]. Thus we used chromosomal location in combination with phylogeny to refine our subfamily classification.
In addition we also considered amino acid sequence composition to generate our final classification. Next we constructed phylogenies of all of the high cysteine KRTAPs for
each species alone (Additional file 2: figures 2–8), or combined with the human sequences (Additional file 2: figures 9–15), as well as a phylogeny of the combined mouse
and rat sequences (Additional file 2: figure 16). From
these phylogenies, together with chromosomal location
and amino acid composition, we could identify several
new subfamilies not reported previously, which we name
subfamilies 28–35. Additionally, we grouped the previously characterized subfamilies 14 and 15 into subfamily
13 based on our phylogeny. In a similar manner, we
grouped the glycine-tyrosine rich KRTAPs into 6 subfamilies (subfamilies 6, 7, 8, 19, 20 and 21) based on the
phylogenetic tree (fig. 2, and Additional file 2: figure 17).
The previously defined human subfamily 22 was combined with subfamily 19. Our recommendations have
been endorsed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [48].
Our phylogeny of intact genes indicated that genes within
subfamilies are clustered in the genomic location (fig. 3,
and Additional file 1). When pseudogenes were included
in the phylogenetic analysis they were also found to be
most closely related to their genomic neighbors. To classify interrupted genes that were annotated in unmapped
(i.e., unassembled) genomic locations, BLAST was performed against the non-redundant database in GenBank
to identify the best hit KRTAP genes, and phylogenetic
classification of these were used to help classify the pseudogenes.
It should be noted that there is typically only about one
gene per species for subfamilies 16, 24–27, and 29 (table
1), thus, these subfamilies were not used for our subsequent analysis for gene conversion.
Chromosome distribution of KRTAP
KRTAP genes are distributed mainly at five genomic
regions in placental and marsupial genomes: Cluster 1
contains genes from subfamilies KRTAP 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 17,
16, and 29. Cluster 2 contains genes from subfamilies 13,
24–27 and all glycine-tyrosine rich KRTAPs. Cluster 3 possesses genes from subfamilies 10 and 12. Cluster 4
encodes genes of subfamily 28. Cluster 5 corresponds to
genes of subfamily 5 (fig. 3). Some variation in gene distribution is observed in some species. In rodents, the new

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/241

subfamilies 30 and 31 have been inserted into the
genomic locations of subfamilies 4 and 9 respectively.
Paralogous KRTAP gene clusters have been mapped to
human chromosomes 11q13 and chr11p15, with genes
residing in these two clusters intermingled in the phylogeny (fig. 3.). Thus suggests that the KRTAP gene cluster at
11q13 is derived from 11p15 potentially representing a
segmental duplication. The new chromosome 11q13 gene
cluster is unique to primates as an orthologous region is
also found in the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque
genomes but not in others mammals (additional file 1).
In a similar manner the dog genome has generated a new
cluster on chromosome 31 that includes three genes, one
from subfamily 10 and two from subfamily 12. Similar
mechanisms for the origin of new genes at new genomic
locations have been observed for other gene families
[49,50].
Amino acid composition comparison of KRTAP subfamilies
Previous research has classified the keratin associated proteins by their amino acid composition into three major
groups: high-sulfur (~16–30% cysteine), ultra-high sulfur
(> 30% cysteine), and high-glycine/tyrosine [26]. Subfamilies 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 16, 29 and 31, belong to the highsulfur group; subfamilies 4, 5, 9, 17, 28, 30, 32 and 33 are
ultra-high sulfur (table 2). Many high cysteine genes also
have a high content of serine. Interestingly, subfamilies
11, 13, 24–27, 29, 34 and 35 have high serine content but
relative low cysteine (table 2). The newly identified subfamilies 28 and 30, for which there is no functional or
expression data, have the highest cysteine content (39.5%,
50.1% respectively).
Concerted evolution yields a high GC (Guanine and
Cytosine) content in high cysteine KRTAP gene family
The evolutionary patterns observed in a multigene family
can be attributed to two traditional models: concerted
evolution and the birth-and-death process [47]. Members
of a gene family under concerted evolution evolve in a
concerted manner rather than independently, as a mutation occurring in one member will spread through the
entire gene family by the repeated occurrence of unequal
crossover and/or gene conversion [47]. Concerted evolution therefore results in the distance between pairs of
genes remaining low. Considering the abundant speciesspecific clusters in the KRTAP gene phylogeny, many
should be candidates for concerted evolution. Gene conversion plays a parallel role to unequal crossing over, with
their major difference being that the latter can change the
copy number of a gene; however, it is difficult to distinguish between these two mechanisms.

We identified potential gene conversion events within
each subfamily using the methods implemented in the
GeneConv program [51] which identifies identical frag-

ments shared between pairs of nucleotide sequences. We
found a large number of KRTAP gene pairs for which gene
conversion events are suggested in the high/ultrahigh
cysteine subfamilies, but significantly fewer, only 4 pairs,
in high glycine-tyrosine subfamilies (χ2 = 73.85, p << 1010) (summarized in additional file 3). The distribution of
gene conversion events differs between species, suggesting
that different levels of gene conversion occur in each species. For example, 32 gene pairs in rat subfamily 10 suggested evidence for gene conversion, but only 7 pairs were
identified for this subfamily in the mouse. The RDP2 program also detected a large number of recombination
events within the high cysteine KRTAP genes but fewer in
the high glycine/tyrosine genes (additional file 4), and
typically suggested that different gene pairs were involved.
The identification of different gene pairs by the two methods may reflect differences in how the two programs identify recombination events.

Evidence for concerted evolution was also found in
changes in base composition of the genes. Gene conversion is a nonreciprocal recombination process in which a
DNA segment of a recipient gene is copied from a donor
gene and occurs during the repair of double strand breaks
by recombination [52]. Recently, it has been discovered
that gene conversion introduces a GC nucleotide bias into
sequences, the biased gene conversion (BCG) concept,
resulting in the enrichment of GC content in DNA
sequences undergoing concerted evolution [52,53] resulting in a positive correlation between rate of gene conversion and GC content. Therefore we examined the GC
content of KRTAP coding sequences, which we propose
scales with the rate of gene conversion. To evaluate the
contribution of concerted evolution, we also scaled the
level of gene conversion by distance between paralogs in
each subfamily. It has been reported that the frequency of
gene conversion correlates negatively with the divergence
between gene pairs [54]. Synonymous nucleotide sites are

The average amino acid content (%) of high cysteine (HS) and high glycine/tyrosine (HGT) KRTAP subfamily genes is shown. C (cysteine), G
(glycine), L (leucine), P (proine), Q (glutamine), S (serine), T (threonine) and Y (tyrosine) are single letter codes for amino acids that are abundant
in some KRTAP proteins.

expected to evolve neutrally and can be used to evaluate
the relative evolutionary divergence between pairs of
genes. Intriguingly, high cysteine KRTAP genes contain
extremely high GC content, and the GC content is negatively correlated with the divergence within the high
cysteine KRTAP gene subfamilies (fig. 4). Comparatively,
high glycine/tyrosine KRTAP contain relatively lower GC
content (~50%), and a higher synonymous substitution
rate (fig. 4), consistent with the detection of fewer gene
conversion events.
Phylogenetic relationships can also suggest sequence
homogenization, and potentially uncover the level of
gene conversion. In the tree of human and chimpanzee
KRTAP protein sequences, large quantities of one-to-one
orthologies were identified (additional file 2: figure 9),
suggesting that intraspecific gene conversion in the past 5
MYRs ago has not obscured orthologous relationships of
the human and chimpanzee genes. The number of these
one-to-one orthologies is reduced as phylogenetic dis-

tances between species pairs increases (additional file 2:
figures 9–15).
More dynamical evolution of high glycine/tyrosine KRTAPs
Higher GC content in high cysteine KRTAP compared to
high glycine/tyrosine genes reveals that strong concerted
evolution is occurring in former, and that they evolve in a
more stably manner. Accordingly, we compared the evolutionary dynamics of the two kinds of KRTAPs by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient of the number of
genes within each subfamily between species. As expected,
the coefficient value is significantly higher for high
cysteine KRTAP than for high glycine/tyrosine genes (p <
10-4 by Wilcoxon signed ranks test) (fig. 5A), and the two
groups of coefficient values are positively correlated (fig.
5B). In particular, subfamily 20 evolved with a very dramatic variation in gene numbers, e.g. mouse and opossum have 30 and 42 genes respectively, but humans only
have 2. As the number of gene conversion events detected
was close to zero, the false positive rate for detecting pos-

coefficient (r) of gene numbers of each subfamily between species is shown. A) The coefficient value for the high cysteine
KRTAP and high glycine/tyrosine genes is shown with standard errors of the estimates. The correlation coefficient of the high
cysteine genes is significantly higher than for the high glycine/tyrosine genes. B) A linear regression of the coefficients between

itive selection in subfamily 20 should be very low. Positive selection, which was detected on the rat and opossum
lineages by likelihood ratio tests (table 3), thus is proposed to be the major force for the dynamic evolution of
subfamily 20 and possibly for other high glycine/tyrosine
KRTAP genes.

Discussion
We have described the near-complete inventories of
KRTAP genes from the genomes of human, chimpanzee,
and rhesus macaque representing primates, mouse and rat
representing rodents, dog representing carnivore, opossum representing marsupial, and platypus as a
monotreme, and conducted comprehensive analyses of
the evolutionary patterns for this gene family, including

phylogenetic classification, and the detection of gene conversion.
Among the mammals that we studied, the genomes of
each species have members of most of the subfamilies
suggesting that the majority of KRTAP gene subfamilies
originated and diverged before the mammalian radiation
(fig. 1). Accordingly, the mammalian ancestor should also
have had a high diversity of KRTAP genes and enjoyed a
similar range and spectrum of hair characteristics that is
seen in modern mammalian species. The genes for subfamilies that emerged in the early mammals account for
about 74% total number of genes in present mammalian
genomes. We advocate that the rapid emergence of the
KRTAP gene family correlates with the evolution of mammalian hair and that the rapid emergence of plentiful hair

contributed to the successful radiation of homothermal
mammals by helping them to retain body heat since hair
acts as an insulator [13]. In contrast, Homo sapiens has
recently lost body hair function, presumably because
humans can obtain heat and can keep cold out by using
clothing. Despite a lack of hair, humans actually have a
similar density of hair follicles to apes [15], which possibly explains why human do not have a significant fewer
number of KRTAP genes. Perhaps, the changes in human
hair are due to the reduction in expression of the KRTAP
genes. In contrast to humans, rodents have an expanded
KRTAP gene family. Perhaps, mouse and rat need more
hair as they are adapted to the nocturnal environment.
Despite the proposed similar range and diversity of hair
characteristics in the ancestor of mammals, the current
traits, and content, of hair likely diverged significantly
from their ancestral characteristics as KRTAP sequences
have diverged dramatically among species due to gene
conversion.
Both gene conversion and unequal crossing over have
occurred during the evolution of the KRTAP. The evolution of several KRTAP gene subfamilies, such as subfamilies 1, 2 and 3 fit well with a model of punctuated
equilibrium (table 1), where morphological divergence as
well as speciation occurs in a burst-like manner with rapid
evolutionary change followed by long periods of constancy [55]. These KRTAP genes show evidence for fewer
gene duplication or loss events, suggesting that a low level
of unequal crossing over has occurred within these subfamilies, and that gene conversion may predominate. In
addition, the syntenic arrangement of genes of these subfamilies has not been disturbed by post-duplication rearrangement events, suggesting a strong constraint has been
exerted upon their distribution. In contrast, other KRTAP
genes, such as subfamilies 4 and 5 (table 1) have evolved
relatively dynamically likely including unequal crossing
over as changes in the copy number of this subfamily is
observed between species.
Changes in gene numbers within subfamilies between
mammals may explain differences in the observed hair
morphology between species. No genes of subfamily 9
were identified in opossum or platypus, suggesting that
this subfamily originated after the divergence of placental
and marsupial mammals. In a similar manner, genes of
subfamily 12 emerged before the divergence of marsupials but after the divergence from monotremes (fig. 1).
Intriguingly, subfamily 13 has been lost on the marsupial
lineage, and the subfamilies 24, 26 and 27 which are adjacent to subfamily 13 in the genome, are also not found in
the opossum genome. We used Mapviewer from NCBI to
identify genes flanking this cluster in the human genome
and searched the opossum genome using BLAST to identify an orthologous genomic region. An ortholog of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/241

human gene that flanks the human KRTAP genes is only
about 13 kbp away from the remainder of the KRTAP cluster in the opossum genome, which indicates the loss of
this region in the opossum was due to a deletion event.
Subfamily 30, which is a member of the ultra-high sulfur
(~50%) group, along with subfamily 34 are unique to
rodents, thus may be partially responsible for the unique
characteristics of hair in rodents. Subfamily 35 is mousespecific, while subfamilies 32 and 33 are platypus-specific, which could account for species-specific hair characteristics.
The high-glycine/tyrosine (HGT) gene repertoire evolve
more dynamically within mammals with increased levels
of pseudogenization (fig. 1), for example, mice possesses
56 genes, while primates have considerably fewer genes
with only 27 and 25 genes in human and chimpanzee
respectively. The gene number in platypus is likely to be
underestimated because HGT cluster in platypus is shorter
than that of other mammals (only about 100 kbp in platypus, but ~500 kbp in human, ~800 kbp in mouse, and
~350 kbp in opossum), and the incomplete nature of this
genome sequence. However, the dynamics of HGT subfamilies does not appear to be due to unequal crossing
over, as unequal crossing over should also generate a GC
content bias that is not observed in these genes (personal
communication, Gabriel Marais).
Tandemly arrayed paralogous genes with similar function
can provide combinatorial complexity to biological diversity [56]. This extraordinary evolutionary feature has been
observed in many multigene families responsible for
processes that face enormous external signals. For
instance, the sensory system such as the olfactory receptor,
vomeronasal receptor and sweet/umami receptor, bitter
receptor genes, require a huge combination of diverse
receptors for the diverse ligands they encounter in a tremendous range of molecular environments [57]. Another
classic example is the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor
protein superfamily which use recombination to generate
large quantities of antigen recognition complexes to allow
an immune responses to rapidly evolving pathogens [58].
We therefore speculate that an analogous process occurs
within the KRTAP gene family, where the KRTAP and keratin proteins have combined in unique combinations to
generate the high diversity of hair phenotypes that are
observed both between and within species, and even
within individuals.

Conclusion
We have described the near-complete inventories of
KRTAP genes in eight mammalian genomes. We found
that the KRTAP family was unique to mammals, KRTAP
gene repertoire was expanded in rodents, and surprisingly,
humans had a similar number of genes as other primates,

inconsistent with the hairlessness of humans. The high
glycine-tyrosine KRTAP genes have evolved more dynamically, with fewer gene conversion events and thus have a
lower GC content compared with high cysteine KRTAPs.
We propose that the mammalian ancestor should have a
diverse KRTAP gene repertoire, and that hair content characteristics have evolved and diverged rapidly among
mammals because of rapid divergent evolution of KRTAPs
between species caused by concerted evolution.

Methods
Retrieval of sequences
Some KRTAP genes have previously been annotated to
possess introns, which generally complicates gene prediction and identification. All of the intron-containing
KRTAP genes have short introns, and the sequences of
these introns are similar to the repeated regions found
within the exons, and many are predicted to be alternatively spiced. All of the introns could be included in a primary transcript that can be translated in-frame with the
coding exons, they just have longer repetitive regions.
Therefore, we hypothesize that all of the KRTAP genes can
generate an mRNA sequence that is intron-less.

We identified KRTAP gene repertoires in the genome
assemblies from human (Homo sapiens) (build36.2),
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) (build2.1), rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta) (build1.1), mouse (Mus musculus)
(build36.1), rat (Rattus norvegicus) (RGSC v3.4), dog
(Canis familiaris) (build2.1), opossum (Monodelphis
domesticus) (MonDom5) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus
anatinus) (build1.1). We used the BLASTn algorithm [59]
to search these genomes using all known human KRTAP
genes as queries. Each newly identified putative KRTAP
gene was used as a query using BLAST http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi against the non-redundant GenBank database to check whether their best hit
was a KRTAP gene. The chicken (Gallus gallus) (Build 2.1),
zebrafish (Danio rerio) genomes (Zv6) in NCBI [60], lizard (Anolis carolinensis) genome at UCSC http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ and the Xenopus tropicalis genome at JGI
[61] genomes were also searched using BLAST for KRTAPlike sequences. Sequences that possessed an interrupting
stop codons and/or frame-shifts caused by insertions or
deletions were denoted as pseudogenes.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
In order to classify the members of the KRTAP gene family, protein sequences were used to construct phylogenetic
trees using the neighbor-joining method with p-distances
with MEGA3.0 http://www.megasoftware.net[62] after
alignment with ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw/index.html[63]. The reliability of the trees was
evaluated by the interior branch tests with 1,000 replications.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/241

Detection of recombination
We employed the GeneConv program http://
www.math.wustl.edu/~sawyer/geneconv/[51] to identify
potential gene conversion events in the KRTAP coding
sequences. Gene conversion is a process where a segment
of DNA from one allele of a gene is copied and replaces
the sequence in another allele or gene. Accordingly, GeneConv extends a method previously described by [51] and
detects this process by identifying shared fragments
between pairs of sequences. Global Bonferroni corrected P
values were calculated to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed fragment lengths and are compared
to a simulated distribution (10,000 iterations) of the
same number of sequences with similar variation. Lower
P values suggest a greater probability that a gene conversion event has occurred. GeneConv has a significant limitation in that it is unable to distinguish between gene
conversion and unequal crossing over events, but to date
no other effective bioinformatic method have been
described that can distinguish between these two types of
events. We therefore, can not distinguish gene conversion
and unequal crossing over.

The divergence among paralogs could also reflect the level
of conversion which can homogenize paralogs. Nucleotide sequences were back-translated from protein
sequences after alignment by ClustalW [63]. Alignments
were modified manually if necessary. Approximate synonymous substitution rate (Ks) values within subfamilies
were calculated by the modified Nei-Gojobori (p-distance) method with a transition/transversion ratio of 2
[64].
Recombination events were also detected using the RDP2
software
package
http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/
rdp.html[65]. Evidence for recombination was detected
by running RDP, BootScan, MaxChi and Chimaera with
1,000 permutations. Sequences were considered linear.
The highest acceptable P value cut-off was set to 0.01.
Bonferroni correction was employed.
Adaptive evolution analysis
The site-specific models M1a and M2a implemented in
PAML http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html
were used to detect potentially positively selected sites in
the subfamily [66-68]. Considering the high false positive
rate of likelihood ratio tests, particularly when there is frequent recombination [69,70], we only detected positive
selection in subfamily 20, a family in which gene conversion does not appear to occur and has expanded dramatically on the mouse, rat and opossum lineages.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the potential number of gene pairs where
gene conversion could occur by ∑Nij(Nij-1)/2, where Nij is

the intact gene numbers in subfamily i within species j,
and N must be higher than 2 for gene conversion to be
detected by the GeneConv program. The chi test was used
to detect statistical significance in the difference in
number of gene conversion events occurring between
high cysteine and high glycine/tyrosine KRTAP. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the number of genes in each
subfamily was determined for pairs of species (table 1).
The evolutionary dynamics of the high cysteine and high
glycine/tyrosine KRTAP genes was evaluated by comparing the values of the Pearson correlation coefficients.
