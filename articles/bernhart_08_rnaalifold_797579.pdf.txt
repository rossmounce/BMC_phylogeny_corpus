Abstract
Background: The prediction of a consensus structure for a set of related RNAs is an important
first step for subsequent analyses. RNAalifold, which computes the minimum energy structure that
is simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of the oldest and most widely used
tools for this task. In recent years, several alternative approaches have been advocated, pointing to
several shortcomings of the original RNAalifold approach.
Results: We show that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be improved substantially by
introducing a different, more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by replacing the rather
simplistic model of covariance scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring matrices.
These improvements are achieved without compromising the computational efficiency of the
algorithm. We show here that the new version of RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one,
but also several other tools recently developed, on different datasets.
Conclusion: The new version of RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for almost any
application but it is also competitive with other approaches including those based on SCFGs,
maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical nearest neighbor classifiers.

Background
Unbiased surveys of the transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes by multiple techniques ranging from tiling arrays and
short-read sequencing to large-scale sequencing of fulllength cDNAs have dramatically changed our perception

of genome organization: At least 90% of the mammalian
genomes are transcribed, the vast majority of this transcription is non-protein-coding, and there is mounting
evidence that a significant fraction of the non-coding transcripts are functional [1,2]. The investigation of non-cod-

ing RNAs has thus developed into a focal topic in
molecular biology and bioinformatics alike. Most of the
ancient house-keeping RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs,
snoRNAs) and many of the newly discovered regulatory
RNAs, including microRNA precursors, form evolutionarily well-conserved secondary structures, reviewed e.g. in
[3]. These structures are tightly linked to the molecules'
functions. It is therefore a core task in RNA bioinformatics
to compute in particular the consensus structures of evolutionarily conserved RNAs.
It has long been known that the accuracy of thermodynamic structure predictions for individual sequences is
rather limited. On the other hand, computing the consensus structure common to several related RNA sequences
can drastically improve the prediction [4]. The conceptually most elegant approach towards consensus structure
prediction is to solve the alignment and the structure prediction problem simultaneously. The Sankoff algorithm
[5] provides a solution that is practically applicable and
has been implemented in various variants including dynalign [6], stemloc [7], foldalign [8], LocARNA [9] or consan
[10]. Still, these approaches are computationally too
expensive for large-scale routine applications. One basic
alternative is to first compute structures for the individual
sequences and then to align these sequences taking into
account the structural information. This can be achieved
in different ways using sequence-based (e.g. stral [11]),
tree-based [12,13], or Sankoff-style alignment algorithms
[14]. Alignment-free approaches include RNAspa [15]
and consensus shapes [16].
A large group of methods pre-supposes a (sequence)
alignment. Most methods of this type use the alignment
to super-impose predicted structures to global [17,18] or
local structures [19]. RNAalifold [4], on the other hand, in
essence averages the contributions of the standard Turner
energy model [20] according to a given alignment A and
then solves the thermodynamic folding problem w.r.t.
these averaged energies. A special case is the ConStruct
package [21], which besides acting as a front-end for several prediction tools provides an interface for changing
RNA alignments using expert knowledge.

Methods
Original RNAalifold
The original RNAalifold approach combines a thermodynamic energy minimization [22] with a simple scoring
model to assess evolutionary conservation. Both an
energy minimization and a partition function version are
implemented in the Vienna RNA package [4]. Energy minimization uses the following recursions:

As in single-sequence folding, the arrays Fij, Cij, Mij, and

M1 hold, for every sub-sequence from i to j, the energies

of the optimal folds of unconstrained structures, of structures enclosed by (i, j) base pairs, of multi-loop components, and of multi-loop components with a single
branch, respectively [23]. The Turner energy parameters
for hairpin loops delimited by alignment positions i and j
in sequence α ∈ A are denoted by (i, j, α); similarly ℑ(ij,
kl, α) encodes the energies of interior loops including
stacked base pairs. Multi-loops are modeled by a linear
model with a "closing" contribution a , and contribution
b and c for each branch and unpaired position, respectively. Note that these values are the tabulated singlesequence parameters multiplied by the number N = | A |
of aligned sequences, since the recursion above computes
the sum of the folding energies. RNAalifold modifies the
energy model by introducing a (base pair) conservation
score γ(i, j) that evaluates the corresponding alignment
columns w.r.t. evidence for base pairing. In [4], we used

g ′(i, j) =

where the Hamming distance h(a, b) = 0 if a = b and h(a,

set of possible base pairs. The full covariation score γ also

includes penalties for sequences in which the (i, j) base
pair cannot be realized:

⎧ 0 if (a ia j ) ∈

Potentially paired columns, in which less than a userdefined number or fraction of sequences can form the
pair, are considered to be forbidden. RNAalifold therefore
predicts the structure common to most of the sequences in
an alignment. A prediction for a single molecule that is
consistent with the consensus structure can be obtained
by using the result of RNAalifold as a constraint for single
molecule folding. Both mfold [22] and RNAfold [24] can
be used for this purpose.
The purpose of this contribution is to explore several avenues for improving the performance of RNAalifold. Intuitively, there are two leverage points: (1) the details of the
energy evaluations in the presence of gaps, and (2) the
rather ad hoc covariance bonuses and penalties.
Improved Energy Evaluation
The 2002 implementation of RNAalifold uses a very simplistic way of treating gaps in order to save computational

resources: gaps within unpaired regions are simply
ignored, because then only alignment positions appear as
indices and loop sizes, for instance, do not need to be
evaluated separately for every sequence. This can, however, distort the energetics in particular if there are many
gaps, and in extreme cases can lead to the inclusion of
unrealistically short hairpins, see Figure 1. A second
source of error is that gaps do not contribute to the dangling end energies in this setting.
The new implementation thus evaluates (i, j, α) and ℑ(ij,
kl, α) by first mapping the alignment indices back to the
positions in α. Then the correct energy parameters according to the Turner model are retrieved. In the same way, the
handling of dangling ends is fixed. In practice, this is
achieved by introducing three arrays of dimension N × n,
where n is the length of the alignment of N sequences. For
each sequence α and each alignment position, these
arrays hold the 5' neighboring base, the 3' neighboring
base, and the position in the original sequence. Since in
typical applications we have N &#x226A; n, this does not
significantly change memory consumption. Still, the
problem remains that in some sequences hairpin loops
with less than three unpaired positions may arise. We
penalize these sequences with a contribution of the same
order of magnitude as that of non-canonical base pairs.
From here on, we will refer to this "gap free" energy computation as the "new RNAalifold".

Figure results of treating gaps as bases
Possible1
Possible results of treating gaps as bases. The consensus structure of the alignment in the middle is predicted once with
gaps treated as if they were bases (old), and once by removing them before computing the energies (new). The predicted
structures (highlighted in red) are shown to the left. As can be seen in 1, sequence 1 can form a perfect hairpin. In 2, the sterically impossible hairpin for the other two sequences is shown. Two of the three sequences cannot form the predicted structure. On the other hand, the new version of RNAalifold predicts a stem that has a bulge (3), but only in one sequence, the
other two sequences can form the perfect stem shown in 4.

Energy Parameters
Instead of the usual Turner energy parameters, one may
use other parametrizations. Andronescu et al. [25] introduced energy parameters that increase the performance of
single stranded RNA folding, with striking results in particular on ribosomal RNAs. We found, however, that they
provide no significant over-all performance gain for
RNAalifold on the broad range of datasets we used to
assess performance (see section Performance Evaluation
below). The results obtained for Andronescu's energy
parameters, together with those of other unsuccessful
attempts to increase performance, are tabulated in the
additional file 1.

ments, such base pairs were ignored in the computation.
We also kept only sequences with less than 5% undetermined nucleotides and at least 50% of the maximum possible number of base pairs. This set was clustered using
single linkage clustering to determine clusters where the
sequence identity between different clusters is ≤ P. For
each cutoff value P we determined the frequencies f(ac) of
nucleotides of type a and c being aligned and f(ab; cd) of
base pairs of type ab and cd being aligned in sequences
that are within different clusters. Besides being more different than P, the sequences had to have at least a
sequence identity of Q. For each pair Q, P, we define the
modified RIBOSUM scores as the log-odds scores

Sequence Weighting
In practice, many input alignments have a very unbalanced distribution of sequences. Often most sequences
are very closely related and outweigh one or a few divergent ones. In this case it seems appropriate to downweight the influence of closely related sequences [26] similar to the weighted sum of pairs score frequently used for
multiple alignment. The problem with this approach is
that distant sequences receive the highest weights, but are
also more likely to be misaligned, and hence a rational
weighting scheme will also increase the impact of alignment errors.

R(ab, cd) = log (f(ab; cd)/f(ac)f(bd))

One can try to minimize this effect by dividing the score
of RNAalifold in two parts, one which does not contain
the outliers, thus scoring a smaller alignment, and one
which contains all sequences. If the smaller alignment
scores significantly better than the complete one, one can
assume that the divergent sequence is either misaligned or
at least does not share the consensus structure. At present,
we have not been able to devise a fail-safe automatic procedure to identify these cases. Since sequence weighting
leads to a significant increase in CPU time because the
weighting has to be introduced in the inner-most loop of
the energy evaluation, we have decided against including
the weighting option into the public version of RNAalifold.
Improving the Evaluation of Sequence-Covariation
RIBOSUM Matrices
The covariance term γ' of the old RNAalifold implementation is based on qualitative arguments only. A more quantitatively sound approach is to use scoring matrices akin to
the RIBOSUM scheme [27]. As a training set, we selected
13,500 sequences in total from the about 20,000
sequences in the SSU alignment of the European Ribosomal RNA Database [28], which are available in the DCSE
file format. When reading in the DCSE format, one needs
to correctly assign helix numbers to concrete helices of the
sequences. In some cases, this assignment could not be
done in an automated way. Avoiding possible mis-assign-

(3)

In practice, we vary P and Q in steps of 5% sequence identity and obtain altogether 99 matrices. Note that this procedure is somewhat different from the approach reported
in [27]. The frequencies can be determined either for all
base pairs including the non-canonical ones or restricted
to the six types of canonical base pairs. Only the latter version has proved useful in our context, and will be referred
to as RIBOSUM in the following.
The covariance term is computed as

g ′(i, j) =

∑

1
xR(a ia j ; b i b j ),
2 a , b ∈A

(4)

a ≠b

i.e., the RIBOSUM matrices replace the Hamming distances h(αi, βi) + h(αj, βj), and are scaled by a factor x so
that the entries are in the same range as the entries of the
Hamming distance matrix. In order to determine which
matrix to use, we determine the minimum q and maximum p sequence identity in the alignment and select the
RIBOSUM matrix with smallest P and Q so that p ≤ P and
q ≤ Q.
RNAalifold uses two parameters to fine-tune the impact of
the covariance score. The first parameter, β, controls the
influence of the covariance score γ' relative to the total
folding energy. The second one, δ, weights the impact of
non-standard pairs. The old default value for both parameters is 1.
Simply leaving them as they are would lead to a large
change in the balance between the thermodynamic and
the covariance score. In the old RNAalifold program, less
than 10% of the total score is derived from the covariance
score. If β and δ were kept at 1, this fraction would
increase to more than 50%. This would presumably overemphasize covariance over thermodynamics. To find
appropriate values for β and δ, we use k-fold cross valida-

tion, with k = 11 on the CMfinder-SARSE benchmark dataset described below.
Pfold-like Scoring
Inspired by the approach used in Pfold, we also tested a
covariance scoring based on an explicit phylogenetic
model. More precisely, we used the log-odds ratio of the
probabilities of a base pair given a tree and the alignment,
and the product of the corresponding probabilities of
unpaired bases given the same tree and alignment [29]. A
neighbor joining tree computed from the distances measured within the alignment was used. The probabilities
were then computed from this tree using the Pfold rate
matrices. This ansatz, however, did not result in more
accurate predictions. Therefore, it was not included into
RNAalifold.
Additional features
In addition to increasing the performance, additional
functionalities are included in the new RNAalifold software.
Centroid structure
The partition function computation now includes the
computation of the centroid structure, which is defined as
the structure with minimal mean base pair distance to all
the structures of the ensemble:

d(S) =

⎧ 1 − (p(i, j)) if i, j ∈ B(S)
else

∑ ⎨ p(i, j)
⎩

i , j∈B

(5)

Here, d(S) is the distance of a structure to the ensemble, B
denotes the set of all possible base pairs in the ensemble,
B(S) is the set of all base pairs of structure S, and p(i, j) is
the probability of the base pair i, j in the ensemble. It can
easily be seen that the structure with minimal d(S) is the
structure that contains all base pairs with a probability
greater than 0.5. This centroid structure can be seen as the
single structure that best describes the ensemble [30]. The
centroid structure usually contains less base pairs than the
minimum free energy structure, and is therefore less likely
to contain false positives.
Stochastic Backtracking
When trying to find out about statistical features of the
structure ensemble other than base pair probabilities, it is
sometimes of interest to compute a sample of suboptimal
structures according to their Boltzmann weights. This can
be achieved efficiently using so-called stochastic backtracking. In this variation of the standard backtracking
scheme, one uses the matrices of the partition function
computation to determine the probability of base pairs or
unpaired bases that are included in the structure instead
of choosing the alternative with the minimum free energy
at each step. The principle of stochastic backtracking in

RNA folding has been used already in [31] for the generation of uniformly distributed random structures. Later,
sfold [32] and the Vienna RNA Package [24] also implemented energy-weighted variants. These implementations
differ from the original algorithm only by the inclusion of
the Boltzmann factors of the loop energy contributions
instead of treating all structural alternatives with equal
weight. The generalization of the stochastic backtracking
algorithm to consensus folds is straightforward. See additional file 2 for a detailed description. Stochastic backtracking is now implemented in the RNAalifold software.
Performance Evaluation
A trusted set of aligned sequences with corresponding
structures is needed in order to evaluate the performance
of consensus structure prediction tools. Most papers on
this topic use some subset of the Rfam [33]. However, the
structures and alignments contained in Rfam pose several
problems. The database consists of a large number of
snoRNAs (more than 30% of the alignments) and micro
RNAs (about 7%). Furthermore, many of the Rfam entries
contain short sequences that can only form simple one
stem structures. A serious problem is the fact that many of
the Rfam structures are predictions, some of which were
created by the very programs that are to be tested. Not
even all of the structures flagged as published within the
database have been experimentally derived. Mostly
because of this reasons, only 19 of the more than 600
Rfam families are contained in RNA STRAND [34], a
recently created, curated database of high quality single
RNA secondary structures.

We therefore chose several different datasets for performance evaluation. In addition to the complete Rfam (version 8.1) seed alignments, we use here the CMfinderSARSE subset compiled from [35,36], which contains 44
high quality seed alignments (also used in the recent PETfold paper [37]), the seeds of 19 Rfam families contained
in RNA STRAND, and the dataset of KNetFold [38]. A list
of these Rfam subsets can be found in the additional file
3 or including links in the online supplement.
The script refold.pl of the Vienna RNA package is used to
remove gaps and non-standard base pairs from the
RNAalifold predictions. The resulting structure is compared to the reference structure. For each alignment only
the first sequence is used for performance evaluation to
avoid a bias from the unequal sizes of the aligned
sequence sets. As performance measure we use the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) as introduced in a previous benchmark [39]: Base pairs that are not part of the
reference structure are counted as false positives only if
they are inconsistent with the reference structure, while
they are ignored if they can be added to the reference
structure. Thus additional stems and elongated stems are

not penalized. While this is a physically reasonable way to
compute the MCC, the question of comparability might
arise. To address this, we also used the more simple way
of defining false positives as all base pairs predicted that
were not part of the reference structure, and called it
"other MCC".
For the comparison procedure, we used the web-servers of
Pfold [29] and KNetFold. In case the Rfam seed alignment
contained more than 40 sequences, only the first 40 were
used; all-gap columns were removed from such alignments. The McCaskill-MEA software McC_mea [17] was
installed locally. The predictions were also filtered with
refold.pl before scoring.
In order to evaluate the dependence on the alignment
quality, we also realigned the Rfam alignments of the
CMfinder-SARSE dataset using Clustal [40], and then proceeded as described above. Furthermore, we also computed the MCC for all Rfam seed alignments for those
programs that can be run locally (i.e. the RNAalifold variants and McC_mea).
The RNAalifold algorithm has been extensively used for
the prediction of thermodynamically stable and/or evolutionary conserved RNAs [41-43]. The AlifoldZ program
[41] evaluates stability and structural conservation at the
same time simply by comparing the consensus free energy
of an alignment to the consensus free energies of a large
number of randomly shuffled alignments, relying entirely
on RNAalifold. RNAz [42], on the other hand calculates
two separate scores for stability and conservation. Structural conservation is assessed by means of the folding
energy based structure conservation index (SCI). Here, the
consensus energy is set in relation to the mean free energies of the single sequences. The lower bound of the SCI is
zero, indicating that RNAalifold is not able to find a consensus structure, while a SCI close to one corresponds to
perfect structure conservation. Here, we investigate
whether the improved performance of RNAalifold in
terms of correctness of the predicted structure can also
improve the performance of ncRNA gene finders.
In order to evaluate the performance of AlifoldZ and the
SCI, we re-consider a sub-set of the test-set used in a previous benchmark [44]. As usual, we compute ROC curves
to determine our ability to discriminate between truly
conserved alignments and randomized controls. For simplicity, only the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is
reported below as a measure of the discrimination power.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/474

treatment of gaps in the new version leads to a consistently improved accuracy. The data also shows that the covariance contribution in the 2002 version was too large.
Using RIBOSUM matrices instead of the naïve Hamming
distance score substantially increases the beneficial effect
of the covariance score. However, if the same parameters
as in the original RNAalifold were used, the relative portion of the covariance term within the score would be
greater than the thermodynamic score. We remark that for
large values of β, where the covariance contributions
dominate, the performance becomes much worse than for
a purely thermodynamic energy computation (data not
shown). As a new default, we therefore use β = 0.6 and δ
= 0.5. Still, the portion of the covariance term in the combined energy term is much higher (about 44%) in the
RIBOSUM than in the other RNAalifold variants (about
7%). We want to remark that with the exception of very
low β, the performance of the RIBOSUM variant always
exceeds the performance of the new variant without
RIBOSUM, which in turn always performs better than the
2002 variant of RNAalifold (see Figures 2 and 3).
Table 1 summarizes the comparison of the consensus
structure predictions for five alignment-based programs
on the CMfinder-SARSE dataset. The new RNAalifold with
RIBOSUM matrices often yields perfect predictions and
appears to have a good worst case performance: the smallest observed MCC is 0.64, and in this case the input alignment is clearly flawed, see additional file 4.
In Table 2, the performance of the same five programs on
the RNA STRAND-Rfam dataset is shown. This curated
dataset, in contrast to the other datasets we used, has
many pseudo-knotted structures (6) and only 2 of the 19
alignments have simple one-stem structures. In this
regard, it is a good extension to our other datasets. While
the total MCCs of all programs are lower, again the RIBOSUM variant of RNAalifold outperforms the other programs – however, on this dataset, the centroid structure
computed using RIBOSUM RNAalifold has the best performance, with an MCC of 0.794. For this table, KNetFold
was run using the "check pseudoknots" option. Still, it
only correctly predicted a part of a single pseudo-knot.

Results and Discussion

We also used the Rfam subset that was used to evaluate
the performance of KNetFold [38]. However, we did not
use the same procedure to prune alignments down to a
maximum of 40 sequences. Therefore, the MCCs reported
here cannot directly be compared to the ones in [38]. The
MCC we achieve with the RIBOSUM variant of RNAalifold is 0.818. This is again a significant improvement over
the MCC of 0.604 achieved by the 2002 variant.

Predicting consensus structures
We first compared the new implementation of RNAalifold
with the 2002 version. As shown in Figure 2, the proper

1.0, using RIBOSUM Matrices improves the performance of the new RNAalifold, which is in turn always better than the 2002
(old) variant. Furthermore, for the RIBOSUM variant, the size of the plateau, i.e. the subset of parameters with a MCC ≥ 0.93
is quite big, containing 36 of 100 combinations of parameters (80 are ≥ 0.9, 21 are ≥ 0.935 and 6 are 0.937). Top: 3d-plot of

sons are problematic were removed), the mean MCC of
RNAalifold 2002 is 0.729, the new RNAalifold with RIBOSUM matrices achieves a mean MCC of 0.790, while
McC_mea achieves 0.742.
In Table 3, the performance of the new RNAalifold variants using the "other MCC" variant and the results when
using Clustal realigned sequences are shown.

Effects on predicted structures
Over all, there are two main reasons why prediction using
the RIBOSUM variant of RNAalifold will give better predictions than the 2002 variant. By treating gaps as if they
were bases, the 2002 implementation sometimes assigns
much too unfavorable energies to loops containing gaps
in a small number of sequences. As a consequence, these
loops cannot be part of the consensus structure. Examples

Dependence of RNAalifold on the weights β and δ
Dependence of RNAalifold on the weights β and δ.A: For all three RNAalifold variants, the accuracy of the structure
prediction, measured here as MCC for the CMfinder-SARSE dataset (Table 1), depends on the weight β of the covariance term
(δ = 0.6). B: The AUC value for the SCI computation also depends strongly on the values of β and δ. The green square indicates the optimal parameters (β = 1.55, δ = 0.6), the red dot is the default (1, 1). As the default is close to the maximum, there
is little room for improvement.

for this effect are GcvB, where an interrupting bulge loop
in the consensus structure actually exists in only one
sequence, or the Hammerhead ribozyme, where a large
insertion within a hairpin loop is present in about a third
of the sequences.
The beneficial effect of using the RIBOSUM matrices is
mostly due to the possibility to assign covariance boni to
certain base pairs even if not much (or even no) covariation actually occurred. This makes it possible to compensate for a few contradicting base pairs, whether they are
due to alignment errors or to a slightly different structure
for some sequences. Predictions that benefit from that
effect are e.g. the Enterovirus 5' cloverleaf, the Snake H/
ACA box small nucleolar RNA or the UnaL2 LINE 3' element. A mixture of both effects is seen in the R2 RNA element as well as in the Hammerhead ribozyme. The
detailed results for these molecules can be seen in the
additional files 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 or in the online supplement.
Detection of ncRNAs
AlifoldZ detects structural non-coding RNAs by comparing the energy of the native alignment to the energies of a
population of randomized control alignments via a z-

score. Here, the better predictive power of the new RIBOSUM approach directly translates into increased ability to
distinguish evolutionary conserved RNAs from randomized controls. The RIBOSUM approach achieves an
AUC of 0.969 compared to 0.954 for both the 2002
implementation and the new RNAalifold. The performance boost comes mainly from additional bonus energies
derived from covariance scoring. In the RIBOSUM
approach these energies have a much higher contribution
than in the conventional model thereby favoring true conservation patterns by giving a lower total free energy and
hence a lower z-score. This beneficial effect is not observed
in the case of the SCI, where the RIBOSUM covariance
energies even result in a performance drop (AUC 0.767)
compared to the other two implementations (new: 0.917,
2002: 0.916). The SCI is a conservation measure that compares the consensus free energy to the mean free energy of
the single sequences. The covariance energies are important for the high discrimination capability of the SCI, but
with the RIBOSUM scoring model the over-emphasis of
the covariance energy contributions blurs the signal for
true conservation. If we neglect the covariance score for
the computation of the SCI, the effect is much smaller
(AUC 0.907). We expect, however, that the RIBOSUM

approach will perform well on purely structure-based similarity or distance measures.
Computational requirements
Theoretically, the new and the old RNAalifold variants
have the same space (  (n2)) and time (  (Nn3)) complexity, with N sequences in an alignment of length n.
However, neglecting possible base pairs with a conservation score below a certain cutoff (e.g. if more than 50% of

the sequences cannot form a base pair) dramatically
reduces computation time without affecting the results. As
an example, folding a subset of five randomly chosen
sequences of a ribosomal SSU alignment (length 1716 nt)
takes an average of about 42.2 seconds, while using 10
sequences of the same alignment takes about 3.8 seconds
on an Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz processor (Figure 4). The RIBOSUM matrices make it much harder to exclude base pairs

from the outset. Thus, the RIBOSUM variant is by far the
slowest option on alignments with many rather diverse
sequences.

Conclusion
We have shown here that the performance of RNAalifold
can be improved to be competitive with all recently published alignment-based consensus structure prediction
tools. This improvement is reached by a more accurate
treatment of gaps and an elaborate model for the evaluation of sequence covariations that resembles the RIBOSUM

matrices. The gain in performance is achieved at negligible
extra computational cost and without dramatic changes to
the implementation. While a sequence weighting scheme
apparently can yield further improvements on good alignments, this makes the procedure less resilient towards misalignments. It seems, therefore, that the approach is essentially limited by the quality of the input alignments.
