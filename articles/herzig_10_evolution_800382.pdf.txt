Abstract
Background: The scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) domain is an ancient and conserved protein domain. CD163
and WC1 molecules are classed together as group B SRCR superfamily members, along with Spα, CD5 and CD6, all of
which are expressed by immune system cells. There are three known types of CD163 molecules in mammals, CD163A
(M130, coded for by CD163), CD163b (M160, coded for by CD163L1) and CD163c-α (CD163L1 or SCART), while their
nearest relative, WC1, is encoded by a multigene family so far identified in the artiodactyl species of cattle, sheep, and
pigs.
Results: We annotated the bovine genome and identified genes coding for bovine CD163A and CD163c-α but found
no evidence for CD163b. Bovine CD163A is widely expressed in immune cells, whereas CD163c-α transcripts are
enriched in the WC1+ γδ T cell population. Phylogenetic analyses of the CD163 family genes and WC1 showed that
CD163c-α is most closely related to WC1 and that chicken and platypus have WC1 orthologous genes, previously
classified as among their CD163 genes.
Conclusion: Since it has been shown that WC1 plays an important role in the regulation of γδ T cell responses in cattle,
which, like chickens, have a high percentage of γδ T cells in their peripheral blood, CD163c-α may play a similar role,
especially in species lacking WC1 genes. Our results suggest that gene duplications resulted in the expansion of
CD163c-α-like and WC1-like molecules. This expanded repertoire was retained by species known as "γδ T cell high", but
homologous SRCR molecules were maintained by all mammals.
Background
The CD163 family includes genes encoding CD163A
(also known as M130, HbSR, and coded for by CD163),
CD163b (also known as M160, and coded for by
CD163L1) and CD163c-α (also known as CD163L1 and
SCART). This family is a subset of the scavenger receptor
cysteine-rich (SRCR) super-family, an ancient super-family defined by the presence of 100-110 amino acid
domains [1]. Members of the CD163 family are group B
SRCR proteins distinguished by the 6-8 cysteines in their
SRCR domains resulting in 3-4 disulfide bonds; in comparison, group A SRCR proteins have only 6 cysteines
and 3 disulfide bonds in their SRCR domains. SRCR
domains, like Ig domains or epidermal growth factor-like
domains, are thought to be involved in protein-protein

interactions, although the known ligands of these
domains vary widely.
CD163A is a receptor for haptoglobin-hemoglobin
complexes, and is inducibly expressed on monocytes,
macrophages and a subpopulation of hematopoietic progenitors [2-6]. CD163A protects against oxidative damage by mediating the endocytosis of haptoglobinhemoglobin complexes [7]. Ligation of CD163A by haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes induces the secretion of
the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [8]. In addition,
proteolytically-cleaved CD163A shed into serum inhibits
phorbol ester-induced T cell proliferation [9]. The third
SRCR domain of CD163A mediates its interaction with
haptoglobin and TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of
apoptosis) [10,11]. CD163A interacts with a molecule
expressed on erythroblasts and with bacteria via its second SRCR domain [12,13]. The related group B SRCR
molecule CD6 also binds to bacteria via one or more of its
SRCR domains, through interactions with the bacterial

non-peptiditic products lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [14].
CD163A transcripts display alternative splicing of the
extracellular and cytoplasmic coding regions, potentially
increasing the diversity of its function [15,16]. The
CD163A form with a short cytoplasmic domain predominates and mediates ligand internalization and degradation but the function of the CD163A form with a long
cytoplasmic domain is unknown [17]. Cross-linking of
CD163A induces inositol triphosphate and cytokine production [18]. The CD163A cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated by casein kinase II and protein kinase C-α
(PKC-α) and these phosphorylation events are tied to
cytokine production induced by CD163A cross-linking
[19]. Casein kinase II activity and anti-inflammatory
cytokine production in macrophages is stimulated by
CD163A binding to only one of the two alleles of haptoglobin, although both bind to CD163A with high affinity
[20]. The non-stimulatory haptoglobin allele is correlated
with increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease
[21,22].
CD163b is also expressed on macrophages, with two
cytoplasmic domain variants of 71 and 39 amino acids,
resulting from alternative splicing [23]. Little is known
about the function or ligand of CD163b. Thus far, the
gene encoding CD163b has only been found in the
genomes of primates and the horse.
Unlike CD163A, which is encoded by one gene across
eutherian mammals, several species possess multiple
genes encoding CD163c-α molecules. There are two
CD163c-α genes in mice: SCART1 and SCART2.
SCART1 is expressed in the lymph node, trachea and
lung; SCART2 is expressed on murine γδ T cells that
secrete IL-17 [24,25]. The presence of multiple genes
encoding the SRCR transmembrane receptor CD163c-α
is similar to that of another set of group B SRCR proteins,
WC1. Genes encoding WC1 have been found in the
artiodactyl species cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries)
and swine (Sus scrofa) [26-30]. WC1 molecules are
encoded by a family of fifteen genes in the bovine and,
like SCART2, are expressed on γδ T cells [26,27,30-34].
WC1 contributes to the γδ T cell response to Leptospira
(Wang F, Herzig CTA, Hsu H, Chen C, Baldwin CL,
Telfer JC: Scavenger receptor WC1 contributes to the
gamma delta T cell responses to Leptospira, submitted)
and WC1-mediated potentiation of T cell activation
requires the phosphorylation of a tyrosine in its cytoplasmic domain [35]. Moreover, expression of different
molecular forms of WC1 on bovine γδ T cells is correlated with differential response to bacteria, suggesting
that WC1 functions as a pattern recognition molecule
similar to the related SRCR molecules CD163A, CD5,
CD6, Spα and DMBT1 [13,14,36-40]. No WC1 homologues have thus far been identified in human or murine

γδ T cells, leading to the question of whether CD163 family members, particularly CD163c-α molecules, have
evolved to serve functions equivalent to WC1 in mammals other than the artiodactyls.
In our recent annotation of the bovine genome we
found the gene encoding CD163A embedded within the
region coding for WC1 genes [31]. To determine the
extent of the CD163 family in artiodactyls, we annotated
the bovine genome to identify CD163 family genes in cattle. We found genes encoding both CD163A and
CD163c-α, but not CD163b, and evaluated their expression profile in γδ T cells and other tissues. Incorrect
assignment of genes belonging to the CD163 and the
WC1 families from many species has created substantial
confusion in naming and categorizing these genes. To
appropriately categorize the genes identified both by us
and by others, we undertook phylogenetic analyses of
CD163 and WC1 family members. Here, we show the
relationship between CD163A, CD163c-α and WC1 family receptors, all expressed in γδ T cells of artiodactyls,
that WC1 orthologues are present in the chicken and
platypus, and correlate the conservation over evolutionary time of a diverse array of these receptors with the
presence of a high level of γδ T cells in the peripheral
blood.

Results
Exon-intron structure of bovine CD163 family members

Annotation of the bovine genome indicated that cattle
have a gene coding for CD163A, which was found on
chromosome 5 within one of the two loci coding for the
large WC1 family of genes [31]. A gene coding for bovine
CD163c-α was also found but could not be placed in the
bovine genome due to insufficient scaffolding. Schematics of the exon-intron structure of these two genes are
shown in Fig. 1. Both CD163A and CD163c-α contain a
cytoplasmic domain coded for by two exons, one of
which also encodes the transmembrane domain. Interestingly, like WC1, both CD163A and CD163c-α contain an
exon that encodes interdomain sequence (Fig. 1, ID) [31].
The gene encoding CD163A spans approximately 30 kbp;
that of CD163c-α spans approximately 12 kbp.
The CD163c-α amino acid sequence generated by automated prediction lacked a transmembrane region that
was correlated with a gap in the genomic sequence at the
expected location of the exon encoding the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1B). We investigated whether bovine
CD163c-α has a transmembrane domain by amplifying
and sequencing cDNA template from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells using primers designed from known
sequences in the genomic sequence, which bracketed the
putative transmembrane region. We obtained transmembrane domain sequence in the same frame as known
sequence upstream and downstream (Fig. 2B), indicating

Figure 1 Schematic representation of bovine CD163 exon-intron structure. Exon-intron structures of (A) CD163A and (B) CD163c-α were determined based on annotation of the CD163 genes in the bovine genome assembly Btau_3.1. Proposed placement of the exon encoding CD163c-α
transmembrane region is shown in grey and could not be confirmed due to a gap in the genomic sequence assembly. SRCR domain numbers are
indicated by roman numerals. Scale is shown in base pair increments beneath the schematic. Abbreviations are as follows: ID, interdomain sequence;

that the bovine CD163c-α is a transmembrane receptor.
The bovine homologue of the human gene encoding
CD163b was not found in the bovine genome assembly
Btau 3.1, which could reflect its absence or a relatively
large gap in the sequenced bovine genome.
Bovine CD163 sequences

Based on the manual annotation of the bovine CD163c-α
and CD163A gene sequences (Fig. 1), we designed primers to amplify CD163A and CD163c-α transcripts.
Deduced amino acid sequences based on the obtained
cDNA sequence of CD163A (Fig. 2A) and on both the
annotated genomic sequence and obtained cDNA
sequence (shaded) of CD163c-α (Fig. 2B) were used to
evaluate their predicted protein structures. Bovine
CD163A has nine SRCR domains and bovine CD163c-α
has eight SRCR domains in their extracellular regions,
which are underlined in the predicted protein (Fig. 2).
Most of the SRCR domains conform to the eight-cysteine
consensus of SRCR group B. The exceptions are the
eighth SRCR domain of bovine CD163A and the fifth
SRCR domain of bovine CD163c-α. These SRCR domains
lack the second and seventh cysteines, which form a disulfide bond in most, but not all, other SRCR group B
domains. Estimates of the evolutionary divergence
between SRCR domain amino acid sequences confirm

that bovine CD163A is most similar to human CD163A
(Table 1) and that bovine CD163c-α is most similar to
human CD163c-α (Table 2) in both the order of SRCR
domains and sequence identity. Bovine CD163A is identical to human CD163A in its SRCR domain organization,
and highly similar in its sequence with 82% overall
sequence identity. Bovine CD163c-α is identical to
human CD163c-α in its SRCR domain organization and
68% identical in overall sequence. The evolutionary
divergence between bovine CD163A or bovine CD163c-α
SRCR domains and bovine WC1 SRCR domains is
greater (Table 3), indicating that the genes we have identified as bovine CD163A or bovine CD163c-α are not WC1
genes. The sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of
CD163c-α and CD163A from cattle do not exhibit significant sequence identity to each other (data not shown),
although they contain the tyrosine-based motifs of YEDI
and YREM respectively.
Expression profiles of bovine CD163A and CD163c-α

A variety of tissues were examined for expression of
bovine CD163 transcripts including mesenteric lymph
node (MLN), lung, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes
(IELs, containing approximately 20% γδ T cells, data not
shown) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
PBMC were evaluated both as ex vivo cells and following

The number of amino acid differences per site from analysis between sequences is shown. All results are based on the pairwise analysis of 26
sequences. Standard error estimates are shown in parentheses and were obtained by using analytical formulas. Analyses were conducted using
the amino p-distance model in MEGA4 [64]. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion
option). There were a total of 78 positions in the final dataset. Estimates below 0.500 are in boldtype, and values on the diagonal corresponding
to a high level of identity between sequences are underlined. SRCR domains are labelled with alphabetical designations as previously defined
and by inferring the evolutionary relationships between SRCR domains using the Neighbor-Joining and Bayesian methods [1,65,69].

activation by Con A. Based on expressed sequence tag
(EST) analysis in the NCBI UniGene database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=unigene, it was
predicted that bovine CD163c-α is expressed in the intestine and that bovine CD163A is expressed in the intestine
and mesenteric lymph node (MLN). Interestingly, we
found CD163A to be expressed in all tissues evaluated
(Fig. 3A) and not just in intestine and MLN. Surprisingly,
we found that CD163A is also expressed on WC1+ and γδ
TCR+ as well as WC1- and γδ TCR- cells sorted from ex
vivo PBMC (Fig. 3B) indicating that the expression of

A

bovine CD163A is not restricted to monocytes and macrophages, as is the case in humans [5,41].
We found that CD163c-α transcripts were relatively
higher in PBMC, MLN and IELs, than in lung (Fig. 3A),
consistent with expression in leukocytes. The CD163c-α
family member SCART2 has been shown to be expressed
in murine γδ T cells [25]. To test the hypothesis that
bovine CD163c-α is expressed on a T cell subset separate
from the WC1+ γδ T cell subset, we evaluated the expression of bovine CD163c-α on WC1+, WC1-, γδ TCR+ and
γδ TCR- cells sorted from ex vivo PBMC (Fig. 3B). We
found that CD163c-α was preferentially expressed in the

Analysis of CD163 and WC1 SRCR domains

We undertook a phylogenetic analysis of CD163 family
members and their closest molecular relative, WC1, with
the goal of understanding the evolution and function of
WC1 and CD163 family members. We performed multiple alignments of individual SRCR domains in bovine
CD163c-α and bovine CD163A with defined SRCR
domains from bovine WC1 and human CD163A [1]. The
SRCR domains from bovine WC1 and human CD163A
have previously been assigned an alphabet letter designation "a", "b", "c", "d", "d' ", "e", "h", "i", "j", or "k" [1]. SRCR
domains in bovine CD163c-α and bovine CD163A that
clustered in the same clades as these previously designated SRCR domains (Fig. 4A, indicated by asterisks)
were assigned the same designation. SRCR domains that
clustered in separate clades from the clades containing
already designated SRCR domains were assigned the new
alphabet letter designations "m", "n" and "l" (Fig. 4A,4B).
Phylograms obtained using Bayesian analysis (Fig. 4A)
showed that the first SRCR domain of bovine CD163c-α
(BtCD163cSRCR1) and the first SRCR domains of
CD163c-α-like molecules from the duck-billed platypus
(OraCD163_4SRCR1,
OraCD163_5SRCR1
and
OraCD163_7SRCR1) are in the same clade as the first
SRCR domain of primate, rodent and canine CD163c-α
(designated "m"). The clade containing the fifth SRCR
domain (designated "n") in bovine CD163c-α also
includes SRCR domains from CD163c-α-like molecules
from eutherian mammals, the duck-billed platypus and
the chicken (Fig. 4A). The second SRCR domain of
bovine CD163c-α (BtCD163cSRCR1) clusters in the same
clade as other SRCR domains designated "l" from eutherian mammals and the duck-billed platypus (Fig. 4A).
SRCR domains that we have designated as "d" are clustered in sister clades to defined "d" SRCR domains by
Bayesian analysis: however, their designation as domain
"d" is also supported by their position in the protein in
reference to other SRCR domains (Fig.4B). Several SRCR
domains from chicken CD163 molecules clustered apart
from the "d" SRCR domain; although, their identification
as "d" SRCR domains is suggested by their position in the
protein (e.g. GgCD163_1 SRCR4). These SRCR domains
were left undesignated (Fig. 4A,4B). The first six SRCR
domains of human CD163b do not reproducibly cluster
in the same clade as other defined SRCR domains and
were also left undesignated (Fig. 4A,4B). Notably,
CD163b has thus far been found only in primates and
horses. It is also of note that SRCR domain "k", which
appears to be diagnostic of CD163A or CD163b, does not
appear in any of the annotated genes from the duck-billed

Page 10 of 19

platypus or the chicken, suggesting that CD163A or
CD163b is not encoded in these animals' genomes. Thus,
there appear to be at least 4 types of CD163 family members, not all of which appear in every species, and some of
which are duplicated within a species: CD163A, CD163b,
CD163c-α, and WC1.
Most of the CD163 molecules, especially those with a
transmembrane domain, contain the usually membrane
proximal "d' " and "e" SRCR domains (Fig. 4B). These
domains from chicken and duck-billed platypus cluster
together within each species, whereas CD163A "d' " and
"e" SRCR domains from eutherian mammals are found in
separate sub-clades from CD163b, CD163c-α, and WC1
"d' " and "e" SRCR domains from eutherian mammals (Fig.
4A).
Relationship of CD163c-α and WC1

The relationship of CD163c-α to WC1 is particularly
intriguing since WC1 expression is restricted to γδ T cells
and CD163c-α expression is enriched in WC1+γδ T cells
(Fig. 3B). When we performed a multiple SRCR domain
alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of CD163 proteins across multiple species, we found that the SRCR
domain structure and organization of bovine CD163c-α
(m-l-b-c-n-d-e-d') is most similar to CD163c-α from
other eutherian mammalian species, such as human,
chimpanzee, dog, and mouse and rat. The SRCR domains
"m" and "l" and "n" were unique to CD163c-α molecules
and were not found to occur in bovine or swine WC1, nor
did they occur in the other CD163 family members
CD163A or human CD163b (Fig. 4A,4B). Domains "m",
"l", and "n" clustered in separate clades than the WC1
domain "a", as well as from the first six SRCR domains
from CD163b and SRCR domains "h", "i", "j", and "k" from
CD163A (Fig. 4A,4B).
The chicken and the duck-billed platypus possess more
CD163 genes than primates, dogs or rodents, displaying a
diverse repertoire more similar to that seen with WC1
genes in the artiodactyls. The chicken possesses at least
eighteen CD163 genes while the duck-billed platypus has
at least ten CD163 genes. Seven of the chicken CD163
genes and three of the duck-billed platypus CD163 genes
contained SRCR domains that clustered in the clade containing WC1 SRCR domain "a" (Fig. 4A). This is notable
because domain "a" is the source of most of the diversity
in WC1 family members and is thus thought to be the
most likely SRCR domain to be responsible for WC1 isoform-specific function [31]. Chicken CD163_3 and platypus CD163_2 were the closest to bovine WC1 in
extracellular SRCR organization, with SRCR domain
organization of (a-b-c-a-b-c-x-e-d') and (a-c-d-d'),
respectively, compared to the bovine WC1 SRCR domain
organization of (a-b-c-d-e-d-b-c-d-e-d') (Fig. 4B). Six
chicken CD163 proteins show a hybrid SRCR domain

Figure 4 CD163 family member SRCR domain organization and cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motifs. >(A) CD163 family members from multiple
species were identified by BLAST searches with bovine WC1, CD163A and CD163c-α SRCR and cytoplasmic domains. The evolutionary history of 242
taxa was inferred, using MrBayes3.2 to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees, shown at branch nodes [65]. SRCR domains clustering in a clade
with pre-defined SRCR domains (asterisks) were identified and SRCR domains clustered together, but not in association with known SRCR domains,
were assigned a new letter designation [1]. Rattus norvegicus (Rn) CD163c-α, Pan troglodytes (Pt) CD163c-α, Canis lupus familiaris (Clf) CD163c_1 and
ClfCD163c_2, Gallus gallus (Gg) CD163_1 through GgCD163_18, and Ornithorhynchus anatinus (Ora) CD163_1 through OraCD163_10 are predicted
from genomic sequence; Bos taurus (Bt) WC1, Sus scrofa (Ss) WC1, Homo sapiens (Hs) CD163c-α (partial cDNA, corrected from genomic sequence), Mus
musculus (Mm) SCART1, MmSCART2, HsCD163A and HsCD163b cDNA have been isolated. (B) Summary of CD163 family member SRCR domain organization and cytoplasmic tyrosine based motifs. SRCR domain assignments were made as shown in Fig. 4A, with confirmation by analysis utilizing the
Neighbor-Joining algorithm with the JTT model (data not shown). CD163 family members with transmembrane domains are shown with the plasma
membrane and location of the transmembrane domains represented by the horizontal line. Tyrosine-based signalling motifs similar to that found in
BtWC1 are shown [35]. CD163 family members without transmembrane domains are shown horizontally, with the N-terminus on the left.

Herzig et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:181

organization that is intermediate between WC1 and
CD163c-α, with the SRCR domain "a" diagnostic of WC1
and SRCR domain "n" diagnostic of CD163c-α. For example, chicken CD163_1 and CD163_8 possess a N-terminal
domain "a" characteristic of WC1 but an SRCR domain
cassette (c-n-d-e-d') characteristic of CD163c-α. In contrast, CD163 molecules from the duck-billed platypus
contain either the WC1- diagnostic domain "a", or
CD163c-α-diagnostic domains "m","l", or "n", but not
both.
The consensus group B SRCR domain contains eight
cysteines, with disulfide bonds formed between the first
and fourth, the second and seventh, the third and eighth,
and the fifth and sixth cysteines [42]. Some of the SRCR
domains lack the second and/or the seventh cysteine,
which results in a predicted SRCR domain with only
three disulfide bonds rather than four disulfide bonds.
However, MmSCART2_SRCR3 (missing C2, C4 and C7),
Gg_1SRCR2 (missing C5, C7, and C8), Gg_4SRCR7
(missing C7 and C8), Gg_5SRCR7 (missing C7 and C8),
OraCD163_3SRCR2
(missing
C6
and
C7),
OraCD163_7SRCR4 (missing C1), OraCD163_9SRCR2
(missing C2, C6, and C7), and OraCD163_6SRCR4 (missing C2, C6, and C7) are missing additional cysteines
resulting in SRCR-like domains with only one to three
potential disulfide bonds. It is not known how these
changes will affect SRCR domain structure and function.
Relationship of cytoplasmic sequences

Several of the WC1-like or CD163-α-like molecules from
chicken or duck-billed platypus do not have transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains; although, they are predicted open reading frames from genomic sequence and
may not be complete. The cytoplasmic domain of chicken
CD163_14, defined as being C-terminal to a transmembrane domain, is unusual in that it is not similar in
sequence to other CD163 family members, but instead
contains a SRCR domain (Fig. 4B). The cytoplasmic
domains of bovine or human CD163A or human CD163b
do not have any significant sequence identity with the
cytoplasmic domains of CD163c-α-like or WC1-like molecules; although bovine and human CD163A have the
tyrosine-based motif YREM in their cytoplasmic domains
(Fig. 4B). We performed multiple amino acid alignment
and phylogenetic tree analysis of the other cytoplasmic
domains of CD163c-α-like and WC1 molecules and
found that the cytoplasmic domains from canine
ClfCD163_1, chicken and platypus CD163 molecules
cluster more closely with the cytoplasmic domains of
bovine and swine WC1, than with the cytoplasmic
domains of canine ClfCD163_2, primate, bovine, and
rodent CD163c-α (Fig. 5A).
Strikingly, all CD163c-α-like molecules from primate,
canine, rodent, bovine, monotreme and bird species

Page 12 of 19

share a Y-(Q/E)-(D/C/E)-(I/L) motif with WC1, with the
exception of chicken CD163_15, which has a threonine in
place of the isoleucine or leucine (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation of the YEEL tyrosine motif in WC1 is required for its
potentiation of T cell activation, suggesting that WC1
and CD163c-α may signal via the same mechanism [35].

Discussion
Many genes that have been predicted to belong to the
CD163 family have been erroneously classified as
CD163A or CD163b homologues in their Entrez Gene
reports. For example, ClfCD163_2, RnCD163c-α and
MmSCART1 are referred to as similar to M160 or
CD163L1, which are alternative names for CD163b,
despite their greater similarity to CD163c-α in their
SRCR identity and organization and in their cytoplasmic
domain sequence. GgCD163_10 is referred to as CD5like, despite showing greater sequence similarity to
CD163c-α than CD5. Other genes from the chicken and
platypus that are most similar to CD163c-α and WC1 are
referred to as similar to CD163v2 and CD163v3, which
are names for alternatively spliced isoforms of CD163A.
It has been speculated that the plethora of CD163 molecules in the platypus are CD163A homologues important
for regulating blood serum levels of free hemoglobin,
instead of CD163c-α or WC1 homologues, which are
more likely to be involved in the immune response [43].
In this study, we show that these genes encode CD163c-α,
WC1, or CD163c-α/WC1-like proteins, based on the
sequence of their SRCR and/or cytoplasmic domains.
Genes coding for WC1-like proteins in non-artiodactyls
have not been previously identified. SRCR domains "e "
and "d' " (Fig. 4A) and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 5A) that
are common to many CD163 molecules across species
cluster in sub-clades characterized by eutherian mammalian, platypus or chicken origin, suggesting that gene conversion in multi-gene families over millions of years of
evolution has driven homogeneity [44]. Artiodactyls,
platypus and chicken all display an expansion of WC1/
CD163c-α-like genes (Fig. 6). The platypus and the
chicken do not have a CD163A gene, suggesting that
CD163A has evolved since the divergence of eutherian
mammals from monotremes. In contrast, eutherian
mammals have one CD163A gene and non-artiodactyl
eutherian mammals have a maximum of two CD163c-α
genes. This suggests that expression of multiple WC1/
CD163c-α genes is the ancestral state and that eutherian
mammals other than artiodactyls have lost multiple
WC1/CD163c-α genes, since mammals diverged from
the sauropsid lineage leading to birds and reptiles 315
million years ago [43]. In a similar finding, the platypus,
sheep and cow share an expansion of the cathelicidin
antimicrobial peptide gene family, whereas primates and
rodents have only a single cathelicidin gene [45]. The pri-

mate or rodent cathelicidin must function equivalently to
the plethora of cathelicidins in the platypus or ruminants;
analogously, the one or two CD163c-α molecules in nonartiodactyl eutherian mammals may fulfil a function like
that of WC1, in regulating the γδ T cell response.
Chickens, cattle and sheep are known to have a high
percentage of γδ T cells in their peripheral blood. They
are referred to as "γδ T cell high" species. In contrast,
mice and humans have lower numbers of γδ T cells in
their peripheral blood and are referred to as "γδ T cell
low" species [46]. It is not known whether the duck-billed
platypus is a γδ T cell high or γδ T cell low species, but it
does possess γδ T cells [47]. We show that the chicken
and platypus have multiple CD163c-α/WC1-like genes, a
circumstance that is similar to the multiple WC1 genes in

the genomes of the artiodactyls. We hypothesize that a
diverse array of CD163c-α/WC1 SRCR transmembrane
receptors conveys a selective advantage to the immune
response to pathogens by γδ T cells and that WC1 and
CD163c-α genes have been conserved because they play
an important role in the response to pathogens.
Phosphorylation of the second tyrosine in the WC1
cytoplasmic domain is required for WC1-mediated
potentiation of T cell activation though the TCR, thus,
the conservation of this motif in WC1-like and CD163cα-like genes over millions of years of evolution supports
our hypothesis that CD163c-α plays a role similar to
WC1 as a co-receptor to an activating receptor [35]. In
contrast, it is unknown if the tyrosine-based motif YREM
in CD163A of human or cattle is a phosphorylation target

Herzig et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:181
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/181

or whether it participates in membrane proximal signaling by CD163A after ligation of this receptor. Phosphorylation of CD163A by the serine/threonine kinases casein
kinase II and protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) is tied to
cytokine production induced by CD163A cross-linking
[19]. Detection of transcripts for bovine CD163A in
sorted WC1 + and γδ+ T cells, as well as in tissues containing monocytes and macrophages, suggests that bovine
CD163A may play a role in the regulation of the γδ+ T cell
immune response, either through activation of transmembrane CD163A or proteolytic cleavage and release of
soluble CD163A.
The characterization of the extracellular SRCR structure of WC1 and CD163 family members may help to isolate their ligands, which in turn would help us to better
understand their role in the γδ T cell response. The role
of WC1 and the proposed role for CD163c-α are consistent with other group B SRCR family transmembrane
receptors expressed on T cells, such as CD5 and CD6.
CD6 binds to the protein ALCAM/CD166 [48]. CD5 has
been shown to bind to various proteins, including CD72,
a 40-80 kDa glycoprotein expressed on murine B splenocytes and activated T cells, a human 150 kDa glycoprotein expressed on peripheral blood monocytes, certain
IgVH framework sequences and a bovine 200 kDa protein
expressed on activated B cells [49-54]. Ligation of CD5 or
CD6 affects responses through the T cell receptor and B
cell signaling and lymphocyte activation [55,56]. It is
known that SRCR molecules also bind to molecules other
than proteins; for example, the group B SRCR molecules
Spα, CD6, DMBT1 and CD163A bind to bacteria and Spα
and CD6 specifically bind to the bacterial products
lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
[1,13,14,39,57]. The SRCR domains in WC1 or bovine
CD163c-α do not have the bacteria-binding motif found
in multiple SRCR domains of DMBT1 [58]. However, the
requirement for expression of specific WC1 receptors for
the γδ T cell response to the bacteria Leptospira (Wang F,
Herzig CTA, Hsu H, Chen C, Baldwin CL, Telfer JC:
Scavenger receptor WC1 contributes to the γδ T cell
responses to Leptospira, submitted) suggests that WC1/
CD163c-α could recognize pathogen-associated molecules or a protein whose expression is induced by exposure to Leptospira. Although the ligands for WC1 and
CD163c-α are unknown, domains 9 (d) and 11 (d') of
bovine WC1 interact with an unknown molecule on the
surface of macrophages or dendritic cells [59]. In contrast, another CD163 family member, CD163A, is known
to bind haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes and TWEAK
through its third SRCR domain ("j") and to bacteria or a
molecule on erythroblasts via its second SRCR domain
("i") [10-13]. Neither of these domains occurs in either
WC1 or CD163c-α, suggesting that CD163c-α ligation
could be mediated by its unique domains "m", "l", or "n",

Page 15 of 19

and that it does not bind to haptoglobin-hemoglobin
complexes. Since most of the diversity of bovine WC1 is
found in domain "a", it is a reasonable candidate for the
ligand-binding domain of the WC1 multi-gene family,
which confers diversity on the γδ T cell response to
pathogens.

Conclusions
We have annotated the genes encoding CD163c-α and
CD163A in cattle and shown that bovine CD163A is
expressed in tissues containing monocytes and macrophages, as well as in sorted γδ T cells. The expression of
bovine CD163c-α is enriched in WC1+ γδ T cells and it
shares the conserved tyrosine motif necessary for WC1
signalling in T cells, implying that it functions similarly to
WC1 in acting as a co-receptor for the γδ TCR. We have
characterized CD163c-α and WC1/CD163c-α gene products in multiple species, correcting the incorrect assignment of many of them as CD163A gene products. The
expansion of WC1, CD163c-α and WC1/CD163c-α genes
is correlated with a high level of γδ T cells in the peripheral blood of species separated by approximately 300 million years of evolution, suggesting that a diverse array of
these molecules conveys a selective advantage to the γδ T
cell response. Future studies will address the significant
questions of both the signalling potential of CD163c-α
and CD163A in γδ T cells and the identification of
ligands for CD163c-α/WC1 molecules.
Methods
Genome annotation

In conjunction with the Bovine Genome Sequencing
Consortium http://genomes.arc.georgetown.edu/drupal/
bovine/, manual annotation of the CD163 genes was performed using the Apollo Genome Annotation and Curation Tool, version 1.6.5 and the bovine genome assembly
Btau_3.1 [60]. Putative CD163 genes were identified by
performing a BLAST search with orthologous mouse and
human genes against the Bovine Official Gene Set (called
GLEAN). The predicted gene models identified from the
search included GLEAN_00453 for CD163A and
GLEAN_14183 for CD163c-α. These were analyzed using
the Apollo software and annotated based on available
EST evidence and BLAST search results.
Sequence analyses

Nucleotide sequences were aligned and consensus
sequences were created using BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [61].
Exon/intron structure schematics were based on alignments of cDNA and genomic DNA sequence using SIM4
and visualization with LalnView http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/
software/lalnview.html[62].
Amino acid sequences used for comparison in phylogenetic analyses and their accession numbers are described

in Additional file 1, Table S1. SRCR domains were identified according to the group B SRCR consensus and compared to HsCD163A, HsCD163c-α, BtWC1, HsDBMT1,
HsCD5, and HsCD6 [42]. Molecules containing group B
SRCR domains clustering with CD163 family members
were defined as CD163 family members; molecules containing group A SRCR domains or SRCR group B
domains clustering with HsDBMT1, HsCD5 and HsCD6
were excluded from analysis. Genomic WC1 cytoplasmic
domain sequences used for comparison here have been
previously described [31]. Multiple sequence alignments
were performed using Clustal X 2.0.8 [63]. Pairwise and
multiple alignment penalties for gaps were 10.0, 0.10 for
gap extension and Gonnet 250 for protein weight matrix.
Alignments were refined in MacClade 4.08. Phylogenetic
trees were created using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm
in MEGA4 and Bayesian analysis in MrBayes3.2 [64,65].
For Bayesian analysis, 2 runs with 3 cold chains and 1
heated chain each were done. An amino acid mixed
model was used to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees. The 242-taxa SRCR domain alignment was
run independently three times, with temperature settings
of 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25, for 2.6, 2.0, and 2.5 million generations respectively. Trees were sampled every 100 generations and the burnin fraction was 0.5. The convergence
diagnostic used was the average standard deviation of
split frequencies, which were < 0.05 (0.0427, 0.031, and
0.030) for the three runs. The consensus trees from the
three runs had the same overall topology. The consensus
tree from the run set to temperature 0.25 and 2.5 million
generations (average standard deviation of split frequencies 0.030, average potential scale reduction factor 1.016)
is shown in this paper. The 34-taxa cytoplasmic domain
alignment was run once with a temperature setting of 0.2
for 830,000 generations. Trees were sampled every 100
generations and the burnin fraction was 0.25. The average standard deviation of split frequencies was 0.01 and
the average potential scale reduction factor was 1.003.
Phylograms were visualized using TreeView X 0.5.0 [66].
Animals, cells and tissues

Belted Galloway cattle of between 1 and 2 years of age
were housed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst
according to institutional and USDA guidelines. Animal
protocols were approved by the University of Massachusetts Amherst institutional animal care and use committee. Blood was obtained via jugular venipuncture and
collected into a solution of heparin. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood via
density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) by standard
techniques. Culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 μM 2-ME.

Page 16 of 19

PBMC were cultured at 2.5 × 10 6 cells/ml with Concanavalin (ConA 1.0 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
at 37°C with 5% CO2 in air for 3 days where indicated. For
evaluation of CD163 expression in intestine, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were isolated from the ileum of
two-month old cattle using nonenzymatic methods [67].
IELs were stained for cell surface differentiation molecules, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed via
flow cytometry (LSR II, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
using the following primary monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs): CC15 (pan-WC1; Serotec, Raleigh, NC), GB21A
(δ TCR; VMRD, Pullman, WA), and IL-A12 (CD4;) [68].
Secondary antibodies used were isotype-specific polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Flow cytometric data was analyzed using
FlowJo version 7.2.2 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Purified γδ T cells and WC1 + γδ T cells were obtained
from ex vivo PBMC by magnetic bead sorting (MACS;
Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Cells were suspended in
PBS containing 6% heat-inactivated horse serum and
incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) GB21A or
CC15 for 20 min on ice, washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mM EDTA and
resuspended in the same along with goat anti-mouse IgG
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were purified over pre-cooled
MS-separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec); the positive
and negative fractions were collected and each was
passed over an additional separation column in order to
optimize purity. Purity was assessed by flow cytometry
and was found to be 99.6% for γδ T cells, 98.1% for γδ T
cell-depleted cells, 95.5% for WC1+ γδ T cells and 92.7%
for WC1+ γδ T cell-depleted cells.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Pelleted ex vivo or ConA-activated PBMC, sorted cells,
and IELs were resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen). MLN
and lung tissue samples frozen in TRIzol were thawed
and homogenized. RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturer's protocol. For RNA isolation from sorted
cells, glycogen (Invitrogen) was added to the aqueous
phase prior to RNA precipitation. Reverse transcription
(RT) was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo dT
primers and AMV reverse transcriptase (AMV RT kit;
Promega, Madison, WI). Prior to RT reactions, RNA
derived from MLN and lung was treated using RQ1
RNase-Free DNase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μl of cDNA was used as template in
subsequent PCR reactions.
Primer pair sequences used to obtain CD163A and
CD163c-α cDNA sequences are as follows: (1)
CD163Autr-for 5'-GAG TGG ACA AAC TCA GAA
TGG TG and CD163A-rev2 5'-GAG GAA TTA TAT
