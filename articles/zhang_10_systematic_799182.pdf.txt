Abstract
Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that non-protein-coding RNAs (npcRNAs/ncRNAs) play important
roles during eukaryotic development, species evolution, and in the etiology of disease. Rhesus macaques are the
most widely used primate model in both biomedical research and primate evolutionary studies. However, most
reports on these animals focus on the functional roles of protein-coding sequences, whereas very little is known
about macaque ncRNAs.
Results: In the present study, we performed the first systematic profiling of intermediate-size ncRNAs (50 to 500
nt) from the rhesus monkey by constructing a cDNA library. We identified 117 rhesus monkey ncRNAs, including
80 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 29 other types of known RNAs (snRNAs, Y RNA, and others), and eight
unclassified ncRNAs. Comparative genomic analysis and northern blot hybridizations demonstrated that some
snoRNAs were lineage- or species-specific. Paralogous sequences were found for most rhesus monkey snoRNAs,
the expression of which might be attributable to extensive duplication within the rhesus monkey genome. Further
investigation of snoRNA flanking sequences showed that some rhesus monkey snoRNAs are retrogenes derived
from L1-mediated integration. Finally, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that birds and primates share some
snoRNAs and host genes thereof, suggesting that both the relevant host genes and the snoRNAs contained
therein may be inherited from a common ancestor. However, some rhesus monkey snoRNAs hosted by nonribosome-related genes appeared after the evolutionary divergence between birds and mammals.
Conclusions: We provide the first experimentally-derived catalog of rhesus monkey ncRNAs and uncover some
interesting genomic and evolutionary features. These findings provide important information for future functional
characterization of snoRNAs during primate evolution.

Background
It is widely accepted that up to 90% of the human genome is transcribed into various types of RNAs [1-4].
However, only a very small proportion of transcripts
(~2-3%) encode proteins. Although there is a possibility
that many transcripts are simply noise [5], a considerable number of non-protein-coding RNAs (npcRNAs/
ncRNAs) are produced [1-4]. The increasing numbers of
ncRNAs found by systematic genome-wide screening
have also demonstrated the widespread existence of

ncRNAs in nature [6-9]. The ncRNAs can be categorized by length as 19~35 nt small ncRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs [10-12]; intermediate-size ncRNAs,
ranging between 50 and 500 nt, such as the small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) [13]; and long mRNA-like
ncRNAs with sizes larger than 500 nt [14-18].
snoRNAs function mainly as modulators of ribosomal
RNAs (rRNAs) [19], and represent the largest group of
functional ncRNAs. Based on sequence and structural
features, snoRNAs can be classified into two familiesbox C/D snoRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs-which
guide site-specific 2’-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of rRNA, respectively [20,21]. The spectrum of snoRNA targets is continuously growing. Some
snoRNAs control methylation of tRNAs [22,23]. Small

box C/D and/or box H/ACA, regulate post-transcriptional modification of RNA polymerase II-transcribed
snRNAs [24]. Recent findings have demonstrated that
snoRNA can also target mRNA, to guide alternative
splicing [25]. Another interesting discovery is that snoRNAs may be precursors of microRNAs and possess
microRNA-like functions [26,27]. Together, available
evidence suggests that snoRNAs may have broader functions than previously appreciated.
The genomic organization of snoRNA genes displays
great diversity in different organisms. Unlike yeast and
plants, in which snoRNAs are usually transcribed from
independent polymerase II transcription units with dedicated promoters [28], most vertebrate snoRNAs reside
in the introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding
genes and are generated by splicing-dependent processing [29,30]. Intron-encoded snoRNAs may also have
special promoters to drive snoRNA transcription [31].
Many snoRNA genes have multiple paralogs derived
from one or more duplications [32]. In nematodes, the
paralogs of intron-encoded snoRNA genes were likely
generated by cis- and trans-duplication mechanisms
[23]. Luo and Li demonstrated that most human box H/
ACA snoRNAs were retrogenes produced by L1 integration [33]. Weber reported that many mammalian snoRNAs were mobile genetic elements designated as
snoRNA/scaRNA retroposons (snoRTs, scaRTs) [34].
Recently, Schmitz and colleagues discovered a platypusspecific snoRNA retroposon with powerful transposable
activity that replicated a single snoRNA to form about
40,000 paralogs in the whole genome [35]. It is therefore
possible that retroposition of snoRNA genes may have
played an important role during evolution of mammalian genomes.
Based on these recent findings, it is likely that
ncRNAs have important functions in almost every
aspect of eukaryotic growth regulation. However, only a
limited number and classes of ncRNAs have been discovered to date. Therefore, systematic identification of
ncRNAs from various organisms is a critical primary
step in the provision of a road map for functional studies of ncRNAs in various organisms. The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most thoroughly studied
primate apart from humans. Although phylogenetically
separated by more than 70 million years of evolution
[36,37], rhesus macaques and humans are closely related
and share a common ancestor dating back to about 25
million years ago [36,38]. Therefore, study of rhesus
monkeys assists primate evolutionary research and modern biomedical programs [38,39]. A total of 21,905 protein-coding genes and 5,253 non-protein coding genes
(including 715 predicted snoRNA loci) have been identified in the rhesus monkey genome by the ENSEMBL
genome annotation group [6]. Although the expression

pattern and possible functions of many protein-coding
genes have been reported, identification of non-proteincoding genes of the rhesus monkey has relied only on
computational predictions, by searching for sequences
similar to those of known ncRNAs identified in other
species. Such an approach is obviously inappropriate for
identification of novel ncRNAs. Here, we conducted a
systematic experimental identification of rhesus monkey
ncRNAs by constructing a cDNA library derived from
RNA fragments with sizes of 50 to 500 nt. We identified
117 non-redundant ncRNAs, including 80 snoRNAs and
eight unclassified ncRNAs. We found that some of our
identified ncRNAs were lineage- or species-specific.
Further analysis of the genomic organization of these
ncRNAs demonstrated that the majority represented
snoRNAs with multiple paralogs in the rhesus monkey
genome. Detailed analysis of the flanking sequences of
each of the snoRNA paralogs revealed that some snoRNAs were retrogenes generated through L1-mediated
integration machinery, suggesting that retroposonmediated trans-duplication may have been a driving
force for expansion of novel snoRNAs in the rhesus
monkey genome.

Results
Systematic identification of rhesus monkey ncRNAs by
analysis of a cDNA library

Full-length intermediate-size ncRNA-enriched libraries
(50~500 nt) were constructed using a previously
described method [31], with minor modifications. This
ensured that the libraries contained a substantial proportion of full-length ncRNA clones with defined 5’ and 3’
termini. The RNA used in library construction was
extracted from the heart and skeletal muscle tissue of
rhesus monkey. In total, 4,844 clones from two fulllength cDNA libraries were sequenced. After discarding
matches to tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs, the remaining
835 sequences were considered to be putative ncRNAs
and analyzed further. By merging redundant sequences
and comparing the sequences and secondary structures
of such putative ncRNAs with known ncRNAs annotated
in the ENSEMBL and Rfam databases, the 835 clones
were classified into 117 ncRNAs, including 80 snoRNAs
(32 C/D box snoRNAs and 48 H/ACA box snoRNAs)
representing 64 snoRNA families, 17 snRNAs, one 7SK
RNA, six Y RNAs, two 7SL RNAs (SRP-RNA), one vault
RNA, one ribonuclease P RNA component H1 (RPPH1),
one RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing
endoribonuclease (RMRP), and eight unclassified ncRNA
candidates (Figure 1 and Additional File 1).
All rhesus monkey snoRNAs identified in this study
have known human homologs. Among 80 rhesus snoRNAs, 68 show perfect matches with the human homologs, whereas the other twelve rhesus snoRNAs are also

highly conserved between monkey and human, with
conservation scores over 0.96 (Table 1). In addition to
showing homology in sequence and/or secondary structure with known human snoRNAs, all of our cloned
snoRNAs had the conserved snoRNA motifs. In the 32
C/D box snoRNAs, we identified 52 pairs of the C/C’
box with the D/D’ box (Additional File 1). An H box
and an ACA box were also found in the secondary
structures of all H/ACA snoRNAs (Additional File 2).
We further searched the sequences of each rhesus monkey snoRNA and the human homolog. The data showed
that guide sequences and target sites were highly conserved between rhesus monkey and human (Additional
Files 3 and 4).
Expression patterns of the 117 ncRNAs in tissues of
rhesus monkey and other species

The expression of the 117 ncRNAs was confirmed by
northern blotting (Additional File 5). All tested ncRNAs
were expressed in the six examined tissues of rhesus
monkey (spleen, brain, kidney, liver, heart, and skeletal
muscle). Several quantitative differences in the expression abundance of ncRNAs were observed among different tissues, but no tissue-specific expression pattern
could be discerned. We also investigated expression of
the 117 monkey ncRNAs in the skeletal muscle tissue of
human, mouse, and chicken, by northern blotting (Additional File 5). Based on the observed expression patterns, the 117 ncRNAs could be classified into six
groups (Figure 2). Group 1 ncRNAs were expressed in
chicken, mouse, human, and all examined rhesus monkey tissues; group 2 ncRNAs were detected in monkey,
human, and mouse, but not in chicken; group 3 ncRNAs
were expressed in monkey and human; and group 4

ncRNAs were detected only in rhesus monkey tissues.
Interestingly, SNORD45 was expressed only in mouse
and monkey (group 5); SNORD50 was detected in
chicken, human, and rhesus monkey, but was absent
from the mouse (group 6). To rule out the possibility
that the lack of detectable signals in northern blotting
was caused by tissue-specific expression of lineage/species-specific ncRNAs, we investigated the synthesis of
these materials in nine human and mouse tissues, but
no signals were detected (Additional File 5).
Conservation analysis of rhesus ncRNAs using the
BLAST algorithm, as well as comparison with human,
mouse, and chicken genomic sequences, demonstrated
that most (96/117) lineage/species-specific expression
patterns were supported by sequence homology,
although expression of some highly conserved sequences
was not detected (Table 1). The expression patterns of
ten ncRNAs in groups 4, 5, and 6 were inconsistent
with the conservation scores of their genomic sequences
across different species. For example, eight ncRNAs of
group 4 showed conserved sequences but no detectable
expression in human tissues (Table 1 and Additional
File 5). It is possible that the homologs of these ncRNAs
are pseudogenes, or are expressed at levels below the
threshold of sensitivity of the northern blot. Alternatively, the homologs might be transcriptionally regulated
in a spatio-temporal fashion, or by physiological or
pathological stimuli/stresses, and would thus not be
constitutively expressed under normal conditions.
Comparative genomic analysis of rhesus monkey
snoRNAs

The secondary structures and functional boxes of snoRNAs were found to be highly conserved [21], but the

nucleotide sequences outside of the hallmark boxes and
the antisense regions of snoRNAs changed during vertebrate evolution. To investigate the sequence conservation of snoRNAs over the course of primate evolution,
we plotted the sequences of 64 rhesus monkey snoRNA
families against those of eight other primate genomes.
As genomic sequences of some species are incomplete,
only 25 snoRNA families showed identifiable homologs
in all eight primate species examined. Sequence alignment data showed that some snoRNAs sequences
diverged even among closely related primates. The
sequence alignments of the top five divergent snoRNAs
are shown in Additional File 6.
To determine when rhesus monkey snoRNAs
appeared during vertebrate evolution, we searched for
homologs of 58 rhesus monkey snoRNA families (six
families were excluded because of a lack of annotation
in either or both of the human and mouse datasets) in
seven other representative vertebrates, based on annotations in ENSEMBL Release 50 (Additional File 7).
Among the 58 rhesus monkey snoRNA families, 15
shared homologs even in zebrafish and medaka (Figure
3, Group 1), indicating that these snoRNAs appeared
early in vertebrate evolution. Eight snoRNA families
were detected in reptiles and evolutionarily later species
(Figure 3, Group 2), and 10 snoRNA families appeared
after the emergence of birds (Figure 3, Group 3). The
remaining 25 snoRNA families were present in mammals but clearly absent in birds and other non-

mammalian species (Figure 3, Groups 4-6). Thirteen of
25 mammalian snoRNA families did not have homologs
in the platypus genome (Group 5), suggesting a later
emergence in mammalian evolution. Finally, one
snoRNA without a homolog in the mouse may be primate-specific (Group 6).
SnoRNA expansion during vertebrate evolution

The total number of snoRNA-encoding genes increased
during vertebrate evolution, based on data from the
ENSEMBL genome annotation project [6]. We asked
whether this increment in snoRNA genes was attributable to the generation of multiple paralogs by duplication
mechanisms, or arose de novo by accumulation of
nucleotide mutations, or was attributable to the action
of other driving mechanisms. Of course, these possibilities may be combined. To address this question, we collected all predicted and validated snoRNA sequences
from eight representative vertebrate species represented
in the ENSEMBL database, including zebrafish, medaka,
frog, chicken, platypus, mouse, rhesus monkey, and
human, and calculated the total number of snoRNA
genes as well as the number of snoRNA families (any
snoRNA family could contain a single copy snoRNA or
have multiple paralogs in the genome). As shown in Figure 4A, the number of snoRNA families increased during vertebrate evolution, indicating a de novo origin of
snoRNA genes. In addition, the number of intronencoded snoRNAs rose significantly in birds and

patterns from each of the six groups of ncRNAs. The expression of 117 rhesus monkey ncRNAs was examined by northern blotting using 5 μg
aliquots of total RNA from monkey spleen, brain, kidney, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Total RNA from human, murine, and chicken skeletal
muscle were included in each RNA blot to test expression in different species. Based on northern blot analysis, the expression patterns in various
species could be classified into six types. One representative ncRNA from each of the six groups is shown. All ncRNAs are labeled as Name_size

thereafter appeared in mammals, contributing extensively to the expansion of snoRNA families (Figure 4A).
The total number of snoRNA-encoded genes increased
suddenly in mammals after the divergence from birds.
Also, the expansion of mammalian snoRNAs usually
involved intergenic-encoded snoRNAs, and the principal
contribution to expansion was the production of many
members of such snoRNA families (Figure 4B and 4D).
The number of predicted snoRNA genes in medaka,
zebrafish, frog, and birds is less than 200, but the numbers increased to 2,217 in the platypus, 992 in the
mouse, and 744 in the rhesus monkey genome. As
shown in Figure 4C, compared to Caenorhabditis elegans, in which nearly all snoRNAs exist as single copies

(singletons), 30~60% of vertebrate snoRNA families
have multiple paralogs, demonstrating that large-scale
duplications of particular snoRNA families may have
occurred during vertebrate evolution (Figure 4D).
Among the 58 identified rhesus monkey snoRNA
families with annotated orthologs in human and mouse,
14 are singletons, and the remaining 44 snoRNA
families have 315 paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome (Additional File 7).
The expansion mode of snoRNAs differed among the
species examined. For example, the rhesus monkey,
mouse, and platypus genomes each contain no more
than three copies of SNORAU13, but 439 copies may be
found in the human genome. However, the SNORA17

family has no more than three copies in the rhesus and
human genomes, but 354 members may be found in the
mouse genome.
Duplication mechanisms of rhesus monkey snoRNAs

According to ENSEMBL annotations, eight rhesus monkey snoRNA families are predicted to have more than
ten paralogs. As shown in Table 2, the majority of highcopy snoRNAs are present in the three examined mammalian species, and most are duplicated in a speciesspecific fashion. This suggests that most high-copy
snoRNAs were replicated in recent evolutionary times,

after the speciation of mammals. To explore driving
forces for the high duplication rate of snoRNAs in
mammalian species, we analyzed the flanking sequences
of each paralog within individual snoRNA families to
search for putative transposable elements mediating
snoRNA expansion. We found that the paralogs of
SNORA70 in the rhesus monkey and mouse genomes
shared a ~490 bp consensus sequence in the 3’ flanking
regions (Figure 5). To investigate whether a particular
transposable element (TE) mediated the duplication of
SNORA70 in monkey and mouse genomes, we first
searched for known TEs in the flanking sequences of

Figure 4 snoRNA expansion in vertebrates. The number of snoRNA families (A) and the total number of snoRNA copies (B), based on the
genomic organization, were calculated in each of eight vertebrate species. The number of snoRNA families (C) and all snoRNA individuals (D),

SNORA70 using RepeatMasker [40]. However, no
known transposable element was identified in the flanking sequences. A genomic BLAST search of the consensus sequence did not show a high copy-number in
either the rhesus monkey or mouse genome, suggesting
that a novel TE did not exist in the consensus sequence.
Thus, the duplication of SNORA70 paralogs most likely
occurred via a non-TE mediated mechanism. The
SNORA25 family includes 16 paralogs with apparently
random distribution in the rhesus monkey genome.
Each duplication unit possesses typical SINE-like

retroposon structural features characterized by a poly(A)
end and a target site duplication (TSD) [41]. The 3’flanking sequences of eleven SNORA25 paralogs of the
rhesus monkey are shown in Figure 6A. Interestingly,
six SNORA25 paralogs have multiple poly(A) sequences
(Figure 6A), suggesting that some rhesus monkey
SNORA25 sequences might have undergone several
rounds of duplication, to create the variant paralogs
(Figure 6B).
Two paralogs of rhesus monkey SNORA76 were also
examined. One (designated as SNORA76a) is located in

an intergenic region on chromosome 16, the other
(designated SNORA76b) is located on chromosome 2
within the intron of NF-kappa-B inhibitor-interacting
Ras-like protein 1 (nkiras1). There is one copy of
SNORA76 in the mouse genome. Based on syntenic
region analysis between mouse and rhesus monkey,
SNORA76a is likely to be the parental copy in the rhesus monkey genome. The SNORA76b paralog is probably a novel progeny copy that possibly arose after the
divergence of rodents and primates. This paralog seems
to be rhesus monkey-specific, as SNORA76b is absent
in the syntenic region of the marmoset, orangutan,
chimpanzee, and human. The 3’-flanking sequences of

SNORA76b and SNORA76a share about 1,200 nt, suggesting that SNORA76a was translocated together with
the 3’ flanking sequence, from chromosome 16 to chromosome 2, to create the novel SNORA76b paralog (Figure 7A).
SINE-like expansion was also observed among some
snoRNA families. The flanking sequences of SNORA76b
contain a terminal poly(A), a TSD, and T2A4 derivatives
preferably recognized by the L1 nicking endonuclease,
all of which are features of SINE family transposons.
Therefore, we hypothesize that SNORA76b may be a
SINE-like retrogene generated using the L1 integration
machinery. Figure 7B shows another example of

snoRNA trans-duplication in the rhesus monkey genome. There are six copies of the SNORA24 gene in this
genome. One copy of SNORA24 (SNORA24a) on chromosome 5 is located in the first intron of a gene termed
the human snhg8 homolog (small nucleolar RNA host
gene 8; snhg8). SNORA24b on chromosome 1 possesses
characteristics typical of a SINE-like retrogene (with a
TSD and a polyA structure) and the immediate downstream region of rhesus SNORA24b is composed of
three segments that could be aligned to the 3’ region of

the first intron, and the entire sequences of exon 2 and
exon 3, of the human snhg8 gene, respectively. The
genomic composition of the flanking region of rhesus
monkey SNORA24b is evidence that this snoRNA locus
was generated in an RNA-mediated retro-transposition
event and that the transposed unit originated from a
partially processed hnRNA of snhg8. As a result,

transcript and the polyA end thereof retroposed to a

(Figure 7B). Apart from these two examples, we also
identified another 22 potential rhesus monkey snoRNA
retrogenes (Additional File 8). In summary, our data
suggest that SINE-like retroposon-mediated retroposition might represent a driving force for rhesus monkey
snoRNA expansion.
Analysis of snoRNA host genes

A large proportion of vertebrate snoRNAs are encoded
in the introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding
genes. Although snoRNA host genes with ribosometranslation-related functions were the first to be
reported, some snoRNAs are also hosted by non-

ribosome or non-translation-related genes. Here, we systematically analyzed the functional spectrum of host
genes for all intronic snoRNAs predicted in four representative vertebrates (the data are from ENSEMBL
release 50), including medaka, frog, chicken, and rhesus
monkey. As shown in Figure 8A, more than 80% of
snoRNA host genes in medaka are ribosome-related
protein-coding genes, whereas this percentage decreases
to 30% in the rhesus monkey. Similar patterns were evident in the functional distribution of experimentally
validated snoRNA host genes when the chicken and rhesus monkey were compared (Figure 8B). The data suggests that snoRNA-encoding genes expanded in the

introns of non-ribosomal and non-translational proteincoding genes during vertebrate evolution.
We also searched for gene orthologs hosting snoRNAs
in eight additional species, including C. elegans, fruit fly,
medaka, zebrafish, frog, platypus, mouse, and human.
Interestingly, we found that almost all chicken snoRNAs
and host genes thereof had orthologs in humans and
the rhesus monkey (Figure 8C and Figure 8D), suggesting that birds and primates shared not only snoRNAs
but also the host genes from a common ancestor dating
back more than 310 million years ago. A large proportion (about 80%) of rhesus monkey snoRNA host genes
with ribosome- and translation-related functions have
orthologs in the chicken genome, and the chicken
orthologs are also hosts of snoRNAs (Figure 8E). However, only 37% of the orthologs of non-ribosome and
non-translation-related rhesus monkey snoRNA host
genes carried snoRNAs in the chicken genome (Figure
8F), indicating that the majority of monkey snoRNAs
encoded by introns of non-ribosome-related genes
appeared after the divergence of birds and mammals.

Discussion
Recent studies have demonstrated that the functions of
non-protein-coding RNAs may encompass almost every
aspect of biological activity in normal development and
disease biogenesis [21,25,42-45]. Rhesus macaques are a
suitable primate model for basic and applied biomedical
research [38,39]. However, in contrast to the considerable literature on human and mouse ncRNAs, rhesus
monkey ncRNAs have not previously been systematically
characterized. Here, we performed a detailed screening
of the rhesus monkey intermediate-size ncRNA transcriptome and cloned 117 rhesus monkey ncRNAs,
including 80 snoRNAs, eight unclassified ncRNAs, and
29 known RNAs (snRNAs, Y RNA, and others). By comparative genomics analysis, we found several lineage- or
species-specific snoRNAs. Genomic organization analysis
showed that the majority of rhesus monkey snoRNAs
have many paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome. By
flanking sequence analysis, we found that SINE-like retroposon-mediated trans-duplication may have been an
important mechanism in expansion of novel snoRNAs
in the rhesus monkey genome.
Among the 117 identified rhesus monkey ncRNAs,
eight unclassified ncRNA candidates could not be
assigned to any known class of ncRNA. These eight
unclassified ncRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in the
six rhesus monkey tissues tested. Recently, we also identified nine unclassified ncRNAs from the chicken [46].
Previous reports also showed that some ncRNAs
obtained from cDNA library sequencing did not belong
to any known ncRNA family, and these ncRNAs were
designated as unclassified or unknown [13,31,47].

Page 14 of 19

Hüttenhofer and coworkers found 57 such unclassified
ncRNAs, of length 50~500 nt, in mouse brain cDNA
libraries [13]. Deng et al. reported 14 unclassified
ncRNAs of length 70~200 nt in a C. elegans cDNA
library [31]. Yuan identified 29 unclassified ncRNAs by
constructing cDNA libraries from four developmental
stages of Drosophila melanogaster [48]. These unclassified ncRNAs often show little sequence conservation
and are less prevalent compared to known snoRNAs.
However, these observations do not mean that the
unclassified ncRNAs are non-functional [13,31,48]. The
increasing number of newly identified unclassified
ncRNAs suggests that other types/classes of ncRNA of
intermediate size (50~500 nt) remain to be identified,
and novel ncRNA families will likely be susceptible to
classification using enhanced bioinformatic comparisons
and extensive functional studies of the roles played by
such ncRNAs.
Previous reports showed that the majority of known
snoRNAs were conserved between human and mouse,
at a level of 80~90% [49]. Most rhesus monkey snoRNAs identified in the present study show high homology
to those of the human and mouse. However, 13 snoRNAs had a conservation score below 0.6 (Table 1), suggesting that some snoRNAs are less conserved between
primates and rodents. Using comparative genomics analysis, we found several lineage- or species-specific snoRNAs. Fifteen snoRNA families were ancient, being
present at an early stage of vertebrate evolution, whereas
11 snoRNA families appeared after the divergence of
birds and mammals. Fourteen young snoRNA families
arose during mammalian evolution and one of these
(SNORA15) developed only after primates had arisen.
Our findings are in line with recent studies in other species. Previously, we found 30 chicken/bird-specific
ncRNAs [46], and Schmitz reported 49 platypus-specific
snoRNAs [35]. Computer analysis of human genomic
tiling array data revealed 300 putative candidates for
classification as primate-specific ncRNAs [50]. Together
with previous reports, our data show that ncRNAs may
play important roles in lineage development, or speciation, during evolution.
Although homologs of some rhesus monkey snoRNAs
could be found in the mouse and human genomes, the
expression of several snoRNAs was not detectable by
northern blotting, suggesting that some snoRNA homologs might be pseudogenes without transcriptional
potential in the human and/or mouse. Thus, we found
only 14 potential primate-specific and eight rhesus monkey (or non-human primate)-specific transcripts (Table
1 and Figure 2). However, it remains possible that undetectable expression in the human or mouse might be
attributable to transcriptional regulation by spatio-temporal, physiological, or pathological stimuli/stresses that

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/61

were not present under the normal conditions prevalent
when our tissue samples were taken. In support of this
hypothesis, several examples of tissue-specific expression
of ncRNAs have been reported in previous studies
describing brain-specific snoRNAs or snoRNAs involved
in neuronal development [51]. By analogy, some microRNAs and piRNAs display specific spatio-temporal
expression patterns, and play functional roles in cell differentiation and organogenesis during development
[11,12,52,53]. In the present study, we also found that
SNORA71, ubiquitously expressed in human and rhesus
monkey tissues, is predominantly expressed in the brain
of mouse.
In vertebrates, most snoRNAs are located within
introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding genes
[21,54]. Some snoRNAs are present as several copies,
either in different introns of the same gene or within
introns of different genes [32,55]. Genomic organization
analysis showed that the majority of the rhesus monkey
snoRNAs identified in this study have multiple paralogs
in the rhesus genome, suggesting redundancy arising
from duplication, including transposition. Diverse molecular mechanisms may be involved in the creation of
protein-coding genes, such as gene duplication and retroposition [56]. To investigate the mechanisms of rhesus
monkey snoRNA expansion, we analyzed the flanking
sequences of each snoRNA paralog and found that these
sequences adjacent to some rhesus monkey snoRNAs
have a typical SINE-like retroposon characterized by a
poly(A) end and TSDs, suggesting that some rhesus
monkey snoRNA paralogs are retrogenes formed by
autonomous retroposon-mediated retroposition. In addition, the 5’ flanking sequences of rhesus monkey
SNORA76b and SNORA24b possess T2A4 motifs,
which are preferentially recognized by the L1 retroposon-encoded nicking endonuclease, suggesting that
SNORA76b and SNORA24b were generated from a parental copy by L1 integration machinery-mediated retroposition. Significantly, we found that six paralogs of
SNORA25 also possess typical SINE-like retroposon
characteristics, and contain multiple poly(A) sequences,
indicating that SNORA25 underwent multiple duplication events during evolution. Thus, we propose a model
involving retroposition for SNORA25 duplication.
Recently, the mechanisms of snoRNA gene expansion in
other species have been reported. In nematodes, some
snoRNA paralogs were generated by cis- or trans-duplication [23]. Other data suggest that mammalian
snoRNA genes are SINE-like retroposons (snoRTs/
snoRTEs), and that retroposition mediated by snoRTs
may have played an important role in snoRNA expansion during evolution of the mammalian genome
[33-35]. The extensive expansion of snoRNA-encoding
genes during mammalian evolution might ensure the

presence of a functional copy when a parental gene
loses function because of mutation. On the other hand,
novel paralogs could independently evolve to generate
isoforms with different targets/functions, for example
the acquisition of new sites complementary to modification regions of rRNAs [34].

Conclusions
In the present study, we provide the first experimentally-derived catalog of rhesus monkey ncRNAs. Small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) comprise one of the largest
groups of functionally diverse ncRNAs currently known
to exist in eukaryotic cells. By performing northern blotting and comparative genomic analysis on rhesus monkey snoRNAs, we determined several features of
interest. First, we identified several lineage- or speciesspecific snoRNAs. Moreover, we observed that the
majority of snoRNAs have multiple paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome. Based on the data from the
ENSEMBL genome annotation project, the total number
of snoRNA-encoding genes was shown to have increased
during vertebrate evolution. Our results demonstrate
that SINE-like retroposon-mediated trans-duplication
may have been a driving force for the expansion of
novel snoRNAs in the rhesus monkey genome.
Methods
Animals and Ethics statement

Two year-old rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were
used in this study. For tissue sampling, monkeys were
anesthetized with ketamine (25 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and killed; tissues were removed, cut into
blocks, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for
RNA isolation. Murine tissues were collected from sixmonth-old C57BL/6 mice. All experimental procedures
were conducted in accordance with the protocols of the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking
Union Medical College. Chicken tissues were collected
from four week-old meat-type broilers (bred by a commercial company, Arbor Acres), in accordance with the
policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee of
China Agricultural University. Total RNA from human
tissues was purchased from Shang Hai Haoran Biological Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China.
Construction of rhesus monkey libraries enriched in
ncRNAcDNA

Total RNA was isolated from mixed heart and skeletal
muscle tissue of rhesus macaques. Full-length ncRNAspecific libraries of both capped and uncapped transcripts were generated according to a previously
described method [31], with modifications. Total RNA
was fractionated on Qiagen-tips with 0.6~1.0 M NaCl

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/61

gradient elution employing QRW2 buffer (the protocol
was taken from the Qiagen RNA/DNA handbook).
Highly abundant rRNAs (5.8S rRNAs and 5S rRNAs)
and snRNAs (U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, and
U5 snRNA) were removed from the small RNA fraction
(50~500 nt) employing an Ambion MicrobExpress kit.
The remaining RNAs were dephosphorylated with calf
intestine alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) and ligated to
a 3’ adaptor with T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas). After
removal of excess 3’ adaptor, the ligation products were
split into two aliquots, of which one was treated with
PolyNucleotide Kinase (PNK, Fermentas) to phosphorylate non-capped RNA, and the other was incubated with
Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP, Epicentre) to
remove 5’-end methyl-guanosine caps from capped
RNA. Thereafter, both samples were ligated to the 5’
adaptor and reverse transcribed with Thermoscript
reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) using oligo 3RT
as the RT primer. cDNA was amplified by PCR over 13
cycles using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) with the 3RT
and 5AD primers, cloned into the vector pGEM-T, (Promega), and sequenced. All primer sequences used in this
study are shown in Additional File 9.
Northern blot hybridization

Total RNA extracted from six rhesus monkey tissues
(heart, liver, brain, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle),
and skeletal muscle from human, mouse, and chicken,
were separated by 8% (w/v) PAGE (with 7M urea) and
transferred to nylon membranes (N+, Amersham). Probes
detecting specific ncRNAs were labelled with digoxigenin
(DIG)-11-UTP by in vitro transcription using T7 and SP6
RNA polymerase. The RNA blots were hybridized in
ULTRAhyb (Ambion) at 68°C overnight, washed with 2 ×
SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS washing buffer at 68°C for 2 × 5 min,
followed by stringent washing with 0.1 × SSC/0.1% (w/v)
SDS buffer at 68°C for 2 × 30 min. Thereafter, RNA blots
were blocked with blocking buffer for 30~60 min at room
temperature and incubated for 30 min with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase (AP) antibody (1:10,000, diluted in blocking buffer). Hybridization signals were detected using the
CDP-star reagent (Roche). Chemiluminescent signals were
detected on X-ray film.
Rhesus monkey ncRNA annotation

A total of 4,844 clones were sequenced from the rhesus
monkey ncRNA libraries. The Staden package was used
to trim vector and adaptor sequences, employing default
parameters, and we obtained 4,059 insert sequences for
further analysis. After removing redundant sequences,
the remaining 2,164 unique sequences were annotated
according to their degree of similarity to data in the
NCBI nt database (2008-06 release), Rfam ncRNA
sequences (8.1), ENSEMBL rhesus monkey ncRNAs and

Page 16 of 19

cDNA sequences (release 49), and NCBI rhesus monkey
Refseq mRNAs (release 2008-05), using BLASTN (version 2.2.17). We filtered the alignments and retained
only those with plus/plus strand matches and e-values
above 1e-20. Sequence annotations from these alignments were combined in the priority: Rfam ncRNAs,
NCBI nt sequences, ENSEMBL ncRNAs, NCBI refseq
mRNAs, and ENSEMBL cDNA sequences. Structural
alignment with known snoRNAs was performed using
INFERNAL software [57]. SnoReport software [58] was
utilized to recognize two major classes of snoRNAs (H/
ACA box- and C/D box-containing snoRNAs).
Target prediction of rhesus monkey snoRNAs

We downloaded sequences and annotations of rhesus
tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs from the
GtRNAdb and ENSEMBL databases [6,59]. The guide
sequences of C/D box snoRNA were defined by the
region sandwiched by the C(C’) box and D(D’) box.
Alignment between snoRNAs and the above mentioned
RNA sequences was achieved using a modified BLASTN
program. For each guide sequence of C/D box snoRNA,
we selected one best-aligned target. The secondary
structure of H/ACA box snoRNA was predicted using
Mfold software [60]. The guide sequences of H/ACA
box snoRNA were identified as sequences within the
internal loop of one (or both) snoRNA hairpin structures. We predicted target RNAs for H/ACA box snoRNAs by the following criteria. First, the target RNA
should share at least seven nucleotides complementary
in sequence to the flanking sequences of the junction
sites between the stem and loop of the snoRNA guide
sequence, and, second, the predicted pseudouridine site
in the target RNA that paired to the 5’ nucleotides of
juncture sites in guide sequences should be a uridine.
Comparative genomic analysis of rhesus monkey
snoRNAs

Genomic sequences of all examined species were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser [61], together
with the genome annotations of ENSEMBL release 50
[6]. The sequences, annotations, and genomic loci of
vertebrate snoRNAs were originally predicted by INFERNAL software [57], supported by the Rfam database [7],
and were next integrated into ENSEMBL [6]. Conservation of rhesus monkey snoRNAs in human, mouse, and
chicken genomes was examined using BLAST. Conservation scores were calculated based on the maximal
alignment length and the identity of BLAST hits in each
genome. Multi-alignment patterns for snoRNA sequence
comparison among different primates were extracted
from UCSC Hg18 alignment data after rhesus monkey
snoRNA locations were converted to human genome
positions employing the UCSC liftOver software. The

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:61

genomic context, and annotations of protein-coding
genes and their orthologs in other species, were downloaded using BioMart, employing the ENSEMBL genome annotation version described above [62].
RepeatMasker [40] and CENSER [63] were used to
search for simple repeats and transposons with known
sequences. To locate low copy-number snoRNAs, we
wrote PERL scripts to search for 5~50 bp repeats in the
flanking sequences of rhesus monkey snoRNAs. To find
interspersed high copy-number snoRNAs, we used ClustalW [64] and MEGA [65] software to search for consensus sequences in flanking regions within a 10 kb
window of the gene of interest.
