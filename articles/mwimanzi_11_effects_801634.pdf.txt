cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition and Nef’s
functionality in primary macrophages

Abstract
Background: Although HIV can infect several cellular subsets, such as CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages, it
remains unclear whether an HIV infection in macrophages supports cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape. Here, we
tested two naturally-arising mutations located in the well-conserved polyproline region of Nef for their effects on
CTL recognition, Nef’s functionality, and viral replication capacity in macrophages. These mutations were selected
because they are known to cause CTL escape in the context of T lymphocytes.
Findings: Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with the wild-type virus, but not with variant viruses,
were efficiently killed by CTL clones targeting Nef epitopes, VY8 (VPLRPMTY) and RY11 (RPQVPLRPMTY). The CTLescape mutation, Arg75Thr, or Arg75Thr/Tyr85Phe double mutation, reduced the HLA class I down-regulation activity
and, interestingly, increased the susceptibility of virus-infected MDMs to recognition by CTLs targeting a different
epitope. The same mutations reduced the CCR5, but not CD4, down-regulation activity. Moreover, the Nef variants
were impaired for Hck activation and enhancement of viral replication in MDMs.
Conclusions: These results suggest that HIV-infected MDMs are killed by CTLs targeting Nef epitopes, contributing
to selection and adaptation of CTL-escape viral variants.

Findings
Several different cellular subsets such as CD4+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells can be targets for an HIV infection; although they differentially
support HIV replication and persistence in vivo [1-3].
Macrophages may be the early target of HIV, but are
highly resistant to the cytopathic effects of an HIV
infection and continuously produce infectious virions
for a long period of time [4,5]. It is thought that the differences in fitness of viral replication among the different cellular environments could influence the selection
and adaptation of viral quasispecies in these cells. The
HLA class I-restricted CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL) response is thought to play an important role in
controlling HIV replication [6-8] and to mediate a
major selective force for the emergence of viral variants
[9,10]. Certain CTL escape mutations, in well-conserved
regions of Gag and Nef, have been reported to impose

functional constraints on these proteins and to modulate
viral replication in the context of T lymphocytes [11-13].
However, in the context of macrophages, the selection
of CTL escape variants and functional adaptation of
viral proteins are not yet fully understood. We previously showed that the HLA-B35-restricted CTL
responses toward a well-conserved proline-rich region
in Nef results in the emergence of a CTL escape mutation, either Arg75Thr or Tyr85Phe, from phylogenetically different viral quasispecies even within an HIVinfected host [13]. These mutations constrain some of
the important Nef functions in CD4+ T cells [13]. Here
we tested whether an HIV-1 infection in macrophages
would have any influence on CTL recognition and
escape as well as Nef’s functionality and adaptation in
the infected macrophages.
Susceptibility of HIV-infected macrophages to recognition
by the cognate CTLs

We previously reported that in HIV-infected patients
with HLA-B35, the Nef protein elicits dominant CD8 T

cell responses [14], with the short epitope VY8 (Nef78-85;
VPLRPMTY) being the early epitope, which subsequently shifts to the amino terminal-extended longer
epitope RY11 (Nef75-85; RPQVPLRPMTY) [13]. Autologous virus sequence analysis revealed that the mutations
Tyr85 to Phe (85F) and Arg75 to Thr (75T) are associated with the early and chronic phase of an HIV infection, respectively, in HIV-infected individuals with HLAB35 but that these 85F and 75T mutations are derived
from phylogenetically different lineages [13].
We first examined CTL activity toward macrophages
infected with HIV-1 strain JRFL, in which nef gene had
been replaced with that of strain SF2 (referred as JRFLSF2nef) and its variants. In this JRFL-SF2nef, we had
created unique restriction sites, Cla I and Not I adjacent
to the ends of the nef open reading frame [15] and confirmed that the resultant viruses, prepared by transfecting 293 T cells with JRFL and JRFL-SF2nef, had
comparable replication capacity in primary monocytederived macrophages (MDMs) (data not shown). To
prepare mature MDMs, CD14+ cells were isolated from
PBMCs of HIV-negative donors, in accordance with the
human experimentation guidelines of Kumamoto University, and cultured for 7 days in the presence of 100
ng/ml of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Peprotech GmbH, Germany). Previously established CTLs,
specific for VY8 and RY11, [13,14] were highly cytotoxic
toward MDMs infected with wild-type (wt) HIV-1, suggesting that HIV-infected MDMs were a preferable target for CTLs. The VY8-specific CTLs showed higher
cytotoxicity toward wt virus-infected MDMs than did
the RY11-specific CTLs (Figure 1), in good agreement
with the observation obtained with HIV-infected CD4+
T cells [13,16]. In contrast, VY8- and RY11-specific
CTLs failed to kill primary MDMs infected with 85F
and 75T viruses, respectively (Figure 1), indicating that
the 85F and 75T single mutations conferred escape
from CTLs specific for VY8 and RY11, respectively, but
not simultaneously. In contrast, the TF virus could
escape from both types of CTLs (Figure 1). It should be
noted that Western blot analysis of Nef proteins in
virus-producing cells showed a comparable level of Nef
expression among wt and all variant viruses except for
ΔNef (data not shown).
Effects of the Nef mutations on Hck activation

Nef is known to associate via its PxxP motif with the
SH3 domain of several different cellular kinases including Hck [17,18]. We tested whether the CTL-escape variants in the PxxP region would affect the Hck activation
by Nef by using the in vitro Hck activation assay as
described earlier [19] (Figure 2A). Expectedly, the wildtype Nef showed robust Hck activation; whereas the
AxxA variant Nef (Pro76Ala and Pro79Ala) did not

Page 2 of 7

show substantial activation (Figure 2B). The 85F variant
Nef did not affect Hck activation, whereas the Hck activation was substantially reduced by the 75T and TF variants of Nef (Figure 2B). These results suggest that
CTL-escape variants in the PxxP motif affect Hck activation in macrophages.
Effects of the Nef mutations on HLA class I downregulation

Because Nef helps HIV-infected cells to evade CTL lysis
by down-modulating cell-surface HLA-I and the PxxP
motif is critical for this activity [13,20,21], we examined
the HLA-I down-regulation activity by Nef in MDMs
infected with wt and variant viruses by flow cytometry
(Figure 3A). The surface levels of HLA-I within p24+
subsets in wt virus-infected MDMs were much reduced
compared with those in uninfected cells (Figure 3B) and
that no HLA-I down-regulation was observed in ΔNef
virus-infected MDMs (Figure 3B). In contrast, both the
75T and the TF variant viruses showed substantially
diminished down-regulation activity; whereas the 85F
variant virus showed down-regulation activity comparable to that of the wt (Figure 3B).
Susceptibility of HIV-infected MDMs to recognition by
CTLs of another specificity

We postulated that the impaired Nef-mediated downregulation activity of HLA-I in MDMs could influence
the susceptibility to killing of HIV-infected MDMs by
CTLs. To test this, we first created the variant virus having M20A or P82A (numbering based on the SF2 strain)
because these mutations have been shown to completely
disrupt the Nef-mediated HLA-I down-regulation activity [22,23]. We then assessed the cytolytic activity of
CTL clones specific for another Nef epitope presented
by HLA-A24 (Nef 138-147 : RYPLTFGWCF) toward
MDMs infected with wt, M20A, or P82A viruses.
Although the amino-acid sequences in the epitope
region of A24-Nef were the same among the wt and
these variant viruses tested, the CTL-mediated killing
activity toward MDMs infected with M20A and P82A
variant viruses was much increased compared to those
infected with the wt virus (Figure 4).
Next, we also determined CTL cytotoxic activity toward
MDMs infected with 75T, 85F, and TF variant viruses. The
A24-Nef CTLs showed the most potent activity toward
MDMs infected with either the 75T or TF variant viruses;
whereas their cytotoxic activity was less potent toward
MDMs infected with either the wt or the 85F mutant virus
(Figure 4). These data suggest that the diminished HLA-I
down-regulation (i.e., increased level of cell-surface HLA-I)
in MDMs infected with the 75T and the TF mutant viruses
(Figure 3) resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by
CTLs of another specificity (Figure 4), leading to a possible

were then mixed with CTL clones at various effector-to-target cell ratios (E/T) for 6 hr at 37°C after having been labeled with 51Cr. The frequency

shown. (B) Quantification of Hck activation by Nef. The indicated
values represent the Hck activation activity after the level of

100%. Data represent the means ± SD of 3 independent
experiments, and statistical analysis was performed based on
ANOVA with multiple comparisons vs. wt (Bonferroni t-test). n.s., not
significant.

We also examined whether Nef’s down-regulation activity of viral receptors, i.e., CD4 and CCR5, could be
influenced by the mutations in HIV-infected MDMs
(Figure 5A). The cell-surface expression of CCR5 was
substantially reduced in wt virus-infected MDMs but
not affected in the ΔNef variant virus-infected ones (Figure 5B). Interestingly, the 85F variant virus showed
CCR5 down-regulation activity comparable to that of
the wt virus; whereas the 75T and TF variant were substantially impaired in this activity in MDMs (Figure 5B).
In contrast, CD4 down-regulation activity was not
affected for all of the viruses with mutated Nefs except
for ΔNef (Figure 5C), consistent with the observation
that CD4 down-regulation activity is mediated by a specific region in Nef other than the PxxP motif [21].
Effects of the Nef mutations on viral replication

We finally examined whether the mutations would differently affect the enhancement of viral replication in
MDMs. In MDMs from 2 HIV-negative donors, the wt
HIV-1 showed the highest replication among the various
viruses tested; whereas the ΔNef variant showed much
decreased replication (Figure 6A), consistent with the

previous observation [24]. The replication of the 85F variant virus was partially impaired in MDMs from one of
the donors and was comparable to that of the wt virus in
MDMs from the other donor (Figure 6A). In contrast,
the replication of the 75T and TF variant viruses was
impaired in MDMs from both donors (Figure 6A). To
account for this donor variability, we summarized the
results from a total of 5 donors in Figure 6B. Because the
peak of the virus replication was between 6 to 12 days
after infection, depending on the donor and the virus, the
peak p24 Ag values of each of the viruses are presented
and were used for statistical analysis (Figure 6B). The
75T and the TF variant viruses showed significantly
diminished capacity for viral replication compared with
the wt; whereas the 85F virus did not show much difference in replication capacity (Figure 6B).

Discussion and Conclusions
Although the Nef protein is thought to have very
high mutational plasticity, we showed here that the
naturally-arising CTL escape variants in the wellconserved PxxP region in Nef alone or in combination
can modulate some pathogenic functions of Nef in the

context of human primary macrophages infected with a
CCR5-tropic virus. There are 2 different aspects of CTLmediated functional constraints on the PxxP-dependent
Nef activities in MDMs reported here, one through
immune evasion activity (HLA-I down-regulation activity)
and the other acting on the intrinsic capacity to boost viral
replication and persistence (Hck activation, viral co-receptor down-regulation activity, and enhancement of viral
replication). In particular, one of the single mutants, 75T,
impaired these Nef activities in MDMs infected with a
CCR5-tropic virus. This is in line with the previous report
showing that 75T mutation modulated Nef-stimulated
viral replication in immature dendritic cell/T cell cocultures infected with a CCR5-tropic virus [25] although this
mutation alone had virtually no influence on the same Nef
activities in primary CD4+ T cells infected with a CXCR4tropic virus in the previous study [13]. In addition, the
75T mutation, located outside the VY8 epitope, reduced
the cytolytic activity of VY8-specific CTLs in the context
of CD4 + T cells [13], but did not affect their cytolytic
activity in the context of MDMs (Figure 1), suggesting the
differential intracellular processing of the VY8 peptide
between CD4+ T cells and MDMs. This observation is in
line with the previous report showing a substantial difference in intracellular processing of antigenic HIV peptides
between monocytes and lymphocytes [26]. Overall, these
results suggest that an antigenic variation of viruses can
differentially influence viral replication and persistence
between cellular subsets because of their different effects
on the intracellular antigen-processing machinery, the susceptibility to CTL killing, as well as the fitness cost to viral
replication.
Of particular interest are the data showing that the
CTL-escape Nef mutation, 75T, impaired HLA-I downregulation activity by Nef and rendered the HIV-infected
MDMs more susceptible to killing by CTLs with
another specificity. Such phenomenon was also observed
in the context of CD4 + T cells in our previous study
[13]. However, wt-virus-infected cells, regardless of CD4
+
T cells or MDMs, could be killed to some extent by
CTLs, suggesting that the Nef-mediated HLA-I downregulation is insufficient for HIV to escape from CTL
recognition and that, CTL-escape variant viruses are
selected and emerged. Conversely, Swigut et al., [27]
reported that monkeys infected with SIV containing nef
mutations that selectively eliminated MHC down-regulation activity exhibited higher level of SIV-specific CD8 T
cell responses. In any event, an important question
remains to be addressed which is how significant is Nefmediated HLA-I down-regulation activity for HIV replication and persistence in HIV-infected humans.
Although HLA-B*35-restricted CTLs targeting PxxP
region of Nef can impose functional constraints in viral
replication in this study, we did not find any beneficial

effects on clinical parameters (such as CD4 count and
viral load) in HIV-infected patients with HLA-B*35 as
well as those with HLA-B*35 and HLA-A*24 in our
cohort to date (data not shown). Functional impairment
in Nef induced by CTL-escape variants could be compensated later by mutations at secondary sites in Nef.
For example, an inverse dose-response relationship has
been observed between the number of CTL-escape
mutations in Nef and CD4 counts in patients in a large
population study [28]. Therefore, only some CTL-escape
variants may play a role in modulating Nef functions in
vivo, such as in the case of HLA-B57+ elite suppressors
[29]. Further studies using a large number of clinicallyisolated nef alleles are needed to extend this observation,
such as how Nef-specific CTL responses, Nef functions,
and clinical outcome of HIV-infected individuals are
related to each other at the population level.
