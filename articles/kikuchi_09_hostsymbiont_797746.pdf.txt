Abstract
Background: Host-symbiont co-speciation and reductive genome evolution have been commonly
observed among obligate endocellular insect symbionts, while such examples have rarely been identified
among extracellular ones, the only case reported being from gut symbiotic bacteria of stinkbugs of the
family Plataspidae. Considering that gut symbiotic communities are vulnerable to invasion of foreign
microbes, gut symbiotic associations have been thought to be evolutionarily not stable. Stinkbugs of the
family Acanthosomatidae harbor a bacterial symbiont in the midgut crypts, the lumen of which is
completely sealed off from the midgut main tract, thereby retaining the symbiont in the isolated cryptic
cavities. We investigated histological, ecological, phylogenetic, and genomic aspects of the unique gut
symbiosis of the acanthosomatid stinkbugs.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses showed that the acanthosomatid symbionts constitute a distinct clade in
the -Proteobacteria, whose sister groups are the obligate endocellular symbionts of aphids Buchnera and
the obligate gut symbionts of plataspid stinkbugs Ishikawaella. In addition to the midgut crypts, the
symbionts were located in a pair of peculiar lubricating organs associated with the female ovipositor, by
which the symbionts are vertically transmitted via egg surface contamination. The symbionts were
detected not from ovaries but from deposited eggs, and surface sterilization of eggs resulted in symbiontfree hatchlings. The symbiont-free insects suffered retarded growth, high mortality, and abnormal
morphology, suggesting important biological roles of the symbiont for the host insects. The symbiont
phylogeny was generally concordant with the host phylogeny, indicating host-symbiont co-speciation over
evolutionary time despite the extracellular association. Meanwhile, some local host-symbiont phylogenetic
discrepancies were found, suggesting occasional horizontal symbiont transfers across the host lineages.
The symbionts exhibited AT-biased nucleotide composition, accelerated molecular evolution, and reduced
genome size, as has been observed in obligate endocellular insect symbionts.
Conclusion: Comprehensive studies of the acanthosomatid bacterial symbiosis provide new insights into
the genomic evolution of extracellular symbiotic bacteria: host-symbiont co-speciation and drastic genome
reduction can occur not only in endocellular symbiotic associations but also in extracellular ones. We
suggest that many more such cases might be discovered in future surveys.

Background
Insects represent the majority of the biodiversity on the
earth described, being the most prosperous animal group
in the terrestrial ecosystem [1]. One of the key traits considered to make insects so prosperous is their symbiotic
association with microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms are universally found in the gut, body cavity, or cells
of a wide array of insects. Some symbionts are obligate
associates for their hosts and significantly contribute to
the host fitness, other symbionts are facultative companions of their hosts and tend to negatively affect the host
fitness, and the majority of the others are of unknown
nature and are recognized only by means of microscopy,
PCR detection, and/or DNA sequences. Whether their
effects are beneficial, detrimental, or nearly neutral, many
of these symbionts substantially affect the physiology,
ecology, reproduction, and behavior of their hosts in a
variety of ways [2-5].
Among them, the most intimate mutualistic associations
are found in obligate endocellular symbionts like Buchnera in aphids and Wigglesworthia in tsetse flies. In these
insects, the symbiotic bacteria are housed in the specialized cells called bacteriocytes or mycetocytes, where the
inhabiting symbionts play their physiological roles such
as provisioning of essential nutrients for the host insects
[6-8]. The symbionts are vertically transmitted to the next
host generation in the maternal body at early stages of
oogenesis or embryogenesis, wherein the symbiont transmission is integrated into the intricate developmental
process of the host insects [2,9]. The symbiont phylogeny
usually mirrors the host phylogeny, suggesting host-symbiont co-speciation over evolutionary time [10,11]. In
these obligate endocellular bacterial symbionts, remarkable evolutionary patterns, including AT-biased nucleotide
composition, accelerated molecular evolution, and
reduced genome size, are generally observed in comparison with their free-living relatives. On the basis of these
evolutionary patterns, it has been argued that the endocellular lifestyle of the obligate insect symbionts might have
strongly affected their genomic evolution [12,13].
On the other hand, symbiotic microorganisms are harbored in the gut cavity of many insects. While most of the
gut microbes are commensals or parasites, some of them
are known to play substantial biological roles for their
hosts. A famous example is wood-eating termites (Isoptera), wherein a rich microbial community of cellulosedegrading bacteria and protozoa in the hindgut is essential for food digestion by the insects [14,15]. Although less
known, many plant-sucking stinkbugs (Heteroptera) are
also dependent on their gut symbiotic bacteria. In these
insects, the terminal region of the midgut is characterized
by the presence of many sacs or tubular outgrowths, called
crypts or caeca, whose lumen is filled with specific symbi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

otic bacteria. When experimentally deprived of the microbial associates, the host insects suffer retarded growth,
mortality and/or sterility [16-21]. Certainly these gut symbionts are vertically transmitted by superficial bacterial
contamination of eggs (egg smearing) or probing parental
bacteria-containing excrement (coprophagy) [2,17,18,21,
22] and important for their host insects, but researchers
have conventionally thought that such extracellular associations are more casual than the endocellular associations, on the grounds that the symbionts are not isolated
in the body cavity and thus vulnerable to invasion and
replacement by foreign microbes [2,20,23].
However, the conventional view was countered by a
recent study on stinkbugs of the family Plataspidae. These
insects, which harbor a -proteobacterial symbiont named
Ishikawaella capsulata in their midgut crypts, had been
known for their unique mechanism for vertical transmission, so-called 'capsule transmission' [24,25], wherein
mother insects deposit symbiont-filled particles (symbiont capsules) in association with eggs, and hatchlings
probe the content of the capsules to acquire the symbiont.
In the plataspid symbiosis, strict host-symbiont co-cladogenesis and reductive symbiont genome evolution were
identified despite the extracellular association [19]. Now
it is of evolutionary interest whether similar cases are to be
found in other insect-microbe extracellular symbioses or
the case of plataspid stinkbugs is an orphan exception.
Here we report a novel group of insect gut bacteria that
exhibit host-symbiont co-cladogenesis and reductive
genome evolution. The host insects are stinkbugs of the
family Acanthosomatidae, which are known for their
social behavior such as maternal guarding of eggs and
nymphs against predators [26,27]. Rosenkranz [28]
described unique histological structures called 'isolated
midgut crypts' and 'lubricating organs' for harboring symbiotic bacteria in these insects. In most plant-sucking
stinkbugs, the lumen of the midgut crypts is connected to
the midgut main tract, and thus the insects are able to
excrete the symbiotic bacteria from the anus for vertical
transmission to their eggs by surface contamination
[2,18,29]. In acathosomatid stinkbugs, by contrast, the
lumen of the crypts is completely sealed off, thereby
retaining the symbiotic bacteria in the isolated cryptic cavities. The female ovipositor is equipped with a pair of
peculiar lubrication organs of unknown developmental
origin, which consist of numerous bacteria-filled tubulets.
These highly-developed symbiotic organs suggest intimacy of the host-symbiont relationship, but there have
been no studies on the acanthosomatid gut symbionts
except for the early histological description by Rosenkranz
[28].

In this study, we performed comprehensive microbiological characterization of the gut symbiotic bacteria associated with 14 species of acanthosomatid stinkbugs, which
unveiled remarkable aspects of their genetic, genomic,
and evolutionary features.

Results
General observation of midgut crypts
In all of the 14 acanthosomatid species listed in Additional file 1, well-developed crypts were found in the
fourth section of the midgut (Elasmostethus humeralis and
its midgut are shown in Figure 1A–C). The midgut crypts
were white in color and arranged in two rows, fused into
two-dimensional assemblages and forming a butterflyshaped organ. When the organs of E. humeralis, Elasmucha
signoreti, Sastragala esakii, and Acanthosoma giganteum were
subjected to sectioning microscopy, no connection was
found between the crypt lumen and the midgut main tract
(a section image of the midgut crypt of E. humeralis is
shown in Figure 1D).
Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from midgut crypts
From 14 acanthosomatid species representing 18 populations (Additional file 1), the crypt-bearing midgut was dissected and subjected to DNA extraction. From the 18 DNA
samples, a 1.5 kb segment of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was
amplified by PCR and cloned, and 10 or more clones for
each of the samples were subjected to RFLP genotyping.
Almost all of the clones derived from a single insect exhibited identical restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) patterns, except for one clone from E. signoreti and
one from Acanthosoma labiduroides.

Three or more clones for each of the 18 samples were
sequenced. All of the sequences derived not only from a
single insect but also from the same species were completely identical to each other. The sequences from 14
acanthosomatid species showed high sequence similarities ranging from 95.4% to 99.7% to each other. DNA
database searches with these sequences identified over
90% similarities to 16S rRNA gene sequences of -proteobacterial representatives. The exceptional clones identified by RFLP genotyping from E. signoreti and A.
labiduroides were also sequenced, which showed the highest similarities to 16S rRNA gene sequences of Wolbachia
sp. (supergroup B; M84686; 99.6%) and Spiroplasma citri
(X63781; 98.1%), respectively.
In situ hybridization of midgut crypts targeting the
bacterial 16S rRNA
To confirm whether the obtained 16S rRNA gene
sequences were definitely derived from the gut symbiotic
bacteria of the acanthosomatid stinkbugs, we performed
16S rRNA-targeted in situ hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. In E. humeralis, in situ hybridization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

with the specific probes Cy5-EhSym16S and TNKM16SA555 detected dense signals in the content of the midgut
crypts (Figure 1E). Such signals were observed neither in
the midgut main tract nor in the tissue connecting the
crypts to the main tract. In Elasmostethus nubilus, S. esakii,
E. signoreti, and Acanthosoma denticaudum, in situ hybridization with the group-specific probe Cy5-AcSym16S also
detected the symbiont signals specifically in the cavity of
the midgut crypts in the same manner (data not shown).
A series of control experiments confirmed the specificity
of the hybridization signals (data not shown).
Electron microscopy of midgut crypts
Ultrathin sections of the midgut crypts from E. humeralis
and E. nubilus were observed by electron microscopy. In
both the species, the lumen of the crypts was full of symbiotic bacteria (Figure 2A and 2B). The rod-shaped bacterial cells, whose cell wall looked very thin, were larger in
E. humeralis than in E. nubilus (Figure 2C and 2D). The
cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the midgut crypt contained a nucleus and many mitochondria but no bacterial
cells (Figure 2A and 2B).
Phylogenetic analysis of symbiotic bacteria based on 16S
rRNA gene
The 16S rRNA gene sequences originating from the gut
symbionts of the acanthosomatid stinkbugs, representing
18 populations, 14 species, and 5 genera, were subjected
to molecular phylogenetic analyses together with 16S
rRNA gene sequences of -proteobacterial representatives.
The acanthosomatid symbionts formed a monophyletic
group with high supporting values (100% in Bayesian,
100% in maximum parsimony (MP), and 95% in maximum likelihood (ML), respectively). The phylogenetic
relationship of the symbionts was generally in agreement
with the systematics of the host insects: the symbionts
from congenic host species, Elasmostethus spp., Elasmucha
spp., Sastragala spp., and Acanthosoma spp., formed clades,
respectively. The monophyletic group of the acanthosomatid symbionts showed a phylogenetic affinity to the
clade of Buchnera, obligate endocellular symbionts of
aphids, and also to the clade of Ishikawaella, obligate gut
symbionts of plataspid stinkbugs (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of symbiotic bacteria based on a
protein-coding gene
To further confirm the phylogenetic placement of the
symbiotic bacteria, a groEL gene segment was cloned and
sequenced from E. nubilus, Elasmucha putoni, and S. esakii.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the sequences
revealed that the sequences of the acanthosomatid symbionts formed a well-supported monophyletic group and
clustered with the clade of aphid endosymbionts Buchnera
and also the clade of plataspid gut symbionts Ishikawaella
in the -Proteobacteria (Figure 4). The results of groEL gene

analyses were generally concordant with the results of 16S
rRNA gene analyses (cf. Figure 3).
Prevalence of symbiotic bacteria in natural host
populations
Diagnostic PCR surveys of field-collected acanthosomatid
stinkbugs consistently detected 100% infection frequencies of the symbiotic bacteria in all the species wherein
multiple samples were examined: 38/38 in E. humeralis;
50/50 in E. nubilus; 6/6 in E. putoni; and 6/6 in S. esakii.
Detection of symbiotic bacteria from dissected tissues
Dissected tissues, including head, flight muscle, foregut,
midgut first section, midgut second section, midgut third
section, midgut fourth section with crypts, hindgut,

abdominal tip, ovary, and egg, were prepared from adult
females of E. humeralis, E. nubilus, and E. putoni, and were
subjected to diagnostic PCR detection of the symbiotic
bacteria. In all the species, positive signals were consistently detected from midgut fourth section, abdominal tip,
and egg (Figure 5).
Vertical transmission of symbiotic bacteria via egg surface

otic bacteria were not detected from dissected ovaries of E.
humeralis, E. nubilus and E. putoni (Figure 5), refuting the
possibility of ovarial symbiont transmission. Newborn
nymphs of these species exhibited a characteristic behavior, probing of egg surface with their proboscis, soon after
hatching (Kikuchi, personal observation), suggesting the
possibility of symbiont transmission via egg surface contamination.
Sterilization of egg surface disrupted symbiont
transmission to newborn nymphs
In an attempt to experimentally confirm the possibility of
symbiont transmission via egg surface contamination, we
divided each of the egg masses of E. humeralis into two
portions. One of the halves was left untreated, the other

half was surface-sterilized, and newborn nymphs from
these experimental egg masses were subjected to diagnostic PCR detection of the symbiotic bacteria after hatching.
Most of the nymphs from the control egg masses were
symbiont-positive, whereas all of the nymphs from the
sterilized egg masses were symbiont-negative (Table 1).
Effects of symbiont elimination on fitness and phenotype
of host insects
Between the control egg masses and the sterilized egg
masses, no significant differences were found in time to
hatching (control, 4.1 ± 0.5 days, n = 182; sterilized, 4.1 ±
0.4 days, n = 180) and hatching rate (control, 95.4 ± 6.1%,
n = 14; surface sterilized, 97.3 ± 4.0%, n = 14), indicating
that surface sterilization of eggs did not affect the embry-

onic development of the insect. However, when we examined another set of experimental egg masses of E.
humeralis for inspection of post-hatch growth and development, drastic differences were detected between the
sterilized group and the control group. Adult emergence
rate was significantly lower in the sterilized group than in
the control group (Figure 6A). Developmental time to
adulthood was significantly longer in the sterilized group
(31.8 ± 6.6 days, n = 6) than in the control group (23.9 ±
2.9 days, n = 31) (Figure 6B). Body size in terms of thorax
width was not statistically different between the sterilized
group (4.59 ± 0.17 mm, n = 6) and the control group
(4.64 ± 0.32 mm, n = 31) (Figure 6C). However, adult
insects from the control egg masses were normal in color
(Figure 6D), whereas adult insects from the sterilized egg
masses exhibited abnormal pale coloration (Figure 6E).
Diagnostic PCR detection confirmed that all the adult
insects from the sterilized group were symbiont-free,
except an individual exhibiting a faint PCR signal (data
not shown).
Localization of symbiotic bacteria in lubricating organ
In the abdomen of adult females of E. humeralis, E. nubilus,
and other acanthosomatid species, we identified a pair of
characteristic 'lubricating organs' on the ventral side of the
body cavity near the abdominal tip (Figure 1F) which
were covered with yellowish membrane (Figure 1G) and
lined with cuticular layer (Figure 1H), as previously
reported by Rosenkranz [28]. In situ hybridization identified with certainty strong signals of the symbiotic bacteria
in the lubricating organ (Figure 1I). The symbiont in the
lubricating organ was shown to be identical to that in the
midgut crypts on the basis of cloning and sequencing of
16S rRNA gene (data not shown). The lubricating organ
consisted of two distinct regions: the sac-like region pop-

ulated by the symbiotic bacteria and the symbiont-free
chitinous ridge region (Figure 1H and 1I). On the outer
surface of the sac-like part, numerous tubulet-like structures were densely arranged into a layer, wherein the symbiont signals were localized (Figure 1I, inset). The organ
was not found in adult males (data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis of host insects based on a
mitochondrial gene
From the 14 acanthosomatid species, a mitochondrial
COI gene segment was cloned and sequenced. Molecular
phylogenetic analyses of the sequences revealed that congenic species, namely Elasmostethus spp., Elasmucha spp.,
Sastragala spp., and Acanthosoma spp., formed distinct
clades, respectively (Figure 7), which was in good agreement with the insect systematics.
Host-symbiont co-evolutionary analysis
Figure 8 contrasts the phylogeny of the acanthosomatid
stinkbugs and the phylogeny of their gut symbiotic bacteria. The symbiont phylogeny showed a remarkable similarity to the host phylogeny. The only local discrepancies
were seen with the placements of Lindbergicoris gramineus
and Acanthosoma forficula/A. labiduloides. The history of
the host-symbiont association was inferred by two different algorithms using the programs TreeMap [30] and
TreeFitter [31]. Both methods identified possible co-evolutionary histories with 10 to 11 co-divergence events
(Table 2). The consistently-observed 10 co-divergence
events are mapped in Figure 8, based on the result of the
TreeMap analysis. Both the TreeMap (Table 2A) and
TreeFitter (Table 2B) inferred significantly more co-speciation events than expected from a random distribution,
regardless of the chosen topologies for the unsolved
nodes. The Icong index [32] also indicated that the topological congruence between the host and symbiont trees
was statistically significant (Table 2C).
AT-rich genes of acanthosomatid symbionts
When the base compositions of the 16S rRNA gene region
from -proteobacterial representatives were inspected,
free-living bacteria like Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi
exhibited low AT content of around 45%. On the other
hand, obligate endocellular insect symbionts such as
Buchnera, Wigglesworthia, Blochmannia, and Baumannia
exhibited remarkably higher AT content of over 50%. The
AT content of the acanthosomatid gut symbionts were,
together with those of the plataspid gut symbionts Ishikawaella, consistently over 50% (cf. Figure 3), which were
equivalent to the values of the obligate insect endosymbionts rather than the values of the free-living bacteria.
When the base compositions of the groEL gene region
were examined, similar patterns were observed: free-living
bacteria like E. coli and S. typhi exhibited AT content of
around 45%; obligate endocellular insect symbionts such

those of free-living -proteobacteria like E. coli (4.6 Mb),
S. typhi (4.8 Mb), and V. cholerae (4.0 Mb), and close to
those of obligate endocellular insect symbionts such as

Discussion
Identification of novel gut symbiotic bacteria from
acanthosomatid stinkbugs
This study provides the first genetic and evolutionary
characterization of the symbiotic bacteria from stinkbugs
of the family Acanthosomatidae since the early histological description by Rosenkranz [28]. All of the 14 species
representing 5 genera that we examined possessed a welldeveloped symbiotic organ, consisting of a number of
closed tubular crypts fused two-dimensionally, in the
midgut fourth section (Figure 1). Electron microscopy
showed that rod-shaped bacterial cells, which are morphologically uniform with reduced cell wall, are packed in
the cavity of the crypts extracellularly (Figure 2). Genotyping and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed
that a specific -proteobacterium dominates the microflora in the symbiotic organ of each of the stinkbug species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S
rRNA gene and groEL gene sequences demonstrated that

these bacteria from the acanthosomatid stinkbugs form a
monophyletic group in the -Proteobacteria (Figures 3 and
4). Diagnostic PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed
with certainty that the 16S rRNA gene sequences originate
from the symbiotic bacteria in the isolated cavity of the
midgut crypts (Figures 1 and 5). On the basis of these
results, we conclude that the acanthosomatid stinkbugs
harbor a specific clade of -proteobacteria as extracellular
symbiont in the highly-specialized midgut crypts.
Relationship to gut symbiotic bacteria of other stinkbugs
A diverse array of stinkbugs are associated with gut symbiotic bacteria, most of which are harbored in the lumen of
the midgut crypts [2,23,33]. Despite these extensive histological descriptions, only a limited number of stinkbug
gut symbionts have been microbiologically characterized,
including -proteobacterial Ishikawaella from stinkbugs of
the family Plataspidae [19], -proteobacterial Burkholderia
from broad-headed bugs of the family Alydidae [34],

nocardioform actinomycetes from assassin bugs of the
family Reduviidae [35], and an unnamed -proteobacterium from the southern green stinkbug Nezara viridula of
the family Pentatomidae [22]. Molecular phylogenetic
analyses indicated that the clade of the acanthosomatid
gut symbionts is related to but distinct from the clade of
the plataspid gut symbionts Ishikawaella in the -Proteobacteria (Figures 3 and 4). These results indicate that the bacterial symbiont characterized in this study is specifically
associated with the family Acanthosomatidae, and
strongly suggest that symbiotic associations with diverse
microbes have evolved repeatedly and independently in
different stinkbug lineages.
Host-symbiont co-speciation in acanthosomatid stinkbugs
In obligate endocellular symbiotic bacteria of diverse
insects, such as Buchnera in aphids, Wigglesworthia in
tsetse flies, Blochmannia in ants, Baumannia in sharpshooters, Carsonella in psyllids, Portiera in whiteflies, Nardonella
in weevils, and others, the symbiont phylogeny generally
mirrors the host phylogeny, indicating stable and intimate host-symbiont associations over evolutionary time
[10,11,36-40]. By contrast, in gut symbiotic bacteria of
various insects, such as those in termites and alydid stinkbugs, the symbiont phylogeny does not reflect the host
phylogeny, suggesting promiscuous host-symbiont associations over evolutionary time [34,41,42]. Conventionally, it has been thought that such extracellular symbiotic
associations are evolutionarily more casual than the endo-

cellular symbiotic associations, on the grounds that the
symbionts are not isolated in the body cavity and vulnerable to invasion and replacement by foreign microbes [2].
Recently, however, strict host-symbiont co-speciation was
discovered in the gut symbiotic bacteria Ishikawaella of
plataspid stinkbugs [19]. In this study, we unveiled
another example of co-speciating gut symbiotic bacteria
in acanthosomatid stinkbugs (Figure 8), corroborating
the idea that host-symbiont co-speciation can occur even
in gut symbiotic associations. The co-cladogenetic pattern
suggests that a single bacterial infection in the common
ancestor of the Acanthosomatidae has been stably maintained over evolutionary time, diversifying in parallel with
the host speciation. The stable host-symbiont association
is suggestive of important biological roles of the symbiont
for the host insect and strict vertical transmission of the
symbiont through host generations.
Vertical symbiont transmission via egg surface
contamination
From eggs of acanthosomatid species, the symbiotic bacteria were consistently detected, whereas dissected ovaries
contained no symbiotic bacteria (Figure 5). Newborn
nymphs of these species exhibited a characteristic behavior, probing of egg surface with their proboscis, soon after
hatching (Kikuchi, personal observation). Sterilization of
egg surface resulted in disruption of symbiont transmission to newborn nymphs of E. humeralis (Table 1). These
results indicate that the symbiont is vertically transmitted

also known from the family Pentatomidae [21,22,28],
whereas different types of symbiont transmission have
been reported from other groups of stinkbugs, including
probing of parental bacteria-containing excrement
(coprophagy) from the families Cydnidae and Coreidae
[17,18], deposition of bacteria-containing capsules with
eggs (capsule transmission) from the family Plataspidae
[16,19,43], and acquisition of free-living bacteria from

the environment every generation (environmental acquisition) from the family Alydidae [20]. Probably because of
the extracellular symbiont location in the gut cavity, these
stinkbugs have evolved post-hatch symbiont transmission
mechanisms instead of the ovarial transmission mechanisms typical of endocellular symbionts of various insects.
Symbiont-dependent host growth and development
Thus far, diverse stinkbugs from the families Pentatomidae, Cydnidae, Plataspidae, Coreidae, Alydidae etc have

been reported to suffer retarded growth, sterility and/or
mortality when experimentally deprived of their gut symbiotic bacteria [16-21]. In this study, we provided the first
experimental demonstration that the gut symbiont is
important for normal growth and development of E.
humeralis, a member of the family Acanthosomatidae:
when deprived of the symbiont, the insects exhibited
lower adult emergence rate, prolonged developmental
time, and abnormal morphology (Figure 6). The biological roles played by the symbiont are currently unknown.
Acanthosomatid stinkbugs suck leaves, stems, and fruits
of their host plants [44]. Plausibly, the symbiont may provide the host with nutritional supplements, such as essential amino acids and vitamins, as has been demonstrated
in other plant-sucking insects [3,8].
Novel symbiotic organ 'isolated midgut crypts'
In most of the stinkbug groups, a number of sac- or tubelike crypts are present in a posterior region of the midgut,
and the cavity of the crypts, wherein the symbiotic bacteria are harbored, has a connection to the midgut main
tract [2,23,33]. Hence, the midgut main tract constantly
receives symbiont supply from the crypts, which can be
used for vertical transmission of the symbiont by egg surface contamination or other means. In the Acanthosomatidae, however, the cavity of the crypts is completely
disconnected from the midgut main tract (Figure 1) [28].
The isolated midgut crypts form a highly-specialized symbiotic organ, in which the symbiotic bacteria are confined
not in the cytoplasm but in the extracellular space (Figure
2). It is expected that the isolated cavity enables stable cultivation of the symbiotic bacteria that perform essential
biological roles for the host insect. How the symbiotic
organ is formed deserves future study. Probably the midgut crypts are not closed in newborn nymphs, the symbiotic bacteria ingested by the nymphs colonize the
rudimentary crypts, and the cryptic cavity is disconnected
from the midgut main tract in the developmental course
of the insects. Rosenkranz [28] observed that the midgut
crypts are connected to the main tract at least until the second nymphal instar in Acanthosoma haemorrhoidale.
Novel transmission apparatus 'lubricating organ'
While suitable for stable retention of the symbiotic bacteria, the isolated midgut crypts in the Acanthosomatidae
entail a serious problem: symbiont supply to anal excrement for vertical transmission is, unlike the other stinkbug groups, structurally disrupted. The dilemma is,
astonishingly, reconciled by the evolution of a novel
'lubricating organ' associated with the female ovipositor.
Rosenkranz [28] reported that, on the ventral side of the
posterior abdomen, adult females possess a pair of saclike organs with a chitinous lining consisting of numerous
bacteria-filled tubulets. Considering the structural configuration, it was postulated that the organ is arranged in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

such a way that eggs gliding downwards in the ovipositor
squeeze out a portion of the bacteria-containing fluid into
the vagina, whereby the egg surface is contaminated. In
this study, our histological observations confirmed the
description by Rosenkranz [28] (Figure 1E–H). In situ
hybridization and diagnostic PCR demonstrated the
microbiological identity of the bacteria in the isolated
midgut crypts, those in the lubricating organ, and those
on the egg surface (Figures 1 and 5). However, the development, infection process and evolutionary origin of the
lubricating organ are not yet fully understood, deserving
detailed histological and developmental studies in future.
Occasional lateral transfer of acanthosomatid symbiont:
possible relevant factors
Despite the global host-symbiont co-cladogenesis, it was
inferred that host switching of the symbiotic bacteria
might have occurred at least twice in the acanthosomatid
stinkbugs (Figure 8). How such lateral symbiont transfers
have taken place in the acanthosomatid species is currently unknown, but it may be relevant that the postnatal
symbiont transmission via egg smearing is potentially vulnerable to horizontal symbiont transmission between
host lineages [34]. Here, although speculative, we suggest
the possibility that plant utilization patterns of the acanthosomatid stinkbugs might have been involved in the
process. For example, a number of acathosomatid species
such as E. nubilus, S. esakii, S. scutellata, A. labiduroides, and
A. forticula commonly feed and reproduce on the same
plant, Swida controversa [44]. Under the condition that
egg-laying females of different species coexist on the same
plant, wandering newborn nymphs might encounter an
opportunity to acquire the symbiotic bacteria from heterospecific egg masses. On the other hand, we suggest the
possibility that the maternal brood care behavior typical
of the stinkbug group might have countered the process.
In acanthosomatid species such as E. putoni, E. dorsalis, E.
signoreti, S. esakii, S. scutellata, and A. gigantium, adult
females lay an egg mass on the host plant, and guard the
eggs and first instar offspring against predators by a series
of defensive behaviors, including covering the clutch with
the body, tilting the body toward the source of disturbance, strongly fanning the wings, etc. [45,46]. These antipredator behaviors might also discourage the access of
wandering newborn nymphs to heterospecific egg masses,
thereby preventing the lateral symbiont transfer. In these
contexts, experimental studies on lateral symbiont transfers between different acanthosomatid stinkbugs are of
ecological and evolutionary interest.
Reductive genome evolution in acanthosomatid symbiont
In most obligate endocellular symbiotic bacteria like
Buchnera in aphids, Wigglesworthia in tsetse flies, Blochmannia in ants, Baumannia in sharpshooters, and others,
remarkable evolutionary patterns, including AT-biased

BMC Biology 2009, 7:2

nucleotide composition, accelerated molecular evolution,
and reduced genome size, have been detected in comparison with their free-living relatives [6,7,47-51]. These
peculiar genetic traits have been argued in relation to the
attenuated purifying selection due to small population
size and strong bottleneck, which are associated with the
lifestyle of vertically transmitted endocellular symbionts
[12,13]. Here it should be noted that small population
size and strong bottleneck are also found in vertically
transmitted extracellular symbionts, like some gut symbiotic bacteria of stinkbugs. Recently, from the gut symbiotic bacteria of plataspid stinkbugs Ishikawaella, AT-biased
genes, accelerated evolution, and genome reduction were
identified [19]. In this study, we demonstrated that the
gut symbiotic bacteria of acanthosomatid stinkbugs also
exhibit these peculiar genetic traits (Figures 3, 4, and 9;
Tables 3 and 4). These findings suggest that the reductive
genome evolution in the insect symbionts is not simply
attributable to their endocellular or extracellular habitats.
Anyway, stable living inside the host insect symbiotically
may relax natural selection acting on a number of biological processes that are needed only for non-symbiotic life,
leading to degeneration and loss of genes relevant to those
processes over evolutionary time. Also, it appears plausible that attenuated purifying selection due to small population size and strong bottleneck might have facilitated
the reductive genome evolution.
Proposal of candidate name
On account of the remarkable and distinct genetic,
genomic, and microbiological traits described above, we
propose the designation 'Candidatus Rosenkranzia
clausaccus' for the symbiotic bacteria of the acanthosomatid stinkbugs.
(i) Diagnostic features
The symbiont belongs to the -Proteobacteria (Figures 3
and 4). The alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences from
18 isolates of the symbiont, representing 5 genera and 14
species of the host insects, plus other proteobacteria indicates the following distinctive residues (numbering based
on the E. coli sequence): GAA at positions 141 to 143,
GAGGAAGAAA at positions 444 to 453, AUGA(U/C)A at
positions 472 to 477, and AGG(U/C)UGU(A/G)AGC(U/
A)UGACUU at positions 831 to 848. The 16S rRNA gene
sequences reported here are AB368822-AB368839. Also
available are groEL gene sequences from three isolates of
the symbiont, AB379694-AB379696.

The symbiont is harbored in the extracellular cavity of the
symbiotic organ, consisting of a number of closed tubular
crypts fused two-dimensionally, in the terminal region of
the midgut (Figure 1B–E; Figure 5). In adult females, the
symbiont is also found in the lubricating organ associated
with the ovipositor (Figure 1F–I; Figure 5). Electron

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

microscopy shows that the symbiont is a rod-shaped bacterium, whose size and shape differ between the host species (Figure 2). The symbiont is vertically transmitted by
egg surface contamination with symbiont-containing
secretion from the lubricating organ associated with the
female ovipositor (Table 1; Figure 5). The symbiont genes
exhibit high AT content: 50.2–51.9% for 16S rRNA gene
(Figure 3) and 62.3–64.1% for groEL gene (Figure 4). The
symbiont genes exhibit accelerated molecular evolution
(Tables 3 and 4). The symbiont genome size is 0.90–0.96
Mb (Figure 8).
(ii) Hosts
The symbiont is associated with stinkbugs of the family
Acanthosomatidae, including E. humeralis, E. nubilus, Elasmostethus brevis, L. gramineus, E. putoni, Elasmucha dorsalis,
E. signoreti, S. esakii, S. scutellata, A. labiduroides, A. denticaudum, A. forficula, A. giganteum, and A. haemorrhoidale
(Additional file 1). Early histological descriptions [28]
suggest that the symbiont is also found in other acanthosomatid species including Elasmostethus interstinctus, Elasmostethus minor, Elasmucha ferrugata, Elasmucha fieberi,
Elasmucha grisea, Cyphostethus tristiatus, Planois bimaculata,
and Ditomotarsus gayi, although no molecular data are
available for them. The host phylogeny is largely concordant with the symbiont phylogeny (Figure 7), suggesting
stable host-symbiont association over evolutionary time.
Elimination of the symbiont results in retarded growth,
elevated mortality, and abnormal coloration of the host
insects (Figure 6). The symbiont has not been cultured
outside the host insects.
(iii) Nomenclature
The generic name honors Werner Rosenkranz, who first
described the symbiotic system of the acanthosomatid
stinkbugs [28]. The specific name refers to the completely
isolated midgut crypts for harboring the symbiotic bacteria (clausus = closed, saccus = bag or sack).

Conclusion
Our findings presented in this study strongly suggest that
the endocellular or extracellular environment matters little in the symbiont genome evolution. Symbiotic lifestyle
itself, which entails relaxed natural selection, small population size, and strong bottleneck, is likely to have substantially affected the reduced symbiont genomes. Here,
in a broader evolutionary context, we call attention to the
point that such population genetic features are not
restricted to symbiotic bacteria of insects and other organisms, but may be generally found in bacterial parasites
and pathogens intimately associated with their host
organisms. For obligate bacterial parasites and pathogens
that suffer no or inferior survival outside their eukaryotic
hosts including insects, animals, and even humans, the
microbial populations are expected to be more or less

Page 17 of 22

BMC Biology 2009, 7:2

divided and structured, potentially leading to small effective population size and strong bottleneck. It should be
noted that similar reductive genome evolution is also
observed in bacterial pathogens like Rickettsia, Chlamydia,
and Mycoplasma, among which some are endocellular and
others are not [52-54]. Hence, the same evolutionary logic
operating in the obligate endocellular and extracellular
bacterial symbionts may also apply to the bacterial parasites and pathogens, illuminating the evolutionary continuum from parasitism through commensalism to
mutualism.
Whilst the obligate endocellular and extracellular insect
symbionts exhibit globally similar patterns of reductive
genome evolution, we expect that close examination of
their genomes would reveal notable differences reflecting
their adaptation to and constraint in the different symbiotic lifestyles. In this context, it may be notable that the
genome sizes of the extracellular symbionts, Ishikawaella
and Rosenkranzia, are somewhat larger than those of endocellular ones like Buchnera and Wigglesworthia. The phylogenetic affinity of the aphid endocellular symbionts
Buchnera, the plataspid gut symbionts Ishikawaella, and
the acanthosomatid gut symbionts Rosenkranzia (Figures
3 and 4) provides an ideal opportunity for comparative
genomic analyses, which would lead to further insights
into how their symbiotic lifestyles have affected their
molecular, evolutionary, and genomic features.

Methods
Insect materials
Acanthosomatid stinkbugs representing 5 genera, 14 species, and 20 populations were examined in this study
(Additional file 1). Adult females were mainly used,
whereas egg masses collected in the field were subjected to
diagnostic PCR analyses. The samples were preserved in
acetone or 99% ethanol immediately after collection until
molecular and histological analyses were carried out [55].
For electron microscopy, adult insects were brought alive
to the laboratory, dissected, and fixed. Egg masses of E.
humeralis deposited by field-collected adult females in the
laboratory were used for experiments of symbiont elimination and fitness measurement.
DNA extraction
Dissected insect tissues and isolated eggs were individually subjected to DNA extraction using the NucleoSpin
Tissue Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL). For tissue preparation,
the preserved insects were softened by soaking in 70%
ethanol, and dissected under a binocular microscope by
using fine forceps. From each of the adult females, head,
flight muscle, foregut, swollen midgut first section, thin
midgut second section, swollen midgut third section,
midgut fourth section with crypts, hindgut, ovary, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

abdominal tip containing the lubricating organs were dissected.
Cloning, genotyping and sequencing
A 1.5 kb segment of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the primers 16SA1 (5'-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG
CTC AG-3') and 16SB1 (5'-TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG
ACT T-3') [56]. A 1.7 kb segment of bacterial groEL gene
was amplified with the primers Gro-F1 (5'-ATG GCA
GCW AAA GAC GTA AAT TYG G-3') and Gro-R1 (5'-TTA
CAT CAT KCC GCC CAT GC-3') [57]. A 0.6 kb segment of
insect mitochondrial COI gene was amplified with the
primers LCO1490 (5'-GGT CAA CAA ATC ATA AAG ATA
TTG G-3') and HCO2198 (5'-TAA ACT TCA GGG TGA
CCA AAA AAT CA-3') [58]. PCR was conducted by using
AmpliTaqGold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems)
and its supplemented buffer system under a temperature
profile of 95°C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 95°C
for 30 sec, 55°C (16S rRNA gene), 55°C (groEL gene) or
48°C (COI gene) for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The PCR
products were cloned with TA-cloning vector pT7Blue
(Takara) and E. coli DH5 competent cells (Takara).
Inserted clones were screened by direct colony PCR with
the primers Univ19 (5'-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACG T3') and Rev20 (5'-AGC TAT GAC CAT GAT TAC GC-3')
that flank the cloning site of the vector. As for 16S rRNA
gene, 10 or more amplified products from each of the
samples were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping by using restriction endonucleases HaeIII and RsaI. Three or more plasmid clones
from each of the samples were prepared by using
QIAprep-Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN). The purified plasmids were eluted with 50 l of distilled water, and subjected to DNA sequencing by using BigDye Terminator
Cycle sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and ABI
PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer) as previously
described [34].
Histology
The preserved insects were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7
mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4 [pH 7.5]), and the dissected tissues were transferred to Carnoy's solution (ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid = 6:3:1). After an overnight fixation, the
tissues were treated with 6% hydrogen peroxide in 80%
ethanol for three days for quenching autofluorescence
[59], and then kept in 100% ethanol at room temperature. The samples were cleared through an ethanol-xylene
series, embedded in paraffin, and processed into 5 m
serial sections on a rotary microtome. The tissue sections
were mounted on silane-coated glass slides, dewaxed
through a xylene-ethanol series, and air-dried prior to
hematoxylin-eosin staining or in situ hybridization. For
whole-mount in situ hybridization, the preserved samples

BMC Biology 2009, 7:2

were washed twice in PBS and directly subjected to
hybridization procedures.
In situ hybridization
The following fluorochrome-conjugated probes for detection of 16S rRNA of the symbiotic bacteria were used for
in situ hybridization: Cy5-EhSym16S (5'-Cy5-CAT CCT
TAT TAA GAA TGA TCG-3') specifically targeting the symbiont of E. humeralis; TNKM16S-A555 (5'-Alexa555-CCT
TCA TTA GGC AGA TCC-3') and Cy5-AcSym16S (5'-Cy5TTT GTA TAC ACC ATT GTA-3') targeting the acanthosomatid symbionts collectively.In situ hybridization was
performed essentially as described previously [34]. The
tissue samples were incubated in a hybridization buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.9 M NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 30%
formamide) containing 50 nM of either of the probes. For
counter-staining of host insect nuclei, 4 M of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) or 0.5 M of SYTOX
Green (Invitrogen) was added to the hybridization buffer.
After an overnight incubation, the samples were thoroughly washed in PBS and mounted in Slowfade antifade
solution (Molecular Probes). The sectioned and wholemount samples were observed under an epifluorescent
microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss) and a laser scanning
confocal microscope (LSCM Pascal5, Carl Zeiss), respectively. To confirm specificity of the detection, a series of
control experiments were conducted as previously
described [59].
Electron microscopy
The tissues containing the midgut crypts were dissected
from live insects in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), prefixed in the fixative at 4°C
overnight, and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide at 4°C
for 60 min. After dehydration through an ethanol series,
the materials were embedded in Spurr resin (NisshinEM). Ultrathin sections (thickness, 80 nm) were made on
an
ultramicrotome
(Ultracat-N,
Leichert-Nissei),
mounted on collodion-coated copper meshes, stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under a
transmission electron microscope (model H-7000,
Hitachi).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences were
generated using the program CLUSTAL W [60]. The alignments were then inspected and corrected manually, from
which ambiguously aligned sites were removed. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by the three methods maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian. MP and ML trees were constructed using the
program PAUP 4.0b10 [61]. In the MP analysis, all sites
and character changes were weighted equally. In the ML
analysis, we selected the GTR + I + G model for the 16S
rRNA, groEL and COI gene phylogenies, on the basis of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/2

Akaike criterion estimated by the program Modeltest 3.06
[62]. Bootstrap tests were performed with 100 replications
in the MP and ML analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, the
programs MrBayes v3.0b4 [63] and MrModeltest v2.1 [64]
were used. The Akaike criterion selected the GTR + I + G
model for the 16S rRNA, groEL and COI gene phylogenies.
In total 8000, 10 000 and 4500 trees were obtained for the
16S rRNA gene (ngen = 120 000, samplefreq = 10, burn in
= 4000), the groEL gene (ngen = 160 000, samplefreq = 10,
burn in = 6000) and the host COI gene (ngen = 60 000,
samplefreq = 10, burn in = 1500), respectively. Based on
the data, a 50% majority-rule consensus tree was constructed.
Co-evolutionary analysis
Based on the host and symbiont Bayesian trees, the history of host-symbiont association was investigated by the
programs TreeMap v2.02 [30,65] and TreeFitter v1.0
[31], and host-symbiont co-divergence level was evaluated by randomization tests. Although TreeMap and
TreeFitter require fully resolved trees, the symbiont phylogeny contained several unsolved parts, particularly in the
genus Acanthosoma (cf. Figure 3). Thus, of the nine possible fully-resolved patterns of the symbiont phylogeny (cf.
Additional file 2), two trees were a priori chosen and
inspected: one was maximizing the co-divergence number
and the other minimizing it. TreeMap uses a model to find
optimal reconstructions of the association history by maximizing co-divergence events [30], while TreeFitter minimizes total event costs to find optimal reconstructions
[31]. In both the programs, reconciliation analyses were
performed under the default setting of the event costs
(TreeMap: co-divergence = 0; duplication = 1; host switch
= 1; valuesorting = 1; TreeFitter: co-divergence = 0; duplication = 0; host switch = 2; sorting = 1). Then, the extent
of the observed host-symbiont co-evolution was statistically evaluated by a randomization test. A distribution of
expected score, the number of co-divergence events for
TreeMap and global cost for TreeFitter, was produced by
comparing randomly generated symbiont trees and the
observed host tree, on which statistical significance of the
observed score was tested. In TreeMap and TreeFitter,
1000 and 10,000 symbiont trees were randomly generated, respectively.

Phylogenetic congruence between host and symbiont was
also evaluated by using Icong index [32], wherein topological congruence of two trees is assessed through their
maximum agreement subtrees (MAST). A MAST is the
largest possible tree compatible with two given trees and
is obtained by removing the minimum number of leaves
(terminal branches) in both trees to obtain perfect congruence. Significance of topological congruence was
inferred by a randomization test concerning the size of the
MAST.

Relative rate test
Genetic distances were estimated under the HKY substitution model and the gamma distribution of rate variation
across nucleotide sites by using the program TREEPUZZLE5.2 [66]. To take into account the phylogenetic
relationship among the sequences, the genetic distances
between the lineages were calculated as weighted average
[67]. The significance of the rate differences was evaluated
by generating 10 000 bootstrap replicates of the alignment sites [68]. In these tests, we excluded all aligned sites
containing a gap or an unresolved base in any of the
sequences considered.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis
A portion of the midgut crypts was dissected from a
female adult insect, and was homogenized in 50 l of PBS
containing 10 mM EDTA. The homogenate was filtered
through a 10 m nylon mesh, and the filtered suspension
was mixed with 1% low melting point agarose. The agarose plug was cut into an appropriate shape and size, and
treated with proteinase K at 50°C overnight. After thorough washing in TE buffer, the plug was subjected to
digestion with either of the restriction endonucleases AscI,
ApaI, I-CeuI, or SmaI. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was
conducted by using CHEF Mapper XA (Bio-Rad).

Diagnostic PCR
A 0.5 kb segment of 16S rRNA gene of the symbiotic bacteria of acanthosomatid stinkbugs was amplified with the
primers 16SA1 and TNKM16SR (5'-GYG AGT AAC GTC
AAT TAT CAT NCT-3') under a temperature profile of
95°C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec,
55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min. To confirm the quality of the DNA samples, a segment of mitochondrial COI
gene was amplified with the primers LCO1490 and
HCO2198 as described above.

Authors' contributions

Surface sterilization of eggs
Each egg mass of E. humeralis was divided into two portions. One was untreated, whereas the other was treated
with 70% ethanol for 10 min, 4% formaldehyde containing 0.01% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and rinsed thoroughly
with 70% ethanol twice. Each of the experimental egg
masses was kept in a Petri dish with a wet cotton ball at
25°C until hatching. To confirm successful elimination of
the symbiont, hatchlings from the experimental egg
masses were subjected to DNA extraction and diagnostic
PCR two days after the second instar molt.
Measurement of fitness parameters
A pair of adult female and male E. humeralis was reared in
a plastic case (8 cm in diameter, 5.5 cm in depth), and fed
with fruits of udo plant (Aralia cordata) and dried seeds of
peanut (Arachis hypogaea) at 25°C under a long day regimen (16 h light, 8 h dark). Egg masses laid by four pairs
of the insect were used for the following experiments. The
control and sterilized egg mass portions were examined
for time to hatching and hatching rate. The hatchlings
from the experimental egg mass portions were separately
reared as described above. Growth and survival of the
nymphs were monitored until all of them either reached
adulthood or died. The following parameters were
recorded: adult emergence rate, time to adulthood, and
adult thorax width. The data were statistically analyzed by
Fisher's exact probability test and Mann-Whitney U test by
using the software R v2.6.2 [69].

YKi, TH, and TF designed and coordinated the experiments. YKi carried out the molecular genetic analyses, histological studies, and fitness measurements. TH
performed the statistical analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. NN carried out the phylogenetic analysis of a
protein-coding gene and relative rate test. XYM performed
the electron microscopy. YKa and TF contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools. YKi and TF wrote the
paper. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
