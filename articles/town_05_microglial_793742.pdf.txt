Abstract
Microglia are innate immune cells of myeloid origin that take up residence in the central nervous
system (CNS) during embryogenesis. While classically regarded as macrophage-like cells, it is
becoming increasingly clear that reactive microglia play more diverse roles in the CNS. Microglial
"activation" is often used to refer to a single phenotype; however, in this review we consider that
a continuum of microglial activation exists, with phagocytic response (innate activation) at one end
and antigen presenting cell function (adaptive activation) at the other. Where activated microglia
fall in this spectrum seems to be highly dependent on the type of stimulation provided. We begin
by addressing the classical roles of peripheral innate immune cells including macrophages and
dendritic cells, which seem to define the edges of this continuum. We then discuss various types
of microglial stimulation, including Toll-like receptor engagement by pathogen-associated
molecular patterns, microglial challenge with myelin epitopes or Alzheimer's β-amyloid in the
presence or absence of CD40L co-stimulation, and Alzheimer disease "immunotherapy". Based on
the wide spectrum of stimulus-specific microglial responses, we interpret these cells as immune
cells that demonstrate remarkable plasticity following activation. This interpretation has relevance
for neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases where reactive microglia play an etiological
role; in particular viral/bacterial encephalitis, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer disease.

Introduction
Microglia are somewhat enigmatic central nervous system
(CNS) cells that have been traditionally regarded as CNS
macrophages (MΦs). They represent about 10% on average of the adult CNS cell population [1]. In mice, microglial progenitors can be detected in neural folds at the
early stages of embryogenesis. Murine microglia are
thought to originate from the yolk sac at a time in embry-

ogenesis when monocyte/Mφ progenitors (of hematopoeitic origin) are also found [1,2]. Based on this observation,
it is now generally accepted that adult mouse microglia
originate from monocyte/MΦ precursor cells migrating
from the yolk sac into the developing CNS. Once CNS residents, these newly migratory cells actively proliferate during development, thereby giving rise to the resident CNS
microglial cell pool. More recently however, it has been

shown that bone marrow-derived cells can enter the CNS
and become cells that phenotypically resemble microglia
in the adult mouse [3-5]. Interestingly, under conditions
of CNS damage such as stroke, cholinergic fiber degeneration, or motor neuron injury, Priller and colleagues
found that green fluorescent protein-labeled bone marrow cells could enter the CNS and take up a microglial
phenotype [6].
Microglia normally exist in a quiescent (resting) state in
the healthy CNS, and are morphologically characterized
by a small soma and ramified processes. However, upon
"activation" in response to invading viruses or bacteria or
CNS injury, microglia undergo morphological changes
including shortening of cellular processes and enlargement of their soma (sometimes referred to as an "amoeboid" phenotype). Activated microglia also up-regulate a
myriad of cell surface activation antigens and produce
innate cytokines and chemokines (discussed in detail
below). As the microglial lineage originates from peripheral myeloid precursor cells, it is helpful to consider the
activation states of such peripheral innate immune cells to
better understand the nature of microglial activation.
Classical roles of peripheral innate immune cells
It is now widely accepted that both innate and adaptive
arms of the immune system play important roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. However, little attention
was paid to the evolutionarily much older innate immune
system until the late Charlie Janeway proposed the
involvement of innate mechanisms in vertebrate immunity. Specifically, Janeway pioneered the idea that lymphocyte activation could be critically regulated by the
evolutionarily ancient system of antigen clearance by
phagocytic cells of myeloid origin. Together with Ruslan
Mezhitov, he originated the concept that these phagocytic
innate immune cells recognize pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition
receptors, the most notable examples being a set of phylogenetically conserved, germ-line encoded Toll-like receptors (TLRs, currently 11–12 members, [7-10]), resulting in
expression of cell-surface activation molecules [for example, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and
II, B7.1, B7.2, and CD40] and secretion of innate
cytokines [i.e., tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18] [11,12]. Once activated, the innate arm of the immune response calls
adaptive immune cells into action, and both branches act
in concert to promote neutralization and clearance of
invading pathogens. Thus, innate immune cells are able to
discriminate "non-infectious self" from "infectious nonself" and thereby form the first line of defense against
invading bacteria and viruses (for reviews see [13-15]).

The macrophage: prototypical phagocyte
MΦs are quintessential phagocytes whose primary role is
to engulf pathogens such as invading bacteria and to
remove debris and detritus, i.e., remnants of apoptotic
cells. Tissue MΦs develop when blood monocytes enter
into the various organs and tissues and differentiate into
specialized, site-specific MΦs depending on their anatomical location, such as alveolar MΦs (lung), histiocytes
(connective tissue), kupffer cells (liver), mesangial cells
(kidney), osteoclasts (bone), or microglia (brain) [16].
Resting MΦs are both weak phagocytes and weak lymphocyte activators [17]. Upon activation however, for
example in response to TLR stimulation by PAMPs, their
phagocytic potential greatly enhances [18] and they upregulate cell-surface co-stimulatory molecules and produce pro-inflammatory innate cytokines as mentioned
above. Typically, engulfment of the pathogen by phagocytosis triggers a "respiratory burst" involving production of
reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and peroxinitrite that kill the pathogen [17,19]. In addition, activated
MΦs up-regulate cell-surface Fc receptors that aid in
phagocytosis of pathogens opsonized by antibodies produced by plasma cells [20,21]. On the other hand, in
response to debris from apoptotic cells, the MΦ mounts a
phagocytic response essentially in the absence of proinflammatory cytokines [22]. The most likely reason for
this anti-inflammatory phagocytic response is that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α promote
bystander injury which may further damage tissues in
which the apoptotic cells reside. Thus, MΦs are highly
capable of "innate activation" characterized by a strong
phagocytic response sometimes accompanied by proinflammatory cytokine production (for a review see [23]).
The dendritic cell: professional antigen presenting cell
Whereas MΦs have limited ability to process and present
antigen to T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) are considered
professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). DCs can be
found under the epithelia and in most organs where they
capture and process non-self antigens, migrate to lymphoid organs, and present antigen in the context of MHC
to CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. With their many finger-like cellular processes, DCs are morphologically optimized to simultaneously display antigen to many T cells.
Like MΦs, DCs respond to invading pathogens by recognizing PAMPs through TLRs, and subsequently phagocytose and process antigen. DCs then up-regulate cellsurface co-stimulatory molecules and secrete innate
cytokines and chemokines (typically at levels an order of
magnitude higher than those secreted by MΦs) to promote recruitment and activation of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T
lymphocytes. There are three generally accepted classifications of DCs in mice: plasmacytoid (p) DCs (CD11clo,
CD11blo, B220+, CD8-), lymphoid (l) DCs (CD11c+,
CD11b-, CD8+), and myeloid (m) DCs (CD11c+,

CD11b+, B220-, CD8-, there are several subtypes, [24]).
In humans, there are clearly two distinct subsets of DCs:
pDCs (CD11c-, CD11b-, CD14-, CD45RA+) and monocyte DCs (CD11c+, CD11b+, CD14+, CD45RA-) (for a
review see [25]). DC classes differ from each other predominately in tissue distribution, production of specific
cytokines, TLR expression, and ability to promote innate
versus adaptive immune responses (for a review see [15]).
For example, freshly isolated human pDCs express TLR7
and 9, whereas mDCs express TLR1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 [2628]. Stimulation of human pDCs or monocytic DCs with
synthetic TLR7 ligands induces the secretion of interferon
(IFN)-α (important for anti-viral innate immunity) or IL12 [a key inducer of the adaptive T helper (Th) type I
response], respectively [29]. Similarly, stimulation of
TLR9 via DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs
results in IFN-α secretion by pDCs and IL-12 production
by murine mDCs [30]. Despite these relative differences
between DC classes, the major role of DCs on the whole
remains; they act as potent APCs capable of strongly activating T lymphocytes. Their APC capacity is much
stronger than that of MΦs, as DCs are able to directly activate naïve T cells whereas MΦs are not [15]. Thus, by virtue of their ability to promote T cell activation responses,
DCs are highly capable of "adaptive activation". Activation markers of phagocytosis and APC responses in various innate immune cells are presented in Table 1.

Microglial activation after toll-like receptor
stimulation: a mixed response
Recent evidence indicates that microglia, like their peripheral innate immune cell counterparts, express a wide array
of TLRs, including mRNA for TLRs 1–9 in mice [31] and

in humans [32]. Furthermore, many of these TLRs have
been shown to be functional, allowing microglial recognition of a variety of PAMPs. For example, Kielian and coworkers found that heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus and
its cell wall product peptidoglycan (PGN) are able to stimulate innate activation of microglia characterized by proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production [33].
Those authors found that the effect of PGN was critically
dependent on TLR2, as TLR2-deficient mice demonstrated
reduced cytokine and chemokine production after PGN
challenge [34]. Furthermore, murine microglia respond to
the TLR9 agonist, unmethylated CpG-DNA, by secreting
numerous pro-inflammatory innate cytokines (probably
responsible for neurotoxicity in oganotypic brain slice cultures treated with CpG-DNA [35]), by up-regulating costimulatory cell surface molecules, and by promoting
adaptive activation by secreting IL-12 to affect T cell activation [36]. In two recent studies, murine microglial proinflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a known TLR4 ligand, resulted in dramatic injury to
cultured oligodendrocytes [37] and neurons [38], further
demonstrating microglial bystander injury after TLR stimulation (probably mediated by over-production of innate
pro-inflammatory cytokines). It has recently been shown
that microglia respond to poly I:C [a synthetic doublestranded (ds) RNA analog thought to be recognized by
TLR3, [39]] by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines [40], and microglial pro-inflammatory
responses to dsRNA seem to be dependent on TLR3, as
TLR3-deficient microglia have blunted innate cytokine
responses in vitro and markedly reduced cell surface activation markers in brain after poly I:C stimulation (Town
et al., submitted). Finally, infection with West Nile virus,

37°C or at 4°C (control) with yellow-green fluorescent latex
beads (1:1000, Sigma). After extensive rinsing, microglia were
subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and

obtain percentage of phagocytosis increase over baseline.

a retrovirus that produces dsRNA during its life cycle,
results in profound microglial activation as assessed by
pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and cell
surface activation markers in vivo, effects that are dramatically reduced in TLR3-deficient animals [41].
In addition to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and up-regulation of cell surface activation antigens,
phagocytosis is a hallmark indicator of innate immune
cell activation. We have recently investigated microglial
phagocytosis in response to PAMP stimulation using both
the N9 microglial cell line and primary cultured microglia
derived from neonatal C57BL/6 mice (for methods see
[42]). We pre-treated either N9 cells or primary cultured
microglia with poly (I:C) (50 µg/mL), LPS (50 ng/mL),
PGN (50 µg/mL), or CpG-DNA (1 µM) for 6 hours, rinsed

the cells multiple times in complete RMPI 1640 media,
and then cultured cells in the presence of a 1:1000 dilution of yellow-green fluorescent latex beads (Sigma) at
37°C or at 4°C (a control for non-specific incorporation
of beads) for 1 hour. After this final culture period, cells
were rinsed multiple times in complete media and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and
mean fluorescence intensity values obtained from cells at
4°C were subtracted from figures obtained from cells cultured at 37°C. These corrected figures were then normalized for each treatment condition to values obtained from
untreated control cells, yielding a percentage of phagocytosis increase over baseline. As shown in Fig. 1, both N9
and primary cultured microglia increased phagocytosis
after stimulation with each PAMP studied by as much as
~190% over baseline (see PGN treatment of N9 cells, Fig.
1A).
When taking these results together with the above-mentioned reports, it seems that PAMP stimulation of TLRs
produces a "mixed" microglial activation phenotype. In
terms of innate responses, PAMP-stimulated microglia
clearly secrete pro-inflammatory innate cytokines (i.e.,
TNF-α and IL-6), up-regulate cell-surface activation markers (i.e., MHC I and II, B7.1, B7.2, CD40), and increase
phagocytosis. Regarding adaptive responses, particularly
in the case of CpG-DNA stimulation of TLR9, reactive
microglia activate T lymphocytes and may bias CD4+ T
cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper type I response
by secreting IL-12 [36].
In peripheral innate immune cells, TLR responses to
PAMPs seem to be dependent on at least four different
TLR intracellular adapter molecules: MyD88 (involved in
TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 signaling), TRIF/TICAM-1 (mediates TLR3 and 4 signaling), TIRAP/Mal (involved in TLR1,
2, 4, and 6 responses) and TIRP/TRAM/TICAM-2 (mediates TLR4 signaling). These adapter molecules bind to the
intracellular leucine-rich repeat region of the TLR and promote recruitment of additional factors such as IRAKs and
TRAF6 that allow for activation of transcription factors
including IRF-3 and NF-κB, which are responsible for activation of numerous innate cytokines and cell-surface activation antigen genes (for review see [43,44]). It is still
unclear how different TLR responses in innate immune
cells (i.e., promotion of innate versus adaptive responses)
can be achieved when many TLRs share intracellular signaling molecules. While little work has been done on intracellular signaling following TLR stimulation in microglia,
it is likely that microglia utilize the same signaling cascades described for MΦs and DCs.

Adaptive response of activated microglia in
demyelinating disease via CD40-CD40 ligand
interaction
Brain inflammation in demyelinating disease
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a
mouse model of the human disease multiple sclerosis
(MS), an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory CNS demyelinating lesions accompanied by motor
disturbances. EAE can be induced in different strains of
mice by subcutaneous or intraperioteneal inoculation
with adjuvant plus epitopes found in myelin such proteolipid protein, myelin basic protein, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The disease is critically
dependent on activation of pro-inflammatory CD4+ T
helper type I (Th1) cells by APCs, and these auto-aggressive Th1 cells can be adoptively transferred to non-diseased recipient mice that subsequently develop disease.
EAE is characterized by paralysis, typically beginning in
the tail and hind limbs and progressing to the fore limbs.
In the SJL mouse strain, animals develop a relapsingremitting form of the disease while C57BL/6 mice manifest paralysis that progressively worsens until death. Upon
histopathological analysis, brains from EAE mice generally show infiltration of Th1 cells (and other lymphocytes
including MΦs and DCs) and activation of microglia, typically in white matter regions where demyelinating lesions
are found (for a review see [45-47]).
CD40-CD40 ligand interaction in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis
Immune/inflammatory cells receiving a primary stimulus
(i.e., MHC-T cell receptor interaction between APCs and T
lymphocytes, respectively) typically require co-stimulatory signals via other pairs of molecules in order to
become activated [for instance, the B7-CD28 and/or
CD40-CD40 ligand (L) dyads in APC/T-cell activation;
[48]. CD40L is a key immunoregulatory molecule that
plays a co-stimulatory role in the activation of immune
cells from both the innate and adaptive arms of the
immune system, and is typically expressed by activated
CD4+ and some CD8+ T cell subsets [49]. CD40 receptor,
a member of TNF and nerve growth factor super-family, is
expressed on many professional and non-professional
APCs, including DC's, B cells, monocytes/MΦs and microglial cells [42,50-53]. Nearly 10 years ago, activated Th
cells that expressed CD40 ligand (CD40L) were found in
brains of MS patients, and these cells were found in close
apposition to CD40-bearing cells in active demyelinating
lesions [54]. The authors determined that the CD40expressing cells were either MΦ or microglia based on
staining for acid phosphatase or CD11b.

To evaluate whether the CD40-CD40L interaction was
pathogenic in EAE, Gerritse and co-workers administered
a CD40L neutralizing antibody to SJL mice that were given

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/2/1/24

proteolipid protein with adjuvant to induce EAE. Strikingly, EAE was prevented in a prophylactic treatment regimen of anti-CD40L, and, when EAE was induced in
another cohort of animals, CD40L antibody treatment
significantly reduced disease severity in an active treatment paradigm [54]. It was later shown that genetic deficiency in CD40L [55] or antibody-mediated blockade of
CD40L [56] resulted in attenuation of Th1 differentiation
and effector function, including marked inhibition of the
Th1 cytokine IFN-γ and reduced numbers of encephalitogenic effector T cells. In an effort to further understand the
nature of the CD40-CD40L interaction responsible for
promotion of EAE, Becher and colleagues used a bone
marrow reconstitution system to determine which CD40expressing cells were responsible for promoting EAE [57].
In that report, the authors showed that CD40 expression
by parenchymal microglia was responsible for recruitment/retention of encephalitogenic T cells in EAE. Strikingly, treatment of microglia with a combination of
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and
CD40L has been shown to promote differentiation of
these cells into cells that (1) express the pan-DC marker
CD11c, (2) morphologically resemble DCs, and (3)
secrete the Th1-promoting cytokine IL-12 p70 [58]. Such
CD11c+ CD11b+ "DC-like" microglia were found in EAE
brain lesions in inflammatory foci containing T cells, and
exhibited potent stimulation of allogeneic T cell proliferation versus CD11c- CD11b+ microglia [58]. Although
their origin was not determined, it was recently shown
that "CNS DCs" (possibly "DC-like" microglia) are
responsible for activation of naïve T cells in response to
endogenous myelin epitopes (termed "epitope spreading"), and this process was initiated in the CNS as
opposed to the peripheral lymphoid organs [59]. Thus, in
the context of EAE, CD40-CD40L interaction on microglia
seems to promote adaptive function of these cells, resulting in a "DC-like" activated microglia phenotype that promotes encephalitogenic Th1 cell differentiation and
effector function.

Activation of microglia after CD40 ligation in
Alzheimer disease: a shift from innate to
adaptive response

Alzheimer disease and microglial responses to β-amyloid
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common dementia
and is characterized by insidious onset in late life with
progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions. Definitive diagnosis of AD is made at autopsy,
based on the neuropathological hallmarks of extracellular
amyloid plaques [largely comprised of β-amyloid (Aβ)
peptides, derived from the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, brain inflammation, characterized by
reactive astrocytes and microglia (but very low levels of
infiltrating T cells), is found in close vicinity of amyloid

Journal of Neuroinflammation 2005, 2:24

plaques in AD and in transgenic mouse models of the disease (for a review see [60]). It has been suggested that activated microglia play a key role in AD pathogenesis as they
secrete pro-inflammatory innate cytokines such as TNF-α
and IL-1β, which have been shown to promote neuronal
injury at high levels [61,62,62,63]. Furthermore, there is a
large body of evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is associated with reduced risk for
AD in humans [64-66], (for a review see [67]), and NSAID
treatment of AD mice results in reduced amyloid plaque
burden concomitant with ameliorated microglial activation [68-70]. Work done in Maxfield's laboratory showed
that challenge of microglia with labeled Aβ peptides promotes phagocytosis but poor degradation of soluble or
fibrillar Aβ via scavenger receptors [71-73]. Using knockout mice, his laboratory showed that the class A scavenger
receptor (type I and II) is the predominant scavenger
receptor responsible for Aβ uptake by microglia, with
other scavenger receptors playing a more minor role
(including the class B scavenger receptor CD36) [74].
Microglial responses to β-amyloid in the context of CD40
ligation
We previously showed that, while murine microglial challenge with soluble Aβ peptides alone does not elicit TNFα secretion, co-stimulation provided in the form of CD40
ligation (either via CD40L or an agonistic CD40 antibody) results in TNF-α production being synergistically
affected [41]. Further, microglia cultured from AD mice
deficient in CD40L demonstrate reduced TNF-α secretion
versus CD40L-sufficient AD mouse microglia [42]. This
form of microglial activation in CD40L-sufficient AD
mice is pathogenic, as CD40L-deficient AD mice demonstrate reduced activated (CD11b+) microglia, an effect
that is associated with mitigated abnormal hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein (a key indicator of neuronal
stress) [42]. Furthermore, genetic ablation of CD40L or
administration of a CD40L-neutralizing antibody markedly reduces amyloid plaques in mouse models of AD,
effects that are associated with mitigated astrocytosis and
microgliosis ([75], for review see [76,77]). Recently, overproduction of microglia-associated CD40 and of astrocyte-derived CD40L was found in and around β-amyloid
plaques in AD patient brain [78,79], raising the possibility
that the CD40-CD40L interaction may contribute to AD
pathogenesis by promoting brain inflammation.

In order to better understand the form of microglial activation affected by Aβ plus CD40L stimulation, we examined innate and adaptive activation of murine microglia
challenged with Aβ in the presence or absence of CD40L
co-stimulation [80]. When microglia were challenged
with fluorescent-tagged synthetic human Aβ alone, they
mounted a time-dependent phagocytic response (from 15
min to 60 min) which could be enhanced by Fc receptor

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/2/1/24

stimulation using an anti-human Aβ antibody (clone
BAM-10). This phagocytic response to Aβ alone was not
associated with production of the pro-inflammatory
innate cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β, a result similar to
that seen when microglia are challenged with apoptotic
cells and mount an anti-inflammatory, pro-phagocytic
innate response [81]. Importantly, CD40L treatment
opposed this phagocytic response, as determined by
measuring both cell-associated Aβ and free extracellular
Aβ. As mentioned above, Maxfield's laboratory demonstrated that microglia slowly degrade phagocytosed Aβ
peptides [71-73]. We examined the ability of microglia to
degrade Aβ peptides by first pulsing them with Aβ and
then chasing these cells after 1 hour of culture in the presence or absence of CD40L stimulation. Using this experimental approach, we found that CD40L also retarded
microglial clearance of the peptide. We further assessed
putative modulation of microglial Aβ phagocytosis by
cytokines known to promote effector T cell function, and
found that the pro-inflammatory Th1-type cytokines IFNγ and TNF-α inhibited Aβ phagocytosis whereas the antiinflammatory Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 boosted
this response.
Having established that CD40 ligation attenuates innate
(phagocytic) activation of microglia challenged with Aβ,
we then examined the role of CD40 ligation in APC function of Aβ-treated microglia by first determining if Aβ peptides could be co-localized with MHC II. Interestingly,
CD40 ligation promoted "loading" of Aβ peptides onto
the MHC II molecule as determined by double immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoprecipitation
assays. Finally, we determined whether this Aβ-MHC II
co-localization was functional by first pre-treating microglia with Aβ in the presence or absence of CD40L, co-culturing these microglia with CD4+ T cells, and then
measuring cytokine levels in co-cultured media. Interestingly, Aβ plus CD40L pre-treatment of microglia resulted
in markedly enhanced levels of the Th1-promoting
cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ. These effects on
enhanced cytokine production could be blocked by the
addition of an antagonistic CD40 antibody, confirming
the requirement of the CD40-CD40L interaction per se in
this phenomenon. It is interesting that another group
found that IFN-γ treatment of microglia promotes APC
function of these cells when they are challenged with Aβ
[82]. Thus, it seems that when microglia encounter Aβ in
the context of co-simulation (e.g., CD40L), their activation phenotype is biased away from innate, phagocytic
activation and towards adaptive, APC function.

behavioral testing in AD mice [86,87]. Thus, in mouse
models of AD, innate (phagocytic) microglial activation
mediated by the Fc receptor in the presence of antibodyopsonized Aβ appears beneficial rather than deleterious.

responses
Model for innate versus adaptive microglial activation
Model for innate versus adaptive microglial activation
responses. In the context of β-amyloid challenge, microglia
activate a phagocytic response. If co-stimulated with CD40
ligand, a shift from innate activation to adaptive antigen-presenting cell response ensues. Additionally, certain anti-inflammatory Th2-type cytokines shift this balance back towards
innate phagocytic response, while some pro-inflammatory
Th1-associated cytokines tip the balance further towards
adaptive activation of microglia. See the text and Table 1 for
references. Abbreviations used: APC, antigen presenting cell;
CD40L, CD40 ligand; Th1, CD4+ T helper cell type I
response; Th2, Th type II response; TGF, transforming
growth factor; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon, TNF, tumor
necrosis factor.

Microglial activation in Alzheimer disease
immunotherapy: differences between mice and
men
In a seminal report, Schenk and colleagues showed that
peripheral immunization of the PDAPP mouse model of
AD with Aβ1–42 peptide resulted in high antibody titers, a
small fraction of which (0.1%, [83]) crossed the bloodbrain-barrier and entered the brain parenchyma [84].
Most importantly, these authors found that Aβ1–42 vaccination markedly diminished β-amyloid plaque burden
[84]. These authors also found evidence of cells in the
brains of the Aβ1–42 immunized animals that contained
Aβ. Many of these cells stained for the activated microglia
marker MHC II and phenotypically resembled activated
microglia, suggesting that these cells were able to phagocytose Aβ deposits. In a follow-up report, Bard and colleagues supported this hypothesis by showing ex vivo that
certain antibodies against Aβ peptides could trigger microglial phagocytosis and subsequent clearance of Aβ
through the Fc receptor [83-85]. Clearance of brain amyloid-β deposits was beneficial, as Aβ1–42-vaccinated mice
had markedly reduced cognitive impairment as assayed by

Based on the above-mentioned data, a human clinical
trial was begun to peripherally administer a synthetic Aβ1–
42 peptide (AN-1792) with an adjuvant to AD patients.
Unfortunately, the trial was halted when a small percentage of patients developed aseptic T cell meningoencephalitis. This response most likely occurred because of an
immune reaction to Aβ mediated by infiltrating T cells
[88]. In the post-mortem brain of one patient who died as
a consequence of this side-effect of treatment, there was
significant clearance of Aβ plaques in parts of the neocortex and, in other areas where plaques remained, Aβimmunoreactivity was associated with microglia [89]. It is
not yet clear whether this fulminate infiltration of T cells
in AD patients who developed aseptic T cell meningoencephalitis was due to adaptive activation of microglia, but
this is a distinct possibility given that microglia did seem
to recognize antibody-opsonized Aβ [89,90]. These results
indicate the potentially damaging and overwhelming
effects of a full-blown T cell autoimmune response, which
does not normally occur in AD, and which may have been
mediated by adaptively activated microglia.

Conclusion
Accumulating evidence has revealed that microglial "activation" is not simply one phenotypic manifestation. Here,
we suggest a model wherein microglial cells exist in at
least two functionally discernable states once "activated",
namely a phagocytic phenotype (innate activation) or an
antigen presenting phenotype (adaptive activation), as
governed by their stimulatory environment. When challenged with certain PAMPs (particularly CpG-DNA),
murine microglia seem to activate a "mixed" response
characterized by enhanced phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production as well as adaptive activation
of T cells. In the EAE model, murine microglia seem to
largely support an adaptive activation of encephalitogenic
T cells in the presence of the CD40-CD40 ligand interaction. In the context of Aβ challenge, CD40 ligation is able
to shift activated microglia from innate to adaptive activation. Further, it seems that the cytokine milieu that microglia are exposed to biases these cells to innate activation
(i.e., anti-inflammatory Th2-associated cytokines such as
IL-4, IL-10, and perhaps TGF-β1) or an adaptive form of
activation (i.e., pro-inflammatory Th1-associated
cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α; summarized in
Fig. 2). Not all forms of microglial activation are deleterious, as activated microglia may serve a protective role as
was shown in Aβ1–42-immunized mouse models of AD. It
seems that enhanced microglial phagocytosis of β-amyloid plaques is at least partly responsible for the therapeu-

tic benefit in these animals, so perhaps stimulation of
innate microglial activation contributes to these reported
benefits. In conclusion, if we can learn how to better harness microglia in order to produce specific forms of microglial activation, this could be key in turning a pathogenic
cell into a therapeutic modality.
