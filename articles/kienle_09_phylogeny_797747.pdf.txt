Abstract
Background: In eukaryotic cells, directional transport between different compartments of the
endomembrane system is mediated by vesicles that bud from a donor organelle and then fuse with
an acceptor organelle. A family of integral membrane proteins, termed soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins, constitute the key machineries of these
different membrane fusion events. Over the past 30 years, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has
served as a powerful model organism for studying the organization of the secretory and endocytic
pathways, and a few years ago, its entire set of SNAREs was compiled.
Results: Here, we make use of the increasing amount of genomic data to investigate the history
of the SNARE family during fungi evolution. Moreover, since different SNARE family members are
thought to demarcate different organelles and vesicles, this approach allowed us to compare the
organization of the endomembrane systems of yeast and animal cells. Our data corroborate the
notion that fungi generally encompass a relatively simple set of SNARE proteins, mostly comprising
the SNAREs of the proto-eukaryotic cell. However, all fungi contain a novel soluble SNARE
protein, Vam7, which carries an N-terminal PX-domain that acts as a phosphoinositide binding
module. In addition, the points in fungal evolution, at which lineage-specific duplications and
diversifications occurred, could be determined. For instance, the endosomal syntaxins Pep12 and
Vam3 arose from a gene duplication that occurred within the Saccharomycotina clade.
Conclusion: Although the SNARE repertoire of baker's yeast is highly conserved, our analysis
reveals that it is more deviated than the ones of basal fungi. This highlights that the trafficking
pathways of baker's yeast are not only different to those in animal cells but also are somewhat
different to those of many other fungi.

Background
Over the last decades, the organization of the secretory
and endocytic pathways has been studied in a variety of
different eukaryotic organisms. These studies have
revealed that the principal organization of the endomembrane system and the molecular machineries involved in

vesicular trafficking are conserved among all eukaryotes.
In general, the transport between different intracellular
organelles is mediated by cargo-laden vesicles that bud
from a donor and then specifically fuse with an acceptor
compartment. Key players during the final fusion step are
the so-called SNARE proteins. These proteins are a large

family of small cytoplasmically orientated membrane
proteins that are typically tail-anchored. Their key characteristic is the so-called SNARE domain, an extended
stretch of heptad repeats that is usually connected to a single transmembrane domain by a short linker. SNARE
domains of heterologous sets of SNARE proteins have the
ability to assemble into tight, parallel four-helix bundle
complexes. It is thought that complex formation between
SNARE proteins from opposing membranes provide the
energy that drives membrane fusion (reviewed in [1-4],
Fig. 1A &1B).
Although the concept of SNARE-mediated membrane
fusion emerged in the 1990s [5-7], several SNARE proteins had been discovered earlier. The field of membrane
trafficking was greatly inspired by ingenious genetic
screens in the single-cell fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae for
mutants with defects in the secretory pathway in the late
1970s [8,9]. In these mutants, secretion was blocked at
higher temperatures. These so-called SEC mutants accumulate secretory proteins at the point in the secretory
pathway that is blocked and often, they could be distinguished by their phenotype. In the following years, it
became clear that SEC genes generally encode for key
components of the machineries that mediate trafficking of
a transport vesicle, including a few SNARE proteins. All at
once, straightforward genetic tools had catapulted baker's
yeast to the front row for studying vesicle trafficking pathways. In fact, other genetic screens for mutants showing
defects in other transport processes (reviewed in [10-13])
have turned up novel yeast SNAREs. The last yeast SNARE
was tracked down in 2003, yielding an overall repertoire
of 24 different SNARE genes in baker's yeast [14] [see
Additional file 1]. For most trafficking steps in baker's
yeast, distinct units of four interacting SNARE domains
have now been assigned ([1,2,14,15], Fig. 1C). However,
not all details of the trafficking routes in yeast are
resolved. Generally, different SNARE family members are
localized on distinct organelles and vesicles that demarcate particular membranes. However, it is becoming clear
that some trafficking steps cannot be identified by a
unique set of SNAREs, since some SNAREs are involved in
more than one trafficking step. In addition, they may participate in different SNARE complexes (for a discussion,
see [16,17]). To appraise S. cerevisiae as model organism
for studying vesicle trafficking pathways better, it is also
necessary to understand the limits of the organism, since
baker's yeast appears to be a secondarily reduced organism. For example, S. cerevisiae has only a limited ability to
produce hyphae (long branching multicellular filaments).
The capability to produce polarized hyphae, however, is a
hallmark of the fungal kingdom, allowing them to colonize and exploit new substrates efficiently. In addition,
whereas most fungi are multicellular organisms, S. cerevi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

siae most of the times grows as single cells that reproduce
asexually. It thus seems possible that adaptation to a relatively simple lifestyle was accompanied by a degeneration
of the intracellular trafficking itinerary together with the
involved machineries.
A comparison of the SNARE gene repertoires of S. cerevisiae with that of five other fungal species, including three
species of filamentous fungi, revealed that, in general, the
members of the SNARE family are largely conserved in
fungi [18]. This notion has been corroborated by subsequent inspections of the SNARE repertoire of few other
fungal species [19,20]. Together, these studies put forward
that the yeast lifestyle did not entail a radical change in the
intracellular trafficking pathways. The bioinformatic strategies used to identify the homologs of the yeast SNAREs,
however, did not provide a universal classification
scheme. Consequently, it was impossible to compare the
SNARE sets of different fungi with each other in an unambiguous manner, let alone comparing them with SNARE
sets from other eukaryotes like animals. Hence it remains
unclear whether SNARE types, which are possibly linked
to a novel transport step, evolved or degenerated in particular fungal lineages.
Fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals
than to plants and, currently, are placed with animals and
several protistan taxa into the monophyletic group of
Opisthokonta. Notably, morphological observations
show that the appearance of analogous intracellular
organelles such as the vacuoles/lysosomes and the Golgi
apparatus are markedly different between yeast and animal cells. It is unclear, however, whether these differences
are reflected in their respective SNARE inventory.
Recently, using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) we have
established a precise classification for all eukaryotic
SNARE proteins [21]. Based on this classification, we were
able to deduce that the emergence of multicellularity in
animals went along with an expansion of the set of SNARE
proteins, in particular the expansion of the SNAREs
involved in endosomal trafficking [22].
In order to analyze the differences between the SNARE
repertoires of fungi and animals and the evolutionary
changes in the SNARE inventory of different fungal lineages, we have collected and classified the SNAREs from a
broad range of different fungi according to our HMMs,
making use of the substantial number of available
genomic sequences. To identify specification and duplication events, and to pinpoint the differences between the
set of SNARE proteins in fungi and animals, we used phylogenetic information to reveal the history of SNARE
genes. Afterwards, we mapped features of the fungal
SNARE evolution onto the species tree.

Figure proteins are key factors in vesicle trafficking in yeast
SNARE 1
SNARE proteins are key factors in vesicle trafficking in yeast. A) Current model of the role of SNARE proteins in vesicle fusion. Heterologous sets of SNARE proteins, here exemplified by the secretory set of SNAREs, assemble in a zipper-like
fashion into tight complexes between two membranes, in effect initiating fusion. B) Architecture of the archetypical four-helix
bundle SNARE complex structure [91]. The structure of the neuronal SNARE complex is shown as ribbon diagram on the left
(blue, red and green for synaptobrevin 2, syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25a, respectively). The layers in the core are indicated by virtual bonds between the corresponding C7 positions. The structure of the central 0-layer is shown in detail on the right [91].
According to this unusual hydrophilic layer in the center of the complex, SNAREs have been categorized as either Q- or RSNAREs depending on whether they contribute a conserved glutamine or arginine, respectively, to this layer. The three QSNAREs are further subdivided into Qa-, Qb- and Qc-SNAREs based on the other sequences of their SNARE domains. These
four basic types correspond to the four different helices of the canonical SNARE complex architecture [91-94]. Hence, functional complexes are composed of four different helices, each belonging to one of the four main groups ("QabcR" composition)
[21,40,74,95,96]. C) Schematic outline of the vesicle trafficking pathways and tentative assignement of the involved sets of
SNARE proteins of baker's yeast. It should be kept in mind, however, that the assignment of some SNAREs to certain trafficking steps, in particular of the R-SNAREs, is still debated. Note that baker's yeast has two endosomal syntaxins, Pep12 and
Vam3, that are thought to be involved in consecutive trafficking steps towards the vacuole, whereas other fungi only have one.

Methods
Sequences
Recently, we published a classification for SNARE
sequences, based on more than 2000 protein sequences
from 145 eukaryotic species, including 718 sequences
from 51 species of fungi. We were able to identify twenty
basic subtypes within the SNARE protein family and
developed specific as well as sensitive HMMs for each subtype [21,23]. We used these models to identify SNARE
proteins in fungal genomes that became available
recently. The models yielded 1221 additional sequences
from the nr-database at NCBI and various genome
projects (DOE Joint Genome Institute), Baylor College of
Medicine, J. Craig Venter Institute and Broad Institute)
and several EST databases (NCBI Expressed Sequence Tags
database, Fungal Genomics Project, and Taxonomical
Broad EST Database) [24]. The newly found protein
sequences underwent a visual verification process to
remove redundancy and misassembled sequences. Overall, our data contained 1536 unique SNARE sequences
from 123 fungal species. The dataset was incorporated
into the SNARE database [21] and can be accessed on the
project homepage http://bioinformatics.mpibpc.mpg.de/
snare/. The SNARE sets of all fungal species with complete
genomes sequenced can be found in [Additional file 2].

For a more detailed inspection of the evolutionary
changes within fungi, we made use of the observation that
within a subtype, sequence regions besides the SNARE
motif were also well conserved. Consequently, we constructed alignments of the entire sequences for each subgroup using muscle [25]. Sites with more than 25 percent
gaps were removed from the alignments. In addition, we
excluded all sequences which contained more than 50
percent gaps. These alignments are also available via the
supplementary section of our projects homepage. Based
on these alignments, we constructed phylogenetic trees
for each of the fungal SNAREs [see Additional file 3]. We
also generated sequence alignments in which we graphically incorporated information about the domain structure based on the available high resolution structure
information [see Additional file 4].
Phylogeny
The phylogenetic reconstruction was composed of two
different analytical approaches and was basically done as
described in [21]. The first approach used IQPNNI
(Important Quartet Puzzling and Nearest Neighbor Interchange) [26] to construct phylogenetic trees from the
curated alignments. We used a gamma distribution as a
model for rate heterogeneity with four rate categories for
the estimation of the gamma distribution parameter. The
proportion of invariable sites was estimated from the data
and the Jones, Taylor and Thornton (JTT-) distance matrix
[27] served as a substitution matrix. We used the stopping
rule of IQPNNI, but the calculation had to run for at least

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

the suggested number of iterations. The default values
were used for the remaining parameter. In addition, Likelihood-Mapping was applied to determine the confidence
of the edges in the calculated trees. The second approach
used the phylip package [28] to apply a distance-based
bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates to each of the
curated alignments. Standard settings were used for seqboot, the JTT distance matrix and also a gamma distribution (with parameter approximation from tree-puzzle) for
protdist, as were standard options for neighbour. If
required, the random seed was set to nine. We used the
almost unbiased (AU) test [29] to address the systematically biased bootstrap values. We obtained the sitewise
log-likelihoods needed for the AU test using a modified
version of phyml [30] and the test was performed using
consel [31]. The reconstructed IQPNNI trees served as
starting points to join the results of both calculations. The
inner edges of the trees were labeled with their Likelihood-Mapping and corrected bootstrap support values.
We provide Nexus files for each reconstructed tree on our
project homepage [see Additional file 3]. The trees can be
interactively explored using, for example, SplitsTree 4
[32].
To gain initial insights on the placement of fungi within
the Opisthokonta, especially the basal fungal species Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Blastocladiella emersonii, we
first performed an extensive phylogenetic analysis based
only on the sequence of the SNARE domain. This analysis
was carried out to ensure that the evolutionary history of
the individual SNARE groups indeed reflects the monophyletic origin of fungi. For this analysis, we used all fungal species together with the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, and ten
selected animal species [see Additional file 5]. We also
included the SNAREs found in the animal pathogen
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, which belongs to the Microsporidia. In earlier times, this clade was considered to be
of protist origin, but it is now believed to have diverged
from early fungi. However, we purposefully did not
include their sequences into the general phylogenetic
analysis, as E. cuniculi appears to have a markedly reduced
set of SNARE proteins [21] with clearly deviating
sequences, making them sensitive to long branching artefacts. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees demonstrate
that fungi (including the basal species) are well separated
from other opisthokonts (the phylogenetic trees can be
downloaded from our projects homepage). With this corroborated, we then performed a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of the SNAREs in fungi using the entire
sequence.

Results and discussion
In order to catalog the SNARE inventory of fungi, we
increased our previous collection [21] with newly published genomes, and complemented this set with ESTs
Page 4 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:19

from different fungal species, obtaining an overall set of
more than 1500 SNARE sequences from 123 fungal species. The dataset comprises about 70 species with nearly
complete sets of SNAREs [see Additional file 2]. All
sequences and species used in this study can also be found
in our SNARE database on our projects homepage http://
bioinformatics.mpibpc.mpg.de/snare/. The collected
sequences were then classified according to our previously
established HMM models [21] that are based only on the
highly conserved SNARE motif. The four main classes
were then further subdivided into twenty distinct groups
according to our HMM models. Each of these subgroups
represents a distinct conserved trafficking step. For phylogenetic analysis of the fungal lineage, we aligned entire
sequences for each subgroup, as evolutionary changes
have usually occurred by paralogous expansion of particular SNARE types. Based on these alignments, we constructed phylogenetic trees for each of the SNARE types in
fungi [see Additional file 3].
Fungi contain a compact set of SNARE proteins
Overall, the fungal genomes examined in this work comprise a remarkably consistent and homologous set of
SNARE proteins. In each species with a complete genome,
we only found a little more than twenty different SNAREs,
whereas in metazoans, for example species with more
than 30 SNAREs are common. A marked expansion of the
metazoan set of SNAREs occurred during the rise of multicellularity [22]. In earlier studies it was put forward that
the development of multicellularity is generally linked to
an expansion of the SNAREs [33-35]. In contrast to this
idea, we usually only found members of the basic SNARE
proteins to be present in each fungi species. This implies
that fungi, although they also have evolved multicellularity, have a relatively unchanged set of SNAREs and have
not significantly expanded the repertoire of the protoeukaryotic cell.

It was not the objective of the present study to discuss the
function of each SNARE protein coded for in fungal
genomes in detail, as the sequence information alone is
insufficient for recognizing the exact trafficking step the
protein is involved in [see Additional file 6]. Instead, we
will mainly focus on highlighting the idiosyncrasies that
we came across. Notably, the SNARE proteins involved in
secretory trafficking routes between the endoplasmatic
reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus (GA) and the transGolgi network (TGN) were generally present as singletons
and were highly conserved in all fungi. Noticeable
changes affected the set of SNARE proteins involved in
secretion and in the endosomal/vacuolar trafficking pathway.
An interesting observation is that the set of SNARE proteins in fungi is very similar to the set of the single-cell

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, which is thought to
be closely related to animals. In contrast to M. brevicollis,
lower animals possess an enlarged set of SNARE proteins
[22]. A surprising aspect of the chytrids Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis and Blastocladiella emersonii is that they possess a SNARE that was classified as Qb.III.d-type [21].
SNAREs belonging to this subclass were first found in
green plants and termed novel plant SNAREs (Npsn) [36].
Our previous analysis had shown that Npsn can be found
in plants and several protist lineages, but not in choanoflagellates and animals [21]. The fact that basal fungi
retained a bona fide Npsn suggests that late-diverging fungi
have lost Npsn independently. Interestingly, the chytrids
are the most primitive of the fungi; many are aquatic and
possess a flagellum. Consistent with their more basal
position, sequences from the chytrids Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis and Blastocladiella emersonii are usually
placed close to the root of the fungal lineage in our analysis. These results suggest that Npsn was a member of the
original SNARE repertoire of the eukaryotic cenancestor
but was then lost in the choanoflagellate/animal and the
fungal lineage.
Another protein family has been widely used as a marker
for the different trafficking steps of the endomembrane
system. These are Rab proteins, a family of small GTPbinding proteins that regulate different vesicular trafficking steps by cycling between active GTP and inactive GDP
forms [37,38]. It has been observed that fungi contain a
relatively small number of Rab proteins [39], whereas
their number has expanded in several other lineages such
as animals [37,40], land plants[41], and some protists
[42-45]. It would therefore be interesting to investigate
whether the pattern of duplications and diversifications
found for the Rab family in fungi [39] correlates with that
of the SNARE family [22].
The SNARE protein Vam7 is a molecular "invention" of
fungi
Our analysis shows that fungi contain three different
SNAREs of the Qc.III-type: Tlg1, syntaxin 8 (Syx8) and
Vam7 [46-49]. The choanoflagellate M. brevicollis and
basal animals contain only two Qc.III-SNAREs, Syx6 and
Syx8, which are homologous to Tlg1 and Syx8, respectively. Remarkably, we found Vam7 homologs to be
present in all complete fungal genomes, even in the basal
fungus B. dendrobatidis. However, no Vam7 homolog was
discovered in other eukaryotes, suggesting that the Qc.IIISNARE Vam7 is a new innovation in fungi. Of note, this
status of Vam7 had been recognized earlier by Yoshizawa
and colleagues [19]. However, one should keep in mind
that their analysis was based on an inferior cluster
approach that led, from a biological point of view, to a
number of wrongly assigned clusters. In addition, they
have missed several well-known SNARE proteins.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:19

Although the SNARE motif of Vam7 is not greatly
diverged, it remains unclear whether an ancestral Tlg1 or
Syx8 gave rise to Vam7. Nonetheless, considering its
unique domain structure, Vam7 is the most divergent
SNARE protein in the repertoire of fungi. In contrast to
most other SNARE proteins, Vam7 does not carry a transmembrane region at the C-terminal end of its SNARE
motif. Instead, the protein seems to be anchored to a
membrane by means of an N-terminal extension that harbors a Phox homology (PX) domain, which acts as phosphoinositide binding module. In fact, Vam7 has been
shown to interact specifically with phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate (PI(3)P) [50], a lipid that is specific for
endosomal and vacuolar membranes. A large body of
work carried out in yeast implies that Vam7 catalyzes
homotypic vacuole fusion with its partner SNAREs, Vam3
(Qa.III.b), Vti1 (Qb.III.b) and Nyv1 (R.III) [11,13]. Interestingly, however, the homologous factor in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, termed yup1, was found to be
present on vacuoles and rapidly moving endosomal
organelles. Moreover, a temperature sensitive mutation in
yup1 blocks sorting to vacuoles and a defect in endosomal
recycling [51-53] suggests that the function of Vam7 is not
restricted to homotypic vacuole fusion, a process that, as
we will discuss below, may be restricted to Saccharomycotina.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

William Wickner and colleagues [11,13] to study the role
of SNAREs and other factors in the fusion process. This
process, however, does not take place in, for example, S.
pombe, a yeast that recently was proposed to belong to a
third ascomycetes class, the Archiascomycotina [57]. This
suggests that homotypic vacuole fusion, described first in
baker's yeast, is a process specific to hemiascomycetes.
Notably, the two Qa.III.b-SNAREs of Yarrowia lipolytica are
much less diverged. Consequently, it seems interesting to
find out at which point in the evolution of the Saccharomycotina lineage the process of homotypic vacuole fusion
evolved. In addition, the sets of proteins catalyzing trafficking to the vacuole (VPS genes) and maintaining a low
vacuole copy number (VAM) genes have only partial functional overlap [11,12]. It would thus be interesting to
investigate whether the factors specifically involved in the
process of homotypic vacuole fusion are restricted to the
Saccharomycotina.

Changes in the endosomal and vacuolar set of SNARE
proteins in Saccharomycotina
The yeast S. cerevisiae belongs to the Saccharomycotina
clade, the members of which are sometimes referred to as
hemiascomycetes. S. cerevisiae possesses two endosomal
syntaxins (Qa.III.b-type), Pep12 and Vam3, which are
believed to be involved in trafficking to late endosomes
and to vacuoles, respectively. In agreement with the earlier
assessment by Gupta and Heath [18], our phylogenetic
tree shows that these two SNAREs have been duplicated in
the lineage of Saccharomycotina only (Fig. 2A). In addition, our analysis also demonstrates that the duplication
of ancestral Qa.III.b-SNARE into Pep12 and Vam3 is independent of the duplications of the endosomal syntaxins
in animals, i.e. syntaxin 7, syntaxin 13, syntaxin 17 and
syntaxin 20.

Previously, it has been debated whether the R-SNARE
involved in trafficking towards vacuoles in yeast, Nyv1, is
indeed homologous to the animal R-SNARE Vamp7 (also
referred to as TI-Vamp). In fact, the SNARE motif of Nyv1
from baker's yeast is only distantly related to Vamp7 in
animals [58,59]; however, in our analysis, both clearly fall
into the same group (R.III). It has even been thought that
Nyv1 does not contain a canonical profilin-like N-terminal extension, often also referred to as longin domain
[58,59]. A recent structural analysis has demonstrated that
the N-terminal extension of Nyv1 indeed contains a profilin-like fold of this type [60], similar to the ones found
in Sec22 (R.I) [61] and Ykt6 (R.II) [62]. In general, all
fungi possess a Nyv1 homolog. The only fungal lineages
that do not appear to contain a Nyv1 homolog are members of Schizosaccharomyces (S. pombe and S. japonicus).
Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Nyv1 sequences are
remarkably derived in Saccharomycetales, bringing to
light why it has been difficult before to acknowledge Nyv1
as a bona fide endosomal R-SNARE. In S. cerevisiae, Nyv1
seems to interact only with the Q.III.b-type syntaxin Vam3
but not with Pep12, which is thought to interact preferentially with the R-SNARE Ykt6. Hence, it seems possible
that Nyv1 and Vam3 coevolved in Saccharomycotina.

The bifurcation of an ancestral endosomal syntaxin
within the Saccharomycotina clade into proteins with distinct roles, namely Pep12 and Vam3, may suggest that the
specialized machinery involved in homotypic vacuole
fusion arose only within the hemiascomycetes. Homotypic vacuole fusion is a process that occurs during cell
division in baker's yeast. During budding, the few large
vacuoles maintained in S. cerevisiae are fragmented. Multiple small vacuoles then segregate into the budding
daughter cell and subsequently fuse again into larger vacuoles [54-56]. This phenomenon has been exploited by

The larger set of secretory SNAREs in S. cerevisiae can be
attributed to a whole genome duplication
In contrast to the notion that baker's yeast is a reduced
organism, no fungal genome inspected contained more
SNARE genes than S. cerevisiae with its 26 different SNARE
factors (this count includes the regulatory SNARE proteins
Sro7 and Sro77). These 26 genes are clearly more than the
20/21 genuine SNAREs of the proto-eukaryotic cell. Two
of the added SNAREs Vam7, a novel, fungi-specific
SNARE, and Vam3, a Saccharomycotina-specific SNARE
were discussed above. In addition, baker's yeast contains

Unrooted phylogenetic trees highlighting events of gene duplication and diversification in fungi
Figure 2
Unrooted phylogenetic trees highlighting events of gene duplication and diversification in fungi. A) The endosomal Qa-SNAREs (Qa.III.b-type) of fungi split into two major branches, Pep12 and Vam3, within the Saccharomycotina. The
syntaxin involved in trafficking towards the TGN, Tlg2 (Qa.III.a-type) is shown as outgroup. B) The phylogenetic tree of secretory syntaxins (Qa.IV-type) reveals independent expansions in Pezizomycotina and in the Saccharomyces senso-stricto clade. The
latter expansion probably occurred during a whole-genome duplication, during which the other secretory SNAREs were duplicated as well. Note that independent duplications of Sso genes occurred in other lineages as well. In each tree, the diverged
SNARE types are shown by different colors. In addition, the major phylogenetic groups of fungi are indicated. The labels on the
major branches represent the Likelihood Mapping (left) and AU support values (right).

four closely related pairs of secretory SNARE proteins,
Sso1 and Sso2 (Qa.IV), Snc1 and Snc2 (R.IV), Sec9 and
Spo20 (Qbc.IV), and Sro7 and Sro77 (R.Reg). Our analysis demonstrates that these doubled set of secretory factors
very probably arose from a well established whole
genome duplication (WGD) in S. cerevisiae [57,63].
Indeed, we found the same duplicated set of SNARE proteins in the closely related species S. paradoxus, S. mikatae,
S. bayanus and S. kudriavzevii, all of which are collectively
referred to as Saccharomyces senso-stricto species (Fig. 2B).
Remarkably, some but not all of the same secretory
SNARE genes were also found in duplicates in S. castellii,
Candida glabrata, and Vanderwaltozyma polyspora (synonym Kluyveromyces polysporus). The ancestor of this group
of species (referred to as Saccharomyces senso-lato) and of
the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species are believed to have
undergone the same WGD followed by major secondary
reductions, while several closely related species like Eremothecium gossypii (synonym Ashbya gossypii), Kluyveromyces waltii, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Saccharomyces kluyveri
have kept a single copy of the genome. These species are
grouped with the ones that underwent a WGD as, "Saccharomyces complex"[64]. Indeed, we found only one copy of
each of the secretory SNAREs in the latter species. Interestingly, the duplicates found in S. castellii, C. glabrata and V.
polyspora usually split at clearly different positions in our
phylogenetic trees as compared to the duplicates of the
Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. This is particularly
noticeable for the two Sec9 proteins from S. castellii and
also from V. polyspora that are highly similar, whereas the
two Qbc-SNAREs, Sec9 and Spo20, exhibit marked asymmetrical rates of evolution in the Saccharomyces sensu
stricto species, pointing to a different fate of the duplicated
secretory SNAREs in the two lineages. Similarly, the two
Sso proteins of C. glabrata are clearly more diverged than
the duplicated set of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species.
In fact, it has been proposed that these lineages must have
diverged and adapted to different living conditions very
soon after the WGD, so that the genes retained in duplicates diverged largely independently [65].
Although only about 14% of all duplicated genes were
retained after the WGD, all duplicated SNARE genes are
involved in the process of secretion in baker's yeast. This
suggests that these factors presented a selective advantage
for yeast. The selective advantage of the duplicated secretory set is not entirely clear, since so far, only subtle functional differences of the duplicated SNAREs have been
found. As mentioned above, only one homologous pair,
the two Qbc-SNAREs (i.e. SNAP-25 related factors, Sec9
and Spo20) is highly diverged in the Saccharomyces sensustricto species. Sec9 and Spo20 possess only approximately
37% identity, whereas the homologs of the secretory syntaxins (Sso1 and Sso2) and R-SNAREs (Snc1 and Snc2) are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

79% and 74% identical, respectively. Whereas Sec9, particularly in Saccharomycotina, possesses a rather long Nterminal extension, this region was reduced in Spo20
[66]. Interestingly, Sec9 and Spo20 are specialized to different developmental stages in baker's yeast. Whereas Sec9
interacts with both secretory syntaxins and synaptobrevins in secretion during vegetative growth, the more deviated Spo20 is required only for sporulation. During
sporulation in S. cerevisiae, the prospore membrane,
which envelops each daughter nucleus during meiosis, is
generated de novo adjacent to the spindle pole bodies by
the secretory SNARE machinery [67]. Nevertheless, Sec9
and Spo20 show some partial functional redundancy during sporulation, because only the SPO20/SEC9 double
mutants exhibit a complete loss of prospore membranes,
while SPO20 mutants show a milder sporulation phenotype and SEC9 mutants have no sporulation phenotype
[66-68]. Furthermore, the two secretory syntaxins Sso1
and Sso2 seem to have some functional differences,
because only Sso1 seems to be necessary during sporulation [69,70].
Degeneration of the tomosyn SNARE motif in
Saccharomycotina
In our previous study, we established that tomosyn
(R.Reg), a regulatory R-SNARE without a membrane
anchor, is a member of the basic SNARE repertoire of the
proto-eukaryotic cell. Structural studies on the yeast
tomosyn homolog, Sro7, have demonstrated that this factor carries a large N-terminal domain composed of two
consecutive seven-bladed β-propeller domains [71]. However, tomosyn cannot serve as a fusogenic R-SNARE
because it does not have a transmembrane anchor at its Cterminal end [72-75]. In a molecular process that is not
completely understood to date, tomosyn is believed to
function in establishing polarized secretion by controlling
the accessibility of the t-SNAREs acceptor complexes [71].
As mentioned above, in baker's yeast, two close homologs
of tomosyn exist, Sro7 and Sro77 (55% identity) [76].
They are often confused with the factor Lethal giant larvae
(Lgl), which has a function in establishing epithelial cell
polarity in animals [77,78]. The main basis for this confusion is that Sro7 and Sro77, like Lgl, do not possess the
canonical R-SNARE motif found in tomosyns. In fact, Lgl
derived independently from tomosyn in animals [75,79],
where it lost its SNARE domain [22]. Interestingly, the
canonical R-SNARE motif of tomosyn is present in other
fungal tomosyns [75,79]. Our current analysis demonstrates that the R-SNARE motif degenerated in the Saccharomycetales clade.
Two markedly diverged secretory syntaxins within
Pezizomycotina
Our analysis also demonstrates that secretory SNAREs, in
particular the secretory syntaxin (Sso, Qa.IV), have been

Page 8 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:19

duplicated recurrently in several fungal lineages, but no
clear pattern between duplications and lifestyle or taxonomical grouping has been detected. Usually, duplicated
SNAREs are not very greatly diverged in fungi. However, as
Gupta and Heath have already had pointed out, the sodariomycete Neurospora crassa contains two clearly diverged
secretory syntaxins, nsyn1 and nsyn2 [18,80]. A similar set
of diverged secretory syntaxins has been described
recently in Trichoderma reesei [81], which also belongs to
the Pezizomycotina. The Pezizomycotina are filamentous
fungi, which are sometimes also called euascomycetes.
Besides the Saccharomycotina, they are the second major
subphylum of the Ascomycotina, which are defined by the
production of a specialized structure, the ascus, that surrounds the meiotic spores. Most Pezizomycotina species
are hyphal fungi. Hyphae grow at their tips, a process that
involves highly polarized secretion of cell wall material.
The two syntaxins of T. reesei, Sso1 and Sso2, were found
to be involved in different secretory processes. Whereas
Sso2 was found in the apical compartments of actively
growing hyphae, Sso1 was found in older, non-growing
hyphae. In vivo FRET studies also suggest that the two proteins exert their secretory function at spatially segregated
areas of the plasma membrane [81]. Our analysis now
shows that two diverged secretory syntaxins in N. crassa
and T. reesei represent a split that arose within the lineage
of Pezizomycotina (Fig. 2B).
Notably, some species of the Eurotiomycetes, a lineage of
the Pezizomycotina including the genus Aspergillus, only
possess one Sso, suggesting that their lineage split before
the duplication of secretory syntaxins [82]. Some Aspergillus species, A. oryzae and A. flavus, do possess two different
secretory syntaxins. However, this duplication appears to
have occurred independently within the Eurotiomycetes.
In order to avoid confusion between the well-known
duplicated set of secretory syntaxins in S. cerevisiae (Sso1
and Sso2) we suggest to name these two clearly diverged
secretory syntaxins in Pezizomycotina SsoA and SsoB.
We noted that the duplication of the secretory syntaxin
was not accompanied by a duplication of the interacting
SNARE partners of Sso, Snc and Sec9. These usually exist
only as one copy in the respective species of Pezizomycotina, suggesting that, as shown for T. reesei [81], Snc and
Sec9 can interact with two different syntaxins. Interestingly, Sec9 in a few Sodariomycetes, namely Magnaporthe
grisea, Neurospora crassa, Podospora anserina and Chaetomium globosum, is clearly diverged.
SNAREs recapitulate the phylogeny of fungi
Multi-gene phylogenetic studies have started to change
our view of the phylogenetic relationships within the
fungi kingdom. In particular, the clades generated by
those studies [57,63,64,82-86] differ markedly from pre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

vious classifications of yeasts that were usually defined
mostly by morphological analysis and growth responses.
We have already noted that the individual gene trees built
from orthologous SNAREs generally recapitulate the
newer classification. In fact, the sequences of species that
belong to the same clade usually congregate in the individual trees. This indicates that SNARE proteins have
diversified only slowly during evolution, but fast enough
to reflect species evolution within the fungi kingdom. For
a better resolution of species evolution, we concatenated
the SNARE sequences that are present as singletons. The
resulting phylogenetic tree agrees very well with the
recently refined classification of the major fungal lineages
(Fig. 3). The tree clearly resolves the major fungi phyla
Basidiomycotina and Ascomycotina. The latter clearly
split into two major subphyla, the Pezizomycotina and
the Saccharomycotina, whereas the two schizosaccharomyces species sit outside the subphyla clades. Our data
corroborate the notion that within the Pezizomycotina,
the Eurotiomycetidae split first. As discussed above, the
Eurotiomycetidae possess only one secretory syntaxin,
Sso, whereas we found two clearly diverged Sso sequences
in all other Pezizomycotina, suggesting that this trait
emerged after the split of the Eurotiomycetidae. Within
the Saccharomycotina, two major clusters were observed,
one being the Candida clade, which comprises the organisms that translate the codon CTG as serine instead of leucine [87,88] and the other being the Saccharomyces
complex mentioned above. Generally, these two clusters
are clearly separated in all individual trees built from
orthologous SNAREs, whereas Yarrowia lipolytica, as the
sole sequenced member of a third cluster of the Saccharomycotina, splits earlier. Furthermore, our analysis sheds
some initial light on the evolutionary position of the few
basal fungi available. The concatenated tree includes the
two Mucoromycotina, Rhizopus oryzae and Phycomyces
blakesleeanus, and the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, all of which are clearly separated from Basidiomycotina.

Conclusion
Our study confirms that fungi, in contrast to animals and
green plants [19,21,34,35,40], generally possess a relatively simple set of SNARE proteins with only minimal
variation between different lineages. In addition, our
analysis reveals that single-cell yeasts, by and large, did
not reduce their primordial set of SNARE proteins, suggesting that they have maintained the basic transport
pathways of the proto-eukaryotic cell. In fact, one can
observe quite the contrary: for example, the hemiascomycete S. cerevisiae has gained a few additional SNAREs
during evolution. Taken together, these points imply that
a basic set of membrane fusion proteins is able to sustain
and is necessary for the lifestyle of multicellular fungi as
well as of single-cell yeasts. Hence, multicellularity per se

does not need an expansion of the repertoire of SNARE
proteins.
Moreover, the SNAREs of hemiascomycetes are often
more deviated than the ones of basal fungi. These facts
highlight that the trafficking pathways of baker's yeast are
not only different to those in animal cells but also are different to those of many other fungi. Since the extent of the
differences is unknown to date, these ought to be investigated in more detail by comparing the trafficking pathways of yeast with those of more basal fungi.
It is well established that clear differences can be seen in
the appearance of organelles of the endocytic system of
yeast and animal cells, most strikingly between the yeast
vacuole and the animal lysosomes. Yet, is challenging to
compare their endocytic systems as both consist of an
interconnected and complex network of organelles. The
current view is that the endosomal system in yeast is simpler than that in an animal cell, but that they also have
common principles and pathways [53,89]. This view is
now corroborated by our inspection of the evolution of
the SNARE repertoire in fungi. Originally, the endocytic
systems of the progenitors of fungal and animal cells
probably operated with the same basic SNARE collection
inherited from the proto-eukaryotic cell. However, all
fungi possess a novel, fungi-specific SNARE factor, Vam7,
which can bind to PI(3)P-containing membranes by
means of its N-terminal PX-domain. Although the exact
function of this SNARE protein is not clear at the moment,
it seems to play a role in endosomal trafficking, revealing
a clear difference in the endosomal SNARE collection of
fungi and animals.
During evolution, the lineage that gave rise to baker's
yeast has gained few additional SNARE proteins. The largest transformation of the SNARE collection of baker's
yeast was caused by a relatively recent whole genome
duplication within the Saccharomyces lineage, resulting in
an expansion of the secretory set of SNAREs. Although the
consequences of this duplication are not well understood,
it seems that at least one of the new secretory SNAREs,
Spo20, has specialized for the process of sporulation.
Another gene duplication took place in the endosomal
syntaxins. Earlier in evolution, an ancestral endosomal
syntaxin (Qa.III.b) was duplicated, giving rise to Pep12
and Vam3 in the lineage of Saccharomycotina, while
other fungi only possess one endosomal syntaxin. It is
unclear whether one of the duplicated endosomal syntaxins in hemiascomycetous yeasts retained the ancestral
function while the second gained a new function (neofunctionalization) or whether each one carries out part of
the ancestral function (subfunctionalization). It seems
possible that one of the two syntaxins specialized to the
process of homotypic vacuole fusion. This hypothesis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/19

could be tested by investigating the function of the ancestral endosomal syntaxin in endosomal trafficking of more
basal fungal species like Ustilago maydis [90]. The presence
of two diverged endosomal syntaxins in hemiascomycetes
yeast has also to be taken into consideration when comparing endosomal trafficking in yeast with that in animal
cells. In addition, one has to bear in mind that independent and more substantial expansions of the SNARE repertoire occurred in animals, possibly establishing more
complex endosomal trafficking pathways [22]. For example, during the evolution of animals, an ancestral endosomal syntaxin (Qa.III.b) gave rise to three different
syntaxins, Syx7, Syx20 and Syx17. In addition, several
other novel endosomal SNAREs were added. When comparing yeast with animal cells, it is also important not to
combine different animal species, as the original animal
SNARE collection was modified in many different ways in
different animal lineages. For instance, vertebrates possess
few additional endosomal SNAREs, e.g. Syx13, although
the rise of vertebrates mainly resulted in a robust expansion of the secretory set of SNAREs.
