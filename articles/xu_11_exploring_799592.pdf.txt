Abstract
Background: Currently, several systems have been proposed to classify viruses and indicate the relationships
between different ones, though each system has its limitations because of the complexity of viral origins and their
rapid evolution rate. We hereby propose a new method to explore the relationships between different viruses.
Method: A new method, which is based on the virus-host protein-protein interaction network, is proposed in this
paper to categorize viruses. The distances between 114 human viruses, including 48 HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses, are
estimated according to the protein-protein interaction network between these viruses and humans.
Conclusions/significance: The results demonstrated that our method can disclose not only relationships
consistent with the taxonomic results of currently used systems of classification but also the potential relationships
that the current virus classification systems have not revealed. Moreover, the method points to a new direction
where the functional relationships between viruses and hosts can be used to explore the virus relationships on a
systematic level.

Introduction
Viruses can be classified according to different aspects
[1,2], such as their geometry, whether they have an
envelope, the identity of the host organism they can
infect, the mode of transmission, or the type of disease
they cause. One of the widely accepted and useful classification systems is based on the combination of their
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), strandedness (singlestranded or double-stranded), sense, and method of
replication. This classification system was proposed by
David Baltimore [3]. However, the system concerning
the diseases caused by the viruses or the morphology of
the viruses is not generally accepted, because different
viruses could cause the same disease and their morphologies could look very similar under the microscope. It is
the instability of the classification system based on viral

characteristics that keep these kinds of taxonomy systems from general acceptance. The Baltimore classification offers a way to classify viruses in a given category
and behaves in a definite pattern. Meanwhile, the International Committee on Taxonomy of viruses (ICTV)
[4-6] has also devised and implemented rules for the
classification of viruses. The ICTV system shares many
features with the taxonomy system of cellular organisms,
such as structure, etc. This classification uses the regular
succession of Order, Family, Subfamily, Genus, and Species. Particularly, the code of nomenclature regulated by
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
differs from the others on several points. Most notably,
names of orders and families are italicized, and species
names are not binomial, but instead, they generally take
the form of [Host] virus. Up to now, 84 families and
more than 2,000 species of virus have been defined by
the ICTV classification system. In addition, other virus
classification systems, such as Holmes classification [7],
LHT System of Virus Classification [8], and Casjens and
Kings classification [9] of viruses, have been also
proposed.

All of the three main classification systems mentioned
above, the Baltimore classification, LHT System, and
Casjens and Kings Classification, are based on certain
chemical or physical characteristics of viruses. On the
other hand, the ICTV classification system is based on
the hypothesis that the members of the order might
have a common ancestor. However, sixty-four of the
total 84 families in the ICTV classification system are
still unplaced. The Holmes classification sorts viruses
into Phaginae (attacks bacteria), Phytophaginae (attacks
plants), and Zoophaginae (attacks animals) according to
the host type. These classifications are accepted by some
virologists, but not all the virologists are satisfied with
the current virus classification systems [10]. Some of
them even do not take the information of virus taxonomy into consideration while doing their research
because of the limitations of each classification method
mentioned above. As the current taxonomies of the
viruses do not reflect the phylogeny relationship of different viruses [11], it is hard to build a classification system to satisfy all virologists. However, different methods
could be set up to show the relationship between different viruses, which might be helpful to virologists.
A virus needs to use the DNA replication and protein
synthetic systems of its host to complete its life cycle
and proliferation. Therefore, some viruses exhibit strong
co-evolutionary relationships with their mammalian host
organisms [12,13]. The study of co-evolution dates back
to over 40 years ago [14]. The co-evolution models,
including “gene-for-gene”, “matching allele”, and
“matching genotype”, have already been proposed
[15-18]. In addition, evidence of co-evolution is available
in both the temporal and the spatial patterns [14]. As
essential viral proteins usually interact with their host
proteins, we extend the hypothesis “function association
- guilty by association” in an organism to the protein
interactions between the organisms and explore the
relationships between different viruses by examining the
virus-host protein-protein interaction network. The
Gene Ontology, which is comprised of terms in a hierarchical tree structure and is adopted for the gene function assignment of most studied organisms, is now
extending its realm to the field of microbial annotation.
The project of PAMGO (Plant-Associated Microbe
Gene Ontology) has already extended the GO system to
describe various processes related to microbe-host interactions. Currently, the project has assigned more than
800 new GO terms for microbe-host interaction or
other symbiotic interactions [19]. The controlled vocabulary of GO offers scientific researchers a consistent
framework to gain and process biological information,
thus minimizing the trouble coupled with the variations
in human language and its inconsistency across different
research communities. In this paper, we hypothesize

Page 2 of 7

that the relationship between viruses can be explored
through the functional relationship of their proteins’
interacting partners from their hosts. To demonstrate
this, we used the viruses and human as the model since
the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data between
viruses and human have been accumulated significantly
more than such data between viruses and other organisms. First, the PPI data between viruses and human are
collected. Next, the relationship between distinct viruses
is inferred based on the functional similarity between
different GO terms of their proteins’ interacting partners
in human. Our estimation of the relationships between
different viruses shows a different perspective to the
relations of viruses that attack the same host and could
be regarded as complementary to the traditional virus
classification systems.

Results and discussion
Our method based on the virus-host protein-protein
interaction network has shown us the relationships
among different viruses according to molecular function.
As it was demonstrated in the molecular function tree
(Figure 1), 114 viruses whose proteins interacted with
human proteins were displayed. In the Figure 1, HIV-1
viruses that belong to the retro-transcribing virus category were generally grouped together. Furthermore,
some dsDNA viruses, including CRPVK, BPV1, HPV18,
HPV11, HPV6B, HHV11, HPV11, ADE09, and HPV16,
were also grouped together. All of these placements are
consistent with previous virus taxonomy, which illustrates that the method based on the virus-host proteinprotein interaction network has the ability to disclose
the similarities among the same type of viruses. However, in the very same figure, it reveals that some viruses
possessed different nucleic acid types and were clustered
together, an outcome that conflicted with the Baltimore
classification method. This phenomenon signifies at
least two points. First, as our method of cataloging
viruses relies on the protein-protein interaction data
between each virus and its host, more available PPI data
leads to better elucidation of the relationship. Since the
protein-protein interaction data between most viruses
and human are incomplete, and some viruses have more
PPI data available than others, the unbalanced proteinprotein interaction data could potentially have an effect
on the tree structure. This conclusion is supported by
the finding that the relationships between viruses with
more PPI data have much better consistency with the
results of other classification systems. Second, by exploring the virus-human protein-protein interaction network, we found that viruses of different types can target
the same human proteins. For example, the proteins
(PHOSP_RABVH and Q910M0_MOKV) of RABVH and
MOKV, which belong to single-stranded RNA viruses,

parts. The first part is the Uniprot ID of a virus, and the second part of the item name is the basic information of the virus. The length of each

interact with the human protein that has the GO annotation Dynein light chain 1 (DYL1_HUMAN), cytoplasmic, while the protein (VA36_VACCC) of VACCC,
which is a double-stranded DNA virus, also interacts
with the similar human protein (KLC2_HUMAN, Kinesin light chain). All of the interactions in our network
are from Dyer et al. (23) and Pathogen Interaction Gateway, which were experimentally supported. The functional similarity of the target human proteins might
narrow the distance of different types of virus. These
results may indicate the relationship between viruses of

different types. Due to the complexity of the virus classification system and the rapid evolution rate of viruses,
there could be some hidden relationship between those
dissimilar viruses. For example, different viruses may
evolve to target the same cellular processes, called convergent evolution. Traditional taxonomy systems, which
merely take chemical or physical characteristics into
consideration, might not have the ability to reveal this
kind of hidden relationship. Moreover, we would like to
point out that our method does not reflect the phylogenic relationships between different viruses. Instead,

Xu et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5(Suppl 3):S11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/S3/S11

our classification could disclose the similarity of potential pathogenic mechanisms of distinct viruses, which
could be helpful to the treatment of related disease. Our
new method could be regarded as complementary for
the virologist to discover the relationship between
viruses of different types, especially when the potential
mechanism that our method may disclose is taken into
consideration.
Examination of HIV classification using our method
reveals additional insights. HIV has two subtypes, HIV-1
and HIV-2, which are extracted from chimpanzees and
sooty mangabeys respectively [20]. Both subtypes of
HIV are transmitted by sexual contact, bodily fluid, or
from mother to child. They can cause AIDS, and lead to
the symptom of Immunodeficiency. The two subtypes
cannot be distinguished without tests performed by a
specialized physician. The viruses that belong to the Primate lentivirus group, which could be displayed as the
representation of the HIV in our dataset, were selected
out and integrated in Figure 2. As shown in the molecular function tree (Figure 2), almost all HIV-1 and HIV-2
viruses were divided into two categories (GO terms of
human proteins that correspond to separate HIV-1 and
HIV-2 are stored in Additional file 1). The only two
exceptions were the HV1LA and HV2KR. The former
represents an HIV-1 virus belonging to group M, and is
grouped with the HIV-2, while HV2KR, which is defined
as a Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 virus, is

Page 4 of 7

classified with the majority of HIV-1. Considering the
subtle differences between the two subtypes of HIV, our
result revealed the potential relationship and indicated
the similarity between not only HV1LA and HIV-2
virus, but also HV2KR and HIV-1 virus. Meanwhile,
SIVM1, which is regarded as simian immunodeficiency
virus, was grouped closer with the HIV-2 viruses than
HIV-1 viruses. In fact, previous study has proposed that
a strain of SIV jumped from Sooty Mangabey to become
the HIV-2 virus [21]. In addition, phylogenic methods
also have shown the SIV in Sooty Mangabey and Macaque have close relationship to HIV-2 virus [22]. This
evidence, to certain extent, strengthens the reliability of
our method. Moreover, we had computed the relationship between different HIV viruses on the basis of ‘Biological Process’ and ‘Cellular Component’, and obtained
very similar tree structures to the one based on ‘Molecular Function’ (Additional 2). The generally successful
separation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses in the molecular
function tree demonstrated the feasibility of our method
to evaluate the relationship between viruses.
In evolution research, different indicators, such as the
similarity between conserved sequences, have been used
to determine the distances between organisms. In our
method, we have defined the smallest special score
derived from the SSBP of proteins between two sets as
the distances between different viruses. The mathematical definition of the distance between two sets is the

Figure 2 HIV relationship tree based on molecular function. All the virus IDs shown in the figure are Uniprot IDs. The length of each branch
represents the distance between different viruses. HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus are almost completely separated, except HV1LA, which belongs to the
HIV-1 group M subgroup B and is grouped with the HIV-2 virus, and HV2KR falls in the HIV-1 virus clade. SIVM1, which represents the simian
immunodeficiency virus, shows closer relationship with HIV-2 virus. Meanwhile, HV192 has a little difference with other HIV-1 viruses in our figure.
According to the graph, the distances among HIV-1 viruses are relatively farther than the distances between HIV-2 viruses.

Xu et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5(Suppl 3):S11

infimum of the distance between any components of the
two sets. Our definition of the distance between two
viruses is consistent with the mathematical distance
definition of two point sets. Moreover, some human
proteins, with which a viral protein interacts, could
exert their function in relatively general processes.
These general proteins contribute less to differentiate
viruses. In an ideal situation, we should use the proteins
that have more specific functions and participate in
more special processes to reflect the relationship
between different viruses. The infimum represents the
most specific similarity between two protein sets and
could reflect the relationship between two viruses on
the most specific level. Considering the definition of GO
term is at a general level, the smallest special score also
has the tendency to get rid of the non-specificity of
some GO terms in our sets.
In our new approach, the ability to detect the relationship between distinct viruses relies on the quality of the
virus-host protein-protein interaction network explicitly.
If the network is reliable and contains enough information to bridge the connection between viruses and their
hosts, the relationship disclosed based on PPI network
would reveal more functional associations to the virologists who are interested in the relationships between different viruses. In total, 9683 human proteins are
confirmed to interact with these viral proteins of 114
viruses, and among them 8249 human proteins are verified to interact with 48 HIV viruses, while 66 non-HIV
viruses correspond only to 1434 human proteins. This
number is relatively low compared to the number of
human proteins that interact with HIV proteins. As discussed above, the classification of HIV viruses displayed
much more reliable result than for the rest groups of
the viruses. This might be caused by the difference
between the amounts of data in the two corresponding
datasets that are currently available. It is expected that
more verified virus-host protein-protein interaction data
of other viruses may lead to more reliable and valuable
results for exploring potential relationships between distinct viruses. Our method points to a new direction to
elucidate the relationship between viruses on the systematical level and provides rich information for virologists to study the relationships among various viruses.

Materials and methods
Protein-protein interaction network

The protein-protein interaction network used in this
paper is constructed mainly according to the results of
Dyer et al. [23], which focuses on the interaction
between human protein and pathogen protein, and a
database (http://molvis.vbi.vt.edu/pig/index.php) describing the pathogen and human protein-protein interaction.

Page 5 of 7

We combined the data from the two sources mentioned
above to build the protein interaction networks between
each virus and its host, human, in our paper. Each interaction pair in the network is composed of a viral protein
and a human protein. This network is the foundation
that we used to evaluate the relationships between different viruses. The distance between distinct viruses is
calculated according to the functional similarity of the
host protein that interacts with the corresponding viral
protein in the network. In the GO system, each human
protein has been normally assigned GO terms in three
different categories - ‘Cellular Component’, ‘Biological
Process’ and ‘Molecular Function’, we used the GO term
- “Molecular Function” to carry out the analysis since
researchers usually are more interested in the molecular
function of a protein when they study the virus and
host interaction.
Distance between different viruses

As some viruses exhibit co-evolution with their host
[12,13], assessing the distance between different viruses
according to the virus-host protein-protein interaction
network is considered to be reasonable. The human proteins that interact with the proteins of a target virus are
selected out from the network to form a set. As shown
in Figure 3B, the subnetwork that contains the interaction pairs between human proteins and viral proteins
from an identified virus (here corresponding to HV1A2
and EBV respectively) is extracted from the whole PPI
network. The related interaction partners in human to
each virus (red spot in Figure 3B) are selected to form
the set. Each set is named after the related virus and
represents the functional property of the virus in the
network according to the “function association” theory.
Next, the distance between different viruses is evaluated
based on the functional similarity of the corresponding
sets as follows: First, each component of a set is picked
out to form a protein pair with each component of
another set. Then, the special score, derived from the
method of smallest shared biological process (SSBP), of
each pair is calculated. The infimum (inf) of the score
mentioned above is defined as the distance between the
two corresponding viruses on the basis of the distance
between the two sets in the field of mathematics (see
formula 1). Then, the relation tree of different viruses is
constructed based on the above resulted distance. In the
end, the relationships among different viruses are
inferred according to GO term based on the molecular
function of host proteins participating in the virus and
human interaction.
The distance between two sets C and D is defined as:
dist(C, D) = inf{ x − y |x ∈ C, y ∈ D}

Figure 3 The process of calculating the special score system derived from SSBP. A. The definition of special score is similar to that of SSBP,
where the red proteins share the parent term that the gene product concerning it is 8, while the counterpart of the green protein is 18. Thus,
the red protein pair will have the score 8, meanwhile the green pair corresponds to18. The greater score of the green pair indicates less
similarity than the red pair. B, The PPI network between not only human and HV1A2 but also human and EBV. The spot in the picture represents
the protein, and the line that links two proteins stands for the interaction between them. The name of the protein is displayed on the spot,
while the suffix of each name shows species to which this protein belongs. The human proteins are marked red while the viral proteins are
marked yellow. As shown in the picture, the human protein in the protein-protein interaction network is selected out to form two sets, then the
distance between the two sets are stored as the distance of the two viruses.

The score system derived from SSBP

The method of smallest shared biological process, which
is used to measure the functional similarity between different proteins in the previous work [24,25], is the

reference of the special score system applied in this
paper. The following procedure was used to quantify
functional similarity between two proteins according to
SSBP: First, identify all gene ontology terms shared by

Xu et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5(Suppl 3):S11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/S3/S11

two proteins; next, count how many other proteins were
assigned to each of the shared terms as well; finally,
identify the shared biological process term with the
smallest count (SSBP). The SSBP score between each
protein-protein pair is recorded. As shown in the Figure
3A, the two numbers 8 and 18 in the red or green circles are the SSBP scores of the red protein pair and
green protein pair, respectively. The special score system
used in this article is generally derived from the SSBP.
Instead of calculating the protein relationships based on
their biological process GO terms, we focused on their
relationships based on the GO terms in “Molecular
Function” category. This is the only difference between
our method and SSBP. Last, the infimum of the special
score of two sets, which is described in the previous
part, is stored in the distance matrix to measure the
relationship between two viruses.
