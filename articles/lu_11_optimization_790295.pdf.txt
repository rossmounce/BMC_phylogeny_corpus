Abstract
Background: Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV) is an important agent to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication with
suboptimal effect on virological and serological response. To optimize Adefovir therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, we studied the baseline parameters and on-treatment HBV
DNA for favorable outcomes.
Methods: 48 patients were enrolled in the study and followed up for 5 years prospectively. Baseline characteristics,
virological, serological and biochemical parameters as well as on treatment HBV DNA were assessed in prediction
of favorable outcomes.
Results: 1. The patients with baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN, 40 IU/L)
had higher rates of viral response (VR), HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion at year 5 compared to the patients
with ALT < 5 × ULN (VR: 75% vs 43.8%, p = 0.035; HBeAg loss: 43.9% vs 13.8%, p = 0.017; HBeAg seroconversion:
37.9% vs 13.8%, p = 0.035); Patients with baseline HBV DNA < 109 copies/ml and ALT ≥3 × ULN had more chance
of HBeAg seroconversion (40.9% vs 8.7%, p = 0.012), while in patients with HBeAg < 800 s/co or HBsAg < 5000 IU/
ml higher rates of HBeAg loss were achieved. 2. HBV DNA level < 104 copies/ml at week 24 was predictive for VR
(96.0% vs 40.9%, P < 0.001), HBeAg loss (84.0% vs 36.3%, P = 0.001) and HBeAg seroconversion (36.0% vs 9.1%, P =
0.030).
Conclusions: ADV treatment should be started for patients with baseline ALT≥5 × ULN or patients with ALT≥3 ×
ULN and HBV DNA < 109 copies/ml. Lower level of HBeAg(< 800 s/co) and HBsAg(< 5000 IU/ml) may be regarded
as referenced factors. In patients with serum HBV DNA < 104 copies/ml at week 24 the therapy should continue,
and a favorable outcome may be achieved in 5 years or longer.

Background
Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV) is a nucleotide analogue for
treatment of hepatitis B. Long term treatment with
ADV is well tolerated and may produce long-term virological, biochemical, serological and histological
improvement [1]. Compared with lamivudine (LAM)
and telbivudine, ADV correlated resistance develops less

frequently but ADV has less potent activity against
hepatitis B virus (HBV). It has been reported that the
rates of HBV DNA negative, hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg) loss and HBeAg seroconversion were 39%, 58%
and 48% respectively in the subjects with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with ADV 10 mg
once daily for 5 years, and 66% of them achieved alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and 20% developped HBV mutant [2]. These data highlighted an
urgent need to identify the predictors that will help to
find candidates who may likely benefit from ADV or,

alternatively, determine whether other extensive treatment is needed. Recently, It has been reported that
baseline and on-treatment serum HBV DNA were significant predictors for sustained viral response in CHB
patients with pegylated interferon(Peg-IFN) and nucleos
(t)ide analogues(NAs) treatment [3-8]. In the GLOBE
study of HBeAg-positive patients treated with telbivudine, HBV DNA negative at week 24 was more predictive for responses than other parameters [9]. Similar
results were reported in LAM and ADV therapies
[10,11]. However, the association of these predictors
with effect of long term ADV treatment has rarely been
reported.
The aim of this study is to assess baseline and ontreatment serum markers in prediction of long term
response in the early phase of treatment with ADV
among HBeAg-positive CHB patients so as to identify
the most beneficial patients from ADV treatment and
optimize the therapy.

Efficacy End Points

The primary efficacy endpoints in this study were
HBeAg seroconversion defined as combination of
HBeAg loss and development of hepatitis B e antibody
accompanied by HBV DNA negative(< 300 copies/ml).
The secondary efficacy endpoints are HBeAg loss and
viral response (VR) defined as HBV DNA negative.
Statistical Analyses

Descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, and
standard deviation for each continuous variable and frequencies for each categorical variable were used to summarize the data as well as detect outliers and missing
values. The associations of baseline and on-treatment
parameters with virological, serological and biochemical
responses were assessed using Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests. All p values were calculated with twosided significance level of 0.05. Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North
Carolina).

Methods
Subject population

Results

48 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who enrolled in the
study were treated with ADV (provided by GlaxoSmithKline) and followed up for 5 years. All patients
were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) and HBeAg for more than 6 months and with
baseline ALT ≥1.2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN,
40 IU/L) and HBV DNA ≥106 copies/ml before treatment. Criteria for exclusion included serum creatinine
greater than 1.5 mg/dl (130μmol/L); seropositivity for
hepatitis C or D virus or human immunodeficiency
virus. No patients received LAM or any other anti-HBV
therapy within 6 months prior to treatment. Other treatments were not used during the therapy. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients and the
study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Jinan
Infectious Disease Hospital.

1. Baseline characteristics of demographic, clinical and
laboratory data

Study Design

All patients were followed up at weeks 4, 12, 24, 52
and every 12-16 weeks after week 52 for detection of
serum biochemical parameters, serum viral load
(Roche COBAS Amplicore HBV Monitor PCR assay,
lower limit of detection 300 copies/ml) and HBV markers (micro particle enzyme immunoassay with
ABBOTT reagents). DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis of HBV genome were evaluated at baseline.
Serum samples at first time point from subjects who
experienced a breakthrough of HBV DNA (HBV DNA
level increased by 1 log10 copies/ml or more than the
treatment nadir) were assessed for the development of
ADV-associated mutations (rtA181V and rtN236T) in
the HBV polymerase.

Except for 1 woman who withdrew because of pregnance at week 104, 47 patients completed 5 years’ follow
up. All patients were ethnically Chinese and HBV genotype C positive. The baseline demographic, clinical and
virological data are shown in Table 1.
2. Virological, serological and biochemical response

Of 47 patients, the rates of VR, accumulative HBeAg
loss, HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalization in
the end of the fifth year were 66.0%, 36.2%, 23.4% and
70.2%, respectively. The rates of HBeAg loss increased
over time, and the proportion of patients with ALT normalization and HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml achieved
maximal values after 2 and 4 years respectively (Figure
1). Virus breakthrough was found in 4 patients but
ADV correlated variants were detectable only in 3 of
them.

3. Relationship between baseline parameters and 5-year
response

We evaluated baseline characteristics such as ALT, HBV
DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg level in prediction of 5-year
response and found baseline ALT was a potential predictor of outcome. Patients with baseline ALT ≥5 ×
ULN were more likely to have HBeAg seroconversion,
HBeAg loss and VR than patients with ALT < 5 × ULN
(Table 2), while in patients with HBeAg < 800 s/co or
HBsAg < 5000 IU/ml higher rates of HBeAg loss were
achieved. The baseline HBeAg level predicted VR too, as
88.9% patients with baseline HBeAg < 800 s/co became
HBV DNA negative, whereas baseline HBV DNA level
alone was not a significant predictor for HBeAg seroconversion, HBeAg loss or VR.
Even so, there was a trend that the rate of VR in the 5
years decreased with the higher levels of baseline viral
load (Figure 2). In subgroup analyses, we found in
patients with baseline HBV DNA < 109 copies/ml, ALT
was positively associated with VR and HBeAg seroconversion. The rate of HBeAg seroconversion was

significantly higher in patients with ALT ≥3 × ULN
when compared to the patients with ALT < 3 × ULN
(40.9% vs 8.7%, p = 0.012).
4. Impact of on-treatment HBV DNA on outcomes

The relationships between on-treatment HBV DNA levels
and 5-year outcomes were presented in Table 3. Patients
with serum HBV DNA level < 4 log10 copies/ml at week
24 had higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion, HBeAg loss
and VR compared to the patients with serum HBV DNA
≥4 log10 copies/ml. The drop of the serum HBV DNA ≥3
log10 copies/ml at week 4 and HBV DNA undetectable at
week 52 can predict VR and HBeAg loss while the drop of
the serum HBV DNA ≥4 log10 copies/ml at week 12 was
significantly associated with the increased rates of HBeAg
loss and HBeAg seroconversion.
5. Resistance to ADV

Four patients experienced viral breakthrough at week
104, 184, 208, 260 respectively. HBV DNA rebounded to

2.2 × 10 4 - 6.5 × 10 7 copies/ml, and ALT flares were
found in 3 patients but none of them developped liver
decompensation. ADV correlated mutations were
detected in 3 of the 4 patients (1 of them with N236T
and another 2 with combination of A181T/V and
N236T mutations in HBV DNA polymerase). None of
the patients who achieved HBV DNA < 4 log copies/ml
at week 24 experienced viral breakthrough. All four
patients were then given additional LAM for combination therapy.
6. Safety analysis

Four patients had an increase in serum creatinine of
more than the peak value of normal (1.5 mg/dl), but the
abnormality was not confirmed by a consecutive sample
test. Three patients had slightly elevated serum uric acid
in incontinuous samples. No action was taken regarding
study medication dosing.

Discussion
The response of ADV monotherapy for HBeAg positive
CHB patients is less satisfying comparing with that of
other oral NAs, but in many Asian countries like China,
tenofovir is unavailable, ADV is still the only nucleotide
analogue without cross resistance to other NAs to date
[12-14]. The optimization of ADV therapy according to
patients’ baseline and on-treatment parameters may be a
feasible strategy to increase the response. It was ever
reported that ADV might provide additional benefits for
HBeAg seroconversion in patients with pre-treatment
HBV DNA levels between 107 and 108 copies/ml [15].
Subgroup analysis of GLOBE Study with telbivudine
revealed that patients with ALT≥2 × ULN and HBV
DNA < 109 copies/ml had more chance of VR, HBeAg
seroconversion and ALT nomalization at year 2 [16].
There were also similar reports about long term LAM
therapy [10]. In our study baseline factors such as ALT
predicted long term response to ADV therapy. Patients
with higher baseline ALT (≥5 × ULN) had more chance
of optimal outcomes, and lower levels of HBeAg (< 800
s/co) and HBsAg(< 5000 IU/ml) also predicted HBeAg
loss. In addition, there was a trend that patients with

lower HBV DNA level might have higher rates of VR,
HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion although no statistical significance was observed in our study. Our findings may be limited by the relatively small sample size.
When we combined baseline ALT and HBV DNA, we
found that patients with baseline HBV DNA < 10 9
copies/ml and ALT ≥3 × ULN had more favorable outcomes. An elevated ALT level indicates increased clearance to HBV infected hepatocytes. It was reported that
Chinese patients with ALT > 5 × ULN had high rate of
spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion even without treatment [17], but treatment with anti-virus medicaments
can improve the chance of HBeAg seroconversion and
decrease the disease progression which has been proved
in many clinical studies [2,18-20]. Similarly, HBeAg level
may reflect the clearance capability of a HBV infected
body to HBV infected hepatocytes [21,22]. The significance of HBsAg in treatment of patients with CHB is
being paid close attention to recently. HBsAg may
reflect the level of cccDNA in liver and the decrease
during treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2a may
predict the sustained viral response [23,24]. More studies are needed to elucidate HBsAg variations during
treament with NAs. In our study patients with lower
level of baseline HBeAg and HBsAg had more chance of
HBeAg loss which indicaties that baseline HBeAg and
HBsAg may be regarded as subsidiary parameters in
pretreatment evaluation.
Early HBV DNA reduction may also contribute to VR
and HBeAg seroconversion in some studies [11,15,25].
It’s generally accepted that therapy can be optimized by
monitoring of serum HBV DNA levels during treatment
with oral NAs and week 24 is the most important time
point recommended to assess efficacy in LAM and telbivudine therapy [26], but whether it’s reasonable in treatment of suboptimal antiviral drug like ADV remains
controversial. We selected week 4, 12, 24 and 52 as time
points in our study and found that serum HBV DNA <
4 log 10 copies/ml at week 24 was predictive for VR,
HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion after 5-year
treatment, The drop of HBV DNA from baseline ≥3
log10 copies/ml at week 4, ≥ 4 log10 copies/ml at week

Lu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:444

12 and HBV DNA turning negative at week 52 can also
predict favorable outcomes although not as optimal as
HBV DNA < 4 log10 copies/ml at week 24. None of the
patients who achieved HBV DNA < 4 log10 copies/ml at
week 24 experienced viral breakthrough. Accordingly we
recommend serum HBV DNA level < 4 log10copies/ml
at week 24 as one of the major predictors for long term
outcomes in patients with ADV therapy.
Our study has some limitations because of its small
sample size and lack of a control group. However, in
our study most patients completed 5 years’ follow-up,
and the detection method was advanced. The findings
may give some evidence to manage HBeAg positive
patients who intend to accept or have already accepted
ADV therapy.

Conclusions
ADV treatment may be initiated to patients with baseline ALT≥5 × ULN or patients with ALT≥3 × ULN and
HBV DNA < 109 copies/ml, lower level of HBeAg(< 800
s/co) or HBsAg (< 5000 IU/ml) may be regarded as
referenced factors. Patients will be followed up regularly
and long term outcome may be predicted according to
on-treatment HBV DNA. For patients with HBV DNA
level < 104 copies/ml at week 24 therapy should continue and favorable outcomes may be achieved in 5
years or longer. For others with HBV DNA ≥104 copies/
ml at week 24, some modifications for the therapeutic
regimen such as addition or switch to another agent
should be considered to enhance the long term
response.
