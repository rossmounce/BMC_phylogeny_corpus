Background: The relationship between genetic variation in gene expression and phenotypic
variation observable in nature is not well understood. Identifying how many phenotypes are
associated with differences in gene expression and how many gene-expression differences are
associated with a phenotype is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of
complex traits.

Results: We compared levels of gene expression among nine natural isolates of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae grown either in the presence or absence of copper sulfate. Of the nine strains, two show
a reduced growth rate and two others are rust colored in the presence of copper sulfate. We
identified 633 genes that show significant differences in expression among strains. Of these genes,
20 were correlated with resistance to copper sulfate and 24 were correlated with rust coloration.
The function of these genes in combination with their expression pattern suggests the presence of
both correlative and causative expression differences. But the majority of differentially expressed
genes were not correlated with either phenotype and showed the same expression pattern both
in the presence and absence of copper sulfate. To determine whether these expression differences
may contribute to phenotypic variation under other environmental conditions, we examined one
phenotype, freeze tolerance, predicted by the differential expression of the aquaporin gene AQY2.
We found freeze tolerance is associated with the expression of AQY2.

Conclusions: Gene expression differences provide substantial insight into the molecular basis of
naturally occurring traits and can be used to predict environment dependent phenotypic variation.

An important question concerning the genetic basis and evolution of complex traits is the relative contribution of gene
regulation versus protein structure. If gene-expression differences

make a substantial contribution to phenotypic variation
found in nature, the genetic basis of complex traits may be
more readily understood through the analysis of gene expression [1]. Furthermore, it would imply that most evolutionary

Background

To further investigate the relationship between genetic variation in gene expression and phenotypic variation, we measured genome-wide mRNA transcript levels in nine strains of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae which vary in their sensitivity to
copper sulfate (CuSO4), a strong oxidizing agent often used as
an antimicrobial agent in vineyards [17,18].

Genome expression studies have shown numerous differences in transcript abundance both within and between
closely related species [4-12]. In some instances, genetic variation in gene expression has been associated with phenotypic
variation [1,5,10,13-16]. However, gene expression differences correlated with a phenotype may or may not contribute
to the phenotype. Distinguishing between these possibilities
requires locating the genes responsible for the trait [1,14-16].

Results
Natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae vary in
their sensitivity to copper sulfate
Copper is an oxidizing agent necessary for many single-electron transfer reactions within the cell and is toxic at high concentrations [19]. Natural isolates of S. cerevisiae have been
reported to vary in their sensitivity to copper sulfate
[17,20,21], and resistance to copper sulfate may be a recently
acquired adaptation as a result of the application of copper
sulfate as a fungicide to treat powdery mildew in vineyards
[17,18]. Seven isolates from vineyards in Italy, the sequenced
laboratory strain S288C and an isolate from an oak tree in
Pennsylvania vary in their sensitivity to copper sulfate (Table
1, Figure 1). Two of the strains produce red/brown or rustcolored colonies in the presence of copper sulfate.

are shown.

Identification of gene expression differences in the
presence and absence of copper sulfate
Expression levels were measured using DNA microarrays in
the nine strains during exponential growth in rich medium
and in rich medium supplemented with copper sulfate (see
Materials and methods). The microarrays used in this study
are composed of oligonucleotides of 70 base pairs (bp) that
are perfect matches to the S288C sequence. Although cDNA
prepared from the other eight strains will not always be a perfect match to the sequence on the microarray, we expect fewer
than 0.2 differences per 70 bp on average (see Materials and
methods), and therefore do not expect the sequence differences to affect our measurements. A reference design was
used whereby the RNA of each strain grown in rich medium
and rich medium supplemented with copper sulfate was compared to the pooled RNA from all nine strains grown in rich
medium and copper sulfate medium, respectively. Using
three replicate experiments, four statistical tests were used to
identify differentially expressed genes. From an analysis of
variance, 194 genes showed significant expression differences
among strains grown in copper sulfate medium, 241 genes
showed significant expression differences among strains
grown in rich medium, and 516 genes showed significant
expression differences across both conditions (p < 0.01). One
hundred and thirty-one genes showed significant differences
between the rich medium and copper sulfate medium reference pools (t-test, p < 0.01). Because an analysis of variance

information

To identify gene-expression differences correlated with
resistance to copper sulfate, we measured the correlation
between the differentially expressed genes and sensitivity to
copper sulfate. In liquid medium M34 and YPS163 were sensitive to copper sulfate (ANOVA, p = 0.00022), whereas no
significant differences were measured in rich medium alone
(ANOVA, p = 0.159; see Materials and methods and Figure 3).
Genes correlated with sensitivity to copper sulfate are presented in Figure 4a (see Materials and methods). We used a
correlation cutoff of 0.80, which corresponds to a significance
of p < 0.01. Permutation resampling of the expression differences showed that only 13 expression differences are expected
to reach a correlation of 0.80 or above (see Materials and
methods). Of those genes correlated with sensitivity to copper

interactions

A total of 731 genes showed significant expression differences
by one or more of the four tests. These genes were hierarchically clustered on the basis of the centered correlation coefficient and are presented with their p-values in Figure 2. Most
genes show similar expression patterns in rich medium and
copper sulfate medium. Of the 633 genes that were found to
be differentially expressed among strains in either one or
both treatments, 79 genes and 36 genes were only significant
in rich medium and copper sulfate medium, respectively.
Manual inspection of these genes revealed that many of the
expression patterns significant in one medium showed a

similar, although nonsignificant, expression pattern in the
other medium. Through a separate analysis of variance, we
found 56 genes specifically differ in their pattern of expression in rich medium compared to copper sulfate medium (see
Materials and methods).

assumes errors are independent and identically distributed,
we estimated the rate of false positives using a nonparametric

strains in copper sulfate medium, in rich medium, in both
media, and between the two reference pools, respectively. We
chose a p-value cutoff of 0.01, as empirically, many significant
genes are missed using a p-value cutoff of 0.001 and numerous false positives are generated using a p-value cutoff of 0.05

sulfate, eight are expressed at a higher level in the presence of
copper sulfate while fewer than one (20 × 131/6,144) is
expected (exact test, p < 10-7). Thus, there are more genes that
are correlated with sensitivity to copper sulfate and that
change in response to copper sulfate than expected by chance.
Genes expressed at higher levels in copper-sensitive (M34
and YPS163) compared to resistant strains are known to function in response to oxidative stress. At high concentrations,
copper causes oxidative stress resulting in lipid peroxidation,
aggregation and fragmentation of proteins and DNA damage
[22]. Thioredoxin peroxidase (TSA1) and thioredoxin (TRX2)
function in redox homeostasis and are regulated by the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7p [23,24]. The heat-shock
proteins encoded by SSA1 and HSP82 are also regulated by
Yap1p and Skn7p and function in protein folding and translocation of misfolded proteins [25]. Sti1p is a member of the
Hsp82 protein complex [26]. Kar2p interacts with Ire1p [27]
to activate the unfolded protein response, including protein
disulfide isomerase, PDI1 [28], which is required for oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum [29]. These
genes, in addition to functioning in oxidative stress and protein folding, had higher levels of expression in the copper sulfate compared to rich medium reference pool (Figure 4a).
Genes expressed at lower levels in strains sensitive to copper
sulfate were expressed at lower levels in the copper sulfate
compared to the rich medium reference pool and function in
RNA processing. RFX1 encodes a repressor of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoters [30]. ENP1 encodes a small nucleolar
RNA-binding protein involved in rRNA processing [31]. In
addition, both YJL010C and YLL034C show changes in gene

Expression differences weakly correlated with resistance to
copper sulfate may also be relevant to understanding the
molecular basis of the trait, especially if it is complex. To identify relevant expression differences weakly correlated with
resistance to copper sulfate we examined genes annotated as
functioning in copper homeostasis, protein folding or oxidative stress (Figure 4b), as well as all genes expressed at higher
or lower levels as a result of the presence of copper sulfate
(Figure 5). Some genes show a weak correlation with resistance to copper sulfate. For instance, the superoxide dismutase gene SOD2 was found expressed at higher levels in
the copper sulfate reference pool, and at higher levels in M13
and M34, two of the three most copper-sensitive strains (Figure 4b). Also, the copper, zinc superoxide dismutase SOD1
was found expressed at intermediate levels in M13 and at
higher levels in YPS163 and M34 (Figure 4b), in correspondence with the strains' sensitivity to copper sulfate (Figure 1).
Superoxide dismutases protect cells against reactive oxygen
species and are induced in response to oxidative stress [22].
Of those genes found to change in response to copper sulfate
(Figure 5), the genes expressed at lower levels in the presence
of copper sulfate are not functionally related, and the genes
expressed at higher levels in the presence of copper sulfate are
significantly enriched in genes known to function in protein
folding, stress response and metabolism (see Materials and
methods). Of the 131 genes, 24 were expressed at twofold or
higher levels in the presence of copper sulfate and one, ZRT1,
encoding a high-affinity zinc transporter, was expressed at
half the level in the presence of copper sulfate. Of these 24
genes, seven are known to function in the stress response
(ALD3, DDR2, HSP12, HSP104, TSL1, YGP1, YRO2), four in
protein folding (SSA1, SSA2, SSA4, SIS1), four in metabolism
(ALD4, GLK1, HXK1, PGM2), five in copper homeostasis
(CUP1-1, CUP1-2, FET3, FTR1, SOD1), two are
uncharacterized (YHR087W, YMR315W), one encodes a
lipid-binding protein (TFS1), and one gene is involved in meiotic sister-chromatid recombination (MSC1).
Of those genes expressed at higher levels in the presence of
copper sulfate, many are also expressed at higher levels in
YPS163 and M34 (Figure 5). However, the response differs
among the copper-sulfate-resistant strains. The expression
pattern in the copper-resistant strains delineates two major
clusters enriched for genes known to function in protein folding (Figure 5, red bars) and stress response and metabolism
(Figure 5, blue bars). The group enriched for genes functioning in protein folding tends to be expressed at higher levels in
YPS163, M34 and, to some extent, M5. Whereas M5 is
resistant to copper in rich medium, it is quite sensitive in SD

or SC medium (see Additional data file 1). One of the genes
expressed at higher levels in M5, YPS163 and M34 is SIS1,
encoding an HSP40 family chaperone required for the initiation of translation [34], and known to regulate the proteinfolding activity of the heat-shock protein Ssa1p [35]. The
group enriched for genes functioning in the stress response
and carbohydrate metabolism tends to be expressed at higher
levels in the two copper-sensitive strains, YPS163 and M34,
but also tends to be expressed in S288C and M32, two of the
three most resistant strains.

Differentially expressed genes correlated with rust
coloration function in the sulfur assimilation/
methionine pathway
To identify those genes associated with the rust color phenotype, the expression of genes in copper sulfate was correlated
with rust coloration in the presence of copper sulfate (Figure
6). Twenty-four genes differentially expressed in the presence
of copper sulfate were found tightly correlated with rust coloration (r > 0.8, p < 0.01). Only 13 genes are expected by
changes, as determined by permutation resampling. Genes
with higher levels of expression in M14 and M22 often had the
same pattern in both the presence and absence of copper sulfate (Figure 6). Of the 24 genes, 10 (MET1, MET3, MET10,
ECM17, MET17, MET22, SAM1, SAM2, SAM3, SAH1) are

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/4/R26

known to function in the sulfur assimilation/methionine
metabolism pathway. Many of these genes are known to be
regulated by the transcription factor complexes Cbf1p/
Met4p/Met28p [36] and Met31p/Met32p [37]. The 14 other
genes are not obviously related to each other or to the rust coloration phenotype.

A candidate phenotype, freeze tolerance, is associated
with the differential expression of the aquaporin gene
AQY2
Gene-expression differences not associated with either copper sulfate phenotype may have fitness effects under other
environmental conditions. The expression level of the
aquaporin gene AQY2 has been shown to affect freeze tolerance [38]. YPS163 shows a 2.6- and 5.3-fold greater level of
expression of AQY2 compared to the other strains in copper
sulfate and rich media, respectively. We hypothesized that
YPS163 may show more freeze tolerance as a result of this
expression difference. As predicted, the growth of YPS163 is
not significantly different following a -30°C compared to a
4°C treatment, whereas all the other strains showed a significantly reduced growth rate (p < 10-8, paired t-test) following
a -30°C compared to a 4°C treatment (Figure 7).

Genes that respond to the presence of copper sulfate
show no correlation with sequence divergence
between strains
Most expression differences are not associated with either
resistance to copper sulfate or rust coloration in the presence
of copper sulfate. The differential expression of these genes
could be due to a lack of selective constraint on their expression levels or could be due to some form of natural selection.
For instance, they may be present due to a balance between
mutation and purifying selection or diversifying selection due
to environmental heterogeneity. One common method of
testing whether a phenotype has been driven by natural
selection is to test whether phenotypic differences among
species conflict with their known phylogenetic relationship
[39-42]. We sequenced three genes to determine the
phylogenetic relationship among the strains used in this
study (Figure 8). While the three genes show similar levels of
divergence among strains, their phylogeny cannot be
resolved, as expected for a species with sexual recombination.
However, even if multiple genealogies exists across the
genome, expression differences are expected to accumulate
monotonically as a function of time and mutation rate under
an infinite allele model for both single-gene and polygenic
characters [43,44]. Thus, we expect neutral differences in
gene expression to be correlated with divergence time
between strains.
The number of pairwise gene-expression differences found
between strains is significantly correlated with the estimated
time to coalescence, measured by the number of pairwise
sequence differences found in three genes (see Materials and
methods and Figure 9a). Because pairwise measures of

Resistance to copper sulfate
Resistance to high levels of copper ions is mediate through
the copper-binding transcription factor ACE1, which induces
the metallothionein gene CUP1 [46], the metallothionein-like
gene CRS5 [47] and the copper, zinc superoxide dismutase
gene, SOD1 [48]. A global analysis of gene expression in
response to copper sulfate using DNA microarrays identified
FET3 and FTR1, encoding two high-affinity iron transporters
and FIT2, encoding another iron transporter, as being
induced in the presence of copper along with the previously
characterized induction of CUP1, SOD1 and CRS5 [49].
Consistent with these studies, we found that CUP1, SOD1,

Discussion

casually associated with the trait, the gene-expression differences may be a response to the phenotype (correlative) or
may cause the phenotype (causative). Distinguishing between
these possibilities is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of complex traits and why transcriptional variation is present in natural populations.

divergence are not independent of one another, the correlation may be spurious. A Mantel test is a nonparametric test of
association between two dissimilarity matrices that accounts
for this nonindependence [45]. Using this test, a significant
association was found between divergence in gene expression
and DNA sequence divergence (p = 0.043). If the expression
of genes that respond to the presence of copper sulfate were
driven by adaptive evolution, the correlation between divergence in gene expression and DNA sequence divergence may
be weaker or even not present. In contrast to overall patterns
of gene expression, the expression of genes that respond to
the presence of copper sulfate (Figure 6) was not found associated with DNA sequence differences among strains (Figure
9b).

M34 grew on synthetic minimal (SD) medium or SC medium
supplemented with 0.1 mM copper sulfate (see Additional
data file 1). S288C did not grow on either SD or SC medium in
the absence of copper sulfate, and M14 and M22 grew weakly
in its absence. Thus, YPS163 and M5 are the most sensitive to
copper sulfate in SD or SC medium, in contrast to rich
medium. Genetic studies will be needed to determine whether
resistance to copper sulfate is mediated by loci other than the
CUP1 locus and whether the different transcriptional
responses among strains contribute to resistance in the
presence of copper sulfate in rich medium or in other growth
or environmental conditions.

presence of 1 mM copper sulfate medium compared to rich
medium (Figures 4, 5). In addition to these four genes, we
found another 127 genes expressed at significantly different
levels in the presence of copper sulfate, 20 of which showed a
twofold or greater level of expression in the presence of copper sulfate and one, ZRT1, encoding a high-affinity zinc transporter, which showed a 50% lower expression level in the
presence of copper sulfate (Figure 5). Our study differed from
previous studies because we measured expression 180 minutes subsequent to copper treatment in rich medium for three
replicate experiments, whereas the other studies measured
gene expression 30 minutes subsequent to copper treatment
in synthetic complete medium.
Different levels of copper resistance among strains of S. cerevisiae have been attributed to variation in the number of tandem copies of the CUP1 locus [19,20] and could be due to use
of copper sulfate in vineyards as a fungicide against powdery
mildew since the 1880s [18]. We have found an incomplete
association between CUP1 expression and resistance to copper sulfate. In the presence of copper sulfate, CUP1 was
expressed at higher levels in strains M14, M22 and M8. These
strains are resistant to 5 mM copper sulfate (Figure 1), but so
are M5, M32 and S288C. CUP1 was expressed at the lowest
levels in M13, S288C, YPS163 and M34, and while M13,
YPS163 and M34 are the most copper-sensitive strains
(Figure 1), S288C is one of the most resistant. Because previous studies examined resistance to copper sulfate on synthetic complete (SC) medium, we examined growth on SC

Genes tightly correlated with sensitivity to copper sulfate
(Figure 4a) are likely to be correlated characters and do not
contribute to levels of resistance. The oxidative stress
response involves numerous genes, many of which were
found differentially expressed between strains (Figure 4).
However, if genes that respond to oxidative stress were protecting resistant but not sensitive strains, we would expect
them to be expressed at higher levels in the resistant rather
than the sensitive strains. The opposite is observed. Thus, it
appears that many of the genes tightly associated with sensitivity to copper sulfate are likely to be differentially expressed
as part of a coordinated response to a toxic cellular environment. Ultimately, the genetic basis of resistance to copper sulfate must be mapped to identify any expression differences
that contribute to resistance.

Rust coloration
Previous studies of other rust-colored strains using electron
microscopy [50] and treatment with potassium cyanide [51]
have suggested that the rust color produced in the presence of
copper sulfate is due to the formation of copper sulfide (CuS)
mineral lattices on cell surfaces. The two rust-colored strains,
M14 and M22, often produced a distinct smell of hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) during fermentation in both the presence and
absence of copper sulfate. Hydrogen sulfide production in
M14 and M22 may be attributed to the conversion of hydrogen sulfite to hydrogen sulfide by sulfite reductase, Met10p/
Ecm17p [52], proteins that are expressed at higher levels in
both M14 and M22. The rust coloration may be due to the formation of copper sulfide as a consequence of hydrogen sulfide
production. Hydrogen sulfide is often produced during wine
fermentation [53], and, because of the resulting undesirable
flavors, may be a trait that has been selected against in yeast
strains used for wine production. In addition, copper sulfate
is often used to remove unwanted sulfides, including hydrogen sulfide, produced during wine production. Segregants
from a heterozygous Italian strain were found to co-segregate
differential expression of the sulfur-assimilation/methionine
metabolism pathway with a filigreed colony morphology
produced during starvation [21]. However, neither M14 nor
M22 showed the filigreed phenotype at any time during
starvation.

Most expression differences were not associated with either
resistance to copper sulfate or rust coloration in the presence
of copper sulfate. The differential expression of these genes
could be due to a lack of selective constraint on their expres-

interactions

Rate of divergence in gene expression

The average rate of change in gene expression was estimated
to be 5,448 expression changes across the genome per
synonymous substitution per site, or 0.887 (5,448/6,144)
expression changes in each gene per synonymous substitution per site (see Materials and methods). The average
number of synonymous substitutions per site, amino-acidaltering substitutions per site, and intergenic substitutions
per site between strains in the three sequenced regions, was
estimated as 6.87 × 10-3, 1.20 × 10-3, and 2.00 × 10-3, respectively. Therefore, the rate of change in gene expression per
synonymous substitution is higher than the rate of aminoacid substitution per synonymous substitution (0.175) or the
rate of intergenic substitution per synonymous substitution
(0.291). If intergenic sites were neutral, the expected rate of
intergenic substitution per synonymous substitution is 1. The
ratio of rates of intergenic to synonymous substitution suggests that purifying selection constrains about 70% of intergenic sites found 5' of the HHT2, MBP1 and SUP35 genes.
Because we do not know the effective number of sites in the

refereed research

The lack of any obvious phenotype associated with the genes
differentially expressed in rich medium suggests that many
expression differences may only be associated with phenotypic variation under certain environmental conditions, or
may not be associated with any phenotype at all. Because
most expression differences persist in the presence and
absence of copper sulfate, they may persist under different
environmental conditions and may be associated with phenotypic variation under those conditions. This is the case for the
sulfur-assimilation/methionine pathway, which is associated
with rust coloration only in the presence of copper sulfate.
This is also the case for the expression of the aquaporin gene,
AQY2, which was used to predict phenotype variation among
strains subsequent to a freeze-thaw cycle. Our ability to predict phenotype from expression data is not unique. The
expression of arsenic-resistance genes was used to correctly
predict sensitivity to arsenic among four natural isolates of S.
cerevisiae [10]. Gene-expression patterns from tumors have
been found to predict clinical outcome, for example [54].
Thus, the molecular phenotypes revealed by gene-expression
patterns may provide valuable insights into the molecular
genetic basis of complex traits, especially those that are environment dependent.

sion levels or could be due to some form of natural selection.
For instance, they may be the result of a balance between
mutation and purifying selection or could be a result of diversifying selection mediated by environmental heterogeneity.
We found a significant correlation between divergence in
gene expression and DNA sequence divergence for overall
patterns of gene expression but not for those that respond to
the presence of copper sulfate. While this implies that different explanations are needed for the two groups of genes, it is
difficult to ascribe neutral or selective explanations with high
levels of confidence. First, gene-expression differences are
also expected to accumulate with divergence time if selection
is uniform in its pressure across all strains. Second, many factors can influence the variance in the number of expression
differences between two strains, so the significance of the
association between divergence in gene expression with DNA
sequence divergence is difficult to interpret. Regardless, the
relationship between rates of protein divergence and divergence in gene expression are useful to understanding biological diversity at the molecular level.

reports

The differential expression of the sulfur-assimilation pathway
may be responsible for the rust coloration phenotype as the
differential expression of the pathway is not due to the presence of copper sulfate. The production of hydrogen sulfide,
the differential expression of sulfur-assimilation genes in the
absence of copper sulfate and the absence of a response by the
sulfur-assimilation genes to the presence of copper sulfate
(Figure 6), suggest that the expression of the sulfur-assimilation pathway is not due to the presence of copper sulfate.

Permutation resampling was used to estimate the number of
false positives generated for different p-value cutoffs. For
each gene, the expression data was randomized with respect

Three complete replicate experiments were done on different
days. Each replicate started from a 2-ml overnight rich
medium culture (YPD). Strains were grown at 30°C in either
rich medium or copper sulfate medium (YPD supplemented
with 1 mM CuSO4) to an OD600 of 1 (optical density of one at
600 nm is approximately 1 × 107 cells/ml), at which point they
were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 10 ml of either rich medium
or copper sulfate medium. When the strains had again
reached an OD600 of 0.8-1.0 (about 3 h later) they were spun
for 3 min at 1,500g, lysed in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (10 mM TrisCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. RNA was extracted using hot phenol and chloroform. At 3 h the strains were in exponential growth and any
residual expression differences from the previous culture
were not likely to be present. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using aminoallyl-dUTP then coupled to either a Cy3
or Cy5 fluorescent dye (Amersham Pharmacia) and
hybridized overnight to microarrays on which 6,144, 70-bp

Expression data

Arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner and
GenePix 4.0 software (Axon). An average of 762 spots per
slide were manually flagged as unusable. The raw expression
data are available in the GEO database under the ID
GSE1073. Each array was print-tip normalized (mean normalized as a function of spot intensity) using the SMA package of the R statistics software with a span parameter of 0.7
[59]. A span parameter of 1.0 is equal to no intensity-dependent normalization and a span parameter of 0.7 normalizes by
intensity as a function of 70% of the data. Three replicate
experiments were carried out, resulting in 54 arrays (9
strains, 3 replicates, 2 conditions) to measure differences
among strains and six arrays to measure differences between
the two reference pools. For one of the replicates a dye-swap
was performed, where Cy3 instead of Cy5 was used to label
the reference sample. Of the six comparisons between reference pools, two were dye-swaps. Significant differences in
gene expression among strains were obtained by applying an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to each gene individually using
the model: yi = u + Vi + ei where yi is the ratio of transcipts in
strain i compared to the reference pool, u is the average ratio
across all strains, Vi is the effect of strain i on the transcript
ratio, and ei is the error. An analysis of variance on transcript
levels rather than on ratios of transcripts was also done and
produced similar results. A t-test was used to identify genes
differentially expressed between the rich medium and copper
sulfate medium reference pools.

deposited research

Strains were grown in 2 ml overnight rich medium cultures
(YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), diluted by
a factor of 103 and 104 and plated onto the following media:
rich medium (YPD + 2% agar) and rich medium plates supplemented with 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mM copper sulfate; minimal medium (SD: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with
ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, 2% agar); SD supplemented
with 0.1 mM copper sulfate; synthetic complete medium
(CM: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, 2% agar); and CM supplemented
with 0.1 mM copper sulfate.

A reference design was used whereby the RNA from each
strain grown in rich or copper sulfate medium was compared
to a pool of the RNA from all strains grown in rich or copper
sulfate medium, respectively. The reference pool was constructed using equal samples of RNA from each strain. While
a loop design provides more statistical power from a given
number of microarrays [58], in a loop design, a biased slide
may bias estimates of all other treatment effects in the loop,
while in a reference design, a biased slide only biases the estimate of a single treatment effect. We chose to use a separate
rich medium and copper sulfate reference pool so as to
maximize our ability to detect strain differences. For example, an expression difference between rich medium and copper sulfate of 1 to 1,000 units in strain A and 2 to 1,000 units
in strain B may not be distinguishable unless strain A and B
are compared in rich and copper sulfate medium separately.
To identify genes expressed at different levels in rich medium
compared to copper sulfate, the two reference pools were
directly compared.

reports

Yeast strains were selected from a larger collection of strains
surveyed for variation in sensitivity to copper sulfate and
those used are listed in Table 1. Of the nine strains, seven were
isolated from vineyards in Italy between 1993 and 1994 by R.
Mortimer [17]. The diploid, sequenced lab strain, S288C, was
obtained from the Botstein lab (DBY8268). The lab strain
S288C is mostly derived from EM93, which was isolated from
a rotting fig in California in 1938 [55]. The woodland strain,
YPS163, and the S. paradoxus strain, YPS125, were isolated
from oak tree exudates in Lima, Pennsylvania in 1999 [56].
The strains were chosen from a screen of around 100 natural
isolates for variation in resistance to copper sulfate.

genes showed significant expression differences across both
conditions and the number of false positives was estimated to
be 255 from permutation resampling. Using a cutoff of p <
0.01, 516 genes showed expression differences across both
conditions with only 57 estimated false positives. Using a cutoff of p < 0.001, 277 genes showed expression differences
across both conditions with only two estimated false positives. While the less stringent cutoff produces 667 (922 - 255)
compared to 459 (516 - 57) significant expression differences,
28% compared to 11% of significant genes are false positives.
While the most stringent cutoff produces only two false positives, only 275 compared to 459 (516 - 57) expression differences are detected. We chose a p-value cutoff of 0.01 to

and
5'CGGGAAATCGCTCTTCAAA,
respectively; and for SUP35, 5'AAAATCCCAACCCTACGGTA
and 5'CCACTGTAGCCGGATACTGGCA, respectively. For
each strain both DNA strands were sequenced and analyzed
using Phred, Phrap and Consed [62] and polymorphic sites
were identified manually. The first polymorphic site found at
MBP1 was heterozygous in both the M5 and M13 strains, and
only the site different from the consensus was used in the
analysis. Replacement, synonymous and intergenic polymorphic sites were identified using DNASP [63]. A total of 31 segregating sites was found in 3,747 bp surveyed in the nine
strains. These include seven intergenic sites, 14 synonymous
sites, and 10 replacement sites.

Comparison of expression and phenotype data
To identify genes with expression patterns that specifically
differ between rich medium and copper sulfate treatments,
we performed an analysis of variance using the model yi = u +
Vi + ViMj + ei where yi is the ratio of transcipts in strain i compared to the reference pool, u is the average ratio across all
strains, Vi is the effect of strain i on the transcript ratio, ViMj
is the interaction between the ratio of transcripts in strain i
and medium treatment j (either rich medium or copper sulfate), and ei is the error. Using this model, 56 genes were
found to differ in their rich medium compared to copper sulfate medium among strain expression patterns.

Gene-expression differences in the presence of copper sulfate
were correlated with sensitivity to copper sulfate and rust coloration. We used a binary vector to represent differences in
growth rate and difference in color in the presence of 1 mM
copper sulfate. From Figure 1, both M34 and YPS163 have a
reduced rate of growth compared to the other seven strains.
Thus, growth rate was a vector of 0s for unaffected strains and
1s for affected strains. Rust coloration was represented by a
vector of 0s for white strains and 1s for M14 and M22, the two
rust-colored strains.

Comparison of expression and DNA sequence data
Significant genes were hierarchically clustered using Cluster
and visualized using Treeview [60]. Groups of functionally
related genes were annotated by hand and are presented in
Figure 2. The microarray images, GenePix gpr files and tabdelimited Cluster files are available on the Faylab homepage
[61].

Growth data
Growth rate was measured as the slope of the regression of
log10 of cell density, as measured by OD600, and log10 of time,
measured in minutes. Although the cell populations followed
a logistic growth curve, copper sulfate treatment affected both
the growth rate and carrying capacity parameters of the logistic growth model. Thus, a simple linear rather than logistic
regression was used.

DNA sequence data
Three genes, HHT2, MBP1 and SUP35, were sequenced using
Big Dye (PerkinElmer) termination sequencing of purified
PCR products, GenBank accession number AY553984AY554008. No polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product
could be obtained from M14 and M32 for the SUP35 gene.
HHT2 on chromosome 14 encodes a histone, SUP35 on chromosome 4 encodes a translation termination factor, and
MBP1 on chromosome 4 encodes a transcription factor functioning in the cell cycle and DNA replication, 455 kb away
from SUP35. The forward and reverse primers for HHT2 were
5'ACCACCTTTACCTCTACCGG and 5'AAATTCCCGCTT-

Divergence in gene expression was measured as the number
of pairwise differences in gene expression among strains.
Because duplicate genes can cross-hybridize on the microarrays, each 70-bp probe was tested for its cross-hybridization
potential. Probes susceptible to cross-hybridization were
identified as those probes with 70% or greater nucleotide
identity to coding sequences other than to the gene the probe
was designed to detect. This cutoff was chosen because many
genes with 70% sequence identity showed little or no correlation in their expression pattern. Of the 731 genes, 66 families
of potentially cross-hybridizing probes were found. Of the 66
families, 44 families only contained one probe among the significant genes and the remaining 26 families contained 158
probes among the significant genes. The largest family was of
71 gag or pol genes present in Ty transposable elements. All
but one member of each potentially cross-hybridizing gene
family was removed. The remaining 599 genes were tested for
pairwise differences in gene expression using a t-test (p <
0.05). Of these, 436 showed at least one or more differences
in gene expression among strains in rich medium, copper sulfate medium or both. A Mantel test showed that these expression differences are significantly associated with DNA
sequence differences (P = 0.043). The slope of the regression
of expression differences on synonymous DNA sequence differences was 5,448. Synonymous DNA sequence differences
were used to estimate the rate of change in gene expression as
amino-acid altering and intergenic rates of divergence are
heavily influenced by purifying selection.

reviews

Pairwise gene-expression differences were obtained from the
131 genes found to differ between the two media treatments
(Figure 6). Of these genes, two clusters were enriched for
genes functioning in protein folding, stress response and carbohydrate metabolism (p < 10-5 [32]). Five genes were
removed because of potentially cross-hybridizing probes, and
of the remainder, 48 genes showed at least one or more pairwise gene-expression difference between strains in either rich
medium, copper sulfate medium, or both (t-test, p < 0.05). A
Mantel test found no significant association between DNA
sequence divergence and the expression differences of these
48 genes between strains (p > 0.05).

comment

DNA sequence differences between strains were unlikely to
affect hybridization. We expect about 0.2 mismatches per 70bp oligonucleotide, given the sequence divergence between
strains at synonymous and amino-acid-altering sites and
given that about 70% of coding sites are amino-acid altering.
Thus, 82% of hybridizations should contain no mismatches.
The remaining probes are not likely to affect the results. After
the removal of potentially cross-hyridizing probes, we found
many expression patterns that were nearly identical, even
though low levels of sequence divergence existed. For example many Ty elements contain one or two mismatches out of
70. Thus, low levels of sequence divergence are unlikely to
affect the results. In addition, S288C expression data could be
removed and we would expect the results to be the same since
the reference pool contains only a small portion of S288C
cDNA.
