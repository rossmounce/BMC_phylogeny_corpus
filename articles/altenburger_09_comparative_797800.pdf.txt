Abstract
Background: Despite significant methodological progress, Brachiopoda remains one of the
lophotrochozoan phyla for which no recent ontogenetic data employing modern methodologies
such as fluorescence labelling and confocal microscopy are available. This is particularly astonishing
given the ongoing controversy concerning its phylogenetic position. In order to contribute new
morphogenetic data for phylogenetic and evolutionary inferences, we describe herein the ontogeny
and myoanatomy of larvae and adults of the rhynchonelliform brachiopods Argyrotheca cordata, A.
cistellula, and Terebratalia transversa using fluorescence F-actin labelling combined with confocal
laserscanning microscopy.
Results: Fully grown larvae of A. cordata and T. transversa consist of three distinct body regions,
namely an apical lobe, a mantle lobe with four bundles of setae, and a pedicle lobe. Myogenesis is
very similar in these two species. The first anlagen of the musculature develop in the pedicle lobe,
followed by setae muscles and the mantle lobe musculature. Late-stage larvae show a network of
strong pedicle muscles, central mantle muscles, longitudinal muscles running from the mantle to
the pedicle lobe, setae pouch muscles, setae muscles, a U-shaped muscle, serial mantle muscles,
and apical longitudinal as well as apical transversal muscles. Fully developed A. cistellula larvae differ
from the former species in that they have only two visible body lobes and lack setae. Nevertheless,
we found corresponding muscle systems to all muscles present in the former two species, except
for the musculature associated with the setae, in larvae of A. cistellula. With our survey of the adult
myoanatomy of A. cordata and A. cistellula and the juvenile muscular architecture of T. transversa we
confirm the presence of adductors, diductors, dorsal and ventral pedicle adjustors, mantle margin
muscles, a distinct musculature of the intestine, and striated muscle fibres in the tentacles for all
three species.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that larvae of rhynchonelliform brachiopods share a common
muscular bodyplan and are thus derived from a common ancestral larval type. Comparison of the
muscular phenotype of rhynchonelliform larvae to that of the other two lophophorate phyla,
Phoronida and Ectoprocta, does not indicate homology of individual larval muscles. This may be
due to an early evolutionary split of the ontogenetic pathways of Brachiopoda, Phoronida, and
Ectoprocta that gave rise to the morphological diversity of these phyla.

Background
Brachiopoda is a small lophophorate phylum with a
prominent fossil record since the Lower Cambrium [1].
More than 12.000 fossil and approximately 380 recent
species are known to date [2,3]. The phylum is commonly
divided into three taxa, the articulate Rhynchonelliformea
and the two inarticulate clades Craniiformea and Linguliformea [4], and has traditionally been grouped together
with Phoronida and Ectoprocta into the superphylum
Lophophorata. However, this classification has recently
been challenged by paleontological and molecular datasets. While some analyses employing morphological data
assign Brachiopoda to Deuterostomia [e.g., [5,6]], recent
molecular data either propose sistergroup relationships to
various spiralian phyla including Mollusca, Annelida, and
Nemertea [7-11], or support the notion that Phoronida
are an ingroup of Brachiopoda [12,13].
Apart from some mainly gross morphological studies [1421], detailed data using modern techniques such as fluorescence labelling and confocal laserscanning microscopy
are not yet available. This is especially true with respect to
the development of the musculature, despite the fact that
myo-anatomical features may provide useful characters
for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships [22,23].
Recently, some data on larval muscle development for the
proposed brachiopod sister groups Phoronida and Ectoprocta have become available [24-28]. Accordingly, larval
myogenesis in Brachiopoda constitutes an important gap
of knowledge in comparative developmental studies on
Lophophorata. With the first thorough, comparative
account of brachiopod larval myogenesis provided herein
for the rhynchonelliform species Argyrotheca cordata
(Risso, 1826), Argyrotheca cistellula (Searles-Wood, 1841),
and Terebratalia transversa (Sowerby, 1846), we aim at
stimulating the discussion concerning lophophorate bodyplan evolution, phylogeny, and development. Furthermore, we contribute to questions concerning the
muscular ground pattern of rhynchonelliform brachiopod larvae. We supplement our ontogenetic data with a
detailed description of the adult muscle systems of all
three species.

Results
Embryonic and larval development of Argyrotheca
cordata
Embryos and larvae of Argyrotheca cordata are brooded by
the mother animal and are released as late-stage larvae
competent to undergo metamorphosis. Accordingly, larval development is entirely lecithotrophic. After cleavage
and gastrulation (Fig. 1A), a three-lobed larva is established, which comprises an anterior apical lobe, a mantle
lobe in the mid-body region, and a posterior pedicle lobe
(Fig. 1B–F). In very early three-lobed stages, the blast-

opore is visible at the base of the apical lobe (Fig. 1B). This
larval mouth closes during subsequent larval development (Fig. 1D).
The apical lobe is ciliated and bears, in early three lobed
stages, an apical tuft which is lost in later stages (Fig. 1B,
D). When the three lobes are fully established, four bundles of larval setae are formed at the posterior margin of
the mantle lobe (Fig. 1E). Finally, in larvae competent to
undergo metamorphosis, the anlage of the pedicle
becomes visible as a distinct primordial hump at the posterior pole of the pedicle lobe (Fig. 1F).
Myogenesis and adult myoanatomy of Argyrotheca
cordata
The larvae investigated were about 230–270 μm long and
210–240 μm wide. The first F-actin-positive signal is visible as distinct spots in the area that later forms the mantle
lobe (Fig. 2A). These distinct spots are F-actin-positive
microvilli which are situated in the lower part of the setal
sacs where the setae are formed [cf. [29]]. The strong fluorescence signal of the microvilli disappears once setae formation is completed, due to the increasing predominance
of the larval musculature (Fig. 2D–F).

The pedicle muscles start to form in three-lobed larvae
that still lack setae (Fig. 2B). In older larvae with short
setae (corresponding to the stage shown in Fig. 1E), setae
muscles start to develop. These run from the setal pouches
in anterior direction and connect to the apical longitudinal muscles at the border between apical and mantle lobe
(lateral setae muscles) or to the central mantle muscles
(dorsal setae muscles), respectively (Fig. 2C). The apical
longitudinal muscles extend laterally within the apical
lobe and terminate anteriorly at an apical transversal muscle (Fig. 2C). At this stage, longitudinal muscles are also
found within the pedicle lobe. From there, they run into
the mantle lobe, where they connect to longitudinal muscles which originate at the muscle interconnection point
at the border between apical and mantle lobe. The larval
gut rudiment is visible as a tube in the centre of the larvae
(Fig. 2C).
In fully developed larvae, setae pouch muscles are established and interconnected by a circular mantle muscle
(Fig. 2D). From this circular mantle muscle emerge serial
mantle muscles, which are dorsolaterally closed by the
central mantle muscles. The central mantle muscles are
connected to the dorsal setae muscles and to the apical
longitudinal muscles at the border of the apical and the
mantle lobe (Fig. 2E–F). Anteroventrally, the serial mantle
muscles are enclosed by a U-shaped muscle which extends
ventrally from the pedicle muscles towards the circular
mantle muscle (Fig. 2D–F; see also additional file 1). The
primordial hump is devoid of any musculature (Fig. 2E–
F).

Adult A. cordata studied were 0.8–1.3 mm wide and 0.9–
1.4 mm long. We can confirm four pairs of muscles which
have been described previously [30]. These are one pair of
adductors and one pair of diductors, which attach to both
the dorsal and to the ventral valve. In addition, there are
two pairs of pedicle adjustors, one of which being
attached to the ventral valve and the pedicle, and one
being attached to the dorsal valve and the pedicle (Fig.
3A–B). In addition, we found a distinct musculature in the
tentacles of the lophophore and in the digestive system.
Each tentacle contains several bands of striated muscle
fibers (Fig. 3D–E), while the stomach and intestine are
each lined by numerous delicate ring muscles (Fig. 3C).
Moreover, minute muscles are distributed along the dorsal and ventral mantle margin, which probably function
as mantle retractor muscles. These mantle retractors are
abundant and are oriented perpendicularly to the mantle
margin that lines the shell (Fig. 3A–B).
Myogenesis and adult myoanatomy of Argyrotheca
cistellula
Similar to Argyrotheca cordata, larvae of A. cistellula are lecithotrophic and are brooded by the mother animal. A. cistellula larvae lack setae and the mantle lobe encloses the
pedicle lobe during development. Thus, the fully developed larvae have only two visible lobes, namely the apical
and the mantle lobe. The investigated larvae were around
117–139 μm long and 78–104 μm wide. The first muscles
appear in larvae with all lobes fully differentiated. These
are two dorsal mantle muscles which extend dorsally from
anterior to posterior in the mantle lobe (Fig. 4A). Parallel
and further lateral to these dorsal mantle muscles run the
early lateral mantle muscles, and the first rudiments of the
serial mantle muscles arise at this stage in the mantle lobe.
These develop subsequently into a network of muscles
that extends dorsally and ventrally from the two lateral
mantle muscles (Fig. 4A–F). These lateral mantle muscles
connect to the apical longitudinal muscles at the anterior
pole and to the posterior muscle ring at the posterior pole
of the larvae (Fig 4B–F). During subsequent development,
the ventral mantle muscles and the pedicle muscles
emerge (Fig. 4C). The pedicle muscles, situated in the centre of the mantle lobe, are the most prominent muscles in
fully grown larvae (Fig. 4D). They connect to the apical
longitudinal muscles, which in turn are in contact with
the apical transversal muscles. The latter form a muscle
ring in the apical lobe (Fig. 4E–F). The musculature of
fully developed larvae includes the pedicle muscles, which
are connected to the apical longitudinal muscles, the ventral mantle muscles, and the dorsal mantle muscles that
connect to the pedicle muscles. Furthermore, serial mantle muscles, which extend dorsally and ventrally from the
lateral mantle muscles, are present. Ventrally, the serial
mantle muscles terminate at the ventral mantle muscles
(Fig. 4F).

Similar to the condition found in Argyrotheca cordata, four
pairs of shell muscles are found in adult A. cistellula (Fig.
5). One pair of shell adductors attaches medially to the
dorsal and to the ventral valve (Fig. 5). Two pairs of pedicle adjustors extend posterior into the pedicle, whereby
one attaches to the dorsal and one to the ventral valve.
Finally, one pair of diductors attaches at the posterior end
of the ventral valve and runs to the dorsal valve.
Each tentacle of the lophophore contains a number of striated muscle fibres. Mantle margin muscles are arranged
perpendicularly to the shell periphery along the edge of
the dorsal and the ventral valve (Fig. 5A–B).
Myogenesis, metamorphosis, and juvenile myoanatomy of
Terebratalia transversa
Larvae of Terebratalia transversa are lecithotrophic and
develop for approximately four days at 11°C in the water
column until they are competent to undergo metamorphosis. The investigated larvae were three-lobed, 120–178
μm long and 94–141 μm wide, whereby the pedicle lobe
was partly overgrown by the mantle lobe. The first developing muscles are the pedicle muscles and early rudiments of the serial mantle muscles (Fig. 6A). Thereafter,
the musculature of the four setae pouches forms (Fig. 6B).
In later stages, the setae pouch muscles interconnect with
the circular mantle muscle (Fig. 6C). A U-shaped muscle
extends on the ventral side of the larvae from the pedicle
muscles towards the circular mantle muscle. The serial
mantle muscles and the setae muscles span between the
circular mantle muscle and the U-shaped muscle strand.
The latter run from the setae pouches to the central mantle
muscles (Fig. 6D). The central mantle muscles extend
from the dorsal setae muscles, which run from the dorsal
setae pouches towards the apical lobe. They connect to the
apical longitudinal muscles at the border of the apical and
the mantle lobe (Fig. 6D). Subsequently, the apical musculature develops, which consists of an apical transversal
muscle and two lateral apical longitudinal muscles that
are connected to the serial mantle muscles (Fig. 6E). In
late three-lobed larvae, the pedicle muscles are, together
with the central mantle muscles, the most prominent
muscular structures. The central mantle muscles connect
to the serial mantle muscles, the setae pouch muscles, the
setae muscles, and the apical musculature (Fig. 6F).

During metamorphosis, parts of the larval musculature
appear to get resorbed and juvenile muscles develop (Fig.
7A). We were, however, unable to clarify whether or not
certain components of the larval musculature are incorporated into the juvenile muscular bodyplan.
The juvenile musculature comprises early rudiments of
the tentacle muscles, early rudiments of the mantle margin musculature, the musculature of the intestine, adduc-

tors, ventral pedicle adjustors which are connected to the
diductors, and dorsal pedicle adjustors (Fig. 7B–D).

Discussion
Comparison of larval and adult rhynchonelliform
myoanatomy
The gross morphology of Argyrotheca cistellula differs considerably from that of A. cordata and Terebratalia transversa
in that the pedicle lobe gets enclosed by the mantle lobe
during development [19]. Thus, A. cistellula appears twolobed and lacks setae, while the other two species express
three distinct body lobes and setae. Despite these differences, myogenesis follows a similar pattern in all three
species (Table 1). When fully developed, prominent pedicle muscles, apical longitudinal as well as apical transversal muscles, and serial mantle muscles are present in all
three species. In addition, A. cordata and T. transversa
show a circular mantle muscle which we consider homologous to the posterior muscle ring in A. cistellula. This
homology is based on the similar position of this muscle
in the mantle lobe and the fact that the U-shaped muscle
of A. cordata and T. transversa and the ventral mantle muscles of A. cistellula all insert at this muscle. The central
mantle muscles of A. cordata and T. transversa are in our
opinion homologous to the dorsal mantle muscles of A.
cistellula due to the similar position of these muscles and
their connection to the apical and the serial mantle muscles in all three species. The U-shaped muscle of A. cordata
and T. transversa corresponds to the ventral mantle muscles in A. cistellula due to their similar position and the fact
that these muscles enclose the serial mantle muscles
antero-ventrally.

Despite these similarities, we found distinct differences in
the myoanatomy of the three species investigated. As
such, the setae pouch muscles, the setae muscles, and the
longitudinal muscles, which run from the mantle lobe to
the pedicle lobe, are only present in A. cordata and T. transversa, while the lateral mantle muscles are only present in
larvae of A. cistellula. These differences between A. cistellula on the one hand and A. cordata and T. transversa on
the other correspond to the gross morphological observation that A. cistellula lacks setae.
Larval setae in brachiopods have been proposed to function as a defence device and to control buoyancy [31]. The
setae of A. cistellula larvae have probably been secondarily
lost, as these larvae are brooded and may settle shortly
after release from the mother animal. However, A. cordata
larvae have retained their setae despite being brooded,
which may hint towards an extended planktonic period of
these larvae.
The muscles in the pedicle lobe have been proposed earlier to be of functional use during metamorphosis

[32,33]. When larvae settle, a glandular region at the tip of
the primordial hump functions as site of attachment to
the substrate [34]. Subsequently, the primordial hump
forms the first rudiment of the juvenile pedicle. After larval settlement, the mantle lobe is inverted over the apical
lobe and eventually forms the juvenile mantle. The apical
lobe gets enclosed by the valves and forms the lophophore and all anterior adult structures [32,35]. At the
onset of metamorphosis, the U-shaped muscle may, due
to its connection to the pedicle muscles and the circular
mantle muscle, aid in inverting the mantle lobe. During
metamorphosis, the larval pedicle muscles are still present
at the time of ventral pedicle adjustor and diductor formation. However, whether the larval pedicle muscles are
resorbed or are (partly) incorporated into the juvenile
diductor and/or pedal adjustor muscles could not be clarified by the present study.
Argyrotheca cordata is the sole species from this study for
which data on the larval myoanatomy had previously
been available. In the first descriptions from 1873 and
1883, "muscles abdominaux", that run from the pedicle
lobe into the mantle lobe, had been identified [14,30]. A
different description was given slightly later, when a network of muscles in the fully developed larva was
described. The muscles were denoted "Muskel des lateralen Borstenbündels", "Muskel des medialen Borstenbündels", "musculus contractor", "musculus rotator
dorsalis", and "musculus abductor" [15]. Our findings
confirm the results of the first papers with respect to the
pedicle muscles and the setae muscles. However, in our
specimens, the pedicle muscles were not directly connected to the setae muscles as depicted in the first descriptions, but were instead connected to the U-shaped muscle.
In adult Argyrotheca cordata, four pairs of muscles had
been identified previously [30]. The pair of adductor muscles has two insertion sites, one anterior to the other at the
dorsal valve, and an additional one at the ventral valve.
The pair of diductor muscles inserts at the posterior part
of both the ventral and the dorsal valve. One of the two
pairs of adjustors inserts at the ventral valve and the pedicle, while the other pair inserts at the dorsal valve and the
pedicle [30].
The muscular systems of adult A. cordata and A. cistellula
are similar to each other and comprise one pair of adductors, two pairs of pedicle adjustors and one pair of diductors. The tentacles contain several fibres of striated
musculature which have previously been described as
"rows of striated fusiform myoepithelial cells" in the
lophophore of T. transversa [36].
For the juvenile musculature of Terebratalia transversa we
followed the nomenclature used by Eshleman and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/3

Wilkens [37]. The juvenile musculature, five days after
metamorphosis, comprises rudiments of the tentacle
muscles, rudiments of the mantle margin musculature,
one pair of adductors, one pair of diductors, one pair of
dorsal, and one pair of ventral pedicle adjustors. The ventral pedicle adjustors are connected to the diductors in the
juvenile.
Comparative myogenesis of Lophophorata
For the Phoronida, data on muscle development are currently available for three species, namely Phoronis pallida,
P. harmeri, and P. architecta [24,26,27]. The larvae of these
species are of the actinotroch-type and differ considerably
from brachiopod larvae in both their gross anatomy and
in their lifestyle, because these phoronid larvae are planktotrophic, while the brachiopod larvae investigated herein
are of the typical three-lobed, lecithotrophic type. Accordingly, a considerable part of the larval phoronid musculature is linked to the digestive system (e.g., the oesophageal
ring muscles) and to the maintenance of a cylindrical
body shape (e.g., a meshwork of circular and longitudinal
muscles in the bodywall). In addition, trunk retractor
muscles, that originate from the posterior collar ring muscles and insert in the telotrochal region, are present in
phoronid larvae [27]. The collar region contains mainly
ring muscles and few longitudinal muscles. The subumbrellar and exumbrellar layers of the hood contain circular
muscles and a series of longitudinal muscles, which, in
the exumbrellar layer, function as hood elevators [27].
Furthermore, the tentacles of phoronid actinotroch larvae
contain elevator and depressor muscles which consist of
two loops in the elevators and a single loop in the depressors. These tentacle muscles are interconnected by the ring
muscle of the collar [27]. We did not identify any muscles
in the larvae of the three brachiopod species described
herein that could potentially correspond to the actinotroch muscle systems known so far.

The muscular architecture in ectoproct larvae is very
diverse, thus following the high plasticity of larval gross
morphology and the notion that lecithotrophic larvae
might have evolved up to six times within Ectoprocta [38].
To date, the larval muscular systems have been described
for Membranipora membranacea (cyphonautes larva), Flustrellidra hispida (pseudocyphonautes larva), Celleporaria
sherryae and Schizoporella floridana (both coronate larva),
Bowerbankia gracilis (vesiculariform larva), Bugula stolonium and B. fulva (both buguliform larva), Sundanella
sibogae, Nolella stipata, Amathia vidovici, Aeverrillia setigera,
and Alcyonidium gelatinosum (all ctenostome larva), and
Crisia elongata (cyclostome larva) [25,28]. Recently, a
number of homologies have been proposed for various
larval ectoproct muscle systems [25]. These are the coronal ring muscle, which underlies the ciliated, ring-shaped
swimming organ of most larval types, the anterior median

which in turn forms a muscle ring in the apical lobe. The ventral mantle muscles (empty arrows) and dorsal mantle muscles
(empty arrowhead) are also connected to the pedicle muscles. The serial mantle muscles (double arrowhead) extend dorsally
and ventrally from the lateral mantle muscles (lmm). The latter terminate at the posterior muscle ring (arrow).

muscle, which runs anteriorly from ventral to dorsal in
most species, lateral muscles, which project laterally in
dorso-ventral direction in most larvae, longitudinal muscles along the posterior body axis, and transversal muscles, which are situated transversally in the central body
region of F. hispida, M. membranacea, and A. gelatinosum.
Besides these proposed homologous muscles, each larval
type shows unique muscles in the body wall and/or inside
the larval body, reflecting at least partly the functional
adaptations to a planktotrophic versus a lecithotrophic
lifestyle. No muscles corresponding to any of the ectoproct muscle types were found in the brachiopod species
investigated in this study (and noticeably no homologous
muscles between the lecithotrophic ectoproct and brachiopod larval types could be identified), again demonstrating the high plasticity of lophophorate larval anatomy.

cles, setae muscles, and a U-shaped muscle. However, a
final statement can only be made once data on the musculature of theceid and rhynchonellid larvae become
available.
Comparing this proposed larval muscular groundpattern
to the hitherto investigated phoronids, ectoprocts, and
spiralian taxa such as polychaetes, molluscs,
plathelminths or entoprocts does not reveal any homologies of larval brachiopod muscles and the muscles of other
lophotrochozoan larvae, regardless of whether the respective larvae are lecithotrophic or planktotrophic [23,4147]. From these data we conclude that the ontogenetic
pathways of the individual lophophorate phyla have split
early in evolution from that of other Lophotrochozoa,
which then resulted in the wide morphological diversity
of larval and adult lophophorate bodyplans.

Conclusion
All rhynchonelliform brachiopod larvae studied to date
are three-lobed with four bundles of setae [39], except for
the larva of Argyrotheca cistellula, which is externally
bilobed and lacks setae, and the three-lobed thecideid larvae, which likewise lack setae [40]. Despite these gross
morphological differences, myogenesis in the three brachiopod species investigated is very similar. Thus, we propose
a
larval
muscular
groundpattern
for
rhynchonelliform brachiopods comprising apical longitudinal muscles, apical transversal muscles, circular mantle
muscles, central mantle muscles, longitudinal muscles,
serial mantle muscles, pedicle muscles, setae pouch mus-

Methods
Animal collection and fixation
Argyrotheca cordata and A. cistellula
Adults were obtained from encrusting coralline red algae
(coralligène), which was collected in the vicinity of the
Observatoire Océanologique de Banyuls-sur-mer, France
(42°29'27.51" N; 3°08'07.67" E), by SCUBA from 30–40
m depth in July 2002 and June 2007. All developmental
stages from unfertilized eggs to fully differentiated larvae
were obtained by dissection from the adults. The specimens were relaxed at room temperature in 7.14% MgCl2,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate

buffer (PB) for 2 hours or for 3–5 hours, and subsequently
washed thrice with 0.1 M PB for 15 min each. The samples
were stored in 0.1 M PB with 0.1% NaN3 at 4°C. Material
fixed for 2 hours was used for immunocytochemistry
(ICC) and material fixed for 3–5 hours was used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Terebratalia transversa
Adults were collected in the San Juan Archipelago, USA, in
the vicinity of the Friday Harbor Laboratories, and were
kept in running seawater tables. To obtain larvae, females
were dissected and their eggs transferred into beaker
glasses with filtered seawater. The seawater was changed
several times in order to wash off follicle cells, and the
eggs were left overnight for germinal vesicle breakdown.
Males were opened and left in filtered seawater overnight.
Thereafter, their testes were scraped out, macerated, and
diluted with filtered seawater to obtain a sperm suspen-

sion. Prior to fertilization, sperm cells were activated by
adding three drops of a 1 M Tris buffer solution (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to approximately 50 ml of
sperm suspension. Larvae were maintained in embryo
dishes at around 11°C and the filtered seawater was
changed twice daily. Free swimming larvae, metamorphic
stages, and juveniles five days after metamorphosis were
relaxed in 7.14% MgCl2 and fixed in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB
for 30 min at room temperature. Larvae were washed
thrice for 15 min in 0.1 M PB and stored in 0.1 M PB with
0.1% NaN3 at 4°C.
Scanning electron microscopy
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the specimens
were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, critical point dried, and sputter coated with
gold. Digital images were acquired using a LEO 1430 VP
SEM (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

F-actin labelling, confocal laserscanning microscopy
(CLSM), and 3D reconstruction
Prior to staining, larvae were washed thrice for 15 min in
PB and incubated for 1 h in PB containing 0.1% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) to permeabilize the tissue. Then, the
specimens were incubated in 1:40 diluted Alexa Fluor 488
phalloidin (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA) and 3 μg/ml DAPI (Invitrogen) in the permeabilization solution overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, specimens
were washed thrice for 15 min in 0.1 M PB and embedded
in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL,
USA) on glass slides. The same procedure was used for
juveniles and adults, with the addition of a decalcifying
step using 0.05 M EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature overnight prior to permeabilization and staining.
Negative controls omitting the phalloidin dye were performed on all species in order to avoid potential misinterpretations caused by autofluorescence.

The samples were analysed with a Leica DM RXE 6 TL fluorescence microscope equipped with a TCS SP2 AOBS
laserscanning device (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Animals were scanned at intervals of 0.49 μm or
0.64 μm, respectively, and the resulting image stacks were
merged into maximum projection images. Photoshop
CS3 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to create overlay
images of CLSM and light micrographs and for assembling the figure plates. 3D reconstruction was performed
on CLSM datasets using volume rendering algorithms of
the graphics software Imaris 5.7.2 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).
