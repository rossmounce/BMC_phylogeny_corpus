Evolutionary fitness as a function of pubertal age
in 22 subsistence-based traditional societies
Ze’ev Hochberg1*, Aneta Gawlik1,2 and Robert S Walker3

Abstract
Context: The age of puberty has fallen over the past 130 years in industrialized, western countries, and this fall is
widely referred to as the secular trend for earlier puberty. The current study was undertaken to test two
evolutionary theories: (a) the reproductive system maximizes the number of offspring in response to positive
environmental cues in terms of energy balance, and (b) early puberty is a trade-off response for high mortality rate
and reduced resource availability.
Methods: Using a sample of 22 natural-fertility societies of mostly tropical foragers, horticulturalists, and pastoralists
from Africa, South America, Australia, and Southeastern Asia, this study compares indices of adolescence growth
and menarche with those of fertility fitness in these non-industrial, traditional societies.
Results: The average age at menarche correlated with the first reproduction, but did not correlate with the total
fertility rate TFR or reproductive fitness. The age at menarche correlated negatively with their average adult body
mass, and the average adult body weight positively correlated with reproductive fitness. Survivorship did not
correlate with the age at menarche or age indices of the adolescent growth spurt. The population density
correlated positively with the age at first reproduction, but not with menarche age, TFR, or reproductive fitness.
Conclusions: Based on our analyses, we reject the working hypotheses that reproductive fitness is enhanced in
societies with early puberty or that early menarche is an adaptive response to greater mortality risk. Whereas body
mass is a measure of resources is tightly associated with fitness, the age of menarche is not.

Introduction
The age of puberty has fallen over the past 130 years in
industrialized, western countries, where menarche age
has receded from 16.5 years in 1880 to the current 12.5
years in western societies; this decline has occurred concomitantly with an improvement in child health [1]. The
progressively declining age of thelarche and menarche
may have multiple explanations. Primates’ studies suggest a role for prenatal androgens and social factors
(like the social rank) [2,3]. In the last decade, a popular
notion among investigators is that early puberty may
result from environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), thus accelerating hypothalamic
maturation [4]. Whereas EDC may have a bearing on
the earlier age of thelarche, evolutionary forces may add

a new angel to explain the secular trend in the age of
menarche over the last 130 years. Even though the age
at menarche is strongly linked to genetic variations [5],
the time course of the secular trend suggests strong
environmental influence.
This secular trend for early onset of puberty is a topic of
much research interest. This trend was recently examined
from a life-history evolutionary perspective, and we previously suggested that transition from juvenility to adolescence is a period of adaptive plasticity [6,7]. Two models
have been proposed to explain this adaptation. Gluckman
and Hanson suggested that life-history strategies for
greater reproductive fitness (a product of the fertility rate
and survivorship) could account for the current early
onset of puberty [8]. The declining age of pubertal development have both been proposed as an adaptive response
to positive environmental cues in terms of energy balance
[7]. The assumption is that the reproductive system maximizes the number of offspring by balancing the benefit of
more births against the costs of maternal mortality. With

respect to puberty, women face a trade-off between spending a long time accumulating resources through childhood
growth and weight gain in order to improve the likelihood
for successful pregnancy, against an early-age reproduction
in order to increase the number of reproductive cycles.
Indeed, heavy women in pre-industrial societies are more
fertile, and both increased body weight and fertility are
correlated with high birth rates [9]. This trade-off model
has been used to predict that 18 years is the optimal age
for first birth, which is near the observed average 17.5
years in such societies [10].
A different evolutionary trade-off was suggested by
Migliano et al [11]. Based on analysis of the stature,
growth, and reproductive fitness for the Aeta and the
Batak pygmy from the Philippines, they argued that that
the small body size of pygmy populations is an adaptation that evolved as the result of a life history tradeoff
between the fertility benefits of a large body size against
the costs of late growth cessation, under the circumstances of significant young and adult mortality. They
showed that the small pygmy body size evolved through
the early onset age of juvenility and adolescence [12],
and suggested early cessation of growth is a trade-off for
high mortality rate and reduced resource availability.
Thus, short life expectancy may be initially a determinant of early puberty but subsequently, early puberty as

Page 2 of 7

an adaptive response may determine longer lifespan due
to reduced adult size and resource need.
The present study was designed to explore these two
hypotheses. To this end, it takes an inter-population
approach that compares indices of adolescence (menarche,
and the growth spurt) with those of fertility fitness in nonindustrial, traditional societies. Using a sample of 22 natural-fertility societies of mostly tropical foragers, horticulturalists, and pastoralists from Africa, South America,
Australia, and Southeastern Asia, we hypothesized that (a)
early adolescence would be associated with greater reproductive fitness or (b) with mortality risk, and predicted
that the age at menarche and indices of pubertal growth
will (a) negatively correlate with fertility rate or (b) positively correlate with survivorship. Although the reproductive and life history strategies of males and females are
quite distinct in these societies, similar considerations
might apply to the males, for which we included indices of
adolescent growth spurt in our study.

Statistical analyses

Linear regression analyses with 95% confidence intervals
of outcome as a function of IBI were performed using Statistica 6.0. For these analyses, the average of each study
parameter for each society was a single point in the regression analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to determine whether statistical differences exist
between the study parameters in the 22 studied societies.
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Results
The age at menarche correlated positively with the age
at first reproduction (r = 0.762, p < 0.001), and the average duration between the two events was four years
(Figure 1). When we tested the hypothesis that early
adolescence is associated with increased reproductive fitness, the age at menarche and the growth indices (age at
takeoff, peak velocity, and the return to weight and
height takeoff velocity) did not correlate with the IBI
(Table 2). The age at menarche did not correlate with
TFR or reproductive fitness (NS: r = -0.208, p = 0.440; r
= -0.008, p = 0.983, respectively), whereas the age at
first reproduction correlated positively with the age at
height spurt takeoff (r = 0.794, p = 0.003; Figure 2),
peak height velocity (r = 0.791, p = 0.011), and return to
takeoff height velocity (r = 0.765, p = 0.027), but TFR
and reproductive fitness did not correlate with any of
these variables (Table 2).

html as compiled by one of us (RSW) from previous
reports [14-16] and sources therein. In these societies,
the age of menarche ranged from 12.6-18.4, and the age
at growth spurt takeoff ranged from 10-13.5 years.
The stages of puberty were determined in girls of each
society by the mean age of menarche, by the adolescent
takeoff height velocity, peak height velocity, and for the
end of puberty - the return to weight and height takeoff
velocities. Indices of fertility in each society were determined from the average age at first reproduction, the
interbirth interval (IBI, by self report), and total fertility
rate (TFR). Reproductive fitness was calculated per
society from the population average survivorship to age
15 (L15, range 0.33-0.80) and the TFR (range 2.6-9.0),
TFR*L15, as previously suggested [17]. Mortality risk
was determined from the survivorship to age 15 and life
expectancy at birth (range 24.3-47.5) and age 15 (range
29.6-47.0).
At the time of data collection, ethical approval was
considered not required, and the authors had no access
to individuals’ data.

menarche or age indices of the adolescent growth spurt
(Table 2). Adding survivorship to a multivariate analysis
for age at menarche or age at first reproduction as a

When the societies were categorizing societies by their
ecology, dwellers of the tropical forest, the neotropical
forest, and the savanna had comparable ages at
menarche and reproductive fitness. Of the studied societies, the TFR was highest among dwellers of neotropical
forests (8.3 ± 0.6), as compared to those in the savanna
(6.5 ± 0.7) and the tropical forests (5.4 ± 1.7, p = 0.015;
Table 3). When the societies were categorized by their
economy type, the age at menarche, TFR, and reproductive fitness were not significantly different between the
farmers-foragers, the foragers, and the mixed-economy
groups (results not shown).

their respective population density. The population density correlated positively with the women’s age at first

menarche age, TFR, or reproductive fitness (Table 2).
Adolescent age and survivorship expectancy

When we tested the hypothesis that early adolescence
and small body size is a trade-off for high mortality risk,

Discussion
In considering human adolescence in the context of
evolutionary fitness, we considered key traits that were
available from data collected in 1967-1988. These
include the age of menarche, the pattern and timing of
the adolescent growth spurt, the body size, and the
determinants of reproductive fitness, namely the age of
the first reproduction, the IBI, the number of progeny,
and mortality risk [18]. The database contains no information on birth size, which may influence the age at
menarche. Extended growth and large body size in
humans prompt fertility gains and reduced offspring
mortality [19]. Consequently there is a pressure for
delayed reproductive onset, whereas early reproduction
minimizes the likelihood of death before reproduction.
Several limitations of this approach require consideration. i. By nature of this approach, comparing population
level averages and attributing differences to ecological
differences may not be straightforward. It assumes that
the relationships observed would be the same if examined at an individual level [20]. In their report, Greenland
and Robin construct several epidemiological examples
that show that data at the ecologic level can be misinterpreted if nonlinear effects at the individual level, and
other confounds, are not accounted for. Such data for the
individual level were not available to us. ii. Comparative
studies across societies may also suffer from problems of
phylogenetic non-independence. This was addressed for
these data previously by adjusting for geographical location (Africa, South America, Australia and Southeast
Asia), but the effect was very weak and not significant in
any of the multiple regressions [13].

Pubertal timing is not a univocal parameter; secular
changes may occur differently for some pubertal events.
Whereas the age of thelarche has reduced in the last
decades, changes in menarche have been more subtle
and mental maturation - deferred. Also, it is not clear
that menarche is a good proxy for fecundity. The age at
first reproduction in the present study strongly correlated with menarche, but the potential role of anovulatory menstrual cycles after menarche and potential nonlinearity of this trend remain options. For example, it is

possible that girls who differ on age at menarche may
be similar with regard to age of fecundity; earlier
menarche may relate to a greater number of anovulatory
cycles [21], and indeed, regular (ovulatory) cycling was
shown to follow a secular trend towards delay as
opposed to early menarche [22].
The data show that at natural fertility, early adolescence in girls, as assessed by the age of menarche and
the growth pattern, corresponds to a young age with the
first reproduction occurring about four years later, as

previously suggested [23]. However, based on our analyses, we reject the two working hypotheses: reproductive fitness is enhanced in societies with early puberty
[8] and early menarche is an adaptive response to
greater mortality risk [11].
We focus here on subsistence-based societies because
most resources are invested as somatic capital in terms
of growth, body size and fertility (reproductive fitness),
as opposed to stored and inherited wealth [15]. The
relative contribution of biological and behavioral factors
in determining natural fertility change with the environment. Environmental factors to consider in an interpopulation study include the physical environment (e.g.,
population density), the biological environment (e.g.,
food availability, disease, and other mortality risks) and
social behaviors (e.g., age at marriage) [15]. We defined
reproductive fitness as a function of TFR and L15, as
previously suggested [17]; these two variables were
selected among other because information on these two
parameters was available for almost all of the societies
in the database. The age at menarche did not correlate
with TFR or reproductive fitness. Whereas reproduction
starts early in societies in which puberty occurs early, in
the context of high population density [19], their reproductive fitness does not increase. The dwellers of the
neotropical forests have a high TFR, but given their
mortality risk, they have comparable reproductive fitness
to the other ecology groups.
We confirm a previous assertion for greater reproductive fitness among heavier, better-nourished traditional
societies [9,24]. When considered as a whole, we found
that the average adult body weight, but not height, correlated negatively with age at menarche and the age at first
reproduction, and positively with reproductive fitness.
The BMI may not work as well in the extremes of size; in
very small or very tall populations the BMI is not as
accurate as it is in average size populations. Even though,
these findings provide indirect support to the hypothesis
that early puberty among girls who live in affluent and
developed countries is a response to a positive energy
balance. Indeed, among contemporary girls in developing
countries, the age at menarche among the prosperous is
earlier than that of the underpriviledged [1].
Based on the high mortality rates of the Philippine
pygmy, Migliano et al suggested that early fertility is
part of the “fast” extreme of life history strategies to
which the pygmy adapt [25], with both longevity and
resource availability as limiting factors [11]. Indeed,
early life stress is associated with premature juvenility
and adolescence [1,12,26]. The results of the present
study do not confirm the fast life history theory; we
found no correlation between adult height and the age
of menarche with survivorship. Yet, population density
correlated with the age of first reproduction, in addition

Page 6 of 7

to our previous assertion that body size in a traditional
society was dependent upon the population density [19].
We have previously suggested that population density
acts through two pathways - nutritional constraints and
juvenile mortality - at varying intensities, and can contribute to a nearly twofold range in body size across
human societies [19]. The sample of the present study
includes two African pygmy groups - the Baka (West
pygmy) and the Efe (East pygmy), both of whom are not
consistent with the Migliano risk/early fertility model.
The average age of menarche and age at first reproduction in these two societies, 14.5 and 15.5, respectively
18.5 and 19, respectively, were close to those of all of
the other studied societies [13].
The secular trend for an early age of menarche has
been rapid over the past 130 years in developed countries [27]. This trend is rightly interpreted as a reflection
of improved nutrition and health in childhood [18]. Life
history theory postulates tradeoffs of current versus
future reproduction and fertility versus mortality risk.
Life-history modeling predicted that a reduction in juvenile mortality reduces the age of menarche [8] or that
low survivorship accelerates the life history [11]. Given
the close interaction between resource availability and
reproduction, we anticipated that those environmental
factors that determine late metabolic homeostasis,
attainment of adult size and cessation of growth would
interface with those influencing the timing of sexual
maturation. The data do not support these predictions.
Whereas body mass as a measure of resources is tightly
associated with fitness in these traditional societies, the
age of menarche is not. Thus, it may be that women’s
physiology tracks its own condition in such a way as to
maximize their individual fitness.
