Abstract
Background: Little is known about the detailed phylogeny relationships of CRF 02_AG HIV-1
polymerase genes in Ghana. The use of the protease gene of HIV-1 for subtyping has shown
conflicting results.
Methods: The partial polymerase gene sequences of 25 HIV-1 strains obtained with Viroseq
reagents were aligned with reference subtypes and alignments trimmed to a 300 bp protease, 661
bp and 1005 reverse transcriptase sequence alignments. Phylogenetic relationships of these
alignments were determined with the Neighbour-Joining method using 1000 replicates and
recombination patterns determined for the sequences with RIP 3.0 in the HIV sequence database.
Results: Unlike the other alignments, the protease gene had nodes with bootstrap values < 100%
for repeat control sequences. Majority of the CRF 02_AG sequences from Ghana were made up
of fragments of several strains of CRF 02_AG/AG strains. The protease gene alone is not suitable
for phylogenetic analysis.
Conclusion: The polymerase genes of HIV-1 strains from Ghana are made up of recombinants of
several CRF 02_AG strains from Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon, but the clinical implications are
unknown. Using the HIV-1 protease gene for subtyping will not infer subtypes correctly.

Introduction
HIV-1 strains can be divided into three genetic groups (M,
N and O) with the group M further divided into 9 pure
subtypes [1-3]. Recombination has however led to the circulation of mosaic HIV-1 strains, and these include the
circulation of circulating recombinant forms (CRF) which
play an important role in the epidemic [4-9].

Several studies have used the polymerase (pol), protease
(prot.), and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes for phylogeny
[9-19]. Also, the pol gene has been shown to be useful for
subtyping in areas with multiple subtypes [17]. In settings
where the CRF 02_AG is found, fragments of the RT gene
have been shown to provide a useful method for HIV-1
subtyping [9,12,14,15,17,18]. However, there are con-

flicting reports on the usefulness of the prot. gene for subtype classification [12,14,15,18].
In Ghana, the predominant subtype for the prot. gene is
most likely to be CRF 02 AG [14]. Furthermore, it has
recently been shown with HIV-1 envelope-glycoprotein
gene (env-gp41) and pol sequences that most HIV-1 strains
do not have strong phylogenetic relationships with each
other [20,21], suggesting an extremely variable relationship between strains. Since the role of subtypes and
recombinants in primary resistance to antiretroviral drugs
is still evolving and therefore unclear, subtyping of all
HIV-1 strains will be needed with resistance testing for
patients failing therapy in countries with non-subtype B
strains. With the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy in
Ghana, there is an increased need to perform resistance
testing for patients adhering to treatment, but still have
elevated viral loads despite prolonged therapy. Since commercial kits like the ABI/Celera ViroSeq reagents (Celera
Diagnostics, Foster City, CA) are expensive for drug resistance testing [11], the likelihood is that in-house assays
will be developed for the prot. and partial RT regions and
these fragments will also be used for subtype classification.
This study therefore determined the suitability of using
the prot. and partial RT gene fragments of CRF 02_AG/AGlike sequences from Ghana which could be used for drug
resistance testing, for subtype classification. The purity of
the HIV-1 strains with respect to CRF 02_AG/AG-like
strains involved in recombination were also looked at.

Methods
Sequencing of polymerase gene
Sequences from 25 patients infected with HIV-1 who
attended the Fevers Unit at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, in 2003 were used for this study. The
drug resistance mutations have been published recently
[21]. Polymerase (pol) gene sequences were obtained
using the ABI/Celera ViroSeq reagents (Celera Diagnostics, Foster City, CA) and this has been described elsewhere [11]. The nucleotide sequence data have been
submitted to the NCBI database [GenBank: EF174555 to
EF174569 and EF550529 to EF550538].
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequence homology of the 25 sequences (GHN
sequences) was done with the HIV Blast Search in the HIV
sequence database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/hivdb/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html with a pair wise comparison. The sequences with the highest homology (n =
13) to the GHN sequences were aligned with HIV-1 reference subtypes and the 25 sequences obtained from Ghana
using the Clustal W software in BioEdit version 5.0.6 ftp:/
/iubio.bio.indiana.edu/molbio/seqpup/.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/27

Two of the sequences obtained from the Blast Search CRF
02_AG from Cameroon (MP569 [GenBank: AM279387])
and a subtype G from Nigeria (NG083 [GenBank:
U88826]) were confirmed as already in the reference subtypes by a conservation plot using BioEdit. They were
however included as internal controls (repeat sequences)
for phylogeny. From this original alignment which was
1305 bp long (pol.), three additional files were created by
trimming sequences so as to obtain alignments with different base lengths: 300 bp prot., 661 bp RT (RTs) and
1005 RT. The four alignments were exported in the Raw
Text format to the PHYLIP software v3.66 http://evolu
tion.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html and used for
tree building. The RTs sequence includes amino acids 30
to 227 of the RT gene [22], and contains all the important
drug resistance mutations for individual HIV-1 drugs currently being used in Ghana.
Distance estimations were done using Dnadist with the
Kimura 2-parameter model [23], with the transition-totransversion (T/S) ratios that built the best possible phylogenetic tree. The Neighbor-joining analysis was then
used to create phylogenetic trees with 1000 datasets and
trees rooted with an HIV-1 group O strain (MVP5180
[GenBank: L20571]). In order to build robust trees, SeqBoot was used to build 1000 replicates before distances
were estimated. The T/S ratio was determined by using the
Dnaml.exe file in the PHYLIP software to determine the
maximum likelihood of obtaining the best tree. For each
alignment (pol, prot., RTs, and RT), the likelihood of having the best tree was determined by running the
Dnaml.exe with a T/S ratio from 1 to 4 with incremental
differences of 0.05. Since trees were going to be rooted
with HIV-1 group O as an out-group, the MVP5180 strain
was used as an out-group in Dnaml.exe for the T/S analysis. A consensus tree was built with Consense after Neighbor-joining and rooted with the MVP5180. Phylogenetic
trees were displayed with the Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 4.0. Bootstrap
values of 70% were considered as being phylogenetically
significant.
Recombination and CRF02_AG out-groups
Recombination analysis was done with RIP 3 in the HIV
sequence database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/hivdb/RIP3/RIP.html with the 13 sequences obtained from
the Blast Search as a background sequence alignment.
After input of query sequences, the RIP 3 output was rerun
to identify fragments of the GHN sequences which had
high homologies to the sequences in the background
sequence alignment. The window size for the analysis was
set at 500 nucleotides because subtype inference for CRF
02_AG strains from Ghana have been done with a similar
length of nucleotides [6]. The significant threshold for the
RIP program was set at 90%.

Of the 25 GHN sequences, 22 were CRF 02_AG and 2
were unclassified. These 24 sequences were also aligned in
a separate file and the T/S ratio for the best tree determined as described earlier. No out-group in Dnaml.exe
was chosen for this T/S analysis and bootstrapping (1000
replicates) and Neighbor-Joining were used to infer phylogenetic relationships between the sequences. Trees were
not rooted in Neigbor.exe (PHYLIP) and each sequence
was subsequently used as an out-group and bootstrap values inferred in TreeView http://taxonomy.zool
ogy.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html after a consensus tree was
built with Consense.

binant patterns for all sequences have been shown [see
Additional file 1].
Even when considering a 90% homology of GHN
sequences to those used as background in the RIP program, some level of recombination between CRF 02_AG
and AG strains do occur. GHN36 and GHN60 were the
only pure strains [see Additional file 1]. The phylogenetic
relationships between the Ghana sequences alone showed
that GHN90 and GHN21 (together with GHN117) were
significantly presented as out-groups with very high bootstrap values (> 96%). None of the other sequences had
significant bootstrap values as out-groups.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships
The T/S values for the likelihood of the best phylogenetic
tree differed for each group of sequences analyzed. For the
pol, prot, RT, and RTs, the values were 3.00, 1.85, 3.10 and
3.25 respectively. The file with the Ghana pol strains only
had a T/S of 3.05.

For the pol. and RT, GHN CRF 02_AG sequences were
inferred with sufficient confidence (â¥ 70%), but the RTs
and prot. had bootstrap values of 57% and 22% respectively. Sequences which were repeated had 100% bootstrap values at their nodes for the pol., RT, and RTs, but not
the prot. Although the CRF 02_AG from Cameroon [GenBank: AM279387] and one of the reference subtypes
[GenBank: AJ286937] were shown to have the same
nucleotide sequences, the node for the two sequences had
bootstrap value of 59% for the prot. alignment (Figure 1a).
The subtype G from Nigeria [GenBank: U88826] that was
repeated in the sequence alignment as U88826_R had
bootstrap value of 67% for the prot. alignment (Figure 1a).
The bootstrap values for the CRF 02_AG strains were 70%
for RT and 57% for RTs, but their tree topologies were
similar.
Recombination patterns/Out-groups
Apart from GHN60, which was a subtype G, and GHN36
that was closely related to a CRF02_AG sequence from
Ghana [GenBank: AB286862], all the GHN sequences
were recombinants of various CRF 02_AG/AG-like strains
from Ghana, Cameroon and Senegal [see Additional file
1]. One of the two unclassified strains (GHN21) was a
recombinant of an AG recombinant (AG_CM
[AM279381]) and a CRF 02_AG strain from Cameroon
(02_AG CM [DQ166391]). The most frequent CRF02_AG
fragments found were strains from Cameroon [GeneBank:
AJ286952, AJ286956] and Senegal [GeneBank:
AJ286994] [see Additional file 1]. Minor drug resistance
mutations have recently being shown in the GHN
sequences used in this study [21], but there was no obvious relationship between the nature of recombination
and the mutations seen. Details of CRF02_AG/AG recom-

Discussion
In this study, we trimmed sequences from a partial pol
gene which included the prot. gene of HIV-1 sequences
from Ghana. The results of this study unlike others presented the opportunity to determine phylogenetic relationships as the sequences were shortened from longer
fragments and not by sequencing partial pol genes of the
HIV-1 strains [15,17,18]. Our results indicate that the T/S
values are different for different lengths of sequences and
should be considered when building trees with fragments
of the pol gene. The similarity in topology between RTs
and RT shows that the 661 bp can be confidently used for
subtyping of HIV-1 strains from Ghana.
Similar length of sequences in the env as compared to the
prot. have been used to establish phylogenetic relationship
in HIV-1 strains from Ghana [6]. This may mean that the
variability in the prot gene, especially for CRFs, may not be
sufficient to establish strain relationships. Our results for
the prot. phylogeny are in contrast to that of others
[12,14,15], but confirm the study by Pasquier et al [18].
The differences obtained from these studies are likely to
be mainly due to the number of reference subtypes
included. It is therefore important that in determining the
true relationships of sequences, at least the nine pure subtypes and circulating recombinants commonly found
within the region under study, are used for tree building.
The subtyping done by Kinomoto et al. using only the
prot. gene may therefore not be reliable [14].
The repeat sequences introduced had bootstrap values of
100% for the pol, RT and RTs phylogenetic trees but not
prot. It can therefore be inferred that using a bootstrap
value of 70% for the RT and 57% for the RTs which
accounted for the CRF 02_AG cluster will be sufficient to
determine subtypes. Although other studies have used
higher values, our results indicate that it may be necessary
to include repeat reference sequences in order to ascertain
the reliability of the length of sequences being used for
bootstrapping analysis. Since the repeat sequences in the
prot. gene had bootstrap values < 100%, which did not

Our results confirm those of other studies that the pol and
RT genes are useful for subtyping [17,18]. The loosely
arranged pol gene sequences in the phylogenetic trees also
reflected in the recombination analysis done, and confirm
loosely arranged HIV-1 strains in previous studies [20].
Fragments of a previously characterized Ghanaian 02-AG
sequence [GeneBank: AB286862 (4 in Additional file 1)]
were found in only two sequences, GHN36 and GHN81
[see Additional file 1]. Since GHN36 was the only pure
02_AG strain found, this may suggest that the pol genes
may have evolved away from this prototype into other
sequences. The pol gene of 02_AG sequences may be
undergoing complex recombination processes that may
further complicate its use for subtyping. Furthermore,
since GHN90 was clearly an out-group when the 24
Ghana sequences were analyzed alone, it is likely that the
evolution is towards that strain. This may explain why
fragments of CRF 02_AG strains [GeneBank: AJ286956 (5
in Additional file 1)] and [GeneBank: AJ583728 (7 in
Additional file 1)] which were common in GHN90 were
frequently seen in other GHN sequences [see Additional
file 1].
Although GHN21 and GHN117 did not cluster with significant reliability with the AG recombinant reference
sequences DDJ362 [GeneBank: AY521632] and DDJ364
[GeneBank: AY521633] even in the pol gene (Figure 1b),
this can be explained with the recombination analysis
done [see Additional file 1]. GHN21 and GHN117 both
had fragments of CRF 02_AG strains in their sequences,
with GHN117 having 5 as compared to one in GHN21
[see Additional file 1]. It will be impossible to make these
inferences about the purity of GHN21 and GHN117, and
the other GHN strains [see Additional file 1], without the
RIP analysis.
Thus, the polymerase genes of HIV-1 strains from Ghana
are made up of recombinants of several CRF 02_AG
strains from Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon, but the clinical implications are unknown. A continuous surveillance
of pol gene sequences from Ghana is needed to understand this evolutionary pattern.
