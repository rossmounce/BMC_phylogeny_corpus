Abstract
Background: Neighboring nucleotides exert a striking influence on mutation, with the
hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides in many genomes being an exemplar. Among the approaches
employed to measure the relative importance of sequence neighbors on molecular evolution have
been continuous-time Markov process models for substitutions that treat sequences as a series of
independent tuples. The most widely used examples are the codon substitution models. We
evaluated the suitability of derivatives of the nucleotide frequency weighted (hereafter NF) and
tuple frequency weighted (hereafter TF) models for measuring sequence context dependent
substitution. Critical properties we address are their relationships to an independent nucleotide
process and the robustness of parameter estimation to changes in sequence composition. We then
consider the impact on inference concerning dinucleotide substitution processes from application
of these two forms to intron sequence alignments from primates.
Results: We prove that the NF form always nests the independent nucleotide process and that
this is not true for the TF form. As a consequence, using TF to study context effects can be
misleading, which is shown by both theoretical calculations and simulations. We describe a simple
example where a context parameter estimated under TF is confounded with composition terms
unless all sequence states are equi-frequent. We illustrate this for the dinucleotide case by
simulation under a nucleotide model, showing that the TF form identifies a CpG effect when none
exists. Our analysis of primate introns revealed that the effect of nucleotide neighbors is overestimated under TF compared with NF. Parameter estimates for a number of contexts are also
strikingly discordant between the two model forms.
Conclusion: Our results establish that the NF form should be used for analysis of independenttuple context dependent processes. Although neighboring effects in general are still important,
prominent influences such as the elevated CpG transversion rate previously identified using the TF
form are an artifact. Our results further suggest as few as 5 parameters may account for ~85% of
neighboring nucleotide influence.

Background
Sequence neighborhoods have been identified as exerting
a strong influence on mutation with the most striking
illustration being the elevated mutation rate affecting C
within the dinucleotide CpG. This elevated mutation rate
putatively arises because C within the CpG dinucleotide is
the preferred target for modification by DNA methylases
[1] and the resulting modified base, 5-methyl-cytosine
(henceforth 5 mC), has an elevated mutation rate [2-4].
Analyses of sequence neighborhoods of human mutations have established, for this species at least, that a
mutagenic influence of neighboring nucleotides on mutation rates is not restricted to CpG dinucleotides [5]. As different mutagenic and repair processes target different
classes of sequence, determining how the substitution rate
of a nucleotide is affected by the identity of neighboring
nucleotides can assist in identifying the metabolic origins
of a substitution. Establishing the relative importance of
neighboring nucleotides and the etiology of these effects
therefore has important implications for relating specific
metabolic processes to existing genetic variation [6,7]. The
contributions of factors that affect mutation rates can be
identified using analyses of substitution rates. In the
absence of natural selection, mutation and substitution
rates are equal [8], allowing mutation rates to be inferred
from neutral substitution rates. Since variation in substitution rates among sequence residues strongly influences
estimation of evolutionary relationships [9-11], improved
understanding of the origins of these effects, and how to
correctly model them, will further benefit the reconstruction of accurate phylogenies.
Estimation of neighborhood effects from comparative
genomic sequence data has been performed using socalled context dependent substitution models. A number
of approaches have been developed which can be broadly
classified according to whether they treat sequences as a
series of independent tuples [12-14] or not [15-17]. We
restrict our attention here to the independent tuple model
class. All subsequent statements concerning context
dependent models refer to the independent tuple case.
Early models of context dependent substitution focused
on measuring effects arising from RNA secondary structure [18] or from the genetic code in protein coding
sequences [19,20]. (While employed for analysis of nonneighboring nucleotides involved in RNA stem structures,
the model of Schöninger and von Haeseler [[18], hereafter
SvH] is also a context dependent model.) The codon models constitute a special case of independent tuple models
where sequence states that correspond to stop codons are
excluded from the state-space, e.g. a codon model for the
standard genetic code has 61 states corresponding to the
sense codons, 3 states less than the full trinucleotide statespace of 64. While the originally defined codon models of
Muse and Gaut [[19], hereafter MG] and Goldman and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/52

Yang [[20], hereafter GY] differed considerably in how
they represented the influence of natural selection, with
the model of GY in particular seeking to employ aspects of
amino-acid chemistry, subsequent refinements [21] have
resulted in the MG and GY models being more similar
with respect to their exchangeability parameters.
The primary difference between these model forms of
interest here is their different weighting of exchanges in
the instantaneous rate matrix. In the MG codon model,
the rate of nucleotide substitution within a codon context
is weighted by the resulting nucleotide frequency. In the
SvH and GY models, the rates are proportional to the frequency of the resulting tuple (doublet or codon respectively). We therefore classify models according to whether
rates are weighted by nucleotide frequencies (hereafter NF
models) or tuple frequencies (hereafter TF models). The
effect of these differing definitions is on the expected equilibrium frequencies of tuples, with those under NF being
the product of the independent monomer frequencies
[22] (for the codon case, these are normalized for omission of the stop codons). The TF model formulation has
proved more popular and several studies of context
dependent substitution in non-coding sequences have
used derivatives of the TF rate matrix form. Of particular
interest has been assessment of the contribution of specific processes such as methylation to the overall rate of
substitution [13,16,23]. A broader examination of the
properties of a series of fully parameterized models both
for independent and overlapping-tuple cases has also
been done [16], demonstrating a substantial improvement in fit conferred by context dependent models over
independent nucleotide models.
The distinct equilibrium frequencies expected under the
TF and NF models indicate they differ in their relationship
to an independent monomer process. Previous efforts at
understanding the distinct properties of these model
forms were performed on the more complex case of
understanding protein coding sequence evolution and
were based on contrasting statistical properties derived
from analysis of codon alignments simulated under a TF
variant [24], an approach acknowledged by the original
authors as biased towards the TF form. The exact nature
and significance of the difference between these model
classes for general independent tuple models remains to
be explored.
We suggest that a context dependent substitution model
should specify the null model of context independence
with fewer parameters than required to specify alternate
hypotheses of context dependence. Here we show that the
NF form satisfies this condition, that aside from very special cases the TF form does not and that naïve use of TF
leads to incorrect detection of context effects. In light of

the latter finding, we consider the consistency of the two
model forms when applied to real data. Specifically, we
reconsider the importance of nearest neighbor sequence
context using reversible, stationary and homogeneous
models of dinucleotide substitution.

Results
The relationship of NF and TF to an independent
nucleotide process
We present the NF and TF models for dinucleotides but
note that essentially the same treatment applies to trinucleotides and larger units. We also note here that different
model forms will be referenced using the following notation: NF/TF refers to the component of a substitution rate
matrix that stems from the motif probabilities while the
subscript (e.g. nuGTR, explained below) refers to the
exchangeability terms (r).

Let q denote a general time-reversible (GTR) substitution
rate matrix [25,26] on nucleotides, i.e., for i ≠ j, with elements q(i, j) = r(i, j) π (j) for some symmetric matrix r and
equilibrium distribution frequencies π. For t ≥ 0, let pt be
the transition matrix across a time interval of length t. The
element pt(i, j) is the conditional probability that the state
at time t is j given that it is i at time 0. We have

lim p t = I ,
t →0

where I is the identity matrix. Furthermore, q is the derivative of pt at t = 0:

View two independent nucleotides undergoing the process defined by q as a unit, so that we have a reversible process on the dinucleotides with transition matrix Pt and rate
matrix Q. We now derive an expression for Q. By (2), for
distinct dinucleotides a = i1i2 and b = j1j2,

P (a,b)
Q(a, b) = lim t

There are two cases to consider. (i) a and b differ in both
positions. By (1) and (2),

p (i , j )
Q(a, b) = lim t 1 1 × lim p t (i 2 , j 2 ) = q(i1 , j1) × 0 = 0.

(ii) a and b differ in exactly one position. In the case where
they differ at the first position, the same calculation gives

⎩ NF
where the 16 × 16 rNF is symmetric. This new process is an
NF (nucleotide frequency weighted) model. It will be
shown in the next paragraph that its equilibrium frequencies are homogeneous multiplicative, i.e., π (a) = π (i1) π
(i2), and that it is reversible. (As an aside, we note that it
is possible to generalize the definition of NF to allow for
position-specific differences in π.) Within NF, the nucleotide GTR process is an appropriate null model for investigating context effects. The joint contribution of various
specific contexts can be easily specified and estimated
from data by exploiting a whole spectrum of intermediate
models. For this reason, the baseline nucleotide GTR
process is called NFnuGTR.
The more widely used TF models are specified in a
slightly, but crucially, different way from the above. In a
TF (tuple frequency weighted) dinucleotide rate matrix, if
a ≠ b, then

i1 ≠ j1 , i 2 ≠ j 2
⎧0
Q TF (a, b) = ⎨
⎩ r TF (a, b)p (b) otherwise
where rTF is symmetric and π are the equilibrium frequencies. As π is not necessarily multiplicative, then the TF
form is the most general reversible rate matrix for dinucleotides in the class of models where each substitution
event involves only one nucleotide. The TF models with
multiplicative π are precisely the NF models. To see this,
first note that every NF model can be written in TF form
by letting π be multiplicative. Then, for a and b differing
in exactly one position,

⎧ rNF (a, b) / p ( j 2 ) i1 ≠ j1 , i 2 = j 2
r TF (a, b) = ⎨
⎩ rNF (a, b) / p ( j1) i1 = j1 , i 2 ≠ j 2

Conversely, if in a TF model π is multiplicative, then using
the above relationship gives the same model in NF form.
As a consequence, NF models have multiplicative equilibrium frequencies and are reversible. As for NF, the TF
model where the rTF terms depend on the corresponding
nucleotide substitution and nothing else is called TFnuGTR.
When the rTF terms are symmetric and otherwise unconstrained, the model is called TFdiGTR.
The fact that TFdiGTR is a general reversible process makes
it intuitive to expect it to be the "right" generalization of
the nucleotide GTR process, i.e., that TFnuGTR with multiplicative equilibrium frequencies is the nucleotide GTR
process, but this is false unless the nucleotides are equally
frequent. For example, qTF(AA, AC) = qTF(CA, CC) implies
rTF(AA, AC) π (A) = rTF(CA, CC) π (C), so that the two rTF
terms are equal only if π (A) = π (C). This property predisposes TF to misinterpretations. Suppose that data are generated from the nucleotide GTR process, or equivalently,
NFnuGTR, with unequal nucleotide frequencies. The maximized log likelihood under TFnuGTR will be appreciably
less than that under NFnuGTR, which will result in a large
gain in maximized log likelihood when TFnuGTR is compared with TFdiGTR (which contains the nucleotide GTR
process), leading to a spurious detection of context effects;
but the NF models will behave as expected. We demonstrated this by simulating 100 50 kbp long alignments
under NFnuGTR, using parameters estimated from the
genomic alignment of orthologous intron sequences from
human,
chimpanzee
and
macaque
for
ENSG00000003147. The likelihood ratio statistic LR
between NFnuGTR and NFdiGTR, i.e., twice the difference in
the maximized log likelihoods, has an approximate χ2 distribution with 42 degrees of freedom, as predicted by theory; in particular, their average and standard deviation
(SD) were 42.2 and 9.2. However, between TFnuGTR and
TFdiGTR the LR was typically very large, averaging to 161.0
with an SD of 25.1.

We illustrate the impact of this confounding of exchangeability parameters in TF with nucleotide composition by
estimation of a context parameter from simulated data.
We simulated 1000 alignments under NFnuGTR using the
same parameter estimates as for the previous simulation
(see Methods for details). For each alignment we fit variants of the NFnuGTR and TFnuGTR models that had been

The TF form can also be unsatisfactory for detecting real
context effects. Suppose that data are generated from
TFnuGTR with non-multiplicative π, which is not a nucleotide GTR model. Then the LR between TFnuGTR and
TFdiGTR can be so small as to obscure the context effects.
Somewhat unexpectedly, comparing NFnuGTR to NFdiGTR
can still succeed. This is illustrated by a similar simulation
as in the previous paragraph, except that the data come
from TFnuGTR. The TFdiGTR LR averaged to 43.3 with an SD
of 10.1, like a χ2 distribution with 42 degrees of freedom,
but for NFdiGTR the average and SD were 313.9 and 30.4.

proofs above showing the relationship of NF model forms
to an independent nucleotide process, and the confounding (relative to this process) of exchangeability parameters
under TF.
The fit of TF and NF to primate intron alignments differs
substantially
The analytical results indicate that the TF and NF forms
will exhibit distinct model likelihoods and parameter
MLEs – the critical statistics used for drawing inference on
the importance of parameters and the nature of their
effects. We contrasted the practical impact of the differences in the two model forms by analysis of aligned
orthologous intron sequences from the human, chimpanzee and macaque primate lineages. Intronic sequences
were used due to increased confidence in their orthology
resulting from comparisons of their exons and the relatively low fraction of sequence likely to be subjected to the
scrutiny of natural selection [27]. Introns were sampled
from all human autosomes so as to capture the genomic
diversity of mutation processes. Sequence regions likely to
evolve by a non-point mutation process, including lowcomplexity sequence and indels, were excluded in a manner that preserved the integrity of naturally occurring
dinucleotides. The intron sequence alignments from the
resulting sampled genes were broken into exactly 50 kbp
long blocks to facilitate comparisons of parameters estimated from different alignments. Each alignment block
was derived from a single gene but multiple alignment

We contrasted comparable variants of the TF and NF
forms for analysis of the real biological sequences by comparison to the corresponding nuGTR baseline parameterization. Given their relationships to an independent
nucleotide process, the NFnuGTR baseline is a nucleotide
GTR model while the TF nuGTR baseline is not. The only difference between the models being their differing weighting of elements of the instantaneous rate matrix by
monomer and tuple frequencies respectively. The richest
rate matrix parameterization considered was the diGTR, a
fully general time reversible dinucleotide model. The
diGTR model includes a parameter for each of the 48
instantaneous dinucleotide exchanges (conventionally
one is omitted to calibrate the model, resulting in 47 free
parameters). Because of considerable variation in both
composition and substitution process across the genome
of primates, we fit each model to each alignment independently and determined the support for the model
across the entire data set as a cumulative ln L obtained as
the sum of corresponding ln L from all alignments. See
Methods for the complete model definitions, model
implementation in software and procedure used for
parameter estimation.
The magnitude of improvement over the nucleotide GTR
model differed substantially between the TF and NF
forms. Even the TFnuGTR model was 'better' than the fully
parameterized NF diGTR model (Figure 2), despite the fact
that for some alignments TFnuGTR was worse than the
nucleotide GTR (results not shown). This property originates from the intrinsically context dependent nature of
TF. The likelihood for the NFdiGTR model still confers,
however, a massive improvement over an independent
nucleotide process, supporting the importance of a
sequence neighborhood effect.
Parameter estimates differ substantially between NF and
TF forms
The MLE of a model parameter has particular significance
since its relative position to the value 1 influences the
interpretation concerning enhanced or suppressive influence of a context on substitution rate. We first examined
the consistency in improvement over the nuGTR likelihood conferred by individual dinucleotide parameters.
Each of the 48 distinct reversible dinucleotide exchanges
was added to nuGTR for the TF and NF forms (see Methods). For example, we measured the influence of CpG to
TpG substitutions, represented by the parameter CG ⇔
TG, in models that also included the nucleotide GTR
exchangeability parameters, denoting the resulting models NFnuGTR+CG⇔TG and TFnuGTR+CG⇔TG. The improvement

ground substitution rate (Figure 4). In contrast, under NF,
the distribution of MLEs spans 1 (Figure 4) and the relatively small mean relative improvement percentage (≤
0.5) along with a mean (per alignment) LR < 2 (Table 1)
suggests CpG transversion rates are in fact not elevated at
all, contradicting previous reports [13,16].

Contrasting improvement of the dinucleotide GTR model
Contrasting improvement of the dinucleotide GTR
model over a nucleotide GTR process. nuGTR – for NF
this is the nucleotide GTR model, for TF it is a comparable

model compared to the cumulative ln L for the nuGTR

conferred by the CG ⇔ TG parameter was determined by
contrasting the likelihood against that from the corresponding nuGTR model: NFnuGTR vs NFnuGTR+CG⇔TG; and,
TFnuGTR vs TFnuGTR+CG⇔TG. As these comparisons are
between nested models, the differences were measured
using the standard likelihood ratio test statistic LRT. To
facilitate comparisons between the two model forms, we
further expressed the relative improvement conferred by
each individual term as the proportion of that obtained
for the diGTR. For example, the relative improvement
over a nuGTR model conferred by the CG ⇔ TG term is
expressed as LR(CG ⇔ TG)/LR(diGTR), where the ratio is
between models belonging to the same model form.
The contribution of each dinucleotide pair in improving
model fit over nuGTR was assessed under both NF and TF
forms. Dinucleotide parameters are listed in Table 1 by
order of influence in an NF model. Whilst the seven most
influential parameters were consistent between the NF
and TF model forms, the order of importance was not preserved. The relative importance of dinucleotide parameters was reasonably consistent between the two forms,
with CpG transition substitutions accounting for ~50% of
the diGTR improvement over nuGTR. The degree of concordance between the mean MLEs obtained for the 48
parameters was considerable, but with striking outliers
corresponding to the CpG terms (Figure 3). Of particular
note is the observation that MLEs for CpG transversions
were strongly discordant between the NF and TF forms.
Under TF, CpG transversion MLEs are predominantly > 1,
indicative of a greater rate of substitution than the back-

More generally, the results from the NF model indicate
that (after normalization) the 10 top-ranked parameters
account for ~85% of the improvement conferred by the
diGTR models 48 free parameters. Each parameter in the
top 10 list was a transition substitution whose strandcomplement was also in the top 10 list. Indicating that
substitution processes were strand-asymmetric, the
strand-complementary parameters were not always
immediately adjacent in rank, e.g. AT ⇔ GT was 3rd,
while AT ⇔ AC was 10th (Table 1, Figure 5).

Discussion
The different rate matrix weighting of the TF and NF
model forms have considerable influence on their statistical properties. Relative to an independent nucleotide
process, when nucleotide frequencies are asymmetric, all
exchangeability parameters under TF are confounded with
sequence composition parameters. Our analysis of real
biological data indicate that this difference is affecting
inference. Although the relative importance of exchangeability parameters determined under either model form
were related, striking discrepancies between the models
were evident for important processes, indicating the
parameters estimated under TF can be strongly misleading.
A key property of TF, that the stationary motif distribution
readily becomes the observed distribution, is more difficult to achieve with NF. In real biological sequences, the
frequencies of dinucleotide and higher order tuples are
not products of their monomer frequencies. Accounting
for this feature is a natural motivator in the TF model
design where, by definition, the evolutionary process
arrives at the observed distribution of sequence states. In
contrast, specifying an NF model where the tuple frequencies are not just the product of monomer frequencies is
more complex. One way it could be achieved is by specifying a non-reversible process, although the suitability of
such a model for the commonly employed eigendecomposition matrix exponentiation algorithm remains to be
established. Across a range of genomes, codon frequencies
are reasonably approximated by position-specific nucleotide frequencies [28]. This suggests using position-specific nucleotide frequencies as a reasonable alternate
approach, at least for protein coding sequences.
That the likelihoods achieved under TF are enormously
improved compared to NF (Figure 2) provides a cautionary note against focussing solely on the likelihood as the

the TF variant that does contain the independent process,
substantially complicating inference of LRTs and the interpretability of exchangeability parameter MLEs. Contrast
this with the NF form where NFnuGTR is the nucleotide
GTR, NFdiGTR is always measuring departures from independence and the context rate parameters (e.g. CG ⇔ TG)
in all NF models have, under the null of no effect, the
expected value of 1 regardless of sequence composition.
On this basis we suggest the NF form as a superior framework for the examination of context dependent effects.

basis for contrasting models. In the current case, a naive
interpretation of the different likelihood magnitudes
would lead to the conclusion that the TF forms were superior. The same conclusions are reached even when an
information theoretic transformation, such as AIC, that
takes account of the larger number of free parameters in
TF is used (result not shown). That this apparent superiority over a simple model does not hold universally (e.g. ln
L from TFnuGTR can be worse than that from nucleotide
GTR) illustrates the challenge in using TF. It also highlights the necessity that consideration be given to whether
the parameters estimated under a model make sense.
Using the latter benchmark, however, requires knowing a
priori the expected values of the parameters in the model.
One benchmark for establishing the suitability of a model
form is how the desired null hypothesis is nested within
it. We suggest that as context dependent models are
intended to measure departures from independence, they
should conveniently include an independent monomer
process. As we have shown, for the TF form this is far from
convenient. Comparable rate parameters between the TF
and NF forms are only identical when the tuple frequencies are identical (see equation 3). For homogenous multiplicative π [π (a) = π (i1) π (i2)], at least 4 more
exchangeability parameters are required for the TF variant
to include the nucleotide GTR. From this it follows that
simpler TF models, such as TFnuGTR, do not always contain
the independent process but instead can be nested within

Our analyses of real, substantively neutrally evolving biological sequences suggests that the use of nested models
for measuring support ensures a modest consistency
between the models forms. The ranking of likelihood
ratios for comparable models were largely consistent
between the two model forms (Table 1). However, the
MLEs of some equivalently specified exchangeability
parameters are worryingly inconsistent. This discordance
was most apparent for CpG transversions (Figures 3 and
4), whose substitution rate was consistently greater than 1
for the TF model form, an observation previously reported
from application of TF based models [13,16] which has
been interpreted as indicating CpG transversions occur at
a rate greater than background. This effect indicates that
under TF, CpG transversion parameters are compensating
for the deficit in CpG dinucleotides relative to their
expected frequency. In contrast, under NF the MLE distributions (Figure 4) and relative importance (≤ 0.5%, Table
1) of CpG transversions indicate they are occurring in a
context-independent manner. This fits with current biochemical knowledge which indicates deamination of 5
mC converts a 5 mC·G base pair into a T-G mismatch
that, contingent on a repair failure, results in a C⇒T transition mutation.
The analysis of context dependent effects supports a
strong influence of sequence neighborhood on mutation,
evidenced by the significance of NFdiGTR (Figure 2). Our
assessment of the contributions to this fit from individual
neighborhood under NF distinguishes nucleotide from
neighborhood influences. Even after removing the hypermutable CpG effects, the NF model indicates that
sequence neighborhoods are important. When we normalized the relative importance statistic (% column,
Table 1) so they summed to 100, the top 10 ranked
parameters account for ~85% of the fit achieved by the NF
diGTR model, with CpG transitions alone accounting for
~46%. The etiology for these neighborhood influences is
known for CpG transitions [2]. Six of the remaining eight
parameters involve transition substitutions affecting the
dipyrimidines CpC, CpT, TpC and TpT (and their strand
complements). A candidate for the dipyrimidine effects is
the dedicated repair system for repair of lesions arising at
dipyrimidines [29,30] consistent with the slower than

at these contexts. The strand asymmetry in support and
MLEs of context effects is consistent with previous reports
[31] and likely reflects the influence of transcription coupled DNA repair (TCR) processes, which selectively repair
the transcribed strand [32]. Thus, although a specific can-

didate process for the remaining neighborhood influence
(AT ⇔ GT/AT ⇔ AC) is not clear, the strong strand asymmetry of the MLEs indicate it is strongly affected by TCR
and thus a target of either the base excision or nucleotide
excision repair systems.

The substantial number of published independent tuple
models which adopt the TF equilibrium distribution will
display similar properties to those demonstrated here.
Noteworthy, but by no means the only, examples of software implementing TF based models include the codon
models of PAML [33], the doublet and codon models of
Mr Bayes [14] and the dinucleotide and codon implementations in PyEvolve [23] and PyCogent versions up to 1.2
[34]. Software implementing the NF model forms include

blocks with any remaining sequence discarded. There
were 470 such alignments.

Conclusion

The nucleotide substitution models employed constitute
variants of the rate matrix defined in the Results. Consider
the nucleotide substitution rate matrix q, which has elements q(i, j) = r(i, j) π (j), where i, j ∈ {A, C, G, T}. When
r(i, j) = 1, ∀ i ≠ j, we have the F81 substitution model [37],
otherwise when r(i, j) ≠ 1, we have the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model [25,26]. For dinucleotides a, b made up of nucleotides i1i2 and j1j2 respectively,
the NFnuGTR model rate matrix QnuGTR has elements
QnuGTR(a, b) = r(i1, j1) π (j1) when dinucleotides a, b differ
at the first position, QnuGTR(a, b) = r(i2, j2) π (j2) when
dinucleotides a, b differ at the second position, and
QnuGTR(a, b) = 0 when dinucleotides a, b differ at both
positions. We illustrate the nuGTR + Param substitution
models for the case of CpG/TpG exchanges. Under a
nuGTR + CG ⇔ TG model, QnuGTR+CG⇔TG(a, b) = r(CG,
TG)QnuGTR(a, b) when {a, b} is {CG, TG} and
QnuGTR+CG⇔TG (a, b) = QnuGTR(a, b) otherwise. The NFdiGTR
model rate matrix QdiGTR has elements QdiGTR(a, b) =
rdiGTR(a, b) π (j1) when dinucleotides a, b differ at the first
position and QdiGTR(a, b) = rdiGTR(a, b) π (j2) when they differ at the second position. The TF form dinucleotide models were defined similarly to the comparable NF ones, but
replacing the π (j1/2) with π (b).

We have shown that models with NF form measure the
effect of sequence neighborhood as departure from an
independent nucleotide process, and that estimates of
parameters within this model are robust to changes in
sequence composition. In contrast, measurement of context dependent substitution influences with parameters
from models with the TF form are confounded with
sequence composition. We suggest, therefore, that results
from models with the latter form be re-evaluated with a
comparable NF model. Our application of NF dinucleotide models to primate introns confirms that sequence
neighborhoods exert a strong influence on the rates of
substitution and that transitions affecting CpG and dipyrimidine dinucleotides account for ~75% of the effect of
immediate neighbors measured by the diGTR model.

Methods
Data
Aligned introns from the human, chimpanzee and
macaque genomes were obtained from Ensembl release
49 [36]. Using coordinates of human genes we sampled a
maximum of 100 alignments from each of 5 blocks of
human autosomes (1–3, 4–6, 7–10, 11–15, and 16–22)
to ensure representation of substitution processes across
the primate genomes. As the substitution models represent the dynamics of point mutations only, any sequence
that may have evolved by a non-point mutation process
was replaced by an equivalent length run of '?'. Given their
susceptibility to mutation by slipped strand mispairing,
we specifically masked simple tandem-repeat sequences,
including di- to tetra-nucleotide repeats with 5 or more
repeat units. Mono-nucleotide repeats ≥ 10 nucleotides
long were also masked. Sequence masking was done on
the raw sequences (without gaps) while the locations of
gaps were retained. Gaps were also masked as they arise by
a non-point mutation process. The resulting masked
alignments were then split into columns of non-overlapping dinucleotides which were filtered such that any column containing a dinucleotide made up of one or more
of the characters 'N,?,-' was eliminated and the remaining
columns were then joined to form the filtered alignments.
Only alignments ≥ 50 kbp long were retained and these
alignments were sliced into exactly 50 kbp long aligned

Model definitions
The following conditions were applied to all model definitions: all exchangeability matrices (r) were symmetric
such that r(a, b) = r(b, a); diagonal elements of instantaneous rate matrices are determined by the constraint that the
row sums are 0; and, the instantaneous rate matrices were
scaled such that their trace = -1.

Validation of Model Implementation
The accuracy of all software implementations of the different substitution model forms were subject to stringent validation. Three of the authors (HL, VBY and GAH) reimplemented both the TF and NF model classes substantively independently from the core PyCogent classes; only
PyCogent's matrix exponentiation routines were common
to the implementations. The correctness of this code was
established by comparison against hand-calculated examples for species triplets. We relied on the theoretical relation between the independent nucleotide process and NF
in the development of these calculations. In particular,
when the null hypothesis of independence between
nucleotides is true, that the matrix of dinucleotide substitution probabilities for time t is equal to the Kronecker
product of the nested nucleotide substitution matrix for
time t, i.e.. Pdinuc = Pnuc ^ Pnuc. We also relied on the fact
that a TF model is equal to a NF model when the motif
states are equi-frequent, and different otherwise. The

Page 11 of 17

Biology Direct 2008, 3:52

results from a modest number of examples were also compared to those computed using R [38]. We then modified
the existing PyCogent substitution model classes to allow
specification of instantaneous rate matrices with the NF
model form – where the π elements included in the rate
matrix correspond to the probability of the ending nucleotide. The different implementations and indicated tests
were used to validate the accuracy of the implementation
in the modified PyCogent library.
Simulations
We used a genomic alignment, processed as described
above, of introns from the arbitrarily selected human gene
ENSG00000003147 to estimate branch lengths on the
unrooted tree relating human, chimpanzee and macaque.
For Figure 1 a nucleotide GTR substitution model [25,26]
was fitted and the resulting parameter MLEs used for simulation of 10 kbp alignments. The parameter MLEs were:
'(human:0.014, chimpanzee:0.014, macaque:0.109)',
(branch lengths rounded to the 4th decimal); nucleotide
probabilities {π (A) ≈ 0.28, π (T) ≈ 0.32, π (C) ≈ 0.19, π
(G) ≈ 0.21} and exchangeability parameters {rC⇔A ≈ 0.20,
rC⇔G ≈ 0.34, rT⇔A ≈ 0.12, rT⇔C ≈ 0.71, rT⇔G ≈ 0.19 and rA⇔G
= 1}.

Simulations under the TF form were also done using
parameters obtained from fitting ENSG00000003147.
Specifically, the TFnuGTR model was fitted to the alignment
and the resulting parameter MLEs used to simulate 100,
50 kbp long alignments. An important difference to the
simulations was that dinucleotide (not nucleotide) frequencies were estimated from the alignment and used for
simulation. All simulations were performed using PyCogent [34].
Statistical testing
The substitution model classes of PyCogent [34] were
modified to allow specification of these NF model form
and this version of PyCogent is included as Additional
data file 1. Maximum likelihood estimates of parameters
were obtained for each alignment separately by numerical
optimization using the built-in Powell optimization routine [39]. A tolerance of 10-6 was applied with a maximum
of 5 restarts. All LRT tests were executed using PyCogent.
Availability of algorithms and data
The modifications to PyCogent implementing the NF
model form will be available (on acceptance) as part of
the standard open source PyCogent distribution [34].
They will appear in PyCogent versions greater than 1.2. (A
modification of PyCogent version 1.1 with these new
capabilities is included as Additional data file 1.) Details
of the scripts used to simulate alignments and for model
fitting are included in Additional data file 2. The simulated alignments and the masked and filtered primate

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Rob Knight, University of Colorado, Boulder

Models of molecular evolution are critical for providing
the background against which adaptive evolution can be
detected, and for understanding how mutational and
selectional processes differ in different genomes (or parts
of the same genome). In this manuscript, Lindsay et al.
compare two widely used methods of incorporating context effects (i.e. the effects of neighboring nucleotides) in
the standard Markovian model of molecular evolution:
weighting by nucleotide frequencies (NF) and by tuple
frequencies (TF). TF is very widely used in software such
as the popular PAML and MrBayes phylogenetics packages. They are able to show both analytically and through
simulations that the TF form introduces subtle biases due
to sequence composition that could lead to incorrect biological conclusions: for example, the effect of methylation
at CpG islands and subsequent deamination of the C to T
is thought to be a key mutational pressure in mammals,
but the TF form "identifies" this effect even under simulation conditions where it cannot exist. The study thus has
important implications for other studies of molecular
evolution (in particular, recommendation of NF rather
than TF models), and may result in widespread evaluations of the degree of adaptation and the key evolutionary
parameters in genes and genomes throughout the tree of
life.

One interesting feature of this work is that the key parameters (as measured by order of importance) important for
nucleotide substitution in mammalian introns differ substantially between the NF and TF forms on the same data.
For example, the AT ↔ GT rate is third in importance with
the NF model but seventh in importance with the TF
model; the CG ↔ AG rate is tenth in importance with the
TF model but 26th in importance with NF. These sorts of
differences would lead to very different understandings of
the relative contributions of different kinds of mutations
and inferences about the molecular mechanisms
involved. One addition that would make this table easier
to interpret would be the addition of errors on the %
importance and rank importance obtained by bootstrapping the data set if this would take an acceptable amount
of computation time – for example, how large a change in
rank is meaningful?
Author's response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion
and have modified the Table to include estimates of the variability in both relative importance (%) and rank. These were
obtained using a jackknife resampling procedure. The associated text in the manuscript has also been revised.
Two other additions that would be useful, but perhaps
best left for future work, would be (i) more detail about
the kinds of molecular mechanisms (deamination, G oxidation, repair pathways, etc.) that are most likely to be
prone to over- or under-representation using the TF
model, and (ii) extension of the work beyond mammals.
Mutational processes are of intense medical interest in
studies of retroviral adaptation, for example. I also note
that my 2001 Genome Biology paper (PMID 11305938)
indicates that the product of position-specific nucleotide
frequencies does in fact recapture codon frequencies
extremely well across a wide range of genomes, so the
authors might want to use that argument to bolster the
applicability of their modeling assumptions.
Author's response: We can address the first point only in those
cases where a strong candidate mechanism has been identified
for a context. The dominant influence of deamination of 5methyl-cytosine on genomic composition (depletion of CpG)
appears responsible for the high ranking of CpG transversions
under the TF form. Aside from this obvious example of cytosine
deamination, the association between the context effects and
their causative mutagenic processes is poor, limiting our ability
to comment further.
We thank the reviewer for bringing to our attention this finding
from his Genome Biology paper. Codon models are certainly the
most popular application of context dependent models and the
result concerning the consistency of observed codon frequencies
with those calculated from position-specific nucleotide frequencies provides strong guidance for model design. We now include

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/52

this reference in our discussion of the different properties of the
NF/TF models.
Overall, I believe that this paper is an important contribution and is likely to lead to much wider development and
application of NF models in future.
Reviewer's report 2
Joshua Cherry, NCBI (nominated by David Lipman)

This article makes an important point: some models of
the TF form, including some widely used models, are
inadequate for many purposes and can yield biased
results. However, it unfairly and incorrectly impugns TF in
several places. It seems to claim that TF, unlike NF, cannot
represent independence of sites in the face of unequal
base frequencies, but this is only true of special cases of TF.
In fact the most general TF model contains every NF case
as a submodel, so TF can model any case that NF can
model (and more). Furthermore, a simplified example is
incorrectly alleged to demonstrate bias of estimates based
on TF. Also, NF has its own weaknesses, and the best
model for a particular purpose might conform to neither
NF nor TF. The sweeping conclusions that "models with
the TF form are systematically biased by sequence composition" (Conclusions) and "the NF form should be used"
(Abstract) are unjustified.
Author's response: We agree with the reviewer that the TF
form can also represent independence of sites when base frequencies are unequal and have now revised substantial sections
of the results and discussion to better explain the relationship
between these two model forms. We also agree that the NF form
has its own weaknesses, and detail these in the discussion. We
have also toned down statements concerning systematic bias.
We dispute, however, that we are not justified in claiming the
NF form should be used. We elaborate on each of these issues
in our response to the reviewer's detailed comments below.
Paragraph 3 of Results seems to argue that when base frequencies are unequal, TF cannot represent cases where
changes are independent of sequence context. This is not
true of all TF models. The argument that π (T) π (G) is in
general different from π (C) π (G) ignores the rTF terms,
which may be such that the rates are equal. The most general TF model contains the model with independence as a
submodel, so it clearly can represent that case and would
give consistent estimates of deviation from independence.
In short, some TF models can model independence and
are suitable for measuring context effects, even when there
is compositional bias.
Author's response: We agree that TF can represent cases where
changes are independent of sequence context and there are unequal base frequencies. We have revised the manuscript to clarify

this and the role of the rTF terms. Our point is, while NFnuGTR
is the nucleotide GTR process, TFnuGTR is not, although one
would expect it to be so. As a consequence, comparing NFnuGTR
and NFdiGTR is correct and clearly interpretable, at least for
models with multiplicative π, and to a lesser extent for others,
whereas TF is cumbersome: one needs to spend quite a lot of
effort to specify the nucleotide GTR process, even after the unintuitive realization that TFnuGTR doesn't do the job.
The above illustrates a more general point. A model need
not be a case of TF in order to be nested in a case of TF.
Every NF case is nested in the most general TF model, and
may be nested in more restricted TF models as well. A
model that only allows independence of sites may not be
a TF model, but it is nested in a TF model. Since we are
interested in models that allow context dependence, we
are interested in more general models anyway.
Author's response: We disagree with the last point. We are
interested in context dependence in order to understand what
contributes to it, not simply identifying its existence. We also
suggest that models whose parameters do not affect the likelihood when the null of independence is true are superior to the
alternative. This condition is satisfied by the NF form, not the
TF form.
Paragraphs 4–6 of Results claim to prove, using a simplified case with a two-letter alphabet, that TF leads to biased
estimates when equilibrium frequencies are unequal. No
bias is actually demonstrated, even for the special case of
TF used. The intent in constructing the NF model seems to
be that κ is a measure of a certain type of context effect,
with κ = 1 corresponding to independence (zero context
effect). For the TF model, the same r matrix is used. The
values of κ estimated for the TF model are indeed quite
different from 1 despite independence, but this is not an
indication of bias. Rather, the κ in the TF model is a different parameter than the κ in the NF model, and is not
expected to be 1 in this case. The QTF matrix is capable of
perfectly modeling the independent case. It does so with
κ ≠ 1 when frequencies are unequal. The estimated κ values are not biased, but are (in expectation, asymptotically) precisely what is required to yield a QTF matrix that
models the data. Modulo multiplication by a constant,
the NF and TF models produce the same matrix values,
but using different parameterizations.
Author's response: We agree that the term 'bias' is not correctly
applied here and have revised this portion of the manuscript.
We also emphatically agree that κ in the two models is a different parameter when the sequence states are unequal, but
exactly the same parameter when the sequence states are equal.
This is the point of the section, and a major point of the manuscript. In most applications, it is the r terms from NF models
that are being interpreted. Thus, even if an identical likelihood

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/52

were to result from application of NF and TF models, the biological inference drawn from those models could be markedly
different based on whether an r term was < 1, = 1, > 1.
This would all be clearer if the parameter in the QTF matrix
were given a different name, e.g., λ. The estimates of λ do
not cluster around 1, but these are not biased estimates of
κ: they are asymptotically unbiased estimates of λ. To
interpret λ ≠ 1 as an indication of context effects is a
human error. Whether there are context effects can be
determined from consideration of the estimates of λ and
π (R). This takes a bit more effort, but inconvenience is
quite different from bias.
Author's response: We have renamed the parameter to  .
I am unsure why the QTF matrix was given in terms of π (X)
π (Y) rather than πdinuc (XY). The latter corresponds to eq.
2, and yields a different, more general model (modulo
multiplication by a constant, it contains the QNF matrix as
a submodel).
Author's response:Our point was to demonstrate with a simple
case the conditions where κ =  could occur. We have clarified this section of the manuscript.
I am not sure that the other analyses are entirely fair to TF.
The authors apparently design an NF model that is appropriate and then transfer its r values to TF to yield a model
that is inappropriate. Perhaps it is equally possible to
design an appropriate TF model, and transfer of its r values to NF would yield an inappropriate model (this must
be true for some underlying true models). Along these
lines, for the case of intron sequence evolution the
authors consider the most general time reversible dinucleotide model. This model contains the others, and appears
to justify its extra parameters with sufficient likelihood
improvement. Why do the authors not simply take the
results of this model as their best estimates and recommend the use of this TF model for this application?
Author's response:We accept the reviewer's suggestion of defining a TF model and simulating under this and then transferring
the parameters to an NF model. This is now presented in the
last paragraph of Results section on 'The relationship of NF and
TF to an independent nucleotide process'.
Regarding our analysis of intron sequence evolution, we do not
take the fully general model purely on the face value of its likelihood improvement because we are not interested in just identifying the best fitting model. Instead, we seek to understand the
contributions of the different terms to the fit of this model, and
the consistency between the models in interpreting their effects.
We demonstrate there is broad consensus between the two
forms, but that they differ with respect to key parameters that
Page 14 of 17

Biology Direct 2008, 3:52

strongly influence our inference concerning the significance of
a mutagenic process – namely the rate of transversions at CpG
dinucleotides. We also point out that some potential applications of these models, such as phylogenetic reconstruction,
would substantially benefit from using parameterizations that
are less computationally intensive to fit than diGTR but succinctly capture the dominant effects.
Cherry responds in a second review: This new paragraph,
which mainly illustrates that a true null hypothesis is not
often rejected, does not address the point that I was trying
to make. In fact it is another example of the phenomenon
that I was criticizing. Rather than using a properly
designed TF model for assessing context effects, here and
elsewhere the authors use an inappropriate TF model,
TFnuGTR, obtained by blind transfer of the exchangeability
matrix from a working NF model. They then blame TF in
general for the result, and conclude, incorrectly, that TF
cannot be used for the intended purpose.
It is possible, reasonable, and likely often desirable to use
TF models to study context effects. The null hypothesis of
independent nucleotide GTR can be expressed in TF form
(as can anything that can be expressed in NF form, according to the definitions in the revised manuscript). This TF
form is different from what the authors misleadingly call
TFnuGTR. That may be surprising, but nonetheless it is possible to use a correct null hypothesis rather than TFnuGTR.
This null hypothesis can be tested against the alternative
hypothesis TFdiGTR. This procedure will detect context
effects when they are present but not when they are
absent, subject to the usual statistical uncertainties.
It is unimportant whether the null hypothesis is expressed
in TF form: the NF form or the single-nucleotide form will
yield the same likelihood. The important point is that
TFdiGTR is a legitimate and possibly very useful non-null
model. Indeed, as I noted above, it appears to be quite
useful for modelling the intron sequence data analyzed in
the article. Any extra effort required to interpret the
parameters is the price that one pays for using a richer
model that is capable of representing biological reality.
Sometimes a less general model will be preferable, but the
same can be said of any general model (e.g., single-nucleotide GTR). I see no valid argument for banishing this useful tool from our arsenal of models.
Author's response:Regarding the reviewer's statement concerning our specification of an "inappropriate TF model", we agree
that is inappropriate but point out that this form was not used
as a soft target. This parameterization was motivated by analogous TF form codon model parameterizations, specifically those
of the Goldman and Yang substitution model family and subsequent refinements. Thus, the TFnuGTRmodel choice is pertinent
to current applications.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/52

Regarding the reviewers suggestion that TF models are "reasonable, and likely often desirable" for the study of context effects,
we illustrate again the additional complexity necessary to relate
a TF model form to the relatively simple F81 substitution
model. To parameterize F81 in TF, we need to set

⎧ 1 / p ( j1) i1 = j1
r TF (i1i 2 , j1 j 2 ) = ⎨
⎩1 / p ( j2) i2 = j2
thus apparently requiring 4 extra parameters, which are in fact
functions of π, and the form of Q is harder to comprehend than
the analogous expression for the NF model form, where there
are no additional parameters and hence the rNF all equal 1.
Concerning the unimportance of the form of the null, we suggest it is enormously relevant to know which model actually corresponds to the desired null. We have argued that modelling
context dependence can be done sensibly when an appropriate
null can be identified, and that this null is obvious under the
NF form. We claim for TF that even if a more restricted TF
model than TFdiGTRnests the independent process, identifying
this model as the null for measuring context effects from the
myriad possibilities is decidedly non-obvious.
Cherry's first review continues: Paragraph 2 of the Discussion states that "...specifying an NF model where the tuple
frequencies are not just the product of monomer frequencies is more complex. One way it could be achieved is by
specifying a non-reversible process...." I would expand on
this. I believe the following to be true, but not necessarily
obvious:
1. If rNF(a, b) is symmetric, the equilibrium tuple frequencies equal the products of the nucleotide equilibrium frequencies, but
2. Symmetry of rNF(a, b) is not necessary (though it is sufficient) for time reversibility.
I would also note that NF, unlike TF, cannot represent different equilibrium frequencies at different tuple positions.
This would seem to be a serious deficit for codon-based
models. One can imagine an extension to NF in which
there are distinct frequency parameters for each tuple
position. I am unsure of the relationship of this extension
to TF.
Author's response:We thank the reviewer for their interesting
suggestion regarding asymmetric r. We have not modified the
Discussion as we feel the existing text is adequate.
We agree that the NF form presented in the manuscript cannot
represent position-specific equilibrium frequencies. However, as
suggested by the reviewer, specifying independent and nonidentical nucleotide frequencies is easy. Such models have

Page 15 of 17

Biology Direct 2008, 3:52

already been described (e.g. Pond SK, Muse SV: Site-to-site
variation of synonymous substitution rates. Mol Biol Evol 2005,
22:2375–2385). An argument for the suitability of this model
form for the codon case was made by the first reviewer (R
Knight, see above).
All that prevents any NF model from qualifying as a TF
model is the restriction that rTF does not depend on πdinuc.
Perhaps people tend to create this sort of model, which
would make it worth analyzing. However, there is no reason for models to have this restriction. Even in single-base
models, the analogous restriction is not always observed:
in the F84 (Felsenstein, 1984) model, for example, some
of the r values depend on π values. Perhaps the best models for some purposes are TF-like models that violate this
restriction.
Author's response:We concede that there may be some purposes for which the TF-like models may be better suited. Our
focus has been on establishing how to measure departures from
independence, and in particular the identification of primary
influences in departure from independence in the evolution of
DNA sequences. A motivator for this is the intra-genomic diversity in composition evident for many organisms, including the
primate species used for the intron analysis. In such a case,
using a model in which the critical parameters are independent
of composition seems the best choice. Under the NF form,
parameters estimated from genomic regions that differ in composition can be readily compared. As pointed out by the
reviewer, similarly defined parameters estimated under the TF
form from the same regions can also be compared. However, the
failure to appreciate the influence of composition on the latter
estimates can strongly mislead their interpretation.

evolution, whereas this is true for TF only when the equilibrium distributions of the nucleotides are identical.
When there are non-equal nucleotide frequencies, TF can
be seen to imply context-dependent factors in nucleic acid
evolution when there are none, and sometimes to miss
detecting such factors when they exist. The NF model does
not have equivalent difficulties.
Author's response:We note here that the last point relates to an
earlier version of the manuscript.
Applied to real, non-protein-coding sequences, the NF
and TF models both recognize very significant contextdependent effects on nucleic acid evolution, and agree on
the most important dinucleotide pairs implicated. However, the models can diverge substantially concerning
more subtle issues. Specifically, the NF model does not
recognize a significant context-dependent influence on
transversions involving CpG dinucleotides, whereas the
TF model does.
In conclusion, this paper presents a provocative critique of
the widely used TF model, and of some of the conclusions
that have been derived therefrom. Its arguments will need
to be taken into account in further modeling of nucleic
acid evolution.

This paper compares two different, widely used models
used for studying the evolution of nucleic acids. A specific
question is whether specific nucleotide substitutions
depend upon the context in which they occur, and in what
way. This is addressed by modeling the evolution of nonoverlapping nucleotide "tuples", and comparing the
results to a model of independent nucleotide evolution.

Acknowledgements
A structure imposed on such models assumes an instantaneous a→b tuple mutation rate expressible as a symmetric
matrix on a and b, multiplied by a factor dependent upon
the equilibrium frequency distribution of either the resulting tuple (b) or the resulting nucleotide in the mutation
that occurs. The nucleotide-frequency normalized model
is called NF, the tuple-frequency normalized model TF.
A central point of the paper is that for NF, a null model is
exactly the same as a model of independent nucleotide
