Abstract
Background: Yeast and animal cells require six mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm27) for pre-replication complex formation, DNA replication initiation and DNA synthesis. These six
individual MCM proteins form distinct heterogeneous subunits within a hexamer which is believed
to form the replicative helicase and which associates with the essential but non-homologous
Mcm10 protein during DNA replication. In contrast Archaea generally only possess one MCM
homologue which forms a homohexameric MCM helicase. In some eukaryotes Mcm8 and Mcm9
paralogues also appear to be involved in DNA replication although their exact roles are unclear.
Results: We used comparative genomics and phylogenetics to reconstruct the diversification of
the eukaryotic Mcm2-9 gene family, demonstrating that Mcm2-9 were formed by seven gene
duplication events before the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes. Mcm2-7 protein paralogues
were present in all eukaryote genomes studied suggesting that no gene loss or functional
replacements have been tolerated during the evolutionary diversification of eukaryotes. Mcm8 and
9 are widely distributed in eukaryotes and group together on the MCM phylogenetic tree to the
exclusion of all other MCM paralogues suggesting co-ancestry. Mcm8 and Mcm9 are absent in some
taxa, including Trichomonas and Giardia, and appear to have been secondarily lost in some fungi and
some animals. The presence and absence of Mcm8 and 9 is concordant in all taxa sampled with the
exception of Drosophila species. Mcm10 is present in most eukaryotes sampled but shows no
concordant pattern of presence or absence with Mcm8 or 9.
Conclusion: A multifaceted and heterogeneous Mcm2-7 hexamer evolved during the early
evolution of the eukaryote cell in parallel with numerous other acquisitions in cell complexity and
prior to the diversification of extant eukaryotes. The conservation of all six paralogues throughout
the eukaryotes suggests that each Mcm2-7 hexamer component has an exclusive functional role,
either by a combination of unique lock and key interactions between MCM hexamer subunits and/
or by a range of novel side interactions. Mcm8 and 9 evolved early in eukaryote cell evolution and
their pattern of presence or absence suggests that they may have linked functions. Mcm8 is highly
divergent in all Drosophila species and may not provide a good model for Mcm8 in other eukaryotes.

Background
DNA replication in eukaryotes is catalysed by a complex
of proteins termed the replisome. Formation of the replisome occurs at multiple origins of replication and is a
stepwise process co-ordinated by the cell cycle control
machinery (reviewed in [1]). Central to the replisome in
all phases of its genesis and function are MCM (minichromosome maintenance) proteins.
The genes encoding MCM proteins were first identified in
budding and fission yeasts through various cell cycle
mutant screens, most notably Bik Tye's mcm screen for
mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in the ability
to propagate centromeric plasmids containing a single
origin of replication [2]. The phenotype of many mcm
mutants is dependent on the exact identity of the origin of
replication, suggesting a defect affecting the initiation of
DNA replication [3]. In S. cerevisiae six MCM genes,
MCM2–MCM7 [4], were originally identified and have
shared sequence characteristics suggesting homology and
a history of paralogous duplication [5].
The MCM proteins form numerous and complex interactions, central to which is the formation of a hexamer, the
Mcm2-7 complex [5,6]. Mcm2-7 is loaded on to the origin
recognition complex (ORC) at the origin of replication
prior to DNA replication, during late M and G1 phases of
the cell cycle, to form the pre-replication complex (preRC). This is activated at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle
by the assembly of further protein components, including
the non-homologous Mcm10 protein, in response to cell
cycle kinase activities (reviewed in [7]). Mcm10 associates
with the Mcm2-7 hexamer in the active replisome and
helps to stabilise DNA polymerase α-primase (reviewed in
[8]). Mcm2-7, together with other accessory factors, is
believed to act as the replicative helicase, unwinding DNA
at the two replication forks to provide single-stranded
template on which replicative synthesis can take place
[9,10].
Genes encoding MCM helicases are also found in Archaea
(although not in Eubacteria currently sampled) but, in
contrast to eukaryotes, the archaeal helicase generally
comprises a homohexamer formed from multiple protein
copies encoded by a single MCM gene [11]. Mcm10 has
no recognised homologue in Archaea. Two more members of the Mcm2-7 family have recently been described in
eukaryotes: Mcm8 and Mcm9. Mcm8 functions in aspects
of DNA replication in vertebrates [12-15] but not in Drosophila, where it has a meiotic role [16,17]; it is absent
from nematodes and yeast. Less is known about Mcm9
[18] which is the largest of the Mcm2-9 paralogues, having a unique long C-terminal region [19]. It was originally
thought that Mcm9 is vertebrate-specific as it is absent
from Drosophila, nematodes and yeasts [19], but it is now

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/60

recognised that Mcm8 and Mcm9 have a more widespread
eukaryotic distribution [17,20,21]. Mcm1 is a transcription factor which is not directly involved in DNA replication and will not be considered here [22,23].
Our knowledge of MCM proteins and DNA replication is
derived from research principally based on yeast and vertebrate animals. These taxa are members of the
opisthokonts, which according to current taxonomic consensus is one of six eukaryotic 'supergroups' [24] and
therefore only represents a relative small proportion of
the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of known
eukaryotic life. For the other five eukaryotic supergroups,
studies of the DNA replisome or MCM protein function
and diversity are limited [25]. Here we use comparative
genomics and phylogenetic analysis to investigate the distribution of MCM DNA replication proteins across the
eukaryotes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the
Mcm2-9 proteins, and to gain insights into MCM functional diversification, in distantly related eukaryotic taxa
and at the base of the eukaryotic tree of life.

Results and discussion
Identification of MCMs
BLAST algorithms were used to identify MCM homologues encoded by the eukaryotic genomes of the 37 species listed in Table 1, covering five of the six eukaryotic
supergroups [24,26-28] (Rhizaria unsampled). In Naegleria and Xenopus there were two proteins that grouped with
Mcm3, and in Xenopus two Mcm6 proteins were found
[29], providing the only examples of recent MCM duplication events among the taxa investigated. Comparative
genomics and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) showed that
genes encoding six MCM proteins, Mcm2-7 homologues,
were present in every eukaryotic genome sampled. These
data suggest that the last common eukaryotic ancestor
(LCEA) possessed all six Mcm2-7 paralogues and this
ancient cell was therefore likely to contain a multi-subunit
MCM protein complex composed of six paralogous proteins. These data suggest that an intricate and heterogeneous MCM protein complex evolved in an early phase of
eukaryotic evolution.

Genes encoding the two most recently identified MCM
family proteins, Mcm8 and Mcm9, were found to be
present in the majority of eukaryotic genomes analysed
and only absent in some opisthokonts, excavates and
chromalveolates. Generally the Mcm8 and Mcm9 paralogues were either both present or both absent, suggesting
that Mcm8 and Mcm9 may have associated functions. Of
the taxa surveyed we found only one exception to this
rule: Drosophila spp. possess Mcm8 but lack Mcm9.
BLAST searches and local Pfam searches of Mcm10 homologues showed that Mcm10 was also widely distributed

Taxonomic distribution of Mcm2-9 and a summarised phylogenetic tree of MCMs. This analysis shows that Mcm29 are present in the majority of the major eukaryotic 'supergroups' and that each MCM forms a moderate to strongly supported monophyletic group. Together these data demonstrate that Mcm2-9 were present in the last common eukaryotic
ancestor. (A) Comparative genomic survey of MCM paralogues in 37 eukaryotic taxa. Mcm2-9 are shown on the x-axis and

among the eukaryotes sampled (Table 1). Mcm10 is conserved in opisthokonts and Plantae, except in Encephalitozoon and Cyanidioschyzon which represent eukaryotes with
relatively small genomes and often encode divergent protein sequences [30,31]. Mcm10 proteins exhibit greater
sequence divergence than Mcm2-9 orthologues and we
cannot rule out that some Mcm10 orthologues may have
fallen below detection limits employed here, however the
distribution pattern of Mcm10 in representatives of different eukaryotic supergroups does not correlate with that of
Mcm8 and Mcm9 (Table 1).
The phylogeny and evolution of eukaryotic Mcm2-9
A phylogeny of the full Mcm2-9 protein family was reconstructed from the amino acid alignments of each conserved MCM domain [5,32] by performing a fast
Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis using PHYML [33]
and a Bayesian analysis using MRBAYES [34]. Both phylogenetic analyses classified the MCM homologues as
belonging to specific paralogue families and resolved the
eukaryotic Mcm2-7 paralogues into six distinct monophyletic groups (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4). Each MCM
paralogous set was supported by moderate to high ML
bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities
(Mcm2: 96%/1.00 respectively; Mcm3: 92%/1.00; Mcm4:
98%/1.00; Mcm5: 94%/1.00; Mcm6: 74%/1.00; Mcm7:
68%/1.00) (Fig. 1B and Additional files 1, 2, 3). These
results support the conclusion that all six Mcm2-7 proteins were present in the LCEA and that consecutive duplication, which formed these six defined MCM paralogues,
occurred prior to the diversification of the sampled
eukaryotic taxa.

Our phylogenetic analyses also grouped Mcm8 and Mcm9
into two distinct monophyletic groups supported by ML
bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities
(Mcm8: 74%/1.00; Mcm9: 75%/0.99) and placed Mcm8
and Mcm9 as sister paralogues to the exclusion of all other
MCM paralogues (68% ML bootstrap support) (Fig. 1B
and Additional file 4). This shared derived ancestry and
linked pattern of presence and absence suggest that Mcm8
and Mcm9 have both co-function and distinct co-ancestry.
Both phylogenetic analyses failed to resolve the branching
relationship between the MCM paralogues. To attempt to
resolve these relationships a "Noah's Ark" dataset was
analysed comprising a more limited sampling of eukaryotes from each major taxon (species indicated by asterisks
in Fig 1); this also failed to yield resolution in the backbone of the tree (Additional file 5). The lack of resolution
among these ancient paralogue groups may be the consequence of lack of signal within the relatively short alignment used for phylogenetic analyses (240 amino acid
characters). This feature could also be a product of a hard

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/60

polytomy or the rapid consecutive duplication of MCM
parental forms into eight paralogues at the base of the
eukaryotic tree resulting in limited availability of evolutionary signal to support the relative branching order of
the MCM paralogues.
Previous studies on DNA replication of Archaea have
already shown that the core replication machineries of the
eukaryotes and Archaea possess fundamental similarities
and have many homologous protein components [35],
indicative of common ancestry. There is currently no
known eubacterial homologue to the eukaryotic MCMs
but we identified a single highly conserved MCM homologue in all the Archaea studied (except Methanococcus jannaschii which possesses four MCM proteins). Our
phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the four paralogues in the complete genome sequence of the euryarchaeote M. jannaschii can be best explained by a series of
Archaea-specific gene duplications (98% ML bootstrap
support) (Additional file 4) which occurred separately
from the eukaryotic MCM gene duplications. Our analyses therefore suggest that the eukaryotic Mcm2-9 may be
derived by gene duplication events from a single,
archaeal-like, ancestral MCM and the diversification of
this archaeal-like MCM would have given rise to Mcm2-9
encoded in the genome of the LCEA.
The phylogeny and evolution of Drosophila Mcm8
Drosophila melanogaster was the only species sampled that
did not show co-possession or co-absence of Mcm8 and
Mcm9. Our general MCM phylogeny suggested that the D.
melanogaster Mcm8 protein was highly divergent (Additional file 4). To further investigate the apparent loss of
Mcm9 and radical divergence of Mcm8 in Drosophila species we conducted an animal Mcm8 and 9 phylogenetic
analysis which included a sampling of all 12 Drosophila
genomes and additional Insecta genome sequences, plus
additional outgroups. The Mcm8 and Mcm9 comparative
genomic analyses and phylogeny demonstrated the
monophyletic groupings of Mcm8 and Mcm9 and confirmed the absence of Mcm9 in all the Drosophila species
(100% ML bootstrap support and 1.00 Bayesian posterior
probability; Fig. 2). This analysis also demonstrated that
the Drosophila Mcm8 cluster formed an extremely long
branch within the animal Mcm8 clade (100% ML bootstrap support and 1.00 Bayesian posterior probability; Fig.
2) suggesting a pattern of radical evolutionary change specifically in the Drosophila Mcm8 gene family. The divergence of Drosophila Mcm8 from other Mcm8 sequences
may be related to the absence of Mcm9 in Drosophila or a
radical change in functional role.
Gain and loss of Mcm8 and Mcm9 in eukaryotic evolution
The comparative genomics studies of MCMs have revealed
that Mcm8 and Mcm9 are widely distributed in (at least)

five of the six eukaryotic supergroups and only absent in
some opisthokonts, excavates and chromalveolates. By
adapting current understandings on the phylogenetic and
taxonomic groupings of the eukaryotes [26-28,36] it is

possible to make some deductions about gain and loss
events of Mcm8 and Mcm9 across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree. The presence of Mcm8 and Mcm9 in five of
the six supergroups suggests that Mcm8 and Mcm9 also

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:60

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/60

arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Mcm8 and Mcm9
were both absent from all analysed fungal genomes, with
the exception of Encephalitozoon and Batrachochytrium. In
comparison to the current consensus fungal phylogeny
[37,38], these data suggest that the loss of Mcm8 and 9 in
the fungi was probably a shared loss event in the last common ancestor of the ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and
zygomycetes sampled. Further secondary loss events were
identified in the Apicomplexa Cryptosporidium and in the
animal Caenorhabditis lineages.
Mcm8 and 9 were absent in the excavates Giardia and Trichomonas which according to some schemes for the
eukaryotic phylogeny are potentially the primary branch

in the eukaryotic phylogeny [39]. Since the root of the
eukaryotic tree is still unclear, when the Mcm8 and Mcm9
paralogues originated within the eukaryotic phylogeny
remains a puzzle. However, a homologue of Mcm8 was
detected as a partial sequence in Genome Survey
Sequences (GSS) data for the diplomonad Spironucleus
barkhanus, which is a close relative of Giardia. This suggests that Mcm8 and possibly Mcm9 originated before the
common ancestor of Giardia and Trichomonas branched
from the base of the eukaryotic tree and that Mcm8 and
Mcm9 were also present in the LCEA. This identifies at
least two additional cases of Mcm8-9 co-loss within the
'metamonads' [40,41] including one loss in the diplomonads (Giardia) and the parabasalids (Trichomonas).

Phylogenetic analysis of animal Mcm8 and Mcm9
Phylogenetic analysis of animal Mcm8 and Mcm9. This analysis was conducted to investigate the diversification and
branching position of the Drosophila Mcm8 proteins as Drosophila is the only lineage with an Mcm8 but with no Mcm9. The analysis shows that the Drosophila Mcm8 proteins are highly divergent. The phylogeny shown is a calculated from an amino acid
alignment of 43 sequences and 366 characters. The tree topology shown was calculated using PHYML methods. Mcm8 paralogues are shown in blue and Mcm9 paralogues in pink. The orange coloured block indicates the relationship of Drosophila spp.
Mcm8 with Mcm8 sequences from other animals plus additional outgroups. Numbers on nodes indicate the ML bootstraps and
Bayesian posterior probabilities (bootstrap values below 50% and posterior probabilities below 0.90 are not shown). The phylogeny is shown as rooted on the Mcm9 paralogue.

Together this suggests at least five separate cases of paired
Mcm8 and 9 loss during the eukaryotic radiation, providing indirect support for the hypothesis that Mcm8 and 9
may have some currently unidentified interdependent
functional roles.
Reciprocity between MCM evolution and function studies
In most Archaea, a single MCM forms a homohexamer. A
number of archaeal MCMs have been demonstrated to act
as a helicase to unwind double-stranded DNA [35]. Helicase activity of eukaryotic MCMs has been found in vitro
in a sub-complex of Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 [42] or in a
super-complex of Mcm2-7 with Cdc45 and GINS accessory proteins [9,10]. The comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of MCMs have revealed that the LCEA
possessed all six Mcm2-7 proteins, which seem to have
diversified from a single archaeal-like, ancestral MCM.
This suggests that the ancestral enzymatic activity of
eukaryotic Mcm2-7 proteins is unwinding DNA as a
processive helicase. Because both eukaryotes and Archaea
have a functional complex of six individual MCMs it is
likely that early eukaryotes also had a six-protein MCM
functional complex. However, eukaryotes replaced a single gene six-protein complex with a six gene six-protein
complex.

Mcm8 and Mcm9 have received relatively few functional
studies. Mcm8 has been characterised recently in humans,
Xenopus and Drosophila [12-17,43]. Human and Xenopus
Mcm8 function in DNA replication, although there is no
consensus regarding their exact role(s); early evidence suggested this may be in the elongation phase of DNA replication [12,13], but human Mcm8 has also been shown to
associate and co-localise with Cdc6, an Mcm2-7 loading
factor, implying a role in pre-RC formation [14,15]. The
early evolutionary acquisitions of Mcm8 and Mcm9 suggest that Mcm8 in other eukaryotes might also have similar roles. The putative co-function of Mcm8 and Mcm9 as
demonstrated by the pattern of co-presence, co-loss and
distinct co-ancestry suggests that Mcm9 is also involved in
DNA replication; this is supported by the recent demonstration that that Xenopus Mcm9 acts as a positive regulator of the Mcm2-7 loading factor Cdt1 and is required for
assembly of pre-replication complexes [44]. Future comparative studies on Mcm8 and 9 functions will be informative.
In addition, a role in meiotic recombination has been
identified for the Drosophila Mcm8, REC [16,17]. Drosophila was the only eukaryote analysed which has Mcm8
but lacks Mcm9 suggesting, if the co-function and distinct
co-ancestry hypothesis is correct, that REC may have
assumed the function of both proteins or acquired a novel
function that does not require Mcm9 specifically in Drosophila. Mcm8 and Mcm9 are therefore likely to co-func-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/60

tion in meiotic recombination in other eukaryotic
lineages, but further work is required to investigate this
hypothesis. The loss of Mcm8 and Mcm9 in some
opisthokont lineages and Cryptosporidium could mean
that Mcm8 and Mcm9 are dispensable for meiotic recombination or other unknown functions. Comparative
genomics analyses of meiotic genes indicate that Giardia
possesses several protein components required for meiosis [45,46]. Further studies should attempt to investigate
and compare meiosis and Mcm8 and Mcm9 function
between Giardia and other eukaryotes capable of sexual
reproduction and which encode Mcm8 and Mcm9.
Functional studies on Mcm10 proteins suggest that
Mcm10 is required for both DNA initiation and elongation phase of DNA replication [8]. In yeast and Xenopus,
Mcm10 binds to both chromatin and the Mcm2-7 complex and recruits Cdc45 and DNA polymerase α-primase
to replication origins [47-50]. Mcm10 forms part of the
replisome complex that migrates away from replication
origins during S-phase [50,51] and is required for stability
and activity of the initiating polymerase, DNA polymerase
α-primase [50,52]. Mcm10 homologues were found neither in Archaea nor in Eubacteria; the appearance of this
protein seems to be unique within eukaryotes. The evolutionary pattern of Mcm10 (Table 1) indicates the importance and functional similarities of Mcm10 homologues
within the eukaryotic genomes analysed.

Conclusion
We have carried out a broad and deep phylogenetic analysis of MCM proteins involved in DNA replication.
Eukaryote genomes encode up to nine such proteins all of
which have an ancient origin and diversification within
the eukaryotic lineage. Subunits of the Mcm2-7 hexamer
appear to be universally present in eukaryotic taxa, as predicted by their likely DNA helicase role in DNA replication. Mcm2-9 distribution demonstrates diversification
by gene duplication prior to the LCEA of extant eukaryotic
supergroups. Mcm8 and 9 paralogues exhibit a distribution pattern characteristic of interdependent loss events in
some taxa. Co-loss suggests related functions for Mcm8
and 9, which may play more peripheral roles in the cell
than Mcm2-7. Finally, the non-homologous Mcm10 protein appears to be exclusively eukaryotic and exhibits
greater sequence divergence across taxa than the Mcm2-9
family.

Methods
Sequence Data
We compared the DNA scaffold predicted transcriptome,
and the annotated protein databases of 37 complete or
draft eukaryotic genome sequence databases listed in
Additional file 6.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:60

In addition to the predicted eukaryotic protein databases,
predicted protein databases of Archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Thermofilum pendens, Methanococcus jannaschii,
Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Thermoplasma volcanium, Pyrococcus
horikoshii, Nanoarchaeum equitans and Halobacterium sp.
were also sampled to use as outgroups for the phylogenetic analyses. Archaeal genomes were available from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. To further confirm that no
MCM homologues were detected in eubacterial genomes
we also performed 'eubacterial'-restricted tBLASTn,
BLASTp and PSI-BLAST searches of GenBank non-redundant sequence databases.
Identifying Mcm2-7, Mcm8 and Mcm9 homologues
Homologous sequences of Mcm2 to Mcm7 proteins were
identified by performing an all-against-all search of
eukaryotic (listed in Additional file 6) and archaeal protein databases using the BLASTp algorithm with a cutoff
expectation (E) value of 1 × 10-20. Candidates were tested
by reciprocal BLAST searches. Mcm8 and Mcm9 homologues were checked by using both BLASTp and tBLASTn
searches in BLAST options of the respective genome
projects (listed in Additional file 6), with putative Mcm8
and Mcm9 protein sequences of closely related taxa as a
BLAST seed for these sub-analyses. These multiple BLAST
searches using paralogous genes as search seeds were conducted to ensure that all available paralogues were sampled from each of the target genomes. In cases of apparent
absence, EST and GSS data of closely-related species were
also searched. All candidate MCM proteins were checked
by performing an NCBI Conserved Domain Database
(CDD) search to confirm that all amino acid sequences
sampled possessed an MCM domain. This analytical process recovered a number of protein sequences that were
annotated as putative Mcm2-7 but were potentially misclassified paralogues. We therefore based our paralogue
designation on phylogenetic analyses reported below.
Identifying Mcm10 homologues
A search for Mcm10 homologues was performed with
BLASTp and tBLASTn. The E-value of 1 × 10-4 was used as
cutoff to define Mcm10 homologous proteins. PSI-BLAST
searches and local Pfam searches of eukaryotic databases
were performed in order to identify more divergent
Mcm10 homologues. PSI-BLAST searches were terminated after three iterations and revealed putative Naegleria
Mcm10 (E-value = 3 × 10-9 in PSI-BLAST iteration 2), Trichomonas Mcm10 (E-value = 1 × 10-6 in PSI-BLAST iteration 2) and Chlamydomonas Mcm10 (E-value = 1 × 10-37 in
PSI-BLAST iteration 3), expanding the taxonomic distribution and evolutionary history of the Mcm10 protein
family. Local Pfam searches were performed using the
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of Mcm10 domain
available from Pfam (PF09332) [53] using the program

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/60

HMMER http://hmmer.janelia.org/; no further potential
Mcm10 homologues were detected.
Eukaryotic Mcm2-9 phylogeny
The 290 putative MCM protein sequences were extracted
and aligned using the multiple sequence alignment program MUSCLE [54] using the default settings. Putative
Ostreococcus Mcm7 and Aureococcus Mcm8 had partial or
comparatively 'noisy' sequences so were excluded from
the analysis. The hypothetical Plasmodium berghei MCM
genes were excluded because they were highly divergent
and the sequences could not be aligned with confidence
for the phylogenetic analysis. This process produced a
multiple amino acid sequence alignment of 280
sequences which was manually corrected and then
masked using the alignment editor SEAVIEW [55]. We
masked the alignment prior to phylogenetic analyses to
remove noisy or gappy regions and to focus the character
sampling on the conserved MCM box region [5,32]. Xenopus zygotic Mcm3 [GenBank:Q7ZXZ0] and zygotic Mcm6
[GenBank:NP_001080590] were removed as they differed
by only few amino acid residues from maternal Mcm3
and Mcm6 respectively after masking. This process produced an alignment of 278 sequences and 240 amino acid
characters for phylogenetic analysis. Because of the size of
this dataset we found that we could not execute the MODELGENERATOR [56] program even using relatively powerful computer platforms. Fast ML analyses were
performed using the software PHYML with the WAG substitution matrix and the proportion of invariable sites (I)
and eight category gamma distribution (Γ) estimated by
PHYML [33]. 100 bootstrap replicates were calculated
using PHYML to test topological support. To test alternative substitution matrices we repeated the analysis using
the recently-developed LG matrix [57] which has been
reported as an improvement on the WAG matrix. This
analysis gave a similar result with slightly reduced bootstrap support values for the monophyly of the MCM paralogues (Additional file 7). Bayesian analysis was
performed using MRBAYES [34], using the WAG substitution matrix as for the fast ML analysis. MRBAYES was run
with two sets of four simultaneous Markov chains with a
default temperature string and for 2 million generations
and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The log
likelihood output was compared across both runs and a
burn-in of 5000 generation samples was excluded and a
consensus phylogeny calculated from the remaining samples. The outputs of all analyses were viewed by the software TREEVIEW [58]. A "Noah's Ark" dataset was also
analysed which comprised 14 eukaryotes (indicated by
asterisks in Fig 1) sampled from each major taxon and
included 120 sequences and an alignment sampling of
307 amino acid characters. MODELGENERATOR identified RtREV+Γ as the most appropriate substitution matrix
with eight discrete categories and estimated the gamma

distribution (Γ) parameter α as 0.49. 100 bootstrap replicates were calculated using PHYML.
Animal Mcm8 and Mcm9 phylogeny
The general eukaryotic analyses demonstrate a potentially
complicated pattern of gene loss for Mcm8 and Mcm9
across the animals. Homologues of Capitella sp., Ciona
intestinalis, Daphnia pulex, Tribolium castaneum, Anopheles
gambiae, Apis mellifera, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Xenopus laevis, Lottia gigantea, Nematostella vectensis, Trichoplax
adhaerens (representing a wide taxonomic span of animals) and 12 Drosophila species were sampled and used
for an additional animal-specific Mcm8 and Mcm9 phylogenetic analysis including 43 sequences and an alignment sampling of 366 amino acid characters. Amoebozoa
Dictyostelium, the fungus Batrachochytrium and the choanoflagellate Monosiga Mcm8 and Mcm9 were included as
outgroup taxa. This animal-specific Mcm8 and Mcm9
phylogeny was analysed using the same procedure as
before. MODELGENERATOR identified RtREV+Γ as the
most appropriate model with eight discrete categories and
estimated the Γ parameter α as 0.93. Bootstrap analysis
was carried out with 500 replicates. For the Bayesian analysis, we also analysed the Mcm8 and 9 phylogeny using
MRBAYES with an RtREV+Γ model of sequence substitution. The Bayesian analysis was run as above but for one
million generations with the first 400 generation samples
discarded as burn-in. Both results were displayed using
TREEVIEW.

Treefile for "Noah's Ark" dataset phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic
Mcm2-9. To attempt to further resolve the phylogeny of the Mcm2-9 proteins, specifically the branching relationships among the eight MCM paralogues, we conducted a reduced taxon phylogeny. In this analysis we used
a limited sampling of eukaryotes from each major taxon (species indicated
by asterisks in Figure 1) with the hope that the resulting reduction in tree
space would enable us to resolve an improved phylogeny. The analysis did
not show improved resolution among the terminal branches. The tree was
calculated from an alignment of 120 sequences and 307 characters by fast
ML analysis using PHYML with 100 bootstrap replicates. The tree can be
