Abstract
: DNA topoisomerase IB (TopoIB) was thought for a long time to be a eukaryotic specific enzyme.
A shorter version was then found in viruses and later on in several bacteria, but not in archaea.
Here, we show that a eukaryotic-like TopoIB is present in the recently sequenced genomes of two
archaea of the newly proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that a
TopoIB was present in the last common ancestor of Archaea and Eucarya. This finding indicates
that the last common ancestor of Archaea and Eucarya may have harboured a DNA genome.

Findings
DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that control
DNA topology and solve topological conflicts arising during DNA replication, transcription, and recombination
[1-3] (For a recent review on DNA topoisomerases see also
[4]). Based on their mechanisms of action, DNA topoisomerases belong to two classes, type I (Topo I) and type
II (Topo II): Topo I change the number of DNA topological links by introducing transient single-stranded breaks
in the DNA molecule, whereas Topo II introduce transient
double-stranded breaks. According to phylogenetic criteria, both Topo II and Topo I classes regroup several families of unrelated (i.e. non homologous) proteins: Topo IIA
and IIB on one hand, and Topo IA (that also includes the
so-called Topo III of eukaryotes and bacteria), IB and IC
on the other hand [5,6]. This indicates that enzymes with
either Topo I or Topo II activity originated multiple times

independently in the course of evolution. For instance,
Topo IIA and IIB share a homologous ATP binding subunit, but their DNA cleavage-religation subunits are non
homologous and are structurally unrelated [2,7]. Regarding Topo I enzymes, Topo IA, which form a transient covalent link in 5' of the DNA break during the reaction of
topoisomerization, share a Toprim domain with Topo II,
some nucleases and primases [8], whereas Topo IB, which
form a transient covalent link in 3' of the DNA break, are
distantly related to tyrosine recombinases [2,9]. Although
Topo IC forms a 3' DNA link similarly to Topo IB, it harbors a novel unique fold, and is unrelated to Topo IB and
tyrosine recombinases [10]. The three different Topo I
families show very distinctive distributions in the living
world: Topo IA are present in currently available complete
genomes of organisms from the three domains of life [6],
whereas Topo IC appears so far specific to one particular

species, the archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri [5]. Finally,
Topo IB is present in eukaryotes, in poxviruses, in the
mimivirus, and in some bacteria [6,10,11].
Topo IB (sometimes named swivelase) was first described
in mouse and plays a very important role [1,12]. Indeed,
whereas Topo IA can only relax negative superturns, Topo
IB can relax both positive and negative superturns in vitro.
As a consequence, eukaryotic Topo IB may relax the positive superturns that accumulate in front of replication
forks or transcription bubbles during DNA replication,
transcription, and chromatin assembly. In addition, Topo
IB may also relax the compensatory positive superturns
that form when the DNA becomes negatively wrapped
around the histone octamer during nucleosome formation. Although these tasks can be fulfilled also by Topo II
enzymes, genetic analyses have clearly indicated that
Topo IB plays a major role in DNA replication, transcription and chromatin assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[13-15]. Testifying for its crucial role in eukaryotes, Topo
IB is the target of one of the most important antitumoral
drugs, camptothecin [16]. Topo IB have been discovered
in Poxviruses by Bauer and colleagues in 1977 [17], and
the vaccinia virus Topo IB has been widely used as a
model system to decipher the catalytic activity of this
enzyme [18-20] and more recently to search for new antiviral drugs [21]. However, viral Topo IB are quite different
from their eukaryotic counterparts, since they harbour a
specific domain (virDNA-Topo-I_N) in their N-terminus
instead of the long Topoisom_I_N domain found in
eukaryotic homologues (Figure 1A and Additional files
1). Recently, homologues of Topo IB have been detected
in several bacterial genomes and one of these has been
characterized from Deinococcus radiodurans [22]. These
bacterial Topo IB harbour a domain organisation close to
the viral enzymes (Figure 1A and Additional files 1).
Up to now, Topo IB have never been observed in Archaea,
in sharp contrast to members of the Topo IA family which
are present in one or more copies in all archaeal genomes
[6] (Additional files 2 and 3). Surprisingly, we recently
noticed that a Topo IB coding gene was identified in the
genome of the archaeon Cenarchaeum symbiosum [23,24],
but that a Topo IA coding gene was absent [24]. Phylogenetic analyses of the archaeal domain based on concatenation of ribosomal proteins and comparative genome
analysis have recently led us to propose that C. symbiosum
and its relatives, formerly included in the phylum Crenarchaeota, should be considered as members of a separate
and possibly ancient phylum, that we proposed to name
Thaumarchaeota [24]. We predicted that the absence of a
Topo IA and the presence of a Topo IB might be a distinctive feature of all thaumarchaeota members. As expected,
we have detected an archaeal Topo IB homologue

ase, in the recently sequenced genome of a second thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus [25], which also
lacks a Topo IA homologue. Both thaumarchaeal Topo IB
display a domain organisation that is very similar to that
of their eukaryotic homologues, since these harbour both
the N-terminal Topoisom_I_N and the C-terminal
Topoisom_I domain (Figure 1A and Additional files 1).
The main difference between the eukaryotic and the
archaeal Topo IB is that the former possess a long and
highly variable extension upstream of the Topoisom_I_N
domain that is absent in the archaeal sequences (Figure
1A and Additional files 1). Two hypotheses can be proposed to explain the presence of a Topo IB coding gene in
Thaumarchaeota. One is that this gene was acquired by
the last common ancestor of Thaumarchaeota via a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (blue arrow, Figure 1B-a). In
that case, the donor would have been a eukaryote since
both the thaumarchaeal and the eukaryotic Topo IB harbour a similar domain organisation. Alternatively, a Topo
IB coding gene might have been present in the last common ancestor of Archaea and Eucarya and was then lost in
all archaea, except in the lineage leading to Thaumarchaeota (Figures 1Bb-d). To distinguish between these two
hypotheses on the origin of thaumarchaeal Topo IB, we
have performed an in-depth phylogenetic analysis of
Topo IB homologues.
We retrieved homologues of Topo IB from the nr database
at the NCBI (117 sequences from Eucarya, 2 from
Archaea, 152 from Bacteria and 30 from viruses), as well
as some environmental putative thaumarchaeal
sequences from the GOS project [26] at the NCBI (For
more details, see Additional files 2). We then selected 151
sequences representatives of Topo IB diversity for phylogenetic analysis. The resulting maximum likelihood tree
(Figure 2) shows that the two archaeal Topo IB group with
the few environmental sequences (BV = 100%) confirming that these are likely from yet uncultivated representatives of Thaumarchaeota. Although thaumarchaeal
sequences are not yet abundant in environmental databases, this suggests that the presence of Topo IB is very
likely a characteristic of this phylum. Moreover, thaumarchaeal Topo IB form a strongly supported sister-group to
their eukaryotic homologues (BV = 100%). This sistergrouping of eukaryotic and thaumarchaeal sequences is
also strongly supported when other reconstruction methods are used (not shown). The fact that thaumarchaeal
sequences are sister to eukaryotes and do not arise from
within them, coupled to the absence of the N-terminal
extension in the archaeal sequences, strongly suggest that
Thaumarchaeota did not acquire their Topo IB gene from
a present-day eukaryotic lineage via a recent HGT. Based
on phylogenetic and genomic analysis, we have recently
proposed that Thaumarchaeota may represent the deepest
branching lineage in the archaeal phylogeny, i.e. they

Alternative evolutionary scenarios explaining the presence of Topo IB in Thaumarchaeota. Filled blue diamonds indicate the
presence of a Topo IB coding gene. Empty blue diamonds indicate a Topo IB coding gene that were present in the ancestor of
the corresponding lineage and lost during its evolution. Blue crosses indicate the loss events of Topo IB coding genes. (a) A
Topo IB coding gene was acquired by the ancestor of Thaumarchaeota via horizontal gene transfer (blue arrow) from a eukaryotic lineage. (b), (c) and (d) A Topo IB coding gene was present in the ancestor of Archaea and Eucarya and was subsequently
lost in the ancestor of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, in agreement with a thaumarchaeal rooting of the archaeal tree (B).
The Topo IB coding gene was independently lost in the ancestors of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota according to an euryarchaeal or crenarchaeal rooting of the archaeal tree (C and D).

emerged before the divergence between Euryarchaeota
and Crenarchaeota [24]. This proposal is consistent with
a large scale analysis performed by Koonin and collaborators [27]. The basal branching of Thaumarchaeota is also
supported by the fact that, as in eukaryotes, the largest
subunit of the RNA polymerase is not split in C. symbiosum
and N. maritimus whereas it is split in A00 and A0
polypeptides in all other archaea for which sequences are
available [28]. In order to account for the observed distribution of Topo IB in modern archaea, a deep branching of
Thaumarchaeota requires only one evolutionary event
(the loss of the Topo IB gene in an ancestor of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, after their divergence from Thaumarchaeota) (blue cross, Figure 1B-b). Accordingly, the
presence of a Topo IB in C. symbiosum and N. maritimus
may represent an ancestral archaeal feature. In contrast, if
the root of the archaeal tree is located in either the euryarchaeal or the crenarchaeal branch, two independent losses
of Topo IB would be required to explain the observed data
(i.e. in the ancestor of Crenarchaeota and in the ancestor
of Euryarchaeota, blue crosses, Figure 1B-c and 1B-d).
Thus, the evolutionary history of Topo IB provides additional and independent evidence consistently with a rooting of the archaeal tree in the thaumarchaeal branch [24].
Topo IB have been for long thought to be absent in
Archaea. Our finding now extends the presence of Topo IB
homologues in members of all three domains of life. This
may thus suggest that this enzyme was already present in
the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). However,
Topo IB homologues are either absent or scarcely distributed in complete genomes from most main bacterial
phyla (Additional files 3). Moreover, the bacterial part of
the Topo IB tree is not congruent with the bacterial specie
tree (i.e. the monophyly of main bacterial groups is not
recovered, Figure 2), suggesting that the history of Topo IB
in Bacteria was dominated by lateral gene transfers. It was

previously suggested that the viral-like Topo IB found in
Bacteria was originally introduced from a DNA virus [6].
Our new and more detailed phylogenetic analysis, as well
as the similarity of the domain organisation of viral and
bacterial Topo IB, confirms the close relationship between
these sequences and their probable common ancestry,
although the direction of transfer is yet unclear.
The likely presence of both a Topo IA and Topo IB in the
last common archaeal ancestor ([6] and this study, respectively), suggests that this ancestor was possibly more
"complex" than modern archaea (if complexity is defined
in terms of number of genes and/or redundancy of cellular processes). This idea was already proposed by
Lecompte et al. who highlighted a streamlining in the evolution of archaeal ribosomes [29]. This is consistent with
the recent observation that several proteins common to
Archaea and Eukaryotes are missing in either Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota or Thaumarchaeota [27] and may indicate a possible tendency of evolution by streamlining of
some central molecular processes in the archaeal domain.
Finally, one of us has recently proposed that a transition
from RNA genomes to DNA genomes occurred independently in each of the three life domains by the contribution
of three different DNA viruses to three complex RNA cells
[30]. The idea of different DNA viruses at the origin of
Archaea and Eucarya sought to explain the existence of
several critical differences in their DNA replication systems, including the ancestral presence of a Topo IB exclusively in Eucarya. Our finding that the last common
ancestor of Archaea and Eucarya probably contained a
Topo IB weakens this argument, and is more in favour of
a DNA genome for this ancestor.

'A DNA topoisomerase IB in Thaumarchaeota testifies for
the presence of this enzyme in the last common ancestor
of Archaea and Eukaryotes"
This is a very straightforward study of the Topo IB of Thaumarchaeota (formerly, mesophilic Crenarchaeota).demonstrating that the archaeal TopoIB clusters with the
eukaryotic orthologs, at the base of the eukaryotic subtree.
Combined with the fact that the archaeal and eukaryotic
Topo IB proteins have similar domain organizations,
these findings clearly demonstrate their monophyly.
1) I think, however, this is where the certainty stops.
Indeed, I do not believe that the scenario with horizontal
transfer of the eukaryotic Topo IB gene into the common
ancestor of Thaumarchaeota can be considered rigorously
falsified because it is hardly possible to rule out a dramatic
acceleration of evolution after the transfer, resulting in the
observed tree topology. PHyml is relatively robust to this
sort of artifacts but there are inescapable limits. Ditto
regarding the presence of Topo IB: the results of this work
add credence to such a conclusion but alternatives based
on horizontal gene transfer cannot be ruled out. I think
the paper would become better balanced if these uncertainties were acknowledged, and the conclusions, especially, those at the end of the Abstract are toned down. In
particular, the "support" of the Thaumaarcaheal rooting
of the tree inferred from the phylogenetic analysis of this
single gene is very weak, and it would be better to speak of
the compatibility of the results with such rooting.
We think that the hypothesis of a HGT from present days
eukaryotes to the ancestor of Thaumarchaeota is less likely than
the hypothesis of the presence of a Topo IB gene in the ancestor
of Eucarya and Archaea, followed by the loss of gene in the
ancestor of Euryarchaeota/Crenarchaeota. However, as pointed
out by referee two, we present both hypotheses and said carefully
in the text that our phylogenetic analysis as the domain organisation of Topo IB homologues "strongly suggest".
Concerning the phylogenetic analyses, we used alternative
methods to ML (as Bayesian methods), all the resulting trees
strongly support the sister-grouping of Thaumarchaeota and
Eucarya. We add this point in the text.

2) I also think that another adjustment, a less fundamental but, perhaps, even more badly needed one relates to
the very "discovery" of the archaeal Topo IB. The protein
sequence is very well conserved, so it is somewhat disingenuous to claim the finding of Topo IB as a discovery
sensu strictu. The Cenarchaeum Topo IB is annotated in
GenBank as such; it is another matter that the presence of
this interesting gene in the Cenarchaeum genome is not
highlighted in the primary paper (Hallam et al. PNAS
2006, 103: 18296) although "two topoisomerases" are
mentioned. In any case, I do not think that it is proper to
claim this finding in itself as a "discovery"; it would be
much better to cite Hallam et al., and to explain the entire
situation.
We cite the paper describing the genome of C. symbiosum and
explain in the text, that one of the two DNA topoisomerases
coding genes identified in the genome of C. symbiosum codes
for a Topo IB, and that surprisingly no Topo IA coding gene was
present in this genome.
Conversely, the ortholog from Nitrosopumilis is mistakenly
annotated as some completely unrelated enzyme, and I
think it is desirable to correct this (trivial) error. These corrections will not detract from the message of the present
article but will make it better balanced.
We mention the fact that the gene coding for a putative homologue of TopoIB in N. maritimus was misannotated in this
genome.
Anthony Poole
This succinct report presents a nice phylogenetic result
that provides two important evolutionary insights. The
first is that the identification of Topo IB topoisomerases
within members of the recently proposed archaeal phylum Thaumarchaeota (together with a supporting phylogenetic analysis) indicates that a Topo IB enzyme was
likely present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes and
archaea. This potentially tells us two things. First, if the
presence of Topo IB within archaea is restricted to the
Thaumarchaea, it strengthens the view that this is a genuine phylum (as recently proposed by these authors – ref.
[24]). In that paper, the authors presented evidence that
the mesophilic archaeon, Crenarchaeum symbiosum did not
group within the Crenarchaea, and that, in their trees, this
species was likewise distinct from Euryarchaeota. If the
basal position of Thaumarchaeota is correct, the implication is that Topo IB was lost early in archaeal evolution,
prior to the divergence of Euryarchaea and Crenarchaea.
While their results (in ref. [24]) indicated that C. symbiosum is basal to the archaeal tree, in the current paper, they
nevertheless approach this with caution, and provide us
with three different scenarios (Figure 1B) that serve as a
valuable framework for evaluating the implications of the

conservation of eukaryotic and archaeal Topo IB (the
fourth, transfer from eukaryotes – their Figure 1B-a – can
be ruled out on the phylogenetic results presented). Figure
1B is therefore a very welcome addition to this paper
because it allows the reader to evaluate the data and phylogeny in Figure 1B with respect to several hypotheses.
Too often we see only one possible hypothesis being presented (and one sometimes gets a sense that the analysis
of the data in a particular way is a foregone conclusion),
so it is nice to see that the authors have thought this
through carefully, and are both aware of and open to the
compexities of interpretation.
The second insight is that placement of this topoisomerase type in the common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes strengthens the evidence that this ancestor had a DNAbased genome. This point might need brief explanation.
While the naïve expectation is that DNA was present in
the Last Universal Common Ancestor, the available comparative genomic data on enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and DNA replication do not allow
this conclusion to be readily drawn. In light of these conflicting data, Forterre recently proposed a model (ref.
[30]) wherein each domain may have independently
gained the capacity for DNA synthesis. The essence of the
model (an arms race between cells and viruses) is very elegant, and invokes known processes (there are several cases
where viruses are known to carry altered genomes – phage
genomes with uracil instead of thymine, for example). It
is exciting to see that the discovery of Thaumarchaeal
Topo IB helps to improve our understanding of DNA origins in that its inclusion supports a less complex scenario
(i.e. at most two independent gains).

presence of a virDNA-Topo-I_N-like domain in these sequences.
