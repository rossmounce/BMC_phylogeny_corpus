Abstract
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transmembrane proteins that can
transport a wide variety of substrates across biological membranes in an energy-dependent
manner. Many ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated
protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are highly expressed in bronchial
epithelium. This review aims to give new insights in the possible functions of ABC molecules in the
lung in view of their expression in different cell types. Furthermore, their role in protection against
noxious compounds, e.g. air pollutants and cigarette smoke components, will be discussed as well
as the (mal)function in normal and pathological lung. Several pulmonary drugs are substrates for
ABC transporters and therefore, the delivery of these drugs to the site of action may be highly
dependent on the presence and activity of many ABC transporters in several cell types. Three ABC
transporters are known to play an important role in lung functioning. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene can cause cystic fibrosis, and mutations in
ABCA1 and ABCA3 are responsible for respectively Tangier disease and fatal surfactant deficiency.
The role of altered function of ABC transporters in highly prevalent pulmonary diseases such as
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have hardly been investigated so far. We
especially focused on polymorphisms, knock-out mice models and in vitro results of pulmonary
research. Insight in the function of ABC transporters in the lung may open new ways to facilitate
treatment of lung diseases.

Introduction
The prime role of the airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles) is to conduct air into and
out of the lung and to form a first line of defence against
undesired constituents of inhaled air. The airways are con-

tinuously exposed to pathogens, irritants, pollutants and
agents that produce oxidative stress and therefore, the
composition of the respiratory tract surface is very important. The upper airways contain specialised cell types such
as ciliated cells and mucous secreting goblet cells. The

lower conducting airways (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs) participate in gas exchange by
diffusion. The alveolar epithelial surface comprises essentially two cell types, the alveolar epithelial type I cell and
the cuboidal alveolar epithelial type II cell. Type I cells
flatten out and in this way constitute approximately 95%
of the total alveolar surface, whereas type II cells are more
numerous and produce surfactant [1].
ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are a family of
transmembrane proteins that can transport a wide variety
of substrates across biological membranes in an energydependent manner. They are phylogenetically classified in
seven distinct subfamilies of transporters (ABCA to
ABCG), which are again divided into subgroups. To date,
48 ABC transporters have been detected in the human
body [2,3]. Overexpression of ABC transporters such as Pglycoprotein (P-gp) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) were initially detected in tumour
cell lines. Their overexpression is associated with
increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs such as
anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins and vinca-alkaloids,
and this can result in so-called multidrug resistance
(MDR). Many MDR proteins can act as drug efflux pumps,
resulting in decreased intracellular concentrations of toxic
compounds at the site of action. MRP1 and P-gp expression in the lung have especially been studied in the context of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently we know that ABC transporters are present in virtually every cell of all species and
play central roles in physiology. The prominent expression of P-gp and MRP1 in the human lung [4] suggests
that these transporters may be pivotal in the protection
against endogenous or exogenous toxic compounds entering the lung.The delivery of pulmonary drugs to reach the
site of action may also depend on the presence and activity of many ABC transporters [5]. Langmann et al. developed quantitative real-time RT-PCR expression profiling
of 47 ABC transporters in 20 different human tissues. Tissues with a barrier function such as lung and trachea were
identified to have high transcriptional activity for many
ABC transporters [6]. There are already clear proofs of
important functions of ABC transporters in the lung. The
ABC transporter most widely investigated is the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),
because mutations in this gene are responsible for the
development of cystic fibrosis [7]. Mutations in ABCA1
are causative for Tangier disease [8]. In newborns it was
shown that mutations in ABCA3 cause aberrant production of surfactant which can be lethal [9]. The role of
altered function of ABC transporters in highly prevalent
pulmonary diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) have hardly been investigated
so far [10].

This review aims to give new insights in the possible functions of ABC molecules in the lung in view of their expression in different cell types. Furthermore, their roles in
protection against noxious compounds will be discussed
as well as the (mal)function in normal and pathological
lung. We especially focused on the members of the ABCC
subfamily of transporters (to which the MRPs and CFTR
belong), the ABCB subfamily (a.o. MDR1/Pgp and
MDR3/Pgp) and the ABCA subfamily (a.o. ABCA1 and
ABCA3), because these are a selection of the best characterised human transporters and because they have been
investigated in human lungs. Results of in vitro studies in
pulmonary research are being reviewed and an update
will be given about what is known about pulmonary functional changes in ABC transporter knock-out mice models. In addition, the (potential) effects of polymorphisms
in ABC transporters on lung functioning are discussed.
MDR1/P-gp
MDR1 localisation and function
The MDR1 (ABCB1) gene is located on chromosome
7q21.12 and encodes for P-gp. P-gp plays a role in cell
defence against environmental attacks such as generated
by xenobiotics. It transports many hydrophobic substrates
and anti-cancer drugs including etoposide, doxorubicin
and vinblastine (for review, see [11]) and is mainly apically expressed in organs involved in excretion such as
liver and intestine. In the lung, P-gp is expressed at the apical side of ciliated epithelial cells or ciliated collecting
ducts, and on apical and lateral surfaces of serous cells of
bronchial glands but not in mucus-secreting goblet cells
(Figure 1 and 2) (Table 1) [12]. Epithelial cells of the trachea and major bronchi stain strongly while staining of
the smaller bronchi is patchy or absent. In addition, P-gp
is present in the lateral membranes of normal nasal respiratory mucosa [13]. In human and rat type I alveolar epithelium, P-gp is located at the lumenal side whereas
freshly isolated type II cells lack P-gp [14]. In another
study, pneumocytes did not stain for P-gp [15]. Some
antibodies visualised P-gp in endothelial cells of blood
vessels (Figure 1) [12,15,16]. In addition, alveolar and
peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages stained
positive but variably for P-gp [4,16,17]. The observed apical epithelial expression may signify that P-gp plays a role
in transport of compounds from the interstitium into the
lumen. However, the precise function of P-gp in the lung
is as yet unknown. Interestingly, P-gp was found to play a
role in the regulation of cell volume activated chloride
channels and to possess channel activities [18,19]. However, Cl- and K+ conductances were not affected by the
level of P-gp expression and the physiological role of P-gp
in volume-activated chloride currents is still unclear [2022]. Many lipophilic amines, such as fentanyl, highly
accumulate in the lung. It was suggested that P-gp plays a
role in the disposition of these pulmonary amine drugs

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:59

[23]. Cellular uptake in lung microvascular endothelial
cells of fentanyl was inhibited by the P-gp substrate verapamil, but not by the P-gp blocking antibody UIC2. The
authors suggested that this results from an inhibition of
fentanyl uptake. This is however unlikely, since P-gp is primarily responsible for removal of drugs out of cells.
P-gp mRNA expression was not increased in smokers (n =
11) compared to ex-and non-smokers (n = 7) [12].
Whether P-gp expression levels may play a defensive role
towards tobacco-derived agents remains to be
investigated.
MDR1 in tumours
High P-gp expression can imply chemotherapeutic resistance due to increased chemotherapeutic drug efflux. In
cancer therapy, many attempts have been made to reverse
MDR mechanisms. However, in a randomised doubleblind trial in 130 SCLC patients no positive effects were
seen with the P-gp modulator megestrol acetate in addition to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that levels of
P-gp expression in lung tumours were not relevant or that
modulation of P-gp activity was not complete in this treatment [24]. Some studies show higher P-gp expression at
the invasion front of lung tumours and it was suggested
that P-gp expression augments invasion properties of
tumour cells [25]. Only two out of 22 NSCLC samples
(both adenocarcinomas) stained positive with three P-gp
antibodies [15] and no P-gp was detected on pulmonary
carcinoids. Other studies revealed a relation between P-gp
and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) expression in
NSCLC that were exposed in vitro to doxorubicin [26],
suggesting that these two factors play a role in doxorubicin resistance. There was also a correlation between current smoking and doxorubicin resistance of NSCLC.
Forty-two out of 72 NSCLC smokers expressed P-gp,
whereas only two out of 22 tumours of non-smokers were
P-gp positive [27].
MDR1 polymorphisms
MDR1 polymorphisms were first described by Hoffmeyer
et al. [28] who found a correlation between lower intestinal expression of P-gp and a polymorphism in exon 26.
Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
recognised in the MDR1 gene (see reference [29] for recent
review about clinical aspects). The impact of these polymorphisms on lung diseases is still speculative. It was proposed that polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene may have
clinical consequences in patients with cystic fibrosis, since
MDR1 plays a role in CFTR regulation. Rodents contain
two Mdr1 genes, denoted as Mdr1a and Mdr1b. It was
shown that Mdr1b mRNA expression in lung parenchyma
of outbred rats is very variable and this may also be the
case in humans [30]. The possible effects of MDR1 polymorphisms was studied in tobacco-related lung cancer

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/59

[31]. No clear association was found between the T/T genotype of the C3435T polymorphism and susceptibility to
lung cancer in a group of 268 Caucasian men who were
current smokers. No relation was found between SNP
C3435T in MDR1 and survival in 62 docetaxel-cisplatintreated NSCLC patients [32]. Immunosuppressive agents
such as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus (both calcineurin
antagonists) are P-gp substrates. No relation was found of
MDR1 G2677T and C3435T genotypes with tacrolimus
blood levels in 83 lung transplant patients treated with
tacrolimus [33]. Altogether, these data implicate that
there is still no clear association between MDR1 polymorphisms and effects on outcome of treatment of lung cancer or lung transplant patients.
MDR1 in animal models
Scheffer et al. detected high P-gp levels in lungs of mice [4].
In rats, Mdr1a and Mdr1b mRNA expression were highest
in the ileum [34]. The Mdr1a expression level in rat lung
was 2% of the expression in ileum and expression of
Mdr1b was 47% of that in ileum. In mice orally treated
with dexamethasone for 24 hours, Mdr1b mRNA expression in lungs was decreased, from which the authors
deduce that dexamethasone treatment of lung tumours
may reverse MDR [35]. To study the in vivo distribution of
P-gp, nude rats were injected with a P-gp overexpressing
SCLC cell line (GLC4/Pgp) and with a P-gp negative cell
line (GLC4) [36]. P-gp function was visualised with radiolabeled P-gp substrate [11C]verapamil by positron emission tomography (PET) with or without P-gp modulator
cyclosporin A. The accumulation of [11C]verapamil was
significantly increased by cyclosporin A in brains and
GLC4/Pgp tumours in these rats. In all other investigated
organs including lungs, the accumulation after cyclosporin
A treatment was unaltered. In intact rabbit lung, vascular
P-gp kinetics were measured in vivo using the lipophilic
amine dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) by measuring R6G in the
perfusate during circulation [37]. Inhibition of P-gp function with verapamil or GF120918 resulted in higher accumulation of R6G in lung. It was proposed that the opposite
would happen when epithelial P-gp was inhibited because
R6G would then be retained in the airspace. We propose
another possibility that inhibition of epithelial P-gp will
also result in higher R6G accumulation. In that case, R6G
transport to the lumen is inhibited and as a compensation
mechanism it may be transported back to the interstitial
side where it either may be retained in the tissue or subsequently be transported into the circulation. This model
could be useful in testing a large variety of pulmonary therapeutic agents, such as corticosteroids and sympathicomimetics that may be substrates for transporters in the lung
or modulate their activity. Similar studies were also carried
out in perfused rat liver to assess the effect of P-gp modulators on the hepatobiliary system, supporting the usefulness of this approach [38].

Mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice lack both genes encoding for P-gp
and these mice seem physiologically normal. The penetration of [3H]digoxin (a P-gp substrate) was higher in brain,
ovary and adrenal gland. In the lung tissue of these (-/-)
mice [39], the level of [3H]digoxin was rather low compared to other organs. The level was 2.6 times higher in (/-) mice than in (+/+) mice, but this was not significant.
The pharmacokinetics of the central nervous system
(CNS) drug amitryptiline (a P-gp substrate) and its metabolites were examined in Mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in several
organs. Higher concentrations of these metabolites were
measured in the brain of these mice, but not in other
examined organs including the lung [40]. Thus, P-gp
likely plays a more active role in exporting CNS drugs out
of the brain than out of the lung. Another possibility is

MDR1 in vitro
Several lung cell culture models have been described for
determining P-gp expression and functionality. The
immortalised human bronchial epithelial cell line
16HBE14o- resembles primary epithelium and was
reported to be suitable for drug metabolism studies [41].
In 16HBE14o- cells, P-gp was expressed at the apical side.
Its functional activity was measured with P-gp substrate
rhodamine 123 and its transport was inhibited by verapamil [42]. Two lung cell lines, Calu-3 and A549 cells,
were compared for P-gp expression and functionality [43].
The bronchiolar adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3 is suitable for drug transport studies because these cells form
tight junctions in culture, which is not the case for the type
II alveolar carcinoma cell line A549. P-gp expression was
higher in A549 cells than in Calu-3 cells. However, efflux
of rhodamine 123 was higher in Calu-3 cells. This may be
explained by additional MRP1 activity in these cells
because rhodamine 123 is also an MRP1 substrate [44]. In
primary rat alveolar type II cells, Mdr1b mRNA levels
increased in a time dependent manner in cultures at day
1, 2 and 3 compared to freshly isolated cells. Mdr1b
mRNA was present at low levels and increased after oxygen radical induction with paraquat [45]. P-gp expression
was below the detection limit in these cells at time of isolation. In freshly isolated primary human bronchial epithelial cells, P-gp was present and increased after 24 hours
paraquat exposure. Rhodamine 123 efflux could be measured in these cells, confirming functional activity of P-gp
[45]. These results demonstrate that P-gp is upregulated
during stress, both from radical production and from ex
vivo culturing or differentiation.
MDR3/P-gp
The MDR3/P-gp (ABCB4) gene maps closely to MDR1/Pgp on chromosome 7q21.12 and has high homology with
MDR1 although its function is very different. It is involved
in phosphatidyl choline transport from the liver into the
bile. Its RNA and protein have not been detected in
human and mouse lung and trachea [4,6]. and it is therefore not expected that MDR3 is present in the lungs.
MRP1
MRP1 localisation and function
The MRP1 (ABCC1) gene is located on chromosome
16p13.12. Cole et al. discovered in 1992 a non-Pgp mediated MDR mechanism in the human lung cancer cell line
H69AR [46]. MRP1 was overexpressed in these cells and it
was found that glutathione-, glucuronide-, and sulfateconjugated organic anions are substrates for MRP1
[47,48]. MRP1 confers resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, daunorubicin and

methotrexate [49-51]. Physiological substrates for MRP1
are e.g. leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and glutathione disulfide
(GSSG) [52]. Interestingly, these substrates play an important role in lung physiology with respect to inflammation
and oxidative stress. MRP1 is highly expressed mainly at
the basolateral side of human bronchial epithelial cells
(Figure 1 and 2) [53]. Ciliated and basal cells have been
collected from brushes of main or lobar bronchi. Basal
cells stained strongly on the entire circumference of the
plasma membrane. Ciliated epithelial cells and mucous
cells stained positive at the basolateral membrane but not
at the apical membrane. No intracytoplasmic staining was
observed. However, strong apical cytoplasmic staining has
been detected below the cilia in respiratory columnar epithelial cells in paraffin sections with antibody MRPr1
[4,13,54]. The discrepancy between these findings may be
due to different fixation procedures. Basal cells of seromucinous glands of the lungs also stain positive for MRP1
with a higher intensity in the serous area than mucinous
cells. Alveolar macrophages are MRP1 positive with varia-

ble staining between individual lung samples (Figure 2)
[4]. Kool et al. investigated MRP1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with an
RNase protection assay in total lung RNA and found high
MRP1, absence of MRP2, low MRP3 and MRP4 and moderate MRP5 gene transcripts [55]. Total RNA was obtained
from lung tissue collected during surgery or autopsy.
Therefore, the original cell types can not be distinguished
in these samples.
Possibly, the high MRP1 expression at the basolateral side
of lung epithelium may assist in the clearance of toxins
coming from the luminal or interstitial side (back) into
the interstitial fluid [56]. Function of MRP1 expression in
the lung epithelium, glands and alveolar macrophages
may include extrusion of toxic intracellular substances,
antioxidant defence or production of LTC4 as an
inflammatory response. Given the fact that MRP1 expression is higher in the lung compared to other solid organs,
decreased or increased functional MRP1 expression may
have a high impact on development and/or progression of

lung diseases and protection against air pollution and
inhaled toxic substances such as present in cigarette
smoke [10].
MRP1 in tumours
Using mRNA in situ hybridisation Thomas et al. [57]
detected high MRP1 expression in normal epithelium
whereas the major component of the tumour epithelium
showed a negative hybridisation signal. However, MRP1
transcript expression at the invasive front of the lung
tumours was consistently stronger and particularly strong
in areas with lymphatic or blood vessels. In addition,
endothelial cells and lymphocytic infiltrates stained
strongly positive for MRP1. These results may indicate a
role of MRP1 in invasion or in mitotic activity. In a recent
study, all 102 NSCLC tumours were MRP1 positive. In
addition, the level of expression was 3-fold higher in
DNA-aneuploid cells compared to normal bronchial and
carcinomatous DNA-diploid cells [58]. This was associated with more frequent gain of chromosome 16 where
the MRP1 gene is located. Overexpression of MRP1 may
therefore be an important factor of intrinsic resistance to
chemotherapy in NSCLC. High MRP1 expression can also
result in increased apoptosis as shown by experiments
with verapamil in MRP1 transfected baby hamster kidney21 (BHK-21) cells [59]. Verapamil acts as an apoptogen in
these cells when compared to MRP1 negative cells or
mutant MRP1 transfected control cells. This was accompanied by depletion of intracellular GSH due to transport of
GSH by MRP1. Indeed, addition of extracellular GSH prevented cell death. This mechanism may be valuable for
treatment of MRP1-positive tumours.
MRP1 in non-malignant diseases
Cigarette smoking is the principle risk factor for the development of COPD. Our preliminary results indicate that
MRP1 expression is diminished in bronchial epithelium
of COPD patients (ex-smokers) and that lower expression
is related to worse lung function [10]. In addition, bronchial MRP1 expression was higher during smoking than
after one year of smoking cessation (Van der Deen et al.,
submitted). The expression of MRP1 measured with RTPCR was similar in lungs of smokers and a combined
group of ex- and non-smokers, suggesting that current
smoking does not affect MRP1 gene expression [53]. This
was semi-quantitatively analysed and the power of this
study was rather low (smokers n = 13 and ex- or nonsmokers n = 8). Cigarette smoke extract is a complex mixture of many substances. One of these is nitrosamine 4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a
carcinogenic nitrosamine. NNK is converted intracellularly in NNAL-O-glucuronide which is transported by
MRP1 in the presence of glutathione (GSH) [60]. Thus,
functional activity of MRP1 in the lung may play an

important role in the antioxidant defence against toxic
compounds generated by cigarette smoke.
MRP1 polymorphisms
Polymorphisms of the MRP1 gene or in regulatory genes
may influence function of MRP1 in the lung. MRP1 has
been screened for genetic variations and several mutations
have been found in the MRP1 gene in the human population [61,62]. Ethnic differences for MRP1 expression were
observed between Caucasian and Japanese subjects but
the clinical consequences have to be determined to date
[63,64]. In preclinical models, a single mutation in the
MRP1 gene can result in loss of transport of some, but not
all, MRP1 substrates [65] which implies that potentially
minor differences in the MRP1 gene may result in aberrant
functional capacities of the MRP1 protein. A low frequency (<1%) naturally occurring mutation in MRP1 was
related to functional differences in organic anion transport and drug resistance [66]. Therefore, some individuals
could be more susceptible to a set of xenobiotics than
others.
MRP1 in animal models
Scheffer et al. detected, besides P-gp, high levels of Mrp1
in lungs of mice [4]. Mrp1 (-/-) mice develop normally
[67]. Viability, fertility, and a range of histological, hematological, and serum-chemical parameters were similar in
Mrp (+/+) and Mrp (-/-) mice. However, Mrp1 (-/-) mice
are hypersensitive to exposure to several drugs e.g. etoposide, resulting in loss of body weight and death
[56,67,68]. In Mrp1 deficient mice there were no gross
abnormalities in lungs and other tissues after treatment
with the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide-phosphate,
but abnormal mucous production was seen around the
mouth. Further examination of tissues showed that these
mice suffered from oropharyngeal toxicity [56]. In Mrp1 (/-) mice, GSH levels were elevated in e.g. lung, kidney,
heart, testes and skeletal muscle. In organs that express little MRP1, such as the liver and small intestine, GSH levels
were unchanged [67,69]. The increase in GSH was not
related to increased levels of gamma-glutamylcysteine
synthetase (γ-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme for production of the tripeptide GSH. This suggests that MRP1 plays
a role in GSH metabolism because MRP1 expression
determines cellular GSH levels which is γ-GCS independent. In liver tissue, Mrp2 and Mrp5 mRNA levels were
increased in Mrp1(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice,
probably due to a compensation mechanism. Mdr1a and
Mrp3 levels were unchanged in these animals. Unfortunately, lung tissue was not examined [69]. Mrp1 (-/-) mice
showed impaired inflammatory responses accompanied
by a decreased LTC4 excretion by leukotriene producing
cells [67,68]. The outgrowth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
was enhanced in Mrp1 (-/-) mice, but there was no difference in survival compared to wild-type mice [70]. Strik-

ingly, Schultz et al. [71] observed that the survival of Mrp1
(-/-) mice inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae was
better than of wild-type mice. This was accompanied by a
lower LTC4 concentration but a higher LTB4 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Treatment with an LTB4
antagonist abolished the positive effect on survival rate.
Altering MRP1 function may therefore be a target for further studies on treatment of pneumonia. Interestingly,
LTB4 levels are also elevated in sputum and exhaled breath
condensate of COPD patients [72,73]. This is thought to
result from a higher amount of neutrophils present, yet
also lower functional MRP1 expression may play a role,
according to the observations in Mrp1 (-/-) mice [10,71].
The pulmonary and hepatic carcinogen aflatoxin B1 (a
mycotoxin) and its GSH conjugate are MRP1 substrates in
vitro [74]. MRP1 may therefore play an important role in
detoxification of aflatoxin B1 in the lung. No difference in
occurrence of lung tumours (and liver tumours) 12
months after an 8 week exposure to aflatoxin B1 was
observed in Mrp1 (-/-) and wild-type mice [75]. This
observation may be explained by differences in exposure
time compared to humans (who may be chronically
exposed for many years) or by redundancy of other ABC
transporters in knock-out mice to export aflatoxin B1 and
its conjugates.
NRF2 (nuclear factor-E2 p45-related factor), a transcription factor for many genes that play a role in antioxidant
defence and detoxification processes, was recently identified as a transcription factor for MRP1 [76]. Interestingly,
the onset of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema was earlier and the extent of emphysema was more severe in Nrf2
(-/-) mice as compared to wild-type mice [77]. The
number of inflammatory cells, mainly consisting of macrophages, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue
was higher in Nrf2 (-/-) mice, accompanied by more
extensive apoptosis of endothelial cells and alveolar type
II cells. Forty-five Nrf2-dependent protective genes were
induced by smoke exposure in wild-type mice compared
to knock-out mice as measured with microarray analysis.
Regretfully, Mrp1 was not present on this gene expression
array. Similar smoke exposure experiments with Mrp1 (-/) mice would be interesting to investigate if these mice are
also more susceptible to develop emphysema. Three polymorphisms were identified in the promotor region of
NRF2 in healthy individuals (n = 81) and in patients with
COPD (n = 87) and sytemic lupus erythematosis(n = 51)
(all Japanese individuals) [78]. There was no relation
between these polymorphisms and risk of these diseases,
but the power of this study was rather low.
Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Mrp1(-/-) triple knockout (TKO) mice are
indistinguishable from wild-type mice under normal
physiological conditions [79,80]. Intravenous injection of
[3H]etoposide in TKO mice resulted after 4 hours in a

Page 7 of 16

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:59

higher accumulation in brown adipose tissue, colon, urogenital tract, salivery gland and heart when compared to
Mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice. The accumulation of [3H]etoposide
in lung did not increase [79]. Accumulation of [3H]vincristine was 26-fold higher in lungs of weaning TKO mice
compared to adult TKO mice, 4 hours after a single dose
intraperitoneal injection [81]. In TKO compared to wildtype mice, [3H]vincristine was 82.7 and 5.8-fold increased
in respectively weaning and adult mice after 4 hours in
this experimental setting. Eight hours post-injection, these
ratios were 33 and 51.1. Thus, accumulation of vincristine
is both time and age-related. In another study, toxicity of
the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and etoposide was
elevated in TKO mice (respectively 128-fold and 3–5 fold)
compared to wild-type mice. Lung tissue was not further
examined [80].
MRP1 in vitro
MRP1 overexpression was first described in the human
lung cancer cell line H69AR [46]. The human SCLC cell
line GLC4/ADR, which displays multiple copies of the
MRP1 gene, is often used to study MRP1 function [47].
The lung cell line Calu-3 (from bronchiolar adenocarcinoma/glandular origin) has been reported to express
MRP1 basolaterally and has functional MRP1 activity. It
may serve as a good model for in vitro analysis of transport
activities [44]. Besides P-gp, MRP1 protein was present in
freshly obtained primary human bronchial epithelial
cells. Efflux of MRP1 substrate carboxy-dichlorofluorescein could be measured in these cells and was inhibited by
MRP modulator MK571 [45]. In contrast to upregulation
of P-gp, epithelial cells did not respond with MRP1 upregulation to paraquat and MRP1 levels were stable in time
until 12 weeks, but highly increased after 18 weeks culturing. An interesting observation was made by Bandi et al.
[82] who incubated the airway epithelial cell line Calu-1
with budesonide, an anti-asthma drug. MRP1 expression
decreased after 7 and 14 days incubation with budesonide
(10 µM) but not at day 1 and 4. MRP1 function was also
diminished after 14 days incubation with increasing
amounts of budesonide (1, 10 and 100 µM). It was therefore proposed that budesonide could be used as a chemosensitiser in lung tumours. The immortalised bronchial
epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- expresses high MRP1 protein levels and activity [83]. MRP1 activity, but not P-gp,
was blocked by incubation with cigarette smoke extract.
Thus, the expression of MRP1 in human lungs may contribute to defence mechanisms of toxic inhaled substances
present in cigarette smoke to protect against pulmonary
diseases such as lung cancer or COPD. It was shown that
benzo [a]pyrene (B [a]P), a polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon that is a.o. present in cigarette smoke and car
exhaust fuels, increased the efflux of monochlorobimane
GSH conjugate (mBCl-SG, which is an MRP substrate) out
of primary rabbit alveolar type II cells [84]. This was

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/59

explained by an increase in GSH levels. MK571 reduced
the efflux of mBCL-SG, suggesting that the transport was
MRP-mediated. Surprisingly, the transport direction of
this substrate was higher to the apical than to the basolateral compartment. This may imply that MRP1 (or other
MRPs) is apically located in alveolar type II cells in contrast to the basolateral location that is usually reported for
MRP1, or that another transporter is responsible for this
unexpected result. MRP1-5 expression was studied in primary human lung cell cultures and in A549 cells [85].
MRP1 and MRP3 expression were membrane-associated
whereas MRP2, 4, and 5 were located in intracellular
structures in primary cells (both bronchial and peripheral
epithelial cells). In A549 cells, all transporters were
expressed in the cellular membrane. The fluorescent
microscopic pictures, however, did not precisely show the
exact cellular localisation and in several cases, the Golgi
apparatus also seems to stain beside the cellular
membrane.
MRP2
MRP2 localisation and function
MRP2 (ABCC2) is located on chromosome 10q24.2 and
is also named the canalicular multispecific organic anion
transporter (cMOAT) in the liver [86]. MRP2 and MRP1
share very similar substrate specificities. High affinity
endogenous substrates for MRP2 include amphiphilic
anions, such as LTC4 [87,88]. and bilirubin glucuronosides [89,90]. Data on the presence of MRP2 protein in
the lung are conflicting. Only one out of three antibodies
stained positive at the apical side in bronchial epithelium
(Figure 1) [4,90]. If MRP2 is expressed apically, it could be
involved in transport of noxious compounds into the
lumen of the lung.
MRP2 in animal models
There are several rat strains that have a mutation in Mrp2/
cMOAT and the phenotypes resemble that of the human
Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a disease in which MRP2 is
mutated. Examples are the GY/TR- rat [91] and the Eisai
hyperbilirubinemic rat (EHBR) [92]. Subjects with the
Dubin-Johnson syndrome and also Mrp2 deficient rats
display jaundice and have impaired organic anion transport. Recently, it was shown that deficient Mrp2 function
in EHBR rats was compensated by upregulation of Mrp3
in liver and kidney [93]. Mrp2 (-/-) mice have not been
described. There are no reports in the literature of pulmonary malfunction in rats or humans with defects in the
MRP2 gene.
MRP3
The MRP3 (ABCC3) gene is the closest MRP1 homologue
[94] and is located on chromosome 17q21.33. It is
involved in resistance against the anti-cancer drugs etoposide, teniposide and at higher concentrations also to

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:59

methotrexate [95]. MRP3 is located in basolateral plasma
membranes of liver, adrenals, pancreas, kidney, gut and
gallbladder. The physiological function of MRP3 is still
unknown but its cellular localisation and the information
on substrates implies a role for MRP3 in transport of
organic anions from the liver into the blood, especially
when secretion into bile is being blocked [96]. MRP3 protein and RNA was not detected in bronchial epithelium
[4,96]. However, data in literature are conflicting and preliminary unpublished results indicate that Mrp3 is present
in mouse lung. As already mentioned in the discussion on
MRP1, primary epithelial cells (of bronchial and peripheral origin) and A549 cells stain positive for MRP3 (Figure
1) [85]. MRP3 mRNA was measured by quantitative RTPCR in normal lung and lung tumours. MRP3 transcript
levels were related to exposure to vincristine, etoposide
and platinum drugs in lung tumours [97,98].
MRP4 and MRP5
MRP4 (ABCC4) and MRP5 (ABCC5) genes map to
13q32.1 and 3q27.1 respectively. MRP4 protein is highly
expressed in the kidney and prostate and MRP4 mRNA is
present in the lung [55,99]. MRP5 mRNA is ubiquitously
expressed, mainly in brain and skeletal muscle and also in
the lung [6,55]. Primary epithelial cells (of bronchial and
peripheral origin) and A549 cells stain positive for MRP4
and 5 (Figure 1) [85]. The substrate specificities of these
two transporters differ from the other transporters of the
ABCC family, i.e. they transport a variety of nucleoside
analogues. The physiological role of both proteins is still
unknown but they can serve as an efflux pump of the nucleosides cAMP and cGMP at low affinity, likely in a GSH
independent manner [100-103]. Interestingly, AMP levels
in lungs of asthma and COPD patients are elevated and
therefore, MRP4 and MRP5 activity may be of clinical relevance in these diseases [104]. MRP4 can actively efflux
prostaglandins E1 and E2 [105]. It was also suggested that
MRP4 plays a role in the transport of conjugated steroids
and bile acids [106], whereas MRP5 was reported to transport hyaluran out of cells [107]. In a recent study, a panel
of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) were screened
with real-time RT-PCR for 48 human ABC transporters.
Among these were several lung cancer cell lines. An association was found between MRP4 and MRP5 gene expression and resistance against platinum drugs in lung cancer
[108-110].
MRP6
MRP6 (ABCC6) maps to chromosome 16p13.12 and is
mainly expressed in liver and kidney. MRP6 was neither
detected in the lung nor in lung derived tumour cell lines
SW1573 and GLC4 by immunohistochemistry [111].
However, MRP6 mRNA was moderately present in human
lung extracts [6]. MRP6 is mutated in the hereditary connective tissue disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum which

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/59

affects skin, retina and blood vessels (for review, see
[112]). Still, its physiological role in this disease and its
substrate specificity is unclear. Pulmonary abnormalities
are rare in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. However, in some
patients calcification and elastic tissue damage in the lung
have been described [113]. This may be due to an altered
MRP6 function. Further studies are required to assess
whether dysfunction of MRP6 also plays a role in development of other lung diseases such as emphysema. With in
situ hybridisation and RNase protection assay in C57BL/6
mice, Mrp6 mRNA could be detected in tracheal and
bronchial epithelium [114].
MRP7, MRP8 and MRP9
To date, the functions of MRP7 (ABCC10, gene 6p21.1),
MRP8 (ABCC11, gene 16q12.1) and MRP9 (ABCC12,
gene 16q12.1) are largely unknown. Of these recently discovered ABC transporters, only MRP7 mRNA is highly
expressed in total lung and trachea RNA extracts [6].
MRP7 function resembles P-gp function in the resistance
against taxanes [115]. MRP8 resembles MRP4 function
more than MRP5, and the physiological role of MRP8 may
involve transport of conjugated steroids, cyclic nucleotides and bile acids [116].
CFTR
CFTR localisation and function
CFTR (ABCC7) is located on chromosome 7q31.31. CFTR
is the only member of the ABC superfamily which is not
an active transporter. It functions as a chloride channel
and in normal human airway tissue CFTR is highly
expressed at the luminal side in serous cells of the submucosal glands. In addition, it is restricted to the apical membrane domain of well-differentiated epithelial cells such
as ciliated cells, and probably also non-ciliated Clara cells
and alveolar type I cells (Figure 1) [117-120]. CFTR is also
expressed in normal nasal respiratory mucosa [13].
CFTR in cystic fibrosis
Mutations in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis [7]
and are associated with abnormal Cl- and Na+ ion transport in several tissues including the lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, liver, sweat glands and male
reproductive organs. Although the normal expression of
CFTR in the lung is lower compared to tissues such as the
intestine and pancreas, its function in the lung is of major
importance. The most frequent mutation in this gene is
the delta F508 mutation which leads to cystic fibrosis.
Defective CFTR function can cause viscous secretions in
the lungs which leads to chronic inflammation with acute
exacerbations by impaired mucociliary clearance. There
are major risks for colonisation with Pseudonomas aeruginosa which leads to pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency [121]. Besides abnormal CFTR localisation and
expression in cystic fibrosis, also in non-cystic fibrosis air-

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:59

way tissue CFTR can be abnormally expressed in remodelled or dedifferentiated epithelium [122,123]. whereas in
delta F508 CFTR epithelial cells there may be a normally
processed CFTR [120,124]. The regulation and transport
function of CFTR are dependent of the state of differentiation and polarisation of epithelial cell cultures
[125,126]. Dedifferentiation with hyperplasia or metaplasia was associated with an intracellular localisation or
absence of CFTR protein [122]. Hurbain et al. [127] analysed MRP1-5 transcript levels in nasal respiratory cells
from cystic fibrosis patients with homozygous delta F508
mutation. Surprisingly, low MRP1 levels were associated
with more severe disease and in addition, MRP1 levels
were related to cAMP-independent chloride transport suggesting that MRP1 regulates another chloride channel in
the apical membrane. CFTR function is cAMP regulated
[121], and therefore, MRP4 or MRP5 activity may play a
role in regulation of CFTR, since these proteins transport
cAMP. Another study showed that CFTR function is
blocked by two MRP substrates (taurolithocholate-3-sulphate and beta-estradiol) [128]. This implies that these
two substances are also substrates for CFTR, or that CFTR
and MRP proteins possess similar anion binding sites.
Bebok et al. showed that nitric oxide (NO) and reactive
oxygen nitrogen species (RONS) decrease wild-type CFTR
protein levels in airway epithelial cell monolayers [129].
Natural sources of NO and RONS are activated in alveolar
and interstitial macrophages [130,131], neutrophils
[132], alveolar type II cells [133,134]. and airway epithelial cells [135]. In this view, CFTR function may be important in pulmonary infections and in the effect of oxidative
stress generated by e.g. cigarette smoke.
CFTR in animal models
Cftr knock-out mice show reduced viability in contrast to
most other ABC transporter knock-outs which are viable
and fertile. Trezise et al. developed Cftr knock-out mice
that have a severe cystic fibrosis phenotype accompanied
by a lack of Cftr-related chloride conductance in e.g. tracheal epithelium [136,137]. They found that the P-gp
mRNA level was four-fold increased in intestines of neonatal and 3- to 4-week-old Cftr knock-out mice compared
to littermates of the same age. However, in 10 weeks-old
mice P-gp levels were three-fold decreased. Apparently, a
reduction or loss of Cftr function influences P-gp
expression.
CFTR in vitro
The Calu-3 cell line, which has properties from serous
cells of the pulmonary submucosal glands, is often used
to study function and expression of CFTR [129,138]. It
was demonstrated in Calu-3 cells that CFTR mRNA
expression is downregulated after ouabain incubation
whereas P-gp expression was upregulated [139]. The bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- is also invaluable in

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/59

CFTR research [129,140]. In wild-type and mutant CFTR
expressing Sf9 insect cells, it was demonstrated that
besides chloride transport, another function of CFTR is
transport of GSH in a nucleotide-dependent manner
[141]. This observation suggests that CFTR plays a role in
the control of oxidative stress. Indeed, several studies in
patients, mice and cell lines have shown that GSH levels
are lower in case of defective CFTR function.
BCRP
BCRP localisation and function
BCRP (ABCG2) is the breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP), located on chromosome 4q22. BCRP is a halftransporter that probably acts as a homo- or heterodimer
[142] and is involved in resistance against toxins and several chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. mitoxantrone and
topoisomerase 1 inhibitors) [143,144]. Protein levels of
BCRP in the lung are lower than P-gp and MRP1 but distinct in the epithelial cell layer and in seromucinous
glands (Figure 1) [4]. BCRP was absent in alveolar macrophages, suggesting that BCRP does not play a major role
in innate inflammatory responses in the lung. Small
endothelial capillaries also stain positive for BCRP, thus
BCRP may protect the lungs against noxious compounds
that enter systemically.
BCRP in tumours
In a study of untreated solid lung tumours, i.e. squamous
cell carcinoma (n = 5), adenocarcinoma (n = 2) and SCLC
(n = 3), most cases expressed moderate or strong BCRP
[145]. In addition, higher BCRP expression in blood vessels was observed than in vessels of the surrounding
tumour, indicating that BCRP may play a role in tumour
angiogenesis. In 72 cases of advanced NSCLC, BCRP
expression, but not P-gp, MRP1, MRP2 and MRP3, predicted poor clinical outcome [146].
BCRP in animal models
Bcrp knock-out mice do not display any abnormalities
compared to wild-type mice under normal conditions,
except for the colour of their bile which is red instead of
yellow on certain diets [147]. However, these mice appear
to be extremely sensitive to the phototoxin pheophorbide
A, showing that BCRP is important to protect against toxic
food components. Abnormalities of lungs in Bcrp (-/-)
mice have not been reported thus far. Recently, Bcrp1
(Bcrp in the mouse is also called Bcrp1) localisation in the
lung of 4- to 8-week old C57Bl/6J mice was studied to
identify lung stem cells. These cells possess high activity of
efflux of Hoechst dye that is transported by Bcrp1 [148].
In peripheral blood and bone marrow, cells with side
population activity represent BCRP positive (haematopoietic) stem cells and this might also be the case for side
population cells in the lungs. Indeed, Bcrp1 (-/-) mice did
not display side population cells as shown by Hoechst

Page 10 of 16

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:59

staining of lung digests. In paraffin-embedded tissue sections, Bcrp1 was restricted to smooth muscle cells (of both
arteries and airways) and a subpopulation of unidentified
round cells in the alveolar space but not detectable in
endothelial or epithelial cells. BAL cells of mice were
Bcrp1 positive, but did not display side population (SP)
activity [148]. Clara cells, a nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cell type, were also phenotypically described to
possess stem cell characteristics [149]. Further investigation is required to identify the stem cell pool in the lung
in relation to expression of ABC transporters. Repairing
and replacing lost lung tissue is a research area of promising therapeutic possibilities [150].
ABCA1
The ABCA1 gene is mapped to chromosome 9q31.1. It is
the causative gene in the development of Tangier disease,
a disorder of cholesterol transport [8]. The ABCA1 protein
controls transport of cholesterol and phospholipids to
apolipoprotein 1 (apoA-1) in alveolar type II cells (Figure
1). Using the siRNA technique for ABCA1, it was shown
that ABCA1 is involved in basolateral transport of surfactant that is activated by oxysterol [151]. Abca1 knockout mice show increased concentrations of cholesterol
precursors in lung, plasma, intestine and faeces [152]. It
was demonstrated that there were major morphologic
abnormalities in lungs of these mice, increasing with age.
In 30% of 18 months old mice, lung parenchyma was
affected. Lesions were characterised by foamy type II
pneumocytes with aberrant lamellar bodies, intraalveolar
macrophages and cholesterol clefts [153]. In addition,
ABCA7, a close homologue of ABCA1 was also found to
be highly expressed in mouse lung tissue by Western blot
analysis [154].
ABCA3
The ABCA3 gene is located on chromosome 16p13.3. The
function of this ABC transporter has not been studied in
detail but ABCA3 protein is present in lamellar bodies in
human lung alveolar type II cells (Figure 1). Langmann et
al. performed quantitative RT-PCR in 20 human tissues
and found ABCA3 to be expressed restrictively in the lung
[6]. In a recent study in cell lines, an association was
found between lung cancer and ABCA3 (and also ABCA2)
gene expression by means of quantitative RT-PCR [108].

The high expression of ABCA3 in alveolar type II cells suggests that ABCA3 may play a role in surfactant regulation
[155]. Surfactant is important to lower the surface tension
in the air-liquid interphase in alveoli. Indeed, in patients
with surfactant deficiency and with severe neonatal lung
disease it was demonstrated that the ABCA3 gene was frequently mutated [9]. ABCA3 mutations were found in 16
out of 21 patients, but polymorphisms (SNPs) were not
found. One mutation was not fatal but was associated

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/59

with a chronic lung disorder in a 6-year old patient. Other
mutations turned out to be fatal and these patients died
shortly after birth. Electron micrographs of tissue of
patients with surfactant deficiency showed abnormal
dense and small lamellar bodies. It was suggested that
ABCA3 plays a role in phospholipid metabolism, since it
closely resembles ABCA1 and ABCA4 that are known to
transport phospholipids.

Conclusion
Little is known about the function of ABC transporters
that are expressed in the lung although their overall
expression is very high compared to many other organs
[6]. This review shows that ABC transporters in the lung
are not only relevant for relatively rare diseases such as
cystic fibrosis, Tangier disease and surfactant deficiency.
Preliminary data indicate that MRP1 expression is lower
in COPD patients than in healthy controls. Mutations and
polymorphisms in ABC transporters may have important
clinical consequences for development of lung diseases.
However, overlap in substrate specificities may be compensatory in cases of malfunction of one (or more) transporter(s). Given the complexity of lung architecture,
research on detailed cellular processes is difficult but challenging. Several ABC transporter deficient animal models
have been developed that are of great value to study the
role of these proteins. To date, exposure to cigarette smoke
has never been tested in ABC transporter deficient animal
models and would potentially give interesting information about the role of ABC transporters in protection
against inhaled toxic substances such as present in
tobacco smoke. Cell line models have been used to study
transport processes and pulmonary drug metabolism. The
delivery of pulmonary drugs to the site of action is probably highly dependent on the presence and activity of
many ABC transporters in several cell types in the lung.
The first barrier after inhalation is the pulmonary epithelium and transporters in the pulmonary endothelium
may be critical for the delivery of intravenously or orally
administered drugs. Insight in the function of ABC transporters in the lung may open new ways to facilitate treatment of lung diseases.
