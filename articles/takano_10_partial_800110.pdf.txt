Abstract
Background: During the last decade, Southeast Asian countries have been very successful in reducing the burden of
malaria. However, malaria remains endemic in these countries, especially in remote and forested areas. The
Leucosphyrus group of the genus Anopheles harbors the most important malaria vectors in forested areas of Southeast
Asia. In Vietnam, previous molecular studies have resulted in the identification of only Anopheles dirus sensu stricto
(previously known as An. dirus species A) among the Leucosphyrus group members. However, Vietnamese
entomologists have recognized that mosquitoes belonging to the Leucosphyrus group in northern Vietnam exhibit
morphological characteristics similar to those of Anopheles takasagoensis, which has been reported only from Taiwan.
Here, we aimed to confirm the genetic and morphological identities of the members of the Leucosphyrus group in
Vietnam.
Results: In the molecular phylogenetic trees reconstructed using partial COI and ND6 mitochondrial gene sequences,
samples collected from southern and central Vietnam clustered together with GenBank sequences of An. dirus that
were obtained from Thailand. However, samples from northern Vietnam formed a distinct clade separated from both
An. dirus and An. takasagoensis by other valid species.
Conclusions: The results suggest the existence of a cryptic species in northern Vietnam that is morphologically similar
to, but phylogenetically distant from both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis. We have tentatively designated this possible
cryptic species as Anopheles aff. takasagoensis for convenience, until a valid name is assigned. However, it is difficult to
distinguish the species solely on the basis of morphological characteristics. Further studies on such as karyotypes and
polytene chromosome banding patterns are necessary to confirm whether An. aff. takasagoensis is a valid species.
Moreover, studies on (1) the geographic distribution, which is potentially spreading along the Vietnam, China, Laos,
and Myanmar borders; (2) morphological and ecological characteristics; and (3) vectorial capacity of this newly
identified cryptic species of An. dirus, which is one of the most important malaria vectors in the mainland of Southeast
Asia, are necessary for planning efficient malaria vector control programs in this region.
Background
During the last decade, mainland Southeast Asian countries (i.e., Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet* Correspondence: koheit@nagasaki-u.ac.jp

malaria [1]. Their main strategies included prompt diagnosis and treatment and widespread coverage of vector
control through insecticide-treated nets and indoor
residual spraying [2]. Malaria, however, has not yet completely disappeared and remains endemic in these coun-

tries. In remote and forested areas, the transmission rates
are still high because of complex interactions between
vectors, humans, and environmental factors [3], [4].
Indoor residual spraying is ineffective against vectors that
rest outdoors after feeding and vectors encountered outdoors [5], and bed nets are not easily adaptable to the lifestyle of forest workers [4]. Environmental modifications
that affect the distribution and abundance of vectors lead
to changes in malaria transmission [6]. Under these conditions, accurate species identification is essential in vector control.
The Leucosphyrus group consists of 20 formally
described species and 2 informal forms, and its members
are distributed in the Oriental region [7-9]. The Dirus
complex of the Leucosphyrus group includes the most
important malaria vectors in forested areas in mainland
Southeast Asia [9], [10]. Anopheles dirus Peyton and Harrison, 1979 was first separated from Anopheles balabacensis Baisas, 1936 [11]. Shortly thereafter, Anopheles
takasagoensis Morishita, 1946 was elevated to species
status from a synonym of An. balabacensis on the basis of
cross-mating, cytogenetic, and morphological evidence
[12]. These findings implied that An. balabacensis, which
until that time was considered to be the primary vector of
human malaria in an area stretching from east India to
the Philippines, is not a single species but a complex of
three or more species [9]. Mainly on the basis of crossmating and cytogenetic experiments, subsequent intensive studies [8], [13-18] revealed that An. dirus also exists
as a species complex that includes at least seven species:
An. dirus sensu stricto (previously known as An. dirus
species A); Anopheles cracens Sallum and Peyton, 2005
(species B); Anopheles scanloni Sallum and Peyton, 2005
(species C); Anopheles baimaii Sallum and Peyton, 2005
(species D); Anopheles elegans (James), 1903 (species E);
Anopheles nemophilous Peyton and Ramalingam, 1988
(species F); and An. takasagoensis. At least two species in
the Dirus complex, namely, An. dirus and An. baimaii,
are recognized as major malaria vectors [9], [10]. Anopheles balabacensis is now classified into the Leucosphyrus
complex [19] with Anopheles leucosphyrus Dönitz, 1901,
Anopheles latens Sallum and Peyton, 2005, and Anopheles
introlatus Colless, 1957 [7-9] (see also Table 1).
Among the members of the Leucosphyrus group, only
An. dirus sensu strict has been found in Vietnam in previous molecular studies (reviewed in [20]). However, a
member of the Leucosphyrus group in northern Vietnam
had been identified as An. takasagoensis by some Vietnamese entomologists for the last 30 years [21-23]. Here,
we conducted a molecular study on members of the Leucosphyrus group in Vietnam to confirm their genetic
identity.
Manguin et al. [24] analyzed several specimens collected in 1970 from Ninh Bình Province, northern Viet-

nam, which exhibited adult and larval characteristics of
both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis. They succeeded in
sequencing mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit
I (COI) and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2
(ITS2) of one of the specimens and identified it as An.
dirus, whereas they have not yet deposited the sequence
into the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. They noted,
"This casts doubt on the reported occurrence of An.
takasagoensis...in northern Vietnam, but additional material needs to be collected and analysed before it will be
known for certain whether the distribution of this species
is limited to Taiwan." Here, we conducted a molecular
study on members of the Leucosphyrus group in Vietnam
to confirm their genetic identity.
Sallum et al. [25] conducted a molecular phylogenetic
study of the Leucosphyrus group. For comparison, we
chose the same molecular markers: the partial sequences
of COI (221 base pair (bp)) and NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 6 (ND6: 349 bp) among mitochondrial genes. The
advantage of using the same molecular markers is that
Sallum et al. [25] assessed 13 of 20 species of the Leucosphyrus group, including all the members of the Dirus
complex. The disadvantages are that these markers cannot distinguish between An. dirus and An. baimaii and
that the phylogenetic relationship within the group
remains ambiguous, presumably because of the short
length of the sequences analyzed (570 bp in total). However, to date, this is the only available molecular information covering the group but is still informative for
distinguishing species (except An. dirus and An. baimaii).

Methods
Mosquito collection and preliminary identification

In 2008, we conducted field sampling in Bắc Kạn Province for one week and collected 11 larvae (but no adults)
of the Leucosphyrus group, eight of which were analyzed
in this study (Tables 2 and 3). These larvae were collected
from partially or heavily shaded small pools near the
starting points (seepage) of small streams in hilly areas
covered with secondly evergreen forests. The water of the
larval habitats was clear and not running. Other larval
and female-adult samples were collected from various
parts of Vietnam (Table 1). Collected larvae were reared
to obtain adult specimens. Some samples were provided
by collaborative entomologists, and a Hai Nan Island
(China) strain of An. dirus maintained at the National
Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology
was also analyzed. The adult samples were tentatively
identified as An. takasagoensis if they had more than one
of the following three morphological characteristics (we
followed the terminology reported in [26], [27] as well as
in [9]): a presector dark spot on vein R not or barely
extending basally beyond the presector pale spot on the
costa (basal extension typically occurs in An. dirus), a

pale fringe spot between veins 1A and Cu2 present on at
least one wing (absent in An. dirus), and an accessory sector pale spot on the subcosta (absent in An. dirus) (Table
1 and Figure 1).
DNA extraction

The specimens had been stored dry at room temperature
or below -20°C for up to 7 years prior to DNA extraction.
Depending on the condition of each specimen, we used a
single leg or a combination of a single leg and some other
body parts (i.e., additional legs, a wing, or a head, but not
female abdomens, the spermathecae of which might
include sperm from mating). We extracted DNA using
the REDExtract-N-Amp™ Tissue PCR Kit (SigmaAldrich) with a modification of the manufacturer's protocol for animal tissues. Extraction Solution and Tissue
Preparation Solution were mixed in a 4:1 ratio. We added
20 μl of the mixture per leg and homogenized them in a
microtube using the tip of a pipette. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were incubated
at 95°C for 3 min. We added 16 μl of Neutralization Solution B per 20 μl of the homogenized sample and mixed
them by vortexing. The neutralized tissue extract was
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 min, and the supernatant
was added to a new microtube and stored at 4°C until
used for PCR reactions.
Markers and primers used in this study

We selected molecular markers and primers according to
Sallum et al [22]. Amplification with the primers UEA9.2
(5'-cta aca ttt ttt cct caa cat ttt tta gg-3') and UEA10.2 (5'tta tta gtt aat aay ggt art tct g-3') yielded a 221-bp product
(excluding the primers), partial sequence of the COI gene.
Amplification of the primers ND6.F2 (5'-ttg gwc gta awg
gwc cat aaa a-3') and ND6.R3 (5'-car gaa tyt atg taa aaa cat
ttt g-3') resulted in a product of 349 bp (excluding the
primers), part of the ND6 gene.
PCR, sequencing, and alignment

We modified the PCR protocol of Sallum et al. [25]. For
COI, each 20-μl PCR reaction contained 2 μl of 10×EX
Taq buffer (TaKaRa, Japan), 0.2 μM of dNTP, 0.5 μM of
UEA9.2 primer, 1.0 μM of UEA10.2 primer, 0.1 μl of EX
Taq® Hot Start Version (TaKaRa), and 1.0 to 2.0 μl of DNA

extract. The reaction mixture for ND6 was the same as
that for COI, except that 1.0 μM each of ND6F.2 and
ND6.R3 primer was added instead of UEA9.2 and
UEA10.2. ASTEC PC320 and PC816 thermal cyclers
were used. The thermal cycling profile for COI consisted
of 5 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 37°C, and 30 s at 72°C,
followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 47°C, and 30 s
at 72°C, with a final extension of 2 min at 72°C. The profile for ND6 consisted of 5 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
37°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 45 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30 s at 49°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final extension
of 2 min at 72°C. The PCR product was separated on a 2%
agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Fragment sizes and product density were estimated by
comparison with molecular weight standards. We purified the PCR products using ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare
Japan). We diluted ExoSAP-IT 10 times with Milli-Q
water, added 2 μl of the dilution to 5 μl of the PCR product, incubated the solution at 37°C for 30 min, and then
inactivated enzymes by incubating at 80°C for 15 min.
Sequence reactions were carried out on both strands of
DNA using the primers listed above and the ABI BigDye®
terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems). The reaction products were purified by ethanol
precipitation and resolved in Hi-Di™ Formamide following the manufacturer's protocol, and the sequences were
determined with an ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer.
Complimentary strands were combined into consensus
sequences, and questionable base calls were corrected
manually by comparison with the original waveform.
When the correction of the questionable base call was
difficult, the site was recorded as missing data. We concatenated the COI and ND6 sequences and identified 22
unique sequences, i.e., haplotypes (Tables 2 and 3).
Further, we obtained the GenBank sequences of members of the Leucosphyrus group (in-group, 37 samples)
and those of four other Anopheles species (out-group,
Table 1). Sallum et al. [25] deposited the COI sequences
that include the sequence of the UEA9.2 primer (29 bp) in
GenBank and reconstructed phylogenetic trees on the
basis of these sequences. We excluded the UEA9.2 primer
sequence from our analysis. There were no insertions or
deletions in these sequences; however, the sequences

BK101, BK284-2, BK301-103 (Table 2), balabacensis_3,
dirus_3, and baimaii_6 (Table 1) had 8-87 missing sites at
the 3'- or 5'-end of either the COI or ND6 sequences
(Additional files 1, 2 and 3). Finally, we obtained 52
unique sequences and assigned a haplotype to each of
them (Tables 1, 2 and 3 and Additional files 1, 2 and 3).
Molecular phylogeny

The neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony
(MP) methods were performed with the MEGA4 software [28]. All codon positions were included, and all
ambiguous sites were treated as missing data. The resultant trees were rooted using the out-group. In the NJ phylogenetic reconstruction, the evolutionary distances were
computed using the Jukes-Cantor method. All sites containing missing data were eliminated only in pairwise
sequence comparisons (pairwise deletion option). To
assess the reliability of the NJ tree, the bootstrap test and
the interior branch test were performed with 2,000 replicates. In the MP phylogenetic reconstruction, the most
parsimonious trees were obtained using the close-neighbor-interchange algorithm at search level 3, in which the
initial trees were obtained by random addition of
sequences (10,000 replicates). There were 570 sites in the
final dataset, of which 137 were parsimony informative.
The consensus tree was generated from the 3517 most
parsimonious trees. Branches corresponding to partitions
reproduced in less than 50% of trees were collapsed.
Branch lengths were calculated using the average pathway method and are expressed in units of the number of
changes over the whole sequence. The percentages of
parsimonious trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together are shown next to the branches.

Results
By the morphological examination, all the samples collected from Bắc Kạn Province in northern Vietnam and
four of five samples from Nghệ An Province in central
Vietnam were tentatively identified as An. takasagoensis
(Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1).
In the molecular phylogenetic reconstruction using the
NJ method (Figure 2), haplotypes 18-22 of the Bắc Kạn
samples formed a distinct clade with high bootstrap
(91%) and interior branch test (97%) support; this clade
was separated from haplotypes of both An. takasagoensis
and An. dirus. This clade then clustered with haplotypes
26-28 of An. balabacensis, but the bootstrap and interior
branch test support were lower, with values less than 50%.
Other haplotypes obtained in the present study (haplotypes 1-17), including those of the Nghệ An samples,
were clustered together with those of An. dirus from
Thailand and An. baimaii from Thailand, Myanmar, and
Bangladesh. The (An. dirus + An. baimaii) clade was subsequently clustered with An. elegans from India with

Page 10 of 16

moderate bootstrap support (75%) and high interior
branch test support (95%) (indicated with an arrow in
Figure 2). Subsequently, An. takasagoensis clustered with
the (An. dirus + An. baimaii + An. elegans) clade, An.
cracens clustered with the (An. dirus + An. baimaii + An.
elegans + An. takasagoensis) clade, and An. scanloni clustered with the (An. dirus + An. baimaii + An. elegans +
An. takasagoensis + An. cracens) clade with moderate to
low bootstrap and interior branch test support (Figure 2).
The Dirus complex members, An. balabacensis, and the
Bắc Kạn samples formed a clade with high bootstrap
(89%) and interior branch (98%) support. This clade next
combined with the (An. leucosphyrus + An. latens) clade,
and the resultant clade corresponded to the Leucosphyrus subgroup. The Leucosphyrus subgroup clade combined with the Hackeri subgroup clade (An. sulawesi +
An. mirans), and further combined with the Riparis subgroup clade (An. macarthuri). The NJ topology was consistent with the traditional classification of the
Leucosphyrus group [9], except that the Leucosphyrus
complex were regarded as paraphyletic taxa (Figure 2).
In the MP tree (Figure 3), haplotypes 18-22 from the
Bắc Kạn samples also formed a clade with 100% consensus; this clade was separated from the haplotypes of both
An. takasagoensis and An. dirus. The Bắc Kạn haplotypes
then clustered with haplotypes 26-28 of An. balabacensis
with 66% consensus. Other haplotypes obtained in the
present study (haplotypes 1-17), including those from the
Nghệ An samples, were clustered together with those of
An. dirus from Thailand and An. baimaii from Thailand,
Myanmar, and Bangladesh with 81% consensus. Subsequently, the topology ((((An. dirus, An. baimaii) An. elegans) An. takasagoensis) A. cracens) was supported by
100% consensus (indicated by arrows in Figure 3). This
clade clustered with An. scanloni and the (An. balabacensis + Bắc Kạn samples) clade with 66% consensus and further combined with the An. nemophilous clade with 100%
consensus. This clade then combined with the ((An.
sulawesi + An. mirans: the Hackeri subgroup) + An.
mirans: the Riparis subgroup) clade with 100% consensus,
whereas An. leucosphyrus and An. latens formed the most
basal lineage and second most basal lineage, respectively,
in the Leucosphyrus group (Figure 3). Thus, the MP
topology was less consistent with the traditional classification of the Leucosphyrus group in that neither the
Dirus complex nor the Leucosphyrus complex and the
Leucosphyrus subgroup were regarded as monophyletic
taxa.

3517 most parsimonious trees based on the concatenated sequences of partial COI (221 bp) and ND6 (349 bp) mitochondrial genes. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% trees are condensed. The percentages of parsimonious trees in which the associated taxa clustered together are shown next to the branches. Branch lengths were calculated using the average pathway method and are expressed in units of the

ited wing-spot patterns that are different from those of
An. dirus from southern Vietnam, but similar to those of
An. takasagoensis, which has actually only been found in
Taiwan. However, the spot pattern variations partially
overlap between An. dirus and An. takasagoensis so that
it is generally difficult to determine these species solely
on the basis of morphological characteristics [9]. This
seems to be the very reason why foreign scientists recognized that among the Leucosphyrus group members, An.
dirus is the only species that is distributed in Vietnam.
In the present study, all the haplotypes of the mosquitoes from southern and central Vietnam clustered into
the (An. dirus + An. baimaii) clade. Although partial
sequences of COI and ND6 in mitochondrial DNA do not
provide a clear distinction between An. dirus and An. baimaii [25], [29], it is reasonable to regard the samples from
southern and central Vietnam as An. dirus after taking
into consideration the well known distributions of An.
dirus and An. baimaii [25], [29] (Molecular identification
in Table 1). However, molecular phylogenetic analyses in
this study could not resolve population structure of An.
dirus in Vietnam. This is also the limitation of the molecular markers and beyond the scope of the study so that we
refrain from discussing the population structures of An.
dirus in Vietnam at present.
The haplotypes of samples collected from Bắc Kạn
Province in northern Vietnam were clearly separated
from those of both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis in
both the NJ and MP trees. In the NJ tree, the Bắc Kạn
samples formed a distinct clade with 91% bootstrap and
97% interior branch test support, whereas the (An. dirus
+ An. baimaii) clade formed another clade with An. elegans with 75% bootstrap support and 95% interior branch
test support (indicated by an arrow in Figure 2). In the
MP tree, the Bắc Kạn samples again formed a distinct
clade with 100% consensus, whereas the (An. dirus + An.
baimaii) clade formed another clade with An. elegans
with 100% consensus, and this clade subsequently formed
other clades with An. takasagoensis and An. cracens with
100% consensuses, respectively (indicated by arrows in
Figure 3). These results suggest that the Bắc Kạn samples
are distinctly separated from An. dirus by at least three
valid species--An. elegans, An. takasagoensis, and An.
cracens--and from An. takasagoensis by at least one valid
species--An. cracens. The clade consisting of Bắc Kạn
samples formed another clade with An. balabacensis;
however, the reliability of the branch was not high, with
66% consensus in the MP tree and less than 50% bootstrap and interior branch test support in the NJ tree. The
overall morphological characteristics of the Bắc Kạn
samples, however, were closest to or even indistinguishable from those of An. takasagoensis and An. dirus but
were distinguishable from those of An. balabacensis and
the other Leucosphyrus group members (Figure 1).

Page 13 of 16

Moreover, the distribution of An. balabacensis is known
to be restricted to the area from the Philippines up to
Indonesia.
These results suggest that the mosquito samples
obtained from Bắc Kạn Province belong to the Leucosphyrus group but not to An. dirus, An. takasagoensis, An.
balabacensis, or any other species in the Leucosphyrus
group; thus, these samples seem to represent a newly recognized cryptic species in the Leucosphyrus group. We
tentatively designate the possible cryptic species as
Anopheles aff. takasagoensis for convenience, until a valid
name is assigned.
Phylogenetic relationship among the Leucosphyrus group
members

In the NJ tree, the possible cryptic species formed a clade
together with An. balabacensis and members of the Dirus
complex with 89% bootstrap and 98% interior branch test
support, whereas the other Leucosphyrus complex members, namely, An. leucosphyrus and An. latens, formed
another clade beside the former clade. This topology
seems to be consistent with the indications by Sallum et
al. [25]. They stated that morphological distinction
between the Leucosphyrus and the Dirus complexes is
problematic because some characters used to define the
limits of each species complex are polymorphic. Generally, members of the Leucosphyrus complex can be easily
distinguished from those of the Dirus complex by the
presence of an accessory sector pale (ASP) wing spot on
veins C, subcosta, and R and the absence of pale scales at
the base of hind tarsomere 4 [25]. However, An. balabacensis is polymorphic for these characters and thus can
overlap with members of both the Dirus complex and
Leucosphyrus complex [25].
In the MP tree, the (An. aff. takasagoensis + An. balabacensis + members of the Dirus complex) clade was also
supported by 100% consensus, whereas the topology
within the clade was consistent with that observed in the
case of the NJ tree only for the (((An. dirus, An. baimaii)
An. elegans) An. takasagoensis) relationship. Moreover,
An. leucosphyrus and An. latens were separated from the
other members of the Leucosphyrus subgroup and
formed the most basal lineage and second most basal lineage in the Leucosphyrus group, respectively. This might
be partly because of the long-branch attraction, to which
the MP method is more sensitive than the NJ method
with a corrected distance model is. It is not possible to
correct for multiple nucleotide substitutions at the same
site in the MP method; this leads to systematic underestimation of the genetic distances. Hence, distant species
will either be clustered together or drawn toward the root
of the tree [30], [31]. However, this basal positioning of
An. leucosphyrus and An. latens was also reproduced by
phylogenetic reconstruction using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods in our preliminary analyses

(data not shown). This indicates the limitations of the
present dataset: the length of the sequence data is limited,
and it includes 13 of 20 species in the Leucosphyrus
group whereas including all the species from various
locality is desirable.
Although the information is limited, we would like to
propose following three hypotheses to be tested in the
future studies. First, An. nemophilous should be removed
from the Dirus complex. The remaining members of the
Dirus complex are then characterized by morphological
characteristics in that pale scales on anterior veins of
wing, especially those on presector pale and sector pale
spots of the costa, are white and contrasting with other
yellowish to golden pale spots on remaining posterior
veins [9] (but An. aff. takasagoensis has the same characteristics). Second, members of the newly hypothesized
Dirus complex (An. dirus, An. cracens, An. scanloni, An.
baimaii, An. elegans, and An. takasagoensis) and An.
nemophilous, An. balabacensis and An. aff. takasagoensis
further form a distinct taxonomical group that is equivalent to a subgroup. Third, An. leucosphyrus and An. latens
belong to the most basal or even an outer group of the
remaining members of the Leucosphyrus subgroup analyzed in this study.
Morphology of the cryptic species

The cryptic species exhibited morphological characteristics distinguishable from those of typical An. dirus in
southern Vietnam: the presector dark spot on vein R that
does not extend or barely extends basally beyond the presector pale spot on the costa, a pale fringe spot present
between veins 1A and Cu2, and an accessory sector pale
spot on the subcosta on at least one wing.
We must note, however, that these characteristics are
still included within the intraspecific morphological variation of An. dirus[9]. Samples from Nghệ An Province in
central Vietnam exhibited the same morphological characteristics of the cryptic species, but their haplotypes
were placed within the monophyletic clade consisting of
An. dirus haplotypes. The samples collected from Ninh
Bình Province in northern Vietnam and analyzed by
Manguin et al. ([24], mentioned in Background), with
morphological characteristics of both An. dirus and An.
takasagoensis, might have been individuals of this An.
dirus type. The geographical proximity of Ninh Bình and
Nghệ An provinces supports this speculation. It is known
that wing-spot patterns of Anopheles mosquitoes can
vary according to temperature and day-length [32]. The
wing-spot patterns of An. dirus might also vary along
with the longitude in Vietnam.
Distribution of the species

According to the collection records based on identification using wing-spot patterns, populations of the hypo-

Page 14 of 16

thetical cryptic species have been shrinking after the
1970s, presumably because of deforestation in northern
Vietnam (NDM, personal observation). Samples of the
putative cryptic species have been sporadically collected
from central and northern Vietnam. In 1970, 14 larvae
were collected from a rice field surrounded by a forest in
Cúc Phuong National Park in Ninh Bình Province. The
resultant nine larval and five pupal exuviae and nine
female-adult specimens are deposited in NIMPE, even
though the each exuviae is mounted on a slide grass and
the each adult specimens is encapsulated in a glass tube
and is not available for genetic analyses. In 1973, less than
10 adult females were collected by human bate from Hòa
An District, Cao Báng Province, which is located along
the northern border with China (NDM, personal communication). In 2001, the putative cryptic species was
collected from Yên Thành Commune, Quang Bình District, Hà Giang Province, which is also located along the
northern border with China (Le Xuan Hoi, personal communication). Also in 2001, the putative cryptic species is
collected from Chiêng Yên commune, Môc Châu District,
Son La Province, which is located along northern-western border with Laos. Other samples are also collected
from Trương Son commune, Luong Son District and
Phúc San commune, Mai Châu District in Hòa Bình
Province in northern Vietnam. Taking the information
above and the results of molecular analyses in Manguin et
al. [24] and the present study into consideration, An. aff.
takasagoensis seems to replace An. dirus in the north of
Ninh Bình Province (about 20°N). However, it is unclear
whether An. dirus and An. aff. takasagoensis are distributed sympatrically. Further confirmation using molecular
markers is necessary.
Bắc Kạn Province, from where An. aff. takasagoensis
samples were collected in this study, is located near the
border of Vietnam and China. Anopheles baimaii occurs
in Yunnan Province in China along the borders of Laos
and Myanmar [33]. Walton et al. [34] showed that the
ITS2 sequence of the Chinese "species D" (An. dirus species D or An. baimaii) of Xu and Qu [35] is distinct from
that of specimens collected in Thailand and suggested
that the Chinese "species D" may represent an unrecognized species of the Dirus complex. We, however, failed
to obtain consistent ITS2 sequences from our samples
over the course of the present study. Confirmation of the
genetic identities of An. aff. takasagoensis and the putative An. baimaii from the areas along the Vietnam, China,
Laos, and Myanmar borders is also necessary.
Biology of the possible cryptic species

The larval habitat of An. aff. takasagoensis was similar to
that of An. dirus in southern Vietnam as described in
Methods. However, the population density of An. aff.
takasagoensis was extremely low so that we obtained only

Takano et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:41
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/41

11 larvae during the field collection for one week with
seven staff members, even though we targeted on only
this species. Moreover, the existence of the samples were
localized; we found the samples from only one commune
among four communes investigated.
In allozyme analyses of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glucose
phosphomutase (GPM), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), other specimens of putative An. aff.
takasagoensis also exhibited a different banding pattern
from that of An. dirus in southern Vietnam (NTHN et al.,
unpublished data). In 2006, a 10 staff-member team of
NIMPE were able to collect only five female adults in a
buffalo hat over a one-month field-collection period in
the same study area in Bắc Kạn (Le Xuan Hoi et al., personal communication). In 2007, Manh et al. collected two
female adults of the putative cryptic species at the same
buffalo hat. We succeeded to obtain partial COI (but not
ND6) sequences of these two samples, and the haplotypes
clustered with those of other An. aff. takasagoensis specimens analyzed in the present study (data not shown).
These female adults seem to have been attracted by the
buffalo. NDM, one of the co-authors of this study, failed
in his attempt to feed an adult female with his blood in
order to obtain progeny. This implies that the hypothetical cryptic species tends to be zoophilic, although in general, An. dirus is a highly anthropophilic species. This
information reinforces our hypothesis that the mosquito
population from northern Vietnam belongs to a cryptic
species. Further investigations of such as karyotypes and
polytene chromosome banding patterns are necessary to
confirm whether An. aff. takasagoensis is a valid species.

Conclusions
Morphological examination and molecular phylogenetic
analyses of the members of the Leucosphyrus group in
Vietnam suggested the existence of a cryptic species that
is morphologically similar to, but genetically distant from
both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis. We tentatively designated the species as Anopheles aff. takasagoensis. However, it was difficult to identify the species solely on the
basis of morphological characteristics. Further studies on
such as polytene chromosome banding patterns and
karyotypes are necessary to confirm whether An. aff.
takasagoensis is a valid species. Further studies on the (1)
geographic distribution, which is potentially spreading
along the Vietnam, China, Laos, and Myanmar borders;
(2) morphological and ecological characteristics; and (3)
vectorial capacity of this newly identified possible cryptic
species of An. dirus, which is one of the most important
malaria vectors in mainland Southeast Asia, are necessary for efficient malaria vector control in this region.
