Abstract
Objective: The continuous identification of HIV-1 non-B subtypes and recombinant forms in Italy
indicates the need of constant molecular epidemiology survey of genetic forms circulating and
transmitted in the resident population.
Methods: The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes has been evaluated in 25 seropositive individuals
residing in Italy, most of whom were infected through a sexual route during the 1995–2005 period.
Each sample has been characterized by detailed molecular and phylogenetic analyses.
Results: 18 of the 25 samples were positive at HIV-1 PCR amplification. Three samples showed a
nucleotide divergence compatible with a non-B subtype classification. The phylogenetic analysis,
performed on both HIV-1 env and gag regions, confirms the molecular sub-typing prediction, given
that 1 sample falls into the C subtype and 2 into the G subtype. The B subtype isolates show high
levels of intra-subtype nucleotide divergence, compatible with a long-lasting epidemic and a
progressive HIV-1 molecular diversification.
Conclusion: The Italian HIV-1 epidemic is still mostly attributable to the B subtype, regardless the
transmission route, which shows an increasing nucleotide heterogeneity. Heterosexual
transmission and the interracial blending, however, are slowly introducing novel HIV-1 subtypes.
Therefore, a molecular monitoring is needed to follow the constant evolution of the HIV-1
epidemic.

Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shows an
extensive genetic variability and can be classified into 9
phylogenetic subtypes (A-K), which are approximately
equidistant from one another, and several circulating
recombinant forms (CRFs), resulting from recombination
events occurring between different HIV-1 subtypes co-circulating in a specific geographic region [1].
The first phase of the HIV epidemic in Italy has been
mainly confined to the injecting drug users (IDUs) risk
group, with an absolute predominance of HIV-1 B subtype, in accordance with other Western Countries. In particular, among the total AIDS cases reported in the adult
population during the period between 1982 and 2006,
56.0% were IDUs (including also homosexual IDUs) with
similar percentages in men and women groups (57.3%
and 51.5%, respectively) [2]. The annual percentages of
AIDS cases reported in IDUs have gradually decreased
from 65.8% in 1987 to 27.6% in 2006 [2], in part as consequence of prevention programs implemented in Italy to
discourage syringe sharing [3,4]. In parallel, the overall
AIDS cases reported in heterosexual individuals account
for the 19.5% of total epidemic cases, with a significantly
higher percentage in the women category compared to
men (41.2% vs 13.6%). However, the annual percentage
of AIDS cases related to the heterosexual transmission has
dramatically increased over the years, becoming in 2006
the most prevalent risk factor for AIDS (40.4%) [2].
Although almost 25% of heterosexual individuals diagnosed with AIDS in Italy are partners of long-term HIV-1
infected individuals, carrying a "historical" B-subtype
virus, more than 10% of them are either immigrants from
endemic regions for HIV-1 (6.87%) or their Italian partners (3.03%), while the risk is unidentified for 64% of
them [2]. This epidemiological evidence, based only on
the AIDS reported cases and not considering all the HIV-1
infections derived also from travelling abroad, suggests
that at least 10% of the viruses transmitted through heterosexual contacts could potentially belong to non-B subtypes and CRFs. In fact, HIV-1 isolates genetically related
to subtypes novel to the Italian epidemic have been
recently increasingly identified and described [5-17].
This has been recently reported in other European Countries, with a higher prevalence of non-B subtypes and
CRFs due to an older tradition of immigration waves and
much tighter historical as well as economic links with
countries endemic for HIV-1 infection [18-30].
In this framework, the introduction and the possible
spread of different HIV-1 subtypes and/or recombinant
forms, which could require the future development of

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/3/1/13

adequate diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies,
needs to be constantly monitored.
For the present study, 25 HIV-seropositive individuals
residing in Italy were enrolled at sentinel Centers, with a
HIV-infection diagnosed in the period 1995–2005. The
molecular study has been performed on the hypervariable
C2-V3 region of the env gene as well as the more conserved 5' region of the gag p17 sequence. Three non-Bsubtype HIV-1 isolates have been identified and phylogenetically classified as C (1 isolate) and G (2 isolates) subtype.

Methods
Sample Collection
Blood samples were collected from 25 HIV-positive individuals attending Italian sentinel Centers in Bologna,
Parma and Naples. For all of them, HIV infection was
diagnosed during the 1995 to 2005 period, and most participants were infected through sexual contact (18 of 25,
72%). HIV-1 infection was diagnosed by immunologic
methods (ELISA, Western blot), and the viral load was
evaluated by viral RNA quantification. The full designation of samples, according to WHO-proposed nomenclature, is CI05.00XE or CI05.00XG, where CI stands for the
city of enrolment, 05 stands for the year of study, 00 for
the enrolment number and E (or G) stands for env (or
gag). For the sake of simplicity, however, in this paper the
samples have been indicated with CI05.01 (i.e. BO05.01).
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from fresh HIV-1-positive blood samples by Leucoprep density gradient centrifugation, and cellular lysates
(approximately 6 × 106 cells) were prepared by Proteinase
K digestion at 56°C.

The quality of target DNA was verified by PCR amplification of the housekeeping p53 cellular gene. The amplification of HIV-1 V3-V5 region of the env gene and p17 region
of the gag gene were performed by nested PCR analysis,
using 1.5 × 105 cells (corresponding to approximately 1 μg
of genomic DNA) as a template. The V3-V5 region of the
HIV-1 env gene (666 bp) was amplified, as previously
described, using the primer pairs ED5-ED12 and ES7-ES8
for the first and the second round of amplification, respectively [31,32]. The p17 region (474 bp) was amplified, as
previously described, using the primer pairs CL1028CL1033 and CL1029-CL1032 for the first and the second
round of amplification, respectively [14,33].
DNA Sequencing
Direct sequencing reactions were performed on PCR products purified with a rapid method developed in our laboratory, following the Sequenase protocol (United States

Biochemical, Cleveland OH), modified in the labelling
step (3 minutes on ice) [31,34]. The internal annealing
oligonucleotides, V3B and GAG B SENSE (annealing to a
19 bp fragment of the C2-V3 region and a 17 bp of the
p17 region, respectively), were used to prime sense
sequence reactions. Sequences were then analyzed on 6%
polyacrylamide wedge sequencing gel.
Analysis of Sequences
The env and gag sequences obtained were aligned. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the MegAlign application of the Lasergene software (DNASTAR
Inc., Madison, WI) using the Clustal method. Phylogenetic trees were generated by using the neighbor-joining
method with the PHYLIP software package (version 3.52c;
Joseph Felsenstein, University of Washington). Briefly, the
SEQBOOT program was carried out to generate 100 data
sets that represent randomly re-sampled versions of the
input-aligned sequences, to test the reliability of the final
tree topology. Evolutionary distances were estimated by
the DNADIST program, using either the Kimura 2-parameter method or the maximum likelihood distance
method, and the phylogenetic relationships were determined by the NEIGHBOR program. A consensus tree was
constructed using the CONSENSE program with the
majority rule criterion and was drawn with the NJPLOT
application.

Results
Epidemiologic and clinical parameters
Overall, 25 HIV-1-seropositive subjects were enrolled in
the study. Of them, 32% (8 of 25) were heterosexuals,
36% (9 of 25) were male homosexuals, 4% (1 of 25) was
a bisexual and 28% (7 of 25) were IDUs. All but 6 subjects
were native Italian, with stable or occasional sexual partners of different nationalities. In particular, the enrolled
subjects included an Ethiopian (PR06.03), an Albanian
(NA05.04), an Ivorian (PR06.05), a Venezuelan
(PR06.06) and two Nigerians (NA05.03, PR06.07). The
CD4+ counts ranged from 169 to 1387 cells/mm3
(median, 664 cells/mm3) (Table 1).
Amplification of Italian samples by PCR
The C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene and the p17
region of the gag gene were amplified by nested PCR using
primers and conditions previously described [14]. Overall, 60% of the samples (15 of 25) were positive at the
PCR amplification reactions for both env and gag subgenomic regions. However, 64% of the samples (16 of 25)
were positive at the amplification reaction for env and
68% of the samples (17 of 25) were positive to the amplification reaction for gag. Therefore, one sample
(BO07.14) was positive only in env and two samples
(NA05.05 e NA05.06) were positive only in gag; the
remaining 7 samples were negative to both sub-genomic

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/3/1/13

regions. This result might be the consequence of either
mutations in the primers' annealing regions, reducing the
melting temperature, or proviral DNA quantity below the
threshold of sensibility. An example of the results
obtained by nested PCR for env (666 bp) and gag (474 bp)
is shown in Figure 1A and 1B.
Molecular analysis of env gene
The nucleotide sequence analysis has been performed on
the C2-V3 region of the env gene, directly from the PCR
products without a sub-cloning step. The Italian HIV-1
nucleotide sequences, aligned with HIV-1 reference standards of different subtypes, Groups and CRF02_AG, have
been aligned with Clustal method, to determine the
homology values between the analyzed samples. The
results, show an average divergence of 19.66% within the
Italian group, with values ranging from 7.1 to 33.9% (data
not shown). The Italian sequences, showed average divergences of 17.97% versus standards of B clade; 25.87% versus standards of other HIV genotypes of Group M; 43.14%
and 48.4% versus standards of Groups N and O, respectively (Figure 2A). Nevertheless, specific samples show a
>30% divergence versus the B clade, strongly suggesting a
non-B clade classification. In particular, the sample
PR06.07 shows an average divergence of 15% versus the
CRF02_AG and 23.2% versus all other clades (Figure 2B);
the sample PR06.03 shows an average divergence of 18%
versus the C clade and 22.7% versus all other clades (Figure 2C). Therefore, the results suggest a B-clade classification for the vast majority of the analyzed Italian sequences
and a C-clade and CRF02_AG classification for the latter
samples.
Molecular analysis of gag gene
The nucleotide sequence analysis has been performed on
the p17 region of the gag gene, directly from the PCR
products without a sub-cloning step. As for the env gene,
the HIV-1 nucleotide sequences have been aligned with
Clustal method to HIV-1 reference standards of different
subtypes, Groups and CRF02_AG, in order to determine
the homology values between the analyzed samples. The
results show an average divergence of 15.86% within the
Italian group, with values ranging from 10.81 to 29.16%
(data not shown). The Italian sequences, showed average
divergences of 16.88% versus standards of B clade;
25.99% versus standards of other HIV genotypes of Group
M; 48.54% and 44.15% versus the standards of Groups N
and O, respectively (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, specific
samples show a >22% divergence versus the B clade,
strongly suggesting a non-B clade classification. In particular, the sample PR06.07, also in the gag region, shows an
average divergence of 13% versus the CRF02_AG and
24.34% versus all other clades (Figure 3B). Similarly, the
sample PR06.03, also in the gag region, shows an average
divergence of 22% versus the C clade and 32.08% versus

Average nucleotide divergence of C2-V5 env gene versus standard sequences of different clades. The shown
average divergence values have been obtained aligning the Italian sequences with standard sequences of individual clades,
Groups and CRF02_AG. (A) The lowest average divergence value of the whole group of sequences is versus B standard
sequences (arrow); (B) the sample PR06.07 shows the lowest average divergence value versus CRF02_AG standards (arrow);

negative for env, shows an average divergence of 13.9%
versus the CRF02_AG and 25.31% versus all other clades
(Figure 3C). Therefore, also in the gag region, the results
suggest a B-clade classification for the vast majority of the
analyzed Italian sequences and confirm a C-clade or
CRF02_AG classification for the same samples identified
in env.
Phylogenetic analysis of C2-V3 env and p17 gag sequences
Nucleotide sequences have been pairwise aligned with
HIV-1 reference standards of different subtypes and CRFs,
discounting gaps due to nucleotide insertions/deletions.
The alignments of HIV-1 env and gag nucleotide
sequences have been used to generate phylogenetic trees
by the neighbor-joining method. Confidence values for
individual branches have been determined by a bootstrap

analysis. The reference standards of different subtypes as
well as CRFs included in this study cluster in the expected
distinct phylogenetic branches in both env and gag subgenomic regions, indicating that the length of sequence
fragments used in this analysis is sufficient for the identification of known subtypes.
All the Italian HIV-1 isolates showing a rate of nucleotide
divergence less than 30% in env and 20% in gag versus
standards of the B clade, phylogenetically cluster with reference standards of this clade in both env and gag subgenomic regions, forming several sub-clusters. Similarly,
the 3 samples showing a lower nucleotide divergence
both in env and gag versus standards of the C clade or the
CRF02-AG, cluster with these non-B subtype standards in
both sub-genomic regions, confirming the tentative sub-

type classification based on nucleotide divergence values
(Figure 4 and 5).
Moreover, all isolates show a concordant subtype classification in both env and gag sub-genomic regions, suggesting the absence of intra-genomic recombination events.
Peptide analysis and comparison
The V3 and p17 region amino acid sequences have been
deduced for each isolate by computer analysis and aligned
following their subtype classification. The V3 region of the
Italian B-subtype isolates identified in this study shows an
amino acid variability mainly localized outside the V3
loop region. The consensus derived from the alignment,
in fact, shows that the amino acid residues conserved in
100% of the aligned sequences are all localized in the V3

loop (9 of 35, 25.71%). However, besides the subtypespecific "fingerprint" GPGR sequence at the tip of the V3
loop, less-represented sequences have been identified at
the tip (GPGG, GPGS, GPGQ), suggesting a constant
diversification in the B clade (Figure 6A).
In regards to the non-B clade isolates identified in this
study, and distributed in two different clades (C and
CRF02-AG), the too limited number of samples hampers
the possibility to derive a consensus sequence and to infer
conclusions; nevertheless, it is worthwhile to mention
that they all show the "fingerprint" GPGQ tetramer at the
tip of their V3 loop sequences (data not shown).
Moreover, mutations in amino acid residues conferring
resistance to fusion/binding inhibitors, in association

with other mutations along the env sequence not analyzed in the present study, have been observed (i.e.
Q296K), suggesting the transmission of isolates resistant
to this class of antiretrovirals (Figure 6A) [35-37].
The p17 region of the B clade isolates shows a low aminoacidic variability and the consensus derived from the
alignment shows an overall rate of amino acid conservation of 44.44% (36 of 81 residues). None of the observed
amino acid changes is found in gag residues conferring
drug resistance (Figure 6B). Similar results are observed
also for non-B clade isolates.

Discussion
A molecular and phylogenetic characterization was performed on HIV-1 variants identified in individuals residing in Italy and infected in the 1995–2005 period. The
groups at high risk of HIV-1 infection (heterosexuals,
homosexuals and IDUs) were equally represented in the
present study. The C2-V5 and p17 regions of the env and
gag gene have been amplified from uncultured PBMCs of

Italian samples by the standardized nested PCR conditions.
Informative regions of the 2 structural gag and env genes
have been studied in parallel, to have an immediate picture of the evolution pattern in viral regions under different immune pressure and to identify possible intragenomic recombinants. In fact, considering the worldwide represented CRFs described until now, the p17 gag
and the C2-V3 env regions show a different subtype designation in most of cases and are highly diagnostic for the
identification of novel recombinants.
The average nucleotide divergences versus standard
sequences of different subtypes suggest the presence of B
and non-B subtypes among the Italian sequences identified in the present study. Moreover, within the B subtype
sequences, the average divergence in the env C2-V3 region
is 18.08%, with values ranging from 7.1 to 29.9%. On the
contrary, the average divergence in the gag p17 region is
11.13%, with values ranging from 7.79 to 16.86%. These

Phylogenetic classification of the p17 region of gag gene
Phylogenetic classification of the p17 region of gag gene. The p17 region of gag gene from Italian samples has been
aligned with standard sequences of HIV-1 group M including some known CRF. Sequences from groups N and O have been
used as outgroup. Italian sequences are indicated as underlined. Reliability has been estimated by boot-strap analysis. The bar
shows a 10% divergence.

observed divergence values are compatible with samples
identified in a geographical area characterized by a longlasting HIV epidemic and confirm the more pronounced
genetic evolution of env gene compared to gag.

for the anti-V3 neutralizing antibodies. However, less-represented sequences have been identified at the tip of the B
clade isolates (GPGG, GPGS, GPGQ), suggesting a constant diversification in this clade.

The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the nucleotide divergence subtype prediction for both B and non-B-subtype
classification; in particular, of the 3 non-B isolates, 2 cluster with CRF02-AG (NA05.05 and PR06.07), 1 with the C
subtype (PR06.03). Moreover, for all the B- and non-Bsubtype sequences, the phylogenetic classification
matches in the gag and env sub-genomic regions, suggesting the absence of intra-genomic recombination events.

The overall results suggest that the B subtype is still largely
predominant in the HIV-1 epidemic in Italy and is circulating among all risk groups. On the contrary, HIV-1 nonB subtypes in Italy are strictly associated with the heterosexual transmission and are identified in infections
acquired in the last period (2001–2005). The three nonB-subtype HIV-1 isolates are strictly associated with heterosexual transmission. The samples PR06.03 and PR06.07,
corresponding to an Ethiopian and a Nigerian subject
respectively, belong to the subtype/CRF predominant in
their respective Country of origin, suggesting an infection
either prior to the immigration to Italy or subsequent but
through heterosexual contacts with HIV-infected subjects
from those Countries. The sample NA05.05, on the contrary, corresponds to an Italian-born subject with a possible partner/s from Regions with high endemicity for HIV
infections.

The phenetic analysis of the V3 region shows a significant
amino acid stability in 9 residues of the V3 loop, for Bsubtype isolates, confirming the strong selection for specific sequences involved in strategic functions regarding
the immune response as well as cellular tropism and
transmission. The different HIV-1 isolates identified in the
current study show the subtype-specific tetrameric
sequence at the apex of the V3 loop (GPGR for B clade,
GPGQ for non-B clades), which is considered the target

Alignment of the amino acid sequences
Alignment of the amino acid sequences. (A) V3 env region and (B) p17 gag region have been aligned, and a consensus
sequence (top) has been generated. Question marks (?) have been introduced in the consensus when, in the specific position,
no residue is found in more than 50% of sequences. Dots (.) indicate agreement with the consensus and dashes (-) indicate a
gap inserted to maintain the alignment. Gray areas indicate perfectly conserved residues. Boxed residues indicate mutations
possibly conferring resistance to class of drugs.

These results confirm that in Italy, as in other Western
European countries, non-B subtypes or recombinant
forms are introduced by immigrants/migrants and transmitted at a low rate to the indigenous population. This
would also explain the lower prevalence of non-B subtypes in Italy compared with other European countries
with an older tradition of immigration waves and much
tighter historic and economic links with African countries.
The presented data are representative of a nationwide
molecular survey and, regardless the small sample size,
are part of recurrent studies giving a constant updated picture of the genetic evolution of the HIV-1 epidemics in different risk groups in Italy.
