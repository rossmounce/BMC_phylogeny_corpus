Detection of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus
(VHSV) from Diporeia spp. (Pontoporeiidae,
Amphipoda) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, USA
Mohamed Faisal1,2*, Andrew D Winters1

Abstract
The mode of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) transmission in the Great Lakes basin is largely unknown. In
order to assess the potential role of macroinvertebrates in VHSV transmission, Diporeia spp., a group of amphipods
that are preyed upon by a number of susceptible Great Lakes fishes, were collected from seven locations in four of
the Great Lakes and analyzed for the presence of VHSV. It was demonstrated that VHSV is present in some Diporeia
spp. samples collected from lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, but not from Lake Superior. Phylogenetic
comparison of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 base pairs) of the five isolates to sequences of 13
other VHSV strains showed the clustering of Diporeia spp. isolates with the VHSV genotype IVb. This study reports
the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia, or any other crustacean and
underscores the role macroinvertebrates may play in VHSV ecology.
Findings
The viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), genotype IVb, is a recent invader to the Laurentian Great
Lakes basin and has been associated with mortalities in
a number of resident freshwater fish species [1], [2], [3],
[4]. While laboratory studies demonstrated that the
virus can be transmitted to naïve fish by both immersion and injection [5], [6], [7], the mode of VHSV transmission in the Great Lakes basin is largely unknown. In
a previous study, it was concluded the pisocolid intermittent leech Myzobdella lugubris harbors VHSV [8].
Whether other macroinvertebrates can act as a vector
or reservoir for VHSV remains to be elucidated.
In the Great Lakes foodweb, amphipods of the genera
Diporeia, Gammarus, and Hyalella occupy a central position as they transform energy from lower to higher trophic
levels [9]. Unfortunately, Diporeia spp. have experienced a
sharp decline sharp decline in abundance over the last two
decades [10]; the cause(s) of which puzzle scientists. To
tackle this enigma, a study was designed that involved
comprehensive parasitological and microbiological analysis
of Diporeia spp. collected from lakes Ontario, Huron,

impacting Diporeia spp. in the Great Lakes, submitted].
Diporeia spp. were collected between August 2007 and
April 2008 by taking Ponar grabs from seven locations in
the Great Lakes basin at depths between 74-190 meters.
The approximate locations of collections of Diporeia spp.
are shown in Figure 1. Collected Diporeia spp. were pooled
(five amphipods/pool), immersed briefly in absolute ethanol for surface disinfection, and then rinsed several times
in sterile water. Samples (~100 μg) were homogenized with
a sterile mortar and pestle and then diluted with 1 ml Earle’s salt-based minimal essential medium (MEM, INVITROGEN). Homogenized Diporeia contents were removed
with a sterile transfer pipette, dispensed into a sterile 1.5
ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 5500 rcf for 20 min
and supernatants were immediately used for virus isolation.
Since there is currently no amphipod cell line that could
be used to aid in the isolation of amphipod-pathogenic
viruses, virus isolation was performed according to the
standard protocols detailed in the American Fisheries
Society Blue Book [11] and the Office International des
Epizooties [12], using the Epithelioma papulosum cyprinii
(EPC) cell line [13]. Inoculated 96-well plates containing
EPC cells grown with MEM (5% fetal bovine serum)
were incubated at 15°C for 21 days, and were observed
for the formation of cytopathic effects (CPE). Second and

third blind passages were performed and assessed for the
presence of CPE. All cell culture positive samples of
Diporeia homogenates (ON41, ON55-M, HU54-M,
MI18-M, and MI27-M) caused CPE on EPC in the form
of focal areas of rounded, refractile cells which progressed to full lysis of the cell monolayer.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was then performed on all samples (Table 1) Total
RNA was extracted from inoculated cell culture supernatant using a QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
Reverse transcription was accomplished by a two-step
protocol using the Affinity Script Multiple Temperature
Reverse Transcriptase RT-PCR™ (AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES). The primer set used in this assay was recommended by the Office de International Epizootics for the

detection of a 811 base pair sequence of the VHSV
nucleocapsid (N) gene: 5’-GGG GAC CCC AGA CTG T3’ (forward primer) and 5’-TCT CTG TCA CCT TGA
TCC-3’ (reverse primer). Amplicons of 811 base pairs
were amplified in all cell culture positive samples.
The RT-PCR yielded five samples (ON41, ON55-M,
HU54-M, MI18-M, and MI27-M) with the characteristic
VHSV 811 bp band. The amplicons were further purified with the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (PROMEGA) and then sequenced from both
directions. Overlapping sequences for each isolate were
aligned using the BioEdit contig assembly program version 7.0.9.0 [14] and the aligned contigs were used for
multiple alignments performed by ClustalW [15]. Phylogenetic analysis of the VHSV Diporeia strain with 14

Figure 2 Distance tree constructed for phylogenetic comparison of isolates obtained in this study. The tree generated using the
Neighbor-joining algorithm and maximum likelihood method shows high phylogenetic similarity between the five viral hemorrhagic septicemia
virus (VHSV) isolates obtained in this study (ON41, ON55-M, HU54-M, MI18-M, and MI27-M) and other isolates belonging to the VHSV genotype
IVb. The alignment file used to produce the tree contained partial VHSV nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 nucleotide positions). Snakehead
rhabdovirus was used as the outgroup. The scale bar indicates the number of substitutions per nucleotide site.

nucleoprotein encoding genes from other species of
rhabdovirus was done by generating the phylogenetic
dendrogram (Figure 2) using MEGA 4 [16] and the
Neighbor-Joining algorithm [17]. Phylogenetic analysis
of the five Diporeia isolate sequences (737 bp) base
pairs [GenBank: HQ214133-HQ214135, HQ415762HQ415763] showed that the sequences clustered with
the VHSV IVb-MI03 strain, the index strain of the
Great Lakes VHSV [GenBank: DQ427105]. In comparison to the Great Lakes VHSV strain, two nucleotide
substitutions were observed in Diporeia isolates from
both lakes Huron and Michigan: a transition from cytosine to thymine at nucleotide position 408 which caused
a silent mutation and a transversion from guanine to
thymine at nucleotide position 907 which caused a
mutation from glycine to cysteine.
Our findings provided evidence that VHSV can exist
within Diporeia spp. Whether VHSV propagates in the
cells of these amphipods or just existed in their viscera or
gills is currently unknown and deserves further investigation. Indeed, the presence of VHSV in Diporeia spp. in
three of the four Great Lakes sampled is surprising since
these amphipods were collected from depths that ranged
from 74-190 meters where none of the susceptible fish are
known to reside. Diporeia spp. feed on detritus and planktonic organisms and is known to scavenge for food items
in lower depths. Such a feeding habit has the potential to
transfer VHSV from the benthos to the pelagic zone
through their excreta or by being preyed upon by susceptible fish; lake whitefish for example. Moreover, based exclusively on data generated in this study, one cannot rule out
that VHSV is a pathogen of Diporeia spp. or that Diporeia
spp. can be a reservoir for VHSV in the Great Lakes.
Regardless of these currently unanswered questions, this
study reports the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia, or other crustacean.
This finding underscores the dire need to better understand the role of macroinvertebrates in disease ecology.
