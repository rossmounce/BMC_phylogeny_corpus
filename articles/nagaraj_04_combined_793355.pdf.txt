Abstract
Background: The analysis of gene expression using DNA microarrays provides genome wide
profiles of the genes controlled by the presence or absence of a specific transcription factor.
However, the question arises of whether a change in the level of transcription of a specific gene is
caused by the transcription factor acting directly at the promoter of the gene or through regulation
of other transcription factors working at the promoter.
Results: To address this problem we have devised a computational method that combines
microarray expression and site preference data. We have tested this approach by identifying
functional targets of the a1-α2 complex, which represses haploid-specific genes in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis identified many known or suspected haploid-specific genes
that are direct targets of the a1-α2 complex, as well as a number of previously uncharacterized
targets. We were also able to identify a number of haploid-specific genes which do not appear to
be direct targets of the a1-α2 complex, as well as a1-α2 target sites that do not repress
transcription of nearby genes. Our method has a much lower false positive rate when compared
to some of the conventional bioinformatic approaches.
Conclusions: These findings show advantages of combining these two forms of data to investigate
the mechanism of co-regulation of specific sets of genes.

Background
A bioinformatic approach to identifying cis-regulatory
elements controlling transcription has become feasible
with the availability of complete genome sequences and
large scale expression data using high-throughput methods such as microarrays [1,2] and SAGE [3]. The expression data provides a list of genes whose expression is

significantly modified under a particular condition. However, this data does not indicate whether these genes are
direct targets of a particular transcription factor or if the
changes in expression are the result of an indirect effect
caused by altering the expression of other transcription
factors that work directly at the promoter. Using information about sequence preference for binding of particular

transcription factors, one can identify possible regulatory
binding sites within a sequenced genome. However, this
approach does not indicate if the sites are functional. We
have therefore developed an algorithm that combines
both of these approaches to distinguish between the direct
and indirect targets that are regulated by a particular transcription factor.
We have applied this methodology to study the transcriptional regulatory system that specifies cell mating-type in
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [4]. Yeast have three cell
types, haploid a and α cells, and the a/α diploid, that differ in their ability to mate and in the proteins they express.
Cell mating-type is determined in part by α2 and a1,
which are cell-type-specific proteins that are members of
the homeodomain (HD) DNA-binding family. In an a/α
diploid cell, α2 binds with a1 to form a heterodimer complex that represses transcription of haploid-specific genes
[5]. The crystal structures of the α2 HD binding DNA
alone and in complex with a1 have been solved, providing
models for how these complexes bind DNA [6,7]. Biochemical and mutational analysis of each protein and
their DNA-binding sites have defined the requirements
for DNA recognition by this complex [8-10]. Genomewide expression analysis has also been performed on each
of the different cell types [11]. The combination of these
resources has allowed us to develop and test algorithms to
identify target sites for the a1-α2 complex. Previous work,
using a relatively simple binding site search program identified targets for the α2-Mcm1 complex, which represses acell-type specific genes in α and a/α cells [12]. The more
advanced methods described in this paper have helped
identify several novel targets of the a1-α2 complex that
may be involved in cell-type specific processes. Interestingly, we identified several genes that are repressed in diploid cells but do not appear to be direct targets of the a1α2 complex, suggesting that these genes are controlled by
another transcriptional regulatory factor that is directly or
indirectly regulated by the a1-α2 complex. We have also
identified a number of a1-α2 target sites that do not
repress adjacent genes. The combination of site preference
and expression data is therefore a valuable tool to identify
direct functional targets of a transcription factor or
complex.

Results
Development of a search algorithm for targets of the a1α2 complex
To generate an algorithm that combines microarray
expression data and mutational analysis of binding sites,
we first defined a scoring method that ranks gene expression data. We utilized the microarray expression data
from Galitski and coworkers for gene expression in the a
and α haploid and a/α diploid cells, as well as various
polyploids [11]. Since the a1-α2 complex should be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/59

absent in any of the homozygous a or α type polyploids
(a, aa, ..., α,αα,..., etc.) we expect the expression of haploid-specific genes in these cells to be much higher than in
cells that are heterozygous for the MAT locus (aα, aaα,
aαα, aaαα, etc.). Thus, one term in the scoring function
rewards lower expression in heterozygous cell types compared to the homozygous cell types (see the Methods section for details). We expect that most of the haploidspecific genes will be expressed equally in both of a and α
cell types. Consequently, we have introduced a second
term in the scoring function that penalizes such differences in expression in the two haploid cell types. This
scoring function would identify haploid-specific genes
that are repressed in diploid cells, but would not indicate
if these genes are direct targets of the a1-α2 repressor
complex.
To identify genes from this ranking that are directly
repressed by the a1-α2 complex we used the available
mutational data on the a1-α2-binding site [9]. In these
experiments, the effects of single base pair mutations of
the a1-α2 consensus binding site were measured by assaying their ability to repress transcription of a heterologous
promoter and by electrophoretic mobility shift DNAbinding assays (EMSA). Under the assumption that the
level of expression is proportional to how often that site is
unoccupied, we used the effects of the single base mutations to estimate the parameters for the binding energy of
sites with different bases at each position. We then used
this information to search for potentially strong binding
sites in the promoter regions (in practice, 800 bp
upstream of the translation start site) of every gene in the
genome. This search provides us with a list of genes with
putative a1-α2 binding sites in the promoter, irrespective
of functionality.
Even under ideal conditions, either of the above lists of
genes would not directly indicate a haploid-specific gene
directly repressed by the a1-α2 complex. In addition, our
accuracy is limited by the noise in the microarray expression data, as well as by simplifying assumptions made to
utilize single-base mutational data to score arbitrary
sequences. We therefore decided to rank the genes using a
scoring system that takes into account expression patterns
across different mating types, as well as the likelihood of
finding a good a1-α2-binding site in the promoter region
of the gene. To test the significance of these composite
scores, we generated permuted data, which combined random promoters with the expression data. This analysis
suggested that the top 10–15 predictions were significant.
The results of experiments on the 24 genes with the highest combined scores from our analysis are shown in Table
1.

a1-α2 binding to the promoter regions of genes identified
in the search
To evaluate the success of our computational algorithm
for identifying direct targets of the a1-α2 repressor complex, we assayed binding by the complex to the identified
promoters using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays with polyclonal antibody directed against the α2
protein. In α haploid and a/α-diploid cells the α2 protein
combines with the MADS-box transcription factor Mcm1
to bind to elements in the promoters of a-specific genes to
repress their transcription [13,14]. We therefore included
in each PCR a primer set for the promoter region of the aspecific gene STE6 to serve as a positive control for the
ability to ChIP α2 in both haploid α and diploid a/α cells.
This primer set also allowed us to rule out the possibility
that the predicted a1-α2 target genes were immunoprecipitating because of binding by the α2-Mcm1 complex. The
primer set for the YDL223C promoter, a gene not bound
or repressed by the a1-α2 or α2-Mcm1 complexes, was
included in the reaction as a negative control for non-specific immunoprecipitation of the DNA. A gel displaying
the results for a few of the promoters that were assayed is
shown in Figure 1 and the data summarized for all the

promoters that were predicted to be directly repressed by
the a1-α2 complex is listed in Table 1. In general, there is
a very good correlation between the experimental data
with the predictions based on our computational algorithm. Almost all of the high scoring genes were bound by
the a1-α2 complex in vivo. Genes that had a combined pvalue higher than the threshold of 1.5 × 10-4 (which corresponds to choosing the top 15 of the list in Table 1) do
not appear to be strongly bound by the complex. This pvalue corresponds to roughly a probability of one in six
thousand, indicating it is possible to get such combination by chance.
In comparison to higher eukaryotes, most yeast promoters
are relatively small and contain activator or repressor
binding sites within several hundred base pairs of the start
site of the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene.
However, there are a few genes, like HO, whose regulation
is controlled by a region several Kb long. Consequently,
we did a separate search looking for additional a1-α2
binding sites that are within a region 1.5 Kb upstream of
the ORF. Most of the sites identified in this search were
well above the threshold value and were not bound by the

ChIP assays
ChIP assays of promoter fragments that are predicted to be targets of the a1-α2 complex. ChIP assays with antibody to the α2
protein were performed on lysates from MATa/MATα (a/α) and mata∆/MATα(∆/α) cells. Total chromatin (TC) and immunoprecipitated (IP) samples were subjected to multiplex PCR with primers flanking potential a1-α2 sites (labeled hsg) in the indicated promoters. Primers for the promoter region of STE6, an a-specific gene that is repressed by the α2-Mcm1 complex in
both cell types were used as a positive control for the ChIPs. Primers that hybridize in YDL223C, a gene that is not regulated by
α2, was used as the negative control. The presence of a band over background levels from the test promoter from a/α lysates
but not mat∆/α indicates that the a1-α2 complex is specifically binding to the promoter. Assays for the GPA1, FAR1, NEJ1,
RDH54, MET31, PDE1, AMN1/CST13 and KAR1 are shown. A summary of the all of the ChIPs performed is in Table 1.

a1-α2 complex in ChIP assays (data not shown). However, the search identified one site upstream of the AMN1/
CST13 gene that was a potential target site. The ChIP analysis verified this as a functional target site for the a1-α2
complex in vivo (Figure 1, Table 1).
Analysis of haploid-specific genes predicted not to be
bound by a1-α2
Among the top 35 genes in the list ranked by haploid-specific expression score, more than half do not appear to
contain an identifiable a1-α2 site by our analysis (lack of
a significant binding site being defined as binding p-value
greater than 2 × 10-4) (Table 2). Although there were no
apparent strong affinity a1-α2-binding sites in the promoters of these genes, it is possible that there are several
weak affinity sites in the promoter that were not identified
in the search. If present, these sites may work cooperatively to increase binding by the a1-α2 complex to the
promoter and therefore repress transcription. In support
of this model we have found that under some conditions
weak affinity a1-α2 sites in the HO promoter have a role
in repression of the promoter (Mathias and Vershon,
unpublished). Promoters with a number of weak affinity

sites may therefore be directly regulated by the a1-α2 complex. However, it is also possible that these genes are indirectly repressed by a1-α2, through its ability to repress
expression of another transcription factor that is required
for expression of the genes identified in the microarray. To
distinguish between these possibilities we assayed for a1α2 binding to these promoters by ChIP (Figure 2 and
Table 2). As predicted from the site identification analysis,
the a1-α2 complex did not appear to bind to most of these
promoters. This result suggests that these genes are not
directly repressed by the complex. The one exception to
our predictions was that the a1-α2 complex appeared to
weakly bind to the NEM1 promoter in the ChIP assays
(Figure 2). Interestingly, NEM1 is downstream of GPA1, a
gene that is strongly repressed by the a1-α2 complex (Fig
1). Binding and repression by a1-α2 at GPA1 may help
binding to weak sites in the NEM1 promoter. Alternatively, although we sheared the DNA used in the ChIP to
an average of less than 500 bp, it is possible that there may
have been some fragments that spanned the ~2 kb
between the genes, thereby giving a positive result in the
ChIP assay.

Comparison with binding site identification by the weight
matrix method
We compare the performance of our algorithm with that
of the weight matrix method [15-18]. In our study, we
derived our parameters from a set of artificial sequences.
Usually, the weight matrix has to be constructed from a set
of known sites. We calculate the weight matrix for a1-α2
from regulatory elements upstream several known target
genes: HO, GPA1, FUS3, AXL1, STE5, RME1 and MATα1.
As usual, one is faced with a choice of threshold weight
matrix score for selecting putative sites in the yeast
genome. For a stringent threshold that corresponds to the
top 16 targets, we recovered all the genes, other than
RME1, used in construction of the weight matrix. However, we did not recover most of the other genuine targets
identified, and verified, in this study. If we set the threshold to be lax enough to include RME1, we obtained 55
candidate genes, including STE18 and RDH54, but still
miss targets like STE4. It is likely that most of the 55 putative targets are false positives, as evidenced by lack of haploid-specific regulation in the corresponding gene
expression data.

Analysis of all potential a1-α2 target sites in the genome
Among the genes identified in the computational analysis, there is a good correlation between the presence of
strong a1-α2-binding sites in their promoter region and
repression in diploid cells. This raises the question of
whether all a1-α2-binding sites function as repressor sites.
To address this question we searched for all potential
binding sites in the yeast genome. As expected, many of
the best sites are in the promoters of known or previously
identified haploid-specific genes (Table 1). However, we
also identified a number of putative a1-α2-binding sites
within ORFs (Table 3). To test if the a1-α2 complex is able
to bind to these sites we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with purified α2 and a1 proteins
and radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing these sites
(Fig 3A). The a1-α2 complex bound to sites from the
YKL162C, CDC25, PRM8, PRM9, and URB1 ORFs with
weaker affinity than to a strong binding site from the HO
promoter, HO(10). However, these sites did have slightly
better binding affinity than to the HO(8) site, which we
have shown is unable to repress transcription on its own
(Mathias and Vershon, unpublished).

Overall, we find our method to be more successful than
the weight matrix method. The use of mutational data as
opposed to literature based data for sequence preference
possibly accounts for part of the success (an advantage we
may not have for some other transcription factors). However, much of our success has to do with cutting down of
false positive rates by using microarray data judiciously.

Since the a1-α2 complex was able to bind to these sites
with weak to moderate affinity in vitro, it is possible these
sites may partially repress transcription on their own. To
test this model, we cloned these sites into the context of
the CYC1 promoter driving expression of a lacZ gene and
measured the ability of the sites to repress transcription of
the reporter in diploid cells [9]. The sites from the CDC25
and URB1 ORFs did not repress transcription of the
reporter promoter in diploid cells (Fig 3A). However, the

a1-α2 binding site from the HO promoter, HO(8) (lanes 19–23), PRM8 (lanes 24–28), PRM9 (lanes 29–33) and URB1 (lanes 34–
38). The concentration of the a1 protein was held constant at 1.4 × 10-6 M (lanes 2 and 4–38) and mixed with 5-fold dilutions
of the α2 protein starting at 8.2 × 10-8 M (lanes 3, 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29 and 34)). The EMSAs shown are phosphorimages of the
gels. Lane 1 contains HO(10) probe alone, and lanes 2 and 3 contain 1.4 × 10-6 M a1 and 8.2 × 10-8 M α2 respectively. The fold
repression by each site in the context of a heterologous promoter is shown below each gene/promoter. (B) ChIP assays for

site from PRM8 ORF, which showed the highest binding
affinity among the sites found in ORF regions, weakly
(2.8-fold) repressed the reporter promoter. This result
indicates that this site can function as a repressor site in
vivo if placed in the proper context. We next tested
whether a1-α2 bound to these sites in the normal
genomic context in vivo by ChIP assays. None of the sites
in the ORF regions were bound by the a1-α2 complex (Fig
3B and Table 3). This result indicates that while they are
competent for weak binding and repression in a
heterologous promoter, they are unable to repress transcription in their normal genomic context.
Our search also identified several potential a1-α2 binding
sites in the promoter regions of genes that do not appear

to be repressed in diploid cells (Table 4). Only the COX13
site had moderate binding affinity for the a1-α2 complex
in the EMSAs (Fig 4A). However, despite the relatively
weak binding affinity of these sites, they were able to partially repress transcription of the reporter in diploid cells
(Fig 4A). In particular, the sites from the COX13 and REX2
promoters showed significant levels of repression. Interestingly, although these sites functioned as repressor sites
in the context of the heterologous reporter, except for the
COX13 promoter, most of these sites were not bound by
the a1-α2 complex at their genomic locations by ChIP
assays (Fig 4B). These results suggest that the genomic
context of most of these a1-α2 sites prevents binding by
the complex.

Discussion
Genome-wide gene expression data using SAGE or DNA
microarrays has provided a wealth of information on the
regulation of genes under certain conditions or by specific
transcription factors. The combination of this information with sequence analysis programs has enabled
researchers to identify potential regulatory sites. For example, in a pioneering paper, Tavazoie et al. clustered expression data and used multiple local sequence alignment
algorithms on the promoter regions of the co-clustered
genes to discover regulatory motifs [19]. This approach
has been further refined by using Bayesian networks to
incorporate additional constraints regarding relative positions and the orientations of the motifs [20]. Another
approach has been to break the genes into modules and
perform module assignments and motif searches at the
same time via an expectation maximization algorithm (as
opposed to clustering first and finding motifs later)
[21,22]. Although these approaches have worked well at
identifying potential targets sites one drawback is that the
expression patterns have to cluster well for these methods
to work. For a small number of microarray experiments,
this may always not be the case. A method that does not
utilize clustering is a regression model based analysis to
locate "words" in the promoter that correlates with modulation of expression [23]. However, this approach is
restricted to retrieving functional consensus binding sites
in the promoter regions and for transcription factors with
low sequence specificity, this approach needs to be modified. Most of these approaches attack the difficult problem
of what to do when relatively little is known about the regulatory system and sequence recognition by the protein.
Consequently they develop pattern recognition algorithms that are essentially unsupervised. Our focus has

been to take advantage, as much as possible, of knowledge
about the biological system and use that information
combined with expression analysis to identify potential
target sites. The minor loss of generality of the tools resulting from such an approach is more than offset by its predictive power.
To determine if the changes in expression of a specific
gene are the result of a transcription factor working at the
promoter we developed an algorithm that combines
expression data with information on the binding site preference for a transcription factor. As a test for this algorithm we identified genes in yeast that are direct targets for
regulation by the a1-α2 repressor complex. We also used
this method to identify genes that are repressed in diploid
cells but that are not direct targets of the complex, as well
as functional a1-α2 binding sites that do not appear to
repress transcription in their genomic context. The combination of these sets of findings has provided insight into
the regulatory network and mechanism of repression by
the a1-α2 complex.
The primary goal of this study was to identify genes that
are direct targets for repression by the a1-α2 complex.
There are two major functional subsets among the a1-α2
target genes identified in this analysis (Table 1). One, not
surprisingly, involves genes that are required for various
processes in mating of the two haploid cell-types. These
include components of the mating pheromone signal
transduction pathway, such as GPA1, STE18, STE4, and
STE5, which are activated in response to the binding of
pheromone from the other cell type [24]. This group also
includes genes further down that pathway, such as FAR1
and FUS3, which are required for cell-cycle arrest before

COX13 (lanes 8–11), REX2 (lanes 12–15), LSM1 (lanes 16–19) and FMP14 (lanes 20–23). The concentration of the a1 protein
was held constant at 1.4 × 10-6 M (lanes 2 and 4–23) and mixed with 5-fold dilutions of the α2 protein starting at 8.2 × 10-8 M
(lanes 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20). The EMSAs shown are phosphorimages of the gels. Lane 1 contains HO(6) probe alone, and lanes
2 and 3 contain 1.4 × 10-6 M a1 and 8.2 × 10-8 M α2 respectively. The fold repression by each site in the context of a heterologous promoter is shown. (B) ChIP assays for COX13, REX2, LSM1 and FMP14 were performed as described in Figure 1.

mating. A number of these genes have previously been
shown or suspected to be under the control of a1-α2
repressor complex [25,26]. Repression of these genes in
diploid cells is biologically important because it prevents
further mating by diploid cells. If diploid cells mate they
would form triploids or higher ordered genomic polyploids, which are genetically unstable during meiosis and
therefore detrimental to cell survival.
The second subset of genes identified in the analysis is
associated with mating type switching and recombina-

tion. The HO gene is a known target of the a1-α2 complex
and its promoter contains 10 binding sites of varying
affinity [25]. Repression of HO is essential in diploid cells
because it prevents switching of one of the MAT loci to
form homozygous a/a or α/α diploid cells. Although diploid in genomic content, cells homozygous for the MAT
loci are competent to mate and therefore would form
higher order genomic polyploids that are genetically
unstable. We have also shown that NEJ1, which is
involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), is a
direct target for the a1-α2 complex [27,28]. It has been

Page 9 of 15

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:59

proposed that that repression of the NHEJ pathway may
promote homologous recombination and crossing over
in diploid cells. In addition, we found that RDH54, a gene
involved in double-stranded DNA break repair, is a direct
target for the a1-α2 complex [29]. This result is somewhat
unexpected because RDH54 is required for meiosis and
null mutants show significantly reduced spore viability. It
is likely that the a1-α2 complex only partially reduces the
level of expression of the gene and that diploid cells
require a lower level of activity of the protein.
We also identified several genes that fell outside of these
two subsets. One is RME1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor of IME1, the master regulator of meiosis
[30-32]. a1-α2-mediated repression of RME1 is required
to allow cells to enter the meiotic pathway in diploid cells.
Interestingly, we also found that PDE1 and MET31 are
weakly, but reproducibly, direct targets for repression by
the a1-α2 complex. The Pde1 protein is a low affinity
cAMP phosphodiesterase that appears to have a role in
response to stress and cell aging [33]. Repression of PDE1
in diploids may partially account for the difference of starvation response between haploids and diploids. Met31 is
a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that activates genes
involved in sulfur metabolism [34]. It is unclear why this
gene would be a target for the a1-α2 complex.
It is possible that the presence of an a1-α2 target site
upstream of a gene that has lower expression in diploid
cells was fortuitous and that these sites were not functional targets. However, if this was the case then there
would be little pressure to conserve these binding sites
through evolution. Several closely related species of yeast
have been sequenced and comparison of the corresponding promoter regions has led to the discovery of conserved
regulatory motifs [35,36]. Although lack of conservation
does not imply non-functionality, significant conservation strongly argues for functionality of a putative regulatory element. To investigate this possibility, we performed
a phylogenetic comparison to infer whether these sites are
preserved among six sequenced Saccharomyces species
using the PhyloGibbs program [37]. The program identified the a1-α2 binding site among a promoter set including many known haploid-specific genes (HO, NEJ1,
GPA1, STE4, and STE18). This analysis also showed that
the a1-α2 binding sites in the RDH54, PDE1and MET31
promoters are strongly conserved among multiple species,
suggesting that these sites play an important functional
role.
Our analysis identified a number of haploid-specific
genes that do not appear to be direct targets of the a1-α2
repressor complex (Table 2). Genes in this list do not contain a recognizable a1-α2-binding site and, with the
exception of NEM1, are not detectably bound by the a1-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/59

α2 complex in the ChIP assays. It is possible that a1-α2
indirectly turns off these genes by repressing an activator
protein that is required for their expression. However,
besides MET31, there were no obvious genes coding for
activator proteins that were direct targets of the a1-α2
complex. It is possible that the haploid-specific genes
without a1-α2 sites are indirectly repressed through more
complex mechanisms that involve repression of RME1.
We also identified potential a1-α2-binding sites in the
genome that do not appear to repress expression of nearby
genes. Although sites from the PRM8, PRM9, CDC25, and
LSM1 promoters appear to be moderate binding sites for
the a1-α2 complex in vitro, ChIP and heterologous
reporter assays showed these sites are neither bound by
the proteins nor are functional repressor sites in vivo.
Many of these sites lie in open reading frames of actively
transcribed genes and so it is possible that transcription
through the binding site or the chromatin structure of the
region prevents high affinity binding by the complex. The
model that the genomic context of these sites is important
for their regulatory activity is further supported by our
results that show that some of these sites, such as COX13
and REX2, function as strong a1-α2 dependent repressor
sites in the context of the heterologous promoter.
Although a1-α2 complex is bound to the COX13 site in
vivo it does not appear to repress transcription of this gene
in diploid cell. Interestingly, this binding site is very close
to the end of the coding region of IME4, an inducer of
meiosis that is expressed in diploid cells [38]. The IME4
gene is only expressed in diploid cells and it was thought
that the a1-α2 complex may be indirectly activating its
expression by repressing a repressor protein, such as
RME1. However, the fact that a1-α2 binds to the
downstream region of this gene suggests that it may play
a direct role in its expression.
Our data shows that the algorithm we have developed is
useful in sorting between direct and indirect targets of a
transcription factor. Although we have used mutational
data to define the binding site for the a1-α2 complex, in
principal binding site sequences derived from site selection experiments may also be used. This analysis may also
complement genome-wide ChIP studies to identify the
target sites of the transcription factor.

Conclusions
In summary, we show that combining microarray data
with motif analysis, lets us distinguish between the genes
that are direct targets of a transcription factor and those
that are modulated because of secondary effects. We get
excellent agreement of the computational predictions
with location analysis by ChIP experiments. We find most
of the direct targets of a1/α2 complex to be involved in the
mating pathway, mating type switching, recombination

and meiosis. We also found a few weak targets that are
possibly involved in sensing and control of the metabolic
state. We also see that the sites we predict solely based on
single species data are often evolutionarily conserved in
other species of Saccharomyces.

Methods
Combined scoring of genes from microarray data and
mutational analysis
We define a scoring algorithm that ranks gene expression
patterns. For gene g, the score is given in terms of the
expression in different types of cells (a, α and a/α)

Score(g) = sgn((Xa(g) + Xα(g))/2 - Xa/α(g)) [(Xa(g)) +
Xα(g))/2 - Xa/α(g)]2 - A(Xa(g) - Xα(g))2.
We initially used the logarithm of expression level of the
gene g for the three cell types for the variables Xt(g) with t
indicating the type. We have since found that using the
complete expression data for the polyploids is a better
strategy. In the final results, shown in the paper, Xa(g) is
the average of the log expression for a, aa and aaa. Likewise, Xα (g) is the average from α, αα and ααα. Xa/α(g)
comes from averaging log expression over aaα, aαα and
aaαα. The polyploid averaged quantities tend to be less
noisy (demonstrated, for example, by the quantities Xa
and Xα being close to each other for the generic gene,
which is not regulated by cell type. This, in turn, allows
easier detection of genuine haploid-specific targets.
An explanation of the purpose served by different terms in
the overall score is described below. The first term scores
well when expression in diploids is lower than the average
expression in haploids. The second term penalizes the
gene if the expressions in different types of haploids are
very different. A is chosen to be large enough so that
known a-specific genes and α-specific genes score worse
than known haploid-specific genes, but not large enough
to overwhelm the first term. The optimal A is about 10.
Comparison of the performance of our algorithm for A =
1 and A = 10, shows that the biologically known sites
almost always stay near the top but further down in the
list the second choice is better. The exception is a special
gene: MATα1. Since MATα1 is not present in the MATa
type cell, there is a penalty for expression patterns. Cumulative probability for any gene to have higher score than a
gene g is Pexprn(g), namely, fraction of genes with score
higher than g.
This scoring function would rank haploid-specific genes
high but may not select out genes that are directly regulated by the a1-α2 repressor complex. In order to select for
genes with an upstream region with a strong a1-α2 repressor, we used the binding site mutational data available
[9]. In these experiments, repression of a heterologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/59

promoter, incorporating single site mutations of a consensus binding site of the a1-α2 repressor, was measured.
Under the assumption that the degree of repression is
inversely proportional to how often that site is occupied,
we derived the expression: 1/Repression ∝ [1 - 1/(1 +
eβE(S)/z)] ≈ eβE(S)/z assuming near saturation of binding.
The symbol z represents the fugacity and β is inverse of
kBT, kB being the boltzman constant. The binding (free)
energy is given by E(S) = ΣibεibSib, within the single base
model [15,16]. The index i runs over the positions in the
motif and b runs over the bases A, C, G, T.Sib is 1 or 0
depending upon whether the i-th base is b or not. The
parameters εib represent effects of single base changes on
the binding (free) energy. They are related to the weight
matrix parameters [17,18] widely used to characterized
variable motifs. Note that eβE(S)/z would more commonly
be represented as (K/ [Protein])•exp(∆G(S)/RT) in the
biochemistry literature [18,39]. The independent base
model is only an approximation and mutations in nearest
neighbor sites could produce effects that we cannot estimate from the existing data. There is a better separation
between well-known sites and generic sequences if an
extra penalty is added to the score for neighboring base
pairs which both differ from the consensus. In this way
every base different from consensus and neighboring
another base different from consensus draws an additional penalty to the binding energy score. This parameter
was set to be ln(2), by experience. Although this method
prevented many false positives, it also penalized a few
genuine candidates, such as the binding sites in the promoters of FAR1 and MATα1. Thus, from the effect of the
single base mutations, we estimated the parameters εib.
Armed with these parameters, we found the probability
P(E|ε, L) that a random sequence of a certain length, L,
would have a subsequence of binding energy greater than
E. For gene g, the strongest site in the upstream region of
length L would have binding energy Eg. Low values of
Pbinding(g) = P(Eg|ε,L), indicated the presence of a good
binding site.
The genes were ordered according to the lowest value of a
combined p-value, Pexprn(g) Pbinding(g), and then ranked as
candidates for haploid-specific genes that are directly
repressed by the a1-α2 complex. One of the issues in such
studies is how to decide on how many of the top candidates are significant. This problem occurs even in solely,
sequence based analysis as well [40]. In our study, we generated random combinations of expression p-values with
scrambled binding p-values, so that we could choose a
cutoff threshold by comparing the ordered p-values with
the ordered "scrambled" p-values. Figure 5 plots these
sorted p-values against average (log) sorted p-values for
the random combinations. The comparison suggests that
only about 10–15 top candidates in the list are significant.

Weight matrix based search
A weight matrix [15-18] search for binding sites was performed using a set of known sites [9] to construct the
matrix. Each matrix entry, wia, was set to log((fia + δ)/(Pa +
δ)), where fia is the frequency with which base a appears in
the ith position in the known sites, Pa is the frequency
with which base a appears in the promoters of genes and
δ is a small number added to ensure that the weight
matrix score is finite even when fia = 0. Each subsequence,
Sia, of length 20 in each promoter was assigned a weight
matrix score Σia Sia wia. After a threshold score is chosen,
sites scoring above that threshold are declared to be binding sites.
Automated primer generation
An automated procedure for generating primers flanking
a specified site in the genome sequence, σ, was implemented. To each pair of numbers, du, and dd, representing
primer distances upstream and downstream of the candidate binding site respectively, and primer lengths lu, and
ld, a score is assigned via

S(du, dd, lu, ld,σ) = - Σaka(Pa(du, dd, lu, ld,σ) - P a )2
where the Pa are functions including the melting temperatures, distances of upstream and downstream primers
from the candidate site, total length of the bound region,
and the difference between the primer melting temperatures. The P a s are the preferred values of those functions.
The ka are adjusted to reflect the relative importance of the
parameters; for example it is more important that the difference in melting temperatures be close to zero than it is
that the distance to the upstream primer match the distance to the downstream primer.
Values of du, dd, lu and ld are restricted to those whose corresponding primers have GG, GC, CG, or CC at the end
nearest the candidate site. Primers are identified by selecting the values of du, dd, lu and ld which maximize S.

with cold 1XTBS. Equal volumes of cells were aliquoted
into ten 1.5 ml microfuge tubes, washed once with 1.5 ml
of cold 1X TBS. The pellets in each tube were resuspended
with 400 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate) plus 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1X
Protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche (Cat No.
1873580) and also manufacturer recommended concentration of protease inhibitor cocktail from SIGMA (Cat
No., P 8215). To this 200 µl of glass beads were added to
each tube and lysed using a multitube vortexer at full
speed for 30 min at 4°C. The lysate was transferred in a
new tube and 400 µl of lysis buffer was added and
vortexed briefly. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g
for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatants were sonicated at
30% output for four 10 sec cycles with intermittent cooling on ice.
The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 g for
10 min and 1 mM PMSF was added to the samples. A 1/
10th volume aliquot was removed and frozen to be used as
total chromatin control. The remaining sample was precleared by the addition of 25 µl recombinant protein Gagarose beads, incubated while nutating for 30 min and
the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at
12,000 for 5 min. 1 µl of rabbit anti-α2 antiserum (a gift
from A. Johnson, UCSF) was added to each supernatant of
the samples and incubated 12 h on a nutator at 4°C. To
immunopreciptiate α2 50 µl of recombinant protein G
agarose beads (Roche) was added to the samples and
nutated for 90 minutes at 4°C. The protein G beads were
pelleted, washed once in low salt buffer (0.1%SDS, 1%
Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris pH8.0, 2 mM EDTA and 150
mM NaCl), once in high salt (composition same as
lowsalt + 500 mM NaCl), once in LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl,
1% IGEPAL, 1XTE and 1% Na-Deoxycholate) and twice
with 1XTE (pH8.0). The immunoprecipitated DNA was
eluted twice with 250 µl of elution buffer (1%SDS and 0.1
M NaHCO3) and the eluates were pooled (500 µl final
volume). To this 20 µl of 5 M NaCl was added and incubated 12 h at 65°C. To remove the crosslinks, 10 µl of 0.5
M EDTA, 20 µl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 2 µl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 45 minutes at 45°C. The DNA samples were extracted once with
Phenol:chloroform:Isoamylalcohol and the DNA was ethanol precipitated, washed once with 70% ethanol and
resuspended in 50 µl (IP) or 500 µl (TC) TE.
Purified DNA from the immunoprecipitated samples was
subjected to multiplex PCR amplification with primers
specific for the STE6 promoter as a positive control for the
immunoprecipitation of α2 and the YDL223C ORF as a

YKL162C and CDC25 and the promoters of COX13,
REX2, LSM1, and FMP14 were synthesized, one strand
was end-labeled with [γ-32P]-ATP, and then annealed with
excess cold complementary oligonucleotide. The HO(10)
and HO(8) a1-α2 sites within Upstream Regulatory

β-galactosidase assays
Oligonucleotides containing a1-α2 binding sites were
synthesized with 5' overhangs to allow cloning into the
XhoI site of pTBA23 (2µ URA3 Ampr), a reporter plasmid
containing a CYC1-lacZ fusion [43]. Reporter constructs
were transformed into JRY103 and JRY118 and the βgalactosidase activity was measured on three independent
transformants, as described previously [14].
