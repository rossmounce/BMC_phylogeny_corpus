Abstract
Background: S-adenosylmethionine is a source of diverse chemical groups used in biosynthesis
and modification of virtually every class of biomolecules. The most notable reaction requiring Sadenosylmethionine, transfer of methyl group, is performed by a large class of enzymes, Sadenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, which have been the focus of considerable
structure-function studies. Evolutionary trajectories of these enzymes, and especially of other
classes of S-adenosylmethionine-binding proteins, nevertheless, remain poorly understood. We
addressed this issue by computational comparison of sequences and structures of various Sadenosylmethionine-binding proteins.
Results: Two widespread folds, Rossmann fold and TIM barrel, have been repeatedly used in
evolution for diverse types of S-adenosylmethionine conversion. There were also cases of
recruitment of other relatively common folds for S-adenosylmethionine binding. Several classes of
proteins have unique unrelated folds, specialized for just one type of chemistry and unified by the
theme of internal domain duplications. In several cases, functional divergence is evident, when
evolutionarily related enzymes have changed the mode of binding and the type of chemical
transformation of S-adenosylmethionine. There are also instances of functional convergence, when
biochemically similar processes are performed by drastically different classes of Sadenosylmethionine-binding proteins.
Comparison of remote sequence similarities and analysis of phyletic patterns suggests that the last
universal common ancestor of cellular life had between 10 and 20 S-adenosylmethionine-binding
proteins from at least 5 fold classes, providing for S-adenosylmethionine formation, polyamine
biosynthesis, and methylation of several substrates, including nucleic acids and peptide chain release
factor.
Conclusion: We have observed several novel relationships between families that were not known
to be related before, and defined 15 large superfamilies of SAM-binding proteins, at least 5 of which
may have been represented in the last common ancestor.

Background
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM or AdoMet) is a conjugate of
nucleotide adenosine and amino acid methionine, two

ubiquitous biological compounds that almost certainly
were present in the common ancestor of living cells and
may have been found in the prebiotic environment on

Earth, predating the origin of Life itself [1]. SAM is an
essential metabolic intermediate in every studied cellular
life form, and each cellular organism has several SAM-utilizing enzymes. One relatively well-understood biological
role of SAM is to donate methyl groups for covalent modification of different substrates â€“ from as simple as oxidized arsenic, chloride, bromide, and iodine ions [2-4], to
as complex as rRNA, tRNA, and essential proteins, whose
methylation status can serve as a regulatory signal for maturation and control interactions with other macromolecules ([5-7] and references therein).
Methyl transfer is but one of many biochemical processes
requiring SAM. Enzymatic reactions that involve interaction of proteins with SAM or its structurally similar derivatives include transfer or methylene, aminoalkyl, ribosyl,
and 5'deoxyadenosyl groups; formation of 5'deoxyadenosyl radical, which can be used as a redox intermediate in
many reactions; SAM decarboxylation; and de novo synthesis of SAM from adenosine and methionine. There are
also numerous interactions between SAM and non-enzymatic proteins, where SAM serves as a ligand triggering a
regulatory change in the effector protein.
Despite the interest in this amazing variety of functions
associated with SAM, and the known three-dimensional
structures for representatives of almost every class of SAMdependent enzymes, the structural, functional, and evolutionary relationships between the SAM-binding domains
remain not well understood. Do all or some of the SAMbinding proteins share common evolutionary ancestry?
How many distinct structural modes of interaction
between SAM and protein are there? Is there strong or
weak correlation between conservation of sequence and
structure, the mode of SAM binding, and the chemical
reaction facilitated by the enzyme? Finally, what may have
been the repertoire of SAM-binding proteins in the ancestral organisms â€“ in particular, in LUCA, the Last Universal
Common Ancestor of the three present-day domains of
Life â€“ Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya?
We sought to address these questions by comparing
sequences and structures of various groups of SAM-binding domains recognized in proteins. We describe several
previously unsuspected relationships between some of
such groups, predict novel members for many of them,
and conclude that LUCA may have had more than a dozen
of SAM-binding proteins, belonging to several distinct
folds.

Results and discussion
We have adopted the iterative comparison strategy, using
the known or suspected SAM-binding protein domains as
the queries in increasingly sensitive probabilistic methods
of sequence modeling and database searching. In many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

cases, a SAM-binding part of the protein constitutes only
part of the polypeptide chain. For example, methyltransferases typically consist of well-conserved SAM-binding
portions and highly variable substrate-binding regions,
sometimes further supplemented with portable domains
also found in otherwise unrelated proteins, such as
chromo domain interacting with methylated histone tails
in eukaryotes, or PUA domain that probably interacts
with RNA [8]. In this work, we are concerned with the protein moieties that bind SAM, so we neither examine these
other domains, not consider methyltransferases that utilize other sources of methyl groups, like folate or methylcobalamin derivatives. We did not describe
isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT), an
integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein with
unknown structure [9,10] (reviewed in ref. [11]).
The phylogenetic relationships inside of several recognized groups of SAM-binding proteins, especially within
Rossmann-fold SAM-dependent methyltransferases, have
been reviewed recently [12,13]. Although we summarize
and extend their observations, our main focus is on the
analysis of more distant, previously unexamined,
relationships.
Versatile Î±/Î² architectures adapted for SAM binding
Rossmanoids: ancient and ubiquitous SAM-dependent transferases
The majority of SAM-dependent methyltransferases
belong to a large class of enzymes with the Rossmann-like
fold, one of the more common arrangements of protein
spatial structure, observed in dozens of diverse families of
enzymes [14]. SAM-dependent methyltransferases are a
large group of enzymes within the Rossmanoid class, and
they account for a substantial fraction of all proteins in
completely sequenced genomes; for example, with 1.7%
of genes in Helicobacter pylori J99 coding for known or
predicted SAM-dependent methyltransferases, this group
makes the list of 10 most commonly used sequence and
structure families in that species [15].

In the most basic arrangement, the Rossmann-like fold
consists of alternating Î²-stranded and Î±-helical regions,
with all strands forming a central relatively planar Î²-sheet,
and helices filling two layers, one on each side of the
plane. As with many other Rossmann-like folds, the N-terminal Î²-strand of methyltransferases is located in the middle of the sheet, and the strand topology is 3214576, with
the 7th strand antiparallel to all other strands (Figure 1a).
Yet another typical feature of Rossmanoid enzymes is that
the functionally important, conserved residues are often
located in the C-termini of the Î²-strands or in the adjoining loops [14]. Some methyltransferases conform to this
plan quite well, with an occasional addition of an extra
helix or a Î²-hairpin [16], or, rarely, deletion of one or both

of strands 6 and 7 [17]. Most methyltransferases, however,
contain additional domains appended or inserted into the
basic Rossmann fold [16].
Notwithstanding the insertions of additional domains
and structural elaborations, comparative sequence analysis of the Rossmann-fold methyltransferases identifies the
set of five highly conserved regions of the SAM-binding
region, each centered on one or more nearly-invariant residues (Figure 2). They correspond to motifs I-V from
motifs initially proposed for DNA:m5C MTases by Posfai
et al. [18] (reviewed in refs. [12,19]), but some of the conserved residues highlighted in this work have not been
pointed out before (see below). Each motif has a clear
counterpart at the structural level. Five motifs are arranged
in the same linear order in almost all known methyltransferases, with a notable exception of several groups of
DNA- and RNA-methyltransferases, where circular permutation of the sequence results in a main chain fission after
motif II, while the spatial structure of the domain and
mode of SAM binding remain virtually unperturbed (discussed in more detail by Bujnicki [20]).
The first conserved sequence block (Motif I) includes in its
C-terminal part the consensus GxGxG, considered the
hallmark SAM-binding site of the Rossmann-fold SAMdependent methyltransferases. None of three glycine residues is universally conserved, but the replacements are
typically by the residues with small side chains, or with
propensity of bending the main chain. This agrees with
the structure data, indicating that the consensus is located
in a loop connecting the first Î²-strand and the Î±-helix in
the Rossmann fold core. The complete Î²-strand and part
of the preceding loop are also part of Motif I. In the middle of Î²-strand 1, there is an exceptionally well conserved
acidic residue (D or E); one or more conserved positively
charged residues are found close to the N-terminus of this
strand (Figure 2).
Motif II encompasses Î²-strand 2 and adjoining turn. A
partially conserved acidic residue is common at the C terminus of this strand. Motif III corresponds to Î²-strand 3,
located at the edge of the Î²-sheet in the Rossmann fold.
An acidic residue is partially conserved close to the C-terminus of this strand, too. Whenever the substrate (SAM),
its analogs, or reaction product (SAH) are co-crystallized,
they are found close to the invariant residues in Motifs IIII (Figure 2 and see below).
Motif IV consists of Î²-strand 4 and the flanking loops. In
this motif again, there is a well-preserved D/E/N residue,
located at the extreme N-terminus of the strand, i.e. at the
side of the fold that is not involved in substrate binding.
Motif V corresponds to the helix following the strand with
motif IV. In some Rossmann-fold methyltransferases, it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

serves as a scaffold for large hydrophobic or aromatic side
chains that stabilize the adenine moiety of AdoMet, but it
many cases it has been shows these residues are not essential for the MTase activity [21]. Finally, Motif VI corresponds to Strand 5 of the Î²-sheet, and the preceding tight
turn with a nearly-invariant glycine residue.
Several residues from Motifs I-V are known to make direct
contact with SAM. In particular, one or more residues in
"GxGxG" loop are in contact with the carboxypropyl moiety of SAM, while conserved acidic residue in Motif II
forms hydrogen bonds with the ribose hydroxyls (Figure
2; ref. [22]). Variable residues at the C-termini of strand 2
(Motif II) and conserved acidic residue in Strand 3 (Motif
III) interact with the nitrous base, while variable residues
C-terminal to Strand 4 (Motif IV) appear to contact the
amino and sulfonium groups of the methionine moiety of
SAM [22]. Residues from motif IV, VI, VIII, and sometimes
X are associated with the catalytic pocket, where residues
from motif V and VII are important mostly for the structural stability [19,23].
The roles of other conserved residues in SAM-dependent
methyltransferases are less well understood. Near-omnipresence of the D/E residue in Motif I suggests that it has
an important role. It has been noted [24], that in FtsJ RNA
methyltransferase this residue coordinates SAM through a
water molecule. In fact, in all 3-D structures of methyltransferases where solvent molecules are present (i.e. PDB
structure 1EJ0, 1KYW, and 2ADM), the oxygen atoms in
the carboxyl group of this D/E residue make direct contacts with two water molecules, one of which is capable of
forming a hydrogen bond with the side chain of methionine moiety of SAM. In some ribose 2'-O-MTases, D/E
amino acid conserved in motif I is substituted by tyrosine
(Figure 2 and ref. [25]), and it has been proposed that this
residue could be used to directly (not via the water molecule) coordinate the amino-carboxyl end of SAM (J.M.
Bujnicki, personal communication).
These observations are of interest for understanding the
mechanism of methyl transfer by Rossmann-fold methyltransferases. Two best-studied groups of transferases that
have Rossmann-like fold and use a nucleotide derivative
as a cofactor, namely ATPase-like kinases and nucleoside
diphospho-sugar transferases, appear to require a divalent
metal cation for polarization of water molecule that can
then attack a scissile phosphoester bond [26-29]. Methyltransferases, on the other hand, need to work on a C-S+
bond in SAM, but do not seem to have any metal ion
bound in the appropriate position (even though divalent
cations have been included in some crystallization
media). The proposals for reaction mechanisms of different classes of SAM-dependent methyltransferases include
nucleophilic catalysis, with the identity of nucleophile

Figure sequence alignment of Rossmann-fold methyltransferases and nicotianamine synthase
Multiple2
Multiple sequence alignment of Rossmann-fold methyltransferases and nicotianamine synthase. Sequences are
denoted by NCBI gi number, short protein name (when available, otherwise COG/KOG/Pfam number was used), and abbreviated species name (as in UniProt Knowledgebase [140]). Nicotianamine synthase is marked by a blue box. Conserved motifs
are labeled above the alignment. Conserved residues are marked by asterisk. Consensus positions of the secondary structure
elements are shown above the alignment. Numbers in parentheses indicate number of residues omitted for clarity. Residues
are highlighted according to the amino acid properties. Gray shading indicates conservation of single residue. Red font indicates conservation of acidic residues (D, E). Cyan font indicates conservation of Ser/Thr (S, T). Blue gray font with yellow
shading indicates conservation of aliphatic residues (I, L, V). Dark blue font indicates conservation of basic residues (H, K,
and R). Green font indicates conservation of tiny residues (A, G, and S). Blue font with yellow shading indicates conservation of aromatic residues (F, H, W, and Y). Pink font indicates conservation of charged residues (D, E, H, K, and R). Dark
green font indicates conservation of small residues (A, C, D, G, N, P, S, T, and V). Bright blue font indicates conservation
of polar residues (C, D, E, H, K, N, Q, R, S, and T). Blue font with pale yellow shading indicates conservation of big residues (E, F, H, I, K, L, M, Q, R, W, and Y). Black font with yellow shading indicates conservation of hydrophobic residues (A,
C, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, V, W, and Y).

ranging from moderately conserved residues scattered
across the SAM-binding domain to bound water molecule
[30], as well as SN2 reaction, which would require initiation by concerted action of several side chains, or, perhaps, by the amino group of the substrate itself [31]. The
highly conserved D/E residue in motif I may, however,
provide a unifying theme in the catalysis, by polarizing a
water molecule that is close to the methyl group of SAM.
The water molecule could either serve as a nucleophile, or
aid bond displacement between the sulfonium ion and
methyl group in some other way.
Finally, we noticed that the conserved basic residue at the
beginning of Motif I and nearly-invariant acidic residue at
the beginning of motif IV are typically located within a
short distance (3Ã… or less) of each other, potentially forming a salt bridge that may be important for locking other
elements of the Rossmann fold in place (Figure 2).

Rossmann-fold SAM-binding proteins that do not have
methyltransferase activity
I. Methylene transferases
Formation of the cyclopropane ring in unsaturated fatty
acids by cyclopropane fatty acid synthase [EC: 2.1.1.79]
has been studied extensively in bacteria. The reaction
involves transfer of a methylene group from SAM to the
double bond of an unsaturated acyl chain [13,32].

Crystal structures of mycolic acid cyclopropane synthases
CmaA1, CmaA2, PcaA, and MmaA2 have fold similar to
Rossmann-fold methyltransferases (Figure 1b), with the
conserved position of SAM and very similar pattern of
interactions with the cofactor [32]. A hallmark of methylene transferases is the presence of the carbonate ion (CO3
2-) at the active center, which probably enables the formation of carbocation intermediate required for completion
of the reaction (Figure 3) and ref. [32]. Conserved residues
involved in carbonate ion binding (Cys35/Ser, His167/
Gln, and Tyr232/Phe â€“ numbered as in PDB structure

1L1E) appear to distinguish methylene transferases from
Rossmann-fold methyltransferases.
II. Amino alkyl transferases: nicotianamine synthase and spermidine
synthase
Nicotianamine synthase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine: Sadenosyl-L-methionine: S-adenosyl-L-methionine 3amino-3-carboxypropyltransferase, EC: 2.5.1.43) catalyses direct condensation of three molecules of SAM, followed by the formation of an acetidine ring, to yield one
molecule of nicotianamine, a chelator of various transition metals ubiquitously present in higher plants. In
graminaceous plants, nicotianamine is the precursor of
phytosiderophores that are secreted from the roots to solubilize ferric iron in the soil. Reduced levels of endogenous nicotianamine affect the development of plant
reproductive organs and seeds' maturation [33].

Protein structure of nicotianamine synthase is not known,
but sequence similarity searches indicate a significant similarity between nicotianamine synthase and Rossmannfold methyltransferases. A PSI-BLAST search, using with
Arabidopsis thaliana NAS [GenBank:O80483] as a query,
matched Pseudomonas syringae ubiE/COQ5 methyltransferase [GenBank:YP_233497] with E-value = 1e-21 and
score = 105 at 4th iteration; PDBBLAST top match is to
(N5)-Glutamine Methyltransferase [PDB:1T43]. Similarity is the highest in conserved motifs II-IV and VI (Figure
2), and motif I is also conserved, in a modified form (F-xG-S-G-P-x-P). Interestingly, related sequences with the
same modification of Motif 1 are found in archaea (Methanothermobacter
thermautotrophicus,
[GenBank:NP_275817], bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
[GenBank:NP_253523], and fungi (Neurospora crassa,
[GenBank:XP_330777]. The replacement of the conserved
D/E/N residue in motif I (see above) may partially explain
the change in the functional group that is transferred from
SAM: unlike the related Rossmann-fold methyltransferases, nicotianamine synthases lack negatively charged
residue in Motif I, so the aminoalkyl moiety of SAM is not
bridged to the enzyme by a water molecule and is free to
leave in the course of the reaction.
Spermidine synthase (EC: 2.5.1.16) catalyzes the transfer
of the aminopropyl group from decarboxylated SAM to
putrescine to form spermidine. Putrescine, spermidine
and spermine, formed from spermidine, are polyamines
essential for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in most species, and gram-negative bacteria
outer membrane permeability in response to the acid
stress [34,35]. Spermidine synthase is an oligomeric
enzyme, each monomer consisting of a C-terminal
domain with a Rossmann-like fold and an N-terminal
tetramerization Î²-stranded domain [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

Spermidine synthase has very high sequence similarity
(approx. 70% identity) to putrescine N-methyltransferase.
It has been shown that aminopropyl moiety of spermidine synthase inhibitor â€“ AdoDATO (a compound containing both substrate and product moieties) binds in a
similar orientation to the homologous part of SAM in
Rossmann-fold methyltransferases. However, the binding
site in spermidine synthase contains invariant residue
Asp101 (PDB structure 1JQ3), located in the middle of
glycine-rich loop (corresponding to motif I of Rossmannfold methyltransferases) making binding cavity too small
to accommodate the carboxyl group of SAM, that prevents
SAM binding and enables specific binding of decarboxylated SAM [36]. The polyamine moiety of AdoDATO is
oriented toward putrescine binding cleft. Invariant
Asp170 (corresponding to D/N residue located at the end
of Î²-sheet in motif-IV of Rossmann-fold methyltransferases) is most likely candidate to deprotonate
putrescine, enabling it to perform a nucleophilic attack on
methylene carbon of decarboxylated SAM [36].
III. Acalcynomycin-10-hydroxylase
Aclacinomycin 10-hydroxylase RdmB is a methyltransferase homolog that catalyses a SAM-dependent hydroxylation of the C-10 carbon atom of 15-demethoxy-Îµrhodomycin, a step in the biosynthesis of the polyketide
antibiotic Î²-rhodomycin. In order to activate molecular
oxygen, the enzyme uses SAM instead of cofactors usually
associated with hydroxylase activity, such as flavins, 2oxoglutarate, or metal ions. It has been proposed that positive charge of the SAM cofactor plays a role in delocalisation of electrons into the anthraquinone core of the
substrate [37]. The C-terminal domain of RdmB has an Î±/
Î² Rossmann-like fold, and contains the conserved signature DLGGGxG in motif I.

The enzyme lacks methyltransferase activity due to the
positioning of SAM in which the methyl group points in a
direction unfavorable for a SN2 type methyl transfer to the
substrate [37]. The difference in SAM-substrate positioning is not well understood, but might be related to differential interactions between SAM binding C-terminal
domain and substrate binding N-terminal domain or differences in the conserved loop (amino acids 292â€“298)
[37].
Non-catalytic Rossmannoids
The lack of detectable SAM binding motifs in several Rossmann-fold methyltransferases suggests that they may be
recruited for a new function. For example, the threedimensional structure of sc-mtTFB (Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial transcription factor B) bears strong
resemblance to ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases (i.e.
KsgA and ErmC'). However, several residues required for
interaction with SAM are not conserved in sc-mtTFB; in

Page 7 of 26

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:19

particular, the glycine-rich loop (motif I) contains bulky
Tyr residue, and motif IV is poorly conserved.
Human co-orthologs of sc-mtTFB (h-mtTFB1 and hmtTFB2) have rRNA N6-adenine methyltransferase activity (in an Escherichia. coli assay), but mutational analysis
of h-mtTFB1 indicates that this activity is not required for
transcriptional activation [38].
In Gcd10p/Gcd14p complex â€“ tRNA(1-methyladenosine)
methyltransferase of S. cerevisiae, the lack of SAM binding
was observed in Gcd10p that directs binding of tRNA,
where Gcd14p binds the required cofactor S-adenosylmethionine [39,40].
In another case, Kar4p (pheromone induced, karyogamyspecific transcription factor) does not bind SAM, where
similar (circularly permuted) Ime4p is SAM-binding
methyltransferase [41].
In bacterial rRNA:m2G methyltransferases RsmC and
RsmD the inactivated domain and the catalytic domain
are fused together in one polypeptide [42].
The de novo methyltransferase-like protein, DNMT3L, is
required for methylation of imprinted genes in germ cells.
Although enzymatically inactive, human DNMT3L accelerates DNA and SAM binding to de novo DNA methyltransferases [43-45].
Rossmann-like domain of bacterial fluorinating enzyme
Actinomycete Streptomyces cattleya is able to produce CF bonds using inorganic fluoride. The fluorinating activity
requires SAM, and the primary product of the reaction is
SAM derivative, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine [46]. The
protein, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine synthase FlA,
belongs to a conserved sequence family represented in
most archaea and in a subset of bacteria [46].

The structure of FlA consists of two domains â€“ a larger Nterminal domain with Î±/Î² fold, and a smaller C-terminal
Î²-barrel. Both domains interact with SAM and with reaction products [46]. FlA is a hexamer in solution and trimer
in crystal, and three SAM molecules are bound by a trimer,
between the N-terminal domain of one subunit and the
C-terminal domain of the adjoining subunit. This
arrangement, however, appears to be dependent on a long
(24 amino acids) loop in the N-terminal domain, which
is missing from the closely related sequences in all other
species. On the other hand, the linker connecting two
domains in a monomer is long enough to allow significant domain motions, and it is plausible that two
domains may interact in other oligomeric arrangements
and perhaps even within a monomer. Therefore, we speculate that SAM binding by FlA-like proteins from other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

species may occur in the crevice formed by the N- and Cterminal domains of the same molecule, and the following discussion does not consider the oligomerization
state.
The N-terminal domain makes contacts mostly with
methionine, ribose, and fluoride ion, and C-terminal
domain contacts methionine and adenine ring. The Î±/Î²
N-terminal domain exhibits several features similar to
other enzymatic domains with Rossmann-like topology,
namely: three-layer Î±/Î²/Î± architecture; the planar central,
mostly parallel Î²-sheet filling "inside-out" (strand topology 2135467), and concentration of the substrate-binding
and catalytic residues in the loops following the C-termini
of strands. More specifically, the loop after strand 1 contains Asp16 (numbered as in PDB structure 1RQP) hydrogen-bonded to both hydroxyls of ribose, Leu17 that may
be involved in water-mediated interaction with methionine amino group, Asp21 and Ser23, both of which can
form hydrogen bonds with the same amino group. Loop
following strand 2 contains Trp50 that is able to contact
one ribose hydroxyl and perhaps to have Van der Waals
interactions with the adenine ring. Loop between strands
3 and 4 contain two ribose interactors, Thr76 and Tyr77.
Loop after strand 6 hosts Thr155, which is part of hydrogen-bond network linking two domains via two water
molecules and methionine carboxyl group, as well as catalytic Ser158 that is expected to make two polar contacts
with deprotonated fluoride ion [46]. Although most of
these interactions are provided by residues located in
loops at the edge of Î²-sheet, there is no specific sequence
similarity between Rossmann-like domain in fluorination
enzyme and in Rossmann-fold methyltransferases. There
is also no similarity to other SAM-utilizing enzymes.
Rossmann-like fold in SPOUT methyltransferases?
A distinct superfamily of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, SPOUT, which includes families specified by bacterial SpoU, TrmD, and TrmH, proteins, as well as many
uncharacterized proteins in all three domains of Life, have
been shown to share a set of conserved sequence elements
and an Î±/Î²-type fold [47]. Trm10, a recently characterized
tRNA m1G9 methyltransferase, is also predicted to have
this fold [48,49]. All experimentally characterized members of this large superfamily are DNA or RNA methyltransferases. A unique structural feature of this Î±/Î² fold is
a trefoil knot of two crossing loops in the C-terminal
region [47].

Several hallmarks of Rossmann-like structure are evident
in the SPOUT fold. There are three main layers, with a central Î²-sheet sandwiched between two helical layers; the Î²sheet is formed "inside-out", with the first and one of the
last strands in the center of the sheet; and the SAM ligand
interacts mostly with the conserved residues located in the

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:19

loops at the C-termini of Î²-strands [50]. There is, however,
no
sequence
similarity
between
SPOUT-fold
methyltransferase and any other Rossmann-fold SAMbinding protein.
Structural similarity between SPOUT-fold and Rossmannfold methyltransferases (i.e. DALI Z-score = 3.1 for 88 aa
with RMSD = 3.7 and sequence identity = 17% for PDB
structures 1QAO and 1MXI) is confined mainly to the Nterminal half of those folds. There is no similarity in the
C-terminal part, where strands 4 and 5 are rearranged.
SAM binding inside and outside of Î²-barrels
SAM-radical enzymes: recruitment of ancient enzymatic TIM barrel
A (Î²/Î±)8 fold, also known as triose phosphate isomerase
(TIM)-like barrel, is one of the largest classes of protein
structures, exceeding even Rossmann-like fold in omnipresence and versatility [51]. Most of TIM-barrel proteins
are enzymes, belonging to almost all of the major EC
classes [52]. A well-known version of a TIM barrel is a (Î²/
Î±)6 "semi-barrel," in which the inner layer of slanted Î²strands does not form a complete cylinder, but has a lateral opening (PDB structure 1OLT).

Recently, several structures of proteins from a large
sequence family of "SAM radical" enzymes (ref. [53]; Figure 1g) have been determined, and it became evident that
members of this family have (Î²/Î±)6 and (Î²/Î±)8 folds.
SAM-radical enzymes utilize non-covalently linked Fe-S
cluster and a SAM molecule, in a reductive cleavage reaction that produces methionine and 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, that can be used to generate further glycyl or thiyl
radicals on the same protein molecule or on a coupled
enzyme [54]. It has been noted that SAM-radical sequence
family is very large, diverse, but can be recognized by a
hallmark CxxxCxxC signature close to the N-terminus, followed by another conserved "GG" motif [55].
We detected more than 2000 non-redundant sequences
from SAM-radical family in the sequence databases. Interestingly, when the region containing the three characteristic cysteines was deleted from the queries, the searches
resulted in almost the same collection of sequences as
with full-length domain, indicating strong evolutionary
signal along the stretch of 200â€“250 residues to the C-terminal side of the CxxxCxxC signature. Multiple alignment
of many representative sequences identified four regions
with high sequence similarity and three weaker conserved
motifs (Figure 4). Comparison of the alignment with the
known structures of biotin synthase (PDB structure
1R30), coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (PDB structure
1OLT) and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis enzyme
MoaA (PDB structure 1TV7) suggests structural and functional correlates for these regions and for the most conserved residues within them. The best-conserved motifs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

correspond to the Î²-strands of the inner barrel and their
C-terminal loops, while the regions of additional partial
conservation correspond to the outer-shell Î±-helices.
Motif 1 includes the most N-terminal Î²-strand in the (Î²/
Î±)6 barrel (strand 1). Three invariant cysteine residues in
the adjoining loop (Figure 4) coordinate the [Fe-S]4 cluster, which is present in a similar configuration in all protein structures resolved thus far. One iron atom has no
contact with the cysteine side chains, and is instead ligated
by the N and O atoms from the amino- and carboxy
groups of SAM. Also highly conserved is aromatic or heterocyclic residue (Y, F, or H) preceding the last of the three
cysteines; the main chain of this residue seems to form a
hydrogen bond with the adenosyl moiety of SAM, but the
significance of the side chain conservation is unclear; perhaps it contributes to the non-polar milieu of the bound
Fe-S cofactor, preserving it from oxidation.
The second prominent motif does not contain any invariant amino acids, but includes several residues with small
side chains, most often two or three glycines in a row (Figure 4). This motif corresponds to the second strand in the
barrel and the tight turn after the strand. The main chain
of this turn is within a contact distance from the amino
group of the methionine part of SAM. The third motif also
corresponds to the strand-turn structure. A signature T/SN-G that follows strand 3 is well conserved; as a rule, residues in this turn form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl
group of methionine in SAM. The fourth motif consists of
strand 4 and the loop with a highly conserved acidic or
amide residue (D, E, N, or Q). Typically, this residue is
within hydrogen-bonding range from both 2'- and
3'hydroxyl groups of the ribose ring of SAM. The strands
5 and 6 followed by loops provide one or more residues
that form hydrogen bonds with the amino group of adenosyl; however, sequence conservation in these regions is
moderate.
The heterogeneity of the SAM radical protein superfamily
is most pronounced in their C-terminal regions, which are
responsible for binding of substrates and auxiliary cofactors. On the other hand, the structure and sequence of the
N-terminal, SAM-binding region of SAM-radical proteins
is well conserved, analogously to the Rossmann-fold
methyltransferases. The SAM-binding region is essentially
an incomplete (Î²/Î±)6 "semi-barrel," which is typically
modified by evolutionarily diverse elements (commonly
consisting of Î±-helices, but sometimes also containing Î²hairpins or small sheets) that serve substrate-binding and
regulatory roles.
Rossmann folds and TIM-barrels in fact have quite similar
Î²/Î± architectures. This becomes especially evident in the
case of incomplete barrels. The primary difference is lack

Figure sequence alignment of SAM-dependent radical enzymes

Multiple sequence alignment of SAM-dependent radical enzymes. Sequences are denoted by NCBI gi number, conserved domain name (as in NCBI CDD database [141]), short protein name (if available), and abbreviated species name.

of one Î±-layer in TIM-barrels, and correlated changes in
sheet curvature and strand orientation. The two classes of
SAM-binding enzymes both use loops between strands
and helices to interact with various moieties of relatively
extended SAM molecules, but the details of this interaction are quite different (see below).

TIM barrel-like catalytic domain in QueA?
Queuosine is a hyper-modified nucleoside in bacterial
and eukaryotic tRNAs, produced by a multi-step enzymatic pathway that includes a transfer, with simultaneous
isomerization, of ribose moiety from SAM to a modified
base in tRNA, called 7-(aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanosine,
or preQ1. This step is performed by QueA protein, an Sadenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase.
QueA homologs are found in most bacteria, but their

Page 10 of 26

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:19

sequence is not strongly similar to any other protein family, and high-resolution structure of QueA in complex
with SAM is unavailable. We interrogated the fold
recognition meta-servers with individual QueA sequences
and with a probabilistic model of aligned QueA
homologs. The highest 3D-Jury consensus score (69 units,
indicating the upper level of the "gray zone" of provocative, if statistically insignificant, sequence similarities
[56]) was to pyruvate kinases, a distinct class of proteins
with three structural domains. The C-terminal, regulatory
domain of pyruvate kinases has no counterpart in QueA.
The other two domains are arranged in such a way that a
smaller, Î²-barrel domain is inserted into the larger, Î±/Î²
TIM-barrel domain but folds independently. Similar
arrangement of two domains is predicted for QueA.
When this manuscript was under preparation, the structure of QueA from Thermotoga maritima was resolved
(PDB structure 1VKY). In agreement with the fold recognition data, it shows an Î±/Î² domain with insertion of
independently folding Î²-barrel (Figure 1k). The structure
of the Î±/Î² domain shows one Î²-sheet, with preponderance of Î±-helices on one side (Figure 1k). This structure
resembles a semi-barrel, given a strongly curved Î²-sheet,
relative absence of Î±-helices on the concave side, and a
lid-like irregular arrangement of elements that covers the
cavity. There is an unresolved protein segment of 32 residues, which should be located close to the inner Î²-layer of
the semi-barrel, and may in fact extend its wall. An unresolved ligand is placed in the proximity of the C-termini
of several Î²-sheets, and if this is in fact SAM, its binding
mode would be similar to what is observed in other SAMbinding proteins (see below).

Î²-barrels in QueA and fluorination enzyme
Both QueA and fluorination enzyme structures show
fusions of a larger Î±/Î² domain and a smaller all-Î² domain
with barrel-like topology. The role of all-Î² domain in
QueA is unclear, but it is not very likely to be involved in
interaction with SAM. In contrast, the Î²-barrel domain in
FlA (which, in fact, is more similar to "smashed Î²-can,"
with one side caved in, producing a double-concave surface) makes many contacts with the ligand. Proceeding
from the N- to C-terminus, the Asp210-His211 (as in PDB
structure 1RQP) dipeptide in the loop after the first strand
bonds with the amino group of methionine; Asn215
bonds with the amino group of adenine; Ser269 and
Arg270 after strand 5 can form 4 hydrogen bonds altogether, all with the carboxyl group of methionine; and at
the C-terminus of strand 5, Arg277 and Ala279 provide
additional interactions with adenine. While the catalytic
mechanism of FlA is dependent on correct positioning of
the fluoride atom with regards to ribose, which is mediated by Ser158 in the Rossmann-like domain (see above
and reference [46]), the Î²-barrel domain appears to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

essential for correct orientation of SAM, which serves as
fluoride acceptor.
Between the sheets: double-Î² SAM-binding folds with a
common theme of internal domain duplication
Decarboxylase
S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC: 4.1.1.50,
SAMDC) is a key enzyme in spermidine and spermine
biosynthesis. It produces decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM),
which then donates aminopropyl group to putrescine or
spermidine, two essential intermediates in polyamine
biosynthesis. Because polyamines link diverse pathways
in cellular metabolic networks, and because chemical
inhibitors of SAMDC display potent antitumor and antiparasite activities [57,58], structure-function relationships
of SAMDC are of considerable interest.

SAMDC activities have been purified from all three
domains of Life (bacterium E. coli, archaea Methanococcus
jannaschii, and several eukaryotes), and certain common
features of the enzymes have been noticed. All three
enzymes are processed in vivo, forming a small subunit
derived from the N-terminus and a large subunit accounting for the rest of the molecule; the N-termini of all large
subunits contain a pyruvoyl group, produced from a serine residue by autoprocessing and required for the formation of the Schiff base during catalysis. All studied
enzymes form multimers from the heterodimers of large
and small subunits. There are also differences among bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic SAMDC: the length of the
precursor proteins in different species varies from 105 to
460 amino acids; mammalian enzymes require putrescine
for full activity, E. coli enzyme requires Mg2+ cation, while
archaeal and plant enzymes apparently do not require
those factors. The bacterial enzyme is a tetramer of heterodimers, while eukaryal and archaeal enzymes are
homodimerized heterodimers.
Comparative sequence analysis has revealed statistically
significant sequence similarity between archaeal and bacterial SAMDC [59]. Multiple alignment of these two
classes of SAMDC spans the complete length of the
shorter (ca. 120 aa) archaeal enzymes, and also suggests
that there are two types of bacterial enzymes â€“ some are
about the same size as archaeal SAMDC, and some are
longer and phylogenetically distinct (reference [60], Figure 5a, and unpublished observations). No sequence similarity has been reported between these enzymes and
eukaryotic SAMDC.
High-resolution structures of eukaryotic SAMDC from
humans and plants in complex with substrate analogs and
various inhibitors have been reported. The heterodimer
folds as a sandwich of two Î²-sheets between Î±-helical
regions, where the smaller subunit forms a half of one Î²-

sheet, and the larger subunit completes this sheet and
accounts for all the strands in the other sheet. The arrangement is unique among the known protein folds, but visual
inspection and superposition of the two Î±-Î² halves of the
molecule revealed their remarkable similarity and suggested the hypothesis of internal duplication [61,62]. The
evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism of prokaryotic SAMDC remained unclear.
Searches of sequence databases with the PSI-BLAST program and more involved probabilistic models of aligned
SAMDC enzymes confirmed statistically significant
sequence similarity between archaeal and bacterial
enzymes, and also, intriguingly, produced several statistically insignificant local matches to one-half of eukaryotic
SAMDC sandwich, in the area corresponding to the Î²strand 12 in the three-dimensional structure. This strand
is positioned next to the active center of the enzyme, and
contains residues important for catalysis and/or binding
of the substrate (see below). Because both these residues
appeared to be preserved in the BLAST output, we sought
better statistical validation of this similarity using
Metaserver [56]. When SAMDC homolog from archaea
Archaeoglobus fulgidus was used as a query, the highest 3DJury consensus score (46â€“60) was reported to the set of
the eukaryotic SAMDC structures; this score is at the top
of the zone with borderline significance, where most of
the non-trivial similarities are discovered [56]. The first
false positive (bacterial luciferase) was associated with the
sharp drop in the 3D-Jury scores (14.5).
Almost complete archaeal sequence can be aligned to the
half of eukaryotic template, with just one short gap. Conversely, the aligned region of the template corresponds
almost precisely to the C-terminal half of the double sandwich. We conclude that the archaeal enzyme may resemble a half of the eukaryotic SAMDC fold and may be
directly related to the pre-duplication ancestor of that
fold. Multiple sequence alignment of archaeal, bacterial,
and eukaryotic enzymes strongly reinforces these observations (Figure 5a). The C-terminal halves of eukaryotic
enzymes could be aligned to prokaryotic homologs
directly and unequivocally; the structurally similar N-terminal halves had to be superimposed using the knowledge of secondary structure and information about a few
conserved residues.
The functional and evolutionary implications of the alignment are provocative. In mammalian enzymes, SAM
decarboxylase is active as a dimer in which each protomer
contains one large and one small subunit, and each of the
two halves of the sandwich contributes several residues to
binding the substrate and actually performing the catalysis. In particular, Ser residue in Î²-strand 4 of the eukaryotic enzymes, which is converted into catalytic pyruvoyl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

group, appears to be within a short distance of the carboxyl group of SAM forming a Schiff base adduct with it.
Before product release, carbon of decarboxylated SAM is
protonated by adjacent Cys (Figure 5b). This protonation
regenerate the pyruvoyl group [63]. Also close to the active
site is the side chain of the histidine residue in strand 12,
which is believed to be responsible for abstraction of a
proton from the Î±-carbon of the catalytic serine during
proenzyme processing [64].
Two acidic residues contribute to binding of SAM:
glutamic acid at the C-terminus of strand 3 contacts the
base, and another glutamate, at the C-terminus of strand
12, interacts with both hydroxyl groups of the ribose ring.
All these residues are conserved in eukaryotic SAMDCs â€“
some in the N-terminal half of the sandwich, and others
in the structurally equivalent C-terminal half. Interestingly, in archaeal and most bacterial enzymes, the pattern
of conservation of these residues appears to be the union
of conserved elements in the two halves of eukaryotic
enzymes (Figure 5a), as if the bacto-archaeal enzyme is a
homolog of one half of the eukaryotic enzyme, and the Î²sandwich in the holoenzyme are made of two identical
molecules.
When this manuscript was in preparation, the structure of
ligand-free holoenzyme from bacterium T. maritima was
deposited in the database (PDB structure 1TMI). Analysis
of this structure confirms this sequence-based prediction
and suggests that the bacto-archaeal form is ancestral, and
the eukaryotic form has been derived from it by domain
duplication/fusion, followed by functional specialization
of two halves (most notably, by mutating the C-half of the
enzyme so that it no longer undergoes autoproteolysis â€“
Figure 5b).
SET domain
Discovered as conserved domain shared by chromatin
remodeling proteins Su(var)3â€“9, E(Z) (short for Enhancer
of Zeste) and Trithorax, SET domains turned out to be a
distinct class of SAM-dependent methyltransferases. All
studied SET methyltransferases transfer methyl group to
lysine within various nuclear proteins involved in chromatin function and regulation of transcription, such as
histones, TAF10, tumor suppressor p53, but also in such
diverse proteins as Rubisco and cytochrome C [65-68].

In SET-domain methyltransferases amine of the substrate
lysine residue access the methyl donor (SAM) through a
narrow channel connecting the substrate and SAM binding surfaces [69]. SAM binding site and the catalytic center
of all studied SET domains seem to be constructed on the
unusual but conserved, all-Î², knot-like structure [70].
Adenosyl moiety of SAM interacts directly and indirectly,
through water, with conserved histidine (PDB structure:

Page 13 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:19

1O9S-His297; 1P0Y-His243). This histidine may serve as
a proton acceptor for the hydroxyl group of invariant Tyr
(PDB structure 1O9S-Tyr335). The -OH of this Tyr is
within 4 Ã… of the presumptive location of the substrate Lys
NÎ¶, and may be involved in Lys side chain deprotonation
(deprotonated Lys is presumed to make a nucleophilic
attack on the SAM methyl group). Positively charged
amino nitrogen from SAM hydrogen bonds with the side
chain of invariant asparagine (PDB structure 1O9SAsn296). This interaction may contribute to the compact
conformation of the SAM molecule.
Phylogenetic analysis of the SET domain suggests that it is
an evolutionary innovation in the eukaryotic lineage
(with secondary lateral transfer to bacteria, archaea and
viruses) [71]. SET domains (Figure 1h and SCOP superfamily: 82199) have a fold unique for SAM binding proteins â€“ a substrate binding subdomain between two
structural repeats, which may have evolved by duplication
of 3-stranded unit with a generic ligand binding role
[71,72]. Those repeats have a Î²-clip fold formed by double-stranded ribbons sharply bent in two places; the ribbon ends form incomplete barrel.
Similar duplication of a basic three-stranded unit containing the Î²-clip structural motif probably occurred also in
related SAF and dUTPase superfamilies [72], which, however, tend to bind sugar and sugar derivatives [72]. There
have been several other cases of adaptation of a generic
ligand binding domain for SAM-binding, both in
enzymes and in regulatory proteins without catalytic
activity (see below).
SAM synthetase
S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAM synthetase,
ATP:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, or MAT, EC:
2.5.1.6) is the main, or, possibly, the only enzyme of de
novo SAM biosynthesis. SAM synthases from bacteria and
eukaryotes are closely related at the sequence level and
have very similar structures [73]. SAM synthases transiently interact with SAM prior to its release. The mechanism of reaction is thought to rely on conserved His14
(Figure 6), which acts as an acid to cleave the C5'-O5'
bond of ATP, while simultaneously a change in the ribose
ring conformation from C4'-exo to C3'-endo occurs, and
the S of Met makes a nucleophilic attack on the C5' to
form SAM [74].

The fold of bacto-eukaryal SAM synthetase is unique; each
protein chain is based on a Î²-Î±-Î²-Î²-Î±-Î² module that folds
into a wedge-like shape. A polypeptide chain consists of
three such tandemly repeated modules, so that the complete SAM synthetase fold looks like a three-slice cream
pie with topping made of Î²-sheets (Figure 1L). The active
form of the enzyme appears to consist of two pies, with Î²-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

layers facing each other. Two SAM molecules are bound
between the sheets of this dimer. In the E. coli enzyme,
both subunits contribute many residues to SAM binding
(Komoto et al. [74], Figure 6, and PDB structure: 1P7L and
1RG9) In particular, adenosine binds to Asp163, Arg229,
Phe230 on one subunit and to Ser99 on another subunit,
and interacts with many additional amino acids on both
subunits via water-mediated hydrogen bond network.
Methionine binds to Gln98 and Asp238 on one subunit,
to Glu55 on another, and likewise makes many additional
water molecule-mediated contacts. Bacto-eukaryal SAM
synthetase is an evolutionary unique sequence and structural family. Even SAM decarboxylase, which is superficially similar in that it also sandwiches SAM between two
Î²-sheets, has no detectable sequence or structure similarity to SAM synthetase.
SAM synthetases from Archaea have been isolated on the
basis of their biochemical activity [75]. We performed
sensitive searches of the conserved domain database, and
found clear evidence for common ancestry of all SAM synthetases (Table 2). Multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction indicate that archaeal
enzymes share the same three-dimensional structure as
their eukaryotic and bacterial homologs. All known SAM
synthetases have conserved GHPD signature containing
the main catalytic residue (His14 in E. coli gi:46015497)
[75]. Despite high sequence divergence between archaeal
and bacto-eukaryal enzymes, the complement of substrate
binding residues is well-preserved (Figure 6). The apparent common origin of this unique enzyme in all major
divisions of Life is of great interest for reconstruction of
the repertoire of SAM-binding protein in the ancestral life
forms (see below).
SAM-binding modules derived from generic ligand-binding
domains
ACC synthase
ACC synthase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine methylthioadenosine lyase, EC: 4.4.1.14, KOG0256) catalyses the ratelimiting step in biosynthesis of plant hormone ethylene
by the Î±,Î³-elimination of methylthioadenosine from SAM
to produce 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)
[76]. ACC synthases require pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)
for activity, and are related in sequence and structure to a
large, diverse group of PLP-dependent transferases. The
shared catalytic domain of this fold is of Î±/Î²/Î± type, with
mixed central Î²-sheet of 7 strands (order 3245671), where
strand 7 is antiparallel to the rest (SCOP fold: 53382; Figure 1j). Several residues are essential for the substrate
binding (reviewed by Jakubowicz; numbered as in PDB
structure 1B8G): Glu47 is responsible for putative ionic

tepidum). Residues are highlighted according to the amino acid properties with designations as in Figure 2. Substrate binding is
annotated below the alignment as follows: small letters â€“ water mediated interactions; inverted colors â€“ interactions with
ligand from the second subunit of the homodimeric protein ; A/a â€“ adenosyl moiety; R â€“ ribosyl moiety, M/m â€“ methionine
moiety; (+) â€“ Mg2+; K â€“ K+; P â€“ PPNP/Phosphate moiety. Consensus positions of the secondary structure elements are shown
above the alignment. Numbers in parentheses indicate number of residues omitted for clarity.

1 Placement of COGs in LUCA based on weighted parsimony analysis of phyletic patterns [138]. 1/0 indicates that this gene has been tracked back
to LUCA genome under all tested conditions; 0/1 indicates tentative placement of gene in LUCA under some but not all conditions.
2 Phylogenetic analysis of each COG. Plus sign indicates tree topology that is fully consistent with gene presence in LUCA, and the question mark
indicates a tentative support for the LUCA hypothesis (see Materials and Methods)

thase, namely as amino group donor in aminotransferase
reaction. Both ACC synthase and DAPA synthase have
similar active site residues involved in PLP cofactor binding. The interactions between SAM and DAPA synthase
have not been studied in detail.
It is likely that ACC synthase and DAPA synthase evolved
from other aminotransferases with different, perhaps
broad, specificity, by accumulating changes in the ligandbinding region that increased its specificity towards SAM
[80]. The evolutionary heritage of ACC synthase is manifest in the retained ability of the enzyme to catalyze slow
transamination of substrates such as alanine [81]. Structural similarity between ACC-, DAPA-synthase and some
other PLP-dependent enzymes (i.e. cystine C-S lyase â€“
PDB structure 1ELQ; cystathionine Î²-lyase â€“ PDB structure 1CL2) indicate that SAM binding in this case may
have originated from ancestor with PLP-dependent binding of amino group of various sulfur containing amino
acids or amino acid derivatives.

AHL synthase
Synthesis and detection of acyl-homoserine lactones
(AHLs) enables many gram-negative bacteria to engage in
quorum/diffusion sensing, an intercellular signaling
mechanism that activates differentiation towards virulence and biofilm formation [82-84].

The AHL synthases (COG3916) catalyze acylation and
lactonization of SAM, where the acyl group is provided by
acylated acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) [85,86]. AHL synthases (SCOP family: 75508; Figure 1p) has acyl-CoA Nacyltransferase ("GNAT-like") fold: Î±/Î²/Î± sandwich with
highly twisted Î²-sheet (SCOP fold: 55728). The conserved
N-terminal residues: Arg23, Phe27, and Trp33 (numbered
as in PDB structure 1RO5) form putative SAM binding
pocket and undergo a dramatic conformational rearrangement upon acyl-ACP binding. This conformational
change brings conserved residues of the putative SAM
binding site in close proximity to the catalytic site [87].
Position of conserved Î²-bulge formed by Ser103 and
Arg104 in Î²4 (numbered as in PDB structure 1RO5) dis-

tinguishes SAM-binding from other proteins with acylCoA-N-acyltransferase fold [86,87]. There is no detectable
sequence or structural similarity between AHL synthases
and other known SAM binding proteins, indicating independent origin of SAM binding in this fold. As with ACC
synthase and DAPA synthase, the most likely mechanism
of adaptation was by selecting relatively small changes in
a generic ligand-binding region that increased relative
affinity to SAM.
Met repressor
The E. coli MetJ repressor (Figure 1m; SCOP family:
100972; COG3060) uses SAM as a co-repressor to regulate
the production of methionine. MetJ is a homodimeric,
DNA-binding protein with ribbon-helix-helix fold. Corepressor (SAM) binds to each monomer of the protein
dimer at sites that lie on the opposite side of the protein
from the DNA-binding motif. Binding of co-repressor
affects DNA affinity, but apparently not specificity of MetJ
[88-91]. Affinity of MetJ DNA binding is affected primarily by the positive charge associated with the ternary
sulfur atom in co-repressor (SAM), which creates a region
of positive electrostatic potential on the DNA binding surface overlapping the adjacent phosphodiester backbone
in the region of the operator [92-94]. The SAM's adenine
ring inserts itself deeply inside a hydrophobic pocket, consisted of side chains from both monomers. The positively
charged sulfur of the SAM is greatly attracted by the net
negatively charged C-terminal end of the Î²-helix, hence
docking the SAM molecule in place. Electrostatic properties of SAM and its ability to serve as a regulatory feedback
molecule in the common metabolic pathway of methionine synthesis probably played an important role in the
emergence of this unique mode of SAM binding by MetJ.

MetJ is the only known SAM-binding representative of
evolutionarily ancient ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) class of
DNA-binding proteins [92,95]. Evolution of SAM cofactor
binding in this protein was feasible because SAM adenosyl
moiety fit into the cleft formed by both monomers, and
its sulfonium center conformation was able to adapt to
non-catalytic electrostatic interactions with MetJ
repressor.
CBS
CBS-domains (COG0517) are widely distributed in all
divisions of Life, in the form of fusions with various unrelated proteins, where they usually form tandem pairs.
Binding of the adenosyl-containing molecules, such as
ATP, AMP, and SAM by CBS-domains is important for
their function as energy or redox status-sensing modules
[96-98]. Some CBS-domains also binds single stranded
nucleic acids [99].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

In general, a tandem of CBS domains (encoded by ~120
aa) folds into one domain with a Î²-sandwich and 4 Î±-helices extending from one edge (Figure 1o). CBS domains
within each pair are asymmetric. CBS-domain is common
in multidomain proteins (i.e.: 15 in Bacteria and 9 in
Archaea [100]) and is probably derived from generic
small molecule-binding domain. The mode of SAM binding to CBS domains remains unknown.

Porphyrin C-methyltransferases are a family of proteins
involved in biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, which are used
in chelation of metal ion. Representative structures of Cbif
and CysG with bound reaction product (SAH) are known.
They have the same fold, which consists of two dissimilar
Î±/Î² domains. Domain 1 has parallel sheet of 5 strands
(order 32415) sandwiched between 3 Î±-helices; domain 2
has mixed sheet of 5 strands (also sandwiched between 3
Î±-helices), order 12534; strands 4 & 5 are antiparallel to
the rest; (Figure 1d) [101,102]. The reaction product is
bound in a large pocket between the N and C-terminal
domains. Binding pocket contains conserved glycine-rich
loop GAGPGD, similarly to Rossmann-fold methyltransferases, but in crystal structures of porphyrin C-methyltransferases (i.e. PDB structure 1CBF, 1PJQ, and 1S4D)
glycine-rich loop does not contact methionine moiety of
SAH, at least in the absence of the precorrin substrate.
Instead, Pro30 from the glycine-rich loop (numbered as
in PDB structure 1CBF) forms hydrogen bond with adenosyl moiety. Other conserved residues participate in
(SAH) binding: adenosyl moiety hydrogen-bond with
conserved Ala213, ribosyl moiety hydrogen bound with
conserved hydrophobic Leu184 and Ala241; carboxyl
group bind Asp103 from conserved Gly-Asp-Pro motif
and also Tyr131; the amino group hydrogen-bond with
conserved hydrophobic Met106. Near the entrance of
SAM binding cleft there is conserved aromatic residue
(Tyr107) positioned next to the sulfur of SAH.

Despite structural similarity to Rossmann-fold methyltransferases and local sequence similarity in the glycinerich loop, porphyrin C-methyltransferases have distinct
mode of SAM binding. The evolutionary relationships
between porphyrin methyltransferases and other SAMbinding (or indeed any other) proteins remain unclear.
Met synthase activation domain
B12-dependent methionine synthases are large multidomain proteins, which catalyze a multistep reaction of the
transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
to homocysteine. The C-terminal domain of Met synthase
is involved in reactivation of spontaneously oxidized
coenzyme B12, and therefore is required for the catalysis.
This activation domain (pfam02965 and C-terminal part

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:19

of COG1410) has an unusual fold: Î²-Î±(2)-Î²(2)-Î±(2)-Î²-Î±Î²; antiparallel Î²-sheet; order 12354 (Figure 1e; SCOP fold:
56506). Large conformational changes are required for
reactivation reaction to occur [103-105].
This domain binds SAM in a shallow groove along the
edges of the Î²-strands. There are several conserved residues involved in SAM binding (numbered as in PDB
structure 1MSK): Asp946 and Glu1101 bind
carboxypropyl moiety; Arg1134 and Tyr1130 (later via
water mediated interactions) bind ribosyl moiety;
Tyr1139 and Tyr1189 participate in stacking interactions
with adenosyl moiety; Tyr1190 main chain (or Phe in
other known sequences) hydrogen bond with adenosyl
moiety of SAM. This unusual domain is found in bacterial
and metazoan proteins. Interestingly, Met synthases of
thermophilic bacteria lack the SAM-binding/activation
domain altogether. Presumably, the lack of the transferase
domain activity is compensated for by the methyltransferase protein also involved in the same reaction [106].
This particular adaptation in thermophiles seems to be
partly due to requirement for greater thermal stability of
the enzyme â€“ making large conformational changes
required for reactivation less favorable.
Divergence and convergence in evolution of SAM binding
The known SAM-binding proteins belong to 15 distinct
superfamilies/folds, which comprise at least 20 more
sequence families (Figure 1 and Table 4), that is: 1 â€“ Rossmann fold (methyltransferase, methylene transferase,
nicotianamine synthase, spermidine synthase, spermine
synthase, and acalcynomycin-10-hydroxylase), 2 â€“ Met
synthase activating domain, 3 â€“ porphyrin C-methyltransferase, 4 â€“ SPOUT methyltransferase, 5 â€“ SET domain
methyltransferase, 6 â€“ isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase, 7 â€“ fluorinating enzyme, 8 â€“ tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase (QueA), 9 â€“ SAM decarboxylase, 10
â€“ SAM synthetase, 11 â€“ ACC synthase and DAPA synthase,
12 â€“ N-acyl-homoserine lactone synthase, 13 â€“ Met
repressor, 14 â€“ CBS domain, 15 â€“ SAM-dependent radical.

These folds belong to all four large structural classes [107],
though there is a distinct excess of Î±-Î² and especially Î±/Î²
folds.
Comparison of fold classes and molecular functions
reveals a broad picture of complex interplay between
sequence divergence and functional convergence in the
evolution of SAM-binding proteins and SAM-dependent
molecular functions. On the whole, the assemblage of
SAM-binding proteins is extremely heterogeneous. There
are huge, apparently monophyletic, superfamilies, which
in turn belong to even larger superfolds (Class I methyltransferases from a Rossmann-like superfold is an example), and there are small families with unique folds. There

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/19

are molecular functions confined to just one superfamily,
as in the case of SAM radical formation, which thus far is
known to be performed only by enzymes belonging to
large and diverse, yet apparently monophyletic, TIM-barrel-like SAM-radical fold. On the other hand, there is
SAM-dependent methylation, performed by at least five
classes of enzymes, which represent two completely different fold classes and may have been "invented" three or
four times (ref. [12] and this study).
Duplication of protein domains is relatively common in
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, for example at least
58% of the domains in Mycoplasma [108] and 98% of the
domains in humans [109-111] are duplicates. Several
SAM-binding proteins appear to have evolved by ancient
domain duplications. Examples include SET-domain
methyltransferase [71], SAM synthase, where triplication
of a basic wedge-shaped module is likely, and eukaryal
SAM decarboxylase (this study). Here again, there is no
strict correlation between that mechanism of protein
emergence and its further evolution trajectory: SAM synthase and SAM decarboxylase have most likely persisted in
evolution as single- or low-copy, vertically transmitted
genes since the Last Universal Common Ancestor,
whereas SET methyltransferases appear to be an eukaryotic innovation that experienced lineage-specific expansions, significant diversification of substrate specificity,
and occasional horizontal transfer to prokaryotes.
Examination of the largest, most diverse set of SAMdependent enzymes unified by common biochemical
function, namely, SAM-dependent methyltransferases,
shows more of the same trend. All methyltransferases
belong to the same EC class (EC: 2.1.1.-), but they comprise five structural families (reviewed in ref. [12]), which
appear to lack clearly discernible common ancestor (with
the possible exception of Class I and SPOUT methyltransferase, see above). Three classes, I, IV, and V, are large,
found across broad groups of genomes, and, at least in the
cases of classes I and V, in multiple genomic contexts,
including various protein fusions. In contrast, class II is
restricted to just one specialized enzymatic system,
methionine synthase, with very specific domain composition. Class I displays a huge variety of substrate specificities, whereas the substrates of other classes are much more
narrowly defined (tetrapyrroles for class III, mostly rRNAs
and tRNAs for class IV, and short list of proteins for class
V). Interestingly, each of these classes of substrates are also
targeted by class I enzymes. For example, although most
of precorrin methyltransferases are class III enzymes, precorrin-C6 methyltransferase CbiT is a typical Class-I Rossmannoid [112]. Similarly, though most histone lysine Nmethyltransferases are class V (SET-domain proteins), the
Dot1 histone H3-Lys79 N-methyltransferase belongs to
Class I [113]. In at least one case, exactly the same base in

tRNA is methylated by Class I methyltransferase in bacteria and by class IV enzyme in archaea [114], suggesting
either parallel evolution of different molecular solutions
for the same task, or functional takeover by an unrelated
gene.
Phyletic distribution and phylogeny of SAM-binding
proteins suggests multiple roles for SAM in the Last
Universal Common Ancestor
SAM-binding proteins perform an unprecedented variety
of chemical reactions, and belong to about 22 distinct
sequence and structural families of proteins. It has been
noted that some of these groups of proteins (most notably, Rossmann-fold methyltransferases) are extremely
ancient and were more than likely represented by multiple paralogs in the life forms predating the divergence of
bacteria, archaea, and eukarya [5]. On the other hand,
some of the SAM-binding proteins appear to have been
invented later in evolution. Such scenarios have been documented, for example, for SET-domain methyltransferase
family, which is thought to have emerged in early eukaryotes and then passed to a few bacteria by lateral gene
transfer, while greatly expanding in size in multicellular
eukaryotes [71], and are also likely for Met repressor,
which is a member of the large ligand-binding family
essentially confined to bacteria [115]. A complex picture

of gains, losses, and lineage-specific expansions of genes
coding for SAM-binding proteins is illustrated in Table 3.
We performed a more detailed examination of evolutionary trajectories of SAM-binding proteins, using information from the NCBI COG database. Each COG is a set of
orthologous genes in completely sequenced genomes,
along with lineage-specific paralogs. A COG is characterized by phyletic pattern, which is the set of genomes that
has at least one member of this COG, and by sequencebased phylogenetic tree of COG members [116]. This
information can be used, in conjunction with the consensus phylogenetic tree of the completely sequence
genomes, to infer the presence or absence of a COG in an
ancestral life form. We used a relatively conservative
estimate, allowing for occasional horizontal gene transfer
and demanding a complete agreement between species'
tree, gene family tree, and phyletic pattern (see Methods
for more detail). Under these conditions, the SAM-binding complement of LUCA proteins consists of 9 ancestral
COGs (Table 2).
Although 6 of 9 COGs in LUCA represent proteins with
Rossmann-like fold, the remaining three folds are all different. It should be noted that the set of 9 COGs is almost
certainly an underestimation of the SAM-binding proteome in LUCA. Evolutionary model allowing more frePage 21 of 26

quent horizontal gene transfer and/or non-orthologous
gene displacements, as well as slight disagreement
between different lines of evidence, will increase the list of
COGs that can be placed in LUCA genome. The specificity
of these additional enzymes varies, although the modification of translation apparatus continues to figure prominently in the increased set; the diversity of folds, however,
appears to increase only slightly, mostly due to addition
of the SPOUT fold.
An already-diverse group of Rossmann-like SAM-dependent transferases, a variation of TIM-barrel, and two unique
Î±Î²Î²Î± architectures thus appear to represent the best-supported ancestral set of SAM-binding proteins. Although
less diverse than the present-day variety of SAM-binding
proteins, this set is far from simple. Interestingly, it consists of proteins with Î±/Î² architecture and is depleted of
all-Î± and all-Î² proteins, as seems to be the case for other
categories of ancestral enzymes [117] and perhaps nonenzymatic proteins too [118].
The substrates and molecular functions of many of these
enzymes are hard to ascertain. Ancient enzymes may have
had broader specificities than their present-day descendants [119], but several pathways nevertheless emerge from
the analysis of the SAM-binding proteome of the LUCA
(Table 2). The common ancestor of bacteria, archaea and
eukarya appears to have been able to synthesize SAM de
novo, from ATP and methionine; to use it for methylation
of RNA bases and, probably, proteins such as translation
factors; to decarboxylate SAM; and to synthesize
polyamines with the aid of dcSAM. In addition, LUCA had
the capacity for generating SAM radicals.
Slightly less restrictive evolutionary model enlarges the set
of SAM-binding proteins in LUCA, mostly by increasing
the number of paralogs in Class I MT and SAM-radical
families, but also by supplementing the set with SPOUT
methyltransferases. Further sequence and structure comparison may provide for more detailed understanding of
these ancestors, perhaps even to the point of reconstructing the ancestral sequences and studying the ancient SAMbinding proteins in the laboratory.

program, with the expectation value for inclusion into the
PSSM (-h parameter) set at 0.01, unless otherwise indicated [121]. Additional profile searches were carried out
using hidden Markov models generated from alignments
of protein domains using the hmmsearch program of the
HMMER2 package [122].
Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed in an iterative fashion, alternating between
sequence and structure alignments [123]. Structural alignments of representative structures from the SCOP families
[107] were produced using CE-MC [124] and DALI [125].
The muscle program [126] was used to refine all
alignments.
The 3-dimensional structures of proteins were manipulated using the Rasmol program and ribbon diagrams
were drawn using the PyMOL program [127].
The Metaserver approach [56] was used to interrogate the
network of programs that perform secondary structure
prediction and tertiary fold-recognition of proteins by a
variety of probabilistic matching and energy calculations
(here we used predictions from: PSIPRED [128], PROFsec
[129], SAM-T02 [130], FFAS03 [131], 3DPSSM [132],
BIOINBGU [133], ORFeus [134], FUGUE [135], and
Pcons server [136]).
Topology diagrams were created by using TOPS [137].
The inference of the ancestral presences/absences of the
COGs has been done by Mirkin et al. [138]; their model
was used in this study, with modifications described in
Mushegian [118].
