Abstract
Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is a severe acute viral disease specifically affecting the
European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus. As the European rabbit is the predominant species of
domestic rabbit throughout the world, RHD contributes towards significant losses to rabbit
farming industries and endangers wild populations of rabbits in Europe and other predatory animals
in Europe that depend upon rabbits as a food source. Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease virus (RHDV)
– a Lagovirus belonging to the family Caliciviridae is the etiological agent of RHD. Typically, RHD
presents with sudden death in 70% to 95% of infected animals. There have been four separate
incursions of RHDV in the USA, the most recent of which occurred in the state of Indiana in June
of 2005. Animal inoculation studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the Indiana 2005 isolate, which
caused acute death and pathological changes characterized by acute diffuse severe liver necrosis
and pulmonary hemorrhages. Complete viral genome sequences of all USA outbreak isolates were
determined and comparative genomics revealed that each outbreak was the result of a separate
introduction of virus rather than from a single virus lineage. All of the USA isolates clustered with
RHDV genomes from China, and phylogenetic analysis of the major capsid protein (VP60) revealed
that they were related to a pandemic antigenic variant strain known as RHDVa. Rapid spread of the
RHDVa pandemic suggests a selective advantage for this new subtype. Given its rapid spread,
pathogenic nature, and potential to further evolve, possibly broadening its host range to include
other genera native to the Americas, RHDVa should be regarded as a threat.

Introduction
Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is a highly conta-

gious, severe acute viral illness that specifically afflicts rabbits of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. Since its

emergence in 1984, RHD has resulted in the deaths of
nearly a quarter billion free-living and domestic rabbits.
While RHDV is not known to affect humans or any other
animal species, it continues to generate significant losses
to rabbit farming industries and trade. Typically, the disease presents with fever and sudden death within the first
12 to 36 hours after natural exposure. Rabbits will often
develop a blood-tinged foamy nasal discharge, severe respiratory distress and/or convulsions preceding death
[1,2]. Mortality rates are high, ranging from 70% to 95%.
However, 5% to 10% of infected rabbits may display an
illness that presents with jaundice, malaise, weight-loss,
and eventual death within 1 to 2 weeks of onset. As an
exception, rabbits under 45–50 days of age survive infection without the presentation of clinical signs, although
they are suspected of carrying the infection [3]. Humoral
immunity is critical to protection from RHD, and an effective vaccine produced from liver homogenates of infected
rabbits is employed to protect breeding rabbits in all
countries where RHD is endemic [4].

arthropod vectors, including blow flies or flesh flies, have
also been implicated in the spread of RHDV [21]. Since its
characterization from a large outbreak in 1984 that killed
over 140 million rabbits in China [22], the spread of RHD
throughout the world has been rapid. RHD was reported
in Italy in 1986 [23], and it became endemic in Europe by
1990 [24]. In 1988, RHD was reported in Korea and Mexico; both outbreaks have been linked to the importation
of rabbit products from China [25,26]. O. cuniculus is not
native to Mexico, and in 1989 the government of Mexico
initiated a successful eradication campaign. To date Mexico remains free of RHD. RHDV was inadvertently introduced into Australia by a breach in biocontainment
during studies aimed at developing RHDV as a biological
control agent for feral rabbit population reduction [2729]. It spread rapidly throughout Australia, leading to its
illegal introduction into New Zealand in 1997 by farmers
attempting to reduce local rabbit populations [30-32].
Today, RHD is endemic in China, Korea, Europe,
Morocco, Cuba, Australia, and New Zealand.

The etiological agent of RHD is the Rabbit Hemorrhagic
Disease Virus (RHDV), a member of the family Caliciviridae [5-8]. In addition to RHD, this family of viruses comprises a number of important human and animal
pathogens including noroviruses or Norwalk-like viruses,
which cause severe gastroenteritis in humans, and vesiviruses like the vesicular exanthema of swine virus. A similar
virus, the European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus
(EBHSV), afflicts the European hares of the Lepus genus
[9]. The nearest relation to RHDV, however, is a non-pathogenic calicivirus named Rabbit Calicivirus (RCV) [10].
These three viruses of Lagomorphs (RHDV, RCV and
EBHSV) comprise a recently formed Lagovirus genus
within the family Caliciviridae [11].

Only a single serotype of RHDV is known to exist [33,34].
Of particular interest however, has been the emergence of
an antigenic variant strain or subtype of RHDV known as
RHDVa [35,36]. For instance, RHDVa is replacing original
strains of RHDV in Italy [37]. Likewise, two recent French
isolates belonging to the RHDVa antigenic subtype have
been identified [38]. Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP60
sequences from isolates dating back to 1988 also revealed
the emergence of the RHDVa strain in a 2003 outbreak of
RHD in Hungary [39]. Likewise, the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE) has reported that the RHDVa
subtype was responsible for the first ever recorded outbreak of RHD in Uruguay near the end of November of
2004. At the same time, a large outbreak of RHD attributed to RHDVa occurred in Cuba [40]. Most recently, the
RHDVa subtype was isolated from wild rabbits in the
Netherlands and has been suggested as a possible reason
for the recent decline in free living O. cuniculus rabbits in
that country [41]. These combined observations confirm
that the spread of RHDVa is a pandemic and suggest a
selective advantage for infectivity or replication of RHDVa
over the original serotype of RHDV.

RHDV like other caliciviruses forms 28–32 nm diameter,
non-enveloped, icosohedral virus particles that harbor a
7.4 kb positive or sense oriented single-stranded RNA
genome that encodes a 257 kDa polyprotein [12,13].
Post-translational processing at 8 proteolytic cleavage
sites within this polyprotein gives rise to several mature
nonstructural proteins including a helicase, protease, and
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, as well as to the 60 kDa
major capsid protein/antigen (VP60) [14-16]. This same
VP60 is also known to be expressed from a downstream
2.4 kb subgenomic mRNA that arises from an alternate
transcriptional start site [17,18]. An additional minor capsid protein is expressed downstream of the VP60 by virtue
of a novel translational termination and reinitiating
mechanism [19,20].
RHDV is environmentally stable, highly infectious, and
transmissible by close contact or by contact with fomites
such as contaminated fur, clothing, or cages. Indirect

The USA has experienced four sporadic incursions of
RHDV, the first of which occurred in Crawford County,
Iowa in April of 2000 (IA-00) [42]. In August of 2001, an
outbreak of RHD was reported in Utah County, Utah (UT01) and was traced to a shipment and subsequent outbreak in Illinois. In December of 2001 an isolated outbreak occurred at a zoo in Flushing, New York (NY-01),
suspected to have resulted from the importation of rabbit
meat from China. Most recently in 2005, an outbreak of
RHD occurred at a rabbit farm in Vanderburgh County,
Indiana (IN-05) with an epidemiological link to the pur-

chase of animals from an open market in Kentucky. No
positive cases have been reported from Kentucky, and in
all U.S. outbreaks the origins of the virus remained indeterminable.
In this paper we describe the pathogenesis of the IN-05
outbreak isolate from the USA and for the first time compare the complete viral genomes of all U.S. isolates with
genomes of other RHDV isolates throughout the world.

Results
U.S. RHDV Genomic Sequences
Complete genomes for the four U.S. RHDV isolates (IA00, UT-01, NY-01, and IN-05) were determined by direct
sequencing of overlapping RT-PCR products and by direct
sequencing of 5' and 3' RACE products. For comparison,
the full genome sequence of an Italy isolate (Italy 90) and
partial sequence of a Korean isolate (Korea 90) lacking
only the extreme 5' end were determined. Like the NCBI
reference RHDV genome (acc#: NC_001543), each of the
four U.S. RHDV genomes had a length of 7,437 nt and
had an additional poly A tail of undetermined length. The
U.S. isolates shared 89–90% nucleotide sequence identity
with the viral genome of the NCBI reference strain and
94–95% nucleotide sequence identity with each other.
Animal inoculation study
The Indiana Outbreak in 2005 resulted in nearly 50%
mortality of rabbits on the affected premises before intervention by the USDA. To characterize pathogenicity of the
IN-05 RHDV isolate, three adult rabbits were inoculated
by intramuscular injection with 1 ml each of a 10% w/v
liver homogenate obtained from the index case for the IN05 outbreak. Clinical signs of high fever and depression
appeared in one animal 24 hr post inoculation. Slight
nasal bleeding in two animals was apparent at 36 hr post
infection, and the two symptomatic animals succumbed
to the infection within 48 hr. The surviving rabbit displayed no clinical signs for three weeks post-inoculation.

RHDV is known to replicate in the liver, which results in
severe liver necrosis and terminally disseminated intravascular coagulation [7,43-45]. Homogenates prepared from
livers of the two fatally infected animals tested positive for
VP60 capsid antigen, while the liver homogenate from the
surviving animal, taken on day 21 post infection, was negative for viral capsid antigen by antigen capture ELISA
(Table 1). Animals that succumb to RHD typically display

splenomegaly, a pale necrotic liver, and a multitude of infarcts and hemorrhages throughout the lungs. Upon
necropsy, livers of the two rabbits that had died during the
study were pale, and on histopathology displayed multifocal to coalescing acute severe hepatic necrosis (Figure
1A). The distribution of necrosis was mostly periportal
extending towards the midzonal areas. Necrotic areas
were characterized by disassociation of the hepatic cords,
cellular swelling, hypereosinophilia and hepatocellular
vacuolar changes (Figure 1A). Hepatocellular changes
were characterized by pyknosis, karyorrhexis and karyolysis. Some of the degenerating hepatocytes contained intracytoplasmic acidophilic bodies. Infiltration by
inflammatory cells was minimal and consisted mainly of
neutrophils. In contrast, liver tissue from the surviving
rabbit showed no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage
(Figure 1B). Lungs from the fatally infected rabbits
showed pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage, and
spleens were characterized by diffuse splenic congestion
and mild lymphoid hyperplasia with lymphocytic apoptosis.
Viral particles with short cup-like projections and a mean
diameter of 26.5 +/- 1.9 nm, typical of caliciviruses [26],
were evident by transmission electron microscopy of
ultra-thin liver sections from the two affected animals
(Figure 1C) and by negative staining electron microscopy
of liver homogenates (data not shown). Cytopathic effects
in hepatocytes included condensation of chromatin, and
a disruption of cristae in mitochondria (Figure 1D). Many
cells displayed a dense labyrinth of membrane consistent
with a condensation of smooth and rough endoplasmic
reticulum (Figure 1D).
Pre-inoculation serum and heparinized blood samples for
all three animals were found to be negative for antibody
against RHDV by ELISA (Table 2). Both serum and
heparinized blood samples from the surviving rabbit
tested negative until day nine post-inoculation at which
time all samples tested positive for anti-VP60 IgM, IgG,
and IgA until euthanasia at three weeks post-inoculation
(Table 2).
The diagnostic RT-PCR assay employed in all of the U.S.
RHD outbreaks involved primers (88U and 315D)
directed against a 246 bp region of the highly conserved
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (4588–4833,
Materials and Methods Section). Livers from the two
fatally infected animals contained RHDV genomic RNA as
demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis (Table 3). Spleen and
lung tissues, however, did not yield RT-PCR products nor
did any of the tissue samples from the surviving animal
(Table 3). Virus shedding was not detectable by RT-PCR of
nasal, urethral, or rectal swabs in the fatally infected animals (Table 3). In contrast, nasal and urinary tract swabs

taken at 48 hr post-inoculation and a rectal swab taken at
72 hr post-inoculation from the surviving rabbit yielded
positive RT-PCR products (Table 3). While this confirmed
the existence of a brief period of virus shedding during the
acute phase of infection, the absence of detection in most
of the swab samples suggests that detection of a carrier
state or virus shedding using this RT-PCR method was not
practical. Likewise, serum and heparinized blood samples
from all animals were negative by RT-PCR (Table 3).
While these data indicate that liver tissue represents the
best sample for RHD diagnosis by RT-PCR, other more
sensitive methods using either a nested RT-PCR [46] or a
realtime RT-PCR [47] may be used to detect RHDV in
other tissues types, blood or even paraffin embedded tissue sections.
Sequence Analysis
To determine whether the U.S. isolates were related to the
pandemic RHDVa subtype currently spreading throughout Europe, we compared putative translations of the
VP60 capsid regions for all US isolates (IA-00, NY-01, UT01, and IN-05) to that of 41 other isolates of RHDV and
RCV. All four U.S. isolates branched consistently with a
group of 15 other isolates that included the typed RHDVa
antigenic variants from France and Italy (Figure 2). Of
note, RHDV isolates from New York and Utah in the same
year, while both grouping within the RHDVa clade, did
not branch together indicating separate origins for these
outbreaks. Furthermore, another North American isolate,
Mex-89, failed to cluster with the RHDVa clade distinguishing it from the other American isolates (Figure 2).

Also consistent with the finding that this clade represented RHDVa subtypes, the IA-00 isolate was typed as
RHDVa using an antigen capture ELISA and a panel of
type-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 3). This further supports the inference that monoclonal antibody
3B12 recognizes an RHDVa type-specific epitope while
monoclonal antibody 1H8 recognizes an original RHDV
type-specific epitope (Figure 3) [34,35]. In contrast monoclonal antibody 2B4 recognizes a shared epitope
between the two types of RHDV (Figure 3).
An RHDVa strain-specific antigenic epitope has been previously predicted to reside within residues 344 to 370 in
the hypervariable region E of the VP60 capsid protein
[35]. Indeed, sequence alignment of the 45 RHDV isolates
by CLUSTAL W [48] demonstrated that particular amino
acid substitutions within this antigenic epitope are shared
among the U.S. isolates and all other RHDVa serotypic
variants (Figure 4). While the 344 aa-370 aa RHDVa-specific mutation cluster appeared to be the most significant
cluster of type-specific mutations, additional small clusters of RHDVa-specific mutations did appear throughout
the VP60 coding region (Additional file 1). To confirm the
subtype-specific antigenicity of the remaining three U.S.
RHDV isolates, liver homogenates from rabbits experimentally infected with each U.S. isolate were tested by
antigen capture ELISA using the original RHDV strain-specific monoclonal antibody 1H8 and the RHDVa strainspecific monoclonal antibody 3B12 (Figure 5). Monocolonal antibody 2B4 was used as a control for the presence of virus and isolates from Italy, Mexico and Korea

Relationship of VP60 capsid proteins among diverse isolates of RHDV. The predicted amino acid sequences of 45
RHDV isolates were aligned in CLUSTAL W. One thousand bootstrap replicates were subjected to protein distance and
UPGMA methods and the consensus phylogenetic tree is shown. The VP60 region of a non-pathogenic rabbit calicivirus (RCV)

were tested for comparison to the original RHDV serotype
(Figure 5). While all tested virus isolates reacted to the
control antibody 2B4, only the U.S. isolates reacted with
the RHDVa-specific antibody 3B12 (Figure 5). Likewise,
all U.S. virus isolates failed to react with the original
RHDV type-specific antibody 1H8. Conversely, isolates
from Italy, Mexico and Korea, which fall outside of the
RHDVa clade (Figure 2), failed to react with the RHDVa

type-specific antibody 3B12 but reacted with the original
RHDV type-specific antibody 1H8 (Figure 5).
While a more detailed look at synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions within the VP60 coding region may be sufficient for discriminating relatedness
within a single outbreak and can easily be used to discriminate between the prototype RHDV and the recent pandemic RHDVa strains, recombination or strong positive

Discussion

Figure profile of the first U.S. outbreak isolate RHDV IA-00
Epitope 3
Epitope profile of the first U.S. outbreak isolate
RHDV IA-00. The RHDV IA-00 isolate was subtyped by
antigen capture ELISA using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Previous studies and communication from Lorenzo
Capucci [35] have determined that monoclonal antibodies
1H8, 2A10, and 1H3 recognize the original serotype of
RHDV while antibodies 3D4, 3B12, 2E1, 3D6, and 5D11 recognize RHDVa-specific epitopes. Additional monoclonal antibodies used (6H6, 1F10, 3H6, 6F9, 2B4, and 2G3) were not
subtype-specific. The IA-00 isolate (black bars) correlated in
antibody recognition profile to a prototype RHDVa strain,
Pavia 1997 (grey bars). The Brescia 1989 strain (stippled
bars) was used as an original RHDV serotype virus control.
Normal liver from an uninfected rabbit served as a negative
control (white bars).
selection for particular mutations leading to RHDVa-specific epitopes could confound predictions of relatedness
between geographically or temporally distant outbreaks.
Therefore, to better assess the relatedness of the U.S. isolates to each other and to other geographically distinct
virus isolates, we employed full genome nucleotide
sequence comparisons between the 4 U.S. isolates and 10
other complete RHDV genomes (Figure 6A). Using the
Neighbor Joining method and 1000 bootstrap replicates,
the analysis revealed with a high degree of confidence
(bootstrap values > 95%) that all 4 U.S. isolates were
more closely related to separate isolates from China than
they were to each other. This closer phylogenetic link
between individual U.S. outbreaks and Chinese isolates
indicated that each of the U.S. outbreaks were the result of
a separate introduction of virus. Once again, the four U.S.
isolates clustered within the RHDVa clade; therefore, to
confirm our conclusions, all genomes were reanalyzed
after deletion of the VP60 coding region, thus removing
any potential bias attributable to recombination or positive selection for RHDVa-specific epitopes within the
VP60 coding region (Figure 6B). Results were nearly identical to those obtained by using the full genomes inclusive
of the VP60 coding regions confirming that the U.S. isolates were indeed more closely related to isolates from
China than they were to each other (Figure 6B).

While the U.S. rabbit industry is clearly small as compared
to other livestock industries, increased trade in global
markets and the persistence and spread of RHD clearly
present a risk to the U.S. domestic rabbit industry and
larger rabbit industries elsewhere in the Americas. In this
regard, imports of live rabbits and raw rabbit products
from endemic regions present the most likely source for
RHD outbreaks in the Americas. Given the enigma surrounding the sudden origins of highly pathogenic RHDV
which first emerged in China in 1984 [22], and documented numerous instances of unpredictable shifts in
host specificity seen in emerging pathogens from other
virus families [49], it can be argued that exposure to
RHDVa posses a low-probability yet potential threat to
native American rabbits and other predatory animal species which may depend upon rabbits as a food source.
This would require an unexpected shift in host specificity
as RHDV is currently known only to cause disease in one
species of rabbit, O. cuniculus. Such unpredictable risks
however, should preclude the use of highly pathogenic
viruses as biocontrol agents.
Recent recoveries of RHDV genomic RNA and subsequent
phylogenetic studies on a portion of the VP60 coding
region, including European rabbits predating the emergence of highly pathogenic RHDV in China, have been
used to suggest that highly pathogenic RHDV may have
evolved from low pathogenic RHDV independently in
Europe and Asia [50-52]. These studies have focused only
on a very small portion of the VP60 capsid region and
genetic recombination between new and old RHDV in
Europe could still explain the emergence of highly pathogenic RHDV in Europe that retains similarities to VP60
sequences of low pathogenic RHDV predating 1984. Likewise it is possible that highly pathogenic RHDV originated in Europe and rapidly diverged in Asia beginning
with a very large outbreak infecting more than 200 million otherwise naive rabbits. An analysis of full genome
sequences, as we have undertaken for RHDVa, needs to be
undertaken in order to determine the origins of highly
pathogenic RHDV. With respect to the RHDVa pandemic
strain, none of the pre-1984 European isolates contain the
RHDVa variant epitope suggesting that perhaps, RHDVa
in Europe and elsewhere was acquired more recently from
Asia.
Like the emergence of highly pathogenic RHDV, the concurrent emergence of an RHDVa subtype in Asia and
Europe is quite analogous. RHDVa has been shown to be
replacing the original RHDV serotype in Europe [37] and
an original RHDV strain from China in 1984 (WX84
China, Figures 2 and 4) does not carry the RHDVa epitope
while later isolates employed in this study do carry the
RHDVa epitope (Figures 2 and 4). This fixation of RHDVa

RHDVa-specific epitope between residues 340 and 440 of the VP60 capsid protein. A portion of the CLUSTAL W
alignment of the VP60 sequence for 45 isolates of RHDV and 1 isolate of a non-pathogenic rabbit calicivirus (RCV) is shown.
The top reference sequence for the alignment came from the Brescia 1989 strain (BS89 Italy) and identical amino acids were
indicated by a dot. Note the large number of shared amino acid substitutions within the RHDVa clade (shaded blue).

in nature is in spite of the fact that much of Europe vaccinates rabbits with a vaccine that is experimentally able to
protect against both the original RHDV serotype and the
new RHDVa subtype [37]. Possible explanations for this
include carrier rabbits, either young rabbits which tend to
be asymptomatic [3] or chronically infected rabbits that
are subsequently vaccinated for RHDV. Such carriers
could generate escape mutants that might later become
amplified in unvaccinated animals. While a recent report
shows that viral genomes persist for several months in
vaccinated rabbits that have been experimentally infected
with RHDV [53], persistence of infectious virus and true
carrier state rabbits have yet to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is apparent that a selective advantage, perhaps

driven by the vaccine strain being of the original RHDV
serotype, is driving the fixation of the RHDVa epitope in
nature.

Conclusion
In summary, the USDA has identified four isolated outbreaks of RHD in the USA and determined complete
genome sequences for the viruses responsible. The most
recent of these occurred in June of 2005 in the state of
Indiana. Other outbreaks in the Americas include Mexico
in 1988 and more recently, in 2004, Uruguay and Cuba.
As with other RHDV isolates in Europe and Asia, the Indiana RHDV isolate was found to be highly pathogenic
resulting in hepatocellular necrosis, disseminated intra-

blood samples were collected for RT-PCR testing, and sera
were collected for AbELISA testing. Antibody and antigen
ELISA kits (OIE reference laboratory, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna,
Brescia, Italy) were used to assay serum and 10% liver
homogenates, respectively. Antigenic epitope analyses
were performed using RHDV and RHDVa subtype-specific
HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibodies [34,35] provided by Dr. Lorenzo Capucci (OIE reference laboratory)
and assayed on dilutions of 10% liver homogenates using
the RHDV antigen ELISA kit described above.

recognizes a shared epitope. The four U.S. RHDV isolates,
Mexico 1989 isolate, an Italian isolate, and Korean isolate

most closely related to isolates from China, and that they
belong to a pandemic antigenic variant strain known as
RHDVa that is currently spreading throughout Europe
despite implementation of an effective vaccine. This represents the first whole genome analysis and characterization of the RHDVa subtype. A close monitoring of RHDV
subtype differentiation and strengthening of efforts to
control the RHDVa pandemic should be undertaken to
forestall the evolution of a new serotype.

Methods
Animal Inoculation Study
Three SPF New Zealand white rabbits, free of RHDV reactive antibodies, (Millbrook Breeding Farms) were inoculated by intra-muscular injection with 1 ml of
homogenate, consisting of 10% w/v liver in 1 × PBS pH
6.4, derived from the index case of the 2005 Indiana RHD
outbreak. Body temperature, heparinarinized blood,
serum, nasal swabs, urinary tract swabs, and rectal swabs
were taken prior to inoculation and subsequently every 24
hr during the course of infection. Two animals succumbed
to the infection within 48 hr while the third fully recovered. Upon necropsy, spleen, lung, heart, and liver samples were collected for histopathology, transmission
electron microscopy, RT-PCR, and antigen ELISA. Nasal

Histopathology
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm thickness,
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, and
examined by light microscopy.
Electron Microscopy
For negative staining, liver homogenates were clarified by
centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C and virus
was concentrated from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at greater than 100,000 × g and 25 psi for 30 min
using a Beckman air-centrifuge. Virus pellets were re-suspended in 50 μl H2O applied to formvar-coated, carbonstablized grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and
stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid. Grids were examined with a T-7600 Hitachi electron microscope operating
at 80 kV and images were recorded with a digital camera
(AMT). For transmission electron microscopy, randomlyselected 2 mm × 1 cm × 1 mm pieces of rabbit liver fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin from the two affected
rabbits were re-fixed in a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 7.4 for 24 hrs at
4°C, post fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5%
potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and
stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Fixed tissues were dehydrated with an acetone series and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate [54]. Images of virus and
infected cells were captured as noted above and the mean
diameter of 100 virus particles was determined using AMT
measurement software.
RT-PCR and Genomic Sequencing of USA and Foreign
Isolates
For tissue and swab samples, total RNA was obtained
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.) and eluted in 40
μl H2O. For heparinized blood samples, 125 μl blood was
lysed in 125 μl of H2O and RNA was extracted by addition
of 750 μl of Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen), precipitated in
ethanol with 15 μg Glycoblue (Ambion Inc.) and resuspended in 30 μl H2O. In all instances, 10 μl RNA was
denatured at 65°C for 10 min and set on ice for 2 min

Relationship of U.S. isolates to genomes of other RHDV isolates
Relationship of U.S. isolates to genomes of other RHDV isolates. A. Genomes of RHDV isolates including the four
U.S. isolates were aligned in CLUSTAL W and 1000 bootstrap replicates were subjected to DNA Distance and Neighbor Joining methods. A consensus tree is shown with bootstrap values greater than 50% placed above tree branches. The U.S. isolates
all branched (100% of the time) with a distinct clade of RHDVa isolates from China (box). B. Analysis was repeated as shown
in panel A. except that the VP60 coding regions were removed from the genomic sequences. All U.S. isolates continued to
branch with the RHDVa isolates from China, despite removal of the RHDVa epitope.

prior to cDNA synthesis at 42°C for 45 min in a 40 μl
reaction using 50 ng·μl-1 random hexamers (Invitrogen),
250 μM deoxynucleotides (Sigma Chemical Co.), 0.5
units·μl-1 RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 10 mM dithiothreitol,
1× First Strand Synthesis Buffer and 5 units·μl-1 RT Superscript II (Invitrogen).
Diagnostic RT-PCR used for all of the U.S. RHD outbreaks
was performed on 10% liver homogenates using an RTPCR method directed against genome nucleotide positions 4588 to 4833 which represent a 246 bp portion of
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Following
cDNA synthesis samples were PCR amplified using Platinum Taq Supermix (Invitrogen), 1.2 μM primer 88 U
(CAAACGGAACTCACTAAAA) and 1.2 μM primer 315D
(CACGCCATCATCGCCATAC). Thermocycling conditions consisted of a single denaturing step at 95°C for 9
min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 45
sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a single 5 minute
extension at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose E-Gels (Invitrogen). Of note,
this protocol worked consistently on all tested isolates
except for UT01 (data not shown).
For viral genome sequencing, alignments of representative RHDV genomes from NCBI were generated using

CLUSTAL W [48] to select eight conserved primer pairs to
be used in the RT-PCR of overlapping fragments of the IN05, NY-01, UT-01, Korea-90, and Italy-90 isolates. PCR of
cDNA products were then gel extracted using a QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and directly subjected to automated nucleotide sequencing on an ABI nucleotide analyzer. Sequences from the 3' end of each genome were
determined by 3' RACE using an anchor primer 3'RAP:
GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(T)17 for reverse transcription followed by PCR with the 5'3'AMP primer:
GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC and a conserved forward
primer 3PForRHD: AGTGTTAAGATTTATAATACC. The 5'
end of UT-01, NY-01, IN-05, and ITALY-90 were obtained
by the 5' RACE. Random primed cDNA was tailed with
dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (Invitrogen) prior to PCR with the 5'RAP primer:
GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG and
a conserved reverse primer 5pRev2RHDV: CACAAGCAGACGTTGCCGAGAT. A second round of PCR using the
5'3'AMP primer and a conserved nested reverse primer
5pRevRHDV: CCACATTTGTCACATGTCACC were used
to amplify the 5' RHDV genomic ends prior to sequencing. The resulting double-strand sequence contigs were
generated using CAP3 [55] to achieve genome sequences
for UT-01, NY-01, IN-05, KOR 90, and ITALY 90. The
complete genome of the IA-00 RHDV isolate (GenBank

accession number AF258618) was determined previously.
Complete genome sequences for IA-00, UT-01, NY-01,
IN-05, Italy-90 and partial genomic sequence for Korea90 were submitted to Genbank™ under the accession
numbers AF258618, EU003582, EU003581, EU003578,
EU003579, and EU003580, respectively.
Phylogenetic Analyses
RHDV genomic sequences from 17 isolates were obtained
by RT-PCR and direct sequencing as described above or
from the NCBI database at Genbank and aligned using
CLUSTAL W [48]. As some of the genome sequences
lacked defined 5' or 3' termini, the 5' 74 nucleotides and
3' 56 nucleotides were trimmed from the alignment prior
to the assortment of sequences using BOOTSTRAP
(PHYLIP Ver. 3.66). One thousand bootstrap replicates
were subjected to DNA Distance and Neighbor joining
methods and a consensus phylogenetic tree was selected
using the CONSENSUS algorithm (PHYLIP Ver. 3.66).
DRAWTREE was used to display the results. For confirmation, the entire VP60 coding region was removed and the
RHDV genome sequence analysis was repeated by an
identical method.

For characterization of the VP60, the VP60 coding regions
of 45 RHDV isolates and 1 RCV isolate were obtained
from the NCBI database at Genbank or by direct sequencing as described above. The amino acid translations were
aligned in CLUSTAL W [48] and subjected to BOOTSTRAP. One thousand bootstrap replicates were subjected
to protein distance and UPGMA methods and a consensus
phylogenetic tree was selected using the CONSENSUS
algorithm (PHYLIP Ver. 3.66). DRAWTREE was used to
display the results.
