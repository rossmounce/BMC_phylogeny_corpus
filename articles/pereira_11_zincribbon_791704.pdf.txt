The zinc-ribbon domain of Helicobacter pylori
HP0958: requirement for RpoN accumulation and
possible roles of homologs in other bacteria
Lara E Pereira1, Jennifer Tsang2, Jan Mrázek2,3 and Timothy R Hoover2*

Abstract
Background: Helicobacter pylori HP0958 protein (FlgZ) prevents the rapid turnover of RpoN (s54), a transcription
factor required for expression of several flagellar genes in H. pylori. FlgZ possesses a zinc-ribbon domain (DUF164)
that contains two conserved CXXC motifs which coordinate a zinc ion and is thought to interact with nucleic acids
or proteins. Two conserved cysteine residues in FlgZ (Cys-202 and Cys-223) were replaced with serine to assess
their significance in FlgZ function. After confirming the importance of the CXXC motifs in the DUF164 domain of
FlgZ, the distribution of DUF164 proteins and RpoN homologs in other bacteria was examined to determine if a
correlation existed for the concurrence of the two proteins.
Results: Levels of RpoN were greatly reduced in H. pylori strains that expressed the FlgZC202S or FlgZC223S variants.
The FlgZC202S variant, but not the FlgZC223S variant, accumulated at levels similar to the wild-type protein. DUF164
proteins are not universally distributed and appear to be absent in several major bacterial taxa, including
Cyanobacteria as well as Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. With the exception of the Actinobacteria,
members of which generally lack RpoN, genes encoding DUF164 proteins and RpoN are frequently found in the
same genome. Interestingly, many of the DUF164 proteins in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes lack most or even
all of the conserved cysteine residues.
Conclusions: These findings suggest the importance of the zinc-ribbon domain of FlgZ in protecting RpoN from
turnover. Since many bacteria that possess a DUF164 protein also contain RpoN, DUF164 proteins may have roles
in RpoN protection or function in other bacteria.

Background
Helicobacter pylori is a member of the Epsilonproteobacteria that colonizes the human gastric mucosa where
it causes a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including
acute gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, B cell MALT
lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma [1-3]. Colonization of the gastric mucosa by H. pylori requires the bacterium to be motile [4,5], which is achieved through a
cluster of polar sheathed flagella.
The bacterial flagellum is a complex structure consisting of three basic substructures - the basal body, hook
and filament. Dozens of genes are required for flagellar

biogenesis and the expression of these genes is regulated
by a transcriptional hierarchy in which genes are
expressed as their products are needed for assembly
[6,7]. All three of the RNA polymerase sigma (s) factors
in H. pylori are involved in flagellar biogenesis. In general, genes needed early in flagellar assembly are under
control of the primary s factor RpoD (s80), while RpoN
(s 54 ) is responsible for transcription of genes needed
midway through flagellar assembly and transcription of
late flagellar genes is dependent on FliA (s28) [8-13].
Transcriptional activation of the RpoN-dependent
flagellar genes in H. pylori requires the response regulator FlgR and its cognate histidine kinase FlgS [12,14].
Although the signaling pathway that regulates expression of the RpoN flagellar regulon is poorly understood,

transcriptional control of the regulon has been shown to
be intimately associated with the flagellar protein export
apparatus in H. pylori and its close relative Campylobacter jejuni [10,15-18]. Transcription of the H. pylori
RpoN regulon also requires the putative RpoN chaperone and zinc-ribbon domain protein HP0958 [19,20],
which we hereafter refer to as FlgZ (flagellar-associated
zinc-ribbon domain protein).
FlgZ was originally identified as interacting with RpoN
in a high-throughput screen of a yeast two-hybrid system [21]. Subsequently, FlgZ was shown to be required
for motility in H. pylori [19,20] and to prevent the rapid
turnover of RpoN - the half-life of RpoN is > 4 hours in
wild type compared to ~30 minutes in the flgZ mutant
[19]. FlgZ may have additional roles in H. pylori motility
as it also interacts with the flagellar protein export apparatus protein FliH in the yeast two-hybrid system [21].
In addition, Douillard and co-workers showed that FlgZ
binds flaA transcript (flaA encodes the major flagellin of
H. pylori) and is needed for optimal production of FlaA
[22]. These researchers proposed that FlgZ may work
together with FliH to direct flaA transcripts to the basal
body of the nascent flagellum to couple the translation
and secretion of FlaA [22]. Although FlgZ may play a
direct role in the expression and export of FlaA, this
activity is not essential for motility since overproduction
of RpoN suppresses the motility defect of the flgZ mutation [19].
FlgZ is a 254 amino acid polypeptide and a recently
solved crystal structure of the protein revealed that it
consists of a highly elongated, kinked coiled-coil hairpin
domain (resides 1-170) followed by a zinc-ribbon
domain (residues 174-238) [23]. FlgZ is a member of a
family of proteins which contain a predicted zinc-ribbon
domain of unknown function (PF02591; COG1579).
Most members of this protein family, including FlgZ,
contain the motif Y/F_X18-23_ CXXC_X18-26_CXXC, in
which the conserved cysteine residues coordinate a zinc
ion [23]. Zinc fingers function as interaction modules
that bind DNA, RNA, proteins or small molecules
[24-28]. Given the potential for FlgZ to act as both an
RpoN chaperone and a RNA chaperone in a coupled
translation-protein secretion process [19,22], it is
unclear which of these functions is associated with the
FlgZ zinc-ribbon domain.
To examine the issue of whether the zinc-ribbon
domain of FlgZ is needed to protect RpoN from turnover in H. pylori, we changed two of the conserved
cysteine residues in FlgZ (Cys-202 and Cys-223) to serine residues and examined the phenotypes of H. pylori
strains expressing the FlgZ variants. Strains expressing
either the FlgZ C202S or FlgZ C223S variant were nonmotile and had reduced levels of RpoN, indicating the
importance of these conserved cysteine residues in the

function or stability of FlgZ. A search of bacterial genome sequences revealed that homologs of FlgZ (characterized by the presence of the DUF164) are widespread
among bacterial species, but appear to be absent in several major taxonomic groups. In many taxonomic
groups there is a statistically significant correlation
between the presence of FlgZ homologs and RpoN, suggesting a role for FlgZ homologs in RpoN function in a
diverse set of bacteria.

Results and discussion
Conserved cysteine residues in the zinc-ribbon domain of
FlgZ are important for function and stability

To determine if the conserved cysteine residues in the
zinc-ribbon domain of FlgZ are critical for the function
of the protein, mutations were introduced in each of
the conserved CXXC motifs and the phenotypes of
strains expressing the resulting FlgZ variants were
examined. The conserved cysteine residues in H. pylori
26695 FlgZ are Cys-199, Cys-202, Cys-223 and Cys226. Cys-202 and Cys-223 were changed to serine residues and the resulting FlgZ variants were expressed in
a mutant strain of H. pylori 43504 in which flgZ
(hp0958) was disrupted with a kanamycin-resistance
cassette. As shown in Figure 1A and reported previously, disruption of flgZ in H. pylori resulted in a
loss of motility and reduced RpoN levels [19]. Wildtype FlgZ expressed from the hp0405 locus in the flgZ
mutant restored motility and supported wild-type
levels of RpoN and FlaB (Figure 1B). FlaB is a minor
flagellin whose expression is dependent on RpoN
[10,12,29], and levels of this flagellin were reduced in
the flgZ mutant. In contrast to wild-type FlgZ, the
FlgZC202S and FlgZC223S variants failed to restore motility or support wild-type levels of RpoN and FlaB.
Western blot analysis showed that the FlgZC202S variant was expressed at near wild-type levels in H. pylori.
Taken together, these data suggest that the zinc-ribbon
domain of FlgZ has a role in protecting RpoN from
turnover. It is unclear if the FlgZC202S variant is defective in binding RpoN or in a subsequent step needed
to protect RpoN from turnover.
In contrast to the FlgZC202S variant, the FlgZC223S variant was not expressed stably in H. pylori. DNA sequencing of the flgZ allele encoding the FlgZ C223S variant
failed to reveal any additional mutations, suggesting that
the serine substitution at Cys-223 decreases the stability
of the protein. Caly and co-workers [23] reported that
changing Cys-199 of FlgZ to alanine did not significantly
alter the structure of the protein as assessed by circular
dichroism. Taken together, these observations suggest
substitutions in the second CXXC motif have a more
profound effect on the structure of FlgZ than those in
the first CXXC motif, while substitutions in either of

the two CXXC motifs result in reduced RpoN levels and
loss of motility.
Taxonomic distribution of proteins containing the
DUF164

Having demonstrated the importance of at least one of
the conserved cysteine residues within the DUF164 of
FlgZ in protecting RpoN from turnover in H. pylori, we
wished to determine if DUF164 proteins in other bacteria could have a role in RpoN function similar to that
of FlgZ. To address this issue we investigated if the presence of a FlgZ homolog in a genome correlated with
that of RpoN. For this purpose, we defined FlgZ homologs as proteins containing the DUF164 domain
(PF02519), whereas all proteins belonging to the
COG1508 according to the IMG annotations were considered RpoN homologs. We performed our analysis
with a dataset restricted to finished genome sequences
as well as the complete collection of both finished and
draft sequences with the caveat that the apparent
absence of either gene in a draft genome could be due

to gaps in sequence coverage. The results of the analysis, which are summarized in Table 1 revealed several
intriguing trends.
First, proteins characterized by the presence of the
DUF164 are essentially restricted to the domain Bacteria as there are no representatives in the domain
Archaea and only one in the domain Eukaryota. The
sole eukaryotic protein is present in the sac fungus
Phaeosphaeria nodorum SN15, and it differs substantially from FlgZ in both its size (571 amino acids in
length versus 254 amino acids) and the presence of a
SET domain (PF00856). Second, several bacterial taxonomic groups that are well represented in the JGI
IMG database, such as Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and
Tenericutes, lack proteins that contain DUF164
(Table 1). Third, with only one exception, bacteria do
not possess more than one DUF164 protein. The only
exception we found in the database was Opitutus
terrae PB90-1 (phylum Verrucomicrobia) which has
two DUF164 proteins.

As shown in Table 1 DUF164 proteins are found in a
broad range of taxonomic groups. While members of
many of these groups, including Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Chlorobi, Planctomycetes, Deltaproteobacteria,
Epsilonproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia, often possess RpoN, members of Actinobacteria and
Thermi typically lack RpoN. Indeed, homologs of rpoN

are present in only two of 182 Actinobacteria genomes
and none of the eight Thermi genomes in the JGI IMG
database, indicating that the DUF164 proteins in these
bacteria are obviously not involved in RpoN function.
We used the Fisher exact test to determine if there
was a statistically significant association between
DUF164 proteins and RpoN. The data from Table 1

Pereira et al. Microbial Informatics and Experimentation 2011, 1:8
http://www.microbialinformaticsj.com/content/1/1/8

were combined in a single 2-by-2 contingency table
where the lines and columns contained the counts of
genomes that possess and lack DUF164 proteins and
RpoN, respectively. The online probability calculator
from Vassar College (available at http://faculty.vassar.
edu/lowry/VassarStats.html) was used to calculate the
probabilities. One-tail probabilities obtained from the
Fisher exact test close to zero (p < 0.05) indicate significant tendency of DUF164 and RpoN proteins to
occur in the same genomes whereas probabilities close
to 1 indicate a significant mutual avoidance of the two
proteins. Analysis of the total finished genome
sequences failed to reveal a significant tendency of
DUF164 and RpoN to occur in the same genomes (p =
0.30). Analysis of a data set that included all of the finished genomes except the Actinobacteria genomes,
however, indicated a significant tendency of DUF164
and RpoN proteins to occur in the same genomes (p <
10 -13 ). A statistically significant association between
DUF164 and RpoN proteins was also noted within the
phylum Firmicutes (p < 10-5), where DUF164 proteins
appear to be restricted to members of the class Clostridia (Table 1). The strong correlation between the presence of RpoN and DUF164 proteins in many bacterial
genomes raises the possibility that, as with FlgZ,
DUF164 proteins in these bacteria have a role in RpoN
function.
Bacteria in taxonomic groups whose members generally possess both DUF164 and RpoN proteins often
employ RpoN in unconventional ways. For example, H.
pylori FlgR differs from most activators of s 54 -RNA
polymerase holoenzyme (s 54 -holoenzyme) in that it
lacks an enhancer-binding (i.e., DNA-binding) domain
and activates transcription independently of an enhancer
[29]. Many members of the Epsilonproteobacteria, Chlamydiae and Bacteroidetes groups similarly possess
RpoN-dependent activators that lack enhancer-binding
domains and presumably function as enhancer-independent activators [30-32]. Moreover, the RpoN-dependent
activators Campylobacter jejuni FlgR (subphylum Epsilonproteobacteria) and Borrelia burgdorferi Rrp2 (phylum Spirochaetes) have been shown to activate
transcription in an enhancer-independent manner
[31,33]. Based on these comparisons, it is intriguing to
speculate that FlgZ homologs may stimulate enhancerindependent transcriptional activation (which is presumably less efficient than enhancer-dependent transcription) in these bacteria. For instance, FlgZ homologs
could facilitate interactions between RpoN and core
RNA polymerase to increase the concentration of s54holoenzyme in the cell, resulting in increased promoter
occupancy and allow for greater opportunity for productive interactions between the activator and s 54 holoenzyme.

Page 5 of 10

Along a similar line of reasoning, competition among
sigma factors for core RNA polymerase is an important
factor in gene regulation [34]. If FlgZ and its homologs
function as RpoN chaperones, such activity may allow
RpoN to compete effectively with other sigma factors
for binding RNA polymerase. This could be important
for RpoN function in members of the Deltaproteobacteria which typically have exceptional numbers of
RpoN-dependent activators (Myxococcus xanthus has
~50 different activators) and where RpoN is a significant
global regulator in these bacteria [35,36].
Architectural features of DUF164 proteins

Divergence of DUF164 in different bacterial lineages was
investigated using alignments of DUF164 proteins
downloaded from the Sanger Institute website for
PF02591 (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF02591).
Interestingly, many DUF164 proteins (43 out of 349 in
the full dataset) lack one or more of the conserved
cysteine residues. Most of these proteins are from bacteria belonging to either the phylum Actinobacteria or
Bacteroidetes, as illustrated by Figure 2. In some cases,
DUF164 proteins lack all four of the conserved cysteine
residues (indicated by four stars in Figure 2). For example, DUF164 proteins from Flavobacteria (phylum Bacteroidetes) generally have the motif SXXS_X20_ DXXS
instead of the two CXXC motifs. Given the absence of
the CXXC motifs in these proteins, it is unclear if they
bind zinc ions or have functions similar to that of FlgZ.
The domain organization for the 349 DUF164 proteins
displayed in the Pfam database shows that the DUF164
domain is near the C-terminus in all the proteins in the
database. All but three of the DUF164 proteins in the
Pfam database are similar to FlgZ in that they possess a
predicted coiled-coil domain near the N-terminus and
lack other defined protein family domains. A notable
exception to this architectural arrangement is the
DUF164 protein from the Epsilonproteobacterium Wolinella succinogenes WS2117 which also contains a
domain belonging to the NIF3 (NGG1p interacting factor 3) family (PF01784; COG0327). NIF3 interacts with
the yeast transcriptional co-activator NGG1p, but the
significance of this interaction is not known [37]. A
gene encoding a NIF3 domain protein (hp0959) is
located immediately upstream of flgZ in H. pylori
(Figure 3A), suggesting a gene fusion event occurred in
W. succinogenes. Gene fusion events are among the best
predictors of protein-protein interactions [38]. HP0959,
however, is not required for motility or RpoN stability
in H. pylori (Figure 1A; and [19]), and we do not have
any independent evidence regarding direct physical
interaction between HP0959 and FlgZ. It may be that
the DUF164 and NIF3 domains function together in
some capacity which is unique to W. succinogenes. W.

succinogenes appears to utilize RpoN to control expression of nitrogen-fixation (nif) genes in addition to flagellar genes. W. succinogenes also differs from H. pylori in
that it possesses a second rpoN gene which appears to
be part of an operon that includes several nif genes. It is
possible that the NIF3 and DUF164 domains in W. succinogenes function together to modulate the activity or
level of this second RpoN protein.

Since genes associated with the same cellular system or
process are often co-localized in bacterial genomes, we
used the JGI IMG ortholog neighborhood viewer tool to
examine the gene neighborhoods surrounding flgZ
orthologs to gain additional insight into their potential

functions. As indicated previously, the gene upstream of
H. pylori flgZ encodes a protein with a NIF3 domain.
This gene arrangement is present in all of the Epsilonproteobacteria genomes in which a flgZ ortholog was
unambiguously identified, as well as the genomes of several more distantly related bacteria, including members
of Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and
several clostridia (Figure 3B). As discussed previously
and shown in Figure 1A, the NIF3 domain protein is
not required for motility or protection of RpoN from
turnover in H. pylori. This does not rule out the possibility that the NIF3 domain protein functions with FlgZ in
some other capacity in H. pylori or that the NIF3 and
DUF164 domains might work together in other bacteria.
In many diverse bacterial species, genes encoding proteins containing DUF164 are closely associated with

Pereira et al. Microbial Informatics and Experimentation 2011, 1:8

rpoD (encodes the primary sigma factor) and dnaG
(encodes DNA primase) (Figure 3B). These bacteria
included representative species of Spirochaetes (12
unique species), Planctomycetes (3 species), Firmicutes
(7 species), Nitrospirae (1 species), Deferribacteres (1
species), and Deltaproteobacteria (8 species). The rpoD
genes in these bacteria are located upstream of the gene
encoding the DUF164 protein and may be part of the
same operon. Given the close association of these genes
it is possible that DUF164 proteins in these bacteria
have roles in the function of the primary sigma factor.

Conclusions
DUF164 proteins are widespread among bacteria, but
the functions of these proteins are virtually unknown.
To the best of our knowledge H. pylori FlgZ is the only
member for which functions have been ascribed. Results
presented here suggest the importance of the DUF164
of FlgZ in protecting RpoN from turnover. Given the
co-occurrence of DUF164 and RpoN proteins in many
bacterial genomes, we anticipate that DUF164 proteins
have a role in RpoN function in other bacteria besides
H. pylori. It is clear, however, that DUF164 proteins play
other roles in some bacteria, such as the Actinobacteria,
which lack RpoN. It is not unusual for bacteria to
recruit existing genomic features to adopt additional
functions, and the analysis of taxonomical distribution
of FlgZ and RpoN homologs suggests that this may have
been the case in the evolution of FlgZ. It is possible that
the ancestral FlgZ had another function, which has been
retained in some present-day bacteria, and adopted a
new role in RpoN protection and flagellar regulation in
some lineages. However, the decay of the CXXC motifs
in some Actinobacteria and other phyla may indicate an
alternative scenario where FlgZ homologs in these bacteria adopted a new function that does not require zinc
coordination.

Campylobacter coli chloramphenicol transacetylase (cat)
gene for selection of recombinants. A derivative of plasmid pEU39 Cm that carries a ~1.5-kb DNA fragment
bearing flgZ (hp0958) and most of the upstream gene
(hp0959) from H. pylori 26695 was constructed as
described previously [19]. Mutations were introduced in
flgZ carried on this plasmid using the QuickChange II
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)
as per the supplier’s instructions. Sequences for the
mutagenic primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were: 5’-CAGGCTTGTGGGGGTAGCTTTATTCGGTTGATGATAAG-3’ and 5’-CTTATCATTC
AACCGAATAAAGCTACCCCCACAAGCCTG-3’ to
change Cys-202 to serine; and 5’-CGAGTGGGGATATGATCACTAGCCCGTATTGCGGGCG-3’ and 5’-CGC
CCGCAATACGGGCTAGTGATCATATCCCCACTC
G-3’ to change Cys-223 to serine (sites where changes
were introduced are underlined). The flgZ alleles were
sequenced by the Georgia Genomics Facility at the
University of Georgia to confirm that the correct mutations had been introduced and that no other mutations
had been introduced inadvertently. Plasmids bearing the
mutant flgZ alleles were introduced by natural transformation into a H. pylori ATCC 43504 containing a flgZ:
aphA3 mutation [19]. Recombinants were selected on
TSA supplemented with serum and chloramphenicol and
the presence of the flgZ alleles in the hp0405 locus was
confirmed by PCR.
Motility assays

Motility agar plates consisted of Mueller-Hinton broth
supplemented with 5% horse serum and 0.35% agar.
Sterile toothpicks were used to inoculate motility agar
with H. pylori strains. Motility of H. pylori strains was
scored after incubating plates at 37®C under an atmosphere of 4% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 91% nitrogen for 4 to 5 days.

Methods

Western blot analysis

Bacterial strains and media

Escherichia coli DH5a was used for routine cloning procedures and was grown in Luria-Bertani broth or agar
medium at 37®C. H. pylori ATCC 43504 and its derivatives were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with 5% horse serum and grown at 37®C under an
atmosphere of 4% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 91%
nitrogen. When required, medium was supplemented
with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol or kanamycin.

Immunoblotting with primary antibodies directed
against maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions to FlgZ,
RpoN or FlaB was done as described previously [19,29].
Antibodies directed against MBP-RpoN were affinity
purified prior to use as described [19]. Primary antibodies bound to proteins immobilized on the membranes
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using
peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, ID).

Analysis of genome sequences

Plasmid pEU39 Cm [39] is a suicide vector used to
introduce DNA into the H. pylori hp0405 locus (encodes
a NifS-like protein). The plasmid carries part of hp0405
that has been disrupted with a cassette containing a

FlgZ and RpoN homologs were identified from the United States Department of Energy’s JGI IMG and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pfam databases [40,41].
Genes surrounding flgZ homologs were analyzed using

the JGI ortholog neighborhood viewer tool. The taxonomical distribution of FlgZ and RpoN homologs was
compiled from data downloaded from the IMG database
using an in-house computer program.
