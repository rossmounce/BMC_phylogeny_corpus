Abstract
Background: Composting is one of the methods utilised in recycling organic communal waste.
The composting process is dependent on aerobic microbial activity and proceeds through a
succession of different phases each dominated by certain microorganisms. In this study, a ligationdetection-reaction (LDR) based microarray method was adapted for species-level detection of
compost microbes characteristic of each stage of the composting process. LDR utilises the
specificity of the ligase enzyme to covalently join two adjacently hybridised probes. A zip-oligo is
attached to the 3'-end of one probe and fluorescent label to the 5'-end of the other probe. Upon
ligation, the probes are combined in the same molecule and can be detected in a specific location
on a universal microarray with complementary zip-oligos enabling equivalent hybridisation
conditions for all probes. The method was applied to samples from Nordic composting facilities
after testing and optimisation with fungal pure cultures and environmental clones.
Results: Probes targeted for fungi were able to detect 0.1 fmol of target ribosomal PCR product
in an artificial reaction mixture containing 100 ng competing fungal ribosomal internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) area or herring sperm DNA. The detection level was therefore approximately 0.04%
of total DNA. Clone libraries were constructed from eight compost samples. The LDR microarray
results were in concordance with the clone library sequencing results. In addition a control probe
was used to monitor the per-spot hybridisation efficiency on the array.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the LDR microarray method is capable of sensitive and
accurate species-level detection from a complex microbial community. The method can detect key
species from compost samples, making it a basis for a tool for compost process monitoring in
industrial facilities.

Background
Composting is one of the principal methods to treat separately collected biodegradable waste. In composting,

organic material is aerobically decomposed into humuslike material by bacteria, fungi and, to a lesser extent,
other larger organisms [1]. To understand the composting

process and the ecological processes of composting, the
microbes present in the process need to be tracked. The
compost microbiota have been characterised with a variety of molecular and cultivation based methods in both
laboratory and full-scale processes (e.g. [2-6]. In order to
follow the industrial composting process and to confirm
the hygienisation of the compost, the microbiology needs
to be understood and followed. Several approaches has
been used to resolve compost microbiology, such as single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) [7],
automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) [5]
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) [3,4] and
cloning and sequencing (Hultman et al. unpublished, Partanen et al. unpublished). Common to the technologies
mentioned above is that they are rather time consuming
and not suitable for routine determination of compost
microbiota.
DNA microarrays have been widely used in studying gene
expression for over 15 years. In addition, they present a
promising approach for large scale microbial community
analysis due to high-throughput at relatively low costs in
contrast to methods relying on sequencing and culturing.
Lately, the oligucleotide microarrays have been utilised in
microbial species detection from various environments
such as landfill methanotrophs [8,9], sulphate reducers
[10] acidophiles [11] and composts [12]. The problems of
oligonucleotide microarrays are largely due to the low
hybridisation specificity which are not easily improved
since increasing the length of the probes decreases specificity (reviewed in [13]). Also, the detection limit has been
regularly reported to be around a 1% fraction of the total
DNA [12,10]. Recently, detection levels of 0.1% have
been reported [14,15] but these studies are not in every
case applicable in environmental microbiology. Highthroughput phylogenetic arrays can provide a fingerprint
of the community under analysis, but are less optimal for
species-level detection as the discriminatory power of oligonucleotide probes might not be good enough for distinguishing all the closely related species [8]. In this type of
array design, the probes typically detect multiple targets
requiring many probes per single target to make specieslevel detection possible [14,16]. Another type of microarrays widely used are the functional microarray by which
the physiological status and functional activities of microbial communities can be analysed [17]. An example of the
functional array is the GeoChip by He and coworkers [18]
that contains probes for over 10 000 genes essential to various biogeochemical cycles.
Compost is an example of a microbial community in
which the presence of certain key species is an important
indicator of the functional status of the system. Detecting
closely related species reliably from a complex sample
requires high specificity and sensitivity in high-through-

put format, making microarrays a promising platform for
this kind of task. Enzymatic ligation based methods in
microarray format have been used successfully in detection of environmental microbes at genus level [19-21].
The reaction is performed separately from the array
hybridisation enabling the use of address oligos (other
terms are tag or zip) to equalize probe hybridisation conditions. The enzymatic ligation step is the main source of
specificity making it easier to design probes for highly
similar targets.
The principle of detecting specific DNA templates by
enzymatic ligation was developed to overcome the limitations of oligomeric hybridisation probes in distinguishing
single base mutations associated with genetic diseases
[22,23]. The method relies on the high selectivity of a
ligase which requires perfect complementarity of dsDNA
structure to successfully catalyze the covalent joining of
two adjacently hybridised probes. The probes constitute a
target-specific probe pair, which becomes detectable only
if the probes are linked together. The so called discriminating probe is designed such that the 3'-end matches the
target at a unique position which contains a nucleotide
that distinguishes the target from other species. The common probe is designed to hybridise adjacent to the discriminating probe enabling ligation if an appropriate
target is present in the reaction mixture. Ligation products
can be linearly or exponentially amplified in thermal
cycling using thermostabile ligase [23], or in PCR following ligation [24]. In the universal microarray approach
(Fig. 1), the common probe has a 3'-tag sequence (cZip
code) which directs it to the right address on the array,
while the discriminating probe is fluorescently labelled
[25,19]. The advantages of the universal array lie in the
uniform hybridisation conditions of all zip sequences,
and in flexibility as the same array platform can be used
with multiple ligation probe sets. The potential for high
specificity and sensitivity makes ligation based detection
techniques a promising tool not only for mutation screening but also for characterising complex microbial communities [19,21,26].
In this study, the LDR method was adapted to study
microbes in compost samples. The focus was on the fungal communities of the composting process. The composition of communities correlates with efficiency of
composting measured by various physical and chemical
parameters (Hultman et al. unpublished, Partanen et al.
unpublished). The aim of this study was to modify the
LDR method into a more robust direction. In addition,
the sensitivity and specificity of the probes and the array
tests with closely similar fungal pure cultures and spiked
clones in known concentrations were further evaluated.
To overcome the problem of determining the desired signal level for positive hybridisation, the use of a control

probe was tested in each printed spot. Finally, the method
was used for eight compost samples taken from compost
facilities in Finland, Norway and Sweden, from which
clone libraries were constructed and sequenced to be used
as a verification of the microarray hybridisation results.

Methods
Zip-code oligos
For printing, the zip sequence containing oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligomer Ltd (Helsinki, Finland). Each oligonucleotide carries a (dT)9 at the 5' end
followed by the hybridisation control sequence (5'TCAATGCACTGAGCCCGAGA-3'), poly(dT)3, a zip-code
sequence and finally a poly(dT)3at the 3' end. The zipcode sequences and the hybridisation control probe
sequence were selected from the Affymetrix GenFlex Tag
Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) data file, which was
downloaded from the Affymetrix website.
Probes
The probes were targeted to the ribosomal RNA of fungi.
The studied area was the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
region of ribosomal RNA, comprising of the conserved
5.8S rRNA gene and variable flanking ITS1 and ITS2
regions. The rRNA sequences for all of the target and reference species were collected by sequencing [Hultman et
al. unpublished, [27,28]] or from public databases. An

alignment containing in total 11881 fungal ITS sequences
was built with ARB software using ClustalW algorithm
[29]. From the sequence alignment, unique discriminating nucleotides were identified for each target species and
the LDR probes were designed such that the 3' position of
each species specific probe matched the discriminating
nucleotide of the target species. The common probes were
located immediately after the discriminating probes
according to the corresponding target sequences. The Tm's
were set to 65°C calculating with NetPrimer software
http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/index.html.
The probes were searched with BLAST [30] against all public nucleotide sequence databases and discriminating
probes were discarded from further use if an extensive 3'
end similarity to non-target sequence was found. The discriminating probe was equipped with a Cy3 molecule in
the 5' position. The common probes contained a phosphate in the 5' terminal position and a complementary
zip-code (czip-code) in the 3' end. The complementary
hybridisation control probe B3 (Table 1) was purchased
with 5' Fam dye. The oligos were purchased from Oligomer Oy (Helsinki, Finland).
Array and printing solution testing
The first microarrays were printed on four different glass
types with eight printing solutions in order find the most
suitable combination. Two identical subarrays were

printed on each slide. The microarray slides used were
Nexterion slide A, Nexterion slide A+, Nexterion slide E
(Schott Nexterion, Mainz, Germany) and Corning Ultra
GAPS (Corning Life Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands).
Buffers used were 6 × SSC, 2 × Micro spotting solution
(MSS; TeleChem International, CA, USA), 2 × Micro spotting plus (MSP, TeleChem International), 2 × Nexterion
spot III (Schott), 2 × Nexterion spot (Schott), 1 × LEB I, 1
× LEB II and 1 × LEB III (Schott). Final concentration of
the buffers was 1× with the exception of 6 × SSC which
was printed in concentration 3×. The probe concentration
in the printing buffer was 50 μM. Quality control to the
different slide types was made by hybridising one subarray with labelled complementary hybridisation control

and another subarray was stained with SYBR Green II RNA
Gel Stain (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The slides were scanned
with GenePix Autoloader 4200AL scanner (Molecular
Devices, CA, USA) using wavelength 488 nm and quantified by GenePix (Molecular Devices).
The second slide batch was made on Nexterion A-slides
with three printing buffers (MSP, MSS and Nexterion 3)
with two identical subarrays per slide. Final batch of slides
was made on Nexterion Slide A MPX 16 with MSS-printing buffer since it appeared to be the best combination,
giving good signal and spot quality. Sixteen identical subarrays were printed on the slide. All slides were printed in
the Biomedicum Biochip Center, University of Helsinki,

Finland, and after printing the slides were UV cross-linked
with 1000 × 1000 μJ of 254 nm UV light (UV Stratalinker
2400, Stratagene, CA, USA).
Sample preparation
The samples used to test the LDR probes were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of strains kept in our culture collections or from environmental clone libraries. The pure
culture DNA was extracted with commercial kit (MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification Kit, Epicentre, WI, USA). The
fungal strains were grown on malt extract agar, DG18, or
potato carrot agar. After 7 days growing at 25°C, all plates
were examined macroscopically and microscopically to
check for purity and correct identification. In case of contamination, strains were recultivated. Microscopic identification was based on colony morphology, i.e. their
growth habit, structure, colour, mycelium and spores. The
identification based on morphology was done at genus
level, sometimes at species level. In addition, the ITS1and ITS2-regions of all strains were sequenced to confirm
the identification. Spores from well-grown and verified
cultures on agar plates were collected in buffer solution
and stored at -80°C. The PCR amplification was performed with primers Fun18f (Hultman et al. unpublished) and ITS4 [31] in 50-μl volume containing 1×
Dynazyme buffer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), dNTP
solution (200 μM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP),
0.5 μM primers, 1 U DNA polymerase (DynazymeII,
Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and varying amount of template DNA. The PCR reaction was carried out in a thermocycler (MJ Research, MA, USA) under the following
conditions: denaturation of 5 min at 94°C, followed by
25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45
s, with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products
were purified with MultiScreen PCR384purification plates
(Millipore, MA, USA).
Ligation
The LDR was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1× ligation buffer (TAQ ligase buffer, New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 30 mM tetramethylammonium
chloride (TMAC), 250 fmol of each discriminating probe,
250 fmol of each common probe, 5 pmol of the complementary hybridisation control probe, and a variable
amount of purified PCR products. After the reaction mixture was preheated for 2 min at 94°C and centrifuged for
1 min, 4 U of Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) was
added. The LDR was cycled for 40 rounds at 94°C for 30
s and at 64°C for 4 min in a thermocycler (MJ Research)

In the testing phase of the method the success of the ligation was visualised with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, MINI-protean 3 cell, Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Ligation products were denatured and 20 ul was loaded
on 18% PAGE gel with 10 ul of formamide and 3 ul of 10×

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/237

gel loading dye. The gel was run at 200V for 1 h, stained
with SYBR Green II RNA Gel Stain and visualised with a
Dark Reader instrument (Clare Chemical research, CO,
USA).
Template and probe testing
Ligation sensitivity was validated by titrating the PCRproducts serving as templates for ligation to 10 fmol, 1
fmol, 0.1 fmol and 0.01 fmol. In addition, spiking experiments were done with the same template volumes but
either 100 ng of Herring sperm DNA or genomic DNA
from various Penicillium species used as a background
DNA. Ligation and hybridisation were performed as
described above and the titration experiments were conducted as well. The probe specificity was tested in hybridisation with all of the 17 probe pairs (Table 1.) and one of
the templates for all of the matching templates individually.
Hybridisation, washing and scanning
In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, the LDR mix (20 μl) was
diluted to obtain 40 μl of hybridization mixture containing 5× SSC and 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. After heating the mix to 94°C for 2 min and chilling on ice, ligation
control probe was added and the mix was applied onto
the slide according to slide manufacturer's instructions.
Hybridization was carried out in the dark at 50°C for two
hours, in a temperature controlled hybridisation oven.
After hybridisation, the microarray was washed for 3 × 15
min in 0,1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and briefly with water. Finally,
the slide was dried in a table centrifuge. The fluorescent
signal was detected at 5 um resolution using a GenePix
Autoloader 4200AL laser scanning system with green laser
for Cy3 dye (ex 543 nm/em 570 nm, LDR-probe) and
blue laser for 6-FAM (ex/em 488, control probe B3). Both
the laser and the photomultiplier (PMT) tube power were
set at 100%. GenePix program version 6.0 was used to
quantitate the fluorescent signal from each spot.
Microarray data-analysis
The data were analysed using R statistical environment v.
2.6.2 [32]. Package Marray v. 1.16.0 [33] from the Bioconductor project [34] was used to manage the microarray
data in R. The negative values resulting from subtracting
local background values from each spot in a subarray were
substituted with median value calculated from the spots
without LDR probe in the subarray. Missing spots were
identified as having values more than 2 standard deviations below median. LDR signal in a spot was substituted
with median value of spots without LDR probe if the corresponding B3 control probe value was identified as missing. The log ratio of LDR and B3 signals was calculated for
each spot. Spots with no LDR probe were used as a background set against which spot replicates of each probe
were compared. Spots with ratios over 2.5 SD of back-

ground median were identified as positive. The R-scripts
are available from authors upon request.
Validation with compost samples
DNA was extracted with Fast prep for soil kit (Irvine, CA,
USA) from ten compost samples (Table 2.) from full-scale
facilities in Norway, Sweden and in Finland [35,36]. The
samples, used here as reference samples, were produced
and mainly analysed as part of a Nordic composting
project [35,36]. The samples NK05 to NK10 were from the
research reactor. The reactor experiments (200-liter) were
temperature and oxygen controlled and during the run the
process was allowed to self-heat to 37°C but thereafter
cooled to keep the temperature below 40°C until the pH
was above 6 when the temperature was increased to 55°C.
By controlling the temperature, the acidic phase was rapidly overcome as the efficient decomposition started and
the effect of the inhibitory acids at low pH was avoided
[37]. The oxygen concentration was kept at 16%. Samples
from NK05 to NK07 were sequential during the composting process where the temperature was set to 55°C. Clone
libraries were constructed from samples NK06 and NK07.
Samples NK08, NK09 and NK10 were from a process
where the temperature was gradually increased starting on
day 9 to reach 70°C. The sample NK08 was taken on day
0 from the waste material to be composted. Samples
NK12 and NK14 were from two batches in a Norwegian
facility with agitated beds. Sample NK12 was from with a
batch where the temperature was about 60°C most of the
time, but below 50°C during the last week before sampling, and sample NK14 was from a batch where the temperature was 60–70°C. Sample NK19, taken from a
composting plant in Finland, was from a compost tunnel
with floor area of 110 m2 and filled with 140 t of biowaste
and 40 t of structure material. At the time of sampling,
reduced aeration was used in order to prevent the drying
of the compost. Sampling was performed as described by
Sundberg et al. [35].

The PCR amplification was performed in triplicate with
primers Fun18f (Hultman et al. unpublished) and ITS4
[28] in 50-μl volume containing 1× Phusion GC buffer
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), dNTP solution (200 μM of
each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 0.5 μM primers, 5%
DMSO, 1U DNA polymerase (Phusion, Finnzymes,
Espoo, Finland) and varying amount of template DNA.
The PCR reaction was carried out in a thermocycler (MJ
Research) under the following conditions: denaturation
of 30 s at 98°C, followed by 25 cycles of 98°C for 10 s,
55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension of
5 min at 72°C. PCR products were purified and replicates
pooled using MultiScreen PCR384purification plates (Millipore, MA, USA). For the ligation reaction 10 ng of
genomic DNA and 4 ng and 20 ng of purified PCR product
were used as a template with 250 fmol of probes (Table
1). The data-analysis was done as describe above. The ligation and hybridisation with 20 ng of PCR products was
done in three replicates. When two out of the three replicates gave positive signal, the probe was considered positive.
Cloning and sequencing of samples
The eight compost samples used in ligation were also
sequenced in order to compare the results from these two
methods. A DNA-library was constructed and clones from
each library were sequenced as in Hultman et al. (unpublished). Ninety-six clones were sequenced from each
library expect from sample NK07, from which the number
was 35 clones. The sequences that passed the Phred 20
quality test [38,39] and were joined as phylotypes with
99% similarity and aligned to Genbank with BLAST algorithm [30]. The multiple alignment for the sequences was
done with Muscle [40] provided by CSC (The Finnish IT
center for science) and the phylogenetic analysis with
Phylip package [41]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method [42] and the
sequences from two Chytridiomycota, Orpinomyces sp.

Sensitivity
The absolute detection limit and relative sensitivity of the
probes was evaluated using artificial mixes of PCR fragments from fungal pure cultures and clone libraries of
environmental samples. In a mixture containing 100 ng of
herring sperm DNA or Penicillia DNA, 0.1 fmol of PCR
product was seen to be sufficient to give positive signal
(Fig. 2). No differences in results could be observed
whether the background DNA was herring or Penicillium.
The detected amount, 0.1 fmol of on average 700 bp PCR
product, corresponds to ca. 0.04% sensitivity level. To
help normalising zip-oligo hybridisation signals over different spots and arrays, a control probe sequence was
included in each zip code oligo (Fig. 1). The thermodynamic melting temperature properties of the control
probe were similar to the actual zip sequences. The control probe was utilized as an indicator of per-spot zip
sequence hybridisation variability and setting limits for

detection. Increase in number of ligation reaction cycles

Specificity
To estimate the specificity of the probes, ligation reactions
each containing a different template and all of the probes
were prepared and hybridised to different MPX subarrays.
Of the fourteen phylotype-specific probes tested, three did
not give sufficient signal to be considered functional: PenCom, PichFerm and KlyMa2 (Fig. 4). One probe was
observed to give nonspecific signal: AspFum probe
detected Issatschenkia orientalis (IssOr) template, although
the level of signal was barely over the threshold. In addition, probe CanEt2 seemed to detect GalGe template
weakly, but this was expected because CanEt probes were
designed to detect their specific template only as a pair.
The rest of the 14 phylotype specific probes were specific
to corresponding template despite the taxonomical relatedness. The probe for Pezizomycota-fungi proved to be
group specific as well.
Testing with environmental samples
To determine how the detection functioned when applied
to complex environmental samples, the probes were
tested with 10 samples from industrial composting plants
and compost reactors located in Finland, Sweden and
Norway [34,35]. The LDR experiments were conducted
with 10 ng of the extracted genomic DNA as a template
and also with PCR fragments pooled from three replicate
reactions in two different quantities, 4 ng and 20 ng.
Genomic DNA (10 ng) was found to function as a template in LDR in 3 of the ten samples (NK07, NK10 and
NK14B), but no signal was detected in eight samples
(Table 3). After PCR amplification of the ITS-area signal
was detected from several probes with both 4 ng and 20
ng of template. The signals in 20 ng were substantially
higher and in some cases, not all probes, that gave positive
signal in 20 ng, were among the positives in 4 ng (Table
3). The ligation and hybridisation with 20 ng of PCR
product as a template was performed in three replicates. A
probe was considered positive when positive signal was
detected in two out of three replicates. The highest
number of positive spots was detected with 20 ng of PCR
product used as a template in LDR.

Since microarray provides information from the phylotypes there is a probe for, clone libraries were constructed
from eight samples to determine the phylotype composition in samples and find out whether the microarray test
was functioning. The total number of good quality fulllength sequences by Phred score 20 was 588. Sequences
were clustered into 53 phylogroups with < 1% difference
and the number of phylotypes in the sequenced libraries
varied between 3 and 18 (Table 2). The library coverage
calculated with the Chao1 method [44] ranged from

37.9% to 85.7% and with the ACE method from 37.9% to
78.1% [45]. The total diversity was therefore undersampled. The estimated richness (Table 2) with Chao1
method ranged between 3.5 and 34.7 and with ACE
between 4.0 and 40.6. The BLAST alignments revealed the
fungal communities in samples to be comprised of
sequences similar to ascomycetous yeasts, Zygomycetes,
Pezizomycotina and to a group with no reference in the
sequence databases, but which had been found previously
in pilot composting drums (Hultman et al. 200× unpublished). The 53 phylotypes were grouped into 8 phylogroups (Table 4) by the clustering in the phylogenetic tree.
The phylogroups were named Group 1 (members from
the group without sequence database match), Basidiomycetes (members clustering with basidiomycota
sequences), Candida (phylotypes clustering with some of
the Candida sequences), Pezizomycotina (phylotypes with
high similarity to the Pezizomycotina subphylym), Saccharomycetaceae 1 and Saccharomycetaceae 2 (clustered with
different representatives of the Saccharomycetaceae family), Dipodascaceae (phylotypes clustered with sequences
from family Dipodasceacea) and Zygomycetes (clustering
with sequences from different Zygomycota). As the numbers of phylotypes in samples, the phylotype composition
varied between different composts and the physical and
chemical conditions of the samples.

Fungal composition in samples
The design of the probes used in the LDR assay was based
on sequences of common phylotypes in our previous
studies (Hultman et al. unpublished). The probes were
designed for indicator phylotypes at different phases of
composting such as the mesophilic stage and the active,
thermophilic stage. Compared with the sequencing
results, phylotypes with high similarity (> 99%) to the
LDR target sequences were positive when detected with
sequencing.
Research reactor
By cloning and sequencing the phylotype richness in
research reactor samples was highest in sample NK06
(Table 2). The phylotypes in these samples were mainly
from Group 1, though in both samples there were clones
similar to I. orientalis, and in addition in sample NK07
phylotypes similar to Candida sake and Sordariomycestes. In
sample NK09 the phylotypes were from Saccharomycetaceae and Pezizomycotina origin. No representatives from
Group1 were detected by cloning or LDR in sample NK09
even though in sample NK10 the group represented over
90% of the sequenced clones. Group 1 was not found to
be present in the initial stages of composting (Table 3) as
it was absent in sample NK05 by LDR and in sample
NK08 and NK09 by LDR and LDR and cloning, respecPage 8 of 15

probepair KlyMa was present in clone libraries, but not
detected by LDR probes.
Full-scale process
The highest diversity in the clone libraries was observed in
sample NK12 (ACE 40.6, Table 2.) where phylotypes similar to various Pezizomycotina, Zygomycota and Saccharomycetaceae (Table 4.) but no members from Group1 were
identified. Samples NK14a and NK14b were diverse (S
ACE 24.3 and 27.5, respectively) although the tempera-

ture was increased towards thermophilic levels. The DNA
in these two samples was extracted from the same sample
bag at different time points to determine the possible
sampling and cloning bias. Both of the samples were used
as template for clone library preparation and LDR-ligation
and microarray hybridisation. The phylotype composition of the samples NK14a and NK14b were rather similar
comprising of Saccharomycetales, Pezizomycotina and Zygomycetes and in addition sample NK14a contained phylotype similar to uncultured Saccharomycotina (Table 4). The
phylotypes similar to Candida and Dipodascaceae were

and microarray hybridisation give similar results despite
the independently done DNA extraction. In sample NK19
from the clone library sequencing three phylotypes, all
similar to Thermomyces lanuginosus, were detected. The
same phylotype was found also with the LDR-array in
addition to positive signal with the probe specific for Pezizomycotina.

Discussion
DNA microarrays have the potential to be useful in fast
and efficient monitoring of complex microbic environment but the conventional array platforms may suffer
from nonspecific background signals and low sensitivity.
We have applied the ligation detection reaction (LDR)
microarray method for municipal biowaste compost samples to develop a tool for monitoring the fungal species
contributing to different phases of the decomposition
process and to demonstrate the feasibility of LDR microarray for species-level detection from complex microbial
communities. Previously, LDR has been successfully
applied to detecting microbes from environmental samples [19-21]. These studies report 1–5 fmol sensitivity at
5% of total DNA using genus consensus sequences in
probe design and group-selective PCR primers in template
amplification. Better sensitivity has been achieved by PCR
amplifying the ligation products [24,47] but this
approach requires long circulazing oligonucleotide
probes, nuclease treatments and PCR reaction making it
somewhat more expensive and time consuming than simple LDR. Here, we have been able to improve the sensitivity of the LDR method to detect 0.1 fmol of target DNA at
0.04% level of total DNA using species-specific ligation
probes. As such, the method is feasible for accurate determination of compost microbiota and serves as a basis for
development of a diagnostic tool. The ability to distinguish microbes at species-level is of value in many environmental studies where certain pathogenic or key species
need to be detected. The developed LRD based method
differs from the diagnostic oligonucleotide microarrays.
For example in the high density PhyloChip [17] the range
of microbes detected is much higher as the probes are
designed based on different taxonomic levels. In our system the main focus was in sensitive species level detection
which was achieved. In the mentioned PhyloChip the specificity was targeted to the OTU-level (sequences with
97% similarity) [17] and the main focus was in the study
of microbial diversity instead of presence or absence of
certain species of phylotypes.
The ribosomal internal transcribed (ITS) spacer region
was selected as the target for ligation probes since its
extensive use in phylogenetics offers plenty of reference
material in sequence databases for probe design. In addition, the amount of ribosomal sequences in the local database was large due to our previous sequencing projects

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/237

[27,28], Hultman et al. unpublished) providing sequence
information of the relevant target species. The probe pairs
were designed for 14 species or phylotypes that were
found to be abundant in the industrial composting process based on previous studies (Hultman et al. unpublished). Target phylotypes were selected to reflect the
different stages of the composting process, the acidic initial stages and the thermophilic latter stages. A group specific probe for subphylym Pezizomycota was designed
because the number of sequences clustering to Pezizomycota was low in the earlier studies and the reference data
was therefore low. Probes for phylotypes similar to Absidia
and Emericella were designed based on preliminary
sequencing of the samples studied here. The probes were
designed using rRNA sequence alignments and verified
with BLAST searches. The 3' terminus of the discriminating probe was designed to contain as many nucleotides as
possible differentiating it from non-target templates.
However, one false positive probe signal was found; IssOr
probe weakly detected Candida rugosa template (Fig. 4),
even though the probe contained mismatches to the Candida template, including the 3' discriminating nucleotide.
Sequencing the Candida template did not reveal any contamination in the sample, so this false positive signal
remains largely unexplained. In the experiments, AspFum
probe seems to weakly detect I. orientalis template but this
signal is below threshold (Fig. 4).
For all tested probes, the lower limit for sensitivity in our
experiments was 0.1 fmol of target PCR product comprising ca. 0.04% of total DNA present in the reaction mixture, suggesting that the relatively large amount of
background DNA does not limit the ligation reaction of
the probes. DNA from fungal pure cultures was used as a
background DNA because in the environmental samples
there is non-target DNA present that can affect the hybridisation. The level of absolute sensitivity (0.1 fmol) is
higher compared to what was reported earlier for LDR
[21], reaching the levels of qPCR. This could possibly be
attributed to the use of a hybridisation control probe and
to slightly different reaction conditions than in other studies, but it is not clear to us exactly why better sensitivity
was seen in this study. However, the method used is not
quantitative as the template DNA is PCR-amplified prior
ligation and the amplification is not done in a quantitative manner.
The hybridisation control probe measured the per-spot
variance in Zip-oligo hybridisation which helped normalizing the signal between spots. Gupta and coworkers [48]
utilised a similar idea in microarray experiments where a
third label was successfully used to define the spot areas
and to flag the spots with low quantity or no probes
printed due to array printing errors. We did not systematically assess the effect of the B3 hybridisation control

Page 12 of 15

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:237

probe to sensitivity, but it is likely that the effect was largest at low template concentrations where the signal was
weakest. The increase in sensitivity achieved here shows
the potential of LDR based microarrays in sensitive species level detection.
Increasing the number of ligation reaction cycles did not
substantially affect sensitivity (Fig. 3). This could be
explained by the fact that the ligation products have
approximately 15–20 degrees higher melting temperature
than the non-ligated probes. As the reaction proceeds, the
forming ligation products could effectively occupy the target sites for probe hybridisation because at annealing temperature the ratio of hybridised to non-hybridised ligation
products should be quite high. Therefore, the number of
ligation products can be expected to saturate as a function
of reaction cycles. It is also possible that the performance
of reactants and fluorescent labels or the integrity of DNA
declines in high temperatures over time.
The fungal composition of the Nordic samples determined by the clone library sequencing was similar as in
our previous studies in Finnish composting plants and in
a pilot drum experiment [[27], Hultman et al. unpublished]. The samples NK06 to NK10 were from a compost
reactor [34,35] and the composition of the phylotypes is
similar to the composition in the pilot drum studied by
Hultman and co-workers (unpublished). In sample
NK09, the fungal diversity was high and the sequences
clustering to Saccharomycetaceae 1 were found frequently.
Similar sequences were found in the well functioning
stages of composting process in the full-scale drums [27].
Yeast-like sequences were frequently found in the Norwegian plant (samples NK12 and NK14) together with
sequences similar to Zygomycetes and Pezizomycota. Hence
the yeasts can be considered to be of importance to the
often acidic industrial composting process by being able
to grow at low pH and therefore reduce the acidity and
increase the growth of thermophilic bacteria [49]. The pH
in the Scandinavian samples is often low which can
hinder the decomposition, especially when the temperature is about 40°C [37,50]. In sample NK19, only three
phylotypes all similar to T. lanuginosus were found. The
bacterial diversity in the same sample was relatively high
[34,35] so the reason for the low fungal diversity was not
unrepresentative sample.
The results from the clone library sequencing were compared with the microarray hybridisation results. Most of
the phylotypes present in clone libraries were also
detected by the microarray. However, in samples NK14a
and NK14b, some phylotypes not observed by clone
sequencing were nonetheless detected by LDR (Table 3).
Sequence dependent cloning bias might have affected the
representativeness of the library (reviewed in [51]) and it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/237

is conceivable that some fragments were left out from
cloning. On the other hand, Kluyveromyces marxianus phylotype was present in the clone library but was not properly detected by LDR. In sample NK10, K. marxianus was
detected with LDR from the genomic DNA as a template
but not with the PCR-product as a template. In NK09, K.
marxianus probe was positive with 4 ng of PCR-product
used as a template but not with 20 ng of template. The
number of sequenced clones similar to K. marxianus was
only one in both libraries NK09 and NK10, which suggests that the number of template fragments amplified in
PCR was in fact too low to be over the detection threshold.

Conclusion
The probes detected indicator phylotypes for different
phases of composting such as the mesophilic stage and
the active, thermophilic stage. The microarray detection
limit was 0.04% of the total DNA showing potential for
use of the method for example in pathogen detection. The
microarray was found to be effective in detecting certain
phylotypes when applied to complex environmental samples taken from the early stages of municipal biowaste
composting. The microarray results were succesfully verified by sequencing of clone libraries. Ongoing studies will
widen the probe pool and expand it to include the bacteria. The plattform will then serve as a basis for a diagnostic
environmental monitoring tool.
