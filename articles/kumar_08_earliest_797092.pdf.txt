Abstract
Background: The "out of Africa" model postulating single "southern route" dispersal posits arrival
of "Anatomically Modern Human" to Indian subcontinent around 66–70 thousand years before
present (kyBP). However the contributions and legacy of these earliest settlers in contemporary
Indian populations, owing to the complex past population dynamics and later migrations has been
an issue of controversy. The high frequency of mitochondrial lineage "M2" consistent with its
greater age and distribution suggests that it may represent the phylogenetic signature of earliest
settlers. Accordingly, we attempted to re-evaluate the impact and contribution of earliest settlers
in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of contemporary Indian populations; using our newly
sequenced 72 and 4 published complete mitochondrial genomes of this lineage.
Results: The M2 lineage, harbouring two deep rooting subclades M2a and M2b encompasses
approximately one tenth of the mtDNA pool of studied tribes. The phylogeographic spread and
diversity indices of M2 and its subclades among the tribes of different geographic regions and
linguistic phyla were investigated in detail. Further the reconstructed demographic history of M2
lineage as a surrogate of earliest settlers' component revealed that the demographic events with
pronounced regional variations had played pivotal role in shaping the complex net of populations
phylogenetic relationship in Indian subcontinent.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that tribes of southern and eastern region along with Dravidian
and Austro-Asiatic speakers of central India are the modern representatives of earliest settlers of
subcontinent. The Last Glacial Maximum aridity and post LGM population growth mechanised
some sort of homogeneity and redistribution of earliest settlers' component in India. The demic
diffusion of agriculture and associated technologies around 3 kyBP, which might have marginalized
hunter-gatherer, is coincidental with the decline of earliest settlers' population during this period.

Background
The "out of Africa" model postulating a single "southern
route" dispersal of "Modern human" from Horn of Africa
to the Persian/Arabian Gulf and further along the tropical
coast of the Indian Ocean to southeast Asia and Australasia has largely taken ground in the recent years [1-3]. This
most likely involved the exodus of a founding group of
several hundred individuals, who might have made the
crossing from northeastern Africa, probably over the
mouth of the Red Sea some time after the appearance of
lineage L3 ~85,000 years ago, followed by a period of
mutation and drift during which macrohaplogroups M,
N, and R evolved and the ancestral L3 was lost [4]. Subsequently the same three founder macrohaplogroups, with
the population expansion most likely occurring on Indian
coast [5,6] shows a rapid coastal dispersal from ~66,000
years ago around the Indian Ocean littoral and on to Australasia by ~63,000 years ago [4] resulting in the non overlapping distribution of the derived haplogroups within M
and N and its subclade R in south Asia, eastern Asia and
Australasia.
However, the presence of the diversity of basal clades with
in mtDNA macrohaplogroup M in India exceeds that in
eastern Eurasia; and numerous so-called M* lineages
occur in India but not in east Asia. Whereas estimated age
of the M macrohaplogroup in India 54.1 thousand years
(ky); [7] on the other hand is considerably low as compared to its east Eurasian counterparts (east Asia 69.3 ±
5.4 ky; Oceania 73.0 ± 7.9 ky; southeast Asia 55.7 ± 7.4
ky) [7,8]. The reason could be the molecular diversity and
so as the coalescence age of the Indian M subhaplogroups
themselves, which vary substantially as indicated in the
studies of Sun et al. [7] and Thangaraj et al. [9].
Nested within this model, there could be two plausible
scenarios:

number to the west of the subcontinent are members of
the M1 fragment, it also seems unlikely that the so
appeared younger lineage of macrohaplogroup M has
originated much farther west.
Owing to the aforesaid ambiguity in population structure
coupled with the west Eurasian contribution into the
Indian maternal gene pool as a consequence of migrations during the last 10,000 years before present (ybp)
[10,11] the origin and settlement of Indian people still
remains intriguing.
Of the known M lineages in India, M2 with an estimated
age of ~50,000 years is the oldest [7,12] and largest subhaplogroup, which almost accounting for one tenth of the
Indian macrohaplogroup M [11,13]. The distribution of
M2 is significantly more pronounced in southern part of
India as compared to north, a cline similar to that of M in
general [5,11]. Moreover Metspalu et al. [11] also noted
that frequency of M2 among the Brahmin and Kshatriyas
of Andhra Pradesh is not significantly different from that
of other caste and tribal populations of the region. However it is absent among the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of the
northern states of India, while the frequency reaches
nearly 3 % among other caste and tribal populations of
the region. The high frequency of M2 consistent with its
greater age and distribution suggests that it may represent
the phylogenetic signature of earliest settlers who colonized India through southern route.
To explore the past population dynamics, impact and
contribution of Middle/EarlyUpper-Paleolithic settlers in
shaping the genetic diversity and structure of contemporary Indian populations, we have sequenced 72 complete
mitochondrial genomes of M2 lineage from 16 relic tribal
populations of India.

Results
1. The number of drift events in middle/early upper-Paleolithic populations (earliest settlers) has shaped the
present day mtDNA phylogenetic structure of Indian populations. 2. Either the ancestral M existed for a minimum
interval of ~30,000 to ~20,000 years, during which the
younger lineages branched off sequentially or second emigrational event most likely occurring ~30,000 to ~20,000
years ago from the west of the subcontinent has given rise
or brought the younger lineages, thereby accounting for
the different numbers of mutations accumulated to the
present.
The latter has been complicated by the fact that if not all,
most of these lineages are autochthonous to India and
arose essentially simultaneously from ancestral M as
argued by Macaulay et al. [4]. Furthermore, since the only
haplogroup of M lineages found in the substantial

Of the screened 2768 mtDNAs from 24 tribes of India the
macrohaplogroup M accounted for 69.39 %, which is
consistent with the earlier reports [5,11,14]. The frequency distribution of macrohaplogroup M varies significantly (P <0.0001) among studied tribes with a cline
towards southern and eastern regions of India as shown in
Table 1 and Figure 1. In tribes (MaThakur, KaThakur,
Kathodi, Katkari) of western region, macrohaplogroup M
frequency is significantly low (~50% or less; P <0.011) as
compared to the other studied regions of India. Unexpectedly Dungri Bhil representing the north-westernmost
region shows a high frequency of M (76.1%) as compared
to its other western counterparts.
For the earliest settlers' component among the studied
tribes, 1810 samples of macrohaplogroup M were
screened for the motif that confirms haplogroup M2

within M as described in methods. Our results indicate
that M2 is completely absent among the eight tribes of
northeast India, expect one M2 in Sonowal Kachari.
Avoiding northeast tribes, the M2 haplogroup frequency
is about 13.86 % among the studied tribes. Its frequency
is ~10 to ~20 % in tribes of western and central India. The
frequency declines gradually to farther north and east. In
southern region tribes, Betta Kuruba shows highest frequency (i.e. 39.13%) whereas the adjacent Jenu Kuruba
tribe shows frequency of only 7.02 %. The distribution of
subclade M2b varies greatly from complete absence
among Indo-European speakers of western and central
India to as high as 35.65 % among Betta Kuruba. Irrespective of region, its frequency is high (>50% of total M2) in
all Dravidian speakers, except Madia tribe of central
region whose linguistic affiliation is not very clear. Similarly it's frequency is high in Korku, an Austro-Asiatic tribe

of central India. In eastern region M2b frequency remains
low (<50% of M2).
Defining the M2 substructure
The reconstructed phylogenetic tree based on our newly
sequenced 72 mtDNAs of M2 haplogroup and 4 additional M2 complete sequences from the literature [7] is
given in Figure 2. Out of the four defining mutations of
macrohaplogroup M, one transition at nucleotide position (np) 14783 shows reversion in one of our samples.
Besides the commonly occurring 16319 transition, M2 in
our samples is defined by the motif 447G-1780-850211083-15670-16274 as also described in Kivisild et al.,
Rajkumar et al., Sun et al. and Thangaraj et al. [6,7,12,9].
Though one major branch in our tree lack mutation at np
16274 but due to its presence in most M2 samples of this
study, as well reported elsewhere [6,7,11] we considered
this mutation as a basal polymorphism of M2 as sug-

Phylogenetic reconstruction of 76 complete mtDNAs of M2 Lineage
Phylogenetic reconstruction of 76 complete mtDNAs of M2 Lineage. Mutations were scored relative to the rCRS
[58]. Sample details and population codes has been given in Table 1. Four additional complete mtDNA sequence of M2 lineage
(labeled as R102, T3, T11 and T27) are acquired from published sources [7] has been used for tree reconstruction. Suffixes A,
C, G, and T indicate transversions, "d" signifies a deletion and a plus sign (+) an insertion; recurrent mutations are underlined.
The prefix "@" indicates back mutation. The coalescent estimates were calculated as per [16] and [17] presented as bold and
Italic respectively.

gested in Sun et al. [7] and lack of the 16274 variant in
some samples [[6,12], this study] indicates a back-mutation event. Similarly lack of mutation at np 11083 in one
of our samples is also treated as reversion event.

The M2 tree shows an initial deep split into two sister
clades M2a and M2b. No third clade, as indicated in Rajkumar et al. [12] has been found. The clade M2a is defined
by transition at np 7961, 12810 and contains three independent basal branches M2a1, M2a2 and M2a3, in contrast to the earlier reports [6,7,11] where M2a defining

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:230

motif largely constitute mutations of its sub-braches.
M2a1 is defined by the motif 204-5252-8396-975816270-16352, in which transition at np 8396 show parallelism in two samples of M2a2 branch and transition at
np 16352 shows a reversion event. M2a2 is defined by the
motif of four diagnostic 7702-11041A-12657-13708 and
two recurrent 16240C-16311 mutations. The branch
M2a3 is defined by the motif of one recurrent np 146 and
three specific 5426-5774-7762 mutations. The further
divergence within these branches of M2a exhibit probable
pattern of more shared haplotypes within populations of
geographic proximity followed by population specific
haplotypes and a few shared haplotypes among geographically apart populations.
Unlike M2a, M2b instead of early branching represented
by a single deep root defined by the motif 152-182-195522,523d-1453-2831T-3630-5744-6647-9899-1325414766-16183C-16189-16193+C-16320 which, of late
shows branching pattern similar to the sub-branches of
M2a. The M2b1 defined by the transition at np 6260-5420
harbour population of eastern region. Whereas, M2b2
defined by transition at np 16295, harbours Dravidians.
Other braches within M2b are more or less population
specific. In this study, spread of M2b by enlarge restricted
to Dravidians and tribes of eastern region. The root of
M2b in our tree differs in two positions to the earlier definition of Sun et al. [7] i.e. transition at np 182 is present
in all of our M2b samples so we treated this as basal mutation and lack of this in one sample of Sun et al. [7] could
be better explained by reversion event, second our all M2b
samples has poly 'A' at np 16180–16182 and twelve 'C's
thereafter. Hence in our tree an additional 'C' at np
16184–16193 has been treated as insertion at np 16193,
than transversion (A16182C) reported by Sun et al. [7].
Age estimates and Phylogenetic implications
Coalescent age estimates were calculated by Rho (ρ) statistics [15] using two different mutation rates [16] and [17]
shows a marginal time difference when standard deviation is taken into account, the later has been considered
because of robustness in view of natural selection [17].
The average sequence divergence of the 76 M2 codingregion sequences from the root of M2 calculated as per
[17] corresponds to a coalescence time estimate of 36.5 ±
1.6 thousand years (ky). The founder age estimate for
Indian mtDNA lineages using M2 data, 50.0 ± 1.5 ky is
well within the lower bound range of earlier estimates (i.e.
sometime before 50 kyBP) of modern human dispersal
into Arabia and southern Asia [1,2,4,17-21], and perhaps
more close to the estimates of [17].

The two clades of M2 show differential branching patterns. M2a with coalescent age 21.6 ± 2.3 ky splits into its
three deep rooting branches M2a1, M2a2 and M2a3.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/230

M2a2 is specific to Kathodi/Katkari tribe, whereas M2a1
and M2a3 encompass almost all the studied tribes. M2a1,
M2a2 and M2a3 show coalescent estimates of 7 to 9 ky.
The clade M2b doesn't show branching event earlier than
estimated coalescence time of 12.6 ± 2.8 ky. In our samples we could not find M2b among Indo-European speakers of west and central India. The Dravidian speaking
tribes of south extending up to central India and tribes of
eastern region irrespective of linguistic affiliation, harbour
both clades (i.e. M2a and M2b) of M2, presenting a time
depth of ~37 ky.
Diversity indices
Diversity indices and demographic parameters estimated
for studied tribes are given in Table 2. The M2 lineage,
haplotype diversity among Indian tribes ranged from 0.40
to 1.00 and nucleotide diversity from 0.0001 to 0.002.
Though four geographical regions of India did not differ
significantly (Mann-Whitney U-test) in haplotype diversity it was comparatively higher in west (0.90–1.00) followed by central (0.83–1.00), eastern (0.83–1.00) and
southern tribes (0.40–1.00). Nucleotide diversity in east
(0.0010–0.0019) was significantly higher than west
(0.0001–0.0009; Z = 2.24, P = 0.025) and central tribes
(0.00016–0.0011; Z = 2.65, P = 0.039), intermediate
nucleotide diversity values were observed in south India
(0.0006–0.002), they were not significantly different from
west and central India (Z = 1.71; P = 0.087) or east India
(Z = 0.44; P = 0.662). These patterns of genetic diversity
were further strengthened by the analysis of mean pairwise differences (MPD). MPD of west (1.67–16.00) and
central tribes (2.67–18.00) were significantly lower (Z =
2.41, P = 0.016) than the MPD from east (17.17–32.67),
whereas MPD from south (11.20–30.00) were not significantly different from east, west and central tribes (Z =
1.39, P = 0.166). Thus observed mtDNA diversity indicate
to the fact that haplotype/haplogroup frequency is a poor
parameter of deep rooting ancestry rather it is the product
of recent population growth. Similarly, the diversity
parameters are also influenced by the past demographic
events and any phylogenetic inference drawn on such
parameter should keep in view the past demographic
events, particularly for India where such event has been
predicted previously [22].
Past population dynamics
As indicated in our results and previously [22] the demographic history of populations in different geographic
regions might have played pivotal role in shaping the
complex net of population phylogenetic relationships in
Indian subcontinent. The demographic history of M2 lineage as a surrogate of the middle/early upper Palaeolithic
component of Indian populations was reconstructed
using Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) [23]. Figure 3 (panel 'A')
shows the BSP of M2 lineage produced using 76 complete

mtDNA sequences along with plot (panel 'B') using only
coding region. Although the two analyses are very similar,
the second is confined to slow evolving region of mtDNA
[24] which is likely to define lineages that have existed in
the population prior to a putative bottleneck, thus
increasing the sensitivity of BSP to detect more complex
demographic trends. As the analysis is based on only single lineage it provides insight into the demographic event
limiting to the age of the lineage (i.e. 37–45 kyBP). Most
striking is the population decline, observed during Last
Glacial Maximum i.e. 23 to 19 kyBP [25] and Late Glacial
Aridity i.e. 18 to 14 kyBP [26], followed by many fold
population growth in a comparatively short period of
time. If such demographic event had affected the earliest
settlers of India it would have resulted in several implications of phylogenetic interest. Firstly, reduction of genetic
diversity across all the lineages in which, lineages with a
smaller population spread would have been affected the
most. Second, it might have mechanized some sort of unifying effect where smaller lineages are eliminated or at
least reduced to margins of extinction and lineages of
larger spread remained among all the post bottleneck
populations. The Post Glacial rapid population growth
achieved some sort of plateau by 7 to 3 kyBP followed by
another decline which was to its maximum around ~1000
to 1500 BP. Now the question is whether the observed
demographic trend was uniform throughout India or it
was as complex as reported by the earlier studies [22]. A

similar analysis for each studied geographical region of
India is presented in panel C to F of Figure 3. Due to the
small sample size in each geographic region BSP produces
low resolution; however rapid post glacial population
growth is evident in east, south and central India, followed by a population decline from 3 to 1 kyBP. The rapid
regain after this period has been observed in central
region; however such regains are marginal in other two
regions. The demographic past of ancient lineage among
western tribes was quite different- a population growth
from ~7–8 kyBP continued to present. The negative values
of Fs that differ significantly from zero indicative of population's demographic expansion [27] also support the
recent population expansion in western region (Fu's Fs = 7.07; P = 0.004).
Genetic Structure
The above results are indicative of some genetic structure
in Indian populations, to investigate that, AMOVA was
used (Table 3). In the total samples (model 1) 49.13% of
the variance was found within populations and 50.87%
among populations. Studied tribes were then grouped
according to geographic proximity (model 2), linguistic
affinities (model 3) and to the results suggested, namely
two groups separating Indo-European speakers of west
and central India from all others (model 4). Under the
models 2 and 3, 45–48 % of the variance was found
within populations, 36–39% among populations within

Discussion
A rapid coastal migration along the "southern route" from
Africa into southern Asia, some time before 50 kyBP has
been strongly suggested by studies on present day world
populations (especially those based on mitochondrial
DNA) [1,11,18-21,28]. The founder analysis of the mtDNAs in this study suggests 50.0 ± 1.5 kyBP for such arrival
which is well within the lower bound range of earlier estimates and perhaps more consistent with the earliest and
most pronounced population expansion in southern Asia
around 52 kyBP suggested in [28]. Magnitude of this
southern Asian growth phase suggests that over half of the
global human population lived in Indian subcontinent
between ~45 to 20 kyBP and population size peaked at
over 60% around 38kyBP [28]. These population expansion estimates are largely in agreement with high mtDNA
diversity and star like non-overlapping pattern of numerous lineages of macrohaplogroup M reported previously
[4,6,9,7].
Though the stage upto here is clear, the contribution and
role of this sizably large earliest settlers' component in the
contemporary Indian populations, coupled with later
migrations during the last 10 thousand years (ky) from
west and east of the subcontinent has been an issue of
controversy. Cordaux et al. [22] based on the non-overlapping pattern of mtDNA phylogeny between India and
east Eurasia has supported the argument of Cavalli-Sforza
et al. [29] that in India the genetic traces of early migrations along the southern route were erased by the subsequent migrations, which shaped the present-day mtDNA
gene pool of India. However presence of numerous autochthonous lineages in India emerging directly from the
root of the founder macrohaplogroups M, N and R
[4,6,7,9] during the estimated population growth period
in southern Asia (~45 to 20 kyBP)[28] indicates the presence of large component of earliest settlers in the contemporary Indian populations.

In the quest of finding the carriers of the genetic legacy of
the earliest settlers among the contemporary Indian populations, some previous studies on mtDNA variation by
calculating nucleotide diversity and expansion time (as
per methods of Slatkin et al. [30]) for different linguistic
groups of India, distinguished Austro-Asiatic speaking
tribes as the oldest and the carriers of the said legacy
[31,32]. Basu et al. [14] also supported the view by reporting that the frequency of the ancient haplogroup M2
among the Austro-Asiatic tribal populations is as high as
19% and they lack the younger haplogroup M4. However
Metspalu et al. [11], so as this study, rejects such claims as
linguistic groups of India do not cluster into distinct
branches of the Indian mtDNA tree, [[6,10,13], this study]
calculating the beginning of expansion for those groupings is problematic, whereas lack of coding region information in Basu et al. [14] have lead to an over estimation
of M2 frequency. Moreover our results indicate that M2
frequency variation among the studied tribes can be better
explained by recent population expansion/demographic
events than as a function of deep rooting ancestry. The
nucleotide diversity though appears better parameter, is
also predisposed to influence of past demographic events.
The phylogenetic inferences based on such parameters
should be strictly viewed in reference to the demographic
events, particularly for India.
Our analysis of mtDNA variation in populations of India
indicate that the Dravidian tribes extending from southern to central India and tribes of eastern India irrespective
of the linguistic affiliation shows equally deep rooted M2
ancestry ~37 ky (Figure 2), comparable nucleotide diversity (Table 2) and similar past demographic history (Figure 3). However Indo-European tribes of western and
central India except Kathodi/Katkari and Andh tribes harbour only M2a1 branch representing a time depth of ~8
ky. Kathodi/Katkari and Andh tribe encompasses other
braches of M2a, but lacks M2b. All these Indo-European
tribes shows appreciable frequency of M2 (Table 1), but
they are low on nucleotide diversity (Table 2). Thus it
would be highly speculative to tag any one or a group of
populations based on linguistics or geography as the representatives of earliest settlers, rather it indicate to the fact

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:230

that earliest settlers' component is more pronounced in
the areas extending from southern to eastern India, and
shows decline towards north and northwest India, a cline
similar to that of M in general [[5,11], this study]. However a decline of earliest settlers' component across tribe to
higher caste gradient may also be accepted in the respective regions as indicated in [13].
The time depth of M2 lineage and diversity indices in
Indo-European speakers of western region extending up
to central India posits the expansion of earliest settlers'
component into these areas during the post Last Glacial
Maximum(LGM) growth (~12 to 7 kyBP) of population
(Figure 3) or perhaps little later (Figure 3-pannel 'F').
However this requires further investigation. It is only during this rapid growth; regional and population specific
branching patterns appear on the more or less homogenous M2 phylogeny. The possible explanation would be
the earliest settlers of India prior to this rapid population
growth had lived in an extended enclave and there had
been continuous gene flow across population boundaries.
The second but more plausible reason of such homogeneity could be that earliest settlers by virtue of large population size during ~45 to 20 kyBP [28] and Indian ecological
setting which, favoured tendency to isolate and subjugate
[33] might have been differentiated into populations distributed far apart as suggested in recent studies [4,9]. But
during the LGM and late glacial aridity, climate across
India and south Asia generally seems to have been much
more arid than present. Geomorphological indicators
from the landmass of India suggest dune mobility in the
northwest [34], and greatly reduced river flow in north
central India during the span of time that covered the full
glacial [35]. Offshore indicators of salinity (due to runoff
from the land) suggest that LGM aridity was substantially
greater than at present. Indicators of upwelling intensity
in the Indian Ocean suggest that the summer monsoon
was much weaker than present at the LGM, but reaching
its weakest at around 15,800 – 12,500 C14 years ago, that
is 17,800-13,800 calibrated or 'real' years ago [26]. During
this period of cold and more arid conditions rainforest
retreated and was replaced by dry grasslands. However,
some monsoon forests and woodlands in southern India
and scrub, open woodland in eastern India probably
existed in presently moist forest climates. This appears to
be harsh conditions for an hunting gathering based subsistence, thus to fight the adverse, probably shrinking
populations might have come close to each other in a
more habitable area allowing a free gene flow between
populations, whereas ancestral population of the
Kathodi/Katkari M2a2 lineage appears to have remained
isolated during this period. In the post LGM growth
period, though population spread over wide geographical
regions. Maternal gene flow is evident in the geographical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/230

neighbors suggesting fluidic population specific boundaries until recently at least among the tribes.
The next important event on the Indian scene is the beginnings of agriculture and use of pottery [36-41]. Cultivation of plants/agriculture diffused from the Fertile
Crescent within the past 10,000 years. The steady advance
beyond this stage seems however to have been primarily
driven by the crop-animal complex derived from the mideast, reaching the tip of southern India around 3 to 2 kyBP
[42,43]. The diffusion of pottery traditions, which arise in
response to the need to store and cook grains, shows evidence of the influences from northwest and northeast,
with the western influence predominating over much of
the country. Thus the Black and Red ware reflects western,
while the Corded ware Chinese influence [44-46]. Two
other technological innovations, known to have originated outside of India, the domestication of horse,
around 6 kyBP on the shores of Black Sea in present
Ukraine, and the use of iron around 5 kyBP in Anatolia in
present day Turkey, appears in the Indian archeological
records (around 2 kyBP) soon after the agriculture [42].
The recent study investigating the cultural or demic diffusion model of agriculture in India supported the demic
diffusion model which predicts a substantial genetic input
from migrating agriculturalists [47]. The advent of agriculture and perhaps migrating agriculturists brought about
dramatic changes in the economy, technology and
demography of human societies. Human habitat in the
hunting-gathering stage was essentially on hilly, rocky
and forested regions, which had ample wild plant and animal food resources. Agriculture led to the emergence of
villages and towns and perhaps brought with it the division of society into occupational groups. [43]. Crop cultivation resulted in the loss of the traditional habitat of
hunter-gatherers by deforestation, fragmenting and marginalizing numerous such populations, many of whom
were assimilated into agriculturally based subsistence
economies [48], thereby catalyzing some sort of regional
similarities across tribe caste continuum. Our results on
reconstructed past population demography indicating
decline of earliest settlers' population (female population
here) during this period in almost all the geographical
regions except western (Figure 3) is consistent with the
above proposition and suggests that demic diffusion of
these technologies were rapid, perhaps involving large
migrating populations with these technologies.
The highest frequency of east Eurasian- specific mtDNA
haplogroups [11,22] and absence of M2 an earliest settlers
component (Table 1) among Tibeto-Burman speaking
tribes of northeastern states of India suggests that, despite
the more recent migrations to India, these populations
remained relatively isolated, explaining the close correlation between genetic and linguistic results [49,50]. This

contrasts with the situation observed in other regions of
India, where linguistic structure shows very little concordance with the genetic structures.

Conclusion
The time depth and diversity of M2 lineage among the
studied tribes suggests that the tribes of southern and eastern region along with Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic speakers of central India are the modern representatives of
earliest settlers of India via proposed southern route. The
LGM and late glacial (~23 to 14 kyBP), climatic conditions across India and south Asia seems to be much more
arid and harsh for an hunting gathering based subsistence,
thus mechanized reduction and bringing earliest settlers'
population closer in a more habitable area allowing a free
gene flow, followed by a rapid three fold population
growth around 12-7 kyBP when climatic conditions
improved, thereby inducing some sort of homogeneity
and redistribution of earliest settlers' component in wide
geographical regions. The next important event on the
Indian scene appears to be demic diffusion of agriculture
and associated technologies around 3 kyBP, resulted in
the loss of the traditional habitat of hunter-gatherers by
deforestation, fragmenting and marginalizing such populations, many of whom were assimilated into agricultural
based subsistence economy, as evident in the decline of
earliest settlers' component in all the geographical regions
except western.

Methods
Population Samples
The approximate location of the 24 tribal populations
from which 2768 mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) were
sampled is shown in Figure 1. Each sample comprises
unrelated healthy donors from whom appropriate
informed consent was obtained. The ethical clearance for
the study was obtained from the organizational ethical
clearance committee of Anthropological Survey of India.
Further details of the whole sample collection are
reported in Table 1.
About the Populations
The population of India is culturally stratified broadly
into tribal and non-tribal. It is generally accepted that the
tribal people, who constitute 8.2% of the total population
[51] are the original inhabitants of India [52,53]. There
are an estimated 461 tribal communities in India [54],
who speaks about 750 dialects [55] which can be classified into one of the following four language families:
Indo-European (IE) Austro-Asiatic (AA), Dravidian (DR)
and Tibeto-Burman (TB).

Considering two assumptions, (i) The M2 is one of the
major matrilineal lineages contributed by the southern
route migrants in the Indian populations and (ii) The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/230

tribal people being the original/earliest inhabitants of the
subcontinent could have larger representation of such
contribution. We have screened 24 relic tribal populations
(see details in Figure 1 and Table 1) who by virtue of their
habitat, socio-economic and cultural boundaries probably less influenced by the so called modern populations.
MtDNA molecular analyses
The collected 2768 samples from 24 tribes were first
screened for M macrohaplogroup. Those belongs to M
(1810 in total) were typed for mtDNA motif C447G,
T1780C, A8502G, G16319A which defines M2 haplogroup [6,7,9,11,12]. In our sample C447G and A8502G
polymorphisms are specific to M2, whereas T1780C and
G16319A are also found in the background of haplogroups other than M2 (our unpublished data).

Out of total samples screened, 265 mtDNAs belong to M2
haplogroup distributed among 17 tribes with varying frequency. Avoiding Sonowal Kachari where only one M2
sample was found, 3–6 M2 samples were randomly
selected from each of the 16 tribes for complete mtDNA
sequencing (72 in total).
DNA was extracted from all the collected 4–5 ml blood
samples using standard phenol-chloroform methods [56]
with minor modifications. For screening and complete
mtDNA sequencing, DNA was PCR amplified following
standard protocols and using the PCR primers and conditions of Rieder et al. [57]. Successful amplification was
verified by electrophoresis on 1% ethidium bromidestained agarose gels. Samples were prepared for sequencing by an ExoI/SAP cleanup to remove single-stranded
DNA and unincorporated nucleotides. PCR product was
sequenced with both forward and reverse primers using
BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kits from Applied
Biosystems on an Applied Biosystems 3730 automated
DNA analyzer. Contig assembly and sequence alignment
was accomplished with SeqScap v2.5 software from
Applied Biosystems. Mutations were scored relative to the
revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [58] with
each deviation confirmed by manual checking of electropherograms. All (n = 72) mtDNA complete genome
sequences have been submitted to GenBank (accession
numbers EU443443–EU443514).
Statistical analysis
Phylogeny Reconstruction and Age Estimation
Besides our newly sequenced 72 mtDNAs of M2 haplogroup, 4 additional M2 complete genome sequences from
the literatures [7] were employed for tree reconstruction.
The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from medianjoining networks rooted to L3 using NETWORK 4.2.0.1
software [59]. The tree was checked manually to resolve
homoplasies. The coalescent age estimates were calculated

Page 11 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:230

by Rho (ρ) statistics [15] and two different mutation rates
i.e. one base substitution (one mutation other than indel)
in the coding region (577 – 16023) per 5,140 years [16]
and one synonymous transition per 6,764 year [17] calibrated on the basis of an assumed human-chimp split of
6.5 million years ago. Standard errors for coalescence estimates were calculated following Saillard et al. [15].
Estimates of Population Structure and evolutionary relatedness
The 76 aligned complete mtDNA sequences were analyzed for haplotype, nucleotide diversity (± SD), and
mean pair-wise differences (± SD). Analyses of Molecular
Variance (AMOVA) [60] were also performed to evaluate
the genetic structure of the populations. The aforesaid
analysis has been performed using software package
ARLEQUIN version 3.0 [61].
Estimates of past Population Dynamics
With the prior assumption of M2 as the signature of the
earliest migrants of modern humans in Indian subcontinent, we have tried to reconstruct the demographic history
of earliest settlers from Most Recent Common Ancestor
(MRCA), using Bayesian skyline model [23] of effective
population size. Effective population size is a compound
population genetic parameter generally considered linearly proportional to census population size – in this analysis, the population of breeding females. It is influenced
by many factors, including local extinction, recolonization and various forms of nonrandom mating (62). The
model assumes that regional populations are isolated.
Estimates of effective populations were derived from the
76 complete mtDNA sequence data belonging to M2 haplogroup using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (63)
sampling with 10 groups (m = 10) in software packages
BEAST v1.4 [64] and Tracer v1.3 [65], available from
http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/. The plots were obtained using
stepwise (constant) model. The substitution model was
selected by comparison of Akaike Information Criterion
scores (AIC). The analysis was run for 30 million iterations with the first 10% discarded as burn-in, genealogies
and model parameters were sampled at every 1,000 iterations thereafter.
