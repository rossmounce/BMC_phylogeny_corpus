MuLV-related viruses exhibit inter-tropic complex
recombination patterns

Background
Murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) are classified into
three groups by host tropism correlating with viral
receptor sequences present in the surface protein of env.
Ecotropic MuLV are found only in mice, xenotropic
replicate in non-mouse cells, and polytropic in mouse
and non-mouse hosts. Xenotropic MuLV-related viruses
(XMRV) and polytropic MuLV have been found in
humans and reported in different diseases, including
prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. Classification of MuLV tropism is typically done using small
portions of gag/pol, however, this may be complicated
by viral recombination.
Methods and results
Eight eco/poly/xenotropic MulV complete genomes were
selected from GenBank, plus an XMRV sequence. The
dataset showed strong phylogenetic signal. By tropismgroup analysis using SimPlot software, XMRV was
detected as a mosaic recombinant form of all three groups.
Using more sensitive analyses, we found evidence of intertropic recombination, especially outside of env. Different
procedures for recombination analysis (SimPlot/
TOPALi2), applied to the whole dataset independently
from the tropism, inferred discordant break-points.
Conclusions
Given the evidence of inter-tropic recombination in
MuLV, detection and classification of recombination in
XMRV using different MuLV tropism prototypes should

be interpreted with caution. Despite using a small dataset, a strong phylogenetic signal in the alignments and
highly resolved phylogenies inferred both by full-length
and sliding-window approaches, different recombination
programs reported conflicting results. These results suggest that identification of parental strains of the potential recombinants is difficult and that recombination in
the highly genetically related MuLV have been occurring
for some time.
