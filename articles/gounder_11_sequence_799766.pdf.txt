Abstract
Background: Many strains of Thermus have been isolated from hot environments around the world. Thermus
scotoductus SA-01 was isolated from fissure water collected 3.2 km below surface in a South African gold mine. The
isolate is capable of dissimilatory iron reduction, growth with oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors
and the ability to reduce a variety of metal ions, including gold, chromate and uranium, was demonstrated. The
genomes from two different Thermus thermophilus strains have been completed. This paper represents the
completed genome from a second Thermus species - T. scotoductus.
Results: The genome of Thermus scotoductus SA-01 consists of a chromosome of 2,346,803 bp and a small plasmid
which, together are about 11% larger than the Thermus thermophilus genomes. The T. thermophilus megaplasmid
genes are part of the T. scotoductus chromosome and extensive rearrangement, deletion of nonessential genes and
acquisition of gene islands have occurred, leading to a loss of synteny between the chromosomes of T.
scotoductus and T. thermophilus. At least nine large inserts of which seven were identified as alien, were found, the
most remarkable being a denitrification cluster and two operons relating to the metabolism of phenolics which
appear to have been acquired from Meiothermus ruber. The majority of acquired genes are from closely related
species of the Deinococcus-Thermus group, and many of the remaining genes are from microorganisms with a
thermophilic or hyperthermophilic lifestyle. The natural competence of Thermus scotoductus was confirmed
experimentally as expected as most of the proteins of the natural transformation system of Thermus thermophilus
are present. Analysis of the metabolic capabilities revealed an extensive energy metabolism with many aerobic and
anaerobic respiratory options. An abundance of sensor histidine kinases, response regulators and transporters for a
wide variety of compounds are indicative of an oligotrophic lifestyle.
Conclusions: The genome of Thermus scotoductus SA-01 shows remarkable plasticity with the loss, acquisition and
rearrangement of large portions of its genome compared to Thermus thermophilus. Its ability to naturally take up
foreign DNA has helped it adapt rapidly to a subsurface lifestyle in the presence of a dense and diverse population
which acted as source of nutrients. The genome of Thermus scotoductus illustrates how rapid adaptation can be
achieved by a highly dynamic and plastic genome.

Background
The Witwatersrand Supergroup is a 2.9 billion year old
formation of low-permeability sandstone and shale with
minor volcanic units and conglomerates. The ambient
temperature of the rock at levels in excess of 3 km is
approximately 60°C [1,2]. These mines provide access to
water emanating at levels up to 5 km [3,4]. Although
approximately 300 bacterial and archaeal organisms
have been identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
very few have been successfully cultivated. Detailed analysis of fissure water from many different sites in South
African mines [5] has illustrated severe nutrient limitation which would require special adaptation by the
microbial communities [6].
Hundreds of strains of Thermus have been isolated
from various thermal environments around the world.
All are thermophilic, Gram negative bacteria which
grow optimally at temperatures between 65 to 70°C with
no specific amino acid or vitamin requirements [7]. In
1999 Kieft et al. [1] described the isolation and characterization of a facultatively anaerobic Thermus strain
from water collected 3.2 km below surface, which is
capable of dissimilatory iron reduction as well as growth
with oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors.
The Thermus SA-01 strain (ATCC 700910) is closely
related to Thermus strains NMX2, A.1 and VI-7 (previously isolated from thermal springs in New Mexico,
USA and Portugal, respectively) and was identified as T.
scotoductus [2]. Its ability to reduce chromate, gold and
uranium was illustrated [8,9] and the chromate reductase was found to be an old yellow enzyme homologue
[10]. In addition, a membrane associated “chromate
reductase” [11] and “iron reductases” [12,13] were
isolated.
The complete genome sequences of Thermus thermophilus strains HB8 and HB27 [14] have been determined. In both cases, a chromosome of slightly larger

than 1.8 Mbp and a megaplasmid of 230 to 260 kbp
were found. In addition, HB8 harbors a smaller plasmid
of 9.3 kbp (Table 1). A high degree of synteny is found
between the chromosomes of the two strains, except for
an inversion near the origin of replication and the
majority of the genes are conserved. A degree of plasticity is observed in the megaplasmids and it has been
suggested that the major portion of the genes on the
plasmid may be involved with a thermophilic lifestyle
[15]. Recently, Ohtani and co-workers [16] demonstrated that Thermus thermophilus is polyploid under
certain growth conditions and that this could be part of
the survival strategy in thermophilic environments,
where homologous recombination of chromosomes
could be a mechanism of chromosome repair, as in Deinococcus radiodurans [17,18]. This implies a dynamic
genome where rearrangement of genes occurs with high
frequency. In addition to the plasticity of Thermus genomes, their system of uptake and horizontal exchange of
DNA fragments is the most efficient reported to date
[19-22]. Together, these provide a mechanism for adaptation to harsh environments.
We report here the complete genome sequence of
Thermus scotoductus SA-01 and demonstrate how its
hyperplasticity and it natural ability to acquire genes
have enabled its adaptation to the subsurface.

Results and Discussion
General features of the T. scotoductus SA-01 complete
chromosome sequence

The genome was sequenced with an approx. 20-fold
coverage. The 35 contigs obtained from a combination
of GS20/FLX pyrosequence runs were assembled with
additional Sanger sequencing to close the gaps between
the contigs. The genome of T. scotoductus SA-01 consists of a 2,346,803 bp chromosome (TSCc) [GenBank:
CP001962] and a draft plasmid sequence of 8,383 bp

content of 65.9%, similar to the T. scotoductus SA-01
chromosome of 64.9% (Table 1) and compared to the
approximately 69% of Thermus thermophilus. Based on
GC skew analysis, the origin of replication was identified
as the location of the gene dnaA which encodes the
chromosomal replication initiation protein DnaA (Figure
1). Manual curation of automatic annotation by deleting
overlapping genes and curating gene starts resulted in
2,506 CDS on the chromosome. Proteins of unknown
function, hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins constituted 21.4% of the total compared to 16.5%
and 18.9% for HB27 and HB8, respectively (Table 1).
Genome comparisons

For the majority of genes present in the T. scotoductus
SA-01 chromosome, their orthologous counterparts are
found in the T. thermophilus chromosomes and plasmids. However, the syntenies of genes have not been

preserved and the large plasmids of HB8 and HB27 contain genes, which are located on the chromosome in
SA-01 (Figures 1+2). Several loci on the SA-01 chromosome are absent from the chromosomes of T. thermophilus (Figures 1+2). The distribution of T. thermophilus
plasmid genes on the chromosome of T. scotoductus
seems to be arbitrary (Figure 2). Functional analysis of
the T. thermophilus megaplasmid genes using the Pathway Tools software showed that enzymes of several
metabolic pathways are almost completely encoded by
the plasmid genes, namely: coenzyme B12 synthesis and
metabolism; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis and adenosylcobalamin salvage pathways; dATP, dGTP and dUTP
biosynthetic pathways; neurosporene and siroheme biosynthesis; and many other genes encoding acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases, isomerases, oxidoreductase, glucosidases, galactosidases and other enzymes involved in the
secondary metabolism. The plasmid genes form neat
operon structures, for example the 9 genes of the

adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis pathway. This is consistent with the observation that operons might be considered as the basic unit of recombinational events
between species [23]. It may be hypothesized that these
operons were well organized within an ancestral genome, which served as a donor for the plasmid formation
in T. thermophilus after which an unknown genetic
burst randomized the genes on the chromosomes and
parts of the T. scotoductus chromosome were lost (Figure 2) with only 30 of the original megaplasmid genes
remaining (Additional file 1, Table S1). The lost genes
include the cobalamine biosynthesis pathway, plasmid
stability protein and parA and parB chromosome partitioning family proteins. The T. scotoductus loci which
were not found in the T. thermophilus chromosomes,
might represent sequences which were either deleted
from the chromosome of an ancestral organism or
could be genes acquired by lateral transfer.
Horizontally transferred genes and gene islands

The different approaches for identification of horizontally transferred genes, codon usage bias (Karlin’s Codon
Usage method and SIGI HMM), oligonucleotide usage
patterns (SeqWord Sniffer), database comparisons
(Island Pick as part of IslandView), G+C content, similarity searches or phylogenetic approaches for predicting

HT genes or gene islands show varying success. For this
reason we combined different approaches to try and
reach a consensus.
Based upon the initial analysis of the protein coding
genes of T. scotoductus SA-01 using Karlin’s codon
usage method [24], 171 (6.8%) ORFs showed codon
usage differences above the threshold values and were
identified as horizontally transferred candidate genes
(Additional file 2, Table S2). BLAST and phylogenetic
analysis showed that 80% of the HT genes showed
homology to those of organisms belonging to either closely or distantly related lineage. Laterally acquired genes
in T. scotoductus SA-01 show close homology with species belonging to diverse phyla predominantly within
the Bacterial domain (Additional file 3, Table S3). Putative donor prediction by BLAST, Neighbour Joining or
Maximum Likelihood prediction produced essentially
the same results. The majority of the acquired genes
(72%) are from species of the phylum DeinococcusThermus, supporting the evidence of lateral transfer
from other sister Thermus species [25]. Furthermore,
most of the horizontally acquired genes excluding the
Deinococcus-Thermus were either from distantly related
Proteobacteria (6%) or Firmicutes (13%) and many of
the genes have been transferred from microorganisms
either having hyperthermophilic (25.2%) or thermophilic

Gounder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:577
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/577

(58.5%) lifestyles (Additional file 3, Table S3). The high
proportion of genes from Firmicutes have been recently
recognized in thermophilic bacteria, particularly in the
genome sequence of Thermosipho africanus TCF52B,
and they emerged as principal donors in thermophiles
[26]. Phylogenetic analysis also identified the possible
closest homolog, which was the same as the best hit in
the majority of the cases (Additional file 3, Table S3).
Analysis of the Thermus thermophilus HB8 and HB27
genomes produced a similar number of putative HT
genes, 116 (5.8%) and 104 (5.21%) on the chromosomes
and 37 (14%) and 47 (21%) on the megaplasmids,
respectively (Additionale file 4, Table S4 for HB8 and
additional file 5, Table S5 for HB27). BLAST search of
the HT genes of T. thermophilus HB27 against the proteins of HB8 and SA-01 was performed to determine
which of the HT genes were shared (Additional file 6,
Table S6). Of the HB27 sequences, 56% and 35% had
homologs, while 37% and 6% of the homologs were also
predicted as alien, in HB8 and SA-01 respectively. Only
43 (29%) of the HB27 sequences had homologs in both
HB8 and SA-01. The HT genes of HB27 which are
absent in HB8 (and mostly in SA-01) are found in small
groups on the chromosome and megaplasmid. A significant fraction of the HT gene homologs of HB27 were
not predicted as HT genes in HB8 and SA-01. In some
cases, the gene next to the HB27 homolog in HB8 or
SA-01 were predicted as HT. This could be an effect of
amelioration or may reflect errors in the prediction so
the results should be interpreted with caution.
In SA-01 there are many inserts not found in T. thermophilus, which have an alternative oligonucleotide
composition compared to the chromosome. Islands I1,
I2, I5, I6 and I7 (Figure 1 + 2) of the predicted genomic
islands of SA-01 are inside the chromosomal loci that
are absent in T. thermophilus genomes (Figure 2), with
a part of I4 not present in T. thermophilus. Other strain
specific regions (e.g. Island 3) in the SA-01 genome
were adapted to the SA-01 sequence composition by the
genome amelioration process [27].
Hypothetical proteins form the major part of the
island genes, especially so for island 7. Island 1 contains
predominantly enzymes involved in O-antigen synthesis,
while enzymes involved in DNA processing and integration are interspersed. Island 5 hosts a variety of proteins
in common with Meiothermus ruber DSM 1279 (accession NC_013946) including von Willebrand factor
(TSC_C11350), conserved hypothetical proteins
(TSC_C11340, TSC_C11360 - TSC_C11380) and two
operons relating to metabolism of phenolics,
TSC_C11390 - TSC_C11440 and TSC_C11450 TSC_C11520, corresponding to MRUB_2676 MRUB_2681 and MRUB_2682 - MRUB2689, respectively. These appear to have been directly acquired from

Page 5 of 14

Meiothermus ruber DSM 1279, the former operon having undergone an inversion in SA-01 (Additional file 7,
Figure S1). The remainder of the genes in I5 have the
closest orthologs in T. thermophilus or a variety of
organisms including Geobacter, T. aquaticus, Deinococcus deserti, Leptospirillum or Anaeromyxobacter
dehalogenans.
A consensus prediction of HT islands can be seen in
Figure 1, with clusters of HT genes corresponding to
the predicted islands. The islands are also further highlighted by anomalous GC content. The association with
t-RNA genes (islands 1 and 6), a phage integrase gene
associated with tRNA-Ile and followed by 4 hypothetical
genes in a reverse direction to the integrase (island 2),
an ATP-dependent DNA helicase PcrA and a singlestranded nucleic acid binding protein which may be
parts of the former plasmid replication machinery
(island 3) and an IS4 family transposase (island 7), provide clues to the possible mechanism of integration.
Taken together with the comparison of the genomes of
SA-01, HB8 and HB27 and their putative HT genes, this
suggests that T. scotoductus SA-01 has a highly plastic
genome and that it has adapted to its subsurface environment by the acquisition or loss of genes or gene
islands.
Transporters, Sensing and Energy Metabolism

We have identified 22 ABC transporters, including
amino acid, phosphonate, phosphate, glucose, sugar,
taurine, polyamine, ribose, cation, sodium-alanine symporter, trehalose mycolates, ammonium transporter, and
other permeases (iron/zinc, glutathione, maltose, polypeptide, glycerol 3-phosphate, etc). Fe(III) iron import
(fbpC) and two multidrug resistance proteins (Figure 3).
T. scotoductus SA-01 retains pathways for glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA),
glyoxylate cycle and beta oxidation (Figure 3).
ATP synthesis is accomplished by type V ATPases,
which appear in a cluster of nine genes (TSC_C08720 TSC_C08800), compared to the V/A type in HB27. A
cluster of Sox genes (soxA, soxX, soxY, soxZ)
(TSC_C21050, TSC_C 21060, TSC_C 21090, TSC_C
21100, TSC_C 21110) are also present in the genome of
SA-01, located downstream of a number of cytochrome
c genes (TSC_C20900 - TSC_C20950; TSC_C20970),
which have a high similarity to the same proteins present in Thermus thermophilus HB8 and HB27 strains.
The cluster of sox genes present in T. thermophilus is
homologous to the sox genes present in sulfur-oxidizing
organisms [14] and might have been horizontally transferred from an Aquifex aeolicus like species with some
local rearrangements [25]. The presence of this sox
operon suggests that SA-01 can oxidize sulfur

compounds as a source of energy. The polysulfide
reductase TSC_C03450 (annotated as molybdopterin
oxidoreductase in SA-01) and NrfD (TSC_C10050)
which is not present in HB27 or HB8 enables SA-01 to
use S0 as electron acceptor [1,2]. The ability to reduce
sulfur using hydrogen or organic substrates is widespread amongst thermophiles. BLAST searches showed
that the closest orthologs of the TSC_C10050 are from
Thermincola sp. JR, Thermobaculum terrenum ATCC
BAA-798 (Yellowstone), Thermosinus carboxydivorans
Nor1 (hot spring), Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, Desulfitobacterium hafniense.
This suggests that the additional nrfD gene was obtained
by horizontal gene transfer after separation of SA-01
from the other Thermus species.
The diverse metabolic capacity, abundance of sensor
histidine kinases and transporters are indicative of oligotrophy, possibly in a dense and diverse population
which could provide carbon and nitrogen compounds
either from their metabolism or the breakdown of dead
cells. Wanger et al. [28] illustrated that prolific, organic
rich biofilms can be found at mineral surfaces in fracture zones in the deep subsurface and that these could
serve as a, so far underestimated, source of C, N and P

for cells in these biofilms. The absence of flagella proteins, but the presence of twitching motility proteins
(TSC_C01540 and TSC_C03160), chemotaxis transducer
proteins (TSC_C11960), PilT proteins TSC_C05390,
TSC_C12240, TSC_C 18160, TSC_C20130), enzymes for
S-layer synthesis (TSC_C19830, TSC_C24230,
TSC_c03240, TSC_C16520, TSC_C24210,) and an Slayer repressor (slrA) (TSC_C03800), suggest a sessile
lifestyle. Even in a planktonic phase, sufficient nutrients
could be available in the water to sustain essential metabolic processes [6], albeit slowly [28].
Aerobic respiration

The genome of T. scotoductus SA-01 encodes numerous
genes assigned to a classical electron transport chain.
Complex 1 NADH quinone oxidoreductases, nuoA - nuoN
are in a cluster (TSC_C6050 - TSC_C5920), nqo1
(TSC_C05330), and two quinone oxidoreductases, one
found on the plasmid (TSC_C14840, TSC_P80006). Complex II consists of succinate dehydrogenase (cytochrome
b556 subunit SdhC (TSC_C18990), SdhA (TSC_C17730),
SdhB1 and SdhB2 (TSC_C18960, TSC_C18970). SA-01
has the 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex including
dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase LpdA1 (TSC_C02350) and

Gounder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:577
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/577

LpdA2 (TSC_C02700). The terminal cytochrome oxidase
consists of 9 cytochrome c oxidase genes ctaC1
(TSC_C00920), caaA (TSC_C00930), ctaH, ctaE1, ctaE2,
ctaD1, coxM (TSC_C00960 - TSC_C01000) and ctaD2,
ctaC2 (TSC_C09680, TSC_C09681). Orthologous genes
for the recently described complex III of HB27 (TTC1567TTC1570) could be identified in SA-01 (TSC_C23640 TSC_C23670) [29,30].
Metal reduction, arsenic detoxification and respiration

Many bacteria and archaea, including SA-01 [1,2,8] display the ability to reduce metals [31]. These may be dissimilatory, detoxification or “accidental” processes. In
some cases, specific proteins have been isolated and
characterized e.g. the “chromate reductases” but significance of these activities remains uncertain, as it may be
a secondary activity unrelated to their physiological
roles [9].
Dissimilatory metal reduction is possibly the best studied in Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter. sulfurreducens with 42 and 90 c-type cytochromes respectively,
which may be indicative of their highly branched electron transfer transport systems that convey extensive
versatility in terms of electron acceptor utilization [32].
In addition, Marshall et al. [33] showed experimentally
that the c-type cytochromes of S. oneidensis MR-1 are
essential for the reduction of U(VI) and formation of
extracellular UO 2 nanoparticles. The 12 c-type cytochromes found in SA-01 may explain its metal reducing
abilities. BLAST analysis, however, indicate that none of
the c-type cytochromes present in T. scotoductus SA-01
are similar to those in S. oneidensis or G. sulfurreducens.
Arsenite oxidase genes aoxA (TSC_C14700), aoxB
(TSC_C14680) and the arsR transcription regulator
(TSC_C14690), a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional repressor (TSC_C14720) form a cluster in SA-01.
In HB8, the large and small subunit genes are found on
the plasmid with the arsR located on the chromosome
(TTHA0483). In addition SA-01 contains three more
arsR transcriptional regulator genes; TSC_C04800
upstream of a nickel resistance protein, TSC_C14260
upstream of hyfB,C,E,F,G; NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 7 and a soluble hydrogenase small subunit in a cluster and TSC_C16260
upstream of a AAA-ATPase. The arsenite oxidase converts arsenite to arsenate and is probably part of a
detoxification pathway [34] but the presence of an
arsenite oxidase suggests that aerobic arsenic respiration
is possible by SA-01. Aerobic arsenite respiration (using
arsenite as electron donor) is well known in chemolithoautotrophs [35]. The dissimilatory use of As(V) as
electron acceptor by a Thermus isolate HR13
was described by Gihring and Banfield [36] who
proposed that HR13 could oscillate between arsenite

Page 7 of 14

detoxification and arsenate respiration in microaerophilc
culture. HR13 could however not grow with As(III) as
sole energy source indicating that the As(III) oxidising
system was probably not respiratory. Their cultures
were however not aerated so this question is not
resolved. Apart from the arsenate reductase
(TSC_C23460), none of the other arsenate respiratory
proteins are found in SA-01. Arsenite oxidation was also
demonstrated for Thermus aquaticus and Thermus thermophilus [37]. Complete arsenic redox cycling has so far
been observed only in Thermus [36], Bacillus [38] species and Marinobacter santoriniensis [39,40].
The ArsR family represents a class of transcriptional
regulatory proteins that allowing prokaryotes to respond
to stress induced by heavy metal toxicity [41].
TSC_C14260 has an ortholog in Desulfouridis audaxviator (e-value = 5e-11).
Denitrification

Complete reduction of nitrate to ammonia can occur via
the assimilatory nitrate reductase and cytochrome c-552
(cycA1,2,3), (TSC_C00210, TSC_C07570, TSC_C31130)
and a ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (TSC_C11790). A
nitrate inducible formate dehydrogenaseTSC_C10040
can also couple to the respiratory nitrate reductase to
generate a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic
membrane.
A DNA fragment named the “nitrate respiratory conjugative element” in a different Thermus thermophilus
strain [7,42] codes for the nar and nrc operons as well
as their regulatory machinery. In T. thermophilus, the
nrcDEFN operon is located upstream of the nar operon.
The corresponding sequence in SA-01 codes for a
NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase B subunit and two hypothetical proteins corresponding to NrcE
and NrcD (TSC_C17720 - TSC_C17750) (Figure 4). The
C-terminal 94 amino acids of the NrcE equivalent of
SA-01, which consists of 111 amino acids, shows 87%
identity with residues 270 - 363 of T. thermophilus
NrcE which is absent in HB27 and HB8. Presumably
this complex could be functional in SA-01.
Downstream of the nrc operon in T. thermophilus [7],
lies the nar operon consisting of narCGHJIKT. In SA01, the genes for a nitrite extrusion protein, narK1,
narI, narJ, narH, narG and a periplasmic cytochrome c
gene, which are not present in HB27 or HB8, form a
cluster (TSC_C17460 - TSC_C17520) adjacent to regulatory protein A and a denitrification regulator
(TSC_C17530 and TSC_C17540) which is the start of a
large cluster of genes, completing the denitrification
process up to nitrous oxide (Figures 3+4). The cluster
contains ferredoxin 1, a conserved hypothetical proteins,
coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein PqqE, nitrite reductase, conserved hypothetical protein, nitric oxide

reductase subunit b NorB, NorC and what seems a copper containing nitrite reductase (TSC_C17530 TSC_C17620), transcriptional regulator, cation binding
domain protein, NADH dehydrogenase and succinate
dehydrogenase b subunit (Figure 4). A ferredoxin nitrite
reductase (TSC_C11790) is also found in HB27 and
HB8. The presence of both a cytochrome cd1 and a
copper containing nitrite reductases in the same organism is exceptional. Distant orthologs of the NarK1 protein (only in HB27), the alpha and beta subunit of
nitrate reductase and the periplasmic cytochrome are
found in HB27 and HB8. BLAST searches, however,
indicated that the closest orthologs of all the other
genes, except for ferredoxin 1 (TSC_C17750) which is
found in HB27 and HB8, were from Thermus thermophilus [7] (all except copper containing nitrite reductase
and hypothetical protein TSC_C17590), Meiothermus
silvanus DSM 9946, Haloferax volcanii DS2, Persephonella marina EX-H1, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus
TK-6 and Thioalkalivibrio sp. K90mix (Additional file 1,
Table S1). The entire segment of DNA therefore
appears to have been acquired by the Thermus thermophilus and Thermus scotoductus SA-01 from a distant

donor/s. These genes were however not identified as
acquired by any of the methods used. Balkwill et al [2]
showed that T. scotoductus SA-01 could grow using
nitrate as terminal electron acceptor.
DNA transformation

Natural competence (the ability to take up and process
exogenous DNA in specific growth conditions) has been
observed in T. thermophilus strains. High frequencies of
natural transformation has been displayed by this organism [43,44] and Schwarzenlander and Averhoff [21] proposed that the extraordinary broad substrate specificity of
the highly efficient T. thermophilus HB27 DNA uptake
system may contribute significantly to thermoadaptation
of the organism by interdomain DNA transfer in hot
environments. The natural transformation system of HB27
comprises at least 16 distinct competence proteins [45,46].
Among the 16 competence proteins the genes encoding
PilM, PilN, PilO, PilW, and PilQ are found to be most
essential for rendering natural transformation [20]. Several
genes associated with transformation have been identified
in SA-01. These include pilQ (TSC_C20070), pilM, pilN,
pilO, and pilW (TSC_C20660 - TSC_C20690), pilF

(TSC_C01550) pilC (TSC_C07140), pilD (TSC_C02040)
comEA (TSC_C25010), comEC/rec2 (TSC_C25020),
comF (TSC_C07880), comZ (TSC_C07710), dprA
(TSC_C06380) and competence-damage protein CinA
(TSC_C04130). In addition a FimA (TSC_C24040) and
four PilT domain proteins (TSC_C05390, TSC_C12240,
TSC_C18160, TSC_C20130) are present. TSC_C12240
and TSC_C20130 are absent in HB8 and HB27 while
TSC_C18160 is found in HB27. PilA is absent in SA-01
and HB8, but present in HB27. Four Thermus species, T.
thermophilus HB27 and HB8, T. flavus AT62, T. caldophilus GK24, and T. aquaticus YT1 have been demonstrated
to be naturally competent, with HB27 showing the highest
transformation frequency [43] with a maximal uptake rate
of about 40 kb/s per cell [21] and with a broad specificity
[21,22].
The transformation assays with T. scotoductus SA-01
cultures consistently showed colonies (20-30) with the
cells incubated with the pMKNor plasmid but not with
those incubated without DNA. The number of T. thermophilus PRQ25 transformants was tenfold more with
pMKNor than those obtained for T. scotoductus. Therefore, we concluded that T. scotoductus SA1 can be
transformed with plasmids carrying DNA sequences
homologues to its chromosome. To confirm transformation in T. scotoductus SA1, we compared the total protein pattern of the transformant colonies with that of
the parental strain, and also carried out PCR amplification of the nirK gene, which is specific for T. scotoductus SA1. The results (Additional file 8, Figure S2) clearly
demonstrate that transformants corresponds to T. scotoductus SA-01 and not to any contamination by other
strain.
No putative self-replicating plasmid could be isolated
by standard methods or by following a procedure for
the isolation of total genomic DNA. No plasmid-like
bands were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and
transformation of E. coli ultra-competent cell preparations and selection on kanamycin plates was also unsuccessful. No colonies could be found which lost the
kanamycin resistance after several rounds of growth
without the antibiotic, whereas in T. thermophilus the
pMK18 derivative was easily lost by this procedure [47].
Transformation with pMKNor is probably due to integration of the plasmid into the chromosome by homologous recombination.
It has been proposed [20] that the PilA 1-4 proteins
may form a transformation shaft, which transports the
DNA through the outer membrane into the periplasmic
space. The possibility exists that the presence of PilA in
HB27 and not in HB8 and SA-01 may be partly responsible for the superior transformability of HB27. Inactivation of the Thermus traffic ATPase PilF led to a loss of
competence although the pili remained intact [45]. The

Page 9 of 14

Thermus PilF could be functionally similar to the gonococcal [48,49] and Pseudomonas stutzeri retraction
ATPase PilT [48,50], which was demonstrated to be
essential for competence. The role of the four PilT
domain proteins in SA-01 needs to be elucidated. It is
however evident that SA-01 possesses the machinery
enabling it to take up DNA and that this may be partly
responsible for its adaptation to higher temperatures.
DNA protection and repair

The synthesis of carotenoids by HB27 and HB8, which
imparts a yellow color to the cultures, has been proposed as an additional membrane and DNA protection
mechanism [15,51]. The entire gene cluster TTP57TTP67 as well as the UV endonuclease is absent in SA01. Considering that SA-01 was isolated from water collected more than 3 kilometers underground and that it
probably resided there for a significant period of time, it
evidences in favor of the photo-protective role of the
carotenoids.
T. scotoductus SA-01 has genes for repair pathways that
include DNA replication, recombination and repair recA
(TSC_C04150), ruvB (TSC_C19140), uvrA (TSC_C19840),
uvrB (TSC_C24200), gyrA (TSC_C04920), gyrB
(TSC_C22740), which were all upregulated in Deinococcus
radiodurans after gamma radiation, but it is lacking in
katA, terB, terZ, mrsA and dps, which encode for proteins
alleviating oxidative stress [52]. In Deinococcus radiodurans, a recA deficient mutant was shown to be gamma ray
sensitive. Wild type recA could complement the gamma
ray sensitivity of E. coli recA1- strain [53]. SA-01 contains
the cinA, ligase and recA in a cluster (TSC_C0413004150), as well as recF (TSC_C01050), recR (TSC_C21330)
and recO (TSC_C13980). The RecA independent recombination repair system seems to be absent in SA-01. Of the
hypothetical proteins upregulated by irradiation of Deinococcus [52], only DdrA showed homology to two proteins
TSC_C06080 and TSC_C16120, which are Rad52/22 double-strand break repair protein in SA-01. These genes are
also absent in the Desulfouridis audaxviator genome [6]. It
seems then that the deep subsurface represents a less challenging environment, where mostly gamma radiation
damage needs to be dealt with, possibly at lower levels.
The RecA-dependent recombination repair system, similar
to D. radiodurans could presumably be sufficient
protection.
Viral Resistance

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) are a distinctive feature of the genomes of most Bacteria and Archaea and are thought to
be involved in resistance to bacteriophages with a resistance specificity determined by similarity between the
spacers and phage sequences [54,55]. Using a

Gounder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:577
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/577

CRISPRFinder online program (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/
Server/CRISPRfinder.php/) on the T. scotoductus SA-01
chromosome revealed three CRISPR regions (CRISPR1:
575014 - 575590; CRISPR2: 1182085 - 1184314;
CRISPR3: 1194463 - 1197065). Regions 2 and 3 are
associated with CRISPR associated proteins. In HB27
and HB8 we find 10 and 11 CRISPRs respectively, with
only two on the chromosome and the remaining 8 or 9
on the megaplasmid. The presence of an intact CRISPR
system could imply that the ancestral genome may have
suffered an invasion of exogenous genetic components,
but that with subsequent rearrangement and deletion
events most of these were lost by SA-01 or that the T.
thermophilus faced a more phage challenging environment after separation from T. scotoductus.

Conclusions
Members of the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus are
known for their resistance to heat and radiation. The
Thermus spp. are of the most widely spread [7] and
have colonized a number of environments typical for
themophilic organisms. It should therefore come as no
surprise that a Thermus species should be found in the
deep subsurface with ambient rock temperatures of 60°
C or higher [5] at the depth where Thermus scotoductus
SA-01 was discovered (3.2.kmbs). Fission track analysis
in apatite in the Wits basin suggests that only
hyperthermophiles could have existed at these depths
and that current microbial communities must have
migrated to these depths more recently [56]. Hyperthermophilic organisms currently found at these depths
could be descendants of those initial inhabitants [56]
and could have served as donors of genetic material to
SA-01, assisting in thermoadaptation. The natural competence of T. scotoductus SA-01 could have been instrumental in the adaptation to these hot environments
[19]. The earlier notion that most of the megaplasmid
genes of HB27 and HB8 may be responsible for thermophily [15] may need reconsideration as SA-01 has dispensed with many of them.
The adaptability of SA-01, and Thermus in general, is
highlighted by the extreme genome plasticity, loss of
nonessential genes (e.g. carotenoid synthesis and UV
endonuclease) and the acquisition of large islands subsequent to separation of SA-01 and Thermus thermophilus, the most significant of these being island 5
(chlorophenolic metabolism) and the insert containing
the “nitrate respiratory conjugative element”. SA-01 also
has a number of aerobic and anaerobic respiratory
options, further highlighting its metabolic versatility and
its ability to sustain itself under varying conditions.
The genome of Thermus scotoductus SA-01 illustrates
how rapid adaptation can be achieved by maintaining a
highly dynamic and plastic genome. The possibility that

Page 10 of 14

it could sometimes be polyploid [16] has not been investigated, but it would be surprising if this was not the
case.

Methods
Sequencing strategy

A 454 pyrosequencing/Sanger hybrid approach was used
for whole genome sequencing of T. scotoductus SA-01.
Genomic DNA from T. scotoductus SA-01 (ATCC
700910) was extracted from cells grown overnight at 65°
C in TYG [5 g tryptone, 3 g yeast extract and 1 g glucose in 1 L dH2O] liquid culture, using the FastDNA®
SPIN Kit (Qbiogene). 454 sequencing was performed at
Inqaba Biotech, Pretoria, South Africa. The methods
were all standard protocols developed for the Roche
GS20/FLX sequencer. The raw reads obtained were
assembled into contigs using the 454 de novo Newbler
Assembly software. A representative fosmid library of T.
scotoductus SA-01 was constructed in Escherichia coli
EPI300 cells using the pCC1FOS fosmid vector and the
Copy Control Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies). Subsequently, 384 terminal DNA
sequences of cloned genomic inserts were determined
with an ABI 3730 × l DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were processed with Phred [57,58] and
assembled with existing contigs by using the Phrap
assembly tool [59]. Sequence editing of fosmid-end
sequences and 454 sequences was done using GAP4 as
part of the Staden software package [60]. Ambiguities
and gaps were resolved using PCR and primer walking
on purified DNA of selected fosmid clones.
11.1.1. Gene Prediction and Annotation

The DNA sequence was submitted to the TIGR/JCVI
Annotation Engine (http://www.tigr.org/AnnotationEngine), where it was run through TIGR’s prokaryotic
annotation pipeline. This initial automated annotation
was verified and edited manually by using criteria such
as the presence of a ribosome-binding site, GC frame
plot analysis and similarity to known protein-encoding
sequences (CDS). Functional annotation was done by
using the ERGO tool from Integrated Genomics with a
two-step approach. Initially, all proteins were screened
against Swiss-Prot data and publicly available protein
sequences from other related organisms. All predictions
were verified and modified manually by comparing the
protein sequences with the Pfam, GenBank, ProDom,
COG, and Prosite public databases. Tmpred was used to
predict transmembrane helices within CDS (http://www.
ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html).
Comparative Genomics

The proteins obtained from the genome sequence of T.
scotoductus SA-01 was bi-directionally blasted (A Wollherr - personal communication) against three chosen

Gounder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:577
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/577

organisms using blastp from the NCBI-Blast suite. The
EMBOSS package was used to evaluate reciprocal blast
hits by global Needleman-Wunsch-Alignments. The
entire proteome from T. scotoductus SA-01 has been
compared to the proteins from the related species Thermus thermophilus HB8, Thermus thermophilus HB27
and the deep mine isolate Desulfouridis auduxviator.
The global alignment of complete chromosomal
sequences was performed by Mauve [61]. The Pathways
Tools package [62-64] was used for reconstruction of
metabolic pathways based on the genome annotation.
Horizontally transferred genes

Several methods have been proposed so far to identify
putative horizontally acquired genes. These methods are
based on either deciphering atypical DNA composition
or anomalous phylogenetic distribution of the genes
under investigation. To get the most reliable set of candidate horizontally transferred genes in T. scotoductus
SA-01 a combination of horizontally transferred genes
detection methods/tools were applied. Horizontally
transferred genomic islands were predicted by the SeqWord Genome Browser tool [65] and its semi-automatic
implementation SeqWord Sniffer [66] available at http://
www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/ and using the IslandViewer
web portal (http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/query.php) that combines the prediction results
of three genomic island identification algorithms: IslandPick [67,68], SIGI-HMM [69] and IslandPath-DIMOB
[70]. Alien (horizontally transferred) genes in T. scotoductus SA-01, T. thermophilus HB8 and T. thermophilus
HB27 were identified by Karlins’s codon bias method
[24] using the Predicted Highly expressed and Putative
Alien genes web tool (http://www.cmbl.uga.edu/software/phxpa.html). This method is suitable for identifying highly expressed genes and also genes which have
been laterally acquired [71,72]. All the putative HT gene
products of SA-01 were BLASTed against the nonredundant protein database using BlastP with an e-value
cut-off 1e-10 [73,74]. Paralogs were removed and the
query sequence plus resultant hit sequences were used
to infer the evolutionary history using the NeighborJoining [75] and Maximum Likelihood [76] methods
with bootstrapping (1000 replicates) using MEGA5 [77].
Taxonomic and lifestyle based information of each predicted donor species was retrieved from the NCBI. The
putative HT genes for T. thermophilus HB27 were also
BLASTed against the genome sequences of T. thermophilus HB8 and T. scotoductus SA-01 to compare the
putative HT genes in the three genomes.
Natural competence

For transformation experiments Thermus scotoductus
SA1 pre-inocula were grown overnight at 60°C in TBmq

Page 11 of 14

medium (8 g/L trypticase, 4g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L
NaCl, MiliQ water) at half strength under aeration (180
rpm, 1/5 Erlenmeyer volume) and re-inoculated in a
1:100 ratio in the same medium. After 6 hours of incubation under the above conditions, 0.5 mL subcultures
were separated into 12 mL sterile tubes to which 300 ng
of plasmid DNA preparations was added. After 16
hours, the cells were plated on 1× TB prepared with
carbonate-rich mineral water, and containing 30 mg/L
of kanamycin. Parallel cultures without DNA were
always plated as controls. Plates were incubated in a wet
chamber for 48 hours at 60°C.
DNA samples used in these experiments were isolated
from E. coli DH5a [supE44, Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 (F80
lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi I relA1]. A
derivative of a bifunctional plasmid (pMK18) that replicates in both E. coli and T. thermophilus and confers
thermostable resistance to kanamycin in both organisms
at their respective optimal growth temperatures [78],
was used. The plasmid (pMKNor) contained a 2396 bp
DNA fragment encoding the nor genes from T. thermophilus PRQ25 [79,80] [GenBank: FN666415]. This
sequence is very similar (87% DNA identity) to the
equivalent genes of T. scotoductus SA1, so it was
expected that homologous recombination could take
place between the plasmid and the chromosome.
To confirm transformation in T. scotoductus SA1, we
compared the total proteins pattern of the transformant
colonies with that of the parental strain, and also carried
out PCR amplification of the nirK gene (Primers: Kdir
CCGGAGTTTTTATGTACCACTGC;Krev
GGCCCCACGTTCAGGAAGTA), which is specific for
T. scotoductus SA-01.
