Seasonal influences on sleep and executive
function in the migratory White-crowned Sparrow
(Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii)

Abstract
Background: We have previously shown that the White-crowned Sparrow (WCS) decreases sleep by 60% during a
period of migratory restlessness relative to a non-migratory period when housed in a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle.
Despite this sleep reduction, accuracy of operant performance was not impaired, and in fact rates of responding
were elevated during the migratory period, effects opposite to those routinely observed following enforced sleep
deprivation. To determine whether the previously observed increases in operant responding were due to improved
performance or to the effects of migration on activity level, here we assessed operant performance using a task in
which optimal performance depends on the bird’s ability to withhold a response for a fixed interval of time
(differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate-behavior, or DRL); elevated response rates ultimately impair performance by
decreasing access to food reward. To determine the influence of seasonal changes in day length on sleep and
behavioral patterns, we recorded sleep and assessed operant performance across 4 distinct seasons (winter, spring,
summer and fall) under a changing photoperiod.
Results: Sleep amount changed in response to photoperiod in winter and summer, with longest sleep duration in
the winter. Sleep duration in the spring and fall migratory periods were similar to what we previously reported,
and were comparable to sleep duration observed in summer. The most striking difference in sleep during the
migratory periods compared to non-migratory periods was the change from discrete day-night temporal
organization to an almost complete temporal fragmentation of sleep. The birds’ ability to perform on the DRL task
was significantly impaired during both migratory periods, but optimal performance was sustained during the two
non-migratory periods.
Conclusions: Birds showed dramatic changes in sleep duration across seasons, related to day length and
migratory status. Migration was associated with changes in sleep amount and diurnal distribution pattern, whereas
duration of sleep in the non-migratory periods was largely influenced by the light-dark cycle. Elevated response
rates on the DRL task were observed during migration but not during the short sleep duration of summer,
suggesting that the migratory periods may be associated with decreased inhibition/increased impulsivity. Although
their daily sleep amounts and patterns may vary by season, birds are susceptible to sleep loss throughout the year,
as evidenced by decreased responding rates following enforced sleep deprivation.

Background
Migratory songbirds appear to have an unprecedented
ability to withstand the effects of sleep loss during the
migratory period. In the wild, despite marked reductions
in apparent opportunity to sleep, they continue to
engage in adaptive waking behaviors including prolonged flight, complex navigation, and predator evasion
and foraging in novel environments. In the captive
White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), we have previously shown that during periods of
migratory restlessness, sparrows reduced sleep duration
by an average of 60% relative to the non-migratory state
[1], a finding supported in other avian species [1-4].
Despite this apparent sleep reduction, migratory sparrows showed no deficits in learning or performance in a
standard operant task when compared to non-migrating
sparrows. Given that cognitive and performance deficits
are some of the most consistent consequences of sleep
loss in mammals [5], the preservation of neurobehavioral performance seems surprising. However, are all
aspects of executive function intact during the migratory
period and what are the separate or distinct contributions played by migratory state and/or sleep duration in
these executive function processes?
In our previous study, we reported that during the
migratory period birds maintained the ability to learn a
new sequence of key pecks each day and were consistently able to execute a previously learned sequence of
key pecks at a level comparable to that observed during
the non-migratory periods [1]. However, although accuracy of operant performance was not impaired by migratory status, we did observe that rates of responding were
significantly higher during the migratory period relative
to the non-migratory period. Increased response rates in
this context ultimately proved adaptive since they were
concomitant with increased food reinforcement and
allowed the migrating birds to meet their higher caloric
needs. However, in this operant schedule, it was not
possible to determine whether the elevated response
rate during the migratory period was a consequence of a
greater motivation to work for food reward or related to
a general increase in activity. Here we sought to determine whether birds in the migratory state will increase
operant responding whether that responding is adaptive
or maladaptive.
Our previous observations of sleep and operant behavior in the White-crowned Sparrow were made during
one fall migratory period and one late summer nonmigratory period. Birds were housed under photoperiodic conditions of 12 h:12 h LD, so that the observed
changes were attributable to endogenous migratory factors rather than to the combined effects of migratory
status and a seasonally changing photoperiod. However,

not only do the seasonal changes in day length affect
the organization and timing of avian migration [6,7],
these changes also have substantial effects on sleep
duration outside of the migratory period in the few
avian species that have been studied under natural
conditions [8-10]. In captive European Starlings (Sturnus-vulgaris) housed under naturalistic photoperiodic
conditions, sleep duration in early spring is ~10%
shorter than that observed in mid-winter [9]. During
mid-winter, when the dark period is 16 hours, the captive Rook (Corvus frugilegus) was shown to sleep ~37%
of the 24 hour period, whereas during the short 7 hour
dark period of summer, sleep occupied only ~20% of
the 24 hour period [8]. Thus, in at least some avian species, decreases in sleep duration closely parallel seasonal
increases in day length. Under naturalistic conditions, it
is likely that daily sleep amounts in the White-crowned
Sparrow change not only in response to migratory
status, but also to seasonal changes in daylight exposure.
In this study we assessed the effects of the light-dark
cycle and migratory status on sleep patterns in the
White-crowned sparrow and examined the contributions
of migratory status and sleep duration on operant performance. Specifically, we have characterized the electrophysiological correlates of sleep for one 24 hour
period during four distinct seasons-winter, spring, summer and fall-using an adjusting, species-specific photoperiod designed to simulate the lighting conditions
typically experienced in the wild by the WCS. Operant
performance was assessed in these same four seasons
using a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate-behavior
(DRL) procedure, a task in which optimal performance
depends on the bird’s ability to withhold a response for
a fixed interval of time; elevated response rates ultimately impair performance by decreasing access to food
reward. The DRL procedure is routinely used to assess
behavioral inhibition, or its converse, impulsivity [11].

Methods
Subjects

White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) were captured in California (Sutter and Colusa
counties) between March 2004 and March 2005. For the
assessment of sleep a total of 13 birds were recorded, 12
of which were ultimately analyzed for sleep/wake scoring (SLPs). One was analyzed in three seasons (Summer,
Fall and Winter), two were analyzed for two seasons
(Spring and Summer) and the remaining 9 were analyzed for one season each. 15 DRL birds (DRLs) were
assessed for 4 seasons after birds had learned the task,
defined as stable performance (4 consecutive sessions
with response rate for each session varying by no more
than 10% of the mean response rate across all 4 of those

Jones et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/87

sessions), before entering a migratory season. Therefore,
each bird was studied for 2 non-migratory seasons and
2 migratory seasons. Migratory birds do not display
activity patterns consistent with frank migratory activity
for the whole of the spring or fall. However, for the purposes of this study, unless stated otherwise, birds
selected from the spring or fall were always in the active
migratory state and displaying activity patterns which
typify this state, including increased nocturnal activity.
Similarly, birds in the summer and winter are always in
the non-migratory state. All birds were captured using
mist nets under authorization granted by the California
Department of Fish and Game and the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Sparrows were transported to the University of Wisconsin - Madison where they were individually housed
in galvanized wire cages (L: 35 cm × W: 25 cm × H: 32
cm) in environmentally controlled rooms (L: 4.0 m ×
W: 2.7 m × H: 2.7 m; 22.0 - 24.5°C, 40% relative humidity). Each bird was in visual and auditory contact with
other birds in the room. Their daily diet consisted of a
seed mixture (Finch Mix, Mounds Pet Food Warehouse,
Middleton, WI), grit, romaine lettuce, and one mealworm. The SLPs had access to food and water ad libitum. DRLs had their food restricted for 3 hours per day
(see Behavioral Procedures), except on weekends, and
access to water was not available during 30-minute test
sessions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and followed NIH
guidelines. The study was conducted in an AAALACaccredited facility.
Photoperiods

The photoperiods in housing and testing rooms
approximated seasonal and geographic changes in day
length appropriate for these birds based on their typical
location. Dawn and dusk times were changed each Friday evening to reflect the day length at the expected
location of Z.l. gambelii on that day of the year. Winter
and summer photoperiods were based on US Naval
Observatory (http://aa.usno.navy.mil./data) sunrise/sunset tables for Sacramento, CA and Fairbanks, AK,
respectively. Spring and fall photoperiods were based on
a linear approximation of a direct route between Sacramento and Fairbanks and observed arrival and departure
dates [12]. Illuminance during the dark phase was < 0.5
lux. Illuminance during the light phase was 540 - 640
lux measured at the level of the cage floor. Photoperiods
for days selected for sleep scoring were as follows:
spring 14.75:9.25 LD, summer 21.5:2.5 LD, fall
13.75:10.25 to 16.0:8.0 LD and winter 9.5:14.5 LD. Bird
behavior was more variable during the fall, so that

Page 3 of 19

recordings for birds in this group were obtained on
different days, with correspondingly different lengths
of simulated daylight. Operant data were analyzed
from birds under the same photoperiodic conditions as
above, except in fall when photoperiods ranged from
11.5:12.5LD to 16.0:8LD.
Activity monitoring

Selection of days for sleep scoring from each season was
partly based on data from activity monitoring. To measure daily activity, an infrared (IR) photocell sensor
(Invisible-Beam Entry Alert, Radio Shack, Fort Worth,
TX) was centered behind each bird’s home cage, 18 cm
from the floor and 17.5 cm from either side of the cage.
The sensor was positioned to project the photobeam
parallel to and above two perches so that hops and
flights from one side to the other disrupted the beam.
Beam breaks were tallied every 30 seconds (i.e., interval
recording, with 2880 intervals per day) using VitalView
(version 4.0) software and transmitter equipment (Mini
Mitter Co., Inc., Bend, OR). Although the infrared activity monitoring system may be prone to some inaccuracy
because it is insensitive to activity unless the bird
crosses the center-line of the cage and overly sensitive
to activity when the bird remains near the center of the
cage and on the perches, it nevertheless offers a rapid
method for assessing gross seasonal changes in behavior.
SLPs behavior was also continuously recorded using two
infrared-sensitive cameras per bird connected to a digital video storage system (IView PC, Salient Systems
Corp., http://www.salientsys.com). Infrared illuminators
provided lighting for the cameras during the dark phase.
Cameras were positioned on opposite sides of each cage,
to afford maximum potential for visual monitoring of
behavior. Cameras (commonly available for recording
and transmitting over the Internet) were used inside the
test chambers to view DRLs during sessions.
Surgery

Only SLPs received surgery. Surgical procedures were
performed under isoflurane anesthesia (1.0%-3.5% isoflurane with 500 ml/min O2). The bird’s head was stabilized in a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga,
California, United States), cranial feathers were removed
and an incision was made along the midline of the head
to expose the cranium. Six small holes were drilled
through the cranium to the dura: Two holes were drilled
on each hemisphere of the anterior forebrain 2 mm lateral to the midline over the hyperpallium (Wulst). Two
additional holes were drilled 2 mm posterior to the
anterior holes so that signal was recorded from both the
anterior and posterior hyperpallium. Two holes were
positioned over the midline of the cerebellum to

Jones et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/87

accommodate the common reference electrode and the
ground. Teflon insulated stainless steel electrodes
(#791400, A-M Systems Sequim, Washington, United
States) were inserted through the holes to the level of
the dura and held in place with surgical adhesive
(Tissuemend II, Veterinary Products Laboratories, Phoenix, Arizona, United States).
Each electrode was connected to a lightweight, flexible, and electrically shielded recording cable designed
for use with small birds [13] (Dragonfly, Inc., Ridgeley,
West Virginia, United States). This cable was attached
to the skull using dental acrylic (Justi Products, Oxnard,
California, United States), and the incision was closed
around the acrylic with surgical adhesive (Tissuemend
II, Veterinary Products Laboratories, Phoenix, Arizona,
United States). Following surgery, each bird was placed
in the recording cage and provided with at least 14 days
of postoperative recovery and adaptation to the recording cable before experimental observation began.
Electrophysiological recording

The recording cable was attached to a low torque
6-channel mercury commutator and the weight of the
recording cable was counterbalanced with a spring;
these recording conditions allowed birds to move unimpeded throughout the cage. The EEG signals were referenced to the cerebellar electrode, amplified and band
pass filtered (0.3 - 30 Hz and 10 - 90 Hz, respectively)
using Grass-telefactor amplifiers (Model 12 Neurodata
and 7P511, http://www.grass-telefactor.com) and digitized at 100 Hz (National Instruments PCI 6071E card,
http://www.ni.com and Somnologica 2, Flaga hf. Medical
Devices, http://www.medcare.com). EEG signals were
viewed using Somnologica 3 software (Flaga hf. Medical
Devices, http://www.medcare.com).
Sleep-wakefulness scoring

Actograms (e.g., see Figure 1) generated from the IR
activity data demonstrated that daytime activity was
moderate to high in all seasons. Migratory-specific behavior was best characterized by nighttime IR beam-breaking activity. Blocks consisting of several consecutive days
of nocturnal activity were selected for each bird. Video
footage was reviewed to ascertain that video quality on
the day selected for scoring was adequate. To assess
extremes of sleep-wakefulness behavior during nonmigratory seasons, days for scoring were chosen during
the longest (summer) and shortest (winter) photoperiods.
Days were also selected during spring and fall migratory
periods when nocturnal activity appeared maximal. We
eliminated days for which video recordings were not consistent with IR-measured activity, e.g., a bird slept
perched near the middle of the cage and generated many
IR beam-breaks with small involuntary movements. The

Page 4 of 19

EEG and video recordings were reviewed concurrently to
ascertain EEG quality, ensuring that the EEG was not
obscured by motion artifact (outside of active wakefulness) and that the quality of the tracing was sufficient to
distinguish among vigilance states (wakefulness, drowsiness, SWS, REM sleep). For each of the seasons of winter,
spring and summer, we were able to find at least a single
date that met these criteria for all the birds being
recorded at those times. Fall migratory behavior was
more variable within and between birds, both in timing
and in day-to-day consistency, than spring migratory
behavior, as previously reported [14]; this necessitated
the use of data from different days for different birds.
During each season, 4 or 5 birds produced 24-hour
records (activity, video, and EEG) that fit our selection
criteria, resulting in a total of 16 scored records across
four seasons. Unfortunately, data for individual birds
could not be collected across all seasons, as EEG signals
typically degraded within 3 - 9 months, and, consequently, 10 of the 13 birds were recorded during one
season only; 2 birds were recorded for two seasons and
1 was recorded for three seasons. One fall bird originally
selected for sleep scoring was ultimately not used in our
final data analysis; although IR data indicated that this
bird was in the migratory state on the date selected to
score his sleep, he was not, on closer inspection of the
video, actively engaged in nocturnal migratory activity,
and no other migratory days for this bird had EEG data
of usable quality. As a result, only 3 fall birds were used
in the final data analysis.
Vigilance state was manually scored in 4 s epochs using
simultaneous EEG and video recordings. Each epoch was
categorized as either wakefulness, drowsiness, SWS or
REM sleep based on visual inspection of the EEG from
both hemispheres, as well as by analysis of recorded
behavior using the standard criteria: Wakefulness was
characterized by a high-frequency low-amplitude EEG in
both hemispheres. Behavior during wakefulness included
hopping and flying around the cage, feeding, drinking,
feather preening, and actively scanning the room. During
drowsiness, EEG activity was intermediate between that
of wakefulness and SWS (i.e., increased amplitude in the
low-frequency range relative to wakefulness). Behavioral
evidence of drowsiness included birds holding their
heads close to their bodies and the position of the eyelids
fluctuating between open, partially closed, and completely closed states. During SWS, EEG activity was dominated by slow waves of the highest amplitude.
Behaviorally birds were motionless, with closed eyes; the
head was either pulled in toward the body and facing forward or resting on the bird’s back. REM sleep epochs in
birds tend to be brief [15]. In this study, a 4-sec epoch
was scored as REM sleep if the EEG amplitude was
reduced by at least one-half the amplitude seen in the

Figure 1 This double plotted actogram shows activity for a representative bird over the course of approximately 30 months, including
2005 when the sleep data for this paper were collected. Vertical yellow lines indicate seasonal changes in daylight. Seasons from which birds
were selected for sleep analyses are highlighted (winter (blue) n = 4, spring (green) n = 5, summer (red) n = 4, fall (brown) n = 3). Photoperiods for
the winter, spring, summer, and fall seasons were, respectively, 9.5:14.5 LD, 14.75:9.25 LD, 21.5:2.5 LD, and 13.75:10.25 to 16.0:8.0 LD.

previous SWS episode and this amplitude reduction
lasted for longer than 2 seconds and was accompanied by
behavioral signs of REM sleep including muscle hypotonia (feather or head drooping) or, rarely, eye movements.
Bouts of sleep were defined as the length of time from a
SWS onset to the next bout of wakefulness (W), and
waking bout length was likewise defined as the length of

time from the onset of W to an epoch of SWS. We also
calculated the ratio of sleep bout length to waking bout
length as a measure of relative sleep stability for each
hour. This measures whether sleep is maintained for
longer periods of time than wakefulness. For each
24-hour period, the entire period was scored in 4 s
epochs, resulting in 21,600 epochs per day.

Operant Apparatus

Sleep Deprivation

Programs for operant behavior testing and data collection were written using MED-PC IV (Med-Associates,
St. Albans, VT). Session events were recorded with 10millisecond resolution. Behavioral testing was conducted
in operant chambers (Med-Associates, Model ENV-007).
Each chamber contained a translucent pigeon key capable of emitting white light and a food hopper that,
when activated, emitted light and provided 5 seconds of
access to nyger seed. The key was situated in the center
of the panel with the food hopper located to the right of
the key. Each chamber was surrounded by a soundattenuating cubical with a built-in ventilating fan that
circulated air into the experimental environment and
provided masking noise. A fluorescent light with an
8-watt bulb, which remained on throughout the experiment, was located between the chamber and cubicle to
provide additional lighting. Internet cameras were also
mounted inside the chamber cubicles.

During each season, a 48-hour sleep deprivation was
conducted with all DRLs using the following procedure:
Members of the research staff entered the housing room
once every 3 - 5 minutes or sooner if behavioral signs of
sleep, such as eye-closings and inactivity, were prominent (viewed remotely with video cameras). Walking
quietly past the cages and occasionally tapping on them
provided sufficient stimulation to keep the birds awake;
handling was not necessary to induce wakefulness. The
sleep deprivation began at lights out on Monday, and
continued until lights out on Wednesday evening. DRL
sessions were run from Tuesday-Friday each week.
Therefore, the first two sessions for the week (Tuesday
and Wednesday) occurred under conditions of sleep
deprivation; the sessions conducted on Thursday and
Friday were considered recovery days. The week prior to
the sleep deprivation (Pre Sleep Deprivation) was used
as a baseline, and the week subsequent to the sleep
deprivation and recovery was used as a return to baseline (Post Recovery). For spring, summer and winter,
sleep deprivation was conducted 1 - 2 weeks after the
weeks used in the assessment of typical DRL performance for the season. However, during fall, the sleep
deprivation probe occurred 1 - 4 weeks after the weeks
selected to represent seasonal performance for 10 birds;
given; the heterogeneity of the fall migratory behavior,
birds used for the sleep deprivation and subsequent
DRL testing (post sleep deprivation recovery) in fall
were not in the migratory state. The photoperiods (and
weeks) during the four sleep deprivation periods were
10.25:13.75 LD for winter (second week of February),
17.25:6.75 LD for spring (second week of May),
20.25:3.75 LD for summer (third week of July), and
13.25:10.75 for fall (fourth week of September). Pre
Sleep Deprivation and Post Recovery data were averaged
across all 4 sessions of those weeks; Sleep Deprivation
and Recovery were averaged across the first 2 sessions
and last 2 sessions, respectively, of that week.

Operant testing

Food was removed from home cages for 3 hours preceding test sessions. This was done Monday through Friday,
although sessions were only conducted Tuesday through
Friday every week. Following training, operant testing
was conducted for 1 year. Sessions were held once
per day and each lasted 30 minutes. Each session
began with the darkened key turning white. A differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedule was in
effect throughout the entire session [11]. On the DRL
schedule used here, a response was reinforced when it
occurred more than 20 seconds after the previous
response. Qualifying key pecks immediately opened the
reinforcement hopper for 5 seconds; response rates per
minute were determined by subtracting out this 5 second reinforcement interval. Each key peck that occurred
after 20 seconds or more since the last key peck (DRL
20-sec) was reinforced with food. Qualifying key pecks
turned the key dark and simultaneously opened the
reinforcement hopper for 5 seconds, followed by the key
light turning white again; responses made prior to the
required 20 second pause had no effect on the key light
but did reset the DRL clock to zero to begin incrementing again. Responses during times when the key was
dark had no programmed consequences. The DRL schedule is alternatively referred as reinforcement of long
interresponse times (IRTs)[11].
Video was monitored to verify that birds were actually consuming the reinforcer when obtained. Training
for the procedure began in the fall for 5 birds, in the
spring for 2 birds, and in the summer for 8 birds. For
all birds, key pecking behavior came under reliable
control of the DRL schedule, as defined above, within
6 months.

Statistics

Based on selection criteria (see Activity monitoring and
Sleep-wakefulness scoring), seasons for SLPs were
defined as follows: winter 9.5:14.5 LD (first week of January), spring 14.75:9.25 LD (third week of April), summer 21.5:2.5 LD (first week of July), and fall ranging
from 13.75:10.25 to 16.0:8.0 LD (fifth week of August to
second week of October). These weeks included those
with the longest or shortest days (winter and summer),
and those with the most nocturnal activity in the home
cage (spring and fall). The main effects and interactions
of season, lights and migration status on vigilance state
were assessed by repeated measures (split plot)
ANOVA. All pairwise comparisons were assessed with a

Jones et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/87

familywise a = 0.05 via Tukey HSD following a significant independent ANOVA.
For DRLs, data from these same photoperiods were
used to characterize performance with exception of fall;
in this case, the week during which nocturnal homecage activity (see Activity monitoring) best represented
migratory restlessness was selected for each bird. Fall
weeks for DRLs fell within the range for SLPs specified
above.
For analyses of operant behavior, the primary dependent measures were (1) response rate, defined as the
ratio of the number of responses to the number of minutes the key light was on, (2) number of food reinforcers
obtained, and (3) the behavioral inhibition ratio (sometimes referred to as efficiency), defined as the ratio of
the number of reinforcers to the number of responses.
For the behavioral inhibition measure, a ratio of 0 represents complete disinhibition; the closer the ratio is to
1.0, the more pronounced the inhibition. On occasion,
birds did not respond during the session; for these sessions, the behavioral inhibition ratio, but not response
rate or reinforcers obtained, was dropped because the
resultant ratio of 1.0 was not representative of performance. Data were assessed across four consecutive seasons for each bird, starting with the first season of
reliable responding (see Operant testing). DRL data
were averaged across sessions for each season, producing a single value for each photoperiod before it
changed.
For analyses of DRL performance by migratory status,
data from the migratory seasons were averaged and
compared to non-migratory season averages. T-tests
were used in these analyses with the Type I error rate
set at 0.05; multiple comparisons were not made following these omnibus tests. For analyses of seasonal performance, a repeated measures ANOVA was performed
across all four seasons.” Behavioral changes within sessions were also assessed by dividing each session into
ten 3-minute bins and recording the number of
responses and reinforcers during each bin. Analyses of
trends were conducted following repeated measures
ANOVAs across the ten bins to determine linearity. For
each season of sleep deprivation, a repeated measures
ANOVA was performed across conditions of Pre Sleep
Deprivation (Baseline), Sleep Deprivation, Recovery, and
Post Recovery, followed by post-hoc t-test comparisons
with the error rate corrected via the FDR procedure.

Results
We characterized sleep and operant behavior across a
full year using species-location-specific exposure to a
changing photoperiod. In Figure 1, a double plotted
actogram shows activity for a representative bird over
the course of approximately 30 months, including 2005

Page 7 of 19

when the sleep data for this paper were collected.
Colored horizontal lines indicate the calendar weeks
from which experimental birds were selected. The changing duration of the photoperiod across seasons is indicated by the vertical yellow lines. Daytime activity is
shown within the yellow lines, and nighttime activity
outside these lines. During winter and summer, activity
is completely confined to the light period (area within
the yellow lines). In contrast, during spring and fall
migratory restlessness, activity extends into the nocturnal period.
Four behavioral states were reliably distinguished
based on visual inspection of the EEG and behavioral
analysis: wakefulness, drowsiness, SWS and REM sleep.
Although the placement of the EEG electrodes was constructed to detect interhemispheric EEG asymmetries,
no episodes of unihemispheric sleep were observed.
Given the relatively small differences in EEG activity
between wakefulness and SWS in the bird, visual scoring
of the EEG alone often results in a failure to detect all
but the most extreme examples of interhemispheric
asymmetries. Furthermore, despite use of several cameras, we could not observe eye closure state 100% of the
time, depending on the location of the bird in the cage.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that our failure to detect
such asymmetries could be due to technical limitations.
However, if any unihemispheric sleep occurred, its duration was likely minimal. Another possible explanation
for the absence of unihemispheric sleep in the present
study is that this behavior was not expressed because it
had no immediate adaptive value under our housing
conditions.
Table 1 shows average percentage (mean ± SEM) of
24-hour recording time spent in each behavioral state
across season (top), as well as the number of hours
birds spent in each vigilance state and the corresponding length of daylight (bottom). In the lower panel REM
has been added to SWS and labeled as “sleep”, since
REM sleep amounts were minimal throughout. Consistent with our previous findings, overall sleep time was
reduced in the two migratory periods combined (fall
and spring) when compared to the two non-migratory
periods combined (summer and winter) (p < 0.05,
Tukey HSD). However, sleep duration in winter and
summer are markedly influenced by the duration of the

results in sleep duration comparable to that observed in
both migratory periods. Figure 2 describes the time
course of sleep, wakefulness and drowsiness across the

largely confined to the dark and wakefulness is preferentially expressed in the light. However, sleep in nonmigratory summer is consistently initiated shortly before
lights-off, whereas in non-migratory winter, sleep is
initiated shortly after lights-off. In the two migratory
periods, however, the organizing effect of the light/dark
cycle on the distribution of sleep and wakefulness is no
longer as evident. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3A,
during the two migratory seasons, sleep is significantly
reduced in the dark period (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) and
significantly increased in the light (p < 0.05, Tukey
HSD) relative to sleep in the two non-migratory seasons.
Similarly, wakefulness is significantly increased in the
dark (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD), and significantly decreased
in the light (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) during the two
migratory seasons. Figure 3B highlights the change in
sleep-wakefulness expression from light to dark in the
non-migratory periods, and the relative lack of change
in the migratory periods. In the two non-migratory seasons, as expected, sleep is significantly more likely
to occur in the dark than it is to occur in the light
(p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) and wakefulness is significantly
more likely to occur in the light than the dark (P < 0.05,
Tukey HSD). In contrast, during the migratory seasons,
the percent of time spent in sleep or the percent of time

spent awake does not change as a function of lighting
condition. Waking behavior also differed qualitatively in
light vs. dark periods during migration, as previously
described [1]. Birds at night engaged in behaviors typical
of migratory restlessness (e.g., wing whirring and beak
up flight simulation); these behaviors did not occur during the daytime during migration or at any time during
the non-migratory days analyzed.
Figure 4 shows the relative stability of sleep (i.e., the
ratio of sleep bout length to waking bout length) and
demonstrates the extent to which the propensity of
sleep maintenance was, or was not, preferentially confined to a discrete period within the 24-hours in each
season. During the spring and fall migratory conditions,
there is no period in the day during which the mean
sleep bout duration exceeded the waking bout duration.
Furthermore, the relationship between the likelihood of
extending a sleep bout and the likelihood of extending a
wake bout was biphasic in the non-migratory seasons
and generally less organized during the migratory seasons. Note that the smoothed curves in Figure 4 do
obscure a brief rise in the relative stability of sleep at
about hour 20-21 in the spring and fall. In contrast, in
non-migratory winter and summer, there is a clear, consolidated period of sleep, defined as the time during
which the smoothed average sleep stability was greater
than 1.0. The duration of these periods is markedly different in each non-migratory season. Specifically, in
summer, the typical sleep period begins approximately
80 minutes before lights off and lasts for 5 hours. The
initiation of sleep before lights off in summer is likely a
consequence of the extremely short nocturnal period in
this season (2.5 hours). In winter, the sleep period
begins approximately 60 minutes after lights off and
continues for 11 hours. Daily sleep to wake transitions
by season (sleep-drowsy-wake transition treated as a single transition from sleep to wake) did not significantly
differ between any seasons or pair of seasons. Numbers
of awakenings averaged 271 (± 41) in winter, 205 (± 25)
in spring, 193 (± 24) in summer, and 388 (± 55) in fall.
Although fall showed the largest number of awakenings,
there was not a significant difference between fall and
any of the other seasons (nor between any other pair of
seasons) on this dimension. The order (fall, winter,
spring, summer) by number of awakenings does not
speak strongly to hypotheses about the effect of migratory state or season.
Operant Behavior

In DRL procedures, the extent to which an animal
makes a premature response, and consequently reduces
the number of rewards obtained, putatively reflects
impulsivity [11]. Figure 5 shows box plots for response
rate (the ratio of the number of responses to the

migratory seasons, however, average response rates are
significantly elevated (t(14) = 3.94, P = 0.001) relative to
the two non-migratory seasons. As a result, the behavioral inhibition ratio was significantly lower in the two
migratory seasons (t(14) = -6.61, P < 0.001) relative to
the two non-migratory seasons. Despite having previously learned to execute the 20 second delay, during
the migratory fall and spring this ability was impaired.

Figures 6, 7, 8 further characterize changes in operant
responding across seasons and more finely illustrate
how these changes contribute to the overall effect on
the DRL seen in Figure 5. Figure 6 contains a set of
cumulative, single-session records for an individual bird
across four seasons and illustrates the changes in
response patterns across the year. Although the individual bird represented in Figure 6 exhibited the most

during each season. The blue line represents a smoothed curve through these data. The time during which the smoothed value of the ratio of
sleep bout length to wake bout length exceeded 1.00 was used to define the “sleep consolidation index” for each season. In winter, hour 10 is
first hour in which the ratio exceeds 1 and this ratio falls below 1 at hour 21, resulting in a sleep period of 11 hours. In summer, the sleep
period begins at hour 18 and ends at hour 23. It is noteworthy that this sleep period begins prior to the onset of darkness. A similar
phenomenon can be observed in the sleep times plotted in Figure 2. There was no sleep consolidation during the migratory seasons, spring
and fall.

extreme seasonal changes in responding, response
records produced by other birds followed the same general seasonal pattern. The slope of the graph is an indicator of the rate of responding, with the pen resetting to
zero for each 100 responses emitted during the session.
The diagonal hash marks indicate when the reinforcers
were acquired. During the winter session, rates of
responding were low and 17 reinforcers were earned in
the 30 min session. The pattern is similar during the
summer session, although the response rate and number
of reinforcers were slightly higher. Both of these records
show steady, paced responding typical for the DRL schedule. During the spring session, however, response rate

was extremely high; there were more than 700 responses
emitted without a single reinforcer obtained in the
30-minute session. The fall session record is similar to
spring although the rate is about half that of spring,
with only 2 reinforcers obtained.
Figure 7 summarizes how the entire group of DRL
birds performed within the 30-minute sessions during
each season. Early session response rates are appropriately low during the non-migratory seasons of winter
and summer. In the two migratory periods, response
rates are higher. Regardless of season, responding
decreased following the first 3-minute epoch in the session, particularly during spring, summer and fall, and

Figure 8 shows the relative frequency distribution of
IRTs using a bin size of 2 seconds averaged across birds
in each season. The proportion of reinforced IRTs,
those which occur after the 20 second delay, is shown
to the right of the dashed line. In a DRL 20-s schedule,
the highest proportion of responses should ideally be in
IRT intervals > 20 s, whereas a high proportion of
responses in IRT intervals < 20 s indicates premature
responding. On average, the smallest proportion of reinforced IRTs occurred during spring, followed by fall,
then summer; the greatest proportion of reinforced IRTs
occurred in winter. IRT distributions for DRL schedules
were bimodal with the modes at the shortest (nonreinforced) and largest (reinforced) bins. Although the
temporal placement of the modes differs subtly in each
season, there was no definitive trend toward short duration IRTs in the two migratory seasons relative to the
non-migratory seasons.

this pattern of change did not differ throughout the
week. During winter, summer and fall, this decreasing
trend in response rate did not produce a concomitant
decrease in reinforcement. However, during spring, the
within session response decay actually led to a linear
increase (p < 0.05) in reinforcement across the session;
performance thus “improved” as response rates declined.
Despite the “improved” responding during the end of
each spring session, performance at the beginning of the
subsequent session returned to previous, early-session
levels.
Issues in premature responding on the DRL can be
further qualified by examining the inter-response time
intervals (IRTs) distribution, an analysis of the time

Figure 9 shows the effects of sleep deprivation on performance data by season. The expected migratory
increase in response rate is evident for spring but not
fall, consistent with the fact that the birds were no
longer actively migrating. Sleep-deprived birds tested on
the DRL in fall were selected from weeks that did not
include those that were used to assess general seasonal
performance on the DRL. Regardless of season, the
sleep deprivation manipulation affected response rate
across conditions (p < 0.05), as well as the number of
reinforcers obtained across conditions (p < 0.05). During
the sleep deprivation period, response rate was significantly lower relative to pre sleep deprivation baseline
during both winter and spring (post-hoc t, familywise
p < 0.05). In winter, this resulted in a significant reduction in the number of reinforcers obtained (post-hoc
t, familywise p < 0.05). However, in spring, the reduction in response rate produced a significant increase in
reinforcers (post-hoc t, familywise p < 0.05). As a result,
spring was the only season during which the sleep
deprivation experiment produced a significant effect on
the behavioral inhibition ratio (post-hoc t, familywise
p < 0.05): In this case, we observed a significant increase
in inhibition during the actual sleep deprivation relative
to baseline (post-hoc t, familywise p < 0.05). For all
dependent measures and seasons, recovery levels and
post recovery levels did not differ statistically from baseline or from each other.

Sparrows housed under 12:12 light/dark reduced sleep
during the migratory period by up to 60% relative to the

non-migratory period [1]. Here we have also observed a
reduction in the duration of total sleep when the two
migratory seasons are compared to two non-migratory
seasons; However, when considering season without
regard to migratory status, only sleep duration in winter
is significantly different from each of the other three
seasons. As in mammals and other avian species, the
changes in the daily duration of sleep are impacted by
the seasonal changes in day length [16-18]. In the nonmigratory winter season, the major sleep period was
confined to the 14.5 hour dark period and sleep consumed 36% of the 24 hour period. In summer, however,
when the nocturnal dark period was a mere 2.5 hours,
sleep occupied only 14% of the 24 hour period, an
amount comparable to that observed in each migratory
period. If the White-crowned Sparrow routinely alters
sleep duration across the calendar year, the amount of
sleep lost during the migratory period may not, in fact,
be physiologically significant.

The duration of sleep, in both birds and mammals,
varies considerably as a result of environmental
demands [19-22], and it is therefore difficult to define
an optimal sleep amount. It is possible, however, that
the duration of sleep observed here in the summer and
winter represent the maximum and minimum sleep
obtained in a day for the White-crowned Sparrow,
respectively. The amount of sleep observed here during
non-migratory winter on a photoperiod of 9.5:14.5 LD
(36.6 ± 2.2%) was quite similar to that observed in our
previous study during non-migratory late summer under
conditions of 12:12 LD (33.8 ± 3.7%). Thus despite the
fact that the dark period in our previous study was 2.5
hours longer than that used here, sleep duration was
essentially unchanged, suggesting that about 36% of the
24 hour period may represent maximal sleep duration
that these birds can achieve. In non-migratory summer,
sleep is initiated after ~19 hours of wakefulness, with a
considerable percentage of this sleep occurring during

the light period. The onset of sleep during the light period, a time when sleep is ecologically suboptimal, suggests that selective pressure for maintaining at least 5
hours of sleep in each 24 h is stronger than that for
competing behaviors.
Given that sleep duration in non-migratory summer is
nearly identical to that observed in each of the migratory periods, the most striking difference between
migratory and non-migratory sleep is the change from
discrete day-night temporal organization to almost complete temporal fragmentation, an effect which, at least in
the seasonal mammals, appears to be mediated by endogenous seasonal mechanisms rather than light duration
[23]. Non-migratory days were organized in a clear
biphasic fashion with maximal sleep occurring during
the dark and maximal wakefulness during the day. A
period of consolidated sleep occupying all of the dark

phase was identifiable for both winter and summer, with
92% and 85% of all sleep occurring during this time in
winter and summer, respectively. In contrast, during the
migratory seasons, sleep and wakefulness were no longer
temporally organized by the light-dark cycle. Although
sleep duration in summer and the two migratory periods
is comparable, whether this temporally fragmented sleep
is as restorative as the consolidated sleep observed in
summer is unclear. We were not able to reliably measure slow-wave activity (SWA), an EEG index of sleep
intensity, so could not determine if it was preserved
across seasons. It is conceivable, however, that migratory
birds are capable of maintaining SWA over the course
of a 24 hour day in those brief bouts of sleep and drowsiness which occur throughout the day. There is indeed
empirical support for the idea that sleep intensity can be
preserved in this manner [4,24,25]. In humans and many

other mammals optimal sleep often requires an
extended monophasic sleep period appropriately tuned
to the circadian cycle [26]. However, this does not
appear to be true across phylogeny or, rather, it may
not be the case when external stimuli, such as food
availability, temperature, or reproductive or migratory
pressures demand organismic flexibility [19-21,27].
We previously demonstrated that when trained on an
operant task used to assess learning and performance
[28], neither the percentage of errors on sequence
acquisition nor the ability to execute a previously
learned response changed as a function of migratory status [1]; however, we did observe significant increase in
operant responding rates during migration, an effect
which is in direct contrast to the decreased operant
responding associated with enforced sleep deprivation
[1,29]. Similarly, on the DRL-20s task used here, rates of
responding increased during the migratory period,
despite the fact that such increases proved maladaptive.
The average response rates on the DRL during the two
migratory seasons were two times higher than response

rates required to maximize reinforcement acquisition,
and significantly higher than those observed in nonmigratory winter and summer. Within individual DRL
sessions, the most notable differences were apparent in
the distribution of interresponse times (IRTs), indicating
that when migratory birds did mistakenly respond during an interval when a response was not appropriate,
they were much more likely to be near the beginning of
the ‘waiting’ interval. Although it could be argued that
the DRL is not an ecologically salient reinforcement
schedule for migratory birds because waiting around, at
least in the wild, is potentially maladaptive. However, in
a highly controlled experimental environment, one
might expect the behavior of these birds to come under
control of the task contingencies. This clearly occurred
during the winter and summer, but during the spring
and fall when birds were actively migrating, the ability
to execute this well-learned behavior was impaired.
The DRL is often used to measure aspects of impulsivity, a construct covering a wide range of behaviors
considered to be unduly risky or inappropriate to the

Deprivation. N = 15. Error bars represent half of the 95% CI.

Jones et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:87

context. In humans, exogenously induced sleep deprivation has been shown to increase real-world risk taking
behaviors [30-32], and to affect performance on laboratory tasks specifically designed to measure impulsivity
[33-36]. It appears unlikely however, that migratory
sleep loss plays a dominant role in migration-associated
impulsivity. In summer, although total sleep duration
was as short as that observed in the migratory seasons,
birds maintained the ability to perform optimally on the
DRL. Moreover, regardless of the degree of behavioral
inhibition observed in each season, exogenously
enforced sleep deprivation consistently had the effect of
reducing response rates. If decreased sleep were mediating the increased response rates, we would have
expected increased responding in summer or following
sleep deprivation. Since sleep deprivation and migratory
sleep loss have opposite effects on operant performance,
it appears that migratory sleep loss might represent a
change in sleep requirement, rather than a state of sleep
deprivation, per se. It is conceivable that the temporal
fragmentation of migratory sleep plays a role in the
migration-specific loss of behavioral inhibition. Although
sleep fragmentation and sleep restriction affect cognitive
function [37], the differential effects of each are difficult
to tease apart, and as such, a specific role for sleep fragmentation in impulsivity has not been characterized.
Whether an inability to inhibit pecking is related to a
general failure of inhibition, a distorted sense of time,
inattention to salient cues, decreased sleep, or some
other underlying mechanism is not entirely clear.
Although the neurobiological changes that underpin
migration are largely unexplored, it is interesting that
similar sleep abnormalities as well as impulsive behavior
are prominent features of several psychiatric disorders.
In fact, sleep reduction and increased impulsivity are
arguably the most relevant symptoms of bipolar mania
[38], and in many bipolar patients a seasonal presentation of symptoms is common [39-42]. It is possible that
uncovering the mechanisms involved in the disrupted
sleep and impulsive phenotype of the migratory bird has
the potential to provide insight into bipolar disorder and
perhaps other disorders associated with increased impulsivity and sleep disturbance, such as attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder [43].
Limitations

Although we observed dramatic changes in sleep
amounts and organization of sleep across seasons, sleep
patterns in captive birds may not reflect those of birds
in the wild. For example, sparrows in this study were
not able to engage in prolonged nocturnal flights during
the migratory season and instead spent their active time
at night hopping around their cages, whirring their
wings and/or trying to initiate flight. We could not

Page 17 of 19

determine, for example, if during nocturnal flight birds
might engage in compensatory behavior such as unihemspheric sleep [44-46], or whether sleep amounts
might be different in captivity due to physical restriction
and decreased environmental stimulation. For example,
the sloth sleeps many more hours when recorded in
captivity than in the wild [47]. Nevertheless, these data
demonstrate that sleep in the White-crowned Sparrow
is significantly affected by both duration of the photoperiod and migratory status, although the magnitude of
these effects may be different in captive birds vs. those
in their natural habitat.
It is possible that changes in body weight played a role
in the differences in DRL performance at different times
of the year. For the DRL birds, attempts were made to
minimize food restriction while still establishing food as
an effective reinforcer by removing food from home
cages 3 hours before operant sessions. As a result, body
weights fluctuated considerably in our birds. Changes in
body weight, however small, lead to changes in relative
food restriction, which are known to affect operant
behavior in birds [48]. However, given that migratory
birds have higher caloric needs during the migratory
seasons, it would seem that the food reinforcer would
have more value during the migratory period. We would
then expect to see improved performance as a function
of migration, but this was clearly not the case.

Conclusions
The amount of sleep required by the White-crowned
Sparrow appears to be highly dynamic and contingent
upon prevailing environmental conditions as well as
physiological (migratory) status of the birds. Here we
have observed marked changes in sleep duration as a
function of seasonal day length, with sleep duration in
summer occupying only 14% of the 24 hour day, a proportion comparable to that observed during both of the
two migratory seasons analyzed. The most striking difference between migratory and non-migratory season
sleep was therefore not related to the change in sleep
duration, but rather to the loss of temporal organization
of migratory sleep; during migratory periods, birds lost
their usual diurnal pattern of wakefulness and sleep.
Performance on a task used to assess behavioral inhibition was also notably changed as a function of migratory
status. Although birds effectively learned to execute a
delay period on the DRL-20s during the two non-migratory periods, they were not capable of sustaining this
behavior in either the fall or spring migratory periods.
Response rates were significantly elevated during migration, despite the fact that such behavior proved maladaptive. Since neither exogenously enforced sleep
deprivation, or the short sleep duration observed in
summer resulted in increased responding and impaired

behavioral inhibition on the DRL task used, it appears
that sleep loss is not mediating the impulsivity observed
during migration. The observed seasonal changes in
sleep patterns and behavior in the migratory sparrow
raise interesting questions regarding possible correlates
of these behaviors in other species, including humans.
