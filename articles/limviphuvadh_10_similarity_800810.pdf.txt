Abstract
Background: The LGI2 (leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 2) gene, a prime candidate for partial epilepsy with
pericentral spikes, belongs to a family encoding secreted, beta-propeller domain proteins with EPTP/EAR epilepsyassociated repeats. In another family member, LGI1 (leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1) mutations are responsible
for autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE). Because a few LGI1 disease mutations described in the
literature cause secretion failure, we experimentally analyzed the secretion efficiency and subcellular localization of
several LGI1 and LGI2 mutant proteins corresponding to observed non-synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (nsSNPs) affecting the signal peptide, the leucine-rich repeats and the EAR propeller.
Results: Mapping of disease-causing mutations in the EAR domain region onto a 3D-structure model shows that
many of these mutations co-localize at an evolutionary conserved surface region of the propeller. We find that
wild-type LGI2 is secreted to the extracellular medium in glycosylated form similarly to LGI1, whereas several
mutant proteins tested in this study are secretion-deficient and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Interestingly, mutations at structurally homologous positions in the EAR domain have the same effect on secretion
in LGI1 and LGI2.
Conclusions: This similarity of experimental mislocalization phenotypes for mutations at homologous positions of
LGI2 and the established epilepsy gene LGI1 suggests that both genes share a potentially common molecular
pathogenesis mechanism that might be the reason for genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of
epilepsy.

Background
The leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI/Epitempin)
protein consists of an N-terminal region which has a
putative signal peptide suggesting that the protein is
either secreted or membrane bound followed by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) which are flanked by cysteinerich repeats domains [1,2]. The C-terminal region has
seven EPTP repeats which form a seven bladed betapropeller structure [2,3]. The EPTP repeats were also
found in three paralogues of LGI1 (LGI2, LGI3 and
LGI4) as well as in two other genes (C21orf29/TNEP1

and GPR98/VLGR1) which constitute the EPTP superfamily [3,4].
LGI1 is the best studied gene of the LGI family and it
is responsible for causing autosomal dominant lateral
temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF), one type
of familial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was the first human
idiopathic epilepsy known to be caused by mutations in
a non-ion channel gene [5-7]. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the
brain sometimes signal abnormally. Several studies have
been carried out on LGI1 and had shown that point
mutations on this gene have caused defects in secretion
[8-10]. Also, clinical studies have shown that up to 50%
of patients with ADTLE have mutations in their LGI1
gene [11,12]. Using gene-history and expression

analyses, LGI2-4 have been suggested as candidate genes
for human disorders [13].
In our previous work, arguments based on protein
sequence analysis and patient-specific chromosomal deletions are provided for LGI2 as the prime candidate gene
for partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes (PEPS) [14].
Both PEPS and ADLTE are temporal lobe epilepsies and
LGI1 and LGI2 are closely related paralogues that share
the same functional domains. The overall aim of the
study is to investigate whether SNPs in LGI2 have similar
effects as in LGI1 by causing secretory defects, the
known pathogenic mechanism of several LGI1 mutations
[8-10]. Thus, we experimentally investigated both the
reported but yet functionally uncharacterized mutations
and SNPs in LGI1 and LGI2 genes, as well as a few additional mutations with theoretically derived functional
hypothesis. We observed a reproducible phenotype in
terms of lack of protein secretion (resulting in loss of
function) for both LGI1 and LGI2 if structurally homologous positions are mutated that are conserved throughout the LGI family and known to cause disease in LGI1.
Hence, we suggest that there is a similar underlying disease mechanism for LGI1 and LGI2 and we propose that
each of the LGI family members might be responsible for
phenotypically similar, mechanistically related but genotypically distinct forms of epilepsy.

Results
Mapping of non-synonymous SNPs and known disease
mutations

We searched for non-synonymous SNPs and known disease mutations of LGI1 and LGI2 in the literature
(PubMed) [10] and dbSNP [15] and mapped them to
the domain architectures of LGI1 and LGI2 (Figure 1).
In total, we found data for 16 missense mutations for
LGI1 that cause ADLTE and 4 non-synonymous SNPs
for LGI2 (without reported phenotype). Six of the LGI1
mutations (L232P, I298T, F318C, E383A, V432E and
S473L), as well as 3 out of the 4 SNPs in LGI2 (K347E,
R444Q and Q452R), were localized in the EAR propeller
region that presumably interacts with ADAM metalloproteases [16]. Moreover, one of the SNPs in LGI2
(I24T) is found in the N-terminal region comprising the
signal peptide. Therefore, we put an artificial mutation
LGI1 L26R [17] which is located in the signal peptide
region for additional study concurrently with LGI2
I24T. The remaining mutations in LGI1 are spread
throughout the N-terminal half that includes the leucine-rich repeats.
Analysis of severity of the mutations in the evolutionary
context

We investigated all SNPs and missense mutations of
LGI1 and LGI2 in the evolutionary context of the

Page 2 of 13

alignment of LGI family members by using SIFT [18]
and PolyPhen [19]. These programs predict the severity
of effects of a mutation depending on the degree of
amino acid conservation in the mutated position and
how different, in terms of physicochemical properties, a
mutated residue is compared to the repertoire of amino
acids naturally found in this position.
The summary of results of SIFT and PolyPhen are
shown in Table 1. For SIFT, all 16 missense mutations
of LGI1 gave a score lower than 0.05. This implies they
are predicted to be deleterious and affect protein functions. PolyPhen predicts that most of the missense
mutations are probably damaging (only the E123K and
I298T mutations are predicted to be only possibly
damaging). For the artificial mutation LGI1 L26R, SIFT
and PolyPhen results are predicted to be tolerated and
benign, respectively. Among the 4 non-synonymous
SNPs of LGI2, only K347E is predicted by SIFT to be
deleterious. I24T and R444Q have scores close to the
classification threshold (0.05). Similarly, only K347E is
predicted by PolyPhen to be possibly damaging, while
the other three are all predicted to be benign.
Unfortunately, none of the reported mutations in
LGI1 and LGI2 correspond to one and the same homologous position in the respective sequences. For later
experimental study, we include two more control mutations that are structurally homologous in LGI1 and
LGI2 and would map to a reported disease mutation in
LGI1 or a non-synonymous SNP in LGI2. These are
LGI2 V420E (corresponding to the known V432E disease mutation in LGI1) and LGI1 K353E (corresponding
to the nsSNP K347E in LGI2). The SIFT method predicts for both new mutations to be deleterious and, for
PolyPhen, LGI2 V420E is predicted to be probably
damaging while LGI1 K353E is predicted to have a less
severe effect and only be possibly damaging.
Effects of the artificial mutation LGI1 L26R and LGI2 SNP
I24T on signal peptide and cleavage site prediction

LGI1 L26R and LGI2 I24T, that are both predicted by
SIFT and PolyPhen to cause little damage, are actually
part of the N-terminal signal peptides that are required
to translocate the proteins to the ER and out of the cell.
Therefore, we analyzed if the mutations would possibly
alter the localization motif as predicted by SignalP [20].
For the wild-type of LGI2, the cleavage site is predicted between positions 22 and 23 (AAC-LI) while the
I24T SNP appears to still have a valid signal peptide but
with a predicted cleavage site shift (positions 28 and 29
between RSA-QV). For wild-type LGI1, the cleavage site
is predicted between positions 34 and 35 (TEG-KK). For
the artificial mutation LGI1 L26R, SignalP does not predict a signal peptide anymore (the maximum Y-score
decreases from 0.611 in the wild-type to 0.397).

Figure 1 Domain architectures of LGI2 and LGI1. We annotated four SNPs of LGI2, 16 ADLTE missense mutations found in LGI1 (and the
artificial LGI1 L26R) and two additional mutations (LGI1 K353E and LGI2 V420E) constructed in this study. Mutations are indicated as lollipops
(red for mutations experimentally tested in this study and grey otherwise).

As opposed to LGI2 I24T that is predicted to only have
a minor effect, LGI1 L26R is in the hydrophobic helical
segment of the signal peptide motif and exchange of a
hydrophobic leucine with a positively charged arginine
definitely alters the physicochemical properties of the
whole region. Consequently, the LGI1 L26R mutation is
hypothesized to alter efficiency of secretion. To clarify
these predictions, we measured the effect of these mutations on secretion from mammalian cells (see below).
Phylogenetic analysis of EAR domain containing protein
families

It should be emphasized that LGI proteins have considerable sequence identity and similarity. Their alignments
as well as the construction of phylogenetic tree are not
difficult. In terms of pairwise sequence identity, LGI1
and LGI2 are most similar to each other (54%), while
LGI4 would appear most distant to all other LGIs (47%
with LGI1, 39% with LGI2 and 40% with LGI3).
Figure 2A shows the phylogenetic relationship of all
known protein families containing EAR domains based
on the alignment of their EAR region and using WDR5,
a distantly related seven-bladed beta-propeller with
resolved crystal structure, as outgroup. Among LGI
family members, LGI1, LGI2 and LGI3 cluster as separate groups of paralogues that have split from each
other before the separation of fish and mammals,
whereas LGI4 that lacks obvious orthologues in fish
appears to have diverged from the LGI1 line at an

evolutionary later time point. LGI1 and LGI2 appear to
have two paralogues each in zebrafish due to an additional fish-specific duplication event. The families of
GPR98 and C21orf29 also cluster as separate subfamilies
that diverged from each other and from the LGIs before
the duplication events in the LGI family. In summary,
this analysis emphasizes the closeness of LGI family
members and suggests related functions.
Mutations in LGI2 and LGI1 propeller domain structure
models

Since many of the SNPs and mutations analyzed in this
study are located in the EAR domains of LGI1 and
LGI2 and this region is presumed to harbor the site for
interaction with ADAM metalloproteases [16], we constructed a 3 D structural model of this domain (Figure
2B, see Methods section for details). The evolutionary
conserved residues found in the alignment of LGI family
members were mapped to the surface of the model.
Obviously, there is a concentration of these residues at
one side of the propeller. Indeed, beta-propeller structures often function as protein interaction modules and
there are known examples where conserved sites are
limited to one “flat” side of the propeller and serve as
protein binding interface [21]. Hence, also the conservation pattern in our LGI2 model could be explained by
having a conserved protein interaction site at this side
of the propeller. This site is shared among the LGI
family members (Figure 2B) and might be responsible

for the interaction with ADAM metalloproteases or,
possibly, other functional critical proteins. In support of
this, it was shown recently that at least LGI1 and LGI4
share the same repertoire of ADAMs as binding partners [22]. Interestingly, many reported EAR domain
mutations of both LGI2 (K347E and R444Q) and LGI1
(F318C, V432E and S473L) are co-localized in the conserved surface patches and, hence, are hypothesized to
interfere with protein function by affecting the interaction site. For example, the K to E mutation at the position 347 of LGI2 alters the electrostatic potential of its
environment. Two other mutations in the propeller
domain of LGI2 (R444Q and Q452R) are not involved
in the putative binding interface and could be less
severe since they maintain polar physicochemical properties and they are pointing into the (polar) solvent.
Expression patterns of LGI family members

Given the shared domain architecture among the LGI
family and the conserved set of interaction partners (at
least for LGI1 and LGI4 [22]), LGI family members can

be assumed to have quite similar molecular functions.
However, since disease causing mutations in one LGI
cannot be compensated by the remaining unmutated
LGIs, it has been suggested that each LGI family member might execute its respective function in different
expression contexts [8,22]. In Table 2, we compile available expression data from multiple sources [23-26], and
confirm that LGI family members have tissue-specific
and only weakly overlapping expression patterns in different parts of the brain.
Effects of LGI1 and LGI2 mutations on protein secretion

All SNPs in LGI2 and several not yet experimentally
characterized mutations in LGI1 including the artificial
mutation were tested for their effect on secretion of
the protein. HEK293 cells were transfected with
C-terminal GFP tagged expression constructs of wildtype or mutant LGI1 and LGI2 proteins. HEK293 cells
without any expression construct were used as a control for transfection efficiency. The results are shown
in Figure 3.

with residues involved in SNPs of LGI2 (red colored) and mutations of ADLTE found in LGI1 (blue colored). B) Shows the conservation within the
whole LGI family mapped to the surface of the propeller domain (see Method section for details) in the same orientation as in a), while c) is
rotated by 180 degree to show the other side of the domain. Grey color means no conservation, while the other colors signify conservation of
physical properties, i.e., yellow: hydrophobic, green: uncharged polar, blue: positive charge, red: negative charge. Color intensity is proportional to
strength of conservation see Method section for more details).

LGI1 WT is being secreted strongly into the conditioned medium (extracellular space); yet, some is being
retained in the lysate. Only with long exposure time, the
artificial L26R mutant can still be detected in the conditioned medium, which means that LGI1 L26R is just
minimally secreted. The EAR domain mutation K353E
in LGI1 (as well as the mutation K347E in LGI2 at the
homologous sequence position) does not seem to have
any effect on the secretion of the protein as compared
to the other mutations of LGI1. In all other cases, the
LGI1 mutation constructs resulted in robust LGI1
expression in cell lysates indicating that the mutations
in LGI1 result in secretory defects. Also, the secreted
protein of LGI1 WT, LGI1 L26R and LGI1 K353E were
observed to be of higher molecular weight as compared

to those that are being retained in the lysate suggesting
posttranslational modifications of the former along the
secretion pathway (Figure 3A).
On the other hand, mutations in LGI2 (with the
exception of LGI2 V420E) did not show any change in
the secretion level when compared to that of the wildtype. The LGI2 protein was observed both in the conditioned media and cell lysate indicating that most
SNPs in LGI2 do not cause secretory defects. However,
LGI2 V420E was found to be retained in the lysate
similar to LGI1 V432E where the mutation is in the
homologous sequence position. Similarly, secreted proteins of LGI2 were observed to be of higher molecular
weight as compared to those being retained in the
lysate (Figure 3B).

Glycosylation of LGI proteins

The expected protein band size is about 92 kDa but the
actual band size is almost 100 kDa. The higher mass
observed might also be due to glycosylation or other
modifications of the protein [8]. To test this, we performed PNGase F treatment of LGI1 WT and LGI2
WT. Figure 4 shows that both isoforms undergo a substantial molecular weight shift when treated with
PNGase F, suggesting that both are indeed glycosylated.
Subcellular localisation of LGI1 and LGI2 mutant proteins

With microscopy, the subcellular localization of the
non-secreted mutant variants was studied. COS7 cells
were transfected with expression constructs for each
mutation including a C-terminal GFP-tag based on the
pEGFPN3 vector. COS7 cells with the empty vector
were used as controls. We found that LGI1 WT and
LGI1 K353E are localized predominantly in the Golgi
and partially in the ER. But the other mutants are more
predominant in the ER (Figure 5A).
As for LGI2 and its mutants, they show similar localization in both ER and Golgi with the exception of LGI2
V420E which is localized mainly in the ER (Figure 5B).
These observations are consistent with the secretory
western blot results as proteins that are secreted most
likely are translated and processed in the rough ER and
transported to the Golgi vesicles before they are being
secreted. As for proteins that have secretory defects,
they are most likely retained in the ER because they are
misfolded or otherwise not normally processed because
of their mutations.

Discussion
In this study, we report that LGI disease mutations alter
protein secretion and stability showing that the clinical
epilepsy phenotype likely arises from loss of protein
function. This is in agreement with LGI1 knockout mice
that showed lethal epileptic seizures [27,28]. While
experimental data for LGI1 is abundant, LGI2 has been
mostly neglected so far. This is the first report to show
effects of LGI2 SNPs in detail.

respectively, harvested 17-18 hours post transfection, lysed and

PNGFase. The gel shifts indicate glycosylation events.

Previous and this work show that molecular pathogenesis of several LGI1 mutations involves alteration of
secretion levels of LGI1 which causes the protein to be
retained in the cells and, thereby, abolishes its potential
to function in its normal signaling role in the extracellular space of the synaptic cleft [8,29]. We explored the
effect of secretion of several LGI1 and LGI2 mutations
and our data strongly suggest that mutations at sequentially and structurally homologous positions have the
same effect on secretion in LGI1 and LGI2.
Protein secretion via the standard secretion pathway
requires a functional signal peptide as targeting motif.
We found one signal peptide related SNP in LGI2 and
we studied the artificial mutation LGI1 L26R which is
also located in the signal peptide region. We demonstrated that LGI1 L26R is secreted to a much lesser
extent compared to wild-type LGI1. We show by
PNGase F treatment that, upon secretion, both LGI1
and LGI2 are glycosylated, which has not been shown
previously for LGI2.
Our study increases the total number of mutations in
LGI1 and LGI2 that were tested experimentally for
effects on secretion from previously 9 to 19. Interestingly, the computational classification of the mutations
by SIFT [18] and Polyphen [19] as tolerated or deleterious coincides with the observation of normal or lack of
secretion, respectively, in 16 out of 19 cases (see Table
1). The only obviously wrong prediction is associated
with the artificial L26R mutation in the signal peptide, a
non-globular segment. Tools like SIFT and Polyphen
have been developed for learning set of mutations in
globular 3 D structures and can provide a reasonably
correct estimate regarding disease effects if new mutations in globular regions of LGI family members need to
be tested.
However, when all but 1 SNP are outside of the signal
peptide motif, how can they influence secretion? SIFT
and Polyphen evaluated the alteration of amino acid
properties following the mutation at otherwise evolutionary conserved positions and its role for the intactness of the 3 D structure of globular domains. We
found a possible answer by experimentally investigating
the whereabouts of the non-secreted mutants in the cell
using a fluorescent label that allows us to visualize the
protein’s subcellular localization. We observe that proteins without secretion phenotype, including the wildtype, are predominantly found in the Golgi (before leaving the cell) while the mutants that are known to cause
disease (in the case of LGI1) cannot leave the cell and
are accumulated in the ER. This can be interpreted as
classical fate of misfolded proteins that are caught and
degraded by quality control mechanisms in the ER that
ensure that only properly folded proteins are allowed to
move further along the secretory pathway [30]. Our

GFP-fused protein (green) as indicated and treated with either an anti-PDI followed by alexa 546 (red) to stain the endoplasmic reticulum or TR
Ceramide to detect the Golgi apparatus and DAPI (blue) to stain the nuclei and then examined by laser fluorescence confocal microscopy. The

results are in agreement with previous studies for other
missense mutations of LGI1 that were also found to be
defective in secretion and to accumulate in the ER
[8-10,17].
Finally, in order to test our hypothesis that LGI2
could follow a similar disease mechanism as LGI1 we
introduced new mutations of selected residues that are
(A) part of the conserved EAR propeller because it is
presumably functionally important, (B) structurally
homologous in LGI1 and LGI2 and (C) tested as mutations in their respective proteins for secretion phenotypes. In particular, we introduced the same mutation
that caused secretion deficiency in LGI1 (V432E) to
LGI2 (V420E) and also observed lack of secretion of the
LGI2 mutant. Inversely, a mutation that did not alter
secretion in LGI2 (K347E) also did not affect LGI1
(K353E). These results finally corroborated the similarity
in mutational effects on secretion between LGI1 and
LGI2.

On the other hand, LGI2 K347E and LGI1 K353E are
predicted to be deleterious by both SIFT and PolyPhen,
apparently, because of the charge reversal but they did
not show any ER retention or secretion deficiency and,
thus, appear to fold properly. LGI2 K347E and LGI1
K353E are structurally homologous and located centrally
in an evolutionary conserved region on the surface of
the EAR propeller structure and it is unlikely that the
charge conservation is not important for function. If the
conserved surface patch at the one side of the EAR propeller is indeed the critical site for interactions (e.g.,
with ADAM metalloproteases), then it is likely that the
pathogenetic mechanism is related to an inhibition of
physiological interactions.
Recently, the pattern of expression of each LGI gene
was studied using digoxigenin-based in situ hybridization. LGI family members demonstrated distinct expression in different regions of the brain [5,29,31,32]. LGI1
is intensely expressed in intrahippocampal circuitry

Conclusions
We provide substantial arguments for LGI2 as candidate
for epilepsy phenotypes compatible with PEPS. Furthermore, we find similarity of experimental mislocalization
phenotypes for mutations at homologous positions of
LGI2 and the established epilepsy gene LGI1, suggesting
that both genes share a common molecular disease
mechanism causing genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of epilepsy.

published reports [3,4] were helpful to reliably identify
the sequence borders of each of the individual repeats.
Since the structure of the 7 EAR domains is predicted
as a seven-bladed beta propeller (1 EAR domain is one
blade), we added the human, rat and zebrafish orthologues of WDR5 which is the best predicted propeller
template with known structure (see following Methods
section). The sequences were aligned with MAFFT
v6.240 [34] using the L-INS-I algorithm. The multiple
alignment of the EAR propeller domains was rectified,
annotated and exported as Additional File 1, Figure S1
with Jalview version 2.3 [35]. NCBI accession numbers
of all used sequences are given in the resulting tree figure (Figure 2A). Species are abbreviated as follows: Hs ...
Homo sapiens, Rn ... Rattus norvegicus, Dr ... Danio
rerio and Cf ... Canis familiaris.
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [36,37]. The bootstrap consensus
tree inferred from 500 replicates [38] is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [38].
Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less
than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are
shown next to the branches [38]. The tree is drawn to
scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of
the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic
tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using
the Dayhoff matrix based method [39] and are in the
units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site.
All positions containing alignment gaps and missing
data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). There were a total of
382 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted in MEGA4 [37].

Methods

LGI1 and LGI2 propeller domain structure models

Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree of EAR
propeller domains

It has been suggested since the first reviews of the LGI
family that the C-terminus of these proteins would contain WD40-like repeats forming a beta-propeller [3,4].
State-of-the-art consensus structure prediction methods
[40] support this prediction. We find the crystal structure
of the beta propeller of WDR5 [PDB:2co0[41]] as highest
ranked template for a homology model of the LGI2 propeller domain using the 3D-jury consensus structure prediction server [42]. However, since the sequence identity
to this closest template with resolved crystal structure is
only roughly 12%, it is important to critically assess the
expected reliability of our structural model. To further
corroborate our template selection, we show that a direct
and significant link can also be established with a simple
PSI-BLAST search. Taking the human LGI2 C-terminal
domain [UniProt:Q8N0V4 216-545] as query in a PSIBLAST search (profile inclusion-value 0.001) against

consistent with the clinical temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome associated with mutations of LGI1 [5,29,32]. On
the contrary, the distribution of LGI2 and LGI4 expression is confined to the medial septum and nucleus reticularis thalami. Finally, the LGI3 gene exhibits a
widespread expression in different neuronal types [32].
These new results, as well as our collection of previous
expression data (Table 2) suggest that specialization of
the individual LGI subfamily members is achieved by
expression in different tissues or cell types. This also
explains why disease mutations in LGI1 are not rescued
by the other LGIs despite their high sequence similarity.
Experimental testing of cellular effects of mutations in
both LGI1 and LGI2 reported in this work results in an
effective doubling of experimentally characterized mutations in LGI proteins and, hence, generally advances our
understanding of molecular disease mechanisms of LGIrelated epilepsies. Following the line of evidence presented in this paper and collected from previous reports,
we arrive at the conclusion that LGI1 and LGI2 apparently share the cellular mechanism of causing genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of
epilepsy. The multiplicity of functionally redundant LGI
genes appears necessary due to the hardly overlapping
tissue-specific expression patterns.

For the multiple alignment of the LGI family, orthologues for each LGI subfamily were downloaded from
OMA [33] and aligned using MAFFT v6.240 [34] with
the L-INS-I algorithm. To display only a representative
and taxonomically diverse but balanced subsample, we
selected the human, rat and zebrafish orthologues,
except for LGI4 where the missing fish is replaced by
dog. Besides the LGI family, only 2 other distinct
human proteins contain characteristic EAR domains,
C21orf29 and GPR98. To create a multiple alignment of
all EAR propeller domains, we selected the respective
regions in the sequences from the LGI family (same as
used above) and added the EAR regions of C21orf29
and GPR98, from human, rat and zebrafish to maintain
the same taxonomic spread for each protein family. Two

UniRef90 (spiked with all non-identical sequences of
PDB structures) the WDR5 template structure is found
in round 4 with an E-value of 9e-11.
Secondly, the correctness of the sequence alignment is
critical. Therefore, our alignment to the template originates from the alignment of representative orthologues
of all 4 LGI families as well as other EAR repeat families
to WDR5 (see Method section above and Additional File
1, Figure S1) which was then used as input for MODELLER (v9.1) [43] to derive the models for LGI1 and LGI2
(selected from multiple models by the lowest DOPE
score). Next, the models were refined (e.g. loops) and
energy-minimized through a simulated annealing MD
simulation using the AMBER03 force field as implemented in Yasara [44]. All methods used here (from template selection to alignment, modeling and refinement),
performed favorably for their respective tasks in the
recent community wide experiment on the Critical
Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP8).
Conservation mapping

Orthologues for each LGI subfamily were downloaded
from OMA [33] and aligned using MAFFT v6.240 [34]
with the L-INS-I algorithm. This alignment was used to
calculate the conservation on individual positions using
the rate4site algorithm as implemented in the Consurf
webserver [45]. The conservation values were mapped
to the B-factor column of the PDB file of the structural
model (Consurf) and visualized in Yasara as follows:
First, the values for all positions are read and normalized. All positions with conservation of at least 90% of
the maximal value are classified as highly conserved
while those between 70% and 90% are moderately conserved and those below 70% of the maximal value are
classified as not conserved. As a difference to classical
Consurf and other conservation coloring approaches, we
incorporate the physical properties of the amino acids in
the color coding. Firstly, all residues that are not conserved are colored grey. Next, moderately and highly
conserved residues are colored according to physical
properties, i.e., yellow: hydrophobic, green: uncharged
polar, blue: positive charge, red: negative charge. The
difference between moderately and highly conserved
residues (see classification above) is that moderately
conserved residues have lower color intensity while
highly conserved residues are visualized with full colors.
The script for the above described conservation coloring
was developed by Joost van Durme, Sebastian MaurerStroh and Elmar Krieger and is available in the free
version of Yasara http://www.yasara.org.

SNPs/Mutation analysis

We collected SNP information for LGI2 from NCBI/
dbSNP BUILD 129. Four SNPs which cause missense
mutations (I24T, K347E, R444Q and Q452R) were
found in LGI2. I24T is located near the signal peptide
region while the other three SNPs are located in the
EAR domains. Besides, we also collected missense
mutations of LGI1 which result in ADLTE by reviewing published literature in PubMed. We found 16
known disease missense mutations (C42G, C42R,
C46R, A110 D, I122K, E123K, R136W, S145R, L154P,
C200R, L232P, I298T, F318C, E383A, V432E and
S473L) which are spread over the whole LGI1
sequence (recently reviewed in [10]). We have added
the artificial L26R mutation which is located in the signal peptide region of LGI1 for additional study concurrently with LGI2 I24T. Moreover, we constructed two
additional artificial mutations with theoretically derived
functional hypothesis, LGI1 K353E (corresponds to
LGI2 K347E) and LGI2 V420E (corresponds to LGI1
V432E), to test the effect of mutations between identical amino acids at structurally homologous positions in
both LGI1 and LGI2 for the wet-lab experiment (see
details below).
Signal cleavage site prediction

Since LGI2 I24T occurs near the signal peptide of LGI2,
we investigated whether this mutation has an influence
on prediction of the signal peptide and its cleavage site
by using the SignalP 3.0 webserver [20]. The first 70
amino acids of either wild-type or I24T LGI2 were used
as query sequence. The same procedure was used for
prediction of the effect of the artificial L26R mutation in
LGI1 which is also located in the respective signal peptide region.
SIFT and PolyPhen analysis

We investigated which mutations in LGI1 and LGI2
possibly affect function of the proteins by using two prediction methods, SIFT and PolyPhen. In the case of
SIFT [46], the LGI family alignment (described above in
the part “LGI1 and LGI2 propeller domain structure
models"; but using all orthologues rather than the taxonomic subselection) was used. For PolyPhen [19],
FASTA sequences of LGI1 and LGI2, respectively, were
used as query.
Expression analysis

Expression data for the 4 LGI genes were retrieved from
BioGPS [23], HPRD [24], Human Protein Atlas [25] and
SOURCE [26].

Selecting identical amino acids at structurally
homologous positions in both LGI1 and LGI2 for the
wet-lab experiment
Wet-lab experiments

Constructs LGI1 (NM_005097) ORF construct was purchased from Invitrogen while LGI2 (NM_018176) was
purchased from Origene. LGI1 was amplified using forward primer; 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTATGGAATCAGAAAGAAGCAAAAGG-3′ and reverse primer;
5′-CGCGTCGACTGCGCTTAAGTCAACTATGAC-3′
and cloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). LGI2 was amplified using forward primer; 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTATGGCG CTGCGGAGAGGCGGC-3′ and reverse
primer; 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCAAACTTAAGTCAACAATTATATG-3′ and cloned into pEGFP-N3. Point
mutations were introduced into LGI1 and LGI2 using the
XL Quikchange site directed mutagenesis kit and verified
by sequencing to ensure the integrity of the cloned ORFs.
We used all four SNPs of LGI2 and selected four mutations (each from signal peptide region, N-terminal LRR
(LRRNT), LRR and EAR), i.e. the artificial L26R (SP),
C42R (LRRNT), L154P (LRR) and V432E (EAR) of LGI1
for testing. Besides, we included two additional artificial
mutations with theoretically derived functional hypothesis, LGI1 K353E and LGI2 V420E.
Cell culture, transfection and media collection
HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modification of
Eagles’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and 1% PSG (penicillin/streptomycin/
glutamine) on 6 well plates and maintained at 37°C and
5% CO 2 . HEK293 cells were transiently transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 17-18
hours of transfection with LGI-GFP constructs in serum
free media, the media was collected and centrifuged to
pellet cell debris, and the conditioned medium were
concentrated using Vivaspin 2 (30000 MWCO PES).
Cells were lysed in 3× SDS loading buffer with DTT.
Conditioned medium and cell lysate samples were
equalized for total protein using the Wako kit.
Western blotting Equivalent volumes of conditioned
medium and cell lysates were loaded onto 8% SDSPAGE gels to resolve proteins. Then, proteins were
transferred onto PVDF membrane and blocked using 1%
nonfat dry milk for 1 hour to reduce non-specific binding and incubated 1 hour at room temperature with
Mouse anti-GFP (Roche) at 1:2500 dilution followed by
Goat anti mouse HRP at 1:5000 dilution for 1 hour at
room temperature. Immunoblots were developed using
ECL Plus (GE healthcare). One set of gel was stained
using Simplyblue™safe stain to show that all conditioned
media samples were loaded in equal proportions as were
the cell lysate samples.
PNGase F treatment HEK293 cells were grown on
10 cm plates and transfected with LGI1 WT and LGI2

WT constructs respectively. Conditioned medium and
lysate were collected. The conditioned medium was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 30kDa (Millipore) and
immunoprecipitated with GFP conjugated beads (Santa
Cruz). HEK293 cells were trypsinized and resuspended
in HUNT buffer (PBS and complete EDTA free protease
inhibitor cocktail tablet) before being subjected to freeze
thaw method. Cell lysates were spun down by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant
were incubated with GFP conjugated beads at 4°C for
1 hour. The beads were washed five times with HUNT
buffer. The immunoprecipitates were denatured using
denaturing buffer at 100°C for 10 minutes before being
digested by PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37°C
for 1 hour. The control (-) samples were subjected to
the same treatment with PNGase F being replaced with
water. The samples were resuspended in 3 × SDS loading buffer for SDS-PAGE.
Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis After 1718 hours of transfection with the LGI-GFP constructs
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), COS7 cells grown
on glass cover slips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
in PBS at room temperature. Slides were blocked at room
temperature for 1 hour with 5% BSA in 0.3% Triton X/
PBS and then immunostained with ER marker anti-PDI
(Affinity BioReagents) at 1:1000 dilution followed by
Goat anti Mouse Alexa 546 (1: 2000, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) at room temperature for an hour. Alternatively, COS7 cells were incubated with 10 μM Bodipy TR
Ceramide, Golgi marker in HESS/HEPES medium for 30
minutes at 4°C and incubated with fresh HESS/HEPES
for 30 minutes before fixing the cells. Images were captured with Zeiss LSM Meta Confocal upright microscopy
with a magnification of 63×.
