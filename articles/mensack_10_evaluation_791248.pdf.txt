Evaluation of diversity among common beans
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from two centers of
domestication using ‘omics’ technologies

Abstract
Background: Genetic diversity among wild accessions and cultivars of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) has
been characterized using plant morphology, seed protein allozymes, random amplified polymorphic DNA,
restriction fragment length polymorphisms, DNA sequence analysis, chloroplast DNA, and microsatellite markers.
Yet, little is known about whether these traits, which distinguish among genetically distinct types of common
bean, can be evaluated using omics technologies.
Results: Three ‘omics’ approaches: transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics were used to qualitatively
evaluate the diversity of common bean from two Centers of Domestication (COD). All three approaches were able
to classify common bean according to their COD using unsupervised analyses; these findings are consistent with
the hypothesis that differences exist in gene transcription, protein expression, and synthesis and metabolism of
small molecules among common bean cultivars representative of different COD. Metabolomic analyses of multiple
cultivars within two common bean gene pools revealed cultivar differences in small molecules that were of
sufficient magnitude to allow identification of unique cultivar fingerprints.
Conclusions: Given the high-throughput and low cost of each of these ‘omics’ platforms, significant opportunities
exist for their use in the rapid identification of traits of agronomic and nutritional importance as well as to
characterize genetic diversity.

Background
Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the oldest cultivated crops in the Americas and is the most
important grain legume for human consumption with
production more than double that of the second most
important grain legume, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)
[1]. Common bean was domesticated in the Americas
by indigenous people during pre-Colombian times.
Archeological data suggest that bean was independently
domesticated in different regions of the Americas
including, the Andean region of South America [2],
Argentina [3], and Mexico [4,5]. The oldest domesticated beans were found at archeological sites in each of
these regions between 4300 and 8000 B.P. [6,7] Changes
in bean plant phenotype as a result of domestication

include but are not limited to growth habit, seed size,
seed retention, and maturity[3,8]. However, the molecular events that underlie these differences in agronomic
traits have not been elucidated.
Original classification of common bean germplasm
was performed by Singh et al. [9] into two primary Centers of Domestication (COD); namely Middle American
from Central and North America and Andean from
South America. Primary CODs were further divided into
Races based on geographic origin and genetic lineage.
The Andean COD was subdivided into three Races:
Nueva Granada (Columbia), Peruvian (Peruvian highlands), and Chilean (northern Chile and Argentina). The
commercial market classes that represent Race Nueva
Granada in the USA, include light red kidney, dark red
kidney, white kidney, and cranberry beans. Andean
beans such as Calima, Azufrado, sugar bean, and other
mottled types are also widely grown in Africa and the
Caribbean. Beans from the Middle American COD were

domesticated in West-Central Mexico [10] and include
Durango (central highlands of Mexico), Jalisco (coastal
Mexico near the state of Jalisco), and Mesoamerican
(lowland tropical Central America) Races. Market
classes grown in the US that typify Race Durango
include pinto, great northern, small red, and pink bean.
Navy, small white, and black beans represent the Mesoamerica landrace. The organization of common bean into
COD and Races is depicted in Figure 1.
Current tools used to characterize genetic diversity
within common bean include plant morphology [11],
seed protein allozymes [11-14], random amplified
polymorphic DNA[15], restriction fragment length polymorphisms [16], DNA sequence analysis [17], chloroplast DNA [18], and microsatellite markers [19,20].
While effective for evaluating genetic diversity of parent
plants, these techniques are of limited use in breeding
programs focused on crop improvement. Methods that
can assess potential differences in biological function
among cultivars on a genome wide basis have become
available in high-throughput and low-cost formats.
These ‘omics’ platforms provide an unprecedented
opportunity to ultimately identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that account for traits of agronomic
and nutritional importance.
The research presented herein utilized three ‘omics’
platforms (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to determine whether beans from Middle American
and Andean COD differ in their patterns of gene transcription, protein expression, and/or small molecule synthesis and metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first
report that shows differences in gene transcription, protein
expression, and metabolite profiles between beans from
two COD using ‘omics’ techniques. Moreover the metabolomic approach was used to evaluate whether common
bean cultivars within the same gene pool, referred to as a
market class, differ in their profile of metabolites. These
proof-in-principle experiments herald significant opportunities for utilizing ‘omic’ technologies in the rapid identification of traits with agronomic and nutritional importance

that could serve to guide common bean breeding
programs.

Results
Three ‘omics’ platforms to distinguish common bean COD

Experiments were conducted to determine whether or
not the three ‘omics’ technology platforms (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) would be capable of distinguishing dry bean cultivars from each of
the two COD. The approach used was sequential; transcriptomics experiments were performed first, followed
by proteomics, and then metabolomics, with increasing
complexity of the experimental design as work progressed to each new platform. The white kidney bean
and navy bean market classes representing the Andean
and Middle American gene pools were selected as representative of the respective COD. Furthermore, both
market classes are commercially important, and had a
white pigmented seed coat thus limiting the likelihood
of identifying qualitative differences between COD that
were due solely to synthesis of different pigments.
Transcript profiling

Developing seeds from the Middle American COD navy
bean cultivar Norstar and the Andean COD white kidney bean cultivar Silver Cloud were evaluated for differential expression of transcripts. Initially an Affymetrix
soybean microarray was used for this purpose. However,
using the unmodified array, we found that the high
binding specificity of Affymetrix microarrays, resulted in
a hybridization efficiency of P. vulgaris cDNA onto the
soybean microarray (< 10%) that was too low for expression analysis. Although it has been recently reported
that the use of masking biased probes overcomes this
limitation [21], a spotted cDNA microarray for soybean
was selected as an alternative approach because of their
successful use in cross-species studies [22]. This cDNA
soybean microarray, available through the Keck Center
for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois, has been previously described [23].

observation that fewer genes were expressed at 3 wk old
compared to 2 wk old likely reflects the reduced metabolism in the developing seed as it approached physiological maturity.
Proteomic profiling

Figure 2 Transcriptomic analysis of navy bean and white
kidney bean derived from microarray analysis of gene
expression. Principle components analysis of navy (red) and white
kidney (blue) harvested 2 wk after plant flowering. Three biological
replicates of bean cDNA were hybridized to spotted soybean
microarrays.

Principal component (PC) analysis showed that navy
and white kidney gene expression profiles differed when
seeds were collected 2 wk after anthesis (Figure 2). The
clones represented on the microarray were previously
annotated as described by Vodkin et al. [23] and supplied with the microarray. Based upon that annotation,
330 clones were identified as differentially expressed
between white kidney and navy at 2 wk after anthesis.
The clones were selected by one-way ANOVA (p <
0.01) and a fold change cutoff in expression of 2.0. The
majority of these clones (309) were up-regulated in
white kidney bean and the remaining 21 were up-regulated in navy bean. Of these 330 differentially expressed
clones, 30 were up-regulated in white kidney by at least
5-fold change and only 1 clone was up-regulated in
navy by at least 5-fold change. The clones differentially
expressed by 5-fold change were annotated and displayed in Table 1. The majority of clones up-regulated
by 5-fold change in white kidney have a role in transcription, translation, and protein synthesis/modification
based on the annotations provided with the microarray.
Examples of up-regulated white kidney clones include:
ribosomal proteins and ubiquitin. The only clone upregulated in navy has homology to a ripening induced
protein in 3 wk old seeds, there were 13 clones that
were differentially expressed between the two beans by
greater than 2-fold change (Table 2). Three clones were
up-regulated in white kidney, 1 of which was annotated
as nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Ten clones were upregulated in navy bean, but only 4 were identified in the
annotation and are involved in metabolism. The

Based on the transcript profiling data reported in the
previous section, it was predicted that the profile of
expressed protein would differ between cultivars representative of COD. Protein expression was assessed
using a two-dimensional gel system instead of an LCMS platform, so that a visual picture of similarities
and differences in types and amounts of proteins
expressed between COD could be obtained. Moreover,
rather than limiting the analysis to one cultivar from
each market class-COD category, three cultivars from
each genepool were evaluated. The list of cultivars studied can be found in the Materials and Methods section. Master gels of the two dry bean germplasm
(white kidney and navy) were created for purposes of
exploratory analysis. Close visual inspection showed
distinct differences in both the absolute number of
proteins as well as differences in concentration (spot
density) between COD. With the false discovery rate
set at zero, 2186 spots were selected from the master
gel using the PDQuest software.
Data from the three cultivars evaluated were combined
and subjected to PC analysis (Figure 3a). A heat map of
spot densities showed visual differences in up- and downregulated proteins when comparing white kidney bean and
navy bean germplasm (Figure 3b). One-way ANOVA analysis showed that 733 proteins were statistically different
between the two COD (p < 0.05) with a fold change
greater than 2. Of the 773 proteins, 282 proteins were
up-regulated in white kidney bean and 254 proteins were
up-regulated in navy bean.
Metabolomic fingerprinting

While the results of proteomic analyses were consistent
with genetic differences between cultivars in each COD,
these findings do not address the nature of these differences. It can be argued that the majority of the proteins
detected participate in the synthesis, transformation, and
degradation of both primary and secondary metabolites
that play a role in plant architecture, reproduction, and
defense against biotic and abiotic stresses [24]. The
focus of the metabolomic analyses reported herein was
on the small molecules having a mass less than 1000
Daltons. Our objective was to determine if these small
molecule profiles differed between Andean and Middle
American beans. The same market classes and cultivars
evaluated in the proteomics experiments were metabolically fingerprinted. To perform unbiased metabolomic
analyses, m/z values from 50-1000 were monitored

respectively. Hierarchal clustering using Euclidian distances was used to distinguish among cultivars and
between COD. The resulting dendrogram shows clustering of cultivars within COD (Figure 5b) which mimics
clustering seen in the proteomics analysis. One-way
ANOVA analysis of the 6 cultivated varieties grouped by
market class showed 542 features were statistically different (p < 0.05) with a fold change of at least 2 between the
navy bean and white kidney market classes. The 542 features were further analyzed to determine which could differentiate cultivars within the market classes. In this case,
167 features were found to be statistically different (p <
0.05) within the white kidney bean cultivars; whereas, 246
features were found to be statistically different (p < 0.05)
between the three navy bean cultivars.

Discussion
The elucidation of molecular differences underlying
traits that permit the division of common bean germplasm into distinct centers of domestication has been
largely unexplored by high-throughput ‘omic’ technologies. A triad of ‘omic’ technologies: transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, were used herein to
determine whether differences in gene transcription,
protein expression, or synthesis/metabolism of small
molecules were of sufficient magnitude to distinguish
among bean cultivars within and between two COD
(Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2b, 3c, and 5a, distinct
differences were observed among cultivars and between
the two COD in all three ‘omics’ signatures.
The transcript profiling experiments revealed that
chronological age of the seed from anthesis has a significant impact on the number of differentially expressed

genes and the functions (gene ontology) associated with
those genes. However, examination of the gene lists in
Table 1 failed to provide a clear picture of the physiological distinctions between COD. One limitation to consider is that distinct P. vulgaris genes may exist without
a soybean homologue to utilize during hybridization and
thus a cross-species microarray may exclude unique dry
bean transcripts. Reciprocally, the chance of false positives was increased in the cross-species use of the
cDNA spotted arrays because of reduced hybridization
stringency. The drawbacks associated with using a soybean array for common bean transcriptomics stem from
reduced synteny between P. vulgaris and G. max. The
most recent common ancestor for P. vulgaris and G.
max was 19 Ma. At some time point following divergence, diploidization of the G. max genome occurred
making its chromosome number 2n = 80 compared to
2n = 40 of P. vulgaris [25]. Genomic rearrangement
including translocation or gene loss during diploidization of the soybean leads to reduced synteny between
the two species and must be considered when attempting to determine chromosome overlap between the soybean and the common bean for genetic mapping. The
use of the Affymetrix array platform as reported in Yang
et al. [21] may serve to overcome some of the noted
limitations, and it is worthwhile to note that the WholeGenome Sequence of Common Bean project and the
Ibero-American whole genome sequencing project
include both COD [26]. With the entire common bean
genome sequenced, a complete dry bean microarray can
be synthesized and annotated to advance the transcriptomics platform Challenges in gene list interpretation
also have been encountered using other organisms and

have led to the development of alternative approaches to
data analysis methods such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [27]. GSEA permits the investigator to use
existing knowledge to test specific hypotheses about differences in pathways and networks of gene expression
between two or more treatment conditions. Efforts to
incorporate GSEA for market class stratification were limited by cross-species hybridization and the lack of dry
bean and soybean gene lists. Consequently, no useful data
was gained. This situation underscores the importance of
current efforts to sequence the Phaseolus genome. When
that work is completed, it will be possible to generate
hypotheses for additional testing based on observations
about plant morphology [11] or seed protein allozymes
[11-13] that have been used to characterize genetic diversity within common bean. In addition, as work on metabolomic analyses continues and new compound libraries are
constructed, metabolomic data such as that shown in Figure 4 and 5 will identify specific small molecules that distinguish cultivars within each COD and within a market
class-COD grouping. That information will permit future
hypothesis generation about the biosynthetic pathways
that are induced or repressed to account for differences in
metabolite profiles. Since differences in small molecule
biosynthesis are likely to result not only from differences
in gene transcription but also arise from differences in the
translation of transcripts and post translational modifications of proteins, the potential contributions of proteomic
analyses such as those shown in Figure 3 are clear. For
future analyses, we recommend that an HPLC or UPLC
separation approach be employed rather than 2DGE to
interrogate the Phaseolus proteome because of the speed,
throughput, and relative cost of the LC-based platform.
As one considers quantitative differences among the
three ‘omics’ signatures that distinguished between the
Andean and Middle American COD, it is readily apparent that marked differences exist in the number of features that distinguish between COD when tallying results
across platforms. However we caution the reader that the
purpose of this experimental approach was primarily the
qualitative evaluation of distinguishing differences in
transcript, protein, and/or metabolite expression between
COD. While the next generation of experiments would
be well served to use seeds matched for physiological age
across all omics platforms, these initial experiments were
performed using available mature seed with the exception
of the initial work on transcript expression which
required embryos to be harvested in the field and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Many factors other than the biology of the system
could account, at least in part, for the numeric differences observed. For example, the use of the soy-array to
identify differentially expressed transcripts or the use of
only one of an almost endless number of assay

Each cell of the heat map represents one mass measurement and is
colored to represent normalized fold change. Mean intensities for
each mass were determined across all cultivars and intensities

indicate a decrease or increase in intensity with respect to the
calculated mean intensities.

conditions that have been developed for proteomic or
metabolomic analyses are likely to make the numeric
differences noted unreliable. Nonetheless, the magnitude
of the observed differences indicates the potential merit
of these approaches as a fertile source of information
for plant breeders.
Overall, the ‘omics’ chosen for a particular set of
experiments should depend on the question being asked.
While considerable information can be gleaned from
each ‘platform, the biological activity assessed is interactive, and accordingly, the greatest insights are likely to
emerge through the integration of complimentary data
sets. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are
just three of these [28].

Conclusions
We have shown that two genetically diverse dry bean
germplasm can be easily differentiated using a suite of
three ‘tools (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). Using this panel of techniques we have provided a

glimpse into a signature which can be used to determine
COD. Furthermore, known genetic distances among cultivars and between COD were validated using proteomics
and metabolomics. ‘Omic’ signatures unique to P. vulgaris
germplasm may be useful to assess complex traits or reactions to biotic and abiotic stress and to incorporate genetic
diversity in breeding efforts. This work compliments other
techniques currently employed by breeders to assess dry
bean genetic diversity. As signatures are further developed
in future work, they have the potential to guide those
engaged in crop improvement for selecting traits of agronomic and nutritional importance.

Methods
Bean Material

Navy bean (cv. Seahawk, cv. Norstar, and cv. Vista) and
white kidney bean (cv. Beluga, cv. Silver Cloud, and cv.

Mensack et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:686

Lassen) cultivars representative of the two market
classes were selected for this study to represent the
Middle American and Andean COD, respectively. Seeds
from each of the market classes used in this study were
obtained from field grown plants at the Colorado State
University Agricultural Research, Development and Education Center (ARDEC), Fort Collins, CO. The bean
seed used for analysis within each omics approach was
of the same physiological age but differed across omics
platforms. Seeds for transcriptomics analyses were collected from plants at two and three weeks after anthesis
(plant flowering), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C. Seeds for proteomics and metabolomics were harvested at full maturity and air dried and
stored at room temperature (RT, 22 ± 2°C) until use.
RNA isolation

RNA was extracted from navy and white kidney bean
seeds from field grown plants in 2007. Seeds were collected in the field and immediately frozen as described
above. Two cultivars, Silver Cloud (white kidney) and
Norstar (navy) were selected for spotted array gene
expression analysis. After storage, frozen seeds were
separated from pods and RNA was isolated according to
the TRIzol reagent protocol (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD). The RNA sample was purified with
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according
to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) instructions. RNA concentrations and purity were determined using an ND1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific
NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was evaluated by the Experion Bioanalyzer Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Microarray hybridization

Since a commercial Phaseolus vulgaris microarray was
not available, a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) array
was selected because it was the closest phylogenetic
relative among available arrays [29]. Although Glycine
max and Phaseolus vulgaris differ in chromosome number and genome size (the soybean genome is twice as
large as common dry bean), linkage mapping of DNA
markers found an average conserved block length of
13.9 cM between the two genomes indicating high conversation and preservation [29,30]. Twenty-five μg of
RNA was used to prepare complimentary DNA for
spotted 2-color microarray analysis. Complimentary
DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the Superscript III
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and hybridized to a
microarray developed for soybean [23] using the Genisphere Array 50 kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA). Briefly,
RNA (29.5 μL) was mixed with dye-appropriate RT primer (1.5 μL) and heated to 80°C for 10 min, and transferred to ice for 2 min. Superase-in RNase inhibitor (1

Page 8 of 11

μL) was added before 18 μL of reaction mix composed
of 5× Superscript III first strand buffer (10 μL), 10 mM
dNTP mix (2 μL), 0.1 M dithiotreitol (4 μL) and Superscript III enzyme (4 μL). After incubation at RT for 5
min, tubes were placed in an iQ iCycler (Bio-Rad) for 2
h at 50°C. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 M NaOH/
50 mM EDTA (7 μL) followed by incubation at 65°C for
10 min and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (10 μL).
cDNA from the navy and white kidney bean samples
were combined and purified using Geneclean Turbo kit
(Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). The purified cDNA was
stored at -20°C until use. Arrays were cross-linked by
exposure to 65 mJ of UV irradiation and blocked by
incubation in 250 mL prehybridization solution [5× SSC
(18% Sodium Chloride, 9% Sodium Citrate) buffer, 0.1%
SDS and 0.01% BSA solution] at 42°C for 1-2 h. The
arrays were dried by centrifugation at RT for 5 min and
placed into hybridization chambers and incubated at 42°
C for 15 min. Formamide-based buffer (2×, 50 μL) and
LNA dT blocker (2 μL) were added to the cDNA sample
and heated for 10 min at 80°C. A cover slip was placed
on the array and the cDNA mix was introduced between
the cover slip and the array surface. The solution was
distributed evenly on the array by capillary action.
Water (15 μL) was added to the wells of the array chambers followed by incubation for 16 h at 42°C. The array
was vigorously washed 3 times for 2 min, first with 2×
SSC and 0.2% SDS (250 mL) followed by 2× SSC (250
mL) and then with 0.2× SSC (250 mL). The arrays were
centrifuged for 3 min (1000 × g) to dry and warmed at
42°C for 15 min. A mix of 2× formamide-based buffer
(42 μL), water (35 μL) and 3.5 μL each of Cy3 and Cy5
was prepared in the dark and incubated at 80°C for 10
min. The hybridization mix was then injected onto the
soybean cDNA microarray. Arrays were incubated at
42°C for 3 h. After the second hybridization step, the
arrays were washed and dried as described above and
immediately scanned with a Genepix 4000B scanner
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Scanned images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0
software (Molecular Devices) where spot features were
aligned for annotation. Poorly hybridized spots were discarded from analysis using the software parameters and the
intensities of each dye were quantified. Fluorescence intensities were normalized and exported for statistical analyses.
Protein isolation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2DGE)

2DGE was performed with bean extracts according to
previously published methods [31]. Approximately 15 mg
of bean seed samples from each of the six cultivars listed
above were suspended in sample lysis buffer, containing
7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 40 mM DTT, 2% CHAPS, 1%
Pharmalyte pH 3-10 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ),

Mensack et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:686
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/686

and trace amount of bromophenol blue (BPB). Insoluble
debris was removed after centrifugation for 30 min
(1000 × g, 15°C). The supernatant was recovered and
used for analysis. Protein concentration was quantified
using the Bradford assay.
Bean seed protein (200 μg) was applied to reswelled,
immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (pH 4-7L, 24 cm;
GE Healthcare). The isoelectrofocusing conditions were
as follows: 10V to 300 V for 3 h and at 5000 V for a
total of 95 kVh at 20°C. After isoelectrofocusing, the
strips were equilibrated in a buffer containing 30% glycerol, 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 10 mg/mL dithiothreitol
(DTT) and 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for 15 min and
then for an additional 15 min in equilibration buffer in
which 42.5 mg/mL iodoacetamide replaced the DTT.
The strips were positioned at the top of 13-16% gradient
polyacrylamide gels with 0.5% agarose containing
Laemmli sample buffer [31]. SDS-PAGE was performed
in Laemmli electrophoresis buffer at 150 V at RT.
Proteins were stained with alkaline ammoniacal silver
staining [32] scanned with a GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using PDQuest v7.1.1
software (Bio-Rad).
Analysis of gels

Samples were analyzed using 2DGE to obtain quantitative protein profiles within the molecular weight range
of 25 to 150 kDa. Each bean cultivar was run in duplicate. Protein spots were automatically detected using
PDQuest v7.1.1 software. All spots were also manually
confirmed. Images of duplicate gels were superimposed
and a master gel generated for each of the six cultivars.
Proteins were quantified using spot densitometry.
Comparisons of the 2DGE protein patterns generated
an inclusion list for only those proteins that differed significantly between the two COD (greater than 2-fold
change). Protein patterns were also compared between
cultivars within each COD. Although out of the scope
of this work, these spots can be used in the future for
protein identification using MALDI TOF MS.
Metabolite extraction and analysis

It is imperative that the majority of the proteins within
the dry bean samples are removed prior to metabolomic
fingerprinting in order to avoid confounded results from
possible protein fragments. The dried bean seeds were
boiled to denature proteins and freeze dried for storage.
The proteins were then precipitated during the metabolite extraction process using cold ethanol. The boiling
procedure is as follows: 0.5 kg of bean was soaked in
distilled water for 3 h at RT. After 3 h the beans were
drained, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, and
blanched for 5 min at 93°C. Beans were boiled for
60 min in a 1.5% KCl solution using a pressure cooker.

Page 9 of 11

Finally, beans were freeze dried (Genesis SQ25LL, Virtis
Company, Gardiner, NY) to powder form and stored at
-80°C until use.
Metabolites were extracted using cold ethanol (65%,
-20°C). Approximately 2.5 g of freeze dried bean powder
was added to ethanol (65%, 50 mL) and vortexed to
ensure complete mixing. The mixture was sonicated at
RT for 2 h and centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min) to separate the insoluble material from the ethanol extract. The
extract was decanted into a clean conical tube and
stored at -20°C until analysis up to 1 mo.
Ultra Performance Liquid chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (UPLC-MS)

Sample separation was performed using an Acquity
UPLC under the control of MassLynx software (Waters,
Millford, MA, USA). The sample set was randomized
and held in an 8°C sample manager during the analysis.
For each chromatographic run, a 1 μL sample injection
was loaded to a 1.0 × 100 mm Waters Acquity UPLC
BEH C18 column with 1.7 μm particle size held at 40°C.
Separation was performed by reverse phase chromatography at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. The eluent consisted of water and methanol (Fisher, Optima® LC/MS
grade) supplemented with formic acid (Fluka, LC/MS
grade) in the following proportions: Solvent A = 95:5
water:methanol + 0.1% formic acid; Solvent B = 5:95
water:methanol + 0.1% formic acid. The separation
method is described as follows: 0.1 min hold at 100% A,
14.9 min linear gradient to 100% B, 5 min hold at 100%
B, 1 min linear gradient to 100% A, and 1 min hold at
100% A. A blank injection of water and 15 min chromatographic run was preformed between samples to eliminate possible carryover of analytes and to re-equilibrate
the column. This cleaning method is described as follows: 0.1 min hold at 100% A, 2.9 min linear gradient to
100% B, 1 min hold at 100% B, 3 min linear gradient to
100% A, and 8 min hold at 100% A for equilibration.
The flow rate for all steps was held at 0.15 ml/min.
Eluate was directed to a Q-TOF Micro quadrupole
orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer
controlled with MassLynx software (Waters/MicroMass,
Millford, MA, USA) using electrospray ionization in the
positive mode (ESI+). Mass data were collected between
50 and 1000 m/z at a rate of two scans per second with a
0.1 second interscan delay. The voltage and temperature
parameters were tuned for general profiling as follows:
capillary = 3000 V; sample cone = 30 V; extraction cone =
2.0 V; desolvation temperature = 300°C; and source temperature = 130°C. Mass spectral peaks were centered during acquisition producing centroid data. Leucine
Enkephalin was infused via an orthogonal ESI probe and
baffle system (LockMass) which allowed reference ions to
be detected for a single half-second scan every 10 s in an

Mensack et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:686
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/686

independent data collection channel. The standard mass
was averaged across 10 scans providing a continuous
reference for mass correction of analyte data.
Chromatographic and spectral LC-MS peaks were
detected, extracted, and aligned using MarkerLynx software (Waters, Millford, MA, USA). Chromatographic
peaks were detected between 0 and 18 min with a retention time error window of 0.1 min. Apex track peak
detection parameters were used, automatically detecting
peak width and baseline noise. No smoothing was
applied. To reduce the detection and inclusion of noise
as data, an intensity threshold value of 40 and a noise
elimination value of 6 were used. Mass spectral peaks
were detected between 50 and 1000 m/z with a mass
error window of 0.07 m/z. The de-isotoping function was
enabled to eliminate the inclusion of isotopic peaks.
A matrix of features as defined by retention time and
mass was generated, and the relative intensity of all features, as determined by area, was calculated for all individual samples. Potential effects of technical variability were
minimized by normalizing the intensity values to the total
ion current (TIC) such that the summation of all feature
intensities in each individual sample were equal.
Data analysis

For microarray analysis, data were imported into Partek
Discovery Suite software (Partek, St. Louis, MO), PC
and 1-way ANOVA (random effects) (p < 0.01) analyses
were performed. For 2DGE, PC, hierarchal clustering
based on Euclidian distances, and 1-way ANOVA (random effects) (p < 0.05) analyses were carried out using
Partek Discovery Suite software. Finally, the LC-MS feature matrix was mean centered and imported into
SIMCA-P+ software (Umetrics, Inc., Umeå, Sweeden).
PC analysis was performed using Pareto scaling. Hierarchal clustering based on Euclidian distance and 1-way
ANOVA (random effects) (p < 0.05) analyses were performed using Partek Discovery Suite software. Fold
change for both proteomics and metabolomics was calculated using Partek Discovery Suite.
