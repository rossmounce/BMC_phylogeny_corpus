Abstract
Background: Because the systems of social organisation in the various species of Pemphigus aphids
span the continuum from asociality through to advanced sociality (typified by the possession of
morphologically specialised soldiers), the genus is an ideal model clade in which to study the
influence of ecology on the origins of eusociality. We made detailed study of the ecology of three
gall-dwelling species that show clear differences in their levels of social behaviour. To elucidate
evolutionary relationships and to attempt to estimate the number of origins of sociality, we also
created a phylogeny based on sequences spanning the mitochondrial genes Cytochrome Oxidase I
and II for nine species of Pemphigus.
Results: P. spyrothecae, a highly social species with aggressive morphologically-specialised soldiers,
has the longest galling phase, unsynchronised development of a large number of individuals in a
densely-populated gall, and an extended period over which alates emerge. P. populi, a species with
no soldiers, has the shortest galling phase, synchronised development of a small number of
individuals in a sparsely-populated gall, and an extremely brief emergence period. The ecology of P.
bursarius, which has behavioural soldiers that are not morphologically specialised, is intermediate
between these two extremes. The galls of P. spyrothecae and P. bursarius form small openings during
the course of the season and predation-related mortality is relatively high in these two species.
Conversely, predation does not occur during the galling phase of P. populi, which has no soldiers
but makes an entirely-sealed gall.
The phylogeny allowed us to infer one likely point of origin of basic social defence and two
independent origins of enhanced defence. Based on current knowledge of behaviour, the phylogeny
also suggests that the defence trait may have been lost at least once.
Conclusion: The life-history strategy of P. spyrothecae appears to be geared towards defending the
colony against the constant threat of predation that faces the inhabitants of a long-lived, open gall.
The life-history strategy of P. populi, on the other hand, is to avoid predation in the closed gall
fortress and flee for the secondary host at the earliest opportunity. The life-history strategy of P.
bursarius appears to represent a compromise between these strategies.

Background
The transition from solitary to social living is one of the
key events in evolution: the rarity of this transition has
provided a classic problem for evolutionary biologists and
the unparalleled success of social animals is of central
interest to all ecologists. To investigate the factors underlying this transition, it must be studied in a phylogenetic
context and we therefore require clades of extant species
that have several independent origins and different
degrees of sociality. Such clades are exceptionally rare. For
many groups, the number of independent origins of
sociality is very small, these origins may be buried deep in
the past, and the phylogeny may not be known. Other
groups, for example bees and thrips, are more promising.
The social aphids provide particularly fruitful material
because there have been many independent origins of
sociality and there are clades of known phylogeny containing species covering the spectrum from solitary to
fully social organisation. There are estimated to be at least
17 independent origins of sociality in aphids (T. Fukatsu,
pers. comm. 2006) even though only 1% of aphid species
is social [1,2]. This dwarfs the equivalent estimates for
other social taxa (e.g. 1 origin in the ants [3], 1–4 origins
in the termites [4], fewer than 11 times in the wasps and
bees [5]). In addition, aphids have a genetic system –
clonality – that is virtually unique among social insects.
This reduces the complexity caused by genetic conflict that
is present in most social systems and allows us to concentrate on the role of ecological factors, which have probably driven the evolution of all animal societies [6].
The vast majority of aphid species simultaneously produce more than one morph, and the different morphs
routinely have different direct reproductive fitnesses. For
example, wingless morphs may produce more offspring
than winged morphs [7]. It is certainly true that such
reproductive sacrifice may constitute an altruistic act
which enables the altruist to contribute indirectly to the
fitness of its clonemates though behaviours such as migration. However, in line with the approach most commonly
taken, we exclude such altruism from our definition of

true aphid sociality, which we consider to have occurred
only when a species has acquired soldiers, morphs that
actively defend against predators. It is undoubtedly relevant that these soldiers are often the agents of socially
advanced behaviours other than defence, such as nest
cleaning [8,9], nest repair [10,11] and invasion and
exploitation of alien colonies [12].
Every species of social aphid forms and inhabits a plant
gall at some point in its life cycle [13]. The galls provide a
rich and indispensable resource to the aphids which are
therefore classic examples of "fortress defenders" [14].
The gall is especially important for serving as a physical
barrier to predators and to alien aphid invaders that seek
to exploit the altruism of the home clone, disrupting the
alignment of genetic interests among colony mates.
This study concerns the aphid genus Pemphigus which
contains species that exhibit almost the entire spectrum of
sociality from the total absence of defenders to the presence of aggressive, morphologically specialised soldiers
[15]. Pemphigus soldiers generally occur in the first instar
of the virginoparous morph on the primary host but
defensive behaviour also continues to a lesser degree in
later virginoparous instars [15]. It is clear that the gall is
particularly crucial to the social biology of Pemphigus
aphids because soldier morphs have been found only at
the galling stage [16]. We produce a partial phylogeny that
includes nine of the sixty-five species of Pemphigus that
have been described [2]. The species of the genus are
spread across the Northern Hemisphere and many have
cosmopolitan distributions [17]. Populus (poplar) is the
primary host on which the galls are formed [18] and host
alternation is the norm, but not the rule: three of the 17
species that have been sufficiently studied spend their
entire life cycle on poplar. Because the genus is entirely
without secondary-host soldiers, we can exclude the possibility that a second, dissimilar environment influences
social evolution and we can thus focus solely on the galling phase. The Pemphigus species that have been scrutinised for the presence of soldiers are presented in Table 1.

In this study, we have examined in detail the natural history and ecology of three species: Pemphigus populi, which
does not have soldiers; Pemphigus bursarius, which invests
moderately in gall defence using monomorphic nymphs
that behave as soldiers; and Pemphigus spyrothecae, which
invests extensively in morphologically specialised soldiers.
Within the genus Pemphigus there is known to be considerable variation in factors such as time spent on the primary host, the number of aphids within a gall, and the
number of emigrants produced during the galling phase
[18]. By examining these and other ecological, demographic and phenological differences (with special reference to measures of mortality, caste composition, and
timing of gall opening), our aim is to elucidate the key
selective factors that have influenced the evolution of
sociality in the galling aphids and other fortress-defending organisms.

Results
Ecology of P. populi
The average gall volume at the end of P. populi's galling
phase was 1099 ± 458 mm3. Larger galls tended to contain
greater aphid populations, increasing by approximately 1
aphid for every 70 mm3 of gall volume (R2 = 0.31, F1,19 =
8.62, P = 0.008). Correspondingly, larger galls also tended
to allow the emergence of increased numbers of alate fundatrigeniae (with the number of these emigrants estimated to increase by approximately 1 for every 50 mm3 of
gall volume, R2 = 0.21, F1,25 = 6.972, P = 0.014).

The index of developmental synchronisation in the gall of
P. populi was calculated for all the destructive samples
because the full range of instars was never in the gall at the
same time. There was no significant difference between
the resulting indices for each sample (F10,40 = 0.69, P =
0.72). The index calculated from the pooled samples indicated a high level of developmental synchronisation: on
average, 0.92 ± 0.02 of the individuals in a gall was
belonged within the same single instar.
The average number of fundatrigeniae in destructivelysampled galls was 42.9 ± 20.3. (The fundatrigeniae were
the only morph in the gall other than the foundress.) This
value accorded well with the average number of alate fundatrigeniae that left the monitored gall and were captured
in bags: 41.0 ± 21.2. The density of aphids in galls of P.
populi at the end of the season is therefore about 0.03
aphids mm-3.
The opening of the galls of P. populi is highly unusual.
Wide fissures open in the gall starting at its apex and often
extend so far that the gall's inner surface is turned entirely
outward. A closed and an open gall are depicted in Table

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/185

2. Alate fundatrigeniae (which comprised virtually the
entire aphid population) emerged immediately that the
galls opened. This emergence was synchronised: the fundatrigeniae of all the bagged galls emerged on the same
day, June 10 (see Figure 1A).
Immediately following emigration from the gall of the
fundatrigeniae (June 11), 42.0% of galls contained predators, 47.3% contained inquiline aphids, and 22.7% contained aphidopathogenic fungus. 87.3 % of the
monitored galls (131 out of 150) were thus affected by
phenomena that would have been fatal to aphids had they
continued to inhabit them. This extremely high rate of gall
mortality is shown in Figure 1C.
Ecology of P. bursarius
The average volume of P. bursarius galls at the time of peak
population (June 20) was 521.0 ± 45.7 mm3. Galls with
larger volumes again tended to contain larger numbers of
aphids, with the aphid population increasing by approximately 1 for every 9 mm3 increase in volume (R2 = 0.45,
F1,17 = 13.78, P < 0.001). The trend for a greater number
of alate fundatrigeniae to emerge from larger galls was not
significant (F1,28 = 3.39, P = 0.08).

As the average number of aphids in galls at peak population was 57.9 ± 10.9, the density of aphids in the galls of
P. bursarius was approximately 0.11 aphids mm-3. The
fourth-instar predominated at the time of peak population. The index value for synchronisation of aphid development was 0.67 ± 0.02. The galls were empty by July9,
approximately 2.5 months after they had been formed
(see Figure 2A).
The galls of P. bursarius were open for most of the galling
phase. Galls were closed for an initial 2–4 weeks but virtually all had opened by mid-June (Figure 1B). The
approximately circular openings measured 1–1.5 mm in
diameter. Emergence of alate fundatrigeniae began in
mid-June and had concluded by the end of July (Figure
1A). Peak emergence was in early July. The mean number
of fundatrigeniae emerging from each gall was 59.4 ± 8.8
for the entire season.
The rate of gall mortality was approximately constant over
the entire galling phase (Figure 1C). The increase in mortality in response to opening of the galls was not especially
pronounced because opening occurred very near to the
beginning of the galling phase when failures (unrelated to
predation) of the small founding populations were at
their highest.
Ecology of P. spyrothecae
The total number of resident aphids within a gall correlated positively with gall volume in all cases. For example,

data of P. populi and P. bursarius and regression curves are
plotted for the combined data for P. spyrothecae. The data
from the different field sites from which P. spyrothecae was
sampled (CW: Cement Works, LP: Leys Playing Field, PS:
Pembroke Sportsground, CF: Coton Footpath) are identified
by the unique triangular symbols indicated in the legend.

at Pembroke Sportsground for the galls collected over the
sampling period encompassing 14 August, 26 August and
8 September, 1999, the aphid population tended to be
larger by one for every 3.5 mm3 increase in gall volume
(R2 = 0.24, F1,131 = 40.36, P < 0.001). A positive correlation
with volume was also true for the number of sexuparae
emerging from the galls, which tended to increase by one
for every 5 mm3 increase in gall volume (pooled result for
all four sites: R2 = 0.33, F1,74 = 35.96, P < 0.001).
The aphid population peak occurred in mid-August. Pooling the two peak-population sampling events for every
site, the average number of aphids per gall is 222.5 ± 6.4.
The average gall volume at this time is 636.7 ± 13.4 mm3.
The peak density of aphids inside the gall is therefore
around 0.35 aphids mm-3. Soldiers and mature sexuparae
were particularly numerous at the time of population
peak and the peak in population co-incided with the
opening of the galls. Fluctuations in the numbers of both

showed that the first order interaction of day with site was
highly significant (F3,1504 = 27.76, P < 0.001), just as population differences among trees remained detectable after
having accounted for time-dependent and site-dependent
differences (F4,1504 = 13.92, P < 0.001). Again, the height

There was no relationship between the proportion of soldiers in a mature colony and colony population size at
any site. Similarly, there was no relationship between the
proportion of soldiers in a mature colony and gall size.
For P. spyrothecae, the index of developmental synchronisation was calculated at the time when all morphs were
well-represented in the gall (August). First-instar soldiers
predominated, making up 0.43 ± 0.01 of the gall. Death
of a colony's foundress usually occurred 2–4 months after
the gall's initiation. In mid-August (Day 90), approximately half of the galls contained a living foundress but
all foundresses were dead by mid September (Day120).
Adult sexuparae began to emerge from the galls immediately that the openings were formed (see Figures 1A and
1B). The elliptical openings ranged from 1–2 mm in
length (measured along the axis of the gall spiral) and 1–
1.5 mm in width. Emergence continued for a period of
almost three months. Peak emergence occurred in the
month of September at the middle of the emergence
period. The average number of sexuparae that emerged
from each gall over the course of the season is 128 ± 8.5.
Gall mortality (i.e. when all the aphids died) increased
markedly following the opening of the galls, with the rate
of gall mortality at least doubling in all cases (Figure 1C).
Phylogeny
All four phylogenetic techniques produced the same
topology which is given in Figure 3. Maximum likelihood
bootstrapping analysis gives this tree topology strong support. Bayesian analysis estimated the posterior probability
of this topology to be 0.82. The tree with the next greatest
posterior probability of 0.12 differed in just one respect:
the positions of P. populitransversus and P. populi were
exchanged.

in bold typeface. Eriosoma ulmi is the outgroup. A parenthetical "S" indicates that the species possesses soldiers and,
where underlined, highly aggressive soldiers with specialised
defensive morphology. The absence of soldiers is denoted by
a parenthetical "N". Arrow (A) indicates the likely origin of
soldiers, arrow (B) indicates the evolution of highly aggressive soldiers, and arrow (C) indicates the evolution of highly
aggressive soldiers along with loss of host-alternation and the
gain of dimorphic nymphs. The numbers on the branches give
the number of times out of 100 that a bootstrap replicate
recovered the branch, and the scale indicates units of 0.01
expected substitutions per nucleotide position.

Bayesian inference was also used to test support for monophyly of species known to possess soldiers. In the unconstrained analysis just described, if we assume that P.
trehernei and P. populitransversus both possess soldiers, the
cumulative posterior probability of a phylogeny containing a clade which is monophyletic for presence of soldiers
is 0.95. On the other hand, the same analysis estimates
that there is zero probability of a tree with soldier monophyly if we assume that neither P. trehernei nor P. populitransversus possesses soldiers. A second analysis which
constrained P. gairi, P. bursarius, P. obesinymphae, P. protospriae, and P. spyrothecae to be monophyletic was also
conducted. The difference in the harmonic means of the
likelihood values from each of the two analyses was used
to estimate the Bayes factor of 27.88. This value provides
strong evidence that the model with the constraint of a
five-species monophyletic soldier clade should not be

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:185

accepted over the unconstrained model [19]. However,
the difference resulting from comparison of the unconstrained model to a constrained model which adds P. trehernei as the sixth species of the monophyletic clade is less
marked, as indicated by the considerably weaker Bayes
factor of 12.48.

Discussion
Life-history and ecological traits
Detailed ecological investigation of the three study species
provided a clear demonstration of which factors are likely
to have had the predominant influence in producing
divergent defensive strategies through evolutionary optimisation of the aphids' life histories (Table 2).
Duration of the galling phase
The duration of the galling phase was approximately two
months in P. populi, approximately three months in P. bursarius, and between five and six months in P. spyrothecae.
P. populi is thus exposed to the selective environment of
the primary host for the shortest time, while P. spyrothecae
is exposed for the longest.
Aphid density
The lowest aphid density occurred in the galls of P. populi
and was up to four times greater in P. bursarius galls and
up to twelve times greater in P. spyrothecae galls. These
density figures also reflect interspecific differences in the
size of aphid populations supported in a gall. Whereas the
P. bursarius peak populations (57.9 ± 10.9) were only
slightly bigger than those of P. populi (42.9 ± 20.3), the
peak populations of P. spyrothecae were more than four
times the size (222.5 ± 6.4). Population size and density
are likely to relate to factors such as the duration of the
galling phase and the robustness of a colony following
negative influences such as predation. Population size
and density are also likely to have an integral influence on
gall hygiene. It was noted that detritus such as moulted
cuticle and waste such as wax-covered honeydew accumulated in the bottom of galls of P. populi. This was not the
case for galls of P. bursarius and P. spyrothecae, the inhabitants of which push detritus and waste out of the holes in
their galls [8,9].
Gall opening
The opening of the gall saw a rise in aphid mortality in all
three of the species. This opening releases a colony's
winged migrants, but it also compromises the integrity of
the gall as a physical boundary to predation [11] and, in
P. spyrothecae, is the reference point for the specialised spatial distributions of the various gall morphs [20]. The
potential risk of predation seems especially high for P.
populi, the species without soldiers. Although alate fundatrigeniae of this species departed from the gall immediately that it opened, almost 90% of the galls suffered from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/185

potentially disastrous incursions by predators, inquilines
and pathogens on the day of opening. Whereas the opening of galls of P. populi takes the form of extensive rupturing of the gall, opening in P. spyrothecae and P. bursarius is
a more subtle process which involves the formation of a
small hole (<2 mm in diameter) in the otherwise sealed
gall. The presence and size of these openings, is known to
be a crucial factor which the aphids closely regulate and,
if necessary, repair to minimise predation [11].
Alate emergence
Each of the three species had a unique time for emergence,
and there was little overlap among the emergence periods.
The emergence of P. populi occurs first, in early June, and
is followed by P. bursarius in June-July and finally by P.
spyrothecae in August-October. There is also a striking difference between the durations of the emergence periods.
P. populi emerge in a single pulse, with all the winged fundatrigeniae leaving their galls in virtually one day. The
fundatrigeniae of P. bursarius emerge over a period of up
to two months, while emergence of the sexuparae of P.
spyrothecae can continue for more than three months (Figure 1).
Synchronisation of development
The rapid emergence of P. populi in particular, but also of
P. bursarius, is facilitated by a high degree of developmental synchronisation. More than 90% of the aphids within
a gall of P. populi tended to be of the same instar and up
to 60% were of the same instar in galls of P. bursarius.
Being from host-alternating species, these instars were
soon destined to migrate from the gall. In contrast, firstinstar soldiers (none of which are destined to emerge)
comprised the greatest single morph in galls of P. spyrothecae. Despite being the most prevalent morph, the concurrent presence of a number of other morphs meant that
these soldiers accounted only for approximately 40% of
aphids.
Phylogenetic inferences
The three species that were subject to detailed ecological
study are spread across the partial phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 3. The likely origin for the evolution of
defensive behaviour is at the branch (point A) which gives
rise to the six uppermost species of the tree. Behavioural
defence is known for five of these six species, with P. trehernei representing the single exception. The loss of defensive behaviour on the P. trehernei branch must remain
putative until thorough investigation is made but, if confirmed, the loss is likely to be associated with a life-history
shift away from the primary host: the species has not been
found to form galls in natural conditions [21]. Although
the partial phylogeny suggests just one origin and one loss
of the basic defence trait, it also suggests that pronounced
defence through highly aggressive soldiers has evolved

twice, once in the case of P. obesinymphae and once in the
case of P. spyrothecae (points B and C on Figure 3). In the
latter species, this increased defence is likely to have been
supported by the evolution of dimorphism and the loss of
all secondary hosts. The phylogeny certainly supports the
hypothesis that P. spyrothecae evolved from a host-alternating ancestor [22].
Although detailed consideration of the evolution of gall
forms (beyond their defensive implications) is outside of
the scope of the current work, we note that the gall morphologies described by Blackman and Eastop [17] correspond well with the groups borne out in our molecular
phylogeny. There is evidence of phylogenetic conservation of gall morphology in the facts that P. gairi has an
elongate midrib gall, P. bursarius, P. obesinymphae and P.
populitransversus have round petiole galls, while spiral petiole galls occur only in the P. protospirae/P. spyrothecae subgroup which is therefore probably monophyletic. The
apparent phylogenetic conservation of gall morphology
may also indicate the likely position of several species that
are currently absent from our tree. For example, species
such as P. matsamurai have galls that, like those of the
study species P. microsetosus and P. populi, form on the leaf
and dehisce in a secondary position to the original opening. On the other hand, with the possible exception of P.
trehernei (which apparently has a unique biology and
forms galls only rarely), our phylogeny does not include
the various species of Pemphigus that form twig galls.
These species are likely to belong to a separate subgroup,
the position of which is yet to be elucidated. Intriguingly,
because this subgroup would include P. dorocola, a species
known to have soldiers [23], a second independent origin
of defensive behaviour would be required.
The species examined in our phylogeny represent merely
a small proportion of the large number of Pemphigus species and those of other related genera. Monoecy and
defence by soldiers is certainly known to occur in a
number of species that were not included in the current
research. Incorporating these species into future studies
will facilitate the expansion and, possibly, the amendment of the evolutionary relationships that we have
inferred. Broader phylogenetic knowledge combined with
improved behavioural and ecological knowledge will
undoubtedly provide answers to some of the most interesting questions regarding the relationship between the
selective environment and trends in social evolution.

Conclusion
Life-history strategies
Hide and run
P. populi has a short galling phase. The short time in the
gall means that the time exposed to the predators of the
primary host is reduced. Maintaining a completely sealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/185

gall further isolates the colony from external influences.
The build-up of waste is not a problem because colonies
are relatively small and sparsely populated. Because the
closed gall provides an extremely effective barrier to predation, soldiers are not required. The only time that the
colonies are susceptible to predation is during the emergence period. This period is kept extremely brief so that
predation is minimised. The pulse of emergence is facilitated by synchronising the development of the instars so
that all are mature alate fundatrigeniae at the time of gall
opening.
Stay and fight
P. spyrothecae has a long galling phase and a long emergence period. These extended periods can be sustained
because the species possesses morphologically specialised, aggressive soldiers that are able to defend their colonies against predation. The long time in the gall under the
protection of soldiers means that it is possible to increase
a colony's reproductive success by having multiple generations and staggered development during the galling
phase. The colony size is larger than those of the other
species and aphids of P. spyrothecae live at a high density
within their galls. The problem of the accumulation of
waste at such high densities is controlled by having an
opening to the gall by which the waste can be removed.
The opening of the gall is relatively small and can be effectively guarded by the soldiers. A sustainable trade-off
between preventing predators from entering and allowing
migrants and waste to leave is thus possible.
A mixed strategy
P. bursarius has a galling phase and emergence period of
moderate length. These periods of exposure can be borne
by having moderately aggressive behavioural, but not
morphological, soldiers. Galls have a small ostiole for
most of the galling period. As is the case for P. spyrothecae,
the presence of these ostioles can be supported because a
balance can be found between ejecting waste and detritus
from the gall and repelling predators with soldiers. The
moderately high density of aphids makes this waste
removal advantageous. Prolongation of the emergence
period is prevented because the development of the
immature aphids, which are all offspring of the foundress,
is largely synchronised.
Key correlates of sociality
A variety of factors likely to be significant in the evolution
of aphid soldiers have been identified. Increased defence
investment is correlated with increasing aphid density,
longer galling periods, longer periods of alate departure,
small gall openings, and decreasing developmental synchrony. It is certain that predation pressure, an understudied factor, will have the central role in the evolution of
defence. This assertion has been borne out, albeit in some-

what general terms, by the empirical (e.g. [11,24,25]) and
theoretical studies that have dealt with the issue to date
(e.g. [26-30]).
Another pivotal factor influencing the degree of defensive
specialisation is whether loss of host alternation or other
factors have influenced each species' innate predisposition for producing dimorphic offspring. Because dimorphism can facilitate the evolution of specialised
defenders, it may well also result in increased fitness. Particularly in the genus Pemphigus, the loss of host alternation is likely to be a key determinate of this predisposition
to dimorphism [22]. P. spyrothecae is the only study species that is not host-alternating and the loss of host alternation is likely to have increased the length of its galling
phase. Certainly, other species that are restricted to the
primary host, such as P. monophagus [31], also spend a relatively long period in the gall and have dimorphic first
instars.
We hope that, by way of example, the current study has
succeeded in exposing the excellent prospects that the
genus Pemphigus holds as a model clade that can advance
our understanding of the non-genetic influences upon the
continuum that is sociality.

Methods
Study species
Typical Pemphigus life cycle
The majority of Pemphigus species have host-alternating
life cycles in which periods spent on the woody primary
host (poplar trees; Populus nigra in all three species
described below) are succeeded by periods spent on herbaceous secondary host plants [17]. In spring, the founding female hatches from an egg which overwintered on
the bark of the primary host and this foundress initiates a
gall on the poplar leaf which is species-specific in its architecture. The foundress parthenogenetically produces the
gall generation of tens to hundreds of individuals which,
when mature, are specialised winged morphs (called fundatrigeniae/primary-host virginoparae) which migrate to
the secondary hosts. Upon reaching the secondary host,
the fundatrigeniae give rise (asexually) to wingless
morphs (called virginoparae) which may dwell on the
roots for a number of asexual generations before producing other winged migrant morphs (called sexuparae)
which return to the primary host where they give rise to
both male and female offspring. After mating, each female
produces a single overwintering egg.
Pemphigus populi Courchet, 1879
The life cycle of P. populi adheres closely to the typical life
cycle [32]. The monomorphic nymphs of P. populi exhibit
no defensive behaviour [15], just as no other social trait
has been found in this species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/185

Pemphigus bursarius (Linnaeus, 1758)
This species also has a life cycle that is broadly typical
[33,34]. However, the wingless secondary host females
may occasionally produce a unique winged morph that
can fly from one secondary host plant to another where it
may found a new colony directly. The usual survival
requirement of returning to primary host can thus be
bypassed entirely [35].

Although the fundatrigenious nymphs of P. bursarius are
monomorphic and without obvious morphologically specialised defenders, the first-instar individuals exhibit
defensive behaviour. They respond aggressively to the cue
of aphid haemolymph and actively attack potentially predacious syrphid larvae with their claws and stylets [15,16].
Pemphigus spyrothecae Passerini, 1856
The species has an atypical life cycle which is spent
entirely on the primary host. Inside the gall, the foundress
gives birth to a generation of aphids that are morphologically distinct soldiers in the first instar [36] but which nevertheless mature to wingless virginoparae that can
produce both winged sexuparae (that migrate from the
gall to the poplar bark) and more virginoparae [22,24].
The virginoparous offspring of the second and subsequent
galling generations are, once again, soldiers in their first
instar. The life cycle described by Foster and Northcott
[13] is correct except that we now know that these soldiers
produced by the first generation of virginoparae are only
facultatively sterile, and can mature to become reproducing virginoparae themselves if sufficient time remains
before the leaves of the host plant are shed.

The soldiers of P. spyrothecae are among the most aggressive in the genus [15]. They are heavily sclerotised, have
enlarged legs and are able to kill predators by puncturing
cuticle with their stylets and especially curved claws
[24,37]. The presence of soldiers is highly effective in
reducing predation on their colony [25].
Ecological sampling
Destructive sampling
Galls were harvested from heights between 1 and 15 m
above ground level. These galls were immediately placed
in separate sealed vials and taken to the laboratory within
6 h of collection. Each gall was measured to provide for
volume calculations and examined for the presence of
natural openings or external damage before it was broken
open. Aphids were removed from broken galls with a soft
brush and scored by instar and morph under a dissecting
microscope. An index used for all three species to measure
the synchronisation of development of aphids within
their galls was created by taking the average proportion of
the gall population represented by the predominant
morph/instar.

Non-destructive monitoring
Phenology of the gall
Randomly-selected galls between 1 and 15 m above
ground level were marked and numbered with brightlycoloured polyamide tape. At intervals specified below,
each gall was externally examined for damage and the
presence of natural openings. The dimensions of the gall
were taken with a Vernier calliper (accurate to 0.5 mm) to
track changes in volume. The apparent condition and
quantity of the aphids within the gall was also estimated.
Although the precise condition could only be obtained by
destructive sampling, it was possible to discern if the
aphids were dead or if the gall was empty.
Emergence of alates
The galls of a randomly-selected subset of those marked
for monitoring were bagged securely with the feet of sheer,
white, polyamide stockings. The alates that accumulated
in these bags were periodically transferred to sealed polyethylene bags to be counted in the laboratory.

Emergence of alates provides a direct measure of the
reproductive success of the galling phase of a clone. In P.
spyrothecae, each sexupara that emerges from the gall will,
if it survives, produce two males and between two and six
females, and can thus provide for up to 6 overwintering
eggs via which its genes can prevail [38]. In P. populi and
P. bursarius, each fundatrigenia that leaves the gall can
found an asexual secondary-host population [32,33].
Sampling of P. populi
Field site
P. populi was sampled from a field site (43°34'28" N,
3°49'40" E) in the village of Saint Jean de Védas, France.
This small area of parkland contained 30 black and Lombardy poplars.
Protocol
P. populi was sampled between 1 May and 30 June, 2000.
We destructively sampled 20 galls from up to 5 trees three
times during this period. 150 galls (75 galls on each of 2
trees) were monitored; and 50 of these (25 galls on each
tree) were bagged to gauge emergence of fundatrigeniae.
Sampling of P. bursarius
Field site
The site (52° 11' 2" N, 0° 10' 16" E) near Cambridge from
which P. bursarius was sampled is a small reserve dominated by a single large Lombardy poplar surrounded by
several smaller conspecifics.
Protocol
P. bursarius was sampled from 28 May-26 July, 2001 at 1–
2 week intervals. 30 galls were destructively sampled on
seven occasions (a total of 210 galls). 70 galls were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/185

marked for monitoring and 50 of these were bagged to
measure emergence of fundatrigeniae.
Sampling of P. spyrothecae
Field sites
P. spyrothecae was sampled at four field sites in the vicinity
of Cambridge, UK. The site 'Coton Footpath' (52° 12' 31"
N, 0° 4' 8" E) is a playing field and reserve that contained
10 mature Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra var. italica).
The site 'Cement Works' (52° 11' 49" N, 0° 9' 52" E) is an
area of parkland on which more than 50 mature Lombardy poplars grew close together. The 'Leys Playing Field'
(52° 11' 22" N, 0° 6' 58" E) is a sports field that contained
16 mature Lombardy poplars. 'Pembroke Sportsground'
(52° 11' 25" N, 0° 6' 5" E), also a sports field, contained
20 mature Lombardy poplars.
Protocol
P. spyrothecae was sampled between 11 May and 22 October, 1999. These dates were used to set the reference frame
for interspecific comparisons. Thus, May 11 is set as Day1
and October 22 is set as Day165 for all three species.
Destructive sampling and monitoring were conducted
simultaneously, at 2–3 week intervals. At each sampling
event, 50 galls were destructively sampled: 10 galls (5
from a height of 1 m and 5 from 10 m) were harvested
from each of 5 randomly-selected trees. As all the field
sites were sampled 9 times, 1800 galls were collected over
the entire field season. Fifty marked galls were monitored
galls on each of 2 trees at each field site from the beginning of the season until all the aphid colonies under
observation had died. Emergence of sexuparae was
recorded on a subset of 20 of the 50 monitored galls on
each tree. Thus 400 galls were monitored in total, 100
galls at each field site. 40 galls were bagged to measure
alate emergence at each site, giving 160 bagged galls
across all the sites.
Construction of phylogeny
DNA sequencing
Aphids from eight species of Pemphigus (P. bursarius, P.
gairi, P. obesinymphae, P. populi, P. populitransversus, P. protospirae, P. spyrothecae and P. trehernei) were collected and
preserved in 95% ethanol. Individual alate aphids were
freeze dried and genomic DNA was extracted using standard procedures. An area spanning part of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I and II genes was amplified
under standard PCR conditions using primers mt2793+
(5'ATACCTCGACGTTATTATTCAGA)
and
mt3660(5'CCACAAATTTCTGAACATTGACCA). These, and the
following internal primers were used in subsequent reamplification and sequencing: mt2993+ (5'CATTCATATTCAGAATTACC), mt3175+ (5'CATGAC/TCATACAATTTT
TATTAT) and mt3339- (5'GGA/GGATTTAATTTCATCTATT). The internal primers were developed by Stern [39]

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:185

for use in sequencing P. microsetosus and species from the
related aphid family Hormaphididae. Primer names indicate position relative to the Drosophila yakuba mitochondrial sequence [40].
PCR fragments were visualised by running out on a 2%
agarose gel, then purified by cutting the bands from the
gel and extracting the DNA by centrifugation followed by
a phenol/chloroform extraction. A fraction of each of the
resulting samples was re-amplified with internal primers
and ethanol precipitated to obtain DNA for sequencing.
Automated DNA sequencing was carried out using the ABI
Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase FS (Perkin-Elmer) and the ABI 310
genetic analyser (Perkin-Elmer). Results were analyzed
and sequences aligned by hand using Seqed v. 1.03
(Applied Biosystems), with further sequence editing in
preparation for phylogenetic analysis done using MacClade v. 3.05 [41]. The sequence of P. microsetosus, which
had previously been used in Stern's phylogenetic analysis
[39] was obtained from the author and also included in
the analysis.
766–845 b.p. were sequenced for each species. Length variation was included in subsequent analyses, with deletions considered as a "fifth base". Length variation
consisted of a single base deletion at base 223 in P. bursarius, P. obesinymphae, P. microsetosus and Eriosoma ulmi,
within the tRNA region. Where bases could not be
resolved accurately, the standard IUPAC codes for base
uncertainties were used. All ten sequences were submitted
to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ nucleotide databases
[EMBL:AM748711–AM748720].

for the rate matrix and branch lengths, uniform gamma
shape parameter, equal site-specific rates) and MarkovChain Monte Carlo parameters (four concurrent Markov
chains and two runs which, after full convergence, were
sampled every 100th generation).
All trees were rooted by comparison with the predefined
outgroup Eriosoma ulmi from the pemphigine tribe Eriosomatini.

Phylogenetic analysis
Four different techniques were used to estimate the phylogeny: (1) maximum parsimony was implemented with
the heuristic algorithm of the computer program PAUP v.
3.1.1 [42] using 10 random addition sequences and all
other options as default; (2) neighbour joining was performed using the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP v.
3.53 software suite [43] and maximum likelihood distances for the neighbour joining algorithm were calculated with the DNADIST program of PHYLIP with a
transition/transversion ratio of 0.72 and four categories of
substitution rate for the three codon positions (0.40, 0.16,
and 0.56) and the tRNA region (0.07); (3) the maximum
likelihood phylogeny was estimated with the program
fastDNAml v. 1.1 [44] using a global search starting from
the maximum parsimony tree and the transition/transversion ratio and categories of substitution rate used in the
neighbour joining analysis; and (4) Bayesian inference of
phylogeny was performed using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [45].
The transition/transversion ratio was fixed at 0.7 but otherwise default options were accepted for priors (flat priors
