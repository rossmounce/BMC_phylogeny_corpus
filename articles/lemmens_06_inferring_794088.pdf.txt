information

Traditionally, module identification methods dealt with each
of the different 'omics' data sources separately (for example,
solely based on microarrays [4]). However, simultaneous
analysis of distinct data sources has a major advantage over
their separate analysis: their integration allows gaining holistic insight into the network and a more refined definition of
transcriptional modules can be derived [5]. Therefore, the
more recent approaches for module inference combine several data sources.

interactions

Complex cellular behavior is mediated by the action of regulatory networks. The reconstruction of these networks is one
of the foremost challenges of current bioinformatics research
[1,2] and requires combining different high throughput
'omics' data. With the current accuracy and availability of
these high throughput data, the problem of network reconstruction remains highly underdetermined. The amount of
independent experimental data is not sufficient to unequivocally estimate all parameters of the models. Previous studies,
however, have unveiled that regulatory networks are modular
and hierarchically organized [3]. Inferring modules instead of
full networks drastically reduces the complexity of the inference problem and shows great promise for systems biology
research [4]. A transcriptional network is reduced to a module consisting of a regulatory program and a corresponding
set of co-expressed genes. The program, a set of regulators

'ReMoDiscovery' is an intuitive algorithm to correlate regulatory programs with regulators and
corresponding motifs to a set of co-expressed genes. It exploits in a concurrent way three
independent data sources: ChIP-chip data, motif information and gene expression profiles. When
compared to published module discovery algorithms, ReMoDiscovery is fast and easily tunable. We
evaluated our method on yeast data, where it was shown to generate biologically meaningful
findings and allowed the prediction of potential novel roles of transcriptional regulators.

was extended by Xu et al. [8] to incorporate ChIP-chip data.
Tanay et al. [3] developed an advanced graph bicluster algorithm to simultaneously integrate expression data, ChIPchip, protein interaction and phenotypic data. Bar-Joseph et
al. [9] developed a procedure that learns modules from
microarray and ChIP-chip data using a sequential analysis of
the data. In a first step, the ChIP-chip data is used to find a set
of genes whose upstream regions are likely to bind a common
set of transcriptional regulators. In a second step, the microarray data is used to find a subset of this gene set, containing
only those genes whose expression profiles are similar to each
other. Finally, the resulting core set is expanded with additional genes that have a small combined p value for the same
set of regulators in the ChIP-chip data.
In this paper, we present an alternative approach for module
discovery based on heterogeneous data. It is different in spirit
from previously suggested methods in that our algorithm
takes distinct data sources related to transcriptional regulation, that is, microarray, ChIP-chip and motif data, into
account in a concurrent (non-iterative or sequential) way. In
contrast to previous methods, where motifs are mainly
defined in a downstream analysis step, we use motif data as
an independent information source. We demonstrate the performance of our method on well characterized yeast datasets.

Results

We aim at identifying transcriptional modules by searching
microarray data for target genes with a common expression
profile that also share the same regulatory program, based on
evidence from ChIP-chip and motif data. Module detection by
'ReMoDiscovery' consists of two steps. In a first seed discovery step, stringent seed modules are identified (Figure 1). This
seed discovery problem translates into finding gene sets (row
dimension in Figure 1) that are co-expressed in microarray
data (matrix M), that bind the same regulators (share the
same columns in the ChIP-chip matrix) and that have the
same motifs in their intergenic region (same columns in the
motif matrix (Figure 1)). In a second seed extension step, the
gene content of the module is extended using less stringent
criteria. In the following, we discuss the specifics of this twostep procedure.

Seed discovery step
In the seed discovery step, we detect large modules with
tightly co-expressed genes (pairwise correlation of at least te),
directed by a common regulatory program with a minimum
number of regulators (sc) and a minimum number of conserved motifs (sm) in the upstream region of the genes
included in the module. Modules that meet these userdefined stringent criteria are defined as valid seed modules.
We solely report 'maximal modules', defined as valid seed
modules that become invalid upon extending them with any
gene they do not yet contain.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R37

An exhaustive search for all valid gene sets is not feasible, as
the number of possible sets is exponential in the number of
genes. However, by defining the constraints in such a way that
extensions of an invalid module are never valid (that is, as
hereditary constraints), we can adopt a fast Apriori-like algorithm to solve the problem [10] (see Materials and methods
for details).
To determine the statistical significance of the obtained modules, we assigned a 'seed module' p value to each seed module
(see Materials and methods). As expected, seeds with a high
number of genes were highly significant. Modules with one
gene were only significant if they contained many regulators.
To test the sensitivity of the seed discovery step with respect
to the parameters, we compared results obtained at different
parameter settings using a normalized Jaccard similarity
score. The overall similarity in gene and regulator content
was examined separately. We varied the correlation threshold
on the expression profiles, the threshold on the ChIP-chip
data tc (required to convert the ChIP-chip data to a binary
matrix; see Materials and methods) and the minimum
number of regulators sc. Parameter settings that are more
similar generally resulted in more similar gene and regulator
module content. This consistency (monotonicity) eases
parameter tuning. Numerical results of the sensitivity analysis can be found on our supplementary ReMoDiscovery website [11].

Seed extension step
The stringent criteria for the valid modules in the seed discovery step appear sufficient to reliably detect regulators and
motifs, but the reported maximal gene content of such modules is likely to be underestimated in size. For this reason,
ReMoDiscovery contains a second module extension step, in
which the gene content of statistically significant seed modules is extended. This extension is performed by computing
the module's mean expression profile, and ranking the
remainder of the genes in the dataset according to their correlation with this seed profile. The genes at the top of the
ranking will most likely belong to the module. However, it is
not clear where to choose the cutoff on the correlation with
the seed profile that is minimally required for additional
genes to belong to the module. Therefore, 'module enrichment' p values are computed according to the enrichment of
all regulators (motifs) in the extended modules as a function
of the correlation cutoff. If motifs and regulators identified in
the seed discovery step appear to be over-represented in the
extended sets, the correlation resulting in the largest enrichment is considered optimal (Figure 1).

Application to biological datasets
We applied the algorithm described above to two well
described yeast datasets: the Spellman dataset (assessing
gene expression during cell cycle) [12] and the Gasch dataset
(assessing gene expression in stress related conditions) [13].

Overview of the seed modules identified in the Spellman dataset [12]
Overview of the seed modules identified in the Spellman dataset [12]. For visualization purposes, seed modules with similar function are combined
(indicated in green). A regulator or motif that is part of a regulatory program of an extended module is indicated in the figure by a bold edge from the
regulator or motif to its module.

Using the seed discovery step, we detected 20 seed modules
for the Spellman dataset [12] and 104 seed modules for the
Gasch dataset [13]. Detailed results can be found in Additional data files 1 and 2. Seed modules were all statistically
significant when using a cutoff of 0.05 for the seed module p
value. Significant seed modules that only contained one gene
were omitted. To assess the biological relevance of the seed
discovery step we compared our results with literature knowledge. We consider a seed module as verified if all of its regulators could be linked to the same biological process by the
literature. For the Spellman dataset [12] 15 out of 20, and for
the Gasch dataset [13] 53 out of 104 seed modules were supported by the literature. The seed modules for the Spellman
dataset [12] are displayed in Figure 2, and those for the Gasch
dataset [13] are presented in Additional data file 3. Part of the
seed modules (18 out of 20 for the Spellman dataset [12]; 63
out of 104 for the Gasch dataset [13]) could be extended by the
second step of the algorithm. The extended modules are

described in detail in Additional data files 4 and 5 and all of
their regulatory programs were found to be supported by the
literature.
In some cases, seed modules could not be extended, that is, no
additional correlated genes appeared to be present in the
dataset under study. This implies either that the true module
size was extremely small (only a few genes belong to the module) or that the module's regulatory program, although being
biologically relevant, was not active in the conditions tested in
the expression data. Indeed, the identification of the regulatory program in the seed discovery step is to a large extent
determined by the ChIP-chip and motif data. However, motif
data are condition independent. Sharing a motif thus does not
necessarily imply co-expression in the tested microarray conditions. Similarly, because of the discrepancies in experimental conditions between available ChIP-chip and expression
data, evidence from the ChIP-chip data does not

biological process.

Nutrient deprivation

active in the Gasch dataset [13]. The regulators include Gat1,
Dal81, Dal82, and Gln3, which are all involved in nitrogen
catabolite repression [21,44,45], Gcn4, which is the main regulator in general amino acid control [46-48], Rtg3, which is a
transcription factor involved in regulation of genes required
for de novo biosynthesis of glutamine and glutamate [49],

Both the Spellman [12] and the Gasch [13] dataset revealed
active modules controlling so-called GAL genes (for example,

interactions

Modules involved in galactose metabolism

Nine modules involved in cell cycle control were found to be
active in the Spellman dataset [12]. The transcriptional regulators connected to these cell cycle related modules include
components such as Swi4, Swi6, Mbp1 and Stb1, constituting
the transcriptional complexes SBF and MBF, which operate
during progression from G1 to S phase [29,30], as well as
components involved in G2/M-specific transcription, such as
Fkh1, Fkh2 and Ndd1 [31-33]. Further support for our analysis comes from the observation that other factors with a role
in cell cycle regulation were also retrieved. These include the
transcriptional repressor Xbp1, the corepressors Hir1, Hir2
and Hir3, and the transcription factors Pho2, Reb1 and Rcs1.
Xbp1 is a repressor sharing homology with Swi4 and Mbp1
[34]. Pho2 is involved with the early G1 transcription factor
Swi5 in the control of the HO gene [35]. Hir1, Hir2 and Hir3
are involved in cell cycle regulated transcription of histone
genes [36,37]. The transcription factor Reb1 is known to bind
with high affinity to a sequence upstream of CLB2 [38], a gene
whose regulation is important for completion of the normal
vegetative cell cycle. The regulator Rcs1 is involved in timing
the budding event of the cell cycle [39]. Additional factors
identified are Ash1, Sok2, Ste12 and Tec1. Their presence in
our modules might link cell cycle to processes discussed
below, like mating type switching [40] and the filamentous
growth pathway (see also filamentous growth module) [4143].

refereed research

To our knowledge, no data are available that may confirm a
direct involvement of the other transcription factors in ribosomal gene expression. Nevertheless, the processes in which
these factors are known to be involved can be linked to ribosome biogenesis. For instance, Arg80, Dal81 and Pho2/Bas2
all function in the sensing and metabolic control of essential
nutrients such as amino acids and phosphate, and it is well
established that ribosomal protein gene expression is directly
related to availability of essential nutrients [14,18-21].
Another example is the transcriptional regulator Gat3, an
uncharacterized member of the GATA family of transcription
factors that controls the expression of nitrogen catabolic
genes. The GATA factors are regulated by the Tor pathway, a
pathway that also regulates the expression of genes involved
in ribosome biogenesis [19].

Cell cycle

deposited research

Modules involved in ribosome biogenesis are active in both
the Spellman [12] and the Gasch [13] dataset. This could be
expected as ribosome biogenesis is known to be tightly coupled to cell cycle progression as well as to environmental
changes that affect growth rate. Different regulators were
found to be associated with these ribosome related modules,
including Arg80, Dal81, Fhl1, Gat3, Gts1, Mbp1, Mth1, Ndd1,
Pdr1, Pho2/Bas2, Rap1, Rgm1, Rme1, Sfp1, Smp1, Swi4, and
Yap5. Of these, Fhl1 and Rap1 were found in most modules.
Consistently, both factors have been reported as main transcriptional regulators of ribosomal gene expression [14,15].
Also, Sfp1 and Rgm1 have been implicated in ribosome biogenesis and most recent data indicate that the former could
act as a receiver of nutritional and stress derived signals
[14,16,17].

Some transcriptional regulators that were retained only from
the Gasch [13] dataset point towards interactions between
this module for galactose metabolism and modules for other
processes, such as cell cycle control via Mbp1 (see also cell
cycle module) [26] and amino acid metabolism via Met32
(see also amino acid module) [27]. In addition, the module for
galactose metabolism contains the regulators Oaf1, Pip2 and
Ume6, which are involved in the induction of peroxisomal
genes participating in β-oxidation [28], potentially linking
galactose metabolism to this process.

automatically imply support by all microarray data. As a
result, a module can only be extended with additional genes if
its regulatory program appears to be active in the conditions
underlying the used microarray study. Based on this observation, we subdivided modules into those involved in general
metabolism found active in both datasets (for example, ribosome synthesis, galactose metabolism) and those related to
processes for which the activity was restricted to either one of
the datasets. To the latter group belong modules involved in
the cell cycle, which were extended in the Spellman dataset
[12], and modules related to nutrient deprivation, stress, respiration, amino acid metabolism, filamentous growth and
meiosis extended in the Gasch dataset [13]. A more detailed
description of the modules is given below.

in response to nutrient availability [15], and Hap2, a transcription factor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle [50]. The ChIPchip data obtained after treatment with rapamycin were especially informative for identifying the different modules comprising this nutrient deprivation module. Rapamycin is
known to inhibit Tor (target of rapamycin) protein kinases,
which function in a nutrient-sensing signal transduction
pathway. Consistently, the processes and regulators for this
module all show connections to the Tor-mediated nutrientsensing signal transduction pathway [49-52].

Stress related conditions
Twenty modules directing general and specific stress
responses were identified and extended in the Gasch dataset
[12]. These modules contain several transcriptional regulators and subsets of them are known to help fine-tune stress
responses to particular conditions. The regulators Msn2 and
Msn4 present in our modules are known key regulators of
stress-responsive gene expression in yeast [53-55]. Several
regulators identified by our analysis can be related to triggering responses upon oxidative stress, such as Skn7, Yap1,
Hap5, Rox1, Hsf1, Nrg1, Pho2/Bas2 and Yap4/Cin5 [56-60].
A connection with oxidative stress may also exist for Sut1, a
factor that, according to the literature, relieves hypoxic genes
from repression by the Cyc8-Tup1 [61] co-repressor complex,
which is recruited to many promoters via regulatory proteins
such as Rox1 [62]. With regard to oxidative stress, links with
other stress responses could also be derived. Indeed, Cup9
mediates copper resistance [63] while Yap6 confers resistance to cisplatin [64].
Some regulators present in the stress related module have
been reported to be operative in aspects indirectly related to
stress response, for instance, Ngr1, Rim101, Sok2 and Ume6
are linked by their roles in meiosis and sporulation (see also
module for filamentation and meiosis) [65-68] and Xbp1 is a
stress-induced transcriptional repressor of the cell cycle (see
also cell cycle module) [69].

Respiration
The Gasch dataset [13] enabled the identification of an
extendable module dedicated to respiration that includes the
heme-responsive factor Hap1 and the subunits Hap2, Hap4,
Hap5 of the heme-activated CCAAT-binding complex [70,71].
Two motifs, motif 7 (Esr2: GRRAAAWTTTTCACT) and 70
(CGCGnnnnnGGGS), of which the latter is defined as a 'new'
motif by Kellis et al. [72], could be associated with this
module.

Amino acid metabolism
The modules for amino acid metabolism were recovered upon
analysis of the Gasch dataset [13]. Support for the validity of
this module came from the presence of Dal81, a positive regulator of multiple nitrogen catabolite repression genes
[21,44,45] and from the presence of Gcn4, the main regulator
in the general amino acid control [46-48]. Also present was

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R37

Leu3, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and in biosynthetic pathways of branchedchain amino acids [73,74]. The regulators Cbf1, Met4 and Met
32 of our module have previously been shown to be required
for the coordinated expression of the structural genes from
the sulfur amino acid biosynthesis pathway [75,76].
Additional regulators present in this module may provide
links to other regulatory programs. The presence of Rox1 and
Skn7 can couple this network to the program for oxidative
stress response (see also stress related module) [56,57], while
Sfp1, Rap1, and Gcr2, a coactivator of Rap1 [77], reflect links
with ribosome biosynthesis (see also module for ribosome
biogenesis) [14,21,78].

Modules involved in filamentous growth
Five modules related to filamentous growth could be
retrieved from the Gasch dataset [13]. The filamentous
growth pathway induces a morphogenetic switch under
adverse growth, such as nutrient deprivation. This switch
induces the formation of pseudohyphae, which are believed to
facilitate foraging for scarce nutrients [41-43]. Consistent
with the literature, these modules included the regulators
Ste12 and its interacting partners Dig1 and Tec1, as well as
Sok2 and its downstream regulators Ash1 and Phd1 [41-43].
The regulator Nrg1, also present in our module, is known to
function as a negative regulator of filamentous growth and as
a repressor of FLO11, which encodes a cell surface glycoprotein required for filamentous growth [79] (see also galactose
metabolism module).
Filamentous growth is known to be intimately linked to
growth and cell cycle control. As such, it is not surprising that
our analysis also retrieved for this module factors involved in
cell cycle control, such as components of SBF and MBF, that
is, Swi4 and Mbp1 [29,30] or Fkh2 [80] (see also cell cycle
module). This close link to growth also explains the presence
in our modules of Fhl1 [14,15], Hap1 [70,71] and Sut1 [61] as
they all have important functions in determining the growth
potential of yeast cells. Our analysis additionally retrieved
Sko1, an important regulator allowing cells to cope with
osmotic stress. Osmotic stress can, under some conditions,
induce filamentous growth and as such the presence of Sko1
in our modules makes sense [81,82].

Modules involved in meiosis
Finally, we identified one extendable module in the Gasch
dataset [13] that is regulated by Ume6 and Rap1. We refer to

this process [83,84] while Rap1 is believed to control Ume1, a
regulator that is required for the repression of early meiotic
genes [84].

information

We performed a similar analysis, this time with the extended
seed modules of ReMoDiscovery. Extending the seeds generally results in a smaller number of statistically overrepresented regulators in the modules (Table 1), but an increase in
gene content. Accordingly, the scores for overlap in gene content with GRAM [9] and SAMBA [3] improved. The normalized Jaccard similarity score increased from 15 standard
deviations to about 100 standard deviations for GRAM [9]
and from 6 to about 21 standard deviations for SAMBA [3]
(data not shown). At the same time, the regulator overlap
with GRAM [9] increased to about 50 standard deviations. In
other words, increasing the number of genes in a module

interactions

To compare the gene and regulator content between modules
obtained by GRAM [9], SAMBA [3] and ReMoDiscovery, we
used an unsupervised scoring scheme that considers gene
content and regulator content separately (that is, the
normalized Jaccard similarity score as defined in Materials
and methods). Since parameter settings influence the module
composition, we calculated normalized Jaccard similarity

For all settings, we observed that both the overlap in gene and
regulator content between the GRAM [9] modules and the
seed modules of ReMoDiscovery was highly significant (normalized Jaccard similarity scores around 15 and 25 standard
deviations, respectively). Since GRAM [9] generally returns
modules with less regulator content, the similarity in regulatory programs was best for the most stringent ReMoDiscovery ChIP-chip threshold (Figure 3). Accordingly, gene content
was most similar if the ReMoDiscovery correlation threshold
was lowered. From these results, we conclude that the ReMoDiscovery seed modules and the GRAM [9] modules represent similar patterns in the data, the former focusing on
modules with fewer genes and more regulators, the latter on
modules with more genes and less regulators. The regulatory
programs discovered by SAMBA [3], using the discretization
method suggested by the authors, did not significantly resemble those of ReMoDiscovery or GRAM [9]. The gene content
on the other hand did show some overlap (Figure 3).

refereed research

We analyzed running times on these datasets at distinct
parameter settings for each of the tested algorithms on an
Intel Pentium 2 GHz laptop with 512 Mb RAM. Independent
of the setting for the 'overlap prior factor', the SAMBA algorithm [3] was rather quick, with running times around three
minutes. For parameter settings close to its defaults, ReMoDiscovery performed slightly better. Running times were on
the order of one minute. In general, the speed of the Apriori
algorithm is roughly proportional to the number of modules
that satisfy the constraints. In contrast, running times of the
GRAM algorithm [9] were prohibitive if the data contained
genes with more than ten significant ChIP-chip interactions
due to the exponential increase in the number of candidate
core modules (see [9] for details). After filtering out those
genes, running times decreased to about 20 minutes at the
default parameter setting.

(higher gene content) corresponded to decreasing the
number of regulators (lower regulator content), making the
results even more similar to those of GRAM [9].
All tools discussed in this study serve two purposes: they
simultaneously identify clusters of co-expressed genes and
the corresponding regulatory programs. To evaluate the first
aspect, we calculated the average functional overrepresentation of the modules detected by each of the tools on our
benchmark dataset (Table 1). We used default parameter settings for GRAM [9], SAMBA [3] and ReMoDiscovery. From
these results it appears that, for all tools, regulatory modules
are well enriched for known functional classes. For ReMoDiscovery, the enrichment score improved significantly upon
extension of the seeds.
To test the sensitivity of these tools in retrieving regulators
known to be involved in the cell cycle, we compiled a list of
known regulators (see Materials and methods) and tested
how many of these occurred in the regulatory programs of any
of the cell cycle related modules (Table 2). We also displayed
the ratios of the number of known cell cycle regulators over
the total number of regulators detected in a module's pro-

gram, averaged over all modules. These results show that
both ReMoDiscovery and GRAM [9] had a considerably
higher sensitivity than SAMBA [3] in retrieving cell cycle
related regulators.
Conclusions about specificity should be treated with care
because, in the absence of a golden standard (that is, a completely characterized network of interactions), the number of
false positive predictions can never be quantified. Although
the regulatory programs of GRAM [9] and ReMoDiscovery
seem to be more enriched in cell cycle related regulators
(larger ratio of known cell cycle related regulators over the
total number of regulators than SAMBA [3]), it is not possible
to distinguish between true and false positives without further experimental validation.

Discussion

In this study, we present a two-step methodology to unravel
active modules based on the concurrent analysis of three
independently acquired data sources. The seed discovery step
predicts putative seed modules (consisting of genes,
regulators and corresponding motifs). The seed extension

information

To assess to what extent ReMoDiscovery discovers modules
similar to those detected by other module identification tools,
we compared it with previously described tools on the same
benchmark set. Compared to GRAM [9], we found a significant overlap in both gene and regulator content of the

interactions

We developed an intuitive algorithm for the automatic inference of transcriptional modules. It is fast, readily tunable and
flexible, in the sense that it can easily be extended to include
other information sources, as long as the constraints on the
gene sets are hereditary. Our method does not require large
microarray compendia but allows for an easy first screen of
transcriptional modules being active or present in one's own
'small' microarray dataset, using publicly available ChIP-chip
and motif data. In principle, our method is generic and applicable for all organisms for which the three data sources are
available. However, its sensitivity will be largely determined
by the completeness of ChIP-chip and motif data, which are
expected to improve over time.

refereed research

Conclusion

deposited research

In contrast to previous approaches in which motif information results from downstream analysis of the inferred modules, our method used this information as an independent
input source. To avoid circular reasoning, we ensured that
motif information was derived from sequence information
only and did not rely on any other experimental data source
(for instance, as available in the motif compendium of Kellis
et al. [72]). Therefore, the compendium of motifs we used as
an input dataset is far from complete. This explains why we
detected less motifs for each module compared to, for
instance, Kato et al. [7] or Harbison et al. [6].

In our hands, the regulatory programs found with the SAMBA
algorithm [3] did not significantly resemble those of ReMoDiscovery or GRAM [9]. The possibility might exist that
SAMBA [3] focuses on other aspects of the data and, therefore, detects fundamentally different modules. However,
based on our analysis we believe that the regulatory programs
recovered by SAMBA [3] are unlikely to be biologically meaningful as the sensitivity in detecting cell cycle related regulators was low. Most likely the available download of the
SAMBA-Expander application [3] is not yet fully adjusted to
the use of heterogeneous data sources.

reports

The biological relevance of our method was assessed by
applying it on the extensively studied Spellman [12] and
Gasch [13] datasets. Comparison of our results with the literature showed that experimental evidence existed for many of
our statistically significant seed modules. For modules for
which no direct evidence existed so far, a plausible explanation for their composition could very often be inferred from
the literature and potential new links between the detected
pathways and modules could be derived. A seed module that
can be extended with more genes in the seed extension step
gives a clue to the regulatory program being active in the prevailing conditions of the tested microarray experiment. Based
on this observation, a distinction could be made between
modules involved in general metabolism that were active in
both datasets (for instance, ribosome synthesis, galactose
metabolism) and the more specialized modules (for instance,
cell cycle, nutrient deprived conditions, stress related conditions, amino acid metabolism, respiration, filamentous
growth or meiosis) for which the activity was restricted to
either one of the datasets.

detected modules over a sweep of different parameters. The
similarity between both algorithms was larger when comparing the results of GRAM [9] with those of the extended seed
modules than with the original seed modules. This difference
reflects the trade-off between the number of regulators and
the number of genes in biological modules: modules comprising a regulatory program with many regulators (such as our
seed modules) can be expected to contain few genes with a
potentially highly related function. In a module, the number
of genes will usually increase with a decreasing number of
regulators. Obviously, there will be more genes that only
share part of their regulatory program, that is, the part that is
active under the tested set of conditions. While our seed modules give a view on the complete regulatory program, our
extended modules highlight the program active in the microarray dataset. They contain more genes and are more similar
to the GRAM [9] output. Hence, with ReMoDiscovery we
offer an algorithm that can be used to focus on very specific
regulatory programs (seed modules) as well as on less specific
modules with more genes (extended seed modules). The most
appropriate choice depends on the specific research question
under study, so usually there is no single best solution for the
outcome of a module detection algorithm.

reviews

The data integration problem is tackled in a very direct way:
using the Apriori algorithm, no iteration over the different
data sources is required. As regards the algorithmic
properties, a comparison of ReMoDiscovery with other module detection tools revealed that speed is one of the major
advantages of the Apriori strategy. ReMoDiscovery's running
times and memory requirements are drastically smaller than
those of certain other module detection algorithms such as
the GRAM [9] algorithm. This is important as most module
discovery algorithms require repeated testing to find the optimal parameter settings. Together with the straightforward
biological interpretation of the parameters, its speed turns
ReMoDiscovery into a user-friendly, readily tunable tool.

Materials and methods
Microarray data
The Spellman [12] and Gasch [12] datasets were used as
microarray benchmark sets. The Spellman dataset [12] contains 77 experiments describing the dynamic changes of yeast
genes during the cell cycle. The Gasch dataset [13] consists of
177 experiments, examining gene expression behavior during
various stress conditions. Expression profiles were normalized (subtracting the mean of each profile and dividing by the
standard deviation across the time points) and stored in a
gene expression data matrix, denoted by A, with a row for
each gene expression profile and a column for each condition.

Location data
Genome-wide location data performed by Harbison et al. [6]
were downloaded from their website [85]. These contain
information regarding the binding of 204 regulators
(although Harbison et al. [6] only describe 203 regulators) to
their respective target genes in rich medium (the 106 regulators initially profiled by Lee et al. [86] and 98 new regulators). Besides rich medium, 84 regulators were profiled in at
least one environmental condition other than rich medium.
For ReMoDiscovery, the ChIP-chip data matrix (denoted by
R) consists of one minus the 'ChIP-chip p values' for each
gene, obtained from the combined ratios of immuno-precipitated and control DNA using an error model (see Harbison et
al. [6]). Both GRAM [9] and SAMBA [3] use ChIP-chip p values and require some additional preprocessing. As the
authors of GRAM [9] suggested, genes that bind more than 10
regulators (ChIP-chip p value < 0.001) were omitted. For
SAMBA [3], we transformed all ChIP-chip data to a log10
scale, nullified all values above 0.02 and used a parametric
discretization setting in the Expander software tool according
to the authors' advice.

Motif data
The motif data used in this study were obtained from a comparative genome analysis between distinct yeast species (phylogenetic shadowing) performed by Kellis et al. [72]. These
motifs, available online as regular expressions, were transformed into their corresponding weight matrices (see online
information for more details [11]). Out of the 71 putative
motifs described by Kellis et al. [72], the 53 most informative
ones were retained. The weight matrices corresponding to
these motifs was subsequently used to screen all intergenic
sequences of yeast using MotifLocator [87]. The higher the
score of a motif hit in a gene, the more likely it will be a true
instance. Results of the screening can thus be summarized in
a matrix M that contains for each gene-motif combination a
score that indicates how likely it is the gene contains an
instance of the respective motif.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R37

that, given an invalid module, none of its extensions can ever
become valid. For this reason, we call the constraint set
'hereditary'. Such a hereditary constraint set has first been
deployed in the so-called Apriori algorithm, which is
described in a seminal paper by Agrawal and Imielensky [10].
In ReMoDiscovery, the constraints are the minimum number
of regulators (or regulator support constraint sc), the minimum number of motifs (or motif support constraint sm), and
a minimal pairwise correlation between genes in a module te.
We apply these constraints to find regulatory modules that
contain as many genes as possible. Since the regulator binding and motif data consist of non-binary score values, the support values are estimated by using thresholded regulator and
motif scores, equal to 1 if the score is larger than a threshold
tc or tm, respectively, and 0 otherwise. After thresholding, the
regulator and motif data are binary, and are represented in
the matrices R and M (Figure 1). Note also that the current
implementation uses correlation as a measure for co-expression. If required, however, other similarity measures could be
used in the Apriori framework.
Using the hereditary constraints results in a significant
speed-up with respect to a naïve exploration of the space of
possible modules, because we do not need to explicitly check
large gene sets for validity. Each subset of genes of a valid
module necessarily represents a valid module. This fact can
be exploited to reduce the number of times the constraints
need to be evaluated. Indeed, only gene sets for which all subsets have been found to be valid modules need to be checked,
and they can be discarded a priori if one of their subsets turns
out to be invalid, even before checking the constraints. In
summary, a high level description of the algorithm is: first,
choose parameter values sc, sm, te, tm and tc; second, threshold
the regulator and motif data using thresholds tm and tc, yielding the binary tables R and M; third, find all maximal modules for which the support constraints specified by sc and sm
are satisfied, and for which the correlation between the gene
expression profiles of any pair of genes in the module exceeds
the required threshold te; and fourth, report maximal modules along with the motifs and regulators that support them.
To assess statistical significance, we assigned a seed module p
value to each module obtained at a specific parameter setting.
To this end, we randomly permuted the gene labels for each
dataset (ChIP-chip, motif data, gene expression) separately.
This randomization procedure was repeated 100 times. The
results of ReMoDiscovery seed discovery on these random
datasets were used to construct an empirical joint distribution on the number of regulators and genes from which we
calculated a seed module p value for each of the seeds found
in the real data sets.

information

We used ReMoDiscovery with a ChIP-chip threshold (one
minus the ChIP-chip p value) equal to 0.99, a correlation
threshold of 0.75 and a minimum of one motif and four regulators, respectively. When comparing regulator content from
ReMoDiscovery to SAMBA [3] and GRAM [9], we looked at
the ReMoDiscovery seed modules for a minimum number of
regulators equal to 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10. We also examined the
influence of a variation in ChIP-chip threshold, in the range
[0.98 to 0.999] (values below 0.98 were not tested as the
quality of the biological outcome started to decrease). The
SAMBA [3] 'overlap prior factor' was varied between 0 and 1,
in steps of 0.05. The latter parameter describes the extent of
overlap that is permitted between different modules in the
same solution. For the GRAM algorithm [9], we varied all
user defined parameters in a wide range: the base 10 logarithm of the 'core profile p value cutoff' between minus 12 and
minus 3, the 'num in core cutoff' between 5 and 97 and 'module p value cutoff' between 0.001 and 0.05. When comparing
gene content from ReMoDiscovery to SAMBA [3] and GRAM
[9], we considered ReMoDiscovery output for varying correlation threshold, in the range (0.65 to 0.9).

The hypergeometric distribution was used to determine
which functional categories were statistically overrepresented in the extended modules. For each module we computed the fraction of genes associated with each functional
category in the MIPS database [90] and used the hypergeometric distribution to calculate a corresponding 'functional
enrichment p value'. Modules with a functional enrichment p
value below 0.05 (no compensation for multiple testing) were
considered significantly enriched.

The total data matrix used consisted of 6,144 genes (that is,
the intersection of the number of rows of the motif, ChIP-chip
and microarray matrices). When applying our algorithm to
the yeast dataset, we used the default parameters, that is, the
motif threshold tm equaled 0.9, the ChIP-chip threshold tc was
0.99, and the correlation threshold te was 0.75. The minimal
number of motifs sm was set to 1 such that we find seed modules that have at least 1 motif in their regulatory program. We
varied the minimal number of regulators sc over the values 3,
4, 6, 8 and 10 for the Spellman [12] dataset and over 4, 6, 8
and 10 for the Gasch [13] dataset. Resulting seed modules
with a seed module p value > 0.05 were evaluated during the
second seed extension step.

Module comparison was based on the normalized Jaccard
similarity score [89]. For a specific parameter setting, we verify for each pair of genes (regulators) whether these two genes
(regulators) occur together in at least one module. Doing so
for all gene (regulator) pairs and for both methods, one can
define the number of true positives TP as the number of gene
pairs occurring together at least once in both methods. Analogously, the number of false positives FP, true negatives TN
and false negatives FN can be defined. As in [89], we used the
Jaccard similarity score TP/(TP + FP + FN) to score the overlap between two module compositions. In addition, randomizations were used to determine the significance of a specific
score. This leads to the notion of normalized similarity scores,
expressed as the number of standard deviations from the
mean of the distribution of Jaccard similarity scores for randomized module compositions. For a more detailed description of our module comparison approach, we refer to our
supplementary website [11].

comment

with n genes, we first calculated the mean score of that motif
in the module by averaging out the entries in the original
motif (regulator) data matrix in the column corresponding to
the motif (regulator) and the rows corresponding to genes in
the module. We then compared this mean score to the distribution of scores obtained on a random selection of n genes,
for the same motif (regulator). Note that the mean score of a
module by random gene selection is approximately Gaussianly distributed (central limit theorem), with mean equal to
the mean over all genes, and variance equal to the overall
variance divided by the size of the module. This Gaussian
approximation of the H0-hypothesis is used to calculate a
module enrichment p value for a particular motif or regulator.
