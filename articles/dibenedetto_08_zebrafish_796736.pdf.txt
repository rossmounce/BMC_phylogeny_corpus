Abstract
Background: Brd2 belongs to the bromodomain-extraterminal domain (BET) family of transcriptional coregulators, and functions as a pivotal histone-directed recruitment scaffold in chromatin modification complexes
affecting signal-dependent transcription. Brd2 facilitates expression of genes promoting proliferation and is
implicated in apoptosis and in egg maturation and meiotic competence in mammals; it is also a susceptibility gene
for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) in humans. The brd2 ortholog in Drosophila is a maternal effect, embryonic
lethal gene that regulates several homeotic loci, including Ultrabithorax. Despite its importance, there are few
systematic studies of Brd2 developmental expression in any organism. To help elucidate both conserved and novel
gene functions, we cloned and characterized expression of brd2 cDNAs in zebrafish, a vertebrate system useful
for genetic analysis of development and disease, and for study of the evolution of gene families and functional
diversity in chordates.
Results: We identify cDNAs representing two paralogous brd2 loci in zebrafish, brd2a on chromosome 19 and
brd2b on chromosome 16. By sequence similarity, syntenic and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence for
structural divergence of brd2 after gene duplication in fishes. brd2 paralogs show potential for modular domain
combinations, and exhibit distinct RNA expression patterns throughout development. RNA in situ hybridizations
in oocytes and embryos implicate brd2a and brd2b as maternal effect genes involved in egg polarity and egg to
embryo transition, and as zygotic genes important for development of the vertebrate nervous system and for
morphogenesis and differentiation of the digestive tract. Patterns of brd2 developmental expression in zebrafish
are consistent with its proposed role in Homeobox gene regulation.
Conclusion: Expression profiles of zebrafish brd2 paralogs support a role in vertebrate developmental patterning
and morphogenesis. Our study uncovers both maternal and zygotic contributions of brd2, the analysis of which
may provide insight into the earliest events in vertebrate development, and the etiology of some forms of epilepsy,
for which zebrafish is an important model. Knockdowns of brd2 paralogs in zebrafish may now test proposed
function and interaction with homeotic loci in vertebrates, and help reveal the extent to which functional novelty
or partitioning has occurred after gene duplication.

Background
The BET family of proteins is defined by a dual bromodomain and an extra-terminal (ET) protein interaction
domain [1]. The 110 amino acid bromodomain motif
binds histones in an acetyl-lysine-dependent manner [2],
and proteins carrying this module are major interpreters
of the epigenetic histone code [3]. BET proteins in particular provide a scaffold for ordered recruitment, anchoring, and regulation of various chromatin modifying
factors; they also act as adaptors that bridge sequence-specific transcription factors with the basal transcription
machinery [4]. Ultimately, BET proteins regulate signaldependent transcription as coactivators or corepressors,
acting to maintain expressed or silenced states of gene
expression [1,5], and have been implicated in meiosis [6],
spermatogenesis [7], oocyte maturation [8], apoptosis [9],
embryonic patterning [10] and especially, cell cycle control [11] and oncogenesis [12]. There is evidence for
duplication and divergence of BET genes around the time
of the emergence of vertebrates; accordingly, there are
multiple members in each species, with four, Brd2-5,
known in mammals [1].
The founding members of the Brd2 subfamily of BET proteins provide an evolutionary framework for functional
analysis of this group. Yeast bdf1 encodes a basal transcription factor required for normal growth and meiosis
[6,13]. The Drosophila homolog of brd2, female sterile
homeotic-1 (fsh1), is a maternal effect embryonic lethal
gene required for oogenesis and proper segment formation and identity [10]. fsh interacts genetically with several
homeotic genes, in some instances, via activation of trithorax genes (trx-G) [14]. Interestingly, trx-G genes encode
various chromatin-interacting proteins and are antagonists of chromatin repressor Polycomb genes (Pc-G);
together, the trx-G and Pc-G regulatory axes act to maintain proper Homeobox (Hox) expression patterns through
development [15]. Brd2 is potentially a critical modulator
of Hox cluster chromatin modification states through its
effect on these major epigenetic axes [16]. Homologs of
trx-G and Pc-G genes have antagonistic and homeotic regulatory functions in mice [17]; it remains to be seen if
Brd2 is involved in Hox control in vertebrate development
also. Surprisingly, fsh RNA and protein are distributed
evenly in the embryo; spatial effects may result from
restricted expression of co-regulators or downstream effectors [18].
The mammalian versions of Brd2 show both novel and
overlapping functions compared with yeast and fly
homologs. First, mouse/human Brd2 interacts with chromatin-modifying and transcription initiation complexes
to affect gene transcription as part of pol II Mediator
[11,19]. Specifically, Brd2 translocates to the nucleus
upon mitogen-stimulation and enhances E2F-regulated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

gene transcription by recruiting cell cycle regulator E2F
and a histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) to target promoters
[11,19]. Mammalian Brd2 thus links cytoplasmic signal
transduction to E2F-mediated entry into mitosis. Consistent with this, transgenic mice with lymphoid-restricted
overexpression of Brd2 up-regulate E2F target gene cyclin
A, and develop B cell lymphoma and leukemia [20]. Interestingly, several trx-G genes act as genetic regulators of E2F
in Drosophila [21], and chromosomal abnormalities in the
gene for trx human homolog MLL, underlie several forms
of leukemia [22]; possibly, this reflects a conserved Brd2/
trx/E2F regulatory pathway. Second, both mouse and
human Brd2 genes produce testis-specific transcripts, and
are implicated in spermatogenesis and/or oocyte maturation [7,8], thus maintaining a role in meiotic processes. In
mouse oocytes,Brd2 RNA changes localization during
oocyte maturation, from nuclear inclusion (immature) to
nuclear exclusion (mature), perhaps increasing the fraction available for translation during meiotic reentry [8].
Whether this pattern holds true, and whether Brd2 acts as
a maternal effect gene in vertebrates, is unknown. Third,
both novel and conserved roles for Brd2 in development
are likely. Brd2 RNAs are enriched in embryonic neuroepithelia of mouse brain ventricles, dorsal root ganglia, and
spinal cord [23,24], and mouse Brd2 protein localizes to
nuclei of proliferating neuronal precursors, but not of
post-mitotic neurons [23], suggesting a role in vertebrate
nervous system differentiation. Brd2 is also identified as a
primary response gene transcriptionally induced in programmed cell death of rat neurons during development
[9]. Recent studies corroborate a dual role for Brd2 in
apoptosis and proliferation, showing Brd2 translocation
to the nucleus of mouse mammary epithelial cells during
both proliferative and post-lactation regressive stages
[19], and demonstrating initiation of apoptosis in cultured cells by overexpression of Brd2 [25]. Consistent
with a role in neuronal development, human Brd2 has
recently been identified as the major susceptibility gene
for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy [26]. A few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Brd2 promoter may
account for the phenotype, suggesting that regulated
expression of this gene is critical for proper development
of neural tissue [26].
Taken together, these studies implicate Brd2 as an important endpoint of signal transduction pathways regulating
gene expression states necessary for proper differentiation,
proliferation, and apoptosis during development and in
adult tissues [27]. To identify and characterize both
ancient conserved and novel derived functions, and to
understand the structural and functional evolution of the
Brd2 subfamily, parallel genetic and biochemical studies
in different species are needed. To this end, we cloned
brd2 cDNAs in zebrafish, analyzed sequence similarities
and phylogeny with other known BET genes, and charac-

terized overall RNA expression patterns during embryogenesis and in oocytes. In this report, we describe multiple
brd2-related sequences in zebrafish, and present evidence
for structural and expression divergence of brd2 paralogs
in this species. The developmental profile of brd2 in
zebrafish corroborates proposed functions from mouse
and Drosophila studies, as well as suggests novel functions
for the gene in vertebrate development.

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of zebrafish brd2-related
cDNAs
We cloned the zebrafish homolog of brd2 by screening a
15–19 hour embryonic cDNA library ([28], see Methods).
Schematics of three cDNA classes obtained, with encoded
protein domains, are shown in Figure 1A and 1B. Two
classes of cDNA, zf626 and zf619, are 98.6% identical,
and encode predicted proteins of 836 and 838 amino
acids, respectively (Fig. 1A). Proteins are identical except
for an additional met/gly pair in zf619P, in a region of
met/gly repeats, and contain features typical of the BET
family [1], including dual bromodomains, a nuclear
localization signal (NLS), and a C-terminal ET domain
(Fig. 1A, patterned boxes). The zf626 and zf619 cDNAs
differ from one another by several small deletions/additions, all but one of which occur in the 3'UTR, and a total
of 44 SNPs (Fig. 1A, thin vertical lines). All 18 SNPs in the
protein-coding region result in silent mutations, suggesting negative selection, while sequences in the 3'UTR show
greater divergence (97.4% identity remains). The nature
of these differences make it likely that zf626 and zf619
represent two independent, very closely related BET genes,
or, divergent alleles of the same gene, rather than alternate
transcripts. The third class of cDNA, zf69, encodes a predicted protein of 276 amino acids with a single bromodomain equivalent to bromodomain 1 of zf626/zf619, but
lacking other BET features (compare Fig. 1A and 1B). The
zf69 protein shares 70% identity with zf626/zf619 proteins across 276 amino acids of overlap, with 89.4% identity and 100% amino acid conservation across the
bromodomain. At the level of nucleic acid, zf69 and
zf626/zf619 show 63.3% and 79.5% identity, respectively, over these same regions. Thus, zf69 represents an
independent bromodomain-containing gene, related to
zf626/zf619, but atypical of the BET family. Starting at
base 880, 48 bases upstream from the apparent stop of the
zf69 open reading frame (Fig. 1B, vertical arrow), nucleotide similarity with zf626/zf619 falls abruptly to 43.1%
(Fig. 1B, gray-filled portion). Blast searches identify repetitive sequences related to zebrafish Dana Sine and L3 Line
repeat families in this discontinuous region, which was
found to represent an alternative exon in zf69 cDNA (see
below).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

To identify zebrafish sequences related to zf626/zf619
and zf69, we conducted similarity searches against NCBI,
VEGA (version 24) and Ensembl (release 44) databases
(see Methods). Several sequences show 99–100% identity
to the cloned cDNAs (Table 1). zf626 and zf619 cDNAs
derive from two distinct genomic clones, mapping to linkage group (LG) 19, that are predicted to encode zebrafish
brd2 by structural homology and genomic synteny with
the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) (Table 1;
see also Fig. 9). Surprisingly, the two genomic clones originate from different zebrafish strains: clone CH211-51F10
(encoding zf626) is from strain Tubingen (Table 1,
BX510994), while clone BUSM-12F11 (encoding zf619)
is from strain AB (Table 1, AL672176.10). At some point,
mixing of Tubingen and AB genomes must have occurred,
either in the construction of the cDNA library, or historically, via genetic introgression between strains. The only
other known sequences corresponding to zf626/zf619
clones are two partial cDNAs with the zf619 configuration
of SNPs (Table 1, BC045866.1 and AF032395.1), and sets
of ESTs that exhibit either the zf626 or the zf619 SNP configuration (data not shown). Taken together, these data
support the hypothesis that zf626 and zf619 represent
divergent alleles of the brd2 gene on LG 19, marked by distinct strain-specific haplotypes. We obtained independent
confirmation of the genomic location of zf626 and zf619
cDNA sequences by radiation hybrid mapping (see Methods).
We identified three sets of zebrafish sequences nearly
identical to the region upstream of the discontinuous
exon junction of zf69 cDNA: a predicted transcript (Table
1, XM_692734.2; Fig. 1C) from genomic contig
NW_001511437.1 (locus 596354, simbrd2); a predicted
transcript (Table 1, ENSDART00000049051; Fig. 1C)
from
Ensembl
Zv6
scaffold2405
(locus
ENSDARG00000046087); and a partial cDNA, brd2b,
(Table 1, BC055508; Fig. 1C). Genomic contig
NW_001511437.1 (NCBI) and Zv6 scaffold2405
(Ensembl) sequences are identical, and map to LG 16. We
aligned genomic sequences with predicted and cloned
transcripts, and found potential exons in locus
ENSDARG00000046087 that correspond to each RNA,
including the entire zf69. The discontinuous region
begins at an intron/exon junction and is included as part
of an exon in zf69; in XM_692734.2 and
ENSDART00000049051, it is spliced as an intron. We
confirmed
that
zf69
cDNA
derives
from
ENSDARG00000046087 on chromosome 16 by radiation
hybrid mapping (see Methods).
Interestingly, the ENSDARG00000046087 locus exhibits
possible domain shuffling. The locus is predicted to
encode two database-supported transcripts, and two
model-derived ab
initio
transcripts (Table 1,

Sequences directly related to cloned zf626, zf619, and zf69 cDNAs were identified using blastn and blastp algorithms to search for similarities
against both nucleotide and protein databases at NCBI (n), Vega version 24 (v), and zebrafish Ensembl release 44 (e). The linkage group (LG), gene
name, and conserved domains are shown for each entry. BD1, bromodomain 1; BD2, bromodomain 2;NLS, nuclear localization signal; ET, extra
terminal domain. Presence of conserved domains are indicated by "x". p, partial domain; d, degenerate domain;-------?, indicates truncation without
stop codon;-------taa, indicates truncation with stop codon; SINE/taa, indicates repeat sequence with premature stop; 19*, genomic clones from
chromosome 19 of strain AB. ENSDARG00000046087 locus contains loc569354, and potentially encodes four transcripts: one supported by
evidence (16.1, ENSDART00000049051), and three predicted by different algorithms (16.2, GENSCAN00000006161; 16.3,
FGENESH00000070546; XM_692734.2).

XM_692734.2,
ENSDART00000049051,
GENSCAN00000006161,
FGENESH00000070546,
respectively), each of which is identical to zf69 from the
start of the open reading frame to the intron/exon discontinuous junction (Fig. 1B,C vertical arrows), a region
encoding the first bromodomain. At this point, all transcripts diverge, consistent with alternative splicing at this
site, and predict proteins with different distal domains
(Fig 1B,C patterned boxes): zf69 ends prematurely due to
a stop codon in the included intron (Figs. 1B; 2, TAA); the
ENSDART00000049051 protein has a degenerate second
bromodomain and a nuclear localization signal; and
GENSCAN00000006161, FGENESH00000070546, and
XM_692734.2 each encode proteins with a distal fragment only of the second bromodomain followed by a
nuclear localization signal, and the first two thirds of an
ET domain. Other predicted features include C-terminal
extensions of unknown function and an N-terminal transport-associated protein (TAP) domain (Fig. 1C). Finally,
partial brd2b cDNA BC055508.1 encodes two canonical

bromodomains, but ends prematurely without a stop
codon at the NLS (Fig. 1D). NW_001511437/
scaffold2405 genomic sequences account for all but two
internal exons in BC055508.1 cDNA that encode the second canonical bromodomain. Using Blastn, we found
these exons in an unmapped contig, Zv6_ scaffold
NA1181, that shows at least 300 bases of overlap with
NW_001511437. We believe further analysis will place
NA1181 within NW_001511437, confirming the
ENSDARG00000046087 locus on LG 16 as the source of
all transcript isoforms, including simbrd2 and brd2b. Thus,
several versions of Brd2-related proteins may exist, with
different subsets of typical BET features, and with or without additional domains (Table 1).
Sequence similarities and phylogeny of brd2-related
sequences
Blastp searches of GenBank databases with zf626/zf619
and zf69 predicted proteins identify Brd2 orthologs as
highest hits in other species. zf626/zf619 proteins share

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:39

72–73% identity with medaka [GenBank: BAD93258]
and pufferfish [EMBL: CAG11678] Brd2, and 63–64%
identity with human [GenBank: NP_005095] and mouse
[GenBank: NP_034368] Brd2, over the entire sequence. In
comparison, zf69 protein shows only 67–68% and 56%
identity to other fish and mammalian Brd2 proteins,
respectively, over 260 amino acids. All three predicted
proteins are less similar to members of other BET subfamilies, namely Brd3, Brd4, and Brdt. Using
ENSDART00000049051 predicted protein for comparisons gives similar results. Taken together, sequence similarity, domain architecture, and genomic location data
verify zf626/zf619 as true zebrafish orthologs of brd2, and
zf69 as belonging to the related simbrd2/brd2b locus, of
uncertain position in the BET family.
To investigate the evolutionary relationship of these
genes, we searched individual fish databases from Oryzias,
Tetraodon, and Takifugu genome projects for similarities to
zf626/zf619 and zf69. We identified all putative BET
genes in fishes this way, and included them in phylogenetic analyses of BET vertebrate homologs (see Methods).
Figure 2 shows a maximum likelihood tree with parsimony bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability support values. For all trees, zf626/zf619 and zf69 group with
other brd2 genes, rather than with BET paralogs (brd3,
brd4, or brdt), and within the brd2 clade, zf626/zf619
groups with fish brd2 orthologs. zf69 and related simbrd2/
brd2b sequences from chromosome 16 form a well-supported clade that may be seen as a subclade of the fish
brd2 group, along with recently described Onchorynchus
(trout) brd2L [29]. This, together with the Oryzias
unknown brd sequence positioned just outside of the
entire brd2 cluster in fishes, provide evidence for at least
one duplication of ancestral brd2 in fishes, likely as part of
the whole genome duplication thought to have occurred
in teleosts after the split from the tetrapod lineage [30].
Subsequent gene loss in some fish species [30], or incomplete genomic data, may explain the failure to find brd2b
orthologs in Tetraodon or Takifugu. Together, these data
indicate that zf69/simbrd2/brd2b sequences represent a
single brd2 paralogous locus on chromosome 16 in
zebrafish. Following nomenclature guidelines for paralogs [31], this locus should be referred to as brd2b rather
than simbrd2.
Figure 3 shows the alignment of core BET domains of
zebrafish Brd2 and two chromosome 16 predicted proteins
(16.1,
ENSDART00000049051;
16.2
GENSCAN00000006161) with those of selected species
homologs. As expected, the greatest similarity is found
between domains of zebrafish Brd2 and other fish Brd2
proteins (eg. with Oryzias: bromo1, 98.3%; bromo2,
88.3%; ET, 95% identity), and similarity even to human
Brd2 domains remains quite high (bromo1, 91.7%;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

bromo2, 83.3%; ET 85% identity). Domains of chromosome 16 paralogs are next highest in similarity to
zebrafish Brd2 (16.1 bromo1, 95%; Brd2b bromo2,
87.7%; 16.2 ET, 89.2% identity), with the exception of
degenerate bromodomain 2 of 16.1, which shows only
21.7% identity, although amino acid conservation
remains high at 88.3%. Thus, in agreement with phylogenetic analysis in Fig. 2, Brd2 within-species paralogs are
more divergent than between-species orthologs in fish,
perhaps due to relaxation of selective constraints on conserved domain structure in paralogs. When compared
with Onchorynchus Brd2L, chromosome 16 paralogs
show higher similarity than does zebrafish Brd2, as
expected, in bromodomains (Brd2 bromo1, 93%; 16.1
bromo1, 95%; Brd2 bromo2, 85%; Brd2b bromo2,
91.7% identity), but less similarity in ET domains (Brd2
ET, 94.1%; 16.2 ET, 92.4% identity); possibly, ET
domains of paralogs have evolved to take on different
interactions in zebrafish. Nevertheless, differences from
consensus at identical positions among chromosome 16
protein paralogs and Onchorynchus Brd2L corroborate
phylogenetic clustering of this group (Fig. 3, shared bold
letters). Interestingly, two of these variant positions are
found in the variable ZA loop of the predicted Brd2 bromodomain 1 (BD1) structure (Fig. 3, xx), which is
thought to lend ligand selectivity to an otherwise highly
conserved module [3]. Across Brd2 species homologs,
BD1 and the first two thirds of the ET domain show the
most amino acid identities. Recent structural work on
Brd2 indicates BD1-BD1 homodimerization is critical for
Brd2 function, placing strong selective constraints on the
BD1-BD1 dimer interface region; these constraints compound those shared with bromodomain 2 (BD2) allowing heterodimer interaction (BD1-BD2) and acetyl-lysine
binding [32]. In fact, residues identified as critical for BD1
dimerization and for acetyl-lysine recognition are 100%
conserved in fish orthologs and paralogs (Fig. 3, dots).
Besides BET domains, most Brd2 homologs have pre-NLS
PEST motifs (poly-glu, poly-ser) indicating rapid turnover, and terminal SEED motifs (poly-ser, with glu, asp) of
unknown function [1] (see additional file 1). A significant
difference among vertebrate Brd2 proteins concerns the
configuration of putative non-canonical ser/thr kinase
motifs [12,33]. Although consensus sequences for kinase
subdomains (YHRDLK and APE) within bromodomain 2,
and for catalytic glutamate (EKR) within the ET domain,
are present in fish, bird and mammalian Brd2, a potential
ATP-binding motif with catalytic lysine (GxGxxG and
AxK) [33] in the characteristic position after the NLS, is
found only in bird and mammalian proteins; in Danio
and Oryzias, motifs do not exhibit conserved spacing.
Chromosome 16 paralogs lack kinase motifs of any kind.

Developmental profile of brd2 and simbrd2/brd2b genes
Little is known about the expression of brd2 in vertebrate
development, except for a few intriguing studies in mouse
[19,20]. We therefore examined RNA patterns for brd2a
during zebrafish embryogenesis, and for comparison,
sampled the expression of closely related paralog brd2b.
We generated probes specific for zf626/zf619 (brd2a, chr
19) and for zf69 (brd2b, chr 16); probes could not distinguish between different transcript isoforms from the same
locus however (see Methods). Figure 4 shows Northern
blots of brd2a and brd2b expression during development,
and in dissected ovaries and adult fish. Each probe detects
multiple regulated transcripts and, as in other brd2
orthologs, one or more gonad-enriched RNAs. Two classes
of brd2a RNAs are highly enriched in ovaries and 0–4hour post-fertilization (hpf) embryos (Fig. 4A, 4.8 and 2.8
kb). Interestingly,brd2a transcripts appear degraded in 8–
18 hour embryos, even though RNA in these lanes is intact
by EtBr staining (data not shown), and the same lanes
show intact transcripts when probed with zf69 (compare
same lanes in part B). Possibly, a change specifically in

brd2a turnover rate occurs during segmentation. Three
size classes of brd2b RNAs are detected in fish from 8 hpf.
to adult (Fig. 4B, 6.0 kb, 4.0 kb, 1.8 kb); the largest is
enriched in ovaries and 0–2 hour embryos. Intriguingly,
small brd2b-related transcripts of 70–90 bases are apparent in pharyngula stage embryos (44–48 hpf) and ovaries.
Overall, sizes of detected brd2a and brd2b RNAs could
potentially accommodate predicted transcripts for these
genes (Fig. 1).
To visualize expression of brd2a and brd2b in zebrafish
embryos, the same probes were used for hybridization to
RNA in situ (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). Both brd2a and brd2b RNAs
are present at high levels in the earliest embryos (Fig. 5A–
C), consistent with their being maternally-supplied transcripts. They become enriched in optic primordia and
developing brain and nervous system during segmentation (Fig. 5E–H;M–P). In early through mid-segmentation, as sensory, motor and interneurons appear and
neural keel is forming neural rod [34,35], both sets of
RNAs exhibit a periodic, ladder-like pattern of enrichment

shown). The leftmost ovary lane and the rightmost adult lane are underexposed replicates of adjacent lanes, to allow better
band visualization. Ovary-enriched brd2 RNAs (A, 4.8 and 2.8 kb) and ovary-enriched brd2b RNA (B, 6.0 kb) are also present in
early embryos (A and B, 0–2 h), and are indicated by asterisks (*). Various size classes of brd2 and brd2b RNAs present in
whole adults are also detectable in dissected testis (data not shown).

longitudinally along the trunk anterior-posterior (A-P)
axis, visible over lower level ubiquitous expression (Fig.
5E,G;M,O). Ladder patterns differ in thickness and relative intensity over time between the two genes (Fig. 5
compare E and M; G and O). Cross-sections through 14somite stage embryos show ladder patterns arise in part
due to strongly enriched expression in ventral somites and
in ventral-lateral neural keel/rod and floorplate, which in
fact give rise to motor and interneurons (Fig. 5I; [35]). The
18 somite embryo shows brd2a concentrated in the 10
brain neuromeres and tailbud and generally reduced in
trunk, while brd2b remains high in brain and along the
ventral trunk, but is relatively reduced in tailbud (Fig. 5F
versus 5N). At this stage both genes are expressed in otic
placode (data not shown) and optic primordia (Fig.
5F,N). Thus, early expression of brd2a and brd2b implicate
these genes in formation of the vertebrate nervous system,
in agreement with studies in mice [23]. By 24 hours (prim
5) expression of the two paralogs begins to differ significantly. brd2a is now restricted to head, eye, otic vesicle,
neural tube, developing pectoral fin buds, ventral trunk,
and dorsal post-anal tail (Fig. 5H,J). At higher magnification,brd2a appears enriched in neural retina and cells of
otic vesicle walls (Fig. 5J,L), at midbrain/hindbrain
boundary and specific regions of the cerebellar primordium (Fig. 5J,K), and in anteriorly migrating blood island
cells from ventral trunk (data not shown). Expression of
brd2b at 24 hours is much less restricted; highest levels are
seen in cerebellum, optic primordia and ventral trunk (Fig
5P). By 48 hpf, both genes are expressed in developing
heart, pharyngeal arches, pectoral fin buds, and brain, but
brd2b is absent from neural retina, and reduced in otic
vescicle, dorsal midbrain, and caudal hindbrain compared to brd2a (Fig. 6A and 6B versus 6G and 6H). Cross
sections of 48 hour embryos show additional brd2a
expression in posterior lateral line primordia, pronephric
ducts, and in endodermal tissues that give rise to gut, pancreas, liver, and swim bladder (Fig. 6C–F). At this stage,
brd2a expression in neural tube is much reduced (Fig. 6F).
At 60 hours (pecfin stage), whole mounts show brd2a persistent in all brain subdivisions, pharyngeal arches, neural
retina, otic capsule, and ventral trunk in the region of
developing endoderm derivatives and pronephric duct; it
is now absent from pectoral fins, and shows de novo
expression in developing pharynx, esophagus, swim bladder, and atrium of the heart (Fig. 7A,B). In comparison,
brd2b expression in head is reduced in caudal hindbrain
and otic capsule, and is absent from neural retina, pharyngeal arches, heart, and ventral trunk (Fig. 7G,H). Cross
sections of 60 hour embryos confirm brd2a expression in
brain, epithelial lining of pharyngeal arches, neural retina,
endodermal derivatives, pronephric duct, and lateral line
primordia (Fig. 7C–F). Finally, both paralogs are
expressed exclusively in developing swim bladder and
midbrain in 5 day fish (see additional file 2). Thus, later

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

developmental expression of brd2 paralogs provides evidence for functional divergence between these genes, and
implicates brd2a in patterning and morphogenesis of
brain, eye, ear, pectoral fins and digestive tract and associated organs, before terminal differentiation.
Since both brd2a and brd2b appeared to be maternal transcripts, we examined gene expression in unfertilized
oocytes. We found strikingly different patterns for the two
genes (Fig. 8). brd2a RNA is abundant and dispersed
throughout the oocyte cytoplasm in early stages I and II,
and is sometimes seen within the germinal vesicle (Fig.
8A,E). It starts to accumulate rather unevenly around the
cortical circumference and around the outside of the germinal vesicle in early stage III oocytes; RNA is also present
in surrounding follicle cells (Fig. 8A,C,E;G, arrows inside
and outside oocyte). By late stage III-stage IV,brd2a RNA
is mainly limited to two thin domains on either side of the
vitelline membrane: one, at the cortical circumference of
the oocyte, the other, in the surrounding follicle cells (Fig.
8I, arrows inside and outside oocyte). Like brd2a, brd2b
RNA is at first dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of stage
I and II oocytes, and sometimes seen enriched within the
germinal vesicle (Fig. 8B,F). It also accumulates near the
cortical circumference and outside the germinal vesicle in
early stage III (Fig. 8F). Later in stage III, however, brd2b
RNA becomes strictly localized within the cortical region
around the micropyle, a specialized follicle cell that marks
the future animal pole (Fig. 8D;E,J, arrows). Thus, both
brd2 paralogs are implicated as vertebrate maternal effect
genes, with potential roles in egg polarity and egg to
embryo transition; in addition, their strikingly different
localization patterns again support divergence in function.

Discussion
Brd2 structure and evolution
We describe two sets of brd2 paralogous sequences in
zebrafish, located on chromosomes 19 and 16, and
present evidence for their structural and expression divergence. Syntenic relationships between these genes and
their homologs support our phylogenetic analysis. The
two genomic clones from which zf626 and zf619 strainspecific cDNAs derive map within the zebrafish MHC
class I core locus on chromosome 19, which exhibits conserved synteny with the MHC region on human chromosome 6 containing brd2 [36], verifying zf626 and zf619 as
true brd2 orthologs (Fig. 9, compare Hs chr 6 with Dr chr
19 and Dr chr 19/AB). Interestingly, differences in gene
content outside two syntenic blocks (psmb8-rxrb, and flot1tpsn) on chromosome 19, between Tubingen (Dr chr 19)
and AB (Dr chr 19/AB) zebrafish strains, provide evidence
for recent rearrangement, associating blocks with either
mhcI uba or mhcI uda/ufa/uea genes, respectively (Fig. 9,
non-italic genes). Similarly, a recent intrachromosomal

for brd2 (I, schematic with real image below; 5–6 somite level) show enriched expression in ventrolateral neural rod (nr), floorplate above notochord (nc), and ventral somites (s). Expression is most prominent in head region of 18 somite embyros for
both paralogs (F, G; and N, O); only brd2 is also enriched in tail bud (F), while brd2b remains high along the entire ventral trunk
(N) at this stage. By 24 hours, brd2 is prominent in the entire head, with some expression in ventral trunk and post-anal tail
(H), while brd2b is enriched in ventral brain, cerebellum, and ventral trunk, with low level ubiquitous expression (P). Dorsal flat
mounts of 24 hour embryos (J, K) show brd2 expression enriched within caudal tectum (t) at hindbrain-midbrain boundary,
within specific cells of the cerebellum (cb) and at the caudal border between cerebellum and rest of hindbrain. The image in (K)
is a higher magnification view of a region from another embryo equivalent to the boxed region in J. Expression of brd2 in cells
of otic vesicle walls (ov) is apparent both in flat mounts (J) and cross sections at that level (L). Bar = 250 μm for A-H, J, M-P; =

duplication of MHC I core region in salmonids has
resulted in shuffling of mhcI genes flanking psmb-rsrb
blocks in trout [29]. In fact, the history of MHC loci across
vertebrate species is one of frequent rearrangement, presumably due in part to a preponderance of retrotransposons [37]; nevertheless, these same gene blocks retain
conserved synteny in fish and mammals [30,38]. As brd2a
resides in such a block (Fig. 9, psmb8-rxrb), its conserved
position within the MHC is likely functionally significant
(see below). zf69 and related transcripts from the brd2b
locus on chromosome 16 group phylogenetically with
brd2L from Onchorynchus chromosome 2. As expected,
zebrafish chromosome 16 and trout chromosome 2 share
synteny with eachother, and both share a number of
MHC-linked genes with zebrafish chromosome 19 and
with human chromosome 6 (Fig. 9, compare Dr chr 16,
Om chr 2, Dr chr 19, Hs chr 6). In fact, the linkage of brd2b
with MHC class II and III genes (tap1, pbx2, notch-L), as
seen in the paralogous loci, is hypothesized to reflect the
ancestral vertebrate MHC configuration, while the linkage
of brd2a with MHC class I core genes on zebrafish chromosome 19 and trout genomic contig [GenBank:
DQ139863] is considered derived – the result of teleostspecific duplication, translocation and/or inversion
events [29].

brd2 paralogs are maternal transcripts with different
patterns of expression in oocytes. Whole mount in situ
hybridizations to RNA in zebrafish ovaries with DIG-labelled
zf626 (A, C, E, G, I) and zf69 (B, D, F, H, J) cloned sequences.
Cross sections through ovaries are shown in E-J. brd2 maternal RNAs are dispersed and abundant in stage I and II
oocytes (A, E), and are sometimes found inside the germinal
vesicle (gv), as in G (see small oocytes at far right). By stage
III,brd2 transcripts accumulate around the outside of the germinal vesicle and rather unevenly around the periphery of
the cortex just inside the vitelline envelope (C, E; G, arrowheads). brd2 RNAs then localize around the periphery of the
cortex by late stage III, early stage IV (I, arrowheads). brd2
RNAs are also present in follicle cells of stage III/IV oocytes
(C; G, I, arrowheads outside oocyte). Although brd2b maternal transcripts are also dispersed throughout stage I and II
oocytes, and often found inside the germinal vesicle (B, F, H,
J), in contrast to brd2, they become strictly localized to the
region surrounding the micropyle (D, mp; H, J, arrowheads),
the future animal pole, sometime during stage III, and are not
expressed in follicle cells. A,B: 40X; C-F: 80X; G-J, 100X.

brd2 paralogs in zebrafish show potential for domainshuffling at the identical phase 0 exon junction, suggesting that gene duplication is not merely redundant, but has
allowed functional diversification of brd2 to occur in
fishes. For instance, brd2b isoform zf69 encodes a single
bromodomain (equivalent to BD1) protein lacking an ET
domain. Since BD1-BD1 homodimers can form and bind
acetylated histone tails [32], zf69P dimers might act as
dominant negative molecules, binding to chromatin as a
cargo-less adaptors. In fact, all chromosome 16 isoforms
encode a canonical BD1, but only one also encodes a
canonical BD2; three have no BD2 and one has a degenerate BD2. This suggests a scenario whereby BD1
homodimerization could bring together various combinations of Brd2b isoforms, with and without BD2, ET or
terminal extensions. In addition, Brd2b proteins may
show differences in ligand selectivity compared with
Brd2a, due to paralog-specific amino acid substitutions in
the variable ZA loop of BD1 [3]. Thus, the Brd2b group
possibly reads different acetyl-lysine signals of the histone
code [3], and/or targets different promoters, in addition
to being expressed differentially, compared to Brd2a.
Cross species comparison shows the C-terminal third of
ET to be the least conserved domain in the Brd2 subfamily, suggesting that varying affinities for interacting
proteins might add to functional diversity. Finally, only
chicken, mouse and human Brd2 have the expected configuration of kinase motifs, and the existence of intrinsic
kinase function is still controversial [1]. Indeed, recent

19/AB), and Onchorynchus chromosome 2 (Om chr 2). Gene order is derived from contig views in Vega (Dr chr 19, Dr chr
19/AB), Ensembl (Dr chr 16, Hs chr 6, NA1181), direct reading of annotated genomic clones (Dr chr 19, BX510994.6; Dr chr
19/AB, AL672176.10), and reference 28 (Om chr 2). Brd2-related genes are shown in bold. Genes that reside on the same
genomic clone are shown in single-spaced groups; genomic clones within the same chromosome that physically overlap are
connected by vertical lines. Related genes or groups of genes between chromosomes that show conserved synteny are also
connected by lines. Human brd2 resides within the MHC II complex on chromosome 6, in a conserved syntenic block between
psmb8 and rxrb genes; zebrafish brd2 is found in the same gene block within the fish MHC I core on chromosome 19, and is the
true ortholog of mammalian brd2. Gene content on chromosome 19 from strains Tubingen and AB differs outside the psmb8rxrb and the flot1-tpsn gene blocks, and may indicate recent genomic rearrangement. The zebrafish brd2b paralogous locus on
chromosome 16 (alias loc 569354, sim brd2) is linked to tap1 sequences and other MHC II and III related genes, as is trout
brd2L on chromosome 2, presumably representing the ancestral vertebrate configuration. sim loc569354 on unmapped scaffold
NA1181 consists of two exons encoding the second bromodomain of brd2b partial cDNA (GenBank: BC055508), and with further genome assembly will likely be shown to derive from the same brd2b locus on chromosome 16.

work indicates recruitment rather than kinase activity is
critical for Brd2 nuclear translocation and transactivation
functions [20]. Contig views at Vega and Ensembl show
the presence of multiple repetitive elements in brd2 loci
across species, especially in fish (see additional file 1). In
fact, the chromosome 16 locus has SINE/LINE elements
in conserved intronic positions, where alternate splicing
may produce multiple brd2b-related isoforms. Possibly,
these sequences allow higher frequencies of rearrangement tending to the modular nature and structural diversity of brd2 paralogs in zebrafish [37]. Cloning and
functional testing of these proposed isoforms and their
interacting partners may provide unique insights into
mechanisms of gene diversification after duplication [39].
brd2 paralog expression and potential function in oocytes
and embryos
We propose that brd2a and brd2b act as maternal effect
genes in vertebrates, with a role in oogenesis and egg to
embryo transition. As in Drosophila, mouse and zebrafish
brd2 RNAs are present in oocytes and early embryos
[8,10,23]; but unlike fsh transcripts, the RNAs show
changing patterns of localization throughout oogenesis
[8], suggesting vertebrate brd2 may act by different proximal mechanisms. Mouse and zebrafish brd2a, but not
zebrafish brd2b or Drosophila fsh, are also expressed in surrounding follicle cells [8,10,18], reflecting perhaps a
novel vertebrate function in somatic ovary for brd2a. Location of both mouse and zebrafish RNAs changes from diffuse cellular in early oocytes to nuclear exclusion in
mature oocytes; in mouse, this final shift is correlated with
the ability of oocytes to re-enter meiosis [8]. Unique to
zebrafish, cytoplasmic RNAs from both brd2 paralogs
become further localized in stage III oocytes, supporting
involvement in egg polarity. Given that Brd2 acts as a
major histone-directed transcriptional co-regulator and
recruitment scaffold [1,3,5], it may potentially play a role
here in epigenetic reprogramming of the oocyte and/or
activation of the zygotic genome in the egg to embryo
transition [40]. The localization of brd2a and brd2b into
cortical and animal pole classes [41], respectively, could
thus reflect partitioning of related genes into separate and
reciprocal regulatory domains at this critical juncture [40].
In addition, the fact that recruitment and translation of
maternal RNAs needed for zygotic transcriptional activation may be coordinated with cell cycle progression [40],
suggests that the proposed brd2/trx/E2F epigenetic pathway inferred from work on Brd2 in mammals and Drosophila [11,15,17,19,21], might be operative here (see
Introduction).

Expression patterns of brd2 paralogs in zebrafish embryos
support the idea of a brd2/trx/Hox pathway in vertebrate
development. First, brd2 RNAs in zebrafish, and trx, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and Antennapedia (Antp) RNAs in flies,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

show similar profiles: enrichment in the central nervous
system of the later embryo superimposed upon lower
ubiquitous levels [42]. Second, "ladder patterns" of
zebrafish brd2 RNAs appear during somitogenesis and
persist while fine-grained A-P segmental patterns of
motoneurons are being established by differential homeobox expression, and interneuron axons are extending
along longitudinal tracts within the embryonic spinal
cord [34,35]. Consistent with this, brd2a RNA is enriched
in ventrolateral neural keel/rod, where motorneurons and
interneurons originate. Third, our in situ hybridizations
also show brd2a expression appearing in order in
zebrafish gut and associated organs as they develop along
the A-P axis, with foregut derivatives showing expression
last [43]. Interestingly, both cephalic homeosis and midgut disruptions are seen in Drosophila carrying the fsh
allele rancor, with loss of zygotic function that ordinarily
regulates homeobox genes such as labial and Deformed [44].
In a role analogous to fsh in Drosophila patterning and segment identity [1,10,14,18], zebrafish brd2 paralogs might
regulate homeobox genes via trithorax-related functions in a
canonical pathway for vertebrate central nervous system
and/or gut patterning and morphogenesis [35,43]. Two
recent findings support this idea: first, Drosophila FSH acts
directly at the Ubx promoter and synergistically activates
transcription together with trxG-encoded proteins residing at distal enhancers [45], confirming at the molecular
level
genetic
interactions
observed
previously
[10,14,18,44]; and second, E2F regulator and tumor-suppressor pRB, cooperates with a trithorax gene product, RBbinding protein 2 (RBP2), to activate the Brd2 promoter
in differentiating mammalian cells, suggesting that Brd2dependent maintenance of active chromatin states and/or
modulation of Homeobox gene expression are effectors of
RB-mediated differentiation [16]. Intriguingly, then, brd2/
trx/E2F and brd2/trx/Hox pathways might intersect via
master regulator pRB, a protein known to control cell fate
decisions at the crossroads of death, differentiation and
division [46]. For instance, brd2/trx/E2F might facilitate
cell cycle progression in the absence, and brd2/trx/Hox
promote differentiation in the presence, of active RB [16].
Apropos of this, expression of mouse and zebrafish brd2
in specific precursors and primordia during times of
ongoing morphogenesis and differentiation, followed by
reduction upon terminal differentiation [23], could also
reflect brd2 modulation of cell death and proliferation
[9,19,23,25], which together help shape tissues and
organs during morphogenesis.
The conserved linkage of brd2 in the vertebrate MHC – as
the lone gene not directly involved in antigen presentation [47] – makes some sense in light of the pathways
mentioned above. First, constitutive lymphoid expression
of Brd2 results in B cell lymphoma [20] characterized in
part by transactivation of proliferation-promoting genes,

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:39

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/39

including E2F-regulated cell cycle genes [48]. Second, Hox
gene expression is dynamically modulated in adult
hematopoietic lineages, where differentiation is ongoing,
and Hox gene dysregulation underlies various malignant
leukemias, including those associated with genetic rearrangements of trithorax homolog MLL [49]. Thus, the
brd2/trx epigenetic axis could be pivotal to maintenance of
appropriate expression states of both Hox and cell cycle
genes throughout hematopoiesis, and thus to proper
function of the adult immune system [49].

PCR product was cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen), and
verified by sequencing. [32P]-dCTP-radiolabeled probe
from cloned insert was synthesized using Prime It kit
(Stratagene) and used to screen a 15–19 hour zebrafish
(strain AB) embryonic cDNA library in lambda ZAP (gift
of B. Appel, University of Oregon) by standard plaque
hybridization at 42°C in hybridization buffer containing
50% formamide [54]. 25 positive clones and ten independent isolates were obtained after 3 rounds of rescreening.

Finally, gene expression patterns implicate both mouse
and zebrafish brd2 in continued development of brain.
Consistent with this, structural defects in various brain
regions in JME patients suggest an underlying abnormal
neural network [50,51], with differences in Brd2 expression during development suspected factors due to promoter SNPs that correlate with disease [26]. Whether
misregulation of Brd2 results in inappropriate mitosis or
cell death, or in deregulation of homeobox genes, is
unknown. The function of Brd2 during development and
its connection with JME can now be analyzed by gene
knockdown and ectopic expression studies in zebrafish,
which is an important model for human epilepsy [52]

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of cDNA clones
Both strands of cloned cDNA were sequenced by cycle
sequencing as per company protocol (PE Biosystems)
using an ABI 373A automated sequencer. Open reading
frames were analyzed using DNA Strider 1.3 [55], predicted protein features, using bioinformatics tools at
ExPasy [56], and similarities to known genes, using
blastn, blastx and blastp programs on databases at NCBI
[57], Vega version 24 [58], and Ensembl release 44 [59],
and on databases from genome projects of individual species including Oryzias [60], Tetraodon [61], and Takifugu
[62]. Sequence comparisons and initial alignments
among brd2 clones and homologs were performed using
ClustalW [63] and MegAlign [64]. Phylogenetic trees were
created by first aligning amino acid sequences using ClustalW and adjusting alignments by hand in MacClade [65],
followed by analysis of corresponding nucleotide
sequences using PAUP*4.0 [66]. Trees were created using
Bayesian analysis with posterior probabilities [67], and
reiterated 1000 times to obtain parsimony bootstrap values. Syntenic regions on zebrafish chromosomes 19, 16
and 9 and human chromosome 6 were derived from contig views using Vega, NCBI and Ensembl platforms, or
directly from NCBI and Vega annotated genomic clones.
Map positions of cloned zf626, zf619, and zf69 cDNAs
were obtained by sending 3' UTR sequences to the
zebrafish radiation hybrid mapping service at the Zon lab
Genomics site [68].

Conclusion
Zebrafish brd2 gene paralogs shows potential for functional diversity based on differences in structural domain
configurations and distinct RNA expression patterns in
oocytes and developing embryos. The developmental
expression pattern of zebrafish brd2 corroborates findings
from studies in fly, mouse and human, and provides new
evidence for brd2 function as a maternal effect and zygotic
gene in vertebrates, with potential roles in oogenesis, egg
to embryo transition, and proper development of the
digestive and central nervous systems. Brd2 paralogs provide unique opportunities for distinguishing the roles of
maternal and zygotic genomes in constructing the vertebrate embryo, for investigating interactions with important developmental regulators, and for analyzing the
extent to which divergence after gene duplication consists
in functional novelty or functional partitioning.

Methods
Cloning of zebrafish brd2-related cDNAs
Gene-specific primers were designed from a 330 base partial clone of zebrafish Ring3 [GenBank: AF032385] [28]
and used to amplify a probe from the brd2 gene using
zebrafish genomic DNA as template (5' primer: ATTATTACCGCAGTGCCAGC; 3' primer: TTGTTTTCCTCTGGGGACAG). Genomic DNA was isolated from adult
zebrafish by standard protocol [53]. PCR was conducted
using 1 μg genomic DNA, 0.5 μg of each primer, 0.2 mM
dNTPs, and 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Promega), for 30
cycles: 92°C for 1.5 min, 40°C for 1 min, 70°C for 1 min.

Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted from zebrafish adults, dissected
testis and ovaries, and embryos at various time points post
fertilization (0–2 h, 4–6 h, 8–10 h, 16–18 h, 24 h, 48 h,
and 72 h p.f.), using TriReagent according to manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Products). 2 μg of
each sample was fractionated in 1% agarose, 0.66 M formaldehyde gels in 1× MOPS and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond) in 10× SSPE buffer. Gene-specific probes
were generated from gel-purified (GeneClean kit II, Bio
101) subfragments unique to each cDNA, that excluded
highly conserved or repetitive regions. A PCR-generated
fragment (base 631-base 1231 of clone zf626) from the
region between bromodomains was subcloned into
pGemT (Promega) for brd2a-specific probes; an EcoR1

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:39

fragment containing the first 862 base pairs of clone zf69,
that excludes SINE/LINE family repetitive sequences, was
subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) for brd2b-specific
probes. Hybridizations in buffer (0.5 M phosphate, pH 7,
7% SDS, 1% BSA, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8) containing 1 × 106
cpm/ml of [32P]-dCTP-labeled insert were conducted at
55°C overnight. Filters were washed twice in 2× SSPE/2%
SDS at room temperature, and twice in 0.2× SSPE/0.2%
SDS at 55°C, before being exposed to Xray film.
In situ hybridization to mRNA in embryos and ovaries
In situ hybridizations to RNA in whole mount zebrafish
embryos were conducted according to the Schulte-Merker
protocol as found in the Zebrafish Book [53], with slight
modification. Acetic anhydride and proteinase K treatment were used on older embryos only (>18 hpf). Digoxigenin (DIG) labeled RNA probes were prepared
according to Roche Biochemical instructions, and used
directly in hybridizations without prior hydrolysis.
Hybridizations were conducted with 1 ng/ml probe in
50% formamide buffer with 5 mg/ml torula yeast (type
VI, Sigma), and without heparin, at 65°C overnight. Posthybridization washes (50% formamide, 2× SSCT; 2×
SSCT; 0.2× SSCT) were carried out at 55°C, without RNase
treatment. Embryos were blocked in PBST plus 10% FBS,
0.1% Tween-20, and 1% DMSO for 4 hours before antiDIG detection in staining buffer plus levamisol. After
detection, embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, then dehydrated and stored in methanol at 20°C. For photography, embryos were cleared in 2 parts
benzylbenzoate: 1 part benzylalcohol and mounted in
Canada balsalm. For in situ to ovaries, the high resolution
whole-mount protocol of Thisse as described in The
Zebrafish Book [53], was followed exactly.
