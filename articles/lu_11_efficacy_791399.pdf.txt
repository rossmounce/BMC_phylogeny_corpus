Efficacy and Safety of Prophylactic Vaccines
against Cervical HPV Infection and Diseases
among Women: A Systematic Review & MetaAnalysis
Beibei Lu1, Ambuj Kumar2, Xavier Castellsagué3, Anna R Giuliano1*

Abstract
Background: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of prophylactic
HPV vaccines against cervical cancer precursor events in women.
Methods: Randomized-controlled trials of HPV vaccines were identified from MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials, conference abstracts and references of identified studies, and assessed by two independent
reviewers. Efficacy data were synthesized using fixed-effect models, and evaluated for heterogeneity using I2
statistic.
Results: Seven unique trials enrolling 44,142 females were included. The fixed-effect Relative Risk (RR) and 95%
confidence intervals were 0.04 (0.01-0.11) and 0.10 (0.03-0.38) for HPV-16 and HPV 18-related CIN2+ in the perprotocol populations (PPP). The corresponding RR was 0.47 (0.36-0.61) and 0.16 (0.08-0.34) in the intention-to-treat
populations (ITT). Efficacy against CIN1+ was similar in scale in favor of vaccine. Overall vaccines were highly
efficacious against 6-month persistent infection with HPV 16 and 18, both in the PPP cohort (RR: 0.06 [0.04-0.09]
and 0.05 [0.03-0.09], respectively), and the ITT cohorts (RR: 0.15 [0.10-0.23] and 0.24 [0.14-0.42], respectively). There
was limited prophylactic effect against CIN2+ and 6-month persistent infections associated with non-vaccine
oncogenic HPV types. The risk of serious adverse events (RR: 1.00, 0.91-1.09) or vaccine-related serious adverse
events (RR: 1.82; 0.79-4.20) did not differ significantly between vaccine and control groups. Data on abnormal
pregnancy outcomes were underreported.
Conclusions: Prophylactic HPV vaccines are safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious in preventing persistent
infections and cervical diseases associated with vaccine-HPV types among young females. However, long-term
efficacy and safety needs to be addressed in future trials.

Background
Oncogenic HPV infection is the necessary cause of cervical cancer [1]. Worldwide 70% of invasive cervical cancer cases are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
16 or 18, with HPV 16 being the most common type,
detected in 55% of cases, followed by HPV 18, in 15% of
cases [2]. Other oncogenic HPV types including 31, 33,
35, 45, 52 and 58 that are phylogenetically related to

HPV 16 and 18 account for an additional 18% of all
cases. Results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
of prophylactic HPV vaccines have shown consistently
high efficacy in preventing infection and subsequent
precancerous cervical lesions associated with vaccinetype oncogenic HPV (HPV 16 and 18) as well as phylogenetically-related oncogenic HPV types. However, due
to variability in populations studied, vaccine composition, and efficacy populations defined in different analyses, understanding the published results can prove to
be challenging. There is also a need in public at large,
including families of targeted women and health care

providers, to seek information to support their vaccine
decisions.
Two meta-analyses have been published evaluating prophylactic L1 VLP-based HPV vaccine efficacy and safety
[3,4]. Few reports have also presented similar data from
individual RCTs [5,6]. However, these studies had limitations in addressing multiple clinical endpoints assessed in
RCTs [3], and different virus-like-particle (VLP) compositions of individual vaccines [4]. In addition, since the publication of the aforementioned meta-analyses [3,4], newer
RCTs with reports on cross-protection have been published. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive
assessment of vaccine safety and efficacy against multiple
virological and clinical endpoints using the techniques of
systematic review and meta-analysis.

associated with substantial health care cost in developed
countries. Efficacy estimates for CIN 1 or worse (CIN1+)
can provide insight for potential impact of vaccination on
health care cost. CIN1+ was hence also evaluated as the
secondary endpoint. In addition, we examined occurrence of adverse events (AE) and vaccine-related adverse
events for assessment of vaccine safety.
Data Extraction

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers (BL
and AK) using a standardized data extraction form. Any
discrepancies were resolved by consensus or in consultation with a third reviewer. We extracted detailed information on trial design, inclusion/exclusion criteria,
participant characteristics, vaccine and placebo administered, trial endpoints, efficacy populations, and methodological quality from all included trials.

Identification and Eligibility of Relevant Studies

A systematic search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was
conducted to identify reports of RCTs of prophylactic
HPV vaccines published up to July 31st, 2009, using a
combination of index terms: “Human Papillomavirus”,
“Papillomavirus vaccines”, “Randomized controlled
trials”, and “Controlled clinical trials”. Additional relevant studies were sought through hand search of conference abstract books from IPVS (International
Papillomavirus Society) from 2006 to 2009, and bibliographies of obtained studies.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

RCTs published in English of L1 VLP-based HPV vaccines that were conducted among women and presented
measurement of prophylactic efficacy against HPV infection or diseases of interest were included. Trials reporting male vaccination or therapeutic vaccination were
excluded. Additionally, we excluded ad hoc subgroup
analyses of existing RCTs or combined analyses of multiple RCTs. In the case a RCT reported both interim
and final analyses, data from final analyses with complete follow-up were used.
Outcomes

High-grade cervical lesions or worse (CIN2+), including
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) grade 2-3, Adenocarcinoma in Situ (AIS), and cervical carcinoma, was
the recommended endpoint for establishing efficacy of
prophylactic HPV vaccines by WHO and consistently
reported in most trials. It was, therefore, chosen as the
primary endpoint for efficacy in this review. As persistent
HPV infection is an obligate precursor of CIN2-3 and
cervical cancer [7], type-specific persistent infections was
chosen as the secondary endpoint for efficacy. Furthermore, management of cervical dysplasia of any grade is

Statistical Analysis

Effect sizes were summarized as Risk Ratios (RRs) and
associated 95 percent confidence intervals. A RR less
than one suggested vaccine protection against a specific
virological or clinical endpoint. Consistent with definitions used in vaccine RCTs, efficacy was estimated as
[1-RR] and expressed as percentage. Three types of
populations were defined for efficacy analyses: The
intention-to-treat population (ITT), the modified intention-to-treat population (MITT), and the per-protocol
population (PPP). Vaccine efficacy was assessed in ITT
and PPP cohorts respectively. Efficacy estimates from
MITT cohorts were used in the absence of ITT estimates. Vaccine safety was primarily evaluated in ITT
cohorts among women who received at least one injection of vaccine or control and had available follow-up,
except in one trial [8,9]. A fixed effect model was
applied to obtain pooled estimates of vaccine efficacy
and safety. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed
using the Cochrane’s Q and I2 statistics [10]. Sensitivity
analyses according to key methodological quality
domains and study characteristics were planned a priori
to explore possible sources of heterogeneity as well as to
assess the robustness of the observed results. The possibility of publication bias was assessed using the Begg
and Egger funnel plot method [11,12]. The systematic
review was performed according to the standards
recommended by Cochrane Collaboration [13]. All analyses were performed in RevMan statistical software [14]
following the PRISMA guidelines [15].

vaccine [17]. Participants were tested for DNA evidence
of HPV infection every 6 months and for cytological
abnormality every 6 or 12 months. The length of trials
ranged from 26 to 60 months.
The mean age of participants for the majority of trials
was approximately 20 years except in the trial of Munoz
and associates where older females were recruited
(mean age 34) (Table 2) [18]. The majority of participants in individual trials had two or fewer lifetime sexual partners and used hormonal contraceptives.
Approximately 90% of participants in each trial had normal cytology at enrollment.
Methodological quality was generally high for included
trials. All trials demonstrated adequate reporting for
allocation concealment, blinding, and drop-outs or lossto-follow-up. Expected efficacy and sample size estimates were presented for each trial with considerations
for dropout or loss-to-follow-up.
The Begg and Egger funnel plot (Additional file 1) for
the primary endpoint, CIN2+ associated with HPV 16/
18 in the ITT cohorts (p = 0.602), indicated no significant publication bias.

conference abstracts, 432 were excluded for reasons elaborated in Figure 1. In total, thirteen publications representing seven unique RCTs met the eligibility criteria
and were included in the current review.
II. Characteristics of Included Trials and Trial Participants

Characteristics of RCTs included in the current review
are summarized in Table 1. Unique trials were identified
by first authors of associated publication(s). The majority of trials were multinational trials. Eligible participants
were non-pregnant women aged 15 to 44 who had 6 or
fewer lifetime sexual partners at enrollment and had no
history of abnormal Pap smears. Three prophylactic vaccines were evaluated in the seven trials: The bivalent
vaccine (containing HPV 16 and 18 VLPs) from GlaxoSmithKline in two trials; the monovalent (containing
HPV 16 VLPs) and quadrivalent vaccine (containing
HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 VLPs) from Merck in one and
four trials, respectively. Uniform to all trials, vaccines or
controls were administered in a three-dose regimen
within a 6-month time frame. Proprietary adjuvant was
used with each type of vaccine to enhance immunogenicity. All trials used placebo as the comparator except for
two in which all or part of the control group received
hepatitis A vaccine [16], or placebo plus hepatitis B

The pooled RR for 4 RCTs enrolling 28,639 participants
was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36-0.61) in ITT cohorts, corresponding to a pooled efficacy of 53% and indicating a
statistically significant benefit with vaccine use. However, there was significant heterogeneity among pooled
studies (Cochrane’s Q, p < 0.001; I2 = 87%).
Comparable efficacy estimates were reported by PPP
cohort of individual trials. The pooled RR for PPP
cohorts (3 RCTs, 22,940 participants) was 0.04 (95% CI:
0.01-0.11), showing a statistically significant reduction of
96% in CIN2+ incidence due to vaccination.
2) CIN2+ associated with HPV 18 (Figure 2B)

Analysis using ITT cohorts showed a statistically significant benefit of vaccination with a pooled RR (3 RCTs,
28,053 participants) of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08-0.34), translating to an 84% protection against HPV 18 associated
CIN2+ for vaccine recipients.
Two of the three trials included in the ITT analyses
provided extractable data for the PPP analyses. The
overall RR for PPP cohorts (2 RCTs, 23,565 participants)
was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.03-0.38), equivalent to a 90% protection against HPV 18 associated CIN2+ for vaccine
recipients compared with control recipients.
3) CIN1+ associated with HPV 16 (Figure 3A)

Vaccines of different compositions demonstrated a statistically significant level of protection against HPV 16associated CIN 1+ in ITT cohorts. The pooled RR (4
RCTs, 21,891 participants) was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.33-0.58)
corresponding to a 57% reduction in CIN1+ incidence

Figure 6 Cross-protection against persistent infection of ≥ 6-months with HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58

When cross-protection against 6-month persistent
infection was examined by HPV type (Figure 6A-E),
prophylactic vaccines were most efficacious in preventing persistent HPV 31 infection (RR: ITT 0.47 and PPP
0.30), followed by persistent infection with HPV 45
(RR: ITT 0.50 and PPP 0.42) and HPV 33 (RR: ITT
0.65 and PPP 0.57). No statistically significant crossprotection against persistent infection with HPV 52 or
58 was detected in individual trials or overall. Significant heterogeneity between included trials was
observed in both ITT and PPP analyses of vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV 45 infections (ITT:

Cochrane’s Q, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 94%; PPP: Cochrane’s
Q, p < 0.0003, I2 = 93%).
IV. Assessment of Adverse Events (Figure 7)

Adverse events (AEs) were monitored by the use of daily
vaccination report cards within 15 or 30 days of injection, as well as solicitation throughout the study. Occurrence of AEs was reported in all RCTs. Pain at injection
site was the most frequently reported AE ranging from
83.0 - 93.4% in vaccine groups and 75.4 - 87.2% in control
groups. Headache and fatigue were the most common vaccine-related systemic AEs observed in approximately

50-60% of all participants. Serious AE reported included
abnormal pregnancy outcomes, blood and lymphatic
system disorder, hepatobiliary disorder, immune system
disorder, cardiac and vascular disorder, gastrointestinal
disorder, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder,
nervous system disorder, psychiatric disorder, renal
and urinary disorder, reproductive system and breast
disorder, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorder,
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder, neoplasm, infection
and infestation, injury, poisoning and procedural

complications. The most commonly reported serious AEs
were abnormal pregnancy outcomes such as abnormal
infant and spontaneous abortion. The pooled RR for participants experiencing one or more serious AEs was 1.00
(95% CI: 0.91-1.09) suggesting a statistically insignificant
difference in the risk of serious AEs between vaccine and
control groups (Figure 7A).
Serious AEs that were judged to be related to injection
included bronchospasm, gastroenteritis, headache,
hypertension, injection-site pain, decrease in joint move-

ment at injection site, hypersensitivity to injection, chills,
headache and fever. Four of the seven trials reported
zero injection-related serious AEs (Figure 7B). Among
those reporting vaccine-related serious AEs, the event
rate ranged from 0-0.1%. Overall there was no statistically significant difference in the risk for vaccine-related
serious AEs between vaccine and control groups (RR,
1.82; 95% CI: 0.79-4.20).
V. Sensitivity Analyses (Additional file 2)

Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify potential
sources of heterogeneity that was observed in the ITT
analyses of CIN1+ and CIN2+ associated HPV 16. The
included trials did not differ by methodological qualities
in terms of allocation concealment, blinding, effect size,
power calculation, and participant withdraw and dropout. Therefore, heterogeneity was unlikely attributed to
the methodological quality. We further examined the
heterogeneity among included trials according to study
characteristics including study population, inclusion/
exclusion criteria, intervention, comparator, endpoints
chosen and efficacy populations defined, as well as participant baseline characteristics such as age, HPV prevalence and lifetime number of sex partners. The pooled
efficacy estimates for FUTURE trials were significantly
lower than those for all other RCTs (CIN2+: FUTURE II
0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.78 vs. Other RCTs 0.11, 95% CI:
0.05-0.23; CIN1+: FUTURE I 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40-0.75 vs.
Other RCTs 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07-0.29). With the FUTURE
trials excluded, the observed heterogeneity dissipated for
either endpoint (CIN2+: I2 = 59%, p = 0.09; CIN1+; I2 =
0%, p = 0.70). The previously observed heterogeneity and
lower efficacy reported by the FUTURE trials was likely
due to inclusion of a larger proportion of trial participants already infected with vaccine HPV types at baseline
in the ITT cohorts, some of whom may have progressed
to cervical neoplasia during the follow-up period.

Discussion
In summary, the totality of evidence derived from this
meta-analysis demonstrated that prophylactic vaccines
are highly efficacious in preventing vaccine type HPV
infections and associated precancerous cervical lesions.
Efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infections was
most impressive, offering 95% efficacy for PPP and 7585% for ITT cohorts. Vaccines were equally efficacious
in preventing HPV 16 and 18 associated CIN1+ with an
efficacy of 57-78% for ITT and 97-98% for PPP cohorts.
Efficacy was also pronounced for CIN2+ associated with
HPV 16 and 18 with over 90% efficacy for PPP and 50%
for ITT cohorts.
Overall, a notable higher efficacy was observed in PPP
cohorts than in the ITT or MITT cohorts. The discrepancies are likely attributable to differences in the

Page 13 of 16

populations evaluated and case counting methods
adopted for different types of efficacy analyses. The ITT
cohort typically included women who had received ≥1
dose of vaccine or placebo, and had available follow-up
data regardless of HPV status at enrollment. A MITT
cohort required participants to be virologically and serologically naïve to vaccine HPV types at enrollment, in
addition to the requirements set for ITT. In some cases,
a normal cytology at enrollment and DNA negativity to
other oncogenic HPV types at enrollment were also
required. The PPP cohort was, in comparison, more
restricted and only included women who received all
three doses of vaccine or placebo, were naïve (DNAand sero-negative) to vaccine HPV types at enrollment
and remained DNA-negative through the regimen with
no protocol violation. In addition, case counting for ITT
or MITT analyses usually started on day 1, instead of
one month post dose three in most PPP analyses. The
excessive cases observed in ITT cohorts compared with
those in PPP cohorts were likely the results of incomplete vaccine regimen and the inclusion of prevalent
cases of HPV infection and low-grade cervical diseases
at enrollment.
The ITT cohort in the vaccine trials mimics young
women in the general population who may have been
exposed to vaccine type HPV infection and have less
than perfect compliance with vaccination protocol,
whereas PPP cohorts approximates pre-sexually active
young adolescents naïve to vaccine type HPV with perfect or nearly perfect compliance. The young adolescent
group becomes susceptible soon after their initiation of
sexual activities, even if they are not engaged in penetrative sexual intercourse [19,20]. The notable difference in
prophylactic efficacy against infection and cervical diseases between the ITT and PPP cohorts of young
females and the lack of therapeutic efficacy [21] highlight the public health importance of early vaccination
of adolescent girls prior to their sexual debut and vaccine compliance.
While sexually naïve young women may derive
greater public health benefit from HPV vaccination,
vaccine appears to be of benefit to a broad age range
of women many of whom may have acquired transient
infections in the past or had active infection at the
time of vaccination. Preliminary data from the quadrivalent vaccine trial of Muñoz and associates [18]
enrolling 3819 24-45 year old women showed a 90%
efficacy against combined incidence of vaccine HPVrelated 6-month persistent infection, CIN 1-3 or external genital warts in PPP cohorts and a 31% efficacy in
the ITT cohort. Recent studies further demonstrated
that even among women who had detectable serological evidence of vaccine-HPV infection in the past and
no DNA evidence of active infection at enrollment,

Lu et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/13

prophylactic vaccination provides nearly 100 percent
protection (95% CI: <0-100) against CIN2+ associated
with a vaccine HPV type with which the women had
been previously infected [22]. These data suggest that
older reproductive-age women can still benefit from
prophylactic vaccination.
Whether prophylactic vaccines offer long-term protection remains an important unanswered question. Two
included trials offered an extended follow-up of 53
months and 60 months [9,23] and both reported high
sustained efficacy against vaccine HPV infection and
associated cervical diseases for the extended follow-up
phase. The longest follow-up available to date is 8.5
years for the monovalent vaccine trial [24]. The trial
reports an efficacy against HPV 16-related CIN2+ of
64% (95% CI: -51-94) for ITT and 100% (95% CI: 29100) for PPP in the extended follow-up phase among a
subset (n = 280) of participants enrolled for the initial
trial, comparable with the efficacy of 78% (95% CI: 4193) for ITT and 100% (95% CI: 65-100) for PPP
reported in the initial trial. Future efficacy data from
longer-term follow-up of bivalent and quadrivalent vaccine trials are critical to fully address long-term efficacy.
Our results demonstrated statistically significant but
limited protection against CIN2+ associated with nonvaccine-type oncogenic HPV that are phylogenetically
related to HPV 16 and 18 in both ITT and PPP cohorts
(RR: 0.79 in ITT and 0.58 in PPP). Limited cross-protection against persistent infection of ≥6 months was consistently observed for HPV 31, and to a lesser extent
against persistent HPV 45 and HPV 33 infection. No
statistically significant protection was detected against
persistent infection with HPV 52 and 58. The added
benefit of cross-protection may result in further reductions in incidence of cervical cancer and precancerous
lesions following vaccination. However, whether crossprotection remains present in long-term follow-up, and
if present, how the efficacy trend for non-vaccine types
compares with that of vaccine HPV types has yet to be
determined.
Results of the safety assessment indicated that injection-related local and systemic symptoms were generally
mild. The most commonly reported serious AEs were
abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Serious AEs that were
considered to be vaccine-related were rare. It was noted
that data on abnormal pregnancy outcomes were underreported, only available in three of the seven trials
included [16,17,25]. The currently licensed prophylactic
vaccines evaluated in the review were not recommended
by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) for pregnant women, although it was suggested
that abnormal pregnancy outcomes did not differ significantly between vaccine and control group, and were

Page 14 of 16

comparable with those reported in surveillance registries
and the literature in a recent publication that combined
pregnancy and infant outcomes from five Phase III
RCTs [26]. However, pregnancy testing was not required
before vaccination by ACIP. Given the high frequency of
pregnancy among 15-44 year-old women in the general
population (103.2 per 1,000 women) [27] as well as in
vaccine trial participants (~20%) [16,26], further data on
pregnancy outcomes, and long-term follow-up of live
births conceived during trial regimen are needed for a
full assessment of vaccine safety and to facilitate women
with an informed vaccine decision.
There are several limitations to the evidence presented
here. We were not able to evaluate prophylactic efficacy
against anogenital warts, vulvar or vaginal diseases associated with vaccine HPV due to the common use of
composite endpoints in individual RCTs that combined
infections, lesions and cancers of various anogenital
sites, and were often incomparable across RCTs
[17,18,23]. In addition, we did not evaluate HPV 6 or
11-specific efficacy given that VLP components of HPV
6 and 11 were only included in the quadrivalent vaccine
from Merck. Furthermore, we recognize that the pooled
efficacy results presented here were derived from susceptible young females with limited sexual exposure to
HPV, therefore, they may not be applicable to more
mature, sexually active female populations. Lastly, due
to the limited number of published trials available to
date, we were not able to assess efficacy pertaining to
each type of vaccine.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our review demonstrated that VLP-based
prophylactic HPV vaccines are highly efficacious in preventing persistent infection and cervical diseases associated with vaccine HPV types among young female
adults. The vaccines were safe and generally well tolerated. Vaccination of adolescent girls prior to sexual
debut appeared to be the most effective public health
measure for prevention of cervical diseases and cancer.
Questions related to long-term efficacy and safety have
yet to be addressed.
