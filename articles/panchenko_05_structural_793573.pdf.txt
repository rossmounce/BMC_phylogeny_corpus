Abstract
Background: Protein evolution and protein classification are usually inferred by comparing
protein cores in their conserved aligned parts. Structurally aligned protein regions are separated
by less conserved loop regions, where sequence and structure locally deviate from each other and
do not superimpose well.
Results: Our results indicate that even longer protein loops can not be viewed as "random coils"
and for the majority of protein families in our test set there exists a linear correlation between the
measures of sequence similarity and loop structural similarity. Results suggest that distance
matrices derived from the loop (dis)similarity measure may produce in some cases more reliable
cluster trees compared to the distance matrices based on the conventional measures of sequence
and structural (dis)similarity.
Conclusions: We show that by considering "dissimilar" loop regions rather than only conserved
core regions it is possible to improve our understanding of protein evolution.

Background
Globular proteins are considered to be structurally similar
if their regular secondary structure elements can be superimposed well and are connected in the same order. The
loop regions connecting secondary structures demonstrate less regularity in their conformations even though
short loops linking specific secondary structures can be
classified into distinct classes [1-6]. The structures and
sequences in loop regions may deviate from each other so
that they do not superimpose well and as a result loops are
very often not aligned by structure-structure or sequence
alignment methods. Loops apparently do not contribute
much to protein stability but may be quite important for
protein specific function and for the interaction with
other components of the cell. In our previous work we
showed that a measure derived from the loop regions can

distinguish homologous from analogous proteins with
the same or higher accuracy compared to the conventional measures which are based on comparing proteins
in structurally aligned regions only [7].
Recently it has been observed that structural variation in
the core of homologous proteins is linearly correlated
with sequence changes [8,9]. As was also shown several
years ago, the probability of insertion and deletion events,
which occur predominantly in the loop regions, strongly
depends on the evolutionary distance between two
homologous proteins [10,11]. Based on these observations one might argue that more closely related proteins
may exhibit more similarity in the structure of their loop
regions compared to distantly related proteins and the

structural loop (dis)similarity should correlate with evolutionary distance.

- at least one structure in a pair contained more than 25%
of its nonaligned loops with missing residues.

To check this hypothesis we performed an analysis of
structural variation in the loop regions within different
homologous protein families using a recently introduced
new measure of loop similarity [7]. This new measure is
based on the concept of the Hausdorff metric, which is
used in mathematical topology to define a distance
between two point sets of a metric space. It does not
require an alignment or one to one correspondence
between two point sets. We show that there exists a linear
correlation between the average structural change in the
loop regions and the evolutionary distance, which allows
us to use the loop (dis)similarity measure for inferring the
phylogenetic history of homologous protein families.

To ensure that protein families span a wide range of
sequence similarity, all families were examined and those
having less than 30% sequence identity span were not
considered in further analysis. The redundancy between
protein families was checked by using the procedure
implemented in the CDART algorithm [17] and not more
than 2 protein families from the same CDD cluster were
retained in the final test set. At the end, the test set comprised 59 CDD families with more than 10 structurally
aligned pairs of homologs. This test set covered a wide
range of functional and structural classes and the list of
test families together with their length, number of protein
pairs and correlation coefficients is shown in Table 1.

Methods

Measures of structural and sequence similarity
To measure the sequence similarity between homologous
proteins from the same family we used a Blast bitscore
normalized by the alignment length. Among structure
similarity measures used in this paper, two of them,
RMSD and alignment-based Hausdorff measure (AHM)
were computed by comparing the proteins in structurally
aligned regions, while the loop-based Hausdorff measure
(LHM) quantified the difference in the loop regions.

Test set
To select sets of homologous proteins the Conserved
Domain Database (CDD) version 1.62 was taken, which
can be accessed at [12]. The CDD collection of protein
domain alignments included curated CDDs [13] and preprocessed domain families imported from SMART and
PFAM, altogether 6222 protein domain families[14].
Upon import, the sequences from SMART/PFAM alignments with more than 75% identity with known structures were substituted by the most similar structures from
the Protein Data Bank [15].

Each CDD family was decomposed into a set of pairwise
structure-structure alignments. Structural alignments were
computed by the VAST algorithm [16] and only those
structures which had more than 80% mutual overlap
between the VAST alignment footprint and CDD footprint
were considered in the analysis. The footprint for a given
sequence was defined as a region between the first and the
last residues aligned by VAST or CDD. Those families containing short sequence repeats and having average alignment length less than 50 residues were excluded from the
test set. The structural pairs within the remaining CDD
families were disregarded if at least one of the following
conditions held true:
- at least one structure in a pair had X-ray resolution of
greater than 3.0 Å
- the Blast E-value calculated for the VAST alignment
exceeded 0.01
- at least one structure in a pair contained a chain discontinuous domain inconsistently aligned between VAST and
CDD
The "loop" was defined as a region between two consecu-

The root mean squared deviation (RMSD) was calculated
using the superposition algorithm due to McLachlan [18].
The AHM and LHM measures were based on the mathematical concept of Hausdorff distance[19]. Let A = {a1,...,
am} and B = {b1,..., bn} be finite point sets in a Euclidean
space. The Hausdorff distance between the sets A and B is
then defined by:
dH (A, B) = max {min j d(a1, bj),..., min j d(am, bj), min i d(ai,
b1),..., min i d(ai, bn)} (1)
Here the terms d(ai, bj) denote the usual Euclidean distance between the points. In other words, the Hausdorff
distance between the sets A and B is the smallest distance
such that every point ai ∈ A is within this distance of some
point bj ∈ B and vice versa. Hausdorff distance can be calculated under the assumption that the Cα atoms for both
structures are in a common coordinate frame which is
defined by the structural alignment between two
domains. The Hausdorff measure for loops (LHM) was
calculated as an average of Hausdorff distances over all
loops in the protein pair, where ns is the number of
aligned secondary structure elements:

hi = 0, if the i-th loop regions do not have any unaligned
residues;
hi = dH (Ai, Bi), where Ai contains the set of Cα coordinates
of non-aligned residues in the i-th loop of the first structure in a pair, the last aligned residue from the preceding
aligned region and the first aligned residue from the following aligned region. Similarly, Bi is defined for the second structure in a pair. The sets (Ai, Bi) are defined to
include two aligned residues so that the measure can be
defined even if one of the sets of non-aligned residues is
empty. The Hausdorff measure for the structurally aligned
regions (AHM) was defined similarly. In this case, instead
of the sets that contain the coordinates for the Cα atoms
in the loops, we use the coordinates for the Cα atoms in
the aligned segments and average over the number of
aligned segments.
The correlation analysis between the measures of
sequence and structural similarity, linear/nonlinear
regression analyses and cluster analysis were performed
using Splus version 6. Pearson (ρ) and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the accuracy
of linear correlation. The P-value under the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient between two variables is
equal to zero has been estimated and those families with
the P-values less than 0.01 were considered as having statistically significant correlation. The cluster analysis was
done using the complete linkage clustering [20] where the
distance between two clusters was measured as a maximum distance between a point in one cluster and a point
in another cluster. The cluster trees based on p-distance
and LHM were compared using the Phylip program [21]
by generating 1000 bootstrap alignments from the structural alignments of a protein family and by calculating pdistance based cluster trees from the bootstrap alignments. The bootstrap support for the LHM based tree or
different partitions of this tree was calculated by counting
how many times the LHM topology occurs among the
bootstrap cluster trees.

Results and discussion
Tables 1 and 2 show the accuracy of correlation obtained
between the various measures of structural similarity
(RMSD, AHM and LHM). As can be seen from these
tables, the correlation quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient is quite high for most of the families and
half of the families have coefficients between -0.76 and 0.81 depending on the structural similarity measure used
(Spearman rank correlation coefficients were shown to be
very close to those reported in Tables 1 and 2). This result
is consistent with the studies of Wood and Pearson who
showed on a smaller test set of 35 protein families that
half of them have correlation coefficients greater than
0.878 [8]. In their case the sequence-structure correlation
was quantified, however, by using only the measures
based on the structurally aligned regions of the proteins.
The dependence of structural similarity on sequence similarity in some cases can be more accurately described by
the nonlinear regression model taking into account higher
order quadratic terms. To quantify how much the nonlinear terms improve the data fitting, we use the ratio of
squared correlation coefficient for linear ( Rl2 ) and non2
2
linear ( Rn ) models ( r 2 = Rl2 / Rn ). In the overall test set
only 12 families have r2 – ratio smaller than 0.9 (with
LHM used as a structural similarity measure) indicating
that for these cases adding the non-linear term improves
the performance of modeling by about 10%.

As was shown previously, the evolutionary relatedness
between proteins can be successfully gauged from the
comparison of their loop regions [7]. Indeed, Table 2 and
Figure 1 show that within the families of homologous
proteins, the structural changes in loops are strongly coupled with evolutionary distance, which in the first approximation can be estimated using normalized Blast score.
The structural-sequence dependence in loop regions for
71% of our protein families can be well described by a linear model and for 88% of protein families the linear correlation coefficients are found to be statistically

significant. Comparing different measures of structural
similarity one can see that AHM performs somewhat better than other quantities yielding 90% of families with statistically significant linear correlation coefficients (with Pvalue < 0.01) and 80% of families with r2 > 0.9.
However, not all families exhibit such good correlation.
One example of a protein family showing particularly low
LHM correlation is the family of Actin depolymerisation
factor/cofilin-like domains (ADF). The sequence-structure
correlation for loop regions of this family is not statistically significant (the Pearson correlation coefficient is
close to zero) whereas the sequence-structure correlation
for the protein core is very high (ρ = -0.85 with AHM).
Indeed, different proteins of this family show distinctly
different loop conformations and evolutionary analysis of
ADF family argued that the insertions present in the vertebrate ADF/cofilins (and not present in non-vertebrate
cofilins) might be important for nuclear function of mammalian cofilins [22]. Therefore, in this case the structural
heterogeneity of loop regions can be explained by the
acquisition of a new distinct function by some members
of this family. For some families, for example, Trypsin-like
serine protease (Tryp_SPc), neither LHM (ρ = -0.31) nor
AHM (ρ = -0.55) similarity measures exhibit a good
sequence-structure correlation (Figure 1(c)).
Among families with particularly high LHM correlation
are the families of Xylose isomerase (Xylose_isom), Class
I Histocompatibility antigen (domains alpha 1 and 2,
MHC_I), Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPc) and others.
Figure 1 shows two families with high sequence-structure
correlation using the LHM measure: Ig-like plexins (IPT)
and Ribonucleases A (RnaseA). The IPT family is characterized by high sequence-structure correlation for both
core (ρAHM = -0.90) and loop regions (ρLHM = -0.94). On
the other hand, the protein core structure of the RnaseA
family changes very little with sequence whereas the loop
structure gradually diverges as sequence becomes more
and more dissimilar (ρAHM = -0.48, ρLHM = -0.87).

To understand whether significant sequence-structure correlation for loop regions has an underlying biological
meaning, we performed a cluster analysis of proteins from
two diverse families, Ribonuclease A (RnaseA), and SH2
domain (SH2, ρAHM = -0.48, ρLHM = -0.78), using different
measures of sequence and structural similarity. Figure 2
depicts the cluster trees constructed using distance/similarity matrices which were based on the fraction of nonidentical residues (p-distance), RMSD and LHM for these
two families.

The RnaseA family represents a very interesting example
to study as it is characterized by considerably different catalytic efficiency and substrate preferences among family
members and the different aspects of its activity is not well
understood. Although cysteines that form disulfide
bonds, catalytic histidines and lysine residues are mostly
structurally and sequence conserved, there is a great variability in sequence between other regions of RnaseA proteins [23,24]. We compared the obtained cluster trees
(Figure 2) with the maximum-parsimony phylogenetic
tree derived by Rosenberg et al [23], the Phylip format of
this tree is given in the captions of Figure 2. As shown in
this figure, the RMSD-based tree divides pancreatic ribonucleases (PR) into two groups and puts together two very
different proteins: angiogenin (ANG) and Rana ribonuclease (RR) although angiogenin has a very weak enzymatic
activity and is a tumor-growth promoter while Rana ribonuclease P-30 has ribonuclease activity and antitumor
effects. In contrast to the RMSD cluster tree, distance
matrices based on the loop (dis)similarity measure correctly cluster the representatives of the five major groups
of the Ribonuclease family as per Rosenberg et al [23].
Although the topology of the p-distance based cluster tree
is somewhat different from the topology of the LHM
based tree (with bootstrap support less than 0.001), it also
produces a biologically meaningful clustering as judged
from Rosenberg et al [23].

Complete linkage cluster tree produced using fraction of
non-identical residues (p-distance), RMSD (Å), and LHM (Å)
is plotted between proteins from Pancreatic ribonuclease
family (RnaseA). Five major groups of RnaseA family according to Rosenberg et al [23] are: eosinophil ribonucleases
(ER), pancreatic ribonucleases (PR), angiogenins (ANG), Rana
ribonucleases (RR) and ribonuclease 4 (R4). The maximum
parsimony tree described by Rosenberg et al [23] is given in
the Phylip format: (RR, ((ANG, R4), (PR, ER))).

SH2 domains represent phosphor-tyrosyl peptide binding
modules which are found in many signaling proteins. The
specificity of phosphate interaction with a protein has
been attributed to the hydrophobic pocket which is
mostly formed by two loop regions [25]. Our analysis
shows that indeed the loop regions have a much higher
accuracy in clustering of functional subfamilies of SH2
domains. Comparing our cluster trees with the classification of Songyang et al [26] and cluster trees of SH2 phosphotyrosyl binding sites [25] we can see from Figure 3 that
p-distance based and RMSD based distance matrices cluster correctly two representatives of the "1A" subfamily
(vsrc, hck), but separate proteins from subfamily "1B"
(csk, csk, syk) and "4" (shptp2 and shc). In contrast, these
subfamilies ("1B" and "4" [26]) are very well supported
by the cluster tree which is based on the LHM measure.

The bootstrap calculations (see Methods) show that the
LHM based topology is supported by the p-distance based
clustering algorithm at less than the 0.001 level. Different
partitions of this tree are supported at higher but still nonsignificant levels, namely 0.11 for the "1B" subfamily
(csk, csk, syk) and 0.01 for the subfamily "4" (shptp2 and
shc). This in turn indicates that the two cluster trees can be
considered statistically different.

Modeling of insertion and deletion events in evolution
poses a lot of difficulties and protein evolution is usually
reconstructed based only on the aligned regions of proteins. We demonstrated that loop regions which usually
correspond to the non-aligned protein regions can be very
important in inferring the phylogenetic history of a protein family. Moreover, it was shown, that sometimes
sequence and structure similarity measures comparing
proteins in their core are not sensitive enough to detect
subtle (dis)similarities between the subfamilies. Loopbased measures which emphasize the dissimilarities
between different protein members can shed light on the
evolutionary
relationships
between
homologous
proteins.

Here we have presented an analysis of how the structure
of protein loops changes in evolution as homologous proteins diverge from each other. We showed that for the
majority of protein families there exists a statistically significant linear correlation between measures of sequence
similarity and average loop structural similarity. This in
turn suggests that loops change in evolution via a stepwise
insertion or deletion process and clearly one can not portray even longer loop regions as "irregular conformations"
or "random coils". Indeed, our results imply that, in general, loops are under constant evolutionary constraints
which, apparently, are weaker than those for a protein
core but still strong enough to preserve the loop overall
structure. Since loops do not contribute much to the protein core stability, these constraints predominantly arise
from the importance of loops in interacting with ligands,
other proteins and cells, as well as a possible role of loops
in protein folding.
