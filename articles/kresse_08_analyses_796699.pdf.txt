Abstract
The interactions between pathogens and hosts lead to a massive upregulation of antimicrobial host
effector molecules. Among these, the 65 kDa guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are interesting
candidates as intricate components of the host effector molecule repertoire. Members of the GBP
family are highly conserved in vertebrates. Previous reports indicate an antiviral activity of human
GBP1 (hGBP1) and murine GBP2 (mGBP2). We recently demonstrated that distinct murine GBP
(mGBP) family members are highly upregulated upon Toxoplasma gondii infection and localize
around the intracellular protozoa T. gondii. Moreover, we characterised five new mGBP family
members within the murine 65 kDa GBP family. Here, we identified a new mGBP locus named
mGbp11. Based on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), expressed sequence tag (EST), and RTPCR analyses this study provides a detailed insight into the genomic localization and organization
of the mGBPs. These analyses revealed a 166-kb spanning region on chromosome 3 harboring five
transcribed mGBPs (mGbp1, mGbp2, mGbp3, mGbp5, and mGbp7) and one pseudogene
(pseudomGbp1), as well as a 332-kb spanning region on chromosome 5 consisting of six transcribed
mGBPs (mGbp4, mGbp6, mGbp8, mGbp9, mGbp10, and mGbp11), and one pseudogene
(pseudomgbp2). Besides the strikingly high homology of 65% to 98% within the coding sequences,
the mGBPs on chromosome 5 cluster also exhibit a highly homologous exon-intron structure
whereas the mGBP on chromosome 3 reveals a more divergent exon-intron structure. This study
details the comprehensive genomic organization of mGBPs and suggests that a continuously
changing microbial environment has exerted evolutionary pressure on this gene family leading to
multiple gene amplifications. A list of links for this article can be found in the Availability and
requirements section.

Background
The guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) were first
described in 1979 when Gupta et al. identified a 67 kDa
protein induced in human fibroblasts after interferon γ

(IFNγ) stimulation [1]. Some years later, it was shown that
two orthologous proteins are expressed in murine fibroblasts after stimulation with IFNγ [2]. Besides the strong
inducer IFNγ, the GBPs can also be induced by type I inter-

ferons [2-6], tumor-necrosis-factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-1α [7,8], and TLR agonists [5].
Human and murine GBPs possess the unique ability to
bind to agarose-immobilized GMP (guanosine monophosphate), GDP (guanosine diphosphate), and GTP
(guanosine triphosphate) with the same affinity, thereby
differing from heterotrimeric or Ras-like GTP-binding
proteins [2]. In addition, they hydrolyse GTP not only to
GDP but also to GMP [9]. Further biochemical properties
of the GBPs are the low binding affinity to nucleotides,
their stability in the absence of guanine nucleotides and
their high turnover GTPase activity [10]. Remarkably, the
sequence of the common G4-motif N/TKxD is modified
in the GBPs to the unique T(L/V)RD motif [10]. In the
case of hGBP1 a nucleotide-dependent oligomerization
and concentration-dependent GTPase activity has been
observed [11]. These biochemical properties classified the
GBPs as distantly related family members of the dynamin
superfamily despite the lack of any sequence homology of
the primary sequences [11,12]. The similarity to the
dynamin family is further corroborated by the analysis of
the crystal structure of hGBP1. It has an amino-terminal
globular domain containing the GTP binding region and
an elongated carboxy-terminal series of α-helices. The
GBPs possess the common 'dynamin domain structure'
with a GTPase domain (~300 residues), a 'middle' or
'assembly' domain (150–200 residues) and a GTPase
effector domain (~100 residues) [11].
Although, the GBPs have been discovered almost 30 years
ago, only little is known about their biological function. It
has been suggested that the GBPs are important for cell
growth regulation as demonstrated for mGBP2 and
hGBP1 [7,13]. Both, hGBP1 and mGBP2 also alter matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) gene expression and thereby
change cellular interactions with the extracellular environment [14]. In addition, hGBP1 was reported to be
involved with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cell
lines [15]. Further studies revealed that hGBP1 and
mGBP2 exhibit a moderate antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis
virus (EMCV) [16,17]. Recently, we have demonstrated
that mGBPs are highly upregulated in mice after infection
with Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii, and localize around the parasitophorous vacuole of T. gondii, thus
suggesting that the mGBPs play a role in the defense
against intracellular bacteria and apicomplexa [5].
Besides humans and mice the GBPs have been found in
rats [18], chicken [19], fish [20], and several other vertebrate species. In humans seven orthologs and at least one
pseudogene have been identified [21,22]. In mice five
GBPs have been described [2,23,24]. Recently, one additional mGBP was discovered by an in silico study [21]. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/158

search of new IFNγ regulated genes using Affymetrix analyses we independently identified mGbp6, mGbp7, and
mGbp8 [5]. Further comprehensive genome and sequence
analyses yielded two more homologous genes, named
mGbp9 and mGbp10 [5]. The subsequent investigation of
mGBP gene loci revealed an incorrect assembly concerning the mGbp8 locus in the genome databases (Ensembl,
NCBI). Thus, to clarify the genomic organization of
mGBP coding genes, we used BAC and EST sequences
obtained from NCBI. Based on these sequence analyses
we were able to identify another mGBP locus named
mGbp11. In this study, we address the genomic organization and localization of each mGBP family member and
present a revised assembly of the murine GBP homology
clusters on chromosomes 3 and 5.

Results
The mGBP genes are arranged in two clusters located on
chromosomes 3 and 5
Although the first guanylate binding protein had been
described almost 30 years ago further family members
have been discovered lately. A recent in silico study has
proposed a number of six mGBPs and three pseudogenes
[21]. We recently raised the number up to ten mGBP
members [5]. In this study, we performed extensive
homology searches on the whole genome to identify further mGBP loci. Single exons of known mGBPs were used
for homology searches against murine genome databases
using the BlastN algorithm [25]. Thereby, another mGBP
family member was discovered, now designated mGBP11
(Acc. No. EU304258). The mGbp11 locus was confirmed
by BAC analyses. Hence, we extend the family to eleven
mGBPs and two pseudogenes which all cluster on two
chromosomes. One gene cluster is located on chromosome 3 within the H3 region and the second gene cluster
is found within the E5 region on chromosome 5 (Fig. 1A).
For further analysis of these two gene clusters we used
BAC sequences obtained from NCBI. On chromosome 3
the BACs RP23-100J23 and RP24-314I8 cover the respective chromosomal regions between 142.44 MB and
142.60 MB harboring mGbp1, mGbp2, mGbp3, mGbp5,
mGbp7, and a pseudogene named pseudomGbp1 (Fig. 1B).
This gene cluster spans approximately 166 kb. The length
of each gene locus ranges from 3.7 kb (pseudomGbp1) to
34.9 kb (mGbp1). The mGBPs located on chromosome 3
are all transcribed from the positive strand.

Further, we used the BACs RP24-63G23, RP23-329M7
and RP24-210D14 for analyses of the region between
105.25 MB and 105.58 MB on chromosome 5 (Fig. 1C).
By means of these BAC sequences we were able to determine the precise loci for mGbp4, mGbp6 (formerly mpa2l),
mGbp8, mGbp9, mGbp10, mGbp11, and the pseudogene
pseudomGbp2. This cluster has approximately twice the
size of the cluster on chromosome 3 with an extension of

mGBP genes cluster on chromosomes 3 and 5
mGBP genes cluster on chromosomes 3 and 5. A. One mGBP cluster is located within the H3 region on chromosome
3 (142.44 MB to 142.60 MB) and the other within the E5 region on chromosome 5 (105.25 MB to 105.58 MB). Genomic organization of the mGBP genes clustered on chromosome 3 (B) and chromosome 5 (C). Each gene locus is illustrated as a black
rectangle, pseudogenes are shown in grey. The locus of the flanking gene Abcg3 is shaded. The approximate length of each gene
is depicted below the corresponding rectangle. Transcriptional direction is indicated by white arrows. The approximate length
of each cluster is shown at the bottom of the respective figure. The BACs used in this study are stated above the corresponding region of the chromosomes. The scale bar equals a length of 10 kb.

332 kb. The length of each gene locus on chromosome 5
ranges from 23 kb (mGbp6) to 44 kb (pseudomGbp2). In
contrast to the mGBPs located on chromosome 3 the
mGBPs on chromosome 5 are all transcribed from the
negative strand.

Conserved exon-intron structure in the mGBPs
Besides their clustering on two chromosomes, the mGBPs
share a highly similar genomic structure (Fig. 2). All members of the 65 kDa mGBP gene family consist of eleven
exons, except mGbp8 which lacks exon 6. Since exon 6 is
composed of 246 basepairs no frameshift is generated.

Genomic organization of mGBP genes on chromosome 3 (A) and chromosome 5 (B)
Genomic organization of mGBP genes on chromosome 3 (A) and chromosome 5 (B). Translated exons are illustrated in black, 5' untranslated exons in grey and 3' untranslated exons are shaded. The alternative 5' non-coding exons of
mGBP3 (I-a, II, I-b, and III) and mGBP4 (I, II, and III) are numbered separately. The mRNAs for mGBP5 and mGBP5a are differentially spliced transcripts encoded by the same genomic locus. However, since alternative splice acceptor sites in exon 5 are
used and an alternative exon 10a is inserted in the different mRNAs two schematic illustrations are provided. The inversion of
the first two exons of pseudogene pseudomGbp2 is indicated by black arrowheads. The length (bp) of each exon and intron is
specified. The depicted scale bars correspond to the different rulers used for introns, coding or non-coding exons.

The cloning and sequencing of mGBP8 cDNA confirmed
these genomic findings. Interestingly, the translation of all
mGBPs starts within exon 2.

ing to an ORF sequence with only 1329 bp. The amino
acid sequence and the GTP-binding motif are depicted in
additional file 1.

The size of the first non-coding exon of the mGBPs on
chromosome 3 ranges from 65 bp (mGBP1) to 205 bp
(mGBP2) (Fig. 2A). For mGBP3 several alternative 5' UTR
exons were identified. In the database 26 EST and cDNA
sequences which cover the 5' UTR from mGBP3 were
found: seven ESTs contain exon 1-Ia upstream of exon 2,
three sequences harbor exon 1-Ia and 1-Ib in combination, 16 sequences comprise exon 1-II and only one EST
was found having exon 1-III as a 5' non coding exon. For
mGBP7 two different splice sites in the 5' UTR of exon 2
were observed as reported previously [21]. In every mGBP
locus the exons 3 (128 bp), exons 4 (110 bp), exons 5
(197 bp), exons 7 (281 bp), exons 8 (213 bp), exons 9
(103 bp), and exons 10 (194 bp) cover the same size,
except mGBP5 which has an exon 5 with 200 bp instead
of 197 bp and an exon 10 with 182 bp instead of 194 bp.
Moreover, for mGBP5 an alternative splice form,
mGBP5a, which lacks exons 3, exon 4, a part of exon 5,
and possesses an exon 10a, has been described [24].
Exons 6 of mGBP1, mGBP2, and mGBP5 consist of 243
bp whereas exons 6 of the other mGBPs span 246 bp.

In order to elucidate the basal expression and inducibility
of the new mGBP family members RT-PCR analyses were
performed. Therefore, we compared the expression levels
in unstimulated and IFNγ stimulated ANA-1 macrophages
(Fig. 3A). The mGBPs were only detectable upon stimulation, except mGBP9, which was already expressed in
unstimulated cells. Besides IFNγ stimulation, the infection of C57BL/6 mice with L. monocytogenes led to a rapid
upregulation of all tested mGBPs in the liver (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, slight mGBP11 RNA expression was detectable in the liver of uninfected mice.

Interestingly, the mGBPs on chromosome 5 show even
higher similarities concerning the genomic organisation
(Fig. 2B). The first exons of these mGBPs have nearly identical sizes (between 106 and 108 bp). Only for mGBP4
alternative 5' non-coding exons were observed (1-I, 1-II,
and 1-III). EST sequences harboring either exon 1-I or
exon 1-II as well as all three alternative 5' UTR exons were
found in the database. Furthermore, we were able to identify an alternative splice form of mGBP4. Due to a mutation at the splice donor site in intron 2 two different
transcripts, named mGBP4 and mGBP4.1, are generated
[26]. Except exon 3 of mGBP4, all mGBPs on chromosome 5 share identical sizes of the individual coding
exons 3 to 10. Even the intron sequences are highly conserved in these genes. In particular, intron 4, intron 7,
intron 8, intron 9, and intron 10 exhibit high similarities.
Comparable to all other mGBPs the pseudogene
pseudomGbp2 shows a highly conserved exon-intron
structure. Yet, an inversion of 'exon 1' and 'exon 2' results
in a non-functional locus. Taken together, due to their
high structural homologies these loci seem to be duplicated quite recently.
In vitro and in vivo analyses of the new mGBP members
After determination of the precise exon-intron structure of
each mGBP we confirmed the predicted sequences by
cloning and sequencing the corresponding cDNAs out of
IFNγ stimulated macrophages. These studies revealed that
mGBP11 has a premature stop codon within exon 8 lead-

Sequence alignments and homologies of the mGBPs
Based on ORF sequences of the 11 mGBPs we accomplished a cDNA alignment using the ClustalW algorithm
(Fig. 4 and additional file 2). As shown in the alignment,
the mGBPs share a high degree of homology throughout
their coding sequences whereas the 5' part is the most conserved region of the mGBPs. Especially, mGBP6 and
mGBP10 are the most homologous mGBPs differing in
only 30 basepairs within an ORF sequence of 1836 bp.
The conserved 5' part codes for the four typical GTP binding motifs. Although there are some differences in the
nucleotide sequence of the GTP binding motifs the amino
acid sequences are almost identical (Table 1). In detail,
the G1 motifs of mGBP2, mGBP3, mGBP5/5a, mGBP6,
mGBP7, mGBP8, mGBP9, and mGBP11 are identical,
only the G1 motifs of mGBP1 and mGBP10 differ in two
amino acids, and the G1 motif of mGBP4/4.1 differ in
three amino acids. The G2 and G3 motifs are the same
among all mGBPs. Regarding the G4 domain the mGBPs
can be divided into the two subgroups 'TVRD' (mGBP4.1,
mGBP6, mGBP7, mGBP8, mGBP9, and mGBP11) and
'TLRD' (mGBP1, mGBP2, and mGBP5), except mGBP3
with a 'AVRD' and mGBP10 with a 'IVRD' motif (Table 1).
Most likely the functional consequences are minor since
the amino acid variations in different G4 motifs lead to
conservative exchange of aliphatic (L/V) and hydrophobic
(T/A/I) amino acids. Interestingly, the mGBPs from the
'TLRD' group possess a C-terminal CaaX motif, which can
be modified by isoprenylation [27]. Overall, the 3' parts
of the mGBPs are more divergent than the 5' parts.

Using the maximum likelihood method we generated a
phylogenetic tree of the mGBP family based on the ORF
sequences (Fig. 5). This phylogenetic analysis revealed
three predominant homology clusters. Two homology
clusters are located on chromosome 3. The first homology
cluster consists of mGbp1, mGbp2, and mGbp5/5a. The
second homology cluster contains mGbp3 and mGbp7.
The homologies of the members of these two clusters are

lower than 60% (Table 2). The second cluster is with
approximately 70% amino acid identities more closely
related to the mGBPs in the third homology cluster on
chromosome 5 encompassing mGbp4, mGbp6, mGbp8,
mGbp9, mGbp10, and mGbp11. Within the cluster on
chromosome 5 sequence identities reach 65% up to 98%
(Table 2). The short branches implicate a just recent duplication of these genes on chromosome 5.

Discussion
In order to find new IFNγ regulated host effector molecules we were able to identify and characterize five novel
members of the mGBP family [5]. Further, we showed
that all hitherto identified members of the mGBP family
are IFNγ induced and moreover are highly upregulated in
mice after infection with L. monocytogenes or T. gondii. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in infected cells most
mGBPs surround the parasitophorous vacuole of T. gondii
[5]. Consecutively, within this study, comprehensive
homology and motif searches against public databases
(NCBI, Ensembl) using EST and BAC sequences resolved

the genomic organization and localization of the mGBPs
in more detail. During these analyses we were able to
identify the additional mGBP member mGBP11. The
scope of this study was to determine the precise loci of the
11 mGBPs and of the two pseudogenes, to compare the
structure and organization of the mGBPs, to compile all
cDNA sequences, and to verify the expression of mGBP
mRNAs.
Genomic organization of the mGBPs
The combined analyses revealed two mGBP homology
clusters on chromosomes 3 and 5. One mGBP cluster is
located within the H3 region on chromosome 3 which is
in contrast to previously published data where the cluster
was mapped to the H1 region [21]. The second cluster is
located in the E5 region on chromosome 5 which is in
accordance to Olszewski et al. [21]. Furthermore, Olsze-

wski et al. noted that within the mGBP cluster on chromosome 5 the only functional mGBP gene is mGbp4 and that
in addition three pseudogenes (pseudomGbp2,
pseudomGbp3, and pseudomGbp4) are located on this
chromosome. Our in silico and mRNA sequence analyses
now clearly demonstrate that besides mGbp4 five
expressed mGBPs (mGbp6, mGbp8, mGbp9, mGbp10, and
mGbp11) are located on chromosome 5 (this study and
[5]). In a previous report, we have shown that the mGbp4
locus does not encode for a complete mGBP4 protein
[26]. For pseudomGbp2 we could not find any corresponding EST sequence and were not able to clone a
cDNA corresponding to pseudomGBP2, thus excluding
the possibility of an alternative start downstream of exon
2. Based on BAC analyses we could demonstrate that the
two pseudogenes pseudomGbp3 and pseudomGbp4
described by Olszewski et al. are both part of mGbp8

which was virtually disrupted by the Abcg3 gene locus in a
former incorrect assembly within the public databases
(see also [21]). Further transcript analyses revealed a functional mGbp8 locus and showed an IFNγ dependent
upregulation of the mGBP8 mRNA comparable to
mGBP6, mGBP9, mGBP10, and mGBP11. Similarly, all
these mGBPs were highly induced upon L. monocytogenes
infection in C57BL/6 mice (this study and [5]). The BAC
sequences as well as our sequenced cDNA clones of the
newly identified mGBP11 contain a premature stop
codon within exon 8, leading to an ORF sequence of only
1329 bp. However, in the database (NCBI) one cDNA of

mGBP11 without a premature stop was found (Acc. No.
BC111039). It might be possible that the presence of different mGBP11 cDNAs is due to allelic variation. Further
studies have to clarify, whether from this locus a functional protein can be translated and whether other mouse
backgrounds differ in exon 8.
In a recently published report, some subtle differences to
our extensive genomic analyses have been described [28].
Firstly, in this report no mGBP7 gene is presented. Secondly, mGBP6 in [28] is termed mGBP7 based on our
NCBI database submission in 2006 (BK005760, [5]).
Thirdly, mGBP12 has been deposited in 2007 as mGBP11
by us (EU304258, this study). To keep consistency
between database and nomenclature we propose to refer
to the mGBP assignment in Figure 1. This is also in accordance with the extensive protein sequence and functional
analyses which were provided previously [5]. mGBP13
has been described as a pseudogene by Olszewski and
here (see Fig. 1 pseudoGbp1). Unfortunately, no description of the methods used for the identification of the
mGBP13 locus is given in [28]. However, further studies
are required to confirm whether this is a functional mGBP
locus.
Besides the chromosomal localization of the mGBPs we
also elucidated the exon-intron structure of these genes.
Interestingly, all mGBPs consist of eleven exons with an
impressively similar gene organization, with only one
exception in mGbp8 which lacks exon 6. In addition, the
translation of all mGBPs starts in exon 2. For mGbp3 and
mGbp4 alternative non-coding exons were found in the 5'
regions. The usage of different 5' exons may influence the
stability of the mRNAs [29]. Indeed, the frequencies of
ESTs of mGBP3 and mGBP4 with the different alternative
5' exons are quite variable, so their functional significance
has to be validated. It has been reported that mRNAs of
genes with alternative 5' coding or non-coding exons are

created based on ORF sequences using the neighbor-joining
method of the treepuzzle software. Branch lengths are measured relative to the estimated numbers of substitutions.
Therefore, mGBP5 and mGBP5a appear less similar as they
are actually on their amino acid level.

often expressed in a tissue-specific manner [30]. Further
studies will be necessary to verify a potential tissue-specific expression/regulation of the different mRNA isoforms of mGBP3 and mGBP4.
Evolution of the mGBPs
Recent data indicate that the GBPs are host effector molecules involved in pathogen defense [5,16,17]. Defense
against pathogens requires permanent adaptation to the
changes in pathogen virulence strategies [31,32]. We suggest that evolutionary pressure led to gene duplication
events which have resulted in the current mGBP clusters
on chromosomes 3 and 5. It is most likely, that these gene
duplications started with one primordial mGBP. We suppose that this ancestor mGBP is located on chromosome
3 because these mGBPs are more divergent among each
other as compared to the mGBPs on chromosome 5.
Interestingly, on chromosome 3 two homology clusters
have evolved. One homology cluster with mGbp1, mGbp2,
and mGbp5 is characterized by a C-terminal CaaX motif
for isoprenylation and a 'TLRD' G4 motif. In contrast, the
second homology cluster with mGbp3 and mGbp7 lacks
the CaaX motif and possess a 'TVRD' G4 motif. This finding leads to the hypothesis, that mGbp3 or mGbp7 is the
ancestor for all mGBPs on chromosome 5 which also lack
a CaaX motif and have a "TVRD" G4 motif. This is further
corroborated by the high cDNA sequence identities
(around 70%) of mGBP3 and mGBP7 with mGBP4,
mGBP6, mGBP8, mGBP9, mGBP10, and mGBP11 on
chromosome 5. On this chromosome also the most recent
duplication event occurred, where mGbp6 emanated from
mGbp10 or vice versa. This is supported by the high
homology of 98.4% between these two GTPases. Moreover, we suggest that the mGBP cluster on chromosome 5
is a "genomic hot spot" permanently exposed to genetic
recombination events. Consistent with this suggestion, we
detected a transposon-like element (>1000 bp) which is
integrated several times in this mGBP cluster (data not
shown). Further studies have to clarify whether these
genes evolved due to evolutionary pressure and whether
these genes have redundant or non-redundant functions
during pathogen defense.

We have shown that mGBPs are highly induced upon
IFNγ stimulation and infection with intracellular bacteria
or protozoa indicating an important role as effector molecules in host defense. Now, we describe and characterize
the genomic loci of the mGBPs on chromosomes 3 and 5.
These data will be very important for the analyses of evolutionary gene amplifications required in host defense as
well as for functional studies by the generation of gene targeted mice which are under way.

Methods
Determination of the genomic sequences and localization
of the mGBPs
To analyse the chromosomal localization of the mGBPs
the mouse genome research page on the Ensembl website
http://www.ensembl.org, version 38 was used. The
genomic sequences of the appropriate chromosomal segments were determined using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. To display all available BACs on
the contig view the corresponding field was activated
using the 'decorations' function. For this study we have
chosen the sequences of the BAC clones RP23-100J23 and
RP24-314I8 for chromosome 3 and RP24-63G23, RP23329M7, RP23-152O10, and RP24-210D14 for chromosome 5. We obtained the BACs' genomic sequences from
the website of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The
sequences were downloaded [Accession numbers:
AC102108 (RP23-100J23), AC115865 (RP24-314I8),
AC113980 (RP24-63G23), AC123697 (RP23-329M7),
AC144914 (RP24-210D14), and AC162798 (RP23152O10)] and imported into EditSeq (DNAStar, Madison, WI) for assembly into contigs using the SeqMan II
program (DNAStar, Madison, WI). For further analyses
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of mGBPs were obtained
with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
'blastn' [25] from the NCBI website and mapped onto the
respective genomic area.
Identification of the exon-intron structure
The transcript sequences from mGBP4 (mpa-2) and
mGBP6 (mpa-2l) were downloaded from the Ensembl
website and imported into EditSeq. We then determined
the exon-intron structure by using BLAST "align two
sequences" using standard parameters on the NCBI website. The sequences of single exons from mGBP4 and
mGBP6 were aligned with the corresponding BAC
sequences. If the exons mapped to multiple regions on the
BAC with high homology the regions were retained and
imported into EditSeq. The equivalent sequences from the
resulting BLAST hits on the BACs were subsequently
aligned with MeqAlign (DNAStar, Madison, WI) using
standard parameters. The 3' and 5' splice sites were identified manually by inspecting the alignment and confirmed by comparing the genomic sequences to the
corresponding exon sequences. Once all exons were
mapped on the genome the exons indicating a new gene
locus were assembled and potential cDNAs were created.
Finally, we determined the open reading frames by using
the ORF search tool from EditSeq.
Alignment and phylogenetic tree
The alignment of mGBP cDNAs was created with the software ClustalW [33] and the subsequent layout was done
with JalView http://www.jalview.org. The phylogenetic

Page 9 of 12

analysis was accomplished using the maximum likelihood method and treepuzzle http://www.tree-puzzle.de
for construction of the phylogenetic tree. The treepuzzle
software was run with the option for exact parameter estimates using the neighbor joining method. Finally, we
used the software drawtree from the phylip package http:/
/www.phylip.com to plot the tree data. All software was
run on a Linux PC workstation.
Cell culture and stimulation
The macrophage cell line ANA-1 [34] was cultured in very
low endotoxin RPMI (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated, low endotoxin fetal
calf serum (Cambrex, Veniers, Belgium) and 50μM 2-βMercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).

For stimulation of ANA-1 cells we used 100 U/ml recombinant mouse IFNγ (R&D Systems, Mainz, Germany).
After 16 h of IFNγ stimulation the cells were harvested for
RNA preparation.
Infection with Listeria monocytogenes
C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Charles River
(Sulzfeld, Germany) and maintained in the animal facility
of the Medical Faculty of the Heinrich-Heine-University
under SPF conditions. All procedures performed on animals in this study have been approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of the local government of Duesseldorf and have been in accordance with the German animal laws. C57BL/6N mice were intraperitoneally infected
with 0.1 × LD50 L. monocytogenes (American type culture
collection strain 43251), and organs were removed 48 h
after infection.

ClustalW alignment of ORF sequences of the eleven 65 kDa mGBP members. The alignment-layout was edited with the JalView software. Basepairs identical in all eleven mGBPs are marked in dark blue, identical in
≥75% in medium blue and identical in ≥50% in light blue. Red boxes
highlight the conserved GTP binding motifs: P-loop (G1), Switch I (G2),
Switch II (G3) and G4.

Availability and requirements
To analyse the chromosomal localization of the mGBPs
the mouse genome research page on the Ensembl website
was
http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/newsview?rel=38
used. We obtained the BACs' genomic sequences from the
website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The alignment of mGBP cDNAs was created with the software
ClustalW [33] and the subsequent layout was done with
JalView http://www.jalview.org. The phylogenetic analysis was accomplished using the maximum likelihood
method and treepuzzle http://www.tree-puzzle.de for
construction of the phylogenetic tree. The treepuzzle software was run with the option for exact parameter estimates using the neighbor joining method. Finally, we
used the software drawtree from the phylip package http:/
/www.phylip.com to plot the tree data. All software was
run on a Linux PC workstation.

Authors' contributions
AK carried out the in silico analysis and drafted the manuscript. CK performed the PCRs and drafted the manuscript. JW participated in the sequence alignment and
generated the phylogenetic tree. CBG carried out the infection experiments and stimulation of macrophages and
prepared all cDNA. DD participated in the sequence align-

Primer pairs used for amplification of mGBP6, mGBP7, mGBP8,
mGBP9, mGBP10, and mGBP11. Due to the high homology an identical
forward primer for mGBP8, mGBP9 and mGBP11 combined with specific reverse primers were used. For mGBP6 and mGBP10 an identical
reverse primer and specific forward primers which bind in the 5' UTR
were used. GAPDH served as an internal control.
