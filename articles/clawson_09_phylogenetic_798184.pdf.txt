Abstract
Background: Cattle are a reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC
O157), and are known to harbor subtypes not typically found in clinically ill humans. Consequently,
nucleotide polymorphisms previously discovered via strains originating from human outbreaks may
be restricted in their ability to distinguish STEC O157 genetic subtypes present in cattle. The
objectives of this study were firstly to identify nucleotide polymorphisms in a diverse sampling of
human and bovine STEC O157 strains, secondly to classify strains of either bovine or human origin
by polymorphism-derived genotypes, and finally to compare the genotype diversity with pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE), a method currently used for assessing STEC O157 diversity.
Results: High-throughput 454 sequencing of pooled STEC O157 strain DNAs from human clinical
cases (n = 91) and cattle (n = 102) identified 16,218 putative polymorphisms. From those, 178 were
selected primarily within genomic regions conserved across E. coli serotypes and genotyped in 261
STEC O157 strains. Forty-two unique genotypes were observed that are tagged by a minimal set
of 32 polymorphisms. Phylogenetic trees of the genotypes are divided into clades that represent
strains of cattle origin, or cattle and human origin. Although PFGE diversity surpassed genotype
diversity overall, ten PFGE patterns each occurred with multiple strains having different genotypes.
Conclusions: Deep sequencing of pooled STEC O157 DNAs proved highly effective in
polymorphism discovery. A polymorphism set has been identified that characterizes genetic
diversity within STEC O157 strains of bovine origin, and a subset observed in human strains. The
set may complement current techniques used to classify strains implicated in disease outbreaks.

Background

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC O157)
recently emerged as a cause of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis,
and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [1]. STEC O157 cause
an estimated 73,480 illnesses each year in the United States
[2] and probably evolved from a progenitor of E. coli O55:H7,
a source of infantile diarrhea [3]. The STEC O157 5.5-Mb
genome contains a 4.1-Mb backbone that is shared with E.
coli K-12 and thought to be conserved across most E. coli
serotypes [4,5]. Much of the remaining genome originates
from horizontal transfer, with a significant contribution from
bacteriophages [4,5]. The loss and gain of genes through horizontal transfer, coupled with nucleotide variation distributed
throughout the STEC O157 genome, serve in both recording
the evolution and defining the diversity of this pathogenic
serotype [6-8].
Detection of genetic diversity between STEC O157 strains is
an important component of outbreak investigations. Heterogeneity between STEC O157 strains has been detected
through multilocus sequence tagging [9], octamer and PCRbased genome scanning [10,11], phage typing [12,13], multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis [14],
microarrays [15,16], nucleotide polymorphism assays [8],
phage integration patterns coupled with genome polymorphisms [17,18], and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
[19,20]. Of these, PFGE is currently the method of choice for
distinguishing between STEC O157 strains implicated in outbreaks [21], and entails standardized chromosome digestions
with XbaI, and separation of DNA segments through gel electrophoresis[22]. Differing banding patterns are used to identify genetic diversity between STEC O157 strains. However,
PFGE does not effectively show evolutionary descent between
epidemiologically related strains [8,23]. Additionally, the
standardized PFGE method is unreliable for determining
genetic relatedness between STEC O157 strains that are epidemiologically unrelated [24].
Nucleotide polymorphisms, if sufficiently present within
microbial populations, such as STEC O157, are highly amenable for determining genetic relatedness and descent between
either epidemiologically related or unrelated strains [25].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been recently
identified throughout the STEC O157 genome [15,16,26] and
some have been used to identify variation between STEC
O157 strains originating from clinically ill humans [8]. Thirtynine SNP-based STEC O157 genotypes were identified that
defined nine phylogenetic clades, of which one associated
with increased hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious complication of STEC O157 infection [8]. Thus, SNPs have been
employed in the classification of STEC O157 by phylotype,
and for distinguishing a subpopulation with increased human
virulence.
Cattle are a reservoir of STEC O157 and harbor subtypes that
are not typically observed in humans [10,26]. Consequently,

SNPs ascertained exclusively with strains associated with
human outbreaks [16] may be ineffective at distinguishing a
greater proportion of STEC O157 genetic diversity present in
cattle. Given that strains of any genetic subtype may be drawn
into a human outbreak investigation, and/or food recall, an
ability to detect the fullest spectrum of STEC O157 genetic
diversity with nucleotide polymorphisms would be useful in
any STEC O157 investigation. Additionally, a greater understanding of STEC O157 genetic diversity, and how it relates to
human pathogenesis, may lead to the identification of alleles
that are directly involved with increased human virulence.
The main goal of this study was to sequence the genomes (1×)
of 193 diverse STEC O157 strains and identify a set of nucleotide polymorphisms that classify STEC O157 of either bovine
or human origin by genotype. Reported here are 42 unique
polymorphism-derived STEC O157 genotypes that are tagged
by a minimal set of 32 polymorphisms. Phylogenetic trees
produced by the genotypes are split into clades that represent
strains of cattle origin, or cattle and human origin. These
results indicate that heterologous members of the STEC O157
serotype are distinguishable through nucleotide polymorphisms, and support the notion that a subset of STEC O157
harbored in cattle causes the majority of human disease.

Results
Sequencing coverage of 193 STEC O157 strains
Approximately 1× genome coverage of 193 STEC O157 strains
was obtained through 454 GS FLX shotgun sequencing of
three STEC O157 DNA pools (see Additional data file 1 for
supplementary strain, PFGE, and genotype information). The
DNA pools were designed to account for: host origin; and the
alleles of a polymorphism in the translocated intimin receptor
gene (tir 255T>A), as STEC O157 with the tir 255T>A A allele
are rarely isolated from clinically ill humans [26]. A total of
1.306 Gb of genomic sequence was obtained from DNA pools
of: 51 strains of bovine origin, tir 255 T>A A allele (346.2 Mb);
51 strains of bovine origin tir 255T>A T allele (402.6 Mb); and
91 strains of human origin, of which all had the tir 255T>A T
allele (557.5 Mb). Given that the STEC O157 genome is
approximately 5.5 Mb, the depth of sequence obtained for
each of the three pools averages to slightly more than 1×
whole genome coverage for each of the 193 strains sequenced
in this study.

Polymorphism identification and validation
A total of 16,218 putative nucleotide and/or insertion deletion
polymorphisms were identified and mapped onto the Sakai
STEC O157 reference genome with Roche GS Reference Mapper Software (Nutley, NJ, USA). Of these, 9,528 mapped to
prophages integrated throughout 12.2% of the Sakai genome
(Figure 1). Phage integration loci are problematical for both
SNP discovery and validation, as multiple integrations within
the STEC O157 genome have resulted in large stretches of paralogous sequence that are virtually indistinguishable from

one another. As a result, apparent polymorphisms may actually be differences between two or more highly similar sites in
the genome rather than representing true variation at a single
nucleotide locus. In addition, assay design in these highly
repetitive sequences is impractical. Consequently, putative
polymorphisms identified within these sites were not queried
with validation assays in this study. Of the remaining 6,690
putative polymorphisms, 1,735 were identified via the STEC
O157 DNA pool of human strains, and 4,955 were identified
via the DNA pools of cattle strains.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) genotype validation assays were developed for
227 putative polymorphisms based on their minor allele frequencies in one or more of the STEC O157 DNA pools. The
minor alleles of 169 polymorphisms were observed exclusively in one of the three DNA pools at a frequency of 15% or
higher (human strain DNA pool (n = 18), bovine strain DNA
pool, tir 255T>A T allele (n = 81), bovine strain DNA pool, tir
255T>A A allele (n = 70)). Additionally, 58 polymorphisms
were included where the minor allele was observed in both
bovine DNA pools with a minor allele frequency of 10% or
higher in one or both pools. MALDI-TOF genotyping of the
227 polymorphisms across 261 STEC O157 strains (Additional data file 1) indicated that 21 putative polymorphisms
resided in duplicated genomic regions as a subset of STEC
O157 strains yielded heterozygous genotypes. Another 28
putative polymorphisms proved either intractable for geno-

Identification of polymorphism-derived genotypes in
STEC O157 strains of human and cattle origin
Concatenation of 178 polymorphism alleles for each of the
STEC O157 strains genotyped in this study yielded 42 unique
polymorphism-derived genotypes that are delineable with a
minimal subset of 32 'tagging' polymorphisms (see Additional data files 3 and 4 for polymorphism-derived genotypes
based on all 178 and the 32 tagging polymorphisms, respectively). A total of 34 of the polymorphism-derived genotypes
were observed in STEC O157 strains of cattle origin, 16 were
observed in strains of human origin, with 8 observed in
strains of both human and cattle origin (Figure 2; Additional
data file 1). Eight genotypes were observed exclusively in
strains of human origin and 26 were observed exclusively in
strains of bovine origin. Of particular interest, the same STEC
O157 genotype (genotype 28) had the highest overall frequency in STEC O157 strains of human and bovine origin
(Figure 2), indicating that STEC O157 of this genetic background may have an advantage in populating cattle and/or
causing disease in humans.

Phylogenetic analyses of STEC O157 polymorphismderived genotypes
Neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood trees
were generated for the 42 polymorphism-derived genotypes
using 178 polymorphism alleles, and the minimal set of 32
tagging polymorphism alleles. Both allele data sets yielded
similar trees; however, bootstrap values were lower overall in
trees generated with the minimal set of 32 tagging polymorphism alleles, as this set contained a reduced amount of phylogenetic information (Figure 3; see Additional data file 5 for
a phylogenetic tree based on the 32 tagging polymorphism
alleles). The trees were used to depict the genetic relatedness
of STEC O157 strains of known host origin and tir 255T>A
allele status. The neighbor-joining tree in Figure 3 was constructed from 178 polymorphism alleles, and shows a monophyletic cluster of all 17 polymorphism-derived genotypes
with the tir 255T>A A allele. Strains from 66 cattle originating from the US, Japan, Scotland, and Australia had the tir
255T>A A allele and one of the 17 polymorphism-derived genotypes. Additionally, the one STEC O157 strain of human origin included in this study that had the tir 255T>A A allele also
had a genotype contained within the cluster (Additional data
files 1, 3 and 4). The remaining 25 polymorphism-derived
genotypes represent STEC O157 strains isolated from humans
or cattle that all have the tir 255T>A T allele. These genotypes
cluster together in subclades that are strongly supported by
neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood algorithms (Figure 3). Ninety-two percent of the human STEC

O157 strains genotyped in this study placed within two subclades on the tree (Figure 3).
To determine the extent to which the polymorphism-derived
genotypes can be used to distinguish STEC O157 genetic relatedness, a median-joining network was constructed from the
32 tagging polymorphism data set (Figure 4). Unlike the
neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood
trees, which placed genotypes exclusively as outer taxonomic
units, the median-joining network allowed for genotypes to
be placed as either internal or outer nodes of the network.
Nodes on linear, open, connecting lines on this network represent stepwise evolutionary descent. Nodes on circular,

closed loops in the center of the network indicate that either
convergent evolution or recombination occurred within some
STEC O157 strains (Figure 4) [8]. Given that lateral-gene
transfer is a fundamental component of STEC O157 biology
and pathogenesis, and that a tri-allelic polymorphism was
identified in this study (Additional data file 2; nucleotide
position 3,506,470, Additional data files 3 and 4), either scenario is likely and both confound interpretations of genetic
relatedness on the network, which assumes stepwise evolutionary descent. Consequently, the loops within the center of
the network provide a natural barrier in determining genetic
relatedness between STEC O157 genotypes (Figure 4).

O157 strains using unambiguous PFGE patterns and polymorphism derived-genotypes (Additional data file 1). A con-

servative standard was employed for distinguishing differing
PFGE patterns, where only identical banding patterns were
assigned to the same PFGE group. We observed 154 PFGE
patterns and 42 polymorphism-derived genotypes between
the strains, with multiple PFGE patterns observed on 24 genotypes (Figure 5; Additional data file 1). A total of 131 PFGE

patterns and 18 polymorphism-derived genotypes manifested
as singletons in this study (Additional data file 1). Of 23 PFGE
patterns observed in more than one strain, 10 occurred with
strains having different polymorphism-derived genotypes,
with 3 PFGE patterns each manifesting in strains of markedly
different genetic backgrounds (Figure 6). This result indicates that the polymorphism-derived genotypes described in
this study have an immediate utility in distinguishing genetically distinct STEC O157 strains that appear identical by
PFGE profile.

portion of STEC O157 diversity that appears primarily in cattle, and one representing a portion of STEC O157 diversity
that may or may not appear in clinically ill humans. These two
pools were complemented with the DNA pool of STEC O157
strains isolated from clinically ill humans. By selecting polymorphisms where the minor allele was observed at a relatively high frequency in either the STEC O157 DNA pool of
human strains or at least one of the two cattle strain DNA
pools, 42 polymorphism genotypes were identified that cover
a large spectrum of STEC O157 diversity present in cattle, and
a subset of genotypes that manifests in clinically ill humans.

Discussion

While this study defined a sub-lineage of STEC O157 that is
poorly represented in humans, a genetic mechanism for causing this host restriction is unknown. The tir 255T>A polymorphism is a likely candidate as the translocated intimin
receptor protein is part of the STEC O157 type-three secretion
system and facilitates bacterium attachment to enterocyte
cells within the colon and subsequent effacement [27]. Additionally, the T>A substitution encodes a non-synonymous
replacement of aspartate for glutamate in the translocated
intimin receptor protein. However, the tir 255T>A polymorphism is not known to directly affect STEC O157 virulence in

Number of strains and different PFGE patterns per genotype

GS FLX sequences are clonal in origin because they are ultimately derived from a single strand of DNA. Consequently,
high- and low-frequency polymorphism alleles can be
detected through GS FLX sequencing of pooled DNA libraries. We took advantage of this attribute by designing STEC
O157 DNA pools that were sorted by host origin phenotype
(cattle or human), and genotype for the tir 255 T>A polymorphism. Because the tir 255 T>A A allele is rarely observed in
STEC O157 isolated from humans, STEC O157 DNAs of cattle
origin could be separated into two pools, one representing a

humans [26], and this study identified 1,735 putative polymorphisms (outside of phage integration sites) with minor
alleles exclusively observed in the human STEC O157 DNA
pool. This finding complicates interpretations regarding a tir
255T>A polymorphism effect on human virulence. Regardless of knowing which alleles directly impact the ability of
STEC O157 to cause human disease, an ability to track and
identify variation linked with the tir 255T>A A allele is important, as one human strain in this study had the tir 255T>A A
allele and a polymorphism-derived genotype that fell within
the monophyletic clade typically found in cattle.
A majority of STEC O157-induced human disease sampled in
this study was caused by strains that have followed one of two
overarching lines of descent, as 92% of all human strain polymorphism-derived genotypes were placed within two large

subclades (Figures 3 and 4; Additional data file 5). These two
clades are separated from one another by both orthologous
descent and probable recombination (Figure 4) and may be
split out further into smaller clade sets [8]. It is likely that variation between the subclades, or variation among genotypes
within a subclade, may associate with human virulence, as
this has been previously demonstrated with the US spinach
outbreak strain of 2006 [8], which had a higher rate of hospitalization and hemolytic uremic syndrome than other outbreak strains [28]. The US spinach outbreak strain was
included in this study and has a polymorphism-derived genotype (genotype 21) that differs from all others, in that only it
contains the minor alleles of two non-synonymous polymorphisms (Additional data files 2 and 3, N-acetylglutamate synthase: alanine to serine (position 3,672,410), and cytochrome
c nitrite reductase: arginine to histidine (position 5,141,169)).

These polymorphisms were not characterized in a previous
study of STEC O157 polymorphism-derived genotypes and
human virulence [8] as only four polymorphisms used in that
study coincide with the 178 described here.

and 97 isolated from human were targeted for genotyping of:
tir 255T>A; 178 polymorphisms identified in this study; and
PFGE (Additional data file 1).

DNA isolation
The polymorphisms validated in this study primarily reside in
the conserved backbone of E. coli and some may be informative across Escherichia species. PFGE, the current gold standard for assessing STEC O157 genetic diversity [21], primarily
detects insertions and/or deletions within genomic regions
specific to STEC O157 [29]. Consequently, PFGE and the polymorphism-derived genotypes described in this study target
different regions of the STEC O157 genome that do not share
a common phylogeny. It is not surprising that PFGE diversity
surpassed polymorphism-derived genotype diversity overall,
given that PFGE patterns are known to change between subcultures of the same strain of STEC O157:H7 [30] and that
plasmid migration within PFGE can be unpredictable [23].
Future studies should be conducted that compare STEC O157
diversity assessed with the polymorphism-derived genotypes
and PFGE using outbreak samples. However, given that ten
different PFGE patterns were each observed in two or more
strains with different polymorphism genotypes, the 42 polymorphism-derived genotypes identified in this study have
immediate potential to resolve genetically distinct STEC O157
strains comprising an outbreak investigation that may be
indistinguishable by PFGE.

Genomic DNA was extracted from STEC O157 strains using
Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G columns (Valencia, CA, USA) and
a modified manufacturer's protocol. Following overnight
growth in 5 ml of Luria broth, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 minutes, re-suspended in Qiagen buffer B1 containing RNase A (0.2 mg/ml), and vortexed
per the manufacturer's instructions. Importantly, the samples were then incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes, vortexed,
and equilibrated at 37°C (failure to include the 70°C step frequently resulted in the columns becoming plugged and/or a
significant decrease in DNA yield). Following the addition of
80 μl lysozyme (100 mg/ml), 100 μl proteinase K (Qiagen),
and a 37°C incubation for 30 minutes, the DNAs were
extracted and air dried per the manufacturer's protocol. Purified DNAs were suspended in 500 μl TE (10 mM Tris pH 8.0,
0.1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 2 hours at 50°C, followed by
an overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle
mixing. Strain DNA preparations were assessed by 260 nm/
280 nm absorptions, which were determined with a NanoDrop Technologies ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE, USA), and by gel electrophoresis.

STEC O157 DNA pools, GS FLX sequencing, and
polymorphism identification

Conclusions

The method of pooling large numbers of phenotyped STEC
O157 strain DNAs and subsequent high throughput 454
sequencing proved extremely efficient for the identification of
variation within and between pooled populations, and
resulted in the identification of 178 polymorphisms that collectively define 42 unique STEC O157 genotypes. The genotypes characterize genetic diversity and relatedness within
STEC O157 strains of bovine origin, and a subset observed in
human strains. We identified a minimal set of 32 polymorphisms that tag all 42 genotypes, and show that this set can
detect genetically diverse STEC O157 strains that are indistinguishable by PFGE.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
STEC O157 strains of bovine origin (n = 102) that varied by
source, and epidemiologically unrelated human clinical STEC
O157 strains (n = 91) were used for polymorphism discovery
(Additional data file 1) [4,31-37]. Each strain was characterized as STEC O157 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay using an O157 monoclonal antibody and multiplex PCR
for stx1, stx2, eae, hlyA, rfbO157 and fliCH7 [38-41]. Additionally, each strain was genotyped for a polymorphism residing
within the translocated intimin receptor gene (tir 255 T>A)
[26]. A total of 261 STEC O157 strains, 164 isolated from cattle

Three STEC O157 DNA pools were created for GS FLX
sequencing and polymorphism discovery. One consisted of
DNAs from 51 STEC O157 strains (3 μg/strain), all of cattle
origin and all with the tir 255 T>A A allele. Another consisted
of DNAs from 51 STEC O157 strains (3 μg/strain), all of cattle
origin and all with the tir 255 T>A T allele. Another consisted
of DNAs from 91 STEC O157 strains (3 μg/strain) originating
from clinically ill humans, all with the tir 255 T>A T allele.
Genomic libraries were prepared from each of the three DNA
pools for Roche 454 GS FLX shot-gun sequencing according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Nutley, NJ, USA). A total of 11
emulsion-based PCRs and sequencing runs were performed,
three for the DNA pool of cattle origin, tir 255T>A A allele,
three for the DNA pool of cattle origin, tir 255T>A T allele,
and five for the DNA pool of human origin. SNPs were
mapped to a reference sequence of STEC O157 (Sakai strain)
and identified with Roche GS Reference Mapper Software
(version 1.1.03).

Polymorphism genotyping
A file containing all targeted polymorphisms was prepared for
assay design and multiplexing by MassARRAY® assay design
software as recommended by the manufacturer (Sequenom,
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). A target of maximum 36 and minimum 21 polymorphisms per multiplex was set for design,
with default settings for all other parameters. Seven multiplexes containing 225 polymorphisms were designed (aver-

age 32 polymorphisms per multiplex, range 21 to 36). Assays
were performed using iPLEX Gold® chemistry on a MassARRAY® genotyping system as recommended by the manufacturer (Sequenom Inc.). Genotypes designated as high
confidence by the Genotyper® software were accepted as correct; those with lower confidence (marked 'aggressive' in the
software) were manually inspected. Replicate iPLEX assays
and/or Sanger sequencing were used to verify genotypes.

patterns were indistinguishable.

Polymorphism-derived genotype analyses
The alleles of 178 polymorphisms were concatenated by physical order along the STEC O157 genome for 261 STEC O157
strains and aligned using Clustal X (version 1.83) [42].
Redundant polymorphism-derived genotypes were identified
using TreePuzzle (version 5.2) [43,44], and removed from
Clustal X alignments. Neighbor-joining and parsimony phylogenetic trees were generated using a collection of software
programs in PHYLIP (version 3.65, Consense, DnaDist, DnaPars, Neighbor, Retree, Seqboot) [45]. To construct a neighbor-joining tree, a distance matrix was first produced in
DnaDist using an F84 distance model of substitution and a
transition/transversion ratio of 2. The output of DnaDist was
used to construct a neighbor-joining tree in Neighbor, which
was mid-point rooted using Retree. Neighbor-joining bootstraps (1,000) were determined with Seqboot, DnaDist,
Neighbor, and Consense. A parsimony tree with 1,000 bootstraps was generated with Seqboot, DnaPars (best tree thorough search) and Consense. Maximum-likelihood trees were
generated in Tree-Puzzle (version 5.2) with 10,000 puzzling
steps and an HKY model of substitution. Neighbor-joining,
parsimony, and maximum-likelihood trees were all viewed in
TreeView (version 1.6.6) [46].
Haploview v 4.1 [47] was used to identify a minimal set of polymorphisms (tagging polymorphisms) that distinguish each
of the unique polymorphism-derived genotypes observed in
this study. All 178 polymorphism genotypes were used to
infer STEC O157 haplotypes in Haploview at a haplotype frequency threshold of 0% or higher. Neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood trees were generated from
concatenated tagging polymorphism genotypes using model
assumptions identical to those used for the full genotype data
sets. Additionally, a median-joining network was constructed
in Network (version 4.5.0.2) [48] for the concatenated tagging polymorphism genotypes.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis
The standardized PFGE method [49] was performed on 261
STEC O157 strains that were also targeted for SNP genotyping
(Additional data file 1). Gel images were analyzed using Bionumerics (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium), and
banding patterns were clustered using an unweighted pairgroup method with arithmetic mean algorithm and a bandbased Dice coefficient. Default tolerance settings were used.
No restriction enzymes additional to XbaI were used. Strains
