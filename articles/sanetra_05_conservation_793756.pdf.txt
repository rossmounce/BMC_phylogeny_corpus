Abstract
One of the surprising insights gained from research in evolutionary developmental biology (evodevo) is that increasing diversity in body plans and morphology in organisms across animal phyla
are not reflected in similarly dramatic changes at the level of gene composition of their genomes.
For instance, simplicity at the tissue level of organization often contrasts with a high degree of
genetic complexity. Also intriguing is the observation that the coding regions of several genes of
invertebrates show high sequence similarity to those in humans. This lack of change (conservation)
indicates that evolutionary novelties may arise more frequently through combinatorial processes,
such as changes in gene regulation and the recruitment of novel genes into existing regulatory gene
networks (co-option), and less often through adaptive evolutionary processes in the coding
portions of a gene. As a consequence, it is of great interest to examine whether the widespread
conservation of the genetic machinery implies the same developmental function in a last common
ancestor, or whether homologous genes acquired new developmental roles in structures of
independent phylogenetic origin. To distinguish between these two possibilities one must refer to
current concepts of phylogeny reconstruction and carefully investigate homology relationships.
Particularly problematic in terms of homology decisions is the use of gene expression patterns of
a given structure. In the future, research on more organisms other than the typical model systems
will be required since these can provide insights that are not easily obtained from comparisons
among only a few distantly related model species.

Introduction
Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) seeks to
unravel the bases of developmental changes in body plan
evolution of complex organisms such as animals and
plants. The significance of this relatively new discipline is
based on the premise that evolution cannot be fully
understood without understanding the evolution of
developmental programmes [1], and a number of novel
conceptual frameworks have emerged from evo-devo
research to supplement those of traditional evolutionary

biology, such as DEVELOPMENTAL REPROGRAMMING
[1-6]. The latter concept describes the process that acts
between mutation and selection on the level of the organism, leading from an altered gene product to a new ontogeny and phenotype. Reprogramming has been proposed
to constitute an additional evolutionary mechanism
because some ontogenetic changes may be promoted by
existing developmental mechanisms while other alterations are prevented [1,3,7] (referred to as 'developmental
drive' and 'constraint', respectively [8]). It seems therefore

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:15

likely that evolution can be biased by development, and
this may have a powerful impact on the direction of evolutionary change [1,7,8].
During the past two decades it was discovered that most
animals, no matter how divergent in form, share specific
gene families that regulate major aspects of body patterning, for instance many homeobox-containing genes
[9,10], which are even present in the Cnidaria [11]. Recent
findings show that morphologically simple organisms
often possess genes, such as members of the pax gene family, that are homologous and show a high level of
sequence similarity to those of higher vertebrates [12-15].
Despite this astonishing extent of evolutionary conservation in developmental regulatory genes across major taxonomic groups, there are also cases where gene expression
patterns differ markedly among closely related taxa, for
instance in the molecular mechanisms that determine the
spatial axes of the tetrapod limb [16]. In the recent past,
one of the goals of evo-devo research was to search for
putative phylum-specific genes, which may have given rise
to phylum-specific evolutionary novelties. However, the
view hat new phyla arose in concert with the advent of
novel genes has been increasingly challenged [17,18].
Instead, there is mounting evidence that the evolution of
lineage-specific body plans does not primarily depend on
the invention of new genes but rather on the deployment
of new gene regulatory circuitries. Changes in the transcriptional regulation of genes may thus be more significant than changes in gene number or protein function
[18,19]. Moreover, the use of 'old' genes for novel structures has recently been demonstrated in a number of
instances [20,21].
Among the main controversies that have emerged from
evo-devo research is whether or not the utilization of conserved molecular components in developmental programmes across animal phyla can be taken as evidence for
a shared developmental function in their latest common
ancestor. The alternative would be the co-option of conserved genes and gene pathways to new functions, most
likely operating in non-homologous structures. It is therefore fundamental to employ phylogenetic methods and
homology criteria meticulously to resolve such issues,
including the idea of retention of genetic programmes or
're-awakening' [22-25]. Recent gene expression studies,
for instance, have revealed some common molecular
aspects of segment ontogenesis between insects and annelids (shared segmental expression of engrailed and wingless) [26], and between arachnids and chordates (shared
role of the notch signalling pathway) [27], which have
been used to reinforce the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of all bilaterian animals was segmented
[17,28-30]. However, one must be particularly critical
about such deep homologies since the probability of gene

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

recruitment to non-homologous roles grows with phylogenetic distance [1,31]. The use of gene expression patterns to establish homologies between morphologically
similar features among distantly related organisms is
another matter of ongoing debate [1,31,32].
In this review, we provide a brief introduction to evolutionary developmental biology for newcomers to the field
who may be overwhelmed by the abundant literature. We
outline how recent advances in evo-devo research have
changed our understanding of the genesis of species differences and morphological novelties. In particular, we
present examples to show that the contribution of phylogenetics to test hypotheses for the interpretation of problems in the evolution of developmental processes
[20,33,34] is becoming more and more recognized. We
also stress the importance of accurately assessing homology relationships and appropriate phylogenetic sampling
of organisms for evo-devo studies.

Morphological versus Genetic Complexity
It would seem plausible to think that an organism with
only a handful of tissue types has a much simpler genetic
machinery than morphologically more complex creatures,
such as vertebrates. But surprisingly little correlation has
been found between genetic complexity and the degree of
morphological organization so far. Some recent studies
have revealed an astoundingly large number of similarities in the genetic make-up between morphologically
complex organisms (e.g., vertebrates) and relatively simple forms (e.g., corals, molluscs). The most spectacular
examples come from cnidarians, which are among the
most basal metazoan animals composed of only two cell
layers and yet exhibit a rather advanced suite of genes,
such as pax, wnt, and genes involved in organizing the
bilaterian head [12,35,36]. About 12 % of the genes
found in the EST library of the coral Acropora (Anthozoa)
were shared with vertebrates but had no match with
Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster [14].
Until this finding, many of those 'vertebrate genes' were
presumed to be lineage-specific, e.g., Churchill and Tumorhead [14], which are functionally associated with a highly
differentiated nervous system. In cases where a particular
gene sequence was present in all three animals, the coral
sequence matched the human counterpart much more
strongly than any of the corresponding Caenorhabditis or
Drosophila sequences [14]. This suggests higher rates of
divergence in these invertebrate model systems, and a
recent analysis of the Pufferfish genome likewise indicates
that many fish proteins have diverged markedly faster
than their mammalian homologues [37,38]. Certainly,
the genetic complexity of corals is surprising considering
that they possess only a few tissue types and a simple nervous system.

Phylogeny of the Metazoa (adopted and simplified from [112-114]) depicting several new and controversial hypotheses of character evolution with regard to bilateral symmetry, central nervous system, segmentation, and steroid receptors. PDA: last
common protostome-deuterostome ancestor; CNS: central nervous system. Filled bars indicate the origin of a character while
open bars in the same colour indicate loss of that character. Open grey bars show that data for the assumed loss of steroid
receptors are missing.

Similarly, lineage-specific gene losses in some model
organisms can obscure ancient orthology relationships
among genes. For example, a steroid receptor gene has
been discovered in the mollusc Aplysia, but no orthologues are known from the fully sequenced genomes of
the invertebrates C. elegans and D. melanogaster [13].
Instead, the sequence was most similar to that of the
human estrogen receptor. Much in line with another
study [39] these results suggest the unexpected evolution
of genes for the major receptor types, such as steroid
receptors and thyroid hormone receptors, very early in

metazoan history at the base of the Bilateria. Nuclear
receptor genes would then be far older than previously
thought, with an estimated origin for the protostome-deuterostome split of approximately 960 milllion years ago
[40]. Under this hypothesis one has to assume that these
genes, previously thought to be vertebrate innovations,
were lost independently in several bilaterian lineages (Fig.
1). The most extensive gene losses of ancestral gene families have been reported in C. elegans and D. melanogaster,
with 31.0% and 25.8%, respectively [14,41]. However,
the sparse taxon sampling presently hampers a thorough

Mechanisms of regulatory evolution
Mechanisms of regulatory evolution. The diagram depicts the two possible modes of regulatory changes that generate novel
developmental control mechanisms. New domains of gene activation are achieved by the gain of a novel regulatory element or
the gain of an upstream transcription factor (right). If such novel regulatory wiring follows a gene duplication, it may liberate
protein evolution and open a developmental trajectory towards co-option (m/M = mesodermal enhancer/transcription factor.
e/E = ectodermal enhancer /transcription factor).

analysis and more informative interpretation of character
changes, as does the fact that some critical nodes in metazoan phylogeny are still unresolved [42-44].
The above considerations imply that the ancestral metazoan might have contained many more genes than previously thought (see also [45] on opsin genes, and [36] on
the wnt gene family in sea anemones). The similarity in
the genomic repertoire between some invertebrate and
human sequences can be explained by the atypical condition (i.e., rapid divergence) of the commonly used model
organisms [14,15]. Another important point is whether
genes shared between morphologically simple and complex organisms suggest that their ancestor already had the
developmental programmes that are now implemented,
for example, in modern vertebrates. In several cases, and
especially for the corals, it seems more likely that many
genes in simple organisms are confined to a single role,
probably the ancestral role, while they acquired additional functions later in evolution, which allowed for
greater complexity in the organism. Many nuclear receptor genes did probably not yet have their present function
in the organisms in which they first occurred [39].

Evolutionary Genetics of Morphological
Novelties
In order to understand how novel characters can arise at
the cellular level it is important to study the history of the
genes involved and their regulatory interactions. An
apparent paradox is that the morphological novelty we
observe at the level of different animal phyla is not always
reflected in similar changes of gene composition and
sequence divergence of the genes controlling development. Instead, the emergence of evolutionary novelties
largely appears to be based on the CO-OPTION of already
existing genes for new functions. One molecular mechanism acting at the gene level is the acquisition of new regulatory sequences that leads to novel patterns of
transcriptional activation [7,22,23,46]. As a consequence,
new genes can be recruited into existing regulatory gene
networks and result in functional changes to the network.
Genes may gain novel expression domains by chance
mutations or recombination events in their cis-regulatory
elements. Alternatively, changes in the expression of
upstream transcription factors themselves can initiate activation of target genes in new domains (Fig. 2). When
combined with an increase in gene family size through
duplications, the acquisition of novel functions in the
duplicates (sub- or neo-functionalization) by co-option

Page 4 of 17

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:15

[47] is a powerful mechanism to increase the pool of
developmental building blocks (modules).
The mechanism of co-option is facilitated by the modular
character of gene interactions. MODULARITY has become
one of the central paradigms of molecular evolutionary
biology [48,49]. This concept proposes the use of preexisting building blocks in novel ways, rather than the origin of completely new elements, as the main source of
molecular and regulatory innovations [48,50,51]. In a
gene-based, developmental context it suggests that individual genes together perform a given "network function"
(e.g., the RTK-Ras or wnt pathways) [52]. Such modules
can be visualized as being composed of a set of interacting
genes that can associate in novel ways with other modules, forming networks of higher level organization. This
gene-set, also called the 'GENETIC TOOLKIT', determines
the overall body plan and the number, identity and pattern of body parts [53]. It appears that the evolution of
metazoan development and body plans is based on an
increase in the complexity of the control circuitry regulating an ancestral toolkit of genes, rather than on the invention of novel developmental genes [17]. Extensive
comparisons of gene functions in relation to animal evolutionary history will be needed to uncover the ancestral
functions of these toolkit genes. Present-day organisms
that have retained a particular gene are good candidates
for reconstructing ancestral character states if they exhibit
shared functions (or consensus functions) [15]. Another
possibility to consider is that the ancestral function might
have become lost in the course of evolution.
Proteins required for mineralization were co-opted for
vertebrate-specific innovations
One particularly instructive example illustrates this idea.
Major transitions in evolution are often accompanied by
phylum-specific innovations, such as the occurrence of
mineralized tissue in vertebrates [54], which was fundamental to the radiation of modern vertebrates. Its development enabled the evolution of endoskeleton, body
armour and teeth, thereby providing adaptive phenotypes
for improved locomotion, protection and predation,
respectively. At the heart of this tissue type are members of
the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP)
gene family, which produce the special ionic conditions
in the extracellular matrix required for skeletal mineralization. How did this gene family evolve, and what was its
likely ancestral function in invertebrates? The SCPP gene
family has been traced back to an ancestral gene, SPARC
(encoding a non-collagenous bone matrix protein),
present in both protostomes and deuterostomes [20].
Tetrapod SCPPs arose from SPARC by several gene duplications followed by co-option for new functions (Fig. 3),
and include genes for enamel, dentin/bone, as well as
milk caseins and salivary proteins in mammals [55]. Birds

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

have an eggshell SCPP but lack the genes for enamel, milk
and salivary-associated proteins, probably reflecting the
loss of teeth in birds and the evolution of mammary
glands in mammals [56]. SPARC homologues have been
identified in a variety of invertebrates where they influence cell behaviour and interactions with the extracellular
matrix, rather than being involved in the generation of
mineralized tissues. Thus, an evolutionary modification
of these proteins seems likely to have occurred through a
functional shift from facilitating the stabilization of structural proteins towards enabling more diverse interactions
between cells and proteins of the extracellular matrix in
the course of vertebrate evolution.
Regulatory DNA evolution in invertebrates
Significant morphological transformations in the body
plan of invertebrates have been found to correlate with
developmental changes of Hox gene expression patterns
[57,58]. Interestingly, as two examples in molluscs demonstrate, some of these changes are not related to the characteristic Hox function of establishing pattern along the
anteroposterior axis. In the gastropod Haliotis asinina, two
Hox genes (Has-Hox1 and Has-Hox4) are expressed in the
mantle margin, where they have been co-opted into a new
developmental role in shell formation [59]. Since morphological novelties derived from the ancestral molluscan
body plan are striking in cephalopods, it seems promising
to explore the molecular mechanisms of cephalopod
innovations. For example, patterns of Hox expression in
the squid Euprymna scolopes strengthen the argument that
co-option events are often associated with the origin of
new morphological structures [58]. The acquisition of
three innovations derived from the ancestral molluscan
foot, namely brachial crown, funnel tube and stellate ganglia, could be ascribed to Hox gene recruitment during
cephalopod evolution. Given the large diversity of molluscan body plans, it has been suggested that this morphological flexibility may result from a relaxation of
regulatory constraints on the recruitment of morphological patterning genes [58].

Not surprisingly, variation at the species level is also frequently based upon changes to gene regulation. Expression of the yellow gene at the wing tips of the fruitfly
Drosophila biarmipes, a species closely related to D. melanogaster, results in conspicuous black pigment spots. It
was shown that, for the evolution of this pigment pattern,
the gene's regulatory sequences had gained additional
binding sites for highly conserved transcription factors
[60]. When experimentally introduced into D. melanogaster, these regulatory elements are capable of driving
reporter gene expression (and thus yellow expression) in
the distal-anterior region of the wing. Interestingly,
among those newly evolved binding sites is one for the
transcription factor engrailed, which perfectly illustrates

Evolution of the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene family involving gene duplication and co-option
Evolution of the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene family involving gene duplication and co-option. A
duplication event of an ancestral SPARC gene (1) in the vertebrate lineage generated two paralogues (2), and one of these
(SPARCL1) gave rise to the SCPP gene family through subsequent tandem gene duplications after the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fish (3). In mammals, the formation of tooth and bone tissue is based upon the presence of various members of
the SCPP gene family, including genes for enamel SCPPs, dentin/bone SCPPs, as well as milk caseins and salivary proteins. Most
of these are closely linked on one chromosome in humans, as shown in the diagram.

how regulatory pathways already present in the wing have
been co-opted to control wing pigmentation through
chance mutations of ancestral enhancer sequences. It certainly is an appealing concept that the combinatorial
nature of transcriptional regulation creates a large reservoir for morphological diversity, and may provide more
variation for natural selection than changes in the gene
product alone. Changes in the cis-regulatory systems of
genes may therefore be more significant than changes in
gene number or protein function [19].

Developmental innovations through protein sequence
evolution
Examples in which evolutionary changes in gene regulation lead to morphological changes are numerous [61],
yet there are also a number of well studied cases in which
changes in protein sequence have been linked to new
adaptations (reviewed by [46]). Since many genes have
pleiotropic functions, changes to their protein sequence
are potentially deleterious. Thus most cases involve gene
duplications, as exemplified above for the SPARC gene
family, or alternative splicing, in which one copy retains
its function while the other acquires a new one. In the latter case, even mutations resulting from detrimental mechanisms, such as frameshift mutations, have been shown to

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:15

be retained for up to hundreds of millions of years and
have evolved new protein functions [62]. Finally, changes
to protein-protein interactions can lead to alterations in
developmental mechanisms, by integrating novel
regulators into existing pathways, or by eliminating old
ones. For example, the transcription factor brachyury is
expressed in the circumference of the blastopore of most
animal phyla and its orthologues from most Bilateria are
capable of inducing mesoderm when assayed in Xenopus
animal caps; however, in this assay, brachyury orthologues
from Drosophila and tunicates strongly induce formation
of both mesoderm and endoderm, and this is strictly correlated with the loss of a short protein-protein interaction
motif, N-terminal of the DNA-binding domain [63].
Interestingly, insects and tunicates have not only lost circumferential blastopore brachyury expression independently, but also have a derived mode of gastrulation which
is largely independent of brachyury. Messenger et al. [64]
have recently identified Smadl as the cofactor that binds
to the conserved brachyury N-terminal peptide and inhibits endoderm induction. The possibility therefore exists
that this repression module, which is absent in the diploblastic Hydra, evolved in the bilaterians to separate mesoderm from mesendoderm. In Drosophila and tunicates,
these tissue types are derived from topologically separate
regions, and the derived mode of development may have
relaxed the selective pressure required to maintain this
motif. It is evident that in the future many more such
examples will be found that are associated with the gain
or loss of a particular structure or mode of development.

Phylogeny, Homology, and Gene Expression
Patterns
Given sufficient periods of evolutionary time a certain
gene or gene cascade may be conserved within a lineage,
yet might be highly divergent among lineages. Therefore,
while examining the different roles of conserved versus
co-opted developmental mechanisms, it is important to
recognize that conservation (lack of change) is a relative
term whose interpretation depends on the selection of the
appropriate phylogenetic framework. Knowledge about
the phylogenetic relationships among model organisms
and their relatives will thus substantially improve the
understanding of developmental processes and uncover
general evolutionary patterns [32,65-67]. Phylogenies are
statements not only of relationships among taxa, but also
about the evolution of characters along the tree. Mapping
characters onto a robust phylogeny is a good way to determine if those characters may be homologous [34].
The basic concepts
Homology as a historical concept is typically defined as
the shared inheritance of a trait from a most recent common ancestor (e.g., eyes of fish and mammals; Fig. 4A),
though plain similarity has inadequately been used in a

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

number of instances (for further discussions see
[24,25,68,69]). HISTORICAL HOMOLOGY can be
applied to different levels of biological organization,
including morphological structures, developmental processes, and genes [23]. Abouheif [70] suggested a hierarchical analysis of homology relationships, which is designed
to reveal alternative evolutionary hypotheses, for example
the recruitment of homologous genes and networks to
function in convergent embryonic and morphological
structures (e.g., eyes of vertebrates and insects; Fig 4A).
Gene family phylogenies can further be used to indicate if
genes are orthologous (arose by speciation and thus are
homologous in the strict sense) or paralogous (arose by
gene duplication). On the other hand, the concept of
GENERATIVE HOMOLOGY (Fig. 4A), or syngeny, uses
shared developmental pathways to imply that a given
character is generated by the same genetic machinery
inherited from a common ancestor [71]. Wilkinson [6]
has recently expanded this idea to use a combination of
shared key genes (one or more) plus a shared biological or
developmental function for which those genes are crucial
as an indicator of homology. Both these concepts incorporate the view that the continuity of inheritance of the
potential to make a particular trait rather than the continuity of its appearance is what matters most in homologous relationships [72]. The phylogenetic re-appearance
of characters (reversal) is often observed even in well
established phylogenies, therefore the genetic potential to
produce those characters is probably retained, a phenomenon which can be referred to as 'LATENT HOMOLOGY'
[69,73] or 'REAWAKENING' [66] (Fig. 4B). Whenever
using the term homology it is important to state explicitly
which type, subset, or level of homology is alluded to
[24,69,74], and to work within a well-defined phylogenetic framework.
The concept of homology is undoubtedly challenged
when it comes to tracking down the evolutionary origins
of developmental programmes [24,71,74,75], and the use
of gene expression patterns to infer homology is a matter
of intense debate [5,23,76]. Of particular difficulty is how
to distinguish superficial similarity from phylogenetic
information content. As an important rule, comparisons
of gene expression patterns to assess homology hypotheses should be restricted to orthologous gene copies, since
new expression domains evolving among paralogues are
likely to be convergent (Fig. 5). These gene relationships
may be complex and thus need to be tested based on a
phylogenetic tree including the whole gene family by
identification of the timing of speciation events relative to
gene duplications [23] (Fig. 5). An analysis of the Snail/
Slug gene family revealed functional modifications after
the original copy had become duplicated during vertebrate evolution. In addition, the study demonstrated
unexpected evolutionary changes in Snail/Slug expression

Homology relationships at different hierarchical levels of biological organization (ge: gene; gn: gene network; gi: gene
interactions in the network; e: embryonic origin; m: morphological structure) following the suggestions detailed by
Abouheif [65]. (A) Functioning of homologous genes in structures of independent evolutionary origin. In insect and vertebrate eyes, a very similar genetic machinery is used to
generate structures that are historically non-homologous and
morphologically dissimilar. Note that this generative homology is different from latent homology (B) in that the latter is
concerned with morphologically homologous structures.
This figure illustrates the difference between two main concepts, historical vs. generative homology. (B) Latent homology or re-awakening. If morphologically homologous
characters, such as arthropod compound eyes [104], have
multiple independent origins on a phylogeny then this may be
due to retained genetic programmes that are not expressed
in some of the ancestors, but whose functionality has been
recovered after further speciation, giving the incorrect
impression of convergent evolution. (C) Partial homology of
gene networks. Novel genes (V, W, X, Y) are recruited into
an ancestral network consisting of genes A, B, and C in two
different lineages of taxa (a+b and e). Thus, the black part of
the network is homologous (inherited from a common
ancestor) while the coloured segments are not.

domains, which imply a large degree of plasticity and
highlight the risk of using expression or function as
homology indicators when studying the evolution of gene
families [32]. Patterns of gene expression are particularly
complicated to interpret in terms of homology because
they interconnect different levels of biological
organization, in this case genes and morphological structures [23]. Conserved expression patterns do not necessarily indicate conservation of gene function, and we know
today that homologous genes can be expressed in structures that have different evolutionary origin (thus are
non-homologous), such as distal-less in animal appendages [76] (see also previous sections for more examples).
Likewise, similar developmental roles may be the result of
convergent evolution [25]. To overcome some of these
difficulties and ambiguities in terminology, the term
HOMOCRACY was recently proposed to describe organs/
structures that are governed by identical patterning genes
[76]. It is important to note that a given structure can be
both homocratic and homologous, thus the two terms are
not mutually exclusive (Fig. 5).
Gene network evolution
Behind the scenes are complex interacting gene networks
(pathways) that form the genetic machinery required for
the origin and functioning of morphological structures.

The use of phylogenetic testing in the study of gene expression patterns and to infer ancestral developmental roles. A mixture
of orthologous and paralogous genes is included in this phylogenetic tree, therefore reflecting gene relationships rather than
relationships of taxa. The phylogeny of taxa can be inferred by analyzing either set of orthologous genes. The two lineages (A
and B) of orthologous gene copies are shown in capital letters, and the B lineage is additionally highlighted in grey, while recent
paralogues are numbered. Triangles, squares and hexagons indicate gene expression in three tissues/organs, which are grouped
by superficial similarity as primary homology hypothesis. Homocratic structures are defined by co-expression of identical patterning genes, but these can be either orthologues or paralogues. In the latter case they do not strengthen a homology hypothesis because convergent evolution is likely (as in the depicted case).

These networks can be considered a distinct level of biological organization, the homology relationships of
which may differ from other such levels [22,70]. However,
some authors have dismissed the strictly hierarchical view
of biology calling for a combinatorial approach to
homology [74,77], because interactive combinatorial
processes, such as co-option and modularity, play a significant role in biological systems. One consequence of this

would be to accept that homology assessments cannot be
reduced to a yes-or-no question even at the molecular
level [74,78]. The obvious problem is how much (and
which parts) of a given entity, for instance a gene network,
must be continuous between lineages. Clearly, two networks are homologous if all genes and their interactions
are derived from an identical network in the most recent
common ancestor. Quite often networks share certain ele-

ments but differ in others, and thus they are neither fully
homologous nor independently evolved; rather, they
might be considered partially homologous. The
recruitment of novel genes into an existing regulatory
gene network, for instance, will lead to partial homology
(Fig. 4C). As a consequence, gene expression patterns
need to be evaluated at the level of gene networks to reveal
their true evolutionary relationships [70,79]. Studying
closely related species in a phylogenetic context is helpful
in this case, because smaller changes are expected, and this
knowledge can then be used to connect more ancient
character states. For example, the wing patterning network
in Drosophila is well studied, and when the expression patterns of its constituent genes in wingless castes of ants
were compared, the results provided surprising insights
into the evolution of wing polyphenism: several closely
related species do not share a common mechanism to
interrupt wing development in the wingless castes, which
is an unexpected finding given that a common origin of
all wingless castes can be assumed [33].
Similar expression patterns do not necessarily indicate
homology
We have emphasized along with other authors [5,73,76]
that gene expression patterns should not be used to infer
morphological homology of structures without employing phylogenetic criteria to test hypotheses about orthology of genes as well as partial homology, or convergence
of gene networks. In addition, genes that are expressed
during basic cellular processes, such as cell proliferation
or epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, are likely to be frequently utilized in non-homologous organs. As they have
a high developmental and evolutionary constraint, they
are not informative to support homology of structures.
Conversely, if homology of structures is to be based upon
gene expression, members of the genetic toolkit should be
consulted, as they control diverse and general patterning
processes. Some recent studies that seem to indicate deep
homologies in the body plan of animal phyla, although
employing this latter strategy, should nevertheless be
interpreted with caution. For example, Lowe et al. [80]
proposed that a comparable expression pattern in the
nervous system of chordates, hemichordates and Drosophila is an indication of homology (at least 14 out of 22
genes involved in neural patterning), suggesting that the
ancestor of deuterostomes (and probably all bilaterians)
had a diffuse nervous system that was centralized independently in arthropods and chordates (Fig. 1). This idea
disagrees with the prevailing theory of a single origin of
the central nervous system with a dorsoventral axis inversion, which is supported by the inversion of TGFβ-signalling in chordates and Drosophila [81]. The example further
illustrates the undesirable fact that there is no obvious
boundary as to which number of genes need to be coexpressed to proclaim a structure homologous, i.e., would

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

10 out of 22 genes still justify homology of these nervous
systems? As with morphological analyses, similarity measures cannot be used as evidence to indicate common
descent, and are thus incongruent with the concept of
homology. Such approaches are clearly phenetic and by
no means phylogenetic. In another example, the use of
homologous genes to achieve bilateral symmetry in larvae
of sea anemones was used to infer that bilaterality originated before the split of Cnidaria and Bilateria [82] (Fig.
1). But is bilateral symmetry of sea anemones really
homologous to that observed in more derived animals or
did it arise by convergent evolution [83]? To answer this
question we concur with Holland [31] that if orthologous
genes are used to control the development of a similar
structure in two otherwise morphologically different animals, this lends some support to the hypothesis of homology but is in itself not sufficient and requires more
rigorous tests. Further, early metazoan interrelationships
have remained particularly difficult to understand, once
more stressing the importance of phylogenetic certainty in
relation to the co-option or homology question.
Nevertheless, one adequate method of testing morphological homology hypotheses by using gene expression
data has recently been proposed [84]. This approach
involves the investigation of changes in developmental
systems in a parsimony analyses by mapping gene expression data onto a phylogenetic tree along with other characters. Different homology hypotheses can then be
evaluated in terms of the number of evolutionary steps
required for each hypothesis to be valid, and the most parsimonious solution (involving the smallest number of
steps) can be identified. An example can be seen in Figure
5, depicting a single co-option event leading to shared
gene expression in organ 2 in frog and mouse. This supports the homology of organ 2 in these two species. But if
instead we were to assume organ 2 in frog as being homologous to organ 3 in mouse, then two independent
changes in gene expression would be required (gain of the
purple hexagon and loss of the orange square in organ 3
to explain the observed gene expression pattern), which
would be less parsimonious and thus would not support
this homology relationship. In this way, several competing homology hypotheses can be compared in a combined analysis including many genes and other characters
[84]. In general, whenever a co-option event can be indentified as a SYNAPOMORPHY for a set of taxa, it should be
informative to support the homology of a structure. Gene
expression data could also be useful to distinguish
between convergence and re-awakening, as in the former
case we expect distinguishing features to reflect different
origins of two independently evolved structures while in
the latter we do not (see also chapter on the retention of
genetic programmes).

What does Shared Genetic Potential suggest:
Conserved Developmental Programmes or
Repeated Evolution?
Despite growing evidence for a widespread conservation
of the genetic toolkit that is used to produce the complex
body plan of bilaterian animals, there is reason to believe
that the last common ancestor (Urbilateria) did not necessarily employ the same developmental programmes of
extant animals. One principal idea is that the function of
many homologous developmental genes in a last common ancestor was of the same general kind as now
observed, but in a different developmental context [4].
Conserved genes, or entire networks (modules), might
have been co-opted repeatedly into new regulatory
regions or morphological structures. If the available
genetic toolkit is of limited size, then the possibility of cooption for similar functions, i.e., the repeated evolution of
analogous developmental processes, does not appear
unlikely [76]. For instance, the homeobox gene distal-less
(dll) and its vertebrate homologue dlx are expressed across
extant animals in various types of appendages (e.g., vertebrate limbs and echinoderm tube feet) that are clearly
non-homologous [22,85]. Shared functions of dll genes
among animal phyla are few and very general, so that the
consensus function is reduced to a general role in regulating cell proliferation [76]. Hence, the bilaterian ancestor
probably had no legs but perhaps some inconspicuous
body wall outgrowths triggered by dll expression. Cooption of this pre-existing mechanism into more specific
building blocks (e.g., for structures that grow out distally
but are historically non-homologous), could have subsequently occurred during the evolution of different animal
phyla.
It is currently intensely debated whether segmentation in
different animal phyla has had a common origin or not
[28,29,85-88]. Specifically, the question is whether the
last common protostome-deuterostome ancestor was
already segmented or whether segmentation arose on
three separate occasions in arthropods, annelids and vertebrates (Fig. 1). Current views on this have partly
changed towards the 'single origin of segmentation'
hypothesis due to the finding that notch and delta genes
participate in the segmentation of both spiders and
vertebrates [26]. By contrast, segmentation in Drosophila is
notch and delta independent. The more basal phylogenetic
position of spiders in relation to Drosophila suggests a
derived mode of segmentation in the latter [34], and thus
allows the evaluation of more distant ancestors within the
arthropod clade. Similarly, the arthropod-like expression
pattern of engrailed and wingless genes in segment
formation of the annelid Platynereis points to a segmented
ancestor of all protostomes [27]. However, there are also
reasonable objections to the 'single origin of segmentation' hypothesis (e.g., for parsimony reasons [89]). Part of

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

the problem might reside in the definition of segmentation since some authors relax the definition to include
other repeated structures, such as paired coeloms in echinoderms, which would render the lack of segmentation
an uncommon trait throughout the animal kingdom
[29,34]. Furthermore, segmentation is a mesodermal
process in annelids and vertebrates, whereas in arthropods it is primarily ectodermal [88]. It is therefore conceivable that the same deeply conserved modules have
been co-opted for similar functions many times, giving
rise not only to the morphologically quite different types
of animal segmentation but also to segmented tissues of
different embryonic origin found among metazoans. Segmentation would then be a case of repeated evolution not
implying the existence of a segmented Urbilateria.
The way in which Pax6 and its associated genes are
involved in eye development across the Metazoa suggests
a shared genetic potential for the occurrence of eyes [90].
Yet the phylogenetic pattern of the distribution of eye
structures (adopting the concept that a simple photoreceptor is not an image-forming eye [91]) is clearly
polyphyletic, which indicates multiple independent origins from forms lacking eye development [91,92] (Fig
4A). The current situation most likely reflects successive
losses and gains of the use of the Pax6 network during the
evolution of metazoan animals [6]. Some authors have
suggested that Pax6 has become integrated into several
independently evolved genetic programmes to regulate
particular aspects of eye development [76,93,94], rather
than being a master regulator of eye development [95].
Therefore, repeated utilization of similar genetic pathways
involving pre-existing building blocks may emerge as a
common theme in animal evolutionary history. Completely new morphological structures can likewise evolve
by the integration of independent anatomical entities,
e.g., cell populations, which differ in their structure and
tissue of origin. According to recent evidence the vertebrate eye is a compound structure comprising two types of
light-sensitive cells (rhabdomeric and ciliary receptors)
with independent evolutionary histories [45]. The presence of ciliary photoreceptors containing an opsin similar
to those of vertebrates in the brain of the ragworm Platynereis (Annelida) suggests that both receptor types were
present in Urbilateria. Thus, it is straightforward to propose that vertebrate and invertebrate eyes are partially
homologous since they contain homologous (e.g., rhabdomeric photoreceptors) and non-homologous cell types
derived from different germ layers.

Testing Evolutionary Hypotheses
The study of character evolution has become one of the
central aspects in modern phylogenetic analysis due to its
power to reveal and test different evolutionary hypotheses
[96,97]. One of the essential prerequisites of this

Figure 6
Phylogenetic character distributions that would support developmental bias
Phylogenetic character distributions that would support developmental bias. (A) Convergence – If certain characters appear
repeatedly in a phylogeny despite the obvious absence of exogenous selective causes, this may suggest an evolution biased by
development. A possible example are the horizontal bar patterns evolved in parallel in Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi cichlids (indicated by black hashmarks), for which similar developmental mechanisms might be used. (B) Phylogenetic inertia (or
constraints) – If characters show significant resistance against evolutionary change despite substantial environmental heterogeneity, then at least part of these constraints may be developmentally induced. Different species-rich tribes of East African cichlids show a relatively conservative number of spines of the dorsal fin (Ectodini: 12–15 with the exception of Enantiopus having
16–19; Lamprologini: 17–24, indicated by red hashmarks) and of the anal fin (Ectodini and most other cichlids: 3; Lamprologini:
4 or more [98], indicated by grey and black hashmarks) despite having evolved manifold body shapes.

approach, however, is that for those tests to be valid one
needs to work within a highly resolved and robust phylogenetic framework. Not only can simple character changes
and homology relationships be investigated but also the
existence of controversial evolutionary mechanisms. This
is particularly useful for assessing conceptual problems in
evolutionary developmental biology.
Developmental bias
It has been suggested that evolution can be biased by
development in that, starting with a particular ontogeny,
some phenotypes might be easily produced while others
are unlikely or even impossible [1,7]. This idea is also perfectly compatible with the parsimony principle, since an
already existing structure will more likely be used for a
new purpose rather than a whole new structure will evolve
for the same purpose, i.e., instead of evolving gills whales
adapted the respiratory mechanisms of their lungs [8].
Thus, it appears that mutation and selection are not the
only forces that have shaped the 'possible creatures'
inhabiting this planet. In order to assess the significance
of DEVELOPMENTAL BIAS as an evolutionary mechanism one can devise hypothetical character distributions
on a phylogeny that would support this notion. Two main
categories of character evolution in which developmental

bias could have played a major role can be perceived (Fig
6.). Firstly, the convergent evolution of a character
towards a similar morphology, such as colour patterns in
Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi cichlids, may be indicative of biased evolution or selection (Fig. 6A). Secondly,
a tree topology that suggests phylogenetic constraints
(also known as PHYLOGENETIC INERTIA) may imply
that at least part of this pattern may be due to developmental constraints. For instance, several tribes of cichlids
often show relatively constant ranges in the number of
spines of their dorsal and anal fins [98] (Fig. 6B). In general, phylogenetic constraints refer to taxon-specific limitations forcing a taxon into certain combinations of
characters regardless of where that taxon occurs, i.e., an
explicitly non-adaptive interpretation [99,100]. There are
several methods available to test for phylogenetic inertia,
such as autocorrelational analysis and phylogenetic correlograms [100,101].
Once a phylogenetic pattern of character distribution that
is suggestive of biased evolution has been established, the
problem arises how to distinguish developmental bias
from highly similar selection pressures. This is by no
means an easy task and will certainly present a great challenge for the future. One possible test for this could be to

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:15

rule out adaptive explanations for certain morphologies
by employing character correlation analysis with environmental variables and to estimate fitness values to test for
actual selection. Another approach could be based on the
assumption that the likelihood of bias increases with the
number of species showing that particular morphology in
relation to evolutionary distance. Though theoretically
well explored [8], available evidence for developmental
bias is presently scarce, and probably the most convincing
example is that of the 3,000 and more species of centipedes all have odd numbers of leg-bearing segments. To
invoke selection for this phenomenon seems unreasonable [102]. Further, floral symmetry patterns in
angiosperms have been proposed as an example for biasled evolution [103].
Retention of genetic programmes
In evolution, certain structures may be lost and later reappear yet the genetic potential to produce those structures may be retained, even though the structures are not
continuously present in all ancestors (Fig 4B). This observation has become known as latent homology or re-awakening [66,69,73]. Re-awakening may represent a valid
hypothesis in cases where phylogenetic character distributions suggest the reappearance of a character that would
be considered homologous on morphological grounds.
Many instances of reversals that appear in robust phylogenies might actually be hidden cases of latent homology
[69]. There are, however, only a few not extremely wellsupported examples of this phenomenon but methods
could be established to test for this interesting case of
silencing and re-expressing of genetic pathways more
meticulously. If dormant genes can be re-activated after
further speciation, we expect high similarities in the
developmental systems between the lost and the regained
structure, i.e., these structures should be generatively
homologous. The most convincing way of testing for reawakening after having established a reliable character
evolution would be to demonstrate the functionality of
the genetic programme by experimental induction of the
putatively re-evolved trait in the species that do not
exhibit the trait.

Several species in the genus Xiphophorus display a so-called
sword, which is a sexually selected extension of the ventral
tail fin. The molecular phylogeny shows that the sword
was lost once and later re-evolved at least twice in different branches, which suggests re-awakening of the 'sworddeveloping' programme [66]. Further, swords could be
induced in some of these naturally sword-less species
through testosterone treatment, thereby making a much
stronger case for this hypothesis. It should be noted, however, that swords could also be induced by artificial selection in more distantly related species and that the sword
as a morphological structure is rather loosely defined.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

In arthropods, there is molecular phylogenetic evidence
for the independent origin of compound eyes (Fig. 4B).
Myocopids are the only group within the Ostracoda
(Crustacea) that have compound eyes, and these are
nested phylogenetically within several groups that lack
this kind of eye [104]. Maximum likelihood methods of
ancestral-state reconstruction were highly significant in
supporting the independent origin of compound eyes
from eyeless ancestors. However, the ommatidia of many
diverse groups of arthropods (including the Maxillopoda
as outgroup to Ostracoda) have an arrangement of photoreceptive cells different from the regained eyes in ostracods, which casts some doubt on their homology from a
morphological point of view. It will be interesting to
know whether the same genetic pathways are used to produce these slightly different types of compound eyes, i.e.,
if they are generatively homologous, which would
strengthen the case for re-awakening.
A recent example from stick insects suggests that wings
have re-evolved as many as four times during the radiation of this group [105]. An alternative interpretation
would involve 13 independent occasions of wing loss,
which is the less parsimonious solution (requiring more
evolutionary changes). But accepting the alternative
hypothesis would not appear implausible if a different
method of CHARACTER OPTIMIZATION were used, i.e.,
one that assumes loss to be more likely than re-appearance [34]. This example shows that care has to be taken
while establishing the basic requirement for re-awakening, which is a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of character evolution. In addition, phylogenies based on
morphological characters will be affected in a negative
way by re-awakening because the reappearing character
causes homoplasy and will be incongruent with other
characters. Although re-appearance of a character using
the same genetic machinery is evolutionarily truly parsimonious, conflicting hypotheses may arise when
applying the parsimony principle for phylogenetic tree
construction in such cases.
The importance of phylogenetic taxon sampling
To determine the mode and direction of character evolution in a phylogeny most commonly the outgroup comparison is used [96,97]. The outgroup constitutes a species
set that is as closely related to the ingroup as possible but
must not be part of the ingroup. Shared character states
between ingroup and outgroup indicate the ancestral state
of a character, for example using frogs as outgroup to reptiles shows that having four legs is an ancestral trait. Very
often only a single species is used as outgroup, which can
be misleading if this particular species is not representative for the whole group – it is obvious that caecilian
amphibians would not be good candidates to infer ancestral character states for limb development. In order to

Page 13 of 17

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:15

draw firm conclusions on ancestral character states extensive taxon sampling should be performed so that ingroup
and outgroup contain a broad range of evolutionarily
informative (i.e., phenotypically diverse) species. As a
consequence, reliably defining ancestral character states in
a phylogeny is impossible without the aid of non-model
organisms since the typical model systems are often not
characteristic for an entire clade, i.e., often show a high
proportion of advanced character states. A good example
for this comes from the Hox genes of C. elegans [106],
which, as a member of the ecdysozoan clade, was
expected to have a relatively large number of these genes.
However, the investigation of a representative range of
taxa shows a prominent loss of Hox genes during nematode evolution in which the most derived state (at least
five Hox genes fewer than most other Ecdysozoa) was
observed in the model C. elegans.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/15

representatives. In many fields of research, especially in
medical applications, conclusions still tend to be drawn
from a small number of model systems, though there is
clear evidence that integration of many species sheds new
light onto old questions. The Cnidaria and Porifera are
good candidates in the hunt for new genetic inventions
[14,36,109], as these two phyla are basal to the Bilaterians. Sponges (Porifera) possess the most basic features of
the metazoan bodyplan. Thus, comparative genomics
including this animal group emerge as a promising tool to
gain insights into the genetic architecture of the hypothetical Urmetazoa as the earliest common ancestor of all
metazoans [110,111]. Further studies in this direction will
finally be able to reveal the minimal toolkit assembly for
metazoan animals, and open up new research avenues in
the evo-devo field.

Authors' contributions
The attempt to reconstruct more gradual sequences of
change emerges as a general requirement to deduce reliable conclusions on evolutionary events. This is also the
case when studying the relationship of molecular changes
and phenotypic evolution. Hox gene expression in crustaceans was found to be tightly correlated with alterations in
morphology in that a shift in the anterior-posterior border
of Ubx expression coincides with the occurrence of feeding
appendages (maxillipeds). The latter could be demonstrated by investigating different evolutionary stages represented by seven genera from six crustacean orders [57].
Without sampling those intermediates, which often are
"minor" taxa, false correlations between molecular and
morphological evolution are expected because multiple
character changes will be compressed into a single event
on a phylogenetic tree [34]. This highlights the importance of reaching confidence on ancestral nodes as the
crucial point in interpreting character evolution.

Conclusion
Understanding the high degree of conservation in genes
and gene cascades on one hand, and the large morphological diversity on the other will be a great challenge. Molecular evolutionary analyses will have to focus more on the
interaction context of gene networks and the concept of
modularity rather than on individual genes [49,107]. It
also emphasizes the need for correctly assessing the degree
of homology vs. homoplasy in defining common components of developmental pathways. For many questions in
comparative biology, and also in evo-devo research, the
availability of a well-supported phylogeny among the
study organisms is of paramount importance. Phylogenomic approaches (using multiple gene loci sequence
data) to display evolutionary relationships among model
organisms will certainly appear more frequently [43,108].
One obvious drawback of these studies is that data are
available for only a small number of taxonomic
