Abstract
Background: The alphaproteobacterium Wolbachia pipientis, the most common endosymbiont in eukaryotes, is
found predominantly in insects including many Drosophila species. Although Wolbachia is primarily vertically
transmitted, analysis of its genome provides evidence for frequent horizontal transfer, extensive recombination and
numerous mobile genetic elements. The genome sequence of Wolbachia in Drosophila simulans Riverside (wRi) is
available along with the integrated bacteriophages, enabling a detailed examination of phage genes and the role
of these genes in the biology of Wolbachia and its host organisms. Wolbachia is widely known for its ability to
modify the reproductive patterns of insects. One particular modification, cytoplasmic incompatibility, has previously
been shown to be dependent on Wolbachia density and inversely related to the titer of lytic phage. The wRi
genome has four phage regions, two WORiBs, one WORiA and one WORiC.
Results: In this study specific primers were designed to distinguish between these four prophage types in wRi, and
quantitative PCR was used to measure the titer of bacteriophages in testes, ovaries, embryos and adult flies. In all
tissues tested, WORiA and WORiB were not found to be present in excess of their integrated prophages; WORiC,
however, was found to be present extrachromosomally. WORiC is undergoing extrachromosomal replication in wRi.
The density of phage particles was found to be consistent in individual larvae in a laboratory population. The
WORiC genome is organized in conserved blocks of genes and aligns most closely with other known lytic WO
phages, WOVitA and WOCauB.
Conclusions: The results presented here suggest that WORiC is the lytic form of WO in D. simulans, is undergoing
extrachromosomal replication in wRi, and belongs to a conserved family of phages in Wolbachia.

Background
Wolbachia pipientis is an obligate bacterial endosymbiont of insects with a wide distribution. It is a member
of the order Rickettsiales and is closely related to the
insect vectored mammalian pathogens Anaplasma and
Ehrlichia. Ten supergroups of Wolbachia have been
identified within the species W. pipientis [1]. Supergroups A and B are common insect symbionts which
probably diverged from one another 50-60 MYA [2].
The rapid spread of Wolbachia through insect populations is enhanced by symbiont-driven modifications to
normal host reproductive patterns which are manifested

as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis,
male killing and feminization (reviewed in [3]).
The possibility of genetically transforming fastidious
obligate intracellular bacteria and targeting them to
insect vectors of human disease has stimulated renewed
interest in Wolbachia’s bacteriophage WO. The Wolbachia of Drosophila simulans, wRi, has acquired four
prophage elements that are integrated into the bacterial
genome as 18- to 77-kb sequences, termed wRi-WO-A,
wRi-WO-B (two identical copies) and wRi-WO-C [4]. In
contrast wMel, found in Drosophila melanogaster, has
one WO-A, one WO-B and a small pyocin-like element.
All of these prophage elements are integrated into the
Wolbachia chromosome at unique sites. Masui et al [5]
were the first to demonstrate the existence of the
prophage WO in Wolbachia of the cricket Teleogryllus

taiwanemma and later in D. simulans (wCof, wRi), the
moths Ephestia kuehniella (wCauB, wCauA, wKue,
wSca) and Corcyra cepharonica (wCep) [6] by electron
microscopy and PCR. The WO prophages from Wolbachia infecting D. simulans, D. melanogaster, Culex
pipiens, T. taiwanemma, Nasonia vitripennis and E.
kuehniella have been sequenced [4,6-12]. WO phage
genome sequences from wRi, wMel, and wPip are
inferred from their respective bacterial chromosome
genome sequencing projects. WOcauB2 and WOcauB3
are two strains of WO phages infecting Wolbachia of E.
kuehniella that have been sequenced from the lytic
phase [9]. WOcauB2 has a genome of 43,016 bp encoding 47 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), whereas
WOcauB3 has a genome of 45,078 bp and 46 predicted
ORFs. With respect to WO phages, little is known
about their gene expression, lytic activity, or influence
on the phenotypic properties of their hosts.
The nomenclature surrounding the WO phages from
different Wolbachia strains varies. Originally, the phage
found in wKue was tentatively named WO [5], irrespective of how many types of integrated prophages were
present. When wMel was sequenced [10], the two
prophage inserts were named WO-A and WO-B respective to the origin of replication. Two phage types in wRi,
WO-A and WO-B, were named based on sequence
homology to the wMel phages, with the addition of one
more phage type, WO-C [4]. WOPip is present as five
integrated copies in the Wolbachia of C. pipiens and
these are designated WOPip1 through 5 [7]. They have
been reported to be more closely related to WO-B of
wMel than WO-A of wMel [7].
Bacteriophages are believed to be the mobile genetic
elements responsible for the high level of genetic diversity in Wolbachia [[10,13] and [14]] through lateral
transfer between co-infecting strains. As in other prokaryotes, prophage integration and transformation in
Wolbachia appear to be major sources of lateral gene
acquisition [15]. A group of genes present in the wRi
and wMel prophage WO-B genome is most similar to
genes found in Rickettsia [14], suggesting that interspecies horizontal transfer mediated by phages has also
occurred in an insect harboring both bacteria.
Bacteriophages can influence the level of virulence of
bacterial pathogens [16] and can change the phenotypic
properties of closely related strains of bacteria. In Wolbachia-infected Drosophila, Culex, Nasonia and other
insects, WO prophages appear to be temperate, that is,
they have an integrated prophage form and can also
generate virions which result in bacterial lysis
[6,11,15,17] and [18]. In the parasitoid wasp, N. vitripennis, Bordenstein et al used a quantitative PCR assay to
demonstrate that Wolbachia titer, which correlates with
CI intensity, is inversely related to copy number of

Page 2 of 13

temperate WOVitA [15]. This relationship, known as
the Phage Density Model, predicts that low CI strains of
Wolbachia will have a high number of phage particles,
and, conversely, high CI strains of Wolbachia will have
low titers of phage particles [15,19]. In Drosophila, however, it is not known which of the diverse prophage elements give rise to lytic viruses, how their lytic
properties are regulated, or the effect of lysis on host
phenotype. Although most tailed bacteriophages have
evolved a temperate lifestyle, it is not yet known if the
prophage elements in wRi are functional, defective,
satellite phages, or agents of gene transfer [20]. Typically, mature WO phage particles are detected using primers specific to the open reading frame encoding a
putative minor capsid protein C (ORF7) [5]. In wRi of
D. simulans, however, ORF7 is present in all four
prophage insertions [WRi_005560], [WRi_007170],
[WRi_010220], and [WRi_012630] and so the presence
of ORF7 is not a specific indicator of which phage is
active.
In this paper we measure the relative copy number of
mature, active WORiC phage particles in whole flies
and tissues of D. simulans and determine variations in
Wolbachia and WO copy number between individual
larval hosts by quantitative PCR. A comparison of the
genome architecture of known active phages WOVitA1
and WOCauB2 to WORiC identifies modules for head
assembly and DNA packaging as well as tail morphogenesis that are conserved in all known active WO
phages.

Methods
Strains and media

D. simulans (Riverside) (DSR) stocks were maintained at
room temperature on a standard diet of cornmeal, dextrose and yeast. Stocks were stably infected with a single
Wolbachia strain (wRi) and have been maintained at the
University of Alberta laboratory for approximately 6
years. The presence of Wolbachia was confirmed at regular intervals using 81F and 691R wsp primer pairs [21].
DNA extractions

DNA from whole flies and gonads was extracted from
animals that were less than 5 days post eclosion. Newly
eclosed flies were separated by sex and allowed to
develop to the appropriate age. Gonad DNA samples
were obtained from 4 groups of 100-150 testes each and
4 groups of 75-150 ovaries each. Whole fly DNA was
taken from 4 groups of 15 flies each. Three groups of
15-minute AEL (after-egg-laying) embryos were
obtained by allowing females to oviposit on egg laying
dishes made from fruit juice. Embryos were collected
and chilled every 15 minutes until approximately 200 μl
of packed embryos were obtained per replicate. The

eggs were stored at -80C until DNA extractions could
be performed.
Synchronization of larvae was accomplished by allowing several hundred females to oviposit on egg-laying
dishes for one hour. The eggs were collected and seeded
onto standard media. From these, third instar (3’) larvae
were collected and stored at -80C until DNA extraction.
DNA was extracted from all tissues and flies with the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s protocol with an extended, overnight proteinase K digestion. DNA purity and concentration was
determined using a Nanodrop ND1000.
Quantitative PCR for relative copy number

Relative copy numbers of Wolbachia and WO phage in .
D. simulans were obtained using the MiniOpticon System (Bio-Rad). The relative Wolbachia infection level
was measured by comparing the copy number of the
gene for Wolbachia surface protein, wsp, to a single
copy gene in the Drosophila genome, CuZn superoxide
dismutase (sod). Phage copy numbers were measured by
comparing the adenine methyltransferase (wMTase)
(WORiB), lyzozyme (WORiA), and tail tube protein
(WORiC) genes to wsp in wRi (see table 1 for locus tags
and primer sequences).
Reactions were performed in low profile 48-well white
plates with flat cap strips (Bio-Rad). Ten microliter reactions included 400nM of each forward and reverse primer, 5 μl of 2× Dynamite qPCR mastermix (Molecular
Biology Service Unit - University of Alberta) which
included SYBR green (Molecular Probes) and Platinum
Taq (Invitrogen), and 125ng of DNA. The thermal
cycling conditions were 95°C for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of
95°C, 55°C, and 72°C for 30 seconds each, and a final 2
minute 72°C extension. Fluorescent data were acquired
after every 72°C extension. A 60-95°C melting curve was
performed to confirm the specificity of the products. No
template controls were included to account for DNA
contamination. All samples were analyzed in technical

and biological triplicates. Standard curves were constructed through a dilution series to validate the primer
pairs; all primers were found to have efficiencies that
were roughly equal, using the equation E = 10(-1/slope)
-1, and suitable for relative comparisons, and r2 values
>0.99. The primer sequences were designed using PerlPrimer v1.1.14 [http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net] and
are described in table 1. All primers were synthesized by
Integrated DNA Technologies and were purified by
standard desalting. PCR products were sequenced to
confirm specificity of the primers and all amplified a
single, specific target. Data were analyzed by the Opticon Monitor 3 software (Bio-Rad) which uses the ΔCT
method. The average copy number of integrated phage
was compared to the expected number based on published sequence data and the difference was statistically
analyzed with a two-tailed t-test. The correlation tests
between the three WO phages and wRi were performed
using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation test.
When determining the relative copy number for each of
the phage types, it was assumed that integrated prophage sequences would amplify with the same efficiency as
sequences from mature virus particles.
Sequence analysis

Annotated genomes of Wolbachia strains wMel [GenBank:NC_002978] [10] and wRi [GenBank:NC_012416]
[4], and phage strains WOCauB2 [GenBank:AB478515]
[9], and WOVitA [GenBank:HQ906662] [12] were
retrieved [22]. The phage regions [WRi_005250-005970]
(WORiB) and [WRi_006570-WRi_007250] (WORiC)
from the wRi genome were used for whole phage genome alignments. The region [WD0562-WD0646] from
the wMel genome was used for WOMelB genome alignments. Whole genome comparisons were performed
using the Mauve plug-in v.2.2.0 [20] for Geneious v5.4.4
[23]. The predicted amino acid sequences for the large
terminase subunit and baseplate assembly gene W were
used for phylogenetic analysis.

Proteins were aligned using the ClustalW multiple
alignment algorithm implemented in Geneious v5.4.4.
[23]. Model selection was performed using Prottest 2.4
[24] with Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) used to
select for an appropriate evolutionary model for each
data set [terminase (JTT+I+Γ+F) and baseplate assembly
protein W (JTT+Γ)] prior to analysis. The evolutionary
history was inferred for both genes using the maximum
likelihood method. Phylogenetic trees generated by
PHYML used 1000 bootstrap replicated datasets and
estimated gamma distribution and proportion of invariable sites [25].

Results
Presence and activity of WO prophages in Wolbachia of
D. simulans

When lytic viruses replicate and lyse host cells, they do
so through an enzymatic process involving a two component cell lysis system of a holin and lysozyme [26].
To date, there is no direct evidence that the WO phages
of wRi are capable of enzymatic lysis of bacterial hosts.
Therefore, the term “lytic” is not used here to describe
phage or phage DNA detected in excess of the integrated prophage genomes. Instead, replicating WO is
referred to as a mature, extrachromosomal, or active
phage. WO phages in wMel and wRi have been classically referred to as WO-A, WO-B, and WO-C [4,10].
However, the less ambiguous nomenclature WORiA,
WORiB, and WORiC respectively is used here to
describe the prophage types in wRi and WOMelA and
WOMelB for prophage types in wMel.
Quantitative PCR was used to test whether Wolbachia
prophages were replicating extrachromosomally. Specific
primers that differentiate between the prophage types in
wRi were designed (table 1) and Wolbachia titer was
determined by comparing the wsp gene copy number to
the Drosophila nuclear sod gene. Integrated and extrachromosomal viral copy numbers were determined
using primers specific to Wolbachia genes lysozyme
(WORiA), MTase (WORiB), and tail tube protein
(WORiC). The amplification of the WO-specific primers
was compared to Wolbachia copy number using wsp
(wRi-specific primers).Values reported are the combination of integrated plus extrachromosomal phages.
WORiA is found once in the wRi genome. The relative copy number of the ORF which encodes a putative
lyzozyme [WRi _012650] was measured in young males
and females (three replicates of 15 flies each), testes and
ovaries, and 15 minute AEL embryos. The relative lyzozyme (WORiA) copy number in these tissues ranged
from 0.94 - 1.16 per Wolbachia cell (figure 1A). This is
consistent with the single integrated copy in the genome
and indicates no extrachromosomal WORiA (all p
values > 0.05; two-tailed t-test).

Page 4 of 13

In wRi, there are two integrated copies of the WORiB
prophage and each contains one copy of the MTase
gene [WRi_005640; WRi_010300] [4]. In DSR males,
females, testes, ovaries, and two-hour embryos, the relative MTase copy number ranged from 1.83-2.10 and was
not significantly different than two per Wolbachia genome (all p values > 0.05, two-tailed t-test) (figure 1B).
There is no evidence of extrachromosomal WORiB
phage genomes.
The gene encoding the phage tail tube protein is present once in the wRi genome on the WORiC insert. In
males, females, testes, ovaries, and 15 minute AEL
embryos, the relative tail tube protein copy number was
significantly greater than the expected one copy per
Wolbachia genome (p < 0.05 in all cases, two- tailed ttest) (figure 1C). Therefore, WORiC is the extrachromosomal phage in wRi. The average density of all samples
tested ranged from 1.29 - 1.61 copies of WORiC per
wsp copy.
Occasionally, a DNA sample showed no evidence of
extra-chromosomal WORiC DNA (data not shown).
This indicates that DNA extracted from groups of flies
may mask variation with respect to the amount of replicating phage per individual. Thus, third instar larvae
were synchronized to a 1 hour age difference and wRi,
WORiA, WORiB, and WORiC numbers were measured
for each individual to determine whether the WO copy
number varied between individuals (figure 2). Relative
phage densities were also compared to Wolbachia densities to determine whether variations in phage copy
numbers were related to the bacterial density as
observed by Bordenstein et al [15] in N. vitripennis.
Among 16 third instar larvae tested, the Wolbachia densities ranged from 6.67 to 19.21 copies per host sod
gene, with the exception of one outlier at 34.88. WORiA
relative numbers averaged 0.97 and varied from 0.86 to
1.13 copies per Wolbachia. WORiB densities for the larvae averaged 2.02 copies per wRi and ranged between
1.56 and 2.78. Finally, WORiC copy numbers averaged
1.17 and ranged between 0.91 and 1.50 per wsp. None
of the densities of the three phage types correlated significantly with the Wolbachia density (Pearson correlation; p = 0.256, 0.12, and 0.16 for WORiA, WORiB, and
WORiC, respectively) among the 16 samples tested.
Removing the outlier individual (34.88 Wolbachia per
host cell) from the analyses did not change the statistical
outcome of the correlation test in WORiC (Pearson correlation; p > 0.7).
Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis

The genome of the WORiC prophage is predicted to be
77,261 bp containing 56 ORFs [WRi _006570 to
WRi_007250]. The core genome containing a DNA
packaging and head assembly module and a tail

genes for lysozyme, MTase, and tail tube protein were measured by qPCR to determine the amount of extrachromosomal WORiA, WORiB, and
WORiC, respectively in males, females, testes, ovaries, and embryos. The black line depicts the expected copy number for each of the phage
types; one for A and C, and two for B. Of the three phage types, only WORiC is present in any extrachromosomal copies (p < 0.05). Error bars

(Pearson; p > 0.05)

kbp [WRi_006910 to WRi_007210]. The 35% GC content is identical to the GC content of the wRi genome
indicating a long period of co-evolution between prophage and bacteria.
The only confirmed WO mature virus particles that
have been sequenced belong to Wolbachia of Cadra
cautella, WOCauB2 and WOCauB3 [9,12]. More
recently, Kent et al [12] used microarrays to capture the
sequences of WOVitA and WOVitB which are the

active phages in wVitA and wVitB respectively, infecting
N. vitripennis. In this study, genomes from active phages
were compared to WORi phage genomes to determine
whether conserved regions are present in all active
phages. Figure 3 shows the overall gene synteny between
the WO phages. The heights of the colored peaks represent the degree of nucleotide similarity between collinear genomes. Pairwise alignments were performed
between WORiC and WOCauB2 (figure 3a), WORiC
and WOVitA1 (figure 3b), WORiC and WORiB (figure

alignments are included in the Additional file 1, Table
S1, Additional file 2, Table S2, Additional file 3, Table
S3, Additional file 4, Table S4, respectively. The
WOMelB sequence used for comparisons included the
upstream adjacent pyocin region identified by Wu et al
[10]. These comparisons revealed conserved regions of
homologous sequence and identified rearrangements
and inversions between the genomes. The genes encoding putative structural and packaging proteins are present in two adjacent and conserved regions in WORiC,
WOVitA1 and WOCauB2. WORiA and WOMelA did
not align with other WO phage genomes (data not
shown).
Comparisons between WORiC and WOCauB2 reveal
a single block of homologous sequences spanning the
structural and packaging regions (figure 3a). There are
three separate areas of dissimilarity between WORiC
and WOCauB2. These include two transposable

elements and an uncharacterized phage protein
[WRi_007190].
Notable areas of dissimilarity between WOVitA1 and
WORiC (white areas; figure 3b) include two transposable elements [WRi_006820] interrupting an ankyrin
repeat protein gene [WRi_006810, WRi_p06840]. Genome alignments were also used to assign possible functions to previously annotated hypothetical ORFs. A
hypothetical gene, [WRi_p07030], shares 74.7% pairwise
identity to the virulence protein gene VrlC.1 of
WOVitA1 and is pseudonized by the transposon insertion [WRi_007040]. The annotated hypothetical protein
[WRi _007070] is homologous to tail protein I from
WOVitA1 (96%, 3e-143). The major region of dissimilarity between WOVitA1 and WORiC could be a result
of horizontal gene transfer into WOVitA1 or gene loss
in WORiC. These ORFs in WOVitA1 encode MutL and
three transcriptional regulators [ADW80184.1,

and WORiC share 36 homologs compared to 33 shared
between WORiC and WOCauB2, WORiC is more similar to WOCauB2 (92.4%).
The WORiB genome shares only the ORFs found
within the packaging region [WRi_005460 to
WRi_005610] with WORiC (figure 3c). However, when
the pyocin sequences, containing the viral structural
genes, are included in the WOMelB genome and aligned
with WORiC, the structural and packaging regions are
conserved, but rearranged in WOMelB compared to
WORiC (figure 3d).
The evolutionary relationships of the tail morphogenesis module and head assembly and DNA packaging
module were examined by phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees based on baseplate assembly protein W
and the large terminase subunit showed different evolutionary relationships for related phages, with the exception of the WOMelB, WORiB1 and WORiB2 clade
(figure 4). WORiC shows the greatest phylogenetic

relatedness to WOCauB2 and WOCauB3 for baseplate
assembly protein W (figure 4a), which is reflected by the
degree of nucleotide similarity in the alignment (figure
3a). In contrast, the large terminase subunit of WORiC
is most closely related to the wMel and wRi B-type
phages (figure 4b).

Discussion
WORiC is the active phage in wRi

When temperate bacteriophages infect sensitive bacteria
their viral genomes direct DNA replication of the phage,
cell lysis and the release of progeny, or, if the lytic state
is suppressed, they integrate into the bacterial chromosome in the form of a prophage, in what is known as
the lysogenic state. In Escherichia coli, lambdoid prophages are stably integrated into the host chromosome
and do not undergo lytic induction until the bacterial
SOS response is activated [27]. Gavotte et al [17] used a
filtration-based purification method accompanied by

TEM and ORF7-specific PCR to show that mature
phage particles form in Wolbachia-infected tissues in
both D. simulans and D. melanogaster, but the specific
identity of these virus particles and the regulation of
their induction was not addressed.
In this study, the activity of the three distinct prophages found in wRi infecting D. simulans was measured using quantitative PCR. Phage type-specific
primers were used to determine how many copies of the
phage genomes were present in addition to the integrated forms. The only phage chromosome to appear in
excess of the integrated copy number was WORiC. The
average number of copies of WORiC in all tissues tested
ranged from 1.29 - 1.61 copies per Wolbachia, consistently above the one copy integrated into the wRi genome. Thus, WORiC appears to be the only actively
replicating phage in D. simulans.
wRi is considered to be a high CI strain of Wolbachia
in D. simulans; embryonic lethality resulting from
crosses between infected males and uninfected females
is typically between 90 - 100% [28,29]. In N. vitripennis
infected with wVitB, which is also a high CI-inducing
strain of Wolbachia, Bordenstein et al [15] reported an
average WOVitB copy number of 1.6 ± 0.12 per Wolbachia. In the present study, a similar relative density of
WORiC suggests that this phage is the active virus
observed in past TEM micrographs of Drosophila tissues
[5,17]. WORiC genes have been reported as actively
transcribed in previous literature. Specifically, the
ankyrin related genes in WORiC are expressed in males,
females, ovaries, testes, early (2 hour AEL) and late
(overnight) embryos [4].
WORiB and WORiA are non-functional phage remnants

WORiA and WORiB did not show any evidence of
extrachromosomal DNA beyond the one and two
copies, respectively, found within the wRi genome.
Alignments to WOCauB and WOVitA1 show that both
WORiA and WORiB lack the core structural components necessary for virion assembly. The persistence of
WORiA and WORiB within the wRi genome suggests
that there may be selective pressures maintaining these
two prophages. There is evidence that WORiB is
actively transcribing at least one ORF located within the
prophage genome [30] and so this region may be necessary for another, unrelated, aspect of Wolbachia biology.
Phage density remains consistent among timesynchronized cohorts and does not correlate with
Wolbachia density in larvae

The average density of WORiC was derived from pooled
samples of multiple individuals and tissues. When 16
third instar larvae were individually measured for phage
density, WORiA and WORiB did not significantly

Page 10 of 13

deviate from the expected means of one and two copies,
respectively. Individual larva, however, had a much
wider distribution of WORiC copy numbers, ranging
from individuals that appeared to have no extrachromosomal viruses to individuals having more than 1.5
WORiC per Wolbachia. This indicates that not every
individual within the larval population is experiencing
viral replication, although most are. Currently, the signals which induce viral replication within the confines
of an endosymbiotic bacterium are unknown.
Along with the WO density in individual third instar
larvae, the relative Wolbachia wRi density per D. simulans host cell was also measured. The wRi density did
not significantly correlate with WORiA, WORiB, or
WORiC relative densities. However, the WORiC density
trends toward a slight inverse association with wRi density. It is possible that with a larger sample population,
more statistical significance would emerge. This lack of
correlation does not refute the phage density model postulated by Bordenstein et al [15], whereby the Wolbachia copy number and CI in N. vitripennis was found to
be inversely related to phage activity. Rather, it raises
the notion that phage density is a population and strainspecific factor. Low levels of replicating phage, as seen
here for WORiC, may not significantly impact Wolbachia wRi density and the strength of CI in Drosophila.
The effect of phage copy number on CI level in D.
simulans has yet to be examined.
Comparative Genomics and phylogenetics of Wolbachia
bacteriophages

Since WORiC in this study was the only wRi prophage
capable of extrachromosomal replication, a comparative
genomic approach was taken to identify the core genome conserved between WORiC and two known temperate bacteriophages WOVitA1 and WOCauB2. This
approach identified essential regions required for phage
generation. The genomes of WORiC, WOVitA1, and
WOCauB2 show considerable sequence homology
which supports the view that WORiC is the active form
of phage in wRi. In contrast, the WORiB genome and
the WOMelB genome lacking the upstream pyocin
region share few homologous sequences with WORiC.
Genes with sequence homology in WORiB, WOMelB,
and WORiC belong to the DNA packaging and head
assembly region. However, the core structural/tail region
of WORiC aligns with WOMelB once the pyocin region
is included in the analysis. WORiB lacks the pyocin-like
region and is therefore deficient in most tail morphogenesis genes.
The chimeric nature of WO phages was initially
described by Masui et al [6], who identified the large
terminase subunit, portal protein and minor capsid protein of the packaging region in WOKue as lambda-like,

Biliske et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:251
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/251

and the baseplate assembly proteins of the structural
region as P2-like. This hybridization of lambda and P2
sequences is not exclusive to WO phages, since chimeric
phages have been described in other systems; for example Xylella fastidiosa phages XfP1 and XfP2 are also
lambda/P2 chimeras [16]. Due to recombination and
genetic mosaicism, different parts of a bacteriophage
genome can have different evolutionary histories [31]. In
the chimeric WO phages (figure 4), the large terminase
subunit sequence from the DNA packaging and head
assembly regions shows a different phylogenetic relationship than the baseplate assembly protein W
sequence from the tail morphogenesis regions. This
modular nature of WO phages has been described previously [19].
The two conserved modules shared by WORiC and
the temperate phages WOCauB2 and WOVitA1 include
the DNA packaging and head assembly region and the
tail morphogenesis region. The genome encoding the
DNA packaging and head assembly module includes
ORFs that putatively code for a portal protein, a minor
capsid protein and the large subunit of the terminase
protein. This large terminase subunit contains a DNAdependent ATPase domain and site-specific nuclease
domain which are both involved in DNA translocation
during packaging. In double stranded DNA phages, terminases are generally accompanied by a small subunit
involved in DNA binding [32,33]. However, no homolog
of this small subunit has been identified in any WO
genome. The portal protein of tailed bacteriophages
forms a complex with the terminase proteins which
translocates phage DNA into the prohead during phage
replication [33]. The conservation of these packaging
genes suggests that DNA packaging in WO phages is
driven by an ATP-dependent DNA translocation motor
similar to other tailed bacteriophages.
Similarly, the organization of the tail morphogenesis
module is conserved among WOVitA, WOCauB, and
WORiC. Genes involved in tail assembly include the tail
proteins, tail tape measure protein, the tail sheath protein, the contractile tail tube protein and baseplate
assembly proteins J,W, and V. Tail morphogenesis in
the subfamily Myoviridae, which have long contractile
tails, is the most complex of all tailed bacteriophages. In
the Myoviridae T4, P2 or Mu, baseplate assembly occurs
first and is required for sheath and tail polymerization.
It is from the baseplate that the tube polymerizes to a
length determined by the tail-tape measure protein and
this is followed by the tail sheath which extends the
length of the tail [34].
The presence of the tail sheath gene in active WO
genomes suggests that, with respect to tail structure
and assembly, these phages are more similar to Myoviridae than to the subfamily Siphoviridae, which

Page 11 of 13

includes lambda and lacks contractile tails. The phage
tail mediates genome delivery into host cells, and is
required for the generation of infectious phages. The
absence of this region in the WORiB genome may
contribute to the inability of WORiB to form infectious particles.
Unlike WORiC, where the packaging region is located
adjacent to the structural proteins, in WOMelB the
structural proteins are divided in the genome and separated from the packaging region by approximately
18kbp [35]. One region of structural genes found in
WOMelB was initially characterized as a pyocin-like
region. Therefore, active phage generation in D. melanogaster wMel could result from the coordinate replication
of both packaging and structural regions. Despite much
previous interest in Wolbachia’s ankyrin containing
genes [35,36], and the suggestion that they may influence phage function, the ORFs encoding ankyrin-containing motifs are outside the core conserved regions of
WORiC, WOVitA1 and WOCauB3. The role of ankyrin
coding genes in the WO-Wolbachia-host relationship
remains elusive [37,38].
Our results suggest that Wolbachia phages WORiC
and known active phages WOCauB and WOVitA1
represent a conserved class of Wolbachia phages. Interest in the conserved genetic modules of the lambda-like
DNA packaging and head assembly genes and P2-like
tail morphogenesis genes led to the investigation of the
relatedness of the Wolbachia phages. Phylogenetic analysis shows similarity between WORiC and WO-B’s
found in wMel and wRi (based on large terminase subunit phylogeny) and similarity between WORiC and
WOCauB2 and WOCauB3 (based on the baseplate
assembly protein W phylogeny). These divergent topologies are indicative of the horizontal transfer events
occurring between phage genomes. Similarity of genomes of active WO phages may be due to the fact that
they have a common, recent origin, or because active
WO phages are operating within a limited framework of
endosymbiotic bacteria, where opportunities for incorporating novel gene sequences by recombination are
limited. Given the present level of knowledge of active
WO bacteriophages, we cannot distinguish between
these and other possible evolutionary scenarios.

Conclusions
The genome of WORiC shares two main regions of
similarity to WO phages infecting wCau and wVit.
These two regions encode DNA packaging and head
assembly proteins and tail morphogenesis and structural
proteins. The conserved structural and packaging
regions appear to be necessary for generation of mature
virus particles; all active WO phages characterized to
date contain these homologous components.

The obligate intracellular nature of Wolbachia makes
detailed examination of WO and its temperate lifestyle a
challenge. Here, a phage-specific quantitative PCR
approach was employed to determine that WORiC is
the active prophage element in wRi. On an organismal
and tissue-specific level, WORiC is present in very low
densities; this low density is expected in wRi’s high CI
environment and is consistent with the phage density
model developed in Nasonia [15]. On an individual
basis, however, no correlation was found between wRi
and WO phage density in synchronized third instar larvae. This study provides an integrated computational
and molecular approach to investigate the complex biology of the host insect, Wolbachia endosymbiont, and
WO bacteriophage.
