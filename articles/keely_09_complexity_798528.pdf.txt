Abstract
Background: The relationship between the parasitic fungus Pneumocystis carinii and its host, the
laboratory rat, presumably involves features that allow the fungus to circumvent attacks by the
immune system. It is hypothesized that the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) gene family endows
Pneumocystis with the capacity to vary its surface. This gene family is comprised of approximately
80 genes, which each are approximately 3 kb long. Expression of the MSG gene family is regulated
by a cis-dependent mechanism that involves a unique telomeric site in the genome called the
expression site. Only the MSG gene adjacent to the expression site is represented by messenger
RNA. Several P. carinii MSG genes have been sequenced, which showed that genes in the family can
encode distinct isoforms of MSG. The vast majority of family members have not been characterized
at the sequence level.
Results: The first 300 basepairs of MSG genes were subjected to analysis herein. Analysis of 581
MSG sequence reads from P. carinii genomic DNA yielded 281 different sequences. However, many
of the sequence reads differed from others at only one site, a degree of variation consistent with
that expected to be caused by error. Accounting for error reduced the number of truly distinct
sequences observed to 158, roughly twice the number expected if the gene family contains 80
members. The size of the gene family was verified by PCR. The excess of distinct sequences
appeared to be due to allelic variation. Discounting alleles, there were 73 different MSG genes
observed. The 73 genes differed by 19% on average. Variable regions were rich in nucleotide
differences that changed the encoded protein. The genes shared three regions in which at least 16
consecutive basepairs were invariant. There were numerous cases where two different genes were
identical within a region that was variable among family members as a whole, suggesting
recombination among family members.
Conclusion: A set of sequences that represents most if not all of the members of the P. carinii
MSG gene family was obtained. The protein-changing nature of the variation among these
sequences suggests that the family has been shaped by selection for protein variation, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that the MSG gene family functions to enhance phenotypic variation
among the members of a population of P. carinii.

Background
Pneumocystis carinii is a fungal microbe that is found in the
lungs of laboratory rats [1-6]. P. carinii appears to be specific to rats because it is not found in other species of
mammals and fails to establish itself when introduced
into immunodeficient mice [7], which have their own
species of Pneumocystis, called P. murina [8]. P. carinii is
morphologically and phylogenetically closely related to P.
murina, both of which are somewhat less closely related to
the human pathogen, Pneumocystis jirovecii, which causes
Pneumocystis pneumonia in individuals with impaired
immune function, such as patients suffering from
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [3,9-15].
P. carinii and P. murina can cause pneumonia in their
hosts, rats and mice, respectively, if these host animals
lack a robust immune system [16-19].
While P. carinii can cause disease in the absence of a normal immune system, rats that lack such a system are probably not its normal ecological niche. It has been
established that P. carinii organisms can persist for
months in rats that are immunologically normal [20].
Normal laboratory rats are often colonized by P. carinii
and show no obvious ill effects [5,6]. Likewise, P. murina
appears to be able to inhabit normal mice [16,17,21-23].
By analogy, P. jirovecii would be expected to make its
home in normal humans, and data showing colonization
of healthy people by P. jirovecii are accumulating [24-33].
None of the species of Pneumocystis that have been studied
have been observed to proliferate much outside of the airway of the mammalian host in which they are found, and
Pneumocystis DNA is very scarce in environments apart
from mammals [34-38]. Thus, Pneumocystis species
exhibit three features suggesting that they are obligate parasites of mammals: 1) They are extremely scarce outside of
the mammalian lung. 2) They have fastidious growth
requirements. 3) They can colonize immunocompetent
hosts.
Parasites employ various methods to survive in the face of
host defenses. One such method is programmed antigenic
variation, which allows a population of parasites to
quickly produce an organism whose surface differs from
that of the others in the population. The VSG antigenic
variation system in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma
brucei illustrates how gene families can be used to create
phenotypic diversity within a population of eukaryotic
parasites [39-46]. There are thousands of different VSG
genes in the T. brucei genome [47]. These genes tend to be
clustered together near telomeres. Only one VSG gene is
transcribed in a given cell. The gene that is expressed
changes frequently enough to make it probable that the
host immune response, which is directed against the version of VSG present on the majority of parasites, does not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/367

destroy all of the parasites in the host. Changing which
gene is expressed in T. brucei is often accomplished via
DNA recombination, which alters an expressed VSG gene
by replacing some or all of its DNA with DNA from a
silent VSG gene [46,48,49].
The P. carinii MSG (Major Surface Glycoprotein) gene
family is much smaller than the T. brucei VSG gene family,
but exhibits structural and functional features similar to it.
The P. carinii genome contains approximately 80 MSG
genes, which are located at the ends of each of 17 chromosomes [50-55]. Pairwise comparisons of eleven complete
P. carinii MSG showed that they are between 5 and 19%
divergent, but share a number of features including a
length of approximately 3 kb, a lack of introns and the
presence of an invariant 5' sequence element called the
CRJE, which is discussed further below [55]. Other short
invariant sequence elements reside at multiple locations
within the bodies of the 11 fully sequenced MSG genes,
which tended to be least variable at their 3' ends. Most of
the 11 genes have been shown to be members of gene
clusters containing up to 3 MSG genes. The genes within a
cluster were as different from one another as they were
from genes in different clusters, suggesting that selection
and or recombination has driven rapid diversification of
P. carinii MSG genes [55].
MSG genes have been described in five other species of
Pneumocystis, including the three that have received a
species name other than " carinii", P. murina (found in the
laboratory mouse) [56], P. wakefieldiae (found in the laboratory rat) [57] and P. jirovecii (found in human beings)
[58,59]. MSG sequences have also been reported from two
additional presumptive Pneumocystis species (one from
ferrets and one from a macaque) that do not yet have their
own species name [60,61].
Studies on restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism have shown that there is considerable variation in
the MSG gene families present in P. jirovecii organisms
found in different human beings [59]. These finding are
consistent with the idea that MSG genes evolve rapidly.
Compared to P. jirovecii MSG genes, neither P. carinii nor
P. murina MSG genes families exhibited much variation
when studied by restriction enzyme analysis [59]. Nevertheless, it is possible that MSG gene families are evolving
relatively quickly in each species of Pneumocystis, and that
the more limited MSG diversity seen in P. carinii and P.
murina reflects the isolation of laboratory rodents, a practice that would be expected to limit exposure to the populations of Pneumocystis that live in wild rodents. While
keeping rodents in vivaria keeps exogenous microbes out,
it would also tend to trap any endogenous parasites. It is
common to find P. carinii at low levels in laboratory rats
that have not been deliberately exposed to the fungus,

indicating that a particular population of P. carinii can
propagate within colonies of laboratory rats [5]. Therefore, the reason that P. carinii found in laboratory rats
tend to be relatively genetically uniform may be that these
microbes descended from those that were captured along
with the rats that were used to establish laboratory colonies. By contrast, human beings would be expected to
encounter multiple wild strains of P. jirovecii.
Expression of MSG gene families has been studied primarily in P. carinii, where several lines of evidence indicate
that a single MSG gene is transcribed in a given P. carinii
genome at a given time. Restricted transcription is accomplished via a cis-dependent mechanism that involves a
unique telomeric site in the genome called the expression
site. Only the MSG gene adjacent to the expression site is
represented by messenger RNA [52,53,62,63]. The MSG
protein on the surface of P. carinii organisms has been
shown to vary and to be encoded by the MSG gene that is
at the expression site [64,65]. The expression site contains
the UCS (Upstream Conserved Sequence), a sequence
found at the beginning of messenger RNAs encoding
diverse MSG proteins [62,63] (Figure 1). Immediately
adjacent to and downstream of the UCS, there is short
sequence, called the CRJE, which is conserved among all
MSG genes, by definition [52,62,66].
CRJE stands for "Conserved Recombination Junction Element" because it could be involved in recombination

Maps of expressed and donor MSG genes. The
expressed MSG gene is adjacent to the UCS sequence.
Donor MSG genes are not adjacent to the UCS sequence,
which is unique in the genome. For illustrative purposes, just
three of approximately 80 donor genes are depicted. There
is a copy of the CRJE, which is a 24 basepair conserved
sequence, at the beginning of MSG genes, including the one
attached to the UCS. The discontinuities in the MSG genes
are there to indicate that the genes are not drawn to size relative to the UCS and CRJE. The open horizontal arrows
show the locations and orientations of PCR primers. The

events that cause the MSG gene at the expression site to
change [62]. The CRJE is present both at the expression
site at the junction between the UCS and the expressed
MSG gene, and in MSG genes that were not attached to the
expression site (donor MSG genes) (Figure 1). The location and conservation of the CRJE suggests that it could
function as a target of a site-specific event, such as a double-stranded break, which would be expected to increase
recombination between the expression site and a donor
MSG gene. However, there is no direct evidence for such
events and the role of the CRJE in recombination is still a
matter of speculation. Nevertheless, the CRJE serves to
identify MSG genes, which otherwise resemble MSR
genes, a P. carinii gene family that is not regulated by the
MSG expression site [66-68].
A large variety of different MSG sequences have been
observed at the expression site, indicating that recombination can install DNA from various silent donor MSG genes
at this locus [52,53,69]. The types and frequencies of the
inferred recombination events are not clear because the
fastidiousness of P. carinii has prevented experiments in
vitro, and experiments in rats are complicated by their tendency to be colonized by P. carinii, which has limited the
utility of experiments that seek to observe phenotypic or
genotypic switching by introducing into a rat a small population of P. carinii expressing a known MSG gene [69].
An alternative approach to understanding the MSG system would be to acquire a better understanding of the
gene family. If all of the genes in the family are identified,
it may be possible to infer how changes are produced at
the expression site. For example, if recombination completely replaces the MSG gene at the expression site with
an MSG gene from a donor site, then the sequences found
at the expression site will match those in the donor gene
database. However, if recombination were to alter a segment of the MSG gene that is at the expression site, then
there will be sequences linked to the UCS that do not
exactly match any of the donor genes.
Understanding the MSG gene family at the sequence level
will also aid in assessing the function of this family. If its
function is to confer variability, then MSG genes will have
evolved under the influence of selection for variation in
the proteins they encode (positive selection), a prediction
that can be tested by sequence analysis.
Sequence data pertaining to the P. carinii MSG gene family
are available, but the vast majority of the available data
has not been analyzed [70]. Analysis of these data is challenging for several reasons. First, most of the data are in
the form of shotgun reads which require assembly. However, standard assembly procedures are not designed to
assemble genes from gene families, and might join reads
that came from different genes. A second possible compli-

cation stems from the doubtful clonality of P. carinii populations. The organisms used to obtain genome sequence
data came from the lungs of immunosuppressed rats that
had been infected by constant exposure to other infected
rats [63]. This system of obtaining infected rats has been
in operation for decades. Hence, more than one genetic
strain of P. carinii could have contributed to the DNA used
to obtain genomic sequences, and a given MSG gene
could be represented by more than one allele. Alleles are
defined as different versions of the sequence located at a
particular location on a chromosome (i.e., at a genomic
locus). In absence of gene flow between two populations
that were genetically identical at separation, mutation will
cause allelic polymorphism to arise over time. The formation of allelic polymorphism would be accelerated if
selection were to favor cells that sustained mutation, as
could be the case for MSG genes given their probable role
in generating phenotypic variation. P. carinii cells are
thought to be haploid, and a given haploid cell can contain only one allele at each locus. Nevertheless, two strains
might contain two different alleles of a particular gene at
a particular locus. Therefore, if more than one genetic
strain of P. carinii contributed to the sequence data, then
a given MSG gene could be represented by more than one
allele. Assembly programs would tend to amalgamate
alleles into a single consensus sequence, thereby obscuring an important aspect of the sequence data.
A third problem is posed by the presence of MSR genes in
the P. carinii genome. MSR and MSG genes are distinct,
but highly related, and analysis of sequence data must be
performed in a way that avoids sequence reads from MSR
genes.
In the studies described herein, the first 300 basepairs of
MSG genes were selected for analysis. Although MSG
genes are more than 3000 basepairs long, analyzing the
first 300 bps of MSG genes offered two important practical advantages. First, this segment of an MSG gene is specifically amplifiable using the CRJE as a primer-binding
site (Figure 1). Hence, this approach avoids interference
from MSR genes, which lack the CRJE. Second, the 300 bp
amplicons are smaller than the average sequence read
available in the largest database, that of the Pneumocystis
genome project. Therefore, it seemed probable that
sequence reads spanning the entire 300 bps would be
numerous in the database, in which case it would be possible to cover the whole family without having to rely on
assembly of contigs, which is problematic when dealing
with gene families. Practical advantages aside, the 5-prime
ends of MSG genes are of interest because recombination
events that move DNA from donor genes to the gene at
the expression site may be frequent in this region. Defining the full repertoire of donor MSG genes should allow
this hypothesis to be tested in the future.

Results
Strategy and approach for sequence analysis of the MSG
gene family
Assembly of short sequence reads from a gene family can
be problematic because assembly relies on sequence identity, and members of gene families tend to share bits of
sequence identity. Therefore, the assembler might join
sequences that represent different members of the family.
While mis-joining can be minimized by increasing the
number of consecutive bases that must match, doing so
reduces the number of useful sequences and raises the risk
of failure to join sequences that represent the same gene,
but are slightly different due to errors or allelic variation.
Although the P. carinii genome appears to be haploid, a
given gene could be represented by more than one allele
because stocks of P. carinii available for sequence analysis
may have included a variety of genetic strains. In the case
of P. carinii MSG genes, analysis is further complicated by
two other factors. First, the P. carinii genome contains a
second gene family, MSR, members of which are very similar to members of the MSG gene family [66,71,72]. Second, rats can be co-infected by a second species of
Pneumocystis, P. wakefieldiae [73-76]. In light of these
considerations, the first 300 nucleotides from MSG genes
were chosen for analysis. This segment can be amplified
and sequenced as a single unit that contains the CRJE, a
sequence element that distinguishes MSG genes from
MSR genes, and distinguishes P. carinii MSG genes from P.
wakefieldiae MSG genes [75].

The strategy for acquisition and analysis of sequence data
is summarized in Figure 2. All of the sequences acquired
via this strategy began with a copy of the CRJE and ended
with a conserved sequence called C2 [55]. Therefore, all of
the sequences overlapped by at least 300 bases.
Comparison of all sequence reads
Combining the sequence reads found in the genome
project database with the sequences obtained from ADAM
plasmid libraries provided 581 sequences, which was
more than 7 times as many as the 80 genes thought to be
in the P. carinii MSG gene family [50-55]. Some sequences
were present dozens of times among the 581, while other
sequences were present only once. Variation in the
number of times a sequence was present occurred both in
data from the ADAM plasmids and in reads from the
genome project.

There were 281 different sequences among the set of 581.
Pairwise comparisons of the 281 non-identical sequences
showed that the average number of non-identical sites
between any two sequences was 56 ± 4 (approximately
19%), a value similar to that observed when 11 full-length
MSG genes were compared [55] (Additional file 1). The
difference-values were distributed around the mean in a

Strategy for analysis of the P. carinii MSG gene family

1. Minimize assembly problems by analyzing the first 300 nucleotides from MSG genes, a
segment that can be amplified and sequenced as a single unit and contains the CRJE, a
sequence element that distinguishes MSG genes from MSR genes.
2. Construct plasmid libraries containing the first 300 nucleotides of MSG genes amplified from
P. carinii genomic DNA.
3. Sequence the inserts in approximately 300 plasmids (ADAM plasmids).
4. Use sequences obtained from the ADAM plasmid libraries to identify the MSG reads in the
shot-gun sequence database available from The Pneumocystis genome project.
5. Extract genome project reads that include the CRJE and the C2 region downstream.
6. Combine sequence data obtained from ADAM plasmids and the genome project. (A total of
581 sequence reads were obtained.)
7. Remove duplicates (300 sequence reads were removed at this step. This left 281 reads for
further analysis.
8. Compare non-identical sequences to each other to estimate error frequency and assess
possible allelic variation. (123 reads were removed at this step because they could have been
generated by error. This left 158 sequences for further analysis.)
9. Combine sequences that appear to be from the same gene and generate consensus sequences.
(158 sequence reads coalesced into 73 groups)
10. Analyze the gene family to assess sequence diversity, conserved and variable regions and the
roles of selection and recombination in evolution of these features.

manner that resembled a normal distribution, with
approximately 95% of the data falling between 10% and
30%, which was within 2 standard deviations of the
mean. However, pairs of sequences that differed by less
than 10% were apparent in the distribution, indicating
that some sequence reads were very similar to others.

quency agreed with that expected from an independent
estimate of PCR error, which was obtained by sequencing
cloned PCR products produced by amplifying a cloned
DNA fragment (data not shown). In addition, the error
frequency was the same as that reported in a study on
errors in sequences from Drosophila species [78].

Figure 3 shows a tree depicting the relationships among
the 281 non-identical sequences. Again, it was apparent
that some sequences were very similar to one another.
Closely related sequences are expected to arise due to PCR
and other errors. Therefore, the next step was to determine
if error contributed to the diversity observed.

Single errors were most common, occurring in 22.4% of
the reads, while 5.8% contained two errors, and 1.7%
contained three errors. These data were similar to those
expected based on Poisson probability calculations,
which predicted that 26.4% of the reads would contain 1
error, and 5.1% would contain two errors. However, Poisson probability predicted that only 0.7% would contain
three errors. Therefore, sequences with three putative
errors seemed to be more common than would be
expected by chance. Nevertheless, statistical analysis of
the observed and expected error data (by Chi square goodness of fit test) showed the two data sets to be statistically
indistinguishable (p = 0.5).

Estimation of error in sequence reads
To assess error in the sequence data, sequence reads that
were at least 99% identical were aligned. The reads in
groups containing 10 or more reads were visually
inspected to detect cases where a single sequence read differed from all others in the group. Such differences were
scored as errors. There was one such presumptive error for
every 769 bp, indicating that the error frequency per bp
was 0.0013. Transitions outnumbered transversions by
about 3 to 1, as expected [77]. The observed error fre-

Analysis of closely related sequence reads identified 123
reads that differed from other reads at only one position.
Given that such minimal divergence could have been due
to error, it seemed justifiable to restrict further analysis to
the 158 reads that differed at more than one site.
Reassessment of the number of MSG genes in the gene
family
Previous data had suggested that there are only about 80
genes in the family [50,69,79-81]. Yet, the sequence data
contained at least 158 genuinely different sequence reads
(i.e., those that exhibited more divergence than would be
expected to be produced by error). Therefore, the number
of genuinely different sequences was at least twice as high
as the putative number of genes in the family. This observation prompted a reexamination of the size of the MSG
gene family.

Figure 3
Neighbor-Joining Tree of 281 MSG sequences

relationships among the 281 non-identical MSG sequences
were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [121] in
MEGA4 software [117]. Gaps were ignored. Circle symbols
mark the branches containing members of the 73 core MSG
sequences (see text). The tree is drawn to scale in p-distance
units. The bar at the top of the tree represents a p-distance
of 0.02.

A quantitative PCR assay was developed based on the fact
that all MSG genes contain a copy of the CRJE, by definition, while MSR genes do not contain the CRJE [66]. A second primer site was identified approximately 80 bp
downstream of the CRJE. At this location, all of the 581
sequence reads contained a completely conserved
sequence, called C1 (see section titled "Conserved and
variable regions in members of the MSG gene family").
Therefore, PCR using a CRJE primer paired with a C1
primer should amplify the MSG gene family exclusively
and exhaustively. The abundance of MSG targets was compared to the abundance of UCS targets. The UCS is present
in one copy per haploid genome [52,53,62,63,80,82-84].
The real-time PCR results indicated that the P. carinii
genome contains approximately 90 genes encoding MSG
(Figure 4). These results were consistent with previous
estimates [50,69,79,80].

Evidence of allelic variation
Allelic variation would explain both the presence of very
closely related sequences and the apparent excess of different sequences relative to the number of MSG genes in the
genome. Although the P. carinii genome is probably haploid [85], multiple alleles could have been present among
the organisms used to obtain sequence reads because the
populations of organisms were not necessarily genetically
homogeneous. The source of the P. carinii present in the
rats used to isolate P. carinii was not well-defined because
laboratory rats tend to carry P. carinii, which they can
acquire soon after birth [6,86]. In addition, the P. carinii
used in the preparation of the various libraries had been
obtained from different rats at different points in time.
Therefore, if different genetic strains of P. carinii exist,
more than one could have been represented in the DNA
used to obtain sequence data.

To examine the possibility that allelic polymorphism contributed to the diversity of MSG sequences observed,
sequence reads that differed by no more than 5% were
grouped. This procedure incorporated all but 31 of the
original 581 sequences into 42 groups, and left 31
sequences as singletons. The groups varied in size from 49
to 2 members.
To determine if polymorphism occurred within a group,
the reads were aligned and the alignment scanned visually
to identify sites that varied in a way that was inconsistent
with error. Given that the probability of error was 0.0013
per site, the probability that an error would occur twice at
a given site was less than 2 × 10-6. Therefore, observation

of a variant nucleotide at the same site in at least two reads
in a group would seem to be due to polymorphism, rather
than error. Based on this criterion, polymorphism was
present among the sequence reads in 21 of the 42 groups
(Table 1 and Additional file 2). Statistical analysis supported the designation of recurrent substitutions as polymorphism, rather than error. For example, reads with two
or more substitutions were 5 to 28-fold more numerous
than would be expected based on the error rate (p < 0.001,
Chi square goodness of fit).
Different versions of a group sequence were rarely seen in
equivalent numbers. In 5 of the 7 groups that contained
25 or more reads (see groups 1–7 in Table 1), the majority
sequence was at least 10 times more frequent than the
minority sequence. The predominance of one version of a
sequence within a group is inconsistent with the idea that
minor sequence variation is due to the presence of very
similar genes that reside at different loci, because such a
situation would cause the different versions of a sequence
to be seen in equal numbers, which was seldom the case.
If a polymorphism reflects allelic variation, then one population might be rich in one allele, while another allele
predominates in a second population. By contrast, if two
genes gave rise to an observed sequence polymorphism,
then both genes will be present in all populations. In
group 1, haplotype 1-C was present in 15 of the 21 reads
obtained from ADAM plasmids (population A in Table 1),
and in 5 of 6 plasmids from population E, but in only 3
of the 21 reads from the reads obtained from Lucigen plasmids (population B in Table 1), where haplotype 2-C predominated. The probability of observing these haplotype
frequencies under the two-gene model is very low (p =
0.0004, Fisher Exact Probability Test). In group 2, nearly
all of the 28 sequence reads obtained from Lucigen plasmids were haplotype 5-GTAA. However, four other haplotypes were also observed in group 2. If any of these other
haplotypes came from a second gene, then the probability
of observing 24 sequences with the 5-GTAA haplotype
among the 28 sequences from the Lucigen plasmids is
very low (p = 0.009, Fisher Exact Probability test).
Conserved and variable regions in members of the MSG
gene family
To simplify analysis of variation among the different
groups of sequences observed, a consensus sequence for
each of the 42 sequence groups was produced. Combining
these 42 consensus sequences with the 31 singleton
sequences produced a set of 73 sequences that can be considered to represent the core of the MSG gene family.

Figure 5 shows where sequence variation occurred among
the MSG genes represented by the 73 core sequences.

of the polymorphisms that were not in HV1. Each number refers to a nucleotide site where position 1 is the A in the ATG at the beginning of the

Sequence uniformity in the CRJE was not quite absolute.
Two sequence reads, which were identical to one another,
contained an A residue at position 8 instead of the canonical G residue seen in other copies of the CRJE (See group
29 in Additional file 2). The polymorphism at position 8
alters the encoded peptide. Variation in the CRJE has been
seen before, but remains quite rare [55].
Five hyper-variable regions are depicted in Figure 5. All of
the hyper-variable regions exhibited a relatively high frequency of base substitution. Some hypervariable regions
also exhibited frequent and extensive insertions and deletions (INDELS). To illustrate, hypervariable region 1
(HV1) began at site 28, where INDELS were very common. After the INDEL region, 15 of the next 20 nucleotide
sites exhibited very frequent substitution. The types and
locations of the substitutions in region HV1 are shown in
Table 2, which shows the 31 different HV1 sequences that
were observed in the 42 groups. Figure 6 shows that most
of the nucleotide variation in groups 1, 2 and 3 occurred
in HV1. In addition, in nearly half of the groups with 10
or more reads, HV1 variation was observed among the
sequence reads in the group (Table 1).

Functional significance of nucleotide variation
To assess the functional significance of the nucleotide differences that separate different MSG genes, the 73 core
sequences were translated in silico. All but 6 of the core
sequences contained an open reading frame encoding an
MSG polypeptide. These 67 translationally competent
sequences were aligned using RevTrans http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RevTrans/, which is a program
that takes a set of DNA sequences, virtually translates
them, aligns the peptide sequences, and uses this alignment as a scaffold for constructing the alignment of the
corresponding DNA sequences [87]. Sites that did not
have the same nucleotide in all 67 DNA sequences were
scored. The changes seen at such sites were categorized as
either nonsynonymous or synonymous, based on
whether or not a nucleotide change caused a change in the
encoded peptide sequence. The number of synonymous
and non-synonymous substitutions and of insertions and
deletions were calculated using a program called SNAP
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/
SNAP.html[88].

Figure 7 plots the cumulative number of differences that
occurred starting at the first codon and proceeding to the
last. As would be expected from the data shown in Figure

tion, the divergence seen in 48% of the 2211 pairwise
comparisons of the 67 translationally competent core
sequences appeared to have been influenced by positive
selection for variation (p < 0.05, Z-test in MEGA 4.0). In
Figure 7, the line describing non-synonymous differences
increases nearly seven times faster than the line describing
synonymous differences. This trend is the opposite of
what is seen in most genes, where synonymous nucleotide
substitutions tend to occur more frequently than non-synonymous substitutions. The prevalence of non-synonymous substitutions suggests that the MSG gene family has
evolved under the influence of selection in favor of variation (positive selection). Positive selection has long been
recognized as an important force in the evolution of both
infectious organisms and defenses against them. An example is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC),
which facilitates the immune response against infectious
microorganisms. There is a abundance of non-synonymous variation in the regions of MHC genes that encode
the domains that bind microbial antigens [89].

Location and types of variation exhibited by closelyrelated sequence reads. Data derived from the top three
groups of sequence reads (Table 1) are shown. An open bar
represents a group of aligned sequences. The black boxes
within an open bar indicate the locations where variable
bases were observed among the reads in the group. The
sequences observed are shown above each black box. Dots
represent identity.
5, INDELS and base substitutions occurred at multiple,
but nonrandom locations. Variation was quite rare in the
CRJE and C1 regions, and particularly frequent in HV
regions. Occurrence of INDELS was strikingly frequent in
HV1 and HV4.
Role of selection in diversification of MSG gene family
members
Statistical analysis of variation among the 67 translationally competent core MSG sequences showed that the rates
of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation were significantly different (p = 0.0006, see Methods). In addi-

Recombination in MSG genes
Members of the MSG gene family share patches of
sequence identity, which would be expected to facilitate
homologous recombination between family members.
Therefore, it might be expected that MSG genes would
tend to recombine with each other. The possibility of
recombination was examined in three ways. First the 73
sequences were analyzed with RDP2 software [90], which
showed that each of the 73 MSG sequences exhibited evidence of recombination with at least one of the other 73
MSG sequences. Figure 8 shows an example of evidence
suggestive of recombination. Sequences G51 and A171
were identical between positions 1 and 135 but not downstream of this region, where sequence G51 was identical
to sequence A32. Sequences G51 and A32 were not identical in the region shared by sequences G51 and A171.
Recombination between MSG genes would seem to be the
most likely cause of the blocks of sequence identity
observed when these three sequences were compared.

Recombination was also implicated by analysis of the
HV1 region. The 42 consensus sequences contained 31
different sequences in the HV1 region. Therefore, some
HV1 sequences were present in more than one gene. For
example, HV1 sequence 4 was present in seven groups.
Given that the HV1 region is so variable that it tends to
differ in the different alleles of a gene, the presence of the
same HV1 sequence in multiple genes would seem to not
be due to sequence conservation, but rather be due to
recombination events.
As a third test for recombination, subsections of the 73
MSG genes were analyzed. To start this analysis, each of
the 73 sequences was divided into three segments, a, b

and c, which corresponded to nucleotide positions 1 to
105, 106 to 210 and 211 to 315, respectively. Then, segments were aligned to the others of their type, i.e., a's were
aligned to a's, etc. Three neighbor-joining trees, one for
each segment, were made. Comparison of the three trees
revealed many examples where a particular segment
sequence occurred in more than one of the 73 MSG
sequences. For example, one 'a' segment sequence
occurred in nine different genes, which were different by
virtue of the sequence in regions b and c. Recombination
is the most parsimonious explanation for such gene structures.
PCR can generate recombinants [91-93]. To evaluate the
possibility that this type of error contributed to the data,
two plasmids, each carrying a distinct MSG insert (the two
inserts were 80% identical), were mixed together and subjected to PCR amplification. The amplicons were cloned
and twelve clones were picked and sequenced. One of
these 12 cloned plasmids contained a recombinant insert.
To determine if this result was indicative of the frequency

of recombination, an additional 127 clones were screened
for recombination by DNA hybridization using insertspecific oligonucleotide probes. All of the clones hybridized to one of the two probes utilized, but none hybridized to both. Therefore, only one recombinant was
present among 139 plasmid clones tested, suggesting that
the rate at which PCR produced recombinants was
approximately 0.007. At this rate, it is improbable (p <
0.05) that more than one of the apparent recombinants
observed among the 42 MSG sequences examined was
created during PCR. In addition, any given artifactual
recombination event would be relatively rare, and a
sequence that is observed multiple times is unlikely to be
an artifact. The three presumptive recombinants depicted
in Figure 8 were seen in multiple sequence reads.
Sequences A32, G51 and A171 were seen 40, 3 and 2
times, respectively.

Discussion
The relationship between the 281 non-identical MSG
sequences observed and the MSG gene family is subject to

interpretation. The 281 sequences do not represent 281
different MSG genes because several lines of evidence
indicate that there are only about 80 MSG genes in the
genome. These lines of evidence include the results of previous quantitative hybridization experiments [50,94] and
the results of quantitative PCR experiments described
herein. The 80-gene family model is also supported by
analysis of telomeric regions, where MSG genes are clustered. There are 17 P. carinii chromosomes each with two
telomeres. All 34 telomeres were observed to hybridize to
an MSG probe suggesting that there is at least one MSG
gene per chromosome end. If so, there must be at least 34
MSG genes in the genome [54]. Sequence data obtained
from 6 large telomeric DNA segments cloned into cosmid
vectors showed that the average number of MSG genes per
sequenced chromosome end was 2.2 [55]. If the other 28
telomeres, which were not present in the cosmid library,
adhere to the structures observed in the 6 cosmid clones,
then the P. carinii genome contains approximately 75
MSG genes. While the exact number of MSG gene at the
ends of 28 telomeres is not known, each of these locations
in the genome appears to contain approximately the same
number of MSG genes because all telomeric fragments
emitted similar amounts of radiation after having been
hybridized to a radioactive MSG probe [54].
Removing reads that could have contained an error
reduced the number of different sequences to from 281 to
158, a number approximately 2 times larger than the estimated size of the gene family. Allelic variation would
explain this apparent excess of sequence diversity. Allelic
variation in P. carinii has been described before, but seems
to be fairly rare among unique genes [95-98]. However,

allelic variation would be expected to be more common in
genes that are members of a family that confers the capacity to vary surface antigens at a high rate. Allelic variation
would also explain the presence of majority and minority
sequences in groups of sequences, and fits with the disproportionate presence of these sequences in different
populations of P. carinii.
Grouping sequence reads that were 95% or more identical
produced a set of 73 sequences that would appear to rep-

Page 14 of 22

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:367

resent most if not all of the genes in the MSG family. This
proposition is supported by three arguments.
First, the set of 73 sequences contained 13 of 13 previously obtained P. carinii MSG gene sequences [51,55].
Obtaining this result would be improbable if the genome
were to contain more than 91 different MSG gene
sequences (p ≤ 0.047). However, if the gene copy-number
is set at 77, then the observed result is ten times more
probable (p = 0.5) (see Methods). Similarly, the proposition that the 73 core sequences describe all or nearly all of
the MSG genes in the P. carinii genome was also supported by mark-recapture analysis [99], which produces
an estimate of a gene family size from the number of
sequences that are seen in two independently derived
samples, which in this case were the ADAM and Lucigen
libraries. The mark-recapture calculation suggested that
the MSG gene family contains 85 genes. It should be
noted, however, that the mark-recapture approach
assumes that each MSG gene was equally likely to be
observed. In fact, some MSG genes were observed numerous times while others were observed only once. The unevenness in the coverage of the gene family poses a major
caveat when interpreting the accuracy of the results
obtained with the mark-recapture analysis.
The second argument in favor of the proposition that the
73 sequences comprise a fairly complete picture of the
family is that the methods used to produce the sequence
reads would be expected to capture DNA segments from
all MSG genes. The inserts in the plasmid libraries were
generated by PCR that relied on priming from sequences
(CRJE and C2) that are conserved among members of the
gene family. By definition, MSG genes begin with a copy
of the CRJE. Therefore, priming from the CRJE should
amplify all MSG genes that contain a copy of the C2
region. Lack of the C2 region from one or more MSG gene
is theoretically possible. However, analysis of sequences
in the genome project database showed that the C2
primer binding site was present in all 448 sequence reads
that contained the CRJE and were long enough to contain
the C2 region. Therefore, if the genome contains MSG
genes that would fail to be amplified by the primers
employed, there are very few such genes. Even if the reliance on the presence of the C2 region had caused some
genes to be excluded from the ADAM plasmid library, the
genome project database would not be expected to be
similarly deficient because this database was obtained by
methods that did not rely on sequence conservation.
The third argument supporting the proposition that the
73 sequences comprise a fairly complete picture of the
family is that the database of 581 sequence reads would
seem to be large enough to virtually assure that all members of the family would be represented within it. Assuming that the gene family contains 80 genes, then the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/367

calculated probability of observing all family members by
sampling 581 times is approximately 0.999. The exact size
of the P. carinii MSG gene family is not known, but quantitative PCR experiments indicated that it contains no
more than 90 genes. If there are 90 genes in the family,
then the calculated probability of observing all family
members by sampling 581 times is still very high, approximately 0.998. While the number of sequence reads
obtained would seem to have been sufficient to produce a
complete picture of the family, a caveat to this proposition
arises from uncertainty about sample completeness. Sampling an 80-gene family 581 times should cover the family
an average of 7 times. Therefore, the average coverage per
gene should be approximately 7 fold. Yet, 31 of the different sequences in the set of 73 were seen only once, and the
10 largest groups of reads contained between 19 and 49
sequence reads each. These data depart significantly from
expectations based on probability, which predict that no
more than three of the genes would be represented less
than twice or more than 14 times. Cloning bias is the
probable cause of this deviation from expectation. It is
commonly observed that some parts of genomes are relatively resistant to cloning in bacterial vectors. Another factor that probably contributed to the observed unevenness
in coverage was that technical problems made it necessary
to pursue the Pneumocystis genome project in a manner
that would not be expected to produce equal coverage of
the genome (See Methods). Whatever caused it, uneven
coverage of the gene family would increase the chance of
missing genes. New sequencing techniques that do not
rely on cloning should help in addressing the possibility
of missing data in the set of 73 sequences. Although control experiments showed that mis-incorporation of nucleotides and recombination during PCR are rare enough to
discount these events as significant sources of the 31
sequences that were seen only once, the best way to confirm that a sequence is correct is to show that it can be
reproducibly obtained. Therefore, more sequence data
will be needed to confirm that the 31 singleton sequences
are correct.
The set of 73 core MSG sequences contained three regions
(CRJE, C1 and C2) where there was little to no variation
in at least 16 contiguous nucleotide positions. Several
other smaller regions (between 9 and 15 bp in length)
also exhibited no variation among the 73 sequences. Conservation of these sequence elements cannot be ascribed
to selection against changes in the encoded primary protein sequence because such selection would not prevent
synonymous variation. Therefore, it would appear that
the conserved nucleotides perform a function separate
from and in addition to encoding an amino acid.
One possible function of conserved DNA sequence elements is to facilitate DNA recombination. Data described
herein and previous studies indicate that donor MSG

genes have recombined with each other [55,59,84]. Conserved sequence elements facilitate the DNA strand
exchanges that occur during recombination. [100]. Conserved DNA sequence elements can also serve as targets
for a site-specific nucleases, which generate a double
stranded gap that is repaired via recombination with a
related DNA sequences [101]. Such repairs are often called
gene conversions because the DNA that fills the gap is
copied from donor DNA while it is being inserted. Therefore the donor DNA remains unchanged. Sometimes gap
repair also causes crossing-over [102]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several such nucleases including HO, Spo11 and
I-Sce1 [103-106]. HO and Spo11 function in controlling
mating type and meiotic recombination, respectively.
Therefore, these types of enzymes are needed to perform
fundamental functions, and it would not be surprising if
P. carinii possesses site-specific nucleases. Another possible role for conserved sequence elements would be as sites
for site-specific recombinases, which are enzymes that catalyze crossovers by facilitating breakage and reunion
between two copies of the site recognized by the recombinase [107].
Comparing the MSG genes at the expression site to donor
MSG genes might allow assessment of the roles of crossing-over and gene conversion in creating the sequence
diversity at the expression site. For example, if the gene at
the expression site were installed there by a reciprocal
cross-over, then the gene that is at the expression site will
have vacated its former locus and been replaced by the
gene that was formerly at the expression site. On the other
hand, if gene conversion causes a change at the expression
site, then the same sequence will exist at both the expression site and the donor site.
While high conservation of nucleotide tracts in MSG
genes might be needed to foster recombination, such conservation causes high conservation in certain parts of MSG
proteins, which would seem problematic if the function
of MSGs is to impart surface variation. However, the functional ramifications of diverse MSG proteins containing
invariant regions will be influenced by other factors, such
post-translational processing and three-dimensional
structure. The region encoded by the UCS and CRJE
appears to be present on the MSG proteins when they are
first produced, but not present on MSG proteins on the
cell surface [94]. The protein segments encoded by the C1
and C2 regions are rich in hydrophobic amino acids and
are probably buried within the MSG molecule, it which
case, they would be unlikely to be detected by the host
immune system.
The nucleotides located between conserved regions varied
to different degrees. The HV1 region was the most clearly
delineated, being located between the CRJE and C1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/367

which are both very highly conserved. Other hypervariable regions had less distinct borders. Sequence variation
included base substitutions and INDELS. Substitutions
often were nonsynonymous, a finding that suggests that
selection has favored changes that change the MSG protein encoded [108]. Selection for variation is consistent
with the idea that MSG genes confer the ability to deploy
protective antigenic variation. High frequency proteinchanging nucleotide variation has been observed to
extend beyond the first 325 bps of MSG genes, and probably does so in most if not all MSG genes. Previous analysis of 11 complete MSG genes showed that they varied
throughout their length and that positive selection caused
much of this variation [55].
INDELS did not often alter the reading frame because the
number of nucleotides involved in nearly all INDELS was
divisible by 3. It is interesting to note that despite the great
variation seen among the 581 sequence reads, nearly all of
these reads contained an open reading frame encoding an
MSG protein. These findings suggest that the entire gene
family is under selective pressure to continue encoding
intact MSG proteins that differ one from another.
Some of the regions in which INDELS were prevalent contained simple repeats, such as short run of A:T base pairs.
Such mononucleotide repeats are more prone to change
in size due to slippage of DNA polymerase during genome
replication, repair and recombination [109]. However,
most of the INDELS involved more complex sequences
that did not appear to have been formed via interactions
between short identical repeats.

Conclusion
A set of sequences that represents most if not all of the
members of the P. carinii MSG gene family was obtained.
The protein-changing nature of the variation among these
sequences suggests that the family has been shaped by
selection for protein variation, which is consistent with
the hypothesis that the MSG gene family functions to
enhance phenotypic variation among the members of a
population of P. carinii.
Understanding the P. carinii MSG gene family at the
sequence level provides an avenue through which to
assess the function of this family, which is currently
unknown, but presumably contributes to the ability of the
fungus to parasitize its host, Rattus norwegicus. With the
improved understanding of the family provided by the
studies described herein, it should be possible to determine if changes at the expression site involve gene conversions, crossovers, or both. It should also be possible to
learn more about the rate and mechanism of evolution of
MSG genes, which would be expected to be occurring rapidly via selection for mutation and recombination.

Methods
Construction of plasmid libraries
Two types of plasmid libraries containing DNA from P.
carinii MSG genes were generated. One type of library
(called ADAM) was made by cloning MSG gene DNA that
had been specifically amplified from genomic P. carinii
DNA. All of the ADAM plasmid clones contained inserts
that were made by amplifying genomic DNA using a
primer that binds to the CRJE, which marks the 5-prime
end of every MSG gene. The vast majority of plasmid
inserts contained segment that had been amplified using
primer C2 as the downstream primer. Primer C2 binds to
the C2 sequence, which is conserved among family members and located approximately 300 basepairs downstream of CRJE [66,69]. Additional libraries were made by
amplifying genomic DNA using the CRJE primer paired
with either primer C5 or C7, which bind to conserved
sequences located downstream of the C2 sequence [55].
Primers are listed in Additional file 3. The PCR products
were inserted into the plasmid vector TOPO 2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids were introduced into E.
coli strain TOP10 by standard methods [110].

The second type of plasmid library was made by Lucigen
Corporation [70,111]. The P. carinii genomic DNA used
to prepare Lucigen libraries was obtained from P. carinii
chromosomes that had been separated from each other,
and from most contaminants, via pulsed field gel electrophoresis [73,79,112]. After electrophoresis, either individual or small groups of P. carinii chromosomes were
extracted from the gel and used to create a number of different plasmid libraries [70,111]. The use of pulsed-field
gels to obtain P. carinii chromosomes was necessary
because the P. carinii used had been prepared from the
lungs of immunosuppressed infected rats, and contained
rat cells and DNA as well as assorted other microbes. The
use of rat lung was necessitated by the lack of sufficient
proliferation of P. carinii in culture. Shotgun cloning from
impure P. carinii DNA turned out to be very inefficient
because P. carinii DNA, which is rich in A:T basepairs,
competed poorly with DNA from the rat and from other
microbes coexisting with P. carinii in the infected rats. The
problem of cloning bias against P. carinii DNA was ameliorated by purifying P. carinii chromosomes.
Processing of the DNA from P. carinii chromosomes was
described by Sesterhenn et. al. [70,111]. Briefly, the DNA
was processed, either by restriction enzyme digestion or
sonication, to reduce it to an average size of approximately 2 kb [70,111]. DNA fragments were ligated to oligonucleotides that served as sites for PCR primers. DNA
segments produced by PCR amplification were ligated to
the Lucigen pSMART-HCKan cloning vector. Several Lucigen libraries were made, each from the fraction of the P.
carinii genome contained in the chromosome or set of
chromosomes excised from a region of a pulsed field gel.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/367

Different libraries contained different numbers of clones,
and the number of clones was not necessarily proportional to the number of basepairs of P. carinii genomic
DNA that was in a given chromosome or set of chromosomes. This situation predicted that coverage of the MSG
gene family would be uneven, and that some MSG genes
would be more frequently observed in the sequence reads
in the genome project database.
Obtaining and identifying MSG gene sequences
The inserts in 247 plasmids from the ADAM libraries were
sequenced by commercial sequencing facilities.
Sequences obtained from the ADAM plasmid libraries
were used to identify MSG reads in the Pneumocystis
genome project sequence database, nearly all of which
had been derived from Lucigen libraries. First, the ADAM
sequence reads were assembled using Gap4 software
[113] set at 1% maximum mismatch. This process identified 73 different sequences. These sequences were used to
perform an in silico search of the Pneumocystis genome
project sequence database. The 1156 sequence reads that
were 90% or more identical to one or more of the 73
ADAM sequences were placed in a database for further
analysis. The 1156 sequence reads contained 99.7% of the
CRJE-containing sequences in the Pneumocystis genome
project sequence database. A perl script http://
homepages.uc.edu/~keelysp/index.php
that
implemented Dynamic Programming was utilized to identify
which of the 1156 sequence reads contained both the
CRJE sequence and the C2 region [114]. The perl script
also truncated each read at the 5' terminus of the CRJE and
oriented the reads in a 5' to 3' direction. The sequence
reads that contained no more than 3 substitutions in the
CRJE were placed into a database. (Excluding sequences
with a CRJE sequence that was more divergent was done
in order to exclude any sequences that may have come
from P. wakefieldiae, which can co-infect rats that are
infected with P. carinii. P. wakefieldiae MSG genes start
with a CRJE that differs from that in P. carinii CRJE at 5
positions [75].) Some of the data in the genome project
database had been entered more than once. Duplicate
entries were removed. Also removed were sister reads and
reads containing ambiguous base calls. These procedures
left 334 high-quality sequence reads that contained the
CRJE and the C2 sequence, and were at least 90% identical
to one or more ADAM sequences. Combining the 334
genome project sequence reads with the 247 ADAM
sequences provided 581 sequences for comparative analysis, which is more than 7 times the number of genes in
the P. carinii MSG gene family, which contains approximately 80 genes [50,69,79,80].
Sequence alignment and comparison
The 581 sequence reads were assembled with Gap4 software [113]. The following software settings were utilized:
minimum initial match was 20, 25 maximum pads per
Page 17 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:367

read, and maximum percent mismatch of 5. To confirm
the results obtained with Gap4, the sequence reads were
also assembled with Cap3 [115]. Cap3 default settings
were used except the overlap percent identity cutoff was
set at 95%. DNA sequences were aligned using MAFFT
software using default settings [116]. The alignments were
optimized by introducing a limited number of gaps. The
relatedness of sequences was evaluated and depicted
using Mega 4.0 software [117].
The 581 sequence reads contained many reads that were
identical to one or more other reads. Removing duplicate
reads reduced the size of the database to 281. A downloadable file containing all 281 MSG sequences can be
found at http://homepages.uc.edu/~keelysp/dnasearch/
281diffsequences.fasta.
Assessing the influence of selection
The 281 sequence reads contained 123 reads that differed
from other reads at only one position. Given that such
minimal divergence could have been due to error, these
sequences were grouped with their close relatives, which
left 158 reads that differed at more than one site. Analysis
of the 158 reads showed that all but 31 of them could be
grouped into one of 42 groups, the members of which differed by no more than five percent, which could have
been due to allelic variation. To simplify analysis of the
influence of selection on the gene family, consensus
sequence was derived from each of the 42 groups. Combining the 42 consensus sequences with the 31 singleton
sequences produced a core set of 73 sequences, 67 of
which contained a single open reading frame (ORF)
encoding an MSG polypeptide. The 73 sequences can be
downloaded at http://homepages.uc.edu/~keelysp/dna
search/73diffsequences.fasta. The 67 DNA sequences with
a single open reading frame were aligned with the aid of
RevTrans
software
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
RevTrans/[87], which is a program that takes a set of DNA
sequences, virtually translates them, aligns the peptide
sequences, and uses this alignment as a scaffold for constructing the alignment of the corresponding DNA
sequences. The numbers of synonymous substitutions,
non-synonymous substitutions, insertions and deletions
were calculated using SNAP http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/con
tent/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html[88].

The software package MEGA 4.0 was used to assess the
role of selection in the substitutions seen among MSG
genes [117,118]. All possible pairs of sequences were analyzed. The average number of synonymous substitutions
(dS) and the average number of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) were obtained (gaps were ignored). The variance of the difference between dS and dN was estimated
by the bootstrap method using 500 replicates. The Z-test
statistic was obtained from the following: Z = (dN - dS)/
SQRT(Var(dS) + Var(dN)).

Tests for recombination
The 67 sequences with an MSG-encoding ORF were
aligned with Bioedit software [119]. Recombination tests
were performed with RDP2 software [90], which uses
probabilistic tests to identify probable recombinants. In
addition, each of the 73 core sequences was divided into
3 segments, a, b and c. The "a" segments were aligned to
each other, as were the b and c segments. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed for each segment using MEGA
4.0 software. To assess recombination, the trees were
examined for cases where different genes were identical in
one or two segments. Extensive local identity within
regions that vary globally is indicative of recombination.
Control experiments to assess recombination during PCR
To determine if recombination occurred during PCR, two
plasmids carrying different MSG genes (A and O) were
mixed together and subjected to PCR. PCR was performed
under the following conditions: 94°C hot start for 3 minutes, 20 (for 1 × 106 copies) or 30 cycles (for 2 × 104 copies) of incubation at 94°C for 60 sec, 55°C for 120 sec and
72°C for 60 sec followed by 1 cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes. Reaction volumes were 25 ul containing 100 uM
each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 1 U of Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison WI), 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 50 ng each
of IG1 and C6 primers (see Additional file 3). The amplicons produced were approximately 1300 bp in size, as
expected. The amplicons were inserted into the TOPO 4.0
plasmid vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain TOP10 by the One
Shot Chemical Transformation Protocol as described in
the TOPO TA cloning kit manual (Invitrogen). To detect
colonies with recombinant plasmid inserts, a DNA
hybridization screen was employed. Colonies to be
screened were picked and arrayed on Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire UK)
that were sitting on a surface of nutrient agar [110]. The
agar plates and inoculated membranes were incubated
overnight at 37°C to allow colonies to expand. To prepare
a "colony blot", plasmid DNA was released from bacterial
colonies and fixed to the membrane by standard methods
employing alkaline lysis, neutralization and desiccation
in high salt [110]. Radioactive oligonucleotides to be used
as probes were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase
(Invitrogen) [110]. The four oligonucleotides employed
are listed in Additional file 3. Oligonucleotides A1 and A2
were specific for the MSG A gene sequence, while oligonucleotides O1 and O2 were specific for the MSG O gene
sequence.

Hybridization was performed in Rapid-Hyb (GE Healthcare) at 42°C for 18 hours. After hybridization, membranes were washed at room temperature for 30 minutes
in a buffer containing 6× SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M NaCitrate) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and then
washed for 1 hour in a buffer containing 3 M tetramethPage 18 of 22

yammonium chloride, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8·0, 2 mM
EDTA, 0·1% SDS [120] utilizing the temperatures listed
in Additional file 3. Bound radioactive probe was detected
by autoradiography. As a positive control, each colony
blot contained a colony carrying a plasmid designed to
hybridize to all probes.
Quantification of the number of MSG loci in the genome
by real-time PCR
To measure the number of MSG loci in the P. carinii
genome, genomic DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR
performed in a Cepheid Smart Cycler using Smart Cycler
software version 1.2d (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95°C hot start for
120 seconds, 40 cycles of incubation at 95°C for 15 sec,
51°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 15 sec, and 80°C for 10 seconds
with optics set to detect SYBR Green fluorescence. Reaction volumes were 25 ul containing 100 uM each of dATP,
dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 3 U of Tfl polymerase (Epicenter), 5
mM MgCl2, 1 μl of a 1:20,000 dilution of SYBR Green I
(BioWhitaker Molecular Applications), 20 ng of each
primer and approximately 1 microgram of P. carinii DNA.
Primers CRJE-RT and C1 (Additional file 3) were used in
reactions designed to amplify all of the MSG genes in the
genome. Primers -145 and anti-AUG [69] were used in
reactions designed to amplify the UCS, under the same
conditions given above except the annealing temperature
used was 45°C. Amplification was monitored by the
increase in SYBR Green fluorescence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/367

than 73 MSG genes, the relationship between the chance of
observing all 13 of the previously known MSG genes, and
the actual size of the gene family was assessed as follows. If
the actual size of the MSG gene family is X, then the probability that the set of 73 genes will contain a given family
member is obtained by dividing 73 by X. For example, if
there are 80 genes in the family, then the probability of
observing any particular gene in the set of 73 is 73/80 =
0.9125. The probability of observing all 13 of the 13 known
MSG genes is (0.9125)13 = 0.3. Therefore, the hypothesis that
the gene family contains 80 members is consistent with the
fact that all 13 genes were present in the core set of 73 MSG
sequences. By contrast, when the size of the gene family is set
at 92, the probability of observing all of the 13 known MSG
genes is 0.047. When the size of the gene family is set at 158,
the probability of observing the 13 known MSG genes is only
4 × 10-5.
Mark-recapture method
The total number of MSG genes was also estimated using
a modified Petersen-Lincoln estimator [99]. The method
uses data from two independent samples drawn from the
same population. In this case, the P. carinii genome was
the population, and the two samples were the sequences
from the ADAM and Lucigen libraries. In brief, the estimator used the number of different sequences in each sample, and the number of sequences seen in both samples,
to calculate the probable the size of the gene family.

Abbreviations
The amount of the target DNA in a given PCR tube was
inferred from the number of cycles required to reach a
threshold level of SYBR Green fluorescence. A standard
curve relating threshold cycle to DNA amount was produced by observing the number of cycles required to reach
a threshold level of SYBR Green fluorescence in reactions
containing known amounts of a plasmid carrying an
insert that amplified with both pairs of primers.
Assessment of the completeness of the set of 73 core
sequences
If the set of 73 core sequences contains all MSG genes, then
every MSG gene sequence drawn from any other source will
be found in the 73. If the set of 73 core sequences does not
contain all MSG genes, then there will be a probability that a
given subset of MSG genes sequences drawn from another
source will be found in the 73. The probability of observing
the subset will decline as the sizes of the gene family and subset increase. Therefore, one can assess the completeness of
the set of 73 core sequences by determining if it contains
some or all of a previously described set of MSG genes. When
the set of 73 was searched for the sequences from 13 previously described MSG genes [51,55], all 13 were found. This
result was consistent with the proposition that the set of 73
contains all MSG genes. To evaluate the chance that such a
result would occur even if the genome were to contain more
