Taxonomically restricted genes are associated
with the evolution of sociality in the honey bee
Brian R Johnson* and Neil D Tsutsui

Abstract
Background: Studies have shown that taxonomically restricted genes are significant in number and important for
the evolution of lineage specific traits. Social insects have gained many novel morphological and behavioral traits
relative to their solitary ancestors. The task repertoire of an advanced social insect, for example, can be 40-50 tasks,
about twice that of a solitary wasp or bee. The genetic basis of this expansion in behavioral repertoire is still poorly
understood, and a role for taxonomically restricted genes has not been explored at the whole genome level.
Results: Here we present comparative genomics results suggesting that taxonomically restricted genes may have
played an important role in generating the expansion of behavioral repertoire associated with the evolution of
eusociality. First, we show that the current honey bee official gene set contains about 700 taxonomically restricted
genes. These are split between orphans, genes found only in the Hymenoptera, and genes found only in insects.
Few of the orphans or genes restricted to the Hymenoptera have been the focus of experimental work, but several
of those that have are associated with novel eusocial traits or traits thought to have changed radically as a
consequence of eusociality. Second, we predicted that if taxonomically restricted genes are important for
generating novel eusocial traits, then they should be expressed with greater frequency in workers relative to the
queen, as the workers exhibit most of the novel behavior of the honey bee relative to their solitary ancestors. We
found support for this prediction. Twice as many taxonomically restricted genes were found amongst the genes
with higher expression in workers compared to those with higher expression in queens. Finally, we compiled an
extensive list of candidate taxonomically restricted genes involved in eusocial evolution by analyzing several caste
specific gene expression data sets.
Conclusions: This work identifies a large number of candidate taxonomically restricted genes that may have
played a role in eusocial evolution. This work thus lays the foundation for future functional genomics work on the
evolution of novelty in the context of social behavior. We also present preliminary evidence, based on biased
patterns of gene expression, that taxonomically restricted genes may have played a role in the evolution of caste
systems, a characteristic lineage specific social trait.

Background
Division of labor, a hallmark of advanced insect sociality,
has long attracted attention from biologists, as these systems of polyphenism are some of the most elaborate in
the animal kingdom [1-3]. The honey bee, for example,
has queen and worker physical morphs, along with 4
physiologically-based worker castes [4-6]. Great progress
has been made in recent years towards unraveling how
changes in the regulation of juvenile hormone and vitellogenin underlie these adaptively regulated differences in

phenotype [3,6]. These successes have strengthened the
view that changes to an insect groundplan (conserved
sets of genes organized into stable networks that underlie traits such as reproductive behavior) are central to
eusocial evolution [7-11].
Although changes to an insect groundplan are
undoubtedly a major force in eusocial evolution, it is
likely that other mechanisms have also played a role in
the evolution of distinctive eusocial traits. In particular,
we hypothesize that the origin of eusociality may have
involved novel genes. If so, many of these new genes
would likely be taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs),
orphan sequences not found outside a species or only

found in a particular taxonomic group [12-17]. TRGs
make up ~10-20% of the genes in every genome
sequenced to date [16]. In Drosophila melanogaster, the
species with the most complete and accurate genome,
TRGs make up approximately 18.6% of genes [18]. In
addition to being abundant, TRGs are important for
generating lineage specific traits [16,19]. In Drosophila,
for example, novel courtship behavior was found to be
partially dependent on a novel gene, sphinx [19]. Likewise in Hydra, changes in the expression of a TRG are
important for species specific differences in tentacle formation [20]. Finally, species that rely on toxins for predatory behavior or defense possess specialized venoms
with taxonomically restricted occurrence [21].
Here we explore for the first time, using comparative
genomics, whether TRGs could have played a broad role
in eusocial evolution. Honey bee biology allows for a
simple test of this possibility. The honey bee queen is
characterized by a sharp reduction in behavioral and morphological complexity [22]. The behavior of the queen is
largely limited to fighting other queens and laying eggs,
while her morphology is missing many traits present in
the workers [22]. The workers, in contrast, exhibit highly
derived lineage-specific behavior thought to have evolved
since the origin of eusociality. Workers, for example, feed
the larvae a specialized secretion, build the complex nest,
and forage cooperatively in a system dependent on
advanced communication not seen in their solitary ancestors [23,24]. If TRGs are important for generating the
expansion of behavioral complexity associated with the
evolution of eusociality, we predict that TRGs limited to
eusocial species should be disproportionately associated
with the worker caste relative to the queen case.
This study has four goals. First, we test the hypothesis
that TRGs are associated with eusocial evolution by analyzing an extensive list of genes that are differentially
expressed between honey bee castes [25,26]. Second, we
explore the frequency and characteristics of TRGs in the
honey bee genome. We classify each gene in the official
gene set into a TRG category and then determine basic
characteristics of these genes, such as protein size, exon
number, transcript support, and so forth. We then use
Interproscan [27] to functionally annotate as many
TRGs as possible. We also reevaluate the nature of
insect-specific proteins, incorporating data from several
recently sequenced insect and arthropod genomes.
Third, we test whether TRGs (orphans or those limited
to the hymenoptera) are expressed in a gland known to
be involved in a derived eusocial behavior. Finally, we
generate a list of candidate TRGs potentially involved in
eusocial evolution. These are TRGs associated with the
evolution of either queen/worker dimorphism, a gland
specialized for a novel function, or division of labor
amongst the workers.

Results and Discussion
TRGs in the honey bee official gene set 2

The honey bee official gene set is biased towards conserved genes, as conservation was a factor in determining
which gene predictions to include [28]. Our purpose in
this section is therefore not to quantify the absolute
abundance of TRGs in the honey bee genome, as this
analysis awaits characterization of the many gene predictions that are not in the official gene set. Our goals, in
contrast, are to determine (1) if there are large numbers
of TRGs within the official gene set, and (2), to identify
the characteristics and functions of these TRGs. In short,
we used blastp and tblastn along with the protein sets
and genomes of 27 species (23 insects, tick, human,
C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae) to search for homologs for
each honey bee gene in each of the species, using an
E value of 10-4 as the cutoff [12-15]. The results of this
analysis were used to construct a database to which
queries were made to identify TRGs. Genes identified as
TRGs were then blasted against the current NCBI nr
protein database to ensure their correct homology classification. TRGs were then interrogated with Interproscan
to functionally annotate as many as possible.
Figure 1 shows the number of genes in the honey bee
official gene set 2 (OGS2) without homologs in each of
the other species. The number of such genes varies
roughly with taxonomic distance, with closely related
species tending to have more homologs and distantly
related species fewer. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of
TRGs in OGS2. 696 genes were TRGs, 6806 were present in all metazoans, and 3197 showed other patterns
of occurrence. Among the TRGs, we identified 5 classes
(see methods for definitions): orphans (182 genes),

Figure 1 Number of genes in honey bee OGS2 without
homologs in other genomes. Although all 12 Drosophila genomes
were used, only Drosophila melanogaster is shown because all
Drosophila species had very similar numbers of homologs with Apis
mellifera. Number of genes without homologs roughly followed
taxonomic relatedness with the closely related ants having
homologs for the largest number of Apis mellifera genes.

honey bee genes

and non-taxonomically restricted categories.

Hymenoptera (69 genes), social insect (103 genes),
Hymenoptera-conserved (133 genes), and insect-specific
(209 genes). Table 1 shows the characteristics of genes
in each taxonomic category. As for orphans in other
species such as Drosophila and primates, honey bee
orphans are shorter than highly conserved sequences,
have fewer exons, and fewer of them have transcript
support. Thus, as per previous studies, it is possible that
honey bee TRGs (orphans and genes limited to the
Hymenoptera) are young genes formed via a variety of
mechanisms such as gene duplication, exaptation from
transposable elements, horizontal transfer, and de novo
gene formation [14,29]. Future work on the identified
TRGs will explore these questions.
The mean size of orphans in the present study is larger
than that found in many previous studies of orphans
[12-15], reflecting the probability that the official gene set
is missing many orphans. There are additional reasons to
suspect that the actual number of TRGs (in all taxonomic
classes) in the honey bee genome is significantly
higher than that found within the official gene set.
First, Drosophila melanogaster, with a better assembled

genome, and most other sequenced insects, have
approximately 10-20% TRGs [12,16,18]. Second, inclusion in the honey bee official gene set was partly based
on homology with other sequences. Hence, thousands of
gene predictions were not included in the official set,
which is only 10,699 genes (a small number compared to
most other holometabolous insects). Further, when we
manually aligned ESTs from the brain cDNA library used
by Grozinger et al [25] to gene predictions not in the official gene set, we were able to unambiguously identify 268
genes. As the cDNA libarary is from the brain alone, it is
likely that many of the gene predictions not in the official
gene set are real genes that will be annotated when more
tissue specific gene expression studies are conducted in
the honey bee.
As expected, few of the TRGs in the highly restricted
categories (orphans, Hymenoptera, Hymenoptera conserved, and social insect) have been the focus of experimental work (18 genes) or could be characterized with
Interproscan (3 genes). However, the functions of many
of these genes are consistent with the hypothesis that
highly restricted TRGs are associated with lineage specific traits, including eusocial behavior. Most of the
named TRGs fell into a few classes: venoms, cuticle proteins, silk proteins, immune genes, and odorant binding
proteins. Although these genes are likely associated with
both lineage specific traits in general, and eusocial evolution, odorant binding (olfactory behavior in the context of pheromone based communication) and immunity
(defense again pathogens in the crowded hive) are
thought to be associated with unique selection pressures
in the context of eusocial evolution [30,31]. That many
TRGs found only in the Hymenoptera are involved in
novel behavior is encouraging and suggests that the
other TRGs in these categories are interesting candidates for genes underlying lineage specific and or novel
eusocial traits. Table 2 lists all named or functionally
annotated TRGs.

using different methods, identified a smaller number of
such genes, 51. There is nearly no overlap in the insect
specific genes found in these two studies [Additional file
1: Supplemental Table S1]. There are three reasons for
this difference. First, Zhang et al required extensive coverage as well as a significant blast hit for homology.
This is an unusual requirement that has not been used
in other studies, probably because distant homologs,
such as those between insects and mammals, often have
low coverage scores even when they have extremely low
E values. Thus, most of the genes identified by Zhang
et al [13] as insect specific were classified as metazoan
specific in this study, as they had strong blast hits across
all tested groups. Second, because the previous study
required a high coverage score for homology between
insect genes, many genes that could be classified as
homologs were left off of the list. Hence, the list of
insect specific genes in the present study is larger.
Finally, no arthropod genomes, other than those of
insects, had been sequenced when the previous study
was performed and many genes identified as insect specific were found to be arthropod specific, as they are
found in arachnids (tick) or crustaceans (Daphnia).
Cuticle proteins and hemocyanins are two classes of
genes that fall into the category of arthropod specific.
The Interproscan analysis of the insect specific genes
found in the present study, using honey bee genes as
the queries, found that nearly half (45.9%) are odorant
binding proteins, 34.0% are uncharacterized, with the

rest falling into numerous categories [Additional file 2:
Supplemental Table S2].
Role of gene duplications in generating Hymenopteran
TRGs

Gene duplication followed by rapid sequence divergence
in one of the paralogs is a well explored mechanism for
generating novel genes (29, 32). A simple mechanism
for identifying such cases is to blast a TRG against all
the genes within the same genome and determine
whether any of the geneâs paralogs are widely conserved
(14). We conducted such an analysis with TRGs in all
categories to determine a minimum percentage of these
genes that could have evolved via gene duplication.
Figure 3 shows that relatively few (6.04-12.88%) of the
TRGs in the most taxonomically restricted categories
(orphans, Hymenoptera, social insect, Hymenopteraspecific) could be shown to have evolved by gene duplication. Insect specific genes were much more likely to
be part of a gene family with members that are homologous with genes found outside the insects (43.6% of
genes). A list of all TRGs with parent genes in the
honey bee genome that are widely conserved is provided
[Additional file 3: Supplemental Table S3].
TRGs in eusocial evolution

Grozinger et al [25] determined gene expression in 5547
ESTs in the brains of queens and workers. After aligning
these ESTs to genes, we identified 663 genes with higher

Figure 3 Percentages of Apis mellifera genes in taxonomically

taxonomically restricted categories have paralogs that show
homology to genes outside their taxonomic class. Hence, there is
little support for most of these genes having formed via gene
duplication followed by rapid sequence divergence. A much higher
percentage of insect specific genes could, however, have evolved in
this fashion, as a high percentage of such genes have paralogs that
are widely conserved.

expression in queens, 537 with higher expression in
workers, and 1880 that were not differentially expressed.
We then determined the homology classification of each
gene in all three sets. We found that homology status
and differential gene expression were not independent
(Chi Square Test: c2 = 17.81, df = 2, p < 0.001; Table 3).
Given that the largest percentage deviation came from
TRGs expressed in the worker caste (82.7%), we conclude
that TRGs were overrepresented amongst genes with
higher expression in workers relative to those that were
not differentially expressed or had higher expression in
queens. Most of the orphans in all three groups (worker,
queen, or non-differentially expressed) came from gene
predictions not included in the official honey bee gene
set. These genes, however, all have transcript support
and are almost certainly real genes. We repeated this
analysis with different cut-off p-values (for determining
significant differences in gene expression) and found that
this pattern remains significant down to a p-value of
0.001 (below which there are insufficient data for meaningful comparisons). A table with these additional analyses is presented in the supplemental information
[Additional file 4: Supplemental Table S4].
We also looked for differences in the number of TRGs
differentially expressed in the brains of nurses and foragers [27]. Although foragers have more complex behavior than nurses, a prediction is not straight forward
because although nurse bee behavior is simple, it is also
quite derived [6]. Alaux et al [27] determined gene
expression in 1439 ESTs in nurses and foragers. After
aligning ESTs to genes from this study, we identified

879 genes with higher expression in nurses and
504 with higher expression in foragers. We found that
TRGs did not occur with different frequency between
nurses and foragers (Chi Square Test: c2 = 0.49, df = 1,
p = 0.48).
Three major innovations characterize eusocial evolution: division of labor, advanced communication systems, and an expanded task repertoire (7-9, 24). We
focused on the third innovation, which is poorly understood at the genetic level. We found that orphans are
disproportionately associated with the worker caste relative to the queen caste. This suggests that novel genes
may have been important in generating the lineage specific eusocial traits that characterize task repertoire
expansion, because workers perform more derived and
novel tasks than queens. This initial analysis is based on
patterns of gene expression in the brain alone. Future
work on more tissues should shed light as to how widespread this pattern is in bees and other social insects.
Future work will also assess which of the novel genes
are associated with lineage specific traits having little to
do with eusocial evolution, and which are associated
with novel eusocial tasks such as complex nest building,
nestmate recognition, and pheromone production.
Role of TRGs in a gland specialized for a social function

The hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) is specialized for caste
specific behavior in worker honey bees [6,22]. The genes
expressed in this gland are therefore of interest for
determining what role TRGs may have played in eusocial evolution. The genes from a cDNA library constructed from HPG ESTs supplied by the Robinson Lab,
was therefore analyzed to search for candidate TRGs
potentially involved in lineage specific brood care, or
other caste specific behaviors associated with this gland.
Overall, 7 orphans or TRGs found only in the Hymenoptera (out of 106 genes total that could be identified
from ESTs) are highly expressed in the hypopharyngeal
gland. Only one has a name, Apisimin, an orphan
known to be an important component of royal jelly
[33]. A list of all those ESTs that could be aligned to
genes from the hypopharyngeal gland are provided in
the supplemental information along with the classification of each gene [Additional file 5: Supplemental
Table S5].
The analysis of the genes highly expressed in the
hypopharyngeal gland showed that TRGs make up a
relatively small portion of expressed genes. However,
many of the genes in the full list are clearly housekeeping genes and the important question concerns the
genetic basis of the novel eusocial traits associated with
this gland. The gland secretes a proteinacious brood
food, and caste development signal, in nurse bees, and
produces enzymes necessary for conversion of nectar to

honey in older bees [6,34]. The nature of the brood food
is well understood. Most of the protein content of this
secretion is composed of royal jelly proteins, derived
members of the yellow protein family [35]. Hence, the
genetic basis of most of this glandâs specialized secretion
is not based on TRGs. However, the number of royal
jelly proteins in an insect genome is not conserved and
the number in the honey bee could have expanded in
response to selection for specialized brood food. The
difficultly with this hypothesis is that Nasonia, a solitary
wasp, also has many royal jelly proteins. However, Nasoniaâs royal jelly proteins appear to be closer in relationship to one another than to those of the honey bees,
suggesting they have a different origin [36]. Hence,
novel genes (albeit associated with the expansion of a
gene family rather than orphans) could have been central to the evolution of this case of specialization.
Finally, at least 1 orphan, Apisimin, plays an important
role in the hypopharyngeal gland, by interacting with
the royal jelly proteins [33]. Given that we identified
several other TRGs expressed in this gland, it is possible

that TRGs have also been important for this case of
eusocial evolution.
Candidate TRGs involved in eusocial evolution

Based on gene expression differences between workers
and queens, nurses and foragers, and expression in the
HP gland, we identified 146 TRGs (orphans or genes
found only in the Hymenoptera) that are candidates for
playing a role in eusocial evolution [Additional file 6:
Supplemental Table S6]. 7 TRGs with bioinformatically
inferred functions thought to be associated with eusocial
evolution were found in this data set. One gene, apisimin, experimentally shown to be involved in eusocial
evolution in the context of specialized brood care, is in
this data set. This suggests that experimental characterization of the other candidates should be productive.
Perhaps the most interesting pattern is that three TRGs
associated with silk production in larva were found to
differ in expression between adults.
Silk proteins in the honey bee, like those in several
other groups of insects, are highly diverged, and probably

Johnson and Tsutsui BMC Genomics 2011, 12:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/164

have an independent origin from other insect silks [37].
Three of the five genes underlying silk production were
found in the gene set of proteins differing between nurses
and foragers (GB12085, GB15233, and GB17818). This is
surprising, as silk is used by larva for cocoon construction. There are two possible solutions for this paradox.
One, either the silk genes are not expressed in the brain,
and are actually expressed in the labial glands, the glands
that produce silk in the larva, or these genes have evolved
radically different functions in the adult brain. Micro-dissection of insect brains is not error free and it is known
that contamination from the hypopharyngeal glands
occurs [25,27]. Although speculative, it is possible that
material from the labial glands, which are also in the
head capsule, are present in brain dissections. If so, then
perhaps the silk proteins and silk glue could have evolved
a function related to pheromone deposition or transmission, as the labial glands may be involved in pheromonal
communication in adult honey bees [38].

social insect can be 40-50 tasks, about twice that of a
solitary wasp or bee [40]. Our work identifies TRGs that
may play a role in the evolution of such lineage specific
traits. First, we found support for our hypothesis that
highly restricted TRGs should be disproportionately
associated with the worker caste relative to the queen
caste because workers exhibit the novel behavior of
honey bees. Second, our analysis of homology patterns
of genes within the official gene set found about 500
orphans or TRGs found only in the Hymenoptera
(orphans, Hymenoptera, social insect, Hymenopteraconserved). Many of those that have been the focus of
experimental work are associated with novel eusocial
traits. Finally, we compiled an extensive list of candidate
TRGs that could be associated with the evolution of
eusociality. This work should facilitate and encourage
further work on the role played by TRGs in eusocial
evolution.

Methods
Relationship to previous studies of eusocial evolution

Sequence data sets

The honey bee has been the subject of a number of studies seeking to understand the genetic basis of particular
traits known to be important for eusocial evolution (3031, 33-35, 37). Viljakainen et al (31) found rapid evolution in immunity genes, for example, while Bilikova et al
(33) found a novel protein involved in brood care, Apisimin. Likewise, studies have found increases or decreases
in gene families known to be involved in eusocial evolution (30, 35). This study identified all of the previously
discovered novel genes, along with many more candidates for future study. This work hence builds on previous research by suggesting how important novel genes
may be across the genome. In the most relevant previous study, Hunt et al (10) found that genes with
higher expression in queens have higher evolutionary
rates than genes with higher expression in workers. At
first glance, this appears to contradict the results of
the present study, which is that genes with higher
expression in workers are more likely to be novel, or
taxonomically restricted. However, a simple possible
explanation for the difference between the two studies is
that although queens do not exhibit novel traits, they do
exhibit highly derived versions of ancestral traits (related
to reproduction). Workers in contrast do novel things
altogether. Hence, we could expect derived versions of
the same genes in queens and different genes altogether
in workers. This hypothesis is speculative, of course, and
will need to await verification in future studies.

A total of 27 genomes were used in this study. The Apis
mellifera protein set (OGS2) and abinitio gene predictions were downloaded from BeeBase. Ant protein sets
and genomes (Linepethelia and Pogonomyrmex), were
obtained from the ant genome working group. The Tribolium genome and protein sequences were obtained
from beetlebase. Protein sets and genomes for 12 Drosophila species were downloaded from flybase. Protein
and genome data sets for Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, Pediculus, and Iozides were downloaded from vectorbase.
Bombyx proteins and genome were downloaded from
the silkworm genome database. The human genome was
downloaded from UCSC, while human proteins were
obtained from NCBI. The C. elegans genome and proteins were obtained from wormbase. Yeast proteins and
genome were obtained from Saccaromyces Genome
Database. Nasonia and Acyrthosiphon (pea aphid) genomes were obtained from HGSC, while their protein
sets were obtained from NCBI. The latest version of the
protein set and genome was used in all cases.

Conclusions
Social insects have gained many new morphological and
behavioral traits relative to their solitary ancestors
[reviewed 24, 39]. The task repertoire of an advanced

Gene homology classification

We classified honey bee genes into 7 categories:
orphans, Hymenoptera, social insect, Hymenopteraconserved, insect specific, metazoan, and other. Orphans
were genes for which we could find no homologs in any
species, defining homology as a blast hit with an E value
of less than 10-4 [12-15]. Hymenoptera includes genes
for which we could find at least one homolog in a
Hymenopteran species, but no homologs anywhere else.
Social insect means that the gene was found in all social
insect genomes used in the study (Linepethelia, Atta,
and Pogonomyrmex), but none other. Hymenoptera

Johnson and Tsutsui BMC Genomics 2011, 12:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/164

means the gene was found in all Hymenopteran species
but none other. Insect specific means the gene was
found in all insect genomes, but not in any non insect.
Metazoan means the gene was found in all metazoans
(with no reference to whether it is also present in single
celled organisms). Thus, metazoan is the category that
includes most conserved genes. Finally, âotherâ included
genes that did not show a pattern of homology that correlates with phylogeny or showed a taxonomic pattern
that was not examined in this study.
Our procedure for classification was as follows. We
used the current version of stand alone blast (2.23) with
default parameters for all initial assignments. We began
with the set of all protein translations from the honey
bee OGS2. We used blastp to search for a homolog for
each protein in each of the 27 other species-level protein sets. Those genes for which we could find no
homolog in any alternative-spliced form became the
gene set used for the next set of searches, which was to
use tblastn to search for a homolog against the same
speciesâ genome. For each species we used all available
genomic data. This ranged from one file for the entire
genome for Drosophila and Bombyx, to separate files for
scaffolds, contigs, and reads for the ants, and several
other species. The results of this initial analysis (blasts
against individual species proteins and genomes) were
used to create 27 lists of each gene in the OGS2 that
indicated whether it is present or absent in a particular
species. This first stage of the process was conducted
using in-house scripts. The 27 hashes were then
uploaded into a database from which queries were made
to determine the phylogenetic classification of each
gene. All TRGs that emerged (orphans, Hymenoptera,
social insect, Hymenoptera-conserved, and insect specific) were then searched against the current non redundant protein data base at NCBI using blastp. Several
genes initially assigned to the various taxonomic categories were found in species such as Bombus (bumble
bee), Polistes (paper wasp), daphnia, hydra, or chicken
and moved to the correct classification.
Gene characteristics

For each gene in 6 categories of conservation (orphan,
Hymenoptera, Hymenoptera-conserved, social insect,
insect-specific, and metazoan), we used scripts to determine protein length, gene length, GC content, number
of exons, and whether the gene has transcript support.
Gene length was parsed from gff files obtained from
beebase, while transcript support was determined using
stand alone tblastn, with word size = 20, seg turned off,
ungapped setting, and E value cutoff of 10-4. Each gene
was blasted against all honey bee ESTs (downloaded
from NCBI). Changing the E value cutoff to 10 -8 , or

Page 8 of 10

lower, changes the number of alignments, but not the
ratio between classes.
Interproscan annotation

Functional annotations of genes in each taxonomically
restricted category were determined using interproscan.
For each gene all output from interproscan was collected and analyzed. Little data resulted from the
searches of strongly taxonomically restricted genes, but
much data was collected for insect specific genes.
Gene duplication analyses

The goal of these analyses is to determine which TRGs
have paralogs (in the honey bee) that are more conserved than the TRG. When this is true, it suggests that
the TRG could have evolved by a gene duplication followed by rapid sequence divergence. Hence, we blasted
all TRGs against all honey bee gene predictions and
genes in OGS2. Those TRGs that had paralogs were
then further analyzed to determine if any of the paralogs
had homologs outside the original taxonomic class of
the parent gene. For orphans, this meant at least one of
the geneâs paralogs had a homolog in another species.
For genes in the classes Hymenoptera-conserved, Hymenopter-other, and Social Insect, one of a geneâs paralogs
had to have a homolog outside the Hymenoptera. For
insect-specific proteins, this meant that a gene had a
honey bee paralog that had a homolog outside the
insects.
Data sets from Grozinger et al [25], Alaux et al [27], and
HPG genes

For each data set on genes involved in eusocial behavior
or evolution we performed the same basic procedure.
The goal was first to identify as many genes as possible
from the ESTs used in the microarrays, and second to
determine the taxonomic classification of each identified
gene. We chose to focus on genes (proteins) only and
not on ESTs for blast searches because EST alignments
to species other than the one from which they were
generated have a high error rate.
From Christina Grozinger we received a spreadsheet
containing raw data from Grozinger et al [25]. This consisted of lists of ESTs/genes expressed at a higher level in
queens relative to workers, and those expressed at a
higher level in workers relative to queens (statistical
methodologies given in Grozigner et al [25]). A third
category of ESTs/genes non-differentially expressed was
found by subtracting the first two lists from the complete
list of ESTs/genes in the microarrary (also provided by
Grozinger). From the supplemental information from
Alaux et al [27] we obtained similar data for ESTs/genes
expressed at a higher rate in nurses or foragers. Finally,

Johnson and Tsutsui BMC Genomics 2011, 12:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/164

from Gene Robinson we obtained a list of ESTs/genes
expressed in the hypopharyngeal glands.
Each data set consisted of genes for which the original
authors were able to align ESTs from the microarray to
genes and unaligned ESTs. Our first step was to align as
many of the unaligned ESTs to genes as possible. This
is for two reasons. First, a new official gene set has been
released since one of these studies, and second, the
automated alignment procedure used in these studies
would be unlikely to align ESTs to small genes (orphans
are known to be small genes). This is because the automated alignment procedure used required that almost
the entire EST align to a gene. As the ESTs averaged
about 400 nucleotides and many orphans are genes
shorter than 60 amino acids, this is impossible. ESTs
can, however, be aligned to small genes manually.
Hence, we first ran an automated search with a script
and blastx to attempt to align each EST to either a
member of the official gene set or an abinito prediction,
using E value 10 -4 as the cutoff. We then manually
aligned each positive hit, again using blastx, against the
protein to ensure that the alignment was correct. Only
ESTs with a large ungapped alignment to a single gene
were considered matches. A list of all manual alignments is included in the supplemental information
[Additional file 7: Supplemental Table S7]. In total, we
manually aligned 51 additional ESTs that were expressed
at higher rates in queens, 71 expressed higher in workers, 146 that were not differentially between queens and
workers, 8 expressed higher in nurses, and 13 expressed
higher in foragers.
