Abstract

Metabolic network reconstruction based on the knowledge of
annotated genomic sequences is a prerequisite to fully understand and exploit the metabolic potential of industrially relevant organisms. Modern fast DNA-sequencing methods as

well as state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools are nowadays
available for the reconstruction and cross-comparison of
these networks among related species as well as among specific strains in order to elucidate their metabolic peculiarities.

Conclusion: The genome-level reconstruction of the metabolic network and genome-based
metabolic comparison disclose peculiarities of A. niger highly relevant to its biotechnological
applications and should contribute to future rational metabolic design and systems biology studies
of this black mold and related species.

refereed research

Results: Here, we present the first genome-scale metabolic network for A. niger and an in-depth
genomic comparison of this species to seven other fungi to disclose its metabolic peculiarities. The
raw genomic sequences of A. niger ATCC 9029 were first annotated. The reconstructed metabolic
network is based on the annotation of two A. niger genomes, CBS 513.88 and ATCC 9029, including
enzymes with 988 unique EC numbers, 2,443 reactions and 2,349 metabolites. More than 1,100
enzyme-coding genes are unique to A. niger in comparison to the other seven fungi. For example,
we identified additional copies of genes such as those encoding alternative mitochondrial
oxidoreductase and citrate synthase in A. niger, which might contribute to the high citric acid
production efficiency of this species. Moreover, nine genes were identified as encoding enzymes
with EC numbers exclusively found in A. niger, mostly involved in the biosynthesis of complex
secondary metabolites and degradation of aromatic compounds.

deposited research

Background: Aspergillus niger is an important industrial microorganism for the production of both
metabolites, such as citric acid, and proteins, such as fungal enzymes or heterologous proteins.
Despite its extensive industrial applications, the genetic inventory of this fungus is only partially
understood. The recently released genome sequence opens a new horizon for both scientific
studies and biotechnological applications.

Sun et al.

Among the filamentous genus Aspergillus, A. niger, A.
awamori (a subspecies of A. niger) and A. oryzae are the
industrially important producers of both metabolites and
enzymes [1]. For example, citric acid is nowadays almost
exclusively produced using A. niger, although this "wellworking black box" is not yet fully understood [2]. In addition, A. niger has also revealed some potential in bioremediation [3-6] and, moreover, it is a well-known producer of
extracellular fungal enzymes. For example, glucoamylase in
20 grams per liter quantities have been reported [7]. Based on
these secretion capacities, many efforts have also been undertaken to develop A. niger as a producer of heterologous proteins such as biopharmaceuticals [8,9], most often with
limited success. Thus, there is a great need for a better knowledge of the genomic potential of A. niger, which could be used
for rational strain improvement.
By now, the full genomes of A. nidulans [10], A. oryzae [11],
and the human pathogen A. fumigatus [12] have been determined. Compared to A. nidulans, which has been widely used
as the model organism for studies on fungal physiology and
genetics, very little is known about the genetic background of
A. niger. Only recently, the annotated genomic sequence of A.
niger became publicly available [13], now allowing a more indepth analysis of the metabolic potential of this important
black fungus as well as the application of modern 'omics' technologies to further improve its performance.
A small-scale metabolic network can be reconstructed based
on experimental evidence derived from the literature. However, reconstruction of a more complete, or so-called genomescale, metabolic network relies on having the genome
sequence and high-quality genome annotation [14,15].
Briefly, a list of enzymes, especially Enzyme Commission
(EC) numbers, is extracted from the genome annotation and
searched in an established biochemical reaction database to
acquire their corresponding reactions. The biochemical reactions are then connected to each other according to certain
rules [15]. Such information can be further interpreted as a
network and analyzed by many computer programs, such as
Cytoscape [16].
The model of A. niger central metabolism was reported previously [13,17]. In this study, we reconstructed a genomescale metabolic network from the annotated genome of A.
niger CBS 513.88 [13]. Moreover, from raw genomic data
(three-fold coverage) of A. niger ATCC 9029 (Integrated
Genomics, Chicago, IL, USA), protein coding sequences
(CDSs) were identified, annotated and used for a more complete metabolic network reconstruction. The high-resolution
A. niger metabolic network was cross-compared between the
two A. niger strains as well as to other Aspergillus species (A.
nidulans, A. oryzae, A. fumigatus, A. flavus) and other filamentous fungi, such as Fusarium graminearum and Neurospora crassa, and to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
for identification of unique genes and metabolic peculiarities.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R182

Finally, selected genes from the citric acid production pathway of A. niger CBS 513.88 and A. niger ATCC 9029 were
cross-compared to the respective genes of A. niger [18]ATCC
1015, whose genome was recently released by the Joint
Genomics Institute ahead of annotation .

Results and discussion
Genomic annotation of the low-coverage genome of A.
niger ATCC 9029
The unannotated raw genome sequence of A. niger ATCC
9029 from Integrated Genomics was annotated by using an
improved version of the program 'IdentiCS' (see Materials
and methods and Additional data file 1) with a cutoff E-value
of 1E-5. The combination of results from the algorithms IdentiCS, GeneWise [19] and GenScan [20] resulted in a protein
database of A. niger with approximately 16,000 entries. Of
these, 75% are located on the ends of contigs, obviously
because of the small size of the contigs due to a low genomic
coverage of the sequence and the larger size of genes due to
the presence of introns. Nearly 4,000 coding sequences
(CDSs) were merged into about 2,000 entries using homologous protein sequences from the NCBI database as hints by a
method described previously [21]. The final A. niger protein
database contains 14,023 entries. By applying the strategies
described in the Materials and methods section, the annotation was improved to address the functionality of the coding
sequences in terms of Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG orthology
(KO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), EC numbers,
pathways, and so on. Two-thirds of the identified CDSs were
assigned to at least one functional category (Figure 1); 8,066

refereed research

In summary, the results from comparative genomics show
that the A. niger strains are closely related to each other but
exhibit large differences from the other fungal species compared. In the following paragraphs we address the impact of
these differences on the metabolic peculiarities of A. niger.

deposited research

In some cases the unique CDSs are just duplicates: their
homologs can be found in both CBS 513.88 and ATCC 9029
(refer to Additional data file 3). For example, in addition to
the unique gene An16g00110, CBS 513.88 has three further
copies of genes coding for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase,
An14g04410, An05g02040 and An02g07470, which are
orthologous to the three copies of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase in ATCC 9029, Anig06338, Anig11911 and
Anig08668, respectively.

reports

The strain-specific genes in the two A. niger strains are listed
in Additional data file 3. Among the genes unique to A. niger

CBS 513.88, some encode enzymes for primary metabolism
(such as alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) (An10g00010),
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (An16g00110), NADH
dehydrogenase (An06g00130)), some for secondary metabolism (such as cephalosporin acylase, An16g00140), and some
for transcription factors/regulators. A large gene cluster
spans over 90 genes (from An08g11200 to An08g12140), of
which 52 are unique to A. niger CBS 513.88 and most have
unknown functions. Seven transposable elements are located
in or next to this cluster, giving hints to its potential evolutionary origin by horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, 25 of
the CDSs unique to A. niger ATCC 9029, including glucokinase (Anig00906), UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanine-D-glutamate ligase (Anig04708), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-Nacetylmuramyl-(Pentapeptide) pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase (Anig04709) and five
proteins involved in transport, have strong similarity (7095% identical) to bacterial or bacteriophage proteins, indicating a possible bacterial origin of these proteins. The majority
of the remaining genes unique to ATCC 9029 do not show any
significant homology to the NCBI protein database.

reviews

To understand the unique genetic makeup of A. niger that
accounts for its high capacity in various industrial processes,
the annotated CDSs of A. niger ATCC 9029 from this study
and CBS 513.88 from the Dutch company DSM [13] were
cross-compared with seven selected fungi for which genome
data are available. Based on the 15,720 ortholog groups established by the program OrthoMCL [22] (see Additional data
file 2 for a complete list of the orthologs in the compared
organisms), we show the pairwise comparison of the proteomes in Table 1. If the ortholog of a gene from one organism
is absent in another organism, we define that this gene is
unique or specific to the first organism in comparison to the
second one (see Materials and methods for details). There
exist remarkable differences among the fungi compared, even
in the genus Aspergillus. Up to 88% of the CDSs can be
unique to a fungus in comparison to another fungal species.
Nearly 50% of the CDSs of A. niger CBS 513.88 cannot be
found in other Aspergillus species (refer to Materials and
methods for the definition of uniqueness). The CDSs are well
conserved in the two A. niger strains. Over 30% of the CDSs
in each A. niger strain have homologs in another A. niger
strain with an identity level higher than 99%. The strain
ATCC 9029 and the strain CBS 513.88 have 639 and 575
unique CDSs (Additional data file 3), respectively, in comparison with each other. The unique genes account for around
4% of the total number of CDSs in the two A. niger strains.
Similar results were also achieved with the preliminary gene
prediction of A. niger ATCC 1015 from the Joint Genomics
Institute (the data are not shown because of the data release
policy of the Joint Genomics Institute).

Reconstruction and comparative analysis of the
metabolic network
Metabolic network reconstruction
For the reconstruction of the metabolic network, only CDSs
having standardized EC numbers were considered. From the
functional annotation discussed above, 999 unique EC numbers (935 of them are complete) were identified in 4,006
CDSs. Similar EC numbers were also identified from the
genome of A. niger CBS 513.88. The metabolic network of A.
niger was constructed using the EC numbers of these two
strains. Both the knowledge-based [23] and the connectionmatrix-based methods [15] were applied, as stated in Materials and methods. Figure 2 shows the genome-wide metabolic
network, in which nodes represent metabolites and links represent the reactions. A reaction map of the metabolic network, in which the nodes represent reactions and links the
common metabolites of two successive reactions, is included
in Additional data file 4. Their corresponding clickable versions in html format can be found in Additional data files 5
and 6.
The metabolic network established contains 2,443 biological
reactions (31 of them are non-enzymatic reactions; refer to
Additional data file 7 for a complete list of reactions and corresponding CDSs) and 2,349 metabolites, significantly higher
than the number of reactions and metabolites known for this
organism until now. Most of the reactions are connected to
central metabolism, such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R182

acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and
so on (Table 2). Interestingly, a significant number of
reactions and metabolites belong to secondary metabolism or
xenobiotics biodegradation, indicating the high metabolic
potential of A. niger for production of secondary metabolites
or for bioremediation, which is consistent with the experimental findings in the literature [3-6,24]. Moreover, around
20% of all the identified reactions or metabolites are still not
associated with any metabolic category. Many of them belong
to isolated parts of the overall metabolic network (Figure 2).
The missing links could be either due to our limited knowledge on the reference metabolic reactions and enzymes or
because of insufficient or wrong genomic annotation. Identification of the missing links should be an important focus in
further functional genomic studies to enable us to fully
exploit the metabolic capacity of A. niger.

A comparative assessment of the central metabolic network
The metabolic network reconstructed from the genomic data
was compared to the network of central carbon metabolism of
A. niger reconstructed by David et al. [17]. The network of
David et al. was mainly based on literature data of A. niger
and the genomic information of A. nidulans and other fungi.
It contains 335 reactions, 284 metabolites and 129 EC numbers. In general, there is a good agreement between these two
metabolic networks regarding central metabolism. Only 14
ECs in the metabolic network of David et al. could not be

information

In view of the importance of citric acid production by A.
niger, the metabolic reactions contributing to citric acid production are selected as an example to explore the capability of
the constructed metabolic network. Although citric acid production has been studied extensively in the past, there are still
many questions that need to be answered to fully understand
the citric acid formation process [2]. The pathways related to
citric acid production from glucose were extracted from the
genome-wide metabolic network together with the metabolites directly connected to these pathways (Figure 3; refer to
Additional data file 12 for details). The extensive connections
of the 25 intermediates of glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle from/to the 146 metabolites of other pathways demonstrate the complexity and large interactions of the central
metabolism. Eighteen substrates, such as starch, sucrose,
dextrin, maltose, lactose, cellulose, α,α-trehalose, sorbitol, Dglucoside, N-glycan, and so on, require only a one-step reaction to enter this pathway via glucose. In comparison to other

interactions

It should be noted that in most cases, the unique enzyme-coding genes mentioned above do have paralogs in other fungi or
even in A. niger itself (refer to Materials and methods for the
definition of uniqueness). These paralogs were carefully verified not to be orthologs since they are orthologous to other
CDSs of A. niger. Gene redundancy or duplication has also
been reported in A. niger previously [13,28], and is commonly found in eukaryotes [26,29,30]. Due to slackened
selective constraints, the duplicated genes have greater
potential for mutation to undergo slight changes in function,

refereed research

Based on the established ortholog relationship and in comparison to seven other fungi, 42 enzyme-coding ortholog
groups are unique to one of the two A. niger strains (Additional data file 9), while 1,100 enzyme-coding orthologs were
found to be common in the two A. niger strains and unique to
them (Additional data file 10). Most of these common and
unique genes have EC numbers that are also found in other
fungi (for example, refer to Figure 3, red links). Additional or
different copies of genes can strengthen certain pathways or
enhance the robustness of the regulation to adapt to different
environments [25,26]. Surprisingly, merely nine ortholog
groups have EC numbers that were not found in the other
fungi compared (Table 3), including two enzymes involved in
secondary metabolism and three (EC 1.13.11.3, EC 4.1.1.55
and EC 1.3.1.11) associated with degradation of aromatic compounds. This is consistent with the fact that A. niger can be
used for bioremediation to degrade aromatic compounds
[27].

deposited research

Unique enzyme-coding genes and unique EC numbers

such as different substrate or ligand specificity, to achieve different temporal or spatial distribution, to be differently regulated, or even to gain completely new functions [26]. It is
interesting to ask what are the biological functions of these
unique but paralogous enzymes in A. niger. As can be seen in
Table 3, only two enzymes of A. niger have no homolog in the
other fungi, namely 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase
(EC 4.1.1.55), involved in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation,
and S-adenosylmethionine tRNA ribosyltransferase (EC
5.4.99.-), involved in tRNA modification. The finding concerning S-adenosylmethionine tRNA ribosyltransferase is
somewhat surprising, because this enzyme is exclusively
present in eubacteria for de novo biosynthesis of queuosine,
which is an essential nutrient for many eucaryotes [31,32]
(see Additional data file 11 for a detailed analysis).

filamentous fungi, A. niger has redundant unique genes for
the conversion of seven of these substrates (reactions marked
as red in Figure 3). Degradation products from many pathways, including xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism, enter
this citrate biosynthesis sub-network via pyruvate or acetylCoA for further processing. Acetyl-CoA and pyruvate belong
to the metabolites having the highest connectivity (involved
in 65 and 57 reactions, respectively) in the metabolic network
of A. niger. They are directly used for biosynthesis of amino
acids, lipids, vitamins, and so on. 2-Oxoglutarate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate from this sub-network are two other
metabolites involved in many pathways for biosynthesis (lipids and amino acids, respectively). Anaplerotic pathways of
the TCA cycle were identified from the metabolic map,
including reactions from the glyoxylate cycle, from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, or from pyruvate to oxaloacetate
or malate. The versatile conversion center TCA cycle can
potentially offer a sufficient amount of oxaloacetate for the
formation of oxalic acid, often an unwanted acidic by-product
in A. niger cultivations.

Additional copies of genes encoding alternative mitochondrial
oxidoreductase and citrate synthase in the citric acid production
strain
Thirty percent of all the reactions (marked red in Figure 3)
can be potentially catalyzed by enzymes encoded by additional or different CDSs that are unique to the A. niger strains
in comparison to other filamentous fungi. Two examples are
given here. The first one is the cyanide-insensitive and
salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive mitochondrial alternative
oxidoreductase (AOX, EC 1.9.3.-,), which may have a critical
role in the citric acid production process due to the necessity
to rapidly recycle NADH independent of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis [2,33-35]. Inhibition of AOX by
adding salicylhydroxamic acid into the media greatly reduces
citric acid production [34,35]. Previously, only a copy of AOX
(gi|6226552|AOX_ASPNG from SwissProt, 99% identical to
An11g04810) was experimentally identified in A. niger by
using cDNA cloning and genomic Southern blot hybridization
[33,34]. Interestingly, we have now identified an additional
mitochondrial AOX, 67% identical to the first one, from the
genomes of the three A. niger strains (Table 4, ortholog index

number 10903), which is unique to A. niger in terms of
orthology. Phylogenetic analysis of AOX homologs revealed
that these two copies fall into two neighbored clades (clades 1
and 2 in Figure 4) belonging to Pezizomycotina. Clade 1
includes the known copy of AOX in A. niger and the AOX
from Penicillium chrysogenum, Ajellomyces capsulatus,
Coccidioides immitis, Neosartorya fischeri and all sequenced
Aspergilli, while clade 2 includes the second copy of AOX
found in A. niger, A. oryzae and A. terreus. Multiple copies of
AOX were also found in some fungi, such as Neurospora
crassa, Chaetomium globosum, Candida maltosa, Candida
albicans, and Yarrowia lipolytica (Figure 4), and in many
plants [36]. The different copies of AOX in plants are
expressed in different environmental or developmental conditions
[36].
In
A.
niger,
the
AOX
(gi|6226552|AOX_ASPNG) identified previously seems to be
constitutively expressed regardless of the glucose concentration at 10-120 g/l in the cultivation media [37]. The participation of the newly identified AOX as an important enzyme in
the citric acid formation process would need further experimental verification.
The second example is the citrate synthase (Table 4) catalyzing the biosynthesis of citric acid from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Table 4 shows the relevant orthologs across the
selected fungi. The A. niger strains share five isoenzymes of
citrate synthase, including methylcitrate synthase, which also
shows citrate synthase activity [38], whereas A. oryzae has
only four, and A. fumigatus and A. nidulans have only three
copies. The genetic multiplicity of citrate synthase was also
reported in A. niger [13]. Here, we identified that the ortholog
group 12065 is unique to all three A. niger strains. Interestingly, A. niger ATCC 1015, the strain used in the first patented
citric acid process, has an additional unique citrate synthase
gene, jgi|Aspni1|46236 (Table 4). Its ortholog was not found
in A. niger CBS 513.88 or A. niger ATCC 9029. The sequence

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R182

of this protein is identical to gb|EAV74068.1, citrate synthase
I of Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 (β-proteobacteria). This partial gene is found on a small contig, scaffold_1409, whose
nucleotide sequence is also identical to the genomic sequence
of Delftia acidovorans SPH-1. The presence of this additional
and bacteria-originated citrate synthase in A. niger ATCC
1015 needs to be carefully verified by genome sequencing or
PCR to rule out the possibility of sequence contamination.
Furthermore, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of 1,134
homolog sequences (homologous to any of the six groups of
citrate synthase in A. niger at E-value 1E-20) from the NCBI
nr protein database showed that the sequences of the first two
ortholog groups (361 and 2397) in Table 4 are clearly clustered with the sequences mainly from eukaryotes while those
of the last four ortholog groups are clustered with prokaryotic
sequences (Additional data file 13), suggesting different
origins of citrate synthase in A. niger. Since the members of
the A. niger unique ortholog group 12065 is tightly clustered
with the other two ortholog groups, these genes probably
originated after speciation by gene duplication events. As
revealed by the analysis above, gene duplication or redundancy seems to be a general strategy evolved in this black
mould. These newly found extra copies of genes in A. niger
strains, most remarkably the second AOX and the additional
citrate synthases, may contribute to the high citrate production efficiency of A. niger.

Conclusion

14,000 protein coding sequences were predicted from the raw
low-coverage genome sequence of A. niger ATCC 9029 and
approximately 60% of them were assigned to at least one
functional category (GO, KO, COG, EC and pathways). This
enabled a comparative genomic analysis of two different A.
niger strains. It is found that the genomic content of A. niger
ATCC 9029 is very similar to that of A. niger CBS 513.88;

information

Proteins predicted from the unfinished genomic sequences of
A. niger ATCC 9029 and the proteins from A. niger CBS
513.88 were cross-compared with the proteins of seven
selected fungal species and another 26 representative eukaryotic organisms to identify their orthologous relationships.
The seven selected fungi included A. oryzae (used in Asian
food fermentation), A. fumigatus (a human pathogen), A.
nidulans (a model organism for genetic studies), F. graminearum (a plant pathogen but also used in food production),
Magnaporthe grisea (a plant pathogen), N. crassa (a model
organism) and S. cerevisiae (used in baking and brewing but
also a model organism). The protein ortholog relationship
among A. niger and the selected fungi was detected by the
program OrthoMCL [22] with relatively strict parameters,
such as p value cutoff 1E-20, identity cutoff 40%, percentageof-match cutoff 50% and inflation factor 5. OrthoMCL detects
the many-to-many ortholog groups including recent paralogs
based on all-against-all sequence alignment. This algorithm
is suitable to work with more genomes. Blast [45] and PatternHunter [46] were used for sequence alignment.

interactions

To predict the CDSs and to reconstruct the metabolic network
of organisms with unannotated, low coverage genome
sequences, we recently developed a new algorithm called
'IdentiCS' [23]. This homology-based algorithm was demonstrated to be able to cope with sequences of low genome coverage and, thus, potentially high error rates. It was
successfully used to predict CDSs and to infer the metabolic
networks of several bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium [23], Escherichia coli 1917
[39] and Bacillus megaterium [21]. In this study, this algorithm was extended for the prediction and annotation of
eukaryotic CDSs by considering the intron and extron structure of genes (see Additional data file 1).

We combined several strategies to refine the annotation.
First, all CDSs predicted were submitted to the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server [40] which applies a best-best algorithm to associate the submitted sequence to known KO
number, COG, EC number, GO number and biochemical
reactions. Second, we used HT-GO-FAT (High Throughput
Gene Ontology Functional Annotation Toolkit) [41], another
useful software toolkit that utilizes a custom-curated BLAST
database to annotate sequences to GO, EC number, KEGG
pathways and so on. EC numbers can be deduced from the
associated GO numbers by this program. Third, text mining
was used to assign EC number when an obvious enzyme could
not be associated to an EC number or a complete EC number
through the above-mentioned methods. For this purpose, the
name of the enzyme was queried in the KEGG Ligand database [42,43] for synonyms or searched via a general search
engine such as Google [44]. The hits were manually
evaluated.

The genome (approximately 32 Mb, haploid 8 chromosomes)
sequence of A. niger ATCC 9029 was obtained from Integrated Genomics Inc (Chicago, IL, USA), which has a genome
coverage of about three-fold and was generated by using a
whole-genome shotgun strategy without finishing. The
assembled genomic sequence contains 9,510 contigs corresponding to 33.7 Mb. The average length of the contigs is 3.5
kb. The largest contig is 34.9 kb. The genome of A. niger CBS
513.88 and its annotation were kindly provided by the company DSM ahead of publication [13]. The genome of A. niger
ATCC 1015 and its gene prediction were downloaded from the
Joint Genome Institute under its data release agreement [18].
Genome sequences of other fungal strains were downloaded
from KEGG and NCBI.

GeneWise, another useful software applying a homologybased approach to predict gene structure [19], was used to
refine and confirm the prediction of 'IdentiCS' as described
above. Like all other homology-based methods, 'IdentiCS' is
unable to predict new genes for which no homologue is
present in the available protein database. Thus, a homologyindependent program called GenScan was used. GenScan is a
general-purpose gene identification program that determines
the most likely 'parse' (gene structure) by using a probabilistic
model of the gene structural and compositional properties of
the genomic DNA for the given organism [20].

merely around 600 genes are exclusively found in each strain.
A further comparative genomic analysis among six Aspergilli
and other selected eucaryotes revealed more than 4,000
CDSs unique to A. niger. Based on the functional annotation
of the two A. niger strains, we reconstructed the metabolic
network of A. niger and systematically compared it with those
of seven other fungi. Comparative metabolic genomics
revealed the high metabolic peculiarity of A. niger by more
than 1,100 unique enzyme-encoding genes. Many of these
unique genes are additional copies (paralogs) of those genes
that are common (orthologs) in the compared fungi, indicating that genetic multiplicity might be a key strategy of A.
niger to keep its versatile metabolic capacities and its robustness to adapt to different environmental conditions. Only
nine genes were identified to encode enzymes with EC numbers exclusively found in A. niger, mostly involved in the biosynthesis of complex secondary metabolites and degradation
of aromatic compounds. Moreover, we identified additional
copies of genes, such as the ones encoding alternative
mitochondrial oxidoreductase and citrate synthases, which
could have an impact on the overproduction of citric acid by
this black mould.

In this work, if not specified, the uniqueness of a gene or CDS
from organism A is defined according to the orthologous relationship table established above. If the ortholog of a gene
from organism A is absent in organism B, we define that this
gene is unique or specific to organism A in comparison to
organism B. This does not imply there is no homolog (namely
paralog) of the gene from organism A in organism B. In some
cases, this gene is just an additional copy of another gene
whose orthologs are found in both organisms. This also does
not imply that this gene is found only in organism A. For
example, the ortholog of this gene may be found in organism
C from the relationship table or another strain or species that
is not compared in this work.

Two methods were used to reconstruct and visualize the metabolic network based on the annotation of CDSs. One method
was based on mapping the annotation information to knowledge bases such as the KEGG pathways through 'IdentiCS'
[23]. The metabolic pathways and network reconstructed this
way are intuitive with respect to our knowledge on biochemical pathways. They can be used for a straightforward comparison with the network of other sequenced organisms [23]. The
metabolic network was also constructed based on the connection matrix of reactions according to Ma and Zeng [15].
Thirty-one non-enzymatic reactions were also considered in
the latter approach. The connection matrix of reactions published by Ma and Zeng [15] was substantially improved in this
work by: updating the enzyme reaction database to the newer
version of KEGG Ligand (Status Nov. 2005) [42]; integrating
the information of reversibility from KEGG pathway maps
(Status Nov. 2005) [47] and confirming it with the BRENDA
enzymatic database [48]; and considering the complete set of
reactions available in the Ligand database. In the end, the
new version contains 6,442 reactions instead of the 3,805 in
the former version. In addition, half of the reactions from the
former version were updated in term of reversibility and connection pairs (Additional data file 14; also, check the authors'
website [49] for an updated version). The software Cytoscape
[16,50] and yEd (a Java Graph Editor from the company
yWorks) [51] were used as layout tools for the genome-wide
network. The phylogenetic tree was built by using the software ClustalW (version 1.83 for Windows) [52].

reviews

Comparative genomics revealed a huge number of speciesspecific genes, even when two closely related sub-species
were compared to each other. We found 3,976 CDSs unique to
A. niger ATCC 9029 compared to A. niger CBS 513.88, and
4,306 unique to A. niger CBS 513.88 compared vice versa.
We argue that this number is too high to be true because the
sequence alignment of the two subspecies usually showed
very high identity (close to 100%), indicating that the speciation is really a recent evolutionary event and a huge difference
in genomic content is thus impossible. Failure of gene prediction in the genome annotation process can cause failure in
ortholog detection. To avoid this problem, the protein
sequence of each A. niger strain was compared against the
genomic sequences of the other A. niger strain by applying
strict criteria (aligned region >80% and identity >80% or
log10(e2) < 0.8*log10(e1), where e2 is the E-value of the
query protein against the genome while e1 is the E-value of
the query protein against itself) in addition to the criteria
mentioned above. This procedure ensures the detection of
near-identical genes (ortholog or inparalog [22]) even in
cases where they were not predicted as genes in one of the
compared strains by the initial genome annotation process.
The results were surprising: many nearly identical genomic
regions were predicted as genes in A. niger ATCC 9029 but
not in A. niger CBS 513.88, or vice versa, strongly demonstrating the necessity for improvement of current gene finding strategies, for instance, by integrating results from
comparative genomics study. By this procedure, the number
of genes truly specific to one of the A. niger strains is greatly
reduced (see Table 1 for the results). This procedure was not
applied for the cross-comparison of A. niger with the other
fungi due to lack of an operational criterion.
