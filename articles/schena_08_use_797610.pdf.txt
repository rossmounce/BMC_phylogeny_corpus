Abstract
Background: Microsatellites or single sequence repeats (SSRs) are a powerful choice of marker
in the study of Phytophthora population biology, epidemiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. A
strategy was tested in which the publicly available unigene datasets extracted from genome
sequences of P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum were mined for candidate SSR markers that could
be applied to a wide range of Phytophthora species.
Results: A first approach, aimed at the identification of polymorphic SSR loci common to many
Phytophthora species, yielded 171 reliable sequences containing 211 SSRs. Microsatellites were
identified from 16 target species representing the breadth of diversity across the genus. Repeat
number ranged from 3 to 16 with most having seven repeats or less and four being the most
commonly found. Trinucleotide repeats such as (AAG)n, (AGG)n and (AGC)n were the most
common followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. A second
approach was aimed at the identification of useful loci common to a restricted number of species
more closely related to P. sojae (P. alni, P. cambivora, P. europaea and P. fragariae). This analysis
yielded 10 trinucleotide and 2 tetranucleotide SSRs which were repeated 4, 5 or 6 times.
Conclusion: Key studies on inter- and intra-specific variation of selected microsatellites remain.
Despite the screening of conserved gene coding regions, the sequence diversity between species
was high and the identification of useful SSR loci applicable to anything other than the most closely
related pairs of Phytophthora species was challenging. That said, many novel SSR loci for species
other than the three 'source species' (P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum) are reported, offering
great potential for the investigation of Phytophthora populations. In addition to the presence of
microsatellites, many of the amplified regions may represent useful molecular marker regions for
other studies as they are highly variable and easily amplifiable from different Phytophthora species.

Background
The genus Phytophthora, with other Oomycetes, fall within
the kingdom Stramenopila, which also includes goldenbrown algae, diatoms, and brown algae such as kelp [1-4].
This genus stands out among the plant pathogens since a

significant number of the 80 or so described species continue to prove a threat to ecosystem stability and plant
productivity on a global scale [5-8]. Despite the importance of Phytophthora species, studies of their molecular
diversity have been limited by the power of the genetic

markers and difficulties in comparing results among laboratories. Accurate studies based on the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have resulted in a consensus
of the phylogenetic relationships within the genus with a
grouping into 10 genetically related clades now accepted
[2,3,9]. However, these studies were based on genes commonly conserved within a species and therefore unsuitable to characterize intraspecific variability. Other
approaches to study intraspecific variability among Phytophthora species including RAPD-PCR and AFLP have
proved valuable within a particular study but comparing
results from one laboratory to another has always proved
challenging with such fingerprinting tools [10-13].
Although microsatellites or simple sequence repeats
(SSRs) have been recognised as one of the most powerful
choices of markers for molecular ecology they have only
relatively recently been exploited in the study of Phytophthora populations. SSRs are tandemly repeated motifs of
one to six bases which occur frequently and randomly in
all eukaryotic genomes although their frequency varies
significantly among different organisms [14]. They exhibit
a high degree of length polymorphism among related
organisms due to stepwise mutations affecting the
number of repeat units and leading to polymorphism
[14,15]. Dinucleotide repeats account for the majority of
microsatellites for many species whereas trinucleotide
and hexanucleotide repeats are the most likely repeat
classes to appear in coding regions because they do not
cause a frameshift [16,17]. Major advantages SSRs
include: (i) multiple SSR alleles may be detected at a single locus using a simple PCR-based screen, (ii) SSRs are
evenly distributed across the genome, (iii) they are codominant, (iv) very small quantities of DNA are required
for screening, (v) analysis may be semi-automated, and
(vi) results are objective compared to random amplification methods [18].
Microsatellites have been used to investigate genetic structure and reproductive biology of Oomycetes species
including Plasmopara viticola, P. cinnamomi, P. infestans,
and P. ramorum [19-21,23-25]. However, a major limitation to their wider exploitation is the need for prior species-specific marker isolation that requires knowledge of
the DNA sequence of the SSR flanking regions to which
specific primers have to be designed. Such regions are usually conserved within a species but the likelihood of primers successfully working between species decreases with
increasing genetic distance and, in practice, primers are
usually developed anew for each species [25,26]. Common methods for the discovery of SSR loci are based on
constructing genomic DNA libraries enriched for SSR
sequences. These methods were utilised for P. cinnamomi
and P. ramorum, however they are time-consuming, and
the specific sequencing of DNA libraries required is expensive [20,25]. Many commercial and academic laboratories

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/620

specialise in microsatellite isolation services and can provide a set of polymorphic microsatellite loci for a new species in 3–6 months for a cost of approximately USD 1,500
per locus, or USD 10,000 for 10–15 loci [14].
The availability of entire genome sequences for an increasing number of species including P. infestans http://
www.broad.mit.edu/, P. ramorum and P. sojae http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/ have proved novel opportunities to
identify and evaluate potential SSR markers identified by
computational tools (Abajian, 1994, http://espressosoft
ware.com/pages/sputnik.jsp) [27,28]. This approach has
been utilised to identify SSRs for the study of European
and USA populations of P. ramorum and for monitoring
the genetic variation in populations of P. infestans across
Europe and worldwide [23,24,29,30].
Recently, Garnica et al. used an in silico approach to survey
and compare simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in transcript
sequences from the genomes of P. sojae, P. ramorum and P.
infestans [27]. They also evaluated in silico transferability
of SSRs among the Phytophthora species and found that a
proportion (7.5%) of primers could, in theory, be transferred between at least two of the three species. In the
present study SSRs from P. infestans P. sojae and P. ramorum were analysed to identify useful loci common to
many Phytophthora species (Approach 1) or to a restricted
number of species closely related to P. sojae (Approach 2).
Selected loci were amplified and sequenced from 16
(Approach 1) and 5 (Approach 2) different Phytophthora
species and a comprehensive SSRs dataset was created.

Results
Approach 1 – SSRs for many Phytophthora species
The aim of this approach was to identify loci containing
SSRs common to a large number of Phytophthora species
(Fig. 1A). The method was validated using 16 different
species (Table 1) representing the breadth of diversity
across the genus [2,3].
Analysis of sequences from P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum
genome projects and scanning for homologous SSRs
Predicted gene datasets from P. infestans http://
www.broad.mit.edu/P. sojae and P. ramorum http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/ were scanned for the presence of microsatellites defined as short tandem repeat motifs (SSRs)
of 2–6 bp. Both perfect and compound SSRs were selected
with a minimal acceptable length of 10 bp (dinucelotide
motifs) and 12 bp (tri- and tetranucletide motifs). SSRs
with a minimum of three repeats were included in the
analyses of penta-nucleotide repeats. This search yielded
9333 sequences containing SSRs (1465 from P. infestans,
5348 from P. sojae and 2520 from P. ramorum). The relative abundance of SSRs was 103, 183 and 114 per Mb of

ramorum, 94.4% P. sojae), with a repeat number of four
being the most common in all species.

Selected regions were compared by BLAST analysis to
identify homologous regions flanking SSRs in at least two
of the three species (P. sojae, P. ramorum and P. infestans).
This analysis identified 4135 SSRs from P. infestans (688),
P. ramorum (1470), and P. sojae (1977). A very limited
number of loci containing SSRs were common to the three
species; most loci were common to P. ramorum and P.
sojae (81.6%), P. infestans and P. ramorum (7%) or P.
infestans and P. sojae (11%). In most of the cases, homologous loci contained the same SSR motif in different Phytophthoras, however the number of repeats was
consistently higher in the 'source' species than the other
two.

Selection and amplification of target regions containing SSRs
The 4135 homologous regions previously identified were
manually analysed to select those with the highest
number of repeats and flanked by the most conserved
sequences on both sides. The latter condition was necessary to design primers suitable for as many species as possible. Based on this analysis 6, 7 and 12 target regions
were identified across the genome of P. infestans, P. ramorum and P. sojae respectively. These regions, containing 8,
17 and 33 SSRs respectively, were selected (Table 2) for
amplification from 16 different species of Phytophthora
representing the breadth of diversity in the genus (Table
1). To this aim, a total number of 62 different degenerate
primers (12 for P. infestans, 18 for P. ramorum, and 32 for
P. sojae) were designed (Table 2). When target regions
contained two or more SSRs and/or were too long to be
amplified by a single amplification, a pool of different
primers was designed (Table 2). Considerable effort was

Among the selected loci, the number of SSR repeats
ranged from 3 to 13, from 3 to 12 and from 3 to 17 in P.
infestans, P. ramorum and P. sojae respectively. Most SSRs
showed seven repeats or less (98.2% P. infestans, 97.4% P.

The resultant primers enabled the amplification of 271
single PCR bands of the expected size (Fig. 2). In the
remaining primer-species combinations, 193 amplifications did not produce any product or produced complex
profiles (two or more PCR fragments) impeding direct
sequencing (Fig. 2). Some primer combinations failed to
amplify a product from any of the Phytophthora species
whereas other combinations amplified single bands from
all or most Phytophthora species (Tables 3, 4, 5).
Sequencing of single PCR bands and scanning for SSRs
All single PCR bands (271) were purified to remove excess
primers and nucleotides and sequenced in both directions
using the same primers used for the amplification. When
forward and/or reverse sequences were not identical,
amplification, purification and sequencing were repeated
twice and all unreliable sequences were discarded. Finally,
171 sequences were obtained with primers designed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/620

against P. sojae (70), P. ramorum (50) and P. infestans (51)
genomes (Fig. 2) and scanned to identify SSRs by means
of sputnik. Sequenced regions contained a total number
of 211 SSRs distributed across the genome of the 16 target
species with those of clade 7 (P. alni, P. cambivora, P. europaea, P. fragariae and P. sojae) and clade 8 (P. lateralis and
P. ramorum) more highly represented (Fig. 3; Tables 3, 4,
5). A single microsatellite was identified in P. inundata. All
SSRs identified in P. infestans were amplified with primers
designed against its own genome (Fig. 3). Identified SSRs
ranged in the number of repeats from 4 to 16, from 3 to
16 and from 4 to 14 in P. sojae, P. ramorum and P. infestans
respectively (Tables 3, 4, 5). A single repeat of 24 was
found in an SCRI isolate of P. ramorum (Table 4). Most
SSRs were of seven repeats or less (88.9% P. infestans,
82.8% P. ramorum, 76.8 P. sojae), with a repeat number of
four being the most common in all species (Fig. 4). Overall, the most common motifs were (AAG)n, (AGG)n and
(AGC)n representing 40.9%, 23.3% and 17.6% respectively of the total number of identified SSRs (Fig. 5). Trinucleotide repeats were the most common (94.7%)
followed by pentanucleotide (2.4%), tetranucleotide
(1.9%) and dinucleotide (1.0%) repeats.
To evaluate intraspecific variability a few selected target
regions amplified by primers S23F-S25R, S21F-S22R, I9I10 and I5-6 (Table 2) were examined and sequenced
from additional isolates of P. alni, P. cambivora, P. cinnamomi, P. pseudosyringae and P. ilicis (Table 1). The analysed
target regions did not show intraspecific variability among
analysed isolates of P. alni subsp. alni, P. pseudosyringae or
P. ilicis, whereas P. cambivora and P. cinnamomi isolates
were polymorphic in all the tested primer combinations.
As an example, the target region amplified with primers
I9-I10 from P. cinnamomi was characterised by 12, 14 and
18 repeated motifs (AGG) in three tested isolates (Table
6).

Approach 2 – Identification of SSRs in Phytophthora spp.
clade 7
The aim of this approach was to focus the search for SSR
loci to a restricted range of four clade 7 Phytophthora species (P. alni, P. cambivora, P. europaea and P. fragariae) phylogenetically related to P. sojae (Fig 1B) [9].
Identification of target regions
This approach was based on a detailed list of SSRs identified in the genome of P. sojae and provided by Dr. Niklaus
Grunwald at the Agricultural Research Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Corvallis, Oregon. Among the
list, sixty genomic regions (500–1000 bp) were manually
selected on the basis of having the longest SSRs in exons
(20), introns (20) and non coding regions (20). The
selected regions (Table 7) were screened using BLAST
against the entire genomes of P. ramorum and P. infestans

to search for homology irrespective of the SSR regions.
None of these regions aligned with sequences from the P.
infestans genome whereas 18 of the 60 regions were sufficiently conserved to match homologous genes in P. ramorum (6 were localised in exons and 12 in introns).
Surprisingly none of these 18 regions contained SSRs in P.
ramorum, however it was hypothesised that microsatellites
could be present in homologous regions of other Phytophthora species more closely related to P. sojae. To verify this
hypothesis, thirty-six primers (18 pairs) were designed in
the conserved flanking regions and used to amplify the
target regions from P. alni, P. cambivora, P. europaea, P. fragariae and an SCRI isolate of P. sojae (Table 7). Degenerate
primers were designed when necessary.
Amplification, sequencing and SSR scoring
Most primer-species combinations produced single PCR
bands of the expected size (Table 8). Purification and
direct sequencing of these PCR fragments produced 54
reliable sequences which were analysed as previously

described for Approach 1. Twelve different microsatellites
were identified: 2 in P. europaea, 3 in P. fragariae and P.
alni and 4 in P. cambivora (Table 8). Among these, 10 were
trinucleotides and 2 were tetranucleotides repeated 4, 5 or
6 times. All regions sequenced from the SCRI isolate of P.
sojae contained the predicted/expected SSR (Table 8).

Discussion
The present study was undertaken to develop a method to
rapidly identify loci containing SSRs and to create a pool
of microsatellite markers for species of the genus Phytophthora taking advantage of publicly available sequences for
P. sojae, P. ramorum and P. infestans. Recently, Garnica et
al. explored the transferability of microsatellites across P.
sojae, P. ramorum and P. infestans via an in silico virtual PCR
approach [27]. In the present study, such an analysis on
the same three species was conducted but also followed
up with a comprehensive screening and validation process
on multiple species to provide a practical evaluation of

the procedure as a means of accelerating the search for
new SSR markers in the genus Phytophthora.
The first approach was aimed at the identification of
informative SSR loci common to many Phytophthora species. This approach was based on the hypothesis that
among the large number of microsatellites distributed
across the genome of species of the genus there may be a
proportion in genes common to many species with sufficient sequence conservation in flanking regions to allow
the design and use of universal SSR primers. Our search of
the predicted gene sets yielded approximately 10% fewer
SSRs and a corresponding lower abundance of SSRs per
Mb of sequence than that of Garnica et al [27]. Preliminary analyses revealed a very limited number of loci containing SSRs that were common to the three Phytophthora
species tested. The majority of the identified loci (81.6%)
were common to P. sojae and P. ramorum only which is
consistent with their closer phylogenetic relationship in
clades 7 and 8 than to P. infestans in clade 1 [9,2,3]. Similarly, Garnica et al. found in their in silico analysis that
7.5% of their primers were, in theory, transferable
between at least two species (mainly P. ramorum and P.
sojae) and only 1.0% transferable between the three spe-

cies [27]. Among the selected sequences satisfying the
above conditions, the number of repeats ranged from 3 to
17 and most SSRs showed seven repeats or less, with a
repeat number of four being the most common in all species. The abundance of different repeat motifs differed
slightly between species however, on average, (AAG)n,
(AGG)n and (AGC)n were the most abundant triplets in
all three Phytophthoras (Fig. 5). These results differ from
those reported by Garnica et al. in which (AGC)n, (ACG)n
and (AGG)n were the most abundant triplets amongst all
the screened EST sequences [27]. It should, however be
considered that unlike the study of Garnica our data are
confined to SSR sequences for which it was possible to
identify a homologue in at least one of the other two species. Therefore it could be hypothesised that motifs
(AAG)n and (AGG)n are more abundant in more conserved genes. The dominance of trinucleotide SSRs compared to dinucleotide SSRs was not surprising considering
that trinucleotides are abundant in coding regions of all
higher eukaryotic genomes [31-33]. Dinucleotide repeats,
in contrast, are characterised by higher mutation rates
which may explain their abundance in introns and noncoding regions and lower frequency in coding regions,
which cannot tolerate frame-shift mutations [34,35].

Primers designed in the present study with the first
approach were tested against a panel of 16 different Phytophthora species representing the breadth of diversity
across the genus to amplify P. sojae, P. ramorum and P.
infestans target regions containing 33, 17 and 8 SSRs
respectively. Overall, these primers enabled the sequencing of 171 target regions which contained 211 SSRs ranging in repeat number from 3 to 16. Most of these SSRs
showed seven repeats or less with four the most common
repeat number and (AAG)n, (AGG)n and (AGC)n the
most common motifs. Trinucleotide repeats were dominant followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and
dinucleotide repeats. This data indicate that such an
approach can be useful to identify cross-specific SSR loci
in the genus Phytophthora. As further genome sequences
become
available,
for
example,
P.
capsici
http:www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/CSP2006/Pcap

sici.html, the process can be refined to specific subsets of
the genus. The mutation rates and, consequently, the practical utility of the identified SSRs in the study of the specific Phytophthora species need to be examined further.
Undoubtedly, a risk of this approach is that the selection
is biased towards more conserved sequences which may
subsequently have a lower mutation rate that reduces
their utility as polymorphic markers. Furthermore, the fact
that P. infestans SSRs were all identified using primers
designed on its own genome (Fig. 3) may indicate that
this approach is less appropriate for distant relatives considering that, as stated above, P. infestans is phylogenetically distant from P. sojae and P. ramorum. However, the
identification of intraspecific polymorphisms in some
selected SSRs is encouraging and demonstrates that at
least some of the selected SSRs are valuable for immediate
practical applications (Table 6). This is consistent with the

reported applicability of EST-SSRs across closely related
taxa in other organisms as well as Phytophthora [23,36-38].
In the present study, the focus on the breadth of species
(16) prevented the analyses of a wider number of target
regions. However, the same method could be easily
applied to the study of more regions from one or a few
species.
The application of the first method enabled the identification of novel SSRs from all the 16 target species with those
of clade 7 and 8 more highly represented (Fig. 3). A higher
proportion of SSRs from species of the clade 7 and 8 was
expected considering that P. sojae and P. ramorum belong
to these two clades [2,3]. In light of this fact, a second
approach to identify a greater number of polymorphic
SSRs from within a more limited range of clade 7 taxa
more closely related to P. sojae was investigated. Sixty P.
sojae SSR candidates were compared by BLAST analysis
against the complete genome sequence of the other two
species yielding 18 SSR candidates which could be aligned

with homologous regions in P. ramorum. However in
none of these 18 candidates (6 exons and 12 introns) was
the SSR maintained in P. ramorum. In four of the more
closely related species (P. alni, P. cambivora, P. europaea
and P. fragariae), however, some of the SSR regions were
conserved (Table 8). In this study the focus was on discovery of SSRs in invasive forest Phytophthora species within
the clade 7a, perhaps a higher success rate in marker discovery would have followed a search amongst the closest
related species in clade 7b (P. sinensis, P. melonis, P. cajanae
and P. vignae) [2]. Although a few SSR markers with
potential were discovered using this approach, it was not
a highly efficient means of identifying new polymorphic
SSR loci and highlights the lack of conservation of SSR
loci, even amongst coding regions within a single ITS
clade of Phytophthora. Some degree of cross-species amplification has been observed between SSRs in P. infestans
with other Clade 1c taxa and it is therefore likely that a
wider application of this method concentrated on the
closest relatives would be more productive [23].

Conclusion
The present study has tested two different methods to generate SSR markers that can be utilised across a broad range
of Phytophthora species. The final number of identified loci
for any single species may not be sufficient to run a complete population genetics analysis and key studies on the
inter- and intraspecific variation remain. A comprehensive dataset of candidate SSRs from a range of species has
been created (Table 3, 4, 5). The detailed groundwork
needed to amplify these regions from such a diverse collection of species and target regions has been completed
which moves beyond the previous in silico approach to
improve our understanding of the range and sequence
conservation of SSR loci amongst species [27]. In general,
the level of interspecific SSR sequence conservation, even
amongst more closely related species within a single
clade, was low and the method may not be the most efficient means of identifying novel SSR loci. Apart from their
application as molecular markers, determining the abundance and density of SSRs in Oomycetes may help understand whether these sequences have any functional and
evolutionary significance [17]. Furthermore, irrespective
of the microsatellites, some of the amplified regions represent valuable marker regions for a number of applications [39]. A single optimal target gene for all Phytophthora
species and assay requirements is unlikely to exist, therefore the continued identification and characterization of
new target genes offers new opportunities for detection
and phylogenetic studies [3,40,41].

Methods
Phytophthora isolates and DNA extractions
Twenty-eight isolates (16 Phytophthora species) sourced
from the SCRI culture collection were used in this study
(Table 1). Isolates and species were selected to represent
taxa most relevant to European forestry that also represented the breadth of Phytophthora diversity defined
according to clades based on ITS sequence analysis [2].
Isolates were stored on oatmeal agar at 5°C and grown on
French bean agar for routine stock cultures.

Total DNA was extracted from pure cultures of Phytophthora according to Schena and Cooke, diluted to 10 ng/μl
and maintained at 5°C for routine amplifications and at 20°C for long term storage [42].
Analysis of sequences from P. infestans, P. sojae and P.
ramorum genome projects and scanning for homologous
SSRs
The predicted protein datasets of P. infestans (from the
NCGR XGI database that was available prior to the Broad
genome sequencing project) and P. ramorum and P. sojae
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ were screened for SSR loci
using Sputnik (Chris Abaijan http://espressosoft
ware.com/pages/sputnik.jsp). Pairwise BLAST analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/620

using the default parameters was used to select loci conserved in different species combinations [43]. Manual
screening of these loci on the basis of SSR and flanking
region DNA sequence conservation yielded a short-list for
further analysis.
Primer design and amplification conditions
All primers (Table 2 and 7) were designed with the
Primer3 Software set up to generate a Tm of 60°C ± 2, a
GC% between 20 and 80% and a length of 18–26 bp [44].
Primers were purchased from Eurogentec ltd. (Belgium).
Considerable effort was made to obtain successful amplification of single PCR bands from as many species as possible. This involved adjustment of MgCl2 concentration
(0.7, 1.0 or 1.7 mM) and annealing temperatures (55 or
58°C) for PCR reactions (Table 3, 4, 5). Furthermore in
some circumstances alternative primers were designed
and tested to amplify the target regions from as many taxa
as possible (Table 2). PCR reactions were performed in a
total volume of 15 μl containing 10 ng of genomic DNA,
1.5 μl of 10× Reaction Buffer (Promega Corporation, WI,
USA), 100 μM dNTPs, 0.7, 1 or 1.7 mM MgCl2, 15 μg BSA,
2 unit of Taq polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase, Promega
Corporation) and 1 μM of primers. PCR amplification
conditions consisted of: 1 cycle of 95°C for 2 min; 40
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55 or 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60
s; and a final cycle of 72°C for 5 min.
DNA sequencing
The best primers and amplification conditions were identified for all primer-species combinations and target DNA
was re-amplified in a total volume of 50 μl to provide sufficient amplicon for direct sequencing. Single PCR bands
were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen Ltd. West Sussex, UK) to remove excess primers
and nucleotides. Sequencing was carried out with the
same primers utilized for the amplification in a dye-terminator cycle-sequencing reaction (FS sequencing kit,
Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and run on an
ABI373 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All
selected PCR fragments were sequenced using both the
forward and the reverse primers.
Sequence analysis and SSRs scanning
The "Sequence Navigator" software (Applied Biosystems)
was utilised to evaluate reliability of sequences and to
compare forward and reverse sequences to create a consensus sequence. Non-reliable sequences in which both
forward and reverse sequences contained doubtful bases
were discarded. All sequences obtained in the present
study were also parsed to a web version of SPUTNIK http:/
/cbi.labri.fr/outils/Pise/sputnik.html, which uses a recursive algorithm to search for repeated patterns of nucleotides of length between 2 and 5.
