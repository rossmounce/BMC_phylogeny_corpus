Unusual conservation of mitochondrial gene
order in Crassostrea oysters: evidence for recent
speciation in Asia
Jianfeng Ren1,4, Xiao Liu1, Feng Jiang2,5, Ximing Guo3*, Bin Liu1,2*

Abstract
Background: Oysters are morphologically plastic and hence difficult subjects for taxonomic and evolutionary
studies. It is long been suspected, based on the extraordinary species diversity observed, that Asia Pacific is the
epicenter of oyster speciation. To understand the species diversity and its evolutionary history, we collected five
Crassostrea species from Asia and sequenced their complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes in addition to two newly
released Asian oysters (C. iredalei and Saccostrea mordax) for a comprehensive analysis.
Results: The six Asian Crassostrea mt genomes ranged from 18,226 to 22,446 bp in size, and all coded for 39
genes (12 proteins, 2 rRNAs and 25 tRNAs) on the same strand. Their genomes contained a split of the rrnL gene
and duplication of trnM, trnK and trnQ genes. They shared the same gene order that differed from an Atlantic sister
species by as many as nine tRNA changes (6 transpositions and 3 duplications) and even differed significantly from
S. mordax in protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the six Asian Crassostrea species emerged
between 3 and 43 Myr ago, while the Atlantic species evolved 83 Myr ago.
Conclusions: The complete conservation of gene order in the six Asian Crassostrea species over 43 Myr is highly
unusual given the remarkable rate of rearrangements in their sister species and other bivalves. It provides strong
evidence for the recent speciation of the six Crassostrea species in Asia. It further indicates that changes in mt
gene order may not be strictly a function of time but subject to other constraints that are presently not well
understood.

Background
Mitochondrial (mt) DNA is widely used for phylogenetic
analysis because of its unique architecture, inheritance
and small size. Metazoan mtDNA is nearly always a circular molecule except for some cnidarians [1]. It contains the same 37 genes, specifying 13 proteins of the
respiratory chain [cytochrome c oxidase subunits I-III
(cox1-cox3), apocytochrome b (cob), ATP synthase subunits 6 and 8 (atp6 and atp8), and NADH dehydrogenase
subunits 1-6 and 4L (nad1-6, nad4L)], 2 ribosomal
RNAs and 22 transfer RNAs. Although there are exceptions, most mtDNAs range in size from 14 to 17 kb.

Typically, there are few intergenic nucleotides except for
a single large non-coding region generally thought to
contain elements that control the initiation of replication and transcription [2]. Size variation in mtDNA is
usually due to the different length of the non-coding
regions. Gene order is generally conserved in most
metazoan taxa although some groups show considerable
variation.
Variations in both mtDNA sequence and gene order
have been used for phylogenetic analysis. Because mtDNA
is fast evolving and nucleotide mutations may return to
an early state, mtDNA sequences may not allow deep
phylogenetic reconstruction. Gene order, on the other
hand, has very small probability of back-mutation and
may be particularly useful for high level phylogenetic
analysis. Although the mechanism of mtDNA rearrangement is poorly understood, mt gene order has been
increasingly used for phylogenetic studies [3-6].

As the second species-rich phylum of the animal kingdom after Arthropoda, Mollusca exhibits tremendous
variation in their mt genomes. Seven bivalve lineages
(Mytilidae, Unionidae, Margaritiferidae, Hyriidae, Donacidae, Solenidae, and Veneridae) have been found to
have an unusual mode of inheritance for mtDNA,
termed doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) [7]. Some
pulmonate gastropods have unusual tRNAs lacking the
T-stem or the D-stem, similar to nematode mt tRNAs
[8]. The atp6 and atp8 genes are separated in the scaphopods and two groups of gastropods (Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia). In addition, several mt genes
are duplicated in cephalopods Watasenia scintillans and
Todarodes pacificus [9]. Unlike the general conservation
in gene order in most other metazoan groups, most
molluscan mt genomes reported so far contain considerable rearrangements especially in Bivalvia and Scaphopoda [10]. At the same time, the phylogeny of molluscs
is poorly studied. Phylogenetic relationships among
major molluscan groups are not well understood. The
species identity and classification of some most common
molluscs remain questionable.
Oysters are bivalve molluscs widely distributed in
world oceans. They are benthic, sessile filter-feeders
with important roles in estuary ecology. Some species
support major fishery and aquaculture industries worldwide. Despite the abundance, ecological and economic
significance of oysters, we know little about their species
diversity and evolutionary history. Classification of
oysters remains a challenge partly due to the lack of
well-defined morphological characters. Shell morphology, the main character used in oyster classification, is
known to be plastic and subject to environmental variation. Much of the oyster classification to date is based
on shell characteristics and has resulted in considerable
errors and confusion. The difficulty of oyster classification is particularly pronounced in China and other parts
of Asia where a large number of species are sympatric
[11,12]. About thirty species have been recorded along
the coast of China [13]. The presence of a large number
of oyster species has led many to believe that Asia Pacific is the epicenter of oyster speciation, but the inability
to reliably identifying them has hindered our understanding of oyster evolution. Among the extent oysters,
five Crassostrea oysters, namely C. gigas, C. angulata,
C. sikamea, C. hongkongensis and C. ariakensis are commonly found in China and other parts of Asia and yet,
they have been difficult to identify by shell morphology
alone. Recently, some confusion in the oyster identification have been resolved using DNA sequence data
[12,14-20], and the five Crassostrea oysters can be reliably identified [21]. Still, we know little about the evolutionary history of the Crassostrea species and how they
relate to each other and the other oysters. For example,

Page 2 of 14

it is not clear whether C. angulata should be considered
as an independent species and which species is the closest relative of the newly described C. hongkongensis.
Most of the phylogenetic analyses so far are based on
short DNA fragments, yielding variable results
[12,16,22].
The ability to sequence and compare whole mt genomes provides a new impetus for phylogenetic analysis
of oysters and other molluscs. Complete mt genome
sequences have been obtained for two Crassostrea
oysters from Asia (C. gigas and C. hongkongensis) and
one species from the Atlantic (C. virginica) [23-25].
Comparative analysis shows that the two Asian species
share the same gene order that is very different from
the Atlantic species [24,25]. To determine if gene order
is conserved in other Asian species and to understand
the evolution of Crassostrea oysters, we sequenced the
mt genomes of four Crassostrea oysters from Asia plus
one that was previously published [25], obtained newly
released mt genomes of two Asian oysters (C. iredalei
and Saccostrea mordax), and compared them with other
molluscan genomes. Here we report the first estimates
of divergence time among Crassostrea species based on
complete mt sequences and the complete conservation
in gene order among the six Asian Crassostrea species.
The complete conservation of gene order is highly
unusual considering the tremendous rearrangement
of mtDNA in most marine bivalves. It provides strong
evidence for recent emergence of the six Crassostrea
species in Asia. Our analysis also suggests that rearrangement of the mt genome may not be strictly a function
of time but subject to some other constraints that are
presently not well understood.

Results and Discussion
Genome composition

Genome composition and organization of the six Asian
Crassostrea oysters is summarized in Figure 1 and additional file 1: Table S1. Organization of the American
oyster C. virginica, a sister species from the Atlantic
Ocean, is listed for comparative analysis (additional file
1: Table S1). The complete mt genomes of C. gigas,
C. angulata, C. sikamea, C. hongkongensis and C. ariakensis are 18,225 bp, 18,225 bp, 18,243 bp, 18,622 bp
and 18,414 bp in length, respectively [24,25]. These
sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the
accession number EU672831, NC_012648-NC_012650,
NC_011518. The American oyster C. virginica mtDNA
is 17,244 bp in length. The mt genome of S. mordax is
16,532 bp in length. However, the mt genome of C. iredalei, 22,446 bp in length, is obviously longer than all
other oysters [54]. The size of molluscan mt genomes
varies dramatically, ranging from 13,670 bp in the snail
Biomphalaria glabrata to 40,725 bp in the sea scallop

Figure 1 Mitochondrial genome map of Asian Crassostrea oysters. All 39 genes are coded on the same DNA strand. Genes for proteins and
rRNAs are shown with standard abbreviations. Genes for tRNAs are designated by a single letter for the corresponding amino acid with two
leucine tRNAs and two serine tRNAs differentiated by numeral. The two tRNA duplications of methionine, lysine and glutamine are named
trnM1, trnM2, trnK1, trnK2, trnQ1 and trnQ2, respectively. The length of five mt genomes is indicated at the lower right-hand corner.

Placopecten magellanicus [41,42]. The six Asian Crassostrea oyster genomes encode 39 genes including 12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 25 tRNAs on the same
strand (Figure 1). In contrast to the typical animal mt
genomes, they lack one protein-coding gene atp8 and
have duplications of three tRNAs: trnM, trnK and trnQ.
Another unique character is that rrnL gene is split into
two segments (also in C. virginica and S. mordax) and
rrnS has a nearly identical duplication, which has never
been reported in other animal mt genomes [23]. Among
the seven Crassostrea oysters, the lowest A+T content is
61.1% in C. virginica, while the highest A+T content is
65.3% in C. hongkongensis. In the other five species, the
A+T content varies from 62.9% in C. ariakensis to
64.5% in C. iredalei [54] (Table 1). The highest A+T

content of C. hongkongensis is mainly caused by the
increased total length and high A+T content of the
non-coding region. The length of coding regions in the
Asian-Pacific oyster genomes is similar and larger than
that in C. virginica, because of duplications of two
tRNAs (trnK and trnQ) and one rrnS.
Gene arrangement

Molluscs, especially bivalves, display an extraordinary
amount of variation in gene arrangement. Gene order of
selected molluscs was presented and compared with
that of oysters in Figure 2. The black chiton Katharina
tunicata is the only sequenced representative of the
Polyplacophora, an early diverged class of the Mollusca
[43]. Its gene order may represent the pleisomorphic

gene arrangement in Mollusca. At high taxonomic
levels, the gene order tends to be conserved across polyplacophoran, cephalopods and gastropods. The gene
order of K. tunicata differs from that of the common
octopus Octopus vulgaris by merely the inversion of
trnP and translocation of trnD. Gene order of other
cephalopods resembles that of O. vulgaris with some
translocations of tRNA or the switch of large gene
blocks [9]. Additionally, the gene arrangement of K.
tunicata differs from that of the blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra merely by the inversion of trnP plus transposition of four tRNAs.
In comparison, however, mt genomes of Bivalvia show
tremendous gene rearrangements. To date, all bivalves
whose mt genomes are available belong to three subclasses: Palaeoheterodonta, Heterodonta and Pteriomorphia. Gene order in freshwater mussel Lampsilis ornata
(Palaeoheterodonta: Unionoida) is nearly identical to
that of it sister species Inversidens japanensis except for
the translocation of several tRNAs, and protein-coding
genes nad2 and nad3 (Figure 2) [10]. In addition, L.
ornata genome contains the atp8 gene which is absent
in I. japanensis (Data not shown). The remaining
bivalves whose mt genomes have been sequenced are
marine species, where the gene order is dramatically
rearranged. Comparing the gene arrangement between
Meretrix petechialis and Venerupis philippinarum (Heterodonta: Veneridae), they share four identical gene
blocks: two large blocks cox1-L1-nad1-nad2-nad4L-I
and cox2-P-cob-rrnL-nad4-H-E-S2-atp6-nad3-nad5, and
two small blocks only containing tRNA genes. They
share only one gene block cob-rrnL-nad4-atp6 with
Acanchocardia tuberculata of the same order. Meanwhile, A. tuberculata and Hiatella arctica share only
two small gene blocks trnM-W and nad2-cox1. Species
sequenced in Pteriomorphia belong to three orders:
Mytiloida, Ostreoida and Pectinoida. Few gene blocks
are shared between any two pairs. Among the four scallops of the family Pectinidae (Pectinoida), gene arrangement of Mizuhopecten yessoensis closely resembles that
of Chlamys farreri. They share three large gene blocks
nad4L-nad6-L2-cob, cox3-K-F-Q-E-atp6-cox2-nad2-T-PI-L 1 -M-nad3-nad4 and N-nad1-R-rrnL-M. But their
gene order is very different from that of the other two
scallops, despite being members of the same family. The
two genomes of C. farreri and Argopecten irradians only
show three small shared gene blocks nad6-L2-cob,
nad3-nad4 and nad1-R-rrnL, while A. irradians and
P. magellanicus only share one gene block L2-cob-cox2.
On the other hand, the mt gene order in the six Asian
Crassostrea oysters is completely identical to each other
(Figure 2). This is highly unusual considering the tremendous rearrangement observed in other groups of
Bivalvia. Even within the same genus, comparison

Page 6 of 14

between the Asian Crassostrea oysters of the Pacific and
the American oyster C. virginica of the Atlantic Ocean
show that gene order has been drastically rearranged.
Gene order of the protein-coding genes (PCGs) is the
same, while several tRNAs has translocated after the
divergence between the Asian and American species.
The six Asian Crassostrea oysters have duplicated gene
trnK, trnQ and rrnS compared with the American
oyster. They differ from the Atlantic sister species by as
many as nine tRNA changes (6 transpositions and
3 duplications), and furthermore, they differ significantly
from S. mordax in PCGs. If the tRNA is not considered,
they share three PCGs blocks cox1-cox3-cob-cox2, nad3nad1-nad4L, nad5-nad6 and atp6-nad2. It is amazing
that Crassostrea sister species from the two oceans have
so much difference in gene order and close relatives
even have more difference in gene order, while gene
order is completely conserved in the six Crassostrea species from Asia. This raises the questions what causes
rearrangements of mt genomes and how do they evolve
over time. Additional studies of mt genomes of other
oyster species would be interesting to see if this pattern
should preserve, which may further our understanding
of mt genome evolution.
Protein-coding genes

Of the 13 typical PCGs (cox1-cox3, nad1-nad6, nad4L,
cob, atp6 and atp8), twelve genes were determined and
the atp8 gene was absent in all oyster genomes. All
PCGs are encoded on and transcribed from the same
strand. These features have been observed in all other
marine bivalve genomes published so far except for
H. arctica where the atp8 gene has been reported, and
for two species of Palaeoheterodonta (L. ornate and
I. japanensis) where genes are coded on both strands
(Figure 2). Thus, coding genes on the same strand and
missing atp8 gene are the most distinct features of marine bivalve mt genomes, though from a recent publication from Breton et al [57] this might only hold true for
Ostreoida and a few other bivalves. The two Palaeoheterodonta species that use both strands for coding are
the only known members of Bivalvia showing significant
conservation in gene order with other molluscan classes
that also use both strands for coding. We suspect that
coding on both strands may be inhibitory to mt genome
rearrangement, and marine bivalves show a tremendous
amount of mt genome rearrangement because they only
use one strand for coding. Rearranging a genome with
dual-strand coding may be more complicated and cause
more harm than rearranging a genome that codes on
one strand.
Mt genomes often use a variety of non-standard initiation codons [44]. In some cases, identification of the
very clear initiation codon is difficult when several

first and the second positions. The genomic features of
19 bivalve sequences are presented in Table 1. The statistics of A+T content, start and stop codon, and amino
acid number of PCGs in C. iredalei is already described
in Wu et alâs paper [54].

alternatives are inferred representing the start of coding
sequence in a region. Most of PCGs initiate with the
standard start codon ATG. Standard start codon ATA is
used for cox3 in C. virginica, nad4 in C. hongkongensis
and nad4L in C. sikamea and in C. ariakensis. Nonstandard initiation codon GTG is used for nad5 in
C. ariakensis, and ATT is used for nad6 in C. hongkongensis (Table 2). There are no obvious patterns in termination codon usage; the usage frequency of stop codon
TAG is similar to that of TAA. Incomplete termination
codons T and TA were also used. Termination codon
TAA is used in 9 PCGs of C. virginica; if the incomplete
termination codon is considered, the number of TAA is
up to eleven. The PCGs with identical termination
codon in the six genomes are nad1 and nad4L, which
ended with TAA and incomplete stop codon T, respectively (Table 2).
The number of amino acids coded by each of the mt
genomes is approximately equal. Excluding the stop
codons, the C. virginica mtDNA encodes the least
amino acids (3,696), while the C. gigas mtDNA encodes
the most amino acids (3,718). Oysters with the lowest
(60.1%) and highest (64.5%) A+T compositions of protein-coding region are C. virginica and C. hongkongensis,
respectively. Similarly, oysters showing the lowest and
highest A+T content of the first and the third positions
are also C. virginica and C. hongkongensis: 55.0% and
58.3% for the first position, and 64.7% and 75.3% for the
third position, respectively. However, the A+T content
of the second position is approximately the same in the
six genomes ranging from 60.0% in C. hongkongensis to
60.5% in C. virginica. It is obvious that the A+T content
of the third codon position is higher than that of the

Nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions

The estimation of nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates is of great significance in
understanding evolutionary dynamics of protein-coding
sequences across closely related species [55,56]. To
detect the influence of selection pressure in Crassostrea
species, the numbers of Ka and Ks were calculated and
their ratios were plotted for all pairwise comparisons
among the seven oysters (Figure 3 and additional file 2:
Table S2). The ratio of Ka/Ks in all 12 protein-coding
genes varied from 0.001 for cox2 in C. angulata_C. sikamea and C. gigas_C. sikamea to 0.2657 for nad6 in
C. angulata_C. ariakensis, which supports the existence
of different mutation constraints among genes. Most of
the amino acid substitutions are localized in the NADH
complex genes. It suggests a relaxation of purifying
selection in the nad6, nad2, nad3, nad5 genes compared
with the more conservative genes such as cox1, cox2
and atp6.
Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes

The mt genomes of the six Asian Crassostrea oysters
encode 25 tRNA genes. In addition to the 22 typical
tRNAs, there are three duplications of trnM, trnK and
trnQ. In comparison, however, there is no duplication of
trnK and trnQ in C. virginica. The tRNA structure of
C. gigas is referred to as the standard when the nucleotide

variation in other four Asian oysters is examined (C. iredalei is not examined as it was not sequenced in this study).
Nucleotide variations including transition/transversion
and insertion/deletion mostly occur at DHU and TÎ¨C
loops (Additional file 3: Figure S1).
Duplication of tRNA is common in molluscs. A second trnM is also presented in the mussel Mytilus edulis,
M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus [45-47], and the
clam V. philippinarum, H. arctica and A. tuberculata
[48]. In P. magellanicus, there are up to ten copies of
trnM [42]. In M. trossulus mtDNA, an additional copy
of trnQ has also been reported [47]. The anticodon
usage of oyster genomes is congruent to the corresponding tRNA of other molluscs with one exception.
The anticodon of two trnMs in the oysters is CAU
while that of two trnMs is CAU and UAU in Mytilus.
The difference in anticodon corresponds to the third
wobble position.
The boundaries of both the small and the large ribosomal genes were determined by BLAST with the
revised annotation of C. gigas genome [23]. The rrnL
gene is split into two segments, one segment of 5â end is
distributed between trnQ1 and trnN, and the other segment of 3â end is located between cox1 and cox3. The
split rrnL is first reported in C. virginica, but so far not
reported in other metazoan mt genomes. The mt

genome of S. mordax also has the split rrnL, however, it
does not have the duplicated rrnS. The duplication of
rrnS is only found in the six Asian Crassostrea oysters
and the similarity between intraspecies and interspecies
is high (95-100%) in the conserved 940 nucleotides at
the center of rrnS sequences. The size of rrnL in the
Asian Crassostrea oysters is nearly equal, and smaller
than that in C. virginica (Table 1). The length of rrnS in
C. virginica is 989 bp, while total length of rrnS in the
Asian Crassostrea oysters varies from 2,232 bp (C. sikamea) to 2,264 bp (C. hongkongensis).
Non-coding regions

As in most bivalves, the oyster mtDNAs contain a large
number of unassigned nucleotides. There are more than
30 non-coding regions throughout the seven Crassostrea
genomes. The unassigned nucleotides vary from 1,788
bp in C. gigas to 5,873 bp in C. iredalei. The proportion
of the unassigned nucleotides in the whole genome varies from 9.81% in C. gigas to 26.17% in C. iredalei. The
largest non-coding region in the Asian oysters is located
between gene trnG and trnV, while it is between gene
trnP and trnG in C. virginica. The sequence of each corresponding non-coding region from the six Asian Crassostrea oysters was listed separately and regions large
than 30 nucleotides were aligned using ClustalX 1.83.

Ren et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/394

There are 14 non-coding regions aligned (See the Supplement to the non-coding regions). The alignment
shows that there are sequence conservation in the noncoding region, especially, higher sequence conservation
in the regions between trns2 and trnP, trnV and nad2.
The sequence similarity among species in the noncoding region is positively correlated with their
relatedness.
Phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation

Phylogenetic analysis using all mt coding sequences provides clear evolutionary relationships among the seven
Crassostrea and one Saccostrea oyster species (Figure 4).
C. gigas is first clustered with C. angulata and then united with C. sikamea, meanwhile C. hongkongensis and C.
ariakensis formed a clade. Finally, C. iredalei with other
five Crassostrea oysters form a large Asian clade.
Together with Asian Crassostrea oysters, the C. virginica
formed the Crassostrea clade. S. mordax diverged early
from Crassostrea oysters and was positioned at the base
of the large oyster clade. All the phylogenetic relationships are supported with high values. The close relationships between C. gigas and C. angulata, and C.
hongkongensis and C. ariakensis are clearly demonstrated
on the phylogenetic trees (Figure 4), which has been the
subject of debate for some time [14,12,22]. The complete mt genomes of C. gigas and C. angulata differed
by 3%, providing strong support for their status as two
independent species.
The first appearance of Gastropoda and Bivalvia in
fossil record is approximately 542 Myr ago [40],

Page 9 of 14

providing the calibration constraint for divergence estimation. Divergence time estimates between species and/
or clades are given in Table 3 and Figure 5. Our estimation shows that C. virginica and the Asian oysters
diverged about 82.7 Myr ago. The six Asian Crassostrea
oysters started their divergence about 42.8 Myr ago with
the separation of C. iredalei from other species first.
Other two large clades C. hongkongensis and C. ariakensis, and C. sikamea, C. gigas and C. angulata diverged
28.8 Myr ago. C. hongkongensis and C. ariakensis
diverged 22.3 Myr ago. In the other clade, C. sikamea
diverged from C. gigas and C. angulata 16.5 Myr ago.
The two most closely related species, C. angulata and
C. gigas, diverged about 2.7 Myr ago.
These estimates indicate that, relative to the divergence with C. virginica about 83 Myr ago, the speciation
of the six Asian Crassostrea species is rather recent or
3-43 Myr ago. Still, it is difficult to reconcile molecular
divergence with genome rearrangement data observed
here. Assuming the divergence time estimates are correct, it is intriguing that the mt genomes of C. virginica
and the Asian species diverged with nine structure rearrangements (6 transpositions and 3 duplications) in
about 83 Myr, while there was not a single rearrangement event among the six Asian Crassostrea species in
the past 43 Myr. During the same time frame, numerous
rearrangement events occurred among scallop species
(Figure 2). Thus, the complete conservation of gene
order among the Asian Crassostrea oysters in the past
43 Myr is highly unusual, given the amazing rate of mt
genome rearrangements in marine bivalves in general

and within the genus Crassostrea itself. While this finding provides strong evidence for recent speciation of the
six Asian Crassostrea species, it also indicates that mt
genome rearrangement may not be strictly a function of
time, but constrained by other factors. Detailed mechanisms of mt genome rearrangement are unknown. We
suspect that coding on both strands may be one of the
factors inhibiting mt genome rearrangement. This
hypothesis is supported by the fact that the only two
bivalve molluscs (L. ornata and I. japanensis) with dualstrand coding have relatively fewer rearrangements
of gene order compared with other molluscan classes
(Figure 2). All marine bivalves use one strand for coding
and show tremendous rearrangements. The extensive
rearrangement of bivalve mt genomes may be a consequence of coding on one strand. Furthermore, the fact
that massive rearrangements in marine bivalves have not
disrupted single-strand coding or changed the direction
of transcription suggests that the rearrangements are
not caused by inversion or reverse transposition. Thus,
transposition or âtandem repeat-random lossâ[49] may
be important for mt genome rearrangement [29].
Dual-strand coding may not be the only factor limiting mt genome rearrangement, as it cannot explain the
absence of rearrangements in the six Asian oysters over
43 Myr. We speculate that some other unknown features in mt genomes of the six Asia species may also
limit genome rearrangements. The most noticeable
structure change is the duplication of rrnS in the six
Asian species, though it is difficult to determine if it has

any effects on genome rearrangement at current stage.
Further studies on the mt genomes of other oysters and
marine bivalves may shed light on the origin and evolution of genome rearrangements. Gene order data have
been shown to be valuable in phylogenetic analysis
[3-6]. While our analysis demonstrates the power of
rearrangement data, it also argues for a better understanding of mt genome rearrangement before using
them to infer divergence time.

Conclusions
Asia Pacific has long been suspected to be the center of
oyster speciation. Our analysis of complete mt genomes
provides strong evidence that Crassostrea oysters have
diversified in Asia and the divergence was rather recent
or within the last 3-43 Myr. The complete conservation
of gene order in the six Asian Crassostrea species over a
period of 43 Myr is highly unusual given the remarkable
rate of rearrangements in their sister species and other
bivalves during the same time frame. It provides strong
evidence, in addition to sequence data, for the recent
speciation of Crassostrea oysters in Asia. It also indicates that changes in mt gene order may not be strictly
a function of time but subject to other constraints that
are presently not well understood.
Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction

Specimens for the five Asian Crassostrea species were
mostly collected from coastal waters of China, except

that C. gigas was collected from a cultured population in
Oregon, USA. C. gigas is a native species of Asia and was
introduced to the West Coast of USA for aquaculture
production. The oyster ID, geographic origin and collection date of each specimen are provided in Table 4. All
oysters were identified according to their morphological
characteristics first and confirmed with species-specific
molecular markers [21]. Total genomic DNA was

method and dissolved in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl 1 mM
EDTA pH 8.0) buffer before being stored at -20Â°C.

designed for C. gigas. The remaining gaps were amplified with the species-specific primers designed according
to the obtained sequences. As for C. hongkongensis, two
short fragments of cox1 and cox2 were first amplified
with the universal primer sets of LCO1490+ HCO2198
[53] and cox2F+cox2R [26,27]. In addition, partial
sequence of nad5 was amplified with the primers of C.

gigas. Then, the whole mt genome was amplified based
on three pairs of primers (Additional file 4: Table S3).
PCR reactions were performed with a Mastercycler
gradient machine (Eppendorf). The cycling was set up
with an initial denature step at 94Â°C for 2 min, followed
by 35 cycles comprising denaturing at 94Â°C for 20 sec,
annealing at 52-58Â°C for 1 min and elongation at 68Â°C
or 72Â°C for 6 or 10 min depending on the expected
length of the PCR products. The process was completed
with a final elongation at 72Â°C for 10 min. The reaction
volume amounted 25 Î¼l containing 18.8 Î¼l sterile deionized water, 2.5 Î¼l 10ÃLA PCR buffer (Mg2+ plus,
Takara), 1 Î¼l dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1 Î¼l each primer
(5 Î¼M), 0.2 Î¼l LA Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/Î¼l,
Takara) and 0.5 Î¼l DNA template (50 ng/Î¼l). A negative
control (no template) was included during each PCR
run. PCR products were directly purified with MultiScreen-PCR96 Filter Plate (Millipore) and sequenced
with ABI 3730x1 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis and gene annotation

Raw sequencing reads were first processed using Phred
with the quality score 20 and assembled in Phrap with

Page 12 of 14

default parameters [28,29]. Then, all assemblies and
sequence quality were verified manually in Consed to
remove misassemblies [30]. The accurate boundary of
each gene was determined according to the annotated
C. gigas mt genome [23] with minor revisions. The
tRNA genes were identified by tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [31]
employing the cove only search mode and the invertebrate mt genetic code. The ratio of nonsynonymous and
synonymous substitutions rates (Ka/Ks) was estimated
with Ka_Ks calculator in all 12 protein genes of seven
Crassostrea oysters.
Phylogeny analysis and divergence time estimation

Nineteen molluscan mt genomes including four
obtained in this study were used for phylogenetic analysis (Table 5). The black chiton Katharina tunicata
(Polyplacophora) was rooted as the outgroup. The
amino acid sequence from each of 12 protein-coding
genes (excluding atp8) was aligned separately using
ClustalX 1.83 [33], and then trimmed to the same length
and concatenated for further analysis. The nucleotide
sequence was substituted from the concatenated amino
acid alignment. The final nucleotide sequence consisted

of 9,537 sites. Two phylogenetic reconstruction
approaches were performed including Maximum Likelihood (ML) with PHYML 3.0 [34] and Neighbor-Joining
(NJ) with MEGA 4.0 [35]. The assessments of node
reliability in both the ML and NJ analyses were done by
using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Molecular estimates of divergence time for multiple
gene data were performed using the relaxed Bayesian
molecular clock approach as implemented in MULTIDISTRIBUTE package [36]. Key features of this program are
that posterior distribution of molecular time estimates and
rates of molecular evolution are approximated while
simultaneously taking account of uncertainty in branch
length estimates from each gene [37]. The F84+gamma
evolution model, incorporating different rates of transition/transversion, variable nucleotide frequencies, and
nucleotide variation across sites, was used to estimate the
maximum likelihood parameter in PAML version 3.15
[38]. The Multidivtime program used the output from
Estbranches analyses to estimate node divergence times
for the ingroup, given time constraints, various parameters, and estimated priors. The median of all the tipto-root branch lengths was calculated using ape and
LAGOPUS package in R project [39]. Gamma priors
were chosen as the following procedure outlined in the
Multidivtime manual: expected time between the tip and
the ingroup root (rttime) = 542 Myr (million years) ago,
with standard deviation (SD) = 30 Myr ago; rate of the
root node (rtrate) and its SD = 0.46 substitution per site
per 100 Myr determined as the median of all the tip-toroot branch lengths divided by rttime; and rate of change
between ancestral and descendant nodes (brownmean) =
0.18. Katharina tunicata was considered to be outgroup
to Bivalvia and Gastropoda as required by the program.
All divergence time were calculated assuming the topology of the consensus tree, which was derived from previous ML/Bayesian analyses based on protein sequences.
The first appearance of skeletons in the fossil record,
indicating the maximum for the origin of Gastropoda +
Bivalvia is approximately 542 Myr ago, provides the calibration constraint for divergence estimation [40]. The
parameters for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation were set as follows: number of samples =
10,000, sample frequency = 200 and burn-in period =
2,000. Finally, Multidivtime analyses considering variance-covariance matrices from each gene partition were
run twice ensure convergence, each one starting with a
different random initial seed number.
