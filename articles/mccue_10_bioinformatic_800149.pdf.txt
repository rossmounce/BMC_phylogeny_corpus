Bioinformatic analysis of CaBP/calneuron proteins
reveals a family of highly conserved vertebrate
Ca2+-binding proteins
Hannah V McCue, Lee P Haynes*, Robert D Burgoyne*

Abstract
Background: Ca2+-binding proteins are important for the transduction of Ca2+ signals into physiological outcomes.
As in calmodulin many of the Ca2+-binding proteins bind Ca2+ through EF-hand motifs. Amongst the large
number of EF-hand containing Ca2+-binding proteins are a subfamily expressed in neurons and retinal
photoreceptors known as the CaBPs and the related calneuron proteins. These were suggested to be vertebrate
specific but exactly which family members are expressed outside of mammalian species had not been examined.
Findings: We have carried out a bioinformatic analysis to determine when members of this family arose and the
conserved aspects of the protein family. Sequences of human members of the family obtained from GenBank were
used in Blast searches to identify corresponding proteins encoded in other species using searches of nonredundant proteins, genome sequences and mRNA sequences. Sequences were aligned and compared using
ClustalW. Some families of Ca2+-binding proteins are known to show a progressive expansion in gene number as
organisms increase in complexity. In contrast, the results for CaBPs and calneurons showed that a full complement
of CaBPs and calneurons are present in the teleost fish Danio rerio and possibly in cartilaginous fish. These findings
suggest that the entire family of genes may have arisen at the same time during vertebrate evolution. Certain
members of the family (for example the short form of CaBP1 and calneuron 1) are highly conserved suggesting
essential functional roles.
Conclusions: The findings support the designation of the calneurons as a distinct sub-family. While the gene
number for CaBPs/calneurons does not increase, a distinctive evolutionary change in these proteins in vertebrates
has been an increase in the number of splice variants present in mammals.

Introduction
Many aspects of cellular function are regulated by
changes in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+
([Ca2+]i) [1]. Increased [Ca2+]i leads to changes in the
Ca2+ loading of various Ca2+-binding proteins [2]. In the
case of those proteins that act as Ca 2+ sensors, Ca 2+
binding results in a significant conformational change
that can expose sites for the interaction of target proteins [3]. Regulation of the function of the target proteins results in a wide range of physiological changes.
Ca2+ signals in cells can vary in their amplitude, timing
and spatial localisation [4,5] and this in part contributes
to how changes in the concentration of a single ion can

lead to a multitude of physiological outcomes. Signalling
specificity is also generated by the existence of multiple
Ca2+ sensors that have different properties and specific
target proteins [3,6].
The ubiquitous protein calmodulin is the best known
Ca2+-sensor [7]. It binds Ca2+ through its four EF hand
domains first identified in the Ca2+-buffer protein parvalbumin [8]. There are large numbers of known EFhand containing proteins [9] some of which form distinct families. Examples of these are the S100 proteins
in vertebrates [10] and the calcineurin-like (CBL) proteins in plants [11,12]. In neurons, Ca 2+ has multiple
functional effects on timescales ranging from 10s of
microseconds to many minutes and so neuronally
expressed Ca2+ sensors have been of particular interest.
Two such families that have become more widely

studied in recent years are the neuronal calcium sensor
(NCS) [6,13] and the CaBP [14-17] proteins. One aspect
that could provide important functional clues is an
understanding of how these families have appeared and
expanded during the evolution of increasingly complex
organism behaviour. In the case of NCS proteins, a single gene known as frequenin or NCS-1 is encoded in
fungal genomes and there has been a progressive expansion of the family during evolution. Three NCS proteins
(similar to NCS-1) are expressed in C. elegans, whereas
D. melanogaster has four NCS proteins that include two
frequenins, a neurocalcin and a single Kv channel-interacting protein (KChIP). Zebrafish (D. rerio) have two
NCS-1 orthologues, 8 visinin-like proteins (VILIPs), a
recoverin, 8 guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins
(GCAPs) and 5 KChIPs. All mammals have a highly
conserved set of 14 NCS genes that encode one NCS-1,
5 VILIPs, one recoverin, three GCAPs and four KChIPs.
There are in addition, multiple isoforms of KChIPs
expressed in mammalian neurons generated by alternative splicing [18]. Analogously, the plant CBL proteins
have also shown an increase in gene number during
evolution. There is one CBL orthologue in algae and the
CBLs increase progressively in number through mosses
and onto higher plants [12]. These findings suggest that
expansion of families of Ca2+-sensors by gene duplication may contribute to increased signalling complexity
in higher organisms. The neuronally-expressed calciumbinding proteins (CaBPs) were thought to be expressed
only in vertebrates [14]. Two of the proteins named
CaBP7 and 8 [15] were also discovered independently
and named calneuron 2 and 1 respectively [19,20].
While these latter two proteins were suggested to be
part of the CaBP family [15], others have suggested that
the calneurons are a distinct subgroup of the CaBPs
[19,21]. The latter interpretation is consistent with the
analyses described in the current paper and, therefore,
we will refer to them henceforth as calneurons 1 and 2.
We have carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the
vertebrate CaBPs/calneurons to gain insight into the
evolution of this protein family. In contrast to the NCS
protein families, all of the CaBP/calneuron genes may
have arisen together. They are all expressed in the teleost fish D. rerio and the family members are present in
evolutionary later species with the short isoform CaBP1
and calneuron 1, in particular, showing high levels of
sequence conservation across species. The major evolutionary change after the teleost separation from tetrapods appears to be an increase in the number of splice
variants of CaBPs in mammals.

Methods
The accession numbers used for bioinformatic analysis
of the human CaBP/calneuron proteins retrieved from

Page 2 of 12

the GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez were: caldendrin (NM_001033677), CaBP1L
(NM_031205), CaBP1S (NM_004276), CaBP2S
(NM_031204), CaBP2L (NM_016366), CaBP4
(NM_145200), CaBP5 (NM_019855), CaBP7 or calneuron 2 (NM_182527), CaBP8 or calneuron 1
(AY007302) calmodulin (AAA35635). These sequences
were used in BLASTP searches [22] using BLAST 2.2.22
at NCBI http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi against
the database of non-redundant protein sequences for
each organism individually. Further searches for missing
CaBP sequences and for identified domains were carried
out using TBLASTN searches against the Reference
genomic sequence and the Reference mRNA sequence
databases. The accession numbers of sequences used for
analysis of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) proteins were: calmodulin (NP_955864), CaBP1 (NP_001002414), CaBP2
(NP_001025439), CaBP4 (XP_001338361), CaBP5
(NP_956992), CaBP7 or calneuron 2(XP_683885),
CaBP8 or calneuron 1(XP_690899). The additional
duplicated proteins identified in zebrafish were CaBP1
(NP_001005962), CaBP2 (XP_688066), CaBP5
(NP_00108568), CaBP7 or calneuron 2(XP_001920190),
CaBP8 or calneuron 1(XP_001343041). The positions of
the EF-hand motifs were identified by comparison to
the EF-hand consensus sequence [8] and alignment with
calmodulin. Searches within the genomes of other species were carried out on 21 st January 2010 at NCBI.
Blast search of genomic sequences of the elephant shark
(Callorhinchus milli) were carried out at http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/.
Multiple sequence alignments were compiled using
ClustalW (matrix: BLOSUM62 and default settings) and
the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor version 6.0.5 (@
Tom Hall, Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, California; http://
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Tables of identity values were generated using the Sequence Identity
Matrix option in BioEdit. The open reading frames from
the mRNA transcript of human calneuron 1 (CaBP8) isoform 1 (NM_031468.3) and 2 (NM_001017440.2) were
found using BioEdit and the sequences surrounding the
start sites analysed for the presence of a Kozak consensus
sequence [23].
For the creation of a phylogenetic tree of human and
zebrafish calneurons and CaBPs, the variable portion of
the N-termini amino acid sequences were removed from
each protein and ClustalW was used to create an alignment. The C-termini of the alignment was adjusted to
create a more realistic representation of homology in
this region. A maximum likelihood tree was created
using the Phylip suite of programs. Seqboot.exe was
used to make 2000 bootstrapped data sets from the
alignment. Proml.exe was then used to find the phylogeny estimate for each of these data sets using the

McCue et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:118

maximum likelihood method for protein amino acid
sequences. Calmodulin was selected as the out-group
root at this stage. A consensus tree was then created
from the outtree file from Proml.exe using consense.exe.
The final consensus tree was drawn using TreeView.

Results
Human CaBP/calneuron proteins

The CaBP/calneuron family expressed in humans is
derived from six genes. Two of these CaBP1 and CaBP2
give rise to three (caldendrin, CaBP1S, CaBP1L) or two
(CaBP2S, CaBP2L) splice variants respectively (Figure 1).
The human gene originally described to encode CaBP3
overlaps with the CaBP5 gene [14]. CaBP3 is found in
human genomic sequences but in no other species and
CaBP3 expression has not been detected [15]. CaBP3 is
most likely, therefore, to be a pseudogene and is therefore not included in Figure 1. Note that despite the published numbering of CaBPs [15], CaBP6 has not been
described.
Alternative transcripts of calneuron 1 were present in
Genbank for Homo sapiens and a number of other species that could encode an N-terminally extended version
of calneuron 1. The start codon in these transcripts was
not surrounded by a Kozak consensus sequence suggesting that they may not be translated efficiently. In support of this suggestion, no evidence has been provided
for the expression of a large form of calneuron 1 protein. We, therefore, did not include the long form in
our analysis.
Figure 1 shows the multiple sequence alignment of the
CaBP/calneuron protein sequences along with calmodulin. Residues which are identical or similar across the
proteins are highlighted. The position of the four EFhand loop domains in each protein is shown by the line
above the sequences. The C-terminal portion of the proteins containing the EF-hand motifs is the most conserved region of these proteins with the N-terminal
region being most divergent. Compared to calmodulin
the CaBPs and calneurons have an extended linker
region between EF hands 2 and 3 (underlined in green
in Figure 1). There is a high level of identity in the
CaBPs over this linker region but this region is not so
similar in the calneurons. Some of the EF hands have
undergone deletions or substitutions within their EF
hand loop which mean they are likely unable to bind
Ca2+ or other cations at these positions. In caldendrin/
CaBP1 several substitutions in the conventional EF hand
motifs were predicted to prevent coordination of divalent cations by EF2 [14] and biochemical and structural
analysis of CaBP1S confirmed that EF2 cannot bind
Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ [24,25]. The EF2 of CaBP2, 4 and 5
would also be predicted not to bind cations due to deletions or substitutions in the loop. In calneuron 1 and

Page 3 of 12

calneuron 2 there is a three amino acid deletion in EF3
and the binding loop of EF4 has both substitutions and
insertions thus these proteins are predicted to only bind
divalent cations using EF1 and EF2 [15,19].
Table 1 shows the percentage identity between each of
the proteins in the multiple alignments of human proteins. The short forms of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5
exhibit the highest sequence similarity to calmodulin
with around 36% identity. Overall Table 1 highlights
that the CaBPs show only limited similarity with calmodulin. The source of this divergence lies within the Nterminal regions of the CaBPs and the members with
longer N-termini have the least sequence identity to calmodulin. This table also shows that calneurons 1 and 2
have the lowest comparative identities within the CaBP
family. Although they have 63% identity with each
other, the maximum identity score which occurs
between calneuron 2 and CaBP5 is only 24.7%. The
identity scores between CaBPs 1-5 however suggest
higher relatedness between these proteins. These values
support the idea of two distinct sub-groups within the
CaBP/calneuron family. Such a division is also supported by the presence of a 38 amino acid hydrophobic
extension which occurs at the C-terminus of calneuron
1 and 2 that is missing from the other CaBP members
and is important in membrane targeting [26]. In addition, a different pattern of active EF-hand motifs is seen
in the calneurons with EF1 and EF2 being predicted as
being high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and EF3 and EF4
being unable to bind to Ca2+. In the rest of the CaBPs
EF1, EF3 and EF4 are all predicted to be active in Ca2+
binding.
Search for CaBPs in other species

In order to gain some insight into when the CaBPs first
arose during evolution, database searches were carried
out by performing BLAST searches of each of the
human CaBP sequences in comparison to available
sequence data. Specific, detailed searches were made in
the NCBI databases for particular organisms. No proteins with significant homology greater than calmodulin
were detected in Drosophila species or in Caenorhabdities elegans as representative invertebrate species.
Searches of genomes of the early deuterostomes, the sea
urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), sea squirt
(Ciona intestinalis) and amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) also did not identify any candidate CaBPs again
with best matches to calmodulin or calmodulin-like proteins. Similarly no CaBP candidates were identified
within lamprey or hagfish (cyclostomes) sequence data.
A search of available sequence data for cartilaginous fish
(Chondrichthyes) within NCBI did not detect the existence of proteins with clear homology to CaBPs apart
from calmodulin but searches of the genomic data for

the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milli) did identify 5
short sequences indicating the likely presence of at least
three CaBPs related to CaBP1 and 5 and also the presence of both calneurons 1 and 2. The fragmentary nature of these data precluded further analysis. Full
sequences of CaBPs and calneurons were identified in
teleost genomes including puffer fish and zebrafish. We
concentrated upon CaBP/calneurons identified in zebrafish but it is likely, however, that the CaBP/calneurons
arose as a full family before the separation of cartilaginous and teleost fish.
Zebrafish CaBP/calneuron proteins

A complement of CaBP proteins could be detected in
teleost fish and in fact the zebrafish genome encodes
genes corresponding to all of the human CaBP/calneuron genes (Figure 2 and Tables 2, 3). The teleost
genome underwent a whole genome duplication event
[27] and we identified two separate genes for all of the
CaBP/calneurons except CaBP4. To allow easier comparison with human sequences we selected zebrafish
sequences with the highest similarity to their human
counterparts. In Table 2 highlighted cells show the percentage identities between identified orthologues. Distinct long and short isoforms of CaBP1 and CaBP2 were
not found in zebrafish but the highlighted cells show
that the zebrafish CaBP1 is most like the human CaBP1
short form and the zebrafish CaBP2 is most like the
human CaBP2 long form (Table 2). Over 60% identity
between the zebrafish and human orthologues is seen
for most family members but only 44.7% is seen in the
case of CaBP4. This illustrates that the CaBPs are
strongly evolutionarily conserved, particularly in the
case of calneuron 1 which shows 93.1% sequence identity between zebrafish and human proteins. Other
CaBPs show more divergence between zebrafish and
humans (Table 2 and Figure 3).
A phylogenetic tree rooted on calmodulin was constructed based on the sequences of the human and

zebrafish CaBPs and calneurons (Figure 4). For this analysis the N-terminal domains of each protein that in
some cases vary between splice isoforms were excluded
as they are highly variable and not well conserved suggesting that they are under less functional evolutionary
pressure. Instead the core “calmodulin-like” domains
were compared. The analysis divided the tree into two
clades consisting of the CaBPs and the calneurons
respectively. Amongst the CaBPs, CaBP2 and 4 form a
distinct subgroup from CaBP1 and CaBP5.
As seen for the human CaBP proteins certain of the
EF hands in the zebrafish proteins are predicted to be
inactive in divalent cation binding and these were the
same as those in the human proteins (Table 4). In addition to having EF hands with inactivating substitutions
and deletions leading to impaired cation binding, certain
CaBP EF hands are predicted to bind Mg2+ rather than
Ca2+. The nature of the residue at position 12 of the EF
hand loop motif (the sequence in EF hand 1 of calmodulin for example being DKDGDGTITTKE) is crucial in
that substitution of glutamate by aspartate has been
shown to diminish binding of Ca2+ in favour of Mg2+.
CaBP1 is predicted to bind Mg 2+ rather than Ca2+ at
EF1 and this was confirmed in structural analyses that
indicated that it is constitutively Mg2+ bound whereas
EF3 and EF4 can bind to both Ca2+ and Mg2+ [24,25].
Human CaBP5 also has an aspartate at position 12 in its
predicted functional EF hand 1. We examined the
degree of conservation of EF hand properties between
zebrafish and human proteins. The same patterns of EF
hand inactivation were observed for the proteins of both
species (Table 4). Comparison of the amino acid at position 12 and the percentage identity of the EF hand loops
indicated varying degrees of conservation. Overall the
most conserved EF hand in the CaBPs was EF4. There
were no differences at position 12, and thus in predicted
Mg2+ versus Ca2+ binding, for the EF hands of CaBP1.
In contrast, EF hands in CaBP2,4 and 5 were found to
have the D substitution in zebrafish predicting Mg 2+

caldendrin, CaBP1L and CaBP2S splice variants in zebrafish and variability in the N-termini of CaBP2L and
CaBP4. We compared the sequences of CaBPs from a
wider range of species including zebrafinch (Taeniopygia
guttata), chicken (Gallus gallus), frog (Xenopus laevis),
opossum (Monodelphis domestica), dog (Canis lupus
familiaris), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), cow (Bos taurus), macaque (Macaca mulatta) and
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and observed a number of
evolutionary changes in the protein family. We could
not find evidence for either CaBP4 or CaBP5 in available
amphibian or bird genomic or protein sequence databases but this may be a consequence of the incompleteness of the genome sequences for these species.
The extended N-terminal domain of caldendrin is
encoded by mammalian but not other genomes. The
relative sequence identity of other relevant domains in
the CaBPs is compared in Figure 5 and these show different patterns of evolutionary change. The domain that
defines CaBP1L (CaBP1L16-75) which was not in the
zebrafish was present from Xenopus onwards with relatively little subsequent change in sequence identity compared to human caldendrin. The variable N-terminal
domain of CaBL2L (1-56) was not found in available
amphibian, bird or marsupial genomic sequences. In
mammalian species this domain showed a progressive
increase in similarity to the human protein. The variable
N-terminal region of CaBP4 (1-120) was present in marsupials and also showed a progressive increase in
sequence identity with the human protein.
Expression of target proteins for the CaBP/calneuron
proteins

A number of target proteins are known for the CaBPs
and it would be of interest to know if these co-evolved
with the CaBPs and arose at the same time with the
appearance of vertebrate species. Several CaBPs and calneurons have been shown to interact with and regulate
various voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs) [28-36].
Despite the absence of CaBPs and calneurons in invertebrates these organisms possess VGCCs related to the
major VGCC families in vertebrates. Drosophila, and C.

elegans for example have genes encoding VGCC that are
orthologues of the mammalian VGCCs alpha subunits
that are regulated by CaBPs. Another known target for
mammalian CaBP1, the IP3 receptor [37-39] is also present in invertebrates. Caldendrin has been shown to
interact with the protein Jacob [40] and interestingly, this
protein is also a vertebrate-specific protein. The N-terminus that distinguishes caldendrin from the splice variants
CaBP1S and CaBP1L is not present in species below
mammals. Jacob can, however, bind the EF-hand core
domain that is present in CaBP1 as well as caldendrin
[40] and it is possible, therefore, that in lower vertebrates
Jacob is regulated by CaBP1 or even other CaBPs.

Discussion
This study has examined the presence of genes encoding
CaBP/calneuron proteins in a range of species. Based on
relative sequence identity, pattern of EF hand inactivation
and phylogenetic analysis the calneurons appear to be a
distinct subfamily from the CaBPs. We found that no
CaBP/calneuron orthologues could be found in invertebrate species, in early deuterosomes or in lampreys and
hagfish. The presence of at least 5 CaBP/calneurons was
detected in the elephant shark genome database but the
sequences were too fragmentary for further analysis. In
the case of the teleost zebrafish the whole family of
CaBP/calneurons was present. We have also examined
evolutionary changes in CaBP/calneuron protein
sequences in vertebrates. Calmodulin is highly conserved
in all organisms and even where there are multiple calmodulin genes in a species these encode an identical
sequence [41]. When vertebrates diverged from invertebrates the calmodulin sequence became invariant. In
contrast to calmodulin, other Ca2+ sensor proteins have
more specialised functions. Certain families of Ca2+ sensor proteins show evidence of progressive increases in
complexity during evolution with an increase in the number of distinct genes. This is typified in animals by the
NCS protein family [6] and in plants by the CBL proteins
[11,12]. It should be noted however that while there is a
general increase in NCS genes from one in fungi to 14 in
mammals for one subfamily, the GCAPs, there was also a

transient expansion in their number in zebrafish compared to mammals [42,43]. In contrast to these protein
families, it is likely that the CaBPs/calneurons arose as a
full complement of genes prior to the separation of cartilaginous fish and the main subsequent increase in complexity stems from an increase in splice isoforms.
CaBP4 and CaBP5 are expressed predominantly in retinal photoreceptors where they regulate different
VGCCs [14,34,44] and have been shown to play nonredundant roles in phototransduction in mammals
based on studies on knockout mice [34,44]. In addition,
mutation in CaBP4 in humans leads to congenital visual
disorders [45,46]. Both CaBP4 and CaBP5 are present in
zebrafish but we did not find them in the available genome sequences of amphibia (Xenopus) or birds. It is
possible, however, that this is due to the fact that these
genomes are not yet complete and contain gaps. There
were significant differences in the N-terminus of CaBP4
in zebrafish compared to human CaBP4 suggesting that
there may be some species differences in the regulation
of photoreceptor function.
The pattern of active and inactive EF hands in the
CaBPs/calneurons was no different in zebrafish compared to human proteins. EF hands 3 and 4 are predicted
to be functional in CaBP2, 4 and 5 and are of the specific

Ca2+-binding type (E at position 12 of the EF hand) in
both zebrafish and human proteins. In contrast, the predicted functional EF hand 1 in CaBP2, 4 and 5 have D at
position 12 in zebrafish but not in the human CaBP2 and
4 proteins suggesting that there is a change from Mg 2
+
-binding to specific Ca2+-binding for EF hand1 in certain human CaBPs. This may have some functional significance as it could result in different structural effects
of Ca 2+ binding in CaBP2 and 4 in zebrafish versus
human proteins. Human CaBP1 short is the only member of the family to be characterised structurally [24,25].
Occupancy of EF hand 1 by Mg2+ has a global effect on
the conformation of CaBP1 compared to the apo form of
the protein and it was suggested to stabilise the protein
in its interaction with target proteins in the absence of
Ca2+ [24] with more limited conformational changes on
Ca2+ binding to the other EF hands. Human CaBP2 and
4 would differ from CaBP1 as none of their functional EF
hands are predicted to preferentially bind Mg 2+ . A
further understanding of the consequences of the predicted differences in specificity of cation binding of the
EF hands of CaBP proteins will require resolution of
additional structures of human and zebrafish proteins.
One general issue about the CaBPs is the extent to
which they have overlapping or non-redundant roles. In

McCue et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:118

addition, despite their relatively low level of sequence
identity with calmodulin they do bind to some common
targets such as VGCCs although the physiological effects
on the VGCCs differ [47]. The existence of the neuronally expressed CaBPs (1 and 2) and calneurons in all vertebrates suggests that they have functionally important
and potentially non-redundant roles. Particularly noteworthy is the high level of conservation of calneuron 1
and CaBP1S which have 93.1 and 86.8% identity between
zebrafish and human proteins. Again this argues for significant conserved functions. The only characterised
target for calneurons is the enzyme phosphatidylinositol4-kinase (PI4K) IIIb. Both calneurons bind to and inhibit
this enzyme which is required to generate inositol lipids
needed for vesicular traffic from the Golgi complex.
Orthologues of PI4KIIIb have similar roles in yeast [48]
and flies [49] and so this inhibitory control by the calneurons is a more recent regulatory mechanism. To date,
however, there are no knock-outs of CaBP1, CaBP2 or
the calneuron genes in any species that would allow a
test of the non-redundancy of their functions.

Conclusions
The analyses reported here are consistent with a designation of the calneurons as a distinct sub-family of the
CaBPs. In the case of other families of EF-hand containing proteins there is evidence for a progressive increase
in the family number during evolution. In contrast the
gene number for CaBPs/calneurons does not increase
from at least teleost fish (and perhaps from cartilaginous
fish) onwards. A distinctive evolutionary change in these
proteins in vertebrates has instead been an increase in
the number of splice variants present in mammals.
