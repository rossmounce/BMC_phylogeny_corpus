Abstract
Background: Indonesia is one of the countries most severely affected by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) virus in terms of poultry and human health. However, there is little information on the diversity of H5N1
viruses circulating in backyard farms, where chickens and ducks often intermingle. In this study, H5N1 virus
infection occurring in 96 smallholder duck farms in central Java, Indonesia from 2007-2008 was investigated and
the molecular and antigenic characteristics of H5N1 viruses isolated from these farms were analysed.
Results: All 84 characterised viruses belonged to H5N1 clade 2.1 with three virus sublineages being identified: clade
2.1.1 (1), clade 2.1.3 (80), and IDN/6/05-like viruses (3) that did not belong to any of the present clades. All three
clades were found in ducks, while only clade 2.1.3 was isolated from chickens. There were no significant amino acid
mutations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sites of the viruses, including the receptor binding,
glycosylation, antigenic and catalytic sites and NA inhibitor targets. All the viruses had polybasic amino acids at the
HA cleavage site. No evidence of major antigenic variants was detected. Based on the HA gene, identical virus
variants could be found on different farms across the study sites and multiple genetic variants could be isolated from
HPAI outbreaks simultaneously or at different time points from single farms. HPAI virus was isolated from both ducks
and chickens; however, the proportion of surviving duck cases was considerably higher than in chickens.
Conclusions: The 2.1.3 clade was the most common lineage found in this study. All the viruses had sequence
characteristic of HPAI, but negligible variations in other recognized amino acids at the HA and NA proteins which
determine virus phenotypes. Multiple genetic variants appeared to be circulating simultaneously within poultry
communities. The high proportion of live duck cases compared to chickens over the study period suggests that
ducks are more likely to survive infection and they may better suit the role of long-term maintenance host for
H5N1. As some viruses were isolated from dead birds, there was no clear correlation between genetic variations
and pathogenicity of these viruses.

Background
Avian influenza (AI) viruses have been isolated from a
wide range of avian species representing several orders
[1,2]. However, AI virus isolations have been reported
mostly from the orders of Anseriformes [3], especially
from dabbling ducks (subfamily Anatinae), which have

been detected carrying a number of H3, H4 and H6 subtype viruses, but less commonly H5, H7 and H9 viruses
[4,5]. Although 16 antigenic subtypes of HA (H1-H16)
and 9 antigenic subtypes of NA (N1-N9) of AI viruses
have been identified [5,6], viruses from H5 and H7 subtypes have become a particular concern because they can
cause severe and fatal infection in both avian and mammalian hosts, including humans [7,8]. Experimental studies showed that ducks were susceptible to the infection
of some Asian H5N1 subtype viruses with varied degree

of disease severity, ranging from minimal clinical signs to
death, but they could continue to shed virus when surviving infection [9,10].
Since the initial H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in China in
1997, the virus has circulated continuously amongst poultry causing subsequent epidemics in several countries
across Asia, Europe, and Africa [11]. In Indonesia, HPAI
virus infection was announced firstly in January 2004,
despite this virus was suspected to have caused deaths in
chickens already since October 2003 [12]. A phylogenetic
study estimated that the time of the first introduction of
H5N1 virus into Indonesia was between April and July
2003 [13]. Although details of the original introduction of
H5N1 into Indonesia poultry are still unclear, there is a
direct precursor-descendant link between H5N1 viruses
isolated from Hunan province, China in 2002 and the
Indonesian 2.1 clade viruses [14]. Up until March 2011,
Indonesia continued to report the majority of outbreaks in
poultry worldwide, with 31 of 33 provinces in this country
affected and more than 11 million chickens have died or
been culled [15,16]. In some circumstances, H5N1 virus
can be transmitted to humans resulting in fatal disease.
Indonesia also reported the highest prevalence in humans
up to June 2011 with a case fatality of 82% (146 of 178)
[17].
To date, all Indonesian H5N1 viruses have been classified into clade 2.1, with three virus sublineages being present within this clade: 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 [18]. The
viruses within clade 2.1.1 were mainly isolated from
HPAI-infected poultry during the outbreaks between
2003 and 2005. Clade 2.1.2 consisted of avian- and
human-derived viruses, isolated predominantly from
Sumatra between 2004 and 2007. Clade 2.1.3 comprised
a range of viruses that were isolated either from birds or
from humans since 2004. While clade 2.1.3 viruses have
predominated and they continue to circulate in Indonesia, the number of isolated H5N1 viruses from clade 2.1.1
and 2.1.2 has substantially declined since 2005 [19].
Although 2.1.3 viruses have spread and become endemic
in many provinces in Indonesia, a new sublineage virus
has emerged since 2004 [19,20].
Genetic and antigenic data are important to provide
more insight into the epidemiology of HPAI in Indonesia.
A recent epidemiological study on scavenging ducks in
smallholder farms in central Java, Indonesia, emphasized
that such birds are potentially an important source of H5
virus for native chickens [21]. Most of the previous molecular studies of Indonesian isolates were derived from
either chickens or humans. Inadequate data of H5N1
viruses isolated from avian species other than chickens,
particularly wild or domestic ducks has meant that little
is known about the diversity of H5N1 viruses circulating
amongst duck populations in Indonesia. The aim of this
study is to characterize H5N1 viruses isolated from 96

smallholder duck farms in central Java, Indonesia
between 2007 and 2008. We determined phylogenetic
and antigenic relationships of the duck- and chickenderived H5N1 viruses and we analysed, within the HA
and NA genes, the known molecular determinants of
pathogenicity, receptor binding, antigenic and catalytic
sites, and antiviral susceptibility. We also incorporate
field data from a longitudinal survey and disease outbreak
investigations in those farms in order to investigate their
relationship with the molecular findings.

Methods
Sample collection and diagnostic tests

Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected every
two months from individually banded domestic ducks
and in-contact chickens during a longitudinal survey
conducted between March 2007 and March 2008 on 96
smallholder duck farms in four districts (Magelang,
Kulon Progo, Bantul, and Sleman) in central Java, Indonesia [21]. From each bird, the two swabs were placed
into a single tube containing 3 ml viral media (Universal
Viral Transport, BD-Decton, Dickinson and Company,
Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Samples were also collected during the investigation of bird diseases or bird
deaths on the study farms. Oropharyngeal and cloacal
swabs were collected from decayed carcasses, while fresh
carcasses were transferred to the veterinary diagnostic
laboratory at Disease Investigation Centre (DIC) Regional
IV Wates, Indonesia, for post-mortem examination and
collection of tissue samples. During disease events, the
apparently healthy banded birds in the outbreak farms
were also swabbed. There was no clinical assessment for
birds from which the samples were collected either during the survey or during investigation of diseases; thus,
the bird clinical status was only recorded as live or dead.
Molecular and virological testing was conducted in the
DIC Wates. Swab media sub-samples from the survey
were combined in pools of five by species and tested for
the presence of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for
type A influenza and H5 subtype as previously described
[22]. Virus isolation in specific-antibody-negative (SAN)
embryonated chicken eggs was performed on original
rRT-PCR positive or indeterminate swabs collected in
the longitudinal survey and on swabs and tissue samples
collected during disease investigations. The H5 virus
then was confirmed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay with H5-specific antiserum using standard methods
[23].
Virus isolates

Equal numbers of virus isolates from chickens (n = 50)
and ducks (n = 50) were selected from 132 samples collected over the study period of 13 months and they

Wibawa et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:425
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/425

were sent to the CSIRO Australian Animal Health
Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong, Australia, for molecular
and antigenic characterization. These viruses were propagated in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated
chicken eggs within microbiological physical containment level 3 facilities at AAHL. Allantoic fluid was collected and tested for haemagglutination of chicken red
blood cells (RBC), followed by rRT-PCRs for influenza
type A and H5 subtype viruses [22].
Eighty-four samples were found to have viable H5
subtype virus and they were subjected to molecular
characterization. Of these 84 viruses, 8 were isolated
from dead ducks, 46 from dead chickens, and 28 and 2
were isolated from live ducks and live chickens, respectively. Seventy-six (90.5%) viruses were isolated from live
or dead ducks or chickens during the investigation of
disease outbreaks, while the remaining eight (9.5%)
viruses were isolated from live ducks during the bimonthly survey. A high proportion of these viruses were
collected in July 2007 (19 isolates from 7 farms) and
September 2007 (29 isolates from 7 farms), followed by
January 2008 (12 isolates from 6 farms) and August
2007 (8 isolates from 3 farms). A lesser number of
viruses were isolated from 2-4 farms in May, June,
November and December 2007.
Nucleotide sequencing of the virus isolates

Sequencing of the HA gene was conducted on all 84 virus
isolates, while a subset of 24 isolates were selected for NA
gene sequencing based on characteristics of their HA
amino acid sequence and position in the HA phylogenetic
tree. Viral RNA was extracted from allantoic fluids using
RNeasyÂ® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Australia) as per manufacturerâs protocol. One-step RT-PCR reaction were performed with Super-Scriptâ¢ III Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Australia) using respective primers for HA
and NA, to obtain overlapping fragments that span the
entire coding sequence of each gene. All primers were
tagged with M13 compatible sequences to facilitate
sequencing (primer sequences available upon request).
Conditions for RT-PCR were 48Â°C for 30 min, followed by
40 cycles of 94Â°C 30 sec, 54Â°C 40 sec, and 68Â°C 40 sec, and
final extension 68Â°C for 5 min. PCR products were
extracted from an agarose gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Australia), and each purified amplicon
was used directly for cycle sequencing using BigDye TerminatorÂ® v3.1 Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Post sequencing products were purified
using BigDye XT TerminatorÂ® Purification Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) prior to running on the
ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA).
The HA and NA nucleotide sequences of the virus isolates reported in this study are available in GenBank

database under 108 accession numbers [GenBank:
CY091859 to CY091966].
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis

DNASTAR Lasergene 8.0 sequence analysis software
(DNASTAR, Inc., Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA) was used
for raw sequence data assembly and editing. Virus gene
sequences were aligned using ClustalW program within
the Bioedit 7.5 program [24] to compare with representative Indonesian H5N1 influenza A virus sequences that
have been published and available on GenBank database
[18,19]. Multiple sequence alignments of the HA (1683 bp)
and NA (1353 bp) coding sequences, were used for phlylogenetic analysis. To determine the evolutionary relationships of the viruses, phylogenetic analysis was conducted
using the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method provided in the
MEGA 4.0 software [25] with 2000 bootstrap replicates
and the Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93) for nucleotide substitution
model. Clustering within H5N1 clades was investigated
by pairwise analysis of HA sequence pairs between and
within groups using the same MEGA program. Amino
acid sequences were analysed to identify known residues
associated with HA receptor binding, antigenic and pathotyping cleavage sites, NA active sites, and sites associated
with NA inhibitor susceptibility. H5 numbering [26] used
throughout the study was based on the alignment with
A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) minus the 16 amino
acids known as HA signal peptide [27]. N1 numbering of
the isolates was based on the alignment with the same
H5N1 virus, starting from the initiating methionine
residue.
Detection of selection pressure on the HA genes

Potential positive (diversifying) and negative (purifying)
selection affecting the HA gene were detected by three
codon-based maximum-likelihood methods, single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood
(FEL), and internal fixed effects likelihood method
(IFEL), using the web interface of the HY-PHY package
(http://www.datamonkey.org) [28]. A statistical significance of no greater than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was used on
each method, which meant that less than 5% of neutrally
evolving sites may be incorrectly classified as selected
[28]. The Akaikeâs Information Criterion test selected
TN93 as the best fitting model of nucleotide substitution in this package; therefore, positive selection (nonsynonymous substitution rate higher than synonymous
substitutions rate, dN >dS) and negative selection (dN
<dS) were predicted in all test methods using this model.
Antigenic analysis

The 24 virus isolates that were selected for NA sequencing were further characterized for their antigenic reactivity based on the HI test using a panel of chicken sera

Wibawa et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:425
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/425

produced from two clade 2.1.3 virus antigens, A/
chicken/Konawe Selatan/BBVM-204O/2007 (Konawe
204O/07) and A/chicken/Indonesia/Wates1/2005
(Wates1/05) and one clade 1 antigen, A/chicken/Vietnam/08/2004 (Vietnam/08/04). Another serum generated from clade 2.1.3 virus antigen was also used to
detect any viruses that were antigenically similar to the
recognized antigenic variant, A/chicken/West Java/
PWT-WIJ/2006 (PWT-WIJ/06) [29,30].
For the HI assay, 25 Î¼l PBS was added to all wells of a
96-well U-bottom microtiter plate. Each serum was
diluted 1:4 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3), and
then added in 25 Î¼l volumes to each well of column 1 and
2 of each test plate. Two-fold serial dilutions of sera were
performed from column 3 to 11. Four hemaglutination
unit (HAU) in 25 Î¼l of working solution of viral antigen
was added into all wells of these columns, but not to
column 1 and 12 because they served as serum and RBC
controls, respectively. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C
for 30 min. Working solution of antigen was back titrated
in a separate plate by 2-fold dilutions. Fifty microlitres of
0.5% chicken RBCs was added to all wells and the plates
were incubated at 4Â°C and read after 45-60 min. The HI
titre was determined to be the inverse of the last dilution
of sera showing complete inhibition of RBC agglutination.
The antigenic pattern of each virus was expressed based
on HI titers using the reciprocal value of log2.

Results and Discussion
H5 virus infection in smallholder duck farms

In total, 132 H5 subtype viruses were isolated from 46
of the 96 study farms over the 13-month study period
(Table 1). H5 virus was first isolated from a live duck,
sampled in March 2007 during the bi-monthly survey on a
farm in Bantul district. The virus was detected at repeated
events (an event is the sampling date from which virus isolations were made, either from the longitudinal survey or
from the investigation of diseases) on 17 of these 46 farms.
Of these 17 farms, 7 farms (farm no. 1-7) had repeated
events detected in single species (only in chickens or
ducks), whereas 10 farms (farm no. 8-17) had repeated
events detected in both species. The majority of these farms
had repeated virus isolations at two different events, with
the exception of two farms on which H5 virus could be isolated at three different events (farm no. 9: two events in
July 2007 and one event in December 2007, and farm no
14: three events in September and December 2007 and
February 2008). On the remaining 29 farms (farm no. 1846), H5 virus was detected at a single event, mostly in only
one species, except for two farms (farm no. 30 and 34) on
which H5 viruses were isolated from both chickens and
ducks on one day during the outbreak investigation. These
results, which showing multiple H5 virus isolations from
single farms over different months and in both species,

Page 4 of 17

indicate that the virus may circulate over long periods at
the flock or farm level. We wished to investigate if these
long periods of virus detection resulted from persistence of
single variants or introduction of new viral variants (discussed below).
The number of H5 viruses collected from ducks and
chickens per month varied over the study period (Figure 1).
Throughout the study locations, large numbers of viruses
were isolated in some months, for example in July 2007
(7 ducks, 18 chickens) and in September 2007 (14 ducks,
20 chickens), whereas in other months (April and October
2007) no viruses were detected. When examined at the district level, the case numbers constituting these peaks occur
mainly in single districts, indicating the relatively localised
nature of epidemics. The temporal analysis by species
further indicates that while duck cases were more stable
over time, chicken cases tended to occur in epidemics, and
when present they usually exceeded duck cases in any particular months. It also shows that chicken cases were usually
associated with duck cases, but duck cases were often
independent.
Although both farm species were affected by HPAI outbreaks, the outcomes of H5 virus infection in ducks
seemed to be different to that in chickens. Of the 61
duck-derived viruses, 49 (80.3%) were isolated from live
birds, whereas only 10 of 71 (14.1%) chicken-derived
viruses were isolated from live birds. Thus, the virus
might be more successfully maintained and shed by
ducks, often without producing any symptomatic disease.
In contrast, a high case fatality rate was always observed
in chickens during the HPAI outbreaks, leading also to
the more effective reporting of infected chickens compared to ducks. Therefore, where chicken cases occurred
they were detected at a higher frequency than in ducks.
The increased proportion of live birds, particularly in
ducks, being H5 virus positive in certain months coincided with an increase in the number of HPAI outbreaks
(July and September 2007) on the same study farms that
were reported previously [21]. This is indicative of an
increase of live ducks shedding H5 virus during outbreaks. The H5 virus isolation from live chickens suggests that these chickens were in the early stages of HPAI
infection, as we could not find these birds in the following survey or disease investigation indicating that they
had died or been culled.
Phylogenetic analysis

The phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that
all the H5N1 viruses in the present study belonged to
clade 2.1 (Figure 2a). The viruses shared 97-100%
nucleotide similarities in the HA gene and 96-100% in
the deduced amino acid sequences. The majority of the
viruses (80/84) clustered into the third-order clade 2.1.3,
one virus belonged to clade 2.1.1, and three viruses were

The viruses (n = 132) were grouped according to the frequency of isolations (cases) on each farm and to the source species (duck and/or chicken). Two types
of visit were conducted on the study farms; bi-monthly longitudinal survey (LS) and investigations of disease outbreaks (DI). An event is the sampling date in
which virus isolations were made.

clustered together into a distinct sublineage, which was
previously described as Indonesia/6/05 (IDN/6/05)-like
viruses [19], whilst no any viruses belonging to clade
2.1.2 were observed in this study. All of the IDN/6/05like viruses, including three viruses from this study,
were descended from a single evident node supported
with a high bootstrap statistical value (99%) and had
greater than 1.5% average nucleotide distance to other
respectively clustered Indonesian H5N1 sublineages
recognised as clades 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3. Previous
study indicated that the IDN/6/05-like viruses have
emerged since 2004 and continue to circulate predominantly in poultry in Java [19].
High phylogenetic relatedness was found amongst the
viruses belonging to clade 2.1.3 in this study. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of these viruses
were high (98-100%), indicative of genetic homogeneity.
However, it seems the viruses within this clade could
further be clustered into three distinct groups, which was
supported with high bootstrap value (> 90%), here referred
to as group I, II and III (Figure 2a). The majority of these
were clustered in group II (24 viruses) and III (55 viruses),
while only one virus isolate (Ck/Magelang/BBVW-662764/07) was situated in group I together with one of the
representative viruses that was isolated previously from
West Java in 2006. Despite a number of H5N1 sublineages
could be identified in this study, we did not observe clear
phylogenetic groupings based on the species, clinical status
or district origin, which indicates that H5N1 HPAI

infection was widespread in the study sites affecting both
chickens and ducks.
In relation to district of origin, viruses isolated from
Kulon Progo district seemed to have the lowest diversity
within district level than the viruses isolated from the
three other districts, as they only clustered in group III of
clade 2.1.3. Twenty-two viruses isolated from Sleman district were distributed between clade 2.1.1 (1), group II
(11), and group III (10). In Bantul district, 3 viruses were
classified as IDN/6/05-like viruses, while another 3 and 14
clustered within clade 2.1.3 into groups II and III, respectively. All the viruses originating from Magelang district
belonged to clade 2.1.3 with 1, 9 and 11 viruses belonged
to the group I, II and III, respectively. Despite the fact that
our virus isolates came only from one region in Java and
considering the relatively short study period of 13 months,
these results suggest that multiple lineages of clade 2.1
viruses have circulated in smallholder backyard farms in
central Java and the clade 2.1.3 viruses, in particular, have
prevailed amongst poultry on those farms.
H5N1 viruses isolated from ducks appeared to be genetically more diverse than those isolated from chickens. All
three virus clades (2.1.1, 2.1.3, IDN/6/05-like) that were
identified in this study were isolated from ducks, while only
clade 2.1.3 viruses were found in chickens (Figure 2a). We
reported previously that H5 RNA was more often detected
in live ducks than in live chickens [21], either in the absence
or in the presence of antibodies. This implies that H5 virus
could circulate more frequently or continuously amongst

Figure 2 Phylogenetic relationship of the HA and NA genes of the virus isolates. The HA (A) and NA (B) phylogenetic trees were
constructed by the NJ method with TN93 nucleotide substitution model. Analyses were based on nucleotides 13-1695 and 4-1356 for the HA
and NA genes, respectively. Bootstrap values under 50% are not shown. Scale bars indicate number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Viruses
isolated from live birds are shown in open squares, while those from dead birds are shown in closed squares. Taxon (virus) names are followed
by months when they were isolated and are colour-coded by district of origin: Sleman (red), Bantul (green), Magelang (blue) and Kulon Progo
(purple) and sequences obtained from GenBank (black). IDN/6/05-like viruses are shaded in grey. The 2.1.3 clade viruses identified in this study
are clustered into three groups; I, II and III (shaded in blue).

birds within flocks of ducks. Moreover, duck flocks in our
study farms were 12.4 times more likely to have positive
antibodies against H5 virus than those in chicken flocks
[21] suggesting that ducks are more likely than chickens to
harbor antibody to genetically diverse viruses. Previous studies suggested that antigenic variants can be propagated
during long-term infection in ducks [9] and antibodies carried by ducks could either protect them against re-infection
or exert selection pressure on variants in free-grazing duck
populations [31]. Nevertheless, of the 84 viruses analysed in
the study, only 4 viruses were from clades other than 2.1.3;
therefore, firm conclusions on the species range of the
clades cannot be made.
Twenty-four selected viruses had NA nucleotide
sequence identity of 96-99%, with the corresponding
deduced amino acid sequence similarity of 97-99%. The
highest nucleotide divergence (3%) in the NA gene
amongst the study viruses was found in Dk/Bantul/BBVW387-23310/07. For the majority of the viruses that were
aligned and analysed, the NA phylogeny corresponded to
the HA phylogenetic groupings suggesting concordant evolution of the surface glycoprotein genes amongst the H5N1
viruses examined (Figure 2b). However, we observed placement of some viruses with an IDN/6/05-like HA in different positions within the NA phylogenetic tree. Most of
these, including one of our viruses, were clustered into two
separate lineages in the NA tree, with the exception of one
of the representative clade 2.1 viruses (Ck/Indonesia/Soppeng1631-72/07), which situated outside of those two
lineages (Figure 2b, displayed in grey shade). Furthermore,
the other representative virus that contained an HA
belonged to clade 2.1.3 (Ck/Indonesia/Semerang1631-62/
07), clustered into one of those NA lineages with some
IDN/6/05-like viruses. These indicate that genetic reassortment events may have occurred on the surface glycoprotein genes of the clade 2.1 viruses.
Molecular characterization of important sites determining
phenotype

High conservation of amino acid sequences was found at
the receptor binding site (RBS) of the HA protein. However, some variations were observed at positions 189 (R
to K) and 217 (S to P) (Table 2). Three viruses with an
IDN/6/05-like HA carried K at position 189 and 218,
whereas all the other viruses had 189R and 218K. Binding
specificity analysis of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) using a
glycan microarray showed that K at positions 189 and 218
(193 and 222 in H3 numbering) could increase the interaction of the virus with avian a2-3-linked sialic acid (SA)
receptor analogs [32]. Though the mutation of S217P (221
in H3 numbering) in the HA protein of A/Vietnam/1203/
04 showed the a2-3 SA receptor binding preference, this
mutation could affect specificity of this virus to bind
human a2-6 linkage receptors [32]. The S217P substitution

Page 9 of 17

was detected in one of our viruses, Ck/KP/607-605/07
(Table 2); thus, further study maybe important to understand the significance of this substitution. Other known
mutations linked to increased binding specificity to humanlike SA receptors, including Q222L and G224S (226 and
228 in H3 numbering) [32-34], were not observed in all the
study viruses, indicating they retained avian receptor-binding characteristics.
The maximum-likelihood methods (SLAC, FEL and
IFEL) found no positively selected (p > 0.05) codon in all
amino acid sites in the HA1 and HA2 regions of hemagglutinin of the study viruses. In contrast, several codons
appeared to be under negative (purifying) selection (p <
0.05) (data not shown). Using the FEL method, 40 codons
(24 in HA1 and 16 in HA2) were detected to be restrained
by negative selection. The IFEL and SLAC methods were
more conservative indicating possible negative selection in
only 14 codons (9 in HA1 and 5 in HA2) and 5 codons
(2 in HA1 and 3 HA2), respectively. Of the 14 codons predicted to be under possible negative selection using IFEL
method, one was located in the putative antigenic site B
[31,35] (codon 124, p < 0.046) and the other was in the
N-linked glycosylation site [36] (codon 155, p < 0.040).
Despite no evidence of positive selection in the HA of
the viruses, amino acid differences were identified at six
positions (83, 86, 124, 138, 140 and 141: H5 numbering)
within regions homologous to antigenic sites A, B, and E
of the H3 HA protein [31,35] (Table 2). Twenty-three
viruses (13 chicken and 10 duck) had V to A substitution
at amino acid 210, a residue in the putative antigenic site
D [31] (data not shown). The four duck viruses outside
of clade 2.1.3 (1 belonged to clade 2.1.1 and 3 classified
as IDN/6/05-like viruses) possessed more amino acid
changes in the other known antigenic sites compared to
the clade 2.1.3 majority. All reported IDN/6/05 HA
sequences, including our three viruses, possessed a T at
position 140, which was not the case for all other HA
sequences in this study. In one of our isolates belonging
to clade 2.1.1, amino acids Q, K and S were found at
position 138, 140 and 141 respectively, which was characteristic of other known clade 2.1.1 viruses. A previous
study indicated that five amino acid residues within the
HA antigenic sites A and E (positions 83, 86, 138, 140
and 141) of 2002-2005 H5N1 genotype Z influenza
viruses from southern China and Southeast Asia were
under positive selection pressure [12]. Since we detected
no positive selection in the HA sequences of our sample
of viruses, the virus population appeared to be stable at
this gene. This is expected, as the H5N1 outbreak in
Indonesia began about four years prior to the survey.
However, it does indicate that there were no significant
evolutionary pressures changing the viral population
of the backyard and smallholder poultry sectors at this
time.

To evade the hostâs immune defenses, addition of oligosaccharides at certain positions of the HA protein is
commonly used by influenza viruses to mask the antigenic epitopes from antibody recognition [36]. Compared to the Eurasian H5N1 progenitor, A/Goose/
Guangdong/1/96, an addition of N-linked glycosylation
sequence (NST) at the HA protein was detected at position 154 to 156 in all the viruses, except one virus (Dk/
MG/24-44380/08) that had S155N substitution (Table
2). Additional glycosylation at this site has been commonly observed in other clade 2.1 viruses. We did not
observe extra oligosaccharides at or adjacent to the HA
antigenic sites. Furthermore, HA sequence characterization predicted that all the viruses were of the highly
pathogenic phenotype, as shown by the presence of
multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site
sequences [37,38], with 5 motifs observed: RESRRKRR/
(7 isolates), RERRRKKR/(4), RESRRRKR/(2), KESRR
KKR/(2), and RESRRKKR/(69) (Table 2).
The potential of NA as a target for antiviral therapy
has been investigated using NA inhibitors to limit influenza virus infection by blocking the NA enzyme active
site [39]. Amino acids relevant to the enzyme-active site
of influenza virus neuraminidase [40] were maintained
in most of the 24 isolates sequenced (Table 2). One substitution of I223V was found in Dk/BT/387-23310/07 at

Despite natural variations found in the HA antigenic
epitopes in some of the viruses, there was no substantial
difference in terms of their HI antigenic patterns, indicating that they were antigenically similar (Figure 3).
Most of the viruses, including some that had acquired
amino acid substitutions at recognised HA antigenic
sites, were antigenically closest to A/Ck/Indonesia/

the NA framework region, which has no direct contact
with the substrate sialic acid. NA sequence alignment
confirmed a 20-amino acid deletion in the NA stalk
region (position 49 to 68: N1 numbering), one of the
proposed molecular determinants for the adaptation of
influenza viruses from their wild reservoirs to domestic
species [41]. Mutations at several recognised NA active
sites, including E119V, R152K, D199N, H275Y and
R293K, have resulted in resistance of influenza virus to
NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir [42,43]. Reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir has
been previously reported in Indonesian H5N1 viruses
isolated from poultry, which sharing I117V and I314V
mutations in the NA protein [44]. However, none of the
selected viruses in the present study possessed these
mutations.

region (central Java) as the study viruses. They had substantial HI reactivity (range of 7 to 9 log2) to Wates1/05
antiserum. Two viruses (Dk/BT/358-24381/07 and Dk/
MG/604-44401/07) expressed lower antigenic reactions
(6 log2) against this serum, although they were both in
clade 2.1.3. In contrast, all the selected viruses demonstrated antigenic difference to antiserum produced
against antigenic variant A/Ck/West Java/PWT-WIJ/06
[29,30], with HI titres less than 3 or 4 log2. In response
to Konawe/204O/07 antiserum, the viruses showed low
to moderate reactivity, ranging from 3 to 6 log2. The
clade 1 antiserum, Vietnam/08/04, reacted to some
extent (4 to 7 log2) against all selected isolates; this
therefore suggests that cross-protection could occur
between H5N1 viruses isolated from Vietnam and those
isolated from Indonesia.
Multiple infections of H5N1 virus in smallholder duck
farms

On a number of occasions during the 13-month study,
multiple H5N1 viruses were isolated from the same farm,
either simultaneously or at different sampling points (see
above). Amino acid diversity in the HA1 or HA2 molecules of influenza virus hemagglutinin was detected
among the viruses from 8 of the 29 farms where multiple
viruses were collected (Table 3). On 5 farms (farm no. 4,
9, 13, 32, 34), a substitution of A to V was found in the
HA signal peptide in viruses isolated from some, but not
all birds on those farms. Most of the isolates had T at
position 86, one of the residues in antigenic site E [31,35].
However, T86I substitution was found in 3 of 5 viruses
each on farm no. 9 and 30. Another amino acid substitution (S to R) was detected at the HA antigenic site A (position 140) of 2 viruses each on farm no. 30 (of 5 viruses)
and farm no. 4 (of 4 viruses). In addition, a S217P change
was detected at the RBS of the HA gene in 1 of 6 viruses
isolated from farm no. 11 over a 4-day period in September 2007. Amino acid polymorphisms were also observed
in the HA cleavage site sequences. Four isolates from farm
no. 34 had two different polybasic residues (2 RRKRR/and
2 RRKKR/), 1 of 4 viruses from farm no. 32 had a different
sequence motif to the other 3 viruses (RRRKR/and
RRKKR/respectively), and 3 motifs (1 RRRKR/, 3 RRKRR/
and 6 RRKKR/) were detected among 10 viruses isolated
from different birds on farm no.13.
Based on the HA gene, genetic variations of H5N1 virus
were detected in different birds during the same farm outbreak or at different outbreak times (Table 3). On six
farms (farm no. 10, 11, 13, 30, 32 and 34) at least two
genetic variants were isolated on each farm, either in single or in repeated samplings, during HPAI outbreaks
occurring in relatively short time periods, whereas on two
farms (farm no. 4 and 9) different variants were detected
at 2-3 sampling occasions separated by 5-6 months.

Page 12 of 17

Although all of these farms were infected by clade 2.1.3
viruses, phylogenetic analysis showed that some of them
(farm no. 4, 9, 13, 32 and 34) were infected by two different virus clusters from groups II and III. These results
demonstrate that genetically distinct H5N1 viruses could
be isolated from the same farm in multiple, sometimes
simultaneous, infections. Conversely, the same genetic variants could be found in HPAI outbreaks on different
farms, indicating their wide dispersal.
The presence of multiple genetic variants on a single
farm may have resulted from mutations of existing
viruses or from introduction of new genetic variants.
Mutation was the probable cause of the findings on farm
no. 11 (Table 3). Identical HA virus variant was isolated
from 4 dead chickens on this farm at the 19 September
2007 outbreak, and a drift mutation was likely to have
occurred in this variant, which resulted in the substitution of amino acid (S217P) in one of the viruses isolated
from another dead chicken on the same farm three days
later, in 22 September 2007 (Table 3). In another case,
multiple H5N1 infections seemed to have happened on
farm no. 13 during HPAI outbreaks in September 2007.
This could be due to an introduction of different virus
variants through contact with HPAI infected birds of
other flocks during scavenging or through contact with
contaminated sources such as traders or farm visitors.
The progress of HPAI spread on some of these farms
could be determined by the patterns of HA protein
sequence of the related viruses. One of the viruses isolated
from a dead chicken on farm no. 32 (Ck/MG/662-762/07)
had identical HA sequence to viruses isolated from five
live ducks in a later HPAI outbreak on farm no. 13 (both
of these outbreaks occurred in September 2007 and were
located in the same village in Magelang district) (Table 3).
A similar incident of potential transmission of viral
variants between these two farms possibly also happened
where Ck/MG/662-763/07 (farm no. 32) possessed similar
HA sequences to Ck/MG/680-74X/07 (farm no. 13). In
farm no 17, identical HA amino acid sequences were
found amongst H5N1 viruses isolated from 3 live ducks in
15 January 2008 and those isolated from 3 dead chickens
in 22 January 2008 (data not shown). This suggests that
surviving ducks could maintain H5N1 virus at least one
week in this farm environment, which could lead subsequent HPAI outbreaks. Overall, characterization of HA
amino acid sequences showed that the majority of the
viruses in these farms possessed T, D and N at residues
86, 183 and 236, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, it is
possible that these viruses originated from the same
sources, then spread widely in the smallholder duck farms.
We attempted to determine if there was a relationship
between clinical outcome of infection and genetic variation. The majority of H5N1 viruses from ducks were isolated from live birds, whereas most chicken infections

were lethal, although our sequence analysis included two
virus isolates from live chickens and eight from dead
ducks. However, multiple protein alignments of the HA
gene showed that some viruses isolated from dead ducks
or live chickens had identical sequences with other
viruses isolated from live ducks or dead chickens (data
not shown). The HA phylogenetic analysis also revealed
that genetically similar virus could be isolated from birds
with different clinical presentations (live or dead). These
results indicate that there is no clear correlation between
genetic variations or phylogenetic groupings and the
pathogenicity of H5N1 virus in these species. This is
probably due to the fact that there are other factors that
influence pathogenicity.

Conclusions
In summary, clade 2.1.3 was the dominant circulating
H5N1 influenza virus in the smallholder duck farms in
central Java between March 2007 and March 2008.
Although all the viruses possessed HPAI molecular characteristics with multiple basic amino acids detected at the
HA cleavage site, there was no significant amino acid
mutations found in either HA or NA proteins, including
residues at receptor binding, glycosylation, antigenic and
catalytic sites and NA inhibitor targets. Based on the HA
gene, identical virus variants could be found at relatively
distant and separate geographic locations within the four
study districts. Furthermore, genetically distinct variants
could be isolated from either chickens or ducks on the
same farm at the same time, suggesting that a range of
variant viruses can circulate simultaneously within a short
period during HPAI outbreaks. Based on the antigenic
analysis, there was no evidence of major antigenic variants
circulating in these farms during the study period.
The higher proportion of H5 virus isolations from live
ducks compared to live chickens suggests that ducks are
more resistant to AI virus infection. Some of the viruses in
this study were isolated from dead ducks, but there was no
clear association of genetic variations with pathogenicity.
Whether ducks play a role in the maintenance of Indonesian H5N1 lineage viruses is still unresolved. Therefore,
further studies are necessary to investigate other related
factors determining pathogenicity in live birds as well as
understanding the potential of ducks in maintaining virus
infection over long periods.
