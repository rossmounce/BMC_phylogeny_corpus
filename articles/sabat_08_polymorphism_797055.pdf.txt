Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus expresses several proteases, which are thought to contribute
to the virulence of this bacterium. Here we focus on aureolysin, the major thermolysin-like
metalloprotease. Despite the importance of aureolysin in the physiology and pathogenesis of S.
aureus, relatively little information was so far available concerning the aur gene diversity and
mobility within and between the major subdivisions of the S. aureus population. Therefore, an
epidemiologically and genetically diverse collection of S. aureus strains was used to determine the
range of aureolysin (aur) gene polymorphism.
Results: Sequence analyses support the conclusion that the aur gene occurs in two distinct types
of related sequences. The aur gene was much more polymorphic but, at the same time, showed
higher purifying selection than genes utilized for multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Gene trees
constructed from aur and concatenated MLST genes revealed several putative assortative
recombination events (i.e. entire aur gene exchanges) between divergent lineages of S. aureus.
Evidence for intragenic recombination events (i.e. exchanges of internal aur segments) across aur
genes was also found. The biochemical properties and substrate specificity of the two types of
aureolysin purified to homogeneity were studied, revealing minor differences in their affinity to low
molecular weight synthetic substrates.
Conclusion: Although numerous nucleotide differences were identified between the aur alleles
studied, our findings showed that a strong purifying selection is acting on the aur gene. Moreover,
our study distinguishes between homologous exchanges of the entire aur gene (assortative
recombination) between divergent S. aureus lineages and recombination events within aur genes.

Background
Proteases are important virulence factors for a variety of
microbial pathogens and may contribute to tissue degradation and resistance to the host defense system. Staphylococcus aureus secretes a typical metalloprotease that is
commonly referred to as aureolysin. This enzyme, which
is a member of the thermolysin family of zinc-dependent
metalloproteases, comprises a single chain of 301 amino
acids that consists of a β-pleated N-terminal domain and
an α-helical C-terminal domain [1]. In vitro, aureolysin
activates prothrombin showing pseudocoagulase activity
[2] and inactivates mammalian plasma protease inhibitors by cleavage [3,4]. Moreover, the enzyme has been
suggested to contribute to the resistance of S. aureus to the
innate immune system by degradation of the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 [5] and inhibitory activity against
immunoglobulin production by lymphocytes [6]. In addition, aureolysin is required for activation of a serine protease (SspA; also named V8 protease) secreted by the same
microorganism [7-9]. Recently, Beaufort and colleagues
[10] reported that aureolysin is capable of converting the
zymogen pro-urokinase into its active form. Urokinase, in
turn, is a component of the plasminogen activation system. Upon activation, plasmin displays enzymatic activity
towards a number of substrates, including fibrin. Therefore, aureolysin may contribute to activation of the host's
fibrinolytic system by S. aureus, and thus promote bacterial spread and invasion. Nevertheless, in a mouse model
of septic arthritis, inactivation of aur gene did not affect
the frequency or the severity of joint disease [11].
In our previous study, we cloned the aureolysin gene and
proposed the name aur [12]. Sequence analysis revealed a
coding sequence (CDS) of 1,527 nucleotides, starting
with a GTG codon with the potential of encoding the
aureolysin preproenzyme of 509 amino acids. The nascent translation product of the aur gene included an N-terminal signal peptide (prefragment) of 27 amino acids
with a typical signal peptidase cleavage site, followed by a
profragment and a mature protease composed of 181 and
301 residues, respectively. We showed the presence of the
aur gene in all investigated community-acquired as well as
laboratory strains [12]. PCR-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the aur gene
revealed only two RFLP types [12]. Sequencing of the aur
gene from two representative strains of each of those two
PCR-RFLP types confirmed that the gene occurred in two
forms (type I and type II). Deduced amino acid sequences
of aureolysin were almost identical within a type, whereas
the sequence identity between the two types of genes was
only 89%. The strong conservation of aur among two
types of related sequences argues in favor of the possibility
that aureolysin has important housekeeping functions.

Introduction of the multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
method [13], which measures sequence variation at seven
slowly evolving housekeeping genes, has resulted in a
detailed understanding of S. aureus population structure.
The evolution of S. aureus may have been influenced by
chromosomal replacements [14]. Nevertheless, the MLST
data have revealed a predominantly clonal evolution of
this species and its subdivision into two fundamental
groups (supergroups) consisting of multiple clonal complexes [15]. Although MLST has been primarily developed
as a typing approach, it has also been used successfully for
examining the degree to which homologous recombination has occurred within the S. aureus genome [14,16].
Our previous study, which focused on aureolysin [12],
was conducted shortly before the MLST era. At the time, it
was felt that the presence of only two types of aur genes
could reflect the existence of two supergroups of S. aureus
strains. However, a real degree of polymorphism of the
aur gene could not be determined previously, since we
used only local strains and therefore a very limited
number of genotypes. In the current study, we have therefore focused attention on the genetic analysis of the aur
gene to determine its diversity and the extent to which it
was mobile within and between the major population
subdivisions. For this purpose, we have used epidemiologically and genetically diverse strains of S. aureus. Additionally, we performed biochemical studies on
aureolysins of type I and type II to determine their properties such as enzymatic specificity and activity.

Methods
Bacterial strains
For aur sequencing, a group of 24 methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA) and 42 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) epidemiologically unrelated strains was selected
from different collections of S. aureus strains [22,23].
Strain selection was based on preliminary MLST data and
was intended to include strains with a large degree of
diversity. Strains were derived from a variety of human
infections as well as from nasal swabs of asymptomatic
carriers. Their geographic origins included mainly European countries but also the first three vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strains, MI-VRSA (strain VRS1,
HIP11714), PA-VRSA (strain VRS2, HIP11983) and NYVRSA (strain VRS3, HIP13170), recovered in the United
States were included in this study. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients and participants which were
involved in our study. All procedures were performed
according to guidelines of the local ethics committees
which are in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
All strains were coded to protect patients and participants
confidentiality. Additionally, thirteen S. aureus strains for
which the genome sequences are available on the NCBI

website (see Availability and requirements section for
URL) were analyzed.
For studying biochemical properties of the two types of
aureolysin, strains V8-BC10 (type I) and the sarA and sspA
double mutant of 8325-4 (type II) (obtained from Dr S.O.
Arvidson, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm [8], and Dr S.
Foster, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK, respectively
[11]) were used.
MLST
MLST was performed according to protocol developed by
Enright et al. [13]. Sequences of each locus were compared
to the data in the S. aureus MLST database (see Availability
and requirements section for URL), and resulting allelic
profiles were assigned to particular sequence types (STs)
for each strain. Sequences of unknown alleles and the
allelic profiles of novel STs were submitted to the MLST
database curator for allele or ST number assignment.
BURST software (see Availability and requirements section for URL) was used to classify related STs into clonal
complexes (CCs) of phylogenetic relationships. Such clusters were composed of two or more STs which differed at
a single locus (single-locus variants) or two loci (doublelocus variants) [15]. A singleton was defined as a sequence
type that is not grouped into a clonal complex.
Sequence analysis of aur genes
PCR products were used as the templates for sequencing
reactions. These templates covering the whole aur gene
were generated by use of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) (Cycling conditions:
denaturation, 94°C/30 s; annealing, 55°C/30 s; elongation, 72°C/30 s) with primer pairs aur-F1 (5'-GCTGTTTTTAARATTTCAGGAGG)
and
aur-R1
(5'TGAAATTTCTGGTGTYACTGTAATTAA),
aur-F2
(5'GAAATCGATGGTGACAGTAATAA) and aur-R2 (5'CTACGTCATTTGCACCYGATAA), and aur-F3 (5'GACAAAATGATYTATGGTGATGG) and aur-R3 (5'GTGTTTAACATTACTTCTTCTTGTTT). The same primers
were used for the sequence reactions.
Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using ClustalW (see
Availability and requirements section for URL) software.
Nucleotide diversity was calculated using the DnaSP package, version 4.10 [24]. The proportion of synonymous
(silent; ds) and non-synonymous (amino acid-changing;
dn) substitution rates was calculated using the software
SNAP (see Availability and requirements section for URL).
If purifying selection has occurred, a gene has a ds/dn ratio
> 1. Absence of selection should generate ds = dn. A value
< 1 indicates diversifying selection or accelerated evolution. Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were constructed using
the program Mega version 3.1 [25]. Genetic distances

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/129

were calculated by the Kimura two-parameter model.
Bootstrap analysis (1000 repeats) was performed to evaluate the topology of the phylogenetic tree. Recombinant
aur sequences were detected employing the RDP-V2 Beta
08 software [26] using six automated recombination
detection methods including RDP [27], Geneconv [28],
Bootscanning [29], Maximum Chi Square (MaxChi) [30],
Chimaera [31], and Sister Scanning (SiScan) [32]. Results
were then checked by visual inspection. Amino acid
sequences were edited in Genedoc software (version
2.6.02) [33].
Purification of aureolysins
S. aureus V8-BC10 and the sarA and sspA double mutant of
8325-4 were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (Fluka Chemie
AG, Buchs, Switzerland), supplemented with erythromycin 10 mg l-1 and neomycin 50 mg l-1 in case of the latter
strain, for 15 h at 37°C. Proteins from clarified culture fluids were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), recovered by centrifugation (15 000 g, 1 h, 4°C),
dialyzed against 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 supplemented
with 10 mM CaCl2 (buffer A), and loaded onto Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were
eluted from the column using increasing NaCl linear gradient in buffer A, and fractions exhibiting EDTA-sensitive
proteolytic activity were pooled. The above procedure
resulted in an electrophoreticaly homogenous protein. Nterminal protein sequence analysis was performed at BioCentrum Ltd. (Krakow, Poland)
Comparison of biochemical properties of aureolysins
Specific activity of enzymes was determined by α-2-macroglobulin (α-2 M) (BioCentrum Ltd.) titration. Constant
amounts of enzymes (0.02 nmol) were incubated with
increasing amounts of α-2 M for 1 h, at room temperature.
Then, high molecular weight protein substrate (Hide
Power Azure, Calbiochem) was added and residual
enzyme activity was measured as an increase of absorbance at 595 nm after 30 min incubation at 37°C. It was
assumed that one molecule of α-2 M inhibits two molecules of aureolysin. For kinetic studies low molecular
weight synthetic substrates, Fa-Gly-Ala-NH2, Fa-Gly-ValNH2, Fa-Gly-Phe-NH2 and Fa-Gly-Leu-NH2, (Bachem,
Switzerland), were used. The kinetic constants were determined from the initial rates of hydrolysis by the
Lineweaver-Burk method, based on triplicate rate determinations at five substrate concentrations in the range of
0.1–5 mM. Galanin digestion was performed by incubation of the substrate with the enzymes in 2000:1 molar
ratio for 5 min, 37°C, and nano-LC-MS/MS analysis of the
obtained products were done at Faculty of Chemistry and
Regional Laboratory, Jagiellonian University, as describe
elsewhere [34]. To compare degradation patterns of proteins by aureolysins, α-1-antitrypsin, α-1-antichymotrypsin (both from BioCentrum), collagen, beta casein

(both from Sigma), HMWK and LMWK, were incubated
with the same amounts of active aureolysins of type I and
type II at the molar ratio from 5:1 to 200:1 for the time
ranging from 5 min to 12 hours. Then, EDTA was added
and reaction mixtures were subjected to high throughput
electrophoresis [35].

Results

grouped into nine CCs, while the remaining twelve STs
that comprised 14 strains were singletons. Sequences of
seven MLST housekeeping genes were concatenated to further examine the relationship between the sequence type
and the aur allele. The resulting gene tree (Figure 1A) was
consistent with the one reported previously and supports
the division of S. aureus strains into two fundamental
groups (supergroups I and II) which comprise multiple
clonal complexes [15]. Supergroups reflect the evolutionary relationships among the strains of S. aureus and are
concordant to subspecies groups distinguished by Robinson and colleagues [17] and two main groups developed
by Cooper and Feil [18].

Clustering of S. aureus strains by MLST
A total of 79 strains revealed 48 different sequence types
(STs) on the basis of the MLST data (Table 1). On the basis
of BURST analysis, thirty six STs with 65 strains were

Phylogenetic trees based on (A) MLST, (B) entire aur genes and (C) shortened aur sequences. Phylogenetic trees for 50 S. aureus strains
were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter model with MEGA 3.1. All branch lengths are drawn to scale.
Bootstrap values were calculated for 1,000 replicates and are given for each branch. Strains used represent all combinations of STs and aur alleles. Each
strain is abbreviated with the isolate designation, followed by the MLST (ST) designation in panel A, and the aur allele designation in panel B. CCs and
supergroups are indicated in panel A. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping gene sequences placed strains in groups which corresponded to CCs
(Table 1) identified by the BURST analysis with the exception of the ST188 strains which were sorted as unique (panel A). The Supergroup is based on a
reconstruction of S. aureus phylogeny conducted in this study and those presented previously [17,18].

indicates that the strain may differ by at least three MLST genes from other strains recorded in the MLST database as of January 2008.
vancomycin-resistant MRSA
c RF122 was the only strain of animal origin analyzed in this study and was isolated from bovine mastitis
b VRSA,

the NCBI website ((see Availability and requirements section for URL), 6 January 2008) (strains 8325, Newman,
COL, MRSA252, MSSA476, MW2, Mu3, Mu50, N315,
USA300, RF122, JH1, and JH9). Sequence analysis of the
aur gene confirmed that all investigated MRSA and MSSA
strains possessed the aur gene of the same length of 1530
bp. Deletion or insertion events as well as truncation of
the aureolysin protein by introduction of an early termination codon were not found. The phylogenetic relationships of the aur sequences are shown in Figure 1B. We
found twenty four nucleotide alleles of the aur gene (Table
2) which translated to 15 amino acid sequences (Figure
2). Sequencing analysis supports our conclusion [12] that
the aur gene occurs in two distinct groups (type I and type
II) of related sequences. However, we found a greater
diversity of alleles than reported previously [12]. This was
not unexpected due to a much more diverse strain collection. There were 195 (12.7%) polymorphic nucleotide
sites, which resulted in 43 (8.4%) variable inferred amino
acid positions. Type I consisted of 9 nucleotide alleles
which translated to 6 amino acid sequences, and type II
consisted of 15 nucleotide alleles which translated to 9
amino acid sequences. Pairwise differences in nucleotide
sequences between representative pairs of alleles ranged
from 1 to 40 (0.1–2.6%) nucleotide sites within type I,
and from 1 to 13 (0.1–0.8%) nucleotide sites within type
II, whereas between the types the differences ranged from
146 to 170 nucleotide sites (9.5–11.1%). The deduced
amino acid diversity of preproaureolysin varied from 1 to
6 (0.2–1.2%) amino acid positions within type I, and
from 1 to 4 (0.2–0.8%) amino acid positions within type
II, whereas between types the difference was from 31 to 38
(6.1–7.5%) amino acid positions.

Molecular evolution
Data reporting numbers of alleles for all genes are summarized in Table 2. We found that the aur gene was much
more polymorphic than the housekeeping genes. The
nucleotide diversity value for the aur gene was 0.0554 and
about five times greater than those for MLST housekeeping genes, ranging from 0.0074 to 0.0146 (mean =
0.0103). This implies that the aur gene was evolving at a
higher rate than the MLST housekeeping genes (Table 2).
However particular fragments of the aur gene showed different values of diversity. The most polymorphic was the
profragment (0.0711) and the least polymorphic was the
fragment encoding the mature protein (0.0459); by comparison, the prefragment showed a value (0.0556), which
is almost identical to that of the whole gene.

Most polymorphisms led to synonymous substitutions
indicating a role of an environmental purifying selection
in the evolution. The strength of purifying selection,
expressed as the ds/dn ratio, showed a clear difference
between the MLST housekeeping genes, between 6.34 and
10.50 (mean ds/dn = 7.50) and the aur gene, ds/dn = 17.56.
Thus, there was a higher purifying selection in the aur
gene; however particular regions of the gene showed different purifying strengths. The highest value was observed
for the region encoding the mature enzyme, ds/dn = 27.05.
The purifying selection for the region encoding the profragment was also higher, ds/dn = 14.88, than those for the
MLST housekeeping genes and values were between those
for the mature protein and the MLST genes. The (pre)fragment coding for the signal peptide had a value, ds/dn =
5.49, which was similar to those for the MLST genes.

Evidence for homologous exchange of the entire aur gene
(assortative recombination) between the supergroups
Homologous exchange of the aur gene between the supergroups leads to the presence of aur alleles of the same type
in strains from both supergroups. In general, strains of
supergroup I and II had aur of type I and type II, respectively. However, there were also some exceptions, which
indicated the transfer of the aur gene. For aur of type I
(alleles aur16 through aur24), the allele aur21 was found
in a strain belonging to ST848 which in turn belonged to
complex CC1. The allele aur22 was found in strains of
ST157, ST241, and ST239 which were a part of CC8; the
allele aur23 was found in the ST501 strain which was a
member of CC8. Strains of clonal complexes CC1 and
CC8 were representatives of the MLST supergroup II. For
aur of type II (alleles aur1 through aur15), the alleles aur8,
aur9, aur10, and aur15 were found in strains of ST123,
ST151, ST182, and ST59, respectively, which were singletons and representatives of the MLST supergroup I.
Evidence for homologous exchange of the entire aur gene
(assortative recombination) within a supergroup
To examine the possibility of homologous exchange
within a supergroup, we determined genetic variability of
the aur gene within a sequence type and a clonal complex.
We excluded from the analysis those strains for which we
proved the aur transfer between the supergroups (strains
of ST848, ST157, ST241, ST239, ST501, ST123, ST151,
ST182, and ST59). Strains of the same ST usually possessed an identical aur allele with the exception of ST1
(aur6 and aur7) and ST5 (aur3 and aur4); however, their
aur alleles differed by only a single nucleotide. With the
exception of CC1 and CC101, strains of a given MLST
clonal complex possessed their own aur alleles. In general,
within a clonal complex, aur alleles were either identical
(CC8, CC101, CC15, CC7, CC45) or showed little variation differing by a single nucleotide (CC1, aur6 and aur7;
CC5, aur3 and aur4, and aur3 and aur5; CC22, aur16 and
aur17) or by two nucleotides (CC5, aur4 and aur5). The
aur alleles of different CCs differed by 14 to 38 nucle-

otides in supergroup I, and 4 to 13 nucleotides in supergroup II. Therefore, STs within a clonal complex should
have identical aur alleles or alleles differing by up to two
nucleotides whereas those aur alleles in strains of STs
which are not related by MLST should differ between each
other by at least 4 nucleotides. Using these rules, we
detected a single event of homologous exchange within
the supergroup I and numerous events of such transfer
within the supergroup II. Exceptional cases of variation
greater than two nucleotides of difference between the aur
alleles within a clonal complex were found in CC1 (supergroup II) and CC30 (supergroup I). In these two clonal
complexes almost all STs had an identical aur allele within
a given clonal complex (CC1, aur6; and CC30, aur24).
However, ST188 (CC1) and ST34 (CC30) which possessed the allele aur13 and aur19, respectively, differed
substantially by 6 nucleotides from the allele aur6 and 16
nucleotides from the allele aur24. In supergroup II, several
STs not related by MLST had an identical aur allele or
closely related aur alleles (differing by a single nucleotide). Strains of ST842, ST843, ST9, ST20 and CC8 possessed the allele aur1. Strains of CC101, ST89 and almost
all CC1 possessed the allele aur6 and strain 3502 (ST1)
had aur7; ST151 and ST182 possessed alleles aur9 and
aur10, respectively and ST188 and CC7 possessed alleles
aur13 and aur14, respectively.
Evidence for mosaic structure among the aur alleles
Intragenic recombination events which result in a formation of linked runs of nucleotides within a sequence,
whose ancestry is different from other nucleotides in the
same sequence [19], are responsible for the mosaic structure of the sequence. In other words, a putative recombinant aur gene should consist of the DNA sequence
stretches of both types of aureolysin. There was evidence
of mosaicism within the aur alleles of type I for strains of
ST22 (aur16), ST839 (aur17), and ST846 (aur18). Locations of breakpoints that represent end points of recombinant segments were found for alleles aur16 and aur17
pointing to recombination regions between nucleotides

279 and 324 and between 632 and 813, whereas for the
allele aur18 data point to a region from nucleotides 306 to
324 (Figure 3).
After excision of the recombinant segments (228 nucleotides in total) from all aur sequences, the resulting 1302
bp fragments were compared. Pairwise differences in
nucleotide sequences between representative pairs of
shortened alleles ranged from 1 to 16 (1 to 40 for the
whole gene) nucleotide sites within type I, and from 1 to
12 (1–13 for whole gene) nucleotide sites within type II.
Therefore, after removal of the recombinant sequences,
the polymorphism was substantially lower within type I,
whereas within type II it was almost the same.
Very high congruence in topology was observed between
phylogenetic trees based on the whole aur and shortened
aur sequences (Figures 1B and 1C). This indicates that
intragenic recombination had little effect on this gene.
The only substantial differences were found for the branch
lengths of recombinant aur alleles (aur16, aur17, and
aur18).
Biochemical comparison of two types of aureolysin
Purification to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography
yielded 5 and 7 mg per liter culture for aureolysin of type
I and type II, respectively. Enzyme titration with human α2-macroglobulin showed 60% and 45% specific activity
for types I and II, respectively, and this trend was observed
in each preparation. N-terminal sequencing of the purified proteins revealed the AAATGT sequence for type I of
the enzyme and an equimolar mixture of AAETGK and
GKGVLG sequences for the type II (Figure 2). The latter
sequences corresponded to putatively, properly processed
and 6-amino acid truncated mature forms of aureolysin of
type II, respectively.

A set of low molecular weight synthetic substrates differing at the C-terminus was used to compare the substrate
specificity of both types of aureolysin. Fa-Gly-Ala-NH2
and Fa-Gly-Val-NH2 were barely hydrolyzed by the
enzymes. By contrast, Fa-Gly-Phe-NH2 and Fa-Gly-LeuNH2 were more susceptible to hydrolysis. Hence, basic
kinetic studies were performed. Both enzymes exhibited
almost identical KM and kcat/KM values for Fa-Gly-PheNH2. Similar data were acquired for Fa-Gly-Leu-NH2;
however aureolysin of type I showed a slightly higher substrate affinity (4.4*10-4 vs. 1.9*10-3 M for type II). It is also
worth noticing that Fa-Gly-Phe-NH2 is a better substrate
than Fa-Gly-Leu-NH2 for both types of enzymes.
To confirm previous observations on substrate specificity,
the synthetic substrate, galanin (29 amino acids), was
used to test the substrate specificity of aureolysins. After 5
minutes incubation with the enzymes no differences in
hydrolysis patterns were observed. Galanin, possessing
the sequence: GWT|LNS|AG|Y|L|LGPHAIDNHRS|FHDKYG|LA-NH2, was digested (in places marked by |) at the
N-terminal side of leucine, alanine, tyrosine and phenylalanine residues but not glycine, indicating that both types
of aureolysin preferentially cleave peptide bonds before
large hydrophobic amino acids. Additionally, selected
proteins were incubated with both types of aureolysin and
subjected to electrophoresis. In our hands no differences
in the digestion patterns of β-casein, human low and high
molecular weight kininogen, and human blood serpins,
α-1-antitrypsin
and
α-1-antichymotrypsin,
were
observed. Moreover, aureolysin of type I alike type II had
no proteolytic activity against elastin and type I collagen.

Discussion
The value obtained for nucleotide diversity of aur
(0.0554) revealed a high degree of gene polymorphism
and was comparable to values obtained by Kuhn et al. [16]
for core adhesion genes (mean = 0.077 ± 0.046) as well as
accessory adhesion genes (mean = 0.088 ± 0.063). However, in contrast to findings by Kuhn et al. [16] that housekeeping and adhesion genes showed similar levels of
purifying selection, our data revealed that the aur gene
was subject to stronger purifying selection than the MLST
genes. Furthermore, the least diversity and highest purifying selection of the gene fragment encoding the mature
enzyme in comparison to the sequences coding for preand pro-fragment strongly suggest that proper enzymatic
activity and specificity of aureolysin is very important in
the processing of other staphylococcal proteins. Moreover, Beaufort and colleagues [10] recently reported that
aureolysin can also be a highly specialized virulence factor. By precise proteolytic cleavage aureolysin activates the
human fibrinolytic system, enabling S. aureus spread and
invasion.

Although S. aureus is predominantly clonal, events of
homologous exchange can occur and may play an important role in the evolution of S. aureus clones. Our results
provide evidence for genetic exchange of the aur locus
between unrelated strains of both supergroups and different clonal complexes. Kuhn and colleagues [16] previously showed high congruence between the gene trees
constructed from concatenated sequences of MLST housekeeping, core adhesion (clfA, clfB, fnbA, map, sdrC, and
spa), and accessory adhesion genes (ebpS, fnbB, sdrD, and
sdrE), indicating that recombination had little effect on
the population structure. However, when they investigated each gene separately, some evidence for homologous exchange was found. The best congruence between
trees was observed with clfA and the least was observed
with clfB. The aur locus is located close to the clfB locus (7
kb apart in all sequenced genomes). S. aureus is predominantly a clonal species, but some of its genomic regions
show higher recombination rates and, based on the previous report of Kuhn and co-workers [16], we can infer that
the aur locus is located in such a region, since it is located
in the close vicinity of the clfB locus.
The restriction-modification (R-M) systems serve in phage
defense as well as the stringent control in foreign DNA
acquisition. Therefore, R-M systems are modulators of the
frequency of genetic variation. Waldron and Lindsay [20]
proposed that the Sau1 type I R-M system is the major
mechanism for blocking gene transfer into S. aureus isolates from other species, as well as between isolates of different S. aureus lineages. Moreover, Sung and Lindsay [21]
concluded that there are certain S. aureus lineages and
strains possessing deficiencies in the dominant R-M what
in turn leads to a hyperrecipient phenotype. They found
naturally occurring hyperrecipient strains and the best
example of this phenomenon was the bovine lineage
ST151. Our analysis demonstrated that among the strains
for which we found homologous transfer of the aur gene
was also a strain of ST151. We can only hypothesize now
that the same genetic mechanisms could play a role in
exchange of the aur locus between the strains of other lineages.
Our analysis of the aur gene is esentially descriptive; however, the impact of the findings should be beneficial in
designing future molecular tests. In our laboratory, based
on knowledge about polymorphism of the aur gene, two
rapid approaches are under construction for determination of the dominant S. aureus lineages and for species
identification of the genus Staphylococcus. Currently, routine determination of S. aureus lineages is conducted by
sequence-based typing methods (spa typing and MLST)
or/and PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) which are
time consuming and expensive. A new typing method will
be based on restriction profile analysis of the aur gene by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/129

digestion with a restriction enzyme. However, there is
confusion about the discriminatory power of a single
marker (some unrelated lineages of supergroup II possess
the same aur allele), therefore, another gene located in the
genome at least 1 Mb from the aur gene (to eliminate a
possibility that both genes took place in the same homologous exchange) will be chosen and investigated in detail.
A new duplex PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism) method will be a substantial support for
currently used typing methods in epidemiological studies.
Another molecular approach developing in our laboratory is single-tube multiplex-PCR for the simultaneous
detection and discrimination of Staphylococcus species. For
this purpose, genes encoding metalloproteinases from the
thermolysin family are investigated. These genes are conserved among strains of given species and are unique compared to other species of the genus Staphylococcus. Primer
pairs will be designed to yield single species-specific in
size amplification products. Therefore, to design an efficient diagnostic test for Stahylococcus species identification, a very detailed knowledge about polymorphisms of
the aur and aur-like genes is needed.

Conclusion
In this paper we provide evidence that homologous
recombination contributed to the evolution of the aur
gene. Our study distinguishes between homologous
exchanges of the entire aur gene (assortative recombination) between divergent lineages of S. aureus and recombination events within the aur gene. Despite the aur gene
being highly polymorphic, purifying selection leads to
limited variation of aureolysin at the amino acid level.
Accordingly, purifying selection may provide only for
small phenotypic differences and should not be a mechanism for isolating bacterial populations. Indeed, although
we were able to detect minor differences in affinity of the
proteases to low molecular weight synthetic substrates, no
detectable dissimilarities in protein digestion pattern were
observed. Mature forms of aureolysins whose biochemical
properties were compared differed in 9 amino acid residues. Such a high degree of sequence similarity may mean
overall structure identity, which in turn reflects no differences in protein digestion efficiency. However, keeping in
mind the observed minor differences in the enzymatic
properties against low molecular weight substrates, we
cannot exclude a role for aureolysin in interactions with
yet undefined proteins where two variants of this protease
may act differently.
