Abstract
Background: DNA barcoding of life using a standardized COI sequence was proposed as a species
identification system, and as a method for detecting putative new species. Previous tests in birds
showed that individuals can be correctly assigned to species in ~94% of the cases and suggested a
threshold of 10× mean intraspecific difference to detect potential new species. However, these
tests were criticized because they were based on a single maternally inherited gene rather than
multiple nuclear genes, did not compare phylogenetically identified sister species, and thus likely
overestimated the efficacy of DNA barcodes in identifying species.
Results: To test the efficacy of DNA barcodes we compared ~650 bp of COI in 60 sister-species
pairs identified in multigene phylogenies from 10 orders of birds. In all pairs, individuals of each
species were monophyletic in a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree, and each species possessed fixed
mutational differences distinguishing them from their sister species. Consequently, individuals were
correctly assigned to species using a statistical coalescent framework. A coalescent test of
taxonomic distinctiveness based on chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly in two lineages
was verified in known sister species, and used to identify recently separated lineages that represent
putative species. This approach avoids the use of a universal distance cutoff which is invalidated by
variation in times to common ancestry of sister species and in rates of evolution.
Conclusion: Closely related sister species of birds can be identified reliably by barcodes of fixed
diagnostic substitutions in COI sequences, verifying coalescent-based statistical tests of reciprocal
monophyly for taxonomic distinctiveness. Contrary to recent criticisms, a single DNA barcode is
a rapid way to discover monophyletic lineages within a metapopulation that might represent
undiscovered cryptic species, as envisaged in the unified species concept. This identifies a smaller
set of lineages that can also be tested independently for species status with multiple nuclear gene
approaches and other phenotypic characters.

Background
Large scale sequencing of a predefined region of approximately 650 (base pairs) bp of the mitochondrial gene
COI, known as DNA barcoding, has two main goals: 1) to

develop a species identification system that also allows
unknown individuals to be assigned to species; 2) and to
enhance the discovery of new species [1-3]. Although
DNA barcoding has proved effective in achieving both

goals in several large groups of animals [4-11], the efficacy
of the tests have been questioned [12-16].

required for inferences to be made about taxonomic distinctiveness from observations of monophyly [19].

A major test performed on 643 previously recognized species of birds of North America demonstrated the effectiveness of DNA barcoding because 94% possessed unique
monophyletic COI clusters [10,11]. The remaining 6% of
the species did not have unique DNA barcodes, indicating
that they either were (a) wrongly identified in the past as
separate species, (b) closely related species that hybridize
regularly, or (c) species losing identity by secondary contact [11]. These groups may be in the indeterminate zone
between differentiated populations and distinct species
[10,11]. Critics of DNA barcoding claim that in spite of
the impressive number of bird species sampled [11], the
precision of the method was compromised due to insufficient intraspecific sampling, and because comparisons
among species were not exclusively from sister-species
pairs [12,15,17], where taxonomic uncertainty, interspecific hybridization, and incomplete lineage sorting could
decrease the effectiveness of the test [12]. The suggested
threshold of 10 times the mean intraspecific variation (10
× rule) to screen for splits referred to as 'putative' species
[11] has also been criticized. Moritz and Cicero [12]
reported significantly lower average mitochondrial DNA
distances between sister species of birds than levels
reported in the barcoding tests of birds [10,11], although
the distances from these sister-species comparisons came
from a variety of methods and genes [7]. Meyer and
Paulay [13] tested different threshold methods in COI
barcodes of cowries and found extensive overlap of overall intraspecific distances with interspecific distances,
resulting in minimum error rates of ~17% to screen for
putative new species. Additionally, a simulation study
using the neutral coalescent and the BatesonDobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model of speciation suggested that mtDNA barcodes will have error rates lower
than 10% in assigning individuals to species only when
populations have been isolated for more than 4 million
generations [15]. A universal-distance cutoff is therefore
not an objective criterion to delineate species limits [18].

Some of the advantages of using a single mtDNA barcode
to identify species are that it has a higher rate of evolution
(and thus more mutations), and because matrilineal lineages sort into reciprocally monophyletic clades much
faster than nuclear genes [20]. This reduces the incidence
of incompletely sorted lineages relative to that expected
with nuclear genes. However, recent simulations with
multiple nuclear genes indicate that very recently derived
species can be identified well before the time to reciprocal
monophyly [21]. Additionally, species were correctly
delimited in <50% of replicates simulating mtDNA
sequences, suggesting that the single gene barcode
approach was insufficient to delimit recently diverged species.

Additionally, Hickerson et al. [15] argued that reciprocal
monophyly of mtDNA sequences and the 10 × threshold
will likely underestimate species diversity [15]. Tree-based
approaches with genetic distances that use reciprocal
monophyly for species delimitation can be problematic
because aggregations of haplotypes in phylogenetic trees,
even when highly supported, do not necessarily imply
that they belong to a distinctive taxonomic unit [19]. To
address these issues, Rosenberg [19] proposed a statistical
test to test if monophyletic groups in a phylogenetic tree
are more likely to represent distinctive taxonomical entities, or are just random branches of lineages within a species. This approach also suggests minimal sample sizes

In response to the above criticisms we initiated a more
comprehensive study of 60 sister-species pairs of birds
defined rigorously with multigene phylogenies to determine whether mtDNA barcodes can reliably distinguish
closely related sister species. Instead of the much criticized
10× rule, which may not apply in recently diverged sisterspecies pairs, we use coalescent-based statistical tests for
species distinctiveness under reciprocal monophyly [19].
Additionally, we show that even recently diverged sisterspecies pairs have fixed nucleotide substitutions that serve
as diagnostic mtDNA barcodes envisioned in the original
analogy. Such diagnostic barcodes are useful not only in
quickly identifying known species of birds but also in flagging other recently derived evolutionary lineages that
could be analyzed with multilocus methods [21-23] to
determine if they represent emergent species.

Results
DNA barcodes distinguish sister-species of birds
Monophyletic clusters of individuals corresponding to
species were recovered in a Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree
under the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) model in all the sister-species pairs compared (Table 1, see Additional files 1,
2). Multiple diagnostic characters in the branches of the
trees leading to species clusters were detected in all the
pairs (see Additional file 1, Figure 1). Bootstrap support at
the nodes grouping individuals of the same species varied
from 55 to 100%, except for Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), with the majority of the values (93.1%)
above 85% (see Additional file 1). Species with clusters of
individuals supported with bootstrap levels below 85%
were: Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris),
Black-chinned Hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri),
Gunnison Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus minimus), Dusky
Grouse (Dendragapus obscurus), Nuttall's Woodpecker
(Picoides nuttallii), Jackass Penguin (Spheniscus demersus),
and Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). These

species were distinguished by <10 fixed nucleotide substitutional differences or had multiple intraspecific clusters.
Probabilities of chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly arising from random-branching within a single
taxon were smaller than the level of significance (α) of 5%
(Table 1). Ideally, larger sample sizes are required to
increase the power of the test and to confirm reciprocal
monophyly over a broad geographic range.
Individuals were correctly assigned to their corresponding
species
Individuals from the six species-pairs with adequate samples sizes were picked randomly to query whether they
could be assigned correctly to their species using clustering in a NJ tree, fixed mutations, and a statistical test of
assignment based on coalescent theory [24] (Table 2, Figure 2). In all the cases the query individual was correctly
assigned to species with posterior probability of 1.0 and
correspondingly tiny risk of misassignment (Table 2, Figure 2). When species barcodes were comprised of more
than one intraspecific cluster, as in Southern Brown Kiwi

(Apteryx australis, Figure 2A), Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica) and Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua), the
query individual was assigned correctly to the each
intraspecific cluster (Table 2).
Species level delimitation with the "10 × rule"
Mean among sister-species distances of mtDNA barcodes
varied from 0.78% to 11.77%, with 20 out of 60 (28.6%)
distances smaller than the 2.7% threshold used to flag
potential new species of birds. Among-species distances
overlapped maximum within-species distances in 39 of 60
(65%) sister-species pairs. Excluding cases that are likely
to represent overlooked species based on other attributes,
the overlap was observed in 21 of 60 sister-species pairs
(35%, Figure 3A). However, COI sequences in several species were structured in NJ trees into clades that represent
geographically structured populations, recognized subspecies or possibly cryptic species (Table 3). The ratios of
among-species to within-species distances were above 1
except for western and eastern populations of Eastern

rates of evolution are variable. For example, shanks accumulate more mutations in COI than do terns and penguins per unit time (Figures 4, and 5A–C). Variation in
rates of evolution of COI in different clades of birds mitigates against a universal distance criterion for species recognition, in accordance with previous evidence from a
mitogenomic timescale for birds [26].
Intraspecific variation suggesting potential distinctive
taxonomical entities
Six species had distinctive intraspecific clusters with probabilities of chance reciprocal monophyly below a conservative level of α = 1%: Kittlitz's Murrelet (Brachyramphus
brevirostris), Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Gullbilled Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), Eastern Meadowlark
(Sturnella magna), Common Redshank (Tringa totanus),
and Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor, Table 3, Figure 6).
These groups represent recognized subspecies, populations occupying different geographical areas or distinct
morphotypes. DNA barcode sequences of Gelochelidon
nilotica comprised three intraspecific clusters in NJ trees
(Figure 6C, Table 3). Two of the groups had discontinuous beak size distributions (pers. obs.) that were thought
to represent Australian and Asian subspecies S. n. macrotarsa and S. n. affinis, respectively [27]. The other group
comprised reciprocally monophyletic lineages representing the subspecies S. n. groenvoldi (South America) and S.
n. vanrossemini (Russia), but they were poorly sampled (2
samples each) [28].

Using the test for chance reciprocal monophyly, the Little
Penguins of Australia and New Zealand, respectively, currently lumped into Eudyptula minor, are probably two species (Table 3). This conclusion is supported by a high
number of fixed differences in the DNA barcodes and in

multigene phylogenies [29] (Table 3, Figure 6A). Other
species are comprised of monophyletic groups that could
be taxonomically distinctive, although the probabilities of
chance reciprocal monophyly are between 1–5%. For
example, specimens of Australasian Pipit (Anthus novaeseelandiae) from New Zealand and Australia differ by 4.1%
in their barcodes, and Little Terns (Sterna albifrons) from
England and Australia differ by about 1%. However,
increased sampling of these species is required to properly
test whether they represent separate taxonomic entities.

Discussion
Effectiveness of single gene COI barcodes
Our study of 60 pairs of sister species from a broad range
of bird clades showed that closely related pairs could not
be distinguished using the 10× rule of among to within
species divergence, as predicted by critics of this criterion
[12,15]. Similarly, the suggested threshold genetic distance of 2.7% to flag potential species failed to detect
recently evolved sister species, and was further compromised by substantial variation in the rate of COI evolution
in different clades and short species divergence times.
However, all sister-species pairs were shown to possess
unique DNA barcodes by which they could be identified.
In particular, the COI sequences of even very closely
related sister species were found to have diagnostic combinations of 5–64 fixed substitutional differences that better fit the analogy of a short DNA barcode. Individuals
were correctly assigned to each sister species for which we
had moderate sample sizes (N ≥ 4) using different lines of
evidence: NJ clustering, diagnostic fixed substitutions,
and a decision-theoretic framework based on coalescent
theory implemented in Assigner [24]. The concern about
assigning taxonomically unknown specimens to an existing or new taxon is unlikely to be a serious problem in
birds, given the uniqueness of species barcodes and the
mature taxonomy of the clade.

Phylogroups of COI sequences representing within-species variation can potentially be confounded with recently
diverged sister species, so to objectively discriminate

between these two possibilities we applied a statistical test
of the null hypothesis that reciprocal monophyly has
arisen by random branching of lineages within a single
species. The null hypothesis could be rejected in all closely
related sister species (P < 0.05), verifying the power of the
test. In addition, putative new species were strongly supported by the distinctive signatures of >12 fixed substitutional differences and low probabilities of chance
reciprocal monophyly within a single species. For example, the barcodes of Little Penguins from Australia and
New Zealand, and of Gentoo Penguins from Macquarie
Island and the Falklands, provide strong inferences of separate lineages that may warrant species status for these
groups. The existence of separately evolving metapopulation lineages is the species delimitation criterion for a
recently proposed unified species concept [30], though
contingent properties such as phenetic, behavioural and
reproductive differences need to be assessed in future to
provide additional lines of evidence for or against species
status. This is not a weakness of a single mtDNA gene barcoding system as has been claimed [21], but rather is a
rapid way to discover monophyletic lineages within a
metapopulation that might represent undiscovered cryptic species. The barcoding approach used here can be
applied to other organismal groups where individuals of
the same species cluster in monophyletic clades despite
overlaps in within- and among-species variation [14].
However, will not be applicable in groups with no mitochondrial divergence observed between species pairs (ex.
[31]).
Single gene versus multilocus approaches for species
delimitation
One of the most cogent criticisms of single locus mtDNA
barcodes is that a pattern of reciprocal monophyly in
maternally inherited genes can also arise when female dispersal is very restricted, often contrasting with widespread
apparent panmixia of autosomal and paternally inherited
genes [32]. However, if sister species have diverged very
recently then sufficient time may not have passed for
enough mutations in a nuclear gene to have accumulated
to reliably track lineage splitting and resolve problems
with incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism. This
in turn can lead to erroneous inference of extensive gene
flow in autosomal genes if it is based on single gene trees.
In such situations use of multiple nuclear genes is increasingly being touted to help delimit species boundaries [2123]. Recent simulations in a coalescent-based approach
showed that species limits were delimited with high probability depending on the number of loci examined and
the timing of species divergence [21]. Ten loci were able to
reliably detect species with effective population sizes of
100,000 that diverged in a timeframe (31,000 generations
ago) when incomplete lineage sorting would be expected
to occur. Obviously, this multilocus approach is currently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/81

infeasible for the purpose of barcoding life on the planet,
but it will be invaluable for inferring species limits in very
recently separated species pairs where mtDNA barcodes
alone might not be definitive. The 60 previously identified sister-species pairs of birds we studied had unique
mtDNA barcodes that identified them, and each species
was characterized by fixed mutational differences that are
unlikely to be reduced substantially in number by
increased sampling of polymorphic sites. However, species in which well differentiated reciprocally monophyletic clades of COI haplotypes were detected would
seem to be fertile ground for further investigation with
independent multiple nuclear gene trees in a coalescent
framework. For example, the split between Australian and
New Zealand populations of Little Penguins was dated at
approximately 1.3 Mya using the neutral coalescent
method in IM [33], and a phylogenetic rate of COI evolution of 0.01354 substitutions/site/Myr [26]. Given a generation time of 6.5 years (based age of first breeding of 2.5
years and annual survival of breeding adults 80% [34] this
equates roughly to 200,000 generations, where incomplete lineage sorting of autosomal genes should be
reduced unless effective population size is very large [35].
The faster sorting of COI sequences might be an advantage
in identifying possible recent speciation events, and they
can be combined with nuclear gene sequences in IM to
estimate whether the divergence is due to isolation or if
gene flow has been ongoing. Thus we view DNA barcodes
as useful complements in multigene data sets that might
include more than one mtDNA gene [36], contrary to
recent criticisms of maternally inherited genes in species
delimitation.

Conclusion
We show that in a broad range of birds even closely
related sister species delimited with independent evidence
could be identified with mtDNA barcodes and diagnostic
substitutions using standard COI sequences. All pairs
were characterized by reciprocally monophyletic lineages,
and tests of the null hypothesis of random branching
within a single species were rejected. Thus in well studied
groups like birds, mtDNA barcodes are extremely effective
in identifying sister species. In species that are shown by
COI barcodes to be comprised of several divergent monophyletic lineages that might flag unrecognized species, it is
important to test these splits with multiple independent
gene trees in a coalescent framework to guard against the
alternative inference of population subdivision via
restricted female dispersal. Combination of multiple
genes including mtDNA barcodes should counter any
biases in species detection and the high variance in associated genetic processes [21].

Methods
Taxon sampling
To evaluate the performance of COI barcoding in detecting species boundaries of birds we analyzed sister-species
pairs defined rigorously by previous phylogenetic studies
(Table 1). We excluded species that were known to

hybridize to prevent confusion due to introgression, a
problem that plagues all methods of species delimitation.
In addition, we included species of birds with multiple
clusters that might represent unrecognized species. The
COI sequences generated and used in this work are deposited in the project "Royal Ontario Museum- Birds 1" in the

DNA extraction and sequencing
DNA was extracted from blood, muscle or liver by phenol,
chelex or a membrane purification procedure with glass
fiber filtration plates (Acroprep 96 Filter Plate- 1.0 μm
Glass, PALL Corporation [38]). PCR amplification of the
5' end of the COI gene were performed in a 12.5 μL reaction, with a buffer solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, and
160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) [39], 0.4 mM
dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 20–25 ng of DNA. Cycle conditions were 36
cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 50°C for 40s, and 72°C for 1 m,
with an initial denaturation of 94°C for 5 m and a final
extension at 72°C for 7 m. Bird universal primers used
were as follows: LTyr – TGTAAAAAGGWCTACAGCCTAACGC, (Oliver Haddrath, pers. comm.) and
COI907aH2
–
GTRGCNGAYGTRAARTATGCTCG,
(Rebecca Elbourne, pers. comm.) Amplified segments
were purified by excising bands from agarose gels and centrifuging each through a filter tip. Sequences were
obtained on an ABI3100 (Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturers' suggested protocols using the internal primers COIaRt (forward-AACAAACCACAAAGATATCGG, Oliver Haddrath, pers comm.) and COI748Ht
(reverse-TGGGARATAATTCCRAAGCCTGG), or alternatively LTyr (primer used in amplification) and COI745h2
(reverse-ACRTGNGAGATRATTCCRAANCCNG, Rebecca
Elbourne, pers. comm.). Sequences were checked for
ambiguities in Sequencher 4.1.2 (GeneCodes Corp., Ann
Arbor, Michigan) and the multiple alignments was performed in MacClade 4 [40].
Species delimitation with DNA barcodes
To check for reciprocal monophyly in sister-species with
DNA barcodes, a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed in PAUP 4.10b [41] with the Kimura 2 parameter
model (K2P). Statistical support was estimated with 1,000
bootstrap replicates in a heuristic search using stepwise
addition with 10 random additions of sequences.

Because compound diagnostic characters are a valuable
source of information to diagnose species [18] we filtered
variable characters for each sister-species pairs in PAUP
4.10b [41], and fixed substitutions were selected in MacClade 4 [40].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/81

The test for chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly
[19] was applied to the sister-species pairs with α = 5%.
We also performed this test on 'intraspecific' clusters of
individuals that might represent distinct taxonomical unities, and additional species from which the barcodes were
available in our database, or in public databases (Genbank, BOLD, see Table 3[42]). Additionally, as an example on Little Penguins, we used the non-equilibrium
coalescent approach implemented in the program IM,
where an ancestral population splits into two constantsized populations in the past and potentially exchange
migrants [43]. Modal values of the population mutation
parameter (θ), time of population divergence (tpop), time
to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and scaled
migration rate (M) were obtained from the posterior distributions of these parameters using a Monte Carlo
Markov Chain run for 12.26 million generations after a
burnin of 100,000 generations.
Assignment test
The correct assignment of individuals to species was performed in a decision-theoretic framework based on coalescent theory in Assigner [24]. The species selected had a
ratio of among-species:maximum within-species genetic
distances <10, and with N ≤ four individuals (Common
Goldeneye, Lincoln's Sparrow, Sandwich Tern, and Gentoo Penguin). The COI sequence of one randomly selected
individual was excluded from the matrix and used as the
query sequence. For each of the sister species of the pair
(target groups), the evolutionary parameter θ (twice the
product of the female effective population size and neutral mutation rate) with corresponding maximum likelihood was estimated from the data in FLUCTUATE [44].
These values were used to calculate the likelihood of each
of the target groups after re-including the query sequence
to be assigned in Assigner [24].
Distance and threshold estimation
Distances under the K2P model were calculated among
sister-species and within-species in MEGA 3.1 [45]. Complete deletion was used in each comparison, to keep the
number of base pairs equal in intra- and interspecific
comparisons. Because the precision of the mtDNA barcode relies on the expectation that within-species variation is lower than among-species variation [1], the mean
estimate of among species distances and the maximum
value of pairwise intraspecific distances were used in the
comparisons. The average level of intraspecific variation
estimated across 260 species of birds of North America
(0.27% of sequence divergence, yielding a threshold of
2.7% sequence divergence) [11] was used to test the efficacy of the 10 × rule in the sister-species pairs. To evaluate
how variation in rates of evolution of COI in different lineages of birds [26] affect distance comparisons at sisterspecies levels, we selected six clades of birds for which

divergence times have been estimated previously with
relaxed clock methods (terns [46], shanks [47], alcids
[48], penguins [49], and kiwis [50]). K2P distances of species pairs were plotted against divergence times, and COI
distances between sister species of Terns, Shanks and Penguins were mapped on the corresponding chronograms.
