Abstract
Background: Natural variation in protein output from translation in bacteria and archaea may be
an organism-specific property of the ribosome. This paper adopts a systems approach to model the
protein output as a measure of specific ribosome reactive properties in a ribosome-mediated
translation apparatus. We use the steady-state assumption to define a transition state complex for
the ribosome, coupled with mRNA, tRNA, amino acids and reaction factors, as a subsystem that
allows a focus on the completed translational output as a measure of specific properties of the
ribosome.
Results: In analogy to the steady-state reaction of an enzyme complex, we propose a steady-state
translation complex for mRNA from any gene, and derive a maximum specific translation activity,
Ta(max), as a property of the ribosomal reaction complex. Ta(max) has units of a-protein output per
time per a-specific mRNA. A related property of the ribosome, Ta(max) , has units of a-protein per
time per total RNA with the relationship Ta(max) = ρa Ta(max), where ρa represents the fraction of
total RNA committed to translation output of Pa from gene a message. Ta(max) as a ribosome
property is analogous to kcat for a purified enzyme, and Ta(max) is analogous to enzyme specific
activity in a crude extract.
Conclusion: Analogy to an enzyme reaction complex led us to a ribosome reaction model for
measuring specific translation activity of a bacterial ribosome. We propose to use this model to
design experimental tests of our hypothesis that specific translation activity is a ribosomal property
that is subject to natural variation and natural selection much like Vmax and Km for any specific
enzyme.

Background
Measures of primary sequence variation in ribosomal
RNA, ribosomal protein, and non-ribosomal enzyme protein show that the corresponding gene sequences provide

a record of natural variation associated with phylogeny in
bacteria and archaea [1,2]. Recent analysis of a select subset of 32 protein-coding genes, mostly associated with
transcription and translation machinery, established phyPage 1 of 10

logenetic relationships among the host genomes of 69
bacterial and archaeal organisms, and the basis for a
molecular tree of variation calibrated to geological time
[1]. The phylogenetic tree constructed in that study largely
resembles trees based upon analyses of 16S rDNA
sequences [3].
In addition to the phylogenetic perspective based on
sequence variation in ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein encoding genes, we suggest that this sequence variation underlies differences in the performance of the
translational machinery. Modeling variation in the kinetics of translation, the primary energy-requiring process of
microbes, should lead to an enhanced ecological perspective of microbial life, much like enzyme kinetics has provided the basis for physiological models of metabolism.
Variation in kinetic properties of enzymes has been associated with phylogenetic variation in closely related bacteria but data are less readily available for the variation in
enzyme families. In some few studies, Km and Vmax have
been used as functional parameters of enzymes to infer
neutral or adaptive properties associated with allelic variation in natural populations [4,5]. Hereafter, we refer to
the kinetic parameters of enzymes as specific reactive
properties. These studies suggest that we should expect
phylogenetic variation in measures of specific reactive
properties, e.g. Km, Vmax, and kcat, for a family of functionally conserved enzymes. Though a recent, systematic study
of the natural variation in specific reactive properties of
enzyme families does not appear to be available, a brief
survey of literature supports the expectation for natural
variation of Km, Vmax in an enzyme family. For example,
the published values for Km of biosynthetic threonine
deaminase (EC 4.2.1.16) vary from 0.25 mM in Thiobacillus acidophilus and 3.2 mM in Proteus morganii, to 8.0 mM
in Escherichia coli, 13.9 mM in Geobacillus stearothermophilus, and 14.0 mM in Thermus sp. [6-10]. Similarly,
the Vmax value for purified threonine deaminase varies
over a range from 2.1 μmol/min/mg in Pseudomonas putida to 210 μmol/min/mg in E. coli and even higher in
other organisms. Overall, the reactive properties of the
biosynthetic threonine deaminase (4.2.1.16) family of
enzymes appear to reflect a natural variation over an
approximate range greater than two orders of magnitude.
Simply stated, enzymes and enzyme complexes that
evolve to carry out the same reactions in a set of organisms, should be expected to catalyze these reactions with
sometimes substantial differences in steady-state rates and
reaction efficiencies, owing to natural variation in
sequence associated with reaction properties. Variation in
reaction properties may confer a fitness advantage on
organisms and be fixed rapidly in populations, or be selectively neutral and accumulate in populations as a result of
genetic drift.

In analogy to the natural variation of conserved reactive
properties of proteins, ribosomal RNA sequences undergo
natural variation that forms the basis for phylogenetic
grouping of all organisms and reflects the physiological
adaptations associated with the sequence variation [9].
Regions of rRNA that are most highly conserved are speculated to be associated with the ribosomal reaction properties moreso than the regions which are more free to vary.
Ribosomal proteins also reflect sufficiently conserved variation that allows for their use in phylogenetic grouping
[1]. Since phylogenetic variation in enzyme protein
sequence is associated with variation in measurable, reactive properties of the enzymes, the suggestion seems reasonable that measurable, reactive properties of ribosomes
are associated with regions of rRNA and ribosomal protein sequences that undergo natural variation. Thus, reactive properties of ribosomes should also be expected to
vary in ways similar to the natural variation observed for
enzymes [11].
A small, phylogenetically varied subset of bacteria,
grouped by fast or slow growth rates in response to nutrient availability, demonstrated variation in a measurable
property of ribosomal activity termed translational power
by Dethlefsen and Schmidt [12]. This translational power
displayed natural variation over approximately a five-fold
range [11]. By inference from those studies, we postulate
that specific reactive properties of ribosomes are measurably constant for any specific bacterial phylotype or species
in a constant environment, and that each reactive property is subject to natural variation under selective constraints to maintain function.
In the present study we consider the ribosome and associated translational machinery as a co-evolving complex of
functionally conserved molecules with measurably varied
reactive properties in distinct bacterial populations. Consequently, we expect to find that ribosomes from different
bacteria vary in their steady-state output of proteins as a
result of selective pressures that have fine-tuned the translational machinery for optimal activity in a given environment. In analogy to a multi-enzyme complex, we model
ribosomal catalyzed translation activity as a steady-state
process involving the entire translational complex as a
transition-state intermediate such that the measurably
important output is a functional protein. The translational apparatus complex is, then, a subsystem of the
organism and produces the mass ratios of proteins
required for maintenance and growth. Treatment of the
translational complex as a subsystem operating in a
steady-state is the key factor that makes measurement of
protein output sufficient to characterize subsystem properties associated with a ribosome. Our model suggests that
variation in the reactive properties of ribosomes can be
detected by measuring the steady-state output of specific,

functional proteins. This model substitutes simpler, systems measures to replace the more complex, step-wise,
mechanistic measures used elsewhere, [e.g. [13,14]].
Details of the design strategy to develop this measure follow.

Methods
Strategy to measure reactive properties of ribosomes
In order to measure specific reactive properties of ribosomes, the design of a model of the translational apparatus
as a bacterial subsystem must take into account all factors
that can influence the rate of protein output that establishes gene expression levels and the mass ratio of proteins
for steady-state growth. When all such factors can be held
constant, then measurement of translational output
records a ribosome-specific property. Under any steady
state growth condition the properties of transcription and
translation machinery are constant. A few definitions,
here, are useful to build a model. For this model we define
expression level as the steady state mass ratio of protein,
Pa, from a specific gene compared to the total cell protein,
P, i.e. Pa/P.

The instantaneous mass ratio or expression level of a protein from any gene in a bacterium under steady state
growth conditions is determined by probabilities affecting
the following steps: 1, transcription initiation (promoter
strength, promoter configuration, transcription factors;
and metabolites); 2, transcription termination; 3, mRNA
stability; 4, ribosome binding site (e.g. Shine-Dalgarno
sequence) affinity for ribosome; 5, ribosome loading at
the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) or other sequences; 6, relative
codon frequency pattern, i.e. codon usage; 6, translation
initiation (start codon; initiation factors); 7, protein elongation (GTP, aminoacylated tRNA, elongation factors),
and termination; 8, frequency of polypeptide completion;
9, protein folding; 10, protein stability; and 11, metabolite balance regulating enzyme activity and synthesis [1518].
For this study, transcription processes in steps 1 and 2 are
held constant, and steps 3–11 form the basis to model the
steady-state output activity of the translation apparatus.
Fig. 1 and the accompanying description refer to these
steps 3–11.
Rationale for the model
In the exponential state of bacterial growth in a closed system, the rate of production of cell mass, dx/dt, is proportional to the initial cell mass, x, with the proportionality
represented by the instantaneous growth rate constant, k,
as

dx/dt = kx.

acid; tRNAaa, tRNA isoaccepting species for amino acid aa;
aa~tRNAaa, aminoacylated tRNA; Rx, reaction; and Pa, protein
from translation of mRNA from gene a.

In this steady state, the rate of production of any component of cell mass is commonly and reasonably assumed to
be a constant fraction of the total cell mass, and k would
be the expected proportionality constant for production
of any component of the cell. This is a reasonable assumption and subject to a simple proof that need not be shown
here. From this inference, as suggested by Neidhardt et al.
[19], k defines the steady-state rate of protein production
in Eq. (2).

k=

1 dx 1 dP
=
,
x dt P dt

(2)

In the steady state translation output of a genome represented by Eq. (2), the protein output per unit total RNA is

T=

kP
,
R

(3)

where T = the protein translation output of a genome,
measured in units of total protein, P, per unit total RNA,
R, in a bacterium in steady state growth with instantaneous growth rate, k [12,20]. This relationship approximates
a property of average translation activity per unit total
RNA for an organism in a specific state of growth. We
might also refer to T as the translation completion rate in
recognition that not all starts of polypeptide synthesis
reach completion [18]. Considering the protein product
from a single gene as a regulated, fractional component of
cell mass, Eq. (2) implies that the change in the mass of
protein, Pa, from any gene a in genome A, i.e. a ∈ A, is
dPa/dt = kPa.

(4)

It follows that a translation output Ta, from any gene a per
unit total RNA results from translation activity by the subset of the ribosomes translating the message from gene a.
Ribosomal RNA constitutes approximately 85% of total
RNA in bacteria [21], so total RNA is mostly ribosomal.

Let ρa represent the fraction of total RNA committed to
translation output of Pa from gene a message, then the
amount of R committed to producing Pa is ρaR. Thus ρaR
approximates the fraction of ribosomes translating the
mRNA from gene a ma. Since Eq. (3) defines the general
relationship of the overall translational output to total
RNA in a growing organism or culture, i.e. the translational power, we propose Eq. (5) as a special case of Eq.
(3) to represent the specific translational output from any
one specific gene, a.

frequency of codon-specific pauses and the greater is the
probability of premature termination of polypeptide synthesis, i.e. a higher drop-off frequency. Thus, within a
genome, A, the translation activity of its ribosomes would
be expected to vary over a definable range up to a maximum translation activity that is a property of the ribosome.
The rate of protein output in this Ribosome Reaction
Model is a function of the catalytic capacity of the activated ribosome complex acting upon the pool of
aa~tRNAaa as shown by Eq. (6).
dPa/dt = k3[R70ma]

Results
Ribosome analogy to an enzyme complex
Through simplifying assumptions, treat the 70S ribosome
as a multi-subunit enzyme that catalyzes reactions to
polymerize amino acids to make a functional protein
product, Pa. A summary representation of this process is
diagrammed as a chemical reaction sequence (Fig. 1). For
any gene, treat the initiation process and assembly of the
70S ribosome as analogous to activation of the ribosome
as an enzyme. The formation of the initiation complex
involves binding of 30S ribosome (R30) with mRNA from
gene a, (ma), at a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) or other ribosome
binding site; f-met~tRNA; the initiation factors IF1, IF2
and IF3; GTP; and subsequent assembly with 50S ribosome (R50) to form the activated ribosome, R70ma. In this
analogy, reaction cofactors are not rate limiting, ma is an
activator, and aminoacylated tRNAs (aa~tRNAaa) are substrate molecules. The amino acid polymerization reactions that follow utilize the pools of aa~tRNAaa to produce
the polypeptides for the functional Pa protein. Treat all
steps of polypeptide chain elongation reactions as a single
transition state intermediate. The overall reaction product
is Pa, formed in a step involving release from the ribosome-mRNA complex and assembly of the active protein.
We consider the last step as rate-determining. Measurement of the rate of increase of Pa reactivity is the measure
of the rate of production of functional proteins from
translation of gene a message.

Continuing the analogy, the active ribosome complex,
R70ma, would be expected to vary the rate of polypeptide
output in response to the variables of input, especially the
pool of aa~tRNAaa, and the codon composition of the
gene transcript, ma. The rate of the translation output
would be expected to vary as a function of the degree of
match of the aa~tRNAaa composition and abundance with
the relative codon frequency of the transcript. We posit
that a major source of the variation of specific translation
activity is the degree of mismatch between the relative
codon frequency and the tRNA abundance and composition. The greater the degree of mismatch, the higher the

We can see that the rate of production of Pa is the initial
reaction velocity of output from the gene a message, thus
dPa/dt = va.

(7)

From Eqs. (6–7) we see that
k3 = va/[R70ma].

(8)

k [R m ]
Eqs. (4–6) imply that Ta = 3 ρ70 a , and from our defiaR
nition of ρaR as the amount of R involved with translation

of mRNA from gene a, we infer that ρaR ≈ [R70ma] and thus
k3 ≈ Ta, the specific translation activity. The units for k3 are
units of Pa formed per unit time per unit R involved in
translating message ma from gene a. These units are the
same as the units for Ta, the specific translation activity in
Eq. (5). Under conditions where [R70ma] is maximum, all
mRNA from gene a is loaded onto ribosomes, and the
maximum output rate is achieved, then va becomes
Va(max). For conditions producing Va(max), k3 becomes
analogous to kcat for an enzyme reaction, as in Eq. (9).
kcat = Va(max)/[R70ma].

(9)

Activated ribosomes within an organism will therefore be
expected to display a property of maximum specific translation activity, Ta(max), under optimal conditions of reactant availability. By inference, it may be possible to
measure the catalytic efficiency for use of any specific
aa~tRNAaa in translation of ma by measure of kcat/Km, i.e.
Ta(max)/Km. We might expect, then, that the translation
properties of ribosomes in a R70ma complex are constant,
are organism specific, and therefore are genome-specific.
kcat for the complex would be expected to vary according
to ma properties that influence the expression level.

Single gene translation activity, factors and determinants
Modifying Eq. (5) to introduce a term for the expression
level of gene a, define the specific translation activity for
gene a as

Ta =

kPa
kP λ a
=
ρ aR
ρ aR

The half-life of proteins that comprise P would be
expected to vary over some range and that variation will
constitute some frequency distribution. Considering the
variation in stability of any protein Pa, a more accurate
representation of λa = Pa/P may be
(11)

In theory, the measurable total protein mass, P, will be
experimentally indistinguishable from ∑Pa even if the t1/2
of one or several Pa is extremely short. Therefore, we
expect that P ≈ ∑Pa. However, in the case of an extremely
short half-life for any Pa, the expression of Pa would
appear to be low and lead to an erroneous conclusion that
the mass ratio λa is low. Though a condition of high instability of Pa may be rare, calculation of the initial mass ratio
from Eq. (11) can be accomplished by substituting the initial protein output Pa' for Pa,

Pa ’ = Pae c at ,

a gene message owing to premature termination, ψa in Eq.
(13) represents a translation completion efficiency for
each gene.

(10)

where λa = Pa/P is the expression level. The λa term shows
the fractional contribution of functional protein from any
gene, a, to the total protein content of the organism in any
steady state of a growth cycle. Thus, λa is the mass ratio of
protein Pa compared to the total cellular protein. The dPa/
dt varies among the genes of a genome such that a gene or
gene set that is highly expressed has a higher production
rate for Pa than genes expressed less frequently. Therefore,
multiple expression states must be expected to exist
according to the functional role of a gene or set of genes
in the life cycle of an organism. The consequence of these
multiple expression states is that the steady state translation of transcripts from any low expression gene contributes fewer proteins than a high expression gene to the
total cellular protein.

λa = a .
∑ Pa

Since not all translation starts, Pa s , reach completion for

(12)

where ca is a protein stability constant, and t is the time
increment between completion of protein synthesis and
sampling. These relationships derive from treating the
decay of the functional protein Pa as Pa = Pa' exp-(cat). Note
that initially, i.e. when t = 0, the measured value and initial value for Pa are equal, and when ca is small, i.e. stable
protein, Pa ≈ Pa'. Thus Pa' is an estimate of the original protein mass when t, ca, and Pa are known.

ψa =

Pa
Pa s

(13)

Then δ, a so-called "drop-off frequency" sometimes used
to describe translation efficiency, may be defined as

P
δa = 1 −ψ a = 1 − a .
Ps

(14)

For unstable Pa, i.e. when the protein stability constant ca
is large, then it would be appropriate to substitute Pa' for
Pa from Eq. (13) and to introduce an initial Pa s ’ to substitute for Pa s to get

ψ a’ =

Pa′
Pa s ’

(15)

where

Pa s ’ = Pa s e c at .

(16)

The rationale for Eq. (16) is analogous to that for Eq. (12),
and Pa s ’ is an estimate of the original protein mass from
completion of all translation starts when t, ca, and Pa s are
known. Generally, it would be appropriate to use the efficiency factor of Eq.(13) and reserve Eq. (15) for probably
rare instances of a highly unstable Pa.
We may now also define specific translation activity for a
single gene a as

Ta =

kPa ψ a

ρ aR

(17)

and when considering the instability of proteins from any
gene a,

Ta =

kPa ’ψ a ’

Ribosome loading and transcript stability
We will next treat, specifically, the initiation step, also
called the ribosome loading step. Thus far we have considered factors affecting the specific translation activity, Ta.
The overall translation rate, however, also depends upon
Page 5 of 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/62

the frequency of ribosome loading onto mRNA, the stability of that mRNA, and the probability and frequency of
the gene transcription. The first step of the reaction
sequence (Fig. 1) represents ribosomal loading onto transcript ma from gene a ∈ A, described by rate equation Eq.
(19).

d[R70m a ]
= k R[R30 ][m a ][R50 ] − k −1[R70m a ]
dt

(19)

In Eq. (19), kR is a third-order rate constant with units of
(t-1)(conc-1)(conc-1). The conditions of growth result in
[ma] << [R30] and [ma] << [R50]. These conditions suggest
that the association reaction may display first-order
behavior. Let k+1 be a pseudo first-order rate constant,
where k+1 = kR [R30] [R50], and substitute into Eq. (19) to
obtain

d[R70m a ]
= k +1[m a ] − k −1[R70m a ].
dt

(19a)

We see then that Eq. (19a) shows the expected pseudo
first-order behavior of ma binding to ribosomes. At any
steady state of growth, ribosomal activation can be represented by an association constant, Ka, for the message ma
from gene a, as

k
[R70m a ]
K a = +1 =
.
k −1 [m a ][R30][R70]

(20)

This association constant can be thought of as a loading
factor that is a ratio of bound to free mRNA from gene a,
and can be related to the probability of message binding
to ribosome. The amount of ma undergoing translation
compared to the total ma is the relative frequency of loading and approximates the probability of ribosomal loading, i.e.

π a ≈ f1 =

[R70m a ]
,
[m a ]+[R70m a ]

(20a)

where fl is the relative loading frequency and πa is the
probability of message from gene a binding to ribosomes
for translation. The specific translation rate, Ta, weighted
by the fraction of total message loaded, πa([ma] + [R70ma])
= πama(total), gives an overall expectation for translation
rate of gene a message to make the functional protein, Pa
(Eq. (21)).
Trate = πama(total)Ta

(21)

lation rate, Trate, is transcript stability. The higher the stability of ma, the greater is the output of Pa per time, and
conversely, the lower the stability of ma, the lower the
overall translation rate. Analogous to treatment of protein
stability in Eq. (12), ma represents the amount of mRNA
from gene a that is available to bind a ribosome. It is easy
to see that instability of ma reduces the amount of transcript loaded for translation and reduces the overall translation rate. If the stability of mRNA, i.e. half-life, for gene
a is known, it should be possible to use Eq. (22) to estimate the actual ma available for loading,

m a = m a ’e −ω at ,

(22)

where ωa is a constant of mRNA stability for gene a, and
ma' is the initial amount of message.
Maximum translation rate
Ideal conditions that include optimal mRNA stability and
protein stability would be expected to maximize production of proteins from a single, protein-coding gene. Every
translation start results in a completed protein under optimal conditions when ψa = 1.0. Thus, an expected maximum, steady state specific translation activity by any
ribosome to make any Pa may be defined as a maximum
specific translation activity

Ta(max) =

kPa s
.
ρ aR

(23)

To approximate a Tmax for any gene a under non-ideal laboratory or natural conditions we may use Eq. (18) to correct for protein instabilities and translation efficiency to
establish that

⎛ kPa s ’ψ a ’
Tmax = lim Ta = lim ⎜

is the maximum speed at which ribosomes can translate
any gene in one organism at a steady state of growth. Such
optimal conditions imply existence of a Ka', a maximum
efficiency of ribosome binding to mRNA such that

K a’ =

,
[m a ’][R30][R50]

(25)

where m a ’ = m ae ω at and this also implies a corresponding

πa' for the Ka'. It follows, then, from Eqs. (24) and (25) that
a maximum overall translation output rate is given by

Factors and growth conditions that affect transcription
initiation are too numerous and variable to treat in the
context of overall translation rate. Therefore, the last step
we consider in this treatment of the overall specific trans-

It is now possible to account for the multiple effect(s) of
growth conditions on Ta, including factors that affect
translation efficiency, e.g. the drop-off rate and completion rate.
As defined in Eq. (24), the maximum specific translation
output activity for a ribosome, Tmax, defines a genomespecific property as suggested by Dethlefsen and Schmidt
[11]. As a general property, Tmax defines a capacity for production of protein, and that capacity will variably express
in relation to the transcript composition from a particular
gene. A convenient and practical way to look at specific
translation output capacity for a single gene tied to the
steady state growth rate of the organism is to combine the
factors that cause variability from gene to gene within a
genome into the expression for maximum specific translation output activity per unit total RNA in translation of ma.
From Eq. (23) for expression of protein from a specific
gene, a in genome A, we can see that

Ta(max) =

kPa s
kP λ a
=
,
ρ a R ρ a Rψ a

(27)

and in this form it is not necessary to know or measure
protein starts from gene a, i.e. Pa s , as long as the expression level, λa, and the translation completion efficiency,

ψa, are known. In the section on Discussion and Conclusions we suggest a way to estimate a value for ψa. When ρa
is known, i.e. the approximate fraction of ribosomes
translating ma, the value of Ta(max) will be highest because
it is a measure of the protein expression per unit of total
RNA translating ma. When ρa is not known, a fractional
approximation of Ta(max) is

Ta(max) =

kP λ a
Rψ a

(28)

which has units of units a-protein per time per unit total
RNA. It is clear that Ta(max) <Ta(max) because the approximation of Eq. (28) compares the gene a-protein output
rate to the total translational capacity as opposed to the
fraction of capacity, ρa, committed to ma translation in Eq.
(27). Thus, ρa relates Ta(max) to Ta(max), by Ta(max) = ρa
Ta(max).
The maximum specific translation output rate of functional, gene a protein can be measured in multiple organisms as a means to compare this ribosome-specific
property among the set of organisms by using Eq. (27). As

long as the functional proteins measured derive from an
orthologous set of genes, the actual measurement of
Ta(max) should reveal the variation in the specific translation rate property of ribosomes from one organism with
respect to that property in every other organism. Recognizing that the approximation Ta(max) is always less than
but fractionally related to Ta(max) by ρa to a specific gene a,
we suggest that this approximation will provide a basis to
detect, quantify and compare variation in the specific
translation rate property of a ribosome. We suggest that

Ta(max) measures the specific translation activity of ribosomes analogous to enzyme specific activity measurements
in crude extracts, e.g. Vmax/P, and that Ta(max) is analogous
to the kcat of a purified enzyme, e.g. Vmax/Pa. We propose
that Eq. (27) is an idealized mathematical model of the
organism-specific translation output rate as a specific,
functional property of the ribosome and that Eq. (28) is a
readily measurable, fractional approximation.

Discussion and conclusion
Analogy to the reaction of an enzyme complex formed the
basis to derive Eq. (27) as a simple model for specific
translation activity as a specific reaction property of a
ribosome. The measure of Ta(max) is made by the measure
of kP/ρaR and λa/ψa for the species-specific reaction property of a ribosome. Factors that make the measure speciesspecific are the expression level of the protein measured,
captured in λa as the relative ratio of Pa to the total protein
P, and the translation completion efficiency, ψa. This
model of translation activity of a ribosome provides a way
to compare ribosome function in one bacterium to
another, in bacteria that differ in their growth responses to
changing environments or growth conditions. A key postulate in deriving this model is the steady-state assumption that for the time interval of constant growth
conditions, the level of biosynthetic intermediates is constant and sufficient to support growth at a constant rate.
The steady-state assumption, in turn, permits treatment of
the ribosomal reaction complex (Fig. 1) as a cellular reaction subsystem, and to measure its output as an indicator
of the subsystem function and therefore as a property of
the subsystem. These two simplifications make it possible
to treat ribosomal protein synthesis as a "black box" subsystem comprised by many component activities, and to
use only the output of functional protein to measure this
subsystem property. Any gene product can be used to
measure a functional property of the protein synthesis
subsystem. For example, the specific activity of a biosynthetic pathway enzyme can be used to measure the reaction property of specific protein output per unit of
translating RNA associated with a single gene in a crude

extract of a pure culture of a bacterium. If the kcat of the
enzyme is known, i.e. reaction units per mg enzyme, the
expression level, λa, is the mass ratio of the amount of
enzyme protein, measured by activity, to the total extract
protein. The translation efficiency correlated to ψa can be
calibrated to a scale of codon usage relative to the highest
expression set of genes. The definition of ψa requires values for the codon usage measure to vary over the range 0
≤ ψa ≤ 1.0, and several possible calculations of bias in
codon usage previously reported could be used. As an
example, the codon adaptation index of Sharp and Li [21]
has been shown to correlate directly with the expressionlevel of protein-coding genes in Escherichia coli and may
be used as a value for ψa in this context [16]. We also suggest that a Pearson cross correlation measure of similarity
between the relative codon frequency vector of a test gene,
a, and a reference vector, b, of a high-expression gene set,
i.e. rγ(a|b), may be well suited and sufficient for this measure.
Measurement of the activity of the functional protein output from a gene permits use of any protein-coding gene or
set of genes to calibrate specific translation activity as the
measurable reactive property or parameter of ribosomes,
using Ta(max) when ρa is known or using Ta(max) when ρa is
unknown. It is reasonable to expect that measurement of

Ta(max) as the specific translation activity for ma is fractionally related to Ta(max) just as the specific activity of an
enzyme measured in a crude cell extract, Vmax/P, is fractionally related to kcat = Vmax/Pa for the purified enzyme.

Kurland [20,18] and uniquely applied by Dethlefsen and
Schmidt [11] is based upon treating the generalized protein production per unit time per total RNA (kP/R) as constant for a specific growth condition of an organism. If the
apparent difference in translational power between ribosomes of a bacterium A compared to B can be attributed to
differences in the ribosomes [11], we suggest that Ta(max)
may improve the accuracy of measurement of the ribosomal differences and offer a way to study the natural variation in the properties associated with ribosomal
reactivity. Our proposed improvement in accuracy is
based upon the measurement of translational output, or
power, from the mRNA from an individual gene in our
ribosome reaction model. This model predicts that the
natural variation in specific translation activity for mRNA
from any genes within a genome should show a central
tendency that is characteristic for that organism, such that

Ta1 (max) ≈ Ta 2 (max) ≈ Ta 3 (max) … ≈ Ta n (max)

(29)

for specific genes a1 through an in the genome of an organism A. This means, of course, that while the specific translation activity for different genes will be expected to vary
within a genome, an average specific translation activity
will represent the ribosome property for the host organism. According to Eq. (28), the steady state condition
under which the relationships of Eq. (29) would hold
requires that λa/ψa be approximately constant for all ai.

This means, then, that if specific translation activity is an
approximately constant property of the ribosomes of an
organism, the ratio of the expression level to codon usage

izes the natural variation in this ribosomal reactive property.
In addition to using the reaction rate measurement Ta(max)
and Ta(max) to characterize ribosomes, it should be possible to measure a Km for the ribosome reaction model by
using in vitro translation with rate-limiting concentrations of an aminoacylated tRNA as conceptually depicted
in Fig. 1. Measurement of a Km for a charged tRNA would
then allow characterization of a ribosome reaction efficiency as Ta(max)/Km or Ta(max) /Km. A further advantage of
this model is that it corrects for various specific errors, e.g.
translational frameshift and other output errors, by basing
the ribosome reactivity upon production of functional
enzymes and measuring those functions directly.
A useful model should reflect the behavior of a system
under naturally occurring as well as experimental conditions. One observation is that ribosomes are rarely saturated under a specific growth condition [11].
Achievement of a steady-state proposed by this model
requires only a constant balance of reactants to achieve a
stable output over time. This steady-state model applies
for all degrees of saturation. This Ribosome Reaction

that are consistent with specific lifestyles from mostly dormant to rapid responders. This model provides an accessible tool and potential to measure a physiological bias of
ribosomes to phylogeny and the environment in which
they operate.

other words, organisms that are rapid responders to
change of environmental conditions will tend to have
sloppier translation than slow responders [12], and our
Ribosome Reaction model supports these translation relationships.
Development of this model provides a potential boost to
successful inference of physiology from genomic
sequence. If the relationships of Eq. (27) and the proportionate measurement of Eq. (28) hold in analysis of
codon usage and gene expression level, it may become
possible to associate specific ribosomal characteristics to
bacterial lifestyle and ecological niche, i.e. to establish
that ribosomes are customized for their host environment. For example, using a sufficient number of measurements of threonine deaminase specific activity in steadystate growth of a phylogenetically varied set of bacteria,
along with codon usage patterns of these genes, the calcu-
