SECRET domain of variola virus CrmB protein can
be a member of poxviral type II chemokinebinding proteins family
Denis V Antonets*, Tatyana S Nepomnyashchikh, Sergei N Shchelkunov

Abstract
Background: Variola virus (VARV) the causative agent of smallpox, eradicated in 1980, have wide spectrum of
immunomodulatory proteins to evade host immunity. Recently additional biological activity was discovered for
VARV CrmB protein, known to bind and inhibit tumour necrosis factor (TNF) through its N-terminal domain
homologous to cellular TNF receptors. Besides binding TNF, this protein was also shown to bind with high affinity
several chemokines which recruit B- and T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells to sites of viral entry and replication.
Ability to bind chemokines was shown to be associated with unique C-terminal domain of CrmB protein. This
domain named SECRET (Smallpox virus-Encoded Chemokine Receptor) is unrelated to the host proteins and lacks
significant homology with other known viral chemokine-binding proteins or any other known protein.
Findings: De novo modelling of VARV-CrmB SECRET domain spatial structure revealed its apparent structural
homology with cowpox virus CC-chemokine binding protein (vCCI) and vaccinia virus A41 protein, despite low
sequence identity between these three proteins. Potential ligand-binding surface of modelled VARV-CrmB SECRET
domain was also predicted to bear prominent electronegative charge which is characteristic to known
orthopoxviral chemokine-binding proteins.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that SECRET should be included into the family of poxviral type II chemokinebinding proteins and that it might have been evolved from the vCCI-like predecessor protein.

Introduction
Chemokines form a large family of chemoattractant
cytokines with low molecular weight (~7-14 kDa) and
their sequence similarity range from 20 to 90%. More
than 50 distinct chemokines and over 19 different chemokine receptors were discovered to date. All known
cellular chemokine receptors are type III transmembrane
proteins associated with G-proteins. According to the
arrangement of conservative N-terminal cysteine residues chemokines are divided into CC-, CXC-, C- and
CX3C-chemokines [1]. Chemokines play important roles
in regulation of innate as well as acquired immunity
orchestrating leukocyte migration. Through binding to
cell surface or intercellular matrix glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs) chemokines form chemotactic gradient attracting leukocytes to the sites of injury and inflammation.

Chemokines are also involved in embryonic development, organogenesis and other processes [1,2]. Despite
low sequence identity between different chemokines all
of them share remarkably similar tertiary structure with
elongated N-terminal loop followed by three b-chains
folded in a “greek key” moiety [3].
During long-lasting coevolution with their hosts poxviruses have developed efficient mechanisms to evade
host immune reactions initiated in response to infection.
In particular, one of the most important viral immunomodulatory strategies are viroceptors - virally encoded
proteins secreted from infected cells - which bind and
inhibit biological activity of tumour necrosis factor
(TNF), different kinds of interferons, interleukine 18,
chemokines and other mediators of host immune system
[4-6]. Such viroceptors may be non-homologous to cellular proteins with correspondent biological activity, as
it was shown for poxviral chemokine-binding proteins
[7]. Some poxviral immunomodulatory proteins possess

pleiotropic activity, as it was shown for M-T7 protein of
myxoma virus, which is able to bind gIFN as well as
chemokines [8]. Recently additional biological activity
was discovered for orthopoxviral CrmB and CrmD proteins. Previously known only as TNF-binding proteins,
they were shown to bind with high affinity and inhibit
CCL25, CCL28, CCL25, CXCL12b, CXCL13 and
CXCL14 chemokines. Chemokine-binding activity of
CrmB and CrmD proteins was shown to be mediated by
their unique C-terminal domain lacking substantial
homology to any other known proteins. This domain
was named SECRET - Smallpox virus-Encoded Chemokine Receptor [9].
Since C-terminal domain of VARV-CrmB lacks substantial sequence homology with other proteins (excepting orthologous proteins of other orthopoxviruses), and
since its spatial structure is not known, we decided to
predict it to find related proteins sharing similar structural features with VARV-CrmB SECRET domain. Predicted spatial structure of VARV CrmB SECRET
domain was found to be closely related to cowpox virus
vCCI protein, belonging to the family of poxviral type II
chemokine-binding proteins.

Results and Discussion
Using PSIPRED server [10] VARV-CrmB SECRET
domain was predicted to consist of twelve b-strands
linked by unordered loops, remaining the overall secondary structure of poxviral type II chemokine-binding
proteins (vCkBPII). Using I-TASSER web-server [11],
which was shown to be the best server for predicting
spatial structures of proteins according to results of
CASP7 (CASP - Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) and CASP8 competitions [11,12], we
obtained the model of VARV-CrmB SECRET domain.
SECRET was predicted to be b-sandwich, composed by
two parallel b-sheets connected by several loops (Figure
1). The exterior surface of the first b-sheet was hidden
from the solvent by two long engirdling loops. The
I-TASSER output can be found in Additional file 1.
As the best template for modelling SECRET spatial
structure I-TASSER server has chosen the structure of
CPXV vCCI protein [PDB: 1CQ3] belonging to the
family of poxviral type II chemokine-binding proteins
which are encoded by almost all known members of
Orthopoxvirus and Leporipoxvirus genera. These abundantly secreted during the early stages of infection 35
kDa glycoproteins lack any homology to cellular chemokine receptors as well as to other known proteins [3,13].
This protein family also includes VACV A41 protein
and its orthologs [14]. Despite low sequence identity
(~20%) VACV A41 [PDB:2VGA] and CPXV vCCI
[PDB:1CQ3] proteins share remarkably similar tertiary
structure [14]. We calculated superposition of vCCI and

A41 spatial structures with predicted tertiary structure
of the SECRET domain (Figure 2A). Superpositions
were made using CEalign [15]. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between coordinates of aligned Ca atoms
of SECRET and vCCI was about 2.33 Å (identity
between structurally aligned amino acid residues was
14.2%), RMSD between coordinates of aligned Ca atoms
of SECRET and A41 was 3.28 Å (10.8% of identity),
RMSD between coordinates of aligned Ca atoms of A41
and vCCI was about 3.06 Å (19.9% of identity). The
sequences of these proteins were aligned using TMalign [16] server and then manually edited according to
their either predicted (SECRET) or known (vCCI, A41)
secondary structures (Figure 2B). According to produced
alignment SECRET shared 16.3% of sequence identity
with vCCI and 15.3% with A41 protein; sequence identity of vCCI to A41 was about 25.5%.
Although spatial structures of vCkBPII proteins are
remarkably similar, different members of the family
have notable characteristic structural differences. Thus
VACV A41 lacks long extended loop which connects
the 2nd and the 3d b strands of vCCI (Figure 2A). This
loop is conserved in vCCI and its orthologs and was
shown to make these proteins able to bind wide spectrum of CC-chemokines with high affinity [3,13,17].
Comparison of known tertiary structure of VACV A41
with predicted spatial structure of the SECRET domain
of VARV CrmB revealed that SECRET probably also
lacks this loop (Figure 2). This finding gives a bit of support to hypothesis of Ruiz-Arguello and his colleagues
[14] that high selectivity and similar specificity towards
chemokines, observed for VACV A41 and ectromelia
virus (ECTV) E163 protein (orthologous to A41) and
SECRET-domain containing proteins, should be underlaid by common structural traits of these vCkBPs.
VACV A41 and ECTV E163 bind with high affinity

Figure 2 Superposition of vCCI and A41 structures with modelled SECRET and alignment of their sequences. (A) Superposition of vCCI,
A41 and SECRET was made with CEalign [15]. SECRET is red coloured, vCCI is shown in blue and A41 is green. Left panel shows surfaces formed
by b-sheets I of these proteins. Right panel shows the same superposition rotated around y-axis by 90°. Characteristic long extended loop of
vCCI is absent in A41 as well as in the SECRET. (B) Alignment of vCCI, A41 and SECRET amino acid sequences produced with structural
alignment server TM-align [16]. Alignment was manually edited taking in mind their secondary structures (shown above corresponding
sequences) using Aline software [22]. Numbering of amino acid residues in SECRET corresponds to that of full length VARV-CrmB protein
(P34015). Gaps are shown as dots, sequences are coloured by amino acid similarity. Amino acid residues of vCCI and A41 are numbered
according to numeration found in 1CQ3 and 2VGA PDB files, respectively.

CCL21, 25, 26, 28, CXCL12a, CXCL12b, CXCL13 and
CXCL14 chemokines [3,14]; and SECRET domains of
VARV CrmB, ECTV CrmD and some other SECRETcontaining proteins were shown to bind with high
affinity CCL25, 28, CXCL12b, CXCL13 and CXCL14
chemokines [9].
Furthermore, although in all known vCkBPs exterior
surface of the second b sheet has pronounced electronegative potential due to multiple acidic amino acid residues (Figure 3A) that is favourable to the interaction
with positively charged conservative patches of basic
amino acid residues found in all known chemokines
[3,7,13,17], charge distributions of the opposite surfaces
of different vCkBPs may have remarkable distinctions
[3,18] (Figure 3B). For example, in vCCI and in the
majority of its orthologs this surface has weak

electrostatic charge, whereas corresponding surfaces of
A41 and its orthologs have pronounced positive charge
making these proteins able to bind negatively charged
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [3]. Myxoma virus M-T1
protein was also shown to bind GAGs, and unlike the
majority of vCCI orthologs it has prominent positive
electrostatic potential on the surface formed by b-sheet
I encircled by two loops [18]. Thus ability to bind
GAGs makes certain vCkBPs capable of blocking leukocyte influx into the site of viral replication interfering
with chemotactic gradient formation through inhibiting
interaction of chemokines with cell surface and extracellular matrix GAGs [3,18,19]. Other vCkBPs, which
could not bind GAGs, realize their biological activity
only through competing with cellular chemokine receptors for chemokines binding. As predicted by us VARV

orthologs, and we think, it would be of interest to examine phylogenetic relations between the SECRET domain
of CrmB and vCCI orthologs.

Figure 3 Electrostatic potential surfaces of SECRET (A), vCCI (B)
and A41 (C). Upper panel shows chemokine-binding surfaces
formed by b-sheets II of corresponding molecules. Lower panel
shows the same molecules rotated around y-axis by 180°.
Electrostatic potential was calculated with DelPhi software [20].
Negatively charged area is coloured in red and blue colour indicates
positive electrostatic charge. Image was produced using PyMOL
[21].

CrmB SECRET domain also has prominent electronegative potential on the surface formed by b-sheet II, but
its opposite surface have no positively charged areas
(Figure 3). Thus VARV CrmB SECRET domain is likely
unable to bind GAGs and should realize its biological
activity only through its ability to interfere with binding
of certain chemokines to their cellular receptors that
was discovered by Alejo and his colleagues [9].

Conclusions
Our prediction that VARV CrmB SECRET domain
belongs to the family of poxviral type II chemokinebinding proteins is supported by the following: 1.
SECRET was shown to bind several chemokines with
high affinity [9]; 2. its ligand-binding surface was predicted to have prominent electronegative charge
required for binding to positively charged conservative
amino-acid residues of chemokines, as it was shown for
other members of vCkBPsII [3,7,13,17]; 3. its selectivity
towards chemokines is likely to be associated with lacking long extended negatively charged loop (present in
vCCI and its orthologs [3,7,13,17]) as it was shown for
A41 protein [3]. Thus the predicted structural similarity
of SECRET with other vCkBPsII indicates that despite
low similarity of their sequences they were most likely
derived from the common ancestor. It’s curiously that in
genomes of Leporipoxvirus and Orthopoxvirus genera
members genes coding for CrmB orthologs are situated
in immediate proximity to the genes coding for vCCI

Methods
Prediction of secondary structure of VARV-CrmB
SECRET domain was done using PSIPRED server [10].
Spatial structure of SECRET domain was modeled using
I-TASSER web-server [11]. The server selected the
structure of cowpox virus (CPXV) vCCI (viral CC-chemokine inhibitor) protein [PDB:1CQ3] as the best template for modelling SECRET domain. Electrostatic
potential of molecular surfaces of all compared proteins
was calculated using DelPhi software [20]. Superpositions of the structures were made using CEalign [15].
All molecular graphic images were produced using
PyMOL [21]. VARV-CrmB amino acid sequence used in
this work was taken from [Swiss-Prot:P34015]. Amino
acid sequences of CPXV vCCI [PDB:1CQ3], vaccinia
virus (VACV) A41 chemokine-binding protein
[PDB:2VGA] and VARV-CrmB SECRET domain were
structurally aligned using TM-align server [16]. Alignment was manually edited taking in mind the secondary
structures (shown above corresponding sequences) of
the proteins using Aline software [22].
