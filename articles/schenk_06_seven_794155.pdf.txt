Abstract
Background: Pollen of the European white birch (Betula pendula, syn. B. verrucosa) is an important
cause of hay fever. The main allergen is Bet v 1, member of the pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR10) multigene family. To establish the number of PR-10/Bet v 1 genes and the isoform diversity
within a single tree, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of PR-10 genes was performed on
two diploid B. pendula cultivars and one interspecific tetraploid Betula hybrid. Sequences were
attributed to putative genes based on sequence identity and intron length. Information on
transcription was derived by comparison with homologous cDNA sequences available in GenBank/
EMBL/DDJB. PCR-cloning of multigene families is accompanied by a high risk for the occurrence of
PCR recombination artifacts. We screened for and excluded these artifacts, and also detected
putative artifact sequences among database sequences.
Results: Forty-four different PR-10 sequences were recovered from B. pendula and assigned to
thirteen putative genes. Sequence homology suggests that three genes were transcribed in somatic
tissue and seven genes in pollen. The transcription of three other genes remains unknown. In total,
fourteen different Bet v 1-type isoforms were identified in the three cultivars, of which nine
isoforms were entirely new. Isoforms with high and low IgE-reactivity are encoded by different
genes and one birch pollen grain has the genetic background to produce a mixture of isoforms with
varying IgE-reactivity. Allergen diversity is even higher in the interspecific tetraploid hybrid,
consistent with the presence of two genomes.
Conclusion: Isoforms of the major birch allergen Bet v 1 are encoded by multiple genes, and we
propose to name them accordingly. The present characterization of the Bet v 1 genes provides a
framework for the screening of specific Bet v 1 genes among other B. pendula cultivars or Betula
species, and for future breeding for trees with a reduced allergenicity. Investigations towards
sensitization and immunotherapy should anticipate that patients are exposed to a mixture of Bet v
1 isoforms of different IgE-reactivity, even if pollen originates from a single birch tree.

Background
Pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) proteins constitute
the largest group of aeroallergens and are among the four
most common food allergens [1]. The main allergen is a
PR-10 pollen protein from the European white birch (Betula pendula) termed Bet v 1 [2]. Birch pollen is a major
cause of Type I allergies in the temperate climate zone of
the northern hemisphere. Over 95% of the tree pollensensitized patients in Scandinavia display IgE binding to
Bet v 1, while 60% react exclusively to this allergen [3].
Pollen of other Fagales species contains Bet v 1 homologues that share epitopes with Bet v 1 [4].
PR-10 proteins are present as a multigene family across a
range of phylogenetically distant species, including Gymnosperms, Monocots, and Dicots [5-7]. As a consequence,
several foods contain Bet v 1 homologues, including nuts,
vegetables, and Rosaceae fruits [6,8,9]. Patients that are
sensitized to Bet v 1 may experience mild allergic symptoms upon consumption of these foods due to IgE crossreactivity. Symptoms of this so called oral allergy syndrome (OAS) are mainly limited to the oral cavity. Crossreactivity has clearly been demonstrated by allergic
responses to the celery protein Api g 1, which is initiated
by sensitization to Bet v 1 [8].
The B. pendula genome contains multiple PR-10 genes
with varying expression patterns. Among these, the Bet v
1 allergens are expressed in pollen. The first Bet v 1 isoform was identified by immunoscreening a pollen cDNA
expression library with serum of birch pollen allergic
patients [2]. Other Bet v 1 isoforms have been sequenced
by various authors since then [10-13]. Pollen mixtures
from multiple trees were found to contain multiple Bet v
1 isoforms [13]. Bet v 1 isoforms differ in the ability to
bind IgE and in the T-cell proliferation score [14]. Two
other types of PR-10 proteins were detected in birch cells
that were grown in a liquid medium in the presence of
microbial pathogens [15]. These proteins are expressed in
roots and leaves under basal conditions or induced under
various stress-related conditions [15,16]. The PR-10 genes
from B. pendula form a homogeneous group, based on
sequence similarities. Homogeneity is suggested to be
maintained by concerted evolution [17]. Arrangements of
PR-10 genes into clusters, such as found for Mal d 1 genes
in apple (Malus domestica), may facilitate concerted evolution [18].
Given the prominent role of Bet v 1 allergens in the sensitization to hay fever and OAS, birch is a relevant target for
development of allergy prevention strategies. Selection
and breeding of hypoallergenic trees or the application of
genetic modification to develop these may potentially
reduce the allergenic load caused by birch. Knowledge on
the diversity of PR-10 genes, their expression, and aller-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/168

genicity of the gene products is required to facilitate these
strategies. In the present study, we amplified, cloned and
sequenced PR-10 alleles from three B. pendula cultivars to
establish the number of PR-10/Bet v 1 genes and the isoform diversity within a single tree.

Results
PCR recombination artifacts
When PCR amplification is performed on groups of
closely related sequences, such as the PR-10 gene family,
accurate sequences are essential to distinguish between
members. When we initially determined the relationships
among the recovered sequences, most clades in the Bayesian consensus tree had low posterior probabilities. Several sequences occupied intermediate positions between
well-defined clusters. This suggested the possibility of
recombination. Recombination could have occurred in
vivo through a crossing-over or gene conversion between
prior existing genes, or in vitro during the PCR through
strand-switching or re-annealing of incompletely amplified fragments.

Evidence supports the view that recombinant sequences
were PCR artifacts. Recombination signals were abundant
in the sequences obtained after the 30-cycle PCR (Figure
1a) and virtually absent when 22 cycles were employed
(Figure 1b). Several GenBank sequences showed clear evidence for recombination too (Figure 1c). Putative recombinants from our experiments lacked or nearly lacked
unique mutations and could be separated into two or
three stretches that were identical to other sequences
obtained. The GenBank recombinants shared close to
100% sequence identity to combinations of other accessions.
The use of independent PCRs resolves which sequences
are genuine, since the probability of isolating identical
artifacts in independent PCRs is extremely low. Most
sequences without recombination signal were confirmed
in independent PCRs (Table 1), while those with a recombination signal were not. The only exception was the PR10.03B02.01 allele from 'Tristis' that was found in three
independent PCRs. This allele was an in vivo recombination of the first 300 bp, including the intron, from the PR10.03D gene and 183 bp from the original PR-10.03B
gene as found in 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke' and 'Long
Trunk'. Putative recombination artifacts were quite abundant in the 26 and 30-cycle PCR (27–46% of the
sequences), but rare in the 22 and 24-cycle PCR (2–11%)
(Table 1). We conservatively maintained the sequences
that were confirmed in independent PCRs and those with
at least three unique mutations for further analysis. A
minimum of three unique mutations was chosen to
ensure that potential base mis-incorporation artifacts
were excluded.

Several of the PR-10 sequences from B. pendula that were
available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ also showed clear
evidence for recombination (Figure 1c). However, it was
not possible to do a similar check as mentioned above for
the GenBank sequences, and we can only hypothesize on
the presence of artifact sequences without such direct evidence. Given the regular occurrence of artifact sequences
in our experiments, we maintained only those 40 GenBank sequences that were not under suspicion of recombination artifacts for further analysis.

Phylogenetic analysis: newly isolated sequences
We sequenced 404 individual clones in both directions
(Table 1). Fourteen different sequences were identified in
the diploid cultivar 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke', 7 of
which were unique for this cultivar. Fifteen different
sequences (of which 10 were unique) were identified in
the diploid cultivar 'Tristis'. Approximately twice as many
different sequences, namely 28, were identified in the
tetraploid cultivar 'Long Trunk'; of these, 16 sequences
were of B. pendula origin (8 unique), and 12 sequences

were from another Betula species (all unique). In total, 32
different sequences were found.
The Open Reading Frame (ORF) of the sequences was
highly conserved and the alignment was straightforward.
All but one ORF contained 483 nucleotides, coding for a
putative protein that is 160 amino acids long. One
sequence from 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke' required the
inclusion of an indel between base 388 and 389 of the
consensus. This sequence was denoted as a pseudogene,
since the indel introduced a stop codon at 7 codons
downstream. It cannot be excluded that this pseudogene
is expressed, since the stop codon was located near the 3'
end. The intron position was identical in all sequences
and located at codon 62, being inserted between the first
and second nucleotide. Most alleles had 5' splicing sites of
AG:GT, with the exception of one allele that had a GG:GT
splicing site. The 3' splicing sites were AG:GC or AG:GA.
This is in concordance with known motifs for plant
introns. The introns were relatively AT-rich (55–65%).
We determined the relationships among the PR-10
sequences from B. pendula. For this, the 'Long Trunk'
sequences that were designated to the other parental species were excluded. Excluding primer traces, 171 of the
452 aligned exon positions were variable, while 150 positions were phylogenetically informative. The consensus
tree from the Bayesian analysis indicated several welldefined clusters (Figure 2). We implemented a cut-off
level of 98% identity and allowed maximally two alleles
per cultivar per gene to estimate the number of genes. In
this way, we putatively identified ten genes in 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke', eleven in 'Tristis', and thirteen in 'Long
Trunk'. Thirteen different genes were distinguished when
the information was combined. Each gene was identified
as such in at least two birch cultivars and was characterized by a distinct intron, in most cases of a different size
between 84 and 152 bp (Figure 2). The similarity between
different alleles of one gene ranged from 98.9 to 100%
identity in the exons, which corresponds to 0–5 SNPs. Bet
v 1.02A and Bet v 1.02B were not well distinguished in the
coding sequences, but had distinguishable introns. The
pseudogene PR-10.03B-p01 from 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke' was identical to the PR-10.03B allele from 'Long
Trunk' except for its indel.
When all alleles from 'Long Trunk' were included, 182
variable positions were identified among the 452 aligned
exon positions. 154 positions were phylogenetically
informative. The topology of the consensus tree from the
Bayesian analysis showed that seven specific 'Long Trunk'
genes were clustered pair wise to the B. pendula genes and
these are likely to represent orthologuous genes from the
second Betula species (not shown). Given the high identity (up to 100%) to PR-10 sequences from B. ermanii, this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/168

species, or a close relative, is likely to represent the second
parental species (unpublished data, Schenk et al.). Intron
sequences of orthologuous genes mostly showed slight
differences in length or base pair composition. Three
genes were recovered only from the unknown parent species and five only from B. pendula, indicating that Betula
species do not necessarily have the same (number of)
genes.
Phylogenetic analysis: GenBank sequences versus newly
obtained sequences
All but two GenBank sequences had an ORF of 483 base
pairs that coded for 160 amino acids and was generally
interrupted by a position-conserved intron. Two
sequences required the inclusion of an indel, following
base 354 of the consensus sequence. This resulted in a
stop codon directly after the insertion. The GenBank dataset was combined with the newly obtained sequences.
Primer traces were discarded, resulting in an aligned
stretch of 425 bp from base 28 to 452 of the consensus.
Several GenBank sequences are identical at this stretch,
reducing the number of unique GenBank sequences in the
analysis to thirty-three. 173 out of 425 aligned positions
were variable, while 146 were phylogenetically informative. The information from the Bayesian consensus tree
was added to Table 2 by indicating in which gene cluster
the GenBank alleles landed. Similarly to the analysis of
the newly isolated sequences we used a cut-off of 98%
identity. In the resulting classification, 35 out of 40 alleles
that were assigned to a particular gene showed more than
99% identity for the exons. The lowest similarity of an
allele that still clustered with a particular gene in the phylogenetic analysis was 98.4% identity with the reference
sequence (Table 2).

We classified the genes into five subfamilies (I–V) based
on identities of the coding regions and the intron. The
average identity between alleles within each subfamily
was 95–100%. The GenBank sequences were in part
derived from RNA extractions from specific tissues. We
used this tissue information to predict the transcription of
the PR-10 genes (Table 2). For this, alleles of a single gene
are assumed to have the same mode and location of transcription. Subfamily I and II consist of respectively four
and three genes and include alleles that are homologous
to the pollen-expressed Bet v 1 allergens [2,13]. For four
genes within these subfamilies, we found alleles that were
100% identical to pollen mRNA-derived sequences previously deposited into GenBank. Alleles from two other
genes were 99.8% identical (1 SNP difference) to pollen
mRNA-derived sequences from GenBank, which we take
to predict the location of transcription for these six genes
with a very high level of confidence. For only one of the
genes in subfamily II, there was no mRNA-derived homologue in the GenBank database, but the high homology

(97.8–98.2%) to the other genes in this subfamily suggests that this gene will be expressed in pollen as well.
Subfamily III consists of four genes, two of which have
alleles that are 99.5% identical to homologues of the previously described ypr10a and ypr10b sequences, which are
transcribed in roots and leaves [15]. Transcription of the
other two genes in subfamily III is unknown, as is the transcription of the single gene in subfamily IV. Subfamily V
consists of a single gene. One of the recovered alleles was
100% identical to the previously described ypr10c
sequence that is also expressed in roots and leaves [15].
Given the fact that all sequences in subfamily III-V are less
than 90% homologous to pollen-derived mRNAs and that
there is no evidence of expression in pollen, we consider
these as non-allergens.
Nomenclature
All recovered B. pendula alleles were added to Table 2. This
table also lists all known GenBank accessions of Bet v 1
sequences that were not under suspicion of artifacts. If
sequences were previously named, we included a cross-

reference to the original nomenclature (Bet v 1a-n) as well
as to the nomenclature of the allergen nomenclature committee (Bet v 1.0101 to 1.3101) [19]. Gao et al. [18,20]
designed a nomenclature system for the Mal d 1 to Mal d
4 allergens that differentiates between alleles from different genes. We have adopted their system in Table 2. Protein sequences that have less than 95% identity are
designated according to the current allergen nomenclature. A Latin letter is added to the iso-allergen name for
those genes that have more than 95% identity. Two
numerals are added for each allelic variant at the protein
level. Two additional numerals indicate silent mutations.
For example, Bet v 1.02C02.02 refers to a silent mutation
in the second protein variant of the Bet v 1.02C gene,
which shares more than 95% identity with Bet v 1.02A and
B. The PR-10 sequences that were not allergens (not pollen-expressed) are named in a similar fashion, except that
names started with PR-10 instead of Bet v 1. If future evidence would indicate that a particular PR-10 gene is
expressed in pollen after all, the name can easily be modified by replacing the PR-10 tag with Bet v 1.

PR-10 proteins and allergenicity
A high similarity between proteins increases the chance
that they share epitopes, while on the other hand, a single
amino acid change may influence allergenicity drastically.
The high homogeneity among the PR-10 genes of B. pendula was reflected by a higher allelic variation at the
nucleic acid level compared to the protein level. Hence,
the 45 different genomic sequences encoded 32 different
putative isoforms (Figure 3). This is consistent with the
relatively large number of synonymous mutations compared to the number of non-synonymous mutations (Ka/
Ks ratios) [21]. The number of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site were calculated
from pair wise comparisons of all alleles from the three B.
pendula varieties. The average value was 0.080 for Ka and
0.247 for Ks, resulting in an average Ka/Ks ratio of 0.33 (n
= 45). Analysis of the occurrence of non-synonymous
mutations per codon indicated two interesting regions.
The region between codon Asn42 and Ile56 lacked non-synonymous mutations and is characterized by a phosphatebinding loop with the sequence motive GxGGxGx (Figure
3). Relatively many amino-acid differences were present
beyond codon 125, especially between isoforms of the
genes PR-10.04/PR-10.05 and PR-10.01 to PR-10.03 (Figure 3).

Previous research has identified isoforms with varying IgE
reactivity within mixtures of pollen. In fact, this is also
true for pollen from a single tree. Ferreira et al. [14] made
a distinction between isoforms with high, intermediate
and low IgE-binding activity. The high IgE-binding isoform Bet v 1a (X15877) clustered with alleles of gene Bet
v 1.01A and was 100% identical at the protein level to the
Bet v 1.01A01 isoform. The intermediate IgE binding isoforms Bet v 1c and f (X77265, X77268) clustered with
alleles of the genes Bet v 1.01C and Bet v 1.02C and differed by one amino acid from the Bet v 1.01C01 and the
Bet v 1.02C02 isoforms. The low IgE binding isoform Bet
v 1d (X77266) clustered with alleles of gene Bet v 1.01B,
and was 100% identical at the protein level to the Bet v
1.01B01 isoform. Nine amino acids have been identified
that affect the allergenicity of the Bet v 1 proteins on the
B-cell level [12,14]. These are marked in Figure 3. The
tetraploid 'Long Trunk' contained several isoforms with
unique amino acid substitutions due to its putative hybrid
origin. This greatly enlarges the variation in putative IgEreactivity among isoforms of this cultivar.
Two major T-cell binding epitopes have been identified,
which are positioned between amino acids 112–123 and
142–156 [22]. Activation of T lymphocytes with the Bet v
1142–156 epitope induced cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5).
The major T-cell epitope Bet v 1142–156 has an amino acid
variation at position Thr143. At this position the genes Bet
v 1.02B and Bet v 1.02C code for Ala143 instead. We iden-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/168

tified an additional variation in the Bet v 1.01D gene from
the tetraploid 'Long Trunk', namely the presence of Arg150
instead of Ser150. The T-cell epitope Bet v 1112–123 is more
variable and contains amino acid variations in the genes
Bet v 1.01B, Bet v 1.01C, Bet v1.02C and Bet v 1.02D (Figure 3).

Discussion
PCR artifacts
When PCR amplification is performed on groups of
closely related sequences, such as the PR-10 gene family,
accurate sequences are essential to distinguish between
members. We used Pfu polymerase, which has proofreading functionality and reduces the number of base substitution error rates. However, previous research has shown
that Pfu polymerase may generate more and more complex recombination artifacts than Taq polymerase [23,24]
through incomplete primer extension and re-annealing to
a different template [25], or strand switching between different templates [26]. Reducing the number of cycles [24]
was an efficient solution to lower the amount of artifacts.

We identified PCR recombination artifacts in several of
our sequences using the computer program Phylpro [27].
The comparison of independent PCRs enabled sequence
validation and exclusion of both recombination and base
substitution artifacts. The high occurrence of recombination artifacts in our experiments (27–46% after 30 PCR
cycles) is not uncommon. For example, Wang and Wang
[28] report 32% recombination artifacts after 30 cycles of
PCR amplification for 16S rRNA genes. The occurrence of
recombinant sequences within a mixture of approximately 15 different sequences is expected to be high,
because almost all recombinations are detected. Half of
the recombinations would, for example, remain undetected if only two templates are present. The presence of 13
genes also increases the amount of template compared to
a single copy gene.
Using the same analysis to detect recombination in GenBank/EMBL/DDJB accessions, we observed a recombination signal in 22 out of 62 (35%) accessions. These are not
necessarily all PCR artifacts, as some recombinations may
have occurred in vivo during evolution of the genes. However, we found only one true recombinant in our dataset
and no evidence of past recombination events in the comparison between sequences from two different species
(within the hybrid). This indicates that the occurrence of
in vivo recombination is probably rare.
Base substitution error rates for mixtures of non-proofreading Taq and proofreading Pfu are approximately 5.6 ×
10-6 under optimal conditions [29]. This error rate is ~2–
4 fold higher when only Taq is used [29,30]. Without confirmation in independent PCRs these errors can not be

excluded and it is very likely that Bet v 1 sequences with
base substitution errors have been deposited into GenBank/EMBL/DDJB. Therefore, not all published isoforms
will be clinically relevant. In addition, the clinical relevance of the isoforms will be influenced by their expression levels. If multiple allergen isoforms exist, there is a
risk for selecting a recombinant isoform with low IgEreactivity as a diagnostic tool, or even selecting isoforms
that resulted from PCR artefacts. We therefore strongly
suggest the use of primers that are highly specific for one
gene [18] or, preferentially, the application of multiple
independent PCRs to facilitate sequence validation in
future sequencing work on allergens.
PR-10 and Bet v 1 genes
The PR-10 gene family of Betula pendula was shown to
encompass at least thirteen genes. This is a conservative
estimate since we used strict inclusion criteria. The distinction between genes is supported by the presence of a distinct intron. Each gene was identified as such in at least
two birch cultivars. We attributed previously described
GenBank sequences to these genes. Alleles from ten identified genes had previously been described [2,10-13],
while we identified three new genes. The genes are
grouped into five subfamilies, based on sequence homologies in the ORF and intron. Differences in transcription
coincide with the division between subfamilies. An organization of PR-10 genes into subfamilies was also reported
for Malus domestica [18] and for Pinus monticola [5].

A striking feature of the PR-10 isoforms in B. pendula is
their homogeneity, which may extend to other Fagales
species, such as alder (Alnus glutinosa) and hazel (Corylus
avellana). The intron has conserved 3' and 5' splicing sites
and is always located at codon 62, as is e.g. reported for C.
avellana and M. domestica [11]. High homogeneity may
result from strong purifying selection or from concerted
evolution. The presence of low Ka/Ks ratios among the isoforms suggests the occurrence of purifying selection. Evidence for concerted evolution is present in the overall
gene tree of the PR-10 family [17]. Concerted evolution
causes genes to evolve as a single unit with members
exchanging genetic information through gene conversion
and unequal crossing-over. Tandemly arranged genes may
have high conversion rates [31], while this is a prerequisite for the occurrence of unequal crossing-over. Most PR10 genes in apple map to two loci and are arranged in a
duplicated cluster [18]. This organization may be a common feature for PR-10 genes. However, as pointed out by
Nei and Rooney [32], the molecular mechanism of gene
conversion is not well understood, and the model of
birth-and-death evolution of genes may also explain the
evolution of the PR-10 gene family. The presence of pseudogenes, although at a low frequency, is therefore of particular interest. An analysis of a species at an intermediate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/168

evolutionary distance, such as C. avellana, would be useful
to clarify which mechanisms determine the evolution of
PR-10 genes and to investigate a possible recent radiation
of PR-10 genes.
The birch genome contains at least seven pollen-expressed
genes that encode a mixture of Bet v 1 isoforms with varying IgE-reactivity. Swoboda et al. [13] found that pollen
mixtures from multiple trees contain multiple Bet v 1 isoforms. We identified 14 different Bet v 1 isoforms in the
three cultivars, nine of which are entirely new. The IgEreactivity has been tested for several isoforms using
recombinant proteins [14]. The allergenicity of the new
isoforms can be examined in the future by expressing the
isoforms as recombinant proteins and use these in a SPT
or T-cell activation tests. Ferreira et al. [14] divided the Bet
v 1 isoforms into three groups according to their IgE-reactivity and confirmed the division between high, moderate,
or low IgE-reactivity in a Skin Prick Test (SPT). One high
and one low IgE-reactive isoform from their analysis were
100% identical to isoforms that we have obtained from a
single tree, while two intermediate IgE-reactive isoforms
differed only by one amino acid from the alleles of two
other identified genes. This strongly suggests that isoforms
of different IgE-reactivity are in fact alleles encoded by different genes. Thus, each examined cultivar has the genetic
background to express a mixture of isoforms with a high,
moderate, and low IgE-reactivity. We plan to confirm this
at the protein level in the near future.
Nomenclature
The nomenclature of Bet v 1 raises several issues. The first
isoforms were termed Bet v 1a to Bet v 1n by Swoboda et
al.[13], but these have subsequently been renamed and
incorporated into the official database of the allergen
nomenclature committee [19]. This database currently
lists 37 allergen isoforms that have been termed Bet v
1.0101 to 1.3101. However, as can be seen from the list of
known isoforms in Table 2, not all published isoforms
have been added to this list, even though several of these
isoforms were obtained from pollen mRNA. On the other
hand, isoforms which have been recovered only from
mRNA from roots and leaves are included as allergens
(Bet v 1.1101 to Bet v 1.1301). Also, several of the
described isoforms are highly suspicious as we observed
clear recombination signals. As a result, the list is a random series of alleles that belong to different genes and has
no biological basis. Similar problems were described for
the Mal d 1 and Mal d 3 allergens by Gao et al. [18,20]. To
allow differentiation between alleles from different genes
for the Bet v 1 alleles we have adopted their system.
Allergenicity of birch trees
The exact isoform composition of the three cultivars differed due to allelic variations. This may result in differ-

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:168

ences in allergenicity between cultivars. However, an exact
copy of the most allergenic allele, Bet v 1a, was present in
all three cultivars. Quantity measurements on expression
indicate that Bet v 1a is the dominant isoform in pollen
[13]. Given that the diversity of Bet v 1 isoforms within a
single tree is larger than the diversity between the examined B. pendula cultivars, a characterization of Bet v 1-type
isoforms should be done in other Betula species as well.
Investigations towards sensitization and immunotherapy
should anticipate that patients are exposed to a mixture of
Bet v 1 isoforms of different IgE-reactivity, even if pollen
originates from a single birch tree. Differences in allergenicity between birch trees may also result from variation
in allergen content. Variation in allergen content has e.g.
been shown for apple [33] and olive pollen [34].
Many Betula species and Betula hybrids have higher
ploidy levels (tetraploid, hexaploid, and even octaploid)
than B. pendula and are likely to contain increased numbers of allergen isoforms, as we found in the tetraploid
cultivar 'Long Trunk'. For example, the tetraploid B. pubescens is dispersed throughout Europe, while other exotic
birch species are increasingly introduced as cultivars, contributing to a larger allergen pool. However, interspecific
Betula hybrids, which have a higher ploidy level, may also
pose a potential source of hypoallergenic trees. Especially
hybrids between less related species often display a
reduced fertility, which may result in a reduced or aborted
pollen production.
If breeding for hypoallergenic trees is implemented,
approaches should take into account that the Bet v 1/PR10 genes may be clustered and differences in allergenicity
between clusters of genes may be used to guide breeding
efforts. Clustering may be determined by mapping studies
[18] and by screening and partial sequencing of a genomic
library. In the genome sequence of Populus [35] we indeed
can observe an organization of PR-10 genes into clusters.
Other approaches to generate hypoallergenic trees may
include the search for sterile or low pollen producing
trees, or the application of RNA interference technology,
which proved to be successful to silence the Mal d 1 allergens in apple [36] without phenotypic abnormalities.
One issue that needs the be resolved is that although birch
PR-10/Bet v 1 proteins have been suggested to act as plant
steroid carriers [37], the exact conditions under which
transcription is induced are still unknown. Given the
abundance of Bet v 1 in birch pollen, silencing may affect
pollen viability. However, for breeding of hypoallergenic
cultivars that are propagated vegetatively this would be
considered a welcome side-effect.

Conclusion
We have shown that the PR-10 gene family of Betula pendula encompasses at least thirteen genes that can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/168

grouped into five distinct subfamilies. Differences in
expression coincide with the division between subfamilies. Genes from two subfamilies were shown to be
transcribed in pollen, based on a high (99.8–100%)
homology with cDNA sequences available in GenBank/
EMBL/DDJB. The seven genes that belong to these subfamilies encode a mixture of Bet v 1 isoforms of varying
IgE-reactivity. The present characterization of the PR-10
family in birch provides a framework for the screening of
Bet v 1 genes among other Betula species or B. pendula cultivars and for potential breeding approaches for birch
trees with a reduced allergenicity.

Methods
Plant material
The natural distribution range of B. pendula Roth (syn. B.
verrucosa) covers almost the whole of Europe. Several B.
pendula cultivars have been bred, including interspecific
hybrids (also referred to as interspecies hybrids) between
B. pendula and other Betula species. We collected young
leaves from three B. pendula cultivars in the collection of
PPO Boskoop (WUR, the Netherlands), namely 'Long
Trunk', 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke', and 'Tristis'. Fresh leaf
samples were sent to Plant Cytometry Services (Schijndel,
The Netherlands) and screened by flow cytometry to estimate the ploidy level. Diploid (B. pendula) and tetraploid
(B. pubescens) controls were included. The cultivars 'Schneverdinger Goldbirke' and 'Tristis' were diploid, while the
cultivar 'Long Trunk' was tetraploid. The latter is likely to
be an interspecific hybrid between B. pendula and a second, unknown, Betula species. The alleles recovered from
'Long Trunk' were either assigned to B. pendula based on
sequence and intron similarity or were considered specific
for this cultivar. The specific 'Long Trunk' alleles were analyzed separately. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
PCR, cloning, and sequencing
PR-10 alleles were amplified from birch DNA with primers designed after two cDNA sequences (X15877,
X77601). The primers were complementary to the regions
around the start and stop codons (shown in bold); BpIFor: 5'-AATCTCTCAGGCCATCATGGGTG-3', BpI-Rev: 5'TAGTTGTAGGCATCGGAGTGTGC-3', BpII-For: 5'-ATCTCAGGTGATCATCATGGGTG-3', and BpII-Rev: 5'-TAGTTGTAGGCATTTGGGTGTGC-3'.

PCR amplification with both primer pairs was performed
with mixtures consisting of 2 μl dNTP (1 mM), 2 μl 10×
Reaction buffer, 0.8 μl MgCl2 (25 mM), 1.2 μl forward
primer (10 pmol/μl), 1.2 μl reverse primer (10 pmol/μl),
0.11 μl of a 1:9 mixture of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene)
and Taq polymerase (Goldstar)(5U/μl), and 20–80 ng
template DNA. H2O was added to obtain a total volume

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:168

of 20 μl. PCR mixtures were subjected to the following
conditions: initial heating step at 95°C for 15 minutes,
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 45 s,
and extension at 72°C for 60s. A final extension step of 10
min at 72°C was added after 22–30 cycles. Given the
observation of recombination among the recovered
sequences, we subsequently varied the number of PCR
cycles at intervals of 2 cycles. The minimum number of
cycles was established by visual inspection of the amplification products on agarose gel at 22 for the BpI primer
pair and at 24 for the BpII primer pair. Originally, 30 PCR
cycles had been used. We repeated the experiment at 22–
24 cycles to ensure that amplification was in its linear
phase.
To obtain the A-tailing that facilitates the ligation procedure, five additional cycles were run on 1–4 μl of PCR
product with Taq polymerase (Goldstar). PCR conditions
were similar as described above. PCR products were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
Purified samples were ligated into the pGEM-T easy Vector
(Promega) and established in Escherichia coli XL1 Blue
competent cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. White colonies were picked from agar
plates and grown overnight at 37°C in freeze medium.
PCR-based screening was performed with vector-specific
M13 primers. PCR products were purified with Sephadex
G-50 (Millipore). The DYEnamic™ ET Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Amersham) was used for the sequence
reaction. Sequence products were analyzed on a 96-capillary system (ABI 3730xl).
Genomic B. pendula sequences have been submitted to
GenBank as DQ296566–DQ296598 and DQ325525–
DQ325535, and the specific 'Long Trunk' sequences as
DQ296599–DQ296610.
GenBank sequences
Sixty-six PR-10 sequences were obtained from GenBank/
EMBL/DDJB by searching with MegaBLAST for entries
from B. pendula with more than 60% sequence identity to
Bet v 1a (X15877). The search results included nineteen
genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences: Z72429–Z72438[11];
AJ001551–AJ001557 (Cvitanich and Larsen, direct submission); AJ289770 and AJ289771 (Pellinen et al, direct
submission). The accessions Z72435-8 were singletons
with a relatively low homology to our and other GenBank
Betula sequences and were excluded from the analysis.
Forty-seven cDNA sequences were found: X15877[2];
X77200, X77265–X77274, X81972, X82028[13];
X77599–X77601[15]; Z80098–Z80106 (Larsen, direct
submission); AF124837–AF124839[12]; AJ002106–
AJ002110, and AJ006903–AJ006915[10].

Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW
[38]. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed with
MrBayes 3.1.1 [39]. The maximum likelihood model
employed 6 substitution types, with base frequencies set
to the empirically observed values. Rate variation across
sites was modeled using a gamma distribution. The
Markov chain Monte Carlo search was run twice with 4
chains for 1,000,000 generations. Topology and model
parameters were sampled every 100th generation and
used to estimate model parameters and to determine the
posterior probabilities of clades. The first 100,000 generations were discarded as "burn in". The outgroup was composed of PR-10 sequences from Prunus armeniaca
(AF020784), P. avium (U66076), Pyrus communis
(AF057030), and Malus domestica (X83672, Z72425,
Z72427). To date, these are the closest non-Fagales relatives of the PR-10 family from B. pendula. We confirmed
the phylogenetic analysis by constructing a neighbourjoining tree with Kimura two-parameter distances. Bootstrapping was carried out with 1,000 replicates. The results
were similar for both analyses; therefore, the results from
the neighbor-joining analysis are not shown.

Based on variation among Mal d 1 alleles of a single locus
compared to alleles of different loci [18], we predefined a
cut-off level of 98% identity in order to identify clusters
that encompass alleles of the same gene. A limitation of
the applied method is that genes that are homozygous
and differ less than 98% from each other remain undetected.
Recombination was detected and visualized with Phylpro
1.0 [27]. This program computes the correlation coefficient of pair wise distances between the target sequence
and all other sequences on both sides of a sequence position. We used a sliding window of 40 base pairs.
Isoforms and allergenicity
Nucleotide sequences were aligned codon-by-codon. We
analyzed general selection patterns at the molecular level
using DnaSp 4.00 [21]. The number of synonymous (Ks)
and non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) per site were calculated from pair wise comparisons with incorporation of
the Jukes-Cantor correction. Nucleotide data were translated into amino acids. Putative isoforms were analyzed
for their potential allergenicity by screening those amino
acid positions that have been identified as influencing the
IgE binding [12,14] and T-cell activation [22].
