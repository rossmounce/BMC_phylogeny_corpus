Abstract
Lassa fever (LF) is a devastating viral disease prevalent in West Africa. Efforts to take on this public health crisis
have been hindered by lack of infrastructure and rapid field deployable diagnosis in areas where the disease is
prevalent. Recent capacity building at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Ward (KGH LFW) in Sierra
Leone has lead to a major turning point in the diagnosis, treatment and study of LF. Herein we present the first
comprehensive rapid diagnosis and real time characterization of an acute hemorrhagic LF case at KGH LFW. This
case report focuses on a third trimester pregnant Sierra Leonean woman from the historically non-endemic
Northern district of Tonkolili who survived the illness despite fetal demise.
Employed in this study were newly developed recombinant LASV Antigen Rapid Test cassettes and dipstick lateral
flow immunoassays (LFI) that enabled the diagnosis of LF within twenty minutes of sample collection. Deregulation
of overall homeostasis, significant hepatic and renal system involvement, and immunity profiles were extensively
characterized during the course of hospitalization. Rapid diagnosis, prompt treatment with a full course of
intravenous (IV) ribavirin, IV fluids management, and real time monitoring of clinical parameters resulted in a
positive maternal outcome despite admission to the LFW seven days post onset of symptoms, fetal demise, and a
natural still birth delivery. These studies solidify the growing rapid diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance
capabilities at the KGH LF Laboratory, and the potential to significantly improve the current high mortality rate
caused by LF. As a result of the growing capacity, we were also able to isolate Lassa virus (LASV) RNA from the
patient and perform Sanger sequencing where we found significant genetic divergence from commonly
circulating Sierra Leonean strains, showing potential for the discovery of a newly emerged LASV strain with
expanded geographic distribution. Furthermore, recent emergence of LF cases in Northern Sierra Leone highlights
the need for superior diagnostics to aid in the monitoring of LASV strain divergence with potentially increased
geographic expansion.
Background
LASV, a member of the Arenaviridae family, is the etiologic agent of LF, which is an acute and often fatal illness endemic to West Africa. There are an estimated
300,000-500,000 cases of LF each year [1-3] with a mortality rate of 15%-20% for hospitalized patients, which
can become as high as 50% during epidemics [4,5] and

~90% in third trimester pregnancies for both expectant
mother and fetus. Presently, there is no licensed vaccine
or immunotherapy available for prevention or treatment
of this disease. The severity of the disease, its ability to
be transmitted by aerosol droplets, and the lack of a
vaccine or therapeutic drug led to its classification as a
National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) Category A pathogen and biosafety level-4
(BSL-4) agent. Several imported LF cases have been
described since 1973, primarily from foreign nationals
displaying signs of the disease upon returning to native

countries or having been evacuated after falling ill
abroad [6-32].
While there is no approved therapeutic for LF, the
antiviral drug ribavirin has been demonstrated to reduce
fatality from 55% to 5%, but only if administered within
6 days of the onset of symptoms [33,34]. The requirement for the drug to be administered at an early stage
of infection to successfully alter disease outcome limits
its utility given that LF has an indolent course and is
difficult to diagnose by symptoms alone, particularly in
the early stages where ribavirin is most effective. There
is no commercially available LF diagnostic assay, which
is a major challenge to early detection and rapid implementation of existing treatment regimens.
Despite the devastating effects of LF in Western African nations, to date, resources have not historically been
available for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of
patients in country. Continuous infrastructure improvements at the KGH LFL by Tulane University, the
Department of Defense (Dodd), and the United States
Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
(USAMRIID) since 2005 have resulted in the implementation of sophisticated diagnostic and research capabilities at the site. Currently, the KGH LFL diagnoses LF
using ELISA and LFI that detect viral antigen (Ag), and
virus-specific IgM and IgG levels in the serum of every
suspected case admitted to the KGH LFW. Additionally,
the laboratory assesses 14 serum analyses using a Piccolo® blood chemistry analyzer coupled with comprehensive metabolic panel disks. Flow cytometry powered
by a 4-color Accrue® C6 cytometer performs immunophenotyping, intracellular and bead-based secreted cytokine analysis. The laboratory produces its own
electricity via a state-of-the-art solar collection and
power generation array funded by a Coypu Foundation
(New Orleans, LA, U.S.A.) grant awarded to Tulane
University, and installed by South Coast Solar, L.L.C.
(Metairie, LA, U.S.A.). Together, these capabilities facilitated the analysis of metabolic and inflammatory functions in real time utilizing the sera of individuals
discussed in this case report with concomitant, appropriate medical intervention. Subsequently, LASV
sequences amplified onsite from the serum of the
afflicted LF patient were partially characterized and seemingly identified a new, significantly divergent variant
of the virus from commonly circulating Sierra Leonean
strains.
The case, a third trimester pregnant woman with
acute hemorrhagic LF, discussed herein was closely
monitored for 13 days during her hospitalization. During this period, her condition stabilized, she delivered a
stillborn fetus, began walking with supervision, completed ribavirin treatment, and was awaiting discharge
pending improved overall health. These studies

contributed to a better understanding of the importance
of and advancement in real time diagnosis and management of Lassa hemorrhagic fever in resource poor, endemic areas of Western Africa, particularly in the most
highly affected subset of patients afflicted by this disease
- late stage pregnant women and their fetuses.

Methods
Objectives

This study aimed to characterize a hospitalized acute LF
case from onset of diagnosis to near full recovery using
advanced rapid diagnostics and state-of-the-art technologies to dissect immune and metabolic responses in real
time at the KGH LFL in Sierra Leone.
Human Subjects

Suspected LF patients, close contacts, and healthy
volunteers were eligible to participate in these studies as
outlined in Tulane University’s Institutional Review
Board (IRB) protocol for this project, National Institutes
of Health/National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases guidelines governing the use of human subject
for research, and Department of Health and Human
Services/National Institutes of Health/National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Challenge and Partnership Grant Numbers AI067188 and AI082119. This
project was approved by the Tulane University IRB. The
patients in this manuscript have given written informed
consent to the publication of their case details. Patient
G-1442 consented to have photographs taken at the
time of admission and was informed that they may be
used for illustrative purposes in scientific publications.
Sera from suspected LF patients and healthy volunteers

Small blood volumes, typically five milliliters (mL) for
serum separation and two mL uncoagulated sample
were collected daily from patient G-1442, with consent
from the attending physician (Donald S. Grant, M.D.),
except on day nineteen. A serum sample obtained from
a 20-year old pregnant woman who succumbed to LF at
the KGH Maternity Ward on August 29, 2010 was used
as positive control. A single sample was collected from
this subject before her expiration and assigned the
coded designation G-1177. Four additional sera from
patients who succumbed to LF at the KGH LFW
between September and December 2010 were also partially characterized (G-1209, G-1220, G-1380, and G1401). One close contact of G-1442 was tested for Ag,
IgM, and IgG and assigned the coded designation G1446. Finally sera from healthy Sierra Leonean volunteers were used as normal controls, and assigned the
coded designations LS0xx. Blood was collected in serum
vacutainer tubes from patients and control donors and
allowed to coagulate for 20 minutes at room

Branco et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:404
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/404

temperature. Serum was separated from coagulated
blood by centrifugation. The serum fraction was collected for analysis and aliquots were stored in cryovials
at -20°C.
Detection of LASV antigen by LFI diagnostic and ELISA

Serum levels of LASV nucleoprotein (NP)-specific Ag
were initially measured using LASV Antigen Rapid Test
cassettes and dipstick LFI currently under pre-clinical
development by Corgenix Medical Corp., Broomfield,
CO, U.S.A. and the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (see acknowledgements). Both Rapid Test strip
designs utilize two NP specific murine monoclonal antibodies (Autoimmune Technologies, L.L.C., New
Orleans, LA, U.S.A.) in a capture and gold-conjugated
detection format. An anti-murine IgG polyclonal antibody is included as a control line. The LASV Antigen
Rapid Test cassettes can detect LASV NP in serum and
plasma. Twenty five μL of sample were added to the
sample well then chased with 100 μL of buffer. Strong
titers could be detected as early as 5 minutes but final
visual interpretation was conducted between 15-25 minutes of development time. The LASV Antigen Rapid
Test dipsticks are similar in construction to the LFI but
include a plasma separation sample pad. Whole blood
from a finger stick or blood collection tubes (EDTA,
citrate) was diluted 1:3 with sample buffer in a test tube
followed by addition of LASV Antigen Rapid Test dipsticks. Alternatively, one drop of whole blood was added
directly to the sample pad, and once the whole blood
absorbed into the plasma separator material, the dipstick
was placed in a test tube containing chase buffer to
initiate strip development. In this format strong titers
could also be detected as early as 5 minutes but final
visual interpretation was conducted between 15-25 minutes of development time. Results were recorded photographically and reflectance scans were taken with a
QIAGEN ESE-Quant GOLD LFI reader (QIAGEN
GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Test line reflectance and
Test to Control ratios (T/C Ratio) were calculated for
each sample, and compared to a curve generated with
recombinant quantified NP spiked into normal human
serum.
The positive LF diagnosis was then confirmed with a
sensitive antigen-capture ELISA employing either a
murine monoclonal or caprine polyclonal capture antibody (Autoimmune Technologies, L.L.C., New Orleans,
LA, U.S.A.) followed by a peroxidase-labeled caprine
reagent and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate.
Capture antibodies were coated in stripwell plates,
blocked, dried, and packaged with desiccating packs
(Corgenix Medical Corp.). A standard curve was generated with recombinant LASV NP for quantitation of
serum levels of virus-associated nucleoprotein by

ELISA. Sera from previously confirmed LF cases were
used as positive controls. Sera from healthy Sierra Leonean and normal U.S. sera panels were used as negative controls. For analysis, sera were diluted 1:10 and
incubated in wells for 60 minutes at 37°C, washed, followed by incubation with optimized HRP-labeled antiLASV NP conjugates for an additional 30 minutes.
After washing, detection was performed with TMB
substrate for 15 minutes at room temperature, stopped
with sulfuric acid, and read at A450 in a BioTek ELISA
plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, U.S.A.). The generation of recombinant full length LASV NP has been
described elsewhere [35].
Detection of LASV-specific serum IgM and IgG levels by
ELISA

Individual recombinant LASV proteins (Vybion, Inc.,
Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) and combinations optimized for
detection of virus-specific IgM and IgG levels in serum
were coated in stripwell plates, as outlined above. The
generation of recombinant mammalian cell-expressed
full length LASV GP1 and GP2 have been described
elsewhere [36]. Bacterially-expressed LASV Z matrix
protein was kindly provided by Dr. Erica O. Saphire,
The Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A. Sera from
suspect and convalescent LF cases previously characterized for LASV antigen-specific IgM and IgG responses
were used as positive controls in respective ELISA formats. Sera from healthy Sierra Leonean volunteers without significant titers against LASV antigens, and normal
U.S. sera panels were used as negative controls. For analysis, sera were diluted 1:100 and incubated in wells for
30 minutes at room temperature, washed, followed by
incubation with optimized HRP-labeled anti-human IgG
or IgM conjugates for an additional 30 minutes. After
washing, detection was performed with TMB substrate
for 10 minutes at room temperature, and read as
described above.
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel analysis

The kinetics of fourteen serum analyses were analyzed
daily using a Piccolo® blood chemistry analyzer (Abaxis,
Inc., Union City, CA, U.S.A.) with Comprehensive Metabolic Reagent Discs, as per manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Cytokine kinetics

Kinetics of eleven serum cytokines were analyzed with
an Accrue C6® benchtop cytometer (Accrue Cytometers
Inc., Ann Harbor, MI, U.S.A.) and an eBioscience FlowCytomix Human Th1/Th2 11-plex Kit (Bender MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Serum aliquots collected
and frozen throughout the timeline were analyzed concurrently at the end of the study.

Branco et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:404

Urinalysis

Ten separate urinalysis tests were performed daily
within 20 minutes of urine collection, except for the last
two days of this study timeline, using a VWR ® Urine
Reagent Strips (VWR, Arlington Heights, IL, U.S.A.).
qPCR

RNA was extracted from serum using QIAmp Viral
RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). RT-PCR
was performed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and qPCR was performed with PerfeCTa SYBR Green (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg,
MD, U.S.A.) using primers 36E2 and 80F2 directed
against the LASV GPC gene [37]. A seed stock of Josiah
LASV strain (kindly provided by Dr. Lisa E. Hensley,
Viral Therapeutics Branch, Virology Division, USAMRIID Diagnostic Systems Division, Fort Detrick, MD, U.
S.A.) was used as a standard for calculating RNA copies
of LASV present in the serum samples.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses

The entire LASV S segment was amplified using primer
CGCACAGTGGATCCTAGGCAT. Standard Sanger
sequencing was then performed using primer G2 targeting the glycoprotein complex (GPC) gene [38]. Alignments from patient G-1442 and 73 partial GPC
sequences were created using Muscle [39] followed by
manual adjustments. A Neighbor-joining tree was created using LASV Pinneo as an outgroup, and bootstrapped over 1000 replicates.
Statistical methods

ELISA data were plotted in MS Excel as mean ± SD, N
= 2, with error bars. Analysis between time points was
performed with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Cytokine levels were calculated by curve fitting analysis of
data generated with quantified standards for each
analyte.

Results
Case presentation

On January 20th, 2011 the KGH Maternity Ward alerted
the LF team of a suspected case from Tongo, lower
Bambara chiefdom in Kenema district, Sierra Leone. A
blood sample was collected and sent to the KGH LFL
for testing. LASV NP antigen LFI diagnostic confirmed
LF within 20 minutes of sample processing (Figure 1).
The patient was a 22-year old pregnant woman, estimated gestational age 32 weeks, who had recently travelled to Tongo from Mabineh 1 village, Kunike
chiefdom, Tonkolili district, northern Sierra Leone
(Additional File 1, Figure 1). She arrived in Tongo on
January 10 th experiencing fever and lower abdominal
pain. She was taken to Tongo Maternal Health Post on

Page 4 of 14

January 15th for observation where she was referred to
KGH on January 19th as a maternity case after failing to
respond to treatment with antibiotics (Ampicillin and
Gentamycin). The KGH Maternity Ward staff suspected
LF upon arrival and referred the case to the LFW and
LFL. This patient was assigned the coded designation G1442, which will be used henceforth.
Case G-1442 presented with symptoms of fever, sore
throat, headache, red eyes, weakness, facial edema, retrosternal pain, generalized abdominal pain, epistaxis and
haemoptysis (Additional File 2, Figure 2). On examination,
her body temperature was 36.5°C, pulse rate of 96 beats/
minute, respiration rate of 26/min, and blood pressure of
90/40 mm Hg (Additional File 3, Figure 3). Respiratory
findings included nasal flaring and bibasal crepitations.
Abdominal findings included a hard uterus that was tender to palpation with an estimated symphysis fundal
height of 30-32 weeks. There was marked epigastric tenderness. Minute bilateral conjunctival hemorrhages were
also noted. The differential diagnosis included probable
LF, pneumonia, and a possible concealed antepartum
hemorrhage (concealed placental abruption).
Travel history and contact tracing

The case patient had travelled from Mabineh 1 to Waterloo (south of Freetown) three weeks prior to her illness.
Upon returning from Waterloo she resided in Massingbi
(a neighboring town to Mabineh 1) for one week before
returning to Mabineh 1. She remained in Mabineh 1 for
five days before departing for Tongo. According to relatives it is estimated that the case patient left Mabineh 1
between January 6th and 8th bound for Tongo (Additional
File 1, Figure 1C). She had no known exposure to an exLF patient or contact with rodents prior to her illness.
However, an assessment of her previous dwelling in
Mabineh 1 revealed evidence of rodent waste, and rat
holes in a structure constructed with mud and with large
open spaces in walls. The patient had not been seen by a
medical professional throughout her pregnancy as nurses
at the Mabineh Health Post could not account for her
visiting the center at anytime over the previous eight
months. The date of onset of LF was recorded as January
13 th , with fever, headache, and lower abdominal pain,
after failure to respond to treatment with anti-malarials.
The patient tested positive for malaria parasites while in
Tongo (verbal communication). The conclusion from the
investigation conducted by the LF outreach team points
to infection with LASV in the northern towns of
Massingbi and Mabineh 1 where the case patient resided
during most of the early stage of the incubation period of
the disease.
Contacts of the case patient were identified and none
have developed symptoms of LF to date. All contacts
were monitored throughout the incubation period

Figure 1 Rapid diagnosis of acute LF virus infection by LFI in patient G-1442. LFI diagnostic (A) and dipstick (B) tests detected LASV NP in
the serum of suspected LF patients. After 15 minutes of development the results were recorded photographically and reflectance scans were
taken as outlined in Methods. A representative normal serum sample analysis from a Sierra Leonean donor (- ctrl) is shown for comparison. Only
the control line developed with this serum sample. Conversely, sera from G-1442 generated a detectable precipitate in the test line, indicative of
LASV NP antigen. The positive control (+ ctrl) was recombinant LASV NP diluted in sample buffer. The LFI diagnostic and dipstick platforms
detected NP antigen on days 7-8. Days 9-12 show no detectable antigen in either format. Test line reflectance and Test to Control ratios (T/C
Ratio) are indicated below each test.

(21 days) from date of last reported exposure. Contacts
were family members from Mabineh 1, nursing staff at
the health clinic in Tongo, and the patient’s brother
who resides in Tongo township. The brother of G-1442,
designated G-1446, with whom she resided while in
Tongo, accompanied her to the KGH and was tested for
LASV antigen, IgM, and IgG. He tested negative for all
three (Figure 2). Testing of G-1446 was prompted by his
close contact with G-1442 in Tongo for 9 days, and
given the hemorrhagic presentation, with vomiting by
the latter at the time of admission to KGH. Additionally,
G-1442’s mother traveled from Mabineh 1 to Kenema to
assist with her daughter’s care during hospitalization at

the KGH LFW. The mother did not develop a fever and
did not feel ill at any time over the course of nearly two
weeks of permanence in Kenema; therefore, she was not
tested for LASV antigen or immunoglobulin levels. The
patient revealed that she travelled from Masingbi to
Tongo by motorcycle over the course of 2 days. The
motorcycle operator was an unidentified male, and
further information on his whereabouts and health status is not known.
The geographical location where G-1442 contracted
LF is of particular importance. In recent months several
cases have been identified by our field research team in
the northern districts of Bombali and Tonkolili

Figure 2 Nucleoprotein, virus-specific IgM and IgG detection by ELISA in G-1442, normal, and contact G-1446 sera. An Ag capture ELISA
was used to detect LASV NP in patient sera (A). LASV NP Ag was not detected in normal sera from Sierra Leonean origin, or in contact G-1446.
The level of LASV NP Ag [blue diamond] in G-1442 dropped significantly during the first 3 days of ribavirin administration, and was undetectable
by day 10. LASV-specific IgM (B) and IgG (C) were assayed in a recombinant ELISA plate format, with individually coated NP, GP1 (sGP1), GP2
(GPCΔTM), or Z proteins. One Sierra Leonean serum registered a high IgG titer to NP (NHS015), whereas the other had moderate IgM titers to NP
(NHS023), but both were negative for IgG and IgM to Z and glycoproteins. NP-specific IgM and IgG levels in G-1442 rose throughout the course
of the illness, through day 20. Contact G-1446 did not have measurable IgG titers, and only registered a low IgM titer to Z. Data are plotted as
mean A450 ± SD, N = -2. The line between day 18 and 20 is dotted to reflect discontinuity on day 19.

Figure 3 Comparison of LASV NP antigen detection by ELISA versus RNA quantification by qPCR. RNA was prepared from serum samples
as outlined in materials and methods. RT-PCR followed by qPCR directed against the GPC gene was performed on days 7-18. A 1:6 dilution
series of Josiah strain seed stock was used as a standard to calculate the LASV RNA copy number per milliliter of serum. PCR data were plotted
on the second Y axis (LASV RNA copies/mL). Error-bars represent the SEM of two independent experiments. NP Ag ELISA data was plotted on
the first Y axis (A450) for trend comparison. Trend lines for NP Ag ELISA (power) and qPCR (exponential), and associated R2 values are indicated.
The limit of detection for antigen by NP Ag ELISA was day 9 (blue arrow), and day 11 for qPCR (red arrow).

(Additional File 1, Figure 1A), which have not been previously considered endemic regions for the illness. Since
the Fall of 2010, however, two cases of severe hemorrhagic LF have been identified in these two northern districts, both with fatal outcomes. In addition, several
other LF cases from the same districts have been confirmed with subsequent treatment at the KGH LFW and
positive outcomes. During the preparation of this manuscript, additional LF cases had been diagnosed at the
Magbeneth Hospital in Makeni using LASV Ag Rapid
LFI diagnostics provided by Tulane University and Corgenix Medical Corporation.
Diagnostic Analysis

A blood specimen collected on patient G-1442’s day of
admission was positive for LASV NP Ag by LFI diagnostic (Figure 1), and by quantitative NP capture ELISA,
with a level of 2.265 μg/mL NP (Figure 2). The LFI platform confirmed acute LF within 20 minutes of sample
collection. IgM levels to recombinant LASV proteins
(NP, GP1, GP2, Z) were determined by ELISA, with low
but detectable levels of immunoglobulin to NP and Z
(Figure 2B). This data suggests the patient was naive to
LASV exposure prior to this incident. Statistically significant levels of low IgM response to GP1 and GP2 were
detected on days 11-20 when compared to naïve negative
controls and G-1142 sera from days 7 - 10 (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2B). Low levels of NP-specific IgG were not

detected until at least day 12 post onset of illness (Figure
2C). During the monitoring period G-1442 did not
develop significant IgG titers against GP1, GP2, and Z.
LASV NP antigen dropped rapidly over 3 days following treatment with ribavirin, and was below the limit of
detection (LOD) of the assay by day 10 in an NP Ag
capture ELISA (Figure 2A). RNA was isolated from
serum on the day of collection and analyzed by qPCR
for amplification of a conserved 300 nt segment of the
LASV GPC gene. PCR confirmed and detected viral
RNA in serum samples at least 2 days beyond the NP
Ag ELISA (Figure 3). Overall, the NP Ag capture ELISA,
LFI diagnostic, and qPCR assay showed the same trend
with decreasing titers of LASV following the start of
ribavirin treatment.
Clinical Chemistry

On presentation to KGH LFW, the liver function panel
revealed highly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >2000 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of
643 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 541 U/L, and
total bilirubin (TBIL) of 35 micromoles per liter (μM/L)
(2.05 mg/dL) (Figure 4). Levels of sodium, potassium,
chloride, calcium, carbon dioxide (TCO 2), blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), and total protein were within or near
normal levels, and albumin was below normal range
(Additional File 4, Figure 4). At presentation the hemoglobin level (Hb) was 12.7 g/dL (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Comprehensive daily Piccolo metabolic panel analysis. Metabolic indicators were measured in the serum of G-1442 daily after
admission, through day 20 (with the exception of day 19), using a Piccolo comprehensive metabolic panel disk array. Two Sierra Leonean
normal controls were also analyzed for comparison (SLN004 and SLN022). Values were plotted alongside normal ranges for each metabolite
(rose boxes), for reference. G-1442 presented with normal BUN, CRE, but elevated TBIL. Analytes ALP, ALT, and AST were highly elevated upon
admission, all indicative of severe liver implication in this LF case. Metabolic indicators in the two healthy Sierra Leonean donors were within
normal ranges. Hemoglobin levels were independently measured in G-1442 on days 7, 9-12, and 14-16 post-onset of disease. The day of stillbirth
delivery is indicated in each panel by a dark red diamond (day 13).

Treatment and hospital course

Intravenous ribavirin was administered upon NP Ag
positive diagnosis by LFI: a loading dose of 30 mg/kg
followed by 15 mg/kg every six hours for four days, followed by 7.5 mg/kg every eight hours for six days.
Amoxicillin, intravenous quinine in 5% dextrose, acetaminophen, and routine vitamins (multivitamin, ferrous
sulphate, folic acid) were commenced upon admission
to KGH. Patient G-1442 developed bleeding from the
oral mucosa on day eight which resolved on day ten.
On day ten she was much improved and was able to
stand unaided. Fetal demise was confirmed with the aid
of a fetal heart Doppler on day twelve. She had an
uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a stillborn fetus on
day thirteen, at which time she was started on ampicillin
and metronidazole. Artesunate was begun on day fifteen.
IV fluid boluses of five percent and 50% dextrose and
Ringer’s Lactate solution were given as needed.
The sodium and chloride levels gradually decreased during the hospitalization period, following IV fluids management, and G-1442 remained hyponatremic between days
13 and 20 and hypochloremic between days 16 and 20.
Creatinine and BUN remained normal during her entire
hospital stay resulting in a BUN:Cr ratio between 10
and 20 except for a transient increase to 24 on day 17
(Figure 4). The ALT declined steadily during hospitalization, and was within normal levels on day 16 (42 U/L) and
through the rest of the monitoring period, while the AST
remained >2000 U/L for three days before declining to
100 U/L on day 20. The ALP remained elevated as well,
decreasing to 259 U/L on day 20. The TBIL initially
increased to 88 μM/L (5.15 mg/dL), before dramatically
declining two days after delivery (day 14) to 32 micromoles per liter (1.87 mg/dL). Bilirubin continued to
decrease over the remainder of the observation period, to
within normal levels between days 16 and 20. The Hb
decreased from an initial normal level of 12.7 g/dL to
between 10.4 and 11.1 g/dL throughout the hospitalization
period (Figure 4B). These Hb levels did not prompt the
doctor to administer a blood transfusion.
Cytokine profiles were performed on serum samples collected daily (Figure 5). G-1442’s IFN-g levels were highly
elevated on the day of admission, but decreased to baseline
levels by the following day and did not rise above normal
levels over the ensuing 12 days of monitoring (Figure 5B).
A significant decrease in IL-6 and IL-10 levels was noted
on day 8, but levels fluctuated throughout the course of
hospitalization. IL-8 levels dropped significantly on days 9
and 10, followed by a spike on day 11, and a steady
decrease thereafter. TNF-b was present at elevated levels
at the time of admission and decreased to near background levels by the following day, but increased significantly and steadily throughout the hospitalization period.
Interleukins -1b, -2, -4, -5, 12p70, and TNF-a were not

Page 9 of 14

detected or were present in the serum of G-1442 at very
low levels at all time points analyzed. On day 20, the last
day of monitoring, all cytokines with the exception of
TNF-b were at or near normal levels. Interleukin-8 and
TNF-a were elevated in one healthy control serum
(LS004) but were within normal levels in the other healthy
control serum (LS022). All other cytokines were at baseline levels in both control sera (Figure 5A, B).
Urinalysis profile

Urinalysis revealed ongoing proteinuria (30 mg/dL) that
peaked on the day of delivery (300 mg/dL) and subsequently decreased (trace to 30 mg/dL). It is unclear
whether proteinuria resulted from LASV infection, pregnancy, or a combination of factors. There was no hypertension to suggest a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The
presence of large blood was noted on all urinalysis results.
Microscopy was not performed to examine for red blood
cells or casts. Bilirubin (small to large) was present prior
to and including the day of delivery, after which time it
was absent, consistent with resolving biliary obstruction as
indicated by the decrease in serum TBIL levels and ALP.
Leukocyte esterase was absent to trace presence prior to
delivery, after which time small to moderate results were
noted. Since analysis was performed on catch specimens,
the possibility of contamination from vaginal fluid after
delivery cannot be excluded. Nitrites were positive on day
18. No symptoms of urinary tract infection were noted
(Additional File 5, Table 1).
Sequencing analysis and strain characterization

In order to get a better idea of the geographical location
of the isolated strain, a 800nt fragment of the GPC gene
from the serum of patient G-1442 was sequenced and
compared to other strains circulating in Sierra Leone
and West Africa. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
LASV from patient G-1442 clustered with other strains
from Sierra Leone, but was significantly different from
all of them, forming its own sub-group (Figure 6). The
strain was only 89% identical to the prototypical Sierra
Leonean LASV Josiah strain at the nucleotide level. In
comparison, we have found other currently circulating
strains from Sierra Leone to be more than 95% identical
to Josiah (Figure 6 and data not shown). This suggest
that a new strain of LASV may be responsible for the
recent outbreak of LF in the North of Sierra Leone,
although more complete sequencing studies are required
to firmly establish this.

Figure 5 Serum cytokine levels analyzed by multiplex Flow Cytometry. Data generated with a Human 11-Plex Inflammatory Cytokine kit
was quantified with Flow Cytomix Pro software, and plotted on linear scales. G-1442 presented with elevated levels of TNF-b(A.), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
and notably IFN-g(B.), all of which decreased by the next day, following initial treatment with ribavirin (day 7, arrow). Cytokine levels were also
measured in normal Sierra Leonean controls, for comparison (LS004, LS022). Significant changes in the cytokine profile were not noted following
delivery of a stillbirth fetus (day 13, arrow).

LF (Additional File 6, Table 2). Patient G-1177’s metabolic and biochemical characterization was described in
detail elsewhere [40]. The chemistries of the two healthy
volunteers were in the normal range as specified by the
manufacturer (Abaxis, Inc.) (Additional File 6 Table 2).
LF patients G-1209, G-1220, G-1380, G-1401, and
G-1177 had extremely abnormal labs prior to expiration
(Additional File 6, Table 2). Along with dysregulated
serum electrolytes, all subjects had a highly elevated
liver panel, and, with the exception G-1380, all had elevated levels of BUN. Additionally, all subjects had low
serum albumin and total protein levels. The cytokine
profiles between healthy volunteers and subjects who
succumbed to LF were largely unremarkable, with the
single exception of IL-10, which was recorded at elevated levels in all cases (Additional File 6, Table 2 and
unpublished data).

Discussion
LASV Ag Rapid Test detected acute LASV infection in
G-1442 within 20 minutes of serum collection and

processing at the KGH LFL (Figure 1). The patient was
immediately transferred from the KGH Maternity Ward
to the LFW upon diagnosis, permitting isolation and
appropriate medical intervention including IV ribavirin
administration, currently the only drug used in viremic
cases of LF. LFI diagnostic detected LASV NP Ag on
the first two days at the KGH LFW (Figure 1), whereas
antigen capture ELISA diagnostic detected the protein
in the serum of G-1442 for three days following admission (Figure 2A). Quantitative PCR extended detection
of LASV RNA sequences for two days beyond the limit
of detection of LASV NP Ag ELISA, thus establishing a
role for each platform from sensitive and rapid point of
care LFI diagnostic to ultrasensitive and time extended
qPCR detection of very low levels of arenaviral RNA in
the blood.
ELISA data suggest that patient G-1442 was naïve to
infection as she presented with very low LASV-specific
IgM to all viral proteins analyzed at 7 days after onset
of symptoms; she then began showing a consistent
increase in NP-specific IgM, and a low level IgM
response against the glycoproteins starting on day 11,
which continued through all days monitored. Only IgG
to NP developed over the analysis timeline (Figure
2C). The predominant, mature, humoral response in
LF is against the viral NP Ag [41-43, unpublished
data].
The metabolic panel of G-1442 as well as a previously
characterized severe hemorrhagic LF case, G-1180, who
also survived [40], show important differences with
patients who succumb to the disease. Despite hepatic
and renal dysfunction during the course of LF infection,
neither patient developed elevated levels of serum CRE,
which are usually associated with a poor outcome [18].
In G-1442 the BUN:Cr ratio remained within normal
levels throughout (10-20:1), with the notable exception
of day 17, when it rose above 20 (24.2). These data suggest that in G-1442 renal function was not significantly
affected by LF. Conversely, G-1177, a late term pregnant
woman diagnosed with LF in August 2010, succumbed
to the disease with a CRE level of 818 μmol/L and a
BUN:Cr of 5.6 prior to expiring, which is indicative of
significant intrarenal damage Additional File 6, Table 2].
Another significant discrepancy between the two pregnant LF cases was the measured levels of AST. In
G-1177 the single sample AST level was zero, whereas
G-1442 had a highly elevated level of AST at the time
of admission (>2,000 U/L), which rapidly resolved over
the course of treatment (Figure 4). Levels of AST are
commonly highly elevated in LF cases, thus the undetectable level in G-1177 may have been indicative of
severe liver failure near the time of expiry and not a
representative hepatic metabolic state in late term pregnancies afflicted by LASV infection. Both surviving

Branco et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:404
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/404

patients, G-1442 and G-1180, showed rapid resolution
of severe hepatic dysregulation, measured by ALP, ALT,
and AST, to within normal or near normal levels at the
conclusion of ribavirin treatment.
At the time of admission G-1442 presented with elevated serum levels of IFN-g, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-b (Figure 5A, B). Elevated IFN-g and IL-6 levels are common
in non-lethal LF and other febrile illnesses alike, but are
highly variable in fatal cases of LF [18,44]. Elevated IL-8
levels have been associated with positive outcomes in
acute LF, but are also common in native Sierra Leonean
healthy controls [44, unpublished data]. Spontaneous
cytokine production in acutely ill and healthy persons
living in endemic areas for Human Immunodeficiency
Virus, Malaria, Yellow Fever, Dengue, and assorted parasitic infections, has been reported [45], thus prompting
evaluation of such immunomodulatory molecules in the
context of specific disease states. Measurable and sustainable levels of TNF-b in G-1442 are a distinguishing
feature among the LF cases characterized to date. Detection of TNF-b in G-1442 but not in any of the approximately 100 additional LF patients analyzed in our
studies thus far (unpublished data) may represent a rare
immunological response to the febrile illness, may be
associated with the pregnant status of this patient, may
have manifested because of a response to a co-infecting
pathogen, or may be a combination of factors. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was elevated in G-1442’s
serum throughout the treatment period. Interleukin-10,
a stimulator of B cell maturation and antibody production, is commonly recorded in LF patients when IgM
and IgG responses to LASV antigens emerge [18,44],
irrespective of outcome. Interleukin-1b was not detected
in G-1442 throughout the course of recovery from LF.
This observation generally contrasts with previous LF
studies showing that IL-1b was significantly elevated in
non-fatal versus fatal LF and non-LF febrile illness, but
not in healthy controls [44].
Patient G-1442’s test results, in conjunction with those
obtained for G-1180 [40], strengthen the hypothesis, as
previously proposed by others, that an imbalance
between pro- and pre-inflammatory cytokines plays an
important role in the development of Lassa hemorrhagic
shock, with poor outcome [18,44]. As observed with G1180, the marked absence of TNF-a, a potent inducer
of endothelial damage via apoptosis [46] and thrombocytopenia [47], throughout the monitored course of G1442’s illness, suggests a regulated and effective immune
response at play. These studies also suggest that lack of
specific physiological responses, e.g. elevated TNF-a,
serum CRE, and BUN levels, may be relevant, early predictors of outcome in hemorrhagic LF. It is also noteworthy that G-1442 did not present with high core
temperature, which remained at or below 36.5°C

Page 12 of 14

throughout the acute phase of the illness despite a febrile diagnosis (Additional File 3, Figure 3) and high IFNg levels (Figure 5B). Her body temperature then fluctuated between 36°C and 37.5°C from day 15 onward.
Together, these data strengthen the potential for
increased positive outcomes in cases of severe hemorrhagic LF. More importantly, it outlines the possibility
of adequate disease management with positive outcome
in third trimester pregnancies, particularly for the
mother [48]. Despite severe and prolonged multi-organ
dysregulation, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine upand down-regulation, management of a 32 week-pregnancy, a stillbirth delivery, and overall poor health,
patient G-1442 was recovering well on day 20 and was
discharged on day 25. A quick diagnosis of acute LF followed by prompt treatment with IV ribavirin, IV fluids
management, maintenance of electrolyte balance to
counter hypovolemia, hemorrhagic shock, malnutrition,
and adequate control of secondary infections, even 7
days post onset of symptoms in a severe case of the illness, can meet with a positive outcome.
Additionally, this study highlights the emergence of LF
cases in the northern districts of Sierra Leone, where the
disease has not been widely reported or identified.
Recent collaborative efforts with staff at the Magbeneth
Hospital in Makeni includes beta-testing of LASV Ag
Rapid Test LFI diagnostic modules, community sensitization, and prompt reporting of antigen positive LF
diagnoses to the KGH LFW for patient transport, isolation, and treatment and may be a contributing factor to
the elevated number of reported cases in northern Sierra
Leonean districts. With promising new diagnostics, we
are able to both enhance care of patients in the clinical
setting and increase our understanding of the range and
impact of this devastating disease. The continuous capacity building at the KGH LFL also permits real time
analysis of viral RNA levels by qPCR, cDNA generation,
followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Although more extensive studies will be required
before confirming the emergence of new LASV strains,
particularly in the historically non-endemic northern
districts of Sierra Leone, sequencing efforts in this case
point to divergence of circulating strains throughout the
country, with possible widening in geographical
distribution.
