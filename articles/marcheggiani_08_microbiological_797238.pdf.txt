Abstract
Background: Microbiological indicators are commonly used in the assessment of public health risks associated
with fecal contamination of freshwater ecosystems. Sediments are a reservoir of microorganisms, and can thus
provide information on past pollution events, not obtainable through the testing of surface water. Moreover,
pathogens present in sediment may represent future threats to human health. Clostridium perfringens, a typical
colonizer of sediments, has been suggested as an alternative indicator of fecal pollution. In order to be suitable
for such purpose, the microorganism should be widely distributed in contaminated environments. The objective
of this study was thus to determine the composition of the anaerobic community in sediment samples of the lower
Tiber basin, in central Italy, through a combined approach involving granulometric analysis of sediment samples,
as well as a microbiological and molecular (16S rRNA) analysis of strains.
Results: Granulometry showed a similar, clayey sediment composition, in most sampling sites. The
microbiological method, employing, an adaptation of the standard method, proved to be effective in isolating
anaerobic bacteria from the environmental matrix for the purpose of genetic analysis. Eighty-three strains of
bacteria were isolated and the partial 16S rRNA gene sequenced. While biochemical analysis detected only C.
perfringens strains, phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of three clusters: C. perfringens, C. bifermentans and
B. cereus, comprising eight taxa. C. perfringens, the commonest in almost all sediment sampling sites, was present
in all sites, and in both seasons (seasonal sampling was carried out only along the Tiber and Aniene rivers). None
of the described genetic profiles showed complete similarity with GenBank sequences.
Conclusion: The study underlines the value of C. perfringens as an alternative microbial indicator of fecal
contamination in river sediments. This is supported by the bacterium's presence in all sampling sites, and in both
seasons, coupled with its detectability using commercial diagnostic kits.
The study also illustrates the presence of an anaerobic community of considerable biodiversity in the lower Tiber
basin, with C. perfringens as its main component. The 16S rRNA analysis, while confirming the phylogenetic
relationships among isolated species, also showed haplotype patterns different from those present in the NCBI
database.

Background
Wastewater effluents play an important role as sources of
fecal contamination in freshwater environments. These
nonpoint sources of fecal pollution are broadly distributed in both urban and agricultural areas. Standard-based
water quality assessment is an essential component of
monitoring programs for the protection of human health.
Microbiological indicators such as total coliforms, fecal
coliforms and fecal streptococci are widely used both in
monitoring programs of this kind [1,2] and in human
health risk assessment [3,4]. These indicators may also
point to the presence of other non-bacterial pathogens
such as enteric viruses and parasitic protozoans [5,6]. Several studies have highlighted the value of sediments as
indicators of pollution. Indeed, sediments – as potential
reservoirs for bacteria and viruses in aquatic environments
– are able to provide information on past pollution events
no longer detectable in water samples, as well as on the
presence of pathogens, which may in some cases pose a
future threat to human health.
The higher occurrence of microbial indicators of fecal contamination in sediments as compared to other aquatic
environments has been attributed to the sorption of
microorganisms onto particles suspended in water, which
subsequently settle to the bottom [7-10] and accumulate.
Various authors observed higher microbial survival rates
in sediment as compared to other aquatic environments,
possibly due to the absence of abiotic (UV radiation,
salinity, toxic agents) and biotic factors (predation, parasitism, low nutrient availability), which, in surface water,
act synergistically to inhibit bacterial growth [11-17]. Others showed higher rates of microbial activity in the sediment surface layer, which is commonly rich in organic
matter and thus able to provide suitable habitats for different strains of anaerobes [18,19].
The occurrence of anaerobic microorganisms in freshwater environments is generally linked to the input of sewage
outfalls. Some of these organisms are able to survive
adverse environmental conditions by forming resting cells
(spores) [20,21]. Clostridium perfringens, a Gram-positive
anaerobic spore-forming bacterium of the genus Clostridium, has been suggested [22-28] and successfully used as
an alternative indicator of fecal contamination in aquatic
environments due to its wide distribution in nature and to
its adaptation to a variety of habitats such as soils, sediments and sewages. Moreover, this organism has been
found in air, dust, water, and even food [29,30]. Spores
produced by this organism are very resistant to disinfection and their presence in filter units indicate treatment
inefficiencies [31].
Studies of C. perfringens in freshwater ecosystems have
been fewer than those performed on marine environ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/171

ments. Robles et al. confirmed the value of C. perfringens as
a conservative indicator of fecal contamination from sewage disposal in high-mountain lakes [32]. Sorensen et al.
were able to detect traces of unfiltered sewage in small
streams by comparing the concentrations of C. perfringens
spores downstream from wastewater treatment plants
[33].
Although the World Health Organization recommends C.
perfringens as a useful indicator of fecal pollution in water
quality surveys [34], this microorganism has been
adopted in Europe exclusively as an additional source of
water quality information [35-37].
The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene has been widely used
as a phylogenetic marker to study genetic relationships
between different strains of bacteria (phylogeny). The
analysis of this gene can therefore be considered a standard method for the identification of bacteria at the family,
genus and species levels [38-44], and has in fact been
included in the latest edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [45].
The objective of this study was to determine the composition of the anaerobic community in sediment samples of
the lower Tiber catchment area, in central Italy, through a
combined approach involving granulometric analysis of
sediment samples, followed by microbiological and
molecular (16S rRNA) analyses of bacterial strains isolated from these samples.

Results
Sediments and microbiological analysis
With the exception of samples collected from one of the
tributaries, the Farfa river, the granulometric composition
of all samples was mostly clayey (Table 1).

The microbiological method used in this study has
allowed us to isolate 83 strains of anaerobic bacteria from
the sediment samples. To ensure successful growth of colonies, each sample was tested in three suspension aliquots. Replicate sets yielded similar bacterial colony counts
(CFU per gram of dry weight). The biochemical test was
able to detect isolated strains of C. perfringens, but not
other species within the genus.
Analysis of 16S rRNA fragments
Eighty three PCR products derived from Gram-positive
sulphite-reducing bacteria collected in this study were
aligned and matched against NCBI database sequences for
the closest phylogenetic neighbors. The resulting phylogenetic tree, based on the neighbor-joining method, is given
in Fig. 1. Thirty one haplotypes were observed (Table 2),
with a total of 202 variable sites, of which 180 were
informative. The transition/transversion (ti/tv) ratio was
1.1. Base frequencies were as follows: A = 0.261, C =
0.216, G = 0.312 and T = 0.211. The higher frequency of
G corresponds to what is generally observed among sporeforming bacteria.

All phylogenetic analyses clearly assigned the bacteria to
one of three main clusters of anaerobic bacteria: C. perfringens (I), C. bifermentans (II) and B. cereus (III), grouped
into two genuses (Clostridium and Bacillus). Cluster I
included the taxa C. perfringens, C. barati, C. thiosulfatireducens and C. butyricum, and cluster II included C. bifermentans, C. glycolicum and C. ghoni. The only member of
cluster III was B. cereus, with a haplotype presenting a 26bp insertion at position 78 in our alignment set. A Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [46,47] plot based on the
HKY (Hasegawa Kishino Yano) model [48] revealed a
marked heterogeneity within the first cluster, along the
third dimension (Fig. 2). The haplotype corresponding to
C. thiosulfatireducens appeared to be the most distant
within its cluster, with a genetic distance value of 0.117.
The haplotype corresponding to C. barati appeared to be
the closest to C. perfringens, with a distance value of 0.045.
Genetic distances between the members of the second
cluster ranged from 0.04 to 0.05. As for the third cluster,
B. cereus diverged from the other groups, with distance
values between 0.39 and 0.29. Mean distance values
between the main groups are given in Table 3.
None of the genetic profiles described in this study
showed complete similarity with those previously published in the NCBI database, with similarity scores ranging
between 0.95 and 0.99.
The geographical and frequency distribution of the eight
taxonomic units identified is given in Fig. 3. C. perfringens
was found to be the most prevalent in all but one of the
sampling sites, accounting for between 33% and 100% of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/171

anaerobic beacteria identified. As expected, more biodiversity was observed downstream than upstream, both
along the stem of the Tiber and along its tributaries. The
nucleotide sequence data reported in this study have been
deposited in the NCBI (GenBank) database [accession
numbers EF153846 to EF153928].

Discussion
The rate of pollution of the Tiber river increases considerably downstream, with the growing exploitation of its
waters for agricultural, urban and industrial activities. The
quality of the river's water decreases remarkably after its
confluence with its main tributary, the Aniene river, in the
city of Rome. Despite several measures taken in order to
reduce the impact of human activities on the Tiber ecosystem, illegal sewage discharge persists in a number of locations, attesting to severe human pressures and water
mismanagement. The study of microbial indicators of
pollution in sediment, rather than water, could contribute
valuable information concerning factors affecting freshwater ecosystems. Sediments may prove useful in this
respect, in that they "trap" pollutants and constitute a
favourable habitat for various anaerobic bacteria.
Preliminary efforts, involving the application of published protocols [49-51], such as the Most Probable Number
(MPN) and the Membrane Filtration (MF), entailed several
problems, due to the growth of atypical colonies, which
interfered with the growth of spore-forming microorganisms. To avoid this inconvenience, we implemented an
adaptation of the standard protocol, described in the
Methods section. As noted above, each sample was tested
in three suspension aliquots yielding similar bacterial
counts, which attests to the validity of the method
employed. This adaptation allowed us to successfully isolate 83 strains of anaerobic bacteria from our sediment
samples.
Subsequent genetic analysis assigned the bacteria to one
of three clusters: C. perfringens, C. bifermentans and B.
cereus. The biochemical test, on the other hand, was able
to detect isolated strains of C. perfringens, but not other
species within the genus. The low efficiency of the biochemical analysis on the samples collected is probably
related to the fact that commercial kits are specifically
developed on the basis of the metabolic pathways of clinical strains, and therefore cannot be as selective in discriminating environmental species. It is noteworthy,
however, that such kits were able to detect the most frequently present and widely spread bacterium – C. perfringens.
The combined application of both microbiological isolation and selection of specific primers for the 16S rRNA
gene provided a suitable tool for the detection of the sul-

phite reducing bacteria present in the layers of sediment
of the lower Tiber river basin.
The primers used for PCR amplification are efficient only
if, before microbiological analysis, samples are submitted
to heat treatment, to inactivate vegetative forms of bacteria. The crucial role of such treatment emerged in a recent,
yet unpublished study, in which we found a clear association between the efficiency of the primers and preliminary
heat treatment of environmental samples.
Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the previously
described heterogeneity within the genus Clostridium [5254]. The lack of complete similarity between the genetic
profiles found in this study and those present in the NCBI
database could be attributed to the former being typical of
the geographic region of the lower Tiber basin. Additional
comparisons with strains originating from other watersheds remain necessary, however, both in order to confirm the exclusivity of the Tiber haplotypes and to
evaluate their geographic ranges.
The greater microbial biodiversity observed in samples
collected in early autumn seems to be related to seasonal
water regimes and temperature fluctuations. Higher temperatures generally promote eutrophication and thus the
establishment of anaerobic conditions. The input of sewage is generally enhanced by a higher frequency of rainfall
during this season, which is generally followed by unpredictable increments in pollutants that are partly adsorbed
by the sediment matrix. The effects of such events on
water macrofauna, notably in the form of high fish mortality, are particularly evident following heavy rainfalls.
These events can promote the development of suitable
habitats for the growth of different species of anaerobes.
Further studies should therefore be conducted in order to
detect possible relationships between outfall types and
the composition of anaerobic microbial communities in
river sediments.
The ability of sediment to record former pollution events
and the pathogenic nature of sulphite-reducing sporeforming bacteria such as C. perfringens, underscore the

importance of bacteriological analysis of sediment for the
purposes of microbiological risk assessment of inland
water ecosystems [55].

Conclusion
This study underlines the value of Clostridium perfringens
as a microbial indicator of fecal contamination in river
sediments. The presence of this bacterium in all sediment
sampling sites, as well as in both seasons (along the main
stem of the Tiber, where samples were collected seasonally), combined with the fact that it was the only anaerobic bacterium detectable using commercial biochemical
diagnostic kits, lend support to its suitability as an alternative indicator of fecal pollution in water quality surveys.
While further studies are still needed to explore possible
relationships between the presence of specific microorganisms in sediments and the effects of such pollution on
human health, one may safely assume that sulphitereducing bacteria – being useful sources of information –
are destined to play a key role in the management of freshwater environments. Moreover, information derived from
the analysis of sulphite-reducing bacteria in river sediments may prove valuable in water reclamation plans. In
this context, the information may be used for purposes
such as the evaluation of health risks in a given area, or
quality control, to ensure that the health of the water ecosystem in question has in fact been restored or improved.
Although quantitative analysis on the densities of sulphite
reducing clostridia in the sediments were not performed
in this work, however the qualitative molecular tools
employed for the identification of bacteria proved
extremely useful not only in confirming the value of C.
perfringens as a possible bacterial indicator of fecal contamination, but also in allowing the identification of
genetic relationships between species. Further quantitative studies will be useful in order to state the suitability of
this group of bacteria as indicators. Despite the usefulness
of qualitative molecular tools, however, these cannot currently replace classical methods of routine water quality
assessment, the latter being quantitatively more informative and easier to execute. An alternative, faster molecular

of sequence used in BLAST search

Thirteen sampling sites were selected, four along the main
stem of the Tiber, four along the Farfa, four along the Treja
and one along the Aniene (Table 4). The aim was to allow
a comparison of the microbial community composition
in sediments upstream and downstream of the city of
Rome Sediment samples were collected seasonally from
February 2002 to June 2003 for all sites located along
Tiber River and Aniene tributarie while sites along Treja
and Farfa were sampled only during the hot season. Sampling was performed using a bucket attached to a winch,
that was immersed at a depth of between 1 and 3 meters
below the water surface. Samples were transported and
stored in sterile 50 ml tubes, at 4 °C [57]. Granulometric
characterization was performed on each sediment sample,
based on the different sedimentation speeds of silt, clay
and sand particles [58,59].
Isolation of bacteria
Five grams of sediment from each sample were suspended
in 45 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
[K2HPO4 3 g/ml, KH 2PO4 1 g/ml, NaCl 8,5 g/ml; (pH 7,2
± 0,2)] + 0.1% Tween 80. Three replicates were used for

each sample. Suspension samples were then homogenized on a magnetic stirrer (Heidolph, MR 3001) for 30
minutes in order to break up clumps of bacteria. The samples were heat-shocked at 80–85°C for 10 minutes before
cultivation, so as to inactivate vegetative bacteria and
enhance sporulation. Five ml of the spore-containing suspension was diluted (1:10) with sterile PBS, in 15 ml Falcon vials (BD, USA). For optimal growth, we adopted the
following plating technique: 8 ml of SPS (Sulphite Polymixine Sulphadiazine Agar, Oxoid) medium culture was
placed in Petri dishes with a 1 ml aliquot of diluted suspension, and incubated in an anaerobic jar equipped with
a manometer and a CO2 generator, at 36 ± 1°C for up to
24 hours. Black colonies characteristic of anaerobic bacteria appeared.
Colonies were counted directly, and the results expressed
as colony-forming units per gram of dry weight of sediment (CFU/gss). In order to calculate dry weight, about
five grams of sediment were weighted and dried, in triplicate, at 120 ± 1°C for 12 hours. The procedure was
repeated until a stable weight was reached.

After counting, colonies were transferred into new plates
with TSA (Tryptone Soya Agar, Oxoid) medium and incubated in anaerobic conditions as described above. Single
colonies were isolated from each of the three replicates
and resuspended in sterile water for DNA extraction. Biochemical identification of strains was then performed
using API 20A Strips (Biomerieux, France) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Positive and negative controls were used to validate the
microbiological method. A negative control was generated as follows: after sterilization at 121°C for 15 min,
five grams of sediment were suspended into 45 ml of sterile PBS, then plated in medium culture as described
above. The same procedure, followed by in vitro infection
with C. perfringens (ATCC 12918), was used to generate a
positive control.
Microbiological analyses and genome extractions were
performed within 24 hours from sampling; extracted

DNA were redissolved in sterile water, aliquoted in small
volumes and stored at -80°C until use. All molecular
experiments were completed within six months from
extraction.
DNA extraction and 16S ribosomal RNA amplification
One and a half ml of microbial suspension was pelleted
by spinning at 6000 rpm for 5 min. Extraction of nucleic
acids was carried out following the method described in
Ausubel et al. [60]. The pellets were resuspended in 570 μ1
TE buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, (pH 8)] and the
suspension mixed with 80 μl CTAB/NaCl solution (10%
CTAB in 0.7 M NaCl), 30 μl of 10% SDS and 3 μl of Proteinase K (20 mg μ/ml), and incubated at 55°C for 10
min.

An equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1) was added, and the mix was centrifuged at
17000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were transferred to
new tubes, washed with 1 volume of chloroform/isoamyl

alcohol (24:1) and spinned at 17000 rpm for 5 min.
Supernatants were again transferred to new tubes and
DNA precipitated at -20°C with two equivalent volumes
of 95% ethanol for 30 min. After precipitation pellets
were washed with 70% ethanol, dried in a thermoblock at
40°C, and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mM TE buffer. A
701 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA coding region was selectively amplified with two primers: 728 forward (5'GGGGAATATTGCACAATGG-3') and 729 reverse (5'GGGACTTAACCCAACATCTCA-3').
Primers
were
designed (using Primer3 software) [61], so as to anneal to
conserved positions of different Clostridium species published on the NCBI database (accession numbers:

In particular the forward primer anneal at position 351–
371 and the reverse primer at position 1047–1060 of
accession number NC_003366 (Clostridium perfringens str.
13, complete genome, GeneID: 988236). Annealing temperature was calculated by the Primer 3 software. The final
concentrations of PCR reaction components were: 10 mM
PCR Buffer [Tris-HCl (pH 8.8)], 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 0,2 mM of the two primers, 1 U Taq polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
The PCR reaction was performed in a Personal cycler
(Biometra T4, Göttingen, Germany), under the following
conditions: an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 57°C
for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 60 s. The reaction was
terminated with a 10-min final elongation step at 72°C. A
negative control (sterile deionized water) and a positive
control (C. perfringens genomic DNA) were included in
the experiment to confirm the validity of results.
PCR products (5 μl of each reaction mixture) were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, in TBE (Tris
Borate EDTA) buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 90 mM boric
acid, 1 mM Na2EDTA), with ethidium bromide staining
(10 mg/ml), at 90 V for 1 h.
Partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene
Before sequencing, unincorporated nucleotides and primers were removed from PCR products using the Promega
DNA Purification System (Madison, WI, USA), following
the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing reaction was
prepared using the CEQ 2000 Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing with the Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, USA), and was performed in a Personal cycler
(Biometra T4, Göttingen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were generated
with a Beckman 3000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) and analyzed using Chromas 2.23 software
(Technelysium Pty Ltd, Tewantin, Australia). BLAST
searches were performed for each of the sequences
obtained, to find its closest phylogentic neighbors.

Sequences alignment and analysis
The partial sequences of 16S rRNA genes obtained in this
study were aligned to each other using ClustalX software,
version 1.81 [62,63]. Phylogenetic relationships were
inferred by the neighbor-joining method [64] using the
phylogenetic inference software Paup*, version 4.0 [65].
The evaluation of the most appropriate model of
sequence evolution was computed using ModelTest version 3.0 [66]. For the 16S rRNA gene, this resulted in the
selection of the HKY85 + G model. Genetic relationships
were also plotted by non-metric multidimensional scaling
(MDS) using SYSTAT 9.0 software (SPSS-SCIENCE),
which provides an ordering of n variables on a similarity/
dissimilarity matrix by means of n points in a three
dimensional space [Figure 2].
Accession numbers of 16S rRNA sequences
The 83 nucleotide sequences reported in this paper have
been deposited in the GSDB, DDBJ; EMBL and NCBI
nucleotide sequence databases under accession nos.
