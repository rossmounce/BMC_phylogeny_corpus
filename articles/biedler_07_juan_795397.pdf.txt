Abstract
Background: In contrast to DNA-mediated transposable elements (TEs), retrotransposons,
particularly non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons (non-LTRs), are generally considered to
have a much lower propensity towards horizontal transfer. Detailed studies on site-specific nonLTR families have demonstrated strict vertical transmission. More studies are needed with nonsite-specific non-LTR families to determine whether strict vertical transmission is a phenomenon
related to site specificity or a more general characteristic of all non-LTRs. Juan is a Jockey clade
non-LTR retrotransposon first discovered in mosquitoes that is widely distributed in the mosquito
family Culicidae. Being a non-site specific non-LTR, Juan offers an opportunity to further investigate
the hypothesis that non-LTRs are genomic elements that are primarily vertically transmitted.
Results: Systematic analysis of the ~1.3 Gbp Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) genome sequence suggests
that Juan-A is the only Juan-type non-LTR in Aedes aegypti. Juan-A is highly reiterated and comprises
approximately 3% of the genome. Using minimum cutoffs of 90% length and 70% nucleotide (nt)
identity, 663 copies were found by BLAST using the published Juan-A sequence as the query. All 663
copies are at least 95% identical to Juan-A, while 378 of these copies are 99% identical to Juan-A,
indicating that the Juan-A family has been transposing recently in evolutionary history. Using the
0.34 Kb 5' UTR as the query, over 2000 copies were identified that may contain internal promoters,
leading to questions on the genomic impact of Juan-A. Juan sequences were obtained by PCR, library
screening, and database searches for 18 mosquito species of six genera including Aedes,
Ochlerotatus, Psorophora, Culex, Deinocerites, and Wyeomyia. Comparison of host and Juan
phylogenies shows overall congruence with few exceptions.
Conclusion: Juan-A is a major genomic component in Ae. aegypti and it has been retrotransposing
recently in evolutionary history. There are also indications that Juan has been recently active in a
wide range of mosquito species. Furthermore, our research demonstrates that a Jockey clade nonLTR without target site-specificity has been sustained by vertical transmission in the mosquito
family. These results strengthen the argument that non-LTRs tend to be genomic elements capable
of persistence by vertical descent over a long evolutionary time.

Background
TEs, or mobile genetic elements, are integral components
of the eukaryotic genomes. Because they have the ability to
replicate and spread in the genome as primarily "selfish"
genetic units [1], TEs tend to occupy significant portions of
the genome [2]. Recent evidence suggests that the "selfish"
property may have enabled TEs to provide the genome with
potent agents to generate tremendous genetic and genomic
plasticity [3]. TEs transpose through either RNA-mediated
or DNA-mediated mechanisms [4]. DNA-mediated TEs
generally transpose by a cut-and-paste process, directly
from DNA to DNA. RNA-mediated TEs transpose by a replicative process that involves transcription, reverse transcription, and integration of cDNA molecules. TEs in this
category include the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, non-LTRs, or long interspersed nuclear elements
(LINEs), and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs).
It has been proposed in models of the lifecycle of DNAmediated TEs [5-7] that most TEs will eventually become
inactivated in a given species, which underscores the
importance of horizontal transfer for TE survival, a mechanism that allows TEs to invade a naïve genome. Horizontal
transfers DNA-mediated TEs are well documented [8-10].
There have also been cases of non-LTR horizontal transfer
proposed [11-16], the most convincing case involving RTE
clade elements [11,15,16]. RTE non-LTRs were first found
in C. elegans and encode a single open-reading frame (ORF)
containing reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities [17]. In contrast, it has been argued that there is no reliable evidence of non-LTR horizontal transfer between
eukaryotes in the last 600 million years according to age vs.
divergence analysis [18,19]. Research involving arthropod
R1 and R2 families, which are site-specific non-LTRs that
insert into 28S ribosomal RNA genes, shows vertical inheritance of these elements since the origin of the Drosophila
melanogaster species subgroup, approximately 17–20 million years ago (MYA) [20]. Even multiple lineages have
been found to coexist in the rRNA loci and be maintained
by vertical descent [21]. Other studies on R1 and R2 lineages concluded that they have been vertically transmitted
since the inception of the Drosophila genus, approximately
60 MYA or longer [22,23]. The site-specificity of R1 and R2
may result in a bias toward vertical transmission as site-specificity could offer a "safe haven", protecting the genome
from deleterious insertions elsewhere.
Juan-A, a Jockey clade non site-specific non-LTR from Ae.
aegypti has been reportedly involved in potential horizontal
transfer between the non-sibling species Ae. albopictus and
Ae. polynesiensis [24]. However, Crainey and colleagues [25]
recently suggest that vertical transmission explains the evolutionary relationship between Juan elements in Ae. aegypti,
Ae. albopictus, and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (herein
referred to as C. quinquefasciatus). They also did not find

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/112

evidence to support horizontal transfer of CR1 clade elements Q and T1 in mosquitoes, although an earlier report
suggested horizontal transfer could conceivably explain the
identities and distributions of CR1 families in diverse taxa
[26]. Here we report a detailed evolutionary study of Juan
in the mosquito family Culicidae. Sequences of full-length
Juan elements have been reported from the yellow fever
mosquito Ae. aegypti [24] and the house mosquito C. quinquefasciatus [27]. In this study, we have obtained sequences
of Juan elements from 18 mosquito species of six genera.
Our results support that non-LTRs are able to sustain their
activity over long periods of evolutionary time relying primarily on vertical transmission while not excluding the
possibility of rare horizontal transfer. Our whole-genome
analysis suggests that Juan-A has been retrotransposing
recently in evolutionary history, and it occupies approximately 3% of the Ae. aegypti genome. We have also discussed the potential evolutionary impacts of Juan-A in the
Ae. aegypti genome.

Results
Juan in Aedes aegypti: abundance and recent activity
Juan-A contributes significantly to the genome size of Ae.
aegypti, determined to be approximately 3% by RepeatMasker (see Methods). A highly variable copy number is found
depending on what query region and identity criteria are
used (Figure 1, Table 1). Juan-A appears to be the only Juantype element in Ae. aegypti. After masking the genome
sequence for Juan-A (80% nt identity) with RepeatMasker
[28], tBLASTn [29] with Juan-A amino acid (aa) sequence
was used to identify closely related families. The two closest
families found, AaJockeyEle4 and AaJockeyEle6 have
approximately 37% aa identity to Juan-A in the same region
used for phylogenetic inference (Figure 1, Figure 2B).

AaJockeyEle4 and AaJockeyEle6 are part of divergent Jockey
clade families, not Juan-type elements (Figure 2B).
Analysis of Juan-A in Ae. aegypti reveals that the family
has undergone recent amplification, evidenced by a high
degree of homogeneity between copies (Table 1). We have
chosen to look at groups of sequences having various
identities to the Juan-A query to obtain a more comprehensive picture of Juan evolution in the genome. Using
lower identity criteria should allow the identification of
both older retrotransposed copies as well as copies from
more divergent Juan-A-related sequences. There are 663
copies of full-length or nearly full-length Juan-A, defined
as having at least 90% length and at least 70% nucleotide
identity compared to the 4.7 kb published Juan-A
sequence. All 663 copies are at least 95% identical to JuanA, suggesting that there are no divergent subgroups
among these nearly full-length Juan elements. Three hundred seventy-eight of the 663 copies are 99% identical to
Juan-A, indicating that the Juan-A family has been transposing recently in evolutionary history. There is no appreciable difference in copy numbers between using 80% and
70% nt identity cutoffs (Table 1). As stated in the Methods, many gaps exist (36206 contigs) in the Ae. aegypti
genome sequence assembly. We did not determine how
many Juan-A copies were truncated by these gaps so it is
possible that many more full-length copies exist in the
genome. In addition, we used a gap parameter value of 50
bp for our BLAST processing program. Therefore, Juan
sequences with insertions of over 50 bp are not counted
as full-length sequences.
We also used 5' and 3' end regions as queries to get a general impression of Juan representation and activity in the
genome. A higher number of 5' ends were found than 3'
ends when looking at those copies that had greater than
97% identity to the query, a curious result. Using BLAST
through NCBI, many Juan-A hits were found to EST
sequences from full-length cDNA libraries (not shown).
Several hits to the 3' end of Juan-A were from sequencing
reactions using oligo dT primers, indicating that these are
from polyadenylated transcripts.
Juan is widely distributed in Culicinae
Juan family sequences were obtained by PCR from 18 species of six genera including Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Psorophora,
Culex, Deinocerites, and Wyeomyia (Table 2). PCR products
from each species were cloned and sequenced. Additional
sequences were obtained from Ae. albopictus and C. quinquefasciatus genomic libraries. PCR with 12 other species
either yielded no product, or bands of the expected size
that corresponded to other retrotransposons. These 12
species are: Anopheles (An.)gambiae, An. stephensi, An.
freenborni, An. quadrimaculatus, An. albimanus, Armigeres
subalbatus, Culex erraticus, Culiseta melanura, Mansonia

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/112

dyari, Mansonia titillans, Psorophora ferox, and Toxorhynchites amboinensis. Most but not all of the Juan "negative"
species were distantly related to the Juan "positive" species. Failure of PCR amplification could result from mutations in the primer target sequences or the absence of a
"true" Juan in the species. No PCR products were obtained
from any Anopheline species. When Juan-A aa sequence is
used for BLAST vs. the An. gambiae genome sequence, the
most significant hit retrieved is Ag-Jen-4 (Figure 2B) having only ~36% amino acid identity in the same region
used for PCR. Additional sequences added from the Ae.
aegypti and An. gambiae genome show the presence of several divergent Jockey families that are paralogous to Juan
(Figure 2B).
Juan appears to have been active throughout the mosquito
family
Six species have 3 or more Juan sequences that share a
high degree of intragenomic nt identity (Table 3). Values
shown in Table 3 are the mean of comparisons of each
sequence vs. the consensus generated from that group of
sequences. Sequence identity of PCR clones ranges from
approximately 97.1% in Ae. aegypti to 99.4% at the nucleotide level in C. quinquefasciatus. Four sequences from C.
quinquefasciatus have over 99% identity. These do not
appear to come from the same copy of Juan in the genome
since a deletion is present in one sequence and substitutions can be found at various positions among the different sequences. PCR and library clones from 16 of 18
species yielded sequences that do not have frameshifts or
stop codons within this analyzed portion of the ORF (Figure 2B). Altogether, these results indicate recent activity of
Juan in both closely related and divergent species.
Negative selection has been acting on Juan
The rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN)
codon substitution have been commonly used as a measure of selection pressure. A value of dS/dN close to 1 is
taken to indicate neutral selection as would be expected
for a pseudogene. Values below and above 1 indicate positive and negative selection. Vitellogenin-C (Vg-C), a single copy yolk protein-encoding gene [30] was used as a

Note: only sequences in the same lineage are compared

comparison to Juan, because we had Vg-C sequences available for many species. It should be noted that Vg-C is
known to be a relatively fast-evolving gene [30], but the
fact does not affect the interpretation of Juan dS/dN values. The dS/dN ratio was calculated for all Juan sequences
of the Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex genera that had intact
reading frames. Juan sequences analyzed show a significant bias toward synonymous substitution, over 10 times
that of the nonsynonymous rate. dS/dN values for Juan
from the Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex genera were 10.7
(+/-2.9) and 12.3 (+/-2.3), respectively. Vg-C sequences
from the Aedes genera had a value of 16.9 (+/-4.1). This is
consistent with the interpretation that Juan has been retrotransposing in mosquito genomes, and this region is
under negative selection due to functional constraint.
Vertical transmission of Juan and a few cases of
phylogenetic incongruence
Comparison of host phylogeny with TE phylogeny is one
method used to address the question of vertical vs. horizontal transmission. A detailed mosquito phylogeny has
been previously constructed using Vg-C [30]. We have
only included Vg-C sequences from species for which Juan
sequences were obtained in this study (Figure 2A). In
addition, we have also obtained sequence for Vg-C from
Ae. simpsoni, which was not available from the previous
dataset [30]. We used nt sequences for phylogenetic inference as in the previous study, and our phylogeny is consistent with the phylogeny based on the larger Vg-C
dataset [30].

Phylogenetic inference using Bayesian methods shows
support for the vertical transmission of Juan in the mosquito family as comparison of Juan and host phylogenies
shows overall congruence of tree topology with few exceptions (Figure 2A and 2B). W. michelli is basal to the Culex
genus and D. cancer group in the Vg-C phylogeny (Figure
2A) while the Juan phylogeny (Figure 2B) shows W.
michelli as a sister group to D. cancer. The D. cancer
sequence is degenerate (note long branchlength) and
therefore may complicate phylogenetic resolution here.
Furthermore, P. ciliata is basal to the Aedes and Ochlerota-

tus genera in the host phylogeny. However, the Juan
sequences isolated from P. ciliata are found within the
Ochlerotatus genus. There are also indications of two sets
of paralogous Juan sequences from O. taeniorhinchus (Figure 2B).
The Juan phylogeny suggests that horizontal transfer
could have occurred in a few cases but the support is weak.
One case involves Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, in which
3 cloned PCR products from Ae. albopictus were nearly
identical to sequences from Ae. aegypti. Sequences
obtained by screening an Ae. albopictus genomic library are
found grouped with Ae. polynesiensis sequences as
expected according to known mosquito phylogeny.
Another case involves C. quinquefasciatus, for which we
also have sequences from both PCR and a genomic
library. The two library sequences group with C. molestus
and C. pipiens (Juan-C), as expected according to host phylogeny. However, the PCR sequences group most closely
with C. nigripalpus. O. atropalpus (atr2, Figure 2B) and O.
epactius (epa6, Figure 2B) sequences are almost identical
with over 99% nucleotide identity, but they come from
species that are in the same species complex where introgression may exist.

Discussion
Genomic impacts of Juan-A in Ae. aegypti
Juan contributes approximately 3% to the Ae. aegypti
genome sequence while the entire TE complement is estimated to be 47% (Ae. aegypti genome consortium, unpublished). With its significant contribution to genome size
and the presence of hundreds of highly homogeneous
full-length or near full-length copies, a natural question
concerns the genomic impact of Juan. TEs can cause chromosomal inversions by providing sites for ectopic homologous recombination and by other mechanisms [31]. It
might be thought that the hundreds of highly homogeneous copies might contribute to genomic instability.

Most non-LTR families usually consist of a large majority
of 5' truncated copies, which has been attributed to
incomplete reverse transcription, template switching, or
other mechanisms [32-35]. However, when using higher
stringency for copy number determination (representing
more recently amplified elements), there is a higher copy
number of 5' ends of Juan-A sequences than 3' ends (Table
1). This could be a result of selection for 5' ends, selection
against 3' ends, or possibly a distribution bias of 3' end
insertion into regions that are underrepresented in the
genome sequence. Full-length non-LTRs have been shown
to contain their own self-sufficient internal pol II promoter in the 5'UTR [36-40]. It is interesting that so many
5'UTRs of Juan-A are present in the genome. These 5'
UTRs, if functional as internal promoters, may produce a
transcriptional burden. It is interesting to note that our

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:112

reporter assays have not demonstrated promoter activity
of the Juan-A 5'UTR in cell lines from three mosquito species, while 5'UTRs of mosquito non-LTRs from 3 non-LTR
clades have proven active in all 3 lines (not shown). Perhaps Juan-A is dependent on upstream promoter elements
for transcription, as upstream sequences have been found
to greatly influence the activity of the human L1 promoter
activity [41]. Past analysis of Juan-C transcripts from cell
culture showed that all transcripts analyzed were transcribed from upstream of the Juan element [42]. With its
recent amplification and recent activity, the study of Juan
may offer a good opportunity to increase our understanding the competing forces of non-LTR activity and host regulation.
Juan evolution
To address the topic of vertical transmission and to analyze the distribution and evolution of Juan in Culicidae, a
detailed phylogeny of the host species was needed. Most
phylogenetic inferences of mosquitoes based on molecular data have been focused on the Anopheles genus due to
its medical importance. More comprehensive analyses
have been performed using the white gene [43] and Vg-C
[30]. The Vg-C sequences available to us offered the most
comprehensive phylogeny with many species from the
Aedes and Culex genera, where Juan was discovered.

The Jockey clade is comprised of highly divergent families
which have been found in several insect species
[18,25,44,45]. Representatives of Juan have been reported
in mosquitoes and in Drosophila [45]. However, those
elements are distant relatives of the Juan-A and Juan-C elements (Figure 2B), which we are investigating in this
study. We have focused on Juan-A and Juan-C (Juan sensu
stricto) because use of paralogous sequences can lead to
erroneous conclusions of phylogenetic relationships.
Results from Crainey and colleagues (2005) are consistent
with vertical transmission but they also included many
paralogous sequences from three mosquito genera. As
mentioned above, we focus on Juan sensu stricto and survey many mosquito species to investigate the question of
Juan evolution. It is important to note that our results
indicate that JuanDm [45] is not actually a Juan element,
strictly speaking, since it groups with three divergent Ae.
aegypti Jockey elements, having 99% support (Figure 2B).
This underscores the importance of including many divergent representatives while performing phylogenetic inference.
Regarding the cases of potential horizontal transfer, there
are alternative explanations. For the Ae. albopictus (alb 3,
6, 9, Figure 2B) and O. epactius (epa 6, Figure 2B)
sequences, the first suspicion is genomic DNA contamination of the PCR reaction. The Ae. albopictus sequences
obtained from a genomic library were found grouped

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/112

with Ae. polynesiensis, as expected. It should be noted that
the library was constructed from the Nepal strain and PCR
was performed on the Oahu strain. Bensaadi-Merchermek, Salvado, and Mouches (1994) reported the absence
of Juan-A from Ae. albopictus Oahu strain (1971). If our
PCR results can be corroborated using other methods, this
would suggest the horizontal transfer of Juan-A to this
strain of Ae. albopictus. However, Juan-A was also reported
absent from strains of Ae. polynesiensis and O. triseriatus
[42], both species of which we were able to obtain PCR
products that grouped phylogenetically as expected, supporting vertical transmission of these elements. For C.
quinquefasciatus, sequences obtained from library screening correspond with the host phylogeny, being grouped in
the C. pipiens species complex. In contrast, sequences
obtained from PCR are found outside this group and
placed closely with C. nigripalpus with approximately 94%
nucleotide identity to nig5 (Figure 2B). Although possible, the nucleotide identities between the C. quinquefasciatus sequences and the C. nigripalpus sequence are not close
enough to suspect genomic DNA contamination of the
PCR. Another possibility is that different sublineages of
Juan could have been sampled by PCR versus library
screening. For example, there are two sublineages represented in O. taeniorhinchus. The amplification of Juan
sequences from contaminating genomic DNA cannot be
ruled out, especially when using degenerate primers with
low stringency PCR conditions. This seems unlikely in the
case of C. quinquefasciatus, because these multiple
sequences form their own homogeneous group with high
nucleotide identity. If they resulted from contaminating
genomic DNA, then they would be expected to group with
sequences of the contaminating species. In summary,
there is evidence for multiple Juan lineages, which could
explain some of the observed phylogenetic incongruence.
However, further analysis is required to determine
whether the phylogeny of the suspect sequences is due to
horizontal transfer, genomic DNA contamination, or
sampling of different sublineages.

Conclusion
It has been proposed that the horizontal transfer of nonLTRs are rare events and few reported cases have strong
supporting evidence without alternative explanations
[18,19]. In contrast, there are many cases documented for
the horizontal transfer of DNA-mediated TEs. Without
excluding the possibility of horizontal transfers, we find
that Juan family members do mirror their host's phylogeny closely, supporting the vertical transmission of these
elements. Our results suggest the Juan family was able to
sustain its activity in the mosquito family over long periods of evolutionary time. Estimates of the time since Aedes
and Culex divergence would suggest that Juan has been
maintained for at least 22–52 million years [46]. Furthermore, the presence of multiple Culicinae lineages approx-

imately 120 MYA has been proposed [47], suggesting that
Juan may have persisted for at least this time. Detailed
studies involving the site-specific non-LTRs R1 and R2 in
Drosophila showed that they are vertically transmitted and
are maintained in their respective genomes [20,22,23]. It
may be argued that vertical transmission of R1 and R2
over a long evolutionary time could be unique to site-specific non-LTRs. This study, which was performed in a different insect group using a non-LTR that does not exhibit
site-specificity, strengthens the hypothesis that non-LTRs
are able sustain their activity without the need of horizontal transfer. It will be interesting to see if other non-LTRs
behave in a similar fashion, especially those from other
clades and divergent taxa that have not been studied in
detail.

Methods
PCR amplification of genomic DNA and cloning
Degenerate primers GDFNAKH (forward) and FKNMKAPG (reverse) (Sigma Genosys) were designed according
to conserved amino acid sequence including 939 bp
found in an alignment of ORF2 of the Juan element from
Juan-A of Ae. aegypti and Juan-C of C. pipiens (Figure 1). In
contrast to the commonly used RT region, we chose to use
this less conserved region to increase resolution between
sequences from closely related species. Genomic DNA was
isolated from several individuals of a given species using
the DNAzol Genomic DNA Isolation Reagent (Molecular
Research Center). PCR was performed on genomic DNA
from a total of 30 species of mosquitoes from 10 genera.
The calculated Tms of the forward and reverse primers
were 54.2°C and 62.7°C. Each 20 ul PCR reaction consisted of approximately 3 ng of genomic DNA, 1U of
TakaRa Taq Polymerase (Takara), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2
mM each dNTP. PCR was performed by denaturation at
95°C for 90s and 30 cycles of 95°C for 30s, 48°C for 50s,
and 72°C for 90s. Amplified products were size-separated
on a 0.7% agarose gel and purified using the Sephaglass
BandPrep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These
products were cloned into the pCR 2.1 TOPO vector using
the TOPO TA Cloning Kit version K2 (Invitrogen) or the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Plasmids were purified
using the Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System
(Promega).

For construction of mosquito (host) phylogeny, we used
a 987 bp region (excluding intron sequence) of Vg-C, a
single copy yolk protein-encoding gene [30]. This region
was amplified from Ae. simpsoni by nested PCR in our lab
to add this species to the mosquito phylogeny. The following describes methods according to Isoe's work [30].
Degenerate primers were designed to amplify a 1.1 kb
region that is specific for the Vg-C ortholog that includes
the second intron. Primers Vg-C-specific forward (5'-(A/
G)A(T/C)(A/G)TNAA(A/G)CA(T/C)CCNAA(A/G)G-3'),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/112

Vg-C-specific reverse (5'-TC(A/G)TT(T/C)TG(T/C)TT(A/
G)TA(T/C)TG(A/G/T)CC-3'), and Aedes universal reverse
(5'-C(A/G)T(A/G)CCA(A/G)CANTCNCCCAT-3')
were
used in nested PCR. The first PCR used the Vg-C-specific
forward and reverse primers for 1 cycle at 94°C for 3 minutes, 32 cycles at 94°C for 1 minute, 50°C for 1.5 minute,
and 1 extension cycle at 72°C for 10 minutes. The second
PCR used the Vg-C-specific and Aedes universal reverse
primers with the same conditions except that the annealing temperature was increased to 54°C. PCR products for
Ae. simpsoni were cloned and sequenced as described
above. Cloned inserts were sequenced in our laboratory
using a GENE READIR DNA sequencer (LI-COR) with fluorescent-labeled T7 and m13r primers, or by DNA
sequencing services (Amplicon Express and VBI-Blacksburg, VA). H20 was used as a no-template negative control
for PCR.
Genome and sequence analysis
Genome analysis was performed on the contig version of
the Aedes aegypti genome sequence, which consists of
36206 contigs comprising 1310.1 Mb, having 7.6 × coverage (Broad Institute). BLAST and other programs (TEpost,
FromTEpost) developed in our lab [44] were used to
extract and filter sequences from BLAST output. Genome
contribution by Juan-A was estimated using RepeatMasker
[28] using 70% identity cutoff with full-length Juan-A as
query. The Wisconsin Package GCG version 10.2-UNIX
(Genetics Computer Group) was used for analysis of
cloned and sequenced PCR products. Alignments were
produced with ClustalX 1.81 [48]. To obtain dS/dN values, substitution analysis was performed using the SNAP
program on the web [49,50]. Only sequences that had
intact sequence regions were used for substitution analysis. Mean values are calculated based on all pair-wise comparisons from that group.
Phylogenetic inference
Phylogenetic inference was performed using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [51,52]. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX
version 1.83 [53] using the following parameters: pairwise alignment gap opening = 10, gap extension = 0.1;
multiple alignment gap opening = 10, gap extension =
0.2. Nucleotide Vg-C sequence data (see above) were used
for the host phylogeny. The Modeltest server (version 3.7)
[54,55] was used to determine the best nucleotide evolutionary model (General Time Reversible (GTR) allowing
for variable substitution rates among sites) according to
an Aikaike Information Criteria (AIC) score. The model
was implemented with MrBayes, running 150,000 generations, concluding with an average standard deviation of
split frequencies below 0.01 (as suggested in the MrBayes
manual), evidence of convergence of two independent
tree searches.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:112

Conceptually translated nucleotide sequences and
sequences form Genbank (accessions) were used for nonLTR phylogeny. Sequences were aligned as described
above. MrBayes was used to explore 9 fixed-rate amino
acid evolutionary models, finding Jones [56] to have the
highest score. Two hundred thousand generations were
run resulting in an average standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.01. For all consensus trees displayed,
clade credibility values are given at each node representing samplings of 1 of every 100th generation, while discarding the first 25% of all generations (the "burnin"
period). Another analysis performed for 1,000,000 generations produced the same tree topology. See additional
files 1 and 2 for alignments used for phylogenetic inference.
Juan-A copy number determination in the Ae. aegypti
genome sequence
Different regions of the Juan-A sequence were used to
determine Juan copy number in the Ae. aegypti genome by
database search using BLAST (Figure 1, Table 1). The JuanA 3' UTR is approximately 240 bp. For copy number determination, we used 0.34 Kb of the 3' end as the query to be
consistent with the use of the 0.34 Kb 5' UTR. Hits were
counted which had sequence identities greater than or
equal to 70%, 80%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% compared to
the query. In each case, a hit had to have at least 90%
length of the query sequence. The full-length published
Juan-A sequence is 4727 bp [24].
Sequence identity comparisons
In Table 3, values shown for all species except Ae. aegypti
are means plus one standard deviation from pair-wise
comparisons of nucleotide sequences obtained by PCR.
Only sequences from the same lineages are compared.
Comparisons were made between sequences and the consensus derived from the number of sequences in column
3. Ae. aegypti sequences were obtained by database search
using a query that spans the same sequence amplified by
PCR (see Figure 1). The number 768 is higher than what
is shown in row 1 of Table 1 because the query here is the
segment used for PCR.
Library screening
Amplified genomic libraries for Ae. albopictus, Ae. polynesiensis, C. tarsalis, and C. quinquefasciatus made using the
Zap Express or Dash II kits (Stratagene) were screened
using Digoxegenin-labeled (Roche Diagnostics) ssDNA
probes generated from asymmetric PCR reactions. Two
probes used for screening libraries of the Aedes or Culex
genus were made from cloned PCR products amplified
from Ae. aegypti and C. tarsalis using degenerate primers
described above. The average insert size for the genomic
libraries was 7 kb for Aedes and Culex libraries. Approximately 15,000 – 50,000 plaques were plated on NZY Agar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/112

plates and lifts were performed with nylon membranes
(Osmonics). The membranes were blocked with prehybridization solution, containing 5 × SSC, 0.1% N-laurolylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 2% nonfat milk for 2 hours
at 55.0°C in a rotating hybridization incubator. Hybridization was performed with about 20 ng/ml of Digoxegenin-labeled probe in prehybridization solution for 6
hours to overnight at 55.0°C in a rotating hybridization
incubator. Stringency washes were done using 0.5 × SSC,
0.1% SDS. Membranes were incubated with an anti-Digoxegenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase,
and then developed with substrates BCIP and NBT for
colorimetric detection. The copy number of Juan was calculated using known values of haploid genome size, average insert size of the library, and the ratio of positives to
total number of plaques.
