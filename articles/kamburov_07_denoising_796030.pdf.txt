Abstract
Background: Gene fusion detection – also known as the 'Rosetta Stone' method – involves the
identification of fused composite genes in a set of reference genomes, which indicates potential
interactions between its un-fused counterpart genes in query genomes. The precision of this
method typically improves with an ever-increasing number of reference genomes.
Results: In order to explore the usefulness and scope of this approach for protein interaction
prediction and generate a high-quality, non-redundant set of interacting pairs of proteins across a
wide taxonomic range, we have exhaustively performed gene fusion analysis for 184 genomes using
an efficient variant of a previously developed protocol. By analyzing interaction graphs and applying
a threshold that limits the maximum number of possible interactions within the largest graph
components, we show that we can reduce the number of implausible interactions due to the
detection of promiscuous domains. With this generally applicable approach, we generate a robust
set of over 2 million distinct and testable interactions encompassing 696,894 proteins in 184 species
or strains, most of which have never been the subject of high-throughput experimental proteomics.
We investigate the cumulative effect of increasing numbers of genomes on the fidelity and quantity
of predictions, and show that, for large numbers of genomes, predictions do not become saturated
but continue to grow linearly, for the majority of the species. We also examine the percentage of
component (and composite) proteins with relation to the number of genes and further validate the
functional categories that are highly represented in this robust set of detected genome-wide
interactions.
Conclusion: We illustrate the phylogenetic and functional diversity of gene fusion events across
genomes, and their usefulness for accurate prediction of protein interaction and function.

Background
Recently a number of genome analysis methods have
been developed that predict protein-protein interactions
and functional associations between proteins based primarily on genome context and not directly relying on
sequence homology [1-6]. The context of a gene in a complete genome relates to its location on the genome and
also its phylogenetic distribution across multiple
genomes [7]. Such methods include the detection of gene
clusters that are conserved across multiple genomes [4,6],
the detection of gene sets which exhibit similar presence
or absence patterns called phylogenetic profiles [2] and
finally the detection of gene fusion events [1,5], all indicative of protein interaction or general functional association of the corresponding gene products.
The gene-fusion approach relies on the observation that
pairs of genes encoding proteins of known function (usually interacting or forming a complex) tend to be found in
other species as a fused composite gene encoding a single
multifunctional protein. This event had been previously
noted in protein evolution but not explicitly used for the
prediction of protein function [8]. The fusion of two
genes, which interact or are closely functionally linked,
appears to decrease the regulational load in the cell, for a
particular process [1,2,8] and may hence be advantageous
under specific circumstances. Therefore, the detection of a
gene fusion in one (query) genome allows the prediction
of functional association between corresponding homologous genes that remain separate in another (reference)
genome. Typically, we refer to the fused gene as a 'composite' protein, while the un-fused counterpart genes in
the reference organism are referred to as 'component' proteins [1,3].
The accuracy of this approach has previously been demonstrated [3,9], however the presence of so-called 'promiscuous domains' in eukaryotic species has made it
problematic to apply this method across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. These widespread domains (e.g. WD40 or
TPR) are present in a multitude of combinations in many
eukaryotic proteins [10] and can confound gene-fusion
detection by appearing to be multiple conserved examples
of gene-fusion components [3]. For this reason, we have
improved our detection method to filter highly promiscuous domains from predictions.
Previously, we used sequence homology and clustering to
attempt resolving this issue, however this approach is
computationally intensive. For this analysis, we take a
simpler approach based on the PFAM domain database
[11]. By delineating the domain architecture of each protein involved in a fusion event, we are able to locate and
filter those domains that appear to link an inordinate
number of proteins together based on domain interaction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/460

graph connectivity analysis (see Methods). This approach
has only recently been made feasible due to the increasing
coverage of the PFAM domain database (currently 75% of
proteins [11]) and the availability of large-scale computational resources.
In order to further explore the evolution and dynamics of
gene fusion events in complete genomes, we have applied
the approach to a set of 184 genomes. This represents the
largest analysis of its type undertaken thus far. As we have
previously stated, the fidelity of functional predictions
based on genome context methods greatly improves with
larger numbers of available genomes. Hence, we use the
COGENT database [12] as our source for genome
sequences, as it is constantly updated with new genomes
and uses a consistent naming scheme for protein identifiers. The availability of a large number of genomes allows
us to explore various aspects of fusion and function.
In this work, we explore the distribution of both fusion
events and of composite and component proteins across
each of the 184 genomes and their taxa. We also quantify
the cumulative effect of how access to multiple genomes
allows more predictions of functional association, and
assess whether we are approaching the limits of prediction
with larger numbers of reference genomes. Finally, we
automatically assign proteins involved in fusion events
with Gene Ontology (GO) [13] classifiers and show that
certain classes of genes tend to be more frequently
involved in fusion events than those of other classes, previously shown for individual classes [14,15], and that
genes involved in fusions tend to be of the same functional class, an observation that has been previously
reported (for 30 microbial genomes) [9]. We also compare these functional categories with interactions
obtained from an experimental protein-protein interaction database. These results are further validated using a
robust randomized trial.

Results and Discussion
Gene fusions
A total of 184 complete genomes from the COGENT database [12] were analyzed for fusion events (see Methods,
Figure 1). This set comprises 148 Bacterial, 17 Archaeal
and 19 Eukaryotic genomes, representing a total of
696,894 proteins. From these genomes, a total of
8,134,139 possible distinct fusion events were detected
involving 275,003 proteins. In total, 130,229 composite
and 235,124 component proteins were detected. These
fusion events were filtered to remove those containing
promiscuous domains using a threshold measure based
on graph connectivity of protein domains (see Methods,
Figure 2). Filtering the most promiscuous domains (those
that interact with more than eight other distinct
domains), in this fashion, removes a total of 5,942,120

Phylogenetic distribution of gene fusion events
Across different genomes the pattern of detection of gene
fusion events is very different. As has been observed previously [3], Eukaryota exhibit the largest numbers of predicted interactions (detected components) because they
represent the largest genomes and total number of
detected interactions relates strongly to genome size (Figure 3). However, a number of exceptions to this observation exist. For example; Plasmodium falciparum exhibits a
larger number of detected interactions, than one might
expect (Figure 3a), for its genome size; similarly, Shigella
flexneri (serotype 2a T301) has the largest number of
detected interactions (10,160) of any bacterium (more
than twice that of the next largest), yet its genome is only

interactions, leaving 2,192,019 potential interactions for
further analysis. Since interaction data for all these
genomes are not available, in order to validate this
approach, we aim at high specificity (low number of false
positives), and low sensitivity (high number of false negatives). The two million unique pairwise interactions that
can be detected form a high-quality dataset upon which
further analyses can be performed.

tions (only 1495). Both of these serotypes are pathogenic
strains isolated from infected patients, and their genomes
possess large numbers of rearrangements [16], however
the exact reason for such a striking difference is, as yet,
undetermined.
When one examines the distribution of the fraction of
detected composite (fused) proteins in each genome,
compared with its genome size, a similar pattern across
taxa emerges (as in the case for detected components, see
above) (see Additional File 1). The larger Eukaryotic
genomes tend to have a larger proportion of fused composite proteins, than smaller genomes, with human and
mouse the largest, at 29% apiece. Once again, the P. falciparum genome is an exception to this rule with a far
greater proportion of composite genes (27%) than one
might expect for its genome size, perhaps due to its role as
an obligate intracellular parasite. The Bordetella pertussis
genome possesses the largest proportion of composites of
any other bacterial genome studied (22%). In general, the
Archaea appear to contribute the fewest composite proteins in the analysis, even in relation to their small
genome sizes, although this may be due to the fact that
there were only 17 Archaeal genomes available (see Additional File 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/460

species and number of contributed interactions (> 0.9),
these data are virtually linear (for an example see Figure
3c), with 115 such genomes having slopes greater than 1.0
(average slope 4.75, see Additional File 3). These data
indicate that there does not appear to be a saturation
effect and increasing numbers of genomes might still give
rise to novel protein interaction predictions (see Additional Files 4 &5; for example, Figure 3c corresponds to
page 114 of Additional File 5). In particular, certain reference genomes generate a large number of novel interactions, e.g. eukaryotic genomes, typically in a nonmonotonic fashion. This indicates that detection of protein interactions based on gene fusion will continue to be
a powerful tool for genome analysis.
A small number of genomes did appear to exhibit saturation effects, where new reference genomes did not significantly boost the number of initially obtained interactions
(see Additional Files 4 &5). One striking case being that of
the Wolbachia pipientis genome (slope 0.63; see page 159
of Additional File 5). This result is not surprising as W.
pipientis is an endosymbiont of insect species and possesses a minimal genome necessary for transmission and
survival [17]. In fact, many other species with similar
slopes also possess small genomes and/or are endosymbionts and obligate intracellular parasites e.g. Nanoarchaeum equitans (a hyperthermophilic obligate symbiont
[18]; slope 0.05), Mycoplasma genitalium (slope 0.16),
and a number of Chlamydia strains such as Chlamydia
trachomatis (MoPn) (slope 0.16) – (for all these cases, see
Additional Files 4 &5).

As expected, a similar pattern emerges between the
number of unique components versus composites (see
Additional File 2a), irrespective of genome size. The distribution of the fraction of proteins involved in predicted
interactions for the three major taxonomic domains illustrates the major differences between each domain (see
Additional File 2b). For Archaea and Bacteria, the distribution is unimodal with a median between 12–14% of
proteins involved in interactions for Archaea and 16–18%
for Bacteria. The distribution for Eukaryota is manifestly
bimodal with many genomes at 14–16% and a separate
set of outliers at 30–42%. Inspection of the latter set indicates that it represents multicellular species, while the set
with the smaller median value represents unicellular species. All of the above percentages are markedly higher than
those obtained in a previous analysis involving 24
genomes [3], where on average 9% of proteins of the total
encoded in a genome were found to correspond to unique
components involved in gene fusion.

Another such example is the extremophile Methanopyrus
kandleri (slope 1.05) which is a rod-shaped Gram-positive
methanogen that grows chemolithoautotrophically at
80–110°C in the H2CO2 atmosphere of a deep water geothermal chimney [19]. These results appear to indicate
that it might be more difficult to detect protein interactions for genomes from poorly represented taxonomic
classes, i.e. most gene fusion events are detected between
large groups of related species. This result is borne out
when one examines the genomes with the largest slopes.
The top ten such genomes are all Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria or Firmicutes, classes of bacteria highly over-represented in COGENT (119 genomes or 65%).

Cumulative effect of multiple genomes
In order to assess the effect of an increasing number of
genomes for fusion analysis, we analyzed the number of
detected individual interactions for each genome based
on fused genes detected in each of the reference genomes.
The reference genomes are displayed in terms of the
number of interactions they may contribute for each
query genome. For those genomes with good correlation
coefficients between the relative rank order of reference

Biological diversity of gene fusion events
In order to delineate the functional diversity of proteins
predicted to interact by virtue of gene fusion events, we
infer functional classes for each component of a fusion
event (where possible), based on GO [13] annotations
derived from their domains (see Methods). A number of
functional classes relating to both the 'biological process'
and 'molecular function' ontologies appear to be highly
over-represented in components of gene fusion events

(Table 1). The most highly over-represented molecular
function classes, overall, are for receptors and protein
transporters, both occurring more than ten times than
expected (Table 1 & Figure 4). Small protein conjugating
enzymes are the third most over-represented class, occurring eight times more than expected. These three classes
represent excellent targets for gene fusion, as they involve
proteins that either form structural complexes or facilitate
the channeling of various small-molecule and macromolecular substrates [1,20]. Transcription factors, and pore/
channel transporters are also highly over-represented (by
two fold) (Table 1).
We compared this breakdown of functional classes for
gene-fusion based predictions of interaction against a set
of experimentally determined interacting proteins from
the DIP database [21], to determine whether the detected
classes are representative of interacting proteins in general, or only those involved in gene fusion events (Figure
4a). The breakdown of GO classes for DIP interactions is
significantly different than those obtained by gene fusion

analysis (not shown), consistent with previous findings
that certain classes of genes are more likely to be involved
in fusion events, previously shown in certain cases
[14,15], Thus, these sets of interactions appear to contain
functionally diverse sets of proteins.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of gene fusion based
prediction of protein-protein interaction and functional
association, using these derived functional classes. We
expect that if the method performs accurately, then predicted interactions should, in most cases, link proteins of
the same or similar functional class [9]. In order to test
this hypothesis, we calculated the number of interactions
for which both sets of proteins had matching functional
classes (see Methods). We then generate 100 randomized
trials and performed the same evaluation (see Methods).
When the distribution of matches is compared for the real
and randomized data, we find that the observed pairs are
significantly more likely to link genes of the same functional class, than randomized pairs (Z-score 177.6) with
72.25% of real interactions having matching classes, com-

pared to an average of 29.2% for the randomized trials
(Figure 4b).
Examples of protein interactions for validated annotations
in Chlamydia
To further exemplify the validity of our predictions, we
validated all detected pairs of interacting proteins against
a high-quality, manually curated set of functional annotations from the genome of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D
[22]. This set consists of 40 pairs (10 additional pairs of
adjacent open reading frames are detected but excluded
from this analysis, due to possible artefacts in gene prediction). Of the 40 instances, 4 (10%) are well-known interactions (5, 6, 13, 37), evident from the associated
annotations (see Additional File 6, known). Another 4
(10%) instances (12, 29, 30, 31) are probably false, due to
paralogy between one of the proteins and the genuine
interacting partner (see Additional File 6, paralog). There
are 10 (25%) instances (2, 4, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 34, 35,
40) where at least one of the partners is not functionally
characterized (see Additional File 6, unknown). In cases
where one protein is characterized, this analysis provides
an indication for the association of the other partner in a
similar process (e.g. CT379 associates with cytidylate
kinase, CT452). The remaining 22 instances (55%) represent interactions, ranging from the highly likely, supported by annotation (e.g. 7–9, 14: AroA/B or 15: AroA/
E), to reasonable predictions (e.g. 11: a tRNA modification enzyme with riboflavin kinase, 16: GPI with transaldolase [23]), to highly surprising (e.g. 18: DnaK with Ser/
Thr protein kinase) (see Additional File 6, predicted).
A network of protein interactions in the model plant
species Arabidopsis
Finally, a question that typically arises in this type of analysis relates to the efficacy of this method for the delineation of protein interactions in eukaryotic species. In fact, a
large part of the predicted interactions occurs in a relatively small group of eukaryotes (Figure 3a). For instance,
about a fifth of the total number of detected interactions
occur in Arabidopsis thaliana. The analysis of this network
is of particular interest, since there have not been yet any
high-throughput protein interaction detection experiments for this important model plant species. In total, we
are able to predict 409,217 interactions in A. thaliana,
encompassing 9,834 unique proteins and forming 312
distinct network components. The structure of the A. thaliana interaction network is representative of those found
in other eukaryotes, with a giant component dominating
the picture, and smaller peripheral interaction clusters
(Figure 5). An analysis of such network presents a challenge, for two main reasons: first, complex eukaryotic species undergo various developmental stages, thus any
protein complement analysis has to take into account
sub-cellular, cell type, tissue, organ and developmental

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/460

stage co-ordinates, something that is certainly not always
possible; second, the paralogous nature of eukaryotic
genomes obscures potential protein interactions, usually
by over-predicting possible, not necessarily false, functional associations (as one-to-many and many-to-many
relationships) (Figure 5).
In order to perform an analysis of the functional network
in this model plant species, we focus on the functional significance of one-to-one interactions only, i.e. these interactions where the two members are found to interact with
each other, on the basis of a composite protein elsewhere.
Our survey reveals a few examples of well-annotated interactions, as well as predictions for novel cases of interacting proteins. Known cases include a multitude of selfevident protein pairs, as assessed by the corresponding
gene descriptions. This fact provides further reassurance
for the relevance of this approach. Such examples include
the detection of interactions between components of the
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, components of the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway, and components of the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway
(see Additional File 7). Less evident examples include
interactions between proteins that are less well characterized, with partial annotations that can be used to shed a
light on the biological process in which these proteins
participate. One such case is the interaction between
At4g10100 (accession: Q9S7A3) (molybdopterin synthase small subunit) and At2g43760 (O22827) (putative
molybdopterin synthase large subunit), which provides
further reassurance that At2g43760 is indeed a component of the molybdopterin synthase complex (see Additional File 7). Another less clear case is the interaction
between At2g32600 (O80897) (putative spliceosome
associated protein) and At5g46840 (Q9LUK6) (similarity
to RNA-binding protein), which suggests that the latter

protein might also be involved in spliceosome activity
(see Additional File 7). A particularly striking example is
the interaction between At1g79150 (Q1KS85) and
At1g79140 (Q6NME0), both hypothetical proteins: the
former containing a NOC3p domain [24] and the latter
containing a CBF domain, a domain found in the yeast
NOC1 protein [25] (Q12176) (see Additional File 7). In
yeast, Noc1p and Noc3p are required for ribosome maturation and transport, where mutation of each Noc protein
impairs intranuclear transport of 60S subunits at different
stages and inhibits pre-rRNA processing [26]. Since
homologs for each of the Noc1-3p proteins exist in higher
eukaryotes, it is likely that their functions in ribosome
synthesis are conserved in evolution [26]. The inferred
interaction between the two A. thaliana proteins provides
some preliminary evidence for the existence of an homologous complex and molecular process in A. thaliana.

Conclusion
We present the largest analysis, as yet undertaken, toward
the computational detection of protein-protein interactions and functional associations based on gene fusion
events. We illustrate that gene fusion events are widespread across the different domains of life and are present
in intricate patterns across various genomes, both in terms
of their phylogenetic distribution and in terms of the biological diversity of proteins involved in these events. The
fact that we have by no means saturated the predictive
power of this approach with 184 genomes is encouraging,
since previous research has already shown that the fidelity
of these predictions increases as more genomes are considered. Unlike other genome context methods, such as
phylogenetic profiles which perform best with noneukaryotic genomes [27], the gene fusion approach benefits from the multi-domain nature of eukaryotic proteins
for the prediction of protein interactions, if properly
implemented. As more genomes become available, particularly for taxonomic groups that are currently not well
represented, we expect that gene fusion analysis will continue to be a valuable tool for the rigorous exploration of
protein function in entire genome sequences [28].

Methods
Genome Analysis
Sequence data was obtained from the COGENT database
[12] (v190) for 696,894 protein sequences from 184 complete genomes. Sequence similarities for all proteins
against each other was generated using NCBI BLASTp v2.0
[29] with an E-value threshold of E ≤ 1e-10. Two proteins
will be considered as interacting partners of a gene fusion
event if both were similar to a non-overlapping part of a
third sequence and were not similar to each other. To
check similarity between the interacting proteins, we used
a Smith-Waterman dynamic programming alignment tool
[30,31] (prss33) with a threshold p-value of 0.04.

Promiscuous Domain Filtering
We calculated the domain architecture of all protein
sequences using HMMER [32] against the PFAM (v15)
database [11] as a reference, using an e-value threshold of
E ≤ 1e-10. A frequency analysis was then performed on the
connectivity of PFAM domains. Recently, an analysis similar in spirit but different in detail has also been published
[33]. The distribution obtained is logarithmic, with a long
tail. We assume that this tail indicates the presence of promiscuous domains. When these data are visualized as a
network, using the BioLayout tool [34], most of the nodes
(i.e. proteins) are connected (i.e. interacting) in a supercluster, due to the presence of promiscuous domains. We
use this domain connectivity graph in order to determine
a threshold for the removal of promiscuous domains (Figure 2). The ideal threshold should remove promiscuous
domains but leave intact all the other domains. The size
of the super-cluster (largest connected component) was
plotted against the threshold and we look for a threshold
where this super-cluster is drastically reduced while still
retaining most of the data (Figure 2). From this graph, we
choose a threshold C of 8 connections (removing 10% of
the data) as a reasonable compromise. At this point the
super-cluster is reduced to 94 proteins from the initial
1611 whereas 90% of all nodes are retained. Interestingly,
the median length of domains with connectivities of C =
8 is 153 residues, while the median length of domains
with connectivities of C>8 is 117 residues (Figure 2c).
Functional class annotation of interactions
GO annotations [13], for each PFAM domain, are
obtained from the InterPro database [35]. To build functional classes from GO terms, we flatten the GO hierarchies for both molecular function and biological process
to three levels below the tree root, and map all GO terms
up to this level. For each predicted interaction, we then
create a list of PFAM domains involved. Then for each
domain we find the corresponding GO terms. These terms
are applied to the corresponding COGENT entries. Thus,
for each predicted interaction we generate a list of GO
annotations for both interacting partners.
Randomized Trial
We also examine every interaction to assess whether both
proteins have at least one common GO annotation (in
terms of biological process) and if this is the case, we
count the interaction as a match, and if not, we count it as
a mismatch. The total number of matches was 13,841 and
the number of mismatches was 5,316. To find whether
this result is significant or random, we randomized the
interactions in terms of GO annotations and compared
the results from the real and shuffled data.
