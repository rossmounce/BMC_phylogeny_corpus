We constructed a restriction site associated DNA (RAD) marker microarray to facilitate rapid
genetic mapping of zebrafish mutations. Using these microarrays with a bulk segregant approach,
we localized previously unmapped mutations to genomic regions just a few centiMorgans in length.
Furthermore, we developed an approach to assay individual RAD markers in pooled populations
and refined one region. The RAD approach is highly effective for genetic mapping in zebrafish and
is an attractive option for mapping in other organisms.

Here we report the successful application of RAD marker genotyping to mapping of zebrafish mutations. We constructed a
zebrafish RAD marker microarray that genotypes thousands

information

The first eight zebrafish mutations were mapped using a bulk
segregant approach with a map constructed from anonymous
random amplified polymorphic DNA markers [8]. The same
basic approach is commonly used today with microsatellite
markers [13,14]. Although these approaches have been effective, they are expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming.
We have previously shown that restriction site associated
DNA (RAD) marker genotyping is a microarray-based
method that allows thousands of polymorphic markers to be
screened in parallel [15]. RAD tags are a genome-wide representation of a particular restriction enzyme's recognition
sequence by short DNA tags, and DNA sequence polymorphisms that disrupt restriction sites allow RAD tags to serve
as high-density genetic markers. The RAD approach has been
used to map natural variation in stickleback [15], but it has
not yet been applied to map induced mutations in any species.

interactions

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become an important model system for the study of vertebrate development and human disease, for the assignment of function to genes otherwise known
only by sequence, and for the identification of novel functions
for genes with previously described functions [1-5]. The success of zebrafish investigation has, in large part, been driven
by its amenability to forward genetic approaches [6-8].
Large-scale genetic screens in zebrafish have isolated thousands of mutations that cause an impressive array of phenotypic abnormalities [9,10] (see ZFIN [Zebrafish Model
Organism Database] [11] for a full list), and new mutations
will continue to be identified in ongoing highly directed
genetic screens. The genetic mapping of these mutations is
often the critical first step toward elucidating the underlying
molecular basis of the biologic process disrupted by mutation.
Therefore, developing resources that will accelerate genetic
mapping in zebrafish is important [12].

of polymorphic markers in parallel. Using a bulk segregant
mapping approach, we were able to localize previously
unmapped mutations to narrow genomic regions in single
hybridizations. In addition, we developed a new polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based method for genotyping individual RAD markers and rapidly refined the genomic interval for
one mutation. From these results, we conclude that the RAD

One powerful aspect of the RAD approach is that RAD markers can be genotyped on low-cost microarrays that are made
from the DNA of two polymorphic RAD tag samples [15]. To
construct a zebrafish RAD marker microarray, we first isolated EcoRI RAD tag samples from the common laboratory
strains AB and WIK [15]. For each strain, genomic DNA was
digested with EcoRI and biotin linkers were ligated onto the
ends. These samples were randomly sheared, leaving only the
fragments that were directly flanking a restriction site
attached to biotin. The biotin-ended fragments were purified
and released from the linkers (Figure 1a). Because RAD tags
that are present in both samples will not serve as informative
markers, subtractive hybridizations were used to enrich for
RAD tags that are specific to either AB or WIK. We modified
the previously described subtraction protocol (see Materials
and methods, below) [15] with the goal being to produce a
microarray with a greater informative marker rate. Random
cloning was used to generate libraries from the enriched samples. In all, 7,680 clones were isolated from the enriched WIK
sample and 6,144 from the enriched AB sample. PCR was
used to amplify these libraries, and the products were spotted
on glass slides to yield 13,824 element microarrays (Figure
1b).
To determine the number of AB-by-WIK informative markers
typed on this microarray, the AB and WIK RAD tag samples
were amplified, fluorescently labeled, and competitively
hybridized directly against each other to a microarray (Figure
1c). Using a twofold cut-off identified 3,128 of the 13,824
array elements (22.6%) with strain-specific hybridization,
representing a significant increase over the previously
described rate of 10% [15]. Also, as expected, array elements
for which the increased hybridization was associated with the
AB tag sample were isolated specifically from AB, and a similar specificity occurred for the WIK tag sample and the WIK
derived array elements (Table 1). Because only a minor modification to the subtraction protocol led to such an increase in
the informative marker rate, still more effective subtraction
methods should further increase the fraction of informative
markers on future RAD marker microarrays.
Although the production method we used will result in an
array that is optimized for AB-by-WIK mapping crosses, the
phylogenetic relationship between common zebrafish strains
[16] suggests that a large number of informative markers
could also be typed in other strains. To test how effective the
current RAD array is for other genotypes, we isolated a RAD
tag sample from the common strain TU and compared it with
the AB and WIK samples. A direct hybridization of TU and AB

a direct hybridization of TU and WIK revealed differential

with the previously described phylogenetic relationships of
these strains [16]. Furthermore, although the array is optimized for AB-by-WIK mapping crosses, the number of
informative markers available between any pair-wise combination of AB, TU, and WIK should be sufficient for bulk segregant mapping. Therefore, the current RAD array should
have wide applicability for mapping crosses between a variety
of zebrafish strains.

For mapping, we crossed fish heterozygous for a mutation to
individuals of a different strain to obtain F1 individuals, and
mated F1 by F1 to obtain diploid F2 embryos (Figure 3a). For
each mapping cross, we extracted DNA from individual F2
embryos that were either phenotypically mutant or phenotypically wild-type. DNA aliquots from 20 to 30 mutant embryos
were pooled together and DNAs from 20 to 30 wild-type
embryos were pooled (Figure 3b). From each pool, RAD tag
samples were isolated, fluorescently labeled, and competitively hybridized directly against each other to the RAD
microarray (Figure 3c). One hybridization experiment was
performed for each mutation. Closely linked RAD tags that
were only present in the wild-type parent will be absent in the

We explored the utility of the array for bulk segregant mapping by attempting to localize four previously unmapped
recessive mutations that we had recovered from the ongoing
ENU-mediated forward genetic screen at the University of
Oregon [17-19] (Figure 2). The b1127 and b1128 mutations
cause premature ossification of craniofacial chondral bones
and were isolated in the TU background and out-crossed to
AB for mapping. The b1182 mutation, also isolated in a TU
background, diminishes the differentiation of cartilage and
bone in specific elements of the neurocranium and pharyngeal arches, and was out-crossed to WIK for mapping. The
b1166 mutation, causing a shortened body axis, abnormal
somite morphology, and clefting of the anterior neurocranium, was isolated in AB and out-crossed to WIK for
mapping.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate the ability of
RAD microarrays to localize previously unmapped mutations
rapidly and accurately. For the mutations we mapped, the
average region size identified was 9.1 cM, or 0.4% of the
zebrafish gene map [13], and microsatellite markers confirmed that the mutations were within these regions. As
expected, the RAD marker density was greatest with the ABby-WIK cross (b1166). However, an equivalent mapping resolution was achieved with crosses involving TU, thus
confirming the applicability of RAD arrays for mapping with
strains not used in the array production process.

RAD Amp: a PCR-based method for genotyping
individual RAD markers
Although the RAD microarray is able to localize mutations to
narrow genomic regions rapidly, subsequent fine mapping is
needed to identify the causative loci. Unlike the initial stages
of mapping, fine mapping requires typing a small number of
closely linked markers in a large number of individuals. Large
numbers of microsatellite markers are available to refine the

For b1127 we sequenced seven RAD markers. Five of the
seven were located in the region of chromosome 20 that corresponds to the interval from 59.2 to 75.7 cM on LG 20 (Figure 4b). Another marker had no significant blastn hit against
Zv6, and the seventh marker was located on chromosome 1 in
Zv6. Genotyping individual F2 embryos confirmed that b1127
is within the region between z9343 (66.2 cM) and z4304 (72.2
cM) on LG 20.

For b1182 we sequenced five RAD markers that appeared to
be linked to the mutation. Four sequences were located on
chromosome 18 in the region that corresponds to 42.1 to 44.2
cM on linkage group (LG) 18 of the Boston MGH Cross
(MGH) meiotic map [13] (Figure 4a). The fifth marker was
located on chromosome 20 in Zv6. Recombination patterns
of individual embryos scored for microsatellite markers
z25238 and z10008 confirmed that b1182 is within or very
near the region between 42.1 and 44.2 cM on LG 18.

For b1166 we sequenced ten RAD markers, and seven were
located in the region of chromosome 25 that corresponds to
between 36.4 and 45.7 cM on LG 25 (Figure 3d). The three
others were located on different chromosomes in Zv6. Individual genotypes confirmed that b1166 is within the region
between z14229 (36.4 cM) and z43617 (45.7 cM) on LG 25.

For b1128 we sequenced five RAD markers. Three markers
were located in the region of chromosome 3 that corresponds
to between 42.0 and 50.4 cM on LG 3 (Figure 3c). The other
markers had no significant blastn hits against Zv6. Individual
genotypes confirmed that b1128 is within this region, approximately 0.7 cM from z5197 (50.4 cM).

with each mutant phenotype (see Materials and methods,
below). Although RAD markers from either parent can be
used to identify the region closely linked to the mutation [15],
we sequenced only WIK markers because they produce higher
ratios and they allow for RAD Amp individual marker analysis (see below). The RAD microarray data from one of the
mutants is shown in Table 2. A blastn search against the Zv6
assembly of the zebrafish genome [20] identified the genomic
assembly positions of the linked markers, which in turn
allowed determination of the approximate genetic map position. We confirmed the results by genotyping individual F2
embryos with microsatellite markers located in or near the
regions specified by the RAD mapping.

Normalized ratios are shown for microarray experiments. Experiment A is the hybridization of b1166 wild-type pool restriction site associated
DNA (RAD) tags verses b1166 mutant pool RAD tags. Experiment B is the hybridization of AB RAD tags verses WIK RAD tags. The marker
locations according to Zv6 assembly of the zebrafish genome are shown. In the 'Completely associated (RAD Amp)' column, entries are as follows:
'Yes' for RAD markers for which there was no wild-type allele in the b1166 mutant pool according to RAD Amp; 'No' for RAD markers for which
there was wild-type allele present in the b1166 mutant pool according to RAD Amp; and 'n.t.' for RAD markers that were not tested using RAD
Amp. RAD markers that are completely associated with the mutation often have higher ratios of experiment A to experiment B.

We tested this method on the seven RAD markers we identified as closely linked to b1166 (Figure 4d). These markers
have increased hybridization associated with WIK RAD tags
relative to AB tags, and should therefore represent instances
in which a restriction site is present in WIK and linked to the
wild-type allele but absent from the mutant background AB
(Figure 5a). Thus, applying RAD Amp to each of the seven

information

For this method, genomic DNA is digested with a particular
restriction enzyme and linkers are ligated to the fragment
ends. The sequence of specific polymorphic RAD tag clones is
used to design PCR primers such that one primer overlaps the
restriction site and contains sequence from both genomic and
linker DNA, whereas the other primer is a few hundred base

pairs away (Figure 5a). The digested and ligated sample is
used as a PCR template with these primers. Because one
primer binds to both linker and genomic DNA, efficient binding and extension will only take place if a restriction site is
present at that position to allow ligation of the linker. Furthermore, the primer that overlaps the linker is designed with
a mismatch near the 3' end to discourage aberrant extension
in absence of linker (Figure 5b).

regions identified by microarray [13]. In practice, however, a
significant fraction of available microsatellites are not polymorphic in a given cross, and some genomic regions contain
only a low density of markers. In many cases it would be convenient to use RAD markers directly to refine the regions
identified by microarray. To facilitate this, we developed a
PCR-based method for genotyping individual RAD markers.
This method allows for the detection of rare wild-type alleles
in a pooled mutant population.

template showed WIK-specific allele detection. RAD Amp detected WIK alleles in a pool containing 0.5% WIK and 99.5% AB DNA. WIK alleles, from the
wild-type parent, were detected in a pool of 24 F2 mutant individuals from the b1166 mapping cross at WIK18I13, WIK07C02, WIK05E18, and
WIK13P08. No WIK alleles were detected at WIK20J21, WIK18C01, or WIK11I12, suggesting that these markers are the more closely linked to the
mutation.

markers should result in amplification from WIK samples but
not AB. To test this prediction, AB and WIK genomic samples
were digested and linkers were ligated onto the ends of digestion fragments. These samples were used as PCR template for
amplification with primers designed from sequences of each
of the seven b1166-linked RAD markers. As expected, a PCR
product was generated for each marker using WIK as template but not AB (Figure 5c, lanes 1 and 2). We next tested
whether RAD Amp could be used to detect rare copies of the
WIK allele (having arisen from a rare recombination event) in
a pool of predominately AB alleles. We made a genomic DNA
mix containing 99.5% AB and 0.5% WIK genotypes, simulating one heterozygote in a population of 100 diploid individuals. Following digestion and ligation, this genomic mixture
was used as PCR template with the RAD Amp primers tested
above. For each marker, the method successfully detected the
rare WIK allele (Figure 5c, lane 3), thus confirming the ability
of RAD Amp to detect rare recombinant alleles in a pooled
sample of segregants.
Because b1166 was generated in the AB background, mutant
individuals will rarely contain WIK alleles at the markers
most closely linked to that mutation. To refine quickly the
genomic region that was previously identified as being linked
to the mutation, we used the RAD Amp approach to determine whether WIK alleles were present in a pool of 24
mutants at the seven b1166-linked RAD markers. As
described above, the pooled DNA was digested and linkers
were ligated to the fragment ends, and this sample was used
as PCR template. PCR product was generated for four of the
markers (WIK18I13, WIK07C02, WIK05E18, and
WIK13P08), demonstrating WIK allele presence in the
mutant pool at these loci. However, no product was generated
for the remaining three markers (WIK20J21, WIK18C01, and
WIK11I12), demonstrating the pool contained no WIK allele
at these loci (Figure 5c and Table 2). These results suggest
that the three markers with no amplification product
(WIK20J21, WIK18C01, and WIK11I12) are more closely
linked to b1166 than the others. Although the genomic assembly does not place WIK20J21 next to WIK18C01 and
WIK11I12, the genetic map is inverted with respect to the
assembly (Figure 4d), suggesting that the assembly marker
order is incorrect. Thus, the RAD Amp approach allowed us to
refine rapidly the genomic region identified by microarray.
Enlarging the size of the pool or testing similarly sized pools
from different individual segregants should further narrow
the region.
These results show that the RAD Amp approach can reliably
detect the presence of rare alleles in a large population of individuals, allowing rapid screening of pooled populations. The
bulk segregant array hybridization identifies tightly linked
RAD markers, and subsequent RAD Amp experiments rapidly screen those markers in the same and/or additional pools
to identify markers with the tightest association to the mutation. The RAD Amp approach may be a good alternative to

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R105

using existing microsatellites to refine the regions identified
by microarray. As the density of linked markers increases, it
becomes advantageous to examine large populations for
informative breakpoints. Individual genotyping of markers in
a large population is expensive and time consuming, whereas
the identification of completely linked RAD markers in a
pooled population using RAD Amp can be carried out rapidly.
Furthermore, the RAD Amp approach will be very useful for
organisms in which a large set of individually typed markers
is not available. Therefore, RAD Amp is a rapid and useful
additional step in mapping with RAD markers.

Future improvements
A number of improvements can increase the power of the
RAD approach. For one, we found many microsatellite alignment inconsistencies between the genomic assembly and the
MGH meiotic map [13]. The high degree of similarity between
independently generated meiotic maps suggests that errors in
the genetic map are infrequent [21]. Thus, these alignment
inconsistencies are probably due to assembly errors.
Assembly improvements would better define the regions
identified in mapping experiments. Also, we plan to sequence
all elements in the microarray. This not only would eliminate
a step in our current process, but in addition it would allow us
to plot hybridization ratios along a chromosome. The peak of
the hybridization ratio would identify the region with the
greatest association, and hence the most likely mutant locus.
Based on genome size [22] and average single nucleotide polymorphism frequency [16], more than 20,000 informative
RAD markers are expected to be available for a restriction
enzyme with a six nucleotide palindromic recognition
sequence [15]. RAD marker microarrays could be produced
that contain more informative markers, utilize a different
restriction enzyme, or are optimized for different strains.
Even if producing a microarray with a larger number of
informative markers did not improve microarray mapping
resolution, it would provide an increased marker density for
the RAD Amp technique, and thus increase the achievable
mapping resolution. The clone and printing libraries needed
for a RAD marker microarray can be generated in a few
weeks, with the greatest expense being the plastic ware, and
the printing plates contain enough material to print thousands of microarrays. Alternatively, high-density genomic tiling microarrays could be used for typing RAD markers as they
become more widely available. Whole genome tiling microarrays would probably type the majority of RAD markers for an
enzyme, could be used for a variety of enzymes, and would not
be strain specific. Therefore, these arrays would be a powerful
yet more costly platform for RAD marker genotyping.
Many technical aspects of the RAD methodology could be
improved. We used ligation-mediated PCR to amplify RAD
tags before fluorescent labeling and hybridization. Improved
amplification strategies that reduce noise in chromatin
immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) experiments

interactions

AB and WIK genomic samples were each prepared by combining genomic DNA from one male and one female. Characteristics of the wild-type strains used in these experiments are
available at ZFIN [25]. These samples were used for the
enriched RAD marker microarray production process.
Briefly, EcoRI RAD tag samples were isolated from these
genomic samples, and subtractive hybridizations between the
RAD tag samples were performed to enrich for informative
RAD tags. Clone libraries were generated from these enriched
RAD tag samples. These clone libraries were used as templates for PCR, the products of which were spotted to create
the microarray. Previously described methods [26] were used
for this process, with the following modifications. First, in the
subtractive hybridizations, 250 ng of tester, 5 μg of driver,
and no glycogen were used; also, three rounds of subtraction
were performed. Second, the microarray prehybridization
solution was 5 × saline sodium citrate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin.

F1 mapping heterozygotes were generated by outcrossing
mutant carriers. These mapping heterozygotes were incrossed to produce the diploid F2 embryos used for mapping.
The four mutations we mapped were recessive in diploid
embryos. For this reason, the informative RAD tags that are
highly linked to the dominant wild-type allele should rarely
be present in mutant embryos, but they should nearly always
be present in either the heterozygous or homozygous state in
wild-type embryos. In contrast, tags that are highly linked to
the mutant allele should nearly always be in the homozygous
state in mutant embryos, but they should also be present in
the heterozygous state in two-thirds of the phenotypically
wild-type embryos. Therefore, tags that are linked to the wildtype allele should produce larger hybridization differences
than tags linked to the mutant allele. For this reason, we
limited our analysis to the wild-type specific RAD tags. Wildtype specific elements with hybridization differences greater
than about threefold were chosen. This threshold provided
approximately five to ten elements per mutation. Plasmids
isolated from the corresponding clones were insert sequenced
and a blastn search was used to locate the sequences in the
Ensembl Zv6 genome assembly [22]. For each mutation, the
majority of the sequences clustered in a narrow region of the
genome assembly. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation of
marker clustering and determined that the probability of
finding three markers within a 10 megabase region by chance
alone to be less than 1 in 10,000 for five markers sequenced,
or less than 1 in 1,000 when ten markers are sequenced. The
Ensembl genome browser was used to identify microsatellite
markers located in the region. The genotyping of putatively
linked microsatellites in the mapping cross confirmed the
linkage and identified the corresponding region of the MGH
genetic map [27].

Materials and methods

RAD tag isolations, labeling, and hybridization were performed as previously described [26]. Briefly, genomic DNA
was digested and biotin linkers were ligated onto the ends of
the digested fragments. These samples were randomly
sheared via sonication to an average size of about 500 base
pairs, leaving only the fragments that were directly flanking a
restriction site attached to the linkers. The biotin-ended fragments were purified using streptavidin beads and released
from the linkers. Following amplification by ligation-mediated PCR, two RAD tag samples were fluorescently labeled
and hybridized directly against each other to a microarray.
Following hybridization, the arrays were scanned to generate
images of the fluorescent signal intensities. For the mapping
experiments, the mutant pool and wild-type pool RAD tag
samples were fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor® 555 and
Alexa Fluor® 647 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
respectively.

reports

Here we applied the RAD approach to zebrafish, which is a
well developed model organism. The ease of RAD microarray
construction and genotyping makes the RAD approach an
attractive option for mapping in other model organisms. Furthermore, the ability to develop RAD microarrays inexpensively and without prior sequence information or other costly
resources makes the RAD approach an attractive option for
high-resolution genotyping in nonmodel organisms, because
the identification of a large number of linked high-density
markers simplifies screening large-size genomic fragment
panels or the creation of genetic maps using the RAD
markers.

RAD tag isolation, labeling, and hybridization

reviews

In this report we describe the production of a zebrafish RAD
marker microarray and show that this microarray can facilitate rapid and inexpensive genetic mapping of zebrafish
mutations. We demonstrated this by rapidly localizing four
previously unmapped mutations to narrow genomic intervals. Furthermore, we developed a PCR-based approach for
genotyping individual RAD markers and used it to refine one
region rapidly. The utility of the RAD Amp approach is
derived from its ability to detect rare alleles in a pooled population. Thus, RAD microarrays allow the screening of thousands of markers in a single hybridization, and the RAD Amp
approach allows the screening of a large number of individuals in a single PCR reaction.

comment

[23,24] may also improve RAD mapping experiments. Alternatively, increasing the genomic starting material would
allow increased isolation of RAD tag DNA such that RAD tags
could be directly labeled without amplification.

Genomic DNA samples were digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and short linkers (5'GACTCCTCGACTCTCACATCTGGACATA-3', 5'-Phos-AATTTATGTCCAGATGTGAGAGTC-3') were ligated to the fragment ends using previously described conditions [26]. PCR
reactions were carried out in 50 μl under the following conditions: 50 ng template, 1 × Thermopol Buffer (New England
Biolabs), 2.5 U Taq (New England Biolabs), 0.2 mmol/l
dNTPs (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), 0.4 μmol/
l forward primer, and 0.2 μmol/l reverse primer. Touchdown
amplification was applied, with primer annealing
temperature dropping 2°C every other cycle from 65°C to
55°C, after which 25 additional cycles were carried out [28]. A
volume of 5 μl of amplified sample was run on a 2% agarose
gel. Primers were designed with the following scheme. Forward primers contained 20 nucleotides complementary to the
linker sequence and eight nucleotides complementary to the
genomic sequence. A mismatch was introduced near the 3'
end to discourage aberrant extension in the absence of linker
[29]. Reverse primers were designed from RAD tag clone
sequence to produce products about 300 base pairs in length
(Figure 5b).
