Early evolution of the biotin-dependent
carboxylase family
Jonathan Lombard and David Moreira*

Abstract
Background: Biotin-dependent carboxylases are a diverse family of carboxylating enzymes widespread in the three
domains of life, and thus thought to be very ancient. This family includes enzymes that carboxylate acetyl-CoA,
propionyl-CoA, methylcrotonyl-CoA, geranyl-CoA, acyl-CoA, pyruvate and urea. They share a common catalytic
mechanism involving a biotin carboxylase domain, which fixes a CO2 molecule on a biotin carboxyl carrier peptide,
and a carboxyl transferase domain, which transfers the CO2 moiety to the specific substrate of each enzyme.
Despite this overall similarity, biotin-dependent carboxylases from the three domains of life carrying their reaction
on different substrates adopt very diverse protein domain arrangements. This has made difficult the resolution of
their evolutionary history up to now.
Results: Taking advantage of the availability of a large amount of genomic data, we have carried out
phylogenomic analyses to get new insights on the ancient evolution of the biotin-dependent carboxylases. This
allowed us to infer the set of enzymes present in the last common ancestor of each domain of life and in the last
common ancestor of all living organisms (the cenancestor). Our results suggest that the last common archaeal
ancestor had two biotin-dependent carboxylases, whereas the last common bacterial ancestor had three. One of
these biotin-dependent carboxylases ancestral to Bacteria most likely belonged to a large family, the CoA-bearingsubstrate carboxylases, that we define here according to protein domain composition and phylogenetic analysis.
Eukaryotes most likely acquired their biotin-dependent carboxylases through the mitochondrial and plastid
endosymbioses as well as from other unknown bacterial donors. Finally, phylogenetic analyses support previous
suggestions about the existence of an ancient bifunctional biotin-protein ligase bound to a regulatory transcription
factor.
Conclusions: The most parsimonious scenario for the early evolution of the biotin-dependent carboxylases,
supported by the study of protein domain composition and phylogenomic analyses, entails that the cenancestor
possessed two different carboxylases able to carry out the specific carboxylation of pyruvate and the non-specific
carboxylation of several CoA-bearing substrates, respectively. These enzymes may have been able to participate in
very diverse metabolic pathways in the cenancestor, such as in ancestral versions of fatty acid biosynthesis,
anaplerosis, gluconeogenesis and the autotrophic fixation of CO2.

Background
Biotin-dependent carboxylases are a group of enzymes
present in the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria
and Eucarya) able to catalyze the fixation of CO2 on different specific substrates. They participate in many
essential metabolic functions as diverse as the autotrophic fixation of CO2, the biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids, the gluconeogenesis, the anaplerotic

production of oxaloacetate or the degradation of some
amino acids [1-10]. These enzymes belong to the larger
biotin-enzyme family that also contains some biotindependent decarboxylases and transcarboxylases [11].
Members of the biotin-enzyme family share functional
domains and reaction mechanisms and are characterized
by their dependence on covalently bound biotin as a
cofactor. Biotin, also called vitamin H, is a prosthetic
group made up of a valerate side chain attached to a
bicyclic ring consisting of one ureido and one thiophan

carboxylase (BC) domain and a carboxyl transferase
(CT) domain [11]. BCCP is the biotinylated element,
which is also shared with the decarboxylases and transcarboxylases of the large biotin-enzyme family. BC catalyzes
the ATP-dependent fixation of CO2 to the BCCP-bound
biotin, and thus the intermediate formation of carboxybiotin. Finally, CT binds the carboxyl group from the carboxybiotin to the specific substrate of each carboxylase

of the biotin-dependent carboxylases.
The biotin-dependent carboxylase family includes the
acetyl-CoA carboxylases, the propionyl-CoA carboxylases,
the methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylases, the geranyl-CoA
carboxylases, the acyl-CoA carboxylases, the pyruvate
carboxylases and the urea carboxylases. They share a
common catalytic mechanism and three functional components: a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), a biotin

the biotin-dependent carboxylases. Biotin (in green) is first activated to biotinyl-5’-AMP by BPL, then it is transferred by the same enzyme to a
biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Biotin-dependent carboxylases (in purple) are made up of a biotin carboxylase domain (BC), a carboxyl
transferase domain (CT) and the BCCP. The BC domain fixes a CO2 molecule to the BCCP-bound biotin and then the CT component binds the

Before the carboxylation reaction can occur, an independent protein called biotin protein ligase (BPL, also named
holocarboxylase synthetase or BirA; E.C. 6.3.4.9; 6.3.4.10;
6.3.4.11; 6.3.4.15) is in charge of the post-transcriptionally
attachment of the biotin to a specific conserved lysine residue of the BCCP [12,13]. BPL first adenylates the carboxyl
group of the valerate chain of the biotin molecule, then
the resulting biotinyl-5’-AMP molecule is used to transfer
the biotin moiety to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue of BCCP [14,15]. As each carboxylase has its own
BCCP counterpart, it was first thought that each BCCP
had one specific BPL devoted to its biotinylation, but subsequent studies have shown that each organism has
usually only one BPL protein able to biotinylate the BCCP
counterparts from different carboxylases. BPL has even
been reported to be able to biotinylate heterologous BCCP
elements from other species [12,16,17]. Four types of BPL
have been described (Figure 2A, [18]). In prokaryotes,
there is one monofunctional sequence bearing only the
BPL function [14] and one bifunctional BPL-regulatory
gene (BirA). The latter is known to carry, in addition to
the BPL catalytic domain, an N-terminus regulatory
domain that participates in the transcriptional control of
genes involved in biotin biosynthesis [19,20]. Structural
comparison and meticulous similarity searches have
shown that the BPL biotinylating domain is related to
diverse enzymes, including lipoyl protein ligases (LPLs),
asparagine synthetases and class II aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases [21]. The BPL catalytic domain and the regulatory N-terminal motif have been proposed to have
emerged and fused before the radiation of Archaea and
Bacteria [22-24]. Concerning the eukaryotes, the N-terminal halves of their BPLs are very diverse: plant BPL contains an N-terminal domain of unknown function and, in
contrast with the bacterial N-terminal motif, unable to
control the expression of biotin biosynthesis genes [25]. In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a longer N-terminal domain
interacting with biotin appears to be involved in the regulation of certain genes (biotin sensing, see Pirner et al.
[26]).
As previously mentioned, the BCCP domain is characteristic of all the biotin enzyme family, including the
decarboxylases and transcarboxylases, whereas the BC
domain is limited to the carboxylases. The CT domain
gives its substrate specificity to each biotin-dependent
carboxylase. Although all biotin-dependent carboxylases
bear these three types of protein domains, their arrangement is unequal among different carboxylases and from
one domain of life to another. This arrangement will be
briefly summarized below (Figure 2B).
Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC; E.C. 6.4.1.2) catalyze the
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in different
metabolic processes, such as the first step of fatty acid
synthesis or the autotrophic 3-hydroxyproprionate

pathway. In Escherichia coli, which bears a model bacterial
ACC, the three protein domains are encoded by four independent peptides: one BC subunit, one BCCP peptide and
two distantly related CT subunits interacting together to
ensure the carboxyl transfer function [8]. It is noteworthy
that these two distantly related CT subunits are part of a
single peptide in all the other biotin-dependent carboxylases bearing them, so here we will refer to the fused peptide as a CT domain and explicitly point to the separation
of the CT subunits in bacterial ACC sequences when
required. In eukaryotes, the three domains are encoded in
a single polypeptide arranged as BC-BCCP-CT from the
N- to the C-terminus [1]. Propionyl-CoA carboxylases
(PCC; E.C 6.4.1.3) attach one carboxyl group to the propionyl-CoA to synthesize the methylmalonyl-CoA taking
part in the 3-hydroxypropionate pathway of CO2 fixation,
in the synthesis of polyketides and in the degradation of
fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. In bacteria
and eukaryotes, PCCs are made up of two polypeptides: a
BC-BCCP a-subunit, and a CT-bearing b-subunit. Recent
work has shown an additional domain (BC-CT interaction
domain, called BT) involved in subunit interactions and
located between the BC and the BCCP motifs in the asubunit [27]. Archaea were thought for a long time to lack
ACC and PCC since fatty acids were unknown in this
domain of life. Nevertheless, fatty acid synthesis and
degradation has been recently detected in archaea and one
biotin-dependent carboxylase, using both acetyl-CoA and
propionyl-CoA as substrates, has been described in the 3hydroxyproprionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway of CO2
fixation of the archaeal order Sulfolobales [6,28,29]. This
archaeal ACC/PCC is composed of three different types of
subunits bearing respectively BC, BCCP and CT domains.
The 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC; E.C.
6.4.1.4) and the geranyl-CoA carboxylase (GCC; E.C.
6.4.1.5) synthesize 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA and g-carboxygeranyl-CoA by adding one CO2 molecule to their
respective substrates. MCC is involved in the breakdown
of leucine and acyclic monoterpenes of the citronellol
family, whereas GCC appears to participate only in the
latter catabolism [9]. While MCC activity has been
demonstrated in bacteria and eukaryotes, GCC has only
been observed in bacteria. GCC has also been shown to
use substrates different from geranyl-CoA [30]. Both
MCC and GCC are composed of BC/BCCP-containing
a-subunits and CT-bearing b-subunits.
The acyl-CoA carboxylases are a heterogeneous group
of enzymes involved in the same pathways as ACC and
PCC and also carrying out important functions in the
synthesis of secondary metabolites in bacteria. Acyl-CoA
carboxylases are basically made up of two types of subunits, the first bearing the BC and the BCCP domains
and the second carrying the CT function [7]. As previously shown, this structure is also shared with PCCs,

MCCs and GCCs. Indeed, acyl-CoA carboxylases are
known to carboxylate acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA or
butyryl-CoA and, very often, several of these substrates.
These promiscuous acyl-CoA carboxylases have been
reported in Actinomycetes and Delta-proteobacteria
[7,31,32]. Such metabolic promiscuity has led to some
confusion in the literature. In the one hand, some
authors sometimes consider acyl-CoA carboxylases as

PCCs or ACCs according to their preferential substrate,
regardless of their possible promiscuous nature or origin
[7,31,32]. Moreover, these enzymes can easily change
their favorite substrate during evolution, as illustrated
by studies showing that the replacement of one single
precise residue in the CT sequence of one acyl-CoA carboxylase is enough to shift its substrate specificity
[33,34]. In the other hand, most comparative studies on

Lombard and Moreira BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/232

ACC, PCC and MCC activities very often consider each
function as being characteristic of one particular carboxylase, ignoring the potential promiscuity typical of these
enzymes [11]. Although such functional classifications
can be useful to study enzymes within particular metabolic pathways, they may lead to confusion between the
well-characterized one-substrate specific carboxylases
and promiscuous enzymes carrying out one particular
function in a given metabolic context. As an alternative,
a phylogenetic approach can complement the functional
studies to get new insights on the emergence of functions and classification of this family of enzymes.
Pyruvate carboxylases (PYC; E.C. 6.4.1.1) catalyze the
carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, an important
function for anaplerosis, gluconeogenesis and fatty acid
synthesis. A significant feature concerning the protein
domain composition of PYC is the homology of the BC
and BCCP domains with those of the rest of biotindependent carboxylases, in contrast with the independent
origin of the CT element. Most bacteria and eukaryotes
bear a polypeptidic PYC carrying the BC domain in its
N-terminal end, the CT in the central part and the BCCP
domain in the C-terminus [35]. Recent studies have discovered a domain situated between the BC and CT
domains and between the CT and BCCP domains in Rhizobium etli [36-38]. The new domain, referred to as the
PYC tetramerization (PT) or allosteric domain, would
play a role in tetramerization of PYC subunits and allosteric regulation of PYC by acetyl-CoA. Finally, archaea
and some bacteria contain an acetyl-CoA-independent
PYC with two different subunits instead of one polypeptide: the BC a-subunit and the CT/BCCP b-subunit
[39-42].
Urea carboxylases (UCA; E.C. 6.3.4.6) fix a carboxyl
group in urea to form allophanate, an intermediate product of a two-steps process of urea degradation. Allophanate is subsequently hydrolyzed by the allophanate
hydrolase to ammonia and CO2. While in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae the allophanate hydrolase and the urea carboxylase are fused within the same polypeptide [43], in the
alpha-proteobacterium Oleomonas sagaranensis and
green algae these two functions are carried out by two
independent enzymes homologous to the unique S. cerevisiae peptide [44]. The O. sagaranensis urea carboxylase
is a polypeptide by itself containing a BC domain in its
N-terminal end, a BCCP domain in its C-terminus and a
predicted central CT domain non-homologous to the
previously cited CTs.
These examples illustrate the very complex modular
architecture of the biotin-dependent carboxylases, which
has been studied for long [45]. This family has been proposed to have evolved by duplication, fusion and recombination events from small monofunctional precursors to
produce the modern multifunctional polypeptides

[11,45]. The ubiquity of the biotin-dependent carboxylases in the three domains of life and the diversification
of their elements have been pointed as arguments for the
ancient origin of this family [46,47]. However, hitherto
the phylogenetic analyses of biotin-dependent carboxylases have been focused in relatively restricted groups
and functions [9,32] or have been carried out with a very
limited taxonomic sampling [4,47]. In this work, we
attempt to reconstruct the early evolution of the biotindependent carboxylases using a global phylogenomic
approach in a wide range of taxonomic groups. Our
results support previous hypothesis concerning the modular emergence of enzymes of the biotin carboxylase
family but also challenge current views on the relationships among different groups of enzymes, especially
those related to the acyl-CoA carboxylases. On the basis
of phylogenetic evidence, we have tried to define the
ancestral content of enzymes from the biotin-dependent
carboxylase family in the respective last common ancestor of each domain of life and in the last common ancestor of all living organisms (the cenancestor).

Results
As mentioned above, the polypeptide composition can
largely vary from one biotin-dependent carboxylase to
another. Therefore, we have studied each functional
protein domain separately. Unlike the biotin carboxylase
(BC) domain, which is shared among all the biotindependent carboxylases, three non-homologous carboxyl
transferase (CT) domains exist in these enzymes: one is
common to the ACC, all the PCC, the MCC, the GCC
and the acyl-CoA carboxylases and will be called here
the CoA-substrate related carboxyl transferase (CCT);
another is characteristic of the PYC and will be called
the pyruvate carboxylase carboxyl transferase (PCT);
finally, UCAs seem to use their own CT (UCT).
Phylogenetic analysis of the BC domain

The biotin carboxylase domain (BC) is the main distinctive feature shared among all the biotin-dependent
carboxylases with respect to the biotin-dependent decarboxylases and transcarboxylases. A critical step in
our study was the assignment of each one of the BC
domain sequences to their specific function. As the BC
domain is a very well conserved motif, it is difficult to
distinguish the actual substrate specificity of one precise BC-encoding sequence only on the basis of primary sequence characteristics. Consequently, we
constructed preliminary BC domain phylogenetic trees
(see Methods and additional file 1) in order to classify
each sequence according to a phylogenetic framework.
Functional assignment of the bacterial sequences
was summarized in a presence-and-absence pattern
(Table 1, for complete data see additional file 2).

Numbers next to phyla names correspond to the number of complete genome sequences upon which the search was carried out (see additional file 2 for the
complete list). +++, homologues could be found in more than 50% of the genome sequences; +, homologues could be found in less than 50% of the complete
genome sequences; -, no homologues found; *, only one genome sequence from these phyla was analyzed.

It is important to note that the BC domain related to the
ACC function could be found in almost all bacterial
groups, with the exception of Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes and Thermotogales. The PYC polypeptide bearing the BC domain was less widespread but could be
found in Alpha- and Delta-proteobacteria, Acidobacteria,
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes
and some organisms from the Chlamydiae-Verrucomicrobia group. Instead of this fused polypeptide, Aquificales and Epsilon-proteobacteria bear an independent
PYC-BC domain forming a separate subunit from the
CT-BCCP domains. In contrast to the largely distributed
ACC and PYC, MCC was limited to Alpha-, Beta- and
Gamma-proteobacteria, whereas monofunctional PCC
was restricted to Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria. UCA
was found scattered in some representatives of Alpha-,
Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria, of the ChlamydiaeVerrucomicrobia group and of Acidobacteria. Finally,

acyl-CoA carboxylases were found to be moderately distributed in all groups of Proteobacteria (except for the
Epsilon division), Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Chlorobi, Deinococcus-Thermus
group and one spirochete. In addition to these bacterial
sequences, the eukaryotic BC sequences formed well
defined functional groups closely related to their bacterial
homologues. The only exception to this observation in
our preliminary results were the very divergent eukaryotic polypeptidic ACCs, which formed an independent
clade probably induced by a long branch attraction artifact due to the acceleration of evolutionary rates subsequent to the polypeptidic fusion of ACC. ACC, PYC,
MCC and PCC are widely distributed throughout eukaryotes, while UCA and acyl-CoA carboxylases are limited
to fungi and some green algae.
In order to improve the resolution of the BC domain
phylogeny, we selected representative sequences from

Lombard and Moreira BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/232

the complete dataset to carry out maximum likelihood
(ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analyses.
The resulting trees were similar to each other, so only
the ML tree was shown here (Figure 3, the same holds
for the trees of the other protein domains and their
respective figures). The BC domain phylogeny confirmed
the previous functional classification and supported the
monophyly of most bacterial sequences within each
functional group. Multifunctional acyl-CoA carboxylase
sequences formed different clusters branching at deep
nodes of the tree. Eukaryotic sequences clustered again
within the groups of their functional bacterial
counterparts.
In all trees shown above, the archaeal sequences did not
form a monophyletic group but were split in several clades
within the paraphyletic group of acyl-CoA carboxylases.
Nevertheless, these archaeal clades were close to each
other, suggesting that they could actually be monophyletic
but artificially divided into different clades because of a
lack of phylogenetic signal or a phylogenetic reconstruction artifact. As there was little doubt about the position
of the eukaryotic sequences with respect to the bacterial
ones, we proceeded to the removal of all eukaryotic
sequences in order to try to improve the resolution for the
prokaryotic sequences, in particular the archaeal ones
(Figure 4). As in previous phylogenies, a bacterial ACC
clade could be observed in the resulting tree. MCC, UCA
and monofunctional-PCC clades branched within a paraphyletic acyl-CoA carboxylase assemblage, and there was a
cluster containing all archaeal sequences and bacterial
PYCs. Archaeal sequences were not monophyletic but
archaeal phyla were retrieved. They occupied closely
related basal branches of the PYC cluster with relatively
weak support. Consequently, the possibility of an artificial
division of archaeal sequences related to a phylogenetic
reconstruction artifact could not yet be excluded. We
tested this alternative using an unbiased AU test to statically compare the topology shown in Figure 4 with a tree
in which the monophyly of archaea was constrained (see
Methods). The monophyly of archaea could not be
rejected by the test (P = 0.44), so archaeal sequences may
be monophyletic, as it will be discussed later (see the PCT
domain phylogeny section). Interestingly, the BC domain
sequences of archaeal ACC-PCC sequences did not cluster
among the acyl-CoA carboxylases as could have been
expected, but branched among the archaeal PYC
sequences. Several bacterial sequences from Aquificales
and Epsilon-proteobacteria branched very close to the
archaeal sequences, suggesting that they may have
acquired these genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
from archaeal donors. One representative of these bacterial sequences (Aquifex aeolicus) has indeed been deeply
studied and shown to adopt an archaeal PYC structure

(i.e., two types of subunits instead of one sole polypeptide)
and to actually carry out the PYC function [38,42].
Phylogenetic analysis of the CT domains: The CoA-related
carboxyl transferase (CCT)

Since CCT is shared by enzymatic complexes catalyzing
carboxylation of different substrates, the first stage of
our analysis was to predict the function of each
sequence. As for the BC domain analysis described
above, a phylogenetic analysis (additional file 1) allowed
the functional assignment of CCT sequences based on
their position in the resulting phylogenetic tree (results
summarized in Table 1, for complete data see additional
file 2).
All bacterial species, except the Thermotogales, Spirochaetes and most Actinobacteria, harbored the two CCTbearing subunits of the bacterial ACC. These independent
subunits were very divergent from the rest of the fused
CCT domains, probably as a consequence of the separation of the two units in independent peptides. The preliminary phylogenies were congruent with the main
bacterial groups within the bacterial ACC clusters. CCT
homologues of MCC could be detected in Alpha-, Beta-,
and Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi, whereas the CCT domain of monofunctional PCC
could only be found in Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria. A
CCT protein domain of acyl-CoA carboxylases (including
GCC and likely multifunctional PCCs) could be found in
all the proteobacterial groups except the Epsilon-division,
in Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria (which possess a high
number of paralogues), Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, some Chlorobi, the Deinococcus-Thermus group,
Thermotogales and Fusobacteria. Despite a few differences
between the BC-domain and the CCT-domain detection
(see additional file 2), these results largely matched our
previous observations on the presence-absence patterns of
the BC domain, supporting the validity of our phylogenetic
approach to discriminate sequences according to their
functions. Concerning the CCT sequences from eukaryotes, the results from the preliminary phylogenetic reconstructions coincided with those of the BC domain in that
all the eukaryotic sequences but the ACC branched in
close relationship with their bacterial homologues. As in
the BC domain phylogeny, eukaryotic ACC-CCTs formed
a highly divergent cluster, what may probably be explained
as the result of sequence divergence subsequent to the
fusion of different ACC domains into one unique
polypeptide.
To improve the resolution of the CCT phylogeny, we
selected representative sequences to carry out ML and
BI phylogenetic analyses (the CCT subunits of the bacterial ACC and the eukaryotic ACC were removed
because of their extreme sequence divergence), with

similar results between both techniques (Figure 5). CCT
sequences have diverged from each other more than the
BC sequences did and, thus, CCT trees are characterized
by long branches. Although some HGTs could be identified, major accepted bacterial groups were found
within the functional groups described before, suggesting vertical inheritance as a major process to explain
their presence in the bacterial genomes. Eukaryotic CCT
sequences were also monophyletic within their functional groups and strongly related to their bacterial
counterparts.
Finally, although CCT homologues could be detected
in a wide diversity of archaeal genomes, we did not
retrieve the monophyly of these archaeal sequences in
the CCT phylogenies. The statistical support for the
separation into several archaeal subgroups was weak, so
we tested the possibility that they actually form a monophyletic assemblage by using an unbiased AU test to
compare the tree shown in Figure 5 with a tree in which
we forced the monophyly of the archaeal sequences (see
Methods). The latter could not be rejected by the AU
test (P = 0.12), opening the possibility that the archaeal
sequences may be monophyletic and that the topology
observed could be affected by a phylogenetic reconstruction artifact.
Phylogenetic analysis of the CT domains: The pyruvate
carboxylase carboxyl transferase (PCT)

Although the PCT domain is characteristic of PYC and is
not shared by any other biotin-dependent carboxylase,
the oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODC; E.C. 4.1.1.3, which
takes part in Na + transport in some bacteria) is also
known to use an a-subunit homologous to the PCT
domain [48]. Consequently, ODC a-subunit sequences
were incorporated into our phylogenetic analyses. In
addition, some extremely divergent bacterial homologues
showed similarity to transcarboxylases, but we will not
treat them here because of their very poor sequence
conservation.
A preliminary tree was used to select a set of representative sequences to reconstruct accurate phylogenies with
ML and BI methods (Figure 6). PCT phylogenetic trees
showed high divergence between two types of sequences.
On the one hand, the PCT domain of bacteria and eukaryotes, which is integrated in their PYC polypeptides. On
the other hand, the archaeal-type PCT, found in the bsubunit of the archaeal PYC, in the PCT a-subunit of
ODC and in divergent sequences of unknown function in
some bacteria, especially in Chlorobi and Epsilon-proteobacteria species. As expected, the PCT domain of the
polypeptidic PYC sequences showed the same distribution and phylogeny as the BC domain of the same PYC
sequences. In particular, the PCT phylogeny supported
the monophyly of the bacterial phyla and the position of

Page 10 of 22

the eukaryotic lineage within the bacterial radiation. The
phylogeny of the archaeal PCT sequences was also congruent with the accepted archaeal groups. The archaeal
cluster contained the bacteria known to carry the
archaeal BC-PYC subunit (see above) and some Firmicutes. This result supported an HGT from these archaea
to the concerned bacterial groups. Well-characterized
ODC homologues are distributed in a limited group of
Gamma-proteobacteria and some sporadic bacteria, what
supports the restriction of this function to a very small
diversity of organisms.
Phylogenetic analysis of the CT domains: The urea
carboxylase carboxyl transferase (UCT)

Compared to the rest of enzymes of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family, little is known about the reaction mechanism and biochemical properties of UCA.
Although significant similarities to the BC and BCCP
domains have been identified in the UCA gene from the
alpha-proteobacterium Oleomonas sagaranensis, almost
no information exists for the predicted central UCT
domain [44]. Similarity searches carried out with this
central domain retrieved a protein domain annotated as
allophanate hydrolase, probably because the first identified UCA gene was the one of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
in which the allophanate hydrolase and the UCA genes
are part of a single polypeptide. Thus, the proposed
O. sagaranensis UCT domain has been annotated as an
allophanate hydrolase although it most likely takes part
in the UCT function instead of in the allophanate
hydrolase.
Fused S. cerevisiae-like UCA-allophanate hydrolase
polypeptides were found only in some eukaryotes,
whereas O. sagaranensis-like UCAs containing a BC, a
BCCP and the hypothetical UCT domain were detected
in some Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria, some
Actinobacteria and some eukaryotes. Finally, our UCT
searches led to the finding of two hypothetical homologous genes in some bacterial and archaeal (Thermococcales) genomes. One of these genes was similar to the
N-terminal region of the predicted UCT whereas the
other was similar to the C-terminal region. These two
genes were frequently found adjacent to each other in
the concerned genomes, but none of them has been studied so far, and thus, functional data are not available.
Analysis of the BT/PT domain

As mentioned above, extra protein domains involved in
subunit interactions have been recently reported in PYC
sequences of Rhizobium etli, Staphylococcus aureus and
Homo sapiens [36-38] and in PCC of Ruegeria pomeroyi
[27]. In the former, the extra domain was called PT
(PYC tetramerization) and was shown to contribute to
allosteric regulation in addition to subunit interaction.

PT is split in two parts, the first between the BC and
the PCT domains, and the second between the PCT and
the BCCP domains (Figure 2). In PCC, the protein
domain relevant for subunit interaction was called BT
(BC-CT interaction domain) and found to be located
between the BC and the BCCP domains of the PCC asubunit. Although the BT and the PT domains shared
little primary sequence similarity, structural comparisons
revealed striking resemblances concerning above all one
helix structure followed by several b-strands. Further
structural predictions suggested that the intermediate
region between the BC and the BCCP domain of eukaryotic ACC is similar to BT/PT domains [27], supporting
that this feature may be widely shared among biotindependent carboxylases.
Consequently, we attempted to identify BT/PT-like
domains within other biotin-dependent carboxylases.
High sequence similarity to BT and PT could only be
identified among PCC and PYC sequences, respectively,
confirming previous results [27,38]. In addition, we
observed a protein region of 100-140 residues flanked by
BC and BCCP domains in a-subunits from MCC, GCC
and acyl-CoA carboxylases (reported in Figure 2 as
domains of unknown function). We used two different
algorithms (see Methods) to carry out secondary structure searches on the linkers of the MCC, GCC, archaeal
and bacterial PYC and acyl-CoA carboxylase sequences.
The helix structure characteristic of the BT function in
PCC [27] was predicted in all linkers tested, except the
acyl-CoA carboxylase characterized by Rodriguez et al.
[7], for which the two methods applied were not consistent with each other. This enzyme is known to use a supplementary subunit called accE that is involved in
subunit interaction [49]. Interestingly, a helix structure
was detected in this accE that might carry out the same
function as in the BT/PT domain.

The biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain is a
short biotinylated peptide (~ 90 amino acids) often fused
to the other constitutive domains of the biotin-dependent
carboxylases. Its short size and participation in very different polypeptide architectures make difficult to reconstruct
accurate phylogenies using the BCCP sequences. Consequently, instead of analyzing the short BCCP domain itself,
we decided to study the phylogeny of the biotin protein
ligase (BPL) responsible of its biotinylation.
In eukaryotes, BPL occurs in a polypeptide in which
the C-terminal end bears the BPL function, whereas little is known about the function of the very diverse Nterminal region. As previously mentioned, two main
types of BPL can be found in prokaryotes: the so-called
BPL that solely bears a BPL function, and BirA, that has
a DNA-binding domain in its N-terminus responsible

Page 13 of 22

for a transcriptional regulatory role. Although quaternary structure differences among different taxa have been
major concerns in previous literature [23,24,50,51], we
will only consider here the major distinction concerning
the bifunctionality of BirA with respect to the monofunctionality of BPL [22]. Accordingly, we classified prokaryotic sequences into the BPL or BirA groups on the
basis of the absence or presence of the DNA-binding Nterminal domain, respectively. Noteworthy, we observed
that several BirA sequences lacked the conserved positions important for the regulatory function as established by Mukhopadhyay et al. [18]. Except for some
rare cases that had already been reported (Clostridium
acetobutylicum, Lactococcus lactis, Halobacterium sp.,
Pyrococcus abyssii, Pyrococcus furiosus), our BPL-BirA
searches confirmed the presence of only one BPL homologue in each prokaryotic genome. The BPL protein was
widespread in Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya and its
phylogeny was congruent with the accepted main taxonomic groups within each domain (Figure 7), supporting
that an ancient BPL function existed in the three
domains of life. Nevertheless, instead of finding monophyletic groups containing uniform functional clades,
our results showed the monofunctional and the bifunctional sequences as being mixed up all over the prokaryotic part of the tree whatever the reconstruction
method or representative sequence selection dataset was
used. Some species bearing both BPL and BirA genes, as
Halobacterium sp. and C. acetobutylicum, had their
respective BPL close to their own BirA in phylogenetic
trees, whereas P. abyssii, P. furiosus and L. lactis BPL
and BirA genes branched very far from each other.

Discussion
The large distribution of biotin-dependent carboxylases
and their remarkable mechanistic conservation has been
interpreted as an evidence for the ancient origin of this
enzyme family [46,47]. However, phylogenetic analyses of
biotin-dependent carboxylases carried so far were either
restricted to some functions and taxonomic groups or
used very limited taxonomic sampling [4,9,32,47]. For the
first time, here we studied the early evolution of the biotin-dependent carboxylases using a global phylogenomic
approach in a wide range of taxonomic groups. Our
results support the ancient origin of this family and give
new insights on the evolutionary history of these protein
domains and enzymes. In particular, we have observed
that the domains of life are different with regard to the
importance of the biotin-dependent carboxylases in their
metabolism and evolution. Consequently, we will first
discuss the evolution of these enzymes in each domain of
life, prior to conclude on how our results provide information about the biotin-dependent carboxylase content
in the cenancestor.

Biotin-dependent carboxylases in Bacteria

The high diversity of biotin-dependent carboxylase paralogues found in the bacterial domain reflects the major role
of these enzymes in bacterial metabolism. The presenceabsence study combined to the BC and CCT phylogenies
supported the wide distribution and monophyly of bacterial ACC, suggesting that it is ancestral to this domain of
life. Similarly, the PCT phylogeny suggested that the polypeptidic PYC is monophyletic and widespread enough to
support the ancestral presence of this carboxylase in Bacteria. In contrast, the BC domain devoted to UCA activity
is limited to a restricted number of bacteria branching
within the acyl-CoA carboxylases from which it probably
emerged. Proteins homologous to UCT are distributed
among a wider range of bacteria, but these are hypothetical genes and their function is unknown. In order to
explain why the distribution of UCT is larger than that of
the UCA-related BC, two possibilities exist: either UCT
could be specific of biotin-dependent carboxylation and
collaborate with other BCs to specifically carry out this
function, or the UCT domain could have been recruited
from another biochemical reaction, so that certain UCT
homologues that we can detect would be representatives
of the original function. Thus, there is not enough information to advance a confident hypothesis on UCAs origins, but available evidence could hardly support an
ancient origin of UCA in Bacteria and rather suggests its
recent emergence and spread by frequent HGT among
bacteria.
Sequences annotated as acyl-CoA carboxylases were
found to be paraphyletic in BC and CCT phylogenies
(Figures 3, 4 and 5). Duplication and HGT events have
undoubtedly been of major importance in their evolution, as paralogues and xenologues could be detected in
our analyses. Nevertheless, the acyl-CoA carboxylases
were distributed in a wide range of bacteria and most
often clustered into clades congruent with the accepted
main bacterial groups. Moreover, several arguments supported that GCC, MCC and PCC are parts of the acylCoA carboxylases: i) GCC, MCC and PCC sequences
branched among sequences previously annotated as
acyl-CoA carboxylases in our BC and CCT domain phylogenetic trees (Figures 3, 4 and 5); ii) MCCs and monofunctional PCCs were restricted to some proteobacterial
groups, supporting the emergence of MCC and PCC
functions from an original acyl-CoA carboxylase in a
proteobacterial ancestor; iii) the GCC, MCC and PCC
sequences shared a common domain architecture with
the acyl-CoA carboxylases (Figure 2); iv) some GCC and
PCC have been reported to carry out the carboxylation
of different substrates, a promiscuity which is characteristic of the acyl-CoA carboxylases [7,30,32]. As a result,
our phylogeny-based classification of GCC, MCC and
PCC sequences into the acyl-CoA carboxylase group is

Page 15 of 22

reliable and strongly supports that these functions are
specific adaptations from a promiscuous acyl-CoA carboxylase-like protein according to the metabolic needs
of each species, a common process in enzyme evolution
[52,53]. Indeed, functional flexibility of acyl-CoA carboxylases may be of major importance in relatively rapid
adaptation strategies concerning bacterial metabolism
[5,54,55] since minor precise sequence modifications
have been shown to easily change their function [33].
This enlarges our perspective on the emergence of
GCCs, MCCs, PCCs and acyl-CoA carboxylases with
respect to previous considerations [9,11]
In the available literature, promiscuous acyl-CoA carboxylases are called ACCases [7], but this name can be
easily confused with ACCs that specifically carboxylate
acetyl-CoA. Thus, a more explicit name should be given
to the whole group including PCC, MCC, GCC and acylCoA carboxylase sequences in order to point out their
common origin whatever their substrate specificity would
have become throughout evolution. Therefore, we propose
to call this group XCC, for “any CoA-bearing-substrate
carboxylase”. XCC enzymes are characterized by two subunit types (one BC-BCCP and one CCT), the specificity
and quaternary structure of which would have evolved
from one generic biotin-dependent enzyme ancestral to
bacteria.
Recent works have reported a BT domain located in
between the BC and the BCCP domains of the PCC asubunit [27]. The BT domain has been proposed to be of
major relevance for subunit interaction and even though
our sequence similarity searches did not identify unequivocally a BT domain in other XCC enzymes, a region of
unknown function could be detected between the BC and
BCCP domains of all XCC a-subunits. That region shared
low sequence similarity with the PCC BT domain but was
predicted to contain a helix structure as in the BT/PT
domain. Acyl-CoA carboxylases that lack that characteristic helix have been shown to need an additional accE subunit for normal domain interaction [7,32,49], and we have
found that the accE also contains a helix structure.
Although functional confirmation is required, these results
suggest that this unknown region in XCC might be an
essential homologue of the BT domain. Therefore, the
accE subunit of some acyl-CoA carboxylases would be a
substitute developed in BT-lacking a-subunits.
In summary, the presence-absence analyses and the
phylogenies of BC, CCT, PCT and UCT support the
ancestral presence of ACC, PYC and XCC in bacteria. In
addition, specific functions would have arisen from XCCs
by duplication, subfunctionalization and HGT events
across bacterial evolution. Nevertheless, the absence of
some of these enzymes in several bacterial lineages that
have been proposed to have diverged early in the bacterial domain (such as the Thermotogae and Aquificae)

Lombard and Moreira BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/232

opens the possibility that they may have evolved after the
last common ancestor of all Bacteria. Therefore, the analysis of the content of biotin-dependent carboxylases in
the other domains of life is necessary to infer whether
these enzymes are ancestral or not.
Biotin-dependent carboxylases in eukaryotes

In most of our biotin-dependent carboxylase phylogenies,
eukaryotic sequences branch within their bacterial homologues, what strongly supports HGTs events from bacteria to an ancestor of the eukaryotes as the most likely
way for them to have acquired these enzymes. Some of
these HGTs probably took place through endosymbiosis,
as suggested by the cellular localization of eukaryotic
PCCs and MCCs in mitochondria [56,57] and the mitochondria-targeting signal peptides observed in their
N-terminal regions. In addition to the typical eukaryotic
ACC polypeptide, plastid-bearing eukaryotes also carry a
bacterial-like multi-subunit ACC [8] with an N-terminal
region containing a plastid-targeting sequence. Contrary
to typical eukaryotic ACC polypeptides that form an
independent group, these eukaryotic bacterial-like ACCs
branch among cyanobacterial ACCs, strongly supporting
an endosymbiotic origin (Figure 3).
Targeting sequences seem to be absent from eukaryotic
PYC and ACC. Both BC- and PCT-domain phylogenies
strongly support the branching of eukaryotic PYC
sequences among their bacterial homologues, what indicates a bacterial origin even though the vector of this
HGT cannot be specified. Surprisingly, concerning the
eukaryotic ACCs, the phylogenetic reconstructions are at
odds with protein domain comparison. On the one hand,
eukaryotic ACCs branch among bacterial ACC sequences
in preliminary CCT and accurate BC phylogenies (additional file 1 and Figure 3, respectively), suggesting that
bacterial donors are at the origin to these sequences. However, eukaryotic ACC sequences form extremely divergent
groups in both BC and CTT phylogenies, probably as a
consequence of rapid evolution subsequent to the fusion
of these domains to generate the eukaryotic ACC polypeptide. Thus, reconstruction artifacts are likely and little confidence can be given to the position of eukaryotic
sequences in these phylogenies. On the other hand, protein domain composition of eukaryotic ACC is very different from those of PYCs and bacterial ACCs, but shares
strong similarity with that of XCC (Figure 2). Huang et al.
proposed that the most likely way to explain the unique
domain composition of eukaryotic ACC is a fusion event
between the a- and b-subunits of XCC on both sides of a
central linker [27]. The elucidation of the function of the
BT/PT domain of eukaryotic ACCs will be necessary to
decide between the XCC and the bacterial ACC origin for
the eukaryotic ACC polypeptides.

Page 16 of 22

Finally, the BC phylogeny indicates that UCA genes
were acquired recently and independently by fungi and
green algae from bacteria. Whereas eukaryotes have
maintained the same domain structure than their bacterial counterparts for PYC, MCC, PCC and bacterialtype ACC, the components of eukaryotic ACC and
UCA have fused to generate large polypeptides.
Biotin-dependent carboxylases in Archaea

Although recent studies have revealed the importance of
biotin-dependent carboxylases in Archaea, little is known
about their origin and evolution [28,29,40]. These enzymes
are much less abundant and diversified in Archaea than in
the other two domains of life, but their study could be of
major interest in understanding the emergence and
ancient evolution of several central metabolic pathways in
these organisms [58]. In Archaea, the BC domain is
encoded by an independent subunit in both the PYC and
the ACC-PCC complexes, instead of being a part of wider
polypeptides. BC sequences are widespread among archaea
and their phylogeny shows that major archaeal groups
form monophyletic clades, which are more closely related
among them than to any other taxon. This evidence supports the ancestral presence of the BC domain in Archaea
and points to its vertical inheritance in this domain of life.
Surprisingly, archaeal BC sequences do not cluster
together with regard to the PYC and ACC-PCC functional
groups, but rather following the accepted phylogeny of
Archaea. This strongly supports the hypothesis for the
presence of one unique promiscuous BC subunit in the
last common archaeal ancestor that would have been
recruited in both, PYC and ACC-PCC functions. In the
other hand, the PCT phylogeny and its distribution in
archaea also indicate that the PYC function may have
existed in the archaeal common ancestor. Concerning the
ACC-PCC function, the wide distribution of the CCT
domain in archaea suggests that it could also be ancestral.
Moreover, even though archaeal CCT sequences were not
found to be monophyletic in our CCT phylogenies, the
AU test could not reject the hypothesis of the archaeal
monophyly, and thus the presence of a CCT subunit in
the archaeal common ancestor can be hypothesized. As a
result, one unique promiscuous BC subunit that collaborated with PCT and CCT subunits to catalyze their specific reactions may have existed in the last common
archaeal ancestor. Interestingly, such a collaboration of a
BC-encoding subunit with both the CCT and PCT systems has been suggested in Archaeoglobus fulgidus [59]
although, to our knowledge, this has not yet been experimentally tested. Our analyses support to extend this possibility to the ancestor of Archaea.
An alternative origin of archaeal biotin carboxylases
through ancient HGTs from bacteria cannot be completely

Lombard and Moreira BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/232

excluded. However, except for some particular cases limited to some specific organisms, the distribution and the
phylogenetic trees of the BC and the PCT domains are
congruent with the expected phylogeny of Archaea. As a
result, the hypothetical HGT events responsible for the
presence of the BC and PCT domains in Archaea should
have been ancient enough to predate the last common
archaeal ancestor, and thus HGT cannot be favored over
the simple vertical inheritance from the cenancestor. Concerning the CCT domain, some groups, as for example the
Halobacteriales, may have inherited their sequences by
HGT from bacterial donors, but our results do not provide
enough support neither to the monophyly of all archaeal
CCTs nor to the putative HGT-mediated origin of these
sequences, so this issue remains open.
Relatively recent HGT events cannot be ignored in the
study of the evolutionary history of biotin-dependent
carboxylases. They may have played an important role,
both in the case of closely related organisms (for example, HGTs of XCC among Actinobacteria), as well as for
distantly related taxa (e.g., the archaeal-type PYC transferred to some aquificales and epsilon-proteobacterial
species). HGTs may have also been at the origin of
completely new functions. For instance, bacterial ODC
has been recently proposed to use one decarboxylating
subunit common to all decarboxylases and a CT domain
from any other origin [60]. ODC-CT is restricted to a
limited number of anaerobic bacteria and is closely
related to archaeal PCT, what supports the archaeal origin of ODC-CT. Possible criticism against this HGT
hypothesis could be that the bacterial ODC sequences
do not branch within the archaeal PCT sequences but
as a sister group (Figure 6). Nevertheless, the divergence
of the bacterial sequences in order to acquire their new
function is likely to have induced a long branch attraction artifact in this phylogeny.
Occurrence of BCCP: BPL-BirA evolution in the three
domains of life

Contrarily to the rest of the protein domains involved in
biotin-dependent carboxylation, we did not analyzed the
evolution of the BCCP domain because of the limited phylogenetic signal due to its small size (~ 90 amino acids)
and low sequence conservation, which make the BCCP
phylogenies very sensitive to reconstruction artifacts. In
addition, this domain can be found in many different polypeptide architectures, including transcarboxylases and decarboxylases that are not part of our work. A phylogenetic
analysis of BCCPs published some years ago [59] supported the occurrence of many different fusion and fission
events with the PCT domains and only one fusion event
with the BC domain in the XCC sequences. Such complex
fusion and fission scenario should be balanced by the
recent discovery of the PT domains in PYC sequences

Page 17 of 22

[36], which makes independent fusions much less parsimonious than previously suggested.
We analyzed the biotin protein ligase (BPL) protein
domain instead of the BCCP domain itself in order to
reconstruct a more reliable phylogeny that could provide
indirect evidence of the BCCP content in the cenancestor. BPL is related to the lipoyl protein ligases [21] and is
responsible for the specific biotinylation of BCCP. In prokaryotes, some species bear a BPL gene, whereas others
contain BirA genes. BirA proteins consist of a transcriptional regulation domain in the N-terminus and a BPL
domain in the C-terminus. Because BirA could be found
in both bacteria and archaea, it has been proposed to be
the most ancient known transcriptional factor, already
present in the cenancestor [22]. Nevertheless, universal
phylogenetic analyses of BPL and BirA had never been
carried out to test this hypothesis.
Our results confirmed previous observations of single
BPL or BirA genes in each species. Except for some likely
HGTs events, our phylogenetic reconstructions of the BPL
protein domain showed a phylogeny congruent with the
main accepted taxonomic groups in the three domains of
life, suggesting a dominant vertical inheritance from the
common ancestor to all living organisms (Figure 7). The
most puzzling feature of this phylogeny was the distribution of the sequences bearing the N-terminal transcriptional regulation domain characteristic of BirA all over the
prokaryotic part of the BPL tree and mixed up with the
sequences lacking that domain. This observation could be
explained either by an ancestral BPL gene that would have
fused many independent times with the N-terminal transcriptional regulator to form different BirA genes, or by an
ancestral BirA gene that would have lost its N-terminal
regulatory domain in many lineages independently. As the
latter hypothesis appears more parsimonious than the former, our results tend to support the BirA gene to be
ancestral to all organisms, as previously proposed [22].
Finally, this evidence supporting the presence of the BPL
function in the cenancestor is an additional indirect argument in favor of the presence of the BCCP domain proteins in this ancestral organism.

Conclusions
To summarize, our data support that ACC, XCC and
PYC are ancestral to Bacteria. MCC, PCC, GCC and
UCA emerged subsequently from XCC in the bacterial
lineage. Eukaryotes most likely inherited their biotindependent carboxylases through different HGTs from
bacteria: MCC and PCC are related to alphaproteobacterial homologues and therefore seem to have been acquired
through the mitochondrial endosymbiosis, whereas plant
bacterial-like ACC is related to cyanobacterial homologues and thus of probable plastid origin. The remaining
eukaryotic enzymes (ACC, PYC and UCA) have likely

Lombard and Moreira BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/232

been also transferred from bacteria but their donors are
unknown. The last common archaeal ancestor likely used
a promiscuous BC subunit with PCT and CCT subunits
to ensure PYC and ACC/PCC functions, respectively.
Finally, the cenancestor likely bore a BirA gene able to
biotinylate BCCPs. We used these results to infer the set
of biotin-dependent carboxylases present in the cenancestor. It is important to note here that the precise nature
of the cenancestor remains debated, in particular whether
it was a single organism or a community of more or less
related different organisms experiencing a high frequency
of HGT [61,62]. When we infer that a particular biotindependent carboxylase may have been ancestral, this is
applicable to both views.
Since eukaryotes obtained their biotin-dependent carboxylases from bacteria, we ignore them for the discussion concerning the cenancestor complement and we
focus specifically on the respective ancestors of Archaea
and Bacteria as intermediate steps between present-day
species and the cenancestor. The components of biotindependent carboxylases have been duplicated, recombined and fused many times across evolution and, thus,
many different evolutionary scenarios can be proposed.
As it would be too long to discuss all of them, we will
focus only on the one that we consider to be the most
parsimonious (for examples of other scenarios see additional file 3).
In this hypothesis (Figure 8), the cenancestor would
have had a relatively simple biotin-dependent carboxylase content similar to that of modern archaea: one promiscuous BC-bearing subunit would have interacted
with a PCT-PT-BCCP subunit to catalyze the PYC function and also with independent BCCP and CCT subunits to carry out the carboxylation of CoA-substrates.
Ancient archaea would have inherited, conserved and
adapted this content to their low biotinylating needs,
keeping one PYC and one ACC-PCC, either conserved
or lost across subsequent evolution of the different
archaeal phyla. In the bacterial lineage, the duplication
of the BC domain allowed the emergence of two different biotin-dependent carboxylases, a polypeptidic PYC
and one ancient CoA-substrate carboxylase made up of
three subunits. The polypeptidic PYC was vertically
inherited in bacteria whereas a duplication of the threesubunit CoA-substrate carboxylase took place before the
last common bacterial ancestor. One of the resulting
CoA-substrate carboxylases had its CCT subunit split in
two parts that became the two CCT subunits in the bacterial ACCs. In the other three-subunit enzyme there
was a fusion between the BC and BCCP domains to give
rise to an ancestral promiscuous XCC. Later duplications and subfunctionalizations lead to the emergence of
the very diverse XCC family that we know in contemporary bacteria.

Page 18 of 22

A strong point of this scenario is its relative simplicity,
relying on the general assumption of aggregative peptide
domain architecture as a major force in protein evolution [63]. Noteworthy, this hypothesis assumes the independent emergence of the PT (ancient PYC) domain
and the BT (bacterial XCC) domain. Thus, a convergent
evolution has to be invoked to explain BT and PT structural resemblances. Despite that little is known concerning the characteristics and conservation of the BT/PT
domains, their shared structure consisting of a conserved helix and several b-strands seems simple enough
to hypothesize that it could have emerged twice independently and their conserved position between the BC
and the BCCP domains could be the result of structural
constraints related to their common subunit-interaction
roles.
Although some other scenarios could be proposed
based on the results of our phylogenetic and protein
domain composition analyses, all of them support the
presence of a relatively complex biotin-dependent carboxylase complement in the cenancestor. It would have
been able to carboxylate the pyruvate and several CoAlinked substrates. Contemporary biotin-dependent carboxylases contribute to very diverse major biological
functions, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, anaplerosis,
gluconeogenesis, and autotrophic CO2 fixation. Therefore, identifying the precise activity of the ancient biotin-dependent carboxylases proposed to have been
present in the cenancestor is a very difficult question.
Phylogenetic analyses alone do not provide enough
information to clarify this issue. A promising approach
would be the bioinformatic inference of the sequences
of the ancestral enzymes to synthesize them in order to
characterize their activity in detail (what is often called
“enzyme resurrection” [64-66]). That would be particularly interesting to check for potential activities involved
in fatty acid biosynthesis or autotrophic CO 2 fixation
since the presence of these metabolic pathways in the
cenancestor remains a hotly debated question [67-70].

Methods
Sequence retrieval and alignment

For each domain of life for which sequence data was
available, we retrieved one representative of each of the
different biotin-dependent carboxylases and BPL/BirA
enzymes from the KEGG database (http://www.genome.
jp/kegg) to be used as seeds for further similarity
searches. Since some biotin-dependent carboxylases
were absent from this database, we completed with
archaeal ACC/PCC [29], bacterial GCC [9], one bacterial
UCA [44] and one proteobacterial ODC [60] sequence
obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Genbank). Similarity searches with BLASTp [71] were
done with the well-characterized protein domains

against their respective domain of life. In cases where a
particular enzyme was missing in KEGG for one domain
of life, we used sequences from the other domains as
queries. Similarity searches in archaea and bacteria were
done against a list of completely sequenced genomes

available in GenBank (298 bacteria and 55 archaea, additional file 4). In eukaryotes, all searches were done
against the complete non-redundant (nr) eukaryoteannotated GenBank database.
Sequences for each protein domain found by these
searches in the three domains of life were aligned with

Muscle 3.6 [72] or MAFFT v6.814c-b [73]. Alignments
were edited with the program ED of the MUST package
[74] and redundant and partial sequences were removed
at this step. Ambiguously aligned regions were removed
prior to phylogenetic analyses using the NET program
from the MUST package. Alignments are available in
Nexus format as additional files 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Preliminary secondary structure searches on MCC, GCC,
PYC, XCC and accE (see results) were carried out using
APSSP (Advanced Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Server, http://imtech.res.in/raghava/apssp/) and
GOR4 [75].
Phylogenetic analyses

Preliminary trees based on the complete sequence dataset
for each enzyme were constructed by the approximately
maximum likelihood approach with FastTree 2.1.3 [76]
in order to classify sequences in functional classes with
respect to well-characterized proteins (see additional file
1). Neighbor joining trees (NJ) [77] using the MUST
package [74] were also reconstructed to select representative sequences with which carrying out more detailed
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI)
phylogenetic analyses. ML tree reconstructions were
done with the program TREEFINDER [78] with the LG +
Γ model [79] and 4 rate categories, which was selected as
the best-fit model for all our datasets by the model selection tool implemented in TREEFINDER [78]. Node support was assessed by 1,000 bootstrap replicates with the
same model. BI trees were reconstructed using the program MrBayes v. 3.0b4 [80] with a mixed substitution
model and a Γ distribution of substitution rates with 4
categories. Searches were run with 4 chains of 1,000,000
generations for which the first 2,500 generations were
discarded as “burn in”, trees being sampled every 100
generations. Stabilization of the chain parameters was
verified using the program TRACER [81]. Approximately
unbiased tests [82] were carried out using the test tool
implemented in TREEFINDER [78].
