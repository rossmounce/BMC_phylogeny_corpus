Abstract
Background: A recent study by Barthélémy et al. described a set of ribosomal protein (RP) genes
extracted from a collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the chaetognath (arrow worm)
Spadella cephaloptera. Three main conclusions were drawn in this paper. First, the authors stated
that RP genes present paralogous copies, which have arisen through allopolyploidization. Second,
they reported two alternate nucleotide stretches conserved within the 5' untranslated regions
(UTR) of multiple ribosomal cDNAs and they suggested that these motifs are involved in the
differential transcriptional regulation of paralogous RP genes. Third, they claimed that the
phylogenetic position of chaetognaths could not be accurately inferred from a RP dataset because
of the persistence of two problems: a long branch attraction (LBA) artefact and a compositional
bias.
Results: We reconsider here the results described in Barthélémy et al. and question the evidence
on which they are based. We find that their evidence for paralogous copies relies on faulty PCR
experiments since they attempted to amplify DNA fragments absent from the genomic template.
Our PCR experiments proved that the conserved motifs in 5'UTRs that they targeted in their
amplifications are added post-transcriptionally by a trans-splicing mechanism. Then, we showed
that the lack of phylogenetic resolution observed by these authors is due to limited taxon sampling
and not to LBA or to compositional bias. A ribosomal protein dataset thus fully supports the
position of chaetognaths as sister group of all other protostomes. This reinterpretation
demonstrates that the statements of Barthélémy et al. should be taken with caution because they
rely on inaccurate evidence.
Conclusion: The genomic study of an unconventional model organism is a meaningful approach
to understand the evolution of animals. However, the previous study came to incorrect
conclusions on the basis of experiments that omitted validation procedures.

Background
Recently, Barthélémy et al. studied the ribosomal protein
(RP) set of Spadella cephaloptera in order to investigate the
phylogenetic and genomic features of chaetognaths [1].
Chaetognaths are small marine predators of significant

importance in the planktonic ecosystem [2]. However,
they are mainly known for their singular morphological
and developmental characters that have been extensively
debated by zoologists since the discovery of the phylum
[3-6]. Furthermore, the molecular phylogeny of these

organisms has also proved problematic, which makes
their placement one of the most difficult issues in animal
systematics [7,8]. Noticeably, two phylogenomic studies
recently argued for the inclusion of chaetognaths in protostomes but proposed different branchings for this phylum: as the sister group of all other protostomes or as the
sister group of just the lophotrochozoans [9,10]. The data
analyzed by Barthélémy et al. [1] came from a collection
of 10,000 ESTs that were sequenced by our team in order
to perform phylogenomic inference, as described previously [9]. From this data, Barthélémy et al. retrieved the
ESTs encoding the 78 ribosomal proteins, which are
major components of the ribosome translation machinery [11]. These genes are broadly conserved during evolution and they have rarely been duplicated among
eukaryotes [12]. Their analysis of this dataset of ribosomal
protein transcripts lead Barthélémy et al. to emphasized
three main findings [1].

phylogeny previously obtained. We point out that instead
of the two biases mentioned by Barthélémy et al. [1], the
problems encountered are incident to the limited set of
taxa sampled.

• First, they identified nucleotide variants of certain RP
genes in the surveyed ESTs. They stated that these variants
correspond to duplicated, paralogous copies on the basis
of PCR amplification of the alternative forms in single
individuals. Accordingly, the authors proposed an allopolyploid origin for the chaetognath phylum. Moreover,
they suggested that the two paralogous gene sets were differentially regulated depending on tissues and life-stages
of S. cephaloptera.

Barthélémy et al. tested whether these ribosomal protein
variants correspond to genes duplicated within the
genome of S. cephaloptera by attempting to amplify these
alternative variants from the genomic DNA of single individuals. For this purpose, they designed reverse primers in
the coding sequence of the targeted genes and forward
primers within the conserved 5'UTRs motifs that could be
split in TAC and TTT forms, based upon divergent nucleotides (Figure 1A, TAC colored in red, TTT in blue). This
experimental design relies on the hypothesis that these
motifs are present in the genomic copies of the RP genes,
in the same position as it lies in their transcripts. In their
study, amplifications were performed for three different
individuals and four genes (RP S8, S25, L15 and L27) that
each included at least two variants (for example, RP S8
had three variants). It was claimed that some products
were recovered, but no documentation was provided, neither sequences nor photos of the gel-electrophoresis
results [1]. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that
duplicated paralogous genes of ribosomal proteins are
present in the genome of S. cephaloptera.

• Then, they described conserved 28-nucleotide stretches
at the extremity of 5'UTRs of unrelated RP transcripts.
These motifs are overall similar but could be distinguished by some diagnostic residues, from which these
forms were called TAC and TTT. They assumed that these
motifs belong to the genomic copies of all these genes.
They claimed to have identified binding sites for transcription factors in these motifs and thus proposed that these
motifs are involved in the regulation of transcription.
• Finally, they performed phylogenetic inference from a
concatenated RP dataset of ~5000 amino acid positions
and 7 taxa, but were unable to accurately position chaetognaths among metazoans. The authors said that this
lack of resolution could be due both to long-branchattraction and to nucleotide compositional bias affecting
the divergent chaetognath sequences.
Here, we prove that mistakes were introduced in this previous study, making these three conclusions incorrect. We
first challenge the hypothesis that the conserved motifs
they observed in 5'UTRs are present within the genomic
copies of numerous unrelated RP genes. In contrast, we
actually show that these motifs were added post-transcriptionally by a trans-splicing mechanism. Then, we investigate the possible causes for the lack of resolution of the

Results and discussion
Experimental questioning of the gene duplication
hypothesis
The exploration of transcript diversity within the EST collection revealed the presence of distinct variants of numerous ribosomal proteins, which are primarily distinguished
by strong nucleotide divergences in both coding sequence
and non-coding portions of the transcripts. At the extremity of the 5'UTRs of all these unrelated transcripts, Barthélémy et al. also detected two 28-nucleotides long
motifs, which are overall similar but with the exception of
some diagnostic residues that prompt them to call these
motifs the TAC and TTT forms [1].

We argue here that the 5'UTR motifs in which Barthélémy
et al. have selected their forward primers, are not located
in the genomic regions of the targeted genes, but are only
added after transcription during a trans-splicing maturation of the pre-mRNAs. Indeed, we noticed that these conserved motifs are present at the 5' end of ~30% of the
transcripts in the library and that those transcripts code
for many kinds of proteins, not just RPs (Additional file
1). We also found that, with a length of 36-nucleotides,
these conserved motifs are slightly longer than the 28nucleotides previously described, as illustrated by the
example of RP S8 (Figure 1A). We consider that the occurrence of such conserved motifs in hundreds of distinct
genes is inconceivable and we propose instead that this

Structure of ribosomal protein S8 gene and evidence for trans-splicing
Structure of ribosomal protein S8 gene and evidence for trans-splicing. (A) Alignment of selected ESTs from three
distinct variants of RP S8 with the genomic sequences of the Variant 2 of RP S8 (arrow, "gene"). Transcripts from each variant
clearly show alternatively the TAC (red) and TTT (blue) motifs, which are absent from the corresponding genomic region. (B)
The characterization of several PCR products and their comparison with EST sequences allowed us to determine the positions
and lengths of the introns as well as those of the 5' UTR, the coding sequence (CDS) and the upstream region. The post-transcriptional addition of splice-leaders (SL) is schematized: the two alternative classes of SLs (TAC and TTT) have been retrieved
in the RP S8 transcripts present in the library. Alignment corresponding to this schematic representation is available as Additional file 6. (C) The splice-leader genes encoding the two forms of splice-leaders are located in the 5S cluster region. Each
splice-leader gene includes the splice-leader sequence and the outron, which is excised during the trans-splicing processing.
Alignment corresponding to this schematic representation is available as Additional file 7.

pattern reveals the occurrence of trans-splicing. The observation of similar stretches of conserved nucleotides at the
5' ends of transcripts from unrelated genes has been considered as firm evidence for trans-splicing in an abundant
literature dealing with organisms from all over the tree of

eukaryotes, such as euglenozoans, hydrozoans, nematodes, urochordates and rotifers [13-16]. The trans-splicing mechanism acts through spliceosomal addition at the
5' end of transcripts of a splice-leader (SL) sequence that
is encoded by a distinct locus, the splice-leader gene. This

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:251

splice-leader sequence is then found at the 5' end of a
large subset of transcripts, but is found to be absent from
the genes themselves that are related to these transcripts.
Adding the splice-leader is said to ensure a better stability
of trans-spliced transcripts, but trans-splicing is also associated with operonic transcription in some metazoans
(e.g. urochordates and nematodes, see ref. [17]).
The occurrence of trans-splicing in S. cephaloptera was verified by our experimental attempts to reproduce and complete the work of Barthélémy et al. [1]. We first targeted the
Variant 2 of the ribosomal protein S8 (RP S8) gene with
the same set of oligonucleotide primers used in their study
(Additional file 1 in [1]), but we were not able to amplify
any product using the conditions given in the above publication (see methods). Conversely, using an alternate forward primer located in the coding sequence of the Variant
2 of RP S8 gene, we recovered the genomic sequence of
Variant 2 of the RP S8 with the same DNA sample, which
excluded any PCR problem in our attempt to reproduce
the results of Barthélémy et al. (Figure 1B and Additional
file 2). Further sequencing of this product allowed us to
characterize the structure of RP S8 with the arrangement
of its introns and exons (Figure 1B). Second, the absence
of TAC and TTT motifs in the genomic sequence of the RP
S8 gene was definitely proven by cloning and sequencing
its upstream region using an original PCR genome walking strategy, that is, no such motifs were found here (Figure 1B). These two observations are consistent with the
post-transcriptional addition of the TAC and TTT motifs
by a trans-splicing mechanism. Finally, definitive evidence of trans-splicing was provided through the localization and characterization of the genes that encode spliceleaders corresponding to TAC and TTT motifs. We specifically surveyed the 5S cluster region using forward and
reverse 5S primers, because this is the region that usually
contains splice-leader genes in other species that perform
trans-splicing [16]. In this way, we identified two SL genes
organized in tandem within a unit of the 5S gene cluster
(Figure 1C). These tandem genes correspond to the two SL
motifs (TAC and TTT) and both include an outron, a
cotranscribed sequence that is excised during trans-splicing process [18].
In summary, three lines of evidence strongly support the
occurrence of trans-splicing in S. cephaloptera: first, the
conservation of nucleotide stretches, the splice-leaders, at
the 5'-end of unrelated transcripts; second, the lack of
these splice-leader motifs in the genomic copies of considered genes; and third, the discovery of SL-genes within 5S
clusters, where they usually lie in other species exhibiting
trans-splicing.
We have demonstrated that TAC and TTT motifs could not
be reliably used to demonstrate the presence of paralogs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

but the question remains of whether the variants of ribosomal proteins, such as the variants 1–3 of RP S8, correspond to paralogous genes or not (see [19]). Conceivably,
such paralogs could have arisen either through previous
whole-genome duplications or allopolyploidization
events in the lineage leading to S. cephaloptera. Alternatively, they may simply not be paralogs but instead may
result from cryptic-speciation. According to this latter
view, the multiple arrow worms collected for library construction would belong to several different cryptic species
within the sampled population. The nucleotide divergence observed between the variants of RP genes would
then correspond to the genetic differentiation between
these cryptic species. It has recently been discovered that
cases of cryptic speciation are more common than originally expected [20] and cryptic speciation could actually
be widespread among marine organisms, as illustrated by
the example of the well-known Ciona intestinalis tunicate
[21].
Ribosomal proteins fully resolve chaetognath and animal
phylogeny
Using a dataset of about 5000 amino acids and 7 taxa, Barthélémy et al. did not recover a clear positioning of the
chaetognath taxon in the phylogenetic tree, despite the
use of improved inference methods, in particular the siteheterogenous CAT model that generally lessens the problem of long-branch attraction [22]. Accordingly, they
attributed this lack of resolution to some putative problems, namely, a persistent long-branch-attraction (LBA)
artefact, a bias of amino-acid or nucleotide composition,
a divergence between the variants of RP genes and finally
the sampling of a too limited set of taxa. However, no
attempt was made to test which of these many problems
were the main culprits.

Hence, we carried out several analyses that revealed that
the main culprit was the scarce taxon sampling. First, we
illustrated the power of a ribosomal protein dataset for
resolving the phylogeny of bilaterians by employing the
site-heterogenous CAT model on a dataset containing
12,764 aminoacid positions and 20 taxa (Additional file
3). We recovered the major clades of the so-called 'new
animal phylogeny' with reliable support values [23,24]
(Deuterostomia, Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, Figure
2) and we positioned the chaetognaths as the sister group
of all other protostomes with significant posterior probabilities (PP 99%) and bootstrap support (BS 77%). However, the CAT-based analysis failed to recover the
monophyly of the deuterostomes and instead united the
hemichordates, echinoderms and xenoturbellids with the
protostomes, but with low support (PP 90%) (Figure 2).
This topology has been obtained by an independent study
that used similar conditions [25], but it is clearly contradicted by morphological analyses and molecular analyses

Ribosomal protein dataset fully resolves animal phylogeny and reveals chaetognaths to be the sister taxon of
all other protostomes. This tree was inferred using phylobayes with the CAT model from a dataset of 12,764 amino acid

using site-homogenous model such as WAG, that is those
analyses upheld deuterostome monophyly [26].
Systematic errors related to model violation, as well as
problems due to limited taxon sampling, are well-known
pitfalls in phylogenetic reconstructions, and numerous
approaches allow the detection and resolution of these
problems (e.g. see [27,28]). First, using a relative-rate test
we excluded that chaetognaths evolved at a significantly
higher rate than other taxa (p-value 0.087), which is, for
instance, the case for platyhelminthes which did evolve
faster (p-value 0.014). Hence, this testing supports our
phylogenetic findings by excluding the possibility that our
placement of chætognaths is an LBA artefact. Adding to
this support, the CAT model we used in tree reconstruction itself minimizes LBA [22].
Also, Barthélémy et al. suggested that a compositional bias
impacts the phylogenetic placement of chætognaths. In

dataset with such biases, taxa with high content in certain
nucleotides or amino-acids (e.g. with G-C rich genes) can
group together artefactually as they have independently
evolved these biases through homoplasy. Compositional
biases mainly affect the nucleotide datasets, but nucleotide composition could influence amino-acid content,
so amino-acid datasets can have this bias too [29]. Therefore, we performed a principal component analysis and a
test of amino acid composition to evaluate potential deviation in amino acid composition (Figure 3 and Additional
file 3). We found that the amino acid composition of
some taxa is strongly divergent (e.g., Priapulida, Homoscleromorpha) but that this is not the case for chaetognaths, whose content is utterly typical (p-value 0.906).
Finally, we estimated the impact on the overall topology
of the divergence between the variants of each ribosomal
protein, which corresponds either to paralogous copies or
to haplotypes from distinct cryptic species. For this purpose, we constructed alternate chaetognath taxa including

either the most- or the least-divergent sequence variant of
S. cephaloptera RP when these two forms are present (see
Additional file 4). Trees inferred from alignments including any of these taxa resulted in identical topologies and
similar support values (Additional file 5), which excludes
the possibility that our previous statements were biased
by the inclusion of one of the distinct gene variants [9].
In summary, we excluded three of the potential pitfalls
that could misplace chaetognaths in the RP-based phylogenetic tree: a remnant long-branch attraction effect, a
compositional bias of amino-acids, and an intra-taxon
molecular divergence. Unaddressed, these problems
could have raised doubts about our present finding as well
as those of previous studies [9,10]. Our analyses clearly
argue for the chaetognaths as the sister group of all other
protostomes, as is supported by both site-heterogenous

(CAT) and classical site-homogenous (WAG) models [9].
Interestingly, this phylogenetic position was independently recovered in two recent studies, mainly based on
ribosomal proteins that include enlarged taxonomic sampling with acoel flatworms [30] or bryozoans and syndermates [31].
Here, the position of chaetognaths was primarily resolved
by improving the taxon sampling, from 7 to 20 major
taxa. The problem of inadequate taxon sampling has been
at the the root of major controversies in the phylogenomic
field [24,31,32]. Studies based on a limited taxon sampling have proposed the revival of the coelomata hypothesis [33,34] or even proposed the impossibility of
resolving animal phylogeny as a whole [35], but careful
examination of these results later revealed that the authors
had been misled by incomplete taxon sampling [24,32].

Conclusion
We show here that the study by Barthélémy et al. [1] relies
on a set of evidence whose accuracy is dubious. Particularly, the major claim, for extensive gene duplication, was
made on the basis of experiments and analyses that did
not include sufficient validation procedures. For example,
no sequences or gel photographs were provided to support the results of PCR amplifications of genes. Hence, we
suggest that careful precautions be taken when dealing
with understudied model organisms for which only limited data and few preliminary studies are available. The
originality and the novelty of chaetognath genomics
deserve data and analyses of the highest grade. Further
investigation of the questions briefly evoked in the
present paper will be the subject of a new publication
designed to enlighten the genomic features of the astonishing organisms that are chætognaths [19].

Methods
PCR amplifications
Genomic DNA template was isolated using the Wizard SV
Kit (Promega) from Spadella cephaloptera adult specimens
collected in the Calanque of Sormiou near Marseille,
France. The melting temperatures were determined
(MacVector software) for each pair of primers as indicated
in Additional file 6. Melting temperature (Tm) was set at
50°C for targeting 5S cluster units (primers 5SFor and
Rev) and at 59°C for amplifications of RP S8 (primers
TAC, TTT, S82R and S8-2F2). Cycling conditions were as
follows: 94°C for 1 minute, Tm for 1 min and 72°C for 2
min. The PCR products were subsequently checked using
gel electrophoresis, cloned in pGEM-T easy (Promega)
and sequenced by Genome Express (Grenoble, France).
Genome Walking procedure
PCR-based genome walking was carried out as described
in [36] using a set of semi-degenerate forward primers
(named semi in Additional file 6) and specific nested
reverse primers matching the first exon of RP S8 (Additional file 2). Three rounds of amplifications were conducted with the four specific nested primers using the
touch-down strategy (Tm ranging from 60°C to 41°C).
Several independent products were cloned and sequenced
(Additional file 2).
Phylogenomic-class dataset assembly
The ribosomal protein dataset was constructed using the
composite database strategy, as described in [9]. Available
sequences from a wide range of animal taxa including
newly published sequences were extracted from the NCBI
EST database [37] using the BLAST program [38].
Sequences were compiled for 20 taxa, mostly as chimeras,
as detailed in Additional file 3. Data parsing, conceptual
translation of ESTs and assembly of the concatenated
alignments of amino acid positions were performed using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

computer scripts based on the Bioperl framework [39].
The alignment was manually refined using MacVector
(Accelrys) and ambiguously aligned regions were then
removed using GBlocks [40]. This processing yielded an
alignment with 12,764 amino acid positions and 20 taxa
that is available upon request yannick.leparco@univmed.fr.
Phylogenetic inference
The ribosomal protein dataset was analyzed using Phylobayes 2.3 implementing the CAT model, which
accounts for site-heterogenous amino acid substitution
processes [41]. Burn-in period was determined by plotting
parameters across all runs and stationary state was
checked by comparing the frequencies of bipartition
between several independent runs [22]. The maximumlikelihood tree was inferred using Treefinder [42] assuming a WAG+Γ4+F model and support was estimated
through 100 non-parametric bootstrap replicates.
Evaluation of potential biases
In order to evaluate the impact of variants of RP genes
detected in S. cephaloptera, two alternate datasets including either the most or the least divergent variant of ribosomal proteins from S. cephaloptera, were assembled.
Independent alignments were built that include the
sequences of the variants of RP genes from S. cephaloptera
and when available the sequences of another chaetognath
species, Flaccisagitta enflata (Additional file 4). For each of
these alignments, phylogenetic trees were inferred
(PhyML, WAG+I+Γ4 [43]) and patristic distances were
computed for each of the different chaetognath sequences
(Additional file 4). These values allowed us to select the
most and the least diverging ones.

Principal component analysis was carried out to evaluate
the extent of amino acid compositional heterogeneity
using the R statistical package and ade4 library. Chisquare tests of deviation from average amino acid content
in the dataset were also computed using Tree-puzzle [44].
The relative rate test assessing differences among the evolutionary rates of selected lineages, was performed using
RRTree [45].

Introduction
This debate cannot be understood out of its context. One
of us (JPC), in his description of the new genus Archeterokrohnia Casanova, 1986 [46], hypothesized possible relationships with molluscs and wrote (p. 193, English
translation): "the main difficulty [of this hypothesis] seems to
lie in the fact that chaetognaths have a deuterostomian type of
development while molluscs are protostomian" (chaetognaths
were then said to be deuterostomes). So, he pointed out
the interest of the chaetognath model [47] and submitted
a project of sequencing of their genome, in collaboration
with Dr P. Pontarotti (Marseilles, France), that was
accepted (2000) by the Génoscope-Centre National de
Séquençage, and two posters were rapidly produced
[48,49]. Then, two members of his lab joined Le Parco's
team; that explains why now two teams in Marseilles work
on chaetognaths which status of "protostome with deuterostome-like development" has been evidenced at the molecular level by Le Parco's team [9], confirming thus
unambiguously previous Casanova's hypothesis of the
protostomian nature of the phylum based on morphological and anatomical data. So, one cannot be astonished to
read two papers on the mitochondrial genome of Spadella
cephaloptera Busch, 1851 [50,51], and two others on ribosomal protein sequences issued from the same ESTs data
set [9,1]. Our findings of several interesting features such
as the presence of ribosomal protein (RP) paralogous
sequences and of specific sequences in 5' UTR regions [1],
that were not reported in the publication of Le Parco's
team [9], is the matter of this debate.

Our response is divided into two parts, the one concerning molecular phylogenetic analyses by Dr A. Chenuil is in
a separate report.
Scientific critics addressed to our paper
We shall consider here all the scientific critics other than
the phylogenetic ones addressed to our paper that Marletaz and Le Parco wholly contest in their manuscript
above. When they wrote "Indeed, we noticed that these conserved motifs are present at the 5' end of ~30% of the tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

scripts in the library and that those transcripts do not only
derive from RP genes", we simply reply that this feature was
not mentioned in their publication of 2006 [9]. Moreover,
they have distorted the thought of our article, for example,
when they say in the Background "They [us]claimed they
have identified binding sites for transcription factors in these
motifs and thus proposed that these motifs are involved in the
regulation of transcription", whereas we have only suggested
this, writing "two novel and highly conserved elements have
been identified (5'-TAATTGAGTAGTTT-3' and 5'-TATTAAGTACTAC-3') which could correspond to different transcription
factor binding sites on paralog RP genes". This is based on the
fact that we have used several prediction programs in
order to search if these regions could correspond to "consensus" sequences previously known. Two programs have
indicated that a part of these regions is similar to transcription factor binding sites. Moreover, in some genes,
DNA binding site(s) have been identified in the downstream region of the transcriptional start site [52,53].
Marlétaz and le Parco note also in their manuscript above:
"We find that their evidence for paralogous copies relies on
faulty PCR experiments since they attempted to amplify DNA
fragments absent from the genomic template. Our PCR experiments proved that the conserved motifs in 5'UTRs that they targeted in their amplifications are added post-transcriptionally by
a trans-splicing mechanism". A trans-splicing leader mechanism is a possible interesting hypothesis, but only supported by one example. Moreover, the authors have only
made PCRs on one form of RPS8 gene that already gives
one plenty to think about the rejection of our finding of
paralogy and duplication of the genome. This agrees with
the fact that they did not mention these events in their
publication of 2006 [9] dealing with the same data set.
If all the 5'UTR regions are added on ribosomal protein
mRNAs through a trans-splicing mechanism, how to
explain our PCR results? There are three non-exclusive
explanations if this hypothesis is true:
- Possible chimeric PCR products (5' part corresponding
to the DNA regions containing the trans-splicing
sequences and 3' part to a ribosomal protein gene ORF)
could be amplified; however, it is relatively improbable to
obtain sizes similar to those of corresponding processed
mRNAs.
The two following explanations are more probable.
- Marletaz and Le Parco in their manuscript above have
sampled a cryptic species or even a well different species
for their experiments (see below). Such an explanation for
their differences in PCR results cannot be totally ruled out
when one knows the great variability of musculature, the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:251

main chaetognath body component, in relation with habitat and behavior [54].
- Our PCR results would be the amplifications of RP processed pseudogenes. It is widely recognized that in animals
most if not all of the RP genes have a number of processed
pseudogenes located elsewhere in the genome [55]. For
example, in mammalian cells, a single gene encodes each
RP but this gene generates a large number (10–20 copies)
of silent, processed pseudogenes [56]. Moreover, generally, the number of pseudogenes is greater in multigenic
families. Amplifications of processed pseudogenes can
generate amplicons with the expected size versus the
homologous EST sequences. So, sequences of the amplicons would have not given interesting data since they
would have been similar to those of the mRNA sequences;
only careful analyses of important genomic data such as a
BAC collection could allow responding unambiguously to
this question and we had not these data. Moreover, in
their S. cephaloptera EST collection, Marletaz et al. [9] have
found that some sequences are similar to those of reverse
transcriptase genes or of parts of retrotransposons; similarly, LINE-like and Gypsy-like retrotransposons have been
found in Sagitta sp. [57] and in S. cephaloptera [58], showing evidence of the presence of functional reverse transcriptase proteins in chaetognath cells. Interestingly, SINE
elements are retrosequences; this group contains all the
sequences arisen by reverse transcription of ribosomal,
messenger and small stable RNAs [59,60]. These elements
are non-autonomous for transposition, and as they do not
contain reverse transcriptase gene, they rely on the activity
of reverse transcriptase proteins encoded by LINEs to retrotranspose [61]. This mechanism can explain the origin
of numerous pseudogenes. Lastly, as we have used reverse
primers specific of each type of paralogous genes, positive
PCRs in the three hypotheses exposed above evidence the
presence of these paralogs.
Remarks on Marlétaz and Le Parco's work
Biological material
Why have we made PCR experiments? Because inter-individual or even inter-specific variations if cryptic species are
involved (see below) could not be excluded since the EST
library has been constructed with several individuals originating from two distinct separated populations, in the
Brusc Lagoon and the open sea, off La Ciotat. This is rather
unusual in genomics. In view to question the existence of
paralogous genes arisen through genome duplication,
Marlétaz and le Parco in their manuscript above wrote:
"However, alternative hypotheses such as the cryptic-speciation
hypothesis cannot be ruled out. This latter hypothesis states that
the multiple arrow worms collected for library construction
would belong to several cryptic species spread within the sampled population. The nucleotide divergence observed between
the variants of RP genes would then correspond to the genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

differentiation between these cryptic species. It has recently
been discovered that cases of cryptic speciation are more abundant than originally expected [19]and cryptic speciation could
actually be widespread among marine organisms". It would
have been more appropriate to cite previous works dealing with this problem by one of us (JPC) [62,63]. Indeed,
in the coastal area of Marseilles, a few Spadella specimens
have been described which yet remain to be assigned to
two distinct species, notably in the numerous submarine
caves out of which they can sometimes be found among
S. cephaloptera. It can be recalled here that some others
resembling Spadella ledoyeri Casanova, 1986 were later
raised to the specific rank [64]. Thus, it would have been
more judicious to make the EST collection using a single
individual of the species Sagitta lyra Krohn, 1853 (size >
40 mm versus 3–4 mm for S. cephaloptera) commonly
found off Marseilles, in order to avoid this type of problem!
Moreover, Marlétaz and Le Parco used specimens
(number unknown) from a third origin (Calanque of Sormiou) for their present PCR experiments, an area known
for its numerous submarine caves. Until then, one of us
(JPC) was asked to help their identification, e.g., in 2006
he was yet acknowledged by Le Parco [7] "for providing
some specimens and for helping [them]in species identification
and scientific comments". Thus, we are not sure of the real
nature of their specimens: Spadella cephaloptera? Specimens of a cave Spadella or even of S. birostrata Casanova,
1987, living at depths = -146 m off the French Mediterranean coasts [65], but which might be able to reach neritic
waters during the cold season when the temperatures of
the water column are homogenized, as commonly
observed for numerous deep organisms? Moreover,
highly divergent mitochondrial lineages have been found
in sympatric Mediterranean populations of the planktonic
chaetognath Sagitta setosa Müller, 1847, suggesting to Peijnenburg et al. [66] the existence of unidentified sympatric sibling species. That is why we have always sampled
specimens in the Brusc Lagoon, either for our previous
18S and 28S rRNA experiments [67-69] or RP genes PCR
[1]. Indeed, this population of S. cephaloptera is regularly
studied by us since 1996 [70] and seems to be relatively
isolated from populations of the open sea. The necessity
to work on this isolated lagoon population has been an
evidence for us since Riggio and Chemello's synthesis [71]
on the role of coastal lagoons in genetic isolation and evolution of numerous of benthic taxa, based on the observation in a Sicilian lagoon of a higher ratio of endermism as
compared to the whole Mediterranean Basin.
General remark on Marlétaz and Le Parco's phylogeny
Marlétaz and Le Parco in their manuscript above state:
"ribosomal proteins fully resolve chaetognath and animal phylogeny". They must be careful with such an assertion and

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:251

remember the different positionings they found according
to the criteria they used when they wrote, for example, in
2004 [50]:"It should be noticed that the inclusion of Chaetognatha within protostomes, based on mitochondrial data, is conflicting with [their]previous conclusions, based on Hox genes"
[72]).
Submission in databases
These authors should submit their EST collection as it is
the use. On April 2006, ESTs sequences were under the
accession numbers (AC) CR940385 to CR954140 on the
EMBL database. On November 2007, 1001 of these
sequences were again submitted under other numbers.
For example, now, there are two ACs for the EST sequence
corresponding to the cDNA clone 28YH18 (RPS8):
CR952852 and CU563934. Moreover, in Table S4, the
authors give a list of ribosomal proteins available in the
chaetognaths Flaccisagitta enflata Grassi, 1881 and S.
cephaloptera, but the amino acid sequences are not provided. This is rather embarrassing for readers and rather
curious. Moreover, curiously again, although the authors
wrote "This processing yielded an alignment with 12,764
amino acid positions and 20 taxa that is available upon request
yannick.leparco@univmed.fr)", they have refused to send it
to us in spite of our request.
Comment on Figure 1 in the manuscript above
Marlétaz and Le Parco do not give the nuclear 3' terminal
region of the RPS8 type II gene which could reveal interesting features; for example, some of our unpublished
studies have shown that intergenic regions are sometimes
very short, evoking a very probable operon structure. In
eucaryotes, operons appear to be relatively less frequent
than in procaryotes; however, some examples are well
known [73,74]. We suggest to the authors to look for
them in their data; it would be a pity to miss them (if any).
Careful with the understudied phylum Chaetognatha
We totally agree with one of the authors' final remarks
that "careful precautions should be taken when dealing with
understudied model organisms for which only limited data and
few preliminary studies are available". Perhaps, this advice
cannot be addressed to our team, since one of us (JPC) has
a background knowledge of the phylum: about 60 publications on the systematics and general biology of the phylum, description of about a quarter of the extant species,
and reports of many original observations such as the progressive stages of acquisition of one pair of appendages on
the posterior half of the tail by modifying a part of their
balancing fins, or their highly diversified musculature
[54,75]. Because of this knowledge, we were astonished to
read that the mitochondrial genome of Spadella cephaloptera [50] lacked the tRNAMet gene found in Paraspadella
gotoi Casanova, 1990 [76]. As these two genera are very
related (they were only separated in 1986), we logically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

thought this gene was perhaps missed by Le Parco's team.
This was right and we compared these two genomes [51]
to go farther studying this model phylum. Our working
methods are different, sometimes conflicting, but considered together they lead to a better knowledge of this interesting phylum. This is also true for the ribosomal protein
analyses.
Conclusion
Marlétaz and Le Parco have proposed an interesting alternative hypothesis concerning the 5'UTR region we discovered, but this needs supplementary data since supported
by a sole example. For the same reason, the BAC
sequences they have (started in 2001 in P. Pontarotti's
lab) must be submitted to sequence database in order to
verify the existence of numerous other examples of genes
whose mRNA would be trans-spliced. A last question
arises: why Marlétaz and Le Parco's critics are not exposed
in their submitted manuscript? The proofs of the unreality
of both paralogy of the ribosomal protein genes and polyploidy in chaetognaths they strongly suggest in this debate
would then have been more convincing and, consequently indisputable. This remark is indirectly supported
by the authors themselves when they conclude "Further
investigation of the questions briefly evoked in the present paper
will be the subject of a new publication ... (Marlétaz et al. submitted)". Since this "present paper" is only a brief copy of
the announced "new publication", it is therefore useless.
Addendum
This debate began on November 2007 after the publication of our paper on August 27, 2007 [1]. It was useless.
Indeed, the paper announced as 'submitted' by Marletaz
and Le Parco (above) has been online since June 2, 2008
[77]. It confirms the existence of paralogy and polyploidy
in Spadella cephaloptera that they missed in their previous
paper [9] and which we discovered one year ago [1] studying the same EST collection. But our paper is not mentioned in their paper published in Genome Biology earlier
this year [77]. Is this with a view to letting readers believe
it is their discovery? Moreover, we suspected the existence
of an operon structure when looking at their Fig. 1 in the
manuscript above. They confirm this fact [77], but without an undisputable demonstration as we suggested (see
above). No more comments are needed about such
behaviour!

Marseille. France.
Aspects related to molecular phylogenetic analyses and
the long branch artefact
I first explain my implication in the debated publication:
I was contacted by EF, one of the three authors (EF, RB and
JPC) of a previous submitted version of the manuscript
which I ignored, after one referee asked for more elaborate
phylogenetic analyses, using nucleotide data and ML
methods; I then asked Samuel Blanquart for his help for
the Bayesian analyses he had recently developped and the
CAT model.

The phylogenetic analyses in Barthelemy et al. (2007) [1]
were neither a primary nor a major goal of the paper but
we thoroughly explored elaborate methods attempting to
avoid certain biases in reconstructing phylogenetic trees.
We referred to the previous work of Marletaz et al. (2006)
[9] several times and always in a positive way. Based on
our results, we finally concluded that the lack of phylogenetic resolution in our data set was very likely to be due to
limited taxon sampling associated with the long branch
attraction artifact (LBA) and made the following prediction: "... improvements to infer phylogenetic relationships of
the chaetognath phylum will rely on using the PhyloBayes program with the CAT model on a wider taxonomic dataset than
the one we used in the present study, such as that of Marletaz
et al. 2006". Marletaz and Le Parco (2008) in their manuscript above used the method we recommended and
obtained a topology where chaetognaths branch at the
base of protostomes with a high support though the support we obtained was low.
However, these authors wrongly summarize our phylogenetic analyses [1] and suggest that we ignored the problem
of taxon sampling. They deplore that we considered the
compositional bias as a potential artifact without assessing its importance, although we actually used dedicated
probabilistic methods, and we concluded that "...the LBA
artifact seems to affect our phylogenetic reconstruction more
than the base composition bias since the methods which are supposed to "correct" for GC-content variation among lineages do
not change the topology obtained with more standard methods,
while the method supposed to correct for LBA does change it."
[1]. Etc.
More importantly, I contest some aspects of their analyses
in their manuscript above, in particular the distinctions
made among factors causing lack of robustness, and their
interpretation of a classical test.
a/Marletaz and Le Parco oppose the bias due to limited
taxon sampling to other biases such as LBA, writing: "we
showed that the lack of phylogenetic resolution observed by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

these authors is due to limited taxon sampling and not to LBA
or to compositional bias" (see the manuscript above). This
reasoning seems awkward, since, when long sequences are
available as in the present case, limited taxon sampling is
not a problem per se but only when there is systematic
error due to non phylogenetic signal (such as LBA or base
composition heterogeneity, or when the model of evolution does not correspond to the reality as e.g. when
changes of model parameters occur within internal
branches) impeding convergence to the true tree, even if
an infinite number of characters is available. Furthermore,
they used not only more taxa, but also many more aminoacid positions (12764) than we did (4638) [1], which
makes their "demonstration" that taxon sampling is "the
single problem" methodologically unconvincing. The
increased support they obtained may result from
increased sequence length as well as from improved taxon
sampling ... associated with non phylogenetic signal.
b/They wrote that we did not assess the presence of biases
properly, and that they proved that these biases do not
apply. I contest these two points and will now explain
why for the case of the LBA. They carried out a relative rate
test (using the RRTree program) to compare the chaetognath sequence to the other ones (considered globally) and
obtained a P-value of 0.087, stating that it excludes "...the
possibility that the current branching of chaetognaths is an LBA
artefact." First, the point is not to show whether or not
chaetognaths evolve significantly more rapidly than the
average of the other species, but to assess whether rate variation among lineages may generate spurious phylogenetic relationships. For the latter purpose, the
chaetognath sequence should be compared with the other
taxa individually, as we did [1], not to a group of species
that includes taxa well known for their very high evolutionary rates (this is the case of, at least, the platyhelminth, as Marletaz and Le Parco themselves
emphasized in their manuscript above). Second, the
absence of proof (non significance) is not the proof of an
absence. In addition, if, for the relative rate test, they had
compared the chaetognath to a group of species after
removing the very fastly evolving platyhelminth, it is
likely that the P-value would have been much smaller
than 0.087 (which is nevertheless nearly significant) as I
show below. Although these authors seem to have overlooked this, we had performed Tajima's relative rate tests
and reported that chaetognaths were much more rapidly
evolving than molluscs "suggesting that the union of the fastevolving Drosophila and the fast-evolving chaetognaths may
be an LBA artifact" [1]. Once established that chaetognaths
are not deuterostomes, and considering the sponge as the
outgroup, in our 6 taxa data set, the question reduced to
determining the rooted topology of three taxa: the chaetognath, the mollusc and drosophila. Deuterostomes were
represented by one vertebrate and one echinoderm.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/251

I now present the results of these relative rate tests with
more details than in our initial study. Using the Mega software, we found a very significantly (P < 0.001) higher rate
of evolution in the chaetognath relative to each sequence
of our data set, except Drosophila, whatever the outgroup
(sponge or yeast) and the type of substitution considered,
either with the amino-acid or with the nucleotide data set.
Compared to Drosophila, the higher number of substitutions in the chaetognath was either less significant (Pvalue between 0.03 and 0.048) or, in one case (nucleotide
data, yeast outgroup), non significant. These results
strongly support that spurious phylogenetic relationships
tending to place chaetognaths at a basal position (and
eventually to relate chaetognaths with arthropods) may
occur artefactually from this dataset.
