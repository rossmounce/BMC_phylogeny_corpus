Abstract
Background: Plant resistance (R) gene products recognize pathogen effector molecules. Many R
genes code for proteins containing nucleotide binding site (NBS) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
(LRR) domains. NBS-LRR proteins can be divided into two groups, TIR-NBS-LRR and non-TIRNBS-LRR, based on the structure of the N-terminal domain. Although both classes are clearly
present in gymnosperms and eudicots, only non-TIR sequences have been found consistently in
monocots. Since most studies in monocots have been limited to agriculturally important grasses, it
is difficult to draw conclusions. The purpose of our study was to look for evidence of these
sequences in additional monocot orders.
Findings: Using degenerate PCR, we amplified NBS sequences from four monocot species (C.
blanda, D. marginata, S. trifasciata, and Spathiphyllum sp.), a gymnosperm (C. revoluta) and a eudicot
(C. canephora). We successfully amplified TIR-NBS-LRR sequences from dicot and gymnosperm
DNA, but not from monocot DNA. Using databases, we obtained NBS sequences from additional
monocots, magnoliids and basal angiosperms. TIR-type sequences were not present in monocot or
magnoliid sequences, but were present in the basal angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis supported a
single TIR clade and multiple non-TIR clades.
Conclusion: We were unable to find monocot TIR-NBS-LRR sequences by PCR amplification or
database searches. In contrast to previous studies, our results represent five monocot orders
(Poales, Zingiberales, Arecales, Asparagales, and Alismatales). Our results establish the presence of
TIR-NBS-LRR sequences in basal angiosperms and suggest that although these sequences were
present in early land plants, they have been reduced significantly in monocots and magnoliids.

Background
Plants recognize pathogens using both non-specific and
specific mechanisms. Pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) mediate non-specific recognition by interacting
with microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns

(MAMPs or PAMPs), while the products of plant resistance (R) genes recognize specific pathogen molecules
[1,2]. Disease resistance is the only known function for R
genes, which appear to have a gene-for-gene relationship
with pathogen avirulence (avr) genes [3].

Many R genes code for proteins containing nucleotide
binding site (NBS) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
(LRR) domains. The NBS domain of plant R genes (also
called the NB-ARC domain) shares homology with
human APAF-1 and C. elegans CED-4, proteins involved in
regulating cell death [4]. NBS-LRR proteins can be divided
into two groups, TIR-NBS-LRR and non-TIR-NBS-LRR,
based on the structure of the N-terminal domain (Figure
1) [5,6].
The NBS domain from R genes is relatively conserved and
contains type-specific motifs (Table 1). The final residue
of the kinase-2 motif is especially useful for classifying a
sequence as TIR or non-TIR [7]. TIR-type NBS sequences
are relatively homogeneous and form a single clade, while
non-TIR sequences form multiple clades that likely originated before the split between angiosperms and gymnosperms [8,9].
The TIR class is found in bryophytes [10], and both TIR
and non-TIR sequences are found in gymnosperms
[11,12]. While both classes are present in eudicots, studies
in monocots have reported only non-TIR sequences [79,13]. It is thought that TIR-NBS-LRRs either never developed in monocots [10] or have been lost [7-9,13]. However, four resistance gene analogs (RGAs) from the
Triticum-Thinopyrum alien addition line TAi-27 have a
kinase-2 motif consistent with TIR-NBS-LRR sequences
[14].

Figure 1
Two types of plant NBS-LRR proteins
Two types of plant NBS-LRR proteins. The two classes
of NBS-LRR protein are differentiated by the N-terminal
domain. TIR-NBS-LRR proteins have a Toll-interleukin-like
receptor (TIR) domain, based on homology to the Drosophila
Toll and mammalian Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors. The Nterminal region of non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins is less defined,
but often contains a coiled-coil (CC) domain. In R genes, the
NBS domain plays a role in intramolecular interactions with
the LRR and N-terminal domains [28]. The N-terminal
domain influences the signaling pathway that will be activated
upon effector recognition [29], and may also be involved in
pathogen recognition and interactions with targets of pathogen effectors [30].

Studies of NBS-LRR sequences in monocots have been
limited to agriculturally important species in the grass
family (Poaceae). Recent studies from Zingiber and Musa
species (order Zingiberales) reported only non-TIR type
sequences [15-18]. Since there are ten orders of monocots
[19], we are limited in our ability to make generalizations
based on information from only two orders. To further
investigate the presence of TIR-NBS-LRR sequences in
monocots, we combined PCR and bioinformatics to
obtain data from additional monocots as well as magnoliids and basal angiosperms (Figure 2).

Results
We amplified sequences from four monocot species representing three monocot orders (Figure 2): Draceana marginata
and
Sansevieria
trifasciata
(Asparagales),
Spathiphyllum sp. (Alismatales), and Carex blanda
(Poales). For comparison, we included a gymnosperm
(Cycas revoluta) and a dicot (Coffea canephora). We
obtained sequences from a total of 60 PCR products that
resulted in 24 unique NBS sequences (Table 2). We found
non-TIR type sequences in all plants tested except the
cycad, but only two unique TIR-type NBS sequences, one
each from C. revoluta and C. canephora.
Using Pfam [20] and GenBank [21], we retrieved 17
monocot sequences (ten from Musa acuminata, four from
Elaeis guineensis, and three from Zingiber species), all of
which we classified as non-TIR-NBS-LRR sequences based
on the kinase-2 motif. Although we did not find any new
TIR-type sequences from monocots, the search confirmed
the similarity of the Triticum-Thinopyrum sequences [14].
In addition to monocot sequences, we retrieved two
sequences from Persea americana (magnoliid) and seven
sequences from basal angiosperms (five from Nuphar
advena and two from Amborella trichopoda). Based on the
kinase-2 motif, both P. americana sequences were non-TIR
and all five N. advena sequences were TIR-type sequences.
The A. trichopoda sequences have a glutamic acid in the
diagnostic position, but downstream motifs similar to
TIR-type NBS sequences (data not shown). For comparison, we also retrieved 37 Pinus (gymnosperm) and six
Physcomitrella patens (bryophyte) sequences.
We eliminated redundant sequences within a species
(>70% identity), resulting in an analysis of 53 plant
sequences (Table 3 and Additional Files 1, 2 &3) and
human APAF-1 as an outgroup sequence. As much of the
NBS domain as was available for each sequence was used
for phylogenetic analysis using parsimony criteria (Figure
3). Based on the scaffold tree (see Methods), we compared
our clades with those previously reported [8]. All fifteen
sequences that we identified as TIR-type NBS sequences
based on consensus motifs formed a single clade that was

well-supported by bootstrap analysis (85%). The nonTIR-type NBS sequences formed several clades, but many
were not well-supported. The well-supported non-TIR
clades correspond to non-TIR clades 3 and 4 in Cannon's
analysis [8], while non-TIR clades 1 and 2 are more
ambiguous.

Discussion
Previous studies of plant NBS-LRR sequences have suggested that only non-TIR-NBS-LRR sequences are present
in monocots [7-9,13], and the sequences from the Triticum-Thinopyrum addition line [14] have not been mentioned in later studies [17,18,22,23]. A study in Agrostis
species [22] reported two TIR-NBS-LRR sequences (Genbank: EE284250, EE284257). However, when these
cDNA sequences are translated, they do not contain an
open reading frame consistent with a NBS domain (data
not shown), so it is unclear that these represent monocot
TIR-NBS-LRR genes.

orders and one family that form the monocots [19]. The
broad relationships between the monocots and other land
plants are shown. Groups marked with an asterisk (*) show
where TIR-type NBS sequences have been confirmed. The
status of TIR-type NBS sequences in Poales is unclear (*?)
since these sequences are generally considered absent from
Poales, but have been found in one study [14]. Monocot
orders in green correspond to NBS sequences obtained in
this study by degenerate PCR while those in blue show
where sequences in this study were obtained from databases.

or -

Our PCR strategy amplified TIR-NBS-LRR sequences from
dicot and gymnosperm DNA, but not from monocot DNA
In spite of attempts to bias amplification and cloning
toward TIR-type NBS sequences, we did not find TIR-NBSLRR sequences in any of the monocots we tested,
although we easily cloned and sequenced TIR-type
sequences from a gymnosperm, eudicot, and Arabidopsis
control reactions. Although we expected to find the TIR
class in dicots, a previous study in coffee did not report
any TIR-type sequences [24].

Our results support the hypothesis that TIR-type NBS
sequences are rare in monocots. We used diverse monocot
taxa, including a species closely related to grasses (C.
blanda) and a species from a basal monocot order
(Spathiphyllum sp.). As with any PCR study, we cannot
eliminate the possibility that TIR-NBS-LRR sequences in
monocots are too divergent for our primers to amplify.
Species-specific amplification has been reported [15] and
more comparative work is needed to confirm that there
are definitive consensus sequences for these motifs that
are well-conserved across diverse taxa.

For each species tested, the table shows the number of fragments successfully cloned and sequenced for each type of primer set, the number of
these fragments that produced TIR and non-TIR sequences, and the number of unique NBS sequences found. Based on previous work, we expected
PCR products of approximately 700-900 base pairs [8,9]. In general, we cloned fragments of approximately 600-1000 bp, but we also cloned some
fragments as small as 300 bp and as large as 1.5 kb to allow for the possibility that the NBS domain of TIR-type sequences in monocots differs
significantly from those observed previously. At least five fragments smaller than expected and five larger than expected were cloned and
sequenced, none of which contained identifiable NBS sequence. We cloned a total of 62 fragments and successfully obtained 105 sequences from 60
of those fragments. The BLASTP algorithm was used to compare the translations to the Genbank non-redundant database. A conserved domain
search identified 30 sequences from 19 fragments that showed homology to an NB-ARC domain. We excluded six sequences that did not contain
an open reading frame, were redundant, or were fragments identical to longer sequences, resulting in a total of 24 unique sequences.
* A. thaliana was used only to confirm that TIR-specific primers would amplify TIR-type NBS sequences. No non-TIR fragments were cloned from A.
thaliana. The table only shows A. thaliana sequences obtained that included an open-reading frame from 5' to 3' primer. Additional sequences
obtained that included introns were not included in the table.

Database searches and phylogenetic analysis show that
TIR-type NBS sequences are present in basal angiosperms,
but are rare in monocots and magnoliids
Using Pfam and GenBank, we obtained NBS sequences
from monocots, a magnoliid, basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, and a bryophyte. The pine and moss sequences
had been classified previously [10-12] and provided
diverse lineages for comparison to the predominantly
monocot and dicot sequences in our study. Based on the
kinase-2 motif, TIR-type sequences were absent from
monocots and magnoliids (with the exception of the
reported Triticum-Thinopyrum sequences), but were
present in basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, and bryophytes (Figure 2).

Our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) was consistent with
previous analyses that showed a single TIR clade and multiple non-TIR clades [8,9]. The full NBS domain was not

available for some sequences used in the analysis. We
expect that the phylogenetic relationships will be clarified
as more sequence becomes available. Our clear non-TIR
clades corresponded to N3 and N4 (Cannon), with N1
and N2 split into several poorly-supported clades. Cannon's N4 clade did not include monocots, while our analysis placed a Z. officinale sequence in this clade (Figure 3).
Cannon reported that N1.2 might be monocot specific,
but our corresponding clade was not well-supported.
Based on the current analysis, N3.2 may be monocot specific.
We expected to find both dicots and gymnosperms represented across TIR and non-TIR clades, but gymnosperm
sequences were only found in the TIR and N4 clades. Both
magnoliid sequences were non-TIR type sequences, and
all basal angiosperm sequences were in the TIR clade (Figure 3). As more basal angiosperm sequences become

available, we expect to also find non-TIR-type NBS
sequences. Our results suggest that TIR-type sequences are
rare in both magnoliids and monocots.
TIR-NBS-LRR vs. the TIR domain
The rarity of TIR-NBS-LRR sequences in monocots does
not necessarily reflect on the abundance of the TIR
domain itself. Two similar protein families that may act as
adapters (TIR-NBS and TIR-X) are found in monocots, but
in low numbers compared to dicots and gymnosperms
[25]. Many sequences in the databases are fragments, and
some predicted non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins may be members of these new families [25].

Classification of NBS-LRR proteins into TIR and non-TIR
(Figure 1) is based on consensus motifs within the NBS
domain (Table 1). Although these are assumed to be diagnostic [8], the presence or absence of a TIR domain has
not usually been confirmed. We cannot eliminate the possibility that these motifs are not diagnostic. Further
sequencing of the N-terminal regions of these genes is
needed to confirm that our categorization is correct.

Conclusion
We were unable to find monocot TIR-NBS-LRR sequences
by PCR amplification or database searches. In contrast to
previous studies, our results represent five monocot
orders (Poales, Zingiberales, Arecales, Asparagales, and
Alismatales) as well as basal angiosperms and magnoliids.
Establishing the presence of TIR-type NBS sequences in
basal angiosperms fills a gap in our knowledge of these
important genes. Our results suggest that although TIRtype NBS-LRR sequences were present in early land plants,
they have been reduced significantly in monocots. The
sequences from the Triticum-Thinopyrum line [14] remain
the only reported monocot TIR-NBS-LRR sequences. We
do not know when these sequences were lost, but the P.
americana sequences suggest that TIR-NBS-LRR sequences
are rare in magnoliids as well. It is not clear whether these
sequences were lost independently in both lineages or
prior to their divergence. Further sequencing from additional taxa and confirmation that the motifs in the NBS
region are diagnostic will be helpful in clarifying the evolutionary history of plant R genes.

Primer design
Primer design. The diagram shows the NBS domain motifs
used in primer design. The motifs shown in blue are relatively
conserved between TIR and non-TIR classes of NBS
sequence while the domains in yellow have consistent differences. The three types of primer sets are shown with arrows
to mark the location of the primers used. We used a total of
24 primer combinations that would specifically amplify TIRNBS and non-TIR-NBS sequences, as well as combinations
that would amplify all NBS sequences. All combinations were
designed to amplify the kinase-2 region containing either a
tryptophan (non-TIR) or aspartic acid (TIR) to aid in classification of the sequence.

Methods
Plants
We vegetatively propagated Carex blanda individuals collected from Kansas [26] and grew Arabidopsis thaliana from
seeds (Ruth Shaw, University of Minnesota) in the greenhouse. Draceana marginata, Sansevieria trifasciata,
Spathiphyllum sp., Cycas revoluta, and Coffea canephora
came from the University of Kansas greenhouse.
Genomic DNA isolation
We isolated genomic DNA from frozen plant material by
grinding with a mortar and pestle in extraction buffer (0.2
M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.25 M NaCl, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0,
0.5% SDS) and incubating at 65°C for 10 minutes. We
performed three extractions with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1); the final extraction used a phaselock tube (Eppendorf). We precipitated the DNA and
resuspended it in 100 μL10 mM Tris pH 8.0 with 10 μg
RNaseA.
Degenerate PCR
We amplified 200 ng of genomic DNA with degenerate
primers (Invitrogen). We used two 5' primers (P-loop/
Kinase-1a region) and twelve 3' primers (GLPL and RNBSD regions; Figure 4 and Table 4). The 50 μL reactions contained 2.5 units Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 5
μL 10× buffer, 1.5 μL 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μL 10 mM dNTP
mix, and 5 μL each degenerate primer (10 μM). The
cycling parameters included initial denaturation at 94°C
for 2 minutes, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for

Cloning and sequencing
We purified PCR products from agarose gels using the
QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAgen), ligated into the
pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into
maximum efficiency DH5α competent cells. We isolated
plasmid DNA from overnight cultures using a standard
alkaline lysis protocol, digested with EcoRI, and
sequenced representative clones with standard primers
(T3/T7) at the University of Kansas sequencing facility or
ACGT, Inc. We typically sequenced between one and three
clones from each fragment. Sequences were submitted to
GenBank with accession numbers EF687860-EF687864
and EF687876-EF687894.
Database searches
We retrieved monocot (excluding Poales), gymnosperm,
and bryophyte sequences from Pfam by viewing the NBARC domain (PF00931) species distribution. We retrieved
sequences from GenBank by searching with known plant
NBS sequences [see Additional File 2] and using the taxonomy reports to identify non-dicot, non-grass plant
sequences with significant similarity (e < 0.05). We used
EditSeq (Lasergene) for all sequence viewing and editing,
and excluded sequences with internal stops or that lacked
the diagnostic kinase-2 region.
Phylogenetic analysis
We aligned sequences using the ClustalW algorithm in
MegAlign (Lasergene) with manual adjustments as necessary. The alignment contained a core region of approximately 170 amino acids. We generated a scaffold tree
based on the Pfam seed alignment and previous analyses
[see Additional File 3] [8]. Phylogenetic analysis with parsimony criteria was performed using PAUP* 4.0 beta10
[27].

Accession numbers for sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis that
were retrieved from online databases. Accession numbers for sequences
used to generate the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 3 obtained from
databases (Pfam or GenBank). Pfam 22.0 identified over 4000 plant
sequences that contain the NB-ARC domain (PF00931). Of the 1215
monocot sequences, 1201 were from the grass family (Poaceae). The other
14 monocot sequences were from Elaeis guineensis (Arecales) and Musa
acuminata (Zingiberales). We used both TIR and non-TIR sequences as
queries in BLASTP and TBLASTN searches of the GenBank EST database. We increased the number of maximum targets to 1000 and performed independent searches with the organism set limited to plants,
monocots, magnoliids, and basal angiosperms. The TIR-type NBS query
sequences were Q42054_LINUS (Pfam), Q8LPB9_PHYPA (Pfam),
Q6WE87_PINMO (Pfam), EF687876 (Genbank), and EF687894
(Genbank). The non-TIR-type query sequences were all from Genbank
and included EF687875, EF687871, EF687860, EF687880,
EF687878, BAB08632, and AU084895. We obtained the representatives shown by eliminating redundant sequences within a species (>70%
identity).

Accession numbers for sequences used to generate the scaffold tree.
Accession numbers for the sequences in Figure 3 that were used to make
the scaffold tree. The Pfam seed alignment contains twelve amino acid
sequences that represent the NB-ARC (NBS) domain, including ten from
plants, one from C. elegans (CED-4), and one from humans (APAF-1).
We compared these twelve sequences to a previous phylogenetic study of
NBS sequences in plants that identified one TIR group and several nonTIR groups [8] to confirm that all identified subgroups were represented
by sequences in the Pfam seed alignment. While some of the accession
numbers for sequences used in the study corresponded to records that have
been removed, we retrieved 79 sequences and aligned them with the 12
sequences from Pfam. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony criteria generated a tree similar to that reported by Cannon (not shown). The ten seed
sequences from plants represented four of the groups previously identified
[8]: TIR, N1.1 N2, and N3. We added the four sequences from Cannon's
analysis that represented N1.2 and N4 to the ten plant sequences. We
eliminated the C. elegans sequence from the alignment because it contained a long insertion that was difficult to align. We also excluded
O24015 from Solanum lycopersicum because it clustered with O24016
with 100% bootstrap support in all analyses. We kept human APAF-1 as
an outgroup sequence.
