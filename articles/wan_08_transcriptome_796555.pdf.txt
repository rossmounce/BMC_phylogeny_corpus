Abstract
Background: Hexaploid wheat is one of the most important cereal crops for human nutrition.
Molecular understanding of the biology of the developing grain will assist the improvement of yield
and quality traits for different environments. High quality transcriptomics is a powerful method to
increase this understanding.
Results: The transcriptome of developing caryopses from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv.
Hereward) was determined using Affymetrix wheat GeneChip® oligonucleotide arrays which have
probes for 55,052 transcripts. Of these, 14,550 showed significant differential regulation in the
period between 6 and 42 days after anthesis (daa). Large changes in transcript abundance were
observed which were categorised into distinct phases of differentiation (6–10 daa), grain fill (12–21
daa) and desiccation/maturation (28–42 daa) and were associated with specific tissues and
processes. A similar experiment on developing caryopses grown with dry and/or hot
environmental treatments was also analysed, using the profiles established in the first experiment
to show that most environmental treatment effects on transcription were due to acceleration of
development, but that a few transcripts were specifically affected. Transcript abundance profiles in
both experiments for nine selected known and putative wheat transcription factors were
independently confirmed by real time RT-PCR. These expression profiles confirm or extend our
knowledge of the roles of the known transcription factors and suggest roles for the unknown ones.
Conclusion: This transcriptome data will provide a valuable resource for molecular studies on
wheat grain. It has been demonstrated how it can be used to distinguish general developmental
shifts from specific effects of treatments on gene expression and to diagnose the probable tissue
specificity and role of transcription factors.

Background
Cereals are of immense importance to humankind with
over 2000 million tonnes being harvested annually and
used for food, livestock feed and industrial raw materials.
These uses exploit the reserves of starch and protein,
which are deposited in the endosperm which accounts for
about 80% of the mature grain. Hence, grain yield and
end use quality are largely determined by thesize and
composition of the endosperm.
The endosperm is formed by a second fertilisation within
the embryo sac, with two central cell nuclei and one pollen nucleus fusing to give a triploid constitution. Subsequent cereal endosperm development can be divided into
a number of stages [1]. The first of these is free nuclear
division which occurs within the primary endosperm cell
to give a coenocyte which, in wheat, may contain over
2,000 nuclei by 72 hours after fertilisation [2]. Cellularisation then occurs over a period of about 24 hours, followed by a period of about 10 days during which cell
division, expansion and differentiation occur to give the
characteristic structure of the endosperm with a total of up
to 300,000 cells [1,2].
A major transition point occurs at about 14 days after fertilisation in wheat grown in temperate climates, marking
essentially the end of endosperm cell division [1] and the
start of grain filling (the deposition of starch and gluten
proteins) in these cells. After about 28 days the deposition
of storage reserves decreases and the grain starts to desiccate, reaching physiological maturity at about 42 days and
harvest ripeness 1–2 weeks after this. However, the duration of these phases differ greatly between climates with
the maximum dry weight being achieved by approximately 21 days in N. America [3].
Transcriptomics have been used to relate transcript abundance to these changes in developing wheat and barley
grain. Microarrays of wheat cDNA [4,5] and a macroarray
of barley cDNA elements [6] have been used to follow
selected parts of the transcriptome. Alternatively, opensystems based on counts of sequences have been applied by
Kawaura et al. [7] who classified the expression patterns of
two groups of storage protein genes from EST abundances
and McIntosh et al. [8]who used Serial Analysis of Gene
Expression (SAGE) on developing wheat grain. The two
approaches are complimentary; arrays allow greater resolution of expression differences and ease of comparison
from a fixed platform, whereas sequencing approaches
allow discovery of novel transcripts.
Although cDNA-based arrays provide valuable information they give only partial coverage of the genome, for
example, Laudencia-Chingcuanco et al. [4] used a cDNA
array of 7,835 elements but the total number of genes in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/121

hexaploid bread wheat probably exceeds 100,000. The
wheat Affymetrix GeneChip® array comprises over 61,000
sets of eleven 25 mers ('probesets') representing 55,000
wheat transcripts and may cover half of the wheat
expressed genes. This platform has been used to study the
transcriptomics of meiosis in wheat [9] and, in the first eQTL study in wheat, to identify loci controlling seed
development [10]. Affymetrix arrays have significant
advantages over cDNA arrays in terms of data quality and
ease of comparison between samples. In particular, it is
known that the homoeologous genes from the three
genomes of wheat can be expressed with different spatial
and temporal specificities [11]; while cDNA array elements would be expected to cross-hybridise with these
different transcripts, the multiple, short probes of the
Affymetrix platform could in principle distinguish them
[12]. We have therefore used this new resource in order to
identify transcripts associated with grain development
and filling in wheat.
Grain development is associated with massive changes in
gene expression andany comparisons between genotypes
or environments therefore needs to place the results in a
developmental context. The data reported here constitute
a reference data set to allow this as illustrated with an
experiment on effects of heat and drought treatments on
the wheat grain transcriptome. The dataset can also be
exploited for further studies of grain development; here
we have chosen to focus on transcription factors as key
regulators of transcription.

Results and discussion
The selected winter wheat cultivar, Hereward, was released
in the UK in 1991, but is still widely grown and has
remained a "gold standard" for breadmaking wheats.
Grain development of cv. Hereward
Approximately 33,000 of the 61,000 probesets on the
array showed significant binding to transcripts and, of
these, 14,550 showed significant differences in transcript
abundance between developmental stages. (Note: Transcriptomics is the measurement of transcript abundance,
but here we follow common practice using the terms 'gene
expression' and 'transcript abundance' interchangeably,
so that both include variation in transcript degradation).
The profiles of this latter set during grain development are
summarised with the changes in seed dry and fresh
weights in Figure 1. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the
whole dataset (Figure 2) shows that biological replicate
samples cluster together, with successive changes in the
patterns from 6 to 42 daa. Furthermore, three broad
phases are indicated, with the samples from 6, 8 and 10
days, 12, 14, 17 and 21 days, and 28, 35 and 42 days
forming separate clusters.

0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple-testing correction) differences in expression between stages
(14,550 probesets).

These phases can also be seen in the highly distinctive pattern of normalised transcript abundance (Figure 1B)
which shows massive changes in expression for many
genes in the switch from 10–12 days and again from 21 to
28 days. Similar changes can be seen in the smaller set
(2,237) of differentially regulated transcripts identified by
cDNA arrays [4] and in the profiles of the 250 most abundant SAGE tags [8].
It is useful to aggregate genes with similar expression profiles to find if probesets with particular properties are
over-represented in these clusters. The dataset comprised
hundreds of statistically significant different gene expression profiles, but for display purposes we chose to aggregate these into the 12 sets shown in Figure 3 using the SelfOrganising Map algorithm. This is appropriate for an
overview display as it places similar gene clusters next to

each other, so each dimension represents a progressive
change in the expression profile of the cluster.
In order to associate the gene clusters with biological processes, we assigned probesets to ten process categories chosen to be of most relevance to grain development (see key
of Figure 3; and Methods). Whereas most probesets could
be identified in terms of their molecular function (e.g.
transcription factor, protein kinase), only 38% of them
could reliably be associated with these processes. The
number of probesets in each category are summarised for
each cluster in the left hand pie charts shown in Figure 3.

nal (mainly pericarp) tissues. We therefore assigned putative tissue locations to 668 of the transcripts based on
published biochemical studies of the encoded proteins
and on the locations reported in the barley transcriptome
study of Sreenivasulu et al. [6], who analysed separate
pericarp, endosperm and embryo tissues. Additional
information on tissue locations came from the in situ
hybridisation database of Drea et al. [13]. The putative
locations of the transcripts in each set are summarised in
the right hand pie charts in Figure 3. The assignment of
probesets to process and tissue classifications are available
[see Additional file 1].
Based on their putative assignments of function and tissue
location it is possible to relate the changes in gene expression profiles to stages of grain development. An overall
pattern is immediately apparent with embryo transcripts
tending to increase throughout development (clusters
shown on top left of map in Fig. 3, i.e. 1_1, 2_1, 1_2),
endosperm transcripts tending to increase to a plateau
starting at 14 daa (top right) and some endosperm and
pericarp transcripts decreasing through development
(bottom right).
The cellularisation of the coenocytic endosperm is usually
complete between 6 and 8 days after anthesis and is followed by a period of active cell division, expansion and
differentiation to establish the starchy endosperm and
aleurone tissues. The embryo develops more slowly than
the endosperm duringthis period while the pericarp
remains metabolically active. This phase corresponds to
the 6, 8 and 10 day samples in our analysis and many of
the transcripts which are expressed most highly during
this earliest period (Figure 3 1_4, 2_4, 3_4) are associated
with the endosperm and pericarp and with cell division,
photosynthesis and development rather than storage
product (starch and protein) synthesis.
Grain filling is initiated at about 10 daa and continues
until about 28 days. This is associated with very high
abundance of specific transcripts (2_1, 3_1, 3_2) but these
are only represented by about 50 distinct probesets. As a
result, and because the data shown in Figure 3 are normalised to median gene expression for display purposes, the
dominance of these transcripts during grain fill is not
apparent. However, this is clear when our data are
expressed on an absolute basis (not shown) and confirms
results from other transcriptomics approaches (cDNA
arrays, SAGE tag and EST counts), which show storage
protein transcripts to be the most abundant in developing
seeds of wheat [4,8] and rice [14]. These transcripts tend
to reach a maximal level at around 14 daa which is maintained (relative to the total transcriptome) until 42 daa.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/121

Many transcripts associated with the pericarp and photosynthesis decline steadily from the start of the sampling
(1_4, 2_4, 3_4); however others maintain a more constant
level of expression throughout the developmental series
(1_3, 2_3).
In contrast, the majority of embryo transcripts continue to
rise until the end of the sampling period (42 days). Transcripts expressed highly during this latter period include
many related to defence and stress (1_1, 2_1), in agreement with SAGE results [8]. The stress transcripts may
relate to embryo desiccation; for example, dehydrins are
exclusively in group1_1. During this same period (28–42
days) there are decreases in transcripts associated with the
endosperm and pericarp (3_3, 3_4).
Several clusters show more subtle, albeit significant,
changes in expression throughout development associated with all three tissues (1_2, 1_3, 2_2) or with the
endosperm and pericarp (2_3). These four clusters
include many transcripts encoding proteins expected to be
present in almost every cell type, e.g. mitochondrial proteins, machinery for protein synthesis and degradation,
enzymes of primary metabolism.
All clusters contain a small proportion (1–2%) of
probesets that are in the antisense orientation when compared to coding rice sequences. These presumably function to down-regulate the sense transcript in vivo, many of
which seem to be involved in protein synthesis and degradation (ribosomal proteins, proteases, ubiquitin, proteasome). A similar fraction of transcripts was identified as
being antisense using SAGE technology on developing
wheat grain [8].
The clusters identified here can be compared with those
reported in other transcriptome analyses of developing
wheat [4,8] and barley [6] grain by identifying similar
sequences [see Additional file 2]. The separation into a
small number of gene clusters is to some extent arbitrary
and dependent on choice of algorithm; nevertheless some
trends are clear, e.g. cluster 3_1 is very similar to McIntosh
et al. cluster 2j (19 out of 20 matching sequences),
Sreenivasulu et al. cluster 5,3 and Laudencia-Chingcuanco
et al. cluster 6. Those clusters that have similarities in
sequence composition [see Additional file 2], also show
similar average expression profiles. This shows some conservation of effects across conditions and between wheat
and barley. However, it is noticeable that the size of
changes in apparent transcript abundance observed here
are often greater than in these other experiments. Possibly
the EST-based platforms tend to integrate across several
similar transcripts thus giving a damped signal compared
with the oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix platform [12].

transcripts are greatly exaggerated in the 28 daa heat
treated samples (Figure 4; Additional file 3 3_2). The pericarp-associated transcripts decreased steeply till 10 daa
then more gradually (Figure 4).

Effects of environmental factors on grain development
Environmental factors are known to have effects on wheat
grain development, with impacts on both yield and enduse quality [15,16]. The effects of heat, drought and heat
& drought on the grain transcriptome profile of cv. Hereward, were therefore studied, selecting a highest temperature of 28°C. This temperature is sufficient to affect yield
and quality [17] but substantially below temperatures
which are known to affect wheat storage protein gene
expression [18]. The plants were grownin controlled environment (CE) cabinets and subjected to different conditions from 14 daa.

These environmental effects on development are expected
since temperature is known to accelerate development
and measures such as thermal time have been used in
order to quantitise this effect. Drought can also accelerate
grain development due to stomatal closure, which reduces
transpirational cooling, and due to increases in the rate of
desiccation. It is possible to accurately quantify these
effects on the transcriptome from the array data by estimating the equivalent stage in the developmental series
for each of the CE experiment samples. This was done by
calculating a distance measure between the CE samples
and the interpolated developmental series [see Methods
and Additional file 4]. The value of daa which gives the
minimum distance is an estimate of the developmental
stage of the 12 samples (Table 1). These estimates are not
sensitive to changes in the sample of probesets used, as
shown by the results of a bootstrapping procedure.

The CE datasets show the same trends as observed in the
developmental series but are accelerated, especially in hot
and hot & dry conditions, as shown by the average expression of gene clusters [see Additional file 3] or by gene sets
where the likely tissue of expression is known (Figure 4).
(Note:the expression measure shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7,
whilst not normalised to median gene expression, is still
normalised to the total transcriptome at each time point;
if expression were to be calculated on a per caryopsis basis
the values would be much lower later in development as
the total amount of RNA decreases.) Thus the abundances
of embryo-associated transcripts increase throughout
while those of endosperm-associated transcripts increase
to a plateau. These changes occur faster in the heat treated
samples and the late decreases in endosperm associated

This analysis showed that the developmental stage of CE
samples at 14 daa (the start of the imposition of different
environmental conditions) is equivalent to about 20–23
daa in the developmental series; this is expected as the
temperature regime used was 23°C/15°C day/night com-

mental series (at 42 daa). The trends [see Additional file 4
Panel C] show that the treatments continued to accelerate
development, with the size of effect being dry < hot < hot
& dry.
Altenbach and Kothari [19] showed that the effect of temperature on expression of some selected genes in wheat
grain was consistent with the acceleration of physiological
markers of development. Our estimates of developmental
stage from the transcriptome agree well with those using
the moisturecontent of the grain, if the values for the CE
samples [17] are compared with those from the developmental series (not shown). This suggests that water status
acts as a major signal for control of wheat caryopsis development (also postulated by McIntosh et al. [8]).
Using this transcriptome analysis, it is also possible to
identify genes which are affected by the environmental

treatments independently of general developmental
effects. The expression values from the CE samples at 21
daa were corrected to the closest developmental stage
from Table 1. Probesets were selected which were more
than two-fold changed in this corrected expression for
both drought-treated or both heat-treated samples relative
to corresponding samples lacking these treatments (Table
2). Transcripts specifically up-regulated due to drought
seem to have a role in non-starch polysaccharide hydrolysis, whereas those down-regulated include a Lt1.1 transcript; homologues of Lt1.1 have been shown to be highly
responsive to environmentalconditions, being induced by
low temperature (e.g. [20]). The most highly up-regulated
transcript under heat is Rubisco activase whichhas been
shown to be inducible by heat and is consistent with its
role in maintaining Rubisco integrity at high temperature
[21]. Surprisingly, a transcript for a heat shock protein
appeared to be down-regulated in the heat-treated sam-

effects. The corrected effects, expressed as transcript abundance ratios, of drought (average of drought/control and heat & drought/

both the averaged comparisons.

ples. Altenbach and Kothari [19] also identified a few
transcripts as affected by temperature, independently of
developmental effects, but these effects were not seen
here, probably because of the more moderate high temperature treatment (28/20 compared to 37/28°C). Overall, acceleration of development explained the great
majority of the changesobserved at 21 daa; 93% being
within a factor of 1.5 of the predicted value.
Expression of transcription factors
The wheat Affymetrix GeneChip® contains about 2,000
probesets for potential transcription factors (TFs). Relatively few TFs have been characterised in cereals and even
fewer of their target genes and/or biological roles determined. Available evidence, however, suggests that TFs and
their targets display a many-to-many relationship: thus,
multiple TFs bind to a promoter while individual TFs control multiple genes. Transcription is either controlled
through the requirement for a set of factors to be present
in sufficiently high numbers in the right cells at the right
time, or via TF modification to alter their binding to DNA
or each other. The first model predicts the differential
expression of factors together with the genes they control;
the second does not. The expression of around a half of
the total TFs interrogated was constant during grain development while the remainder were distributed between the
expression profiles groups outlined. We selected nine TFs
for detailed analysis, using qRT-PCR to confirm the
changes in expression levels determined using the GeneChip® arrays (Figure 5),

The relative expression levels determined by qRT-PCR
showed excellent agreement with those determined using
arrays, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.89 to
0.97 in five out of the nine cases, while the other four varied between 0.79 and 0.53. This degree of agreement is
very close to that observed for other genes by [9].
The expression profiles of the TFs selected showed three
distinct patterns, associated with gene expression predicted to be in the endosperm, embryo or pericarp (Figure
4).
Endosperm-like expression
Four of the TFs (Figure 5A, B, C, D) displayed an
endosperm expression pattern typical of 2_1, 3_1, 3_2
(Fig. 3). The heat and heat & drought treatments precipitated the decline of the transcripts presumably in line with
accelerated maturation of the endosperm.
TaSPA and TaPBF
Many prolamin storage protein genes (including those
encoding α-gliadins and low molecular weight (LMW)
subunits) contain the cis-element known asthe
endosperm box in their promoters. This bipartite element

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/121

is composed ofthe GCN4 box to which the bZIP TFs
TaSPA (wheat), and BlZ2 (barley) bind and the prolamin
box to which the DOF TFs WPBF(TaPBF) and BPBF bind
[22-25]. Previous Northern analysis suggested that TaSPA
and TaPBF were endosperm-specific with transcript levels
peaking around 15–18 daa. Our data(Figure 5A &5B) is in
good agreement with this as their expression parallels the
rise in transcripts for LMW subunit and α-gliadins genes
(Figure 6A) which is consistent with a role in prolamin
gene expression. Additional targets are likely to fall into
the same grain filling expression profile, such as the
trypsin inhibitor BTi-CMe genes (Figure 6C), known targets of BPBF and BIZ2 [26]. However, not all prolamin
genes have an endosperm box [27]. The high molecular
weight (HMW) subunit genes, for example, presumably
rely on other TFs potentially with similar profiles to TaSPA
and TaPBF: 54 other putative TFs from 13 families are represented in the predominantly endosperm 3_1 cluster.
TaGAmyb
The R2R3 class barley HvGAmyb TF, initially isolated
based on its ability to bind to GA responsive α-amylase
promoters expressed in the aleurone during germination
also binds to the AACA elements of the B hordein (Hor 2)
and BTI-CMe (iTrr-1) promoters, and interacts with BPBF
[28]. Their Northern data showed moderate levels of
HvGamyb in the endosperm from 10 to 22 daa, while in
situs at 20 daa indicated expression tobe mainly in the
aleurone layer and embryo. TaGAmyb has a pattern of
expression (Figure 5C), typical of group 2_1, which would
be consistent with roles in endosperm grain filling and in
the embryo. α-Amylase genes are not normally expressed
in late grain development but in some genotypes and
under specific environmental conditions pre-harvest
sprouting or premature amylase production can occur
[29]. High levels of TaGAmyb late in grain development
may contribute to this phenomenon.
TaNAC family
The TF encoded by Ta.37139.1 has homology to the NAC
class of TFs [see Additional file 5]. This large plant-specific
TF family (123 in rice PlnTFDB; [30]) contain a NAM
DNA domain that binds to the core sequence CACG. Their
members regulate developmental processes, as well as
defence and abiotic stress responses [31]. Although still
consistent with endosperm expression, transcripts corresponding to Ta.37139.1.S1 peaked later in grain development compared to the expression of TaPBF2 and TaSPA.

Several other NAC TFs were also included in the array (Fig
7a). Although their expression pattern was not verified by
q-RTPCR, those represented by probe sets Ta.11509.1.S1,
TaAffx.117676.1.S1 and Ta.25258.1.S1 showed very similar expression patterns to Ta.37139.1.S1 and their
encoded proteins sharea very high degree of sequence

similarity with each other and to several barley
endosperm expressed NAC genes [6]. Phyologenetic analysis [see Additional file 6] of the NAC related sequences
from the TIGR gene indices and PlnTFDB database, placed
the wheat and barley genes in a small subcladeof the NAM
group [32] together with two TFs from rice and the maize
nrp1 and ZmNAC4 genes. Consistent with our data,
expression of the maize genes is confined to starchyendosperm cells [33,34], while MPSS data for the two rice
genes suggests their expression is confined to the developing grain. No functions have been ascribed to these proteins; however, their tissue specificity and the fact that the
maize nrp1 gene is a maternally controlled imprinted
gene, may indicate an important role in endosperm development.

TaMyb3
HvMyb3 a myb-related (SHAQKYF R1myb) TF was
reported to be capable of interacting with BPBF and BLZ2
and to bind to the TATC elements in the promotersof the
Itr-1 (BTI-CMe), and α-amylase Amy6.4 genes [26]. The
expression profile of the wheat TaMyb3 (Ta.7266.1.S1)
orthologue (Figure 5G), however, does not reflect those of
BTI-CMe (Figure 6C), or the LMW subunit genes (Figure
6A), nor TaGAmyb (Figure 5C), which potentially regulates the same spectrum of genes, and is more consistent
with a primary role in the embryo for this factor. In fact
HvMyb3 was also shown to be expressed in barley
embryos in addition to the developing endosperm, but it
ispossible that the roles of HvMyb3 and TaMyb3 may
have diverged.

Interestingly, the gene represented by probe set
Ta.12286.1.A1, had a distinctly different expression pattern (Figure 7A) although was still highly homologous to
the others [see Additional file 5], suggesting either this
protein has a different function, or performs the same
function in other tissues of the developing grain.

Pericarp-like expression
Two previously uncharacterised TFs showed a typical pericarp like expression similar to transcripts in groups 2_4
and 3_4 (Figure 2).

Embryo-like expression
Three of the other TFs chosen for further analysis showed
an embryo like expression pattern similar to group 1_1
and 2_1 transcripts.
TaEmBP and TaVP1
TaEmBP a bZIP TF [35] and ZmVP1 an ABI3B3 class TF
[36] are known to be associated with maturation of the
embryo and aleurone layer and the expression profiles of
TaEmBP and TaVP1 both showed an embryo like pattern
(Figure 5E, F). Known targets of both factors include genes
encoding the Em (early methionine) protein that are
involved in protecting cells against tissue damage during
seed desiccation [37]. Expression of the multiple Em
genes is induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and involves both
EmBP and VP1, binding to the G-box in the abscisic acid
response element (ABRE[38]). Expression of the Em genes
present in the array (Figure 6B) was typical of group 1_1
transcripts, thus consistent with TaEmBP and TaVP1,
being responsible for their expression.

Maize VP1 is also known to be involved in expression of
the aleurone specific myb TF gene C1 and in the repression of α-amylase gene expression in the aleurone layer
late in grain development [39,40]. Accordingly, ZmVP1
was found to be highly expressed in both developing
embryos and the aleurone layer. Since Em mRNA accumulates to high levels in wheat aleurone cells (unpublished)
it is likely that this is also true in wheat which would mean
group 1_1 contains transcripts expressed in both embryo
and aleurone.

TaYab2
The protein corresponding to probe set Ta7721.1.S1 (Figure 5H) has homologyto the class of TFs known as C2C2YABBY, all of which contain a zinc-fingerDNA binding
domain and a HLH YABBY domain. This small plant-specific TF family contains seven to eight members in rice and
six in Arabidopsis, where they have been shown to be
involved in establishing abaxial-adaxial polarityin lateral
organs and in restricting meristem initiation and growth
[41]. Characterisation of the genes in monocots is less
advanced, but mutational and expression analysis suggest
that their functions have diverged between monocots and
dicots, with the monocot TFs lacking a central role in specifying abaxial-adaxial cell fate [42].

Phylogenetic analysis [see Additional file 6] shows that
apart from Ta7721.1.S1 the wheat Affymetrix chip also
has probesets for wheat homologues to all of the rice
genes [43] apart from OsYab1 and OsYab7. The wheat Ta
yab3, 4, and 5 genes are not expressed in developing grain
(which is also true of their counterparts in rice), while
Tayab2 (Ta7721.1.S1), TaDL (Ta4352.1.S1), and Tayab6
(Ta.14101.1.S1) all showed broadly similar pericarp like
patterns of expression (Figure 7B); which is consistent
with the pericarp expression reported for HvDL and early
grain development forOsyab2, 6 and OsDL [6,43]. Our
data are consistent with a role for all these yabby proteins
in pericarp development in wheat.
TaARF
Probeset Ta.7431.1.A1 (Figure 5I), shows homology to
the auxin response factor (ARF) family of TFs that bind
specifically to TGTCTC-containing auxin response elements (AuxREs). This relatively small TF family (25 mem-

bers in rice) play a pivotal role in auxin-regulated gene
expression of primary response genes [44]. The wheat
gene sequence is most closely related to the rice OsARF22
and the Arabidopsis AtARF16 and 10 genes [see Additional file 7] that are highly expressed in most tissues [45].
The function of these ARFs is unknown but the wheat
gene expression profile would be consistent with an
auxin-mediated role in pericarp development. A second
ARF represented by the probe set Ta2593.2.S1 was also
highly expressed in developing grain although in a pattern
consistent with roles in both the pericarp and endosperm
(Fig. 7C), This gene is most closely related to OsARF4 of
rice and At ARF2 of Arabidopsis. Mutants in AtARF2 result
in pleiotropic effects related to its repression of cell division. For example, knockouts of ATARF2 lead to extra cell
divisions in the integument, which in turn result in the
production of larger seeds [46]. It would be of interest to
determine if Ta2593.2.S1 has a similar role in the pericarp
and endosperm of wheat.

Conclusion
The transcriptome of developing wheat caryopses shows
massive changes in transcript abundance which can be
related to key processes driving development. The data
presented here represent a resource which can be
exploited by those studying transcriptomics in wheat
grain to place their results in a developmental context,
exemplified by analysis of the effects of heat and drought
treatments. We have also shown that the time course data
can be interpreted to provide evidence on the tissue specificity and putative function of transcription factors without the need to isolate individual tissues fromthe grain. It
is likely that many future applied studies on wheat will
also involve whole-grain transcriptomics on elite cultivars
(as in a recent e-QTL study; [10]) so our data are suited to
help interpret these. The value of this dataset will increase
as knowledge of the function and spatial distribution of
the transcripts represented on the Affymetrix wheat array
improves. All the data has been submitted in MIAMEcompliant form to the ArrayExpress database (Accession
Number E-MEXP-1193).

Methods
Growth of wheat cv. Hereward
After 10 weeks vernalisation, plants were transferred to a
glasshouse with day/night temperatures of 18°C/15°C
and 16 hours light. The main stem heads were tagged at
anthesis. Developing whole caryopses were then harvested 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35 and 42 daa and
immediately frozen at -80°C for RNA extraction. Each
sample comprised approximately 100 caryopses taken
from the central third of 10 heads, with two samples being
taken from each developmental stage. These samples were
treated as biological replicates for mRNA extraction and
array analysis. A further 20 developing caryopses were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/121

harvested from the middle part of each ear at 10, 12, 14,
17, 21, 28, 35 and 42 daa and at maturity. Those were
immediately frozen a -20°C for biochemical studies.
In the environmental-treatment experiment, plants were
moved to controlled environment (CE) cabinets from the
glasshouse at about 3 daa. They were initially grown with
70% relative humidity, day/night temperatures of 23°C/
15°C and watering to 100% field capacity. Drought stress
(44% field water capacity, 23°C/15°C day/night temperature), increased temperature (28°C/20°C, 100% field
water capacity), and drought stress (44% field capacity)
with increased temperature (28°C/20°C) stresses were
then applied from 15 to 28 daa as described by [17].
Whole developing caryopses were collected at 14, 21 and
28 daa.
RNA extraction
The method was modified from [47]. 1.5–3 g of tissue was
ground in liquid nitrogen and were extracted in CTAB
buffer (2% (w/v) CTAB, 2% (w/v) PVP K30, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 2.0 M NaCI, 0.5 g/l spermidine, 2% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The supernatant was
extracted twice with chloroform:IAA (24:1) to remove
proteins. RNA was precipitated by addition of 0.25 vol. of
10 M LiCl and incubation on ice overnight. The RNA pellet was dissolved in SSTE buffer (1.0 M NaCl, 0.5% (w/v)
SDS, 10 mM Tris HCl pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA) to remove
polysaccharides and extracted once with chloroform:IAA.
After ethanol precipitation, total RNA was dissolved in
DEPC-treated water and stored at -80°C.

Total RNA was purified through RNeasy mini spin columns (Qiagen). About 2 μg of total RNA was loaded on
MOPs gels to check the purity. The integrity of RNA was
determined with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2000 CE system.
Affymetrix Genechip® hybridisation and data analysis
Transcriptional profiling was performed using the
Affymetrix GeneChip® Wheat Genome Array using the
standard one-cycle cDNA synthesis protocol and hybridisation (as described in the GeneChip® Expression Analysis
Technical Manual). Transcriptome data analysis was carried out in the GeneSpring® 7 package (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) except where otherwise stated. Individual
signals from the perfect match probes were pre-processed
using the variant of the Robust Multichip Average algorithm which takes account of the probe GC composition
[48]. Probesets were filtered to remove those (about 40%)
which never showed expression values > 10 for any condition. The cross-gene error model option of GeneSpring
was turned off so that only the true biological replicates
were used to estimate variance. A one-way ANOVA was
applied to the developmental series using Welch's t-test
(which does not assume equal variance) with P < 0.05 and

the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. The 14,550 probesets that passed this test
were deemed to show significant differential expression
through development.
The condition tree in Figure 2 was derived from this gene
set, using Pearson correlation as the co-expression measure. For cluster analysis, probesets where Affymetrix information indicated that they were likely to cross-hybridise
were removed to give 8,956 probesets. Organisation of
probesets into clusters with similar expression profiles
was applied to this set using the Self Organising Map algorithm [49] with 100,000 iterations and radius = 6.0 to give
12 clusters arranged as a 3 × 4 map (Figure 3).
Probesets were allocated to tissue and biological process
categories according to sequence similarity of the Affymetrix target sequence to known sequences. Tissue categorisation was based on (1) genes where tissue specificity of
expression is known (e.g. glutenins), or (2) similarity
(Blastn with E < 10-10) to barley ESTs identified as belonging to clusters which had tissue-specific expression by [6],
or (3) similarity (>90% identity) to in situ probes which
showed specific expression in wheat caryopsis sections
[13]. The ten biological process categories were chosen to
represent key processes in grain development. Probesets
were allocated to these exclusively according to the occurrence of key terms in annotation retrieved from hits in
Genbank nr database (Blastx with E < 10-10). Further allocations were made by retrieving the closest TIGR pseudomolecule (release 5) rice locus [50] for each probeset
using the WhETS system [51]. The slimGO terms associated with each rice locus were then used to map process
categories onto the probesets. The complete annotation
sets and category allocations are available in Supplementary Data [see Additional file 1].
The equivalent developmental stages in the developmental series for the CE grown samples (Table 1) were calculated using GenStat® 9.0 (VSN, UK) statistical package. Log
of expression from the developmental series was linearly
interpolated for 32,512 probesets to give a value for every
day between 14 and 42 daa. Distance between the 12 CE
samples and interpolated developmental samples was
defined as square of difference of log expression, summed
over all probesets [see Additional file 3]. The daa which
gives the minimum distance is the estimate of the equivalent developmental stage for that CE sample. Bootstrapping was used to get an estimate of uncertainty; at each
iteration, a sample of size 32,512 was taken at random
from the set of probesets, and equivalent daa was recalculated. Two hundred iterations were performed and the
distribution in results indicated in Table 1.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed in
duplicate. Procedures followed were as in [52], with the
following modifications: 5 ug of RNA was used for each
sample, RNA was DNAse treated before the reverse transcriptase step, and the annealing temperature used was 60
degrees. The data were normalised to an internal control
transcript, the probeset for which Ta.2526.1.S1_at (DSS1/
SEM1 proteasome subunit family protein) shows consistent expression in array data for all samples presented here.
Data are displayed as geometric mean of replicates.

Authors' contributions
YW contributed to design and carried out the array experimentation; RLP carried out qRT-PCR, AKH did transcription factor analysis. CT-U and KF assisted with material
isolation from developmental series and environmental
treatment experiments, respectively. SW did the statistical
analysis to quantify environmental effects on development. MJG and PRS designed the environmental treatment experiment. ENCM, KJE and PRS together planned
the experimental programme. RACM carried out the bioinformatics analyses. PRS, AKH and RACM wrote the
manuscript.
