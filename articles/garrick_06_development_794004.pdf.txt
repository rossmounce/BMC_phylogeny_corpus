Abstract
Background: Molecular genetic approaches have much to offer population biology. Despite
recent advances, convenient techniques to develop and screen highly-resolving markers can be
limiting for some applications and taxa. We describe an improved PCR-based, cloning-free, nuclear
marker development procedure, in which single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
plays a central role. Sequence-variable alleles at putative nuclear loci are simultaneously identified
and isolated from diploid tissues. Based on a multiple allele alignment, locus-specific primers are
designed in conserved regions, minimizing 'null' alleles. Using two undescribed endemic Australian
Collembola as exemplars, we outline a comprehensive approach to generating and validating suites
of codominant, sequence-yielding nuclear loci for previously unstudied invertebrates.
Results: Six markers per species were developed without any baseline genetic information. After
evaluating the characteristics of each new locus via SSCP pre-screening, population samples were
genotyped on the basis of either DNA sequence, restriction site, or insertion/deletion variation,
depending on which assay was deemed most appropriate. Polymorphism was generally high (mean
of nine alleles per locus), and the markers were capable of resolving population structuring over
very fine spatial scales (<100 km). SSCP coupled with targeted DNA sequencing was used to obtain
genotypic, genic and genealogical information from six loci (three per species). Phylogeographic
analysis identified introns as being most informative.
Conclusion: The comprehensive approach presented here feasibly overcomes technical hurdles
of (i) developing suitably polymorphic nuclear loci for non-model organisms, (ii) physically isolating
nuclear allele haplotypes from diploid tissues without cloning, and (iii) genotyping population
samples on the basis of nuclear DNA sequence variation.

Background
In non-model invertebrates for which little or no prior
genetic information is available, developing suitably polymorphic nuclear markers represents a considerable

impediment. Fortunately, a limited number of conserved
exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) PCR primer pairs for
invertebrates are available [1,2], and diverse PCR-based
methods for developing anonymous nuclear markers

have been proposed (e.g. [3-6]). But perhaps an even
greater challenge is developing a suite of genetic markers
with sufficient resolution at an appropriate temporal and
spatial scale to answer the biological question at hand [7].
Whereas genotype and allele frequencies can change over
relatively few generations in diploid sexual species, DNA
sequences accumulate mutations over longer timescales.
For these reasons, obtaining three hierarchical levels of
genetic information (i.e. genotypic, genic and genealogical, sensu Sunnucks [7]) from the same marker is highly
desirable. But before 'three-tiered' markers can be routinely applied, the methodological hurdle of physically
isolating nuclear allele haplotypes one at a time from diploid tissues must be overcome [8-10]. SSCP offers a feasible alternative to costly and labor-intensive cloning of
PCR products using a biological vector [11], and when
coupled with targeted DNA sequencing, SSCP is an efficient technique for extracting three levels of genetic information simultaneously (e.g. [5,12-15]). Here, we present
a comprehensive approach for generating suites of codominant nuclear loci that combines the strengths of diverse
PCR-based marker development methods (above), selecting the most appropriate genotyping assay for newlydeveloped loci prior to large-scale screening, and extracting three levels of genetic information simultaneously.
Limitations of microsatellites in phylogeographic studies
Understanding what factors influence present-day spatial
patterns of genetic diversity, and predicting how a species
is likely to respond to environmental change, necessitates
an appreciation of processes that have molded its evolutionary history [10]. The use of microsatellites in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and
frequency data is now commonplace in animal phylogeographic studies. However, isolation of microsatellites
from certain invertebrate groups is notoriously difficult
(e.g. Onychophora, [16]; Lepidoptera, [17,18]; tenebrionid beetles, [19]), and once obtained, non-amplifying
'null' alleles, size homoplasy, and low levels of polymorphism can severely undermine their utility. For example,
after considerable effort, five of 11 microsatellite loci
developed by van der Wurff [20] for the Collembolon
Orchesella cincta were essentially unusable, and three of
the remaining six loci had four or fewer alleles from 376
individuals assayed [21]. In addition to low allelic diversity, which may be typical of microsatellite loci in many
insects [22], these markers are poorly-suited to inference
of genealogical relationships given that the mechanism of
mutation affecting repeat regions is often ambiguous, and
alleles can be very difficult to sequence.
Nuclear gene phylogeography
A complete understanding of how historical, demographic and selective processes have molded phylogeographic patterns can only be achieved via comparisons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/11

across multiple unlinked loci [8,10,23,24]. Inferences of
population history drawn from a single locus are likely to
fail to detect some major historical events that shaped the
present-day population structure of an organism [24], and
accounting for the normal stochastic variance among loci
is a major difficulty in phylogeographic studies that do
not exploit the signal carried by autosomal genes [23]. To
date such datasets have been relatively scarce owing to difficulties obtaining nuclear markers, and then collecting
genotypic, genic and genealogical information from the
same locus – this is especially true of invertebrate phylogeographic studies (but see [25,26]).
Log-dwelling 'giant' Collembola – a case study
While there is currently no simple solution to obtaining
nuclear markers from non-model animals, the comprehensive strategy presented here worked well with challenging organisms from a barely studied taxon: logadapted, slime mould-grazing 'giant' Collembola in the
family Neanuridae. Based on morphology, dispersal abilities of two as yet undescribed species (Pseudachorutinae
n. gen. n. sp. and Acanthanura n. sp.) are presumed to be
poor given these animals lack a spring organ, are soft-bodied and thus extremely susceptible to desiccation, and
have strong preferences for cool, moist microhabitats
(personal observation). Molecular genetic techniques
may provide the only means for studying aspects of the
population biology of these animals given that direct
observation, radio-tracking, and capture-mark-recapture
are not feasible for small, patchily-distributed log-dwelling invertebrates.

Six codominant, polymorphic nuclear markers per species
were developed using a five-step marker development
procedure. Briefly, segments of the nuclear genome are
amplified from several individuals under low-stringency
PCR conditions using a bank of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), EPIC and microsatellite primers
(step 1). The performance of primer pairs is evaluated
based on presence/absence of amplified DNA fragments
of corresponding sizes from all individuals assayed, and
'target' bands identified (step 2). Additional DNA templates are added to the subset and, where possible, higher
stringency PCR conditions used to preferentially amplify
target bands (step 3). Multiple representatives of the target
product are excised from the gel and used as template for
isotope incorporation PCR (step 4). Sequence- and/or
size-variable alleles are simultaneously identified and isolated using SSCP, reamplified from gel slices, and
sequenced (step 5). Based on a multiple allele alignment,
locus-specific primer pairs are designed in highly conserved regions. SSCP coupled with targeted DNA sequencing was used to obtain genotypic, genic and genealogical
information from six loci, for moderate to large population-genetic sample sizes (102 to 378 individuals). The

method yielded a robust dataset well suited to emerging
and traditional population-genetic and phylogeographic
analyses. To illustrate the interplay between molecular
population biology approaches and the utility and limitations of the three levels of genetic information, we
employed a subset of exploratory analyses commonly
used in molecular ecology and phylogeography.

Results
Identity and function of nuclear gene regions
Twelve species-specific primer pairs that reliably amplify
nuclear loci without appreciable null allele frequencies
were developed using SSCP coupled with targeted DNA
sequencing, in conjunction with four PCR-based marker
development procedures (methods A-D, see Methods;
Table 1). The gene regions amplified are unlinked and
include introns from the conserved nuclear genes Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) and Adenine Nucleotide Transporter
(ANT), a member of the Wingless (Wnt) gene family, and
eight anonymous loci. The Acanthanura n. sp. Wnt locus
(UcWnt) was presumed protein-coding because alleles
displayed open reading frames (ORFs), all observed sub-

stitutions were synonymous, and the sole amino acid
sequence showed high similarity with Wnt orthologues
reported for other Arthropods [27]. Since our restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay resolved
only silent DNA polymorphisms, this marker was considered selectively neutral. All other nuclear loci appeared
non-coding. For example, when DNA sequences from several alleles at each locus were translated, stop codons were
observed in each reading frame. Further, at size-variable
loci, insertion/deletion mutations (indels) were not consistently comprised of contiguous alignment gaps in multiples of three, which would cause frame shifts if
translated.
Evaluation of marker development and genotyping
methods
The comprehensive approach solved a number of commonly-encountered technical difficulties. For example,
unique alleles were conveniently identified and isolated
for sequencing without cloning, multiple nuclear loci suitable for constructing allele phylogenies were obtained
with gametic phase of segregating sites recovered with cer-

tainty (c.f. haplotype-subtraction, [28]), and three levels
of genetic information were simultaneously extracted
from the same marker.
For each polymorphic marker obtained using the
approach described in Methods, an average of 2.3 PCR
product-generating primer pairs were trialed, 13.3 DNA
sequences evaluated, and 2.2 locus-specific primer pairs
designed. Method C was only marginally more successful
than method A in producing nuclear loci informative at
the population-level. Generally, these two methods produced a moderate to large number of 'target' bands in the
initial stage of marker development, but a relatively high
proportion of these putative alleles were not homologous
(Table 2). Accordingly, the two methods that produced
the greatest number of loci also had the highest drop-out
rate. The converse was true for methods B and D, which
use long non-degenerate PCR primer pairs for initial
amplification of nuclear DNA (see Methods). Nonetheless, all four methods generated at least two useable markers (Table 1). In our experience, a multifaceted approach
to marker development seems to be the most efficient
strategy, and this philosophy underpins the general-purpose five-step procedure presented here.
Genotyping methods selected for each locus based on
SSCP pre-screening are given in Table 3. In general, the
procedure of resolving indel variation only (as commonly
applied in molecular ecology) was seldom selected, since
it would fail to detect considerable genetic variation.
Owing to the unexpectedly large number of substitutions
within short (<300-bp) fragments, the number of alleles

per locus resolved by SSCP coupled with targeted DNA
sequencing was between three and 10 times greater than
that which could be resolved from indel variation alone.
RFLP generally resolved the fewest alleles (Table 3), only
partly due to constraints posed by the prohibitive cost of
some enzymes. Levels of within-population variation mirrored trends evident from assessment of total number of
alleles detected by each of the three genotyping assays.
Genetic resolution was roughly proportional to cost and
time commitment, although where possible, genotyping
population samples on the basis of indel variation may be
more efficient than RFLP assays (Table 2).
Identification of population structure and assignment of
individuals
Bayesian clustering analysis of the two six-locus nuclear
datasets (supplemented by phylogenetic analysis of
mtDNA) identified four populations of Pseudachorutinae
n. sp., and five populations of Acanthanura n. sp. at Tallaganda (Figure 1). For both species, most individuals were
strongly assigned to a single genetic population (sample
sizes given in Table 4), admixed individuals tended to
occur at or near contact zones, and putative migrants were
rare.
Levels of polymorphism and phenetic relationships among
populations
The new nuclear markers displayed a moderate to large
number of alleles (Table 4), and were informative over
fine spatial scales (Figure 1). Allelic richness varied considerably among populations and loci. In both species,
loci assayed via SSCP coupled with targeted DNA

bContiguous

sequencing generally yielded the highest mean withinpopulation allelic richness values, while the converse was
true for loci assayed using RFLP. With the exception of
Sm150, markers assayed for indel variation provided an
intermediate level of resolution (Table 5).
Neighbor-Joining phenograms showed that for both species of Collembola, geographically proximate populations
group together (Figure 2). Under an infinite sites model,
Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards' [29] chord distance (Dc)
increases approximately linearly with time when population divergences are low (Dc ~0.2 – 0.4, [30]). In the
present study, the range of pair-wise Dc values was 0.12 to
0.41, so we can tentatively propose evolutionary scenarios
relating to the temporal sequence of divergence events.
For example, phenetic relationships among Pseudachorutinae n. sp. populations could indicate that BR was separated from the rest at the deepest split, closely followed by
PSR, whereas HCR/ESR recently diverged. Similarly, the

AR may have been the most ancient divergence among
extant Acanthanura n. sp. populations, while separations
between HCR/ESR, and between PSR/BR, are more recent
events.
Tests of recombination and selective neutrality
At SmEF-1α, significant evidence of recombination (P <
0.01, Table 6) was detected for three pair-wise comparisons involving four of the 21 alleles resolved (A13–A16,
A13–A18 and A3–A16). Because three of these alleles
occur only in the BR population (i.e. A13, A16 and A18,
Table 4), which is likely to have been isolated for a long
period of time [31], phylogeographic signal may be relatively unaffected [25]. Therefore only A3 was excluded
from phylogenetic analysis of SmEF-1α. All other loci
assayed via SSCP coupled with targeted DNA sequencing
were free of detectable recombination (Table 6).

Using the criteria for inferring non-neutrality of loci outlined in Methods, Tajima's D did not provide strong evidence for selection acting on any of the six DNA sequence
markers. Although there were two instances of significantly negative values of D (often associated with selection against rare deleterious alleles), observations from
other loci show that this is also consistent with population demographic changes (Table 6). Two cases of significantly positive values of D were evident. While we cannot
discount population-specific balancing or diversifying
selection, this result may also be an artifact of non-random sampling (e.g. family structure within samples col-

Phylogeographic analysis
Comparison of gene tree topologies within species
showed common patterns of deep molecular divergences
among (at least some) populations, and high spatial
localization of most alleles (Figure 3). A qualitative assessment of the degree of phylogeographic signal produced by
each of the six nuclear loci revealed that, for both Collembolons, EF-1α introns were the most informative (Figure
3, Table 2). Although these two loci did have the most
alleles, they also had the lowest maximum sequence
divergences among alleles relative to anonymous nuclear
loci (SmEF-1α = 3.6% uncorrected p c.f. Sm2 = 5.9% and
Sm8 = 5.5%; UcEF-1α = 3.0% c.f. Uc180 = 5.4% and Uc3
= 10.7%). As a consequence, all alleles at intron loci were
parsimoniously connected at 95% confidence to form a
single cladogram. This is a desirable property when estimating the root of an intraspecific gene tree [32], which is
a critical aspect of nested clade analysis (NCA, [33]).

For the three Pseudachorutinae n. sp. nuclear sequence
markers assayed, BR alleles tended to be quite divergent
from those found in other populations (Figure 3a–c). This
apparent deep divergence is consistent with population
relationships estimated from genic data (Figure 2), and
mtDNA data [31]. Acanthanura n. sp. sequence markers
showed that among-locus variability can be considerable
(Figure 3d–f). For example, although Uc180 and Uc3
allele phylogenies are topologically similar (i.e. starshaped), the former locus shows a monophyletic clade
exclusive to HCR and two populations are fixed for a single unique allele, while the latter locus has a monophyletic clade confined to AR, and no population is fixed

for a unique allele. However, the greatest contrast is
between UcEF-1α, which has three major hubs in the
cladogram, each with relatively narrow spatial distributions, and the two anonymous nuclear loci, which both
have a single high-frequency and geographically widespread allele at the center of those networks.

Discussion
The primary methodological advance provided by the
approach presented here lies in the ability to develop
nuclear markers with specific characteristics tailored to the
research question at hand, identify genotyping assays that
achieve a balance between efficiency and resolving power
prior to large-scale screening, and obtaining three levels of
genetic information simultaneously from the same
marker. A secondary advance comes from combining the
strengths of diverse PCR-based marker development protocols (Background) in a simple five-step procedure that
does not require cloning.

Using this approach, we obtained a suite of polymorphic
nuclear markers for two undescribed Collembola relatively quickly and cheaply. These markers were informative over fine spatial scales, appeared to be non-coding
(with the exception of UcWnt – see Results), were free of
appreciable null allele frequencies, and as far as we can
determine without pedigreed material, alleles were segregating in a Mendelian fashion. Together with targeted
DNA sequencing, SSCP was an effective technique for
obtaining genotypic, genic and genealogical information
from six nuclear genes for moderate to large populationgenetic sample sizes. These loci showed no consistent significant departure from neutrality over all populations,
were mostly free of detectable recombination, and were
therefore suitable for constructing nuclear gene trees using
standard phylogenetic procedures. Indeed, the datasets
obtained here are well-suited to variety of emerging coalescent-based statistical phylogeographic analyses [3436], and NCA.

The role of SSCP in development and application of threetiered nuclear markers
Single-stranded conformation polymorphism was effective for physically isolating nuclear allele haplotypes from
diploid tissues. While cloning of PCR products also provides a means of separating size-invariable alleles, this
procedure under many jurisdictions requires a dedicated
Physical Containment level 1 laboratory and formal permission from gene technology regulators, is labor-intensive, and expensive (e.g. requires cloning vectors and
competent bacteria). Further, to achieve a moderate level
of certainty regarding genotype assignment, at least four
clones per PCR product are usually sequenced [26], but
the number required to detect weakly amplifying alleles
may be considerably greater, and thus prohibitively
expensive [9]. An additional drawback is that cloned
sequences can have a greater propensity to reveal artifacts
such as Taq DNA polymerase error and PCR recombinants
[37].

The SSCP procedure provides researchers with the advantage of being able to identify putative sequence-variable
alleles directly from autoradiograph phenotypes. Thus,
only strategically-selected bands need to be sequenced.
Further, given the high sensitivity of radioisotope-based
methods for viewing low-concentration DNA [10], weakly
amplifying alleles can be detected with greater efficiency
than with cloning (for laboratories without access to radioisotope, silver-staining should produce comparable
SSCP results, and also permits bands to be excised and
reamplified in PCR [15]). Similarly, SSCP pre-screening
provides valuable information on levels of polymorphism
at a newly-developed locus, enabling informed decisions
about its suitability for addressing the research question,
and for identifying cost- and time-efficient genotyping
assays.

While we found SSCP to be a valuable technique for genotyping population samples on the basis of DNA
sequence variation at multiple nuclear loci, we must introduce a note of caution. When there is a large number of
individuals (c. >300) to be assayed, and/or a large number
of alleles (c. >15) at a locus, a substantial time commitment may be required. The cost of sequencing can
increase considerably when there are many unique gel
phenotypes (putative genotypes) present on each autoradiograph, or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) adopts multiple conformations. Running individuals that are likely to
share alleles on the same gel alleviates the former problem, while the latter situation seems to arise mostly when
primers contain degenerate nucleotide positions, and
where possible, we recommend avoiding their use for
large-scale screening. Finally, there may be rare occasions
where closely-related alleles produce indistinguishable
SSCP gel phenotypes. In these cases we have used a RFLP
assay to distinguish known alleles (Table 3). In the
absence of a diagnostic restriction site, it may be necessary
to design primers that amplify alleles singularly.
Identifying contemporary spatial-genetic patterns and
estimating population relationships
Joint analysis of genotypic data revealed population substructuring over fine spatial scales in both Collembola
species, consistent with expectations for ecologically-specialized, low-mobility animals. Although genotypic data
from multiple loci proved useful for describing contemporary spatial-genetic patterns, it offered little information on the degree of divergence among populations.
Having first objectively defined populations a posteriori in
a spatially explicit manner, we were then able to quantify
levels of within-population genetic diversity and estimate
population relationships using genic data.

Kalinowski [38] proposed that the total number of independent alleles (i.e. number of alleles at a locus minus

genetic distance-based analyses. In both species, geographically proximate populations tended to be genetically more similar to one another (c.f. distant
populations), and population divergences seem to have
occurred on different timescales throughout the evolutionary history of these animals at Tallaganda. However,
when genetic distances between populations are small,
either recent divergence with zero gene flow (isolation
model), or ancient divergence with low ongoing gene
flow (migration model) can represent equally plausible
scenarios [39]. While genic data are useful for quantifying
levels of genetic diversity and estimating population relationships, they are unable to provide a full picture that
integrates both separation time and gene flow [36]. This
can be addressed by analysis of DNA sequence data.

one, summed across loci) is a good indicator of precision
in genetic distance estimates. Accordingly, loci with many
alleles are more efficient in producing good estimates.
Nuclear markers developed using the approaches presented here and genotyped using SSCP coupled with targeted DNA sequencing were highly polymorphic (mean
15.5 alleles per locus, Table 3), and so are well-suited to

Nuclear gene phylogeography
Because models of isolation versus migration can lead to
similar gene tree topologies [36], the present datasets will
be analyzed using likelihood methods, and results presented elsewhere. Nonetheless, phylogenetic analyses
demonstrated that all of the new Collembola nuclear loci
assayed using SSCP coupled with targeted DNA sequencing contain phylogeographic signal that can be exploited.
Interestingly, in both species, the EF-1α locus – the only
one known to be an intron of a functional gene – had the
lowest range of sequence divergences yet the strongest
phylogeographic signal (Figure 3, Table 2), possibly indicating purifying selection not detected by Tajima's D neutrality tests (Table 6). Indeed, intron polymorphisms are
increasingly being recognized as important in gene regulation [40], and it has recently been postulated that the
majority of intronic DNA in the genome is likely to be
evolving under considerable selective constraint [41].

Although introns offered the greatest phylogeographic
resolution for both Collembolons, the value of anonymous nuclear sequence-markers should not be understated. Because different loci can vary widely in their
histories [23,24], sampling additional individuals (after a
certain point) is far less informative than sampling additional unlinked loci [34,36]. In the present study, comparative analysis of genes within species confirmed that
stochastic variance among loci can be considerable.
Although there were some notable differences in spatial
structuring, Acanthanura n. sp. loci Uc180 and Uc3 both
produced star-shaped phylogenies, consistent with expectations for an exponentially growing population [42]. In
contrast, UcEF-1α showed marked phylogeographic structuring, with multiple putative 'ancestral' allele haplotypes
occupying central positions in the cladogram, each associated with a series of closely-related descendants. This case
study illustrates that multiple nuclear sequence markers
have the potential to radically alter population inferences.

Conclusion
Recovering intraspecific nuclear gene trees that have not
been severely compromised by recombination or selection presents considerable theoretical, biological, and
analytical challenges [8-10]. Using the comprehensive
SSCP-based approach presented here, we have shown that
technical hurdles such as (i) developing suitably polymorphic nuclear loci for non-model organisms, (ii) physically
isolating nuclear allele haplotypes from diploid tissues
and (iii) genotyping population samples on the basis of
DNA sequence variation can be feasibly overcome. While
it is true that in some circumstances SSCP coupled with
targeted DNA sequencing can become a relatively timeconsuming and expensive genotyping procedure (see
above), this is probably true of any technique currently
available.

Methods
Taxon sampling, study site and DNA isolation
The two focal Collembola represent new species, and have
been clearly characterized (P. Greenslade, taxonomic
descriptions in preparation). No genetic information for
animals of the same genera (and in one case, subfamily)
was available prior to the present research program.
Between 1997 and 2004, 203 specimens of Acanthanura n.
sp. and 380 Pseudachorutinae n. sp. were collected from
130 rotting logs along a ~100 km transect traversing Tallaganda State Forest (SF), Tallaganda National Park (NP),
Deua NP and Badja SF (collectively referred to as 'Tallaganda'), in south-east New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
Genomic DNA was isolated using a simplified 2× cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol, modified
after Murray & Thompson [43].
Marker development procedures
We combined several previously-published protocols [46], modified to eliminate the need for cloning. We divided
methods used here into four categories (labeled A-D), and
describe a general SSCP-based approach for nuclear
marker development.
Step 1
Nuclear DNA was amplified via PCR from four conspecific individuals collected from different localities using
either (A) randomly selected pairs of short (10-mer)
RAPD primers, (B) randomly selected pairs of long (c. 20mer) aphid microsatellite primers, (C) degenerate EPIC
primer pairs, or (D) primers designed from anonymous
DNA sequences from a Pseudachorutinae n. sp. genomic
library (Table 1). All reactions were performed using a
Corbett Palmcycler CGI-960 in 10 µL volumes containing
16 µM ammonium sulphate, 68 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10
mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% bovine serum albumin, 10
mg/mL (Progen), 2 mM magnesium chloride, 200 µM
each dNTP, 0.5 µM each primer for two-primer reactions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/11

or 1.0 µM for single-primer reactions (see below), 0.5
units of Taq DNA Polymerase (Promega), and 1 µL template DNA. PCR profiles were: (A) 94°C 30 s, 37°C 30 s,
72°C 30 s (35 cycles); (B) 94°C 3 min (1 cycle), 94°C 30
s, 52°C 1 min, 68°C 8 min (35 cycles), 68°C 8 min (1
cycle); (C) and (D) 94°C 2 min (1 cycle); 94°C 30 s, 40 –
58°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min (35 cycles), 72°C 2 min (1 cycle).
For methods C and D, we used an annealing temperature
gradient: each template was amplified using 40, 46, 52
and 58°C.
Step 2
To evaluate primer pairs and identify 'target' bands, PCR
products were electrophoresed through 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gels (8 cm) at 200 V for 30 min, stained
with ethidium bromide, and viewed using ultraviolet
light. We used a 100-bp ladder (Fermentas) to estimate
fragment sizes. For methods A and B, one of the four templates was also used in reaction mixtures that contained
each primer alone. Bands that amplified only in twoprimer reactions have different primers on each end, and
can be sequenced [4]. Bands of approximately the same
size (± 50-bp) that amplified from all four templates, and
were >100-bp were considered for further development
(smaller fragments are unsuitable for designing internal
locus-specific primers).
Step 3
DNA template from four individuals was added to the
subset. For methods A and B, PCRs were repeated as in
step 1. For methods C and D, the two consecutive annealing temperatures that gave good amplification of 'target'
bands in step 2 defined upper and lower limits of a second
gradient profile, again using four annealing temperatures
per template, but now increasing in 2°C increments (c.f.
6°C, step 1). All other PCR conditions followed step 1.
Step 4
PCR products were electrophoresed and viewed as in step
2. Target bands were excised using a scalpel, gel slices were
soaked in 20 µL 1× TE (10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 1 mM
EDTA pH 8.0), microfuged at 13,000 g for 30 s, and incubated at 45°C for 30 min. From each gel slice, 1 µL of the
supernatant was used as template for reamplification with
isotope incorporation, where 0.05 µL [α33P]-dATP (10
mCi/mL) was added to each 10 µL reaction mixture (step
1). We employed the same PCR profile in step 1, using the
lowest annealing temperature identified in step 3 where
applicable.
Step 5
To identify and simultaneously isolate putative sequenceand/or size-variable alleles, isotope-labeled PCR products
were subjected to SSCP following Sunnucks et al. [15].

Selection of genotyping assays
We used a SSCP pre-screening step to assess suitability of
new nuclear loci for yielding informative populationgenetic data over the spatial scale of interest. Based on a
subset of 20 individuals collected from diverse locations
across the study site, copy number, ploidy and the minimum number of alleles at each locus were tentatively
inferred from gel phenotypes. Loci with sufficient polymorphism and easily interpreted banding patterns (e.g.
Figure 4) were targeted for large-scale SSCP screening of
DNA sequence variation. Lower sensitivity assays such as
RFLP or indel detection procedures were used for other
loci.

observed at the Uc3 locus
Autoradiograph showing some of the SSCP gel phenotypes
Autoradiograph showing some of the SSCP gel phenotypes observed at the Uc3 locus. Three distinct patterns are evident, and sequencing confirmed that these
correspond with three genotypes: "0606" (lanes 1, 5, 6, 10–
14, 16, 18–20, 22 and 24), "0202" (lanes 2–4) and "0608"
(lanes 15, 17, 21 and 23). Lanes 7–9 are too faint to score,
and were rerun. SSCP successfully detected small sequence
differences; alleles 02 and 06 differ by one substitution, alleles
06 and 08 differ by a 3-bp deletion. In this example, homozygotes display two bands in the upper ssDNA banding system
(one band per complementary strand), while heterozygotes
display four (but see Discussion). Here, the lower doublestranded DNA banding system is uninformative. Running
conditions were 15 W for 4 h at 4°C, 40 cm gel.

tions for a co-dominant diploid locus were identified (Figure 4), staple holes were used to align the film and dried
gel, and positions of bands of interest were marked with a
needle. Multiple alleles were excised (usually as ssDNA),
soaked in TE, and incubated. Again, 1 µL of the supernatant was used for reamplification (PCR conditions follow
step 1), then sequenced. For products generated using
method A, one of the RAPD primers modified with a 10bp 5' M13R(-20) tail (5'-TTCACACAGG-3') was used during reamplification, then sequenced using M13R(-20).
Based on a multiple allele alignment, long (18- to 25mer) locus-specific primers were designed in conserved
regions flanking polymorphic sites. Amplified fragment
lengths <350-bp were preferred, given that sensitivity of
SSCP is less efficient for larger fragments [44].

Genotyping procedures
Single-stranded conformation polymorphism coupled
with targeted sequencing of alleles was used to genotype
individuals on the basis of DNA sequence variation following Sunnucks et al. [15]. Radio-labeled PCR products
were run on 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gels (40 cm)
in a 4°C room. Run times and voltage were determined
empirically (typically 5 to 11 h at 15 W, 13 mA). Samples
with similar SSCP gel phenotypes were rerun side-by-side,
and alleles from multiple representatives of each putative
genotype per gel were excised, reamplified, and
sequenced.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism assays were
designed using NEBCUTTER V2.0 [45]. From the prescreening step above, multiple alleles were selected for
sequencing (common alleles were favored because they
are more informative at the population-level). Restriction
enzymes were chosen according to commercial availability, cost-effectiveness, and production of restriction site
polymorphisms that could be easily resolved and for
which cis and trans phase of multiple site heterozygotes
could be unambiguously determined (see [3]). Composition of the 20-individual subset was rotated among loci to
prevent potential biases on the marker characteristics [5].
Restriction digests were performed in 25 µL volumes containing: 2.5 µL recommended 10× Buffer (New England
Biolabs, NEB), 2.5 µL spermidine trihydrochloride 40
mM (Sigma), 12.25 µL dH2O, 0.25 µL BSA 10 mg/mL
(NEB), 2.5 u restriction enzyme, and 7 µL PCR product.
Reactions were incubated (37°C for 12–16 h), and digestion products separated via electrophoresis following step
2.
Indels were assayed by electrophoresing [α33P]-dATPlabeled PCR products (amplified from genomic DNA)
through 6% denaturing acrylamide gels (40 cm) for 2 h at
65 W, 40 mA, then viewed via autoradiography. Representatives of all observed alleles were sequenced to assess
homology and determine the nature of the size variation.

Sequence alignment, identity and function of nuclear gene
regions
DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730XL by
Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Sequences were edited with reference to chromatographs and aligned using ALIGNIR
V2.0 (LI-COR). Areas of ambiguous alignment were omitted from the dataset. The identity of amplified gene
regions was investigated using the nucleotide and protein
BLAST search procedure [46]. Possible gene function was
assessed by inspecting translated sequences for ORFs.
Identification of population structure and assignment of
individuals
A Bayesian clustering procedure using multi-locus genotype data, implemented in STRUCTURE V2.1 [47], was
used to identify the number of populations (K), and
assign individuals probabilistically to 'genetic' populations. Datasets for both species consisted of six nuclear
loci. All runs employed the correlated allele frequency
model and the admixture ancestry model. Estimated log
likelihoods were obtained for K = 1 to K = 8, with five replicates of each K. A burn-in of 105 Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) generations and run length of 106 MCMC
generations was employed. All other parameters were
default. The smallest value of K that captured the major
structure in the data and identified geographically cohesive populations was considered correct. Unless otherwise
stated, only individuals that were strongly assigned (Q ≥
0.90) to a single 'genetic' population were included in
subsequent analyses given that admixed individuals cannot be unambiguously assigned. In cases where mtDNA
data (not shown) identified a monophyletic clade nested
within a single 'genetic' population, we separated those
samples (and hence, erected an additional population) to
reduce the chance of introducing Wahlund effect into
analyses of nuclear loci. Full comparison of mtDNA and
nuclear loci is outside the scope of this paper and will be
presented elsewhere. Owing to relatively small sample
sizes per population (Results), putative migrants were
omitted from the datasets because they can potentially
have a large impact on genetic diversity indices and
obscure phylogeographic patterns.
Levels of polymorphism and phenetic relationships among
populations
Within-population and overall genetic variation of
nuclear loci was assessed via allelic richness (A), calculated using a standardized sample size 14 diploid individuals in HP-RARE V1.0 [48]. Percentage of loci
polymorphic (P) per population was calculated from the
raw data. Phenetic relationships among populations were
estimated via Neighbor-Joining (NJ) using Cavalli-Sforza
& Edwards' [29]Dc. Relative to other allele frequencybased genetic distances, Dc is efficient in obtaining the correct tree topology under varying demographic scenarios,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/11

displays low sampling error [30], and is standardized with
respect to drift [49]. To assess node support, we used
PHYLIP V3.5c [50] to generate 1000 bootstrap distance
matrices from which NJ trees were constructed, and then
calculate the majority-rule (extended) consensus tree.
Tests of recombination and selective neutrality
For loci assayed via SSCP coupled with targeted DNA
sequencing, GENECONV V1.81 [51] was employed to
evaluate evidence for recombination. Given that sensitivity and power of this analysis can be expected to increase
with sampling effort, all observed alleles (including those
present only in admixed and/or migrant individuals) were
examined.

To test for departures from neutrality, Tajima's D [52] was
calculated in DNASP V4.10.3 [53] for each population,
and for all populations combined. While significant differences from the neutral expectation of zero can may
indicate selection, they can also arise owing to population
expansion, bottleneck, or heterogeneity of mutation rates
among nucleotide sites. Since selection acts locally within
the nuclear genome (whereas population demographic
changes leave a common signature across multiple
unlinked loci), we considered a significant departure from
the neutral expectation at a given locus in all populations
identified here as strong evidence of selection acting upon
that locus. Conversely, when all loci displayed negative
values of Tajima's D within a single population, we interpreted this as evidence for population growth (or
decline). We acknowledge that population-specific selective sweeps affecting a single locus would be overlooked
under this interpretation. Parameter sets and assessment
of significance for tests of recombination and neutrality
followed Garrick et al. [31].
Phylogeographic analysis
Genealogical relationships among alleles at a locus were
estimated using Templeton et al.'s [54] statistical parsimony, implemented in TCS V1.21 [55]. Alignment gaps
were treated as a fifth character state, and contiguous gaps
were coded as a single indel. Cladogram ambiguities were
solved using predictions derived from coalescent theory,
following Pfenninger & Posada's [56] frequency, topological and geographical criteria.

Authors' contributions
RCG carried out the laboratory work, preformed data
analyses and drafted the manuscript. PS identified the
need to obtain three hierarchical levels of genetic information from the same locus, conceived the comprehensive
marker development approach, and revised the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.
