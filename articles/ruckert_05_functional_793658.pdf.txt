Abstract
Background: Corynebacterium glutamicum is a high-GC Gram-positive soil bacterium of great biotechnological
importance for the production of amino acids. To facilitate the rational design of sulphur amino acid-producing strains,
the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction providing the necessary reduced sulfur moieties has to be known.
Although this pathway has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and low-GC Gram-positives
like Bacillus subtilis, little is known for the Actinomycetales and other high-GC Gram-positive bacteria.
Results: The genome sequence of C. glutamicum was searched for genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of
inorganic sulphur compounds. A cluster of eight candidate genes could be identified by combining sequence similarity
searches with a subsequent synteny analysis between C. glutamicum and the closely related C. efficiens. Using mutational
analysis, seven of the eight candidate genes, namely cysZ, cysY, cysN, cysD, cysH, cysX, and cysI, were demonstrated to be
involved in the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. For three of the up to now unknown genes possible functions
could be proposed: CysZ is likely to be the sulphate permease, while CysX and CysY are possibly involved in electron
transfer and cofactor biosynthesis, respectively. Finally, the candidate gene designated fpr2 influences sulphur utilisation
only weakly and might be involved in electron transport for the reduction of sulphite. Real-time RT-PCR experiments
revealed that cysIXHDNYZ form an operon and that transcription of the extended cluster fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ is strongly
influenced by the availability of inorganic sulphur, as well as L-cysteine. Mapping of the fpr2 and cysIXHDNYZ promoters
using RACE-PCR indicated that both promoters overlap with binding-sites of the transcriptional repressor McbR,
suggesting an involvement of McbR in the observed regulation. Comparative genomics revealed that large parts of the
extended cluster are conserved in 11 of 17 completely sequenced members of the Actinomycetales.
Conclusion: The set of C. glutamicum genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction was identified and four novel
genes involved in this pathway were found. The high degree of conservation of this cluster among the Actinomycetales
supports the hypothesis that a different metabolic pathway for the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds than that
known from the well-studied model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis is used by members of this order, providing the basis
for further biochemical studies.

Background
In many micro-organisms as well as in higher plants the
metabolism of sulphur is based on the uptake and subsequent reduction of oxidised, inorganic sulphur compounds, usually sulphate. While this pathway has been
studied in detail in the model organisms Escherichia coli
for the Gram-negative bacteria [1] and Bacillus subtilis for
the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positives), almost no data is
available for the high-GC Gram-positives of the order
Actinomycetales with the exception of the functional analysis of cysH from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2].
The pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction and its
genetic basis in E. coli and B. subtilis can be summarised as
follows: After uptake through either an ABC-type transporter, in E. coli encoded by sbp [EMBL:AAC76899] and
EMBL:AAC75476,
cysUWA
[EMBL:AAC75477,
EMBL:AAC75475] [1] or, in B. subtilis, a permease
encoded by cysP [EMBL:CAB13432] [3], reduction of inorganic sulphate starts with the activation of sulphate by
adenylylation, catalyzed by sulphate adenylyltransferase
(EC 2.7.7.4), and yielding adenylylsulphate (APS). In E.
coli this enzyme is a heteromer encoded by cysD and cysN
[EMBL:AAC75794, EMBL:AAC75793] while B. subtilis
uses the homomeric protein Sat [EMBL:CAB13437]
(encoded by ylnB ) which is known in other organisms to
be involved in dissimilatory sulphate reduction [4]. The
release of sulphite from APS can occur either by direct
reduction through APS reductase (CysH, EC 1.8.4.10) or
by APS kinase (CysC, EC 2.7.1.25) mediated phosphorylation and subsequent reduction of the product, phosphoadenylylsulphate (PAPS), by PAPS reductase (CysH,
EC 1.8.4.8). E. coli has been demonstrated to use the twostep
reaction
via
CysHC
[EMBL:AAC75804,
while
B.
subtilis
CysH
EMBL:AAC75792]
[EMBL:CAB13431] can also directly convert APS to sulphite [5]. In either case, sulphite is then reduced to sulphide by sulphite reductase (CysIJ [EMBL:AAC75805,
EMBL:AAC75806], EC 1.8.1.2) [6]. In addition to the
enzymes directly involved in the catalysis, two additional
proteins are thought to be necessary for sulphate reduction in E. coli: uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase
(CysG [EMBL:AAC76393], EC 2.1.1.107) and PAPS phosphatase (CysQ [EMBL:AAC77171]). The former is needed
for the biosynthesis of the sulphite reductase cofactor siroheme, catalyzed by YlnD [EMBL:CAB13435] and YlnF
[EMBL:CAB13437] in B. subtilis [7], while the latter is
believed to eliminate excess amounts of PAPS which are
highly toxic for the cell [1].
In a continuation of our work to elucidate the biosynthesis of L-methionine in the Gram-positive non-sporulating
actinobacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum [8], the
reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds was investigated in order to learn how the reduced sulphur needed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/121

for incorporation into L-methionine is formed. Based on
the knowledge of assimilatory sulphur reduction and the
genes described for the two model organisms E. coli and
B. subtilis, we tried to identify the set of genes involved in
the assimilatory reduction of inorganic, oxidised sulphur
compounds in C. glutamicum. Real-time RT-PCR was then
applied to analyse the operon structure of the genes found
and to elucidate their regulation in cells incubated with
different sulphur sources. Subsequently, RACE-PCR was
used to map the transcription start points of the identified
transcription units to identify the potential promoters.
Finally, comparison with other completely sequenced
members of the Actinomycetales was carried out in order to
learn about the phylogenetic distribution of the assimilatory sulphur reduction genes.

Results
Identification of a Corynebacterium glutamicum gene
cluster possibly involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction
by sequence similarity and comparative genomics
In a previous investigation, the whole genome sequence
of C. glutamicum [9,10] was used to elucidate the pathway
for L-methionine biosynthesis [8]. In this study, we
extended this work and analysed the genetic basis for the
reduction of inorganic sulphate. Using genes known to be
involved in the assimilatory reduction of sulphate from
Escherichia coli [1], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2], and
Bacillus subtilis [3,7,11] similar coding sequences (CDS)
were searched for in the C. glutamicum genome sequence.

This approach led to the identification of a cluster of four
CDS (cg3118, cg3116, cg3115, and cg3114 ) in C. glutamicum which might be the orthologues of the E. coli genes
cysI, cysH, cysD, and cysN (Table 1 and Figure 1), while no
genes with high similarity to the E. coli genes cysC, cysJ, sbp
or the cysPUWA cluster could be found (data not shown).
Likewise, no clear homologues of the B. subtilis genes cysP
or ylnB were detected. Closer examination of the genomic
neighbourhood of the four candidate genes revealed
another three CDS which are located within (cg3117 ) or
directly adjacent (cg3112, cg3113 ) to the identified cluster
of cys genes. To determine the boundaries of this cluster,
all genes in this genomic region were compared with the
genome of the closely related species Corynebacterium efficiens [12], using a bidirectional best BLAST hit method
[13].
Thereby it could be shown that besides the identified cys
orthologues, the localisation of cg3112, cg3113, and
cg3117 is also well conserved between C. glutamicum and
C. efficiens, as is that of cg3119 while directly up- and
downstream of the cluster the syntenous order of genes is
interrupted by insertions in C. glutamicum (data not
shown). The notion that the cys gene-cluster extends from
cg3112 to cg3119 is corroborated by the finding that

of sulphate. Additional evidence that the whole cluster is

Bioinformatic analysis of the Corynebacterium
glutamicum candidate genes possibly involved in
assimilatory sulphate reduction
As a first step in the analysis of the eight candidate genes
similarity searches against the UniProt and PFAM databases were done. These searches led to a functional assignment for cg3114 and cg3115 as cysD and cysN respectively,
most likely encoding the two subunits for sulphate adenylyltransferase known from, e.g., E. coli (Table 1).

For Cg3118 and Cg3116, the similarity searches indicated
possible deviations from the enzymatic functions
described for E. coli (Table 1): Cg3118 (CysI) from C.
glutamicum, while moderately similar to CysI from E. coli,
displays a higher degree of similarity to ferredoxindependent sulphite and nitrite reductases (NirA) known
from other Actinomycetales and plants. In turn, based on a
multiple alignment, these sequences cluster much more
closely with the ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductases
from plants and cyanobacteria (e.g. Nir from Synechococcus sp.) than with CysI homologues of the a- and γ-proteobacteria (data not shown). Likewise, Cg3116 (CysH) was
found to be much more similar to CysH from M. tuberculosis which has been proven to act as APS reductase (EC
1.8.4.10) [2]. Furthermore, all the sequence motifs demonstrated to be necessary for the reduction of APS [16] are
present in CysH from C. glutamicum (data not shown).
For the proteins encoded by the four novel CDS cg3112,
cg3113, cg3117, and cg3119, no significant similarities to
proteins known to be involved in sulphate reduction were

detected, and only Cg3119 shows similarities to well
characterised proteins (Table 1). The gene cg3112 encodes
a protein similar to putative membrane proteins of the
domain of unknown function family 81 (DUF81), which
consists of integral membrane proteins. The notion that
Cg3112 is located in the membrane is further corroborated by the TMHMM software which predicts the presence of six transmembrane helices. The possible presence
of a signal peptide, detected by SignalP, indicates a Secdependent insertion into the membrane (data not
shown). Cg3113 is weakly similar to sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase from B. megaterium, indicating a possible
involvement in the biosynthesis of the siroheme cofactor
of sulphite reductase. The small CDS encoding Cg3117
shows similarities to small hypothetical proteins in several Actinomycetales. A multiple alignment of the significant hits revealed the presence of a conserved sequence
motif (CPYCx(14,19)WxCxxCxRxF) containing four conserved cysteine residues. They are reminiscent of those
found in Fe-S cluster coordination sites. Finally, Cg3119 is
highly similar to FprA and FprB, known to act as ferredoxin-NADP reductases in mycobacteria. FprA from M.
tuberculosis has been studied on the molecular level and is
now classified as NADPH-ferredoxin reductase (EC
1.18.1.2), but it is unknown in which biological processes
FprA and FprB are involved in M. tuberculosis [17,18].
Interestingly, a highly similar paralogue (Cg3049) is
present in the C. glutamicum genome itself. Based on the
well characterised FprA protein of M. tuberculosis, cg3049
and cg3119 were therefore named fprl and fpr2,
respectively.

Comparison of the putative sulphate assimilation gene
cluster of Corynebacterium glutamicum with gene
clusters of other members of the actinomycetes
As the cluster of genes possibly involved in sulphate
assimilation had been found to be conserved between C.
glutamicum and C. efficiens, the question arose whether the
findings for sulphate assimilation in C. glutamicum are
specific for these two organism or if the cluster and the
pathway is conserved among the order of the Actinomycetales. Therefore, a search for conserved parts of the cluster
in all completely sequenced genomes of the bacterial
order as well as in the only partially completed genomes
of Brevibacterium linens and Thermobifida fusca was conducted, using the programs GECKO [19] and TheSEED
[20].

This approach revealed that most of the genes found to be
involved in sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum are also
found in other members of the Actinomycetales. Notable
exceptions are C. diphtheriae, Bifidobacterium longum, Leifsonia xyli, M. leprae, Propionibacterium acnes, and Tropheryma whipplei, as in all these organisms the genes needed
for assimilatory sulphate reduction are completely absent.
All these organisms are known pathogens or commensals
of humans, animals, or plants, the most likely explanation is that these bacteria obtain the required sulphurcontaining organic compounds directly from their hosts.
Concerning the conservation of the cluster, it was found
to be almost perfectly conserved in C. glutamicum and C.
efficiens (Fig. 2), as well as in the recently sequenced C.
jeikeium [21]. In the other members of the Actinomycetales
that contain the genes needed for sulphate assimilation,
these genes are also clustered, but in many cases the
cluster is split in two or three parts. In addition,
duplications seem to have occurred, e.g., in M. avium, N.
farcinica, and S. avermitilis.
Of the four novel genes cg3112, cg3113, cg3117 and
cg3119 (fpr2 ), only a cg3113-like gene was found in all
Actinomycetales containing parts of the cluster (Fig. 2),
adding additional evidence that it is involved in sulphate
assimilation. On the other hand, it proved to be the least
conserved on the amino acid level (data not shown).
cg3112 seems to be present only in the Corynebacteriaceae.
This might be due to the fact that in the Mycobacteriaceae,
Streptomycetaceae, and N. farcinica an ABC-type transporter
replaces Cg3112.
Fpr homologues are only found to be clustered with other
cys genes in Corynebacteriaceae, but at least one possible
homologue is present in all Actinomycetales that contain
the cluster. Another hint for the involvement in the reduction of sulphate is the co-occurrence of Cg3117 and Fpr

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/121

homologues lacking a ferredoxin-domain: M. tuberculosis,
M. avium, and N. farcinica all contain a two-domain protein consisting of a ferredoxin-like and a Fpr-like domain.
The Corynebacteriaceae, Streptomycetaceae, and T. fusca all
lack such a protein but possess a Cg3117-homologue in
the cluster. As the flavoprotein subunit of sulphite reductase CysJ is absent in all Actinomycetales, the data from the
comparative genomics approach provides circumstantial
evidence that the enzymatic equipment for sulphite
reduction in the Actinomycetales is similar to that found in
plants: In these eukaryotes electrons are transferred
directly from photosystem I via ferredoxin-NADP reductase and ferredoxin to the ferredoxin-dependent sulphite
reductase [22]. For C. glutamicum, this leads to the hypothesis that electrons might be transferred from NADPH+H+
by Fpr2 to Cg3117 which in turn delivers them to the
ferredoxin-dependent sulphite reductase.
Characterisation of the Corynebacterium glutamicum
gene cluster possibly involved in assimilatory sulphate
reduction by targeted gene deletion, mutational analysis,
and complementation
To determine if the CDS of the identified gene cluster
cg3119-3112 are involved in the assimilatory reduction of
sulphate, deletion mutants of all genes were constructed.
Gene-SOEing was used to create fusion products of chromosomal DNA sections of approximately 500 bp length
directly up- and downstream of the target gene. The resulting fusion products were cloned into the vector
pK18mobsacB and the obtained plasmids were used for
targeted gene deletion.

The resulting mutants CR018 to CR025 (Table 4) were
tested for their ability to grow on a solid minimal medium
containing differing inorganic sulphur compounds at 2
mM concentration as sole source of sulphur. Seven of the
eight mutant strains CR018 to CR024 were affected in
their ability to utilise inorganic sulphur sources. The most
common observed phenotype was a complete inability to
grow, like strain CR024 (∆cysI ) on medium containing
sulphate or sulphite, but in some cases, growth was only
severely reduced, like that of strain CR023 (∆cg3117 )
when utilising oxidised inorganic sulphur compounds
(Table 2).
All four mutants in the potential cys gene homologues
(cg3114, cg3115, cg3116, and cg3118) were unable to utilise sulphate as sole source of sulphur while they could
still grow on sulphide, thereby confirming that the
encoded proteins are involved in the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. Surprisingly, the mutants
lacking cysD, cysH, or cysN were also unable to grow on
sulphite and displayed a reduced growth rate on thiosulphate. This observation stands in contrast to the findings

+ denotes wild-type like growth
° indicates a severely reduced growth rate
- represents a complete lack of growth

made, e.g., for E. coli, where a loss of these genes does not
influence the ability to utilise sulphite or thiosulphate [1].
Of the four novel genes, the mutational analysis provided
strong evidence that the three previously uncharacterised
CDS cg3117, cg3113, and cg3112 are involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction (Table 2). The corresponding
mutant strains could either no longer grow on MMS containing only sulphate or sulphite (∆cg3113 and ∆cg3112)
or displayed a severely reduced growth rate (∆cg3117).
Therefore, they were named cysY, cysZ, and cysX, respectively. On the other hand, a loss of fpr2 did not influence
growth under the tested condition, indicating that the
encoded protein is either not involved in sulphate reduction or its function can be replaced, most likely by Fpr1,
the product of cg3049. Unfortunately, all attempts to verify this hypothesis failed, because deletion or disruption
of fpr1 was not possible. This indicates that Fpr1 might
have another, essential function in C. glutamicum.
As the genes cysI to cysZ might constitute an operon,
homologous complementation of the mutant strains
CR018 to CR024 (Table 4) was used to verify that the
observed phenotypes were due only to the loss of the
deleted gene and not caused by polar effects on genes
downstream of the deletion. This was done by PCR amplification of the gene in question and subsequent cloning of
the product in a suitable expression vector. The resulting
plasmids pCR018e to pCR024e (Table 4) were transferred
into the corresponding mutant strains and the ability of
the plasmid carrying strains to utilize inorganic sulphur
sources was tested as described above. In all cases, growth
of the mutant strain expressing the missing gene in trans
was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type, thus ruling out polar effects.

The plasmids pCR020e, pCR022e and pCR024e (carrying
cysDN, cysH, and cysI, respectively) were also used to try
heterologous complementation of corresponding E. coli
mutant strains to get additional evidence for the assumed
gene functions. Surprisingly, the complementation of E.
coli JM221 (cysD-) and JM246 (cysI-) with pCR20e, respectively, failed. Only AB462 (cysC-) and JM226 (cysH-) carrying pCR022e were able to grow with sulphate as sole
source of sulphur, and even these grew only slowly. These
results add evidence to the hypothesis that C. glutamicum
uses either a pathway differing from that in E. coli or that
the enzymes can only function as a complex in C.
glutamicum.
Analysis of the Corynebacterium glutamicum gene
cluster fpr2cysIXHDNYZ by growth tests in liquid culture
Based on the data obtained from the in silico and in vivo
analysis, a hypothesis of the possible functional role of
the four novel CDS was formulated, leading to a preliminary model for the pathway for assimilatory sulphate
reduction in C. glutamicum: The presence of transmembrane domains and the inability of the mutant strain to
grow on sulphate and sulphite as sole sources of sulphur
indicated that CysZ might be involved in the uptake of
these compounds. For CysY, a function in the
biosynthesis of the siroheme cofactor of sulphite reductase could be supposed as the phenotype of the CR019
(∆cg3113) mutant strain was indistinguishable from that
of CR024 (∆cysI). The small protein CysX might be
involved in electron transfer, with the four conserved
cysteine residues possibly being part of a Fe-S cluster like
those found in ferredoxins. For Fpr2, a function in the
reduction of ferredoxins could be assumed, possibly acting on CysX.

In order to substantiate these hypotheses, growth of the
mutant strains CR018, CR019, CR023, and CR025 (∆cysZ,
∆cysY, ∆cysX, and ∆fpr2, respectively) was measured via
real-time nephelometry in liquid minimal medium on
different inorganic sulphur sources at a concentration of 2
mM. From the obtained growth curves, the generation
times and the duration of the lag phases were calculated
and compared to those determined for the wild-type
strain (Table 3).

Transcriptional analysis of the Corynebacterium
glutamicum cys gene cluster
As gene order and the presence of possible transcription
termination sites indicated that the genes cysI to cysZ
might form an operon (Fig. 1), real-time RT-PCR was used
to verify this hypothesis. To disrupt the hypothetical
operon, a transposon mutant in cysI (CR026, insertion
997 bp downstream of the cysI gene start) was used, as it
could be assumed that the insertion of the transposon and
the vector with a size of ≈ 5.5 kb would lead to a premature termination of transcription. Using real-time RT-PCR,
the mRNA levels of the seven genes in the wild-type and
the mutant strain both grown with L-cysteine as sulphur
source were compared. The measurements revealed an
equally strong reduction of the relative mRNA levels of all
seven genes in the mutant downstream of the transposon
insertion site (Fig. 4). This observation and the finding
that the mRNA level upstream of the insertion is only
slightly increased provides strong evidence that cysIXHDNYZ indeed form an operon and that no additional promoters downstream of cysI exist.

This approach confirmed the observations made during
growth on solid minimal medium. In the case of CysX, it
provided further evidence for the hypothesis that CysX
might act like a ferredoxin: The generation time of the
mutant strain CR023 (∆cysX) is doubled to tripled (Table
3), indicating that the function of CysX can be partially
replaced by another protein, most likely one of the ferredoxins found in C. glutamicum. Interestingly, under these
conditions strain CR025 (∆fpr2) also delivered a phenotype, namely an increase in the lag phase during growth
with sulphate or sulphite of approximately three hours.
This provides circumstantial evidence that Fpr2 is indeed
involved in sulphur reduction, although its loss can be
compensated for.

Real-time RT-PCR was also applied to analyse whether the
clustered genes are subject to regulation by either one or
more of the inorganic substrates or by the products of
assimilatory sulphur reduction (namely sulphide and Lcysteine). Therefore, the mRNA levels of fpr2, cysI, and
cysZ in cells incubated in MMS with different sulphur
sources at 1 mM concentration was compared with those
in cells incubated in MMS without added sulphur. In all
cases with the exception of thiosulphate, a strong simultaneous reduction of mRNA abundance of all three genes in
cells incubated with a sulphur source was observed (Fig.
5A). Transcription levels of the genes of the cluster were
found to be strongly reduced in the presence of most inorganic sulphur sources while L-cysteine had a much
weaker, albeit still significant effect. Surprisingly, the relative transcription levels decreased only marginally in presence of thiosulphate, even at higher concentrations of up
to 5 mM (data not shown).

As prior growth tests on solid minimal medium containing high concentrations of sulphate had shown that strain
CR018 (∆cysZ) could grow under these conditions (data
not shown), additional tests with this strain were performed in liquid culture using varying concentrations of
sulphate. These tests confirmed that the mutant strain is
unable to grow with sulphate concentrations of less than
5 mM. With increasing sulphate concentration, growth is
gradually restored until, at above 30 mM, it reaches
almost the level of the wild-type strain (Fig. 3). This concentration-dependent restoration of growth provides
strong evidence that CysZ acts as the high-affinity sulphate transporter in C. glutamicum. Furthermore it indicates that at least one other transporter for sulphate must
exist which is able to function effectively only at sulphate
concentrations above 5 mM.

This data clearly proves that the assimilation of sulphur in
C. glutamicum is regulated by either the substrates or the
products of the assimilatory reduction of sulphate. Furthermore, the data indicates that this regulation is different from that found in E. coli, as thiosulphate has been
shown to repress transcription of the cys genes in that
organism [1]. Finally, the co-regulation of fpr2 and the cys
genes in C. glutamicum also provides circumstantial evidence that Fpr2 is involved in the reduction of sulphate.

The strong regulation of the three genes under study raised
the question at which concentration it would occur.
Therefore, the relative transcription levels in the presence
of varying amounts of sulphate were measured. By this
approach it could be demonstrated that already at a concentration of 100 µM sulphate the genes are as strongly
repressed as in the presence of 1 mM sulphate and more
while at 50 µM sulphate transcription levels are comparable to those observed in MMS without added sulphur (Fig.
5B).

Growth 3 the C. glutamicum wild-type and the ∆cysZ mutant strain in medium with different sulphate concentrations
Growth of the C. glutamicum wild-type and the ∆cysZ mutant strain in medium with different sulphate concentrations. Wild-type and mutant strain were grown in liquid minimal medium, cell growth was determined by real-time nephelometry. For each time point the mean of 18 measurements is displayed (3 independent cultivations, 6 parallels per
cultivation). The wild-type strain is denoted with filled diamonds, open symbols are used to indicate the mutant strain.

Determination of the transcription start sites in front of
the Corynebacterium glutamicum fpr2 and cysI genes
As the real-time RT-PCR data indicated that all seven cys
genes are described from one promoter, the RACE technique was applied to identify the promoter elements in
the intergenic region between fpr2 and cysI. Thereby, one
transcription start point was identified for each of the two
transcription units (Fig. 6). The sequences upstream were
compared to the the σ70 consensus promoter [23] revealing two hexamers showing similarity to the -10 and -35
region including an optimal spacing of 17 bases, but no
elements of an extended -10 region are detectable (Fig. 6).
These hexamers are in 7 respectively 8 of 12 positions
identical to the consensus sequence, which represents an
average value for promoters in C. glutamicum, with the
most conserved bases of the consensus promoter also
present in the two promoters described here. An interesting finding was the observation that both promoters overlap with potential binding-sites of the transcriptional
repressor McbR [15]. This strongly indicates that McbR is
involved in the observed regulation.

Discussion
In this report, we describe the identification and validation of a set of genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of sulphate in Corynebacterium glutamicum, including
the up to now unknown genes cysX, cysY, cysZ, and fpr2.
Initial comparison of the genetic equipment for the assimilatory reduction of sulphate indicated that C. glutamicum
possesses a set of genes similar to that known from E. coli
[1], with exception of cysC (encoding APS kinase) and cysJ
(encoding the flavoprotein subunit of sulphite reductase).
On the other hand, genes typical for B. subtilis like sat [3],
ylnF [7], and cysP [3] could not be found in C. glutamicum.
Despite several similarities, the pathway present in C.
glutamicum displays several features that distinguish it
from that described for E. coli, based on the obtained data
(Fig. 7):
Uptake of sulphate is most likely mediated by a novel type
of permease, CysZ, instead of the ABC-type transporter
Sbp CysPTWA known from E. coli [24,25]. Although not

proven by biochemical data, the observed growth deficits
of the ∆cysZ mutant strain together with the bioinformatic
evidence that CysZ is located in the membrane strongly
support this theory. Interestingly, the obtained data also
indicates the existence of at least one low-affinity sulphate
transporter and one or more transporter(s) for the uptake
of the other inorganic sulphur compounds (like
thiosulphate) which are not clustered with the other cys
genes in C. glutamicum.
Strong evidence also exists that the activation of sulphate
and the subsequent reduction to sulphite is performed in
only two steps in C. glutamicum: Like cysH from M.
tuberculosis [2], the heterologous expression of cysH from

C. glutamicum can complement E. coli cysH- as well as cysCmutants. This and the missing of a homologue of APS
kinase clearly indicate that CysH acts as APS reductase in
C. glutamicum, corroborating the prediction made by Lee
[26].
The final step, the reduction of sulphite to sulphide seems
to differ the most from the situation found in E. coli and
B. subtilis, albeit this hypothesis is backed only by circumstantial evidence: CysI from C. glutamicum and the
potential homologues in the other Actinomycetales share
the highest degree of similarity to ferredoxin-dependent
nitrite and sulphite reductases found in plants and
cyanobacteria. Together with the presence of Fpr and

CysX, this leads to the hypothesis that electrons are transferred from NADPH+H+ via Fpr2 and CysX to CysI to
reduce sulphite, similar to the pathway used in non-photosynthetic plant tissues [22]. Unfortunately, this hypothesis could not be proven conclusively with the used
genetic methods alone. The loss of CysX clearly affected
growth on all oxidised inorganic sulphur compounds, but
the exact function cannot be inferred from this analysis. In
case of Fpr2, the phenotypical evidence is even weaker as
a mutant lacking Fpr2 is almost unaffected in the utilisation of sulphate and sulphite, except for a slightly
increased lag phase. Still, the absence of a clear phenotype
is easily explainable by the presence of a highly similar
paralogous protein, Fpr1, that seems to be essential. The
notion that Fpr2 is indeed involved in the pathway under
study is also supported by the finding that it is co-regulated with the genes of the cys operon and is controlled by
McbR, the global regulator of sulphur metabolism in C.
glutamicum [15].
Based on the phenotype of the deletion mutant, CysY is
also involved in the reduction of sulphite. The weak similarity of CysY to sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase from B.
megaterium (EC 4.99.1.4) [27] indicates an involvement
in the biosynthesis of the siroheme cofactor of sulphite
reductase, but again this assumption cannot be proven
conclusively by genetic analysis alone.
Concerning the pathway as a whole, the data from the
mutational analysis, i.e. the inability of cysH, cysD, and
cysN mutants to utilise sulphite, and the failed heterologous complementation of E. coli cys mutants, suggest that

the enzymes might form a multi-enzyme complex in C.
glutamicum.
By analysing the mRNA levels of the eight clustered genes,
it could be proven that cysIXHDNYZ constitute one single
transcription unit. This unit seems to be co-regulated with
fpr2, as expression of both was found to be strongly influenced to the same extent by the presence of most inorganic sulphur sources and L-cysteine.
The observed reduction of the mRNA levels of the eight
genes under study in presence of various sulphur sources
is reminiscent of the regulation described for E. coli [1]
with exception for thiosulphate which also causes a strong
anti-induction in E. coli. For C. glutamicum, it remains to
be determined if the observed regulation is an anti-activation, as in E. coli, or a repression of a sulphur-starvation
response. Based on the gathered data, the latter appears to
be more likely, as cysI has been shown to be regulated by
McbR, the global repressor of sulphur metabolism [28].
Mapping of the potential promoters of cysI and fpr2
revealed that both overlap with potential binding-sites of
this master regulator [15], which corroborates the finding
of Rey et al. that the transcription of the genes of the
cluster is increased in a ∆mcbR mutant [15]. This strongly
suggests that the observed regulation is at least in part due
to the action of McbR. This hypothesis is further backed
by the finding that McbR was found to be conserved in all
completely sequenced Corynebacteriaceae [29] which is in
accordance with the high degree of conservation of the
cluster in C. glutamicum, C. efficiens, and C. jeikeium. Other
candidates that might be involved in the regulation of the
cluster are two genes under McbR-control, cg0012 and
cg0156. The corresponding proteins both belong to the
ROK/NagC-type family of regulators [29] and cg0012 has
recently been proven to be involved in the metabolism of
sulphur as it encodes the sulphate-inhibited activator of
sulphonate utilisation, SsuR [30]. Therefore, cg0156 is a

Page 13 of 18

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:121

interesting candidate encoding a possible regulatory protein that should be characterised in a future study.
Although the regulatory protein(s) involved are not yet
known, the regulatory network has been demonstrated to
act extremely sensitive, as an external sulphate concentration of only 100 µM already leads to a strong reduction of
the mRNA levels of the fpr2 and cys genes by almost 1000fold. This might indicate that the cell needs to strictly control the amounts of reduced sulphur, which is plausible as
most of these compounds are toxic.
An interesting finding was the high degree of conservation
among cys gene clusters in different members of the Actinomycetales. With exception of several pathogens and
commensals. As the pathway described for C. glutamicum
in this study seems to be present, with slight deviations, in
at least 11 other species, it stands to argue that the findings
for one member of this order can be easily transferred to
other members. As C. glutamicum is one of the few nonpathogenic species of the Actinomycetales, and the genes,
with exception of fpr, are present in only one copy, this
bacterium is well suited to study this important pathway
more closely, e.g. on the biochemical level.

Conclusion
Based on sequence similarity, comparative genomics, and
subsequent mutational analysis, we were able to identify
a cluster of eight genes involved in assimilatory sulphate
reduction. The obtained data supports a conclusive model
for this pathway in C. glutamicum which differs considerably from those described for E. coli and B. subtilis,
although further biochemical studies are necessary to
prove the suggested functions. By using comparative
genomics, we could gather strong evidence that the pathway described here might be present in at least 11 other
members of the actinomycetes, thus distinguishing this
group from the Gram-negative and low-GC Gram-positive
bacteria in this metabolic function.
Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the eight genes
under study are strongly regulated by the presence of
either substrates and products of this pathway. Although
reminiscent of the regulation described for E. coli, mapping of the transcription start points revealed that the C.
glutamicum gene cluster might be controlled by repression
of transcription rather than by anti-activation.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture media
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 4. E. coli strains carrying plasmids were routinely grown on solid Antibiotic Medium No. 3 (PA)
(Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) at 37°C. C. glutamicum strains
were grown on solid brain-heart broth (BH) (VWR Inter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/121

national, Darmstadt, Germany) at 30°C. Auxanography
on solid medium was performed using a minimal
medium (MMS), containing only trace amounts of
inorganic sulphur. MMS is composed of 5% glucose, 150
mM NH4C1, 50 mM urea, 6 mM K2HP04, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
70 µM FeCl2, 50 µM MnCl2, 70 µM CaCl2, 7.5 µM ZnCl2,
1 µM CuCl2, 0.1 µM, NiCl2, 500 µg/l thiamine, and 50 µg/
l biotin, for the growth test different sulphur sources were
added at 2 mM concentration (calculated for sulphur).
For solidification, 16 g agarose were added per litre MMS.
For growth tests in liquid medium, a modified version of
MME [31], called MMES, was used, consisting of 2.5%
glucose, 17 mM NaNH4HP04, 1 mM MgCl2, 60 mM
K2HP04, 10 mM citric acid, 37.5 µM FeCl2, 50 µM MnCl2,
67.5 µM CaCl2, 7.5 µM ZnCl2, 1 µM CuCl2, 0.1 µM,
NiC12, 500 µg/l thiamine, and 50 µg/l biotin, with addition of different sulphur sources at varying
concentrations.
Sulphur sources used were sodium sulphate (Na2S04),
sodium sulphite (Na2SO3), sodium thiosulphate
(Na2S2O3), sodium sulphide (Na2S), and L-cysteine.
Antibiotics used for selection of plasmids and strains were
nalidixic acid (50 µg/ml for corynebacteria) and kanamycin (50 µg/ml for E. coli, 25 µg/ml for corynebacteria).
DNA isolation, transfer and manipulation
Standard procedures were employed for molecular cloning and transformation of E. coli DH5α, as well as for electrophoresis [32]. Transformation of C. glutamicum was
performed by electroporation using the methods of Tauch
et al. [33].
Construction of plasmids
Plasmids pCR016d to pCR025d were constructed using
the gene splicing by overlap extension (gene-SOEing)
method described by Horton et al. [34], the PCR primers
used are listed in the supplementary Table S1 [see Additional file 1]. The primary products were amplified using
Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
resulting products were purified using the PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and used as templates for the second round of PCR. The final products
were digested with restriction enzymes corresponding to
the cleavage sites introduced via PCR and ligated into
appropriately digested pK18mobsacB. The ligation mixture
was used to transform E. coli DH5αMCR, the transformants were selected on PA plates containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin and 40 mg/l X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylβ-D-galactopyranoside).

Plasmids for complementation experiments were created
by amplifying the gene of interest via PCR. The resulting

Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:121

constructs were cleaved using restriction sites added by
the PCR primers and then ligated into plasmid pZ8-l, cut
with the corresponding enzymes. The ligation mixture
was used for transformation of E. coli DH5αMCR, the
transformants were selected on PA plates containing 50
µg/ml kanamycin.
Site-specific gene deletion
Site-specific gene deletion was performed using the nonreplicable integration vector pK18mobsacB which allows
for marker-free deletion of the target gene [35]. The plasmids pCR018d to pCR025d were transferred into the C.
glutamicum wild-type strain (ATCC 13032) by electroporation [33]. Tests for first and second cross-over were performed as described previously [8].
Identification of a cysI transposon mutant
Using a cloned copy of the IS6100 mobile element [36], a
transposon mutant library was constructed. The mutants
were gained with a modified approach that uses electrotransfer of the IS6100-based transposon vector pAT6100
into the C. glutamicum host cells. Subsequent phenotypic
screening of the transposon library for cystein-auxotrophic mutants was applied, and the transposon integration loci of these mutants were determined by a plasmid
rescue technique and subsequent sequence similarity
analysis [37].
Relative quantification of mRNA levels using real-time RTPCR
Bacterial cell cultures were grown to the early logarithmic
phase (o.D.600 between 8 to 12) in MMS with 250 µM Lcysteine as sulphur source. Incubation took place in an
Innova 4430 orbital shaker (New Brunswick, N J) at 300
rpm, using 25 ml medium in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask.

For each experiment, 5*109 cells were pelletised by centrifugation, washed twice with MMS without added sulphur source (preheated to 30°C) and resuspended in 5 ml
MMS. To this culture the sulphur source to be analysed
was added at varying concentrations and incubated for an
additional 30 min.
For RNA isolation, about 109 cells per culture were harvested by 15 sec centrifugation at 16,000 g, followed by
immediate removal of the supernatant and freezing of the
pellet in liquid nitrogen. Preparation of total RNA from C.
glutamicum cells was performed as described by Hüser et
al. [38].
Primers for real-time RT-PCR were constructed to amplify
intergenic regions of about 150 bp length of the genes to
be analysed, designated as *_lc1/2 [see Additional file 1].
The primers were designed using the Primer Designer 4.2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/121

software (Sci Ed Software, Durham, NC) and were purchased from SIGMA-ARK (Darmstadt, Germany).
All real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed using a
LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with the
QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). PCR mixes were set up and PCR was performed as described by Koch et al. [39]. All measurements
were performed for two biological replicates per condition tested and with two technical replicates per biological
replicate. The amounts of the mRNAs of the genes of the
cluster were normalised on total RNA and the relative
change in transcription rate was determined as 2-∆CP with
∆CP equal to the difference of the measured crossing
points for the test and the control condition.
Determination of transcriptional starts with the RACE
method
Total RNA was isolated from a C. glutamicum wild-type
culture grown in MMS medium and subjected to sulphur
starvation as described above. Primers binding
downstream of the annotated translational starts of the
cysI and fpr2 genes (*SP1-3 in Table 5) along with 1.5 µg
of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was
then modified and amplified using the 5'/3' RACE kit
(Roche Diagnostics) according to the supplier's protocol.
The obtained PCR products were cloned into the pCRBlunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
and transferred into E. coli DH10B cells [40]. At least four
different clones per gene were selected for plasmid preparation and DNA sequencing (IIT Biotech, Bielefeld,
Germany).
Real-time monitoring of cell growth using nephelometry
All strains to be tested (the wild-type strain and different
mutants) were grown overnight in liquid BH medium in
an Innova 4430 orbital shaker (New Brunswick, NJ) at
300 rpm. One ml of an o/n culture was pelletised, washed
once with liquid MMES and transferred into a 100 ml
Erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml fresh, preheated MMES
with addition of 500 µM L-cysteine as sulphur source.
After o/n incubation in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm, one
ml of the culture was again washed and transferred into
10 ml MMES as described above. These cultures were incubated for 6 hours in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm.

For real-time growth monitoring, 1 ml of each culture was
pelletised and washed twice with MMES. For each test
condition, 1 ml MMES with addition of a sulphur source
at varying concentrations was inoculated with washed
cells of the strain to be tested for a final o.D.600 of 0.01. Per
test condition, 6 wells of a 96-well Cellstar suspension
culture plate (Greiner Bio-One, Essen, Germany) were
filled with 100 µl inoculated MMES per well. The plates
were sealed with Breathe-Easy membrane (Diversified

Biotech, Boston, MA) and growth was measured in a
microplate nephelometer (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany). For these measurements, the parameters
selected were: Incubation at 30°C, 50% laser intensity,
gain of 86, 2.5 mm laser focus point, 900 sec orbital shaking with 3 mm shaking width, and measurement after
each cycle with 0.2 sec measurement time per well, 0.0 sec
positioning delay.

Bioinformatic analysis
Sequence similarity-based searches with nucleotide and
protein sequences were performed using BLAST, the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool [42] against the UniProt
database [41]. Searches using profile Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) from the PFAM database [43] were done
using the HMMer software package. Transmembrane
domains were searched for using the TMHMM software
[44] while for the detection of signal peptides SignalP [45]
was used. Multiple alignments were done using DIALIGN
2 [46]. Search for conserved gene clusters was performed
using the GECKO software [19] and TheSEED [20].
