Abstract
Background: Costs of adaptation play an important role in host-parasite coevolution. For
parasites, evolving the ability to circumvent host resistance may trade off with subsequent growth
or transmission. Such costs of virulence (sensu plant pathology) limit the spread of all-infectious
genotypes and thus facilitate the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in both host and parasite.
We investigated costs of three virulence factors in Puccinia striiformis f.sp.tritici, a fungal pathogen of
wheat (Triticum aestivum).
Results: In pairwise competition experiments, we compared the fitness of near-isogenic genotypes
that differed by a single virulence factor. Two virulence factors (vir4, vir6) imposed substantial
fitness costs in the absence of the corresponding resistance genes. In contrast, the vir9 virulence
factor conferred a strong competitive advantage to several isolates, and this for different host
cultivars and growing seasons. In part, the experimentally derived fitness costs and benefits are
consistent with frequency changes of these virulence factors in the French pathogen population.
Conclusion: Our results illustrate the variation in the evolutionary trajectories of virulence
mutations and the potential role of compensatory mutations. Anticipation of such variable
evolutionary outcomes represents a major challenge for plant breeding strategies. More generally,
we believe that agro-patho-systems can provide valuable insight in (co)evolutionary processes in
host-parasite systems.

Background
Central to many concepts in evolutionary biology is the
idea that adaptation is not cost-free [1,2]. Costs arise if
adaptation in one trait is opposed by a negative correlated
response to another trait. Such trade-offs between fitness
components can influence life-history evolution, ecologi-

cal specialisation and more generally, the maintenance of
genetic diversity [3].
Costs of adaptation also play an important role in hostparasite coevolution. In the host, costs of resistance refer
to trade-offs between resistance and other fitness-relevant

traits, conferring a selective disadvantage to resistant genotypes in the absence of the parasite. The corresponding
costs in the parasite, referred to as 'costs of virulence' in
the plant-pathogen literature, are trade-offs between the
capacity to establish an infection and other parasite characters (e.g., within-host growth, production of transmission stages [4]). These costs are considered major
ingredients of the coevolutionary process because they
can prevent the spread to fixation of all-resistant host or
all-infectious parasite genotypes and thereby preserve
genetic diversity in both host and parasite populations [58].
While costs of resistance have been investigated in various
host-parasite systems (plant: [9,10]; (cyano)bacteria:
[11,12]; protozoa: [13]; drosophila: [14]), still little is
known about costs of virulence and their role in shaping
genetic structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Historically, this issue has first been addressed in plant-pathogen
interactions [15,16]. Here, virulence refers to the ability of
the pathogen to circumvent host resistance and establish
an infection. This ability often arises from mutational loss
of function of genes that would otherwise elicit a defense
reaction of the host [17]. However, this advantage of malfunctioning can turn into a disadvantage if these genes are
essential for subsequent development of infection. With
the advent of molecular techniques, investigation of the
precise genetic and physiological basis of costs of virulence has become possible. Induced mutagenesis of genes
implicated in plant-pathogen recognition revealed that at
least some of these genes are involved in within-host replication, pathogenicity or spore production [18-20]. Thus,
loss of function of these genes will allow infection, but
also impose a straightforward cost for subsequent development.
Given their intrinsic fitness costs, selection should eliminate unnecessary virulence genes from the pathogen population and favour pathotypes with particular virulence
genes that match the resistance structure of the host population [21]. Thus, in classical models of plant-pathogen
coevolution, changes in the frequencies of resistance and
virulence genes are essentially determined by the fitness
trade-offs associated with these genes [6,15]. While more
recent theoretical developments balance the importance
of cost with other biological features [22,23], empirical
and experimental evidence of these basic theoretical concepts is still scant. Natural populations of various pathogens often harbour genotypes carrying different numbers
of virulence alleles. For pathogens of crop plants, withdrawal of a particular cultivar sometimes leads to the subsequent decrease in frequency of the genotypes carrying
the corresponding virulence allele [24,25], consistent
with the idea of selection against unnecessary and costly
virulence alleles. In some cases, molecular analysis sug-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/26

gests that costs of virulence contribute to the maintenance
of genetic polymorphism in the pathogen [26]; in yet
other cases, elimination of the function of virulence genes
seems to be cost-free, suggesting that fitness costs are not
universal and depend on the gene or the pathogen considered.
Only few experimental studies compared the relative fitness of naturally occurring pathogen genotypes that carry
different numbers of virulence alleles. Thrall and Burdon
[27] detected a negative correlation between virulence and
spore production for the plant pathogen Melampsora lini.
This trade-off may explain why relatively avirulent strains
dominated susceptible host populations. Furthermore,
for different plant-pathogen systems, competition experiments compared pathogen genotypes with different numbers of virulence alleles. Some of these studies
demonstrated a selective advantage of simpler over complex genotypes, at least in the greenhouse [[19,27,28], but
see [29]]. Typically, however, these experiments did not
control for the genetic background of the competing
strains and it is possible that fitness differences were
caused by other genes [30].
Here, we investigated costs of virulence in the yellow rust
fungus, Puccinia striiformis f.sp.tritici (PST), one of the
most damaging wheat pathogens worldwide [31]. This
clonally reproducing pathogen rapidly evolves through
stepwise mutational acquisition of new virulences
[32,33], and the resulting arms race between plant breeders and the pathogen is characterised by frequent and
rapid resistance breakdowns [34]. In North-Western
Europe, the fitness advantage of being able to grow on a
resistant cultivar is so strong that a new virulent mutant
pathotype can replace an existing dominant pathotype
within 2–3 years [33,35]. Costs of virulence potentially
slow down resistance breakdowns or at least limit the
severity of epidemics. Therefore knowledge of these costs
can help plant breeders to better understand evolutionary
change in the pathogen and to develop more efficient
strategies of resistance management.
We performed competition experiments using pathogen
genotypes that differed by a single virulence gene not
needed for infection. This is analogous to measuring costs
of resistance in the absence of the parasite [4,10]. If the
virulence gene is costly, its carriers should be at a competitive disadvantage. We tested this hypothesis for different
naturally occurring virulence genes. The specific novelty
of this study is that we explicitly accounted for genetic
background by competing genotypes with identical (or
nearly so) profiles of molecular markers (AFLP). Because
this pathogen is clonal, identical profiles indicate very
close phylogenetic relationships. Further, competition
assays were carried out both in the climatic chamber and

in the field, on different wheat cultivars and in different
years. We confront our results with changes in the frequencies of these virulence factors in natural populations
over the past 20 years [34], and with changes in aggressiveness in a collection of isolates from this period.

vir9 pathotype
In a climate chamber assay, we competed two independent pairs (A, B, see Table 1) of a virulent and an avirulent
isolate, initially in a 50:50 mix. For pair A, the relative frequency of the isolate (i5) with the additional virulence
allele decreased by 50% over the course of five infection
cycles, and this on both host cultivars (Figure 1). For pair
B, deviations from the 50:50 ratio were less pronounced
and differed between host cultivars (pair × host cultivar ×
time interaction: F4,16 = 3.67, p = 0.0263; repeated measure ANOVA).

Results
1. Competition experiments
The 16 isolates used in these experiments were collected
from naturally infected fields in France between 1989 and
1997. Competition experiments were carried out between
pairs of fungal isolates with identical AFLP marker profiles
(see methods). These isolates also had identical virulence
gene profiles, except that one of the two isolates carried
one additional virulence gene (Table 1). The isolate with
the additional virulence gene will be referred to as 'virulent' (vir), the one without it as 'avirulent' (Avir). By definition, virulent isolates are fully infective (fitness = 1) on
resistant plants, whereas avirulent isolates cannot infect
these plants (fitness = 0). Remember that 'virulent' here is
used in the plant pathology sense, i.e., it refers to the
capacity to infect a host; to describe the damage done to
the host, we use the term 'aggressiveness' [36]. In the
present experiments, host varieties were chosen such that
both types of isolates were infectious, that is, the additional virulence gene was redundant with respect to infectivity of the isolate and thus potentially costly. We tested
the effects of three virulence genes vir9, vir6 and vir4 in
field experiments, with an additional focus on vir9 in controlled conditions.

In field competition assays, the relative frequencies of
avirulent and virulent isolates at the end of the growing season varied strongly among four independent pairs (A, B,
C, D; Figure 2a, Table 2). Starting from an initial 50:50
ratio, the relative frequency of the virulent isolate (i5) in
pair A decreased significantly by about 50%, just like in
the greenhouse assay. In contrast, virulent isolates (i6, i7,
i8) doubled in frequency in the three other pairs (B, C, D).
With one exception (pair B, 2005, on the Récital cultivar),
these patterns were consistent over growing seasons
(2005, 2006) and host plant cultivars (Récital, Thésée)
(Table 3). Thus, in one case (i5), the isolate with the additional virulence was less competitive than its isogenic
counterpart; in the three other cases, it was more competitive (i6, i7, i8). The selective advantage or disadvantage of
these virulent isolates was in the order of 15–20%.

Competitive success of vir9 isolates in the climate chamber
Competitive success of vir9 isolates in the climate
chamber experiment. Mean (± S.E.) frequencies of vir9
isolates relative to avir9 isolates over the course of 5 pathogen generations in pairwise competition experiments. Two A
vir/vir pairs (A, B) were competed on two host cultivars
(Thésée, Récital). Each point represents the mean and S.E. calculated over 2 independent replicates.

With two additional competition pairs (E, F) we were able
to compare all possible A vir/vir combinations between
the i1, i2, i5 and i6 isolates. Analysis of this set of combinations (pairs A, B, E, F) revealed a significant effect of virulence identity (i5 vs. i6; F1,8 = 142.61, p = < 0.0001), but
no significant interaction between avirulence and virulence identity (F1,8 = 0.05, p = 0.832). That is, the i5 isolate was less competitive and the i6 more competitive,
regardless of the identity of the avirulent counterpart in
the mix.
vir4 and vir6 pathotypes
For the vir4 and vir6 pathotypes, four pairs of avirulent and
virulent isolates were tested (Pairs G-J, Table 2) under field

conditions. For all virulent isolates, we observed a significant decrease in the frequency (vir4: t7 = 12.76, p < 0.0001;
vir6: t5 = 5.19, p = 0.0035) (Figure 2b, Table 2). Typically,
their relative frequencies dropped from initially 50% to
around 20–30% within a growing season, although this
effect varied to some extent between years (vir4: year × cultivar interaction: F1,6 = 17.4, p = 0.0059) and host cultivars
(vir6: year × pair interaction: F1,8 = 7.44, p = 0.0260). Thus,
in all four pairs tested, the isolate with the additional virulence was substantially less competitive, with a selective
disadvantage of 17–24%.
2. Sporulation test and genetic analysis of the vir9
pathotype
We further investigated temporal changes in the genetic
composition of the French population for the vir9 pathotype. To this end, we characterised AFLP profiles and
measured aggressiveness of 33 vir9 isolates collected
between 1989 and 1997. Despite thorough screening of
39 primer combinations, no variation in the neutral
markers was detected, indicating that these isolates all
belonged to the same clonal line of descent. In contrast,
isolates differed significantly in their aggressiveness, as
measured by the infection type (IT) index (F32,71 = 8.39, p
= < 0.0001; Figure 3). This visual classification index was
highly correlated with quantitative measurements of
sporulation rate (r = 0.75, n = 185, p = < 0.0001), showing
an up to 5-fold difference in sporulation rate between isolates. After the resistance breakdown of the Yr9 cultivar in
1989, a first epidemic occurred between 1989 and 1991,
a second between 1993 and 1997. In the collection, the
variance in IT significantly decreased between the first and
the second epidemic period (F1,31 = 5.1880, p = 0.0298 in

Based on a logistic regression, Analysis of Deviance tested for effects
of pair (Avir/vir), host cultivar and year on final frequencies of vir9
isolates. Analogous to Analysis of Variance, mean deviances (MD =
2.log-likelihood ratio/DF) were used to calculate quasi-F values. The
denominator (denm.) column indicates the error terms used for the
F-tests; where necessary, linear combinations of different model
factors were made [69]. The DF column indicates the numerator and
denominator degrees of freedom. All factors were considered as
random effects. Model fitting was analogous to SAS-type II model
fitting [68].

O'Brien), with a concomitant 9% increase in the mean IT
index. We found a considerably higher frequency of heavily sporulating isolates (IT index > 7) during the second
epidemic (χ2 (1) = 4.04, p = 0.044; Figure 3). These
changes suggest a response to natural selection in aggressiveness during the two epidemics. Finally, note the link
between performance in the competition assays and
sporulation rate: the less competitive i5 isolate had a
much lower sporulation rate (0.17 ± 0.08 mg spores/chlorose) than the three more competitive isolates (i6, i7, i8:
0.37–0.53; see also Figure 3).

Discussion
Evidence for costs of virulence
For five of the 8 virulent isolates tested, our experiments
demonstrated a substantial cost of carrying an additional
virulence gene, and this for different genes and different
genetic backgrounds of the same gene. Despite some variation between years and cultivars, these costs appear to
be quite robust and repeatable. In particular, the additional tests (pairs E, F) showed that the low performance
of the virulent isolates was independent of the identity of
the avirulent competitor.

Genetic variation in fitness detected in the laboratory does
not always reflect the degree of variation expressed under
field conditions. Under natural conditions, stress can
increase the genetic variance in fitness [37], while confounding environmental effects might limit its detection
[38]. Here, the field assays revealed even stronger fitness
differences between the competing isolates (Figure 2). The
selection coefficients (13%–22%) are similar to those
from laboratory studies on other organisms [39-41] and
indicate potentially strong selection against these viru-

lence genes, if redundant. The most likely cause of this
competitive disadvantage is a reduction in the ability to
develop on the host and produce spores. This type of cost
has been detected in other pathogens [39-43] and at least
for the vir9 virulence gene, we have direct evidence that
costs are due to low sporulation.
Compatibility with epidemiological history of natural PST
populations
In agricultural host-parasite arms races, farmers typically
plant one or a few host cultivars over large geographic
areas. This imposes strong, uniform selection on the pathogen to evolve the ability to attack these host genotypes.
In the case of PST, the necessary virulence genes to overcome resistance can rapidly arise through mutation in
large clonal populations. Once a resistance breakdown
has occurred, cultivars are withdrawn and replaced by new
resistant cultivars, developed by plant breeders. Indeed,
one of the to date most convincing examples of such a
semi-natural coevolutionary arms race has been demonstrated for the PST-wheat system [34], and it involves the
virulence genes (vir4, vir6, vir9) studied in our experiments. With the replacement of susceptible cultivars, the
vir6 and vir9 genes have become redundant at some point
during the past 15 years (vir4 has always been redundant).
Thus, if these genes impose fitness costs, they should have
decreased in frequency in natural pathogen populations[21].

For the vir6 virulence gene, this seems to be the case. The
competition experiment revealed a strong selective disadvantage of the virulent vir6 isolates, and this is consistent
with three declines in the frequency of the vir6 gene, when
cultivars carrying the corresponding resistance gene (Yr6)
were retracted [34]. In contrast, the fitness costs of the vir4
virulence gene detected in the competition experiment
does not match with its epidemiological history. The vir4
gene appeared in Europe already more than 20 years
ago[34,44] and all contemporary pathotypes carry it.
Interestingly, the majority of plant varieties used in France
in the past 30 years did not carry the corresponding Yr4
resistance gene and thus the vir4 gene must have been
mostly redundant. Given the clonal evolution of PST, it is
possible that this ancestral vir4 gene has spread to fixation
by hitch-hiking with new, selectively advantageous virulence genes. Originally, the vir4 gene may have immigrated from the UK, where the Yr4 resistance gene was
present in several cultivars in the past (e.g., Maris Beacon,
Rapier, Avalon or Brimstone [45-47]). In fact, the Yr4 has
also been postulated for certain Danish wheat cultivars
[48]. This suggests that the vir4 gene may even have a
selective advantage at a larger, European scale and that
simple hitch-hiking is not the only explanation for its
presence in the French population. It further implies that
migration at larger geographical scales, such as that

between the UK and continental Europe [33,35], can
influence local pathogen population structure and evolution.
For the vir9 gene, the story is more complex. After the
resistance breakdowns in 1989 and 1994 and subsequent
withdrawal of the susceptible cultivars, vir9 did not
decrease in frequency, and currently all known PST pathotypes are fixed for this redundant virulence gene [48]. In
part, this can be explained by its hitch-hiking with a newly
arisen virulence gene (vir17, [34,35]), just like in the case
of the vir4 gene. Moreover, we detected a fitness cost only
for one vir9 isolate, while the other three isolates were
even more competitive than their avirulent counterparts
not carrying the vir9 gene. Our results further indicate that
these differences are due to variation in aggressiveness and
sporulation rates. The three successful isolates sporulate at
high rates, while the less competitive one is among the
least aggressive isolates of the vir9 collection.
Why is the vir9 gene costly in some isolates, but not in
others? The answer may lie either in the gene itself or in its
genetic background. First, in our four virulent isolates, the
same vir9 virulence phenotype may represent different
mutations, and only one imposes a fitness cost. Typically,
virulence genes arise from mutations disrupting some
metabolic function that would otherwise elicit a resistance
reaction. It is conceivable that different mutations can
bring about such modifications, and possibly not all of
them come at a fitness cost [43]. Alternatively, costs of virulence may have been balanced by compensatory mutations. Compensation may occur directly in the gene(s)
responsable for the loss of function, but also indirectly in
genes determining pathogen aggressiveness. Indeed,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/26

aggressiveness is known to have a multigenic basis [49],
thus offering multiple targets for compensatory mutations. If fitness effects are sufficiently large and selection
efficient, this may even bring about a net positive effect
and overcompensation of the cost of virulence. The history of the vir9 gene is compatible with such a scenario.
Resistance breakdown of the Yr9 gene in England
occurred already two years before highly aggressive vir9
variants appeared in France. Breakdowns are usually
accompanied by massive PST epidemics, with exponential
population growth and up to 10 infection cycles per growing season. This may have provided sufficient time for
compensatory mutations to arise in the vir9 background
and to be picked up by natural selection. Indeed, for the
period in question, a signature of this process can be seen
by the increase of the frequency of highly aggressive isolates in the vir9 spore collection. So far, cost-compensation has been described for resistance to antibiotics[50] or
insecticides [51]. If our interpretations are correct, this
study is one of the first to suggest the compensation of
costs of virulence in natural populations of a pathogen.
Similar ideas about the progressive evolution of the fitness of new pathotypes of cereal rusts date back to the
1970s. Based on empirical and experimental data, it was
suggested that new phenotypes were unable to spread
because of their low aggressiveness [52,53] and that adaptation to quantitative host resistance occurred gradually
through polygenic changes [54].
Interestingly, we did not detect variation in neutral genetic
markers among the isolates in the collection, despite the
large number of primer combinations screened. As these
isolates share the same clonal background, variation in
both virulence and aggressiveness must have arisen within
a relatively short time span. Indeed, Lande and Barrowclough [55] showed that in very large populations, heritable variation in quantitative traits can established by
spontaneous mutation without leaving a trace in neutral
genetic markers. Clearly, this rapid evolutionary change
sets limits to our "all-else-being-equal" approach in the
competition experiments, aiming at the comparison of
isogenic isolates that differ only in the virulence gene in
question.

Conclusion
First, our study demonstrates substantial fitness costs of
single virulence genes on different host varieties under
field conditions. In part, these costs explain changes in the
genetic composition of natural PST populations, consistent with van der Plank's hypothesis of selection against
redundant virulence genes [21]. Second, however, we also
found that redundant virulence genes are not automatically selected against, either because they do not have a fitness cost or because costs are compensated. Regardless of
the precise mechanism, one of our main conclusions is

Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:26

that the fate of a particular virulence mutation may not be
independent of its genetic background. This is particularly
relevant for clonal pathogens, such as PST, where the
whole genome is a single linkage group exposed to natural
selection. Selection then perceives the sum of the costs of
the different virulence genes carried by a given genotype
and that of all other genes determining growth and transmission. Indeed, additional virulences may have more
deleterious effects in genetic backgrounds that already
carry other virulence genes [40,42,56] as it was the case in
our study. The very different outcomes for the three virulence genes studied here indicate strong variation in the
evolutionary trajectories of virulence mutations; this also
stresses the need for more refined theoretical models to
predict these trajectories.
Third, our results have implications for plant breeding
strategies. Current large-scale programs employ inter-specific crosses and molecular engineering to develop resistance genes imposing a high cost of virulence for
pathogens that overcome this resistance. This handicap
may prevent the spread of such pathogen genotypes and
thus increase the durability of resistance [57]. Obviously,
this approach critically hinges on the consistency and
durability of costs of virulence. Our experiments indicate
that costs can be quite consistent, at least for certain virulence genes. However, durability of costs of virulence can
be expected to be inversely proportional to the strength of
selection imposed on the pathogen to compensate these
costs. We suspect that that compensation may occur
rather rapidly, by hitch-hiking processes or by efficient
selection on multigenic traits. Thus, if demonstrating the
cost of virulence is already complicated, predicting its
durability may be even more difficult.
Finally, it is often argued that agro-patho-systems are too
artificial or too simple to be comparable to natural hostparasite systems. Here, we demonstrated that the seemingly straightforward genetic architecture of the cultivated
host produces complex patterns of genetic change in its
natural opponent. These evolutionary changes can be
investigated experimentally in real-time (several pathogen
generations) and they remain traceable over larger time
scales in the production areas (years or decades). We
therefore believe that the study of these systems can provide valuable general insights in the costs and consequences of adaptation in host-parasite systems.

Methods
Species description
Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (order Uredinales, class Basidiomycetes) is strongly wheat-specific (Triticum aestivum and
T. turgidum). There is no known alternate host on which
the sexual cycle could be completed and thus fungal
reproduction is essentially asexual. Fungal mycelia systemically grow within leaf nervures (stripes); the asexual

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/26

part of the life cycle is completed within only 14 days,
resulting in repeated bursts of sporulating lesions releasing urediospores that infect neighbouring plants. Typically, these clonal fungal populations experience strong
between-season bottlenecks every season, and from low
initial genetic diversity, new virulence mutations arise
during seasonal epidemics. In Europe, resistance breakdown usually takes only 3–4 years [35]. Even if treated the
yield loss can reach 80% [58]. To date, a complete phylogeny of this species is still lacking, but introductions of new
strains occur worldwide and can be attributed to both
long distance wind dispersal and accidental human contamination.
Competition experiments
We used 16 isolates collected as uredospores from
infected fields in the North of France, between 1989 and
1997 (Table 1), and stored in liquid nitrogen. Virulence
gene profiles were characterised on European and World
differential cultivars, using Johnson et al.'s method [59].
We used 39 AFLP primer combinations to characterise
phylogenetic relationships among the isolates [see Additional file 1]. Thus, competing pairs of virulent and avirulent isolates of the vir9 and vir6 pathotypes represented
indistinguishable AFLP genotypes; for the vir4 pathotype,
competing isolates differed by four AFLP bands and may
therefore carry other mutations in addition to the virulence for Yr4.

We tested 8 virulent isolates, four carrying the vir9 virulence gene and two with the vir4 and vir6 virulence genes,
respectively. Each virulent isolate was paired with an avirulent isolate as a competitor (Pairs A-J, Table 1). Most
pairs were competed on two host cultivars and in two
growing seasons (2005, 2006) under field conditions.
Pairs A and B were also tested under climate chamber conditions. We established two independent replicates per
pair, year and host cultivar.
Preparation of inocula
To produce fresh inocula for the experiments, uredospores were taken out of the liquid nitrogen, heat
shocked (40°C, 15 min) and used to inoculate 7-day-old
seedlings of the susceptible cultivar Victo. Inoculated
plants were incubated in a dew chamber at 8°C for 16 h
in the dark to facilitate infection ([60] and then transferred to the greenhouse (day: 16 h, 350 μE·m-2·s-1,
17°C; night: 8 h, 14°C). Eighteen days after inoculation,
spores were collected with a vacuum collector, dried in a
desiccator for 3 days at 4°C and stored in microtubes at 80°C prior to the experiments.
Climate chamber experiment (Pairs A and B, vir9
virulence gene)
For each replicate, a 50:50 mixture of 20 mg uredospores
of the virulent and avirulent isolate was inoculated on
Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:26

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/26

approx. 400 7-day-old seedlings of a given host cultivar.
We used two susceptible wheat varieties, Thésée (carrying
the Yr2 resistance gene) and Récital (Yr6) [61]. We chose
these cultivars because of their high susceptibility at the
time of the appearance of the vir9 virulence in 1989. After
incubation in a dew chamber at 8°C for 16 h, plants were
placed in a climate chamber (day: 16 h, 350 μE·m-2·s-1,
17°C; night: 8 h, 14°C). Twenty days after inoculation,
spores were collected and used to start a new infection
cycle on the same host cultivar, as described above. We
ran five cycles of competition and preserved a small sample of spores at each cycle to estimate the relative frequencies of the competing isolates.

Estimation of the cost of virulence
We calculated the selective value (s) of the avirulent isolate from a model by Leonard [28], with Ln (qn/(1-qn)) =
Ln (q0/(1-q0)) – n Ln (1-s); q0 is the initial frequency of
the virulent isolate in the mix and qn its final frequency
after n generations and (1-s) is the fitness difference
between the virulent and the avirulent isolate. Following
McGregor and Manners [63], the number of fungal generations n in the field experiments was estimated by fitting
the duration of latent period (p) on the mean yearly temperature (T) at the Grignon site as: p = 28,24exp(-0,06T).
From this, we obtained an estimate of five fungal generations in both years.

Field experiments
Field experiments were conducted during two wheat seasons in 2005 and 2006, at the Grignon Institute in Northern France (48°50'N 1°55'E). A replicate consisted of a 10
× 1.5 m plot, (250 plants/m2) of a given host cultivar.
Experiments were started in late March, at the end of tillering. In the center of the plot, we planted two sporulating
Victo seedlings that had been inoculated with a 50:50 mix
of the two competing isolates, as described above. Preliminary tests showed that sporulation on the Victo seedlings
did not significantly change the 50:50 ratio (data not
shown). At the end of the epidemic (early June), uredospores were harvested and stored at -80°C until further
processing. The absence of infection in surrounding plots
indicated that natural or cross-contamination did not
occur.

Analysis of the collection of vir9 isolates
Of the 33 vir9 isolates analysed here, 11 were collected
early after the first appearance of this pathotype in France
(1989–1991). In 1992, this first epidemic was ended by a
severe drought, and the remaining isolates were collected
during the second epidemic period (1992–1997). The isolates all have the same virulence gene profile, as confirmed by previous analysis using the World and
European differential cultivars as well as by our own tests
using supplementary cultivars [Federationx4Kavkaz (Yr9),
Sleipner (Yr9+), Austerlitz (Yr6+), Early Premium, Anza].
Isolates had been stored at -80°C and fresh uredospores
were prepared as described above.

Frequency assessment
Frequency assessments of the competing isolates followed
the protocol by Lannou et al. (2005). For a given sample,
we used an oil solution of 0.1 mg of the collected uredospores to inoculate five pots, each with 15 seedlings of
a discriminating host cultivar. The cultivars Sleipner (Yr9
resistance gene), Heines Kolben (Yr2, Yr6) and Hybrid 46
(Yr4) were used for experiments with vir9, vir6 and vir4
virulence genes, respectively. On these discriminant cultivars, the virulent isolate develops sporulating lesions,
whereas the avirulent isolate produces non-sporulating
chloroses, indicating the failure of infection. Thus, the
total number of chloroses was counted 7 days and sporulating lesions 14 days after inoculation. The frequency of
the virulent isolate in the sample was taken as the ratio of
sporulating chloroses/total chloroses. Each frequency was
estimated on 400 chloroses on average. The goodness of
the frequency assessment was previously validated for
Heines Kolben and Hybrid 46 [62]. For Sleipner, we controlled the reliability of frequency estimates by the inoculation of different ratios of Avirulent/virulent isolates [100/0;
75/25; 50/50; 25/75 and 0/100, see Additional file 2].

We used AFLP markers to investigate the neutral genetic
diversity among the isolates. Ten combinations of PstI and
MseI primers with two selective nucleotides were used. A
subset of eight isolates was screened with 24 additional
primer combinations with two selective nucleotides. The
four isolates used in the competition experiments were
tested with all 39 AFLP combinations. Genomic DNA
extraction, DNA quantification on agarose gel and AFLP
genotyping are described in detail by Enjalbert et al.
[34,64].
Variation in aggressiveness was measured as follows.
Seedlings of the Clement cultivar were grown in groups of
five plants in 1 dm3 pots in the greenhouse (14°C-8 h
dark period and 17°C-16 h light period). When primary
leaves were fully expanded, pots were exposed to a 16 h
light regime and two pots per isolate were inoculated with
0.2 mg of uredospores, suspended in 300 μl of Soltrol
[60,65]. After incubation in a dark dew chamber for 24 h
at 8°C, seedlings were placed back in the greenhouse. Fifteen days after inoculation, the primary leaf of each seedling was examined visually for the infection type
according to a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (high
sporulation) [66].

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:26

To calibrate the infection type index, we measured the
sporulation rate of 11 isolates, including those from the
competition experiment (i5, i6, i7, i8). Groups of 10 Clement seedlings were grown in 5 cm2 pots, as described
above. At the 2-leaf stage (8 days), seedlings were thinned
to 6 individuals per pot and exposed to a 16 h light
regime. The second leaf from each seedling was removed
and the first leaf attached horizontally, adaxial side up, on
a Plexiglas sheet with plasticine (Ulmann, Paris, France)
[60]. Seedlings from 10 pots were inoculated together in a
settling tower [67], with 5 mg spores of a given isolate (≈
52 spores deposited per cm2). After incubation, seedlings
were kept in a climate chamber, as described above. Eight
days after their opening, we counted the number of
lesions and estimated the inoculated part of the leaf surface estimated (width × length) on two leaves per pot,
from which we calculated the lesion density per cm2. The
pots were then placed individually under plastic jars to
prevent cross-contamination. Uredospores were collected
17 and 22 days after inoculation, dried for 24 h at 5°C
and then weighed. For each pot, we calculated sporulation
rate as the ratio of spore production (mg) over lesion density.
Statistical analyses
Changes in (arcsine-transformed) frequency of virulent
isolates in the climate chamber competition experiment
were analysed by means of a repeated measure ANOVA,
using the MIXED procedure of SAS statistical software [68].
Variation in final frequencies of virulent isolates in the
field competition experiments were analysed by means of
Analysis of Deviance, based on a logistic regression (GENMOD procedure; SAS). Fully factorial statistical models contained the identity of competing pairs (Pair A, B, etc.),
host cultivar and year. In all analyses, frequencies for a
given replicate represented combined values over all pots
and plants of the discriminating cultivar. We further used
t-tests to test whether the final frequency of virulent isolates was significantly different from 0.5 across all replicates and pairs. Frequencies in the 1:1 mixtures at the
beginning of the experiments were not significantly different from 0.5 (not shown). One-way ANOVAs were
employed to compare differences in mean and variance of
infection type among isolates from the two epidemic periods.

For two independent pairs of Avir9/vir9 isolates, we prepared spore mixtures containing different proportions of the vir9 isolate: 0%, 25%, 50%,
75% and 100%. For each isolate pair and proportion, two independent
inoculations were performed over 5 pots, each containing 10 to 15 seedlings. After 10 days, the frequency of the virulent isolate was measured
(see Methods, "frequency assessment").
