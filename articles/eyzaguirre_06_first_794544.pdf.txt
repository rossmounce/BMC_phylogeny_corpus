Background
HIV prevalence is on the rise among high-risk populations
in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. The molecular epidemiology of the HIV type 1 was studied in 2005 among injecting
drug users (IDU) and female sex workers (FSW) in these
Mexico-U.S. border cities, which contribute over twothirds of the migrant flow between Mexico and the United
States.

Methods
A total of 35 HIV-infected samples were collected; 21 from
Ciudad Juarez (6 IDU and 15 FSW), and 14 from Tijuana
(6 IDU and 8 CSW). Serum was collected and viral RNA
was extracted. Extracted RNA was used to synthesize
cDNA after priming from the 3' end. Synthesized cDNA
was PCR-amplified at the protease and reverse transcriptase region (ProRT). This was sequenced using an ABI
3100 automated sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed by aligning reference sequences using MacGDE
to conduct Neighbor-joining analysis.

or of Tijuana strains separate from Ciudad Juarez strains.
Two of three FSWs, both from Tijuana, had low-level
resistance mutations. FSW, TJ157, had the protease inhibitor resistance mutation G48E and TJ108 had the nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutation T69N.

Conclusion
This community-based study demonstrated that HIV-positive IDUs and FSWs in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana are predominantly infected with subtype B. Two of three FSW,
both from Tijuana, had unrelated anti-retroviral drug
resistance mutations. Further studies in Mexican FSWs
should be done to determine the rate of primary drug
resistance because although ARVs are available as part of
the Mexican universal health care system coverage and
adherence is sporadic.

Results
Eleven of the 35 samples were successfully amplified,
sequenced and analyzed (8 IDU; 3 FSW, of whom 1
reported IDU exposure). Phylogenetic analysis showed
that all 11 samples were subtype B. There was no phylogenetic clustering of IDU strains separate from FSW strains
