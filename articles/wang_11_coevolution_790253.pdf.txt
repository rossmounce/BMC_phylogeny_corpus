Coevolution of amino acid residues in the key
photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco
Mingcong Wang1,2,4, Maxim V Kapralov3 and Maria Anisimova1,2*

Abstract
Background: One of the key forces shaping proteins is coevolution of amino acid residues. Knowing which
residues coevolve in a particular protein may facilitate our understanding of protein evolution, structure and
function, and help to identify substitutions that may lead to desired changes in enzyme kinetics. Rubisco, the most
abundant enzyme in biosphere, plays an essential role in the process of carbon fixation through photosynthesis,
thus facilitating life on Earth. This makes Rubisco an important model system for studying the dynamics of protein
fitness optimization on the evolutionary landscape. In this study we investigated the selective and coevolutionary
forces acting on large subunit of land plants Rubisco using Markov models of codon substitution and clustering
approaches applied to amino acid substitution histories.
Results: We found that both selection and coevolution shape Rubisco, and that positively selected and coevolving
residues have their specifically favored amino acid composition and pairing preference. The mapping of these
residues on the known Rubisco tertiary structures showed that the coevolving residues tend to be in closer
proximity with each other compared to the background, while positively selected residues tend to be further away
from each other. This study also reveals that the residues under positive selection or coevolutionary force are
located within functionally important regions and that some residues are targets of both positive selection and
coevolution at the same time.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that coevolution of residues is common in Rubisco of land plants and that
there is an overlap between coevolving and positively selected residues. Knowledge of which Rubisco residues are
coevolving and positively selected could be used for further work on structural modeling and identification of
substitutions that may be changed in order to improve efficiency of this important enzyme in crops.
Keywords: Rubisco, coevolution, phylogeny, positive selection

Background
Coevolution is one of the few paramount forces acting
on all levels of biological organization from bioms to
nucleotides. Observations of the complementary adaptations in two or more species caused by mutual selection
pressures have started from Darwin’s (1862) work on
orchids and their pollinators and resulted in theoretical
generalizations such as ‘Red Queen Hypothesis’ [1,2].
More recently concepts and methodologies developed
for the study of species coevolution were applied to the
growing wealth of molecular data, in particular for
detection of coevolution between and within proteins

[3]. Identifying coevolving positions in proteins allows
better understanding of their structure and function and
paves the road to engineering proteins with desired
properties. Several computational methods have been
proposed to detect coevolving residues from multiple
sequence alignments (e.g., [4-8]). Best approaches strive
to disentangle patterns created by coevolution and those
due to shared ancestry (phylogenetic correlation) and
stochasticity (random error). Based on recent comparative evaluation of the state-of-art techniques to detect
coevolution [9], here we use one of the top performing
approaches implemented in CoMap [6] to study the
coevolution of residues in a key photosynthetic enzyme
Rubisco.
Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, EC 4.1.1.39) is the key enzyme of the Calvin cycle,

catalyzing the fixation of inorganic carbon dioxide to
organic sugars. Rubisco is a gateway for inorganic carbon, which is present in all light-dependent ecosystems.
However, due to the poor turnover rate and competition
between O2 and CO2 at the active site, Rubisco is often
the rate-limiting step of the photosynthesis [10]. These
properties of Rubisco coupled with its high concentration in photosynthesizing organs make it the most abundant enzyme on Earth [11]. Both biospheric importance
and intracellular abundance of Rubisco stimulated plenitude of molecular studies using Rubisco as a model system (reviewed in [12]), but despite significant progress
our understanding of Rubisco functioning and evolution
is still far from complete [13].
Land plants and green algae have type IB Rubisco,
which is a hexadecamer consisting of eight large, plastid
encoded, and eight small, nuclear encoded, subunits.
Large subunits which possess the active site of Rubisco
are encoded by the chloroplast gene rbcL, which over
three decades ago was among the first fully sequenced
genes [14] and since that time became one of the most
often sequenced genes thanks to its wide use in phylogenetics of plants and algae (e.g. [15]). Plant systematists
have mainly used rbcL paying little attention to its function. However, recently positive selection acting on rbcL
was found in the most lineages of land plants [16]. The
mapping of the positively selected residues on Rubisco
tertiary structure revealed that they are located in regions
important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunitsmall subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase interactions,
and that some of the positively selected residues are close
to the active site [16]. Positive selection on Rubisco is in
concert with well-known variation in Rubisco kinetics
found in different species (e.g. [17]) and its correlation
with environmental parameters (e.g. [18]). Positive selection has been shown as a driving force for kinetic differences in Rubiscos of C3 and C4 plants [19,20].
Coevolutionary studies have been applied to a few
important proteins and provided new information about
protein-protein interactions, ligand-receptor bindings,
and the 3D protein structure [8,21-23]. Here we study
the coevolution and positive selection on Rubisco large

subunit using 142 data sets of the rbcL gene representing the main lineages of land plants (for detailed
description see [16]). Our aim is to provide a better
insight into the patterns of groups of non-independent
sites and positively selected sites as well as to find their
amino acid composition, pairing preference, and spatial
distribution.

Results and discussion
About half of Rubisco residues coevolve

In total 237 groups of residues were detected as coevolving for different amino acid properties: 26 groups for
charge, 71 for the Grantham distance, 80 for polarity,
and 60 for volume. No groups with compensatory
changes were detected. The identified coevolving residues clustered in groups of 2 - 16 residues, and were
widely distributed across the sequence. Around 50%
(237 out of 476) of the large subunit residues were
involved in coevolution. Most of them were involved in
the subtle changes of the biochemical properties of its
surrounding structure, whereas there were 54 residues
located within the structurally and/or functionally
important sites (Table 1). The proportions of the coevolving residues among sites involved in structural and/
or functional interactions and among the rest of sites
were 22.8% and 21.8%, respectively, and did not differ
significantly. Among these 54 coevolving sites, 25 were
involved in the dimerization of the two large subunits,
16 residues were important for the dimer-dimer associations and 19 of them were found to be important for
the interaction between the large and small subunits
(Table 1).
To test whether amino acid composition of coevolving
sites is different from the whole sequence of the large
subunit (LSU) of Rubisco, we performed the c2-test for
independence on the counts of amino acids in the two
groups of sites. This test was highly significant for all
four types (charge, volume, polarity and Grantham distance) of coevolving groups (p-values < 10 -15 ). We
further calculated the correlation of amino acid frequencies at coevolving sites as compared with frequencies
found in the whole sequence. There were 1,396,945

residues in all data sets and 10,128 residues were shown
to be coevolving for one or several biochemical properties. Among coevolving positions 1,714 residues were
detected to be coevolving for charge, 7,087 residues for
polarity, 4,550 residues for volume, and 5,272 residues
were coevolving to conserve Grantham distance. The
correlation coefficients R between the amino acid composition in the whole data set and the residues coevolving for charge, polarity, volume, Grantham and total
(Figures 1, 2) were 0.63, 0.95, 0.80, 0.91, and 0.94,
respectively. Thus, the residue composition of the sites

Page 3 of 12

coevolving for charge was the most different from the
other regions of the protein, with the correlation of R =
0.63, which was lower than a threshold of 0.8 estimated
in [24]. Meanwhile, for sites coevolving for other properties the residue composition was more similar to the
composition of the whole protein (found R ≥ 0.8), and
also similar to the correlation between the composition
of protein-protein interface residues and the composition of the whole protein [24].
Presumably, sites coevolving for certain biochemical
properties (charge, volume, polarity and Grantham

distance) may have different amino acid composition
preferences. Thus, we studied how amino acid frequency
was different in residues that coevolve compared to the
whole sequences. All coevolving sites had higher proportion of A, C, E, F, K, V, T compared with whole
sequences (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). Among these
residues, A, C, F, V are hydrophobic and E, K, T are
hydrophilic. Amino acids W, Q, M and I were underrepresented in all coevolving sites. Proportion of A, D, K,
L, T and V were significantly higher in coevolving sites
detected by polarity (Figure 1a). Proportion of D, F, H,
K, P were significantly higher in coevolving sites
detected by Grantham (Figure 1b). Proportion of K, D
and G were significantly higher in coevolving sites
detected by charge (Figure 1c) compared with whole
sequences. Frequencies of D, F, K, L V, Y were significantly higher in sites coevolving for volume (Figure 1d).
Thus, our results demonstrate that frequencies of certain amino acids at coevolving sites are significantly different from the amino acid composition found in the
whole sequence.
Next, we estimated the residue-residue preference for
inferred coevolving pairs: for each combination of 20
existing amino acids we counted how often a particular
pair of amino acids i and j was inferred as coevolving in
RBCL. For coevolving groups of more than two residues,
all the pair-wise combinations were considered. The
numbers of coevolving residue pairs are shown in the
20 × 20 symmetric matrices with respect to the four different amino acid properties and all the coevolving pairs
(Figure 3.4). The most frequent entries of the matrices

Page 4 of 12

show which amino acid pairs most frequently coevolve.
We observed that for coevolving sites, the residue-residue paring preference was different for each property
(charge, volume, polarity and Grantham), probably due
to specific biochemical constrains or interactions for
each property type. For example, the residues with
opposite charge, such as R-E, R-D, K-D and K-E, are
often inferred as coevolving (Figure 3d). While pairs
contenting the same charge are not very common,
besides the pair K-K, which has extremely high frequency. Additionally, the charged residues also prefer to
associate with small residues, such as T, G. Polar residues prefer to coevolve with other polar residues (e.g.
K-T, R-D). Nonpolar residues on the other hand are
more likely to coevolve with nonpolar residues (e.g. A-L,
L-V, V-A) (Figure 3b). It seems that residues with similar volume tend to coevolve together more frequently
(Figure 3c), such as L-L, F-F, I-I and V-L.
Of all the coevolving residue pairs, the hydrophobic
pairs are most frequent compared with hydrophilic residues, such as A-A, A-L, I-I, L-L, L-V, F-F and V-V (Figure 4). This result is consistent with the previous study
[24]. Nineteen of the coevolving residue pairs (out of
total 400) appear to be responsible for more than 50% of
the cases of coevolution. One possibility is that the evolutionary forces tend to be more similar for the similar
amino acids, and when they evolve together, it makes it
easier to keep the structure/environment stable.
The amino acid composition of sites under positive
selection is different from that of other sites

Two types of models (implemented in PAML and FitModel) were used to detect sites under positive selection
at the protein-coding level (see Methods for details).
From the total 476 residues of the rbcL sequence, we
detected 165 residues under positive selection using
PAML, and 100 residues using FitModel (all with the
posterior probability threshold of > 0.95). The correlation coefficients between the amino acid composition at
positively selected sites and the whole sequences were
0.65, 0.47, 0.60 for residues detected with PAML, FitModel and with both, respectively (Figure 5). All the
correlation coefficients were < 0.8, implying that the
amino acid composition of sites under positive selection
was quite different from that observed in the whole
sequences of Rubisco’s large subunit (see also Additional
file 2). It appeared that preferred amino acids under
positive selection were, either neutral hydrophobic, such
as A, I, M and V or neutral polar, such as S and Q.
While none of the hydrophilic residues were favored,
such as W, K, G, the PAML results show that, the polar
amino acids such as D, E, H, N were preferably located
at the positive selected sites (Figure 5a). Interestingly
the sites inferred to be under positive selection were not

the same for PAML and FitModel. This may be
explained by the differences in the formulations of the
models used in each implementation. PAML analyses
were conducted with site models that detect strong
selective pressure affecting all lineages at specific sites.
In contrast, the FitModel analyses were conducted with
the model allowing switches between selective regimes
through time, which therefore may detect sites under
positive selection only at short time episodes (for review
see [25]). For PAML analyses, the residues preferred to

be under positive selection were A, D, E, H, I, M, N, Q,
S, V (Figure 5a). For FitModel analyses, the residues
preferred to be under positive selection were A, I, L, M,
Q, S, V (Figure 5b). For sites detected with both PAML
and FitModel, we observed a significant preference for
amino acids A, I, M, Q, S, V (Figure 5c). It appears that
the positive selection favored amino acids are either
hydrophobic, such as A, I, M, V or polar, such as S, Q,
but they are all neutral. While none of the hydrophilic
residues are favored, such as W, K, G, the PAML results

show that, the polar amino acids are preferably located
on the positive selected sites, such as D, E, H, N.
The 14 residues most often inferred under positive
selection were in accordance with the previous selection
study of Rubisco [16]. Even though these residues are
not directly located on the functional or structural
important sites, they may be in contact with the active
sites through dimer-dimer interaction, large subunits
dimerization, and large and small subunit associations
(Table 2). We studied whether any of the 14 most often
positively selected residues were also involved in coevolution with other residues under positive selection. From
Table 2 it can be seen that indeed some of sites under
positive selection also coevolve with other sites under
positive selection (e.g. 145&142, 142&255, 95&86 and
255&86).

The protein secondary structure elements helix, strand
and coil have different physical and chemical properties,
thus play distinct roles in the protein tertiary structure
and function. So the evolutionary force may vary among
different secondary structures. In Drosophila proteins
the coil regions are more likely to be under positive
selection than expected, while the helices and strands
undergo less positive selection [25].
The secondary structure of the large subunits of
Rubisco is conserved throughout land plants, despite the
variation in primary sequences [10]. The helix parts are
usually amphipathic with one side hydrophobic and the
other side hydrophilic, thus the structured regions can
occur anywhere in the protein and involve the largest
proportion of residues in Rubisco large subunit. The
strands often contain hydrophobic residues and could
form a well-structured parallel or anti-parallel beta
sheet. The active site of Rubisco is located at the carboxy-terminal end of the beta strand [10]. The coil is
the most flexible element without ordered structure and
assists the conformational change of the protein. Loop 6
of Rubisco large subunit is conserved in land plants and
green algae. It is crucial for the catalytic process because
it controls the opened or closed state of the enzyme,
which influences the association of the substrate [10]. It
was shown that residues in mobile regions of the protein tend to evolve in highly correlated fashion, participating in physical and functional contacts during their
motion [22].
The study of the locations of coevolving residues of
Rubisco with respect to the secondary structure could
unravel the pattern of the coevolution at the structure
level and explain how the different secondary structure
elements may undergo different evolutionary forces. In
plant Rubisco, the helix parts of the structure contain
47.3% coevolving residues (Figure 6a), which is

significantly higher compared to 43.5% in the whole
sequence. Moreover, helixes are enriched with sites coevolving with respect to all amino acid properties (polarity 45.7%, charge 46.2%, volume 49.7% and Grantham
45.2%). The coevolving residues in strands are fewer
than in the whole sequence (coevolving 23.4%, total
26.4%). In coils the total coevolving residues are slightly
less numerous than in the whole sequence (coevolving
29.3%, total 30.1%), but this trend changes for different
properties. In coils the proportion of the sites coevolving
for Grantham distance (30.6%) and charge (30.7%) are
slightly higher compared to the whole sequence (30.1%).
In light of widespread positive selection in plant
Rubisco, the distribution of the positively selected sites
in the secondary structure of Rubisco could suggest
which parts of the structure are more sensitive to the
selective forces. Interestingly, 58.4% of sites under positive selection were located in helices, which was significantly higher than compared to 43.5% among all sites
(Figure 6b). The enrichment of helices with sites under

positive selection was observed irrespectively to whether
the sites were inferred with PAML or Fitmodel. Other
parts of Rubisco structure contained fewer residues
under positive selection compared to the whole
sequence: in the strand regions 21.4% of sites were
under positive selection compared to 26.4% overall, and
in the coils 20.2% of sites were under positive selection
compared to 30.1% overall.
Overall, this shows that evolutionary forces are
unevenly distributed on the large subunit of Rubisco,
with the helical parts of the structure more frequently
affected by coevolution and positive selection compared
to other parts. Interestingly, our results differ from ones
obtained for Drosophila proteins where less than
expected selection was found in helices [26].

we observed a clear shift to the left of the pairwise distance distribution compared to the distribution for the
whole sequence (Figure 7). This suggests that on average
pairs of coevolving sites in LSU are found closer in the
3D structure compared to the background.
Next we analyzed physical proximity of the 14 residues most frequently found under positive selection in
the LSU. Interestingly, these positively selected sites
showed an opposite trend, as they were significantly
further from each other than the background (Table 3),
again showing different pattern from the Drosophila
proteins [26]. The distances between active sites and
sites under positive selection tended to be shorter compared with the background, although not significantly
(possibly due to small samples).

Coevolving residues are closer in 3D structure

Conclusions
The functionally and structurally important sites in the
protein are usually more conserved than other sites. But
in some cases, one mutation at a crucial site may be
compensated by mutations at other sites, so to maintain
vital interactions and functions [22]. Our study shows
that the coevolving and positively selected sites tend to
be located within the functionally and structurally
important regions of Rubisco. Substitutions have to be
compatible with the protein function and be structurally
stable. Therefore, the amino acid composition and the
residues pairing preference of the sites under coevolution and positive selection can provide a better insight
in terms of protein evolution. Our molecular evolutionary analysis reveals that different evolutionary forces
may have distinct amino acid composition and pairing
preferences. The coevolving residue composition may
not be too different from that of the background
because they are wide spread across the sequence, while
the positive selection is quite different. Moreover, the
groups of non-independent residues have their pairing
preference. Based on the amino acid pairing frequency
matrix with different biochemical properties, the distinct
patterns of coevolving pairs could provide a hint for the
further analysis about the mutual information.
Our study indicates that coevolving sites are in closer
proximity in the tertiary structure of the Rubisco large
subunit. Predicting protein tertiary structure from the
primary sequence is a crucial problem in computational
biology. The physical interactions between coevolving
residues could help to build a residue contact map in
protein tertiary structure analysis. Moreover, many residues which coevolve or under positive selection are
found in the functionally or structurally important locations, such as dimer-dimer, intradimer, active site and
small subunit interactions. Our results appear to be in
agreement with the study of Yeang and Haussler [8],
who proposed that in large protein families coevolving

In order to compare the distribution of physical distances between the coevolving residues and all the residues in the LSU of Rubisco, we used four known 3D
structures of spinach and tobacco from PDB both in
activated and non-activated states. For each PDB record,
distances between the center masses of any two residues
in the protein 3D structure were calculated. The coevolving residues were mapped onto the PDB structures,
and all the pair-wise combinations of the coevolving
sites within a group were listed. The corresponding distances of all the coevolving pairs were collected. The
minimum pair-wise distances between residues for both
the activated and unactivated state of each species were
calculated and the smallest value was chosen for further
comparisons. It is said that two residues are in physical
contact, if the distance between them is under a certain
threshold. In some studies, they use the distance
between two beta carbons (Cb) or two alpha carbons
(Ca) of the corresponding residues, with the direct contact threshold of 8Å [22,23]. However, this method only
considers one point of the residue, so that the possible
position conformations of the other part of the molecule
are neglected. In this study, distances between the center mass of the residues were calculated, thus the residue molecule was considered as a whole.
The minimum physical distance between two coevolving sites in LSU varied from 3 Å to 70Å, with a mean
value of 26.6Å. The one-sample Z-test was applied to
the data set and showed that the average pair-wise distance between coevolving sites was significantly shorter
than the average distance of the total pair-wise distance
in one 3D protein chain (p < 0.01) (Table 3). Although
some of the non-independent residues may be physically
far from each other, long-term interactions through
conformational changes and occurrence by chance [22]
could indirectly lead to physical contact, such as, nonspecific hydrophobic interaction. For coevolving residues

phylogenetic relations. Each data set had 11 to 40
sequences. The codon alignments were constructed
from DNA sequences by back-translating from amino
acid alignments. Sequences within each data set were
truncated to the same length. Angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, and mosses were represented by 122, 8, 9
and 4 datasets, respectively.
For each alignment a phylogeny was reconstructed
using maximum likelihood as implemented in PhyML
v3.0 [31,32]. During the inference we used amino acid
models WAG [33] and LG [34], both with Γ-rate variation. The tree space was traversed using the combination of NNI and SPR heuristics [32]. The inferred
phylogenies were used for further coevolution and positive selection analyses.
2. Coevolution Analysis

positions are spatially coupled and many of the coevolving positions are located at the functionally or structurally important positions. Furthermore, we find that
many sites are both under positive selection and coevolution, suggesting that selection towards a new optimum
may require more than one substitution. Indeed, multiple neutral changes along the mutational landscape of a
protein may precede mutations with high advantageous
fitness effect [27].
Because of the importance of Rubisco, it has been the
target of genetic engineering for a long time. Aspects
including structure, function and evolution of this
enzyme have been studied with the aim to improve its
kinetics. Nowadays, the experimental way of random
mutagenesis and bioselection could be used to identify
mutations that influence important properties of
Rubisco [13,28-30], but the vast amount of candidates
and the repetitive lab work make the process slow,
unpredictable and tedious. Knowledge of location of
coevolving or positively selected residues may be used
to design future mutagenesis experiments and accelerate
efforts to engineer better Rubisco, which would potentially increase the yield of agriculturally important crops.

To detect coevolving residues we used a clustering
approach that searches for ancestral co-substitutions or
for compensatory changes by correlating amino acid substitution histories, as implemented in the R-program
CoMap [6,35]. Substitution numbers for each branch were
sampled from a posterior distribution based on a Markov
substitution model and a phylogeny with branch lengths
relating the sequences. Parameters of the models and tree
branches were estimated by maximum likelihood prior to
the sampling. Substitutions were weighted by different biochemical properties (charge, polarity, volume and Grantham) to detect coevolutionary trends specific to amino
acid properties [7]. The amount of the biochemical change
for one site was represented by weighted substitution vectors, containing weighted substitution counts for each
branch of a phylogeny. The correlated or compensatory
evolution was estimated based on the correlation coefficient of the substitution vectors. To select candidate
groups, the complete linkage hierarchical clustering was
applied to distance matrices based on the correlation and
compensation statistics [6]. To asses the significance of
inferred clusters, the parametric bootstrap with 1000 replicates was used to generate the joint null distribution of
minimum site variability together with coevolution or
compensation statistic r, as described in [6]. From such
empirical distribution, p-values for each candidate cluster
with observed statistic robs were computed as Pr(r >robs |
Nmin), i.e., by conditioning on minimum site variability
Nmin of the cluster. Clusters with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as evolving non-independently. A simulation procedure described in [6] was used to correct for multiple
non-independent tests.

Methods

3. Positive Selection Analyses

1. Sequence data and phylogeny estimation

Positive selection on the protein level was measured
using the ω ratio, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous
to synonymous substitution rates per site. Negative

Figure 7 The 3D distance distribution of the coevolving
residue pairs compared to all residue pairs in Rubisco. This is
the minimum distance of the pair-wise residues between the active
state and un-active state of Rubisco (based on the Spinacia oleracea
structure 8RUC). Solid line is the distribution of pair-wise distances
for coevolving residues. Dash line is the distribution of pair-wise
distances for all protein residues.

We used 142 rbcL data sets from [16]. The sequences
were assigned to each data set according to their

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:266
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/266

selection results in lower nonsynonymous rate relative
to synonymous and so ω < 1. If the nonsynonymous
mutations are favored, the nonsynonymous rate should
be higher than synonymous, and so ω > 1 indicates evolution by positive selection. Here we estimated selective
pressure on rbcL using different types of Markov models
of codon evolution: (1) site-specific codon models that
allow variation of selective pressure among sites in a
sequence, and (2) switching codon models that allow
variation of selective pressure among sites and over the
evolutionary time. All branch lengths of inferred phylogenies were re-optimized under codon models.
3.1. Detecting selection with site-specific codon models

Site-specific codon models were used to test each alignment for positive selection using likelihood ratio tests
(LRTs) of nested models: M0 (one ratio) vs M3 (discrete),
M1a (neutral) vs M2a (selection), and M7 (beta) vs M8
(beta & ω) [36]. These analyses were performed using the
codeml program of the PAML package [37,38]. If the LRT
for positive selection was significant, Bayes naïve empirical
Bayesian approach was used to infer sites under positive
selection [39]. Sites that were inferred to be under positive
selection using model M8, if site’s posterior probability for
the positive selection class was ≥ 0.95.
3.2. Detecting selective episodes with switching codon
models

We also used switching Markov modulated codon models to detect episodes of positive selection during the
evolution of Rubisco, as implemented in the program
FitModel [40]. Each switching model used in our study
allows three possible selective regimes for codon sites,
for example like site model M2a with classes for positive
(ω > 1), neutral (ω = 1), and negative selection (ω < 1),
or like model M2 with 3 classes with no constraints on
the ω ratio. Unlike site model, switching models allow
each codon site to change the selective regime, and thus
be affected by different selective pressures at different
time points. This is accomplished by using an additional
Markov process to describe the switches between selection regimes at any individual site. We used models
both with bias (+S2) and with no bias (+S1) for switching between selective regimes. For each alignment we
used LRTs to test whether switches of selective pressure
over time occurred (M2a vs M2a+S1 and M3 vs M3
+S1), and for alignments with significant evidence for
switches we also tested whether there was switching
bias (M2a+S1 vs M2a+S2 and M3+S1 vs M3+S2). Sites
with episodes under positive selection were detected a
posteriori using the Bayesian approach [40].
4. Mapping sites on 3D Structure

The analyses of location, properties and the distance
analysis of residues in the protein structure were performed using VMD viewer [41], a program for

visualization, manipulation and analysis of large molecules in three dimensions. Command options were used
to extract information about sets of molecules, vectors
and coordinates. The center mass of a molecule was
computed using the Tcl language of VMD.
