Abstract
Background: Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is an important component of the plant sucrose biosynthesis
pathway. In the monocotyledonous Poaceae, five SPS genes have been identified. Here we present a detailed
analysis of the wheat SPSII family in wheat. A set of homoeologue-specific primers was developed in order to
permit both the detection of sequence variation, and the dissection of the individual contribution of each
homoeologue to the global expression of SPSII.
Results: The expression in bread wheat over the course of development of various sucrose biosynthesis genes
monitored on an Affymetrix array showed that the SPS genes were regulated over time and space. SPSII
homoeologue-specific assays were used to show that the three homoeologues contributed differentially to the
global expression of SPSII. Genetic mapping placed the set of homoeoloci on the short arms of the homoeologous
group 3 chromosomes. A resequencing of the A and B genome copies allowed the detection of four haplotypes
at each locus. The 3B copy includes an unspliced intron. A comparison of the sequences of the wheat SPSII
orthologues present in the diploid progenitors einkorn, goatgrass and Triticum speltoides, as well as in the more
distantly related species barley, rice, sorghum and purple false brome demonstrated that intronic sequence was
less well conserved than exonic. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of SPSII gene showed that false
purple brome was more similar to Triticeae than to rice. Wheat - rice synteny was found to be perturbed at the
SPS region.
Conclusion: The homoeologue-specific assays will be suitable to derive associations between SPS functionality and
key phenotypic traits. The amplicon sequences derived from the homoeologue-specific primers are informative
regarding the evolution of SPSII in a polyploid context.

Background
Sucrose plays an important role in the plant life cycle. As
the major photosynthetic product, it is essential for
growth, the synthesis of biomass and as a carbon and
energy source. In the cereals, it is converted into starch
and storage proteins, while many dicotyledonous species
use it to form lipids and/or storage proteins [1,2]. Under
stressful conditions (e.g, low temperature or drought ),

the plant cell typically accumulates sucrose as a protective osomoticum [3,4]. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS)
is one of the main regulatory enzymes involved in
sucrose biosynthesis pathway in wheat and many other
crop species [5]. It catalyzes the conversion of Fructose6-Phosphate and UDP-glucose into Sucrose-6-phosphate,
which is subsequently hydrolysed to sucrose by the action
of sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP).
In important crop plants like maize, rice and sugarcane,
plant growth and productivity have been correlated with
SPS activity. SPS activity has been correlated with sucrose
accumulation in sugarcane stems [6-8], while in maize,

correlations have been demonstarted with vigour and biomass yield [9,10]. Genetic studies in maize have also
shown that grain yield QTL (quantitative trait loci) are
linked to SPS activity QTL, as are ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (another starch biosynthesis enzyme) activity
QTL [11-13]. In rice, the location of plant height QTL
appears to coincide with that of OsSPS1, as the transgenic
plants with increased SPS activity grew taller than the
non-transformed control [14]. In tobaccco lines engineered to over-express SPS, UDP- glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose synthase, plant height was increased and
flowering time delayed [15], while the heterologous
expression of AtSPS induced longer stems and greater biomass [16]. Finally, the over-expression of ZmSPS in potato
was shown to improve a number of yield-realted characters [17], while in tomato, it altered the pattern of carbohydrate partitioning in the leaf [18].
The regulation of SPS activity is rather complex, and
involves fine tuning at both the transcriptional and the
post-translational level [2]. Among the dicotyledonous
plant species, three SPS gene families have been recognized, while in the monocotyledonous Poaceae species
wheat, maize and rice, there are five gene families [5].
Here, we report the temporal patterns of expression of
SPS and SPP, and the discovery of structural polymorphisms between homoeologous copies of SPSII. We
have also identified the presence of unspliced introns in
one of its homoeologues. Evolutionary relationships
among the SPSII homoeologues have been illustrated by
comparisons between the gene sequences present in
hexaploid wheat and its progenitors. Finally, we extend
the phylogeny to other grass species.

Results
Gene expression analysis of sucrose biosynthesis genes
during wheat plant ontogeny

As a first step, the wheat Affymetrix probe sets representing SPS and SPP members were identified, based on the
criteria used to define the five SPS [5] and the three SPP
[19] types. The expression patterns of these gene family
members was extracted from the normalized expression
data from imbibed embryo, coleoptile, seedling root,
crown, seedling leaf, stem (at anthesis), developing anther,
developing caryopsis (sampled at 3-5 dap, 8 dap, 18 dap
and 22 dap), and the developing endosperm and embryo
at 22 dap. Except for SPPIII, the SPP genes were expressed
throughout plant development, although their level tended
to be highest in the developing anther and developing caryopsis (Figure 1). Different SPS members show highly
regulated spatio-temporal expression patterns during plant
ontogeny, suggesting the existence of fine regulation at the
first step of sucrose biosynthesis.
As SPSI was prominently expressed in the seedling
leaf and the mature stem (Figure 1) its function may be

associated with the re-synthesis of sucrose from fructan.
SPSII (Ta.4256.1.S1_at), SPSIII (Ta.20568.1.S1_at), TaSPSIV and TaSPSVa were prominently expressed during
microsporogenesis (at premeiosis, throught meiosis and
in immature pollen) and in the mature anther. All
the SPP families were highly expressed during anther
development (Figure 1). Thus, these genes are clearly
important for normal pollen/anther development. Interestingly, note that in the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant
kns2-1, an altered SPS glycosyltransferase I domain disrupts the function of sucrose synthesis, and this leads to
changes in the synthesis of the pollen primexine or callose [20]. In the wild type, SPS5.2 (KNS2) is expressed
in uni- and bicellular microspores as well in more
mature anthers. The present data showed that probably
all the SPS and SPP genes were constitutively expressed
throughout caryopsis development, indicating that more
than one SPS isoforms contributes to overall SPS activity (Figure 1).
Furthermore, it is important to know how these different SPS members are spatially expressed in different seed
tissues and possible co-expression of these members in
the same cell for making hetero-oligomeric complexes to
be functional. The developing caryopsis imports sucrose
to driving its growth and allow storage of metabolites.
The expression of SPS and SPP members within the
developing caryopsis suggests that sucrose cleavage,
transport and re-synthesis during its internal transport
can be differentially regulated within various distinct tissues. Of particular interest was the observation that both
variants of SPSII are differentially expressed in the developing caryopsis. Thus, Ta.4256.1.S1_at was highly
expressed both throughout anther development and during late embryo development, while TaAffx.8003.1.S1_at
was expressed most strongly during early caryopsis development. The contribution of the individual SPSII homeologues and the occurance of alternative splicing are
expanded upon in the following section. Besides alternative splicing, a contributory reason for the present exclusive focus on the SPSII family was that there were four
SPSII cDNA sequences available in the public domain,
which gave the opportunity to design homoeologue-specific primers for three wheat genomes. Insufficient
sequence data are presently available for the other SPS
families. Therefore, in order to study polyploidization
and phylogenetics relationship between three wheat genomes, SPSII was selected as best suited candidate.
Structural analysis of SPSII genes in wheat and its
relatives

Both introns and exons were targeted for the design of
homoeologue-specific primers (Figure 2). The resulting
amplicons allowed for the sequencing of portions of
each of the SPSII homoeologues. In all, 7,364 bp of the

cv. Chinese Spring A genome homoeologue sequence
was acquired from a combination of homoeologue-specific amplicons and flow-sorted chromosome arm 3A
sequences (kindly provided by Dr. E. Akhunov). We
acquired 3,883 bp of the B genome homoeologue
sequence, and 1,184 bp of the D genome homoeologue,
both from cv. Chinese spring (Additional file 1).
Sequence of the SPSII orthologues in Triticum urartu
(einkorn wheat - genome AA; A genome progenitor), T.
speltoides (genome SS ~ BB; putative B genome progenitor), Aegilops tauschii (goatgrass-D genome progenitor)
and barley (genome HH) was obtained in a similar fashion. Their alignment is provided as Additional file 2.
SPSII has 12 introns and 13 exons in wheat, barley, rice,
sorghum and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon) (Additional file 1, Figure 3). In rice, sorghum
and purple false brome, the gene length is 12,838 bp,
12,456 bp and 8,492 bp, respectively (Additional file 1).
In einkorn and T. speltoides six exons and six introns
were amplified, while in goatgrass, this was extended to
eight exons and seven introns. In hexaploid wheat, certain regions could not be sequenced either due to the
presence of large introns or due to unavailability of
homoeologue-specific primers. The intronic sequences
were more polymorphic than the exonic ones, which
were highly conserved among the species compared
(Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6). In the six exons for which
sequence was available, the level of similarity level ranged from 83.1% (between barley and sorghum) to 99%
(between the wheat A genome homoeologue and einkorn) (Additional file 6b). In contrast, for the six intronic regions compared, the similarity level ranged from
35.5% (between purple false brome and sorghum) to
99% (between the wheat A genome copy and that of
einkorn) (Additional file 6c). Intron 12 of the wheat B
genome homoeologue was unspliced, since it was present in the cDNA AF347066 [5]. Sequence alignment
and subsequent cluster analysis showed that the purple

false brome sequence was more similar to those of
wheat and barley in comparison to rice sequence, and
the sorghum sequence was the one most highly diverged
from that of wheat (Figure 4), as was the expectation on
taxonomic grounds [21].

The B genome copy was placed in a matching location
on chromosome 3B between Xksug53a and Xcdo460c
(Figure 5). The D genome copy was not mappable in
the ITMI mapping population, but was localised to D
genome through anueploid stocks.

Detection of SNP diversity

The homoeologue-specific primers developed for each of
the wheat SPSII copies were validated by an analysis of
the nulli-tetrasomic lines of cv.’Chinese Spring’; this
showed that each amplicon was derived from a member
of the homoeologous group three chromosomes (Figure
2). A polymorphism for the A genome copy between
the parents of the ITMI (International Triticeae Mapping Initiative) mapping population allowed it to be
located 13.6 cM distal of Xtam61a in the sub-telomeric
of the short arm of chromosome 3A (Figure 5).

The SPSII amplicons obtained from 27 diverse wheat
accessions were sequenced in a search for single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For the A genome
copy, the intron 6 to exon 12 region was targeted,
while for the B genome, the target was exon 6 to the
3’ UTR, and, for the D genome copy, intron 10 to
exon 12. Three SNPs were uncovered in the 3A gene,
all within an exonic region corresponding to the
sucrose phosphate synthase/possible sucrose phosphate
phosphatase domain. Of the three SNPs, two were

Discussion
Genomic sequence analysis of SPSII genes

Sequence variation in sucrose biosynthesis pathway
genes such as SPS is of particular interest because its
consequence can be a change at the level of phenotype,
sometimes involving vigour, biomass productivity and
economic yield. Markers from the expressed portion of
genome, that are responsible for some important physiological aspects, have been developed in wheat [22-26].
A particular complication in bread wheat is that most
genes which are present in single copy in the diploid
grasses such as rice and purple false brome are represented by three copies. In order to interpret wheat gene
expression data, it is therefore necessary to derive specific assays for each homoeologous copy, as we have
described here for SPSII (Table 2). These assays are also
necessary for the application of pyrosequencing as a
SNP discovery platform [27,8].

intronic region of the B genome copy was applied to
various tissues of, cv ‘Prinz’. SPSII was expressed during
germination as well as in the developing caryopsis at
four and eight days after anthesis (DAF). A similar level
of expression was measured in the germinating seed and
in the developing caryopsis at four DAF, and this fell
somewhat by eight DAF. The A genome copy dominated the global expression of SPSII; there was very little
contribution from the B genome copy (Figure 6).

The low level of SNP within SPSII suggests that variation
in its sequence is constrained by selection against changes
in its physiological activity. Other starch metabolism
enzyme encoding genes have similarly been associated
with little sequence variation [22,28]. The observed SNP
frequency was 1 per 797 bp within the A genome copy,
and 1 per 916 bp within the B genome copy, frequencies
which are typical for bread wheat [29-31]. Most of the
SPSII SNPs were located within either an intron or the 3’
UTR, with only two exonic non-synonymous ones uncovered. These latter substitutions may be of physiological
significance, given that an alanine to valine change compromised the processing of a 22 kDa protein in maize
[32], and that an arginine to lysine substitution in the
bZIP domain of the maize opaque gene abolished the specificity of its DNA binding [33].
Presence of an unspliced intron in TaSPSII cDNA is
mapped to B genome

Intronic sequence was relatively variable at the interspecific and inter-generic level (Additional files 4, 5c),

Figure 6 Relative expression levels of SPSII homoeologues in
cv ‘Prinz’. Relative expression levels of SPSII shown are based on
delta Ct calculation. To compare data from different PCR runs or
cDNA samples, CT values for all genes were normalized to the CT
value of the housekeeping gene (serine/threonine protein
phosphatase, TaPP2A) included in each PCR run. The expression
level of each gene of interest (GOI) is presented as 2-ΔCT, where
ΔCT = CTGOI - CTREF. Mean values were assessed from three
biological replicates for seedling materials and caryopses sampled
four days after anthesis, and from two replicates for caryopses
sampled eight days after anthesis. Error bars indicate standard
deviations from the mean.

while exonic sequence was well conserved (Additional
files 3, 5a and 5b). This pattern is characteristic of gene
sequences in the grasses [21,34]. Analysis of the
sequence of SPSII cDNA clone AF347066 has demonstrated alternative splicing for one of the SPSII genes
[5]. The development of homoeologue-specific assays
has allowed the unspliced intron to be located to the B
genome copy of SPSII. Both of the alternative transcripts
(spliced and unspliced) occurred in the pre anthesis
spike [5]. cDNA of einkorn wheat (genome AA), goatgrass (genome DD), durum wheat (T. durum, genome
constitution AABB) and bread wheat (genome
AABBDD) were amplified using primer pairs w-spsII-iL
& w-spsII-nR, which target the unspliced intron in the
B genome copy of SPSII. Amplification was observed
from bread and durum wheat template, but not from
either einkorn or goatgrass (Figure 7b). An aneuploid
analysis confirmed the B genome specificity of the
unspliced intron (Figure 7c). Thus the unspliced intron
is clearly restricted to the B genome copy of SPSII.
Contribution of A and D genome for the expression of
TaSPSII

All five SPS members appeared to be both spatially and
temporally regulated. Of special interest in SPSII with two
different variants, Ta.4256.1.S1_at: highly expressed
throughout anther development as well also during late
seed development in embryo and TaAffx.8003.1.S1_at:
expressed mainly during early seed development. The

Page 7 of 14

expression pattern of Ta.4256.1.S1_at was consistent with
that previously exposed by Northern blot analysis [5], but
the expression of the latter gene has not been documented
before. Although microarray-based expression data reflect
very clearly any differences between distinct genes, they
are not informative at the level of homoeologues, because
the array features are not homoeologue-specific. In this
case, homoeologue specific primers could play a vital role
in knowing the contribution of three different genomes in
terms of gene expression pattern. Similar strategy was also
used earlier for studying expression patterns of benzoxazinones biosynthesis in wheat contributed by different
genomes [35]. The present data have shown that the A
genome copy of SPSII dominated the global expression of
SPSII and that the B genome copy - despite its two alternative transcripts - the least.
Synteny to rice is perturbed at SPSII locus

At the cDNA sequence level, SPSII is highly similar to
its rice orthologue, which is located on chromosome 8
[5]. Gene order is largely conserved among the major
cereal genomes [36-38], which has allowed for the identification of a syntenic relationship between rice
chromosome 8 and the wheat chromosomes of homoeologous group seven. The prediction is therefore that
wheat SPSII should map to wheat chromosomes 7A, 7B
and 7D, and not, as is the case, to chromosomes 3A, 3B
and 3D. The chromosomal location that we have
deduced is secure, as it relies on a combination of anaeuploid analysis, genetic mapping, the placement of SPSII
ESTs http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/map_locus.cgi, and the presence of SPSII sequence on flowsorted chromosome 3A template. Rice chromosome 1
has been reported to be highly syntenic to wheat chromosome three [38,39]. In the present study, it appears
that a segment at least of the group 3 chromosomes has
lost synteny with rice chromosome 1. Failure of synteny
and breakdown of colinearity is well documented
[24,38,40,41]. Prominent examples involve the regions
around both GBSS1 [42] and the Pbf orthologues in
wheat and barley [24]. Of 537 mapped ESTs mapping to
the wheat group 3 chromosomes, ~15% shared homology with rice genes mapping outside of chromosome 1,
and various complexities associated within co-linear
regions suggests that the relationship between these
chromosomes is not straightforward [38]. Similarly, the
analysis of 1 Gb of chromosome 3B has identified the
presence of gene sequences whose rice orthologues do
not map to chromosome 1 [43], while the annotation of
17 Mb of various regions of chromosome 3B has shown
that only half of the predicted genes present had orthologues on rice chromosome 1 [44]. The SPSII genes lie
in the distal region of their respective wheat chromosome, which suggests that co-linearity with rice may be

lost there. Complex duplications, rearrangements and
polyploidization events have led to the erosion of synteny and colinearity between rice and wheat [45-47].
The imminent completion of the sequence of the entire
chromosome 3B will allow the formulation of a better
picture of orthologous relationships between wheat, rice,
sorghum and false purple brome, as the genomes of
later three species have already been fully sequenced.
Phylogenetic relationship of TaSPSII in the context of
polyploidization among hexaploid wheat and its
progeniotors

The sequence alignments and subsequent phylogenetic
analyses was carried out considered either exons or
introns or both (Figure 4, Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The
hexaploid wheat A genome copy consistently appeared
closest to that of einkorn wheat, the A genome progenitor.
At the level of exons only, the B genome copy appeared

closely related to that of T. speltoides, a species considered
to be taxonomically close to the B genome progenitor.
Branching patterm in dendrogram was little disturbed
when considered only introns depicting nonconserved nature of introns. With respect to the D genome copy, the
comparison with its goatgrass orthologue was only possible on the basis of the sequence of one large exon. This
showed that the D genome copy was more similar to the
goatgrass orthologue than to any of the others. The level
of homology in the exonic sequence between the A genome and the einkorn copy was 99.9%, decreasing to 99.0%
when intronic sequences were compared (Additional file
6). The equivalent similarities between the B genome and
the T. speltoides copies were 97.9% and 95.1% (Additional
file 6). and that between the D genome and the goatgrass
exonic sequence was 98.0%. Thus, polyploidization has left
exonic sequence largely unchanged, while intronic
sequence has been able to drift somewhat, as has been

repeatedly observed in such comparisons [22,34]. The origin of bread wheat has involved two separate allopolyploidization events, the first between einkorn and a species
closely related to T. speltoides, and the second between
the resulting wild tetraploid T. dicoccoides and goatgrass
[48]. The phylogeny predicted from the sequences of the
SPSII homoeologues and wild species orthologues is fully
consistent with this settled origin (Figure 4) and supports
the previous published studies [49,50].

their respective group 3 chromosomes, and have shown
that their divergence is consistent with the known evolutionary relationships between the component genomes of
hexaploid wheat. A phylogenetic study confirmed that
purple false brome is a more appropriate model for the
Triticeae than rice. We have provided evidence that the
syntenic relationship between rice chromosome 8 and
wheat group 3 chromosomes is perturbed in the region
where the SPSII genes map. We have shown that the transcript of the B genome copy of SPSII exists as two alternative forms, one with, and the other without an intron. The
B genome copy contributed least to the global expression
of SPSII expression. The development of homoeologuespecific markers for, and SNPs within the wheat SPSII
genes will enable the definition of any associations
between SPSII genotype and plant phenotype in terms of
vigour, biomass productivity or source-sink relationships.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA isolation

Seed stocks of 27 bread wheat accessions and representative progenitors species were obtained from the gene
bank of the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop
Plant Research, Gatersleben (Table 3). A set of 21 nullitetrasomic lines in cv. ‘chinese spring’ originally
obtained from late Dr. E.R. Sears, Coloumbia, MO, was
used for chromosome arm assignment of PCR products.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 4-6 g young
leaf material as described earlier [56] to be used as a
template for PCR amplification.
Expression analysis of SPS and SPP members

Phylogenetic relationship of TaSPSII between different
grasses

The phylogenetic analysis showed that the purple false
brome SPSII sequence is more similar to those of wheat
and barley than to that of rice, not only in terms of the
sequence itself, but in terms of the gene’s overall length.
The purple false brome SPSII fragment extending from
exon 8 to the 3’end of the gene (a region available for nine
of the ten sequences) was 518 bp longer than the longest
wheat or barley sequence, while this difference was
3,199 bp in rice and 3,663 bp in sorghum. A number of
phylogenetic studies have shown that the taxonomic
separation between the Triticeae and purple false brome is
much less than between them and rice [51-53], which is
the reason why purple false brome has been so readily
adopted as a model genome for the Triticeae [53-55].

Conclusion
A study of the expression of sucrose biosynthesis gene
family members has revealed that SPS genes are highly
regulated both spatially and temporally. We have been
able to locate the SPSII homoeoloci to the short arms of

ESTs/cDNAs sequences for each of the five SPS gene
families and three different SPP gene families in wheat
were blasted against the probesets available on the
wheat 61 K microarray platform on which corresponding wheat SPSI to SPSV and SPP1 to SPP3 cDNA gene
sequences were identified with a significant e value of
10-10 or higher. To assess gene expression patterns of
SPS and SPP gene family members during wheat plant
development we downloaded CEL files of Affymetrix
chip from the publicly available reference experiments
(Series GSE12508; GSE9767; GSE6027) covering various
tissues during germination (coleoptile, root, embryo),
seedling stage (crown, leaf), stem at anthesis, reproductive tissues (immature inflorescence, floral bracts, pistil,
mature anthers), various developmental stages of microsporogenesis and seed development. The transcriptome
data of 61 K genes was subjected to RMA normalization
with linear model using limma package. The log2
expression values were derived, differential expression is
calculated with P value correction mode of Benzamini
Hochberg and heat maps were generated for the differentially expressed SPS and SPP gene family members

Template DNA for the subsequent PCR was represented
by cvs. ‘Chinese Spring’, ‘M6’ (a synthetic hexaploid
wheat) and ‘Opata’. Each 25 μl PCR comprised 50-100
ng template, 2.5 μl of buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM dNTP, 10 μM of each primer and 1 U Taq
polymerase. The amplification conditions consisted of
an initial denaturation step (94°C/4 min), followed by
four cycles of 94°C/1 min, Ta/1 min, 72°C/2 min (where
Ta began at 62°C and was reduced by 1°C per cycle),
then 30 cycles of 94°C/1 min, 58°C/1 min, 72°C/2 min
and completed by a final extension step of 72°C/5 min.
This profile is referred to as “PCR profile 1”. Amplicons
were cloned into the pDrive cloning vector (QIAGEN,
Hilden Germany). Plasmids were recovered from 20
clones from each of the three donor varieties using the
QIAGEN plasmid purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden
Germany), and these were subjected to sequencing from
both ends using a BigDye terminator v3.1 ready reaction
cycle sequencing kit in combination with an ABI3730x1
sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Genesis software [57].

Phred-Phrap-Consed analysis http://www.phrap.org/
phredphrapconsed.html was applied to ensure the quality of the sequences taken forward [59,60]. SNPs were
detected by polyPhred [61] and visual inspection of
Phrap assemblies. Two high quality contigs, assumed to
represent two of the predicted three wheat homoeologues, were aligned using Sequencher software (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan), and their
consensus sequence formed a megablast [62,63] query
against the GenBank database. The outcome of this
search was a confirmation that these two sequences
were homologous to SPSII and not to any of the other
SPS genes. Primer walking was employed to extend the
sequence in both directions beyond the cloned region,
and the sequence thereby acquired was subjected to
megablast to ensure that it was SPSII specific.

The designing of SPSII family specific primers and
subsequent PCR and cloning

Gene annotation, designing of homoeologue-specific
primers, sequencing

The cDNA sequences of each SPS gene was retrieved
from GenBank (accessions AF347064, AF347065,
AF347066, AF347067, AF347068, AF347069, AF354298,
AF534907 and AY4257109) and aligned using the Multalin [58] program. The SPSII gene family is represented
by AF347064, AF347065, AF347066 and AF354298.
Stretches of sequences limited to a particular gene
family formed the basis for designing family specific primers, and in particular for SPSII (Table 2). To test the
specificity of these family specific primers, the sequence
of the resulting amplicons was used as a BLAST query
against the GenBank sequence database http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast, applying high stringent conditions.

A provisional gene structure was obtained by aligning
the cDNA sequences with the rice genome sequence,
and this was later confirmed by direct alignment with
wheat genomic sequence. These alignments was performed using Genseqer http://www.plantgdb.org/
PlantGDB-cgi/GeneSeqer/PlantGDBgs.cgi software,
applying the the rice specific splice site model and a
high stringency [64]. Exon anchored primers were
designed to span one or more intron using Primer3 software [65]. Homoeologue-specific primers targeted indels
and/or base substitutions mainly in the intronic
sequence (Table 2), and their specificity was tested by
the amplification of DNA from nulli-tetrasomic

template. Four primer pairs specific for the 3A copy of
SPSII were obtained, and six for the 3B copy (Table 2,
Figure 2). However, no 3D copy primers were identified
in this way. To obtain an assay for the 3D copy, primers
designed to amplify an exonic fragment from bread
wheat were applied to the goatgrass accession TRI 145/
96, and a region of this amplicon which was specific to
goatgrass (839-880 bp, see Additional file 3) was then
targeted for successful primer design (Table 2, Figure 2).
The A and B genome copies were amplified using PCR
profile 1, while this was modified for the D genome
copy to an initial denaturation step (94°C/4 min), followed by 35 cycles of 94°C/1 min, 65°C/1 min, 72°C/2
min and completed by a final extension step of 72°C/5
min (PCR profile 2). The primer sets were applied to
obtain orthologous sequence from einkorn, T. speltoides,
goatgrass and barley. For einkorn and T. speltoides it
was possible to derive the sequence from intron 7 to the
3’end of the gene in this way, and from goatgrass and
barley from exon 6 to the 3’end of the gene. For rice,
sorghum and false purple brome, sequence information
was retrieved from, respectively, TIGR http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/, Phytozome http://www.phytozome.net
and BrachyBase http://www.brachypodium.org/. All
sequences are shown in Additional file 1, and have been
deposited in GenBank as accession numbers GU797178,
GU797179, GU797180, GU797181, GU797182,
GU797183 and GU929217.
Mapping of homeologue specific amplicons

Homeologue specific markers showing polymorphism
between parents of International Triticeae Map ping
Initiative (ITMI) population were used for genetic mapping. For genetic mapping 112 recombinant inbred (RI)
lines from the ITMI population were used. This population was derived from the cross between W-7984, an
amphi hexaploid wheat and Mexican wheat variety
Opata 85 from CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Me
joramiento de Maizy Trigo) [66]. The SPSII markers
were integrated into the framework map composed of
RFLP markers using software package MAPMAKER/Exp
version 3.0b [67]. Recombination fractions were
converted to centimorgans with the Kosambi mapping
function [68].
SNP identification, synteny study and cluster analysis

Primer pairs which produced a locus-specific amplicon
were used amplify template DNA from 27 wheat cultivars, using the appropriate PCR profiles described
above. The PCR products were purified with the MinElute™ UF PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and
subjected to sequencing from both ends. SNPs were
identified by Sequencher v4.06 software (Gene Codes

Cooperation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Position of the various SNPs shown in Additional file 3. Sequence alignment and phylogeny construction were performed using

software. The resulting sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees are shown in Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 and
Figure 4. Phylogenetic trees were subjected to bootstrap
analysis, based on 10,000 replicates.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cv. ‘Prinz’ seedlings and
developing caryopses at 4, 8 and 12 days after anthesis,
and from seedlings of cv. ‘Chinese Spring’, einkorn,
goatgrass and T.durum using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and RNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as prescribed in the
manufacturers’ protocols, followed by in-column DNAse
digestion. RNA concentration was measured using a
NanoDrop photometer (Peqlab), following the manufacturer’s instructions. A 2 μg sample of RNA was used as
template for cDNA synthesis, using the SuperScript™III
kit (Invitrogen GmbH), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA yield was tested by quantitative PCR
employing a serine/threonine protein phosphatase gene
(TaPP2A) as reference. The cDNA was diluted to so
that the concentration of all samples lay between ± 1
C T . A qRT-PCR assay of the A and D genome SPSII
homoeologue targeted exonic regions, following recommended guidelines [69], while the B genome homoeologue targeted the unspliced intron. PCRs were performed
in optical 384-well plates using the ABI PRISM® 7900
HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and SYBR® Green to monitor
dsDNA synthesis. Each 10 μl reaction contained 5 μl
2 × Power SYBR® Green Master mix reagent (Applied
Biosystems), 1 μl cDNA and 200 nm of each homoeologue-specific primer. The PCR profile was 50°C/2 min
and 95°C/10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C/15 s,
60°C/60 s. Melting curves were recorded after cycle 45
by heating from 60°C to 95°C at 1.9°C min-1. Data were
analysed using SDS2.2.1 software (Applied Biosystems).
To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus cycle
number, the baseline data were collected between cycles
3 and 15. To obtain CT values, the amplification plots
were analysed at an R n threshold of 0.2. To compare
data from different cDNA samples, the SPSII CT values
were normalized against the expression of TaPP2A. PCR
efficiency (E) was estimated from the exponential phase
of each amplification, following [70]. Since these lay
between 1.8 and 2.0 for all samples, the expression level
was calculated as 2-ΔCT, where ΔCT represented the difference between the CT of the SPSSII homoeologue and
that of TaPP2A.
