Abstract
Background: Small RNA attracts increasing interest based on the discovery of RNA silencing and
the rapid progress of our understanding of these phenomena. Although recent studies suggest the
possible existence of yet undiscovered types of small RNAs in higher organisms, many studies to
profile small RNA have focused on miRNA and/or siRNA rather than on the exploration of
additional classes of RNAs.
Results: Here, we explored human small RNAs by unbiased sequencing of RNAs with sizes of
19–40 nt. We provide substantial evidences for the existence of independent classes of small RNAs.
Our data shows that well-characterized non-coding RNA, such as tRNA, snoRNA, and snRNA are
cleaved at sites specific to the class of ncRNA. In particular, tRNA cleavage is regulated depending
on tRNA type and tissue expression. We also found small RNAs mapped to genomic regions that
are transcribed in both directions by bidirectional promoters, indicating that the small RNAs are a
product of dsRNA formation and their subsequent cleavage. Their partial similarity with ribosomal
RNAs (rRNAs) suggests unrevealed functions of ribosomal DNA or interstitial rRNA. Further
examination revealed six novel miRNAs.
Conclusion: Our results underscore the complexity of the small RNA world and the biogenesis
of small RNAs.

Background
Upon the discovery of the RNAi phenomena in invertebrates [1] and the discovery of functional siRNAs in mammalian cell systems [2,3], the identification of small RNAs

has become an important area of research. Contrary to initial expectations, early studies based on the isolation and
sequencing of small RNAs (20–25 nt) revealed the existence of a class of highly expressed small RNAs termed

micro RNAs (miRNAs). Since then, miRNAs have been
shown to regulate mRNA expression in a large variety of
biological contexts, including cell development, differentiation and cancer. Recent studies have discovered further
miRNAs by large-scale sequencing based on recent
advances in sequencing technology [4-8].
Other efforts to isolate small RNAs (< 50~500 nt in size),
sometimes termed "(experimental) RNomics" [9-11],
have systematically identified additional species of small
RNAs. Recently, the analysis of RNAs binding to the piwi
family proteins has revealed a novel, small (29–30 nt),
and yet uncharacterized class of RNAs restricted to the
germ line cells [12-15], which does not depend on cleavage by Dicer [16,17]. These discoveries suggest the possibility of yet undiscovered classes of small RNAs in
mammals. Despite this, recent studies to profile small
RNAs have focused on miRNA and/or siRNA rather than
on the exploration of additional classes of RNAs [4-6,8].
Here, we explore small RNAs by large-scale unbiased
sequencing of RNAs with sizes of 20–40 nt. We provide
substantial evidences for independent classes of small
RNAs. Although these RNAs may be expressed at levels
that are orders of magnitude lower than certain miRNAs
and other highly expressed RNAs, our data reveals the
existence of multiple layers of cellular small RNAs, which
are likely to be specifically processed and maintained in
the cell.

Results
Library preparation
To address fundamental questions about the existence
and variety of small RNAs in mammalians, as well as
miRNA, we prepared two small RNA libraries. We used
HepG2, a cell line derived from human liver carcinoma,
because small RNAs from cultured cells can be obtained
with a minimal risk of contamination due to non-specific
degradation of longer RNAs. Small libraries were prepared
from RNA extracted from HepG2 cell lines and by ligating
the RNA-oligonucleotide adapters to the total RNA, followed by a size based separation (See Methods and additional file 1 for details). Using this cloning strategy, we
focus on molecules that have a phosphate at the 5' end
and a OH group at the 3' ends, like the known miRNAs.
These would not include the non-phosphorylated degradation products. Such RNA molecules, which might have
different groups at the 5' and 3' ends, will not be identified
with this strategy and will be subject of future studies.

We decided to analyze not only the miRNA fraction
(20–25 nt), but also a fraction of slightly longer RNAs (up
to 40 nt). The former is expected to represent miRNAs
mainly due to i) the size constraint and ii) our protocol
which clones 5'-end phosphorylated RNAs. The latter frac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

tion has not yet been characterized by large-scale sequencing and may contain new classes of RNAs, which have not
been explored in depth so far. To further explore these
potentially novel small RNAs, we prepared two libraries:
i) the fraction likely containing miRNAs (19–25 nt) and
ii) a broad 30–40 nt fraction, referred here as "short" and
"long" libraries, respectively.
Small RNAs may be relevant even if their expression levels
are lower than the highly expressed miRNAs, as large
mRNAs can often function successfully even with low
copy numbers. We concatenated the obtained small
cDNAs, cloned them into plasmids and subjected the
libraries to the RIKEN RISA large-scale sequencing pipeline, based on Sanger sequencing [18]. We obtained
20,712 and 15,342 sequences from the short (19–25 nt)
and long (30–39 nt) RNA fractions, respectively.
Sequence classification and library quality
We classified the sequenced RNAs based on sequence
comparison and genome annotations. In the alignment of
the RNA and the genome sequence, we used exonerate
[19], which approximates a dynamic programming algorithm, and discarded poor alignments which cover less
than 85% of the RNA or which sequence identities are less
than 90%. Subsequently, we picked up only the best
alignments for the classification. This criterion was
adopted due to potential biological variation, RNA modification, and errors during the experimental protocols
(See Fig 1 and Methods for details). Besides miRNAs, we
found considerable amounts of other RNAs derived from
transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small
nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA),
known gene loci, and transposable elements. The number
of RNAs belonging to each class is shown in Fig 2, demonstrating striking differences between the short and long
libraries (See Methods for classification criteria).

If random degradation or contamination during library
preparation are enriched in our libraries, rather than 5'phosporylated small RNAs constituting cellular RNA, we
would expect higher ratio of rRNAs due to the high constitution (> 80%) of the total cellular RNA. However, this is
not likely to be the case; the constitution of rRNA fragments in our libraries is just a minority of the small RNA
content. The sequenced RNAs corresponding to the rRNAs
constitutes only 5% (1,018/20,712) of the short library
and 3% (455/15,342) of the long library, which is considerably lower than the hypothetical distribution deriving
from random RNA cleavage. In a previous study of miRNA
in a human cell line, HeLa, the fraction of known ncRNAs
including rRNA, snRNA, and tRNA was 24%, while the
ratio in our short fraction library in our study (which corresponds to the equivalent fraction) was 15% (5% for
rRNA; 10% for tRNA; the few other ncRNAs do not con-

tribute significantly) [3]. This suggests that the our libraries include few artifacts resulting from early stages of
library construction.
Evolutionary conservation
The general evolutionary conservation level of functional
ncRNAs varies considerably among RNA classes [20].
Therefore, lack of conservation does not necessarily mean
lack of function; nonetheless, observed conservation
implies selective pressure and thereby function. For the
long and short libraries, we investigated the evolutionary
conservation level of each small RNA cluster and surrounding genome sequence using mean PhastCons scores
[21] (based on genome-wide alignments of sequenced
vertebrate genomes) (See Fig 2 and Methods). The small
fraction is highly conserved, while the longer fraction is
less conserved than typical exons but more than intergenic
or intronic sequences. The high conservation of the RNA
sequences from the small library is consistent with the

high miRNA content in the library; as noted in [20], miRNAs are generally more conserved than other ncRNAs. A
large part of the long library consists of tRNA-derived
sequences (Fig 2). Such sequences are often labeled as
repeats, and thus ignored by PhastCons. Nevertheless, the
moderate increase of conservation at the long fraction
RNA loci suggests that non-tRNA sequences are under
higher selective pressure than their proximal regions.
Sequence length preferences
The short fraction contains sequences with a median
length of 22 bp, while the large fraction predominantly
contains sequences with lengths of 32 and 37 bp (Fig 3).
Each of the small RNA classes has a distinct length distribution (Fig. 3), which argues against random cleavage of
RNA precursors. Together with miRNAs (21–23 nt), two
additional classes, tRNAs and transposable elements,
show peaks centered around 22 nt. Although some repeatderived small RNAs have been reported as rasiRNA
(repeat-associated siRNA) from plants to mammals [2229], identifying tRNA products of this length was unexpected.

Small RNAs assigned to snoRNAs and snRNAs show peaks
at 34 nt and 31 nt, respectively, whereas their full-length
cognate forms are longer (from 60 nt to 300 nt). There is
also a difference between the lengths of small RNAs mapping to known genes and those mapping to intergenic
regions. The former group shows a peak at 23 nt, while the
latter shows a peak at 21 nt. Although these classes of
RNAs are not as abundant as tRNA-derived small RNA, the
length bias depending on RNA species suggest independent mechanisms of controlled processing by specific
enzyme producing 5'-end phosphorylated RNAs, such as
RNase III, or specific stabilization of randomly processed
RNA followed by and/or coupled with some uncharacterized 5'-end phosphorylation mechanisms.
Uncharacterized pathways associated with tRNA
processing
A substantial number of small RNAs are assigned to the
tRNA category, while our small RNAs are shorter than 40
nt and mature forms of tRNAs are between 70 nt to 90 nt
long. The identified small RNAs are aligned only to welldefined regions of mature tRNAs. Based on the alignments between tRNAs and sequenced small RNAs, we
identify a unique characteristic suggesting independent
pathways of tRNA processing. These partial tRNAs are
unlikely to be the result of non-specific degradation for
two reasons: i) lack of correlation to tRNA expression and
amino acid usage and ii) specific cleavage patterns. We
describe our analysis of these properties below.

Content2and conservation properties of each sequenced fraction
Content and conservation properties of each sequenced fraction. a) The count of small RNAs mapping to specific
types of annotation is shown as histograms for the short and long libraries. Classifications are based on the process described
in Fig 2 and Methods. b) The mean PhastCons [21] scores for the region -300 to +300 relative to the midpoint of each small
RNA cluster are shown, broken up into two fractions. Position 0 indicates the midpoint of each cluster. For comparison, 500
equally sized randomly selected regions where the midpoint was either exonic, intronic, or intergenic was analyzed in the same
way. The small fraction is generally highly conserved, which is expected due to many potential miRNA sequences it contains.
The longer fraction is on average less conserved than exonic sequences, but considerably higher conserved than intergenic or
intronic regions.

The length distribution per each RNA class demonstrates distinct preferences between these classes.

Expression correlation
If the small RNAs matching tRNAs are the result of a nonspecific degradation process, the expression levels of such
RNAs should correlate to that of the corresponding tRNA

genes. Dittmar et al [30] have presented an effort to profile relative tRNA expression in different tissues using
microarrays. Unfortunately, we cannot compare our
results directly to this data since our expression data is not

relative – it is an estimation of the abundance based on
the small RNA counts in one library. An earlier work suggested that the tRNA abundance correlates with the
number of tRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, as a result
of evolution to optimize the efficiency of translation,
based on an evidence that tRNA gene number correlate
with amino acid frequency in C. elegans [31]. Accordingly,
we have compared the frequencies of small RNA
sequences mapping to tRNAs per isoacceptor family (a
group of tRNA genes associated with the same amino
acid) with tRNA gene copy numbers (deriving from tRNA
gene copies from GtRNA database [32,33] and amino acid
frequencies (deriving from Codon Usage Database [34])
(Table 1). The small RNA frequencies have no correlation
with tRNA gene copy number or amino acid frequency
distribution (Pearson correlation coefficient values are 0.028 (P = 0.91) and -0.85 (P = 0.72) respectively, where
P-values are computed based on a null hypothesis that
compared distributions have no correlation), while tRNA
gene copies correlate with amino acids with Pearson correlation 0.67 (P = 0.001). This implies that the cleavage is
directed towards certain tRNA types, rather than being a
function of tRNA expression. For instance, our libraries
identified 4,080 His tRNA cleavage products (on average,
370.9 small RNA reads per each tRNA gene), while the
number of Ser tRNA cleavage products was only 17 (0.6
small RNA reads per gene). Although the tRNA copy
number is an indirect way of measuring tRNA expression
and thus should be treated with caution, the discrepancy
in proportions is also demonstrated in the Northern blotting experiment (see below), and this suggests that tRNAs

are differentially cleaved and/or their products have differential stability in the cells.
Specific cleavage patterns
Intriguingly, we found a cleavage at specific tRNA sites:
the anticodon-loop and T-loop region within the tRNA
cloverleaf structure. An example of the former case is the
His tRNA cleavage pattern. RNA molecules of 37 nt and 39
nt long are observed from 3'- and 5'-end of the tRNA. The
end of these two products are adjacent to each other at a
specific site at the anticodon-loop (Fig 4(A, B)). This exact
cleavage and maintenance of its products is strongly supported by hundreds of sequence reads from the long fraction. Precise cleavage at the same site occurs also in Ile
tRNA. However, this is different from His as only 3'-end
products of Ile tRNA were found in our libraries and its 5'ends were not found (Fig 4(B, C)). Another cleavage at the
T-loop region produces RNAs that are exactly 22 nt long.
This cleavage is found in Glu and Asp tRNA, and only
their 3'-ends are identified in our libraries. The Asp tRNA
has a unique cleavage pattern at the anticodon-loop (Fig
4(D, E)). The length distribution patterns of tRNA derived
small RNAs show distinct tendencies between isoacceptors (additional file 2), demonstrating distinct specific
cleavages depending on tRNA species.

To confirm these cleavage products by independent
means, we performed northern blotting (Fig 5). The
results are consistent with our findings using the
sequenced small RNAs: the 3'-end products of His and Ile
tRNA were detected as 40 nt RNAs, while the 5'-end of Ile

tRNA was not found. This demonstrates that the cleavage
of tRNA occurs in living cells. The northern blot could not
detect the small RNAs corresponding to the Ile tRNA 5'end, which suggests that only the corresponding 3'-end
RNA is maintained in the cells. These findings are consistent with the sequencing of our libraries, and Fig 5 also
shows tissue specificity of the tRNA products. Intriguingly,
the His tRNA products are clearly detected in HepG2 and
brain, but their presence is uncertain in other tissues and

cell lines tested. The LysCTT 5'-end is clearly detected in
brain, kidney, and stomach, while the abundances of the
mature form of Lys tRNAs are not drastically different
from the HisGTG. The cleavage events producing 22 nt
RNAs are also supported by northern blotting (Fig 5(E,
F)).
The observed cleavage events can be interpreted in several
ways: (1) controlled cleavage of tRNA and/or specific

maintenance of the cleaved products, (2) random degradation of tRNAs at the exposed anticodon loop, (3) artifacts during RNA cloning caused by inefficient reverse
transcription at the modified nucleotides, (4) artifacts due
to the limitation of our libraries, which cover only 20
nt–39 nt and cannot cover longer products of tRNA. In
case (2) (random degradation), we would expect that the
abundance of tRNA products correlate with the abundance of tRNA, which is not the case, as described above.
The northern blotting confirms this; the abundances of
HisGTG 3'-end and LysCTT 5'-end products do not correspond to the full-length tRNAs in brain and kidney (Fig
5(D, G).). The case as in (3) is unlikely, because ligation
of adaptors to the RNA is performed before the reverse
transcriptase step. RNA molecules causing stops of the
reverse transcription cannot appear in our libraries, since
RNA sequences considered in this study carry the processed linker sequences ligated at both ends, whereas our
reverse-transcription can incorporate mismatched nucleotides at very high efficiency [35]. The northern blotting
also rejects the possibility of the case (4), as the cleavage
products are detected in both the sequencing and the
northern blotting. The Ile tRNA 5'-end, which is 40 nt
long RNA potentially and might not be included in our
libraries, is not detected even by the northern blotting (Fig
5(A)). The correlation between our sequencing and northern blotting strongly suggests that the small RNA corresponding to the Ile tRNA 5'-end is not maintained in the
cell. Therefore, we concluded that our first hypothesis is
the most likely: the tRNA cleavage processes are controlled by the cell, and/or its products are maintained in a tissue-specific manner. Notably, we have found no specific
base-pattern sites for the cleavage in anticodon loop, but
the cleavage separates the conserved U-U dincucleotide
when it takes place in the T-loop. It suggests either that different enzymes with different sequence specificity are
responsible, or that the exact cleavage is determined based
on the RNA structure of the tRNA loop and not the actual
sequences. These pieces of evidence suggest the existence
of unknown pathways of tRNA processing, where the
cleavage patterns are distinguishable between tRNA species.
22 nt RNAs derived from LTR antisense or tRNA
About 8% (1,599/20,712) of the RNAs from the short
library and 0.6% (94/15,342) from the long library are
derived from transposable elements and have distinct
length distributions depending on families (additional
file 3). The most abundant class within transposable elements is the LTR (Long Terminal Repeat transposons), but
not LINE (Long Interspersed repeat Element) or SINE
(Short Interspersed repeat Elements), despite the fact that
SINEs are the most abundant repeats in the genome. Furthermore, the small RNAs are in opposite (antisense) orientation to LTRs and LINEs, whereas Alu derived RNAs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

appear in the same orientation to the repeat element
sequence. Finally, the length of small RNAs aligned with
LTRs and LINEs is exactly 22 nt, resembling the size of
miRNA, siRNA, and a subset of tRNA cleavage products.
Each of the three LTR families consists of a remarkably
abundant (representative) sequence and considerably
fewer minor variations including 5'- and 3'-end variations, which might be caused by imprecise processing
and/or by expression of repeats diverging from the consensus sequence. Intriguingly, the representative
sequences derive from the antisense strand of LTR, and
they are very similar to tRNA 3'-end. Alignments of the
representative small RNAs, complementary sequences of
LTRs, and tRNA 3'-ends (additional file 4) show that the
tRNA sequences differ from the other two sequences just
in two positions. The first is a mismatch from "A" to "U"
at the 57th or 58th adenine on the tRNA, T-loop. The second difference from the tRNA is that the putative repeatderived small RNA has the trinucleotide signature "CCA"
at the 3'-end. 1-methyladenosine at position 58 (m1A58)
of tRNA is reported in many organisms including human
[36,37] and therefore the m1A58 might have been copied
into "U" during the reverse-transcription of our library
preparation in 499 cases, versus 453 sequences where it
reads as an "A". However, a such high frequency of
purine-purine misincorporation during reverse transcriptase seems improbably high if compared to experimental evidence [38], and the fact that in the tRNAs the
m1A58 still pairs with an "U" [39]. The "CCA" is added
during the maturation process of tRNAs [40]. Therefore,
two hypotheses can be made about their origins: they
could be i) antisense transcripts from LTRs or ii) tRNA
cleavage products whose sequence can be aligned with
LTR antisense, which could be derived from multiple polymorphic loci. The existence of siRNA derived from transposable elements was reported as repeat-associated small
interference RNA (rasiRNA) in various organisms [22-25]
and was only recently started to be identified in mammals
[26,27]. These originate from various scattered regions
within repeats rather than from a specific site, and are generally represented on both strands. In contrast, the small
RNAs described above are putatively derived from just the
antisense strand of specific region in the transposable elements. Therefore, besides being rasiRNAs, these RNAs
could be the unprocessed variants of the tRNA cleavage
products.
C/D box type snoRNA and snRNA products
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) are between 60~300 nt
long RNAs, and contribute mainly to 2'-O-methylation
and the pseudouridylation of rRNA, snRNA, and potentially other RNAs. Some small RNAs, 0.05% (10/20,712)
from the short library and 1% (159/15,342) from the long
library are cleavage products of the corresponding mature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

snoRNAs. Surprisingly, 90% of these snoRNA cleavage
products (152/169) are derived from a single gene: the C/
D box type snoRNA gene mgU6-77 [41,42] (additional
file 5). The small RNAs match 34 nt sequence just at their
3'-end.

small RNAs from the intron sense strand are mapped on
C3orf25 (chr3:130614020..130614043), and 68 of 84
(80%) of all small RNAs derived from the 3' UTR antisense
strand
are
mapped
on
CEND1
(chr11:777438..777463). To examine the hypothesis that
those small RNAs are processed products of sense-antisense derived dsRNAs, we used CAGE (Cap-analysis of
Gene Expression) tags, which are 5'-end reads of fulllength cDNAs by capturing 5'-capped sites [43,44]. In a
previous study, more than 5 million CAGE tags were
sequenced and mapped onto the human genome
sequence [45,46]. Using the CAGE data, we found evidence of sense-antisense transcription on both strands for
these three loci (Fig 6). These findings are consistent with
the above hypothesis of dsRNA originated small RNAs
(See also below for the related section on bidirectional
promoters).

Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) constitute a class of small
RNA (100 to 300 nt) localized in the nucleus, where they
form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) that are
involved in RNA splicing. Some small RNAs, 0.7% (152/
20,712) from the short library and 1.4% (285/15,342)
from the long library, correspond to snRNA. Their length
distributions show peaks at 24 nt and 31 nt in the short
and long library, respectively (Fig 3). All of these small
RNAs correspond to specific 3'-end region of U1, U4 and
U5 (additional file 6), while no snRNA products derive
from the other regions. These products of longer wellknown RNAs, snoRNA and snRNA, also suggest a controlled cleavage or stabilization of its products, which is analogous to but distinct from the suggested pathways of
tRNA cleavage.

We cannot rule out other explanations at this moment.
One of them would be cleavage of folded RNAs harboring
dsRNA. To examine this possibility, we checked local secondary structures of these loci and found that the potential precursor of the small RNAs located in CEND1 locus
can comprise a secondary structure harboring the dsRNAs,
where cleavage of the dsRNA could produce the small
RNAs (additional file 8).

Small RNAs overlapping known genes
A substantial number of small RNAs derive from known
gene loci. There is a remarkable difference in sequence
lengths between RNAs derived from sense and antisense
strands (additional file 7). The most abundant lengths of
RNAs derived from introns are 21 nt and 23 nt for the
sense and the antisense strand, respectively. Their length
distributions are significantly different (P = 4.3e-10, twosided Mann-Whitney test). There is also a remarkable difference between 3'UTR and introns in terms of small
RNAs mapping to the antisense strand. The most frequently occurring lengths of such RNAs are 24 nt and 23
nt, respectively (P = 2.2e-16, two sided Mann-Whitney
test).

Bidirectional promoters
One of the sense-antisense relationships that have
received considerable interest in recent years is the bidirectional promoter, where two closely located promoters
are on opposite strands. These have been found to be
abundant in mammalian genomes [47]. CAGE data indicating transcription starting sites (TSS) in this orientation
occur more often than previously appreciated [45,48].

For clarity, bidirectional promoters can produce transcripts that can be overlapping – this occurs when the promoter on the reverse strand is located downstream with
reference to the other promoter. A large subset of bidirectional promoters have this property, producing transcripts
that are overlapping but on different strands, and giving
rise to potential formation of dsRNA by sense-antisense
hybridization, which might be a regulatory event in itself.
We reasoned that some of the small RNAs identified in
this study could be derived from such dsRNA formation,

A possible pathway to produce these small RNAs is the
cleavage of long dsRNA that are derived from simultaneous transcription of a region on both strands, which
resembles the L1-derived rasiRNAs in human [27]. Interestingly, a substantial number of small RNAs in each subclass are derived from one locus (Table 2): 636 of 1,163
(35%) of all small RNAs from that locus are both intronic
and antisense are mapped on the FRMPD4 locus
(chrX:12299549..12299573), 183 of 664 (30%) of all

promoters. There are 12 clusters of our small RNAs that
directly mapped on these 93 bidirectional promoters
(additional file 9). In most cases, the small RNA clusters
are located between the TSSs (Fig 7), consistent with the
dsRNA hypothesis. This outcome is highly unlikely to
happen by chance (P < 10E-3) judged by randomization
trials (See Methods): although correlation does not necessarily imply causation. However, if the causation is true,
this would mean that the bidirectional promoters can
function as an origin of natural dsRNAs that are specifically cleaved.

we identified overlapping bidirectional promoters where
there are at least two TSSs on opposite strands within 40
bp, and where the two transcripts can potentially hybridize. Such bidirectional promoters could principally be
located further away than 40 bp: however, we choose 40
nt cutoff since CAGE tags have a characteristic length of
20–21 bp and thus the tags under analysis are guaranteed
to cover the entire region between the TSS on both
strands. This makes overlapping transcripts likely. Since
we focused our study on strong promoters, we only
assessed TSS having at least 10 CAGE tags. Using these criteria, we obtained 93 overlapping proximal bidirectional

Apart from the significant overlap with the small RNAs,
we noticed a second interesting feature associated with
these bidirectional promoters: a partial but exact match of
both CAGE tags (detected on both RNA strands) and
small RNAs to ribosomal RNA sequences (only the strand
corresponding to ribosomal RNA detected, not the antisense; additional file 10). There are several clusters of
rRNA genes (or rDNA) tandemly repeated hundreds of
times [49], while ribosomal RNA sequences are not part of
the current genome assembly (hg17). Partial copies of
rDNA occur in the genome assembly, and the small RNAs
within bidirectional promoters are located in these interstitial rRNAs. Due to the (partial) sequence identity
between the interstitial rRNAs and rDNA repetitive clusters, we cannot unambiguously conclude about the origin
of our small RNAs and CAGE tags. It is possible that our
small RNAs and CAGE tags are degradation products
caused by abundant ribosomal RNA within a cell. However, the CAGE tags on the antisense strand are unlikely to
be such degradation products, because the CAGE method
does strictly maintain the strand directionality, as demonstrated by its capability to detect sense-antisense RNA
transcription [50]. Note that typical rRNA should not be
captured by CAGE because that rRNA is transcribed by
polymerase I, not II, and have no cap structure at its 5'end. These evidences underline the complexity of the transcription and/or processing pathways of rRNA or rRNArelated sequences.
To examine whether these are general characteristics to the
interstitial rRNA, we identified 140 regions on the
genome assembly, which are similar to or partially identical to rRNA as identified by using BLAT [51] (additional
file 11). Of the 140 interstitial rRNA, 55 (39%) and 64
(46%) express small RNAs of the same strand to the rRNA
and bidirectional transcription (CAGE tags are mapped
on sense and antisense strand of the interstitial RNA)
respectively, and 37 (26%) encode both of them. It is possible that the two characteristics, small RNA encoding and
bidirectional transcription, are a generic feature of interstitial rRNAs. If we assume that the small RNAs are derived
from rDNA repetitive clusters, then they can be considered as rasiRNA. Selective regulation of histone lysine

methylation was reported on mouse rDNA [52], and these
small RNAs might be involved in epigenetic modification.
Novel miRNA candidates
Over 60% of the sequences in the short library can be
assigned to known miRNAs (Fig. 2). This is consistent
with previous findings [4,53], which demonstrates that
our experimental procedure has succeeded to identify
endogenous small RNA in human cells. In order to discover novel miRNAs, we applied standard criteria for
miRNA annotation [54], consisting of expression and biogenesis. Since the sequences in our libraries are expressed
(as we detect them by sequencing), we focused on predicting possible folding patterns. We did not use conservation
as a criterion for identifying miRNAs, because there are
specie-specific RNAs that are not significantly conserved
even in the recent primate evolution [53]. There are 3,336
novel sequences that did not correspond to any known
miRNA, tRNA, rRNA, transposable elements, or other
ncRNA, which are located in 1,557 clusters of small RNAs.
We inspected genomic regions proximal to these clusters
and determined whether they can fold as hairpin-loop
precursors, whether their stem regions correspond to the
sequenced RNA, and whether their structures are conserved among several species. Finally, we found six novel
miRNA loci potentially encoding miRNA precursors, from
which 20 nt–21 nt mature miRNAs corresponding to the
small RNAs in our library can be cleaved out (see Table 3
and additional file 12; additional file 13 for predicted secondary structures).

Intriguingly, a novel miRNA and its complementary counterpart within the precursor stem are derived from the first
exon of an imprinted non-coding gene H19, which is
expressed from the maternal allele during development
[55] (additional file 14). During the preparation of this
manuscript, the counterpart was reported as miR-675 in
the 293T cell line [56]. The miRNA is sequenced only once
from our library, and the novel miRNA ("star" sequence
of the miR-675), miR-675b, is sequenced three times.
These findings indicate that the H19 derived miRNAs varies depending on its context or on the tissue it is expressed
in.

Discussion
We have investigated the existence of small functional
RNAs in the HepG2 cell, a liver carcinoma cell line. By taking precautions to minimize artifactual random RNA degradation, our data demonstrates that besides new
miRNAs, there are further classes of small RNAs that have
not yet been properly described. Previous studies analyzed small RNAs similar in length to the short fraction
(19–25 nt) [4-6,8]. They mainly focused on RNA-silencing related RNAs, miRNA and on siRNA, and did not further analyze other RNAs after classification. No studies
have examined small RNAs equivalent to the long fraction
(30–39 nt), except for piRNA [12-15].
The first surprise is the content of the short and long fractions, revealed by classification of the sequenced small
RNAs. The main content of the short fraction is miRNA,
and this observation is consistent with previous studies.
Unexpectedly, the long fraction consists mainly of tRNA.
The classification also shows that a substantial number of
RNAs is derived from intergenic regions. This is consistent
with previous reports showing that at least 60 – 70% of
the genome is transcribed [46,57].
Potential tRNA cleavage pathways
A surprising class of small RNAs is composed by short
forms of tRNAs. Detail examination of the sequences and
the subsequent experiments suggest that the sequenced
RNAs are likely to be non-random cleavage products of
tRNA. This leads two hypotheses which are not mutually
exclusive: (1) the cleavage products are functional by
themselves and produced intentionally, (2) the products
are the result of a controlled cellular process, which has
not been reported previously. We did not examine these
hypotheses here with targeted experiments; they remain
to be answered in future works.

The cleaved products do not resemble a result of tRNA
degradation by the nuclear surveillance pathway shown in
yeast, where defective tRNAs are at first polyadenylated,
followed by exosome processing [58,59]. Some RNases
are known to cleave tRNA internally, such as Onconase
[60] (an RNase found in eggs and early embryos of the
leopard frog that cleaves tRNA specifically at UG and CG,
and GG dinucleotides) and M1RNA [61,62] (RNaseP in E.
coli), but there are no reports of such endogenous RNase
activity in human. Another possible enzyme to cleave out
the small RNAs (especially for the product with the same
size to the siRNA and miRNA) is an RNase III enzyme,
such as Dicer, which cleaves dsRNAs and produce 5'-end
phosphorylated RNAs. To examine this possibility, we
analyzed the nucleotide composition of the tRNA products (additional file 15), since cleaved products of RNase
III enzymes tend to have "U" at the 5'-end [17,63]. We
found a clear bias towards "U" at the 5'-end in the 22 nt

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

long products. After detailed assessment of the tRNA
sequence, the high frequency of "U" at the 5'-end of 22nt
RNA arise from a nucleotide corresponding to the position 54 of tRNA, which is commonly "U" in all of the
tRNAs. Thus, this bias does not strongly support the
hypothesis that the cleavage enzyme is of the RNase III
type, although on the other hand it does not conflict with
this hypothesis. Another possible pathway is the association with LTR's primer binding sites, although this cannot
explain all of the cleavage because the tRNA cleavage
occurs in tRNAs which are not used as primers (additional
file 16). In particular, the 22 nt sequences resembling
tRNA and LTR antisense exactly correspond to 3'-end
region of tRNA, which can hybridize LTR primer biding
site (additional file 4). The base-pairing of tRNA and LTR
could contribute to the 22 nt RNA production from tRNA.
A possible effect of tRNA cleavage is indirect silencing,
which is best explained by an example, Onconase. Cancerous cell line growth is suppressed with a delay of 24–48
hours when the cells are treated with Onconase [60]. This
delayed response lead to the hypothesis that growth suppression is not caused by direct toxicity due to protein synthesis inhibition caused by tRNA cleavage, but through
the production of secondary messages (the cleavage products of tRNAs) that would interfere with yet unknown cellular mechanisms [64]. Similarly, human RNases of yet
unknown functions may contribute the specific cleavage
of tRNA to produce new RNA effectors. A candidate for
such an effecter is the 22 nt cleavage product of tRNA, 3'end of Glu tRNA, which might be involved in RNA silencing in a similar way to miRNA and siRNA. Based on the
sequence complementarity, possible targets for silencing
are transposable elements that use the tRNA 3'-ends as
primers. Besides the fact that RNA silencing is used in
many organisms to protect the host genome from retroviruses and retrotoransposons, the use of tRNA would have
additional benefits such as being readily available and
being effective: tRNA is abundant within a cell and active
transposable elements to be repressed should have a
priming site for reverse transcription. Another possible
machinery to suppress mRNAs is the use of RNase P and/
or RNase Z. mRNAs of influenza virus and HIV-1 can be
cleaved by the RNases with external guide sequence
(EGS), which is an RNA similar to the tRNA short form
and plays its role as a guide to specify its target RNAs
[65,66]. These RNases may use the cleaved product of
tRNA demonstrated here as a guide to regulate genes. All
of the above hypotheses, based on our novel data, await
future experimental validation.
Overlaps between bidirectional promoters and rRNAs
Besides unknown cleavage of tRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, we
found a significant overlap between bidirectional promoters and small RNAs, suggesting a connection between nat-

urally formed dsRNA and cleaved small RNAs. We also
found that these regions are located in rDNA repetitive
clusters or interstitial rRNAs. This is the first report showing that rRNA or rRNA related sequences can be transcribed in a bidirectional way and, encoding small RNAs,
despite mature rRNAs are classical functional RNA studied
in-depth previously. Although we cannot conclude the
origins of these CAGE tags showing bidirectional transcriptions and these small RNAs due to partially identical
sequences, small RNAs are likely to be related with these
antisense transcription events. Elucidation of the detailed
mechanisms requires further studies. More deep sequencing will be necessary to correlate these short RNAs with
the whole genome tiling array studies [67], which identify
the signal deriving from short RNAs overlapping TSS of
mRNAs

Conclusion
We have discovered multiple classes of small RNAs
derived from many different sources, in addition to six
novel miRNAs. Specific cleavage of well-characterized
non-coding RNA, such as tRNA, snoRNA, and snRNA, is
likely to produce the small RNAs observed in our libraries.
Bidirectional (or sense-antisense) transcription might also
contribute to their biogenesis. Our new dataset and its
analysis show that there are distinct patterns of small RNA
biogenesis that greatly expand our knowledge, paving the
way to downstream studies to elucidate various complex
patterns of RNA expression, cleavage, maintenance and
mechanisms of actions. In particular, tRNA cleavage and
bidirectional transcriptions within rRNA (or related
sequences) underscore the complexity of the transcriptome and add yet another layer to the complexity of transcription in mammalian cells.
Our data also emphasize on the inconvenience and constraints of having hard definitions for biological molecules. Indeed, a part of known RNAs (such as tRNAs,
rRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs) is present in multiple
forms, which may play different biological roles. These
data imply that cells use the same small RNA molecules
multiple times for a variety of functions. Multiple roles of
the same molecule are widely recognized for mRNA as
alternative splicing, and an analogous concept should be
applied for entire RNA molecules including mRNA and
non-coding RNA. In our study, it was possible to unambiguously distinguish the origin of our small RNAs,
between tRNA and antisense of transposable elements,
and between frequently repeated rDNA sequence and just
partial copies. Small RNA derived from these ambiguous
regions is putatively linked to genome and transcriptome
evolution. The unrevealed pathways implied in this study
underline the importance of a less dogmatic approach to
study and annotate the transcriptome and its regulation.

Methods
Total RNA extraction
HepG2 cells (from an hepatocellular carcinoma from a 15
years old male) were cultured in Minimum essential
medium (Eagle) with 2 mM L-glutamine and Earle's BSS
adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM
non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate,
90%; fetal bovine serum, 10%. Total RNA was extracted
by acid guanidinium phenol chloroform (AGPC), expect
that all precipitations were done with ethanol, instead of
isopropyl alcohol, to ensure the recovery of small RNAs.
Small RNA library preparation
A 5' phosphorylated 3' RNA/DNA chimeric oligonucleotide (sequence: 5'-phosphate-UUUaaccgcgaattccagbiotin-3', the upper-case indicates the RNA part of the oligonucleotide, lower-case indicates the DNA part oligonucleotide) and a 5' adaptor DNA/RNA chimeric
oligonucleotide (sequence: 5'-acggaattcctcactAAA-3', the
upper-case indicates the RNA part of the oligonucleotide,
lower-case indicates the DNA part oligonucleotide) were
simultaneously ligated to 1 micro gram total RNA with T4
RNA Ligase (Takara), as modified from [3]. Purified small
RNAs ligated (insert of the target length + linkers) with
both linkers were separated from adaptor dimer (36 bp)
on a 5% denaturing PAGE gel.

After the chimeric-oligonucleotide adapter ligation, the
cDNA synthesis was carried out from the purified small
RNAs after the ligase step above, using 3'RT-PCR primer
(sequence:5'-gactagctggaattcgcggttaaa-3') with M-MLV
reverse transcriptase with RNase-H-minus, point mutant
(Promega). The cDNA derived from small RNA were
amplified by PCR using adaptor-specific primers: primer 1
(short-RNA3'RT-PCRprimer): 5'-biotin-gcacgctggcctcgtgagaattc-3'; primer 2 (short-RNA5'PCRprimer): 5'cagccaacggaattcctcactaaa-3'. PCR was performed from 1 μl
of template RT product, 5 μ1 of 10× buffer, 4 μl of 2.5 mM
dNTPs, 0.5 μl of 100 uM primer 1, 0.5 μl of 100 μM
primer 2, 0.5 μl of EX-Taq polymerase (5 U/μl, Takara) in
a total volume of 50 μl. After incubating at 94°C for 1
min, 26 PCR cycles were performed for 20 sec at 94°C, 30
sec at 55°C, 1 min at 70°C; followed by 5 min at 70°C.
The PCR products were further purified on a 12% polyacrylamide gel for separating the two main bands used for
the libraries (20–25 and 30–40 nt inserts). PCR-amplified, gel-purified small RNA tags were re-amplified, followed by digesting with EcoRI (Fermentas). The desired
products were purified on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and
after elution were concatenated with T4 DNA ligase (New
England Biolabs) for 20 minutes at 16. Proteinase K treatment was carried out, followed by purification and ethanol precipitation and redissolved with 2 μl of distilled
water.

The concatenated products was then ligated to 50 ng
pZErO-2 cloning vector, previously cleaved with EcoRI,
and the ligation with the T4 ligase (New England Biolabs)
was carried out in 5 μl under standard conditions. The
reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 16°C to
ligate concatemers to the vector. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was purified and the DNA was precipitated
with ethanol. The DNA was finally resuspended in distilled water, followed by electroporation into DH10b
ultracompetent cells (Invitrogen) at 2.5 kv/cm, plated on
zeocin plates (50 μg/ml), and the obtained plasmid was
sequenced with "forward" primer as described [18].
Sequences of the inserted small RNAs were extracted by
identifying EcoRI ligated doublet linker (24 bp) with
allowing 2 bp mismatch, after vector masking with 12 bp
match at least. The sequences have been submitted to the
DDBJ (Sequence IDs are ADAAA0000001 –
ADAAA0005988,
and
ADAAB0000001
–
ADAAB0006146).
Genome, miRNA, and rRNA mapping
The first step to characterize the sequenced RNA is to find
the loci encoding them. We aligned them with several
known sequences, the human reference genome sequence
(NCBI build 35, hg17; all of the genomic coordinates in
this paper are based on hg17), known miRNA database
(miRBase Release 8.2), and ribosomal DNA sequences
(X03205, J01866, M11167). The sequenced RNA should
exactly match to these sequences in the ideal case, but this
is not always correct due to several reasons: (1) Biological
variation: the sample used here is a cancer cell line,
HepG2, and its genome should have many variations
from the reference of human genome (2) RNA modification: some ncRNAs are known to have modifications at
specific positions to achieve their function. Modified
nucleotides potentially cause mismatches during the
experimental process such as reverse-transcription, PCR,
and sequencing. Especially tRNA, the major component
of the long fraction in this study, has additional trinucleotides "CCA" at the 3'-end as well as many internal modifications [36] (3) Errors during the experimental
protocols, such as RT-PCR and sequencing. Thus, we
aligned the small RNA sequences with allowing a few mismatches, and picked up the best one from the alignments
as the locus producing the small RNAs.

Some widely used local alignment tools, such as BLAST
[68] and BLAT [51], are not optimal for mapping small
RNAs due to their heuristics. We adopt a sequence alignment program, exonerate, which allows approximation to
exhaustive alignment based on dynamic programming
[19]. The program was run with the following options:
"–dnawordlen 8 –model affine:local –score 80 –wordjump 1". In order to exclude poor alignments and reduce
ambiguity, we filter out alignments where less than 85%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

of the RNA is aligned, or the sequence identity is less than
90%. We adopt these parameters to align the tRNA products, which is short but frequently include the RNA modification site and trinucleotides signature of tRNA "CCA"
at the 3'-end, to the genome properly. A substantial part
of the tRNA products with 22 nt length have the trinucleotides (additional file 17), and the requirement of 85% or
more aligned region is adopted to cover those cases (19
nt/22 nt = 86%). After this filtering, we keep only the
alignments with the highest score and remove the others.
Even after this restrictive procedure, single RNA sequences
can be mapped on multiple locations due to the genomic
repeats contained in the genome such as transposable elements and tRNA. Hence, our procedure allows multiple
mapping. The small RNAs are also aligned with miRNA
precursor and rRNA, according to Fig 1. The same criterion
to the genome mappingis performed against miRNA hairpin sequences in miRBase and rRNAs.
Clustering
Based on the genomic coordinates, we defined small RNA
clusters on the genome, where sequences overlapping on
the same strand with at least one base pair are merged.
Associations between small RNAs and these clusters are
described in additional file 18, and genomic coordinates
of these clusters are described in additional file 19 in General Feature Format (GFF).
Sequence classification
The small RNAs are classified based on the mapping
described above and on genome annotations (Fig 1). If an
RNA sequence was aligned with the miRNA or rRNA, the
sequences are assigned to these classes. Assignment to
miRNA is prioritized because it is the most likely species
within these sized of RNA, 20–40 nt. rRNA is used as an
indicator of contamination during library preparation,
and its assignment is prioritized to avoid under estimation of the possibility. If the sequence is neither miRNA
nor rRNA, genomic coordinates and genome annotation
was used. We retrieve genomic coordinates of tRNA from
the GtRNA database [32,33], snoRNA and repeats from
the UCSC Genome Browser Database [69], and transcriptional units (TU) from the FANTOM3 data repository
[46]. A TU is a cluster of transcripts which exons that overlap each other, and we use it's genomic coordinates as
known gene loci. The small RNAs are assigned to the five
classes, snoRNA, snRNA, other ncRNA, repeat, and known
gene according to the Fig 1. The two classes intergenic and
unmapped are adopted for the rest of sequences, in case
that it can or cannot be mapped on the genome, respectively. The result of the classifications is described in additional file 18.

This classification is based on the mapping described
above, where the best aligned genomic regions are used

Page 16 of 21

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:157

even if they are not identical matches to the small RNA
reads. Additional file 20 shows the both cases of the classifications of all of the mapped small RNA reads and only
the reads that is identical to the genome sequences. This
demonstrates that the entire tendencies are unaltered: the
main constitutions of the short and long libraries are
miRNA and tRNA, respectively. The ratio of tRNA is relatively low when only the identical reads to the genome are
used, which is caused by the tRNA modification, such as
nucleotides in T-loop and/or "CCA" addition to the 3'end.
Conservation analysis
As described above, we investigated clusters of mapped
small RNA long and short fractions independently. For
each such cluster, we located the midpoint of the cluster,
and retrieved PhastCons [21] scores from the UCSC database [70] (hg17 assembly), for the -300 to + 300 nt region
relative to the midpoint. PhastCons is a Hidden Markov
Model-derived conservation index on the nucleotide level
based on all complete vertebrate genomes, where PhastCons scores can be viewed as the estimated likelihood that
a nucleotide is under purifying selection, based on a
phylo-HMM having two states with two different phylogenetic models correspond to 'conserved' and 'nonconserved' [21,71]. Thus, for each small RNA cluster we
obtain a vector of 601 conservation values. From the
alignment of all clusters from the same fraction to the
midpoint, we can assess the general conservation level of
the small RNAs and their surroundings, here expressed as
the mean PhastCons score. For comparison, we randomly
selected 500 genomic regions of the same size in which
the midpoint was intergenic, exonic or intronic, judged
from GenBank mRNA mappings, and performed the same
analysis. Nucleotides with no PhastCons value (often due
to repeats) were treated as missing values in the calculation of the mean.
Northern blot
RNAs of the following cell lines and primary tissues were
used for northern blotting: 293 (from embryonic kidney),
HeLa (from cervix carcinoma), U-2 OS (from osteosarcoma), MCF-7 (from breast cancer), brain (Biochain#R1234035), kidney, and stomach. This study is
approved by RIKEN Yokohama Institute Ethical Committee (Approved numbers H15-41, H16-7, and H17-46).

For northern hybridization analysis of small RNA, 12.5 μg
of RNA was separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 7 M urea in 0.5 × TBE solution (100 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 90 mM of borate, and 1 mM of EDTA pH 8.0)
using XCell SureLock Mini-Cell unit (Invitrogen). The
electrophoresis was performed with 20 volts for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then the RNA was transferred
to positively charged nylon membrane, Hybond N+

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/157

(Amersham) by electroblotting under 20 mA (constant
voltage) at room temperature for 1 hour, XCell II Blot
Module (Invitrogen).
The probes for northern blotting were labeled with [g32P]ATP by the use of mirVanaTM Probe & Marker Kit
(Ambion). The probes were designed as a complemental
to a 3'- fragment of transfer RNAs described in additional
file 21.
The RNA blotted on the membrane was hybridized with
the synthetic oligonucleotide probes at 42°C for 12 to 16
hours in a hybridization oven (NIPPON Genetics). The
membranes were then washed 3 times with northern
wash solution (6 × SSC and 0.2% SDS) for 5 minutes at
room temperature and washed only once with the solution for 15 minutes at 42°C. The hybridized signals were
detected by Bio-Image analysis system (Fuji Film).
Randomization experiment
Our goal was to assess the likelihood of the observed overlap of the small RNA clusters with the 93 bidirectional
CAGE promoters. For this, we randomly selected 93 nonoverlapping genomic regions with the same size distribution as the observed bidirectional promoters and
observed how many small RNA clusters overlapped these
regions, and repeated this procedure 1000 times. We
observed no overlap in any randomization trial and conclude that the likelihood is < 10E-3.
