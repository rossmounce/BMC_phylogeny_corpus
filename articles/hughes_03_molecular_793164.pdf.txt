Abstract
Phylogenetic analyses of the family Trypanosomatidae have been conducted using both 18S rRNA
gene sequences and a variety of protein sequences. Using a variety of phylogenetic methods, 18S
rRNA phylogenies indicate that the genus Trypanosoma is not monophyletic. Rather, they suggest
that the American and African trypanosomes constitute distinct clades. By contrast, phylogenetic
analyses of available sequences in 42 protein families gene generally supported monophyly of the
genus Trypanosoma. One possible explanation for these conflicting results is poor taxon sampling
in the case of protein coding genes, most of which have been sequenced for only a few species of
Trypanosomatidae.

Introduction
The family Trypanosomatidae (Euglenozoa: Kinetoplastida) includes several of the most serious vector-borne protist parasites of humans, numerous species parasitic on
non-human vertebrates, and numerous parasites of
insects, other invertebrates, and plants. The major human
parasites include a number of species in the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma. In Trypanosoma, the two major
human parasites are T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, and T. brucei, the causative agent of African
sleeping sickness. T. cruzi belongs to a major grouping
within the genus Trypanosoma known as the American
trypanosomes (or Stercoraria), while T. brucei belongs to
another major grouping known as the African trypanosomes (or Salivaria).
As with most other single celled organisms, evolutionary
relationships within Trypanosomatidae were very poorly
known prior to the availability of molecular data because
there are few morphological characters documenting relationships within this family. The advent of molecular

sequence data provided many additional characters for
phylogenetic analysis, but so far evolutionary relationships within the family remain poorly resolved even by
molecular data [1–7]. Here we briefly review some of the
major results of previous molecular phylogenetic analyses
of Trypanosomatidae and present new analyses based on
42 protein families. In particular, we address the issue of
the relationship between American and African trypanosomes and whether or not the genus Trypanosoma, as currently recognized, represents a clade or monophyletic
group (i.e., whether Trypanosoma includes all the descendants of a single ancestral species and only the descendants
of that ancestral species).
This question is of more than theoretical interest because
Trypanosoma includes both African and American trypanosome parasites of humans. If these species are not closely
related, it may have important implications for our understanding of these species' basic biology. This in turn may
have implications for the development of potential new
strategies of prophylaxis and treatment. We will show that

phylogenies based on 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA)
genes have provided an answer to this question that
appears inconsistent with the results of the majority of
phylogenies based on available protein sequences. We
then discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.

18S rRNA Phylogenies
In one of the earliest 18S rRNA phylogenies of trypanosomes, T. brucei clustered outside a group that included T.
cruzi, other American trypanosomes, and members of
Leishmania and six other genera of Trypanosomatidae [1].
According to this phylogeny, the American and African
trypanosomes do not form a monophyletic group. However, sequences from only a relatively small number of
species were available at the time of this analysis. In addition, the tree was rooted with sequences from two members of the family Bodonidae, a family of free-living
kinetoplastids believed to be closely related to Trypanosomatidae. However, if the family Trypanosomatidae
itself is not monophyletic, this rooting might not be valid.
Subsequent studies, including additional 18S rRNA
sequences, tended to support the monophyly of the genus
Trypanosoma [2–6]. However, most of these phylogenies
were also rooted with Bodonidae, thus raising questions
regarding the validity of the rooting. However, Wright and
colleagues [5] rooted their phylogenetic tree with certain
species of Euglenida and stramenopiles (Chrysophyceae
and Eustigmatophyceae). Since theses species are unquestioned outgroups to both Trypanosomatidae and Bodonidae, the phylogeny of Wright et al. [5] provided the
strongest support yet for monophyly of Trypanosoma.
However, this phylogeny included only a small number of
species.
In addition to the question of the relationship between
American and African trypanosomes, 18S rRNA phylogenies of Trypanosomatidae have addressed the question of
the phylogenetic relationships of Trypanosoma vivax. T.
vivax was isolated from a cow in Africa, but its 18S rRNA
sequence is divergent from those of other African trypanosomes [8]. In certain phylogenetic analyses, T. vivax has
clustered with other African trypanosomes [6]; however,
Haag and colleagues [3] excluded it from their analysis
because they believed that its 18S rRNA gene has evolved
more rapidly than those of other Trypanosoma. Stevens
and Rambaut [8] presented evidence of a high rate of evolution in the 18S rRNA gene of T. vivax by comparisons
with an outgroup. However, the outgroup these authors
used consisted of members of the genera Crithidia, Endotrypanum, and Leishmania, all of which belong to the family
Trypanosomatidae. If the genus Trypanosoma does not
constitute a monophyletic group, this is not a valid outgroup, since some Trypanosoma may be closer to these
three genera than are others.

Hughes and Piontkivska [7] conducted the most extensive
analysis to date of 18S rRNA sequences from Trypanosomatidae and Bodonidae; and they applied several different phylogenetic methods. The phylogenetic trees were
rooted with species of Euglenida, which constitute an
appropriate outgroup. Although details of the phylogenetic trees differed depending on the methods used, none
of the phylogenies supported monophyly of the genus
Trypanosoma. Support for paraphyly of Trypanosoma was
strongest in the case of the tree reconstructed by the minimum evolution (ME) method [9], illustrated in Figure 1.
In this tree, the African trypanosomes fell outside a clade
including the American trypanosomes, along with members of Leishmania and seven other genera (Figure 1). The
statistical support for the branch establishing this pattern
was highly significant (Figure 1).
In the same tree, T. vivax clustered apart from the other
African trypanosomes and indeed outside all other
Trypanosomatidae and Bodonidae (Figure 1). However,
statistical support for this pattern was weak (Figure 1). The
phylogenetic tree also did not support monophyly of the
genus Leptomonas (Trypanosomatidae) and did not support monophyly of several genera in Bodonidae (Figure
1).
Figure 2 shows a phylogeny of the same 18S rRNA
sequences reconstructed by the quartet maximum likelihood (QML) method [10]. In this case, the deeper
branches of the phylogeny were largely unresolved. T.
vivax clustered with the African trypanosomes, but the
American and African trypanosomes did not cluster
together (Figure 2). Thus, the QML analysis also did not
support monophyly of the genus Trypanosoma. As in the
ME tree, monophyly of Herpetomonas was not supported
in the QML analysis (Figure 2). Similarly, maximum parsimony (MP) [11] and Bayesian [12] analysis did not support monophyly of Trypanosoma or Herpetomonas [7].
The 18S rRNA phylogeny suggests that the evolution of
host specificity in Trypanosomatidae has been complex. It
seems a plausible hypothesis that the ancestors of kinetoplastids were free-living. Subsequently, it seems plausible
that parasitism on invertebrates evolved, followed by
more complex life cycles involving both an invertebrate
host and either a vertebrate or a plant host. However, the
phylogenies (Figures 1 and 2) suggest that life cycles
involving a vertebrate host have evolved more than once
independently. The ME tree strongly supports (with statistically significant internal branches) the hypothesis that a
life cycle involving a vertebrate host may have evolved
independently in the American trypanosomes, and in the
African trypanosomes (Figure 1).

Because relatively few amino acid sequences for Trypanosomatidae are available at the present time, use of these
sequences to address the question of monophyly of
Trypanosoma reduces in many cases to a choice between
the two topologies illustrated in Figure 3. As in previous
studies [13,14], monophyly of Trypanosoma is supported
when T. cruzi and T. brucei cluster together (Figure 3A).
The most frequently observed alternative topology is one
where T. cruzi clusters with Leishmania (Figure 3B). The
latter topology corresponds to that seen in the ME tree of
18S rRNA genes (Figure 1).

Leishmania, and an outgroup used to root the tree. In (A)
monophyly of Trypanosoma is supported, whereas in (B) it is
not supported.

Protein Phylogenies
Phylogenetic studies of Trypanosomatidae using the
sequences of protein-coding genes or their predicted
amino acid sequences have been comparatively few. Alvarez and colleagues [13] published phylogenies of four
protein-coding genes: ATPase subunit 6, α tubulin,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and trypanothione reductase. Three of these phylogenies could not
address the question of monophyly of Trypanosoma
because no outgroup outside the Trypanosomatidae was
used to root the tree. The α tubulin phylogeny was rooted
with a sequence from Euglena gracilis [13]. This phylogeny supported monophyly of Trypanosoma, in that T. cruzi
clustered with T. brucei and apart from one sequence from
the genus Leishmania [13]. Phylogenetic analyses of heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) by Simpson and colleagues
[14] likewise supported monophyly of Trypanosoma, in
that sequences from T. brucei and T. cruzi clustered
together and apart from sequences of two Leishmania species. Interestingly, these analyses did not support monophyly of Bodonidae [14].

In Table 1, we summarize the results of phylogenetic analyses of 42 protein families using three different methods.
Further details of these analyses, including accession
numbers and alignments, are provided in supplemental
text [see additional file 1 "supplement.txt']. Contrary to
the results of 18S rRNA analyses [7], the majority of these
analyses supported monophyly of Trypanosoma (Table 1).
In 29 families (69%), all three methods supported monophyly of Trypanosoma; i.e., a topology like that of Figure 3A
(Table 1). Furthermore, in 16 of these families, support
for this topology was statistically significant (at the 95%
level) by all three methods (Table 1). An example (the
DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, large subunit family) of
a topology of this form that received highly significant
support is shown in Figure 4a.
In only four families, monophyly of Trypanosoma was not
supported by at least one of the three methods (Table 1).
An example (the THT family) is shown in Figure 4b. In the
phylogenetic trees of the THT family, T. cruzi clustered
with Leishmania rather than with T. brucei (Figure 5b). Furthermore, T. vivax clustered outside all other sequences
from Trypanosoma and Leishmania. This topology was thus
reminiscent of the 18S rRNA ME tree (Figure 1). Interestingly, a T. vivax sequence was available for two of the four
families for which monophyly of Trypanosoma was not
supported by any method (Table 1).
Some of the protein families analyzed are encoded by
multi-gene families in at least some of the species analyzed. In these cases, it was still possible to use these families to address the issue of monophyly of Trypanosoma if
the branch order in the phylogeny made clear when the
gene duplications occurred relative to speciation events.
For example, in the case of S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase, the phylogeny suggested that multiple gene
duplication events occurred after the divergence of the
three species of Trypanosomatidae for which sequences
were available (Figure 5a). In the case of multi-drug resistance proteins, on the other hand, the phylogeny suggested
that there were two separate subfamilies (MDR-A and
MDR-E), which arose by a gene duplication prior to speciation within the Trypanosomatidae (Figure 5b). In this

tral gene without gene duplication); if paralogous genes
are mistaken for orthologous genes, the gene tree is likely
to be very different from the species tree. Finally, there
may be certain biases inherent in methods of phylogenetic reconstruction.

Discussion

For example, it is well known that ME and MP methods
can be prone to the problem known as "long-branch
attraction" (or "short-branch attraction") [15]. This
describes a tendency for long branches to cluster together,
and likewise for short branches to cluster together. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods (including QML and
Bayesian methods) are less prone to long-branch attraction. However, ML methods can be subject to a tendency
that might be called "opposite-branch attraction." In
opposite-branch attraction, short branches tend to cluster
with long branches [15]. In a given data set, if ME and MP
yield a topology consistent with long-branch attraction,
while ML yields a topology consistent with opposite-

Phylogenetic analyses of 42 protein families generally
contradicted the results based on 18S rRNA sequences.
Here we briefly discuss some of the considerations that
may help lead to a resolution of this contradiction. There
are a number of factors that might lead any tree based on
a specific gene or protein to produce a phylogeny that is
not identical to the phylogeny of the organisms sampled
[15]. One such factor is stochastic error; since gene
sequences are finite in length, a given gene may by chance
yield results contrary to the species tree. In the case of gene
families, it is possible that genes that are compared may
not truly be orthologous (i.e., descended from an ances-

branch attraction, it may be impossible to determine
which topology is real and which is artifactual.
It might be argued that the phylogenies not supporting
monophyly of Trypanosoma are explainable by stochastic
error. In support of this interpretation, it might be noted
that only a minority of protein families do not support
monophyly (Table 1). Furthermore, those protein families that show strongest support for monophyly are often
proteins with a large number of residues that are highly
conserved because they play important cellular functions.
Examples include DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, large
subunit (Figure 4a); DNA topoisomerase II; and HSP90
(Table 1). By contrast, the proteins not supporting monophyly include a number that are quite short, such as cyclophilin A and cytochrome b (Table 1). Furthermore, in
those families showing topologies inconsistent with
monophyly, statistical support for that topology tends to
be relatively weak.
On the other hand, it does not appear likely that biases of
phylogenetic methods have played a major role in the
outcome of either 18S rRNA or protein phylogenies. Different methods agreed in not supporting monophyly of
Trypanosoma in the case of 18S rRNA [7]. In the case of
protein phylogenies, all three methods used showed
agreement in 35 of 42 (83.3%) of families. In the case of
the 18S rRNA, comparisons of the pattern of nucleotide
substitution between kinetoplast and outgroup sequences
showed no striking rate differences among different members of the genus Trypanosoma [7]. This observation suggests that long-branch attraction of African trypanosomes
toward the root was probably not a factor in the 18S rRNA
phylogeny [7].
For each of the 42 protein families analyzed here, we computed the mean proportion of amino acid difference (p)
between (1) T. cruzi and available Leishmania species; and
(2) T. brucei and available Leishmania species. The mean p
between T. cruzi and Leishmania (0. 297 ± 0.026 S.E.) was
slightly lower than that between T. brucei and Leishmania
(0. 311 ± 0.025 S.E.); and the difference was statistically
significant (paired sample t-test; P = 0.037). However, this
observation cannot be used to resolve the phylogenetic
issue, since it can be interpreted differently depending on
which phylogeny one accepts. If Trypanosoma is monophyletic (Figure 3A), then this result suggests that there is
a slightly higher average rate of amino acid evolution in T.
brucei than in T. cruzi. On the other hand, if T. cruzi is
more closely related to Leishmania than it is to T. brucei
(Figure 3B), it would not be unexpected that T. brucei proteins are more divergent from Leishmania proteins than
are T. cruzi proteins.

A number of authors have suggested that taxon sampling
– the choice of taxa to include in a phylogeny – may have
a substantial impact on the results of phylogenetic analyses [16–18]. Some recent computer simulations have suggested that the effects of taxon sampling may not be as
large as has been supposed [19], but the random sampling
process used in these simulations may not correspond to
the biased sampling of taxa that often occurs in actual data
sets. Sampling of a diverse array of taxa is expected to
improve the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction primarily because inclusion of numerous taxa is expected to
break up long branches within the tree. Thus, inclusion of
numerous can help to minimize the problems of longbranch attraction and of opposite-branch attraction.
In the case of Trypanosomatidae, it seems plausible that
taxon sampling may have played a role in causing the
different outcomes of 18S rRNA and protein analyses. Of
the 29 data sets for which all methods supported monophyly of Trypanosoma, 25 included representatives of
only a single American trypanosome species (T. cruzi) and
a single African trypanosome species (usually T. brucei)
(Table 1). It may be that the results would have been
different in many of these families if more taxa had been
available.
The role of T. vivax seems particularly important with
regard to the issue of taxon sampling. Two of the three
families for which T. vivax sequences were available did
not support monophyly of Trypanosoma (Table 1). The
THT family (Figure 4b) was particularly interesting in this
regard. In this family, T. cruzi clustered with Leishmania;
and this pattern received strong statistical support with all
methods used (Table 1). Also, it is of interest that five of
the families for which at least one method did not support
monophyly of Trypanosoma included sequences either
from Bodonidae (cytochrome b and cytochrome-c oxidase II) or from other genera of Trypanosomatidae
besides Trypanosoma and Leishmania (ATPase, subunit 6,
DHFR-TS, and trypanothione reductase).

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analyses of 18S rRNA genes from a large
number of species and of much smaller data sets for 42
protein families have failed to provide a consistent answer
regarding the question of whether or not the genus
Trypanosoma is monophyletic. A majority of the protein
data sets supported monophyly of Trypanosoma while 18S
rRNA and a few proteins did not. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the poor taxon sampling in
most of the protein data sets. An accurate phylogeny of the
Trypanosomatidae will require sequencing of proteincoding genes from more species of Trypanosomatidae and
from the related family Bodonidae. It will be particularly
important to sequence from more genes from Trypano-

soma vivax, which seems to be a highly divergent member
of this group. Only when a substantial number of taxa
have been sampled for a large number of genes will it be
possible to resolve the evolutionary relationships of this
important group of parasites.
