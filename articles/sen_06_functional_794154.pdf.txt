Abstract
Background: The abundant data available for protein interaction networks have not yet been fully
understood. New types of analyses are needed to reveal organizational principles of these
networks to investigate the details of functional and regulatory clusters of proteins.
Results: In the present work, individual clusters identified by an eigenmode analysis of the
connectivity matrix of the protein-protein interaction network in yeast are investigated for possible
functional relationships among the members of the cluster. With our functional clustering we have
successfully predicted several new protein-protein interactions that indeed have been reported
recently.
Conclusion: Eigenmode analysis of the entire connectivity matrix yields both a global and a
detailed view of the network. We have shown that the eigenmode clustering not only is guided by
the number of proteins with which each protein interacts, but also leads to functional clustering
that can be applied to predict new protein interactions.

Background
Systems biology is a new frontier for bioinformatics
research, aimed at understanding complex biological systems in cells by integrating interactions between large
numbers of constituent components, including genes,
proteins, and metabolites. Examples of systems biology
research include studies of gene interaction networks [13], regulatory networks[1,4-6], metabolic pathway modeling[7,8], and combinations of these networks[3,9-11]. By
its nature, systems biology studies require highly detailed,
large-scale simulations that are computationally demanding.
Proteins represent the major category of large functional
biomolecules. How proteins interact with one another is

a current subject of many high-throughput studies. The
number of proteins in an organism can reach tens of thousands. Comprehending the functional, developmental,
and regulatory networks comprising these temporal and
spatial protein pairs is a formidable task [12-17] since the
number of their pairwise combinations can reach millions.
Protein clustering in global interaction networks is important for revealing cellular functionality (for example [18]).
Clustering usually involves defining one or more properties among samples and forming individual clusters based
on the similarities of these properties, such as association
with similar biochemical pathways (e.g. metabolic, signaling, regulatory), functional classification, cellular localPage 1 of 13

ization, or evolution (co-evolution, conservation,
phylogeny). Usually, though, a combination of properties
have been utilized [19,20]. Clustering in part serves to
detect incorrect annotations in databases (e.g. GO or
KEGG), or to discover new connections in interaction networks. Clusters based on the topological information[21,22] itself can also be useful to understand the
organizational principles of interaction networks (not
only biological, but also social networks[23]) and to identify highly interconnected proteins with functional significance[24].
Our approach in this paper using connectivity matrix and
subsequent eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition is also
based on the topological properties of the interaction network as a whole. Although significant proteins (in each
eigenvector) form clusters, these clusters differ from those
obtained by methods that are based solely on protein
properties, because they reflect the organizational patterns of the protein interactions themselves based on topological considerations.
In the present study, we show that computational analyses of experimental data on protein networks can lead to
discoveries of new, unexpected relationships, which
emphasizes the importance of the global view of a protein
interaction network.

Results and discussion
In this paper, we have used spectral analysis of graphs
methodology. We earlier applied a similar approach for
protein dynamics analysis using elastic network models
[25-29]. Spectral analysis has also been applied by Vishveshwara and co-workers to the problems of protein structure similarity, protein domain identification, and
backbone clustering [30-35]. They have shown that
important clusters in protein structures can be extracted
from dominant eigenvalues of Kirchhoff's matrix [33],
and that the vector components of the second lowest
eigenvalue of the Kirchhoff's matrix of protein-structure
similarity network leads to successful sub-clustering of
functionally similar proteins [32]. Biological networks
were also extensively studied by Alon, Leibler and coworkers [36-50].
We used the yeast protein interaction data available in the
GRID (General Repository for Interaction Data sets)[51]
database, which is a curated database of physical, genetic,
and functional interactions encompassing many data sets
[52-58]. The database contained 4906 proteins, and
19,037 interactions at the time we start our analysis. Most
recently, this database has been updated by the addition
of 753 new experimental interactions determined by Krogan et al. [59]. Although the whole set of interactions is
not curated and therefore includes some redundancies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/355

with previous entries in the database, it nevertheless
reveal significant new interactions. This has created an
excellent opportunity for us to test the predictive power of
our method. Our preliminary studies based on the previous version of the database (not containing Krogan et al.'s
results) show that our theoretical approach leads to correct predictions of some new protein-protein interactions
provided in Krogan et al.'s data. Details of some of these
successfully predicted cases will be shown here.
Connectivity matrix and its eigenmode analysis
We have converted the pairwise interaction information
obtained from the GRID data into a connectivity matrix C
for subsequent analyses. The individual elements of the
symmetric matrix C are as follows: 1, if two proteins interact; 0, if they do not; and the diagonal elements of the
contact matrix are taken as the negative sum of the other
row (or column) elements. We then applied the standard
method of matrix eigenanalysis used in algebra. Readers
who are non-experts in this field may read a brief tutorial
provided in the Methods section.

We should note that our definition of the diagonal elements of the connectivity matrix as sums of all non-diagonal elements of the given column (or row),
automatically leads to a connectivity matrix that is singular, and must be analyzed through the Singular Value
Decomposition technique. The definition of diagonal elements of the matrix that implies its singularity has some
deep physical meaning when the technique is applied to
protein structures. For example in the case of elastic network models of proteins [25-29], or Gaussian model of
polymer networks [60,61], the zero eigenvalues are associated with the motion of the center of mass of the studied
object.
A similar study of the protein-protein interaction network
in budding yeast by using spectral graph theory has been
published by Bu et al. [62]. Their approach follows the
Gibson, Kleinberg and Raghavan's analysis of Internet
Web topology [63]. There is however a significant difference between our method and theirs, because of the use of
different matrices and completely different methodology
of clustering. The connectivity matrix used by Bu et al. has
the diagonal elements defined as zeros. Such definition of
diagonal elements of the matrix leads to both positive and
negative eigenvalues. In our case, all eigenvalues are
always negative as seen from Fig. 1. Additionally Bu et al.
[62] were looking for quasi-cliques and quasi-bipartites
by applying the Gibson, Kleinberg and Raghavan [63] iteration method, and by using the following criteria: (i) 10%
of top eigenvectors were selected, (ii) each protein had to
interact with 20% of members, and (iii) the minimal size
of quasi-cliques was set to 10. The resulting 48 clusters
had sizes between 10 and 109 and were characterized by

in our analysis of protein structures[25].

significant functional similarity. Our approach is fundamentally different, since in our case, the number of clusters is much greater (4906) and a given protein can belong
to many eigenclusters. The striking similarity between our
results and Bu et al. is, however, that each eigencluster is
characterized by functional similarity of member proteins.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) computations
In this work, we used SVD (since det C = 0) to extract
eigenvalues and eigenvectors instead of alternative clustering methods. The SVD method has been extremely useful in the development of elastic network models[25,26]
used to compute protein motions (i.e. to divide the structure into domains(structure clusters) and in its applications[64], microarrays[65], as well as for analysis of other
complex data[66]. The SVD methodology has been
recently used to study network-level analysis of metabolic
regulation in the human red blood cells [67], detection of
functional connectivities in cortical thickness [68], studies
of transcription modules in large-scale gene expression
data [69], or analysis of large-scale metabolomic networks
[70,71].

We have applied the SVD subroutine available in the
LAPACK[72] library to calculate all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix. This is a straightforward
procedure and requires a relatively modest expenditure of
computing time: All of 4906 eigenvalues (and corresponding eigenvectors) has been computed in 3 hours on
a SGI Origin 2800 with 6GB of RAM. We have found that
all eigenvalues are negative except for 43 zero eigenvalues.
This behavior showing a relatively large numbers of zero
eigenvalues typically implies a network with some

The sorted eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix for the
yeast protein-protein interaction network are shown in
Figure 1. We have used the semi-logarithmic scale for the
plot, where only the abscissa (x-axis) of the plot scales logarithmically, for additional emphasis on the shape of
eigenvalue distribution. The eigenvalue index in Fig. 1
refers to the position in ranking of eigenvalues. After ranking the eigenvalues, we analyzed the corresponding eigenvectors in a more detailed way. We observed that the
number of significant components in a given eigenvector
is always quite small compared to the total number of
components. We defined an ad hoc cutoff value for the systematic classification of these significant components.
After testing different cutoff values, we treated an eigenvector component as significant if its absolute value was
above 0.05. Fig. 2 shows the plots of the rank of the average degree of connectivity of eigenclusters as a function of
the eigenvector index for three cutoff values (a) 0.01, (b)
0.05, and (c) 0.1. The eigenvector indices above 2500 correspond to significant dispersion of the data; therefore, we
will compare the plots for the eigenvectors approximately
up to 2500. In the case of the 0.01 threshold (Fig. 2a) the
left-hand of the plot is very noisy. An increase of threshold
to 0.1 (Fig. 2c) diminishes the noise at the left-hand of the
plot, but unfortunately, it increases noise for the eigenvectors in the range of 1000â2500. The rationale of choosing
0.05 (Fig. 2b) as the threshold value, therefore, is to
reduce the noise not only for the left-hand of the plot, but
also for the rest of the plot. Also, the linear relationship of
the average degree in the eigenclusters in Figure 2b in part
justifies the choice of 0.05 as a threshold.
As an example showing how we have chosen significant
proteins in an eigenvector, Fig. 3 shows eigenvector #21.
In this eigenvector, there are only two points (indicated by
arrows) corresponding to the most significant components. Note that the ith component of the eigenvector corresponds to the ith protein in the connectivity matrix C. In
this way, we may define an eigencluster as a set of proteins
corresponding to the most significant components of a
given eigenvector.
We should note that the same protein(s) may belong to
several different clusters. This is because each cluster corresponds to an eigenvector related to a specific eigenvalue.
Because the whole protein interaction network database
for yeast contains 4906 proteins, there are also 4906
eigenvectors, and corresponding eigenclusters. Since each
cluster contains at least several proteins, every protein
belongs usually to several clusters. This corresponds to the
situation in the normal mode analysis of protein motions,
where a given residue can be involved at once in several

(YHR030C) with a value of 0.055 (shown with arrows).
Interestingly, both of these proteins have 96 neighbors.

The inherent limitations in interaction maps
Interactome datasets contain protein interaction information obtained using a wide range of experimental methods, each providing data with differing reliability due to
the limitations of the method used. One approach to reconcile the reliability of the protein interaction data
obtained using various experimental methods is to assign
weights to the interactions based on either the confidence
of the particular experimental method, or the confirmation of interactions by additional experimental methods
(e.g. ref [19,74]). However, this approach also creates
additional problems: not every protein interaction can be
verified with multiple-experiments due to experimental
limitations, and such weighting schemes might increase
the unreliability of the data.

functionally important motions, which may lead to functional promiscuity of proteins[73], where the same protein can have several different functions.

Classical wet-bench molecular biology approaches that
focus on a single protein interaction are generally accurate. However, when a high-throughput method (e.g. the
yeast two-hybrid assays) is used, the number of wrongly
annotated interactions (i.e. false positives) increases, and
sometimes, even some reported protein interactions cannot be reconciled with the known protein complexes[75].
The exact false positive rates and completeness of these
large-scale experiments are relatively unknown because of
coverage limitations: When Vidal and co-workers[76] created random, exponential, power-law, and truncated normal topologies, they observed that these sampled maps
were not characteristically different from those obtained
using the yeast two-hybrid systems, suggesting that the
current interaction maps may be much less complete than

Page 4 of 13

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:355

we previously thought. The incompleteness of the protein
networks thus biases topology-based analyses[77].
Another limitation in protein networks is that global protein interaction networks present a rather static picture of
protein interactions, neglecting transport and kinetic
aspects. There are two distinct in vivo requirements for
proteins to interact: first, two proteins need be in close
proximity inside the cell; second, the kinetics of this interaction depends on their concentration and diffusion limitations. These limitations are coupled with other cellular
processes regulating gene expression and utilizing embedded positive and negative control loops to ensure cell fitness. In the analysis of protein interaction networks, these
issues are usually overlooked for practical reasons.
Despite these difficulties, computational analyses of protein interaction networks could be extremely useful, for
example, if they can suggest new likely pairings that have
not been yet discovered, or reveal new structural or functional linkages within clusters of proteins from the protein network.
The yeast GRID database: physical, genetic, and
functional interactions
The GRID database used for our calculations contains not
only physical interactions, but also genetic and functional
interactions. We should keep in mind that the available
physical interactions in the database cannot always be
understood in the sense that two molecules are selectively
and specifically binding in vivo. For example, even the
results of the yeast two-hybrid experiments that use hunt
and bait plasmids may suffer from the presence of promiscuous hydrophobic patches on a protein surface, so an
experimentally derived interaction may not correspond
with certainty to an actual in vivo interaction. The definitions for genetic and functional interactions are even less
strict: the interaction data obtained with the synthetic
lethality experiments might instead indicate that two
"interacting" proteins were only in closely related pathways/processes.
The Protein contact matrix decomposition leads to
clusters of proteins having similar numbers of interactions
The rank of the average degree of connectivity for eigenvector clusters is shown in Figure 2 as a function of the
eigenvector index. The rank grows almost linearly up to
approximately the 2200th cluster, which is an interesting
finding in itself. The remainder of the clusters contains
proteins with small numbers of neighbors, and as a result
the presence of noise disturbs the linearity of the plot. Figure 2 reveals that the singular value decomposition
method clusters proteins according to their numbers of
interactions (degree). In the spectral theory it is known
that eigenvectors will cluster nodes with similar degrees of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/355

connectivity. The most crucial discovery in our work is
that nodes that have similar degree of connectivity are
highly likely to interact with each other. This observation
might be possibly used in searches for missing proteinprotein interactions.
Highly non-random nature of interaction clustering
To investigate whether the observed clustering of interactions detected by the eigenanalysis of the GRID database
is random, we have performed a simple numerical experiment. We have compared the distribution of eigenvalues
for three different cases: for the original GRID yeast dataset matrix; for the same matrix but with randomly shuffled interactions; and for the matrix obtained from the
original one by randomly removing 10% of interactions.
The results shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that the
GRID yeast interaction matrix contains a high degree of
non-randomness. The comparison between the original
and the shuffled matrices proves that SVD clustering has a
significantly non-random character. Note that the yeast
protein network, similar to other scale-free networks[78],
presents unusual properties when protein pairs are randomized. For example, in a recent study, Maslov and Sneppen[79] kept the degree for each protein constant, and
randomly shuffled the interacting pairs. After this partial
shuffling, they observed that the connections between
highly and low-connected pairs were more conserved
than the connections between highly connected pairs.
Here, however, we apply full shuffling: random assign-

ments of both degrees and interacting pairs to understand
the dependence of eigenvalue distribution on the topology of the interaction map.
The clusters revealed by the eigenanalysis show order and
contain functional information. This is an important
observation motivating further, more detailed studies.
The distributions of eigenvalues of the original and the
reduced matrices, in contrast to the shuffled matrices, are
quite similar. This proves that despite possible experimental errors and many undiscovered interactions in the
GRID database, the overall shape of the eigenvalue distribution and the resulting interaction clusters are conserved. This conservation can be exploited for predictive
purposes.
Eigenvector cutoff and node connectivities
We have investigated all eigenmodes in our analysis. For
each eigenvector, we have tabulated all the proteins corresponding to components having absolute values above
0.05 and have examined the connectivities among them
as specified by the GRID database. We have also calculated the number of neighbors (degree of connectivity) for
each protein. We found that the protein with the highest
number of protein connections is JSN1 (YJR091C â
names in parentheses are the systematic names, called
sometimes ORF names/numbers) with 288 neighbors.
The protein that has the second highest number of neighbors is YKE2 (YLR200W), with 166 neighbors. In our
analysis, JSN1 is the protein that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue, and YKE2 corresponds to the second smallest eigenvalue (Table 1). For some eigenvalues there are
multiple proteins corresponding to components of the
eigenvector with absolute values larger than the cutoff,
but nonetheless the number of neighbors found for proteins within a cluster varies within a rather narrow range
in comparison with the size of the whole protein interaction network.

A critical question remains: are these clusters formed
solely according to the number of interacting proteins (i.e.
spectral clustering)? Or does the function of proteins
influence clustering (i.e. functional clustering)? The data
we provide in this paper support the functional clustering
hypothesis.
The spectral and functional nature of clusters may not be
exclusive: their detailed nature could drive evolution in
such a manner that the function of the protein is influenced not only by its functional type, but also by the
number of protein neighbors in the whole network in
order to create some vital control mechanisms to support
cellular fitness. We will explore the presence of functional
clustering in the following examples.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/355

Extracting sub-nets with significant interconnections
(Eigenvector #23)
In the case of eigenvector #23, there are 6 significant proteins. These proteins, shown in Table 2 and Figure 5, form
a functionally related network. For example, ARP2
(YDL029W), RVS167 (YDR388W), FKS1 (YLR342W),
CLA4 (YNL298W) are actin-related proteins, whereas
PHO85 (YPL031C) and SMI1 (YGR229C) are involved
with the cell-cycle. Although the annotations given for
these two sets of proteins seem to differ, there is experimental evidence of interactions as shown in Figure 5
implying some functional relationship. There could also
be a functional interaction between proteins ARP2
(YDL029W) and FKS1 (YLR342W), not captured by the
GRID database. The function of ARP2 is annotated in the
GO database as "actin binding" during the process of actin
filament organization. On the other hand, FKS1 has 1,3beta-glucan synthase activity and is a part of the actin cap
in S.cerevisiae[80]. These annotations merely suggest some
interaction via actin; however, further experimentation is
necessary to firmly establish whether a physical interaction can occur between these two proteins.
Sub-nets with few interconnections â are there missing
links? (eigenvector #67)
The cluster for eigenvector #67 has more proteins than do
the clusters for eigenvectors #21 and #23. The significant
proteins in this eigencluster are shown in Table 3 and Figure 6. The numbers of neighbors for each protein in this
cluster lie within the range of 42 and 67. Interestingly, all
the significant proteins corresponding to eigenvector #67
form a cluster with an imperfect star geometry. Note that
decreasing the cutoff value will increase the number of
proteins belonging to the eigencluster, but these new proteins may or may not interact with other proteins.

There is also a question as to whether CSM3 may in fact
be functionally disconnected from the other proteins in
this cluster as suggested in the GRID database. Is it possible to functionally relate CSM3 to other proteins in the
cluster? The function of CSM3 is currently unknown
according to the GRID database, however, it is known that
the protein participates in meiotic chromosome segregation and DNA replication[81]. We cannot reach a definite
conclusion as to whether CSM3 interacts with any other
member of the cluster; the confirmation of these putative
interactions must rely on future experimental studies, but
the present analysis may be useful in suggesting this specific possibility out of the millions of others.
Even small subnets that are not fully connected may have
missing links (eigenvector #4850)
For the upper end of eigenvalue distribution, we have analyzed the case for eigenvector #4850. The connectivities
and GO annotations for this cluster are also shown in Fig.

7. Four significant proteins in this cluster are shown in
Table 4: GPI13, RPS20, URA10, and MNE1. Experimental
evidence given in the GRID database substantiates the
interaction between RPS20 and GPI13. However, GO
annotations do not suggest any relationship between
these two proteins; only the broad category of biosynthesis is the common functional annotation between them.
Following the same line of thought, URA10 might be
interacting with RPS20, GPI13 or MNE1, but GO annotations alone again are insufficient to suggest such possible
interactions, and further experimental evidence is necessary.
Functional modules assemble proteins with similar
functions and biological processes
For each eigenvector of the interaction matrix, we have
analyzed the similarities of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations within a given cluster using FunSpec[82], a webbased tool. Table 5 shows the results of these assignments
for three representative eigenclusters. Most significantly,
almost half of the important proteins in each case can be
assigned to specific protein functional classes or biological processes. Overall, for these cases, significant proteins
are not always restricted to single functions, but rather
encompass a spectrum of functions related to cell organization and biogenesis; cell growth and maintenance; and
nucleic acid metabolism. We also provide the statistical
significances of the functional clustering by including pvalues in brackets in Table 5. The low p-values substantiate the high statistical significance of these proteins'
assignments, and therefore support our view that functionality is an intrinsic, dominant property within these

clusters. However, how can we interpret the functions of
the remaining proteins that could not be assigned to these
functional classes and biological processes? Our aim here
is to identify any similarity in function within these eigenclusters, so a closer look at these clusters is necessary.
We show the sub-network diagram for eigenvector #106
in Figure 8, together with the interactions from the protein-protein data. There are 17 significant proteins: 12 of
them form a rather linear network and 4 proteins (in the
center) remain unconnected. 11 proteins are involved
with the cell organization and biogenesis. The remaining
6 proteins are SWF1 (YDR126W), MUS81 (YDR386W),
UTP22 (YGR090W), KRE11 (YGR166W), HPR5
(YJL092W), and POL32 (YJR043C). The descriptions of
these proteins in Gene Ontology shows that the functions
of most of these proteins (except UTP22, which is a "computationally derived uncharacterized ORF") are indeed
related to cell cycle or DNA processing, although probably
not as statistically significant as for the other 11 proteins:
SWF1 is "essential for spore wall formation"; MUS81 is
"involved in DNA repair and replication fork stability";
HPR5 is "involved in DNA repair"; and POL32 is related
to "DNA synthesis". So, we again see that the proteins in
this sub-cluster are connected and functionally related. In
addition, the inferred connections with TOP1 (topoisomerase I) yield a cluster of five quite closely related proteins in the lower right hand part of the diagram (shown
in reverse color).
Another interesting aspect of this eigencluster shown in
Fig. 8 is related to the unconnected proteins: GO annota-

other proteins in this eigencluster.
Functional modules can be utilized to successfully predict
new interactions
After we obtained the preliminary results, new interactions obtained by Krogan et al. [59] have been added to
the GRID yeast database. Although these additional interactions were not properly curated to ensure non-redundancy, new interaction information proved to be highly
useful to test the predictive power of our clustering methodology. As an example, we focus on the 124th eigenvector
cluster shown in Fig. 9.

tions show that the unconnected NUM1 (YDR150W),
BEM2 (YER155C), and TOP1 (YOL006C) not only take
part in cell organization and biogenesis, but also in cell
cycle defects. Specifically, NUM1 and TOP1 are the 2 proteins of only 12 proteins assigned to nuclear migration.
Therefore, although the presence of interactions is not
experimentally verified for these three proteins, they relate
closely in function to other proteins in their roles in cell
organization. Experimental data indicate that SGS1 can be
essential [83] in the absence of TOP1, so possibly these
two proteins may substitute functionally for one another,
thereby suggesting the additional interactions shown by
dotted lines. Further experimentation is needed to test

In this eigenvector, all significant proteins except TOP1
and ARP1 are connected to each other forming a full interactive cluster according to older GRID yeast data. According to our functional clustering hypothesis, these two
proteins should, however, be connected to the interactive
module of other proteins in the cluster. Was this discrepancy due to limitation of our clustering hypothesis or the
lack of data? The new interaction data from Krogan et al.
[59] have confirmed one of our theoretical predictions,
since the protein TOP1 (YOL006C) is indeed connected
to the interactive module (the new interaction is shown as
a heavy line). This is a clear example of the unifying functionality in clusters, supporting our view that the number
and the topology of interactions of a given protein are
related to its functional role in the cellular processes and
that this functionality can be exploited to predict new
interactions between proteins found within the same cluster. We also expect the protein ARP1 (YHR129C) in Fig. 9
to be connected to this interaction network, a claim yet to
be substantiated by future experiments. There are other
cases from the newest data set[59] that confirm the correctness of our prediction methodology (not shown). We
are expecting that more of these predictions may be confirmed in the future, since the yeast protein interaction
data set is far from being complete. We should note that

The form cluster from eigenvector #67, which has a starThe protein cluster from eigenvector #67, which has
a star-like form. This form offers a major contrast with
that of the cluster shown in Fig. 5, which has more interconnections. CSM3 (YMR048W) is unconnected to the rest of
the proteins in this cluster.

in a recent paper of Uri Alon's group [84] it has been
shown that evolutionarily developed rules of biological
regulation are based on error minimization. It is quite
possible that functional clusters relate to the error minimization problem, by allowing functionally related proteins to replace each other in multi-regulatory systems.

The sub-network diagram of significant proteins and
their interactions for eigenvector #106. Each node represents a protein, and each edge an experimental interaction
in the GRID database. No interactions were indicated for the
four central proteins, but by inference their function should
be related. Experimental data indicate that SGS1 can be
essential[83] in the absence of TOP1, so possibly these two
proteins may substitute functionally for one another, thereby
suggesting the additional interactions shown by dotted lines.

Conclusion
We have analyzed the yeast protein interaction network
by building a connectivity matrix and by applying singular value decomposition to obtain eigenvectors. We have
observed that significant proteins in each eigenvector not
only have similar degrees, but also are most likely to interact with each other. These proteins therefore form "functional clusters", and these clusters can guide future
experiments to predict new interactions. More detailed
interpretations of these networks can be obtained by further studies utilizing information about protein structures. Our method can be especially useful for larger,

be connected to some other members of the cluster.

Methods
Eigenanalysis of matrices
For a given square matrix A of size N Ã N the eigenvalues
Î»i and eigenvectors xi (1 â¤ i â¤ N) of size N correspond to
the solution of the equation

Ax = Î»x

The equation Ax = Î»x represents a concise notation of system of linear equations, that have nontrivial solutions

ynomial of degree N in Î»). For each eigenvalue Î»i (1 â¤ i â¤
N) there is a corresponding eigenvector xi that satisfies the
equation Axi = Î»ixi. If some eigenvalues of the matrix A are
zeros, than the matrix A is singular, its determinant det A
= 0, and generally the inverse matrix A-1 that satisfies the
relation AA-1 = A-1A = IN does not exist. A standard mathematical approach to deal with such cases is the computation of the matrix pseudoinverse by using singular value
decomposition method, which will be discussed in the
next sub-section.
Singular value decomposition
Generally, any matrix A of size M Ã N (with M â¥ N) can be
written as a product

A = UÎVT

where Î is the square matrix of size N Ã N containing nonnegative values Î»1, Î»2, ...Î»N at the diagonal and zeros offdiagonal, and U and V are matrices of sizes M Ã N and N

where IN is the identity matrix of size N Ã N. This is satisfied only for certain values of Î», called eigenvalues, which

The eigenvalues with the smallest indices (that correspond to the largest absolute values of Î», as seen in Fig. 1)
make the largest contributions, and higher indexed eigenvalues contribute successively less (Eq. 6). We clearly see
that the total number of contacts for nodes in the network
(especially for those that have the highest connectivities)
can be well approximated by a relatively small number of
the most dominant eigenvalues, because the majority of
eigenvalues shown in Fig. 1 are close to zero and do not
provide any significant contributions (Eq. 6).
