found at three different positions within the 28S
ribosomal RNA gene of the dematiaceous
Phialophora verrucosa: phylogenetic and
secondary structural implications

Abstract
Background: Group 1 introns (ribozymes) are among the most ancient and have the broadest phylogenetic
distribution among the known self-splicing ribozymes. Fungi are known to be rich in rDNA group 1 introns. In the
present study, five sequences of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) regions of pathogenic dematiaceous
Phialophora verrucosa were analyzed using PCR by site-specific primers and were found to have three insertions,
termed intron-F, G and H, at three positions of the gene. We investigated the distribution of group 1 introns in this
fungus by surveying 34 strains of P. verrucosa and seven strains of Phialophora americana as the allied species.
Results: Intron-F’s (inserted at L798 position) were found in 88% of P. verrucosa strains, while intron-G’s (inserted at
L1921) at 12% and intron-H’s (inserted at L2563) at 18%. There was some correlation between intron distribution
and geographic location. In addition, we confirmed that the three kinds of introns are group 1 introns from results
of BLAST search, alignment analysis and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Prediction of
secondary structures and phylogenetic analysis of intron sequences identified introns-F and G as belonging to
subgroup IC1. In addition, intron-H was identified as IE.
Conclusion: The three intron insertions and their insertion position in the 28S rDNA allowed the characterization
of the clinical and environmental isolates of P. verrucosa and P. americana into five genotypes. All subgroups of
introns-F and G and intron-H were characterized and observed for the first time in both species.

Background
The type species Phialophora verrucosa was described by
Medlar in 1915 [1] when he isolated the fungus from a
human skin disease. The species is ubiquitous and cosmopolitan, and are important plant saprobes as well as
human pathogens. Identification is based on conidial
ontogeny and molecular systematics. Few studies involving molecular genotyping techniques have been
reported for P. verrucosa. A study analyzed restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of mitochondrial

DNA to determine genetic variations and phylogenetic
relationships among P. verrucosa strains [2].
Different molecular typing tools, such as random
amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), RFLP,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and multilocus
sequence typing (MLST), have been developed to provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of fungal pathogens, e.g., Candida albicans [3-5]
and Aspergillus fumigatus [6,7] and medically important
filamentous fungi [8]. However, although the majority of
the reported group 1 intron sequences have been found
in a wide range of fungi (Comparative RNA Web

and phylogenetic relationships of introns from a single
species have been performed in detail. We focused on
group 1 introns within 28S rDNA from P. verrucosa to
evaluate the prevalence of intron polymorphism at the
strain level.
As the first step to determine intron sequence divergence, sequences of 28S rDNA of five representative
strains of P. verrucosa were analyzed to find insertions.
Based on these five sequences, site-specific primers were
designed for use in PCR to detect insertions on other P.
verrucosa and P. americana strains studied, in order to
investigate incidence and distribution of insertions.
Moreover, to characterize the insertions, we analyzed
the phylogeny of the introns found in this study and
predicted their secondary structures.

Results
Nucleotide structure of P. verrucosa 28S sequences and
the characterization intronic insertion

Since the sequence information of the 28S region was
not available in public databases, we sequenced the
28S, including ITS, regions of five representative
strains (Table 1) of P. verrucosa. Alignment of the five
P. verrucosa rDNA sequences revealed the nucleotide
sizes of 18S, ITS and 28S and the location of intron-F
and G insertions (see Table 2 and Additional file 1). It
was found that the sequences were composed of 29
nucleotides of partial 18S, 534-535 nucleotides of ITS
and from 3349 to 4133 nucleotides of 28S regions.
These genomic sequences were deposited at DDBJ and
accession numbers are listed in Table 2. Twenty-five
and two nucleotide substitutions were found within
the ITS and D1D2 regions, respectively. The two bp
substitutions in D1D2 were located at 1036 and 1042
nucleotide positions in the 28S region. These polymorphisms were confirmed in the five strains of P. verrucosa strains except for the two insertions in intron-F
and G at 924 and 2239 positions of the 28S, respectively. None of the insertions were found in the Yao
strain. BLAST comparisons showed with relatively high
homology values that the sequences of both insertions
were individually homogeneous to group 1 introns in
the database. The positions of insertion for intron-F
and G correspond to nucleotide positions 798 and
1921 of Escherichia coli 23S nucleotide sequence
accession number J01695 [10]. In addition, although
these five strains of P. verrucosa did not possess
intron-H, this region of PV28 strain was amplified
with the site-specific primer pair (in Table 3) designed
from the sequences obtained from another experiment
(data not shown) and a 403-nucleotide insert representing intron-H was sequenced. The insertion positions of the intron-H correspond to nucleotide
positions 2563 of E. coli 23S nucleotide sequence.

Survey of insertions of P. verrucosa and P. americana

We amplified intron insertion regions using site-specific
primer pairs we have designed for intron-F (inF-F and
inF-R), intron-G (inG-F and inG-R) and intron-H
(L2563F and L2563R), within the 28S region (Table 3).
These primer pairs were used to screen and detect PCR
amplicons for insertion regions within 34 P. verrucosa
and seven P. americana strains. Amplicons were eluted
in agarose gel to gain information regarding the intron
insertions. No-insertion amplicons for intron-F and
intron-G primers were in the size 142 and185 bps,
respectively. When insertions were present, intron-F primer pair yielded amplicons in the size range from 531
to 533 bps, and intron-Gs in the size 575 or 578 bps.
Moreover, amplicons of about 643 bps for intron-Hs
were also eluted. It was revealed that there were 30
intron-F’s, four intron-G’s and six intron-H’s within P.
verrucosa and only two intron-Fs within P. americana
as shown in Table 1. There was some correlation
between intron distribution of P. verrucosa and geographic location, i.e., intron-Fs were found to have prevalence of 88% in P. verrucosa and intron-Hs were
found specifically in the South American Continent. No
introns were found except for two intron-Fs in P. americana. In addition, the agarose gel profiles allowed us to
characterize genotypes and distribution frequencies of
insertions from P. verrucosa including no-insertion as
shown in Table 1. It was found that occurrence of genotypes F, FG, FH, FGH and N were at 64, 6, 12, 6 and
12%, respectively.
Characterization of the P. verrucosa intronic insertion

RT-PCR was carried out to identify the property of
these insertions, namely, whether they are introns or
unusual extensions incorporated into mature rRNA.
Four representative strains were selected among the 41
strains surveyed. And it was found that two strains (PV1
and PV3) had two introns individually, while the other
two strains (PV2 and PV41) had only one intron as
shown in Figure 1. Insertions of strain PV1 and PV3
were eluted at 142 bps on lane 2 and 3 with intron-F
primer pair, and 185 bps on lane 4 and 5 with intron-G
primer pair, respectively. PV2 and PV41 exhibited 142
bps amplicons with intron-F primer pair as shown on
lane 15 and 16, respectively. An intron-lacking Yao
strain gave 142 and 192 bps amplicons with intron-F
and G primer pairs on lane 10 and 11, respectively. The
other lanes; namely, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 show PCR products of genomic DNA as templates and lane 12 is
negative control. These shows that all the insertions
were excised after cDNA was transcribed, indicating
that they were, as predicted, actively spliced introns.
These results point to the possibility that these insertions are group 1 introns.

Moreover, we analyzed sequences of the spliced
introns to confirm the boundaries of exon and intron
sequences. The last nucleotide of the upstream exon
was confirmed to be a T (U in RNA) and the last
nucleotide of the intron was a G, consistent with group
1 introns [11,12].

Phylogenetic relationships of introns F and G of P.
verrucosa

Sequences of intron-F and G of ten P. verrucosa strains
were sequenced and it was found that DNA sequence
polymorphisms exist among the two introns, i.e., the
intron-Fs ranged in the size from 389 to 391 bps and

the four intron-Gs from 389 to 393 bps shown in Table
2. There were 24 nucleotide substitutions and two deletions/insertions (TH9 strain) within intron-F. There
were five nucleotide substitutions among intron-Gs
from PV1, PV33 and PV34, unlike 36 substitutions
between PV1 and PV3. In addition, Blast search analyses
and alignment lead us to believe that intron-Fs and Gs
from 14 introns belong to subgroup IC1 of group 1
intron.
Fourteen introns from 12 representative strains of P.
verrucosa including Tetrahymena thermophila as outgroup were aligned and used for phylogenetic analyses.
Neighbor-joining (NJ) and Maximum Parsimony (MP)
trees based on the alignment of these intron sequences
are shown in Figure 2. The data set consisted of 466
characters, of which 156 were removed from the MP
analysis due to ambiguous alignment. Of the remaining
310 characters, 201 were variable and 129 were phylogenetically informative for parsimony analysis. Three
major distinct and well-supported clades that had
homologous topology were obtained from both phylogenetic analysis methods showing that all the introns analyzed were undergoing a similar rate of evolution. The
first clade [I] (87% BS support in NJ, 81% in MP) consisted of six strains having intron-F including 3 clinical
isolates, the second clade [II] (57% BS in NJ and 77% in
MP) consisted of 4 strains having intron-F, and the
third clade [III] (100% BS in both trees) consisted of

four G introns. All the introns clustered in clades [I]
and [II] are inserted at the same position L798 those in
clade [III] at the same position L1921. Introns inserted
at the same positions belong to the same clusters and
are considered to be the same subgroups. We observed
that two Venezuelan strains in clade [II] (TH31 and
TH35) included the remnants of homing endonuclease
(HE) gene sequences, which were found to invade into
IC1 introns of the 18S regions in another study (unpublished data).
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the core regions
of the group IC1 introns

Alignment of the core regions consisting of highly conserved sequences of the elements of P, Q, R and S and
the pairing segment P3 and the nucleotide sequences, in
particular, the last two nucleotides GC of the Q element
and the first and second GU nucleotides of the R element [12] (Additional file 2) showed that the introns
belong to group IC1. All core region sequences of
intron-Fs were found to be identical. Two sequences of
core regions termed as intron-G (PV3) and intron-G
(PV1, PV33, PV34) were obtained and added to the NJ
analysis in Figure 3. The NJ tree was constructed based
on the alignment of these core regions consisting of
three representative sequences of P. verrucosa and IC1
of 21 taxa drawn from database using IE intron from
Neoscytalidium dimidiatum as out-group. The

phylogeny of intron-F and G formed separate clades as
shown in Figure 3, and indicated that both introns were
likely acquired independently. Indeed, all intron-Fs were
found to be closely related to Myriosclerotinia ciborium
and Sclerotinia tetraspora introns which are located at
L798. Two sequences of intron-G located at L1921 were
grouped together with 85% BS value and found to be on
the neighboring clade with Cordyceps prolifica intron
located at L1921. The phylogenetic tree suggests that
both introns may be inserted prior to the divergence of
the species formerly belonging to clade [IV] and [V].
Collectively, this tree displays that all introns of P. verrucosa generated by the core regions are members of
subgroup IC1s.
Modeling of the P. verrucosa insertions revealed that they
were group IC1 introns

The predicted secondary structure of the intron-F and G
were constructed as follows. The conserved P, Q, R and S
regions of intron-F (L798) from PV1 were initially aligned
with the same regions from other taxa, and then regions

of P1 through P10 were constructed and added on the
basis of the secondary structure model as shown in Figure
4[A][13]. The P10 region was formed using the internal
guide sequence (IGS). The catalytic core was defined by a
set of structurally conserved elements, including elements
P3 to P8. A G-C pair within P7, i.e. G391-C277 of intronF was assumed to be G-binding positions [14]. Extended
P5 and P9 stems were displayed in the putative structure
of intron-F from PV1. Nine intron-Fs from nine strains
(PV2, 3, 28, 33, 34 and 41 and TH9, 31 and 35) of P. verrucosa were predicted to be the same structures as the putative structure of intron-F derived from PV1 drawn in
Figure 4[A], alternatively, shown in Additional file 3.
These nucleotide variations among intron-F were observed
mainly in the loop and at four positions where one nucleotide of P5a, two of P5.1a and one of P5.2 stem were positioned. The base pairs GU and CG within P6 were formed
in the core region of intron-F [12]. The nucleotides A71,
A72, U73 were located in segments J3/4 of PV1 intron-F
[15-18]. These predictions of secondary structure revealed
that all intron-Fs were IC1 group 1 introns.

The structure of intron-G (L1921) from PV1 was
drawn just as was done for intron-Fs (Figure 4[B]). A GC pair within P7, i.e. G390-C360, was assumed to be the
G-binding positions. The GU-CG pair of P6 and the
AAU in J3/4 was the same as in the intron-F core
region of PV1. This putative intron-G exhibited
expanded regions of P1 and P5. The three intron-Gs of
PV1, PV33 and PV34 were found to be similar among
the three strains. Different features were found in PV3
as shown in Figure 4[C] wherein the sequence of PV3
differed in P1 region among four trains; namely, short
stems in P1b and P1c and small bulge loops of L1 and
L1a (Additional file 4). Moreover, PV3 added P2.0 and
P8c, although the other intron-Gs did not. Prediction
structures in the remaining two introns of PV33 and
PV34 are not shown. Nevertheless, all subgroups of
intron-G were also identified as IC1, based on

of the four strains.
In conclusion, we have identified that the ten intronFs and four intron-Gs of P. verrucosa belong to IC1
group 1 introns.
Characterization of intron-H

Loss of P5abcd domain in derived S788 introns was correlated with inability to self-splice in vitro in a previous
report [19]. Accordingly, we have not confirmed insertion positions of intron-H by RT-PCR. However, we
examined PV-28 strain as the representative strain of
intron-H by analyzing the sequence alignment of the
core region of subgroup IE from other organisms in the
database. Moreover, we predicted the secondary structure of this intron-H as shown in Figure 5. The secondary structure modeling revealed distinctive IE sequences,
namely, the non-expanding P5 and the expanding P9
regions.

Discussion
To date, although a variety of introns from eukaryotes
have been described in the rRNA gene loci of fungi [9],
few introns in Phialophora species have been reported.
An unusually small group 1 intron of 67 bps from the
nuclear 18S rDNA has been described in a splicing
study of Capronia semiimmersa, a teleomorph of P.
americana which is known to be similar to P. verrucosa
[20-22]. These small introns contain only P1, P7 and

Figure 5 Diagrams for predicted secondary structure of intronH from PV28 strain. Capital letters indicate intron sequences and
lowercase letters indicate flanking exon sequences. Arrows point to
the 5’ and 3’ splice sites.

P10 elements, because most of the core regions common in almost all other group 1 introns are missing.
Four intron sequences have been reported or registered
in dematiaceous fungi; namely, 283 bps within the small
subunit (SSU) rDNA from Cadophora gregata f. sp.
adzukicola [23], 339 bps within SSU from Cadophora
finlandica (accession number: AF486119), 456 bps
within the large subunit (LSU) rDNA from C. semiimmersa [24] and 397 bps within LSU from Cladophialophora carrionii [24]. These introns have not been
subjected to secondary structure analysis. Therefore, we
aimed to identify the introns that we found in this study
and to investigate the prevalence and phylogenetic relationships of 28S group 1 intron at the intra-species level.
The intron-F, G and H in the 28S rDNA of both species were found to belong to two subgroups, IC1 and IE,
of group 1 intron. IC1 at L798 is the most common
insertion position as shown in Table 1 and in the CRW
website, and insertions at L1921 and L2563 were found
comparatively in the database. The loss of most of P5 in
the secondary structure of intron-H is believed to be a
relatively recent evolutionary event [19]. The three
insertions possessed all the ten elements (P1-P10) common in group 1 introns. Enzymatic core regions are
especially well conserved in primary and secondary

structures, as described in previous reports [12,25], suggesting that they were derived from a common origin.
Peripheral elements of the core have various forms and
these variations have been used to subdivide introns
into five major subgroups [17,26]. In this study, the phylogeny obtained in Figure 2 and 3 showed that all IC1
introns inserted into P. verrucosa have been surviving
with base substitution/insertion/deletion, especially
among peripheral elements as a consequence of some
events after the individual insertion of IC1 at L798 and
L1921, and may have spread by homing (e.g., [27-29]) or
reverse splicing [30-32].
Comparisons of intron-F and G indicate comparative
high sequence divergence within P. verrucosa wherein
the sequence similarity among intron-F’s was 94%, and
99% among intron-G’s with the exception of PV3 and
90% among all the four intron-G’s. The phylogenetic
relationships among both introns were very similar to
each other (Figure 2). These results suggest that they
have diverged from a common origin.
Thirty isolates of P. verrucosa and two isolates of P.
americana possessed intron-F, G and H either individually or as a combination of these introns. Genotypes
based on the combinations of presence or absence of
introns, type and position of insertions were established
to discriminate among the isolates surveyed. As a result,
five genotypes; namely, F, FG, FH, FGH and N were
identified, as shown in Table 1. Type-F was isolated in
all the countries where the strains used in the study.
Intron distribution was found to have some correlation
with geographic location, albeit the number of isolates
used was small. For example, most of the Chinese isolates except for Yao-strain had only type-F. Isolates
from South American continent had slight tendency to
have an intron-H, wherein they were either type-FH or
FGH. Intron-G’s occurred as type-FG in the clinical isolates of Japan and China and as two type-FGH’s in soil
isolates of Brazil. In addition, according to an interpretation from a different viewpoint, insight into possible
correlation of geographic origin among introns from P.
verrucosa strains have emerged from these insertion
position results, namely, the spread of L798 among a
large number of P. verrucosa isolates and the existence
of L1921 and L2563 that coexist with the other intron
insertions among the species and strains that have lost
introns. L1921 positions are only seen in two clinical
isolates from Japan and China and two isolates from
Brazilian soil. The L2563 position seems to be specific
to the South American continent in six environmental
isolates. The possible correlation tendencies shown in
our results have also been reported in previous studies
described below. For example, group 1 intron CgSSU
was found in the SSU rDNA of deuteromycetes mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum, and the intron-

Takizawa et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/94

positive isolates occurred mainly in North America and
Europe and negative isolates in Western, Midwestern
and Southern North America [33]. In other studies on
intron distribution from a single species, four different
group 1 intron combinations within LSU rDNA from
entomopathogenic hyphomycete Beauveria bassiana
were divided into 13 genotypes to investigate distribution frequencies in the population and it was found that
there was a tenuous correlation with geographic origin
or insect host species [34]. Moreover, M. Márquez, et al.
have found three intron insertion positions within LSU
rDNA and established seven genotypes among 26 biocontrol isolates for entomopathogenic anamorphic
Metarhizum anisopliae [35].
Meanwhile, we found that five isolates of P. americana
had no introns, even though two isolates were detected
as type-F. Intron-loss strains might have been lost from
taxa possessing intron-F in the common ancestor of the
species during its evolution [36]. Further, the lateral
transfers appear to have been rare events in P. americana. The fact that intron-F was found in almost all isolates of P. verrucosa, it is believed that intron-F may be
specific to P. verrucosa. To confirm this hypothesis,
more isolates are needed in the survey and the relationships of the clinical background of the individual
patients and the ecological niches of saprobic isolates
must be investigated. Further analysis of genotypes
within the complete nuclear rDNA gene must be done
and the presence of HE gene sequences must be analyzed since they provide key information on intron phylogeny and origin. This study is a first step in the study
of introns in P. verrucosa and P. americana.

Conclusion
The three insertions within 28S rDNA of clinical and
environmental isolates of P. verrucosa and P. americana
allowed us to characterize them into five genotypes
using agarose gel electrophoresis patterns. The two
insertions, namely, intron-F and G, were characterized
as subgroup IC1 by subjecting them to RT-PCR, secondary structure and phylogenetic analysis to determine
whether they are true introns, to characterize subgroup
and to infer evolutionary relationships, respectively.
Another insertion, intron-H, was characterized as an IE
intron using BLAST search and by prediction of secondary structure. Furthermore, we also developed a system
to classify genotypes based on the presence and distribution of group 1 introns and the distributions as DNA
polymorphism among the two species.
Methods
Fungal strains and culture conditions

We studied 34 P. verrucosa strains including of five clinical isolates as shown in Table 1. Seven P. americana

Page 9 of 12

strains including of three clinical isolates were used as
allied species. All the isolates were preserved by using
L-drying method and were sub-cultured on potato dextrose ager (Difco) slant before extraction of genomic
DNA. For an extraction of total RNA, liquid cultivation
was performed in 50-ml Erlenmyer flask containing 20
ml of potato dextrose medium at 30°C for seven days
on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm.
Extraction of genomic DNA and total RNA

DNA extraction was performed using an InstaGene
Matrix extraction kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor
revisions. Particularly, cells were ground with micro pestle before incubation at 56°C. The extracted DNA was
then diluted 1:10 and used as template DNA for PCR
amplification.
Total RNA was extracted by using the Nucleic Acid
Purification Kit MagExtractor (TM -RNA- TOYOBO,
Osaka, Japan). The following procedures were done
before carrying out the manufacturer’s instructions.
Approximately 20 mg (wet weight) of mycelia were
washed with water and then rinsed with Schizosaccharomyces pombe spheroplast buffer (20 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.6), 50 mM EDTA and 0.9 M
sorbitol). This was followed by addition of 100 μl of buffer plus 20 units of Lyticase (L-5263; SIGMA, MO,
USA) and 0.01 units of Chitinase (C-7809; SIGMA, MO,
USA). The suspension was mixed by vortexing, incubated at 37°C for 30 min and added with 700 μl of a
lysis-adsorption solution including 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and pricked with a pipette tip until the solution
became viscous. The extracted RNA was treated with
RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN). Approximately more
than 20 ng/μl RNA was obtained.
PCR amplification and sequencing analysis

A primer walking method was performed to obtain the
sequences of the entire 28S rDNA region including ITS.
PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
TaKaRa LA Taq (TAKARA Bio Inc, Sigma, Japan) were
used depending on the amplification sizes. The PCR
conditions for PCR Master Mix consisted of denaturation for 4 min at 95°C, followed by 30 amplification
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at
primer-dependent temperatures based on Tm values for
1 min and extension at 72°C for 1.5 min, and then 1
cycle of 5 min at 72°C. For TaKaRa LA Taq consisted of
denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 98°C for 5 sec, annealing at primerdependent temperatures for 30 sec and extension at 72°
C for 2 min, and then 1 cycle of 72°C for 10 min. PCR
products were purified with SAP-IT (USB Corporation,
Cleveland, OH, USA) and then sequenced with primers

listed in Table 2 and the BigDye Terminator v3 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) on an ABI Prism 3130 × l Sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Hitachi). The nucleotide sequences were
determined from both strands. To determine base substitutions and intron insertion positions, sequences were
aligned by using the alignment function of GENETYX
ver. 9.1.1 (GENETYX COOPERATION, Tokyo, Japan).

GENE Co., LTD., Japan). Transconjugants were selected
on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicilin and 40
μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). The presence of the expected insert was
confirmed by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. The
inserts were sequenced with T7 (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3’) and M13 reverse primers (5’AGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGA-3’).

Determining incidence of introns by agarose gel

Phylogenetic analysis of introns from P. verrucosa

The extracted DNA was used as template DNA for the
amplification of the insertion regions (intron-F, G and
H). PCR was performed individually using PCR Master
Mix and the primer pair inF-F and inF-R for intron-F
and inG-F and inG-R for intron-G which we newly
designed. Primer pair L2563F and L2563R for intron-H
was designed based on sequences of exon and group 1
intron on CRW website, because the intron was not
inserted in the five representative strains used. PCR conditions were the same as described above and the resulting DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on
a 2% agarose gel (NuSieve® 3:1 Agarose, TAKARA Bio
Inc, Sigma, Japan) in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Presence
or absence of individual intron was listed as positive/
negative in Table 1. In addition, the strains were categorized into five intron types; namely, F, FG, FH, FGH
and N on the basis of the intron insertions.

Nucleotide sequences were aligned using the BioEdit
program version 7.0.9.0 [37]. For phylogenetic analysis,
alignment gaps were treated as missing data and ambiguous positions were excluded from the analysis. NJ analysis [38] as distance matrix method and MP analysis as
character state method were carried out using PAUP
4.0b10 [39]. For NJ analysis, the distances between
sequences were calculated using Kimura’s two-parameter model [40]. MP analysis was undertaken with the
heuristic search option using the tree-bisection-reconstruction (TBR) algorithm with 1000 random sequence
additions to find the global optimum tree. All positions
were treated as unordered and unweighted. The maximum tree number was set at 10 4 . To estimate clade
support, the bootstrap procedure of Felsenstein [41] was
employed with 1000 replicates in both MP and NJ analyses. Bootstrap (BS) values higher than 50% are
indicated.

RT-PCR and colony sequencing

The RT-PCR from total RNA was performed using a
SuperScript ™ III One Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten
microliters of RNA was used for a 50 μl reaction mixture consisting of 25 μl of ReactionMix, 2 μl of SuperScript™ III RT/Platinum Taq Mix, 1 ul of each primer
inF-F (10 μM) and inF-R (10 μM) for RT-PCR of
intron-F and 11 μl of autoclaved distilled water. For RTPCR of intron-G, primer pair inG-F and inG-R was
used. RT-PCR was carried out in the following conditions: cDNA synthesis at 55°C for 30 min, denaturation
at 94°C for 2 min, and PCR amplification at 40 cycles of
94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 68°C for 1.5 min
and final extension at 68°C for 5 min. Amplification
products were eluted in 3.5% polyacrylamide gel in trisacetate-EDTA buffer on an electrophoresis run condition of 100 V for 30 min and followed by 75 V for 25
min, together with genomic DNAs amplified with the
same primer pairs as control (shown in Figure 1).
The RT-PCR products were purified with the SUPRECPCR (TAKARA Bio Inc, Sigma, Japan) and ligated into
the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). Plasmids were transformed into E. coli competent cells (ECOS TM Competent E. coli, JM109, NIPPON

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of core sequences

For the comparison with highly conserved sequences of
subgroup IC1 from 20 taxa, sequences of elements of P,
Q, R and S and the pairing segment P3 were obtained
from DDBJ database (accession numbers shown after
sample name in Figure 3). These regions do not include
IGS, because the sequences in the upstream region of
intron insertion positions do not share a common IGS
[42]. The NJ tree was constructed after alignment of all
the sequences, which ranged from 57 to 60 bps (Additional File 2). Insertion positions are shown after the
sample ID or accession number. The insertion position
numbering of the taxa refers to the 23S nucleotide
sequence of E. coli [10] except for the Exophiala calicioides which is based on the 18S of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taxonomic affiliation was indicated by letters in
parentheses; namely, [A], Fungi/Ascomycota; [Ac],
Acanthamoebidae; [C], Chlorophyta; [H], Heterolobosea;
[M], Mycetozoa and [R], Rhodophyta.
Secondary structure modeling

The secondary structures are proposed from modeling by
Michel et al. [14,26,43] and computational analysis was
done using the Mfold web server available at http://
mfold.rna.albany.edu/[44] and GENETYX Ver.9 software,

Takizawa et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:94

with manual adjustments. The pairing segments of P1P10 locations are indicated in Figure 4 and 5. Moreover,
the model was manually optimized based on previous
studies of group 1 introns [17,45-47].
