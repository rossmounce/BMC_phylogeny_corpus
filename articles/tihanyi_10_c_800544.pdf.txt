Abstract
Background: Hox genes play a central role in axial patterning during animal development. They are clustered in
the genome and specify cell fate in sequential domains along the anteroposterior (A-P) body axis in a conserved
order that is co-linear with their relative genomic position. In the soil worm Caenorhabditis elegans, this striking rule
of co-linearity is broken by the anterior Hox gene ceh-13, which is located between the two middle Hox paralogs,
lin-39 and mab-5, within the loosely organized nematode Hox cluster. Despite its evolutionary and developmental
significance, the functional consequence of this unusual genomic organization remains unresolved.
Results: In this study we have investigated the role of ceh-13 in different developmental processes, and found that
its expression and function are not restricted to the anterior body part. We show that ceh-13 affects cell migration
and fusion as well as tissue patterning in the middle and posterior body regions too. These data reveal novel roles
for ceh-13 in developmental processes known to be under the control of middle Hox paralogs. Consistently,
enhanced activity of lin-39 and mab-5 can suppress developmental arrest and morphologic malformation in ceh-13
deficient animals.
Conclusion: Our findings presented here show that, unlike other Hox genes in C. elegans which display regionspecific accumulation and function along the A-P axis, the expression and functional domain of the anterior Hox
paralog ceh-13 extends beyond the anterior region of the worm. Furthermore, ceh-13 and the middle Hox paralogs
share several developmental functions. Together, these results suggest the emergence of the middle-group Hox
genes from a ceh-13-like primordial Hox ancestor.

Background
One of the most striking shared developmental mechanisms in divergent animal phyla is the patterning of the
anteroposterior body axis by evolutionarily conserved
homeodomain-containing transcription factors encoded
by Hox genes [1-5]. Properties of the Hox genes include
clustering in the genome, a conserved order within the
cluster, a co-linear arrangement of their genomic position
and functional domain in the body, and a hierarchy of
action between the adjacent Hox paralogs. In C. elegans,
the Hox cluster consists of six Hox genes that represent

three paralogous groups: one anterior Hox gene, ceh-13
(C. elegans homeobox-containing gene), two middlegroup paralogs, lin-39 (lineage defective) and mab-5
(male abnormal), and three posterior paralogs, egl-5 (egglaying defective), nob-1 (no backside) and php-3 (posterior
Hox gene paralog) (Figure 1) [6-14].
The C. elegans Hox genes differ in some characteristics
from their counterparts in other animal phyla. For example, embryonic patterning and viability in C. elegans
require only the anterior and the two most posterior Hox
genes; triple loss-of-function (lf) mutant worms defective
for lin-39, mab-5 and egl-5 can develop into fertile adults
[3,15], raising interesting questions about the evolutionary status of these dispensable Hox genes. They control
various developmental processes, including the migration

of Q neuroblasts, cell fusion in Pn.p cell lineages, cell fate
specification during vulval patterning, and programmed
cell death [11,12,16-18].
Another unique feature of the C. elegans Hox genes is
the unusual position of the anterior Hox paralog ceh-13,
the nematode counterpart of Drosophila labial and
mammalian HoxB1 [9,13,14]. ceh-13 is located downstream of the middle Hox gene lin-39, the worm ortholog of Drosophila Deformed/Sex comb reduced and
mammalian HoxD4 (Figure 1), thereby representing a
break in co-linearity. The functional consequence of this
unusual genomic organization and the role of ceh-13 in
development remain largely unknown.
sw1, a strong lf mutation in ceh-13, disrupts normal
patterning of the anterior body part and arrests development during embryonic or early larval stages [14].
However, a small percent of ceh-13(sw1) mutants are
able to develop into fertile adults, suggesting that this
gene shares developmental roles with (an)other Hox
paralog(s). Regardless of the anterior manifestation of
the pleiotropic Ceh-13 mutant phenotype, ceh-13 displays a complex, highly dynamic expression pattern,
which involves several different cell lineages all over
the body, even in the developing tail region [13,19,20].
These data raise the intriguing possibility that the
influence of ceh-13 on cell fate specification may not
be restricted to the anterior body part, and its

functional domain may overlap with that of other Hox
paralogs.
The proper function of HOX proteins requires TALE
homeodomain proteins [21,22]. In C. elegans, these
HOX cofactors are encoded by ceh-20 and unc-62
(uncoordinated), the orthologs of Extradenticle/Pbx and
Homothorax/Meis/Prep genes, respectively [23-26].
Interestingly, the function of CEH-20 and UNC-62 is
partly independent of LIN-39 and MAB-5 in regulating
cell migration and fusion as well as vulval cell fate specification in the mid- and posterior body regions
[23,25,26]. This indicates a potential role for (an)other
Hox gene(s) in the control of these developmental
processes.
In this study we have implicated a role for ceh-13 in
positioning Q neuroblasts and the fusion process of Pn.
p cells. Unexpectedly, the function of ceh-13 in these
paradigms was obvious along the entire anteroposterior
body axis. In addition, vulva patterning also appeared to
be affected in ceh-13 mutant animals. Consistently, we
found that the expression domain of ceh-13 overlaps
with those of the other Hox paralogs, and ceh-13 interacts with lin-39 and mab-5 as the elevated levels of
which are able to suppress the embryonic and early larval lethal phenotype of ceh-13 lf mutants. These findings
suggest that in the nematode lineage the middle Hox
genes emerged from a primordial ceh-13-like Hox
paralog, and that the ancestor of this anterior Hox paralog might have given raise the primitive Hox cluster
through tandem gene duplications during an early phase
of animal evolution.

Results
ceh-13 is required for the positioning of Q neuroblasts

Positioning of Q cell descendants provides an excellent
paradigm to study how Hox genes affect cell migration
during development. The QR and QL neuroblasts are
born by the division of the Q cell in the posterior body
part of the animal, and initially located directly opposite
to each other. During the early larval stages, QR and
then its descendants migrate toward the anterior, while
QL and its descendants migrate posteriorly (Figure 2A)
[27]lin-39 and mab-5 control the migration of these
cells in a concerted manner [11,12]. The migration of
QR and its descendants requires lin-39 activity: lin-39
deficiency blocks the migration of these cells prematurely at various positions. The migration of QL and its
descendants is influenced by mab-5. Inactivation of
mab-5 renders these cells to be incapable of migrating
posteriorly; instead, they migrate toward the head. Conversely, a gain-of-function (gf) allele of mab-5, e1751,
causes QR, which normally moves anteriorly, to migrate
toward the tail (Figure 2B, C) [11,12]. The migration of
Q neuroblasts is also influenced by ceh-20 and unc-62,

which are predicted to function as cofactors of lin-39
and mab-5 in these processes. However, lin-39(-)ceh-20
(-) and mab-5(-)ceh-20(-) double mutant animals exhibit
more severe defects in the migration of these cells than
either of these single Hox mutants [25]. This suggests a
role for CEH-20 in this cell migration paradigm which
is independent of LIN-39 and MAB-5.
To examine whether CEH-13 influences cell migration
in the Q cell lineage, we monitored the final position of
two Q descendants, QR.paa (AVM) and QL.paa (PVM),
in wild-type versus ceh-13 lf mutant background. To
visualize these cells, we used an integrated green fluorescent protein- (GFP) labeled mec-7 reporter [28], which
is expressed only in these two neurons within the Q
lineage (Figure 2A). We found that in ceh-13(sw1)
mutant animals, AVM stops to migrate toward the anterior prematurely (Figs. 2B, C and 3). As a result, AVM

was often located close to the central body region. This
mutant phenotype was expressed with almost a full
penetrance in ceh-13(sw1) mutant larvae. A similar Q
cell lineage-specific migration defect was observed in
ceh-13(ok737) mutants too (Figure 2B). We next assayed
cell migration in the QL lineage in ceh-13 deficient
background. To our surprise, defects in QL lineage positioning were also evident in ceh-13(sw1) mutant animals:
PVM was located improperly in 22% (19 out of 86) of
the animals examined (Figs. 2B, C and 3). In the affected
larvae, this cell was unable to migrate to its normal final
position. Although this migration defect was partially
penetrant, we conclude that the functional domain of
ceh-13 in controlling Q cell migration overlaps with that
of lin-39 and mab-5.
The mab-5(e1751gf) mutation reverses the direction of
AVM migration, but does not affect PVM migration
[11,12]. We also analyzed the position of Q cell descendants in ceh-13(sw1)mab-5(e1751gf) double mutant animals, and found that AVM is located slightly posterior
to the position where QL and QR are normally born
(Figs. 2B, C and 3). Thus, ceh-13 and mab-5 may have
opposite effects on this particular cell migration event,
and the combination of the two mutations may inhibit
the ability of AVM and its progenitors to migrate to
their normal position.
Normal positioning of AVM also requires mig-13 (cell
migration abnormal), which codes for a novel transmembrane receptor [29]. The expression of mig-13 is restricted
to the anterior body part by the inhibition of mab-5:
mig-13 is normally active in certain cells of the ventral
nerve cord (VNC) in the anterior half of the L1 stage larvae, but becomes ectopically expressed in the posterior
body part in mab-5 lf mutants [29]. Since ceh-13 is also
expressed in the VNC at this stage [14], we asked whether
ceh-13 interacts with mig-13 to control AVM migration.
We found that AVM displays more severe positioning
defects in ceh-13(sw1); mig-13(mu294) double mutant animals than in either of the single mutants (Figure 4A-C). In
a portion of these double mutants, AVM was positioned
even toward the posterior (Figure 4A-C). In good accordance with these results, mig-13::gfp expression was completely abolished in ceh-13 mutant larvae (data not
shown). In some ceh-13 deficient larvae, even the pharyngeal-intestinal valve cells, which always show a strong mig13 expression throughout all larval stages in wild-type
background, failed to express mig-13 (Figure 4D). These
data raise the possibility that ceh-13 may control the anterior migration of cells in the Q lineage via influencing
mig-13 activity. In summary, we conclude that ceh-13 is
required for the normal positioning of both QR and QL
descendants. The regulation of cell migration in the
posterior part of the body by the anterior-like Hox gene
ceh-13 was somehow unexpected.

ceh-13 regulates the fusion process of Pn.p cells in both
anterior and posterior body parts

The fusion of certain epidermal blast cells with the
hypodermal syncytium hyp7 represents another example,
in which the distinct and combined regulatory functions
of lin-39 and mab-5 have been well characterized [11,12].
At the early L1 larval stage, the ventral epidermis is composed of 12 ectodermal precursor cells, termed P(1-12),

Page 6 of 14

which are located in a row along the ventral surface of
the animal (Figure 5A) [27]. At the late L1 stage, the
P cells divide once, generating the Pn.a neuroblast and
Pn.p epidermal daughters. Soon after their birth, some of
the Pn.p cells fuse with hyp7, while the others remain
unfused. The fusion pattern of Pn.p cells is established in
a sex-specific manner, and regulated by lin-39 and mab5. In wild-type hermaphrodites, the central P(3-8).p cells

are prevented from undergoing fusion by lin-39. The
fusion pattern of these cells is also influenced by CEH-20
[25]. In hermaphrodites defective for this HOX cofactor,
P(3-8).p and some additional anterior and posterior Pn.p
cells remain unfused. The fusion defective phenotype of
ceh-20 mutants is obvious even in lin-39 null mutant
background [25]. This is particularly interesting since in
lin-39 single mutant animals each Pn.p cell fuses with
hyp7 [11,12].
To examine whether ceh-13 is also involved in this cell
fusion event, we scored the number of unfused Pn.p
cells in ceh-13 mutant animals. The lack of the fusion
process was identified by an integrated ajm-1::gfp (apical
junction molecule) reporter that is specific for a component of adherens junctions and thus outlines unfused
cells [30]. We found that in addition to the central
P(3-8).p cells, several anterior and posterior Pn.p cells
remain unfused in ceh-13(sw1) hermaphrodites: 8% of
P2.p, 23% of P9.p and 19% of P10.p (N = 200) were
unable to fuse with hyp7 in the mutant larvae examined
(Figure 5B, C). ceh-13(ok737) mutants displayed similar
defects in cell fusion (Figure 5B, C). Thus, the effect of
ceh-13 on Pn.p fusion is not restricted to the anterior
body part, but also extended to cells located in the posterior body region. The cell fusion defective phenotype
of ceh-13 mutant larvae indicates that ceh-13 promotes
the fusion of Pn.p cells with hyp7. We conclude that
ceh-13 acts in an opposite way to LIN-39 to control this
process. Interestingly, the fusion pattern of Pn.p cells in
ceh-13 mutants highly resembles to that found in
animals defective for ceh-20 [25]. These results suggest
that ceh-13 is also involved in establishing the proper
number of unfused Pn.p cells in hermaphrodites.
mab-5 does not affect Pn.p fusion in hermaphrodites
[11,12]. However, the mab-5 gf mutation e1751 was able
to restore the fusion defect of Pn.p cells in ceh-13
mutant background (Figure 5C). In the ceh-13(sw1)mab5(e1751gf) double mutant animals that morphologically
looked normal, the fusion pattern of the Pn.p cells
appeared unaffected. Upon these results we suggest that
ectopically or excessively expressed MAB-5 can substitute CEH-13 in cell fusion control.
ceh-13 influences vulval patterning

In the C. elegans hermaphrodite, the vulval tissue through which the animal lays embryos - develops from
a subset of six Pn.p epidermal cells [P(3-8).p] called vulval precursor cells (VPCs), which lie ventrally along the
anterior-posterior axis [27,31]. Although each VPC has
the potential to adopt an induced vulval fate, normally
only the three central VPCs, P(5-7).p, undergo vulval
induction. The non-induced VPCs, P(3,4,8)p, divide
once and their daughters fuse with hyp7. Descendants
of the induced VPCs form eventually the matured vulval

Page 7 of 14

structure. The fate of VPCs is determined by the combined effect of multiple genetic cascades, including the
Ras, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, signaling via
TRA-1 (sexual transformer) that is similar to the Drosophila Cubitus interruptus and mammalian GLI(Glioma-associated) like proteins, and three redundant
synMuv (for synthetic Multivulva) pathways grouped
into classes A, B and C [31-34]. Under hyperinducing
conditions, P(3,4,8).p can ectopically adopt induced vulval fates, which manifests in multiple vulval protrusions
(Multivulva - Muv - phenotype). When vulval induction
fails to occur, no VPC adopts vulval fate which renders
the animal to exhibit a Vulvaless (Vul) phenotype.
Both lin-39 and mab-5 affect vulval fate specification
[34,35]. Furthermore, VPC induction in ceh-20 mutants
can occur even in the complete absence of LIN-39 [25].
This knowledge prompted us to examine vulval morphology in ceh-13 mutant escapers. We found that these
animals are Muv with a relatively low penetrance (<1%,
N = 950). The affected adults had an extra vulval protrusion close to the normal vulva (Figure 6A). This phenotype is similar to that observed in lin-39 hypomorphic
and ceh-20 lf mutants [26], suggesting that these factors,
including ceh-13, have a similar role in VPC specification. To further assess this possibility, we monitored the
effects of ceh-13 lf mutations on vulval induction in synMuv AB double mutant background. Single mutations
in either of the SynMuv A or B pathway do not affect
vulval development, whereas simultaneous inhibition of
the two pathways renders the animals to be Muv [32].
Like lin-39 deficiency [36], inactivation of ceh-13 significantly suppressed vulval induction in synMuv AB double
mutant background (Figure 6B). Thus, ceh-13 endorses
VPCs to adopt an induced vulval fate (note that this
complex vulval morphology of ceh-13 lf mutants - i.e.,
an extra vulval protrusion that is due to hypomorphic
mutations and suppression of vulval induction in synMuv AB double mutant background by lf mutations - is
also characteristic for lin-39 deficient animals [26]). It
may exert this function by directly controlling some target “vulval” genes. Alternatively, the absence of ceh-13
activity may alter the expression domain of the middle
Hox paralogs, especially that of lin-39, thereby influencing vulval patterning. Nevertheless, ceh-13 has obvious
developmental roles in the mid-body region as well.
The expression domain of ceh-13 overlaps with that of
the other Hox paralogs

Although ceh-13 is most similar to the anterior Hox
orthologs, e.g., Drosophila labial and mammalian
HoxB1, its functional domain is obvious all along the
anteroposterior body axis (see results above). Indeed, a
transcriptional fusion ceh-13::gfp reporter, pMF1, has
been previously reported to be expressed in many

lin-8 and lin-15A are class A synMuv genes, while lin-53 and lin-15B are class B synMuv genes. Single mutants defective in either of the synMuv A
or B pathways have normal vulval morphology (data not shown), whereas synMuv AB double mutant are Muv. Wild-type animals actually have
no vulval protrusion (their normal vulval structure is considered as 1 protrusion in the figure).

different cell lineages even from the mid- and posterior
body parts during development [20,13,14]. To understand better this unusual - i.e., non-colinear - activity
domain of ceh-13, we examined its expression in relation to that of the other Hox paralogs (Figure 7). To
this end, we first generated gfp-labeled translational
fusion reporters for C. elegans Hox genes whose expression has not been determined by such a system (see the
Methods). The reporters we generated contain at least
9-10 kb large upstream regulatory sequences and almost
the entire coding regions, and were able to partially rescue the corresponding mutant phenotype (data not
shown). In two-fold stage embryos, nob-1, php-3 and
egl-5 each were expressed in the tail region, as expected
or previously reported (Figure 7A). Therefore, these posterior Hox paralogs, similar to their Drosophila and
mammalian orthologs, are active in the tail region exclusively. In good agreement with previous results [8,12],
LIN-39 accumulated in the mid- and posterior body
region, whereas mab-5 was expressed in the posterior
half of the body at the two-fold embryonic stage (Figure
7A). The expression of ceh-13, however, was evident in
each of the main body domains, which is consistent
with its functional properties. Based on these results, we
suggest that ceh-13 is a unique C. elegans Hox gene in
that it is expressed and functions in a non-colinear way.
Its expression domain overlaps with those of the other
Hox paralogs.
We also examined the expression of the C. elegans
Hox genes at the L1 larval stage, and found a similar

pattern that characterizes them during embryonic development: the posterior Hox paralogs were active in the
tail, LIN-39 was expressed mainly in the mid-body
region, the expression of mab-5 was restricted to the
domain located between the posterior and central body
parts, whereas ceh-13 expression was apparent along the
entire anteroposterior body axis (Figure 7B). ceh-13
expression, for example, was detectable in nearly each of
the P blast cells (Figure 7B) and their daughters [13].
Different neuronal precursors as well as lateral hypodermal cells were also CEH-13::GFP-positive in each of the
main body regions. Thus, the expression domain of ceh13 may have been extended from the anterior during
evolution, presumably following the reciprocal translocation of ceh-13 and its closest Hox paralog, lin-39.
Extra copies of lin-39 and mab-5 can suppress the
pleiotropic Ceh-13 mutant phenotype

ceh-13 single mutant animals that are able to develop
into adulthood are small, exhibit a variable abnormal
morphology and reduced fertility, and have a slow growth
rate [14]. As the expression domain of ceh-13 overlaps
with those of the other C. elegans Hox paralogs, one
might expect functional redundancy between the anterior
Hox gene and other Hox paralogs. Indeed, we found that
a translational fusion LIN-39::GFP reporter, zhIs1, is able
to rescue larval, but not embryonic, lethality of ceh-13
mutants (note that this transgene was able to rescue the
Vul phenotype of lin-39 hypomorph mutants). Whereas

developed into fertile adults only, a large portion of ceh13 mutants bearing zhIs1 were able to pass the larval
stages (Figure 8A, B). In addition, the growth rate of ceh13 mutants was significantly faster with the reporter than
without the reporter (data not shown).
We also used a mab-5 gf mutation to test functional
redundancy between ceh-13 and this middle Hox paralog. We found that the majority of ceh-13(sw1)mab-5
(e1751gf) double mutants develop normally (Figure 8A,
B). The morphology and behavior of these animals
appeared to be superficially wild-type. Consistently, the
lifespan of ceh-13(sw1)mab-5(e1751gf) double mutant
animals were also comparable with that of the wild type
(Figure 8C). Thus, increased dosage of lin-39 and mab-5
may substitute ceh-13 function in certain developmental
processes. This can explain why half of the mutants

defective for ceh-13 are able to pass embryonic development, the existence of ceh-13 escapers, as well as the
viability of lin-39mab-5 lf double mutants.
We also considered the possibility that ceh-13 is
involved in regulating the expression of lin-39 or mab-5
in certain cell types. To address this issue we monitored
mab-5 activity in ceh-13(sw1) mutant background, and
found significant changes in the expression of mab-5, as
compared with the wild-type background. For example,
at the L1 larval stage mab-5 was ectopically expressed
in the head, while its expression was strongly reduced in
the tail region of ceh-13 mutants (Figure 8D). In contrast, lin-39 expression was hardly changed in ceh-13
mutants. We conclude that a complex - region- and
stage-specific - regulatory relationship exists between
ceh-13 and the middle Hox paralogs.

larvae were selected and then scored for survival (yellow curve). Samples were assayed in triplicates. For ceh-13(sw1) single mutants, ~70 mutant
escapers were examined in each assay. For the other strains, 150-150 animals were scored in each assay. p < 0.001, when ceh-13(lf)mab-5(gf)

Finally, we performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
of the C. elegans Hox homeodomain sequences. On the
tree generated the middle paralogs stem from the anterior Hox branch, further supporting their close relation
to ceh-13 (Figure 8E). In the light of these finding, the
role of ceh-13 in controlling the migration of posterior
Q cell descendants, fusion of posterior Pn.p cells, and
vulval induction is now better understandable. Together,

these data provide a functional support for the common
evolutionarily origin of ceh-13 and the middle Hox paralogs (Figure 8F).

Discussion
Genes from the Hox gene clusters encode evolutionarily
conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factors that play a pivotal role in axial patterning during

animal development [1-5]. C. elegans is an attractive
model system to study the unique and combined effects
of Hox genes on developmental processes. However, our
present knowledge on the roles of Hox genes in this
organism is rather unbalanced as numerous studies have
shed light into the mechanisms by which three Hox
genes, lin-39, mab-5 and egl-5, control various developmental events, but there is almost no information on
the function of the other Hox paralogs, ceh-13, nob-1
and php-3. In this study we describe novel roles for ceh13 in different developmental processes, and show that
its functional domain obvious along the anteroposterior
body axis, representing a break in colinearity.
ceh-13 influences Q cell migration

Our data presented here indicate that ceh-13 is required
for the proper positioning of Q neuroblasts (Figs. 2, 3, 4).
Inactivation of ceh-13 led to a shortened migration of the
AVM (QR.paa) and PVM (QL.paa) cells. AVM was positioned improperly in nearly each of the ceh-13 deficient
animals examined. Mislocalization of PVM was also
obvious in a significant portion of ceh-13 mutant larvae.
This latter cell migration defect is particularly intriguing
as it manifests in the posterior body domain. Although
ceh-13 is considered as an anterior (labial-like) Hox gene
[14], its defect disrupted the ability of a QL descendant
to migrate toward the posterior. Furthermore, elimination of ceh-13 function also caused mispositioining of
ALM sensory neurons in the majority of ceh-13 mutants.
Upon these findings, it was relevant to ask whether
ceh-13 interacts with mig-13, which affects AVM migration and whose expression is controlled by mab-5 [29].
In ceh-13(-); mig-13(-) double mutant animals, the
migration of AVM was more severely affected than in
mig-13 single mutants. Thus, the two genes may act
parallel to control cell migration in the anterior body
domain. Alternatively, ceh-13 influences both mig-13
activity and another pathway to affect this process. mig13 expression was abolished upon ceh-13 deficiency,
supporting the latter possibility. These data are consistent with previous findings reporting that ceh-20 is
required for mig-13 activity to control cell migration in
a lin-39-independent manner [25]. It is worth to note,
however, that the regulatory region of mig-13 contains
no canonical binding site for CEH-13. Thus, the effect
of CEH-13 on mig-13 expression may be indirect.
Together, we conclude that ceh-13 affects cell migration
in body parts covered by functional domains of the middle Hox paralogs.
ceh-13 affects the fusion of Pn.p cells in various body
domains

The fusion of Pn.p cells with hyp7 at the early larval
stages is known to be under the control of lin-39 and

Page 11 of 14

mab-5 [11,12]. According to our present data, ceh-13 is
also involved in this process at least in hermaphrodites
(Figure 5). Unexpectedly, ceh-13, unlike lin-39, appeared
to promote Pn.p fusion, and this function was evident
even in the posterior body part; besides the central P(38).p cells, additional Pn.p cells remained unfused in animals defective for CEH-13. These results indicate that
ceh-13 opposes with lin-39 in certain biological processes. It is possible that the two Hox genes share common targets genes mediating cell fusion, but regulate
them in an opposite way. Alternatively, lin-39 represses
genes required for cell fusion, such as eff-1 [37], while
ceh-13 promotes the expression of another set of genes
that promote cell fusion. Nevertheless, ceh-13 and lin-39
may co-ordinately regulate cell fusion in certain Pn.p
lineages. This can explain why the fusion pattern of Pn.
p cells is quite different between lin-39 and ceh-20
mutant hermaphrodites [25]. Whereas in lin-39 lf
mutant larvae almost all Pn.p cells fuse with hyp7, in
ceh-20(mu290) mutants each VPC [P(3-8).p] and some
of the most anterior and posterior Pn.p cells remain
unfused [25].
ceh-13 affects vulva patterning

lin-39 is required during the early larval stages for the P
(3-8).p cells to remain unfused, and, later at the L3 larval
stage, to generate vulval cell divisions [11,12]. Considering cell fusion, ceh-13, similarly to ceh-20 [25], appears to
contrast with lin-39: it promotes, rather than prevents,
fusion in Pn.p cells (see data above). The higher number
of unfused Pn.p cells in ceh-13 lf mutants may be the reason of why these animals exhibited, although with a low
penetrance, ectopic vulval induction (Figure 6). In controlling vulval cell division, however, ceh-13 acts along
with lin-39; inactivation of ceh-13 reduced the ability of
VPCs to undergo vulval induction in synMuv AB double
mutant background (Figure 6). Consistently, ceh-13 is
known to be expressed in the major hypodermal syncytium [13], in which synMuv genes antagonize Rasmediated vulval induction [38]. It is also possible that
ceh-13 indirectly affects vulval induction via modulating
the expression of other Hox factors involved in vulval cell
fate specification. Together, vulval patterning is another
example in which the anterior Hox paralog ceh-13 acts in
the middle body domain.
Lethality of ceh-13 mutants can be suppressed by
increased dosage of middle Hox paralogs

Double mutant animals defective for both lin-39 and
mab-5 are viable and fertile. In contrast, the majority of
ceh-13(-) single mutants arrest development at the
embryonic or early larval stages [14]. In this study we
show that extra copies of lin-39 or a gf mutation of mab-5
are able to rescue lethality in ceh-13 deficient animals. In

Tihanyi et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/78

addition, other aspects of the pleiotropic Ceh-13 phenotype, including malformations at various body parts, slow
growth rate, reduced lifespan and lowered fertility, could
also be restored to normal levels by mab-5(e1751gf) mutation (Figure 8). These results also indicate a functional
redundancy between ceh-13 and the middle-group Hox
paralogs in various body domains. As ceh-13 has an unusually wide expression and activity domain, extending
from the head to tail, it may cover and substitute several
functions of lin-39 and mab-5, making the middle Hox
paralogs to be dispensable for development. In contrary,
lin-39 and mab-5 operate in the middle and posterior
body domains, respectively. Their site of action overlaps
only partially with that of ceh-13. As a result, ceh-13 has
evolved as a predominantly essential Hox gene.

Conclusions
The nematode Hox genes are thought to have undergone
rapid divergent evolution, probably due to the adaptation
of the lineage-driven mode of development [7]. ceh-13 is
the only anterior (labial-like) paralog encoded by the C.
elegans genome. However, many of its characteristics
make ceh-13 as a rather atypical anterior Hox gene. First,
it is located between the two middle Hox paralogs, downstream of lin-39 and upstream of mab-5. This unusual
genomic organization of ceh-13 resulted from an ancient
inversion event, presumably soon after the emergence
of lin-39 and ceh-13 from their common ancestor
(Figure 8F). Second, the spatial expression domain of
ceh-13 largely overlaps with that of the other Hox paralogs. Thus, its relative localization within the cluster and
functional domain are not collinear with each other.
ceh-13 plays multiple roles in C. elegans development. It
controls cell adhesion, tissue patterning in different parts
of the body (i.e., morphogenesis), cell fusion, cell migration, growth rate and fertility [[14]; this study]. Some of
these functions, such as cell adhesion and growth, might
have characterized the primordial Hox gene that gave raise
the ancestor Hox cluster through a series of tandem gene
duplication and subsequent diversification events in an
early phase of animal evolution. In this scenario, a ceh-13like primordial Hox gene underwent gene duplication,
resulting in an upstream and a downstream daughter that
became the prototype of the first anterior paralog and the
first posterior paralog, respectively. After a sufficient
degree of diversification, these genes conferred anterior
(head) and posterior (tail) polarizations for the host organism. The anterior paralog then underwent duplication
again: the resulting downstream descendant evolved into
the first middle Hox paralog, increasing moprhological
complexity in the mid-body domain. The fact that a ceh13-like ortholog presents in all nematode lineages examined so far supports this scenario [7]. The early inversion
event that occurred between the ancestral anterior and

Page 12 of 14

middle Hox paralogs in the C. elegans lineage may conserved the broad expression domain and diverse developmental roles of the anterior descendant. Another possible,
but much unlikely, interpretation for the unusual properties of ceh-13 is that its ancestor might have acquired
various functions secondarily during evolution. The question, however, remains open why the other nematode Hox
paralogs have avoided such evolutionary innovations.

Characterization of the mutation ok737

ok737 allele is a deletional derivative of ceh-13. It
removes the end of the first exon and more than half of
the first intron, resulting in a frame shift and the generation of a premature stop codon 26 base pairs after
the downstream deletional breakpoint. Based on phenotypic characterization (see below), ok737 is likely to

Tihanyi et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/78

represent another null allele of ceh-13. Homozygous
ceh-13(ok737) mutant animals exhibit a variable abnormal morphology phenotype accompanied with a highly
penetrant embryonic or larval lethality: 96% (621/647) of
ok737 mutants die at various stages of embryogenesis or
at early larval stages. The arrested embryos and larvae
display serious body malformations, especially at the
anterior and central body parts. The ceh-13(ok737) escapers, which are able to develop into fertile adults, show
less severe morphological defects than the arrested
mutants, and have a decreased brood size (data not
shown), a short body length and delayed developmental
rate, as compared with the wild type. Homozygous
ceh-13(ok737) mutants were isolated from the VC509
balanced strain of genotype ceh-13(ok737) III/hT2[bli-4
(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48] (I;III). For sequencing the
mutant allele, genomic PCR was performed with the following forward and reverse primers: 5’-tga gct cca ctg
aat gtt atg g-3’ and 5’-tat gac gaa ccg gtc ttt cc-3’.
Assaying the positions of Q descendants

The position of AVM (QR.paa) and PVM (QL.paa) was
determined by an integrated mec-7::gfp reporter [28].
Their location was scored as described preciously
[25,29]. Statistical analysis of cell distribution was performed by the software MATLAB. The position of PVM
was also screened by using an integrated tax-4::gfp
fusion reporter [29].
Assaying cell fusion in Pn.p lineages

Fused vs. unfused fates of Pn.p cells were determined at
the end of the L1 larval stage by using an integrated
ajm-1::gfp reporter [30], which marks a component of
adherent junction, thereby labeling the outline of
unfused cells. Analysis of vulval patterning was performed by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Images were collected from an Olympus BX-51
microscope equipped with an F-WU II camera. Statistical analysis of vulva phenotypes was performed by
unpaired t-test, using the software SPSS 14.0.
Construction of gfp reporters

A 15 kb large genomic fragment consisting of 10 kb
upstream regulatory element and almost the entire nob-1
coding region except for the last codon, was PCR amplified by using the following primers. Forward primer: 5’aac tga gaa cca atg cat tgg ctc cta tca cgg ggt tct gg-3’,
reverse primer: 5’-cgg gat ccc ggt tga tca atc gct cga tgc-3’.
The resulting fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI,
and cloned into the expression vector pPD95.75. Transgenic lines were produced by microinjection, using the
co-transformation marker rol-6(su1006). Extrachromosomal transgenes then was integrated by UV radiation and
subsequent isogenization by crossing back with the wild

type 8 times. For amplifying the php-3 coding regions,
genomic PCR was performed by the following forward
and reverse primers: 5’-tgt ttc tca aaa acg gat gg-3’ and
5’-cgg gat ccc gcg tag gca gtt gtg cag ctc ttg tc-3’. The PCR
fragment was digested with MluI and BamHI, and cloned
into the nob-1::gfp-containing vector (Note that nob-1 and
php-3 are adjacent genes and use the same promoter
region for regulating expression). Transgenic worms
containing the extrachromosomal array were generated as
described above.
Lifespan assays

Lifespan assays were carried out at 25°C. For synchronization, 20-30 gravid well-fed adults (P) were transferred to a
new agar plate containing nematode growth medium
(NGM) seeded with E. coli OP50 to lay eggs for 4-5 hours,
and then removed. F1 young (not gravid) adults were
transferred to NGM plates supplemented with 300 mg/ml
FUDR (5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine) for 1 day (t = 0). This
treatment inhibited the germ-line to produce germ cells.
Sterile F1 adults were then transferred to the final assay
plates and scored. SPSS 14 software was used to calculate
mean lifespan and perform statistical analysis. p values
for comparing Kaplan-Meyer survival curves between two
groups were determined using log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
tests.
Phylogenetic analysis

For clustering the HOX genes from C. elegans (AC
numbers: ceh-13: NM_066254; egl-5: L19247; lin-39:
L19248; mab-5: AF277990; nob-1: AF172090; php-3:
AF172092), we applied the Bayesian phylogenetic
method and used 180 nucleotide long conserved homedomain sequences. For calculating the tree, MrBayes
v3.1.2 software was used. The codon likelihood model
was applied with one substitution type and with invariable proportion of sites. Te rate for the remaining sites
were drawn from an estimated gamma distribution. The
number of generations was set 1.000.000 and two
independent runs were done. Values on the tree correspond to the posterior probability - i.e. clade credibility of each node [from 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum)].
