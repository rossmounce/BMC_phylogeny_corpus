barcodes in discriminating species of the large
Asteraceae family

Abstract
Background: Five DNA regions, namely, rbcL, matK, ITS, ITS2, and psbA-trnH, have been recommended as primary
DNA barcodes for plants. Studies evaluating these regions for species identification in the large plant taxon, which
includes a large number of closely related species, have rarely been reported.
Results: The feasibility of using the five proposed DNA regions was tested for discriminating plant species within
Asteraceae, the largest family of flowering plants. Among these markers, ITS2 was the most useful in terms of
universality, sequence variation, and identification capability in the Asteraceae family. The species discriminating
power of ITS2 was also explored in a large pool of 3,490 Asteraceae sequences that represent 2,315 species
belonging to 494 different genera. The result shows that ITS2 correctly identified 76.4% and 97.4% of plant samples
at the species and genus levels, respectively. In addition, ITS2 displayed a variable ability to discriminate related
species within different genera.
Conclusions: ITS2 is the best DNA barcode for the Asteraceae family. This approach significantly broadens the
application of DNA barcoding to resolve classification problems in the family Asteraceae at the genera and species
levels.

Background
Asteraceae is the largest family of flowering plants in the
world. The family includes over 1,600 genera and 23,000
individual species. Many members of the Asteraceae
family are important for medicinal, ornamental, and
economic purposes.
Approximately 300 Asteraceae species are already used
for medicinal purposes in China. For example, Artemisia
annua and its derivatives are effective in treating
malaria [1]. Saussurea involucrate, an endangered
species, possesses anti-fatigue, anti-inflammation, antitumor and free radical scavenging properties [2]. Echinacea also has immuno-modulatory properties with its
ability to reduce inflammation, speed up wound healing
and boost the immune system in response to bacterial
or viral infection [3]. Commercially important plants of
the Asteraceae family include the food crops Lactuca

sativa (lettuce), Cichorium intybus (chicory), Cynara
scolymus (globe artichoke), Smallanthus sonchifolius
(yacon), Helianthus tuberosus (jerusalem artichoke), and
so on. Aside from consumption, the seeds of Helianthus
annuus (sunflower), and those of Carthamus tinctorius
(safflower), another Asteraceae member, can be used for
the production of cooking oil. Other commercially
important species of the family Asteraceae are members
of the Tanacetum, Chrysanthemum and Pulicaria genera, which have insecticidal properties. Eupatorium adenophorum is also one of the more noxious invasive
plants worldwide, and it does have a significant effect
on local ecosystems.
The wide variety of plants in the family Asteraceae
often makes identification at the species level difficult
[4]. Given the many valuable members of Asteraceae
described above, an easy and accurate method of
authenticating an Asteraceae species is indispensable for
ensuring the drug and food safety of internationally
traded herbs.

DNA barcoding is a process that uses a short piece of
DNA sequence from a standard locus as a species identification tool [5]. DNA barcode regions have already
been adopted for animal use [6,7] and several regions
have previously been recommended for plant use [8-17].
The Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the
Barcode of Life (CBOL) proposed rbcL and matK as the
core DNA barcodes for plants [18]. A previous study by
Kress et al. [9] tested 7 promising barcodes. However,
only 15 sequences of Asteraceae, representing 14 species
distributed among only 9 genera, were analyzed in the
study. The CBOL Plant Working Group [18] also evaluated the performance of the leading barcoding loci in
species identification, but the sequences of Asteraceae
used included just 75 samples, consisting of 38 species
belonging to 19 genera. Chen et al. [12] likewise compared the practicality of using the suggested barcode
sequences against a large number of medicinal plants.
However, the study included no more than 450
sequences of Asteraceae derived from 306 species from
50 genera. The researchers did not provide sufficient
evidence that the recommended DNA barcode regions
are suitable for species identification in the family Asteraceae, which includes a large number of closely related
species. Thus, this issue is addressed in our study by
comparing the feasibility of using each of these five proposed DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, ITS, ITS2, and psbAtrnH) in the Asteraceae family.

Results and Discussion
Assessment of the universality of the five candidate
barcodes

A universal DNA barcode is required to be tractable for
use in a wide range of species. Therefore barcode
regions must be relatively short in length to facilitate
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing [9]. As
shown in Figure 1, for the selected samples, three
regions (ITS2, psbA-trnH and rbcL) were amplified
using a single pair of universal primers for each locus

Figure 1 Assessment of the universality of the five candidate
barcodes.

that results in high amplification and a sequencing efficiency of 85%. In comparison, ITS had a relatively lower
efficiency at 75%. We used two pairs of matK primers
exhibiting different universalities for the members of the
family Asteraceae. The primers Kim3F/1R and 390F/
1326R achieved amplifying and sequencing efficiencies
of 91% and 25%, respectively.
Measurement of inter- versus intra-specific genetic
divergence at each locus

Six metrics were employed to characterize inter- versus
intra-specific variation (Figure 2) [11,12,19-21]. A favorable barcode should possess a high inter-specific divergence to distinguish different species. ITS2 and ITS
both exhibited significantly higher levels of inter-specific
discriminatory ability than psbA-trnH and matK. The
lowest divergence between conspecific individuals, as
determined by all inter-specific calculations was exhibited by rbcL. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests affirmed that
ITS2 had the highest divergence at the inter-specific
level, whereas rbcL had the lowest (Table 1). The results
of the intra-specific differences were similar, with ITS2
contributing the largest and rbcL the smallest variations
(Figure 2).
Testing the efficacy of authentication

BLAST1 and Distance methods were used to test the
ability of the potential barcoding sequences in assigning
unique species identities to the given samples [12,22].
The results from the two methods revealed a clear pattern (Figure 3), demonstrating that the ITS region exhibits the highest identification efficiency. ITS2 and ITS
performed well at the genus level using both methods,
and at the species level using the Distance method.
Using the BLAST1 method, ITS2 was less efficient
(2.5%) than ITS at the species level, while rbcL was the
lowest performer. In addition, except for the combination of matK and psbA-trnH, which improved the correct identification rates by 1.4%, using one sequence
rather than a combination of two markers didn’t
improve the rates of identification.
The meta-analysis of markers, ITS, psbA-trnH, matK
and rbcL, was also performed in parallel with the analysis on ITS2 using GenBank data (see Additional file 1:
Identification efficiency of the five regions evaluated in a
large pool of Asteraceae samples from GenBank). The
correct identification rates were significantly higher for
ITS2 than for other markers except ITS. The GenBank
data analyses were consistent with our experimental
data results. Compared with single markers alone, combinations of markers could improve the rate of correct
species identification (<5%).
Overall, our study demonstrates that ITS2 is the most
successful region in terms of universality, the specific

Figure 2 Analyses of the inter-specific divergence between congeneric species and intra-specific variation of the five loci. First, three
parameters were used to characterize inter-specific divergence: (i) average inter-specific distance (K2P distance) between all species in each
genus with at least two species; (ii) average theta prime (θ’), where theta prime is the mean pairwise distance within each genus with more than
one species, thus eliminating biases associated with different numbers of species among genera; and (iii) smallest inter-specific distance, i.e., the
minimum inter-specific distance within each genus with at least two species. Second, three additional parameters were used to determine intraspecific variation: (i) average intra-specific difference (K2P distance), that between all samples collected within each species with more than one
individual; (ii) theta (θ), where theta is the mean pairwise distance within each species with at least two representatives; θ eliminates biases
associated with unequal sampling among a species; and (iii) average coalescent depth, which is the maximum intra-specific distance within each
species with at least two individuals.

genetic divergence, and discrimination between species
among the five markers examined. ITS is also proven as
a valuable marker for authenticating species in Asteraceae. However, its low amplification efficiency limits its
potential for broad taxonomic use. Although matK,
rbcL, and psbA-trnH have effective primers for the
amplification, the three markers are less powerful than
ITS and ITS2 in species discrimination in the family
Asteraceae. Moreover, theoretically, the regions based
on nuclear DNA are much more informative than barcodes based on organellar DNA [23].
To evaluate further the ability of the ITS2 region to
authenticate a wide range of Asteraceae species, it was
also tested against a larger database that includes 3,490
samples sequences derived from 2,315 different species
(Table 2). The ITS2 region performed well, with a 76.4%
(BLAST1 method) and 69.7% (Distance method) successful identification rate at the species level and a
97.4% (BLAST1 method) and 96.2% (Distance method)
successful identification rate at the genus level.
ITS2 is suitable, but not ideal

Our research displayed a similar trend to that of Chen
et al. [12] and demonstrated that ITS2 is a promising
barcode for authenticating plant species. In accordance
with the criteria outlined by Kress et al. [9], the ITS2
region has several advantages that make it a promising
candidate for DNA barcoding. It has been proposed as a
candidate marker for taxonomic classification and barcoding of medicinal plants because it has both high

correct identification rate and high amplification efficiency [12,24-27]. As the ITS2 region is one of the most
common regions used for phylogenetic analyses [28-30],
a vast amount of sequencing data has already been
deposited in GenBank and is ready for immediate use.
The presence of multiple copies of ITS2 sequences is
challenging [13]. However, Coleman [27] proposed that
the repeats displayed a high degree of similarity. Coleman also suggested that the PCR-amplified copies could
represent the information of the ITS2 region in individuals and that ITS2 could be considered a single locus
in most cases.
Among the six large genera (number of species > 50)
in the Asteraceae family (Table 2), the utility of ITS2 for
species authentication varied and could only be analyzed
individually, not as a group. For the genus Brachyscome,
with 57 sequences representing 55 species, ITS2 worked
well with a 96.5% successful identification rate. Satisfactory results were also obtained for the genus Erigeron,
where >80.5% of the sequences were correctly identified.
In contrast, ITS2 had lower identification efficiency for
the genera Centaurea and Artemisia (48.0% and 59.3%,
respectively). And in two other genera (Senecio and Stevia), ITS2 was relatively powerful for taxonomic classification, precisely authenticating 73.4% and 76.9% of the
samples, respectively. The identification efficiencies of
ITS2 in dataset 2 are listed in Additional file 2 (Authentication efficiency of ITS2 using different methods for
the genera in dataset 2 containing more than one
species).
To improve identification accuracy within a particular
genus, using combinations of DNA barcodes may be
necessary. Therefore, ITS is proposed for use as a complementary barcode for differentiating species within the
Asteraceae family.
Application and meaning of DNA barcoding

The selected DNA barcode for Asteraceae, ITS2, is not
perfect, especially for taxonomists and phylogenetic
experts. However, even an imperfect barcode can have
a major effect on many areas of research and be sufficient for many applications [13]. For instance, ITS2
might be a suitable DNA barcode for public users,
such as customs officials, forensic examiners, foodprocessing individuals, and research organizations.
Considering that ITS2 has a strong ability to group
plant samples into their correct genus and has a relatively high accuracy for grouping samples into their
correct species, it is of great practical value to individuals without adequate taxonomic training. Compared
with ITS2, ITS or the chloroplast genome is better
equipped to deal with the biological complexities of
species distinctions, a major focus of taxonomists and
phylogenetic experts [13].

Conclusions
Altogether, our results support the claim that ITS2 is a
valuable locus for differentiating species within Asteraceae and that DNA barcoding is a useful tool for classification and identification of individual species. We
propose applying DNA barcoding technology to resolve
classification problems in the family Asteraceae at the
genera and species levels.
Methods
Sampling of plant materials

Dataset 1, which consists of 110 samples from 63 species representing 48 genera of Asteraceae (see Additional file 3: Samples in dataset 1 for testing the
potential barcodes and accession numbers in GenBank)
was gathered from a large geographical area in China
from July 2007 to January 2008. Great effort was made
to ensure that the samples represent the major lineages
of Asteraceae. Furthermore, the maximum number of
samples belonging to closely related species was collected (Table 3). Plant samples in dataset 1 were spread
across two subfamilies (Carduoideae and Cichorioideae)
and encompassed a total of 11 tribes of the family
Asteraceae.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing

DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing
were performed as described previously [12].
Data Acquisition from GenBank

First, all sequences involving the five markers of Asteraceae were downloaded from GenBank. Certain gene
regions of the five barcoding markers based on GenBank
annotations were then obtained. Sequences <100 bp in
length, with ambiguous bases (more than 15’Ns’), or
those belonging to unnamed species (i.e. sequences with
‘sp.’ in the species name) were filtered out. Finally, to
avoid contamination with fungal sequences existing in
ITS2 sequences, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [31]
based on well-curated fungal sequences was used to
search for downloaded ITS2 sequences to remove the
sequences possibly contaminated with fungi. The meta-

analysis was performed using the remaining sequences
(see Additional file 4: Accession numbers of the five loci
sequences from GenBank for the meta-analysis). The
ITS2 sequences were also used to construct dataset 2,
which is comprised of 3,490 sequences from 2,315
Asteraceae species downloaded from GenBank (see
Additional file 5: Accession numbers of ITS2 sequences
used in dataset 2). Many closely related species were
also included in dataset 2 (Table 3).
Sequence alignment and analysis

Consensus sequences and contig generation were
accomplished using CodonCode Aligner V 3.5 (CodonCode Co., USA). The sequences of the candidate DNA
barcodes were aligned using Clustal W and the genetic
distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model. The average intra-specific distance,
theta, and coalescent depth were calculated to evaluate
the intra-specific variation [12,19]-[21]. The average
inter-specific distance, the minimum inter-specific
distance, and Theta primer were used to represent
inter-specific divergences [11,12,20,21]. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were used as previously described
[10-12]. Two methods of species identification, namely
BLAST1 and the nearest distance method, were performed as described previously [12,22]. The traffic
light approach [32] was used to identify the combination of markers, as long as the sequences could be
identified by one of the markers in combination, the
combination would have identification power. If any of
the sequences were identified unsuccessfully for any
marker in combination, the combination would incapable of identifying that sequence.
