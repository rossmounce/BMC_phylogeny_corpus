Abstract
Background: Sequential monotherapies of nucleotide analogs used in chronic hepatitis B
treatment can lead to the selection of a resistance mutation to each antiviral drug.
Case presentation: A patient with chronic hepatitis B was successively treated with lamivudine
monotherapy, lamivudine-adefovir dual therapy, adefovir monotherapy and again with an adefovirlamivudine dual therapy. Lamivudine-associated mutations (rtL180M and rtM204V/I) followed by
adefovir-associated mutations (rtN236T and rtA181V) emerged during the two monotherapy
regimens. Despite the presence of rtM204V/I, rtA181V, and rtN236T mutations at the beginning
of the second dual therapy, sustained biochemical and virological responses have been observed
thus far after 23 months.
Conclusion: This case illustrates that rtM204V/I, rtA181V, and rtN236T resistance mutations can
coexist in a patient but do not preclude the recycling of lamivudine and adefovir in combination
therapy, when no other therapeutic choices are available.

Background
The treatment of chronic hepatitis B with oral nucleoside
(e.g., lamivudine, entecavir) and nucleotide (e.g., adefovir) analogs that inhibit viral polymerase reverse transcriptase activity has dramatically modified the
management of infected patients but is hampered by the
emergence of resistant strains containing mutation in the
reverse transcriptase (rt) part of the HBV polymerase gene
(HBV Pol). The main lamivudine resistance mutations

were mapped in the C and B domains of HBV Pol, and the
specific mutations selected were rtM204I/V/S (domain C)
and rtL180M (domain B) [1]. Resistance to adefovir is
associated with B and D domain enzyme mutations. The
major mutations observed with adefovir-resistant HBV are
identified as rtN236T (domain D) and rtA181V (domain
B) [2-5]. Lamivudine-resistance mutations were detected
in 15–30% of treated patients after 1 year of therapy and
up to 70% after 5 years [6]. Resistance to adefovir is

thought to be less common and occurs later in the course
of treatment as compared to lamivudine [7,8]. Nevertheless, a rate of 29% has been described after 5 years of therapy [9].

Case presentation
In 2000, a 35-year-old Turkish man (91 kg for 1.70 m;
BMI: 31.5) was found to have an abnormal level of serum
alanine aminotransferase (ALT = 243 IU/L; normal, < 42
IU/L) after undergoing routine blood testing. The patient
was HBs-antigen (Ag)-positive, HBs-antibody (Ab)-negative, HBe-Ag-negative, HBe-Ab-positive, and HBc-Ab-positive (Axsym, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL,
USA). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected as positive in the serum. Serological markers for hepatitis delta
virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C
virus were negative. The persistence of biochemical and
virological abnormalities was an indication for a liver

biopsy, which showed chronic hepatitis B with a mild
necroinflammatory activity and moderate fibrosis (Metavir score, A1F2). Treatment with lamivudine 100 mg/day
was initiated in November 2000 (month 0: M0). At that
time, serum HBV DNA load was 8.6 log10 IU/mL (Amplicor-HBV-Monitor, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France;
limit of detection: 200 copies/mL) (Figure 1). After an initial 3.4 log10 drop of the HBV DNA load within the first 3
months of therapy, the serum HBV DNA load regularly
increased with a flare of ALT at M10 and reached the pretreatment level at M14. Consequently, adefovir 10 mg/
day was added to the ongoing lamivudine therapy in a
temporary-use authorization program. This dual-therapy
regimen was maintained for 15 months with a good virological and biochemical response (HBV DNA load: 4.1
log10IU/mL and ALT = 41 IU/L), leading to lamivudine
interruption at M30 because, at that time, the benefit of
maintaining dual therapy was not proven. With adefovir

monotherapy, the serum HBV DNA level continued to
decrease with a nadir at M42 (2.6 log10IU/mL). However,
a virological breakthrough (i.e., a controlled increase in
serum HBV load > 1 log) occurred at M48, leading to the
re-introduction of lamivudine in association with adefovir (at that time entecavir was not yet available). With this
second dual therapy, serum HBV DNA became undetectable at M60 (COBAS Taqman HBV, Roche Diagnostics,
Meylan, France; limit of detection: 6 IU/mL). To date
(M83), the HBV load is still undetectable and ALT levels
have been repeatedly within the normal range.

tory mutation system (ARMS) [12]. Briefly, discrimination between wild type and mutant with a single base pair
mismatch is made possible using a primer-template mismatch at the 3' end of the primer, which significantly
compromises polymerase efficiency in amplifying the
wild type strain. Primers and probes for rtM204V/I were
described previously and the assay can detect up to 0.1%
variants for a total viral load of 105 copies/mL [13]. We
designed and evaluated a specific reverse primer (5'ATCTTTTTGTTTTGTTAGGGG-3') for the detection of the
rtN236T-mutation.

In order to detect lamivudine and adefovir resistanceassociated mutations and to determine the HBV genotype
of the patient strain, sequence analyses were performed
within the viral polymerase and the precore genes using a
bi-directional sequencing with Ceq 2000 XL Beckman
(Beckman-Coulter, Villepinte, France). The presence of
resistance-associated mutations was also assessed using a
commercially available reverse hybridization line probe
assay (InnoLipa-DR2-assay, InnoGenetics, Ghent, Belgium), following the manufacturer's instructions. This
second genotyping assay was performed because of its
sensitivity in detecting HBV resistance-associated mutations, particularly in low HBV-load samples [10,11]. To
evaluate the proportion of mutated strain in each sample,
we used an in-house selective real-time PCR, which provides a quantitative detection of the main HBV mutations
associated with lamivudine and adefovir resistance:
rtM204V/I and rtN236T, respectively. This method was
derived from the strategy called the amplification refrac-

The phylogenetic analysis of the HBsAg-coding region
sequence showed a genotype D and a stop codon mutation at the G1896A position in the precore region, confirming the serological data for the infection with a
precore mutant HBV strain (data not shown).
The viral polymerase gene sequencing before and after the
first 3 months of lamivudine monotherapy revealed a
wild viral strain. The two lamivudine-resistance mutations
rtL180M and rtM204V/I were concomitantly detected
with sequencing and line probe assays from M6 to M39 (9
months after cessation of lamivudine). During this
period, the rate of rtM204V/I strain remained stable, as
shown by the ARMS assay (see Table 1). After M39, the
rtL180M variant was no longer detectable with sequencing or the line probe assay. From M42 to M55, the
rtM204V/I variant was still detectable with ARMS and the
line probe assay but not with sequencing because the

mutated population represents less than 25% of the total
viral population, as seen by ARMS (see Table 1).

has been responsible for the reduction of lamivudine susceptibility both in vitro and in vivo [17].

The first adefovir-resistance mutation rtN236T has been
observed since M42 (after 28 months of adefovir therapy,
including 12 months of adefovir monotherapy) using
ARMS and the line probe assay. The second adefovirresistance mutation rtA181V was detected at M46.

Furthermore, Brunelle et al. [18] determined the phenotypical characteristics of an HBV-laboratory strain carrying
rtL180M, rtM204V, and rtN236T. This mutant was
approximately 59-fold less susceptible to lamivudine and
adefovir-combination than wild type HBV. Comparatively, this mutant was approximately four- and six-fold
less susceptible to tenofovir and entecavir therapy than
wild type HBV. This correlates with the clinical setting in
which successful rescues with tenofovir or entecavir
against adefovir-resistant HBV have been reported
[3,4,19].

Thus, at the beginning of the second-line dual therapy
(M48), rtA181V, rtN236T, and rtM204V/I variants were
detectable either by sequencing analysis or both the line
probe assay and ARMS. This resistance profile persisted at
M55 but the rtN236T-mutated strain proportion slightly
decreased (from 34% at M48 to 27% at M55). The line
probe assay carried out at M58 showed wild type recovery
of amino acids 204, 236, and 181. At this time, viral load
was 8 IU/mL and sequencing and ARMS detection were
unsuccessful. Finally, the viral load became undetectable
(< 6 IU/mL with Cobas-TaqMan-HBV) at M60 after 1 year
of dual therapy.

Discussion
In this report, we describe a patient with chronic hepatitis
B who achieved a sustained virological and biochemical
response to a second-line of combination therapy with
lamivudine and adefovir despite the presence of rtM204V/
I, rtN236T, and rtA181V mutations. This response has
been maintained so far and the three mutations were no
longer detectable, even with sensitive genotyping assays,
after 10 months of this dual therapy.
To our knowledge, cases of similar combined mutations
are rare. Villet et al. [14] reported a patient who, on the
same viral strain, showed a combination of rtV173L,
rtL180M, rtA181T, and rtN236T mutations after several
successive courses of lamivudine and adefovir. In this
case, the rtM204V/I mutation was not detectable. More
recently, Karatayli et al. [15] described a patient who did
not respond to adefovir and lamivudine. They demonstrated the presence of rtM204I and rtA181S mutations in
the HBV polymerase and the phenotypical resistance of
this strain to both adefovir and lamivudine. Thus, the concomitant association of rtM204V/I/S and rtN236T is very
rare and has even been described as mutually exclusive by
Osiowy et al. [16].
The successful addition of lamivudine to the adefovir regimen in spite of the presence of rtN236T-mutation has
been reported in vivo [2,5], but in these cases no previous
lamivudine resistance-associated mutation was detectable. Moreover, when the rtA181V mutation is present in
combination with the rtN236T mutation, lamivudine is
no longer recommended. Indeed, the rtA181V mutation

It should be noted that the antiviral response during the
first course of dual therapy was only slow and partial,
whereas the second course led to a rapid and complete
viral response. The reasons for this difference are not clear
and could stem from several intricate factors such as variability in the patient's compliance and/or differences in
the antiviral efficacy of the added drug against the resistant strain. The explanation of the sustained response to
the second dual therapy in spite of the presence of the
rtM204V/I, rtA181V, and rtN236T mutations also remains
unclear. One explanation could be that the rt204 and
rt236 mutations are not present on the same genome and
that the low level of rt204 mutant observed with the
ARMS assay at the beginning of the dual therapy did not
prevent the biochemical and virological response. The different percentages of mutated strains rtM204V/I and
rtN236T observed with the ARMS assay argue in favor of
this hypothesis, but the significance of these low percentages is questionable. Thus, only clonal sequencing analysis could confirm the presence of these two mutations on
different strains [20].

Conclusion
This case illustrates that rtM204V/I, rtA181V, and rtN236T
resistance mutations can coexist in a patient. We conclude
that given an unfavorable resistance profile this case suggests the possibility, when no other treatment option is
open, of recycling previously used drugs in combination
therapy.
