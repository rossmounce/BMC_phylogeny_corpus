<p>The fraction of experimentally
Conserved non-coding sequences active conserved non-coding sequences within any given cell type is low, so classical assays are unlikely
to expose their potential.</p>

Abstract
Background: Conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome are approximately tenfold
more abundant than known genes, and have been hypothesized to mark the locations of cisregulatory elements. However, the global contribution of conserved non-coding sequences to the
transcriptional regulation of human genes is currently unknown. Deeply conserved elements
shared between humans and teleost fish predominantly flank genes active during morphogenesis
and are enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements. However, such deeply conserved
elements account for <1% of the conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome, which
are predominantly mammalian.
Results: We explored the regulatory potential of a large sample of these 'common' conserved
non-coding sequences using a variety of classic assays, including chromatin remodeling, and
enhancer/repressor and promoter activity. When tested across diverse human model cell types,
we find that the fraction of experimentally active conserved non-coding sequences within any given
cell type is low (approximately 5%), and that this proportion increases only modestly when
considered collectively across cell types.
Conclusions: The results suggest that classic assays of cis-regulatory potential are unlikely to
expose the functional potential of the substantial majority of mammalian conserved non-coding
sequences in the human genome.

Background

Identification of non-coding sequences that regulate the timing, magnitude, and environmental responsiveness of human
gene expression is a major goal of modern genetics. Comparison of the human genome with those of other mammalian
species has revealed the existence of >250,000 non-proteincoding sequences that appear to have been conserved through
purifying natural selection [1]. Such conserved non-coding
sequences (CNCSs) are widely believed to harbor the majority
of human non-coding nucleotides under selection [2,3] and
have also been proposed to encompass the preponderance of
cis-regulatory sequences important for control of human
genes [4].
The contribution of CNCSs to gene regulation has been
reported in several studies [5-10], the results of which are
summarized in Table S1 in Additional data file 2. At present,
however, it remains unclear what proportion of CNCSs in the
human genome mark classic transcriptional regulatory
sequences, and what the relationship is between regulatory
potential and degree of evolutionary constraint. The available
literature is derived largely from gene-centric [8-12] or large
scale transgenic studies [5-7,13] that preferentially focus on
extremely conserved sequences (defined by phylogeny depth
or constraint score). As such, studies exploring the cis-regulatory potential of the most frequent class of CNCSs - those elements shared amongst mammals only - in an unbiased
fashion are currently lacking.
With the exception of some distal enhancers and locus control
regions capable of operating over long distances [14,15], the
vast majority of classic cis-regulatory elements appear to be
located nearby their cognate genes. By contrast, a puzzling
and striking feature of CNCSs is their concentration in genepoor regions of the genome [2], where large regions harboring hundreds or even thousands of CNCSs may occur up to
several megabases distant from the nearest annotated genes.
Recently, deletion of two such regions comprising a total of
>1,200 CNCSs and spanning approximately 2 Mb of the
mouse genome was found to yield a normal adult phenotype
[16]. Interestingly, most of the deleted sequences were mammalian-limited conserved sequences.
In this study we aimed to address two major gaps in our
understanding of the regulatory potential of human CNCSs.
First, we sought to assess mammalian CNCSs (versus those
exhibiting deeper levels of conservation), which are by far the
most common class in the human genome. Exploring the regulatory potential of mammalian CNCSs should provide
insights into the general contribution of CNCSs to human
gene regulation and also the significance of evolutionary features such as reduced versus extended phylogenetic depth in
predicting CNCS regulatory activity. Second, we aimed to
assay regulatory potential in human cells. The latter was
motivated by the fact that in the majority of cases, the ascription of cis-regulatory function to human CNCSs has been on

the basis of their activity in murine cells (Table S1 in Additional data file 2). This introduces a potentially significant
confounding variable, since any genomic sequence that
shares sequence identity between human and mouse is, on
average, under greater selection in the mouse versus the
human. Thus, given the relative inefficiency of purifying
selection in the human genome, it is possible that a given
sequence might exhibit a certain kind of function in the
mouse without retaining that capacity in the human.
To address these questions, we used a large collection of
CNCSs from human chromosome 21 (Chr21) as models, and
assayed classic cis-regulatory function by applying a variety of
standard experimental assays, including chromatin structure/remodeling, and enhancer/repressor and promoter
activity. We find that only a small fraction of mammalian
CNCSs display results compatible with classic regulatory
potential when assayed across a panel of well-studied model
human cell types representing a broad range of tissue lineages. The observed pattern of activity renders it unlikely that
mammalian CNCSs play an expansive and direct role in the
transcriptional regulation of most human genes in model cell
types, and by extension in adult-stage tissues generally. The
results as such do not disclaim a regulatory role for CNCSs.
Rather, they raise the possibility that a substantial proportion
of these elements - which are clearly under active and recent
selection [2,17] - may in fact encode either non-regulatory
functional elements, or may harbor novel functional activities
that are not captured in current widely used assays of cis-regulatory potential and function.

Results

Previously, we described 2,262 CNCSs on human Chr21
defined by strong human-mouse sequence identity ( 70%
over  100 bp with no gaps) and the absence of evidence of
transcription across a wide range of human tissues [18].
Although defined originally on the basis of homology with the
mouse, the vast majority of these CNCSs are conserved across
mammals [19]. The sequence features and trans-mammalian
conservation patterns of this set of Chr21 CNCSs do not differ
from similarly selected CNCSs from other human autosomes
[2].
A universal feature of active or potential enhancers, promoters, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions is remodeling of local chromatin architecture, resulting in markedly
increased physical accessibility of the underlying DNA template [20]. Chromatin remodeling is classically assessed by
measuring sensitivity to DNaseI cleavage in vivo, in which
context cis-regulatory elements appear as DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) [20]. DNaseI hypersensitivity mapping
has been widely exploited for the study of diverse cis-elements, both as a tool for de novo localization and as a mechanism for profiling the activity of regulatory elements across
multiple cell types [21-26]. DNaseI hypersensitivity has the

possibility not only to detect active elements, but also those
that are potentially active or 'poised' in their cognate tissues
[20]. Furthermore, many elements that are active mainly in
one tissue or developmental stage tend to retain chromatin
remodeling and DNaseI hypersensitivity in related tissues or
subsequent stages when they are not functionally critical [21].
It is expected, therefore, that any CNCS that is functioning as
a classic transcriptional control element in a given assayed
cell type will evidence chromatin remodeling and hypersensitivity to DNaseI.
The advent of high-throughput real-time PCR-based methods
for assaying DNaseI sensitivity and hypersensitivity [27,28]
renders feasible efficient directed interrogation of chromatin
remodeling status of a large collection of CNCSs. We therefore randomly selected 192 elements from the set of CNCSs
defined using prior criteria ( 70% over  100 bp with no gaps
[29]) and assayed these for DNaseI hypersensitivity in eight
diverse human cell types (Figure 1 and Table S2 in Additional
data file 2). This revealed that approximately 13% (25/192) of
CNCSs formed DHSs in one or more cell types. Of these, 14
were cell type-specific, while 11 CNCSs formed DHSs in 2-8
cell types. The proportion of CNCSs in a hyperaccessible chromatin state in any given cell type was in the range 1.6-4.7% (39/192). However, a significant number of CNCS DHSs from
each cell type were shared with other cell types. For example,
of the 15 CNCS DHSs detected in colonic (CACO2), pancreatic
(PANC1), and neural (SK-N-SH) cells, 13 were detected in
other cell types. The low incremental gain in cell type-specific
CNCS DHSs suggests that adding progressively larger cell/
tissue panels is highly unlikely to increase markedly the over-

all proportion of CNCSs that manifest DNaseI hypersensitivity.
Several recent reports suggest that approximately 25% of
deeply conserved CNCSs associated with genes active during
early development encode enhancer elements [5], and that
this property is evident in up to 50% of a highly select CNCS
subgroup exhibiting extreme conservation [5,13]. Since some
well-characterized developmental enhancers exhibit DNaseI
hypersensitivity that persists beyond the developmental stage
in which their principal activities are manifest, we reasoned
that if the persistence of DNaseI hypersensitivity was a general feature of developmental CNCS enhancers, then assay of
CNCSs in adult-stage tissues might provide a window into
early developmental potential. We therefore examined a set
of 11 pan-vertebrate CNCSs shown previously to function as
developmental enhancers in vivo or in vitro [5,10], including
four multi-species conserved sequences from the RET locus
(MCS1-3, MCS-32, MCS-8.7, MCS+9.7) [10] and seven developmental enhancers in transgenic mice (UCE1, 52, 74, 76,
260, 359 and DC2) [5]. We tested these elements for DNaseI
hypersensitivity in intestinal (CACO2), lymphoblastoid
(GM06990), cervical (HeLa), myeloid (HL60), and neural
(SKnSH) cell types. Of 11 elements, 82% (9/11) were DNaseI
hypersensitive in at least one cell type (Table 1). These results
indicate that a surprisingly large proportion of developmental
enhancers may exhibit persistent chromatin accessibility in
model cell types, expanding the functional reach of the assay
beyond a specific cognate cell type.
We next examined the overlap between DHSs and CNCSs in
large contiguous Chr21 regions (total 2.2 Mb) by analyzing

CNCSs were in accessible chromatin in at least one cell type,
comparable to the figure (13%) obtained from the random
sample described above. In both samples, a significant
number of CNCS DHSs were shared amongst more than one
cell type. As such, the differential discovery rate of new CNCS
DHSs as a function of additional cell types tested appears to
fall off sharply.

chromatin accessibility to DNaseI in various cell types as a
continuous function of genome position using tiled real-time
PCR primers [27]. We examined two large continuous
regions: a 1.7 Mb tract (Chr21:32,668,237-34,364,221) containing 32 genes and 95 CNCSs, and a 500 kb tract
(Chr21:39,244,467-39,744,466) containing 7 genes and 9
CNCSs. These regions were spanned by 7,211 PCR amplicons
(average length approximately 225 bp) tiled end-to-end,
achieving gross genomic coverage of 86%, with all CNCSs
covered directly by the tiling path. DNaseI sensitivity was
quantified across four diverse cell types: immortalized
human primary B-lymphoblastoid cells (line GM06990; Coriell); colonic adenocarcinoma cells (CACO2; American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC)); HeLa cells; and SKnSH neuroblastoma cells (ATCC) (Figure 2). Four replicates were performed for each amplicon and tissue and non-DNaseI-treated
control, yielding 242,176 measurements. The relationship
between DHSs and CNCSs across the 1.7 Mb region is shown
in Figure 2a. We mapped 416 DHSs within these regions, of
which 179 were present in two or more tissues (Table 2; Table

Summary of DHS-CNCS overlaps derived from data shown in Figure 2.
*There were 179 DHSs were present at the same genomic location in
two or more tissues. †One DHS overlap contained three smaller
CNCSs; thus, there are 18 CNCSs overlapping DHSs.

To determine the degree to which CNCSs were enriched in
DHSs over random expectation, we used a permutation
approach. We generated 1,000 random samples (restricted to
the tiling path) equal to the number and size of DHSs, and
computed the overlap with CNCSs (Figure 2b). When DHSs
from all four tissues are considered collectively, CNCSs are
not significantly enriched in DHSs; indeed, the overlap
between the two is squarely within the realm of random
expectation.
In summary, the above results suggest collectively that only a
small fraction of CNCSs manifest the characteristic in vivo
chromatin remodeling profile of classic cis-regulatory elements when examined in model cell types, and furthermore
that the proportion of CNCSs encoding a DHS is unlikely to
increase substantially by adding additional cell types due to
diminishing returns.
We next turned to examination of the behavior of a random
subsample of Chr21 CNCSs in another class of widely applied
experimental assays of regulatory potential, transient
enhancer/repressor and promoter reporter systems. The ability to modulate expression of a linked minimal promoter element in transient cell transfections is a widely exploited in
vitro test of cis-regulatory potential; however, the correspondence with in vivo assays is far less than perfect [6]. In
the present context, however, transient reporter assays may,
in fact, have some advantage as they may expose minimal cisregulatory potential that is repressed in the context of native
chromatin.
We randomly selected 71 Chr21 CNCSs ( 80% human-mouse
identity over  100 bp with no gaps; Figure 3; Table S4 in
Additional data file 2); only 6 of the elements overlapped
DHSs, as would be expected for a sample of this size. The
genomic characteristics of the selected sequences are shown
in Table 3. Briefly, they do not differ significantly from the
overall set of highly conserved CNCSs in key parameters such
as genomic distribution relative to annotated genes and G+C
content. For comparison, we randomly selected 21 non-CNCS
single-copy Chr21 sequences as controls (Figure 3; Table S4
in Additional data file 2); control sequences did not differ significantly from CNCSs in length, G+C content, and genomic
distribution (Table 3). We then tested both CNCSs and control sequences for their potential to activate or repress a minimal promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene (Figure S1a

in Additional data file 1). We separately cloned CNCSs and
control sequences upstream of the TK minimal promoter and
measured luciferase activity in human embryonic kidney cells
(293T) and hepatic carcinoma cells (Huh7) (the two cell lines
are routinely used in the laboratory and they are easily transfectable). We used a co-transfected renilla reporter (to control for transfection efficiency; Figure S1b in Additional data
file 1) and computed the firefly:renilla luciferase ratio (see
Materials and methods). For each of the 92 constructs, we
performed three experiments with three biological replicates
each (828 total data points). We first determined the luci-

ferase activity driven by each construct by normalizing the
firefly:renilla ratio to the basal activity of the pTAL-luc vector. In these assays, CNCSs and control fragments displayed
similar activity patterns in the studied cell lines (two-sample
t-test, P-value > 0.5; Figure 4a,b, control versus randomly
selected CNCS boxplots). Figure 4c,d shows normalized luciferase values for each CNCS construct expressed as the fold

selected; c) 21 control single-copy sequences chosen randomly along Chr21; d) 23 CNCSs from Dermitzakis et al. coinciding with Sp1/Myc/p53 binding

tive evidence of minimal regulatory potential. However, of 71
CNCSs, only 9 elements (12.7%) met this criterion in either
cell type. We found no correlation between the ability to modulate transcription of the reporter gene and either CNCS
length or degree of conservation; nor was this ability related
to CNCS position along Chr21 nor CNCS localization in intergenic versus intronic space (P > 0.05 for all, Spearman correlation).
We next considered whether a lack of evident regulatory
potential might be due to: the orientation of the CNCSs with
respect to the TK promoter; the inability of the assay to identify positive events generally; and whether the cell types we
studied were not particularly fertile ground. To address orientation-dependence, we re-cloned 16 CNCSs selected randomly in the opposite orientation and assayed for luciferase
activity in 293T cells. Of these, only 2 (12.5%) showed a significant polarity-dependent transcriptional activation/
repression (data not shown), indicating that orientation could
not explain the observed lack of activity. To address the general permissiveness of the assay, we examined a separate set
of 23 CNCSs that were reported to contain binding sites for
the ubiquitous transcriptional factors Sp1, cMyc and one
more specialized transcriptional regulator, p53 (Figure 3)
[30], reasoning that such sequences should be more likely to
exhibit classic enhancer- or repressor-type activity that
should be detectable in a reporter assay. Indeed, these elements displayed a considerably higher mean level of luciferase activity in both 293T cells and Huh7 cells, and a
correspondingly higher proportion of elements with significant elevations (P < 0.05) versus random CNCSs (17.4% versus 5.6% in 293T cells and 21.7% versus 7% in Huh7 cells;

Figure 4a,b,e,f). This demonstrated that the assay system
was, in fact, permissive for regulatory activity.
Next we examined whether combining current gene annotation information with CNCSs might systematically expose a
particular class of cis-regulatory sequences such as transcriptional promoters. Previous studies suggest that the majority
of human promoters overlap sequences with varying degrees
of evolutionarily conservation [31,32]. We therefore identified Chr21 CNCSs situated within 1 kb of the annotated 5' end
of a known gene. This revealed a total of 44 CNCSs (Figure 3),
of which 18 were contained within closely spaced clusters of 2
or more CNCSs.
To test the potential of these proximal CNCSs to function as
transcriptional promoters, we subcloned 14 singleton CNCSs
and three CNCS clusters in their native orientation upstream
of a luciferase gene in an episomal vector [33] (Figure S1c, d
in Additional data file 1) and assayed luciferase activity following transfection into 293T cells (Figure 5a). We observed
significant activation of luciferase transcription by 7/17 (41%)
of the tested constructs; no luciferase transcription was
driven by the vector only or by CNCSs mapping >1 kb from
known genes (n = 3). While evincing a higher success rate
than the enhancer assay, the results suggest that, overall, only
a small fraction of all Chr21 CNCSs putatively function as
transcriptional promoters. Those results are consistent with
the low predicted fraction of conserved tissue-specific promoters identified in a previous computational study [34].
Moreover, it is notable that all of the sequences testing positive for promoter activity mapped to evolutionarily conserved
CpG islands [32,35]. An additional feature of CpG island promoter regions is their enrichment in bidirectional promoters

[36]. This prompted us to analyze the bidirectional potential
of the putative CNCS promoters (n = 6) by testing the putative
promoter CNCSs in the reverse orientation; all were able to
drive the expression of the reporter gene independently of the
strand they were cloned into, suggesting that these are indeed
bidirectional promoters (Figure 5a). By comparison, none of
the seven CNCS constructs negative in the first test for promoter activity were able to drive expression of the luciferase
reporter when cloned in the opposite orientation. In summary, 19.5% of the randomly assayed CNCSs were positive in
either the enhancer/repressor or the promoter assays (Figure
5b).
Taken together, our results from multi-cell-type application
of both in vivo chromatin remodeling and reporter assays in
human model cell types render it unlikely that the majority of
'common' mammalian CNCSs fulfill a classic cis-regulatory
role in differentiated human cells that is directly assayable
using standard experimental methods.

Discussion

The global contribution of CNCSs to the regulation of human
genes has not yet been fully defined. A number of studies have
reported the potential of CNCSs to function as enhancer
sequences in the context of specific gene systems [9-12,3739]. It is notable, however, that the CNCSs employed in prior
studies were highly ascertained. For example, CNCSs that are
conserved between humans and fish or that are under
stronger evolutionary constraint, are dramatically overrepresented (or, in some cases, targeted exclusively [5-7,13,40]),
though they account for <1% of all CNCSs. Additionally,
human-fish and other extremely conserved CNCSs are highly
concentrated around genes involved in early developmental
processes [7,13] and thus do not represent the genomic mainstream.
Our study focused on a randomly selected set of 'common'
mammalian (and specifically human-mouse) CNCSs, which
account for the vast majority of the identified conserved non-

coding elements in the human genome. Our results suggest
that the overall proportion of CNCSs that can be expected to
exhibit classic cis-regulatory activity in standard experimental assays using model human cell types is low - on the order
of approximately 15-20% when examined collectively across a
range of cell types, and considerably lower (approximately 57%) within any given individual cell type. If standard assays of
cis-regulatory activity are a reliable reflection of transcriptional control potential, the global proportion of transcriptional regulatory activity of human genes accounted for by
CNCSs is likely to be low, simply owing to the fact that the
absolute number of CNCSs that evidence a classic experimental regulatory phenotype within any given cell type is on a par
with the total number of genes expressed within that cell type

(assuming 10-15,000 expressed genes per cell type, and
approximately 15,000 (equivalent to 5% of 250,000) active
CNCSs). However, the well-documented clustering of CNCSs
in the genome suggests a stoichiometry of less than one per
active gene. This finding is in keeping with the observed discordance between experimentally annotated functional elements and conserved sequences [26]. It is thus entirely
reasonable to expect that not all of the transcriptional regulatory elements are conserved, nor that all of the CNCSs are
transcriptional control elements.
Some caveats attend certain specific conclusions from the
present study. Firstly, it is probable that sampling additional
cell types will disclose additional CNCSs coinciding with

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R168

Genome Biology 2008,

DHSs or exhibiting activity in reporter assays. However, this
is unlikely to have a substantial impact on assessment of the
overall proportion of CNCSs with regulatory potential.
Because many CNCSs show regulatory potential in more than
one cell type, expanding the tissue spectrum has a sharply
diminishing rate of return. It is highly improbable, therefore,
that the majority of CNCSs in the human genome will ultimately be found to harbor classic cis-regulatory activity that
is evident in standard assays.
Secondly, it may be argued that the proper experimental
models were not employed. Deeply conserved sequences
(particularly those shared with teleost fish) have frequently
been studied in vivo, with a prominent finding that many elements behave as tissue- or developmental-stage specific
enhancers [5]. However, even though the transcriptional
enhancing potential of such elements may be manifest only in
a restricted cell subset or time point, many such elements
exhibit persistent chromatin remodeling in non-cognate tissues. Indeed, assaying 11 such elements in our model cell
types revealed chromatin remodeling at a majority, demonstrating the sensitivity of remodeling assays for exposing the
regulatory potential of elements that may function predominantly at earlier developmental stages or even in other cell
types.
Thirdly, it is possible that the environment of the model
immortalized cell types employed may not be permissive for
the expression of CNCS regulatory function. However, there
are no studies that demonstrate a systematic deficit of this
nature between immortalized cells versus in vivo transgenic
studies. Consistent with this, previous studies of CNCS regulatory activity show consistency between results from immortalized lines and in vivo results from transgenics [39,41-43].
Additionally, the cell types employed include well-studied
model systems in which the cis-regulatory elements of major
human gene systems such as the alpha- and beta-globins and
apolipoproteins have been delineated, with comprehensive
validation in transgenic assays.
Fourthly, it is possible that the results obtained from the
transfection assays are low because CNCS regulatory potential is expressed combinatorially - that is, that the elements do
not function individually, particularly out of genomic context.
While theoretically possible, this cannot explain the failure to
observe chromatin remodeling/DNaseI sensitivity at these
elements in vivo where they do retain their native chromosomal environment, including neighboring CNCSs.
Finally, consideration of genomic context is likely to be
important in determining the proportion of CNCSs that evidence classic cis-regulatory properties. For example, it is possible that this proportion may increase in the context of
certain classes of human genes, such as those expressed in a
cell type-specific fashion. Our results should therefore be considered to represent only the average situation.

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R168

Attanasio et al. R168.9

The present study does not consider the question of whether
CNCSs encode other classes of functional elements. In addition to classic transcriptional cis-regulatory activity (that is,
regulation of the rate of transcription and its spatial and temporal distribution), CNCSs have been proposed to function in
the regulation of alternative splicing [44-46], the general
modulation of chromatin structure [47], and as unconventional non-coding RNA species [48,49]. In the present context, the last is perhaps less likely for the tested set of CNCSs
since we specifically excluded elements that showed prior evidence of transcription. Moreover, since 80% of the CNCSs we
studied were in the intergenic space, they are unlikely to function in the regulation of splicing. If CNCSs had a direct role in
modulating chromatin structure as, for example, an insulator
or boundary element, this would have been detected in our
chromatin studies since such elements universally evidence
DNaseI hypersensitivity. However, the possibility remains
that CNCSs may function indirectly in chromatin structure by
serving as the substrate for as-yet-undescribed chromatin
modifying factors that do not give rise to focal chromatin
remodeling and altered accessibility. The localization of
CNCSs in gene poor regions makes them attractive targets for
involvement in the process of large-scale genome repression.
It is also possible that the CNCSs we tested lacked certain conserved features important for cis-regulatory activity, which
are present in more deeply/extremely conserved elements.
For example, Prabhakar et al. [40] report a strong correlation
between sequence conservation rank (from extreme to shallow conservation) and in vivo regulatory activity. A similar
correlation was observed by Visel et al. [13]. However, the
vast majority of CNCSs we tested are not comparable by conservation rank to the extremely conserved sequences tested
by others [13,40]. It is therefore possible that more extremely
conserved sequences would have been considerably more
active in our functional assays. However, even if all extremely
conserved CNCSs were ultimately found to be transcriptional
regulatory elements, this would not account for the vast
majority of CNCSs clearly under selection in mammals.

Conclusion

We present a systematic assessment of the performance of
CNCSs in human cells using classic assays of cis-regulatory
function. The results suggest three basic conclusions. First,
on a practical level, the 'functionality' of CNCSs at large
should not be excluded on the basis of lack of activity in classic cis-regulatory assays. Second, on a conceptual level, the
results highlight a need for a fresh look at the possible roles
CNCSs may be playing in modulating genome function. The
general paucity of positive findings in traditional experimental assays, coupled with the peculiar distribution of CNCSs in
the human genome and the fact that CNCSs are under selection in humans, raise the question of whether most mammalian CNCSs play an unconventional role in genome activity.
The possibility remains that a significant fraction of these ele-

ments play a role in genome structure or activity that departs
significantly from current concepts of gene regulation and
will thus not become evident in standard experimental
assays. Third, with respect to analysis of gene regulation in
definitive human cells, it should not be assumed a priori that
common CNCSs comprise the dominant mediators of cis-regulatory function. Therefore attention should be given to identifying cis-regulatory elements in a functionally driven
manner. Our results therefore highlight both the need to
investigate further the role of CNCSs in genome function, and
the continued requirement for direct interrogation of the
genome using biochemical and other functional assays.

Materials and methods
DNase I hypersensitivity
We performed DNaseI hypersensitivity testing using quantitative chromatin profiling as described in Dorschner et al.
[27], and Sabo et al. [24]. We cultured the following cell types
in humidified incubators at 30-37°C and 5% CO2 in air, using
RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and Penn Strep:
GM06990 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ, USA); HeLaS3
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA); SKnSH (ATCC); PANC1
(ATCC); NCI-H460 (ATCC); K562 (ATCC); CACO2 (ATCC);
and HepG2 (ATCC). SKnSH cells were differentiated into
neuroblasts by adding 6 M all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at
approximately 50% confluency for 48 h prior to harvest. Primary human renal epithelial cells (HRE) were obtained from
Cambrex Biosciences (now Lonza; Baltimore, MD, USA) and
cultured according to the supplier's protocol. To remove
background introduced from actively dividing cells, we used a
standard approach for synchronizing cells in G1 by sequential
temperature shifts. DNaseI treatments were performed as
described previously [27]. DNaseI hypersensitive sites were
identified as clusters (one or more contiguous amplicons)
with DNaseI sensitivity ratios (copies in DNaseI treated versus control) that exceeded the 95% confidence bound on outliers relative to the moving DNaseI sensitivity baseline
determined by a LOESS approach as described [27].

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and transiently transfected
with 100 ng of each pTAL-Luc CNCS construct, along with 8
ng of control plasmid expressing the renilla gene (pRL-SV40,
Promega). Each construct was assayed in triplicate in three
independent experiments. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay
System (Promega) and a LumiCount™ microplate luminometer (Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA).
We determined the luciferase activity driven by each construct by first measuring the firefly to renilla luciferase ratio
for each transfection. In a second step, the signal was normalized to the control ratio (pTAL-Luc:pRL-SV40) included on
each plate. The strength of the putative regulatory element
was then assessed by comparison to the mean activity of the
set of controls. This normalization to the mean activity of the
controls gives us the fold change in luciferase activity plotted
in Figure 4c-f. Twofold change significance is assessed by the
one-sample t-test statistic test.

Promoter assays
Coordinates of the 5' end of all known and Refseq Chr21 genes
were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser [50] and
intersect with the 2,262 Chr21 CNCSs [18] using the Galaxy
Browser [51]. CNCSs mapping within 1 kb of the transcription
start site were retained in the 'potential promoter' pool. As
above, CNCSs or CNCS-clusters were amplified directly from
human genomic DNA and cloned in their native orientation
into the pREP4-Luc episomal vector [33]. To test for a bidirectional promoter, 13 out of the 17 constructs were also
cloned in reverse orientation. Transfections of cells with 100
ng of the experimental vector (CNCSs-pREP4) along with 16
ng of the internal control vector (pREP7-Luc, renilla) per well
were performed as described above.

Enhancer assays
293T and Huh7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM Glutamax
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% streptomycinpenicillin. Each CNCS was amplified by PCR from human
genomic DNA with primers with SalI overhangs (primer
sequences available upon request). The restriction digested
and purified PCR products were then cloned non-directionally into the XhoI site of the luciferase reporter vector (pTALLuc, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). All constructs were
verified by direct sequencing.
Transfections were performed with Fugene reagent as
described by the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science (Indiannapolis, IN, USA). Briefly, 1 × 104 293T cells/well
and 1.5 × 104 Huh7 cells/well were grown into 96 well plates
