Abstract
Background: HOXB1 plays a major role in brainstem morphogenesis and could partly determine the cranial
circumference in conjunction with HOXA1. In our sample, HOXA1 alleles significantly influence head growth rates both
in autistic patients and in population controls. An initial report, suggesting that HOXB1 could confer autism
vulnerability in interaction with HOXA1, was not confirmed by five small association studies.
Methods: Our sample includes 269 autistic individuals, belonging to 219 simplex and 28 multiplex families. A
mutational analysis of the two exons and flanking intronic sequences of the HOXB1 gene was carried out in 84 autistic
patients by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, followed by DNA sequencing. Identified rare variants
were then searched by a restriction analysis in 236 autistic patients and 325-345 controls. Case-control and familybased association studies were performed on two common variants in 169 Italian patients versus 184 Italian controls
and in 247 trios.
Results: We identified three common polymorphisms, rs72338773 [c.82insACAGCGCCC (INS/nINS)], rs12939811
[c.309A>T (Q103H)], and rs7207109 [c.450G>A (A150A)] and three rare variants, namely IVS1+63G>A, rs35115415
[c.702G>A (V234V)] and c.872_873delinsAA (S291N). SNPs rs72338773 and rs12939811 were not associated with
autism, using either a case-control (alleles, exact P = 0.13) or a family-based design [transmission/disequilibrium test
(TDT)χ2 = 1.774, P = 0.183]. The rare variants, all inherited from one of the parents, were present in two Italian and in two
Caucasian-American families. Autistic probands in two families surprisingly inherited a distinct rare variant from each
parent. The IVS1+63A allele was present in 3/690 control chromosomes, whereas rare alleles at rs35115415 and
c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) were not found in 662 and 650 control chromosomes, respectively. The INS-T309 allele
influenced head size, but its effect appears more modest and shows no interaction with HOXA1 alleles. The INS-T309
allele is also associated with more severe stereotypic behaviours, according to ADI-R scores (N = 60 patients, P < 0.01).
Conclusions: HOXB1 mutations do not represent a common cause of autism, nor do HOXB1 common variants play
important roles in autism vulnerability. HOXB1 provides minor, albeit detectable contributions to head circumference in
autistic patients, with HOXA1 displaying more prominent effects. HOXB1 variants may modulate the clinical phenotype,
especially in the area of stereotypic behaviours.

small number of major loci was initially predicted to
explain the disease in the majority of affected individuals
[2]. However, the number of common genetic variants
conferring vulnerability to autism has grown well beyond
the initial expectations, in addition to several rare variants identified to this date, each explaining the disease in
a very small number of patients [[3-5]. The genetic
underpinnings of autism spectrum disorders have thus
proven to be far more complex than expected, likely due

to genetic heterogeneity, epistasis and gene-environment
interactions [3-5].
Several lines of evidence have demonstrated altered
prenatal neurodevelopment as central to autism pathogenesis. Abnormal neurodevelopment possibly occurring
in the first trimester of pregnancy best accounts for the
microscopic alterations shown by post-mortem neuroanatomical studies of the brains of autistic patients [6,7].
Phenotypic evidence also supports a prenatal aetiology, as
fine motor abnormalities are detectable at 4-6 months of
age or even at birth in children later developing autism
[8]. Finally, a prenatal time window as early as days 20-25
post-fertilization appears crucial to autism's aetiology,
since exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy leads to
autism only if occurring within this limited developmental interval [9]. Genes encoding proteins involved in early
neural development could thus encompass polymorphisms or mutations contributing to the disease process.
The HOXB1 gene, located on human chr 17q21.32, is a
member of the HOX gene family of homeobox transcription factors and critically involved in the development of
the brain stem. HOXB1 gene expression is limited to
rhombomere 4 and to neural crest cells migrating out of
this region, resulting in a gross reduction or complete loss
of the facial motor nucleus in HOXB1 mutant mice
[10,11]. A similar loss of facial motor neurons has been
described in one autistic brain [12]. HOXB1 gene expression occurs very early in mouse development (E8.5-E9.5)
[10,11], at a time, interestingly, overlapping with the window of maximal prenatal sensitivity in rodent models of
autism [13]. HOXB1 gene expression is also strongly upregulated by HOXA1 [14] and the two genes indeed synergize in patterning hindbrain structures, cranial nerves
and pharyngeal arches, so that double-mutant mice display prominent malformations while single mutants suffer much milder abnormalities [14-16]. A gene × gene
interaction between HOXB1 and HOXA1 gene variants
was initially proposed to contribute to autism [17]. In our
sample, the HOXA1 c.218A>G [His73Arg] polymorphism
was significantly associated with autism, although we
found an association with the A218 and not the G218
allele [18], in contrast to the original study [17]. Moreover, HOXA1 c.218A>G alleles were found to significantly influence head growth rates, and not final head
size, both in autistic patients and in typically developing
children [18,19]. The latter result is especially interesting,
considering that approximately 20% of autistic patients
consistently show macrocephaly and may represent an
endophenotypic subgroup possibly sharing common
pathophysiological underpinnings [20,21]. Following the
initial positive study [17], five studies subsequently
reported negative association findings using HOXB1 gene
markers [22-26]. However, the sample sizes assessed in all
of these studies were too small to detect moderate-size

effects and rare variants of potential clinical relevance
(see Discussion). Furthermore, only two of these studies
apparently performed mutational searches by DNA
sequencing [22,23]. The present study was thus undertaken to screen a larger sample of autistic patients, unaffected controls and nuclear families for HOXB1 gene
mutations, rare variants and common polymorphisms,
either causing the disorder, conferring autism vulnerability, influencing the clinical expression of the disease, or
modulating cranial growth rates by themselves or in
interaction with HOXA1 gene variants.

Methods
Subjects

Families were recruited for this study based on the presence of a proband diagnosed with primary autism spectrum disorder (idiopathic, non-syndromic ASD). The
clinical sample includes 269 autistic individuals and 593
first-degree relatives, belonging to 219 simplex and 28
multiplex families. In reference to ethnicity, these families
encompass 171 simplex and one multiplex Italian families, as well as 48 simplex and 27 multiplex CaucasianAmerican families, the latter including 15 simplex and 23
multiplex families obtained from the Autism Genetic
Resource Exchange (AGRE) repository. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the autistic patients are
summarized in Table 1. In addition, we also recruited 345
normal adult controls (M/F ratio = 2.43; mean age ± standard deviation = 33.1 ± 9.2 years, range 18-53), among
blood donors at the Haematology Unit of 'Casa Sollievo
della Sofferenza' hospital (S Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy)
and self-reporting no history of major psychiatric disorders or psychotropic drug use for at least 6 months prior
to blood donation. This clinical sample largely overlaps
with the sample assessed in our previous works on the
HOXA1 gene [18,19]. The size of subgroups of patients
and families involved in the different studies described in
the present report are summarized in Additional File 1:
Table S1.
Inclusion criteria and diagnostic screening methods
have been previously reported [18,19,21]. Briefly, patients
fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) [27] were
screened for non-syndromic autism using magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, audiometry, urinary aminoacid and organic acid measurements,
cytogenetic and fragile-X testing. Patients with dysmorphic features were excluded, even in the absence of
detectable cytogenetic alterations. Patients with sporadic
seizures (< 1 every 6 months) were included; patients
with frequent seizures or focal neurological deficits were
excluded. Autistic behaviours were assessed using the

adaptive functioning was assessed using the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Scales; intellectual quotient was determined using either the Griffith Mental Developmental
Scales, the Coloured Raven Matrices, the Bayley Developmental Scales or the Leiter International Performance
Scale. Head circumference was measured in all ASD
patients aged <16 years old and transformed into percentiles using the sex- and age-specific standard tables currently adopted in the vast majority of European countries
and by the Italian Pediatric Association, as described [21].
This study, as well as the consent form signed by all parents for themselves and their children, was approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University
Campus Bio-Medico (Rome, Italy). Controls provided
written informed consent to the use of their biomaterials
for scientific research, using the consent form approved
by the IRB of 'Casa Sollievo dalla Sofferenza' hospital (S
Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy).
Primer design and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification conditions

PCR primers were designed to amplify the two exons of
the HOXB1 gene (Ensembl: ENST00000239174) and
exon-intron boundaries, extending 30-100 bases into
intronic sequences both 5' and 3' of each exon. Primers
are described in Table 2. PCR amplifications were performed using a Gene Amp PCR System 9700 (Perkin
Elmer, CA, USA) in a final reaction volume of 25 μL containing 100 ng of genomic DNA template, 250 μM
dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primers, 1.25 U Ampli taq
GoldTM DNA polymerase (PE Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA), in 1X reaction Buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3, 50
mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2). PCR cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 12 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, annealing at temperatures reported in Table 2 for 30 s and elongation at
72°C for 10 min.
Wave® System denaturing high performance liquid
chromatography (DHPLC) analysis

PCR products from each patient and one normal control
were mixed, denaturated for 5 min at 95°C and cooled
slowly for 30 min down to 40°C in a thermal cycler, to
enable the formation of heteroduplexes. Analytical conditions for each fragment were determined using the Transgenomic WaveMaker™ Software v.4.1.44 (Transgenomic
Inc, NE, USA). Samples were run on the 3500HT Wave™
DNA Analysis System (Transgenomic). PCR amplicons
were loaded (5 μL) on a C18 reverse-phase column based
on nonporous poly (styrene/divinil-benzene) particles
(DnaSep™ column; Transgenomic). Hetero and homodu-

plex analysis was carried out with an acetonitrile gradient
formed by mixing buffer A (0.1 M TEAA) and buffer B
(0.1 M TEAA, 25% acetonitrile). Flow-rate was 0.7 mL/
min with an increase of buffer B of 2% per min for 4.5 min
and DNA was detected at 260 nm. All samples showing
an abnormal elution profile were sequenced.
Sequence analysis

PCR products of patients yielding abnormal chromatograms were purified using GFXTM PCR DNA and Gel
Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, CA, USA).
DNA sequencing was performed in a 10 μL final volume,
with 3 pmol of primer, 4-6 ng of DNA template and 2 μL
of Big Dye Terminator Ready Reaction mix v. 2.1 (PEABI, CA, USA), using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser, v.3.7 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA
sequence analysis was performed using Sequencing Analysis program v. 3.7 (PE Applied Biosystems).
Genotyping

SNP rs12939811 (Q103H) was genotyped by PCR amplification and DHPLC analysis (temperature melting
63.3°C). In order to discriminate homozygosity for the
common allele (AA) from homozygosity for the rare allele
(TT), the samples resulting in a single elution profile were
mixed with a control sample carrying the AA genotype
and were analysed again by DHPLC under at the same
temperature conditions. All samples compatible with a
TT genotype were then sequenced for confirmation.
SNPs rs72338773 (c.82insACAGCGCCC), IVS1+63G>A,
S291N and rs35115415 (V234V) were each genotyped by
PCR amplification and allele-specific restriction analysis.
Primer sequences for HOXB1 genotyping are listed in
Table 3. Briefly, restriction analyses were performed, as
follows: (a) rs72338773 (c.82insACAGCGCCC) was
amplified using primers HOXB1-F1_for/HOXB1-F1_rev;
the 365 bp fragment was digested with MspI, yielding
140, 121 and 113 bp fragments in the presence of the
insertion; (b) the IVS1+63G>A SNP was amplified with
primers IVS1+63G>A-mut_for/IVS1+63G>A_rev and
the 118 bp amplicon was digested using HphI, producing
two 83 and 35 bp fragments in the presence of the A
allele; (c) the c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) SNP was
amplified using primers S291N-mut_for/HOXB1-F5_rev
and the 366 bp fragment was digested with MnlI, yielding
186, 112bp, 50bp and 18bp fragments with the N allele;
and (d) rs35115415 (V234V) was amplified using primers
S291N-mut_for/HOXB1-F5 rev and the 366 bp fragment
was digested with FokI, yielding 335 and 31 bp in the
presence of the A allele.
Data analysis

Hardy-Weinberg analyses were performed using the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and HWE2 programs [30]. Case-control allelic and genotypic distribu-

randomly selecting one patient per multiplex family. Single-marker and family-based association analyses were
performed applying the transmission/disequilibrium test
(TDT) [31] using the TDTPHASE software of the
UNPHASED package [32]; only complete trios and one
trio per multiplex family were included in these analyses.
All family-based association analyses were carried out on
Italian and Caucasian-American families merged
together after population structure analyses provided no
evidence of genetic dyshomogeneity in a subgroup of 179
autistic patients including 155 Italians and 24 CaucasianAmericans randomly chosen one per family, genotyped at
90 unlinked SNPs distributed genome-wide and analysed
using the STRUCTURE program [33]. Since this stratification analysis did not include unaffected controls, casecontrol contrasts employed only individuals of Italian

ancestry. Power analyses were performed using P2BAT
[34]. The phylogenetic conservation of sequences encompassing HOXB1 polymorphisms was assessed by orthologue sequence alignments performed using the
ClustalW2 [35] and VISTA [36] softwares. The distributions of cranial circumference percentiles in cases and
controls were contrasted using the Mann-Whitney U test
and the Moses test of extreme reactions, to analyse differences in central tendency and dispersion, respectively
[37]. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of
mean, except for the head circumference which is
expressed as median ± interquartilic range. Two-tail P
values are reported throughout the manuscript. The outcome of analyses with phenotypic variables (items of
behavioural scales, patient and family history variables
and head circumference) underwent three levels of Bonferroni correction for multiple testing: (a) 'stringent',

Results
HOXB1 gene variants

The mutational analysis performed by DHPLC and DNA
sequencing in 84 autistic patients unveiled three common
polymorphisms and three rare variants. The common
polymorphisms, which were all previously described
[17,22,39], are: (a) rs72338773 [c.82insACAGCGCCC
(INS/nINS)], here also named c.82ins9; (b) rs12939811
[c.309A>T (Q103H)]; and (c) rs7207109 [c.450G>A
(A150A)]. The 9-bp insertion c.82insACAGCGCCC was
initially reported by Faiella et al. [39] and introduces into
the amino acid sequence the tripeptide H-S-A. Two of
the three common variants, namely rs72338773 and
rs12939811, were genotyped in 169 ASD patients and 184

controls, all of Italian ethnicity. Genotypic and allelic distributions are presented in Table 4.
The three rare variants - including (a) IVS1+63G>A, (b)
rs35115415
[c.702G>A
(V234V)]
and
(c)
c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) - were searched in a total of
236 autistic patients. In all cases, rare variants were
inherited by the proband from one of the parents, as
depicted in Figure 1. Allelic frequencies are as follows:
(a) the IVS1+63G>A was found in 3/472 (0.64%) chromosomes from ASD patients and in 3/690 (0.43%) chromosomes belonging to 345 Italian controls (patients
versus controls, P = 0.62)
(b) rs35115415 (c.702G>A) was found in one Italian
and one Caucasian-American families (2/472 = 0.42%).
This variant was not found in 662 chromosomes belonging to 331 Italian controls. This same variant is reported
in dbSNP with an allelic frequency of A = 0.02, assessed
in 21 Caucasian- and 20 African-Americans from the
Coriell Cell Repository collection of apparently healthy
individuals
(c) c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) involves the change of
contiguous base pairs (TC>AA), present on the same
chromosome inherited by the proband from the maternal
side in one Caucasian-American family (1/472 = 0.21%).

This variant was not found in 650 chromosomes belonging to 325 Italian controls.
In two families, rare variants IVS1+63G>A and
702G>A (V234V) were transmitted also to an unaffected
sibling (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analyses performed using
VISTA (Figure 2) and ClustalW2 (Figure 3) demonstrate
that especially rs35115415 [c.702G>A (V234V)] and, to
some extent, also the S291N rare variants are located in
evolutionarily conserved regions.

Case-control and family based association studies

No significant deviation from HWE was detected by
analysing HOXB1 common variants in our sample (Table
4). Case-control and family-based association studies
were performed using rs72338773 (INS/nINS) and
rs12939811 (Q103H); rs7207109 (A150A) was dropped,
because it is a synonymous variant in complete linkage

Phenotypic correlates of HOXB1 gene variants in autism

HOXB1 alleles exert a modest effect on cranial circumference in autistic patients (Figure 4). Median head sizes are
practically superimposable in autistic patients with a
presence/absence of INS and/or T309 alleles [INS present
versus INS absent = 86.25 ± 17.5 versus 82.5 ± 23.75 percentile, Mann-Whitney (M-W) U = 2609.0, P = 0.31;
T309 present versus T309 absent = 82.5 ± 17.5 versus
82.5 ± 23.75 percentile, M-W U = 2740.5, P = 0.66]. However, autistic patients carrying at least one copy of the
INS or T309 alleles display significantly less dispersion in
their head circumference distribution compared to
patients carrying the nINS/nINS or AA genotypes
(Moses test of extreme reactions, P < 0.01 for both) (Fig-

disequilibrium with rs12939811 (data not shown). The
results of the case-control study are summarized in Table
4. Neither rs72338773 nor rs12939811 show a genotypic
or allelic association with autism. Genotypic and allelic
distributions in our control sample are very similar to
those obtained in 56 CEU individuals (i.e., Utah residents
with Northern and Western European ancestry from the
CEPH collection) available in public databases [A/A = 41
(73.2%), A/T = 13 (23.2%), T/T = 2 (3.6%); allele A = 95
(0.848), allele T = 17 (0.152)] and also these do not differ
significantly from genotypic and allelic distributions
present in our autistic patients [genotype χ2 = 3.65, 2 df, P
= 0.16; allelic exact P = 0.14]. Similarly, a TDT performed
on 247 trios, including 172 Italian and 75 CaucasianAmerican trios, yields a non-significant trend toward the
overtransmission of the T309 allele from heterozygous
parents to affected offspring (transmitted:non-transmitted = 118:103; χ2 = 1.774, 1 df, P = 0.183). In accordance
with case-control results, the 9-bp insertion displays an
even smaller overtransmission for the INS allele (transmitted: non-transmitted = 127: 118; χ2 = 0.398, 1 df, P =
0.528). Collectively, our results do not support an association of large/moderate effect size between autism and
HOXB1 gene variants marked by SNPs rs72338773 and
rs12939811.

circumference range is at the 50th, 25th and 3rd percentile in ASD patients carrying the INS/INS, INS/nINS, and
nINS/nINS (or TT, AT and AA) genotype, respectively,
and all of the 7/88 (8.0%) ASD patients with head circumferences below the 25th percentile carry the nINS/nINS
and AA genotypes (Figure 4, panels C and D). Importantly, these same patients display a much more prominent effect on head size by HOXA1 c.218A>G alleles, as
previously reported [18,19] (G218 present versus G218
absent = 93.5 ± 16.9 versus 82.5 ± 23.75 percentile, M-W
U = 2841.0, P = 0.08 and Moses test, P < 1 × 10-7; (Figure
4, panel E). Finally, we find no evidence of HOXA1 ×
HOXB1 interactions, as both appear to independently
influence head circumference in autistic patients (Figure

Analyses exploring possible clinical correlates of
HOXB1 allelic status in the subset of patients characterized using the ADOS and ADI-R unveiled a possible
influence on stereotypic behaviours. Mean total C score

Discussion
The present study describes three rare (IVS1+63G>A,
V234V and S291N) and three common (c.82ins9, Q103H
and A150A) variants in the HOXB1 locus of a total sample of 269 ASD patients. No pathogenetic de novo mutation was found as all these gene variants were inherited
from one of the parents and at least two are present in
other population samples available in public databases.
Also, HOXB1 common variants do not seem to play
major roles in autism pathogenesis, although minor contributions cannot be excluded due to sample size limitations (see below). At the phenotypic level, HOXB1 alleles
appear to modulate head growth rates to a much lesser
extent compared to the HOXA1 c.218A>G SNP (Figure 4,
compare panels E versus A and B) [18,19]. In reference to
cranial circumference, we also find no evidence of genegene interaction, since both HOXA1 and HOXB1 influence head growth independently of each other (Figure
4F). Finally, preliminary analyses involving the subgroup
of patients characterized also with the ADI-R suggest that
HOXB1 alleles may influence stereotypic behaviours.
Given the relatively large number of clinical variables
assessed for association with HOXB1 alleles, this finding
survives correction for repeated measures only applying
the 'relaxed' criteria, namely those accounting for the
non-independence of several variables which are significantly cross-correlated in our sample [38].
In interpreting these results, three limitations of our
study design should be considered: (a) we have not specifically assessed for the presence of CNVs encompassing
the HOXB1 locus in our sample - from a methodological
standpoint, DHPLC is not able to distinguish true
homozygosity from deletion of one allele; (b) despite
employing a significantly larger sample size, compared to
previously published reports [17,22-26], our study is still
underpowered for common variants in the allelic frequency range of the INS and T309 alleles (see Table 5 at
allelic frequencies of 0.2-0.3) and for highly penetrant de
novo mutations with dominant effects and allelic frequency below 0.02 (Table 6 at an allelic frequency of
0.01); and (c) we cannot evaluate the possible differences
in mutation burden at this locus between patients and
controls because mutational analysis was performed only
among our patient sample.
A novel and interesting finding is represented by the
location and pattern of inheritance of rare variants. In
particular, rs35115415 [c.702G>A (V234V)] and
c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) are located in genomic
regions which have been evolutionarily conserved from
Tetraodon nigroviridis and Caenorhabditis elegans all the
way up to Homo sapiens (Figures 2 and 3). This homeo-

ence to unaffected individuals, publically available
databases report one large chorodial neovascularization
(CNV; duplication/deletion) involving HOXB1, among
many other genes, found in two of the 270 individuals of
the HapMap collection (see http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/, variation 4040, landmarks chr17:43,957,672...
44,191,836) [42], indicating that the human genome may

tolerate some deletions and duplications involving the
entire HOXB1 locus. However, the HOXB1 gene segments hosting rs35115415 [c.702G>A (V234V)] and
c.872_873delinsAA (S291N) may possibly accommodate
only the less disruptive and non-pathogenic gene variants. Another interesting issue is the parental transmission to the same autistic proband of two distinct rare
variants, one transmitted from each parent (Figure 1).
Instances where rare variants (single nucleotides and/or
CNVs) have no causal effect in heterozygous carriers but
are pathogenic in a state of compound heterozygosity are
increasingly recognized as a possible cause of autism [43].
However, the rare HOXB1 variants described in the present study do not appear pathogenic, as it is biologically
implausible that in family T24_IT, for example, the convergence of the intronic variant IVS1+63G>A and the
conserved variant 702G>A (V234V) in the same individual may bear dramatic functional consequences. Within
the framework of the 'compound heterozygosity' hypothesis, a similar phenomenon should also be occurring in at
least one other autism-causing locus. The a priori probability of the compound heterozygosity occurs by chance
at the HoxB1 locus can be estimated at 1.8 × 10-5 and 9.0
× 10-6 for families T24_IT and USA85, respectively. The
probability of this same phenomenon occurring by
chance at two separate loci in the same family is extraordinarily low, unless boosted by a deficit in genome maintenance mechanisms. Some [44,45], though not all
studies [46], support the hypothesis that a small, yet a sizable minority of autism families may display an increased
degree of genomic instability. This hypothesis, which is
clearly not addressed in the present report, will be the
object of further investigation

Conclusions
In summary, our data indicate that: (a) HOXB1 gene variants, either rare or common, do not exert large or moderate effects on affection status in autism spectrum
disorders, while minor contributions cannot be excluded
due to sample size limitations; (b) modulatory effects on
head growth rates are compatible with the developmental
roles of this homeobox gene: and (c) HOXB1 could influence the clinical autistic phenotype in the area of stereotypic behaviours.
The peculiar coincidence of two distinct rare variants
inherited by the autistic probands from both parents in
two families raises interest in dysfunctional genome
maintenance mechanisms in a subgroup of ASD patients.
