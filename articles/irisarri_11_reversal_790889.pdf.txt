Reversal to air-driven sound production revealed
by a molecular phylogeny of tongueless frogs,
family Pipidae

Abstract
Background: Evolutionary novelties often appear by conferring completely new functions to pre-existing structures
or by innovating the mechanism through which a particular function is performed. Sound production plays a
central role in the behavior of frogs, which use their calls to delimit territories and attract mates. Therefore, frogs
have evolved complex vocal structures capable of producing a wide variety of advertising sounds. It is generally
acknowledged that most frogs call by moving an air column from the lungs through the glottis with the
remarkable exception of the family Pipidae, whose members share a highly specialized sound production
mechanism independent of air movement.
Results: Here, we performed behavioral observations in the poorly known African pipid genus Pseudhymenochirus
and document that the sound production in this aquatic frog is almost certainly air-driven. However,
morphological comparisons revealed an indisputable pipid nature of Pseudhymenochirus larynx. To place this
paradoxical pattern into an evolutionary framework, we reconstructed robust molecular phylogenies of pipids
based on complete mitochondrial genomes and nine nuclear protein-coding genes that coincided in placing
Pseudhymenochirus nested among other pipids.
Conclusions: We conclude that although Pseudhymenochirus probably has evolved a reversal to the ancestral nonpipid condition of air-driven sound production, the mechanism through which it occurs is an evolutionary
innovation based on the derived larynx of pipids. This strengthens the idea that evolutionary solutions to
functional problems often emerge based on previous structures, and for this reason, innovations largely depend on
possibilities and constraints predefined by the particular history of each lineage.

Background
As noticed by Darwin [1], every derived feature in an
organism must have evolved from a pre-existing feature
in its ancestors. Therefore, the current form and function of organism attributes are determined, to a great
extent, by phyletic heritage of past events [2]. This
equally applies to evolutionary key innovations, which
are not designed every time anew, but use available
materials, that are themselves a product of millions of
years of evolution. This has been firmly established by
many studies showing that (i) novel morphological

structures may often appear by deploying ancient
genetic regulatory circuits [e.g. [3]] and (ii) existing
genes or morphological structures can be recruited to
perform completely new functions [e.g. [4,5]] or to
explore new approaches to carry out the same task [6].
Evolution is an integrated and unitary process [7], and
effective reuse of previous molecular or morphological
structures through natural selection is subjected to historical constraints [8]. Deciphering how a particular
functional mechanism arises in an organism requires
framing the question within an evolutionary context
through a multidisciplinary approach [9] involving functional, morphological, and phylogenetic analyses that
allow determining which morphological structures were
involved, their evolutionary origin (i.e. homology), and
the succession of steps that led to a successful end.

Sound production is a key feature in the behavior of
different animals such as crickets, frogs, birds or bats
[10]. Calls normally serve as advertising signals to delimit territories or attract mates, and in more sophisticated cases can become a proxy of the mood of the
individual [11]. Thus, it is not surprising that such a critical function has been the subject of intensive selection
through evolutionary history, and a wide variety of
sound production mechanisms have evolved in different
animals. In frogs, diversification of sound production
mechanisms is intimately linked to and/or constrained
by the evolution of vocal structures, which is necessarily
connected to the evolution of the respiratory system.
Despite the considerable diversity of calls and larynx
morphologies among extant frogs, the majority of the
species call by moving air from the lungs through the
glottis [10]. In most frog species, the laryngeal apparatus, which is suspended between the posteromedial processes of the hyoid (= thyrohyals), is a cartilaginous
capsule composed of two arytenoid cartilages (each
bearing one vocal cord), the cricoid cartilage and associated musculature [10].
A remarkable exception to the above-described general sound production and larynx morphological patterns occurs in the family Pipidae. The extant members
of this family include the South American genus Pipa
(Surinam toads) and the four African genera Hymenochirus, Silurana, Xenopus, and Pseudhymenochirus (African clawed frogs). The family Pipidae together with its
sister group, the monotypic family Rhinophrynidae
(Mexican burrowing toads, genus Rhinophrynus), form
the superfamily Pipoidea [12]. The origin of pipids dates
back at least to the Mesozoic [e.g. [13-16]] with known
fossils from the Cretaceous [17]. Pipids represent a nice
example of highly adapted form and function that
evolved from an inherited frog bauplan, which is per se
highly specialized within amphibians (and tetrapods),
and restricted to limited variation [18]. Pipids are the
only fully aquatic group of frogs, and their derived morphology and biology are largely a product of adaptations
to this lifestyle [19]. One of these remarkable adaptations is the pipid sound production [20], with the structure and function of their larynx being radically
different from those of other frogs [20,21]. Pipids lack
vocal cords, and their larynx is a greatly enlarged and
(at least partially) ossified box made up by the cricoid
cartilage and the tyrohyals, which do not form part of
the larynx in non-pipid frogs. This box encloses the arytenoid cartilages which are modified into two bony rods
[10]. The sound production mechanism was described
in detail for Xenopus borealis [20,22], and it appears to
be based on implosion of air into a vacuum formed by
rapidly moving disk-like enlargements of the arytenoids.
The sound is then amplified by the enlarged voice box

Page 2 of 10

that serves as an internal vocal sac [20,22]. Sounds thus
are produced without moving an air column, and therefore without externally visible movements of the flanks
or throat. Similar motionless calling was also observed
in Hymenochirus boettgeri [23], Pipa pipa [21], Pipa carvalhoi [24], Xenopus laevis [25], and most other pipids
[[26,27], pers. obs.]. However, Pseudhymenochirus was
stated to produce sounds by a more conventional sound
production mechanism based on moving air [20],
although this behavior has so far not been documented
in detail.
Despite their many derived features, in several respects
pipids have been more extensively studied than any
other group of frogs because Xenopus laevis and Silurana tropicalis have been used as model organisms in
physiology, development, and cell and molecular biology
[e.g., [28]]. Knowledge on the closest relatives of model
organisms is crucial to interpret and understand the
evolutionary origin of studied characters and functions,
but remarkably the phylogenetic relationships of pipids
have not been comprehensively assessed so far. The
rather aberrant morphology of pipids was initially considered to be relatively ancestral among frogs, and many
of pipid morphological characters were initially assumed
to retain plesiomorphic states. However, now pipids are
viewed as highly derived frogs [28] with many autapomorphies primarily related to their fully aquatic lifestyle
[28]. Almost all possible alternative phylogenetic relationships among pipid genera have been recovered
based on either morphological [19,29,30] or molecular
[13,31,32] data sets, and the position of Pipoidea with
respect to all other frog lineages remains also equally
contentious [13-16,31,33]. See Additional file 1 for a
detailed discussion of previously proposed hypotheses.
Here, we analyze DNA sequences of complete mitochondrial genomes and of nine nuclear genes to produce a robust phylogeny of extant pipoids. We used
this phylogenetic framework to gain insights on the
evolution of the sound production mechanism in
pipids. In this context, we show through behavioral
observations that the calling mechanism of Pseudhymenochirus clearly involves the movement of an air column, as it occurs in non-pipid ancestors. Given the
unambiguous derived position of Pseudhymenochirus
within pipid phylogeny, a reversal to air-driven sound
production in this genus is hypothesized. In addition,
we provide strong morphological evidence from comparing diverse alizarin-stained frog larynges, which
show that larynx structure in Pseudhymenochirus has
clear pipid affinities. These observations taken
together, allow us to suggest that the use of air in the
sound production in Pseudhymenochirus is an evolutionary novelty that evolved by deploying the typical
larynx structures of pipids.

Results
New sequence data

We determined for the first time the complete nucleotide
sequence of the light (L) strand of the mitochondrial (mt)
genome of four pipoid frog species: Hymenochirus boettgeri (HM991331), Pipa carvalhoi (HM991332), Pseudhymenochirus merlini (HM991333), and Rhinophrynus
dorsalis (HM991334). The mt genome of Xenopus laevis
was the first ever determined for an amphibian [34] and
contained numerous minor sequencing errors probably
due to technical constraints at that time. We therefore
sequenced anew the full mitochondrial genome of this
model species as well (HM991335). Like most metazoans
[35], all five pipoid mt genomes encoded for two rRNAs,
22 tRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes, and conformed
to the consensus gene order for vertebrates [35,36]. All
tRNAs could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure with the known exception of trnS-(AGY).
The putative origin of replication of the L-strand (O L)
was located between the trnN and trnC genes, and had
the potential to fold into a stem-loop secondary structure. Three conserved sequence blocks (CSB-1, CSB-2,
CSB-3) were identified in the 3â end of the mitochondrial
control region in all pipoid species. Notably, our
sequence of Rhinophrynus (a specimen from Tenexpa,
Pacific coast of Mexico) differs from a previously determined sequence (GenBank accession number DQ283109;
from the Caribbean coast of Texas, US) by a high uncorrected pairwise divergence of 9.9%, suggesting the existence of an unrecognized species in this monotypic genus
and family.
Newly generated sequences of partial nuclear genes
were deposited in GenBank under accesion numbers
HM998927-HM998951, HM998953-HM998985 and
HQ260710-HQ260712. Files containing the alignments
of both the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets can be
accessed in the Dryad Digital Repository under
doi:10.5061/dryad.8962.
Phylogenetic relationships

Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods of
phylogenetic reconstruction recovered fully congruent
tree topologies for mitochondrial, nuclear, and combined datasets, respectively, with differences only in
branch lengths and levels of support (Figure 1). Five
major clades were recovered within Anura (Figure 1):
Amphicoela (Leiopelma + Ascaphus, which were used to
root the tree), Discoglossoidea, Pipoidea, Pelobatoidea
and Neobatrachia. Non-neobatrachian frogs were recovered as successively branching lineages, with Discoglossoidea branching off after Amphicoela, followed by
Pipoidea and Pelobatoidea. These relationships received
high support values in the analysis of mitochondrial
genomes and nuclear genes, and maximum support in

the combined analysis (Figure 1 and Additional file 1,
Figure S1). Alternative phylogenetic placements of the
Pipoidea were significantly rejected by the AU test
(Table 1 and Additional file 1, Table S2).
Within the Pipoidea, all data sets and phylogenetic
analyses supported Rhinophrynus as the sister taxon of
monophyletic Pipidae, Pipa as sister group to all other
extant pipid genera, and sister-group relationships
between Xenopus and Silurana, and between Hymenochirus and Pseudhymenochirus. Alternative hypotheses
could be significantly rejected except for a basal placement of the Xenopus/Silurana clade (Table 1). In singlegene analyses of nuclear data, Pipa was recovered as sister group to all other extant pipid genera by bdnf, pomc,
cxcr-4, slc8a1 and slc8a3, whereas rag1 and rag2 recovered the Xenopus/Silurana clade or the Hymenochirus/
Pseudhymenochirus clade in such position, respectively
(Additional file 1, Table S1).
Mechanism of sound production in Pseudhymenochirus
and other Pipidae

In contrast to previous non-documented observations
[20], we provide compelling behavioral data on Pseudhymenochirus merlini showing that this species, while calling, moves a column of atmospheric air from the lungs
through the glottis (Additional file 2: Movie). We conclude that this movement of air almost certainly is causal for sound production in this species. Unlike all other
extant pipid genera, all of which show a motionless calling, vocalizations in Pseudhymenochirus are clearly associated with intermittent constrictions of the posterior
flanks and extension of the throat (Figure 2). The
observed sequence of movements further suggests that
sounds are produced during expiration, i.e., movement
of the air from the lungs (Figure 2). Moreover, males
produce release calls, showing also regular contractions
of flanks and extension of throat.
We complemented behavioral observations with morphological comparative analyses of the larynx structures
of alizarin red-alcian blue stained specimens of different
pipid genera and a discoglossoid. Our results confirm
previous works [29,37,38] that larynges of pipids are
highly enlarged and ossified, in contrast to those of the
rest of frogs. The larynx of Xenopus, is a highly ossified
box made up by the thyrohyals, arytenoids, and cricoid
cartilages, which are greatly expanded posteriorly. In
Hymenochirus and Pseudhymenochirus, the larynges
show conspicuous and ossified thyrohyals that enclose
the smaller arytenoid rods (Figure 3). Both genera additionally share an elongate shape of lungs that reach the
inguinal region and are tightly attached to the body wall
(Additional file 1, Figure S4). However, there are two
conspicuous differences between these two taxa: (i)
Pseudhymenochirus has ossified alary processes of the

[29], and (ii) cartilage and calcified structures around
the larynx are more extended and form an overall more
compact laryngeal âboxâ structure in Hymenochirus,
with calcified strutures lateral to the thyrohyals and
extensive cartilage visible in the glottis area (Figure 3).
Because all our cleared-and-stained preparations were

made from adult specimens that had been sacrificed
immediately previous to the clearing and staining procedure, we can exclude that preservation artefacts have
caused these differences. Therefore, the larynx of Pseudhymenochirus seems to be more flexible, and this, somehow may allow the air to move through it.

Discussion

Evolution of sound production in Pipidae

Phylogenetic relationships of and within Pipoidea

Our behavioral observations suggest that sound production in Pseudhymenochirus is produced by air movement
from the lungs to the throat. This is unique among
pipids, which generally produce motionless clicking
sounds by implosions related to the derived box-like
structure of the larynx [22], and in fact more similar to
the typical mechanism found in non-pipid frogs. The
sound production mechanism of pipids has been thoroughly studied in Xenopus borealis [22] and given the
resemblance of calls and motionless calling behavior in
other members of the family [21,23-27], it is assumed to
be the general system in pipids. In X. borealis, the characteristic clicking sound was proved to be produced by
the simultaneous action of bipennate muscles that separate the discs of ossified arytenoid rods [22]. Yager suggested that the sound is produced by the implosion of
air when the two arytenoid discs separate, given that no
clicking sound was emitted when this space was filled
with liquid [22]. Similarly, the implosion mechanism is
not air-driven, because call spectra remained unchanged
after frogs were foreced to breathe helium [22].
With regards to morphological analyses, our results are
fully congruent with previous detailed anatomical descriptions in which the larynges of pipids are enlarged boxes
formed by more or less ossified cartilages [20,21,37,38].
Despite the apparent diversity in larynx morphology both
among pipids and among frogs, the embryological origin of
involved cartilages have been traced back to the larval hyobranchial apparatus [10], leaving little doubt of their
homology within amphibians [37,43]. The larynx of Hymenochirus is an enlarged box with ossified cartilages, more
similar to that of Xenopus and Silurana than to other nonpipid anurans (laryngeal cartilages are not ossified, e.g.
Bombina in Additional file 1, Figure S5), thus reinforcing a
similar sound production system to that of X. borealis. In
Pipa, although the larynx structure slightly differs from
that of Xenopus [20,22] a similar sound production has
also been suggested [21]. The larynx of Pseudhymenochirus
is particularly similar to that of Hymenochirus and shows
the typical ossified cartilages of other pipids [37,38]. Therefore, we could undoubtedly assert that the larynx in Pseudhymenochirus evolved from a typical pipid condition, but
the overall structure seems to be more flexible, and this
could somehow permit a movement of air that is used to
vocalize, as suggested by our behavioral observations. However, whether vocal cords are present in Pseudhymenochirus (which are absent in pipids) or whether other
strucutres are responsible for sound production requieres
specific examination. Other hypotheses may also be plausible, and further detailed functional studies [as those performed by Yager; [22]] are needed in order to determine
the exact mechanism through which sound is produced, as
well as the precise function of involved structures. Overall,

Our results provided strong support for (i) the placement of monophyletic pipoids as the third most basal
clade among extant anurans and (ii) the monophyly of
Pipidae. These results are concordant among all data
and methods of phylogenetic inference, and in agreement with previous molecular [13,14] and morphological [10,39,40] studies. Within Pipidae, our results
supported the monophyly of dactylethrines (Xenopus
and Silurana) as in other molecular studies [14,32] and
recent morphological studies [17], and significantly
rejected the previously proposed paraphyletic basal
arrangement of Xenopus and Silurana [19,29]. The
recovered basal position of Pipa, and the sister group
relationship of dactylethrines and hymenochirines
(Hymenochirus and Pseudhymenochirus) agrees with
previously published molecular studies [13,14] but contests recent morphological analyses [17,19,29,30] that
supported a Pipinae clade (including hymenochirines
and Pipa) [17,19,29] with up to six osteological characters [after excluding fossil taxa; [17]]. The alternative
hypothesis of a Pipinae clade could not be rejected by
our molecular data (Table 1 and Additional file 1, Table
S2). If our preferred hypothesis of pipid relationships is
correct, homoplasy of the above mentioned six characters needs to be assumed. Polarization of these characters is complicated by the fact that all extant pipids are
aquatic whereas their unambiguous extant sister group,
Rhinophrynus, is a terrestrial species with specialized
burrowing habits. Future morphological studies should
assess additional external characters, tadpole morphology, and soft anatomy in the search for possible synapomorphies of the four African genera, such as the
keratinization of the first three toes, which is more
strongly expressed in the African taxa [41].
Despite the apparent contradiction to morphological
data, the congruence between mitochondrial data and
the various nuclear genes (Figure 1 and Additional file
1, Table S2), and the strong support for Pipa as sister to
all other extant pipids make our conclusions considerably robust. From a biogeographic point of view our
hypothesis suggests that the basal split among extant
pipids might have separated an African lineage (Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, Silurana, and Xenopus)
from a South American lineage (Pipa) and is consistent
with the American distribution of Rhinophrynidae as
sister group of the Pipidae [41,42]. This indicates the
need of re-evaluating also the phylogeny of fossil taxa,
given the apparent biogeographic anomaly that the
South American Pipa based on morphological data are
nested within a clade of purely African fossil taxa, and
the African Silurana/Xenopus within a clade of exclusively South American fossil taxa [17].

Irisarri et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:114
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/114

our molecular and morphological data leave neither doubt
of the nested phylogenetic position of Pseudhymenochirus
within Pipidae, nor of the clear pipid nature of its larynx.
While the source used for sound production unexpectedly
appear to reverse to the ancestral non-pipid condition
(movement of the air column), associated anatomy evolved
from a typical pipid-like larynx that likely imposed constraints to natural selection. Altogether, we suggest that the
air-driven sound production in Pseudhymenochirus most
probably represents a novel evolutionary combination and
it is a remarkable example of complex anatomical modifications related to a functional shift of enormous influence
in frog behavior and life history.
The selective forces for these changes are unknown,
but the movements of the body flanks during the call in
Pseudhymenochirus obviously produce water waves that
might provide information about the size of the calling
male to females, detected by their lateral line system.
Water surface waves can play an important role in the
advertisement behavior of several basal anurans [44,45].
Compared to Hymenochirus, sexually active Pseudhymenochirus males have morphologically less distinct postaxillary glands (Figure 2a), which are used in chemical
communication during the breading season in Hymenochirus [46]. Therefore, flank movements in Pseudhymenochirus could serve as additional visual and mechanical
signals, which might reinforce the acoustic signals to
attract females and impress conspecific males.

Conclusions
Our study exemplifies that understanding the evolutionary process underlying an innovation, here the air-driven
call in Pseudhymenochirus, can only be achieved through
an integrative comparative approach. In this particular
case, behavioral observations prompted for detailed anatomical analyses, and comparative data were placed
within a robust phylogenetic framework based on molecular data. Further insights on the nature of this evolutionary innovation could be gained through ontogenetic
studies that disentangle how morphological constraints
imposed by the rather stiff larynx box of pipids are overcome to allow the reversal to the ancestral air-driven
vocalization in Pseudhymenochirus. The result of this
study provides yet another example of how natural
selection generates complex morphologies and functions
by tinkering with previously available structures [47],
and further reinforces the important roles of historical
contingency and constraints in canalizing potential solutions to a given evolutionary problem [48].

(newly determined) mt genomes of additional pipoid
taxa, and replaced the available sequence of Xenopus
laevis [34] by a newly determined one from a specimen
with reliable locality data. DNA was extracted using a
standard phenol-chloroform protocol from voucher specimen tissue. Several overlapping fragments covering the
entire mt genome were amplified by PCR using previously reported primers and cycling conditions [49].
Specific primers were also designed to amplify fragments
in some species in which general primers did not work
(available from authors upon request). Those fragments
that contained the control region were cloned into
pGEM-T vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) due to
observed heteroplasmy. PCR fragments and recombinant
clones were cycle-sequenced with the ABI Prism BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (V3.0)
using PCR and M13 universal primers, respectively, as
well as walking primers if needed. Cycle sequencing products were run on ABI Prism 3700 and 3130 Ã l DNA
Analyzers (Applied Biosystems). The obtained mt
sequences were annotated based on sequence similarity
to reported frog mt genomes. The vertebrate mt genetic
code was used to translate ORFs of protein-coding
genes. The different tRNAs were identified based on
their putative clover-leaf secondary structure, as implemented in the program DOGMA [50]. Sequences were
aligned by taking secondary structure of tRNAs and
amino acid translations of protein-coding genes into
account. Highly variable portions of the sequences, as
well as third positions of mt protein-coding genes were
excluded from phylogenetic analyses (see Additional file
1 for extended methods).
A nuclear DNA dataset was generated using partial
sequences of nine protein-coding genes (see Additional
file 1, Table S3): rag1, rag2, bdnf, pomc, exon 2 of cxcr4,
exon 2 of slc8a1, slc8a3, exon 1 of rho and H3a. We
assembled a complete combined matrix complementing
previously available sequences from GenBank with
newly determined sequences, representing all major
lineages of frogs for which mt genome data exist. In a
few cases, chimerical sequences were constructed by
merging sequences from different species of the same
genera, for which strong evidence exist of being monophyletic. Primers used were as reported in the literature:
rag1 [49]; rag2 [51,52]; slc8a1 [13]; bdnf and pomc [53];
rho [51]; and H3a [54]. In all cases, PCR cycling conditions were experimentally adjusted from those reported
in the original publications.

Single-gene alignments were used to produce three different datasets, containing: (a) all mt genes (final length
of 11,131 bp); (b) all nuclear genes (final length of 7,107
bp); and (c) a combination of mt and nuclear genes

(final length of 18,238 bp). Additionally, we also constructed an alternative mt dataset using amino acid
characters for protein-coding genes, as well as analyzed
single-gene datasets for the nuclear genes to understand
the congruence among these markers.
We used Leiopelma and Ascaphus as outgroup taxa
because molecular and morphological data are congruent in indicating that these are the most basal extant
frogs [14,55]. All datasets were subjected to maximum
likelihood [ML; [56]] and Bayesian inference [BI; [57]]
analyses using RAxML version 7.0.4 [58] and MrBayes
version 3.1.2 [59,60], respectively. RAxML used the
rapid hill-climbing algorithm [61] computing 100 distinct ML trees starting from 100 distinct randomized
maximum-parsimony starting trees. BI was performed
running four simultaneous Markov chains for 10 million
generations, sampling every 1000 generations. An additional BI run was performed for each of the analyses, to
confirm the adequate mixing of the Markov chains.
Convergence was checked a posteriori by plots of lnL
scores and low standard deviation of split frequencies,
as well as using the convergence diagnostics implemented in the online tool AWTY [62]. The first 2.5 million
generations were discarded as burn-in to prevent sampling before the Markov chains reached stationarity.
Partitioned analyses were performed for ML and BI,
with 16 partitions for the mitochondrial and 9 for the
nuclear datasets. For each partition, the best fit-model
of nucleotide substitution was chosen using the Akaike
information criterion [AIC; [63]] as implemented in
Modeltest version 3.7 [64], MrModeltest version 2.3 (by
J. A. A. Nylander; http://www.abc.se/~nylander/), and
ProtTest [65]. Support for internal branches was evaluated performing 1000 replicates of non-parametric bootstrapping [66] (ML) and by posterior probabilities (BI).
Alternative tree topologies (see results) were evaluated
based on the combined mt and nuclear dataset using
the non-parametric approximately unbiased (AU) test
[67] as implemented in Consel version 0.1 k [68] with
site-wise log-likelihoods calculated by RAxML with
independent GTR + Î + I models assigned to each of
the different partitions, and one million multiscale bootstrap replicates. We used BayesMultistate [69] from the
BayesTraits package (by M. Pagel and A. Meade; http://
www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk/BayesTraits.html) to infer the
ancestral state of the mechanism for sound production
in the family Pipidae using ML.
Cleared alizarin-stained preparations

In order to further understand the morphological basis
of sound production in pipids, we performed a comparative anatomical study of the larynx structures of
several pipids including Xenopus laevis, Hymenochirus
boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini, as well as

Bombina bombina as representative of non-pipid ancestors. Following standard international procedures, specimens were sacrificed using an overdosis of MS222, fixed
in formalin, and differentially stained for bone and cartilage with alizarin red S and alcian blue, respectively, following a standard procedure [70].
Behavioral observations

Observations were made of captive specimens in ca. 100 Ã
30 Ã 20 cm aquaria. Specimens of different pipid species
were obtained from the pet trade and kept at different
times between 1985-2011. All observations refer to specimens in breeding conditions, without external (hormone)
stimulus. No experiments with living animals were performed. Video sequences of calling specimens of Pseudhymenochirus were recorded in 2010 with a Sony DCR-SR30
camera. Spectral and temporal variables of the recorded
sounds were analyzed using Cooledit 96 software (Syntrillium). Sonagrams were constructed using the package seewave [71] in the R environment [72].
