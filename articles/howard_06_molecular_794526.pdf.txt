Abstract
Background: The amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-A's) are naturally occurring,
exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses that are indigenous to the Southern California wild mice.
These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types including human cells in vitro and they can cause
both hematological and neurological disorders in feral as well as in the inbred laboratory mice.
Since MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope
proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and
as vehicles for transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts including human cells. However, the
genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established and the
evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous
MuLV strains remains elusive. Herein we present a complete genetic structure of a novel
amphotropic virus designated MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that this retrovirus together with
other MuLV-A's belongs to a distinct molecular, biological and phylogenetic class among the MuLV
strains isolated from a large number of the laboratory inbred or feral mice.
Results: The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to the previously isolated MuLV-A's except that
this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian as well as in chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins
of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 exhibits differences
in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein
is totally unrelated to those present in a broad range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated
from various inbred and feral mice globally. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by
dot plot analyses, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding
nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the env gene,
is more closely related to the biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E)
isolated from another region of the Southern California, than to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose
full-length sequences are present in the GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic
analyses and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also
placed all MULV-A's in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated

from numerous mouse strains globally. Likewise, construction of separate dendrograms for each
of the Gag, Pol and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 demonstrated that the amphotropic retroviruses
belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV
strains.
Conclusion: The molecular, biological and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses
including MuLV-1313 are distinct compared to a large family of exogenously- or endogenouslytransmitted ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV strains of the laboratory and feral mice.
Further, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically discrete ecotropic retrovirus
of the Southern California wild mice are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary
tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus indicating a common origin of these viruses. This
is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct
amphotropic virus.

Background
A large number of genetically transmitted endogenous
murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) and non-genetically
acquired exogenous retroviruses have been classified on
the basis of their in vitro host range, interference and neutralization properties. Regardless of their origin, the gammaretroviruses isolated from a wide variety of inbred or
feral mouse strains have been designated as ecotropic
(MuLV-E), xenotropic, (MuLV-X), amphotropic (MuLVA), polytropic, mink cell focus forming (MCF) and 'modified polytropic' viruses [1-12]. The MuLV-E's are the most
common endogenous or exogenously acquired retroviruses of mice and they grow well in mouse or rat cells but
not in cells derived from higher primates, humans or
other mammals [2]. All MuLV-E strains induce syncytia in
a Rous Sarcoma virus transformed, non-producer XC rat
cells [13,14]. The xenotropic viruses (MuLV-X) are the
genetically transmitted endogenous retroviruses of mice
that do not replicate well in mouse cells which produce
these viruses, but they grow preferentially in cells of heterologous species, including human and other primate cells
[6,7,15]. The polytropic and 'modified polytropic' viruses
are endogenous nonecotropic MuLVs that grow in mouse,
human and other mammalian cell types [11,12,16]. Most
of the polytropic viruses are expressed during leukemogenesis in various inoculated mice and they are called
mink cell focus forming (MCF) as they induce syncytia in
the replication defective Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus
transformed non-producer, mink cells [17] In contrast,
the amphotropic retroviruses do not induce foci in transformed mink cells (i.e. not related to MCF viruses) and
they display distinct interference, host range and neutralization patterns from all other endogenous or exogenously
acquired, ecotropic, nonecotropic, xenotropic, polytropic
or MCF MuLV strains [1,2,4,5,12,18,19].
The proviral DNA sequences of MuLV-A strains are not
detected in the DNA from the wild or inbred laboratory
mice, indicating that these viruses are not endogenous to
the mouse genomes [10,20]. The MuLV-A-related

sequences are also not detected in the genomes of numerous avian and mammalian species that normally inhabit
various farms from which the MuLV-A harboring wild
mice are trapped [20]. Despite numerous studies conducted on wild mice from different regions of the world
[12,16,21-23], the amphotropic viruses have been recovered exclusively from the feral mice of Southern California
as naturally transmitted infectious agents [1,2,5,10,24].
An interesting phenomenon related to the amphotropic
retroviruses (1504A, 4070A and others) is that most of
these viruses coexist in nature as mixtures with the biologically distinct ecotropic, XC+ syncytia-inducing retroviruses such as Cas-Br-E (a clone of 1504E), 4070E and
others [1,2,10,25]. Further, both types of retroviruses are
capable of causing similar diseases in naturally infected
feral mice and both can be isolated from the healthy fetal
or adult tissues, spontaneous lymphoma/leukemia or
from the brain tissues of paralyzed wild mice
[2,10,24,26,27]. The amphotropic and ecotropic MuLV
components can be separated from the original stocks of
virus mixtures by endpoint dilution purification techniques and sequential biological cloning of each virus in
human and mouse cells respectively [2,18,28].
The biologically cloned amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses are quite stable when inoculated in uninfected wild
mice from areas with low prevalence of exogenously transmitted viruses and both are capable of causing lymphoma
as well as paralysis in these animals with no change in
their respective host ranges [10]. However, inoculation of
inbred mice separately with MuLV-A or MuLV-E strains
isolated from wild mice, results in genetic recombination
with the endogenous ecotropic, polytropic or xenotropic
sequences present in the genomes of the laboratory mice
[30,31,29,4]. For example, we have isolated a highly
oncogenic amphotropic retrovirus designated 10A-1 by
inoculation of a weakly oncogenic amphotropic virus
(1504A) isolated from a wild mouse embryo [28]. This
virus produces 100% lymphoma in the NIH Swiss mice

Virology Journal 2006, 3:101

only in 4–8 weeks and it displays distinct neutralization
and interference properties [28]. In addition, at least 50%
of NIH Swiss mice inoculated separately with the same
1504-A clone as used for isolating the amphotropic 10A1 virus, produced ecotropic XC+ MuLV-E [4]. In vivo passages of these recovered viruses yielded viruses of ecotropic host range although dual-tropic virus activity was
occasionally seen in the spleens but not in the brains or
spinal cords of the lymphomatous or paralyzed mice
[4,10]. Thus, we have identified three classes of recombinant viruses (10A-1-like viruses with amphotropic host
range and two genetically distinct recombinants with ecotropic, XC+ host range) that were generated by the recombination of the env gene of the exogenously infecting
parental virus 1504-A with different endogenous viral or
cellular sequences of NIH Swiss mice [4,29,30]. The classic MCF virus was not recovered from any of the laboratory mice inoculated with the wild mouse MuLV-E or
MuLV-A [4,10,28].
Our earlier studies had indicated that RNA genomes of all
amphotropic viruses including the 10A-I are closely
related to each other even though they have recombined
with endogenous mouse sequences after inoculation in
NIH Swiss mice and they do not induce foci in mink cell
(i.e. they are unrelated to MCF viruses in both their in vitro
and in vivo properties) [4,29]. Moreover, RNA genomes of
the recovered and cloned MuLV-E isolates from the inbred
mice were more divergent from each other than those passaged in the uninfected wild mice [30].
Since the isolation and distribution of the wild mouse retroviruses by our group in early 1970's, the env genes and
receptors of amphotropic viruses have been studied by
many investigators and numerous vectors have been constructed for the delivery of foreign genes in different cell
types including human and other primate cells [30][3138]. Recent evidence supporting the unusual host range of
these viruses has indicated that microdomains in the large
cholesterol- rich rafts present in cell membranes are used
for early binding events and entry of these viruses in
mouse cells [39]. However, a complete genetic structure of
any amphotropic MuLV strain is not available and the
evolutionary relationships of these retroviruses to a broad
range of both endogenous and exogenous MuLV strains
have yet to be defined. Herein we present the first complete genetic analysis of a novel amphotropic retrovirus
MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that both the amphotropic
and the biologically distinct ecotropic MuLV strains isolated from the Southern California feral mice belong to
exclusive groups of genetically and phylogenetically
related retroviruses and both are distinct from the numerous ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV's of the
inbred and feral mice from other geographical locations.

Results and Discussion
Biological Diversity of MuLV-1313
Although the host range of all amphotropic retroviruses is
similar, the MuLV-1313 can replicate well in both mammalian and chicken cells (as opposed to the transient
transfection of a plasmid-clone) [1,2,4]. This retrovirus is
also capable of rescuing the src oncogene from the B10Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) transformed, non-producer rat
cells and the pseudotype virus can transform chicken cells
as well as human, bovine, rabbit, dog, raccoon, cat, mink,
rat and mouse cells in vitro (Figure 1). The infected cells
exhibit classical round-cell morphology of RSV-induced
transformation and produce excess helper virus as
detected by the presence of high levels of reverse transcriptase activity in the culture supernatant. The MulV1313 (src) pseudotype is also able to transform duck
embryo cells in vitro but the amphotropic virus alone does
not replicate as efficiently in duck cells as it does in the
chicken cells (S.R., unpublished data).

The choice to characterize MuLV-1313 genomic structure
was based on the tenet that this was the only retrovirus
that existed in nature as a "pure population" of amphotropic virions since all previously studied MuLV-A's
(MuLV1504-A, 4070 and others) were recovered as mixtures with ecotropic retroviruses regardless of their associations with normal embryo tissues, lymphoma, or
paralysis [2]. After culturing wild mouse-derived viruses in
vitro, the amphotropic and ecotropic components had to
be separated from the mixtures by biological cloning in
different cell types [1,2,4,5]. In contrast, repeat cycles of
endpoint dilution cloning of MuLV-1313 strain isolated
from lymphoma or other tissues in many different mammalian cell types including human, bovine, dog, rabbit,
cat, mink, murine as well as in chicken cells yielded only
a single population of amphotropic virions and no ecotropic, xenotropic, polytrophic or MCF-like viral components could be detected in any of these cultures [2].
Genomic Structure of MuLV-1313 Provirus
The proviral DNA of MuLV-1313 was cloned from the
chromosomal DNA of human RD- 1313 cells that were
chronically infected with this virus and two fragments that
overlapped by 1,934 bps were completely sequenced. The
full-length MuLV-1313 genome comprised 8,217 base
pairs (bp); a 5,551 bp fragment containing the 5' end of
the virus spanned from the U3 region of the 5' LTR to the
pol gene and a 4,906 bps fragment comprised the 3' end of
the genome and extended from the pol gene to the U5
region of the 3' LTR. The genomic organization of MuLV1313 was similar to other replication competent mammalian gammaretroviruses (5'LTR-gag-pro-pol-env-3'-LTR)
and the proviral DNA spanned from the beginning of the
R region of the 5'LTR to the end in the R sequences in the

The entire MuLV-1313 genomic sequence was used as a
query to align with complete sequences of mammalian
gammaretroviruses that were present in various databases.
Most significant similarity scores were found to be with
the sequences of the MuLV family of retroviruses. The
highest score bits (SB) were obtained with the wild mouse
ecotropic MuLV Cas-Br-E (SB: 1049) and this was followed by Moloney (SB: 1031), AKV (SB: 920), Rauscher

Regulatory Elements of the MuLV-1313 genome
Alignment of the nucleotide sequences from LTRs of several well-characterized MuLV strains indicated that the
total length of the MuLV 1313 LTR was 518 bp with the
U3, R and U5 regions comprising 374, 68 and 76 bps
respectively. Sequence motifs that were well conserved in
the U3 region of the MuLV-1313 LTR included the CAAT
box, CGCTT motifs and the TATAA box which comprised
the proximal MuLV promoter region. The extreme 5'-end
of the U3 region of the MuLV-1313 LTR contained a 13 bp

Virology Journal 2006, 3:101

motif (5'-AATGAAAGACCCC-3') that formed one half of
the highly conserved inverted repeat element that is also
present in the LTR sequences of other mammalian type-C
retroviruses [40][41,42]. This sequence motif has been
shown to play a key role in the integration of retroviral
DNA into the host cellular genome [42]. The U3 region of
MuLV 1313 LTR contained 18 bps (5'-AAACAGGATATCTGTGGT-3') that spanned the sequence containing the core
region as well as the binding sites for Lvb/Lvt transcription
factors. This highly conserved element is also believed to
play a key role in the activity of the enhancers of these
viruses [40]. Analysis of the U3 region of MuLV-1313
LTR's indicated that it has several additional control
regions. These included the upstream sequences designated as the negative control region and a single copy of
the 75 bp MuLV enhancer sequence which contained regulatory elements such as the glucocorticoid response element (GRE), core element, GC-rich region and binding
sites for different transcription factors (Lvb/Lvt and NF-1).
The R region of the MuLV-1313 LTR contained two important elements. The first was a 28-nucleotide motif (5'GCGCCAGTCCTCCGATAGACTGAGTCGC-3') located at
the extreme 5' end of the R region, which is highly conserved among the mammalian gammaretroviruses. This
motif is predicted to form a stable stem-loop structure that
would be present at the 5' ends of all RNA transcripts generated from the LTR [41]. This element has also been
shown to be necessary for maximal activity of the MuLVSL3 LTR by influencing the initiation rate of viral transcripts from the MuLV promoter [41]. Immediately downstream from this element was a consensus polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA). The second
important element of the MuLV-1313 LTR was a 13 bp
inverted repeat (5'-GGGGTCTTTCATT-3') located at the
extreme 3' end of the U5 region. Most retroviruses use this
element for the integration of proviral DNA's in the host
chromosomal DNA. Immediately downstream of the U5
region
(5'-TGGGGGCTCGTCCGGGAT-3')
was
a
sequence complementary to the 3' end of tRNAPro that was
identified as a minus strand primer binding site for the
first strand DNA synthesis.
Structural Analysis of the MuLV-1313 Gag/Pro/Pol
Polyprotein
The Gag/Pro/Pol precursor protein (Pr180) of MuLV1313 consisted of 1736 amino acid (aa) residues that were
encoded by 5211 bp (from nt 620 to 5830). The polyprotein could be subdivided into the matrix (MA or p15),
pp12, capsid (CA or p30) and nucleocapsid (NC or p10).
The pol gene of MuLV-1313 encoded protease (Pro) and
Pol (reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins), which
were located in the same continuous open reading frame
as the gag gene. A stretch of nucleotides located immediately downstream of the stop codon for the Gag shared

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/101

sequence similarity with a motif found in an analogous
position in the Moloney MuLV genome. This region is
believed to form a stem-loop structure in the RNA form of
the genome and it plays a major role in the suppression of
the gag termination codon during translation in order to
produce the Pr180 Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein [43]. In
MuLV-1313 a precursor Gag/Pro/Pol fusion protein may
be expressed via suppression of the gag amber termination
codon present between nucleotides 2227 and 2230 by a
glutamine-charged tRNA [44].
Although the MuLV-1313 Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein displays similarities of the deduced amino acid residues
located at the potential protease cleavage sites to those
found in Moloney MuLV [45], several differences were
noted: (i) an alanine instead of a threonine residue was
located immediately after the NC/PR cleavage site, (ii) an
asparagine instead of a glutamine residue was present 3
residues after the PR/RT cleavage site, (iii) a threonine in
place of a serine residue could be identified 5 residues
after the RT/IN cleavage site, (iv) the fourth amino acid
residue after the p12/CA protease cleavage site in MuLV1313 Gag protein could be predicted to be a serine residue
instead of an alanine as observed in Moloney MuLV.
The deduced NC (p10) protein of MuLV 1313 contains
one canonical retroviral 'CCHC' or Cys-His motif (C-X2C-X4-H-X4-C) that is considered to be essential for the
encapsidation of the viral RNA genome during the virus
assembly. The 'HHCC' domain (H-X(3–7)-H-X(23–32)-C-X2C) that has been shown to be important for retroviral integration in the host chromosomal DNA could be located at
the amino terminus of the MuLV-1313 integrase protein
in the form of H-X3-H-X32-C-X2-C. A second motif, designated 'DDE' (D-X(39–58)-D-X35-E), was also present in the
MuLV-1313 integrase protein in the form of D-X39-D-X35E. This motif has been localized in the catalytic core
domain of these proteins and it is universally conserved
among integrases of retroviruses as well as retrotransposons.
The p15 matrix (MA) domain of MuLV-1313 exhibited a
glycine residue located in the second amino acid position
(G2), which is important for viral capsid assembly of
many viruses particularly when the Gag proteins are targeted to the cell membrane through myristylation of this
residue [46]. We have also located sequences encoding
two consecutive amino acid residues Gln and Arg at positions 109 and 110 of the MuLV-1313 CA (p30) protein
that are present primarily in N-tropic MuLV strains (i.e.,
viruses that replicate efficiently in cells derived from NIH
Swiss mice). In contrast, the B-tropic MuLV strains (i.e.,
those that grow preferentially in cells derived from the
BALB/c mice) contain Thr-Glu residues in the corresponding positions [3,47,48].Thus the genetic structure of the

Page 5 of 18

Virology Journal 2006, 3:101

MuLV-1313 genome is discrete compared to the 27 MuLV
genomes that have either been partially or completely
sequenced.
Genetic Structure of the MuLV-1313 ENV Protein
The env gene of MuLV-1313 was located in the -1 frame
with respect to the Gag and Pol proteins of this virus and
it comprised 1965 bp. Several structural domains were
identified in the MuLV-1313 Env precursor protein of 654
aa residues (designated Pr80) ; (i) an approximately 30 aa
amino terminal signal peptide; (ii) a 200 aa receptor binding domain containing two hypervariable regions, designated VRA and VRB [49,50]; (iii) a proline-rich region
ranging between 45 to 59 aa in length and composed of a
highly conserved N-terminal sequence and a hypervariable C-terminal sequence; (iv) about 160 aa carboxy terminal portion of the surface (SU) protein; (v) a
transmembrane (TM) ectodomain harboring a sequence
at its amino terminus and a heptad repeat domain that
may be involved in the fusion of the viral envelope to the
cell membrane; (vi) a membrane spanning domain and
(vii) a C-terminal p2E or R-peptide cytoplasmic tail.

The host range, neutralization and interference patterns of
various MuLV subgroups have been associated with differences in the viral envelope glycoproteins and their interactions with specific cellular receptor(s) used for viral entry
[4,30-32][33-37,51-56][57]. Since the sequence of the
entire genome of an amphotropic virus was not available
for comparison with the sequences of the MuLV-1313
genome, this evaluation was restricted to the amphotropic
env gene only. A search of the GenBank database by the
use of the BLAST-P algorithm indicated that the deduced
amino acid sequence of MuLV-1313 env ORF shared the
highest degree of sequence similarity (96.8%) to the
amphotropic 4070A (Score bits (SB): 1177) and the
recombinant amphotropic virus 10A-1 (94.3%) with two
gaps inserted (SB: 1118). However, compared to 4070A
Env protein, 12 aa residues were different between the two
proteins (Figure-2). Eleven of the twelve aa differences
were found in the SU (gp70) protein and one aa difference was found in the TM protein (p15E). Four of these
differences were observed in the signal peptide region
(Q11K, P19S, I21M and G28R), five in the hypervariable
C-terminal sequence of the proline rich region (PRO)
(I259V, I261A, V262I, T280A and V292A) and two aa differences could be located between the signal peptide
(K69R) and between the proline-rich region and its C-terminus (A403T). No aa residue differences were found in
either VRA or VRB regions of their receptor binding
domains or in the (eight) potential N-glycosylation sites
(N-X-S/T) or positions (all located in the SU protein) of
4070A and MuLV-1313 Env proteins. The only aa residue
difference between the TM proteins of 4070A and 1313
was located between the heptad repeat and the membrane

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/101

spanning domains (T581S) (Figure 2). These domains
have been reported to be involved in inducing conformational changes and recognition of cellular receptors for
both naturally occurring 4070A and the recombinant
amphotropic virus 10A-1 (Figure -2) [53-55][56-60].
An interaction between MuLV particles and specific cell
surface receptors appear to depend primarily on two variable regions, designated VRA and VRB, that are located in
the amino-terminal domain of the MuLV SU proteins
[49,50]. However, a comparison of MuLV-1313 SU protein with those of other amphotropic MuLVs indicates
that the growth of this virus in both avian and mammalian cells can not be attributed to these receptor-binding
domains since no amino acid differences are noted in VRA
and VRB regions of MuLV-1313 and those of 4070A
which does not grow in chicken cells. Recently, substantial evidence has been presented for the caveola-dependent endocytosis and binding of MuLV-A to mouse cells by
the use of microdomains of their lipid rafts [38,39]. To
study this phenomenon we have constructed vectors that
express high levels of MuLV-1313 Env proteins in vitro
(Howard and Rasheed unpublished data) since it is possible that other determinants besides VRA and VRB regions
of the MuLV-1313 SU proteins may be involved in the
binding of MuLV-1313 viral envelope to cellular membranes and replication in different cell types including
avian cells.
The MuLV 1313 Env protein was also different from the
highly oncogenic recombinant amphotropic MuLV 10A1. Comparison of the complete Env sequences of the two
viruses indicated that forty-six residues were different
between the two proteins and all aa differences with the
exception of one were located in their gp70 (SU) domains
(Figure-2). These differences were not randomly distributed but were predominantly localized in two areas of this
protein, namely the signal peptide region (7 aa residue
differences) and the proline-rich region, especially in the
variable subdomains. In addition, 2 residues in the VRA
region and 1 aa difference in VRB domain were found to
be different between MuLV-1313 and 10A-1 Env proteins
(Figure 2).
Compared to the polytropic or MCF-type and xenotropic
interference groups of viruses, the MuLV-1313 env gene
showed significant number of gaps (six to seven) and
overall similarities of 73.5% to 75.0%. Of all the MuLVs
isolated from various mouse strains globally, the 1313 env
gene shared the least similarity with the ecotropic MuLVs
isolated from the inbred or feral mice including those
from the Southern California (Cas-Br-E-MuLV) (54% to
65.9% with 10 to 14 gaps).

Relationship of MuLV 1313 gPr80 Env protein with those of other amphotropic MuLV's
Relationship of MuLV 1313 gPr80 Env protein with those of other amphotropic MuLV's. All deduced amino acid
sequences of the MuLV 1313 gPr80 Env proteins and related amphotropic MuLV strains 4070A, and 10A-I were aligned using
progressive, pair-wise alignments implemented in the Pileup and the Gap programs of the Wisconsin Package (version 9.0),
Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI [63-67, 80]. The amino acid sequences of MuLV 1313 Env protein are shown
in its entirety (represented in bold, capital letters using the standard single-letter symbols). Amino acid positions that are in
total agreement with MuLV 1313 Env are indicated with a dash (-) and differences are represented as small letters. Periods (·)
in the 10A-I Env protein sequence indicate spaces that were introduced to maximize the alignment. Boundaries of the Env signal peptide (Leader) and the mature processed proteins are labeled and indicated with bold vertical lines. Major landmarks of
the extracellular gp70 surface (SU) protein include the (i) variable region A (VRA), (ii) VRB and (iii) proline-rich region. Major
landmarks of the p15E transmembrane™ protein include the (i) fusion, (ii) heptad repeat, (iii) membrane spanning and (iv) the
R-peptide or p2E domains. Eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites (N, X, S/T) in the SU proteins of the MuLV 1313 and
4070A are underlined. Disulfide linkages shown at the N-terminus of SU are based on those deduced for the polytropic envelope protein [81]. The boundaries of the various elements included in this diagram are based on previously published work [51,
82, 83]. Accession numbers for each of the env genes used in this analysis are MuLV 1313 (AF411814), M33469 for the naturally occurring amphotropic virus 4070 and M33470 for the recombinant amphotropic virus 10A-1.

Comparison of Full-length MuLV Genomes
Prior to this study a complete genomic structure or the RT
or the Gag sequences of any amphotropic virus was not
known and only env gene had been studied. We have
therefore analyzed the whole genomic sequence of MuLV1313 and in addition evaluated each of its genes separately in comparison with those present in all known
MuLV strains whose complete or partial sequences are
available in the global databases. Currently 15 full-length
MuLV sequences including those of the MuLV-1313

genome are available in the GenBank. All 15 viral
genomes were analyzed by two separate methods: 1) DOT
Matrix analyses in which each of the 8,217 bps of MuLV1313 were compared with the corresponding nucleotide
of another MuLV strains and 2) phylogenetic analysis by
construction of dendrogram using full-length sequences
of all 15 MuLV's.
The Dot Matrix analyses were performed to clearly establish relationship of the entire MuLV-1313 genome to the

known MuLV strains that have been completely
sequenced. This comprehensive analysis indicated that
the MuLV-1313 genome shared the highest nucleotide
sequence similarities throughout the Gag and Pol proteins
(not the ENV) of the biologically distinct ecotropic retrovirus Cas-Br-E (a clonal derivative of MuLV 1504E) isolated from a paralytic wild mouse from Southern
California locale (Figure-3 panel A). Although there is no
sequence correspondence between the env genes of MuLV1313 and Cas-Br-E, the similarity of the gag and pol genes
was totally unexpected.
Since the host-range, interference and neutralization
properties of all exogenous and endogenous ecotropic
viruses present in the inbred or the wild mice are similar
and totally distinct from MuLV-1313 or other amphotropic viruses, the genetic make up of the wild mouse ecotropic MuLV Cas-Br-E would be expected to be similar to
other known ecotropic viruses such as Moloney, AKR and
other MuLV strains [2,11,12,18,61,62]. However, as can
be seen from Figure 3 Panels B & C (See additional file 2),
all these ecotropic and nonecotropic MuLV strains show
frequent breaks and shifts in the diagonal dot plots indicating only a distant relationship of their gag and pol
genescompared to those of amphotropic and ecotropic
(Cas-Br-E) retroviruses from California wild mice.
Alignment of coding sequences from 15 available fulllength MuLV genomes and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed the findings of the dot matrix
plots and showed that both Cas-Br-E and MuLV-1313
arose from a single node and then separated on two
branches of the tree due to differences in their ENV (see
next section and Figure-4). The other 13 MuLV strains
were positioned on either sides of these two branches and
clearly segregated the naturally occurring retroviruses of
the Southern California wild mice from those isolated
from the inbred or other feral mice globally.
Phylogenetic Analyses of MuLV-1313 GAG and POL
Proteins
In general, evolutionary analysis of retroviruses is conducted by the use of amino acid sequences of the highly
conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of their pol
genes. To more specifically define the evolutionary relationship of MuLV-1313 to other MuLV strains, we analyzed each encoded protein of all three MuLV-1313 genes
(gag, pol and env) separately. The MuLV-1313 protein
sequence was aligned with the corresponding sequences
derived from a large family of both exogenous and endogenous retroviruses that have been isolated from different
mouse strains and hierarchical clustering dendrograms
were constructed separately for each gene [63][64-67].
Analyses of different regions of the Gag protein (i.e. P15/
MA or P30/CA) or the entire sequence of the MuLV-1313

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/101

gag gene segregated MuLV-1313 together with Cas-Br-E
into distinct branches of a common phylogenetic node
indicating that these two wild mouse retroviruses are
genetically related (Figure 5).
To construct the pol tree for MuLV-1313 we have selected
a region of this gene that encompasses the highly conserved domains 1–7 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) protein encoded by a 534 bp sequence [67]. In previous
studies this region had been used for phylogenetic analyses of all retroviruses [67]. The 5' half of the RT was the
only region of the MuLV-1313 genome that shared significant sequence similarity (>90%) to this gene from the 12
MuLV strains. This analysis also indicated that the MuLV1313 pol gene was more closely related to the Cas-Br-E
strain of MuLV the ecotropic virus from the wild mice of
Southern California than to other MuLV strain as both of
these viruses segregated from a single node (Figure 6).
Additionally, the separation of MuLV-1313 and Cas-Br-E
from the other MuLV strains appears to have taken place
early in the evolution of these retroviruses (Figure-6).
Genetic Relationship of MuLV 1313 ENV to those of other
mammalian Gammaretroviruses
Although our studies and those of others had previously
shown the distinctive nature of the amphotropic env gene
[2,31,32,68][69], the present analysis compares all available ENV protein sequences of the amphotropic, ecotropic,
"dual-tropic", polytropic, MCF, "modified polytropic",
xenotropic and 10A-1 recombinant amphotropic viruses
(Figure-7). Phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of
amino acid sequences of the MuLV-1313 ENV protein
with 26 other MuLV strains representing each of the major
in vitro host range, neutralization and interference groups
of MuLV strains indicated that the MuLV 1313 Env protein is most closely related to that of the amphotropic
MuLV 4070A and these two viruses together with the
related 10A-I recombinant amphotropic strain formed a
unique node on the MuLV Env evolutionary tree suggesting the uniqueness of their env genes among all other
members of the MuLV family (Figure-7). Further, the Env
analyses clearly positioned the amphotropic retroviruses
between the two distinct groups, the nonecotropic, polytropic and MCF-type of viruses on one side and all ecotropic viruses except Cas-Br-E (the only ecotropic virus
sequenced from the Southern California wild mouse on
the other (Figure-7).

The origin of amphotropic MuLV's is not known and
sequences related to these viruses are not present in the
germ-line of inbred or feral mice indicating that MuLV-A's
are not genetically transmitted retroviruses and they
spread as infectious agents among the Southern California
wild mice [10,20,69]. Analysis of cellular DNA's of many
mammalian and avian species also failed to identify

Dot Martrix analyses of the whole MuLV-1313 genome. Dot plots of the MuLV-1313 genome (GenBank accession
number AF411814) were constructed utilizing the COMPARE which produced files of 15621 points of full-length MuLV
genomes. Dot matrix was constructed using DOTPLOT programs of the Wisconsin Package, Version 9.0, Genetics Computer
Group (GCG), Madison WI and Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) tool with windows setting at 21 and stringency at
44. This analysis compares each nucleotide position with the corresponding position of another genome (Dot). Solid diagonal
line represents similarity and broken lines indicate gaps. Although Dot-Matrix analyses were performed on several MuLV
strains, viruses that showed high similarity scores are shown in panels A, B and C (see Additional File 2). Dot Matrix
analyses of full-length genomic sequences shown include ; Panel A, Cas-Br-E [25] (X57540); Panel B, AKV (J01998), and
Panel C, Moloney (J02255). The highest nucleotide similarity is observed with the CAS-Br-E ecotropic virus isolated from a
Southern California Wild mouse with paralysis (Panel A). This is followed by Moloney [8] and AKV MuLV strains [85] (Panels B & C respectively). Note, the env sequences of MuLV-1313 are totally unrelated to all three viruses shown by large gap
in this area of the diagonal line. In addition, note the numerous broken lines in gag and pol regions of the Moloney and AKV
MuLV genomes.

Phylogenetic analyses of full Length MuLV genomes
Phylogenetic analyses of full Length MuLV genomes.
Full-length nucleotide sequences as well as deduced amino
acid sequences of 15 MuLV strains including MuLV-1313
were aligned and all gaps were stripped from the alignments
before the phylogenetic trees were constructed and bootstrapping was set at 1000. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PHYLIP [66, 71]. PHYLIP packages SEQBOOT,
PROTDIST, DNADIST, NEIGHBOR, CONSENSE, and
DRAWGRAM. The original data set was first analyzed by
SEQBOOT which produced 100 bootstrapped data sets. The
distance matrices on these data sets were achieved using
PROTDIST for amino acid sequences and DNADIST for
nucleotide sequences. The distance matrices were joined
using NEIGHBOR. The tree files from NEIGHBOR were
then applied with CONSENSE and the consensus tree was
drawn using DRAWGRAM. Multiple sequence alignment
were made using Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) with default gap opening penalty of 15 and default gap
extension penalty of 6.66. Full length genomes used in the
construction of the dendrogram included; AKV MuLV

genetic, taxonomic and other characteristics to define
overall association between mammalian retroviruses
[66,70,71]. This analysis clearly placed the amphotropic
retroviruses in a unique position among numerous mammalian retroviruses including those from the rat, cat and
primates (Figure-8). These results indicate that amphotropic viruses segregated from the rest of MuLV strains a
long time ago in the evolutionary scale and remained as
infectious agents among the wild mouse population of
the Southern California.
The MuLV-1313 is Not a Recombinant Retrovirus
Although the phylogenetic analyses of each of the three
retroviral genes separately has revealed that regardless of
the genetic sequences used (gag, pol or Env) for the construction of each dendrogram, both the amphotropic and
ecotropic viruses from the feral mice of Southern California segregate from a unique node into their respective
clades or branches of the evolutionary tree (Figures 5, 6,

7&8). However, most of the retroviral genomes are genetically diverse due to a high error rate of the polymerase
activity during reverse transcription and/or exchange of
genetic material co-packaged within the same virion leading to the recombination between two slightly variable
viral genomes [72][73-75]. To test if MuLV-1313 genome
is chimeric due to any genetic recombination between different but related viral genomes, we have used a program
called SimPlot that was originally designed to detect evidence of intersubtype recombination among various
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genomes [73].
This program has been extremely useful in classifying chimeric genomes of various HIV-1 and HIV-2 subtypes and
clades isolated globally [72][73-75].
Since recombination in various regions of a viral genome
can be recognized only by the genetic analyses of fulllength sequences we have used the SimPlot program to

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/101

identify potential breakpoints for any recombination in
the entire MuLV-1313 genome in comparison with other
full-length MuLV sequences that are available in the database. This analysis did not reveal any breakpoints in the
MuLV-1313 genome compared to complete sequences of
14 other MuLV strains indicating that the MuLV-1313
genome is not a recombinant of different genetic
sequences derived from other MuLV genomes (Figure-9
and see additional file 1). Without a doubt, this analysis
demonstrated that the RT and gag genes of both MuLV1313 and the biologically distinct ecotropic virus (Cas-BrE) from the Southern California wild mice exhibit similarities with a break in the envelope gene of Cas-Br-E (Figure9). These analyses also suggest that amphotropic genomes
are stable within the wild mouse population as was
observed by our earlier in vivo experiments [4,30]. However, experimental inoculation of amphotropic retroviruses
in the laboratory mice clearly results in genetic recombination with other MuLV sequences present in the chromosomal DNA of the inbred mice [4,28-30].

Conclusion
The study presented herein represents the first comprehensive genomic analysis of an exogenously acquired,
naturally occurring amphotropic retrovirus MuLV-1313
and it demonstrates that the molecular, biological and
phylogenetic properties of this virus are distinct from a
broad range of ecotropic, xenotropic or polytropic MuLV
strains isolated from the inbred laboratory or other feral
mice.
Analyses and comparison of each nucleotide of the fulllength MuLV-1313 genome with those of the corresponding nucleotide of other MuLV strains indicate that this retrovirus is most closely related in the gag and pol genes (not
the env gene) of another naturally occurring but a biologically distinct ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E), isolated
from the wild mouse of another Southern California
locale. Phylogenetic analyses of each gene separately and
collectively as the whole genome, provide additional evidence that the "highly conserved" gag and pol genes of the
two distinct retroviruses (amphotropic and ecotropic) of
the Southern California wild mice are genetically related
to each other compared to all known MuLV strains.
Analyses of full length genomes by the use of various bioinformatics programs such as SimPlot, has been useful in
distinguishing genetic recombination in any part of the
HIV genome. These programs have been useful in identifying genetic events that may occur between the genomes
of replication competent retroviruses, host cellular
sequences or other sequences derived from endogenous
or exogenously infecting viruses. These recombinant
viruses can be highly pathogenic, less pathogenic or could
be associated with distinct oncogenic, neurologic and

Methods
Although the amphotropic MuLV-1313 and ecotropic
Cas-Br-E MuLV are positioned at different branches of the
evolutionary tree, both viruses have a unique origin (i.e.
the same ancestor) as they initiate from the same node.
Since both the amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses
have been maintained as infectious agents among the
indigenous population of the Southern California feral
mice, they have evolved into different host range groups

Cloning of proviral DNA
The proviral DNA of MuLV-1313 was amplified from the
chromosomal DNA of RD1313 cells by utilizing the
Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Prior
to amplification of the MuLV-1313 genome, highly conserved regions of the MuLV genomes were identified by
alignment of several complete MuLV genome sequences
(AKV – accession number J01998, Moloney – J02255,
Friend – M93134 and Cas-Br-E – X57540) and two sets of
PCR primers were identified for the amplification of two
overlapping proviral DNA fragments of the MuLV-1313
genome from the RD1313 cellular DNA. Briefly, 500 ng of
high molecular weight cellular DNA was used as a template in an amplification reaction consisting of 2.5 U Taq/
Pwo DNA polymerase mixture, 350 uM of each dNTP and
300 nM of each primer, all in a final 50 ul volume. The
cycling parameters consisted of a single incubation at
94°C for 2 min. followed by 10 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec.,
60°C for 30 sec. and 68°C for 4 min.; 20 cycles of 94°C
for 10 sec., 60°C for 30 sec., and 68°C for 4 min. with
increases of 20 sec. per cycle; and a final 68°C extension
for 10 min. The 5' end of the MuLV 1313 genome was
amplified utilizing U3-F (5'-TGGGCCAAACAGGATATCTGTGG-3', corresponds to coordinates #7945–7967 of the
Moloney MuLV genome) as the upstream primer and PolR (5'-GCGTTAATTTAGTTAAAGTCTCCTTG-3', coordinates #5313–5288) as the downstream primer. The 3' end
of the MuLV 1313 genome was amplified using Pol-F (5'TTGCCAGAAACAGGTCAAGTATCTGG-3', #3380–3405)
as the upstream primer and U5-R (5'-TGACGGGTAGTCAATTACTCCGAG-3', #129–106) and the cycling conditions were the same as those used to amplify the 5' half
except that the initial annealing temperature was 57°C
instead of 60°C. All amplicons were cloned into pBluescript IISK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the Hinc II site
after the repair of DNA ends by T4 DNA polymerase and
agarose gel purification of the fragments.
DNA Sequence Analysis
To facilitate sequencing of the cloned MuLV-1313 DNA
fragments, nested sets of unidirectional, deletion mutants
were generated for both the 5'– and 3'– amplicons using
an Erase-A-Base kit (Promega Corp.) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA's from randomly selected clones were subjected to restriction
enzyme analysis and a set of subclones was chosen that
differed from each other by 400–500 bp spanning the
entire lengths of the respective MuLV-1313 inserts. A
SequiTherm Long-Read cycle sequencing kit-LC (EpiCenter Technologies Corp., Madison, WI) was used
according to the manufacturer's instructions to perform
all sequencing reactions and the resulting products were
subjected to gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide
gels (Long-Ranger). The kit utilized a combined thermal

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/101

cycle labeling and sequencing procedure employing the
dideoxy chain terminator method. All sequencing reactions used fluorescent dye, 1.5 pmol of T3 or T7 labeled
primers and 300–350 fmol of cloned, double-stranded
plasmid DNA. Cycle sequencing parameters consisted of a
single incubation of 95°C for 3 min. followed by 30 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec., 57°C for 15 sec. and 70°C for 30 sec.
All sequencing data was obtained using an automated, LICOR DNA sequencer, model 4200 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE)
with Base Image IR (version 4.0) image analysis software.
Raw sequencing data were assembled into the final contig
using the AlignIR (version 1.0) software package (LICOR).
The nucleotide sequence of the complete MuLV 1313
genome has been deposited with the GenBank database
under the accession number (AF411814).
Multiple sequence alignment and Phylogenetic analyses
Computer-assisted searches for DNA sequence similarities
to the MuLV-1313 genome were performed using the
BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) version 2.0
[77][78] that is maintained on the National Center for
Bioinformatics Institute (NCBI). Sequences were aligned
using the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch [63] as
implemented in the Gap program of the Wisconsin Package (version 9.0), Genetics Computer Group (GCG),
Madison, WI [79]. The Gap program creates a global
alignment between the two sequences that maximizes the
number of matched residues and minimizes the number
and size of gaps.

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PHYLIP
packages [66,79]. PHYLIP version 3.6. 2005, was distributed by Dr. J. Felsenstein, Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle. Other programs
used included SEQBOOT, PROTDIST, DNADIST, NEIGHBOR, CONSENSE, and DRAWGRAM. First we applied
bootstrapping technique to the original data set using
SEQBOOT, which produced 100 bootstrapped data sets.
The distance matrices on these data sets were achieved
using PROTDIST for amino acid sequences and DNADIST
for nucleotide sequences. The distance matrices were
joined using NEIGHBOR. The tree files from NEIGHBOR
were then applied with CONSENSE and the consensus
was drawn using DRAWGRAM.
Comparative Analysis of Full-length MuLV genomes
At present 15 full length MuLV genome sequences are
available and an alignment of genomic sequences was
generated by the Clustal W program [64,80]. Rooted phylogenetic trees were constructed from prealigned nucleic
acid and amino acid sequences using different programs
including CLUSTALTREE [65]. Evolutionary trees were
generated in two steps; first, a distance matrix was estab-

lished by calculating distances (percent divergence)
between all pairs of sequences in the multiple alignments
and second the Neighbor Joining method was applied to
the distance matrix 149;50. All gaps were stripped from
the alignments before the phylogenetic trees were constructed and bootstrapping was set at 1000. Viruses and
their complete genomes used in this analysis are: MuLV
1313 (AF411814), MCF 1233 (U13766), AKV (J01998),
Cas-Br-E (X57540), Friend 57 (X02794), Friend (FB29)
(Z11128), Friend (FrC6-A8F5) (D88386), Friend (PVC211) (M93134), Moloney (J02255), Rauscher (U94692),
SRS 19-6 (AF019230), HEMV (AY818896), RadLV
(K03363), MDEV (AF053745) and SL3-3 (AF169256).

Dot Martrix analyses of the whole MuLV-1313 genome. Dot plots of
the MuLV-1313 genome (GenBank accession number AF411814) were
constructed utilizing the COMPARE which produced files of 15621 points
of full-length MuLV genomes. Dot matrix was constructed using DOTPLOT programs of the Wisconsin Package, Version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison WI and Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California) tool with windows setting at 21 and stringency at 44. This
analysis compares each nucleotide position with the corresponding position
of another genome (Dot). Solid diagonal line represents similarity and
broken lines indicate gaps. Although Dot-Matrix analyses were performed
on several MuLV strains, viruses that showed high similarity scores are
shown in panels A, B and C. Dot Matrix analyses of full-length genomic
sequences shown include ; Panel A, Cas-Br-E [25] (X57540); Panel B,
AKV (J01998), and Panel C, Moloney (J02255). The highest nucleotide
similarity is observed with the CAS-Br-E ecotropic virus isolated from a
Southern California Wild mouse with paralysis (Panel A). This is followed by Moloney [8] and AKV MuLV strains [85] (Panels B & C
respectively). Note, the env sequences of MuLV-1313 are totally unrelated to all three viruses shown by large gap in this area of the diagonal
line. In addition, note the numerous broken lines in gag and pol regions
of the Moloney and AKV MuLV genomes.

For dot matrix analyses, multiple sequence alignment
were made using Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) with default gap opening penalty of 15 and default
gap extension penalty of 6.66. COMPARE produced point
files ranging in size from 3528 points (env genes only) to
15621 points of full-length MuLV genomes. Dot matrix
was constructed using Vector NTI tool with windows setting at 21 and stringency at 44.
The SimPlot program [72], was used to plot similarity
versus position and it calculates percent identity of a query
sequence to a panel of reference sequences after their
alignment in a sliding window, which is moved across the
alignment in steps. This is an interactive 32-bit software in
which the windows and step sizes are adjustable. SimPlot
was available as shareware from the author, Stuart C. Ray,
M.D., 1999, SimPlot for Windows (version 2.5), John
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,
that has been used to identify inter-subtype recombinants
of HIV genomes [72].
