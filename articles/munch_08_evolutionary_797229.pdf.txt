Abstract
Background: Segmental duplications (SDs) are euchromatic portions of genomic DNA (≥ 1 kb)
that occur at more than one site within the genome, and typically share a high level of sequence
identity (>90%). Approximately 5% of the human genome is composed of such duplicated
sequences. Here we report the detailed investigation of CHEK2 duplications. CHEK2 is a multiorgan
cancer susceptibility gene encoding a cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the DNA-damage
response signalling pathway. The continuous presence of the CHEK2 gene in all eukaryotes and its
important role in maintaining genome stability prompted us to investigate the duplicative evolution
and phylogeny of CHEK2 and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution.
Results: To study CHEK2 duplicon evolution in anthropoids we applied a combination of
comparative FISH and in silico analyses. Our comparative FISH results with a CHEK2 fosmid probe
revealed the single-copy status of CHEK2 in New World monkeys, Old World monkeys and
gibbons. Whereas a single CHEK2 duplication was detected in orangutan, a multi-site signal pattern
indicated a burst of duplication in African great apes and human. Phylogenetic analysis of paralogous
and ancestral CHEK2 sequences in human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque confirmed this burst of
duplication, which occurred after the radiation of orangutan and African great apes. In addition, we
used inter-species quantitative PCR to determine CHEK2 copy numbers. An amplification of CHEK2
was detected in African great apes and the highest CHEK2 copy number of all analysed species was
observed in the human genome. Furthermore, we detected variation in CHEK2 copy numbers
within the analysed set of human samples.
Conclusion: Our detailed analysis revealed the highly dynamic nature of CHEK2 duplication during
anthropoid evolution. We determined a burst of CHEK2 duplication after the radiation of
orangutan and African great apes and identified the highest CHEK2 copy number in human. In
conclusion, our analysis of CHEK2 duplicon evolution revealed that SDs contribute to inter-species
variation. Furthermore, our qPCR analysis led us to presume CHEK2 copy number variation in
human, and molecular diagnostics of the cancer susceptibility gene CHEK2 inside the duplicated
region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of duplicons.

Background
Segmental duplications (SDs) are euchromatic portions
of genomic DNA (≥ 1 kb) that occur at more than one site
within the genome and typically share a high level of
sequence identity (>90%) [1]. Both in situ hybridization
and in silico analyses have shown that ~5% of the human
genome is composed of duplicated sequences [2-4].
Duplications that can be traced to an ancestral or donor
location are named duplicons. Based on a neutral model
of genome evolution [5], duplicons with approximately
10% sequence divergence correspond to duplication
events that have occurred 30–40 million years ago (MYA),
i.e. before the radiation of Old World monkey and hominoid species [6]. Furthermore, a conspicuous bias of interchromosomal SDs toward pericentromeric regions, or
euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions in general, was detected [7,8]. Fine-scale analyses of pericentromeric regions disclosed a two-step model for the
formation of such dynamic regions. An initial pericentromeric "seeding" event followed by subsequent exchange
("swapping") of duplicon blocks between pericentromeric regions has been proposed [9,10]. Both homologous and non-homologous processes were shown to be
involved in "seeding" and "swapping" of pericentromeric
SDs in human and great ape genomes [9-13] (for review
see [14]). The duplicative architecture of human and
higher primate genomes has been shown to be a major
force promoting rapid evolutionary turnover [15].
Although the predisposition to expansion of interspersed
segmental duplication is common to human and great
apes, it appears that many species-specific duplication
events have taken place at different regions of their
genomes. Interestingly, two independent approaches
determined the fraction of species-specific SDs in chimpanzee and human to be ~30%, while ~66% of SDs seem
to be shared between both species [16,17]. Thus, speciesspecific SDs are thought to have contributed to a larger
extent to the genetic difference between chimpanzee and
human than single-base mutations [17]. Moreover, SDs
seem to be sites of recurrent large-scale structural variations [18-20] and it has been estimated that ~20% of SDs
are polymorphic within the human and chimpanzee
genome [17].
Interestingly, among all human chromosomes the Y chromosome has the highest relative SD content [2,6,16,2123]. Recently, we have analyzed 866 kb of Y-chromosomal non-palindromic SDs delineating the four euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions in Yp11.2/
Yp11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12 and Yq12/
YPAR2 [24,25].
Here we report the detailed investigation of the CHEK2
duplicons, one of which is embedded within the analyzed
Yq11.1/Yq11.21 SD cluster. The ancestral duplicated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/269

region, containing the proximal part of the functional
CHEK2 gene (CHK2 checkpoint homolog S.pombe) and
the distal part of TTC28 (tetratricopeptide repeat domain
28), is located in 22q12.1 [10,25-27]. CHEK2 has been
shown to be a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene [28].
Interestingly, CHK2, the protein encoded by CHEK2, is a
cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the DNA-damage
response signalling pathway [27]. Cell cycle checkpoints
monitor the structural integrity of chromosomes before
their progression through crucial cell cycle stages. CHK2
homologues were found in yeast and higher eukaryotes
[29-33] indicating an important role throughout eukaryotic evolution in controlling the integrity of the genome.
The continuous presence of the CHEK2 gene in all eukaryotes [34] and its important role in maintaining genome
stability [27] prompted us to investigate the duplicative
evolution and phylogeny of CHEK2 and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution. We applied a combination of
comparative FISH and in silico analyses. In addition, we
used inter-species quantitative PCR for further validation
and for detection of intra-species specific CHEK2 copy
number variations.

Methods
Y-chromosomal cosmid library screening
We screened the LLOYNC03 "M" (Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory) Y-chromosomal library (5.5xY chromosome coverage) for CHEK2 duplicon containing cosmids using a Y-chromosomal probe generated by the
following PCR-conditions: 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min and
finally 72°C for 5 min. The following primers were used
to generate a 575 bp probe: IP-cos-SD1-for 5'-ACCCCCTTAGTAGCGTCCTTAGCTC-3' and IP-cos-SD1-rev 5'ACCACCGGAGTTTCACAAAGAAAGT-3'. The gel-purified
probe was radioactively labelled according to the 'random
priming' protocol [35]. Prehybridization and hybridization of the high density gridded filters were carried out for
18 hrs at 42°C according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Final filter-washing was carried out in 1%SDS/2xSSC
solution for 1 hr at 65°C. Primers located proximal and
distal of the derivative Y-chromosomal CHEK2 duplicon
were used for PCR (conditions see above) to identify cosmids containing the entire duplicon:

PB-cos-SD1-for 5'-AGCGCAAATTGCAGAATTACAAAGA3', PB-cos-SD1-rev 5'-GGTTAGAGAGGATAAGCCGCATGTT-3', DB-cos-SD1-for 5'-GATCCCGCACATTTGTTCAT
TAGAG-3', DB-cos-SD1-rev 5'-CAAAAGCTTGAATTCTGTGCCTCAGT-3'
Detection of derived CAGGG repeat sequences in the Ychromosomal cosmid LLOYNC03 "M" 22E01
We used RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/
and Tandem Repeats Finder [36] to search for CAGGG

repeat sequences within the Y-chromosomal CHEK2
duplicon containing cosmid LLOYNC03"M" 22E01. Both
analyses failed to identify CAGGG repeat sequences in the
derivative CHEK2 duplicon and in both adjacent derivative duplicons, which are the IGL@- (Immunoglobulin
lambda@ locus-) and the NHEDC1- (Na+/H+ exchanger
domain containing 1-) duplicons. Nevertheless, RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats Finder analysis revealed the
presence of extensive CAGGG repeat sequences within the
ancestral IGL@ locus in 22q11.21 (NT_011520:
1994740–2060046). Subsequent pairwise alignment of
both ancestral and the derivative Y-chromosomal IGL@
loci disclosed a more diverged CAGGG repeat like
sequence. By using the DnaSP Ver.4.10.9 software 72%
nucleotide sequence identity was detected between the
CAGGG repeats present within the ancestral IGL@-duplicon (NT_011520: 2033670–2035327) and the derivative
CAGGG repeats in Yq11.1/Yq11.21 (NT_113819:
398233–403886).
Blood samples and cell lines
The following blood samples from non-related individuals were used for qPCR analysis: blood samples from the
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, PTR) Max (LN: 444) and
Fritz (LN: 776, wild-born) were obtained from the Zoologisch-Botanischer Garten Wilhelma Stuttgart (Germany).
The blood sample from chimpanzee Marcel (LN: 39) was
obtained from TNO Primate Centre Rijswijk (Netherlands). Lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, GGO) blood
samples of Jangu (LN: 315), Gaidi (LN: 916, wild-born)
and Fritz (LN: 673, wild-born) were obtained from the
Zoo Wuppertal, the Zoo Leipzig and the Tiergarten Nürnberg, respectively. Two blood samples of the Bornean
orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus, PPY) Thai (LN:
866) and Napoleon (LN: 1005) were obtained from the
Zoo Duisburg (Germany) and the Zoo Studen (Switzerland), respectively. Blood samples from two rhesus
macaque individuals (Macaca mulatta, MMU; LN: 1053
and 1054) and one hamadryas baboon individual (Papio
hamadryas, PHA; LN: 496) were obtained from the Deutsches Primaten Zentrum Göttingen (Germany).

Skin tissue of a pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina,
MNE) was provided by the Deutsches Primaten Zentrum
Göttingen (Germany) and was used to establish a fibroblast cell line. For each species one of the above listed
blood samples and the fibroblast cell line were used for
FISH analysis. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of the whitecheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys, NLE) and
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJA) were
kindly provided by S. Müller (Munich) and were used for
FISH analysis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
FISH analysis of metaphase spreads derived from lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines from
non-related human (Homo sapiens, HSA) and non-human
primate males was performed. Prior to FISH, the slides
were treated with RNase followed by pepsin digestion as
described [37]. FISH was carried out following the protocol described previously [38]. Chromosome in situ suppression was applied to clones from the human fosmid
library WI-2 (WI2-1621D20, WI2-819H21) and from the
Y chromosome specific cosmid library LLOYNCO3"M"
(LLOYNCO3"M"22E01). Human whole-chromosome
painting (WCP) libraries [39] were used to unequivocally
assign hybridizing signals to orthologous regions in lesser
apes, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.
pMR100, a mouse-derived rDNA-containing plasmid, was
used to tag the Old World monkey marker chromosome.
After FISH the slides were counterstained with DAPI (4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole; 0.14 μg/ml) and mounted in
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Preparations were evaluated using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope
equipped with single-bandpass filters for excitation of red,
green, and blue (Chroma Technologies, Brattleboro, VT).
During exposures, only excitation filters were changed
allowing for pixel-shift-free image recording. Images of
high magnification and resolution were obtained using a
black-and-white CCD camera (Photometrics Kodak KAF
1400; Kodak, Tucson, AZ) connected to the Axiophot.
Camera control and digital image acquisition involved
the use of an Apple Macintosh Quadra 950 computer.
Phylogenetic analysis
FASTA formatted sequence files used to generate phylogenetic trees were extracted from the corresponding GenBank accession numbers. Sequence alignments were built
by using CLUSTALW (version 1.82) [40], and neighborjoining phylograms created by using MEGA (Molecular
Evolutionary
Genetic
Analysis)
v4.0
http://
www.megasoftware.net[41]. Neighbor-joining analysis
was used with complete deletion parameters and bootstrap (1,000 iterations) to provide confidence of each
branching point in the phylogenetic trees. Neighbor-joining methods were chosen as they are amenable to calculating divergence times between sequence taxa. We
estimated the number of substitutions per site per year by
correcting the divergence times for multiple substitutions
using Kimura's two-parameter model [42]. As the rates of
nucleotide substitution vary for pseudogenic sequences,
the rate of nucleotide substitution was calibrated based on
orthologous sequence comparisons using a divergence of
25 Mya for macaque-human divergence [43]. Duplication
timing events were calculated by applying the equation r
= k/2 T [44], where r is the rate of nucleotide changes per
bp per yr, k is the distance calculated between the ances-

tral and paralogous sequences, and T is the time of divergence of the molecules.
Quantitative PCR
Interspecies quantitative PCR was carried out using primers specific for CHEK2 exon 14. Primers were designed
with the assistance of the Promega Plexor Primer Design
Software. The following primer sequences were used:
CHEK2-exon14-F 5'-GGACCTTGTCAAGAAGTTGTTGGT3', CHEK2-exon14-R 5'-GGTGTCTTAAGGCTTCTTCTGTCGTA-3', CFTR-F 5'-CGCGATTTATCTAGGCATAGGC3' and CFTR-R 5'-TGTGATGAAGGCCAAAAATGG-3'

We used the ABI Prism 7900 HT system (Applied Biosystems) for real time detection. Reactions contained 0.25
μM of each primer and 5 μl of QuantiTec SYBR® Green
PCR Master Mix (Quiagen) in a total of 10 μl. Assays
included DNA standards at a final concentration of 5.0,
2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 ng/μl, a no-template control,
or 1 ng/μl of the species DNA in two replicates. Cycling
conditions were 50°C for two minutes, 95°C for 15 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 30 sec.
To avoid the generation of non-specific products, a melting curve analysis of products was routinely undertaken
following the amplification. A standard curve was constructed by plotting the cycle number (Ct), at which the
amount of target in standard dilutions reaches a fixed
threshold, against the log of the amount of starting target.
For standard curve construction genomic DNA from the
rhesus macaque MMU#13577 was used as a CHEK2 single
copy reference. The CHEK2 single copy status in the rhesus macaque genome was verified by both FISH and in silico analysis. Absolute quantification of copy number in
the different species was subsequently done by interpolation of the threshold cycle number (Ct) against the corresponding standard curve. Copy numbers of the test genes
in primate samples were normalised to the copy number
of the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which serves as a control representative of
a single gene per haploid genome [45]. CFTR primers perfectly match the CFTR gene in all targeted species
genomes. The ratio of the CHEK2 copy number to CFTR
copy number in each sample normalised the results with
respect to differing starting quantity and quality of the
template DNA in each reaction [46]. Standard errors of
the normalised CHEK2 copy numbers were calculated
from the standard deviations of the values of the CFTR
and CHEK2 genes using the formula provided by the user
menu (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, User
Bulletin no.2 1997, p.34). Comparisons between the
mean values were performed using the Student unpaired
t-test. A P-value <0.001 was considered significant.

Results and discussion
Identification and comparative FISH of a CHEK2 duplicon
containing Y-chromosomal cosmid probe
To investigate the evolution of the CHEK2 duplicon we
screened
a
Y-chromosomal
cosmid
library
(LLOYNC03"M") with a Y-derived CHEK2 duplicon
probe (for detail see Methods). A total of 13 positive
clones were detected. Probes bordering the Y-chromosomal CHEK2 duplicon were subsequently used to identify cosmids containing the entire derivative duplicon.
Out of four positive clones cosmid LLOYNC03"M"22E01
(Figure 1A) was chosen for comparative FISH on human,
great ape, Old World monkey (OWM) and New World
monkey (NWM) metaphase chromosomes (Figure 1B,
Table 1). In the human genome cosmid 22E01 hybridized
to euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions
Yq11.1/Yq11.21 and Yq11.23/Yq12, and to additional 12
transition regions on 9 different autosomes. The only
interstitial hybridization signal detected was assigned to
the ancestral CHEK2 locus in 22q12.1. With only a few
exceptions signals were detected in orthologous positions
on chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes (Figure 1B,
Table 1). Signals on human and chimpanzee chromosomes 1 and 10 were missing on the orthologous gorilla
chromosomes and species-specific signals were restricted
to human chromosome 13, and to gorilla chromosomes
2B and 18. In contrast to the multi-site signal patterns
found in all African great ape species, in the genomes of
orangutan, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset signals were detected at chromosomal sites orthologous to human 22q12.1. Additional signals with cosmid
22E01 were only detected in the proximal long arm
(10qprox) on the NOR (nucleolus organizer region) –
containing "marker-chromosome" 10 [47] of all three
investigated OWM species (rhesus macaque, pig-tailed
macaque and baboon). Sequences covered by cosmid
22E01 were subjected to repeat finding programs (for
detail see Methods). These analyses suggested that the
additional signal on the repeat-rich OWM "marker-chromosome" may be due to diverged CAGGG repeats within
the Y-chromosomal cosmid probe. Such CAGGG repeats
were previously identified as a single repeat block on the
proximal long arm of the "marker-chromosome" of the
crab-eating macaque [12] and were shown to have been
distributed toward many pericentromeric regions during
great ape evolution [12,48]. In addition, preliminary analysis of other Y-chromosomal SDs indicate that there may
be further diverged CAGGG repeat sequences located on
the Y chromosome that remained undetected by repeat
finding programs. These undetected CAGGG repeat
sequences may be located in the Yq11.23/Yq12 transition
region and in the proximal part of the Yq11.1/Yq11.21
transition region. FISH with large insert genomic clones
from both regions showed signals on the proximal long
arm of the OWM chromosome 10 [25].

Comparative FISH with CHEK2 fosmid probes from
22q12.1 in anthropoids
For unambiguous detection of CHEK2 duplicons in
anthropoids we performed further FISH experiments with
fosmid WI2-1621D20 (G248P81803F6; Figure 2A),
which derives from human chromosome 22q12.1. This
fosmid contains the complete duplicated portion of the
ancestral CHEK2/TTC28 locus. No CAGGG repeat
sequences are contained within this CHEK2 duplicon
probe. Apart from the signal tagging the ancestral CHEK2
locus in 22q12.1 the probe showed the expected multisite signal pattern in human (Figure 2B, Table 2). Signals
were detected on 8 different chromosomes. On chromosomes 1, 2, 10, 13 and Y signals seemed to be restricted to
one chromosomal location, whereas chromosomes 15, 16
and 22 showed a signal cluster, indicating the presence of
at least two CHEK2 duplicons on each of these three chromosomes. In contrast to the Y-chromosomal cosmid
probe no signals were detected with the fosmid on human
chromosomes 9, 14 and Yq11.23/Yq12 (Table 1, Table 2;
Figure 1B, Figure 2B). This observation might be
explained by the absence of CAGGG repeat sequences in
the fosmid probe. The fosmid WI2-1621D20 hybridized
to 6 different autosomal chimpanzee chromosomes and
the observed signal distribution was highly similar to the
human pattern. Nevertheless, no signal was detected on
chimpanzee chromosome 13 and only a single signal on

chimpanzee chromosome 15. Substantial differences to
the Y-chromosomal cosmid probe were detected in the
gorilla genome. Only three gorilla chromosomes were
tagged. Gorilla chromosome 16 showed two signals
located in the proximal and distal transition regions of the
heterochromatin block on the short arm (Additional File
1), indicating gorilla-specific reorganization or acquisition of CHEK2 duplicons on this chromosome. Gorilla
chromosome 22 showed two distinct signal localizations.
One signal mapped to the ancestral interstitial CHEK2
locus and one to the pericentromeric region of the long
arm. As in the chimpanzee genome, this probe generated
no signal on gorilla chromosome 13, favouring a humanspecific CHEK2 duplication event towards the short arm
of human chromosome 13. The orangutan genome
revealed differences in the signal pattern between both
probes, too. In contrast to the Y-chromosomal cosmid
probe, two signals were detected on orangutan chromosomes 16 and 22. This observation indicates the occurrence of a first CHEK2 duplication event before the
radiation of the great apes and, in addition, shows that
sequences located on chromosome 16 are more related to
the ancestral than to the derivative locus on the human Y
chromosome. Furthermore, hybridization of fosmid WI21621D20 on metaphase chromosomes of the whitecheeked crested gibbon, the rhesus macaque, the pigtailed macaque and the common marmoset revealed a

FISH results of the fosmid clone WI2-1621D20 located in 22q12.1 are listed for HSA (H. sapiens), PTR (P. troglodytes), GGO (G. gorilla), PPY
(P.pygmaeus pygmaeus), NLE (N. leucogenys) MMU (M. mulatta), MNE (M. nemestrina) and CJA (C.jacchus). The chromosomal designations for the
great apes are given according to [65], for NLE according to [67], for MMU and MNE according to [47] and for CJA according to [66]. The human
orthologous regions for the latter five species are indicated in parentheses. For PTR, GGO and PPY chromosome 16 banding nomenclature see

single CHEK2 copy status. In all these species, only the
chromosomal region orthologous to human chromosome 22q12 was labelled. This observation contrasts the
signal location of the Y-chromosomal cosmid probe in
the analysed OWM species, but can again be explained by
the absence of CAGGG repeat sequences in the ancestral
CHEK2 fosmid probe.
To verify the single-copy status of the non-duplicated portion of the CHEK2 locus, we performed FISH with the fosmid probe WI2-819H21 (G248P81285D11; Figure 2A).
In all analysed primate species, including human, this
probe hybridized to a single genomic localisation corresponding to the human 22q12.1 orthologous regions. In
conclusion, our comparative FISH results with fosmid
probe WI2-1621D20 (Figure 2B, Table 2) show the singlecopy status of CHEK2 in all tested New World and Old
World monkeys and in the white-cheeked crested gibbon.
While a first CHEK2 duplication event was detected in the
orangutan, a burst of duplication, giving rise to the complex signal pattern, occurred before the radiation of African great apes. Except for chromosomes 16 and Y all
signals present in non-human primates were also detected
in the orthologous human regions.
Comparative in silico analysis of CHEK2 duplicons in
anthropoids
We used the sequence from the human ancestral CHEK2
locus for megaBLAST analysis (Basic Local Alignment
Search
Tool;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
Blast.cgi) of the human genome. This analysis revealed
the presence of 10 derivative CHEK2 duplicons in the current human reference genome assembly, while two additional duplicons were identified in the Celera whole
genome assembly (Figure 3A). The largest CHEK2 dupli-

con is located in 16p11.2 (16p11.2a) and spans 20747
basepairs of the ancestral CHEK2 locus. This duplicon
includes exons 12 to 16 of CHEK2 and exon 1 of TTC28.
Furthermore, three additional smaller duplicons
(16p11.2b-d) were detected on chromosome 16. Duplicons 16p11.2c and 16p11.2d are about 10 kb in size and
share 99% sequence identity, indicating a recent duplication event. In addition, both duplicons terminate within
an AluSq-element, which has been shown to be enriched
within SD junctions [11]. Slightly shorter than duplicon
16p11.2a is the CHEK2 duplicon located in 15q11.2. A
second CHEK2 duplicon on chromosome 15 was only
detected in the Celera whole genome assembly and is
assigned to chromosome band 15p13. Both chromosome
15 duplicons share 99% sequence identity. As our
detailed FISH analysis also indicated the presence of at
least two different CHEK2 duplicon copies on human
chromosome 15, we conclude that these two duplicons
are the result of a recent intrachromosomal duplication
event or might reflect individual genomic variation. Furthermore, the 15q11.2 duplicon exhibits an internal 4.2
kb deletion not present in the 15p13 duplicon. Both deletion breakpoints reside in AluSq-elements, one of them
being identical to the one terminating the duplicons
16p11.2c and 16p11.2d. This deletion was shown to be
present in two different BAC libraries, RPCI-11 and RPCI13, thus almost certainly ruling out individual variation.
In summary, duplicons located at chromosomes 15 and
16 revealed a high intrachromosomal sequence identity.
This observation is concordant with previous investigations showing that intrachromosomal duplications share
higher sequence identity than interchromosomal duplications, thus pointing to a recent intrachromosomal expansion of the human genome [16,49]. It should be
mentioned that the high degree of sequence identity

Comparative in silico analysis of CHEK2 duplicons in human and chimpanzee
Comparative in silico analysis of CHEK2 duplicons in human and chimpanzee. Genomic structure of the CHEK2
duplicon family in the (A) human (NCBI Build36.2) and (B) chimpanzee (NCBI Build2) sequence assembly. The respective
ancestral CHEK2 locus is depicted by the top horizontal red bar. Within each bar the corresponding accession numbers of the
contigs and the position of the CHEK2 exons (green rectangles) and TTC28 exon (blue rectangle) are given. The precise
genomic extension of the ancestral loci within each contig is shown beneath. The next two layers illustrate the common repeat
and simple repeat content of the ancestral loci as black and grey boxes, respectively. All derivative duplicons are shown below
using the indicated colour key. Precise positions of each derivative duplicon within the corresponding contig and the genomic
extension of the sequence homology shared with the ancestral locus are indicated below and above each bar, respectively.
Striped boxes represent LINE1 elements. LINE1 element integration-sites within the respective contigs are given below and
the position of homology break within the ancestral locus is given above. Overall sequence identities between the paralogous
human and chimpanzee CHEK2 duplicons and the respective ancestral CHEK2 sequences are given next to all CHEK2 duplicons.

between intrachromosomal duplicons might also be due
to nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and/or
gene conversion [50-53]. Additional CHEK2 duplicons,
containing almost the entire CHEK2 duplicated portion,
are located in 2p11.1/2p11.2, 10p11.1, 22q11.1 and
Yq11.1/Yq11.21. Furthermore, one CHEK2 duplicon
sequence in the human genome remains chromosomally
unassigned (Chr_random), but may be located in the
1q12/1q21 euchromatin/heterochromatin transition
region or on the short arm of chromosome 13. FISH signals within these two regions (Figure 2B) do not corre-

spond to any chromosomally assigned CHEK2 duplicon
in the current human whole genome assemblies. Interestingly, duplicons located in 2p11.1/2p11.2, 10p11.1,
22q11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21 and Chr_random share the
same 3 kb LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear element 1)
integration, thereby suggesting a common origin. The
smallest CHEK2 duplicon was found in 10q11.21 and is
about 4.6 kb in size.
To elucidate the molecular evolution of the derivative
CHEK2 duplicons we investigated their flanking paralo-

gous sequences. All known CHEK2 duplicons extend into
the same proximal duplicated sequence, indicating a single initial pericentromeric "seeding" event. Subsequent
pericentromeric "swaps" of the larger duplicon cassette
led to the CHEK2 duplicon distribution observed in the
human genome. The ancestral location of the duplicon
proximal to all CHEK2 duplicons resides within the IGL@
locus in 22q11.21. The duplicated sequences extending
beyond the distal CHEK2 duplicon junctions are not identical for all derivative duplicons. While CHEK2 duplicons
16p11.2a and 15q11.2 show the same distal homology,
duplicons 2q11.1/2q11.2, 10p11.1, 16p11.2b, 22q11.1,
Yq11.1/Yq11.21 and Chr_random share a different distal
duplicated sequence. Thus, the latter set of duplicons may
have arisen by a duplication of the 16p11.2b duplicon,
followed by a LINE1 element integration and successive
pericentromeric exchange.
Subsequently, we used the same in silico approach to
determine the CHEK2 duplicon architecture of the chimpanzee genome (build2). Chromosomally assigned
duplicons in the chimpanzee genome showed chromosomal designations corresponding to the human genome
locations. Duplicons were detected on chimpanzee chromosomes 10, 15, 16, 22 and Y (Figure 3B), but not on
chromosome 2A. Two duplications containing almost the
entire CHEK2 duplicon and 11 smaller duplicon fragments were not chromosomally assigned in the current
chimpanzee whole genome assembly. Similar to the
human genome the largest CHEK2 duplicon is assigned to
chromosome 16 and a slightly shorter CHEK2 duplicon is
located on chromosome 15. In contrast to the human
genome the chromosome 15 duplicon contains no deletion, indicating that this deletion is human specific. In
addition, duplicons on chimpanzee chromosomes 10 and
15 contained small internal duplications and chromosome 16 duplicons seemed to be more fragmented (Figure
3B). These findings might be explained by chimpanzeespecific rearrangements or, more likely, by the inherent
problem of generating highly reliable contiguous
sequence assemblies in regions enriched in SDs.
Comparative in silico analysis (BLAT search http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ of the orangutan (ponAbe2) and rhesus macaque (rheMac2) whole genome assemblies using
the human duplicated CHEK2 sequence yield just one
copy in the respective genomes on their orthologous chromosome 22. No CHEK2 duplicon was found on orangutan chromosome 16 by this approach, but this may be due
to the underrepresentation of segmentally duplicated
sequences within pericentromeric regions in the whole
genome assemblies [49]. The unduplicated status of
CHEK2 in the rhesus macaque genome assembly is concordant with our FISH results obtained with fosmid WI21621D20.

Phylogenetic reconstruction of CHEK2 duplicon events in
anthropoids
To further delineate the evolution of the CHEK2 duplicons we performed phylogenetic analysis with non-coding and non-repetitive sequences using the MEGA4.0 [41]
software (Figure 4A). The multi-sequence alignment was
composed of 1951 basepairs derived from two loci within
the CHEK2 duplicons. The proximal sequence is located
upstream of exon 1 of TTC28 (NT_011520: 8465388–
8465900) and the distal sequence is located in intron 14
of CHEK2 (NT_011520: 8478430–8480219). We aligned
all human and chimpanzee derivative duplicons as well as
the ancestral sequences of human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. Our phylogenetic analyses placed all chromosomally assigned chimpanzee CHEK2 duplicons next
to the human CHEK2 duplicons showing the same chromosomal designations (Figure 4A). We therefore concluded the orthologous nature of the particular human
and chimpanzee CHEK2 duplicons on chromosomes 10,
15, 16, 22 and Y. Based on an estimated divergence time
of 25 million years between human and rhesus macaque
lineages [43], we calculated the effective nucleotide substitution rates (r = K/2 T) (Additional File 2). Calculated
times for pericentromeric "seed" and onset of "swaps", are
~22.3 MYA and ~15.9 MYA, respectively. Replacing the
human lineage by the chimpanzee lineage, a pericentromeric seed of ~21.2 MYA and an onset of swaps of ~18.0
MYA was calculated. Both independent calculations
placed the initial duplication event before the radiation of
orangutan and African great apes about 15 MYA [43]
thereby coinciding with our FISH results of fosmid clone
WI2-1621D20 on orangutan metaphase chromosomes
(Table 2; Figure 2B). No signs of duplication were
detected on metaphase chromosomes of the whitecheeked crested gibbon, which is thought to have split
from the great ape-human lineage about 18 MYA. Only
one signal in 7qdist representing the orthologous region
of human 22q12 was detected by FISH (Table 2; Figure
2B). This might either be explained by the loss of the primary CHEK2 duplicon in the gibbon lineage or the high
degree of sequence divergence between the putative gibbon duplicon and the human ancestral CHEK2 locus.
Such a high degree of sequence divergence is a very likely
explanation supported by previous investigations, which
detected an acceleration of substitution rates after the
duplication event [54-56]. Phylogenetic reconstruction of
the duplication events revealed that the largest human
and chimpanzee duplicons located on chromosome 16
share the highest degree of sequence identity with the
ancestral CHEK2 locus (Additional File 3). This indicates,
in combination with our FISH results, that the first duplication event was a pericentromeric "seed" from the ancestral interstitial CHEK2 locus toward the pericentromeric
region of chromosome 16 (Figure 4B). The duplicons
located on chromosomes 15 of chimpanzee and human

Phylogenetic reconstruction
Phylogenetic reconstruction of CHEK2 duplicon events in anthropoids. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of the CHEK2 duplicon family. A neighbor-joining phylogram was generated using MEGA 4.0 software [41] and rooted on the ancestral CHEK2
sequence of the rhesus macaque. We used 1951 bp of human and chimpanzee CHEK2 duplicons and ancestral CHEK2
sequences of human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. Ancestral loci are highlighted by a red box. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of nucleotide changes between taxa and are indicated below each respective branch (>0.001). Bootstrap
values > 70 from 1000 replicates are indicated above each corresponding branch point. Red arrows indicate the LINE1 integration and the pericentromeric "seed" and onset of "swaps". (B) Corresponding FISH signals with fosmid WI2-1621D20 on chromosomes of human (HSA), chimpanzee (PTR), gorilla (GGO), orangutan (PPY), white-cheeked crested gibbon (NLE), rhesus
macaque (MMU) and common marmoset (CJA). The left column represents all chromosomes, for which signals were unambiguously correlated to the respective sequences used for MEGA 4.0 analysis. Black arrows indicate the corresponding FISH signals on chromosomes 22. All other signal-containing chromosomes for which no corresponding sequence was used for
MEGA4 analysis are arranged in the grey box. These chromosomes are ordered with respect to their human orthologous
chromosomes. Chromosomes showing a signal for which no corresponding CHEK2 duplicon sequence was available are displayed on the top and are indicated by asterisks.

share the highest degree of sequence identity with the largest chromosome 16 duplicons of human and chimpanzee
(Additional File 3) suggesting a pericentromeric "swapping" event from chromosome 16 towards chromosome
15. Phylogenetic reconstruction identifies the duplicons
located in the pericentromeric regions of human chromosome 2 and human and chimpanzee chromosomes 10, 22
and Y as the most recent ones in the respective genomes.
This finding concurs with the in silico results, which
showed these duplicons to harbour a unique LINE1 element integration.
Detection of inter-species copy number variations of
CHEK2 by quantitative PCR
The paralogous CHEK2 duplicons in human and African
great apes are part of SDs. SDs are known to be frequently
associated with copy number variation [57-60]. A robust
approach to specifically target such variable regions is
quantitative PCR (qPCR). To independently determine
the CHEK2 duplicon numbers in the genomes of anthropoids we performed inter-species quantitative PCR with
primers located in exon 14. The complete alignment of
exonic sequences from all known CHEK2 duplicons of the
human, chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque
genome was used to determine the set of primers best
matching the sequences. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out
that these primers do not match perfectly to all CHEK2
duplicons in all analysed species. As FISH and in silico
analyses consistently demonstrated the single copy status
of CHEK2 in the rhesus macaque genome we used rhesus
macaque genomic DNA as the reference DNA for CHEK2
copy number prediction in human, great ape and OWM
species. We determined the copy numbers of five different
human individuals, three chimpanzee and gorilla individuals each, two orangutan and rhesus macaque individuals
each and one individual each of the pig-tailed macaque
and baboon (Figure 5; Additional File 4). All analysed
baboon, pig-tailed macaque, rhesus macaque and orangu-

tan individuals revealed just one CHEK2 copy per haploid
genome. A drastic increase in copy number was detected
for the African great apes with seven and nine CHEK2 copies in the haploid genomes of gorilla and chimpanzee,
respectively. The human genome presented the highest
increase in CHEK2 copy number, with a variation
between 13 to 16 CHEK2 copies per haploid human
genome. Our results significantly demonstrate, that the
analysed human individuals have a higher CHEK2 copy
number than chimpanzee and gorilla (p < 0.0001) and a
higher CHEK2 copy number than orangutan and all analysed OWMs (p < 0.0001). In addition, chimpanzee and
gorilla have a significantly higher CHEK2 copy number
than orangutan and OWMs (p < 0.0001). This observation confirms our FISH investigation and phylogenetic
analysis, which placed the burst of CHEK2 duplication
after the radiation of orangutan and African great apes.
Furthermore, we detected different numbers of CHEK2
copies within the analysed human individuals. Taking
into account the sample size, we can only presume
whether there is CHEK2 copy number variation in the
human population. As mentioned above, our qPCR
approach revealed only one CHEK2 copy per haploid
orangutan genome, whereas FISH detected two signals on
orangutan chromosomes 16 and 22 (Figure 2B) and phylogenetic analyses indicated the occurrence of a first
CHEK2 duplication event before the radiation of orangutan and African great apes (Figure 4). The failure to
amplify the second CHEK2 copy in the orangutan genome
might be explained either by primer mismatch or loss of
exon 14 in the orangutan chromosome 16 copy. Therefore, real CHEK2 copy numbers in non-human primates
may be even higher than were predicted by our approach.

Conclusion
CHEK2, which is essential for genomic stability [27], is
known to be a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene and
is frequently analysed in tumour diagnostics, e.g. of

CHEK2 copy number prediction by inter-species quantitative PCR
CHEK2 copy number prediction by inter-species quantitative PCR. Human (HSA, blue), chimpanzee (PTR, yellow),

breast, colorectal and prostate cancer [61,62]. CHEK2 is
one of a multitude of genes known to be part of SDs
[10,63]. Our detailed three-pronged approach clearly
demonstrates that CHEK2 duplicons show a high degree
of both copy number variation and sequence identity.
Furthermore, there is strong evidence, that not all duplicons in the human genome have been sequenced yet.
Thus, molecular diagnostics of CHEK2 inside the duplicated region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of CHEK2 duplicons. One previously published
variant (1422delT) of the functional CHEK2 gene, was
thought to predispose to Li-Fraumeni syndrome [64], but
subsequently was shown to be the genomic sequence of a
CHEK2 duplicon [63]. To avoid such diagnostic pitfalls in
the analysis of duplicated disease related genes, it is essential to close the still existing gaps in the human genome
sequence by closely examining segmentally duplicated
regions. Additionally, copy number and sequence varia-

tion within SDs might require further efforts to adapt the
diagnostic settings to different ethnic backgrounds.
Furthermore, our detailed CHEK2 analysis revealed its
highly dynamic nature during anthropoid evolution.
Both, FISH and phylogenetic analyses suggest the first
duplication event to have occurred before the radiation of
the great ape species. Extensive pericentromeric exchange
and intrachromosomal duplication events led to a burst
of CHEK2 duplications before the radiation of the African
great apes followed by lineage specific rearrangements creating species-specific distribution patterns in great apes
and human. In conclusion, our analysis of the CHEK2
duplicon evolution reveals, that SDs contribute to interspecies variation.

Sequence Identity Matrix of sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis. We created a sequence identity matrix of all sequences, which were
used for our phylogenetic analysis. Multi-sequence alignments were composed of 1951 basepairs derived from two loci within the CHEK2 duplicons. The proximal sequence is located upstream of exon 1 of TTC28
(NT_011520: 8465388–8465900) and the distal sequence is located
within intron 14 of CHEK2 (NT_011520: 8478430–8480219). The
sequence identity matrix of these sequence alignments was generated with
the BioEdit software (version 7.0.0).

Evolutionary distances overview. Based on the Kimura two-parameter
model the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site (K) were
calculated for outgroup distances: all human sequences to macaque
sequences (HSA to MMU), all human non-ancestral paralogs to the
macaque outgroup (MMU to Para) and the human ancestral duplicon to
the macaque outgroup (MMU to Anc). Comparison of these values with
two human interparalog distances, i.e. human ancestral to all human paralogs (Anc to Para) and the average K of all human paralogs (all Para),
provides information on the timing of the initial duplicationevent
(Macaque Seed) and the onset of secondary duplications (Macaque
Swaps). We calculated locus-specific effective nucleotide substitution rates
(r = K/2 T) based on an estimated divergence time of 25 million years
between the human and the Old World monkeys. In addition, all calculations were performed replacing the human lineage by the chimpanzee
lineage.
