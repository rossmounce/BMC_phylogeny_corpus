Abstract
Background: The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is co-evolved with its host and
therefore, origins and expansion of multiple populations and sub populations of H. pylori mirror
ancient human migrations. Ancestral origins of H. pylori in the vast Indian subcontinent are
debatable. It is not clear how different waves of human migrations in South Asia shaped the
population structure of H. pylori. We tried to address these issues through mapping genetic origins
of present day H. pylori in India and their genomic comparison with hundreds of isolates from
different geographic regions.
Results: We attempted to dissect genetic identity of strains by multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
of the 7 housekeeping genes (atpA, efp, ureI, ppa, mutY, trpC, yphC) and phylogeographic analysis
of haplotypes using MEGA and NETWORK software while incorporating DNA sequences and
genotyping data of whole cag pathogenicity-islands (cagPAI). The distribution of cagPAI genes within
these strains was analyzed by using PCR and the geographic type of cagA phosphorylation motif
EPIYA was determined by gene sequencing. All the isolates analyzed revealed European ancestry
and belonged to H. pylori sub-population, hpEurope. The cagPAI harbored by Indian strains revealed
European features upon PCR based analysis and whole PAI sequencing.
Conclusion: These observations suggest that H. pylori strains in India share ancestral origins with
their European counterparts. Further, non-existence of other sub-populations such as hpAfrica and
hpEastAsia, at least in our collection of isolates, suggest that the hpEurope strains enjoyed a special
fitness advantage in Indian stomachs to out-compete any endogenous strains. These results also
might support hypotheses related to gene flow in India through Indo-Aryans and arrival of Neolithic
practices and languages from the Fertile Crescent.

Background
Analysis of genetic diversity in microorganisms normally
reflects patterns of their own evolution although it is very
rare that this can portray their hosts' evolution. Co-evolution between host and pathogens can be explained only if
pathogens are not horizontally transmitted, and this supports a possible phylogenetic and evolutionary parallel of
the host and pathogens. Sadly, in many cases frequent
horizontal transmission separates the evolution of the
bacterium from that of the host. However, for some pathogens, such as H. pylori [1-3], and JC viruses [4], transmission is faithfully restricted to families within specific
communities. This phenomenon has in recent times provided evidence regarding patterns of human migration
[2,4,5] in different continents.
The human gastric pathogen H. pylori is presumed to have
co-evolved with its host [6] and established itself in the
human stomach possibly millions of years ago [7]. It has
been recognized recently as a reliable biological marker of
host-pathogen co-evolution and ancient human migration based on sequence variation in select gene loci. H.
pylori are genetically diverse to the extreme, providing
about 1,400 informative sites within 3.5 to 4.5 kb of
sequence from housekeeping genes, and their global
genetic structure based on such sequence-haplotypes parallels that of humans [2]. Moreover, epidemiological
studies have shown that transmission occurs predominantly within families [8-11]. H. pylori therefore, could
provide a window into human origins and migration
[1,3] and the impact of religions and social systems on
stratification of human ethnic groups [12].
A landmark study based on PCR based DNA motif analysis proposed that H. pylori jumped recently from animals
to humans and, therefore, the acquisition of H. pylori by
humans may be a recent phenomenon [13]. This study
has been the basis for the idea of 'H. pylori free New World'
[13]. However, several independent studies based on
large-scale analyses of candidate gene polymorphisms
contrasted the idea of recent acquisition and suggest that
H. pylori might have co-evolved with humans [1,6,14].
Using the same set of Peruvian isolates described earlier
by Kersulyte et al. [13], Devi et al. [3], from our group have
suggested that the genetic make up of south American isolates could be an admixture of ancestral and modern lineages of H. pylori. They clearly highlighted presence of
ancestral H. pylori in Peruvians that possibly survived
influxes of Spanish strains from Iberian expansions in
Peru about 500 years ago. Also, according to this study,
the survival advantage of indigenous strains was possibly
due to the acquisition of western type cagPAIs from newly
arrived Spanish strains.

Previous genotyping studies on Indian isolates have
largely targeted molecular epidemiological issues. However, Wirth et al. [12], for the first time, using H. pylori genotypes, addressed issues such as impact of two different
religions and societal systems on stratification of human
ethnic groups [12] in the remotest north eastern Ladakh
area of India. In view of intriguing ideas on ancient origin
of H. pylori, and the fact that ancient origins and arrival of
H. pylori are hardly known in the context of the vast South
Asian continent, additional evidences based on strains
from different geographical regions of Asia are clearly
needed.
In this study, we attempted to unravel population genetic
structure and gene pool diversity of Indian isolates of H.
pylori from culturally and linguistically diverse ethnic
Indians. The main objective behinds the study has been to
explore genetic features of the strains that might explain
their ancestral origin and might help reconstruct different
waves of pre-historic human migration in India. We also
looked if it is possible to link some of the native strains to
their ancestors in West Asia, Eurasia or Europe.

Results
DNA isolates, diagnostic PCR and epidemiological
genotyping
DNA quality and purity was confirmed by agarose gel
electrophoresis and diagnostic PCRs revealed presence of
cagA, iceA, vacA, glmM, babB and oipA genes in all the
Indian isolates we tested. The molecular epidemiological
features of all the 63 strains we analyzed have been elaborated in Figure 1. Our isolates were quite diverse with
respect to the plasticity region ORFs that we analyzed and
no specific signature was seen dominant as regards to the
arrangement or rearrangement of these ORFs. This validated that all the isolates that we looked at were in fact
independent and did not represent any derivatives of
clonal evolution.

Specific primers amplifying different alleles (see methods
section) were used to analyze the vacA allelic diversity. The
sizes of the amplified products for vacA s1 and vacA s2
were 259 bp and 286 bp respectively. Of the 63 isolates
analyzed, the s1 allele was detected in 33 (52.3%) and the
s2 allele type was detected in 11 (17.4%) strains. The m1
variant was detected in 34 (53.9%) and the m2 variant in
37 (58.7%). The highly toxigenic vacA allele combination
s1m1 was found to be dominant (33.3%) as compared to
other vacA allele types. The vacA genotype s1m2 was
detected in 9 isolates (14.2%) whereas vacA s2m1 and
vacA s2m2 genotypes were detected in 4 isolates (6.3%)
each. Not all the isolates yielded full vacA amplicons, as
regions of vacA gene, in particular, the signal region posed
difficulty in amplification. This is a very common phenomenon observed in H. pylori owing to frequent recom-

Neighbor joining tree (Kimura 2-parameter) (right) showing the global population structure of H. pylori wherein Indian isolates are
highlighted. The phylogenetic tree was based on a total of 23 sequence records of South and North Indian isolates while incorporating ~400 other sequence records from pubMLST database representing different H. pylori populations and sub populations in
the world. The population genetic structure was investigated by determining the multilocus haplotypes based on concatenated
sequences of seven unlinked housekeeping genes that are scattered around the H. pylori chromosome. Individual isolates were
assigned to bacterial populations called hpEastAsia (sub-populations: hspEAsia, hspMaori, hspAmerind), hpEurope, hpAfrica1 (hspSAfrica, hspWAfrica), hpAsia2 and hpAfrica2 [11]. Representatives from each of these (sub)-populations were chosen for subsequent analysis of the cagPAI. Isolates from the population hpAfrica2 do not contain cagPAI. Phylogenetic relationships were also
estimated through NETWORK analysis (left) based on 665 mutating positions that revealed the co-evolution of the H. pylori
genome. The Ladakhi (yellow) and other Indian (light green) lineages were more clearly discerned within the European (dark
green) cluster (centre box), when analyses based on the remaining 650 mutating positions were performed. For the Neighborjoining tree (right), the bootstrap values of the interior branches as calculated in MEGA, were significantly high to indicate the correct topology of the branches within the clades.

bination. The vacA alleles have been shown to differ in
frequency and type among East Asian isolates [15], for
instance, s1c is the predominant signal sequence allele
among East Asian isolates [16]. Typically, the vacA s1c was
found to be completely absent in the Indian isolates.
Multilocus sequence analysis
We report that almost all of the H. pylori strains from India
share significant homology to the members of sub-population hpEurope. A total of 33 MLST profiles based on
DNA sequence of a concatenated multigene comprising of
7 individual gene loci (atpA, efp, mutY, ppa, trpC, ureI and
yphC) were generated from Indian isolates. Data compris-

ing of these MLST profiles were subjected to comparative
genomic analysis with ~400 other H. pylori sequences
from different geographical and ethnic groups [11]. Such
analyses upon construction of a neighbor-joining tree in
MEGA 3.1 software using Kimura-2 parameter revealed
clear geographic distribution of various H. pylori populations and sub-populations, essentially in accordance with
the previous results [1,3,17]. All the Indian isolates from
North and South India and 2 of them from Ladakh clustered under hpEurope. Seventeen Ladakhi isolates clustered tightly to form a separate branch, hpAsia2. Results of
MLST analysis in MEGA3.1 were successfully reproduced
using NETWORK based phylogeny, which revealed simi-

Comparative genomic analysis of the cagPAIs from Indian isolates
Figure 3
Comparative genomic analysis of the cagPAIs from Indian isolates. A) PCR based analysis of the complete cagPAI of 5 representative
hpEurope Isolates: 3K, 4K, 3C, MS40 and MS38 from India. Overlapping PCR primers amplified the whole cagPAI indicating the intactness
of the PAI in these isolates. B) Global pair-wise alignments of whole cagPAI sequences of different H. pylori isolates were generated by
VISTA using default parameters [47]. The OK129 genome was taken as the base sequence (not shown) and rest of the sequences were
aligned against it. The X-axis denotes length of the sequence under consideration and the Y-axis conveys homology in % with the base
genome sequence). The Indian hpEurope isolate, 3K was aligned with other whole cagPAI sequences from GenBank along with the cagPAIs of HP 26695, HPJ99 and HPAG1. The accession numbers for the public domain sequences of the cagPAIs from Europe [9] and Japan
[49] that we used in our analyses, were as follows – Ca73 (AY330638 and AY330639), Du23:2 (AY330643 and AY330644), Du52:2
(AY330640, AY330641 and AY330642), F80 (AB120421), OK112 (AB120425), F16 (AB120416), F17 (AB120417), F28 (AB120418), F79
(AB120420), OK101 (AB120422), OK109 (AB120424). Sequence of the French isolate, Fr 908 was determined in this study (EF195721).
While the cagPAI sequence of the Indian isolate 3K (hpEurope) was found to be genetically highly similar to and aligning closely with the
26695 sequence, it also revealed significant sequence similarities with other isolates of European origins (that harbor Western type of cag
EPIYA sequences) such as HPAG1, OK112, Du52, Du23, Ca73, J99 and Fr908. It was however largely unrelated to the East Asian like isolates (mainly harboring Asian type cag EPIYA sequences) such as F16, F28, F79, OK109, F17, OK101 and F80.

lar acquaintances for H. pylori in India. Mirroring the
spread of human populations from Africa, our network
analysis suggests the co-evolution of H. pylori with Homo
sapiens, as also suggested recently [6]. Both the domains of
the Network tree based on 650 (data not shown) and 665
(Figure 2, left) mutating positions clearly separated African from non-African sequences. The second domain
seemed to harbor higher phylogenetic information, since
the resulting graph is more clearly structured, with a more
accurate separation among European, Amerindian, Asian
and Australasian lineages. The Indian H. pylori sequences

were clustered within the European portion of the network, wherein the first domain identifies a separate
branch, encompassing the majority of the Ladakhi samples, as a distinct sub-population of hpAsia2 within the
European variability, and remarking the isolation of the
human host population. However, many of the Ladakhi
Muslim samples clustered in hpEurope and revealed a significant sequence similarity to the mainland Indian samples. These results are in agreement with previous studies
on the hypervariable region of human mitochondrial
DNA that showed the common origin of European and

Indian populations [18] and the relative homogeneity of
Indian populations regardless of their ethnic and linguistic affiliation [19].
Analysis of the cagPAI and its Right Junction (RJ) motifs
Overlapping primer amplification to span entire cagPAI
worked reproducibly with our isolates; Figure 3(A) reveals
complete PCR output for the ~38 kb cagPAI region in 5
representative strains MS38, MS40, 3K, 4K and 3C. All the
constituent genes of the PAI were successfully amplified
for all the Indian isolates studied. To get more insights
into composition and arrangement of the gene loci within
the PAI, complete sequencing of the cagPAI of isolate 3K
was performed. This isolate was from a patient with peptic
ulcer disease (PUD) from South India. The size of complete cagPAI of this isolate was 36,876 bp with a G+C content of 35.9. The sequence composition and gene order in
the cagPAI of 3K was compared to those of the three completely sequenced strains 26695, J99 and HPAG1 which
revealed some minor differences such as fused HP0521
and HP0522 genes due to the deletion of a single nucleotide at the 3' end of HP0521. Similarly single or dinucleotide differences were observed in the cagX (HP0528),
cagN (HP0538) and cagE (HP0544) and most of these
insertions and deletions were observed in the intergenic
regions. Broadly, the cagPAI genes were very conserved as
regards to the amino acid sequences when compared with
at least 15 different publicly available cagPAI sequences.

cag-RJ (the extreme right junction of the cagPAI, between
3' end of the cagA gene and the start of the glutamate racemase – glr) was studied for our 63 isolates where 99% isolates harbored type III motif. A total of 47 of 63 strains
(75%) gave positive PCR results for cag-RJ (Figure 1). The
type III motif was found in 27 of 39 South Indian isolates
and 20 of 24 North Indian isolates. It is noteworthy that
cag-RJ typeIII motifs are genetically close to European type
I motifs probably due to an ancient insertion event, followed by recombinational scrambling among type I and
III lineages [13]. We did not find in our Indian isolates
any type II motifs, which constitute a signature characteristic of East Asian gene pool.
Genetic relationship of Indian isolates based on cagA and
whole cagPAI sequences
A full-length cagPAI sequence based alignment was constructed using the Indo-European type 3K and Afro-European type Fr908 (French patient isolate) sequences
determined in this study, along with 15 different whole
cagPAI sequence from GenBank: Ca73, Du23: 2, Du52: 2,
F16, F17, F28, F79, F80, OK101, OK109, OK112, OK129,
26695, J99 and HPAG1. Our South Indian isolate, 3K, was
found to be aligning with the Western cagPAI sequences
(Figure 3B).

We examined relatedness of the cagA gene sequences of
tribal isolates from India to the mainstream Indian isolates and the European isolates by analyzing a 219 bp
informative fragment near the 5' end of cagA which usually distinguishes the European and the East Asian strains
[20]. Comparative sequence analysis was used to construct phylogenetic relationship in MEGA3.1. All the
sequence records corresponding to the isolates of Santhal
and Oraon tribals revealed homologies to the main
stream Indian strains from Hyderabad, Lucknow and Bengal and also to all the representative European strains.
These tribal isolates did not cluster with East Asian strains
(Figure 4).
This makes it clear that the cagPAI of Indian strains is a
completely evolved one and probably was acquired from
a European source, well before the arrival of H. pylori in
India. This is also evident from the fact that the Indian
strains, though of a European descent, do not share characteristic features of Asian cagPAIs.

Discussion
Although the Indian peninsula has seen many different
waves of population migration [21], the Paleolithic
archaeological evidence is not clearly visible to understand peopling of this country [22]. Nonetheless, the
Indus Valley and Harappan civilizations portray footprints of Neolithic period [23] suggestive of the arrival of
Indo-European speakers who established the caste system,
an anthropologically significant prehistoric event [24,25].
The cultural and historical importance of the arrival and
settlement of the Indo-Aryans is undisputed, but it is not
clear if this was established through 'replacement of the
existing people by outsiders' [22] or did the 'people
already in India changed their habits and cultures?' [22].
Such questions have never been addressed in an unambiguous manner, even though the potential of polymorphic
DNA markers in reconstruction of human migration and
phylogeography [26,27] has long been appreciated. It
appears that even carefully planned geographic genomics
studies remained largely speculative due to the lack of a
universal 'gold standard' as the classical mitochondrial
DNA markers offer too few informative polymorphisms
and the newly developed Y – chromosome markers are
even less polymorphic than mitochondrial hypervariable
regions [2]. Lately, new genetic models were successfully
harnessed based on parasites and pathogens that probably accompanied their human host during evolution and
much of the human history including migrations and
expansions [2,4,5] in different continents. Such
approaches constitute an attractive alternative to reconstruct human origins and spreads, population dynamics
and bottlenecks, wars and displacements, farming and
plagues etc.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/184

Our study was aimed at tracking ancient origins of the
Indian H. pylori through a two-pronged approach to i)
substantiate European link of the pathogen in India and
ii) to prove that the pathogenicity island was also of European origin and this PAI has not been a 'recent' addition
to the genome of Indian H. pylori. Our analyses, based on
MLST and comprehensive genotyping of the cagPAI,
linked about 100% of the Indian isolates to H. pylori subpopulation hpEurope. This perhaps conveys the message
that H. pylori was most probably introduced to the Indian
subcontinent by ancient Indo-European nomadic people
and our findings, therefore, are consistent with the idea of
a possible gene flow into India with the arrival of IndoAryans.
Overall, based on the MLST data (Figure 2) and the cagPAI
patterns (Figure 3), we suggest that H. pylori might have
arrived in India probably at the same time when IndoEuropean language speaking people crossed into India
(~4000–10,000 years before present). Alternatively, the
unquestionable common origin of Indian strains with the
European ones could be actually more ancient, following
the upper Paleolithic spread of Homo sapiens in Eurasia, as
suggested by mtDNA variability [18], and our data on H.
pylori MLST do not rule out this possibility.
Present day India represents a 'genetic playground' with
tremendous diversity of cultures, and languages. However, the people are largely stratified as tribals and nontribals [25]. Four main language families are spoken, the
largest being, Indo European (IE), which is prevalent in
North, and the second largest Dravidian (DR) group represents languages spoken in the South [28]. The other two
language groups include Tibeto-Burman (TB) of the SinoTibetan and the Austro-Asiatic (AA) families, largely spoken in far North and the North-east India. While most of
the IE speakers belong to castes, the majority of the tribal
communities (>450) speak about 750 different dialects
that fit within any one of the other three language families
(DR, TB, AA) [25,28]. Such an enormous cultural diversity
might argue for many different populations and sub-populations of H. pylori. But until now, and including this
study, H. pylori with genetic features of hpEurope have
only been reported from India [29,30]. Even the newly
described sub-population hpAsia2 from Ladakh is also a
variant of hpEurope and many Ladakhi strains that we
looked at in this study, clustered with European H. pylori
clade (Figure 2). Also, the cagA sequences from H. pylori
belonging to tribal Oraon and Santhals were indistinguishable from those of the mainstream Indians and
Europeans (Figure 4), indicating sweeping spread of a single H. pylori genotype across the Indian peninsula. Moreover, we did not document presence of any other H. pylori
populations and sub-populations such as hspAmerind,
hspMaori, hpAfrica and hpEast Asia in the limited, but

representative culture collection that we looked at. However, the visible footprints of other migrations into India
such as from the North Eastern corridor and the presence
of phenotypic features resembling to Africans in the
South, make it unwise to presume an 'H. pylori free India'
at the time of arrival of Indo-European speaking invaders.
This issue and the fact that H. pylori's first association with
humans traces back to millions of years before present, in
Africa [6,17], it is more realistic to hypothesize that H.
pylori of African and Asian gene pool might have already
been present in India. The predominance of a single H.
pylori population might therefore, point to a distinct survival advantage conferred by a fully functional (western
type) cagPAI. This analogy is consistent with the scenario
we previously reported [3] for the South American, Amerindian strains, which were presumably out competed by
their Spanish counterparts arriving with an intact and
functional western cagPAI.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/184

such explanations, with the estimation of divergence
times between the H. pylori sequences in the different
human populations. These issues therefore need to be
addressed in future.

Conclusion
In summary, we found significant overlap among genetic
identities of Indian and European H. pylori based on core
and flexible genome markers. This remarkable genetic
similarity points to their possible common genetic origins
and could therefore be potentially useful in understanding entry, survival, spread and adaptation of H. pylori in
Indian stomachs. Also, this study is consistent with the
hypothesis of co-evolution of H. pylori with H. sapiens and
therefore, could form a reliable foundation to test and
reconstruct gene flow into India with the arrival of IndoAryans or otherwise.

Methods
Finally, it is possible that phylogeny based on highly
recombining gene loci [15,29,31-35] may not be completely foolproof to extract inheritance from different
ancestral populations, especially when we use tools such
as MEGA 3.0 [36], which do not support admixture analysis. Moreover, phylogenetic methods based on bifurcating trees, such as Neighbor joining analysis, may not be
fully appropriate for analysis at the intra-species level
[37,38], especially in case of hypervariable genomic
regions, where multiple homoplasy due to reversions,
recurrent mutations etc., or polytomy may sometimes
confound the phylogenetic interpretation. However, the
housekeeping genes used here are selectively neutral and
uniform as compared to virulence associated loci such as
the flagellins and vacA [10], and therefore, recombinant
and hybrid alleles that blur lineage inferences, could be a
rare occurrence and not a routine. Partly in view of this
assumption and due to our previous experiences on dissecting complex ancestry of native Peruvian isolates using
phylogenetic methods [3] we did not attempt admixture
analysis with complicated Bayesian statistics. However, to
ensure that our conclusions did not represent shortcomings of a single method, we adopted an integrated phylogenetic approach combining MEGA/NETWORK based
analyses and genotyping strategy based on full cagPAI and
its left and right end sequences. Interestingly, these
approaches unambiguously show the Indian H. pylori genotypes scattered among the European ones. Although this
would be consistent with gene flow into India with the
Indo-Aryans, or even more ancient origins following the
Paleolithic expansion of humans in Eurasia, but also consistent with another scenario: migration from India to
Europe. However, the later scenario becomes insignificant
due to the unavailability of supporting archeological, linguistic and historical data. Nonetheless, an understanding
of the time-scale would be helpful for choosing between

Bacterial strains, genomic DNA and diagnostic PCR
All the strains were cultured by the Centre for Liver
Research and Diagnostics, Deccan college of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, from patient biopsies. All the biopsy
material was collected with necessary ethical clearances
and after obtaining informed consents. Template DNA
was prepared from single colony picks as described previously [39]. Genomic DNAs of the 10 Ladakhi strains were
received from Mark Achtman, Max-Planck Institute für
Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany. Genomic DNA was
isolated from strains obtained from patients with different
disease types including Duodenal Ulcer (DU); Gastric
Ulcer (GU); Gastric Cancer (GC); Gastritis (G); Non Ulcer
Dyspepsia (NUD); Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD); Chronic
Duodenal Ulcer (CDU); Portal Hyper Tension (PHT) etc.
(Figure 1). However, in the current study, the clinical
background of the individual isolates was not taken into
account. The Indian isolates we looked at (n = 63) were
originally from Native Indian people mainly of Aryan and
Dravidian ancestry from India. PCR based analyses of
genes namely cagA, glmM, babB [14] and oipA were carried
out to ascertain the quality of DNA samples we used. Also
these PCR assays served as amplification level controls for
the analysis of insertion, deletion and substitution in the
cagPAI.
MLST analysis by MEGA 3.1 and NETWORK 4.2.0
A 600 bp region each from the 7 housekeeping genes
spread throughout the genome atpA, efp, ureI, ppa and
mutY, trpC, yphC was amplified by PCR and sequenced for
all the Indian isolates exactly as described previously [3].
Sequencing was performed on both the strands, using an
ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
USA). PCR and direct sequencing were performed at least
twice to determine and confirm the DNA sequences for
each isolate. Consensus sequence for each of the samples

was generated using Genedoc (version 2.6.002). Multiple
alignments of sequenced nucleotides were carried out
using Clustal X (version 1.81). Neighbor joining trees
were constructed in MEGA 3.0 [36] using bootstrapping at
10000 bootstrap trials and through Kimura-2 parameters.
For beginning construction of phylogenetic trees based on
MLST genotyping procedures, ~400 sequences of the 7
housekeeping genes of strains belonging to different
established genotypes, including 40 sequences of isolates
from Ladakh were obtained from the pubMLST database
[40] (courtesy, Daniel Falush). The Indian H. pylori diversity represented in the final MEGA3.0 alignment and the
tree thereof comprised of a total of 63 sequences inclusive
of the 10 Ladakhi sequences generated in house along
with the other 9 representative Ladakhi sequences from
the database. We performed on MLST sequence data a network analysis using the program Network 4.2.0.0.
[38,41]. In particular, the median-joining algorithm for
multistate DNA data was used [42,43]. Because of a program limitation, which cannot handle more than 1000
polymorphic sites at once, we performed the analysis separately on two halves of the sequence (encompassing
respectively 650 and 665 polymorphic sites). The input
file (in *.rdf format) was obtained using the commercial
software DNA Alignment 1.1.2.1.
Profiling of the cagA gene, the whole cagPAI and its right
junction
The 5' end of the cagA gene was amplified using primers
mentioned elsewhere [44] and the amplified products
were sequenced with forward and reverse primers. The
consensus sequences were then translated into amino acid
sequences using GeneDoc software (version 2.6.002) and
were then assigned to the Western or the East Asian group
based on the C or D repeats present respectively in the
EPIYA motif [45]. Genetic diversity of the cagA 5' end
sequences for our Indian isolates: MS15, MS7, MS4 and
3K along with 26695 and J99 were compared to the other
records from GenBank [20,30,46]. A phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree was constructed by MEGA 3.1 version
using these sequences (Figure 4).

PCR analyses were carried out to find the status of the cagPAI using 8 sets of primers that amplified the cagA gene,
its promoter region, the cagE and cagT genes and the left
end of the cagPAI [8,29,34]. We also analyzed whole cagPAI of the representative isolates from India (3K, 4K, 3C,
MS40 and MS38) by PCR using overlapping primers as
described by Blomstergren and colleagues [9]. The entire
cagPAI sequence of a single representative Indian isolate
3K was determined. The complete cagPAI sequence was
aligned by VISTA programme [47] against other PAI
sequences belonging to strains 26695, J99, HPAG1 and 13
other clinical isolates corresponding to H. pylori sub-pop-

ulations hpEurope, hpEast Asia and hpAfrica1 (Figure
3B).
Chromosomal rearrangements are known to give rise to 5
types of insertion-deletion and substitution motifs in the
region between the right end of cagA gene and the glutamate racemase (glr) gene (cag-RJ). We assessed these rearrangement profiles for all of the Indian isolates by PCR as
described earlier by Kersulyte and colleagues [13].
Analysis of the chromosomal plasticity region cluster
Chromosomal plasticity region ORF's were assessed for all
the 63 Indian isolates by PCR based typing to ensure that
all the strains that we looked at were independent and
non-clonal by descent. The PCR primers and the procedures used for evaluating the presence of the plasticity
region ORF's (JHP912, HP986, JHP947, JHP926, JHP944,
JHP931, JHP945 and JHP933) have been descried previously [48].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes for
the 23 representative Indian isolates have been deposited
in the GenBank [Accession numbers, GenBank:
DQ504165–DQ504183 and DQ927245–DQ927248

which the sequence was determined in our laboratory,
have been deposited in Genbank under accession nos.
