Evolution of gene regulation of pluripotency - the
case for wiki tracks at genome browsers
Georg Fuellen1*†, Stephan Struckmann1,2*†

Abstract
Background: Experimentally validated data on gene regulation are hard to obtain. In particular, information about
transcription factor binding sites in regulatory regions are scattered around in the literature. This impedes their
systematic in-context analysis, e.g. the inference of their conservation in evolutionary history.
Results: We demonstrate the power of integrative bioinformatics by including curated transcription factor binding
site information into the UCSC genome browser, using wiki and custom tracks, which enable easy publication of
annotation data. Data integration allows to investigate the evolution of gene regulation of the pluripotencyassociated genes Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. For the first time, experimentally validated transcription factor binding
sites in the regulatory regions of all three genes were assembled together based on manual curation of data from
39 publications. Using the UCSC genome browser, these data were then visualized in the context of multi-species
conservation based on genomic alignment. We confirm previous hypotheses regarding the evolutionary age of
specific regulatory patterns, establishing their “deep homology”. We also confirm some other principles of Carroll’s
“Genetic theory of Morphological Evolution”, such as “mosaic pleiotropy”, exemplified by the dual role of Sox2
reflected in its regulatory region.
Conclusions: We were able to elucidate some aspects of the evolution of gene regulation for three genes
associated with pluripotency. Based on the expected return on investment for the community, we encourage other
scientists to contribute experimental data on gene regulation (original work as well as data collected for reviews) to
the UCSC system, to enable studies of the evolution of gene regulation on a large scale, and to report their findings.

Background
Inferring the evolution of gene regulation is a complex
bioinformatics task. Over the last years, it became evident that the degree of conservation of gene regulatory
elements had been overestimated in the past [1-3].

However, this renders the exceptions all the more interesting: the lower the extent of conservation of regulatory
elements, the more important the few elements that are
conserved. Therefore, this paper discusses some biological background, theoretical principles and bioinformatics
approaches to investigate the evolution of gene regulation, using three regulators of the cellular state of pluripotency as an example and revealing new insights into
evolution of pluripotency.

In summary, we wish to:
1) Exemplify how the UCSC browser can be used to
investigate the evolution of gene regulation.
2) Exemplify how the Wiki track at UCSC could be
used to support such investigations by a large-scale
community effort.
3) Report the results we obtained from our study of
the evolution of gene regulation of three specific
genes.
4) Put our results into a wider, general context by
referring to Carroll’s theoretical work.
Gene Regulation and its Evolution

Strands of DNA include transcribed parts (genes), which
are often used as blueprints for proteins, and ‘regulatory
elements’, which decide in part about the timing and the
amount of transcription [4]. If transcription factors bind
to (some of) these elements, the amount of transcription
may be altered. The elements can be organized into socalled modules, often termed cis-regulatory modules.
These are usually bound by transcription factor complexes called ‘enhanceosomes’. The typical regulatory
region of a gene includes an array of cis-regulatory modules, usually consisting of sets of transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS). Next to the transcription start site
are the core and the proximal promoter (up to 250 base
pairs), followed by the distal elements (the latter are
more than 250 base pairs away from the transcription
start site) [4]. The network of transcription factors and
other regulators, together with the cis-regulatory modules of TFBSs and other regulatory elements on the DNA
level, form the “gene regulatory network”. Evolution of
gene regulation is concerned with the evolution of the
gene regulatory network [5-9]. Many regulatory elements
evolve due to mutations, insertions and deletions of
nucleotides, by selection, duplication, inversion, translocation or by random drift, or due to transposable elements. [1]. Their volatility can lead to high binding site
turnover. Nevertheless, the evolution of some regulatory
elements can be traced back to the origin of the vertebrate lineage [10].
Principles of the Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks

Evolution of gene regulatory networks for developmental
processes should follow some general principles, from a
theoretical point of view, as formulated by Carroll in a
recent paper [11]. Regulators play a role in a number of
different processes, following the principles of “Mosaic
pleiotropy” (the same proteins contribute to different developmental processes and body structures), and “Heterotopy”
(changes in spatial regulation are associated with morphological divergence). Both, transcription factor binding and
gene expression reflect these principles, which tend to

Page 2 of 20

complicate computational inferences. Such inferences are
possible, however, and they rely on four other principles
observed by Carroll. “Ancestral genetic complexity” is a
necessary condition: without it, there would not be a rich
structure in ancestral gene regulatory networks and complexity would have evolved independently in recent
lineages. The principles of “Deep homology”, “Functional
equivalence of distant homologs”, and “Infrequent toolkit
gene duplication” are necessary as well, because even if
ancestral complexity exists, it is only detectable, if it is
conserved in recent lineages. In line with the complexity
of the processes to be organized by the transcription factors and their target genes, the network of transcription
factors and target genes must be large (“Vast regulatory
networks”, Carroll). Finally, Carroll’s principle of “Modularity of cis-regulatory elements” is a consequence of the
pleiotropy of transcription factors, which affect their targets by grouping and binding together in a combinatorial
context-dependent fashion. Genes that have to be regulated synchronously are expected to share some or all of
their cis-regulatory elements [11]. Investigating the whole
complex network of gene regulation in its entirety is a
challenge. Concentrating on the subnetwork of early
development, the challenge becomes smaller, even though
due to the pleiotropy, subnetworks in general are neither
independent, nor disjoint. [11].
Evolutionary Bioinformatics of Gene Regulation

Bioinformatics tools and software for estimating, analyzing and/or visualizing the evolution of gene regulation
are rare, because data are scarce [12]. In particular,
sequence motifs describing TFBSs as parts of regulatory
elements have low overall information content (binding
sites feature a length of 4-20 bases, approximately),
making their reliable in-silico detection difficult. Many
transcription factor binding site prediction tools exploit
libraries of known binding motifs and evolutionary conservation, and usually they infer sets of related sites (cisregulatory modules). Assuming that conservation goes
with functional importance, “phylogenetic profiling” and
related methods [13-22] suggest that predicted binding
sites are the more likely to be functional, the more conserved they are. The integrated analysis of the evolution
of cis-regulatory modules and the network of regulators
is in its infancy. By assembling experimentally validated
TFBS information for a specific set of genes, we wish to
contribute data that is useful for the development of
methods and software towards this aim, and we hope
that other researchers will follow suit, in a community/
wiki effort.
Gene Regulation in Stem Cells

Stem cell research is currently one of the most active
areas in molecular biology and biomedicine, based in

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67

part on recent breakthroughs in generating ‘induced
pluripotent stem cells’ (iPS cells) from somatic cells like
fibroblasts (reviewed in [23,24]). Such a ‘reprogramming’
of differentiated cells into ‘pluripotent’ ones is possible
by directly manipulating the pluripotency-related gene
regulatory network [25] of the cell, confronting the differentiated cell with artificial amounts of key transcription factors such as Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2
and Nanog. These ‘ectopic’ factors then re-direct the
overall network of interaction and regulation. Redirection yields a state very close to the ‘embryonic state’. In
fact, mice can be obtained in which part (or even all) of
their cells derive from the manipulated somatic cells
[26]. Understanding the evolution of the gene regulatory
network underlying stemness, or ‘pluripotency’, may
give valuable guidance in improving reprogramming
technology, highlighting similarities and differences
across species, for example between model organisms
and human.
However, data on pluripotency-related gene regulation
are scattered around in the literature, and it takes a lot
of manual effort to extract validated regulatory information from it. Because most papers lack genomic coordinates, it is not straightforward to obtain transcription
factor binding sites with precise genomic location. Only
with such precision, studies of their evolution become
possible and these sites can be studied in the context of
the wealth of information available in a genome browser
such as UCSC [27]. To get such an effort started, the
experimentally validated regulatory elements of the
three key transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog
will be described in this paper. Using the UCSC browser, we can then discuss their evolutionary history.
Some observations are linked to Carroll’s theoretical
work, and they will be listed in Table 1. As we will see,
despite incomplete and inaccurate data and a complex
phenotype, the computational study of the evolution of
gene regulation relevant for stem cells/pluripotency confirms observations from the literature and reveals some
interesting insights as well.

Methods
Literature-curated Data and UCSC Conservation and
Alignment Tracks

To investigate the evolution of gene regulation of the
pluripotency factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog, we
first conducted a literature survey of their phylogenetic
history and expression patterns. We also assembled a
data set of validated TFBSs in the regulatory regions of
these genes. Databases of experimentally validated sites
in metazoa/vertebrates (such as ORegAnno [28] and
Pazar [29]) only cover a small fraction of what is known
from the literature. Therefore, an intensive literature
search was performed, yielding the TFBS information in

Page 3 of 20

Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (tabulated in Table 2). For each
entry marked by ‘+’ in Table 2, we were able to confirm
that the nucleotides at the genomic position are indeed
the ones reported as the binding site in the corresponding paper. UCSC tracks were generated by formatting
the literature data. These tracks can then be viewed
together with UCSC multiple alignment and conservation tracks, in three ways:
1) After starting a “Session” from the homepage at
http://genome.ucsc.edu/, the “Restore Settings”
option in the “Session Management” enables to “Use
settings from another user’s saved session:”. Using
“Fuellen” as “user:”, “session name:” may be “mm9.
Oct4”, “mm9.Sox2” and “mm9.Nanog”. Alternatively
the following links can be used.

2) The “Regulatory Element” tracks are also available
as text files in the supplement (Additional Files 1, 2,
3), and can be loaded as custom tracks at the UCSC
browser.
3) Using the UCSC genome browser, the gene in
question can be located, and the wiki track of its
genomic region can be inspected.
All literature-curated TFBS data were also submitted
to PAZAR [29,30]. Submission to the ORegAnno [28,31]
database has been postponed because the upload facility
of ORegAnno was not functional while preparing this
manuscript.
Computational Analysis of the Evolution of Gene
Regulation

As described in [12], there are currently a limited number of options available to computationally infer the
evolution of gene regulation. In this paper, we focus on
the simple approach to study the evolutionary history as
described by pre-computed UCSC alignments, and we
apply the ReXSpecies software developed in-house. As
far as the authors are aware, ReXSpecies is the only tool
attempting to directly infer the evolution of gene regulation from the DNA perspective (that is, the gain (and
loss) of regulatory elements and modules in phylogenetic history). The first version of ReXSpecies was published in 2008 [32]. Conserved homologous sequences

aligned. In this alignment, transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS) are searched using position specific scoring
matrices, employing PoSSuM [33,34] and matrix
libraries (JASPAR [35] and Transfac [36]). Two TFBSs
are considered to be homologs, if they are predicted to
be bound by transcription factors known to be homologous, and share essentially the same genomic coordinates. Then, the leaves of a phylogenetic species tree
[37-39] are labeled with the TFBS data and the labels of
the inner nodes of the tree are estimated using parsimony [40]. Extending the work of 2008, putative modules (groups of TFBSs) are identified based on these

first track is not yet documented very well; there is no
legend for the relation between color and expression level.
The only hint in the track description is: “As is standard
with microarray data red indicates overexpression in the
tissue, and green indicates underexpression”. For the latter
three tracks, color is based on a logarithmic scale: “In full
mode, the color of each item represents the log base 2
ratio of the signal of that particular experiment to the
median signal of all experiments for that probe.”

Results and Discussion
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog Evolution

Investigating the regulatory evolution of a set of genes,
it is first of interest to know their evolutionary history.
The founding father of the POU5 subfamily of POU
transcription factors, and ancestor of Oct4/Pou5f1,

appears in the lineage of the gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) [45,46], which includes fish. Two duplicates of
the gene (Pou5f1 and pou2/POUV) can be found in tetrapods, but usually one duplicate got lost in today’s species; the only known exceptions are monotremes and
marsupials [46]. Also, there is a paralog designated
POU5F2 in some mammals (rodents and primates),
which is involved in sperm development (in case of
mouse). The POU5 subfamily is probably most closely
related to the POU2 and POU3 subfamilies [47]. The
Ensembl gene tree (Additional File 4; Supplementary
Figure S1) of Pou5f1 does not consider the paralogs in
monotremes and marsupials (the single genes are highlighted by a red box), nor does it consider the POU5
paralogs found in chicken, lizard, frog and axolotl
reported in the literature [46]. Instead, the human pseudogene POU5F1P1 and some questionable predicted
paralogs in rabbit, guinea pig, kangaroo rat, marmoset,

§ DNA sequence at UCSC does not match sequence in paper.

cow, elephant, and armadillo are included in the tree,
marked by red duplication nodes. Not considering them,
the gene tree suggests that duplications of Pou5f1 are
less frequent than thought [46].
Sox2 diverged from its putatively closest paralog Sox1
after the second round of genomic duplication within
the vertebrate lineage [48], even though the entire Sox
family is probably of metazoan origin [49]. In the
Ensembl gene tree (Additional File 5; Supplementary
Figure S2), Sox2 evolution is mostly concordant with
Carroll’s principle of “Infrequent toolkit gene duplication"; the only putative paralogs are Q6WNU1 (in takifugu), Sox14 (in chicken) and some genes around Sox5
(in rat). In the later two cases, we observe long branches
(dashed lines, highlighted in red).
Nanog probably originated in the vertebrate lineage
[50]; since then it has diverged significantly from its

closest paralogs, the NK domain proteins. Apart from
the Nanog P1 pseudogene (in human, chimp and gorilla,
highlighted in red) and questionable predicted paralogs
(all of them highlighted in blue) in some of the monkey
genomes (marmoset, orangutan, chimp, gorilla) and in
tenrec (Echinops telfairi), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus),
and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), the Nanog gene
tree at Ensembl (Additional File 6; Supplementary Figure S3) follows species phylogeny and confirms that
Nanog duplications are infrequent as well. Sanchez-Sanchez et al [51] suggest that the cooperation of Oct4,
Sox2 and Nanog is conserved between mammals and
medaka fish; the role of the POU/Sox transcription factor complex in development may even go back to the
common ancestor of vertebrates and insects (bilateria)
[52,53] (Table 1), a putative case of “Ancestral genetic
complexity” and “Deep homology”. In case of Oct4,

Page 10 of 20

noncoding elements can indeed be found in fish, based
on the UCSC [27] 30-way Multiz alignment & conservation (which includes fish).

Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog Expression

To summarize the expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog,
we refer to recent reviews by Bosnali et al [53] and
Johnson et al [54]. Oct4 is restricted to embryonic pluripotent cells of specific stages of development, i.e. the
morula, inner cell mass, the primitive ectoderm (epiblast) of the blastocyst, and to cells of the germline.
Exemplifying the “modularity of cis-regulatory elements”
(Table 1), the Oct/Sox element of the distal enhancer
(in the CR4 region, Figure 1, highlighted in red) is
deemed responsible for its expression in the morula,
inner cell mass and in germ cells, while proximal regulation by the LHR-1 binding sites (in the CR2 and CR1
regions, Figure 1, highlighted in blue) is implicated in its
expression in the primitive ectoderm (also known as
epiblast), see [54]. Bindings by other factors are scattered across both distal and proximal elements. Nanog
is also expressed in embryonic pluripotent cells and
germ cells and it plays a role in somite organization
[55]. Sox2 expression overlaps with the expression of
Oct4 and Nanog, but it also plays a role in adult stem
cells of the neural lineage [48], a case of “mosaic pleiotropy”, “heterotopy” and “modularity of cis-regulatory
elements” (Table 1). Masui et al [56] found that Sox4,
Sox11 and Sox15 overlap Sox2 in its expression pattern
and are able to replace Sox2 in some of its functionality
in embryonic pluripotent cells. In summary, all three
genes may be labeled control genes of pluripotency and
early development. Accordingly, their regulation shares
some, but not all, characteristics of developmental control genes [57]. In particular, they seem to be regulated
by a medium number of enhancers (three known clusters of binding sites in case of Oct4, two known clusters
in case of Sox2 and Nanog, see Figures 1 to 6) and by
microRNAs [58]. All three genes lack a TATA box
[59-61] which fits well with the low expression divergence associated with TATA-less genes [62]. Overall,
gene expression data displayed at UCSC (see methods)
do not reflect what is known from the literature (Additional Files 7,8 and 9; Supplementary Figures S7-S9),
since few embryonic data are included at UCSC. Sox2
neural expression (in cerebellum/brain) is most likely
true positive.
Evolution of Pluripotency Core Regulation

Given that Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog can be traced back to
the ancestral vertebrate lineage, it can be expected that
part of the regulatory elements of Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog are ‘pvCNEs’, pan-vertebrate conserved noncoding elements [63]. As we can see from Figures 1 to 6, in
case of Oct4 and Sox2, a few traces of conserved

Evolution of Oct4 Regulation (Figures 1 and 2)

The 30-way Multiz alignment at UCSC suggests that the
Oct4/Pou5f1 proximal promoter is conserved in jawed
vertebrates, since it is found in eutherians and in zebrafish (orange box in Figure 2). Concordantly, Parvin et al
[64] describe the zebrafish pou2 proximal promoter,
including putative Octamer motifs (which may be
bound by pou2) and retinoic-acid responsive elements
(which may be bound by nuclear receptors). According
to Parvin et al [64], no ‘meaningful sequence similarities’
between the upstream sequences of pou2 and Oct4 can
be identified, though. UCSC data support that the proximal enhancer (CR2 region) is conserved in eutheria and
marsupials, and the distal enhancer (CR4 region, highlighted in pink) is conserved at least in eutheria.
A recent publication [46] reports the existence of two
CR4-like regions in platypus, but only one of them
contains a conserved Oct-Sox binding site. No such
CR4-like region is displayed at UCSC. Nevertheless, the
auto-regulation of Oct4 by itself (and Sox2) is probably
a feature shared at least by mammals: Most recently this
hypothesis was also put forward by [65]. Inspection of
the UCSC RepeatMasker tracks of the regulatory regions
of Oct4 indicates that its autoregulation region does not
seem to be affected by repeats, cf. Figure 1, pink box.
(The specific ERVK repeat retrotransposing Oct/Sox
binding sites [1] is included in the RepeatMasker library,
but it does not show up here). Interestingly, one Esrrb
site (Esrrb_P2, [66], highlighted in green) is found in
mammals but not in primates, in line with the observation that Esrrb is not expressed in human embryonic
stem cells [67]. Thus, our analysis suggests the loss of a
binding site that may be the result of a loss of expression of the transcription factor that binds. Moreover,
the Esrrb_P2 site is also the only validated binding site
in the Oct4 regulatory region that is part of a repeat
identified by RepeatMasker (Figure 1, cyan box).
According to UCSC, the repetitive element is a PB1D7
Alu SINE, which originated before the divergence of the
primate and the rodent lineages [68]. Inspecting the
conservation track, we see some conservation of the
Esrrb_P2 site in shrew, horse and elephant (Figure 2,
cyan box), so the repeat may indeed be of mammalian
origin.
Evolution of Sox2 Regulation (Figures 3 and 4)

Sox2 is the gene with the most conserved regulatory
region (according to UCSC), and it exemplifies best Carroll’s principles of “Modularity of cis-regulatory elements”, as well as “Mosaic pleiotropy”, “Heterotopy”,

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

“Ancestral genetic complexity”, and “Deep homology”
(Table 1). Four upstream conserved subregions are
found in mammals, chicken, frog and fish; they can be
traced back approx. 500 million years. These conserved
regions include the N2 region involved in neural regulation [48] as well as in pluripotency (including validated
Stat3 and Oct4/Brn1/2 binding sites, see Figure 4, highlighted in red), and the region around the NF-Y binding
site (blue box in Figure 4) of the proximal promoter,
just upstream of the transcription start site. The other
regions involved in pluripotency, around the downstream auto-regulatory Oct/Sox binding site (pink box)
and the proximal Stat3 and HIF1alpha binding sites
(green box in Figure 4), are found conserved up to platypus, whereas the other regions involved in neural

development (N3, N4, N5) are also found in fish (N1
can be traced back to Xenopus frog). Thus, the hypothesis emerges that neural regulation of Sox2 is as old or
older than regulation implicated in pluripotency. There
is no evidence that the downstream autoregulatory binding site is affected by repeats, see Figure 3 (pink box).
Most of the other validated binding sites are also not
part of a repeat identified by RepeatMasker.
An investigation of a subregion of the N2 region,
around the experimentally validated Stat3, Gli, and
Oct4/Brn1/2 binding sites upstream of Sox2, by
ReXSpecies highlights the predicted binding sites and
modules displayed in Figure 7. The conserved Stat3 and
the Brn1/2 binding sites are among the hits; there is no
binding site model for Gli that gives a match. The eight

Figure 7 Part of the Sox2 Regulatory Region, analyzed using ReXSpecies. Part of the Sox2 regulatory region, displayed using the UCSC
genome browser. Extra tracks added by ReXSpecies display the predicted transcription factor binding sites and modules scoring highest.

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

hits are sorted by branch length score (see methods).
The module scoring highest is found in track #1, and it
is composed of the Brn1/2 binding site and a close-by
predicted NFkappaB binding site, both inferred by parsimony to arise at the vertebrate root of the tree. Further
predicted modules in tracks #2 and #4 are inferred to
have originated in the tetrapod and amniote lineage,
respectively. They contain many overlapping predicted
binding sites, and possibly at most one of them is valid.
Nevertheless, tracks #2 and #4 trigger some interest
because they include both pluripotency-related (Oct/Zic)
and neural-development-related transcription factor
binding sites (Pax/Ncx). These high-scoring tracks may
reflect the dual role already noted for the N2 region
investigated here. Tracks #3 and #5 display predicted
sites/modules with a history of gain and loss inferred by
parsimony. The track #3 module was gained in tetrapods and mammals, lost in eutherians and re-gained in
boreoeutherians. The track #5 module was gained independently in Eutheria and in Sauria. Tracks #6 and #7
display modules predicted for eutherians and therians,
respectively. Finally, the parsimony-based reconstruction
of binding site evolution infers that the Stat3 site (track
#8, matching the STATx binding site model) was gained
in mammals, lost in eutheria, and re-gained in rodents
and monkeys (Simiiformes). Whether any of these predicted sites/modules reflect true positive binding (and
subsequent regulatory effect) must of course be validated experimentally.
Evolution of Nanog Regulation (Figures 5 and 6)

At UCSC, the Nanog upstream region does not feature a
high-coverage 30-way Multiz alignment (see Figure 6);
in case of human, chimp, orangutan, rhesus and cow,
individual alignment chains compensate. As noted by
Kuroda et al [69] for the OctSox site in the proximal
promoter (highlighted in red), conserved regions are
shared with elephant (and armadillo & tenrec), so they
originated before the three mammalian superorders
(Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Boreoeutheria) split [70,71],
about 120 million years ago. The OctSox site is not part
of a repeat, but the more distal Nanog upstream region
contains a lot of repeats (SINEs, Simple repeats) which
partially overlap with the validated binding sites (see
Figure 5).

Conclusions
Genome Browsers such as the UCSC browser are well
suited to enable data integration. In our case, combining
information already available (on sequence conservation
and repeats) with information gained from the literature
(on regulatory elements) enabled us to further our
understanding of the evolutionary history of some regulatory elements involved in pluripotency. Recently, the

Page 12 of 20

UCSC browser started a Wiki track system, and we
hope that our effort contributes to a community effort
of adding useful information to the system, so that more
and more information can be viewed in context, e.g. in
the context of conservation and homology information
derived from sequence alignment. In particular, it would
be useful to have validated regulatory information available for all genes in the genome, for mouse and human
alike. To avoid clutter, we suggest that this information
is placed into a dedicated “TFBS Wiki” track. (In fact,
the Wiki track system should eventually support not
just community input to pre-specified Wiki tracks, but
it should permit modifications to its structure, such that
a hierarchy of tracks can evolve, reflecting the needs of
the community.) Moreover, it would be useful to combine such information with network data. For example,
validated transcription factor binding sites may directly
suggest a link from the transcription factor to its target
if both are included in a publicly available network or
pathway. Finally, an integration of Wiki projects (UCSC
Wiki tracks, WikiGenes [72], WikiPathways [73], and
more) may be a worthwhile future goal, enabling community-driven integrative bioinformatics on a large
scale, towards a seamless in-silico assembly of knowledge soon after it is obtained on the bench.

Reviewers’ comments
Reviewers’ report 1

Dr. Gustavo Glusman and Dr. Juan Caballero, Institute
for Systems Biology, Seattle, USA(nominated by Dr.
Doron Lancet, Department of Molecular Genetics,
Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel)
In this manuscript the authors describe a computational
analysis of three central pluripotency factors, starting from
an extensive literature search for data not available in public databases, and leading to hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the regulation of these genes. The
authors present a methodology to integrate external
data into the UCSC genome browser. This integration
improves the insights that we can infer from different
sources, specially using the visualization framework. To
validate the method, the authors performed an analysis of
the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) present in the promoter regions of the pluripotency-related genes Oct4, Sox2
and Nanog. The integration of conservation data revels
patterns of common regulators between multi-species.
Also, they propose a molecular history of these regulator
in evolutionary time. The authors conclude with a call for
community contributions to the novel UCSC Wiki Track
system. Due to the nature of the work, this article contains
a wide variety of elements. It has many more references
than the typical Research Article, almost becoming a mini
review. It presents novel untested hypotheses (which
might fit the Hypothesis article format) but these are

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

based on more than just a survey of previous results. It
reports some specific discoveries made by computational
analyses, and thus might fit the Discovery note format, but
this would require dropping significant review content. It
presents and exemplifies a working methodology that
other researchers could emulate, but falls short of such a
Tutorial level by relying on pre-computed gene trees, and
not describing how to improve on them where they are
recognized to be deficient. Finally, its call for community
contributions to the UCSC Wiki Track is not accompanied by considerations on the usability of such unstructured content.
Authors’ Response

We added a more thorough discussion of the pros and
cons of the Wiki approach towards the end of the article.
In particular, we note that a specific “Wiki TFBS” track
should be established by UCSC (see also below). We give
a more detailed description of the points we want to get
across, and how the structure of the article follows from
this, by adding another paragraph of the introduction as
follows:
In summary, we wish to:
1) Exemplify how the UCSC browser can be used to
investigate the evolution ofgene regulation.
2) Exemplify how the Wiki track at UCSC could be
used to support suchinvestigations by a large-scale
community effort.
3) Report the results we obtained from our study of
the evolution of generegulation of three specific genes.
4) Put our results into a wider, general context by
referring to Carroll’s theoretical work.
While the need to address such distinct aspects of the
work is understandable, the intermediate format currently used caused a loss of focus on the most important aspect(s) of the work. Too much importance seems
to be given to the methodology used, which is not an
original method: the power of data integration in bioinformatics and systems biology is well known. The UCSC
genome browser and many other genomic browsers
allow the integration of personal and external data
sources, and have APIs to facilitate this. On the other
hand, a deeper analysis and discussion of the evolutionary history of the cis-regulators for 3 key genes in pluripotency could be more important for the reader and the
scientific community. The manuscript could be shortened, or perhaps restructured by moving the less central content to the (currently very short) Methods
section. Reformatting the article to regain focus would
also help clarify the figure set. At the moment, the first
figure referred to in the Results section is Figure 9, with
the first six figures introduced in the Methods. Figure 8,
its associated legend text and reference 76 are never

Page 13 of 20

referenced in the manuscript - in fact, it’s not clear why
the BED format, never mentioned in the text, would
need to be illustrated by a figure in this paper.
Authors’ Response

We removed the figure explaining the BED format and
renumbered the figures.
In the Methods section, it is claimed that “Databases
of experimentally validated sites in metazoa/vertebrates
(such as ORegAnno and Pazar) only cover a small fraction of what is known from the literature”, which necessitated the extensive literature search that was
performed. The results of the literature search were
summarized in the Supplementary Table 1. It would be
interesting to show, in that table, which of the sites
identified in the literature search were already annotated
in ORegAnno and Pazar. Were this indeed a small fraction? Were there sites in the databases that were not
recovered by the literature search that was performed?
Do the authors have confidence that the literature
search was extensive enough? In that Supplementary
Table, sites marked with ‘+’ could be identified with
confidence because the nucleotide sequences mentioned
in the articles is identical to that in the reference genome. How were the other sites treated?
The authors mention that data submission to ORegAnno was “postponed because the upload facility of
ORegAnno was not functional while preparing this
manuscript”. If this is a temporary technical difficulty
with that database, is it of use to the reader to know of
the delay?
Authors’ Response

At the time of writing, Pazar featured two of the binding
sites we compiled, and ORegAnno did not feature any.
The literature references associated with the Pazar sites
were followed up, validated and included. We believe
that the literature search converged based on the observation that for Oct4/Pou5f1, two recent reviews (Niwa,
2007 [74] and Kang et al, 2009 [75]) list a subset of the
sites we found, but no additional ones. Sites that could
not be validated (nucleotide sequences mentioned in the
articles are not identical to that in the reference genome)
were included and marked clearly (as regions, denoted
“R()” in the table). The problems with OregAnno are
unfortunately persistent. More specifically, before our
annotation work, the UCSC ORegAnno track did not
contain any entries in the regions that we investigated.
Also, we did not find any entries via the ORegAnno web
site.
Pazar lists some entries in the corresponding regions in
three projects ("TFe”, “Pleiades genes”, and “Pluripotency”, the latter is our contribution). Most of the “TFe”
and the “Pleiades genes” entries refer to regions larger
than 150 base pairs. In these cases, our entries are an
improvement, because they contain the exact position of

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

TFBSs. For Sox2, there are entries for the regions N3 and
N4. For Pou5f1, one match for NR2F2 is listed with a
PubMed reference [76], which overlaps with our entry
from [77]. The six other annotations for Sox2 are longer
than 150 bp. For Nanog, one of our annotations, the
Sox2 part of the heterodimer TFBS that we have called
“Oct4 Sox2” reported by Rodda [78] and by Kuroda
[79]already existed, split in two entries (one for each
author) in the “Pleiades genes” project. Two predictions
of more than 150 bp in length can also be found.
Presumably because of this technical difficulty, the
authors added the regulatory sites identified via literature search to the UCSC Wiki Track, and suggest this
as a role model for other researchers to emulate. Is this
really a good idea, though? The UCSC browser already
includes a large number of tracks for specific types of
genomic information, and most users will naturally
search for TFBS data in TFBS tracks (like ORegAnno).
Would it not be counterproductive for researchers to
default to adding their analysis results to the Wiki
Track, instead of attempting to add them to the more
relevant tracks? What would the Wiki Track look like if
thousands of researchers added to it a pot pourri of different data types, many of them redundant with existing
tracks? At which point would the Wiki Track lose its
usability, and by being a catch-all, would the other
tracks become less reliable in their completeness if
researchers opt to dump data into the Wiki Track
instead?
Authors’ Response

As stated towards the end of the article, we believe that
a wiki-based information resource can keep up best with
the large amount of data being generated. But we agree
that the Wiki track must be subdivided, so that our
information must go into a “Wiki TFBS” track. Upon
publication of the article, we will approach the UCSC
Genome browser people with respect to this issue.
We added the following text to the last paragraph of
the article:
To avoid clutter, we suggest that this information is
placed into a dedicated “TFBS Wiki” track. (In fact, the
Wiki track system should eventually support not just
community input to pre-specified Wiki tracks, but it
should permit modifications to its structure, such that a
hierarchy of tracks can evolve, reflecting the needs of the
community.)
Additional comments by section
Abstract, 1st paragraph
“Experimentally validated data on gene regulation are
hard to obtain.”
This claim is unclear, as there are many ways to
obtain gene regulation information (i.e. microarrays,
ChIP-seq).

Page 14 of 20

Authors’ Response

ChIP-seq only considers binding, no regulatory effect.
ChIP-seq combined with microarray data is a highthroughput approach that delivers data of lower quality,
as compared to the direct small-scale experiments in the
papers that we tracked down.
3rd paragraph
“Based on the expected return on investment for the
community, [...]”
The conclusions didn’t mention the insights obtained
from the promoter analysis and evolutionary conservation in the promoter regions of the pluripotency-related
genes.
Authors’ Response

We now start the conclusions as follows:
We were able to elucidate some aspects of the evolution of gene regulation for three genes associated with
pluripotency.
Background, 2nd paragraph
“If transcription factors bind to (some of) these elements, the amount of transcription may be altered.”
The dynamic of the interactions between TF-CREs is
vaguely described, besides the regulation of the regulators is not presented (i.e. TF translocation, phosphorilation cascades, miRNA regulation of the TF).
Authors’ Response

We write “may be altered” for good reason. Giving more
details would indeed turn this part of the text into a
mini-review.
“Closest to the transcription start site are the core and
the proximal promoter, followed by distal elements.”
This need a reference and some coordinates or lengths
to describe the typical order and size of the sub-regions
in a promoter.
Authors’ Response

We now write “Next to the transcription start site are the
core and the proximal promoter (up to 250 base pairs),
followed by the distal elements (the latter are more than
250 base pairs away from the transcription start site)
[4].“
“Many regulatory elements evolve due to mutations,
insertions and deletions of nucleotides (by selection, or
by random drift), or due to transposable elements.”
Also transposable elements can import new CREs into
a promoter region, and other variation events can occur
affecting the regulatory region (duplication, inversion,
translocation).
Authors’ Response

We now write “Many regulatory elements evolve due to
mutations, insertions and deletions of nucleotides, by
selection, duplication, inversion, translocation or by random drift, or due to transposable elements.”
3rd paragraph

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

“Genes that have to be regulated synchronously are
expected to share some or all of their cis-regulatory elements.” and “Concentrating on the subnetwork of early
development, the challenge becomes smaller, even
though due to the pleiotropy, subnetworks in general
are not independent.”
Missing references.
Authors’ Response

While most of these two claims is self-evident, we now
cite Carroll here.
4th paragraph
“Assuming that conservation goes with functional
importance, “phylogenetic profiling"‚ and related methods [13-22]...”
The number of references could be reduced; 3-4 tool
examples would be enough.
Methods, 1st paragraph
Supplemental Table 1 could be improved by including
the consensus sequence for each motif and the observed
sequence in the promoter.
“The ‘Regulatory Element’ tracks are also available as
text files in the supplement, and can be loaded as custom tracks at the UCSC browser.”
Supplement number/title is missing.
Authors’ Response

We added Supplement number/title.
2nd paragraph
“Two TFBSs are considered to be homologs, if they
are predicted to be bound by transcription factors
known to be homologous, and share essentially the
same genomic coordinates.”
This need not be enough evidence of homology, as
there are many ambiguous and unspecific matrix motifs
that produce high rate of false positives. Many phylogenetic profiling methods use a filtering step calculating a
p-value or entropy of the motif detected using a control
dataset of sequences.
Authors’ Response

Correct, but the prediction method is supposed to take
care of this issue; we consider the E-values provided by
the prediction method.
Results and discussion, 1st paragraph
“Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog evolution”
Evolutionary time could help to understand the origin
and duplication history in all the cases presented.
Authors’ Response

It’s future work to take a close look at evolutionary time.
However, we expect that there is no “molecular clock”, so
insights may be limited.
How do the authors define a “questionable predicted
paralog"?
Authors’ Response

A questionable predicted paralog is a sequence that is
likely due to miss-prediction or miss-assembly. Evidence

Page 15 of 20

for this is that the species is not among the standard species for which gene predictions have been validated
extensively, and are based on a high-coverage genome
assembly. Further, the sequence is usually included in
the EnsEmbl gene tree together with another sequence
from the same species carrying the canonical name such
as “Sox2”.
2nd paragraph
“In particular, they seem to be regulated by a medium number of enhancers (three known clusters of
binding sites in case of Oct4, two known clusters in
case of Sox2 and Nanog, see Figures 1 to 6) and by
microRNAs [58].”
A regulatory diagram could help to visualize the regulation of the 3 genes.
4th paragraph
“Thus, our analysis suggests the loss of a binding site
that may be the result of a loss of expression of the
transcription factor that binds.”
Or a change in the sequence specificity of the TF, or a
TF substitution.
Authors’ Response

Correct, it’s correlation (of loss of binding site and loss of
expression of the transcription factor that binds), not
causality, so the interpretation is indeed just a plausible
suggestion.
5th paragraph
“Evolution of Sox2”
A comparison of the conservation of CREs in the
other family members could expand the view of the regulation of Sox2.

Conclusions
Again, the conclusion is focused exclusively in the methodology used, not in the insight gained in the promoter
analysis of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog.
References
The number of references could be significantly
reduced for a research article.
Figures
Figure 8 is unnecessary.

Supplemental files

Reviewer’s report 2

Dr. Niels Grabe, TIGA Center (BIOQUANT) and Medical Systems Biology Group, Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University Hospital Heidelberg,
Germany(nominated by Dr. Mikhail Gelfand, Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Information Transfer Problems Russian Academy of Science, Moscow,
Russian Federation)
Previously, it has been shown that the transcription
factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are of key importance in
cellular pluripotency. The authors demonstrate how
DNA binding sites for these transcription factors, which
are extracted from literature, can be further analyzed
with the UCSC genome browser system. For the question of the evolution of gene regulatory elements alignments of the binding sites were performed and
introduced into the system. The authors generally propose the scientific community to use the UCSC in combination with wiki approach to collect experimental TF
binding sites.
Comments

1.) Title: I am not sure in how far the sub-title “the case
for wiki tracks at the UCSC” is easily understandable to
a broader readership.
Authors’ Response

We modified the title, now writing “the case for wiki
tracks at genome browsers.” For the intended readership,
we believe this is more understandable.
2.) The Abstract should be improved for a broader
readership: The authors should make clearer what wiki
and custom tracks are. The fact that multiple alignments
have been performed should be included in the abstract.
Also the authors should be more specific in how far
what Carroll’s thesis are and in how far they have been
confirmed.
Authors’ Response

We amended the “Results” section of the abstract as
follows:
We demonstrate the power of integrative bioinformatics
by including curated transcription factor binding site information into the UCSC genome browser, using wiki and custom tracks, which enable easy publication of annotation
data. Data integration allows to investigate the evolution
of gene regulation of the pluripotency-associated genes
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. For the first time, experimentally
validated transcription factor binding sites in the regulatory regions of all three genes were assembled together
based on manual curation ofdata from 39 publications.
Using the UCSC genome browser, these data were then
visualized in the context of multi-species conservation
based on genomic alignment. We confirm previous hypotheses regarding the evolutionary age of specific regulatory
patterns, establishing their ‘deep homology’. We also

Page 16 of 20

confirm some other principles of Carroll’s ‘Genetic theory of
Morphological Evolution’, such as “mosaic pleiotropy”,
exemplified by the dual role of Sox2 reflected in its regulatory region.
3.) Methods section: Paragraph “Literature curated
data": I would suggest to transfer details of the UCSC
handling in 1), 2) and 3) into the supplements of the
manuscript and restrict the descriptions to the general
overall idea.
Authors’ Response

Since there is no page limit, we believe that the text
should be as self-contained as possible.
4.) Methods section: Paragraph “Computational analyses": The general strategy used here should be made
clearer. For example it is not clear whether ReXSpecies
has actually been used or not.
Authors’ Response

Indeed, this paragraph was not clear at all. At the beginning of the paragraph, we now write:
“As described in [12], there are currently a limited
number of options available to computationally infer the
evolution of gene regulation. In this paper, we focus on the
simple approach to study the evolutionary history as
described by pre-computed UCSC alignments, and we
apply the ReXSpecies software developed in-house. As far
as the authors are aware, ReXSpecies is the only tool
attempting to directly infer the evolution of gene regulation from the DNA perspective (that is, the gain (and loss)
of regulatory elements and modules in phylogenetic history). The first version of ReXSpecies was published [...]”
At the end of the paragraph, we added the clarification
that:
“ReXSpecies was used to generate Figure 7, “Part of the
Sox2 regulatory region, analyzed using ReXSpecies."”
5.) Results section: As the manually collected binding
sites are central importance for the manuscript, the
authors should think about including the supplementary
tables in the main document.
Authors’ Response

We included the supplementary table in the main
document.
Reviewers’ report 3

Review by Dr. Franz-Josef Müller, Center for Regenerative Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA, USA and University Hospital for Psychiatry and
Psychotherapy (part of ZIP gGmbH), University of Kiel,
Germany(nominated by Dr. Trey Ideker, University of
California San Diego, La Jolla CA, United States).
Fuellen and Struckmann combine proposing a crowdsourcing approach to annotate transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) with a more specific analysis of TFBS
evolution of pluripotency associated transcription
factors.

Fuellen and Struckmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:67
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/67

Both topics are interesting, yet the combination proves
to be problematic since the resulting review/hypothesis/
data paper hybrid seems to be less succinct and stringent than I would wish for in a scientific manuscript.
I do think, that rigorous focus on fewer key point and a
significant shortening of the manuscript and reduction
of the figure count will benefit the manuscript.
Authors’ Response

We believe that the combination is well-justified: Just
proposing the Wiki approach without highlighting its
benefits would not be convincing. However, based on the
other reviews, we added a clear list of aims at the end of
the “Background” section and we believe that this new
text addresses the concern of “rigorous focus”. Also, we
reduced the number of figures by moving the three figures
regarding the UCSC expression data and the gene trees
into the Supplement.
There are also issues in regard to the main hypothesis:
while the conclusion, that curation efforts such as in a
wiki-track in the scientific community would be highly
desirable, there is currently no realistically viable system
how such an effort could be supported in our current
high impact and grant driven system.
Authors’ Response

We agree on this “political” issue. But we believe that
something should be done now, and that our paper may
get the ball rolling after all. In the medium term, we
believe that it must be a condition for acceptance of a
scientific paper that main results are made available to
the community in a form that is community-editable
and, if possible, computer-readable (and we would like
to stress that the Wiki idea includes track-keeping of all
modifications, so that a common knowledgebase is created that includes a “history” enabling credit assignment). In the long term, we believe that community/wiki
resources and scientific publications will converge into a
single multi-faceted interconnected resource.
Would, for example, I put a postdoc on such a curation effort project?
Most likely not, because how could she/he become an
independent researcher with publications that are ‘just’
metadata curation efforts, which most likely will not be
accepted in any conventional original research journals.
Although it would be desirable in ideal world that such
efforts would be adequately honored, it is not likely that
this will happen anytime soon. The alternative model is
that companies take up the task and professional curation of literature findings is a pay for service. The most
prominent example is BioBase, which offers the Transfac database for researchers at a reduced fee (~$3000),
which is much less than a postdoc/year.
I really don’t want to get into the copy left/copy right
discussion, I do believe that information should be free
and accessible, especially if its generation was funded by

Page 17 of 20

taxpayers money supporting non-profit research, but
still we have to acknowledge the imperfections in our
scientific systems and how human beings act in it. Thus
I would like to ask the authors to discuss and also compare commercial databases (Transfac is actually pretty
good for the analysis of pluripotent stem cells) as an
alternative and where the authors see their concept in
regard to such existing concepts.
Authors’ Response

Since access to commercial databases is limited, we do
not wish to perform such a comparison. Also, such a
comparison would be problematic because there are
companies offering similar services. We think that there
is room for large-community efforts as well as for commercial data-curation efforts; in particular we expect
commercial data-curation efforts to be more focussed on
specific topics (e.g. disease-related data).
One may argue, that such databases will not contain
TFBS information for, say gorillas, but are such information actually relevant beyond a focused study such as
the one by Fuellen and Struckmann?
There are currently several, yet unpublished efforts
under way to reprogram endangered species (sometimes
with only 7 individuals left on this planet). The main
problem, these researchers are facing are actually not
unknown TFBS, but to be able to use the genomic
sequences of the reprogramming factors so these can be
cloned for the reprogramming vectors since these species are usually not sequenced.
Looking at this from this angle, shouldn’t we instead
make the case for more high quality sequencing of other
species and improvements in our (functionally relevant)
TFBS-prediction algorithms for an instant online prediction of such sites, if specific question arise?
Authors’ Response

We hope that resources can be allocated to both efforts!
