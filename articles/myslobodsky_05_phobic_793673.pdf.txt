Abstract
Anorexia nervosa is a clinically significant illness that may be associated with permanent medical
complications involving almost every organ system. The paper raises a question whether some of
them are associated with premorbid vulnerability such as subcellular ion channel abnormalities
('channelopathy') that determines the clinical expression of the bodily response to self-imposed
malnutrition. Aberrant channels emerge as a tempting, if rather speculative alternative to the
notion of cognitively-driven neurotransmitter modulation deficit in anorexia nervosa. The concept
of channelopathies is in keeping with some characteristics of anorexia nervosa, such as a
genetically-based predisposition to hypophagia, early onset, cardiac abnormalities, an appetiteenhancing efficacy of some antiepileptic drugs, and others. The purpose of this article is to stimulate
further basic research of ion channel biophysics in relation to restrictive anorexia.

Introduction
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an intractable illness with a high
long-term mortality that affects 1% to 3.7% of the young
women [1]. The death rate of patients with AN is up to 30
times greater than that of age-matched normal women.
About 20% of AN patients remain chronically disabled
[2]. Despite its grave complications, the lack of exact
pathophysiology and organic definition, denies AN an
independent nosological grade or a status of a neuropsychiatric problem. The various theories that have been proposed to explain the cause or origin of AN can be divided
into two major schools of thought, socio-cultural and biological. Until very recently, AN was categorized as a disease of psychogenic origin (e.g., a consequence of
unresolved conflicts of the individual psychosocial development) [3]. Many subscribed to the cultural paradigm
inasmuch as it was rendered secure from experimental
scrutiny. Not surprisingly, pharmacotherapeutic options

in AN continue to be limited. For years, the disorder was
so refractory that even 'heroic' efforts such as lobotomy,
once reserved for treating schizophrenia were attempted
[4]. Kennedy and Goldbloom [5] maintained in their
review of 1991 that there was little, if any role for pharmacotherapy in AN. Over a decade later and more than 200
studies on the topic, the majority of patients stay refractory to the currently available drugs [6,7]. Therefore, alternative approaches toward AN pathophysiology has to be
explored. A small proportion of individuals developing
AN and the commonality and influence of socio-cultural
pressures only emphasize the need for identifying the vulnerable population.
In keeping with this goal, the present article looks at the
possibility that AN is associated with intrinsic vulnerability of potassium channels. It is to these channels and to
their kinetics that cerebral cells owe their membrane

potentials and the many characteristics that control local
and distant changes in multiple organ systems. The following provides a selective perspective dealing mainly
with the apamin-sensitive small-conductance calcium
(Ca2+)-activated K+ channels (SK channels) [8] as they
might be related to the cognitive and somatic manifestations of AN.
"Laparophobia" and K+ channels
Young women with AN are recognized for commonly
manifesting greater levels of general inhibition, loneliness, and social phobia of being corpulent. Also, fears
associated with inadequacies of sexual life are found for
80% of the AN patients even if their initial stages of heterosexual development seemed normal [9]. Problems with
sexuality may trigger the onset of AN [10]. In tardive AN
(developing after the age 30), the feared sexuality emerged
as being of apparent etiological significance, much as it is
with earlier onset AN [11]. Therefore, elsewhere, AN was
represented as anticipatory anxiety of stoutness and frank
fat-phobia ('laparophobia') [12,13] mitigated by the efforts
to obtain alternative (non-appetitive) reward, such as
exemplified by the paradoxical euphoric state and hyperactivity,[14] symptoms of denial, lack of concern, and
alleged satisfaction with their state [15-17].

In theory, the acquisition of fear could be reduced to plasticity changes associated with Ca2+ influx through Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor channels in
response to environmentally or cognitively elicited alarm.
Ca2+ ions control a host of neuronal functions, such as
transmitter release, excitability and synaptic plasticity. In
laboratory environment, Ca2+ effects are reproduced by
repetitive input stimulation that elicits a long-lasting
increment of synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely known model of learning and
memory processes (e.g. in the hippocampus or amygdala), with which a great number of neurophysiologic
memory studies are performed. In many neuronal cells,
intracellular Ca2+ fluxes are increased during and after an
action potential that activate K+ channels thereby producing long-lasting changes of conductance and thus lasting
membrane hyperpolarization. Therefore, it is conceivable
that activity-dependent changes of excitability could be
achieved via nonsynaptic mechanisms. Mechanistically,
K+ channels are defined as the pore-forming primary
transmembrane proteins that initiate cellular polarization
by allowing K+ flux down a concentration gradient. Calcium-sensitive K+ conductances are known to play a major
role in the modulation of NMDA-induced bursting and
the spike afterhyperpolarization, so that dysfunctional K+
channels may contribute in the scenario of a wide range of
cognitive aberrations and AN ideation. Ultimately, the
process of learning and the strength of associations will be
determined by the intrinsic morphology and kinetics as

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/4/1/15

well as the density and distribution profile of ion channels
that are embedded in the same membrane of the dendrites and the cell body, which accommodate NMDA
receptors [18]. They play distinct physiological tasks from
fine tuning membrane excitability in response to sensory
input, modulating locomotion and emotional behavior
to the induction of synaptic plasticity entailed in memory
and cognition, temporally integrated with circadian cues,
as well as in the antinociceptive effect [19].
Three subtypes of slow Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels
(SK1, SK2, SK3) set off by submicromolar intracellular
Ca2+ concentrations have been cloned, which differed in
their pharmacology and kinetics [8,20-22]. One of the
interesting features of SK channels is that normally they
reduce neuronal excitability, whereas being blocked by
the peptidergic honeybee toxin, apamin, they robustly
augment neuronal excitability. In hippocampal CA1 neurons, SK channels contribute to the afterhyperpolarization, affecting neuronal excitability, regulating synaptic
plasticity and memory [23]. Using field potential recording in the CA1-region of rat hippocampal slices, Behnisch
et al. [24] showed that LTP induced by a single 100 Hz
tetanization was intensified by extracellular application of
apamin in a concentration range of 1–200 nM. These
changes in the sensitivity to apamin were hypothesized to
serve a marker of memory state and potentially, memory
disorders. In fact, intracerebroventricular injection of
apamin appears to improve retention of an odor pair association in rats [25]. Likewise, apamin increased neuronal
excitability and facilitated the induction of synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses and hippocampaldependent learning [26]. Mice treated with apamin demonstrated accelerated hippocampal-dependent spatial and
nonspatial memory encoding. They required fewer trials
to learn the location of a hidden platform in the Morris
water maze and less time to encode object memory in an
object-recognition task compared with saline-treated mice
[27]. Blank et al. [28] found recently that SK3 channel
transcript and protein were more abundant in hippocampi from aged mice (22–24 months) compared to hippocampi from young mice (4–6 months). They showed
that age-related decrement in trace fear conditioning (a
hippocampus-dependent learning task) is correlated with
elevated expression of SK channels of the SK3 type in the
hippocampus as well as with reduced LTP. The effect was
reversed when treated with SK3 antisense oligonucleotides. The authors further suggested that increased hippocampal expression of SK3 channels in aged mice may
represent a mechanism that contributes to age-dependent
decline in learning and memory and synaptic plasticity. In
the hippocampus, SK3 was found predominantly in the
terminal field of the mossy fibers and in fine varicose fibers, thereby suggesting their presynaptic localization.
Using high-resolution immunofluorescence analysis, one

study [18] found that the SK3 clusters were precisely colocalized with the presynaptic marker synapsin and at close
range (0.4–0.5 mum) from NMDA-receptors and PSD-95,
but rarely associated with GABAA-receptor clusters. This
arrangement is consistent with a view that SK3 is a presynaptic channel in excitatory hippocampal synapses, with
no preference for glutamatergic or GABAergic postsynaptic neurons, and is probably involved in regulating neurotransmitter release.
The responsibility of SK3 channels for the medium, and
possibly the slow components of an afterhyperpolarization current make them a candidate for dysregulation of
cellular homeostasis in a variety of systems. They are
abundantly present in brain regions implicated in AN,
such as the hypothalamus, [29] the limbic system [30]
and midbrain regions [31,32] The cardinal role of SK
channels in regulating burst firing and rhythmic oscillatory activity appears to be needed for coding for rewardrelated events by dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The
afterhyperpolarization in dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area neurons was shown to determine their sensitivity to
ethanol reward [33] and by extension, they could be as
responsive to some corporeal and extracorporeal rewards.
Perhaps, this mechanism may be relevant for locomotion
reward in hyperactive AN patients [14]. The Ca2+-dependent activation of K+ channels may be among other regulators of pacemaker activity of interneurons that govern the
quasi-periodic repetition of group activities and EEG synchronization. The excitability of fast-spiking prefrontal
interneurons may be regulated by dopamine via a voltageindependent 'leak' K+ current and an inwardly rectifying
K+ current, thereby modulating pyramidal cell excitability
[34]. It remains to be explored which neurons express
their distinct subsets of SK channel subunits in specific
areas and how they are related to changes of cellular functions translated to the diverse clinical features of AN along
its course and co-morbidities.
Somatic and cognitive aberrations: Two in one?
The literature is definitive about an increased risk of diseases in AN. However, whereas psychological and cognitive deficits are conceived of as a component of the AN
syndrome, somatic abnormalities are rather attributed to
self-imposed malnutrition than to general vulnerability
associated with AN [2]. Only infrequently are, cognitive
and somatic alterations discussed together albeit in the
context of a more specific shortage, such as caused by
insufficiency in poly-unsaturated fatty acids that could
cause also cognitive abnormalities [35]. Studies that
obtain retrospective histories of disorders that occur prior
to the age of onset of AN are uncommon, and are limited
to psychopathological findings [36]. Assuming that there
is a role for SK channels in AN, the question is what

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/4/1/15

somatic manifestations would parallel neuropsychiatric
abnormalities?
Medical comorbidity of AN
Of the three SK channels, SK1 and SK2 are predominantly
expressed in the nervous system, in cortical pyramidal
cells; [37] the basal ganglia and limbic system; [26,38,39]
dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons; [40] and supraoptic neurosecretory cells [41]. The SK3 protein is seen more
diffusely scattered. It is expressed primarily in phylogenetically older brain regions [42], and is also distributed in
some peripheral neurons as well as diverse bodily tissues
[8]. That wide distribution of SK channels and the fundamental role of K+ currents in controlling membrane excitability of diverse organ systems pose a question of their
role in regulation and dysregulation of the functional
state of bodily tissues, at least of ectodermal origin, concurrently with that of the central nervous system.

It is telling that AN is associated with an amazing rate of
cardiac abnormalities (in up to 86% of the patients) such
as electrocardiographic abnormalities, reduced left ventricular mass, a small heart on the chest X-ray, impaired
myocardial performance, and others.[43,44] Mitral valve
prolapse (MVP) is another common somatic signs of
AN.[45,46] Abnormality of the mitral apparatus may be
primary or more benign secondary that emerge as a consequence of reduced or abnormal ventricular dimensions
due to weight lost [47]. It is not always certain what form
of MVP are registered in AN. The possibility of primary
MVP abnormality cannot be ruled out since it may be
associated with some subtle generalized disorder coupled
with peculiar skeletal abnormalities (e.g. pectum excavatum, scoliosis, loss of normal kyphosis of the thoracic
spine), somewhat elongated arms and decreased breast
mass [48] The breast develops from the anlage of ectodermal cells along the primitive mammary ridges 'milk lines'
during the sixth week of gestation. Certain abnormalities
of the growing breast such as breast asymmetry (difference
of its form, position or volume), hypoplasia of one breast
are common finding in normal adolescents [49].
Cardiac arrhythmias and the lengthening of the QT interval are frequently associated with AN.[2] Recurrent syncope and sudden death typically occur in AN during
exercise or emotional upset, [50,51] so that it is more
likely to be attributed to metabolic aberrations associated
with malnutrition, dehydration, or hypoglycemia, or
socially-triggered emotional distress. The neurogenic
mechanisms are clearly implicated in many cases of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death in AN. Critchley et al.
[52] demonstrated the role of mental and physical stress
challenges in a group of 10 out-patients attending a cardiological clinic. Using H2(15)O PET, they obtained a robust
positive relationship between right-lateralized asymmetry

in midbrain activity and proarrhythmic abnormalities of
cardiac repolarization during stress. However, mental and
physical stress merely exposed the presence of enhanced
cardiac arrhythmic vulnerability such as deficient myocardial repolarization [53]. A greater risk for the development and recurrence of coronary heart disease in women
with psychiatric disorders such as depression, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder although commonly
attributed to psychosocial factors [54] might also be contributed by proarrhythmic state unmasked by psychosocial stressors. Mutations in genes encoding sodium or
potassium channels were shown to underlie the 'Long QT
syndrome,' causing arrhythmias [50,55]. It is a frequent
cause of syncope and unexpected death in children and
young adults, mostly women. Although the syndrome is
an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder of cardiac electrical repolarization, the QT interval at presentation is
normal about 10% of the time and just borderline prolonged in another 30%, so that premorbid vulnerability
may be difficult to establish, and it is hardly looked for as
a sign anticipating AN.
A remarkable aspect of the cardiomyocytes is their property for 'memory' of the signal transduction mechanisms
and cardiac repolarization. A case in point is a persistent
or 'remembered' T-wave on ECG during periods of the
previous abnormal QRS complex in the sequence of
altered ventricular pacing and manifested during sinus
rhythm. This repolarization contributed to by specific K+
channels [56,57] was provocatively labeled as "cardiac
memory" [58]. We do not know whether or not "memory" of somatic cells marks a problem that remains latent
in manner of 'functional teratogenesis' until triggered centrally (e.g. [52]). Nor do we know to what extent environmental stressors could unmask general SK channels
abnormalities of alveolar epithelial cells in the lung,
mesenteric and pulmonary arteries, vascular smooth muscles, genitourinary and gastrointestinal smooth muscle
cells. Alkon [59] not only set out the question, he also
came up with a theory that aberrant channels must represent a systemic disorder in Alzheimer's disease that
involves not just the brain but other tissues such as skin,
blood, and olfactory mucosa, as well. A change in channel
activity leading to a cataract brings together such distant
disorders as schizophrenia and myotonic dystrophy [60].
Both carry an increased risk of cataract, regardless of
whether it was due to abnormal gene expression or followed drug intervention.
The skin, including its specialized forms such as the retina
derives their origin from the same progenitors around the
third ventricle. Cutaneous and mucocutaneous changes
are well documented to be among the early diagnostic
pointers to AN. They include xerosis (71%), cheilitis
(76%), bodily hypertrichosis (62%), periungual erythema

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/4/1/15

(48%), gingival changes (37%), and nail changes (29%)
[61] along with the thinner body hair and abundant
pilosebaceous glands.[62,63] Some skin signs are part of
'vasospastic syndromes' with a range of manifestations
from cold intolerance, altered thermoregulation to physical stimuli or emotional stress to Raynaud's phenomenon, [64] the redness, itching, and burning of the skin,
particularly fingers, toes, heels, nose, and ears exposed to
cold known as perniosis [65,66]. Vasospasm could trigger
acute severe exacerbations due to thrombosis inasmuch as
the platelets obtained from patients with AN or severe
peripheral vascular disease appear to be hyperaggregable
[67].
The eye is frequently involved in the vasospastic syndrome, and ocular manifestations of microvascular dysfunction include alteration of conjunctival vessels,
corneal edema, retinal arterial and venous occlusions, and
others [66]. A high incidence of ocular involvement in the
form of episcleral capillary aneurysms and subconjunctival hemorrhages, reduced mean tear production, conjunctival squamous metaplasia [68] is another example of
vasospasm in AN. The pathophysiology of 'vasospastic
syndromes' is obscure. The failure of the endotheliumderived hyperpolarizing factor may be one of the players.
The latter is operationally defined as the hyperpolarization and associated relaxation remaining after the inhibition of the synthesis of NO synthase and prostaglandins
(ref. [69] for review) that is possibly another word for K+
channels [70].
Significant osteoporosis affects over half of all women
with AN [71,72]. Occasionally, fragile bones due to osteoporosis could lead even to fracture of ribs [73] and the
sternum [74]. The mechanisms of bone loss in this condition are poorly understood. Although a low estrogen level
is implicated, administration of estrogen alone has not
been shown to prevent bone loss. Grinspoon et al.[72]
hypothesized that administration of bone trophic hormone, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a nutritionally
dependent hormone [75] that stimulates osteoblast function and collagen synthesis would increase bone turnover
in young women with AN. They did obtain hypothesized
increased markers of bone turnover in severely osteopenic
women. However, IGF-1 may also be prenatally programmed. Infants whose mothers were exposed to peak
sunshine during their first trimester were born significantly heavier than infants whose mothers experienced
low levels of sunshine during the same period. Tustin et
al. [76] attributed facilitated prenatal growth to high levels of IGF-1 due to sunshine exposure during early gestation. Epidemiological studies suggest an association
between weight in infancy and skeletal size and the risk of
osteoporosis in adulthood. A significant association was

established between birth weight and adult bone mineral
content at the lumbar spine and femoral neck [77]
In sum, prospective studies of children at risk for AN are
missing to establish the presence of somatic anomalies
long before the onset of eating disorder. However, the
presence of the foregoing aberrations during intrauterine
life, though subtle, may be fated to affect adult health trajectories. Collectively, these changes were designated over
40 years ago as "reproductive casualty." [78] Nowadays,
the latter latent 'functional teratogenesis' is actively discussed as part of the "Barker hypothesis" that postulates
that a number of dysfunctions undergo programming
during embryonic and fetal life; that individuals with a
completely normal phenotype at birth, may acquire
diverse disorders in adolescence or adulthood [79-81].
Is calorie restriction all bad?
Many physicians encounter AN at the bedside, with the
syndrome comprised of gonadal failure (a low estrogen
state and amenorrhea), cardiovascular abnormalities,
osteopenia, thinning of skin and skeletal muscle wasting
that are typical of human aging. Therefore AN would be
expected to be a harbinger of the premature frailty,
increased susceptibility to aging-related disorders and
decreased longevity. As it happens, AN is not totally harmful and in special circumstances may even be beneficial.
The overall cancer incidence among women with AN
identified in the population-based Danish Psychiatric
Case Register during 1970–1993 was slightly reduced by a
factor of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.52–1.18) below
that of the general population.[82] In a sample of 7303
Swedish women hospitalized for AN prior to age 40 years
(the Swedish Registries from 1965 to1998) there was a
more robust decrease in breast cancer incidence compared
with the general female population of comparable age.
AN developing prior to the first birth followed by a subsequent pregnancy was associated with an even more pronounced reduction in risk [83].

How can this be? Although deficient transmembrane
potassium traffic in some cells is troubling, it appears to
be associated with an intriguing gain in having reduced
physiological and pathological proliferation capacity and
thus a diminished oncogenic potential [84]. A population-based retrospective cohort study of 208 Rochester
residents who were monitored for up to 63 years since
admission for AN found that long-term survival in AN
patients did not differ from that expected for the community [85]. We have yet to learn whether or not AN mitigates malignancies in tissues other than breasts that are
vulnerable to aging (e.g., colon, bladder) and reduces
neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders. The role of
caloric restriction in increasing longevity was repeatedly
demonstrated in laboratory animals and lower organisms.

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/4/1/15

Assuming that all essential nutrients are acquired, AN
might be conceived of as the cheapest investment into
defenses against infections and cancer, in general. However, AN-style starvation carries unacceptably high risk
when a wider range of outcome variables is considered
[86].
Side Effects of Anorectic Drugs: Pathophysiology Ex-Juvantibus
Using a preparation of isolated rat lungs, Belohlavkova
and colleagues [87] compared the inhibitory effect of
ritanserin, an antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors, on fenfluramine- and 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction. As expected,
both 5-HT and fenfluramine caused significant increases
in perfusion pressure. Ritanserin at a dose (10-7 mol/l)
inhibited >80% of the response to 5-HT and reduced the
response to fenfluramine by approximately 50%. A higher
ritanserin dose (10-5 mol/l) completely abolished the
responses to 5-HT but had no more inhibitory effect on
the responses to fenfluramine. However, a pharmacological blockade of voltage-gated K+ channel activity (by 4aminopyridine) markedly potentiated the pulmonary
vasoconstrictor response to fenfluramine but was without
effect on the reactivity to 5-HT. Clearly, the pulmonary
vasoconstrictor response to fenfluramine was only partly
mediated by 5-HT receptors, inasmuch as the vasoconstrictor potency of the drug was elevated when the K+channel activity was reduced or altered in transgenic (SK3T/T) mice [88]. Fenfluramine was widely employed for
the treatment of obesity and abandoned after it was
noticed to cause the development of valvular heart disease, hypertension, stroke and digital or mesenteric
ischemia [89-91]. Consequently, the possibility was entertained that some individuals may have had intrinsically
low activity of K+ channels ("channelopathy"), which, as
Belohlavkova and colleagues [87] hypothesized, was not
functionally obvious under usual conditions but may
have become exposed by anorectic drugs. Although their
findings suggest the presence of microvascular dysfunction of unknown origin the term channelopathy alludes to
a group of disorders that include, other than congenital
long QT syndrome mentioned above, also cyclic vomiting
syndrome, neuromyotonia, episodic ataxia, abdominal
migraine, and migraine headaches as well as many others
have been mapped to chromosomal regions that are rich
in ion channel genes [92-94]. This hunch, though highly
speculative encourages henceforth to explore, whether or
not AN shares some of its pathophysiology with channelopathies.
Is Anorexia a "Channelopathy"?
Aberrant channels emerge as a tempting, if rather speculative alternative to the notion of synaptic modulation deficit in AN. There are several requirements to suspect the
presence of anomalous channels in a given disorder:

Page 5 of 10

• Symptoms implicating specific ion channel genes
• The timing of disease onset or deterioration in childhood or adolescence
• Episodic character of manifestations

for the induction of synaptic plasticity, and facilitates
amygdala or hippocampus-dependent memory. On the
background of abnormal temporolimbic machinery such
changes of molecular plasticity may conceivably cause
hormonal effects to be exaggerated or idiosyncratic, which
would set a stage for phobias and obsessive-compulsive
symptoms [105].

• Involvement of more than one organ or system
Chandy et al. [95] found that the second (3-prime) CAG
repeat was highly polymorphic in control individuals,
with alleles ranging in size from 12 to 28 repeats. They
tested for an association between the longer alleles of SK3
and these neuropsychiatric disorders. There was a statistically significant overrepresentation of longer alleles in
schizophrenia patients and a similar albeit nonsignificant
trend in bipolar disorder patients, thereby suggesting that
mild variations in the length of the polyglutamine repeats
might produce subtle alterations in channel function, and
in neuronal behavior. Other groups [96,97], however, did
not confirm this finding. The most persuasive evidence
indicating an association between inherited disorders of
ion channels and AN is the discovery of the gene encoding
for the SK channel.[98,99] They support the assumption
of a common vulnerability for 'functional psychoses' that
may include AN.
Although infrequently (5%), AN may be associated with
epilepsy [100]. Epileptiform abnormalities in the EEG are
infrequently recorded in AN patients,[101] although their
rate is likely to be significantly underestimated since EEG
is not routinely examined in eating disorders. In early
comprehensive studies of EEG in behavioral disorders of
childhood, eating disorders were not even mentioned
[102]. However, the absence of clear indices of epileptiform abnormalities is not a critical violation of the channelopathy criteria. The notion of channelopathy may well
be expanded into the territory of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, [59,103] which is infrequently associated with epileptiform phenomena. On the
other hand, neurologic AN complications comprise the
majority of those consistent with the presence of channelopathies: neuromuscular abnormalities (45%); generalized muscle weakness (43%); peripheral neuropathies
(13%); headaches (6%); syncope (4%); diplopia (4%),
and movement disorders (2%). All these complications
have episodic character. Also, local cellular epileptiform
activity in the limbic system, such as plateau-bursting type
action potentials or global Ca2+ signal (typical for some
endocrine-cell-type), may be recorded with no overt manifestations of episodic behavioral disturbances. Thus, a
relative deficit of SK channels or even their genetically
engineered absence [104] may not yield overt phenotypic
outcome, as SK3 overexpression would [28]. Nonetheless,
it would subtly increase excitability, reduce the threshold

Cellular excitability changes may be also associated with a
coerced movement of water to maintain osmolarity during cellular activity [106]. Water is transported by the
aquaporins, a family of membrane proteins that function
as water channels in many tissues including neurons, glial
cells, astrocytic foot processes near or in direct contact
with blood vessels and others. Therefore, a loss of K+
homeostasis in the presence of sustained neuronal activation may follow that of aberrant water fluxes. The mechanism underlying the functional coupling between water
transport and K+ has yet to be elucidated. It was noticed,
however, that a lasting compromise of cell volume constancy could contribute to a buildup of K+ in the extracellular space and ultimately, set a stage leading to a
chronically enhanced excitability and even epileptogenicity [107,108].
One might further posit that estrogen represents additional factor modulating excitatory neurotransmission
(apparently via NMDA/AMPA receptors) in the hippocampus [109] Using whole-cell recordings in hypothalamic slices from ovariectomized female guinea pigs, Kelly
et al. [110] showed that estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2)
robustly augments the efficacy of α1-adrenergic receptor
agonists in inhibiting SK currents in preoptic GABAergic
neurons. An association between susceptibility for eating
disorders and the gene encoding for β-estrogen receptor
[99] suggests that a specific group of individuals would
have increased AN severity specifically related to changes
in hormonal profile. In sum, the notion of AN as a channelopathy is in keeping with the following characteristics
of the disorder: its early onset, genetic liability as well as
episodic somatic disorders such as cardiac and autonomic
abnormalities. As is shown below, the efficacy of some
antiepileptic drugs is apparently also consistent with this
hypothesis.
Epilogue
The physiological and pathophysiological effects of K+
channels on cerebral and extracerebral functions are
numerous. Their role suggests a paradigm of "channelopathy" that articulated a way of simplifying and explaining
otherwise seemingly unrelated somatic and neuropsychological findings in AN. If we are to understand the pathophysiology of the disorder, knowledge of the triggers of
instabilities in ion fluxes in specially designed prospective
studies may be mandatory.

The major limitation of researching the problem is in the
populations selected because of multiple AN phenotypes.
All patients entered in the studies cited above are either
referred for their severe dieting or somatic manifestations
consequent to it; many of them are interesting cases
reported for their unusual presentation, such as nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, electrolyte disturbances, sleep
disorders, orthostasis and others [111,112].

The basis for choosing a conceptual model of AN, other
than its simplicity, is the capacity of the model to provide
a common denominator, for both psychopathological
profiles and somatic manifestations of the disorder as well
as to suggest therapeutic choices. SK3 channels may be
potential therapeutic targets for regulating brain excitability as well as alleviating somatic disorders associated with
AN. Several selective ligands are already being explored
for their ability to block SK channel or facilitate SK channel
opening
[21,113].
Somewhat
facetiously,
Iversen[114] admonished that "on average it takes around
30 years for a new scientific discovery to find its way to a
new generally available therapy" (p. 1539). Although new
technologies may greatly facilitate the progress of identifying potential therapeutic targets, some caution need to
be exercised [115]. The "thirty year rule" may still apply in
the area of ion channel biophysics. With this in mind, the
presence of abnormal neuronal excitability in AN,
behooves the research clinicians to the fact that achieving
membrane stabilization, reducing action-potential firing,
and controlling Ca2+ fluxes in the neural and non-neural
tissues can be accomplished by using drugs activating a
GABAA receptor complex that results in opening of the Clchannel and influx of Cl- ions thereby leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membranes. However, studies
on GABAA-mediated inhibition in eating behaviors have
yielded both orexigenic and anorexic effects depending on
drug used. Another anticonvulsant to consider is ketamine [116]. In patients with a long history of eating disorder that were resistant to several forms of treatment, Mills
and colleagues [117] attempted infusions of 20 mg per
hour ketamine for 10 h along with 20 mg twice daily
nalmefene as opioid antagonist. Nine of 15 patients
examined in the study showed prolonged remission when
treated with two to nine ketamine-infusion sessions at
intervals of 5 days to 3 weeks. Admittedly, ketamine has
limited therapeutic potential because of its adverse psychotomimetic side-effects. In this regard, memantine (1amino-3, 5-dimethyl-adamantane), an uncompetitive
NMDA receptor antagonist may be a better alternative by
producing symptomatological improvement under conditions of tonic NMDA receptor activation. Preclinical
studies showed that memantine can reduce the behavioral
deficits produced by chronic stress [118] and enhance
antidepressive effects of fluoxetine given in subtherapeutic doses [119].
