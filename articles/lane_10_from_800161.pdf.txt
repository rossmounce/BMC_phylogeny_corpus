IMGT® standardized approach for immunoglobulin
and T cell receptor gene identification and
description in large genomic sequences

Abstract
Background: The antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TR), are specific molecular
components of the adaptive immune response of vertebrates. Their genes are organized in the genome in several loci
(7 in humans) that comprise different gene types: variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) genes. Synthesis
of the IG and TR proteins requires rearrangements of V and J, or V, D and J genes at the DNA level, followed by the
splicing at the RNA level of the rearranged V-J and V-D-J genes to C genes. Owing to the particularities of IG and TR
gene structures related to these molecular mechanisms, conventional bioinformatic software and tools are not
adapted to the identification and description of IG and TR genes in large genomic sequences. In order to answer that
need, IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has developed IMGT/LIGMotif, a tool for IG and
TR gene annotation. This tool is based on standardized rules defined in IMGT-ONTOLOGY, the first ontology in
immunogenetics and immunoinformatics.
Results: IMGT/LIGMotif currently annotates human and mouse IG and TR loci in large genomic sequences. The
annotation includes gene identification and orientation on DNA strand, description of the V, D and J genes by
assigning IMGT® labels, gene functionality, and finally, gene delimitation and cluster assembly. IMGT/LIGMotif analyses
sequences up to 2.5 megabase pairs and can analyse them in batch files.
Conclusions: IMGT/LIGMotif is currently used by the IMGT® biocurators to annotate, in a first step, IG and TR genomic
sequences of human and mouse in new haplotypes and those of closely related species, nonhuman primates and rat,
respectively. In a next step, and following enrichment of its reference databases, IMGT/LIGMotif will be used to
annotate IG and TR of more distantly related vertebrate species. IMGT/LIGMotif is available at http://www.imgt.org/
ligmotif/.
Background
The immune adaptive system defends multicellular
organisms from pathogens (i.e. bacteria, parasites,
viruses) and tumor cells which are specifically recognized
by antigen receptors. These antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies [1] and T cell receptors (TR)
[2], present a huge diversity (2.1012 IG and 2.1012 TR per

individual) that is crucial for specific antigen recognition.
These huge numbers of different proteins are encoded by
a relatively limited number of genes organized in the
genome in different loci (7 in humans) that comprise different types of gene: variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J)
and constant (C) genes. Synthesis of the IG and TR proteins requires complex mechanisms that include, at the
DNA level, rearrangements of V and J, or of V, D and J
genes [3], N-Diversity at the resulting V-J and V-D-J junctions [4,5] and, for the IG, somatic hypermutations [6,7].
These rearrangements are followed, at the RNA level, by
the splicing of rearranged V-J and V-D-J genes to a C

gene. In order to manage IG and TR data, IMGT®, the
international ImMunoGeneTics information system®,
http://www.imgt.org/[8] was created in 1989, by the Laboratoire d'ImmunoGénétique Moléculaire LIGM (Université Montpellier 2 and CNRS). One of the first goals of
IMGT® was to identify and to describe all the human IG
and TR genes present in the human genome, an indispensable requisite before analysing the immune repertoire. Owing to the particularities of the IG and TR gene
structures, IMGT-ONTOLOGY [9-11], the first ontology
for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics, has been
built to ensure the accuracy and the consistency of the
IMGT® data, as well as the coherence between the IMGT®
databases, tools and Web resources [12]. Several years of
expert and time consuming manual curation led to the
IMGT® gene nomenclature for IG and TR genes [1,2]
which was approved by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) in
1999 [13] and by the World Health Organization-International Union of Immunological Societies (WHO-IUIS)
[14,15]. IMGT® IG and TR genes have been entered in
IMGT/GENE-DB [16], the IMGT® gene database, in the
Human Genome Database (GDB) [17], in LocusLink [18]
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI), in Entrez Gene [19] when this database superseded LocusLink, in Ensembl [20] at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and in the Vega Genome
Browser [21] at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
Interestingly, the human IG and TR genes data were
annotated in IMGT® [1,2] before the release of the human
genome sequence [22,23], however most of the corresponding genomic sequences were short (1-2 kb) and
large contigs still remain to be precisely annotated. Conventional software and tools such as GeneMark [24],
Genescan [25] and N-SCAN [26], are not adapted to the
annotation of IG and TR genes owing to the particularities of their structure. Prediction of immunoglobulin
superfamily protein genes with Exegesis [27], a procedure
which uses GeneWise [28] and experimental maps,
showed improvement by comparison with the Ensembl
method. However, this procedure has not been developed
for detailed and standardized annotation. To answer the
need of a tool for an automated annotation of antigen
receptors in genomic DNA and, thus, to avoid several
manual and time consuming steps, IMGT/LIGMotif, a
Java on-line software has been developed, that allows the
identification, standardized description and functionality
assignment of IG and TR V, D and J genes in large
genomic sequences.

Methods
IG and TR gene characteristics to consider for gene
identification

IG and TR V, D and J genes belong to multigene subgroups and, therefore, share a high percentage of

Page 2 of 16

sequence identity (>75%) as a result of gene duplications
inside a given subgroup [1,2]. As a consequence it is often
difficult to assign nearly identical sequences either to different genes or to different alleles of a same gene. This
can lead to possible errors in the genome assembly that
need to be detected.
IG and TR loci contain several hundreds of genes, 608665 IG and TR genes per haploid genome in human,
depending on the haplotypes, and more than 800 IG and
TR genes in mouse [16], these numbers including many
pseudogenes (227-253 in human and 212-240 in mouse).
Many of these pseudogenes are degenerated and/or partial genes and, therefore difficult to annotate. Another
level of complexity results from gene insertion and/or
deletion polymorphisms that are frequent in multigene
families. As the genome assembly results from joined
DNA fragments from different haplotypes, and from one
or the other chromosome, it does not reflect a 'true' haplotype and a careful analysis is required for the gene and
allele assignment. It should also be noted that some IG
and TR genes, designated as orphons are localized outside the main loci [1,2]. Although these orphons are not
functional, they have a high percentage of identity with
genes of the major loci and represent another source of
possible confusion and errors in gene and allele identification. At last, D and J genes have very small coding
regions (8-37 base pairs (bp) and 37-69 bp, respectively)
making their identification difficult.
Interestingly, and despite the difficulties mentioned
above, functional IG and TR genes have characteristics
that, if present, allow their unambiguous identification.
Thus, for example, IG and TR V genes comprise two
exons, a L-PART1 (L for leader) exon and a V-EXON with
a splicing frame of type 1 (sf1) (IMGT Aide-mémoire,
http://www.imgt.org/). The IG and TR V, D and J genes
have recombination signals (RS) which allow them to
rearrange at the DNA level in B cells (for the IG) and T
cells (for the TR) [1,2] and that constitute one of the
major differences with conventional genes. RS are localized in 3' of the V genes (V-RS), in 5' of the J genes (J-RS)
and on both sides of the D genes (5'D-RS and 3'D-RS)
[1,2]. They consist of conserved heptamers and nonamers
separated by less conserved spacers of 12 ± 1 or 23 ± 1 bp
which vary between loci and species (IMGT Repertoire,
http://www.imgt.org/). An efficient recombination only
occurs between a RS with a 12 bp spacer and a RS with a
23 bp spacer (12/23 rule) [29].
In IMGT®, the IG and TR gene characteristics used for
gene identification are defined by concepts generated
from the IMGT-ONTOLOGY 'IDENTIFICATION'
axiom [9-11]. Three concept instances of the
'Molecule_EntityType' concept of identification are used
in the IMGT/LIGMotif model: V-gene, D-gene and Jgene. These concept instances are defined by the gene

Lane et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:223

type (variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J)), the molecule
type (gDNA) and the configuration type (germline) [11].
IG and TR gene characteristics for standardized gene
description
Prototypes and labels

The IG and TR gene features are described, in IMGT®,
according to the standardized concepts of description
generated from the IMGT-ONTOLOGY 'DESCRIPTION' axiom [9-11]. Thus, the V-gene, D-gene and Jgene are described by three concept instances of the
'Molecule_EntityPrototype' concept of description: VGENE, D-GENE and J-GENE [11], respectively. Their
graphical representation, or prototype, and the labels that
describe them are shown in Figure 1 (A and B, respectively). Among the 242 IMGT® labels defined for the
nucleotide sequences, 47 are used in the IMGT/LIGMotif
model (Figure 1B) of which 43 are specific of one prototype (23 for a V-GENE, 11 for a D-GENE and 9 for JGENE). Two labels (5'UTR and 3'UTR) are common to all
prototypes, whereas 2 labels (ACCEPTOR-SPLICE and
DONOR-SPLICE) are shared by several IMGT-ONTOLOGY prototypes (shown with a black circle in Figure 1B).
The organization of a prototype is based on the relations that order two labels [11]. Interestingly, a set of
twelve relations is necessary and sufficient to describe the
relations between labels in a prototype (Table 1). Ten of
these relations were defined previously [9-11]. Two reciprocal relations, 'is_in_5_prime_of' and 'is_in_3_prime_of'
have been added in the IMGT/LIGMotif model to indicate the relative position of labels on a 5'-3' DNA strand
when there is no intersection between labels (Table 1).
Patterns

For the purpose of gene description, IMGT/LIGMotif
uses the 'gene unit' labels L-V-GENE-UNIT, D-GENEUNIT and J-GENE-UNIT (Figure 1A). Indeed, these
labels, in contrast to the 'gene' labels (V-GENE, D-GENE
and J-GENE) have the advantage to be precisely delimitated in 5' and 3', respectively, by the 5' end and 3' end of
constitutive labels (L-PART1 and V-RS for V, 5'D-RS and
3'D-RS for D, and J-RS and J-REGION for J, respectively).
Moreover, the part of the prototype they encompass can
be defined by conserved motifs that constitute a pattern
(Figure 1A). In a pattern, the conserved motifs are separated from each other by a distance in base pairs (bp)
comprised between a minimal and a maximal length
(between braces in Figure 1A). Motifs are ordered from 5'
to 3' with a rank (in a circle in Figure 1A) that corresponds to their relative localization in the pattern, the
motif the most in 3' having a rank that corresponds to the
number of motifs in the pattern (that is 8 for V, 4 for D
and 4 for J). In the J pattern, the motifs J-TRP and J-PHE
are shown between brackets and separated with a coma

Page 3 of 16

to indicate that the two motifs are possible for the same
rank.
These conserved amino acids J-TRP and J-PHE are part
of a conserved motif '[W, F]-[G, A]-X-G' where W = tryptophan (J-TRP), F = phenylalanine (J-PHE), G = glycine,
A = alanine and X = any amino acid except proline.
IG and TR gene characteristics for functionality
identification

The gene functionality identification can only be assigned
to precisely described IG and TR genes. In IMGTONTOLOGY, an unrearranged genomic V, D or J gene
can be functional (F), open reading frame (ORF) or
pseudogene (P) [9]. A gene is qualified as 'functional' if
the coding region has an open reading frame without stop
codon, and if there is no described defect in the splicing
sites, recombination signals and/or regulatory elements.
A gene is qualified as 'ORF' if the coding region has an
open reading frame, but alterations have been described
in the splicing sites, recombination signals and/or regulatory elements and/or changes of conserved amino acids
have been suggested by the authors to lead to uncorrect
folding, and/or the entity is an orphon. A gene is qualified
as 'pseudogene' if the coding region has stop codon(s)
and/or frameshift mutation(s). In particular, a V-GENE
(or V-GENE-UNIT) is considered as 'pseudogene' if these
defects occur in the L-PART1 and/or V-EXON, or if there
is a mutation in the L-PART1 INIT-CODON atg. A JGENE (or J-GENE-UNIT) is considered as 'pseudogene' if
it has been identified by the presence of a RS upstream of
an open reading frame, but it has no donor splice site in 5'
or the donor splice is not in the expected splicing frame
sf1 or if it has no conserved '[W, F]-[G, A]-X-G' motif.
Characteristics for gene delimitation and cluster assembly

The IMGT® rule to delimit V-GENE, D-GENE and JGENE instances is to equally distribute the distance
between the two genes. The IMGT-ONTOLOGY
'GeneCluster' concept allows describing genomic
sequences that contain several genes. The gene instances
in a cluster can be of the same prototype (for example, a
V-CLUSTER only contains V genes), or of different prototypes (for example, a V-D-J-CLUSTER contains at least
one V gene, one D gene and one J gene). Seven instances
of the 'GeneCluster' concept are used in the IMGT/LIGMotif model (Table 2). The IMGT-ONTOLOGY
'GeneCluster' instances are particularly useful for the
annotation of the large scale genomic IG and TR loci and
are also used by the Sequence Ontology (SO) [30] (Table
2).
IMGT/LIGMotif model

The IMGT/LIGMotif model comprises 4 modules (Figure 2), 3 of them ('Gene identification', 'Gene description'

and 'Functionality identification') take into account the
IG and TR gene characteristics as defined above and deal
with individual gene units, whereas the fourth module
('Gene delimitation and cluster assembly') deals with gene
delimitation and assembly of genes in a cluster, and provides an annotated genomic sequence.
Gene identification

The 'Gene identification' module identifies potential V, D
and J genes along the genomic sequence to analyse. First,
a heuristic search for local alignments is performed
against IMGT/LIGMotif reference motif databases (Table
3). These databases comprise nucleotide sequences that
correspond to IG and TR gene unit labels (L-V-GENE-

Page 5 of 16

UNIT, D-GENE-UNIT, J-GENE-UNIT) and to motifs
that compose them. These databases are created dynamically from IMGT/LIGM-DB [31] sequences, using the
IMGT/GENE-DB [16] interface that allows queries on
labels. Thirty-four labels were queried corresponding to
IG and TR sequences from human (Homo sapiens) and
mouse (Mus musculus; few sequences were also included
from Mus pahari, Mus saxicola, Mus spretus). Pseudogene genes too poorly conserved to be assigned to subgroups were excluded. The alignments obtained in this
first step provide labelled high-scoring segment pairs (or
HSPs) on both DNA strands of the sequence to analyse.
Then, there is a selection of the labelled HSPs and a
grouping of these selected HSPs given their topology and
their gene type (V, D or J). Thus, the 'Gene identification'
module provides the potential V genes, D genes and J
genes identified as grouped and labelled HSPs along the
sequence to analyse.
Gene description

The 'Gene description' module provides the description
of each potential gene identified in the first module. It
comprises a search of conserved motifs based on prototypes and patterns. Codons of conserved amino acids in
the patterns ('tgg' for CONSERVED-TRP and J-TRP, 'tgc'
and 'tgt' for 1st-CYS and 2nd-CYS, and 'ttt' and 'ttc' for JPHE) are difficult to identify by conventional algorithms
as the motifs (triplets 'tgg', 'tgc', 'tgt', 'ttt' and 'ttc') are very
frequent in sequences. For that reason, the codons of

Figure 2 IMGT/LIGMotif model overview. The 4 modules IMGT/LIGMotif comprise 'Gene identification', 'Gene description', 'Functionality identification' and 'Gene delimitation and cluster assembly'. Dots indicate partially described and undescribed outputs (for V, D and J) of the 'gene description' module that are entered, for complete analysis of the sequence to analyse, in the last module.

conserved amino acids of the V-REGION and V-EXON
(that comprise 1st-CYS, CONSERVED-TRP and 2ndCYS) are identified by the software IMGT/V-QUEST
[32]. The expected outputs of the 'Gene description'
module are described as gene units (GENE-UNIT),
although, as discussed in the algorithm section, partially
described and undescribed outputs can also be obtained.
Functionality identification

The 'Functionality identification' module includes the
control of features needed for the functionality assignment and allows to obtain annotated gene units.
Gene delimitation and cluster assembly

In this final module, genes (V-GENE, D-GENE and JGENE) are delimited and assembled in a cluster if the

analysed genomic sequence contains several genes. The
final outcome of IMGT/LIGMotif is the annotated
genomic sequence.

Algorithm
Gene identification of V, D and J genes
Search of labelled alignments

The algorithm starts by aligning the genomic sequence
using BLASTN [33] against IMGT/LIGMotif reference
motif databases (Table 3, Figure 3). The possibility is
given to the biocurator to select databases on species
(human and/or mouse), locus (IGH, IGK, IGL, TRA,
TRB, TRG and/or TRD), gene type (V, D and/or J), functionality (F, ORF and/or P), and to choose any combina-

and 'Identified J gene'. Each gene is identified by group of labelled HSPs selected on their BLAST parameters.

tion in this selection. IMGT/BLAST provides HSPs that
inform on the similarity of the analysed sequence (query)
with labelled motifs from the reference database (subject). These labelled HSPs are obtained on both DNA
strands of the sequence to analyse. Practically, NCBIBLASTN (version 2.2.18) is used with the minimum hit
word size possible (i.e. 4), an E-value threshold of 0.01
(except for D-GENE-UNIT and its motifs where an Evalue threshold of 5 is selected owing to their very short
length). The BLAST was preferred to Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) methods and software such as HMMER
[34,35] for practical uses.
Selection of labelled HSPs

IMGT/BLAST produces a huge quantity of HSPs but
these HSPs do not have the same importance. HSPs
obtained with different reference motif databases may
overlap at a same location as they are expected components of a same prototype (e.g. V-EXON overlaps VREGION). These overlapping HSPs do not need to be filtered as they delimit different and expected labels. In
contrast, and owing to gene duplications in IG and TR
loci, different HSPs obtained with a same reference motif
database may overlap at a same location although they
might belong to different genes. In consequence, the best
HSPs are selected at a given location (Figure 3) on score,
E-value, length and identity BLAST parameters. The
method to filter overlapping HSPs obtained with the
same motif database is described as follows: score(),

length(), identity(), evalue() are the functions that return
1 if a given HSP (hsp1) performs better than the other
(hsp2) for the tested parameter (higher score, length,
identity, and lower E-value), 0 if the two HSPs are equal
and -1 if hsp1 performs less well than hsp2. Parameter g1
(sum of score() and evalue(), with -2 ≤ g1 ≤ 2) and parameter g2 (sum of length() and identity(), with -2 ≤ g2 ≤ 2)
are calculated between each two overlapping HSPs
obtained from the same motif database. If g1 > 0, or if g1
= 0 and g2 > 0, hsp2 is removed. In other cases (g1 < 0, or
g1 = 0 and g2 < 0), hsp1 is removed.
Grouping of selected HSPs in V, D or J gene

The objective of this step is to group selected HSPs that
may belong to a same gene (Figure 3). For that purpose,
the positions of selected HSPs from the same DNA strand
and with labels of the same gene type (V, D or J) are, in
this step, compared to each other (Figure 4). If the topological relation of two compared HSPs is not coherent
they are considered as belonging to distinct genes. If the
topological relation is coherent, a length specific for each
label (Table 4), is added to 5' and/or 3' extremities of each
compared HSPs (Figure 4) and these new regions are
looked for a potential position overlap. If a position overlap is found, the two HSPs are considered as belonging to
the same gene. If not, the two HSPs are considered as
belonging to different genes. For a given HSP group, the
position most in 5' and the position most in 3' define the
area that contains a potential gene (shown as arrows in

Figure 4). The labelled HSPs that constitute that group
provide the gene type (V, D or J) and, using their respective localization on the DNA strands, the gene orientation. Each group of HSPs corresponds to a potential gene
identified along the sequence (indicated with V1 to Vn, D1
to Dn and J1 to Jn in Figure 3).
Gene description of L-V-GENE-UNIT, D-GENE-UNIT and JGENE-UNIT

The second module of IMGT/LIGMotif, 'Gene description', describes in detail each identified gene, individually
(Figure 5). This analysis is performed from 5' to 3', exploring both strands. IMGT/LIGMotif starts by searching
conserved motifs of the patterns described in Figure 1A.
The gene description is performed by searching and
delimiting conserved motifs that are characteristic of
each gene type (V, D and J).



 

Delimitation of conserved motif searching areas (CMSA)

In order to reduce the algorithm execution time the
search of conserved motifs is limited to conserved motif
searching areas (or CMSA) which are delimited by the
positions of the most informative combination in each
grouped HSP. The best combination of HSPs depends on
the gene type (Table 5): for instance, for a V gene the best
combination is L-PART1+V-EXON+V-RS, for a D gene,
it is 5'D-RS + 3'D-RS, whereas for a J gene, it is J-RS + JREGION. If the best combination is not present, other
combinations are explored in the order shown in Table 5.
A length is added to extremities (5' and/or 3') of the labels
belonging to an HSP combination to delimit the CMSA
(Table 6). For example, a length of 40 nt (the maximum
length of a RS) is added to the 5' and 3' position ends of a
RS HSP.

rectangles in grey represent the length added in 5' and or 3' of the selected HSPs. A search of position overlaps with the other selected and extended
HSPs allowed the grouping. Arrows indicate the gene orientation relative to the DNA strand, as deduced by the algorithm by the respective positions
of the labelled HSPs. Note that the labels at this stage refer to labelled HSPs and gene identification, and not to a detailed description of the genes.

Figure 5 IMGT/LIGMotif 'Gene description' module. The output of the 'Gene description' module is a 'Described V-GENE-UNIT' (A), 'Described DGENE-UNIT' (B) or 'Described J-GENE-UNIT' (C). The delimitation of conserved motif searching areas (CMSA) is described in the text. At least two conserved motifs need to be found. If not, the output is 'V undescribed', 'D undescribed' and 'J undescribed'. The absence of V-EXON for a V gene leads
to a 'V partially described'. The delimitation of motifs using conserved motifs as anchors is shown in Figure 6.

The underlined combinations are those used in priority. If not present, the combinations below in the columns are chosen in the order from
top to bottom.
(1) D-REGION is not used even if it is identified because 5'D-RS and 3'D-RS are sufficient for its precise delimitation, as well as those of the
heptamers and nonamers.
(2) As L-PART1 is missing, its motifs (INIT-CODON and DONOR-SPLICE) are not delimited.

Search of conserved motifs in CMSA

Delimitation of motifs using conserved motifs as anchors

Conserved motifs that include conserved amino acids
(INIT-CODON for V, J-TRP and J-PHE for J), splicing
sites (DONOR-SPLICE, ACCEPTOR-SPLICE), heptamers and nonamers are searched in the CMSA which are
known to include them. Heptamers and nonamers are
searched by alignment with the reference motif databases. If no exact match is found, an approximate form of
the motifs is searched using non gapped position-specific
scoring matrices (PSSM) [36]. Following the search of
conserved motifs in CMSA, matches are grouped and
retained as a set named 'solution' if the distances between
the motifs are in the intervals defined for the pattern. A
minimum of two conserved motifs is required to retain
the solution. If this condition is not fulfilled, genes cannot
be described using IMGT/LIGMotif and, thus, are
defined as 'V undescribed', 'D undescribed' and 'J undescribed' (Figure 5).

In the next step, other motifs of the patterns are then
delimited precisely using conserved motifs as anchors (or
seeds) (Figure 6). Arrows taking root from anchors
delimit precisely new labelled motifs. For instance,
ACCEPTOR-SPLICE and V-HEPTAMER (conserved
motifs) allow delimiting V-EXON. An arrow arriving
from the left delimits the 5' end of a motif whereas an
arrow arriving from the right delimits the 3' end. The
number associated to an arrow indicates the number of
nucleotides which must be added (+) or subtracted (-) to
a conserved motif position to delimit precisely the new
labelled motif. The J-PHE and J-TRP are the only conserved motifs that do not delimit labelled motifs, and
consequently, no arrow takes root from them.

Additional steps for the description of a L-V-GENE-UNIT

The description of a L-V-GENE-UNIT requires two additional steps. The first one is the delimitation of the VREGION with its constitutive regions (FR-IMGT and
CDR-IMGT) and conserved motifs (1st-CYS, CONSERVED-TRP and 2nd-CYS) using IMGT/V-QUEST
[32]. This step is only be performed if a V-EXON has
been identified. If V-EXON is missing the gene is defined
as 'V partially described'. The final step for the description of a L-V-GENE-UNIT is the delimitation of LPART2, a region delimited by the V-EXON acceptor
splice and the 5' end of the V-REGION determined by
IMGT/V-QUEST.

The third module of IMGT/LIGMotif 'Functionality

described gene unit (Figure 7). A L-V-GENE-UNIT is
identified as functional if it has all the 22 specific labels
and expected splicing sites (2 labels), no stop codons in LPART1 and V-EXON, a splicing frame sf1 between LPART1 and V-EXON, no frameshift (same reading frame
for 1st-CYS, CONSERVED-TRP and 2nd-CYS), an
expected V-SPACER length, and V-HEPTAMER and V-

Figure 6 Delimitation of motifs using conserved motifs as anchors. The delimitation of motifs using conserved motifs as anchors is used for the
description of a V-GENE-UNIT (A), D-GENE-UNIT (B) and J-GENE-UNIT (C). This approach is necessary and sufficient for the description of a D-GENE-UNIT
or that of a J-GENE-UNIT. The description of a V-GENE-UNIT requires two additional steps: the delimitation of the V-REGION and of its constitutive regions and conserved motifs by IMGT/V-QUEST [32], and the delimitation of L-PART2.

NONAMER identical to ones found in functional genes
(Figure 7A). A J-GENE-UNIT is identified as functional if
it has all the 7 specific labels and expected splicing site (1
label), no stop codons in J-REGION, a sf1 donor splice,
the conserved '[W, F]-[G, A]-X-G' motif as one indicator
of the absence of frameshift, an expected J-SPACER
length, and J-NONAMER and J-HEPTAMER identical to
ones found in functional genes (Figure 7B). A D-GENEUNIT is identified as functional if it has all the 10 specific
labels, at least one open reading frame without stop
codon(s), expected 5'D-SPACER and 3'D-SPACER
lengths, and the heptamers and nonamers are identical to
ones found in functional genes (Figure 7C). A gene unit is

identified as an open reading frame (ORF) if the last 3 criteria for V and J and the last 2 for D are not fulfilled. In
other cases the gene unit is identified as a pseudogene (P).
Note that if the first criterion (number of specific labels
and splicing sites) is not fulfilled, the functionality is
'Unknown' as it cannot be determined automatically and
its identification therefore requires a manual expertise.
Gene delimitation and cluster assembly

For each gene unit, and whatever its description status
(that is either annotated (L-V-GENE-UNIT, D-GENEUNIT, J-GENE-UNIT), partially described ('V partially
described') or undescribed ('V undescribed', 'D undescribed', 'J undescribed')), the 5'UTR and 3'UTR delimita-

Figure 7 Functionality identification. The output of the 'Functionality identification' module is 'Annotated L-V-GENE-UNIT' (A), 'Annotated J-GENEUNIT' (B) and 'Annotated D-GENE-UNIT' (C). The identification of the functionality is 'Functional', 'ORF' and 'Pseudogene'. If the first criterion is not fulfilled, the functionality is 'Unknown' as it cannot be identified automatically. In the figure, heptamers and nonamers are quoted from 5' to 3' relative
to gene units.

tions of the corresponding V-GENE, D-GENE or J-GENE
are determined by equally distributing the distance
between two neighbouring gene units. Thus, the
sequence can be considered as a succession of genes that
constitute a cluster. The cluster is defined based on the
'Molecule_EntityPrototype' instances found in the
sequence and an IMGT® cluster label is assigned (Table 2),
for instance V-D-J-CLUSTER, if the sequence contains at
least one V-GENE, one D-GENE and one J-GENE.
Finally, the number of genes in the analysed sequence is

computed per DNA strand, per gene type and per functionality.

Results and Discussion
IMGT/LIGMotif algorithm is implemented in JAVA
http://www.java.com/fr/. A web application of IMGT/
LIGMotif is running on a Tomcat server http://tomcat.apache.org/ and is available at http://www.imgt.org/
ligmotif/. The genomic sequence to analyse can be copied/pasted by the biocurators, or uploaded in Fasta or
EMBL format. Query parameters can be modified to

of the DNA sequence (from top to bottom of the table). Three genes were selected to display their labels: a V-GENE-UNIT (N° 2, a D-GENE-UNIT (N° 58)
and a J-GENE-UNIT (N° 59). B. Display of labels for the genes selected in the main table.

optimise the analysis efficiency. For instance, reference
motif databases can be selected on their gene type, locus,
functionality and organism. The execution time depends
on the gene types and the number of genes existing in the
sequence. The analysis of a single gene takes a few seconds whereas a complete locus containing more than 100
genes takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour, using standard
parameters. The IMGT/LIGMotif results page (Figure 8)
displays, at the top of the page, statistics that include the
execution time, the length of the analysed sequence, the
total number of genes per DNA strand (plus or minus),
and two tables: the first one indicates the number of
genes per description status (GENE-UNIT, Partially
described, Undescribed) and per gene type, the second
table indicates the number of annotated GENE UNIT per
functionality status (Functional, ORF, Pseudogene,
Unknown). Below the statistics, the main table displays
the content of the analysed sequence, starting from N° 1
(in column 1) for the gene the most in 5'. This table provides, for each identified gene: Description (GENE-UNIT
label or description status), Positions (in the analysed
sequence), DNA strand, Functionality and Number of
labels. Selecting gene units in the main table (Figure 8A)
allows displaying their labels with positions, nucleotide
sequences and, for coding regions, amino acid sequences
(Figure 8B). In the detailed display, labels of each gene
unit are ordered from 5' to 3'. If two labels start at the
same 5' position, the label with the longest nucleotide
length is displayed first. The IMGT/LIGMotif results can
be exported to a spreadsheet file that can be modified at
will. IMGT/LIGMotif results for the 684,973 bp sequence
of the human TRB locus (L36092 of IMGT/LIGM-DB
[31]) identified 83 gene units (67 V, 2 D and 14 J) (Figure
8). Compared with manual expert annotation, these
results show that all gene units were correctly identified.
No gene was missing and there was no false positive. The
functionality is more difficult to assign, which is reflected
in the IMGT/LIGMotif results. Functionality could be
assigned to 64 gene units: 56 genes (41 V, 2D and 13 J)
were determined as functional, 3 as ORF and 5 as
pseudogenes. Indeed, the functionality identification by
IMGT/LIGMotif requires that a gene unit be fully
described with all its labels. Most mutated pseudogenes
have missing labels therefore preventing the functionality
assignment. Another limitation is the lack of recognition
of unconventional splicing sites found in ORF (for example a donor splice with the sequence 'nag' instead of 'ngt').
Although manual expertise is still required for a definitive
functionality assignment, IMGT/LIGMotif represents a
major step forward in the automatic assignment of the
functionality. In its present status, IMGT/LIGMotif considerably accelerates the process of identification and
description of antigen receptor genes in large genomic
sequences.

Conclusions
IMGT/LIGMotif http://www.imgt.org/ligmotif/ is a user
friendly tool that provides the annotation of large
genomic sequences containing IG and TR genes. The web
user interface provides a simple way to query, visualize
and download results. The execution time is suitable for
the analysis of an entire locus. The annotation includes
the gene identification and orientation in the sequence,
the gene delimitation (V-GENE, D-GENE and J-GENE),
the detailed description of gene units (L-V-GENE-UNIT,
D-GENE-UNIT and J-GENE-UNIT) with the IMGT®
labels and functionality identification, and finally the
cluster assembly. Annotation of C-GENE has not been
included in this first version of IMGT/LIGMotif as the
gene identification and annotation is performed easily
with conventional tools by the biocurators. IMGT/LIGMotif is particularly useful for the annotation of IG and
TR loci from species that are phylogenetically close to
human and mouse such as nonhuman primate species,
chimpanzee and rat, respectively. More distant species
will still require manual expertise in the control of the
annotations. However, it is expected that the progressive
enrichment of the IMGT/LIGMotif reference motif databases with data IG and TR annotated by IMGT® will save
a considerable amount of time in the process of the
genomic annotation of vertebrate antigen receptor loci.
