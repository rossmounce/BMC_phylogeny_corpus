Abstract
Background: Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction is a difficult problem, which
requires a good scoring function to discriminate between real binding sites and background noise.
Many scoring functions have been proposed in the literature, but it is difficult to assess their relative
performance, because they are implemented in different software tools using different search
methods and different TFBS representations.
Results: Here we compare how several scoring functions perform on both real and semisimulated data sets in a common test environment. We have also developed two new scoring
functions and included them in the comparison. The data sets are from the yeast (S. cerevisiae)
genome.
Our new scoring function LLBG (least likely under the background model) performs best in this
study. It achieves the best average rank for the correct motifs. Scoring functions based on positional
bias performed quite poorly in this study.
Conclusion: LLBG may provide an interesting alternative to current scoring functions for TFBS
prediction.

Background
The TFBS prediction problem can be defined as follows:
Given N hypothetically co-regulated genes and their promoter sequences S = {S1, S2, ..., SN} (typically 1000 bp
upstream of each gene, although they can be much longer
in higher eukaryotes), search for motifs that are overrepresented in S compared to the set A of all promoter
sequences in the genome. Ideally, the most overrepresented motif is the TFBS. A recent review on both biological and computational aspects of TFBS prediction is [1].
Another review focusing more on the computational
aspects is also available [2].
Many software tools exist for TFBS prediction, e.g. Consensus [3], MEME [4,5], AlignACE [6], BioProspector [7],

and MDscan [8]. These tools can be classified according to
three criteria:
1. TFBS representation: How a putative TFBS is represented, e.g. consensus sequence [9,10], PSFM (position
specific frequency matrix) [7], Bayesian network [11] and
HMM [12].
2. Search method: How promoter sequences are searched
for putative TFBSs, e.g. greedy search [3], Gibbs sampling
[13] and deterministic iterative search [8].
3. Scoring function: How a newly found PSFM (or any
other TFBS representation) is scored to distinguish real
binding sites from background noise.

Comparison of scoring functions on eight different data sets (lower rank is better)

In this paper we will focus on the scoring function, which
is a crucial part of any TFBS prediction software. Many
scoring functions for TFBS prediction have been proposed
in the literature. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess their
relative performance because they are implemented in different software tools that:
1. use different TFBS representations.
2. use different search methods.
3. are tested on different data sets in the original papers.
We compare how several scoring functions perform on
both real and semi-simulated data sets in a common test

environment. We also develop two new scoring functions
and include them in the comparison.

Results
Scoring function performance
Six scoring functions (described in detail in the Methods
section) have been evaluated in this study. The scoring
functions were tested on eight different yeast data sets
(Fig. 1). In order to compare the performance of the different scoring functions, the rank of the correct motif is
shown. Lower rank is better, since the rank is the position
of the correct motif in the list of all potential motifs,
sorted according to the score from each scoring function.

MAP is performing quite well on most data sets, except for
mac1. The same holds for Group Specificity. Positional

Bias performs poorly for most data sets, except reb1, abf1
and rap1. Local Positional Bias is clearly better than Positional Bias, but has problems with abf1 and mig1. A closer
look at the poor performance of Local Positional Bias for
abf1 reveals that the positions of the correct binding sites
are not clearly localized to a certain region of the promoter sequences. There is only a weak local positional
bias (0.18), and many random motifs show a higher local
positional bias.
LLBG performs well for all data sets and is the best scoring
function in this comparison. The linear combination of
LLBG and Local Positional Bias performs well in general,
but has some problems with mac1, where it interestingly
performs worse than LLBG alone. The reason is that Local
Positional Bias performs significantly worse than LLBG
for this data set. Please note that ranks are shown in the
graph, so the combined score is not a linear function of
the bar heights of LLBG and Local Positional Bias, but a
linear function of the actual score values (data not shown)
of the LLBG and Local Positional Bias.
In order to avoid overfitting, the value of the Local Positional Bias weight a2 was estimated based on all data sets
but the current one. The value of a2 was around 0.5 for all
data sets (the LLBG weight a1 was fixed to 1).
Addition of noise
Generally, it is not realistic that all sequences in a data set
contain the binding site of interest. Often, when the set of
potentially co-regulated genes is defined by microarray
experiments (gene expression profiling), there are false
positives (genes where the TFBS of interest is not present)
in the data set. In order to evaluate the scoring functions
in the presence of this biologically relevant noise, between
10 and 30 promoter sequences were randomly selected
from the genome and added to the reb1 (Fig. 2) and mig1
(Fig. 3) data sets (in the original comparison without
noise, reb1 was the easiest data set to predict, and mig1
was a more difficult one, for which the best scoring functions performed about equally well). The results shown
are the average of ten independent runs, with different
randomly selected promoter sequences added in each run.
Table 4 contains a summary of the results.
reb1
In the reb1 data set (Fig. 2) the MAP score performs well
for reb1+10 (the original reb1 data set plus 10 randomly
selected upstream sequences). However, for reb1+20 and
reb1+30, performance decreases quickly. Group Specificity shows a similar trend, but is clearly better than MAP
for reb1+20 and reb1+30. Interestingly, Positional Bias
performs extremely well on this data set. However,
because of its general bad performance (Fig. 1), we should
not put too much confidence into this scoring function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/84

Local Positional Bias performs consistently poorly on this
data set. LLBG does extremely well on reb1+10 and
reb1+20, and for reb1+30 it also shows a good result. The
combined score performs quite well, but consistently
worse than LLBG alone. The reason, as we can see, is that
Local Positional Bias does not perform well on this data
set.
mig1
The mig1 data set (Fig. 3) was more difficult. The reason
seems to be that the mig1 motif shows higher variability
between the different promoter sequences than does the
reb1 motif. MAP performed quite poorly, especially on
mig1+20 and mig1+30. Group Specificity, Positional Bias
and Local Positional Bias failed already at mig1+10. LLBG
performed best in every case, slightly better than the combined scoring function on mig1+10 and mig1+20, and
significantly better on mig1+30.

All in all, LLBG seems to be the best scoring function in
this study.

Discussion
Choice of search method
The iterative deterministic search method was used in this
study because it has been shown [8,14] to suffer less from
local optima than e.g. Gibbs sampling. However, the scoring functions tested here can score any arbitrary set of candidate words, no matter how these words are selected, so
the relative performance of the different scoring functions
should not depend on the choice of search method. The
only interaction between the search method and the scoring function is that the search method provides the scoring function with several sets of candidate motifs to score.
Determination of parameters
Most scoring functions have one parameter where the
value is not directly determined by the data: MAP (Markov
model order), Group Specificity (s1), Local Positional Bias
(Lw) and LLBG (Markov model order). In this respect,
these scoring functions are similar. The exception is Positional Bias, which has two parameters (tm and Lw). We also
note that the cardinality of the parameters are different.
For example, only a few discrete values are reasonable for
the Markov model order. On the other hand, e.g. the
Group Specificity s1 parameter has a larger range of possible values.

We have not tried to find the optimal parameters of each
scoring function, but used the values proposed in the original papers. Since yeast is often used as a model organism
for TFBS prediction studies, we assumed that the default
parameters are reasonable for the yeast data sets in this
study. Also, to make the comparison as fair as possible, we

used in MAP.

distribution, many false positives will be found, which is
the case of Positional Bias and Local Positional Bias.

Positional bias
Because of the high variance in performance of the positional bias based scoring functions, it seems that positional bias is a feature of only a few of the data sets in this
study. For others, it seems that the positions of the TFBSs
do not deviate strongly from a random distribution. This
has also been observed previously [6]. When a large
number of long promoter sequences are searched for
motifs, many candidate motifs have to be considered. If a
scoring function only deviates slightly from the random

Advantages of LLBG
Robustness is an important property of TFBS scoring functions. The tests performed on reb1 and mig1 with added
noise indicate that LLBG is quite robust against this form
of biologically realistic noise, more robust than the other
scoring functions in this test.

Many software tools for TFBS prediction require the user
to specify the motif width w as a parameter. This is of
course difficult when the motif is unknown and makes

these tools impractical to use. The MAP scoring function
is normalized by the motif width, which should make it
comparable for motifs of different widths [8]. However,
scaling the entropy part of MAP is problematic, as pointed
out by [14]. The LLBG score does not have entropy as a
part of its function, and hence should not suffer from this
problem.
Possible extensions
The LLBG score, as it is currently defined, measures the
probability of a motif occurring at least once in the promoter sequence. It is possible to extend it to how many
times a motif occurs in a sequence, which would increase
its performance on data sets with several TFBSs per
sequence. However, initial experiments have indicated
that a multi-motif-per-sequence version of LLBG did not
improve the results for the yeast data sets that we have
been working with so far.

Even though we have here treated only the problem of
finding a single motif, it is possible to generalize the LLBG
scoring function to clusters of different motifs. This is of
special interest in higher eukaryotes and will be subject to
future work.
Currently, the LLBG is based on the discrete distance
measure of number of mismatches between a candidate
word and the PSFM consensus. Future research will go
into using a continuous distance between a candidate
word and the PSFM (not the PSFM consensus). This
should make the score more robust, especially for long
motifs with many uninformative positions, and it should
further improve the performance of this scoring function.
We have here focused on the problem of de novo prediction of TFBSs. The related problem of TFBS recognition,
where a library of known TFBSs is used to search for similar motifs in S, has not been considered here. Clearly,
these libraries may improve TFBS prediction if the TFBS of
interest happens to be similar to a TFBS already documented. Conceptually, this can easily be incorporated in
the LLBG scoring function by studying the likelihood ratio
between the TFBS library model and the background
model.

phylogenetic footprinting data. Since nature is able to find
TFBSs with higher precision than any of the scoring functions reviewed here, we believe that the current computational models are missing some fundamental part of the
transcription regulation mechanism. Future research will
go into investigating the structural properties of DNA that
enables transcription [15]. Interesting progress on work in
this direction has been done recently for prokaryotes [16],
and the related histone code has been suggested for
eukaryotes [17].

Conclusion
The time requirements of the scoring functions in this
study are very different. LLBG, MAP and Local Positional
Bias are relatively fast to evaluate. Group Specificity and
Positional Bias are significantly more time consuming,
since they require a search of a PSFM in all intergenic
sequences. Since the two slower scoring functions do not
perform better than three faster ones, their longer computation time does not seem to be justified.
The Positional Bias and Local Positional Bias are scoring
functions that perform quite poorly for several data sets
(e.g. mig1), but quite well for others (e.g. reb1 without the
added noise). In other words, it seems that this feature is
not relevant for some data sets (that the position of the
binding site in the upstream sequence is clearly different
between genes), but that it clearly matters for other data
sets. This makes these scoring functions difficult to use for
de novo TFBS prediction, since we cannot know beforehand whether an unknown TFBS is positionally biased.
LLBG is the scoring function that performs best in this test.
The other scoring functions perform well on some data
sets and poorly on others. Combining LLBG and Local
Positional Bias results in a scoring function that on average performs slightly worse than LLBG alone. Since there
is no clear improvement in combining the scoring functions (Fig 1, 2 and 3), the simpler solution of using only
LLBG should be preferred.
A software tool using the LLBG scoring function is currently being developed.

Methods
Limitations of current models
It should be noted that although the best scoring functions perform reasonably on these yeast data sets (with
promoter regions of 1000 bp), the problem becomes
much more difficult when dealing with higher eukaryotes
(with promoter regions of more than 10000 bp). In that
case, all of these scoring functions are likely to have problems (because of low signal-to-noise ratio), and it
becomes more important to extend the models by including other sources of information, such as ChIP-chip and

TFBS representation
The PSFM representation is used for all comparisons,
since it provides a good approximation of the specific protein-DNA interactions [18], and since it seems to be the
representation most commonly used in the literature. The
PSFM is a matrix consisting of the frequency of each nucleotide at each motif position.

Search method
A deterministic iterative search method similar to [8,14]
was used, since it thoroughly searches the promoter
sequences in quite reasonable time (less than a minute for
most data sets of typical size, around 20 sequences of
1000 bp each). Furthermore, it does not suffer from the
problem of local minima to the same degree as Gibbs
sampling, as pointed out in [8,14]. In short, it works as
follows:

The first word Wb of width w in S1 (position 1..w) is chosen as base word. A candidate set of words is collected for
which the hamming distance to the base word is at most
m, a threshold which is determined empirically as a function of w [14]. Each sequence Si may contribute zero, one
or several words to the set of candidate words. A PSFM is
created from all the Nc candidate words by computing the
frequency of each nucleotide at each position. This PSFM
is iteratively refined by removing words until a scoring
function is maximized. This is repeated for all base words
Wb in S1 (position 2..w + 1, 3..w + 2, ...), generating one
PSFM for each Wb. In order to improve the results, a search
is done using each PSFM against S to define a new set of
candidate words, which are again iteratively refined a
maximum number of times or until convergence. For the
purpose of searching for a PSFM in S,
counts are used as described in [13].

N c pseudo-

The data sets in this study were known to have a motif
occurrence in S1, so we only used base words from S1 for
efficiency reasons, as was done in [14]. However, in general this cannot be assumed, so base words should normally be chosen from several (or all) sequences in S. Base
words were collected from both strands.
Scoring functions
The following scoring functions were tested: MAP [8],
Group Specificity and Positional Bias [6]. We also introduced two new scoring functions: LLBG and Local Positional Bias, and included them in the comparison.
MAP
The MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) score is
used in MDscan [8]. It is a combination of the negative
entropy of the PSFM and the rareness of the PSFM according to a 3rd order Markov model estimated from all intergenic regions of a genome:
MAP =

log ( xm ) w 4
1
(∑ ∑ pi , j log pi , j −
∑ log(p0(s)))
w
xm alls
i =1 j =1

(1)

where w is the width of the motif, xm is the number of candidate words (m-matches) in the PSFM, pij is the frequency
of nucleotide j at position i of the PSFM and p0(s) is the

probability of generating the candidate word s from the
background model. We computed p0 using a 3rd order
Markov model in the following way (for the example
word ACAGT):
p0(ACAGT) = p(ACA)p(G|ACA)p(T|CAG)

(2)

The first part of the MAP score is the negative entropy,
which is higher for PSFMs with more similar candidate
words. A PSFM with identical words has maximum negative entropy (0), and a PSFM where all nucleotides are
equally frequent at each position has minimum negative
entropy (-2w). Naturally, true TFBSs are expected to be
similar (and in some rare cases even identical) words.
Group specificity
This score is used in AlignACE [6]. It measures how well a
given motif is localized to the set of input sequences S
compared to all non-coding sequences. The rationale is
that the true TFBS is a motif that is clearly more frequent
in the selected promoter sequences than in all promoter
sequences.

All promoter sequences in the genome are searched for
the motif PSFM. The set of sequences from the top s1 hits
are intersected with S, and the probability that these two
sets would have the observed intersection or greater
(Group Specificity score) is calculated:

S=

 s1   T − s1 


 i   s2 − i 
N
 
 s2 

min( s1 ,s2 ) 

∑

i= x

( 3)

where T is the total number of promoter sequences, s1 is
the top number of genes (typically 100), s2 is the number
of sequences in S, and x is the number of ORFs in the
intersection of the two lists. This score has the advantage
(compared to a kth-order Markov model) that it estimates
how rare the motif PSFM is, not the rareness of parts of
each candidate word in the PSFM.
Positional Bias
Like Group Specificity, this score was proposed in AlignACE [6]. It measures the concentration of motifs within
a certain distance from the transcriptional start site. The
rationale is that TFBSs tend to be located at the same distance from the transcriptional start site of each gene. Since
the transcriptional start site is difficult to map, the translational start site is used as a reasonable approximation. The
top tm (typically 200) PSFM hits in the genome for a given
motif are found and their positions relative to the nearest
ORF start are extracted. Among these, the t PSFM hits that
are found within L bp upstream of some ORF are
considered further. Let mw be the largest number of hits

( 5)

In the original paper, Lw = 50 and L = 600 were used.
Because of longer upstream sequences in the data sets
used in this paper (L = 1000), we chose a larger window
(Lw = 100).
Local Positional Bias
Initial tests showed that the original Positional Bias performed poorly on some data sets, so we decided to try a
modified version of it. We call this new scoring function
Local Positional Bias. It differs from Positional Bias in two
ways:

1. The positional bias is measured in the input sequences
S instead of the whole genome.
2. The bias of all windows is considered (using a χ2-test)
instead of only the window with the largest number of
sites. This makes it less sensitive to noise.
The Local Positional Bias Ploc is defined as the probability
(according to a χ2-test) that the positions of the sampled
motifs were generated from a model where all positions
are equally probable. For example, consider Fig. 4 with 16
motif occurrences distributed over w = 10 windows. The
test statistic is computed as:
w

χ =∑
2

i =1

( Ci − E ( Ci ) )
E ( Ci )

2

(6)

where Ci is the number of occurrences in window i and
E(Ci) is the expected number of occurrences in each window, in this example 16/10 = 1.6. The χ2 test statistic has
f = w - 1 degrees of freedom, in our case f = 10 - 1 = 9. In
our example, χ2 = 25.25, which leads to a probability
(Local Positional Bias) of 0.0027 according to the cumulative χ2-distribution.
LLBG
In the LLBG (least likely under the background model)
score we consider the likelihood that a motif occurs at
least once in M promoter sequences out of N under a
background model. The idea is that the TFBS is the motif
that is least likely to have been produced in these promoter sequences by the background model. The trade-off
between more motif occurrences and lower probability
according to the background model is treated in a probabilistic manner.

Given a set of candidate words (and a PSFM created from
these words), we define the worst candidate word Ww as
the word with the largest Hamming distance dmax to the
PSFM consensus sequence Wc. Let peb be the probability
that a randomly chosen word is at most dmax from the
consensus:
peb = Pr[d(W, Wc) ≤ dmax]

(7)

where d is the Hamming distance function and W is a random word from the 3rd order Markov model of all intergenic sequences. In the trivial case where all candidate
words are identical (dmax = 0), there is only one word for
which d(W, Wc) ≤ dmax. In this case, peb = p0(Ww), where p0
is computed like in equation (2). If Ww is at distance 1
from Wc, we have to sum the p0 of 1 + 3w different words.
In the general case, we have to consider nw words:

nw =

and sum the p0 of all nw words to get peb. However, it
becomes intractable to sum over all the possibilities for
many mismatches in long motifs. Instead, we use the

sets is usually low, which makes p* very close to pavg.
avg
Having defined peb, the probability of the motif occurring
at least once in a promoter sequence of length L (assuming that the motif has equal probability to occur at all
positions) is:
p1s = 1 - (1 - peb)L-w+1

(10)

For small values of peb, we can approximate equation (10)
using Maclaurin polynomials:
p1s ≈ (L - w + 1)peb

(11)

Holding the first occurrence of the motif fixed, the probability of the motif occurring in at least M - 1 additional
promoter sequences out of the total N - 1 is:

pms =

N −1

∑

i = M−1

Bin(p1s , i, N − 1)

( 12 )

which is our LLBG score. Since each occurrence is compared to the consensus, it can be argued that we should
consider M occurrences. The reason that we consider M 1 instead of M additional promoter sequences is that the
latter introduces a bias when comparing scores from
motifs of different lengths (long motifs with very few
occurrences get too high scores). In the extreme case, consider a very long motif with only one occurrence: If M
were used, this motif would get higher scores than all the
biologically relevant motifs. By removing one occurrence
(the most consensus like) and only considering the
remaining M - 1 occurrences, this problem is solved.
LLBG + Local Positional Bias
In addition, we considered a combined scoring function
of LLBG and Local Positional Bias. The correlation coefficient between these scoring functions is low (Table 1) and
they are independent (within one standard deviation)
according to a χ2-test (Table 2).

Generally, scores can be combined by converting them to
normal deviates (using the z-transform) and summing
them together. However, LLBG and Local Positional Bias
deviate quite clearly from a normal distribution (data not
shown), so we do not consider this option. Instead, since

these scores are probabilities, we can combine them by
adding their logarithms together:
comb = log pms + log Ploc

but it facilitates the definition of what should be regarded
as the correct motif. This simplification has also been used
in comparisons of TFBS prediction software [14].

(13)

However, as pointed out in [19], giving the scores equal
weight often causes problems since one scoring function
may be so dominating that the contribution of the other
is practically ignored. Instead, we give each scoring function a unique weight:
comb = a1 log pms + a2 log Ploc

(14)

In practice, we are only interested in the relative weighting
between the two scores, so we fix one (a1 = 1) and find the
optimal value of the other. In order to avoid overfitting,
we do an n-fold cross validation (e.g. when combining the
scores for the reb1 data set, the parameters are optimized
on all data sets except reb1).
As was shown in the results section, this combined scoring
function did not perform better than LLBG alone.
Data sets
The scoring functions were tested on data sets from [14].
These data sets consist of the promoter sequences (1000
bp upstream regions) of genes regulated by a certain transcription factor in yeast (Table 3). The 1000 bp upstream
regions were used even in those cases where it overlaps
another ORF. Each promoter sequence has at least one
(putative or biologically verified) binding site of the transcription factor of interest. Most data sets are compiled
from different molecular biology studies, where each
binding site is biologically verified (Table 3). It is possible
(and likely) that the promoter sequences also contain
some binding sites of other transcription factors, but this
is not considered here, as we do not have sufficient information on this. The width of the correct motif was given
to the search algorithm. This is not needed by the search
algorithm or scoring functions used in this comparison,

Each of these data sets were analyzed using each of the
scoring functions. All PSFMs generated by the search
method were scored using each of the scoring functions,
and the complete list of PSFMs was sorted according to the
score (highest first). If the consensus motifs of several
PSFMs were identical, the lower scoring duplicate PSFMs
were removed from the list. The rank (position in the
sorted list) of the correct motif was compared between the
different scoring functions for each data set.
As 'correct motif' we considered the known TFBS consensus (Table 3), either exact or shifted one position. Long
motifs (i.e. at least ten informative positions) are allowed
to have one mismatch or be shifted up to two positions.
The reason for this relaxed definition is that the reported
TFBS consensus motif for some data sets is not absolutely
correct. For example, the given GAL4 binding site differs
from recent findings from ChIP-chip experiments, as
pointed out by [14]. Also, sometimes the first or last positions of the consensus are about as significant as the positions outside of these two (and hence not contained in the
consensus sequence). This relaxed definition makes the
comparison less sensitive to random fluctuations.
