Abstract
Background: The genus Corynebacterium includes Gram-positive microorganisms of great biotechnologically
importance, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum and Corynebacterium efficiens, as well as serious human pathogens,
such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Corynebacterium jeikeium. Although genome sequences of the respective
species have been determined recently, the knowledge about the repertoire of transcriptional regulators and the
architecture of global regulatory networks is scarce. Here, we apply a combination of bioinformatic tools and a
comparative genomic approach to identify and characterize a set of conserved DNA-binding transcriptional
regulators in the four corynebacterial genomes.
Results: A collection of 127 DNA-binding transcriptional regulators was identified in the C. glutamicum ATCC
13032 genome, whereas 103 regulators were detected in C. efficiens YS-314, 63 in C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 and
55 in C. jeikeium K411. According to amino acid sequence similarities and protein structure predictions, the DNAbinding transcriptional regulators were grouped into 25 regulatory protein families. The common set of DNAbinding transcriptional regulators present in the four corynebacterial genomes consists of 28 proteins that are
apparently involved in the regulation of cell division and septation, SOS and stress response, carbohydrate
metabolism and macroelement and metal homeostasis.
Conclusion: This work describes characteristic features of a set of conserved DNA-binding transcriptional
regulators present within the corynebacterial core genome. The knowledge on the physiological function of these
proteins should not only contribute to our understanding of the regulation of gene expression but will also
provide the basis for comprehensive modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks of these species.

Background
Upon completion and annotation of the nucleotide
sequence of a bacterial genome, a great scientific challenge is to elucidate the regulation of expression of all the
predicted genes and to deduce thereof the entirety of regulatory networks present in the respective microorganism.
An important prerequisite in understanding regulation of
gene expression on the global scale is the identification of
the repertoire of regulatory proteins in a genome sequence
[1]. DNA-binding transcription factors are key components in the regulation of gene expression because they
rapidly respond to changes in the cellular environment by
modulating the expression of relevant genes. Threedimensional structure analyses and amino acid sequence
comparisons of DNA-binding transcription factors enabled their allocation into distinct protein classes that
apparently use specific structural motifs for DNA recognition and binding [2]. The helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif is
obviously the most widely distributed DNA-binding
domain in prokaryotic proteins and provides the structural basis for efficient protein-DNA interactions [3].
Although a considerable amino acid sequence divergence
has been observed among HTH proteins, they generally
share a site-specific DNA-binding domain that is composed of two α-helices separated by a short turn of variable length [4]. Both α-helices are involved in the DNAbinding and recognition process in such a way that the
first helix associates non-specifically with the DNA molecule while the second helix recognizes and binds specifically to its cognate operator sequence [5]. Based on
variations of the three-dimensional structure of the HTH
motif, DNA-binding transcription factors can be subdivided into several DNA-binding domain types [6]. The
canonical 'winged helix' type, for instance, consists of two
wings, three α-helices and three β-strands and is present in
several families of DNA-binding transcription factors. In
this case, the third α-helix is the DNA recognition helix,
whereas the first and second ones are involved in stabilizing the DNA-binding and recognition process [3]. An
interesting outcome of comparative studies between
DNA-binding transcription factors was a position-function correlation such that repressor proteins usually possess the HTH motif within the N-terminal region, whereas
activators tend to have the HTH motif close to the C-terminal end of the protein [1]. Moreover, the putative physiological role of a DNA-binding transcription factor can
be deduced from its classification into an evolutionary
regulatory protein family, since within many families the
members are homogenous in respect of their regulatory
role and the physiology of the regulated genes [1].
Because of the importance of corynebacteria in biotechnology as well as in human medicine they represent an
attractive target to elucidate and compare the repertoire of
DNA-binding transcription factors by bioinformatic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/86

approaches. Corynebacterium glutamicum and its closest
phylogenetic relative Corynebacterium efficiens are both
widely known for their capacity to produce amino acids
by large-scale fermentation processes [7,8]. On the other
hand, Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the etiological agent
of the acute, communicable disease diphtheria and apparently the most important human pathogen of the genus
Corynebacterium [9], which also includes a growing
number of nosocomial pathogens, such as the multiresistant Corynebacterium jeikeium [10]. Accordingly, complete
genome sequences of the four corynebacterial species
have been determined and annotated recently [11-15].
Subsequent synteny analyses of the predicted coding
sequences revealed that the four corynebacteria have
largely maintained an ancestral genome structure [15,16].
Therefore, we were not only interested in the identification and classification of the individual DNA-binding
transcriptional regulatory repertoire of each of the four
corynebacterial species by means of different bioinformatic tools but also in comparative genomic approaches
to deduce thereof the common set of regulatory genes.
The knowledge on conserved regulatory genes encoded by
the corynebacterial core genome certainly provides a solid
basis for the future analysis of transcriptional regulatory
networks
in
pathogenic
and
non-pathogenic
corynebacteria.

Results and discussion
The repertoire of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators
in corynebacterial genomes
To fully understand the regulation of gene expression in a
bacterial cell it is necessary to identify and characterize the
repertoire of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators with
respect to regulatory and physiological properties. Therefore, we have screened the complete genome sequences of
four corynebacteria by different bioinformatic tools to
detect genes encoding DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. Other gene products typically exhibiting regulatory
properties on the transcriptional level, such as sigma factors or two-component systems, were excluded from the
present study. The work flow for the identification and
analysis of transcriptional regulatory proteins is described
in detail in the Methods section. Following three consecutive steps of data collection, a total number of 348 DNAbinding transcriptional regulators were identified in the
genomes of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, C. efficiens YS314, C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 and C. jeikeium K411. A
compilation of the data characterizing the DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators of each species is provided as
supplementary material (see Additional files 1,2,3 and 4).

An overview of the resulting data along with a genome
comparison between the four corynebacterial species is
presented in Table 1. A collection of 127 DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators was identified in the genome of

C. glutamicum, whereas 103 transcriptional regulators
were identified in the chromosomal sequence of C. efficiens, 63 in C. diphtheriae and only 55 in C. jeikeium. Three
additional genes encoding DNA-binding transcriptional
regulators were detected on the endogenous plasmid
pCE3 of C. efficiens YS-314 (data not shown). Considering
the differences in genome size of the four corynebacterial
species, it became apparent that a larger number of coding
regions within a genome sequence requires more genes
that encode DNA-binding transcriptional regulators
(Table 1). The identified regulatory proteins represent 4.2
and 3.5 %, respectively, of the predicted coding sequences
in the genomes of the non-pathogenic corynebacteria C.
glutamicum and C. efficiens, whereas the percentage is
reduced to 2.7 and 2.6 %, respectively, in the pathogenic
corynebacterial species C. diphtheriae and C. jeikeium.
These data are consistent with a previous observation that
an increase of genomic complexity and physiological
functionality is generally associated with a more complex
regulation of gene expression since the additional genetic
information has to be integrated into the existing regulatory networks that operate in a bacterial cell [17].
Classification of corynebacterial DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators into regulatory protein families
DNA-binding transcriptional regulators can be grouped
into evolutionary regulatory protein families based on
their amino acid sequence similarity [1]. According to
amino acid sequence alignments performed with the
CLUSTAL X program, the complete collection of corynebacterial transcriptional regulators fell into 25 protein
families with only a small number of regulators that
remained unclassified (Figure 1). Most of the identified
regulatory protein families can be regarded as homogenous with respect to the size distribution of the assigned
family members (see Addional files 1, 2, 3 and 4). At least
in some cases the high degree of amino acid sequence
similarities along with the conserved protein size within a
regulatory protein family indicate that the respective family members derived from a common ancestor. Therefore,
one can assume that members of homogenous regulatory
protein families tend to affect the expression of genes
involved in related physiological functions of the cell [1].
On the other hand for instance, the HTH_3 family con-

tains several members of rather heterogenous size (see
Addional files 1, 2, 3 and 4) reflecting a lower degree of
similarity of proteins within this family. Accordingly, a
more diverse evolutionary history and thus physiological
functionality in corynebacteria can be predicted for the
members of the HTH_3 family.
The identified regulatory protein families vary significantly in their number of representatives, ranging from
TetR, the largest family with up to 16 members, to protein
families with a single member, for instance ArgR, FUR,
HrcA, LexA and YbaD (Figure 1). The protein families
ArgR, HrcA and LexA are characterized in bacterial
genomes predominantly by single representatives that are
involved in the regulation of arginine metabolism, the
heat shock response and the SOS repair pathway of the
cell respectively [18]. Most of the regulatory protein families with a few members have homologs in the four
corynebacterial genomes with the exception of the PadR
and ROK families that are absent in C. jeikeium (Figure 1).
Further exceptions are single regulators grouped into the
RpiR family of C. glutamicum and into the FIS family of C.
efficiens.
In principle, the overall composition of the repertoire of
DNA-binding transcriptional regulators identified in the
non-pathogenic corynebacteria C. glutamicum and C. efficiens seemed to be very similar, which was obvious when
considering the close phylogenetic relationship of both
species [8]. The average number of members per regulatory protein family was calculated as 4.1 for C. efficiens
and 5.1 in case of C. glutamicum, suggesting that speciesspecific differences are mainly caused by slightly smaller
numbers of regulatory proteins per family in C. efficiens.
On the other hand, the average number of members per
regulatory protein family is in the order of 2.6 for the
pathogenic corynebacteria C. diphtheriae and C. jeikeium.
Remarkable differences between the transcriptional regulatory repertoire of pathogenic and non-pathogenic
corynebacteria became apparent when comparing, for
instance, the number of proteins grouped into the ArsR,
IclR and LacI families (Figure 1). The ArsR family of
transcriptional regulators contains metalloregulatory proteins that control genes whose expression is linked to

stress-inducing concentrations of heavy metal ions [19],
whereas members of the IclR and LacI families generally
respond to environmental changes that affect the carbohydrate metabolism of the cell [20]. It certainly makes
sense that soil bacteria have a large diversity of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators that function as metal sensors or respond to changes in the carbohydrate
composition of the environment. The larger number of
proteins grouped into the IclR and LacI families may provide these bacteria the ability to grow in the presence of
several carbon sources and to rapidly adapt their gene
expression to changing nutrient conditions. The observed
differences in the number of transcriptional regulators
involved in carbohydrate metabolism may also reflect the
fact that pathogenic bacteria do not require a versatile
sugar metabolism since only a limited range of carbohydrate nutrients might be present in their natural habitats.
Variations in the number of metalloregulatory sensors
may also be linked to the different environmental conditions such that pathogenic bacteria predominantly import
metal ions directly from the host rather than from inanimate environment. It is noteworthy that the number of
regulatory proteins of the TetR family is otherwise not
reduced significantly in the pathogenic species (Figure 1).
This observation implies that the TetR repressor family

provides a very common switch for the regulation of gene
expression in corynebacteria.
Classification of corynebacterial transcriptional regulators
according to DNA-binding domain types
The transcriptional regulators were additionally grouped
according to DNA-binding domain types that specify variations of the three dimensional structure of the HTH
motif. The DNA-binding domain types were detected by
using the domain assignment server SUPERFAMILY [21].
We found that only six DNA-binding domain types have
representatives in corynebacteria with the 'winged helix'
type being the most prominent HTH motif (Table 2).
Especially the hairpin wings of the 'winged helix' display
considerable flexibility in their utilization for DNA-binding and alternative modes of DNA recognition [3]. Other
DNA-binding domains were also identified in corynebacteria, but only in a few regulatory proteins (Table 2). This
includes DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of the
WhiB protein family that were suggested to act as transcriptional activators [22]. Structure-function predictions
for WhiB proteins indicated that the most C-terminal αhelix is a likely candidate for DNA-binding. Additionally,
an aminoterminal Zinc β-ribbon domain combined with
an ATP-cone domain was detected in the single member

of the YbaD protein family, which is probably involved in
a hitherto unknown mechanism of transcriptional regulation of ribonucleotide reductase expression in bacteria
[23].
Subsequently, the position of the DNA-binding domain
within the transcriptional regulators in combination with

the regulatory protein family membership was used to
predict whether a protein is expected to act as repressor or
activator of gene expression. The position of the DNAbinding motif was determined by both the HTH prediction tool [24] and the domain assignment server SUPERFAMILY [21]. This computational approach resulted in an
average distribution of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators in the four corynebacterial species of 73.8 % repressors, 16.4 % activators and 9.8 % dual regulators. Dual
transcriptional regulators are either activators of several
genes and repressors of their own synthesis or activators
and repressors of different sets of genes [1]. In particular,
the members of the AsnC, Crp and LysR protein families
represent dual regulators of gene expression whereas the
AraC, LuxR, MerR, and WhiB protein families were
regarded as activators of gene expression. However, one
has to keep in mind that some regulatory protein families,
for instance IclR, MarR and MerR, may include both activator and repressor proteins. Nevertheless, considering
that approximately three-quarters of the DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators are repressor proteins it is
apparent that mechanistic requirements for repression are
dominant in the architecture of regulatory networks in
corynebacteria. A similar analysis of 314 regulatory proteins of Escherichia coli revealed a different picture in such
a way that a quite even distribution of 42.8%, 34.8% and
22.3% of repressors, activators and dual regulators was
predicted for this species [1].
The common repertoire of DNA-binding transcriptional
regulators identified in four corynebacterial genome
sequences
We were then interested to specify those DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators that are common in the four
sequenced corynebacterial genomes. For this purpose,
orthologous proteins were identified in the complete collection of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators by
using the BLASTP algorithm to detect amino acid

sequence similarities and by performing synteny analyses
of the respective genomic context. This comparative content analysis of transcriptional regulators allowed us to
calculate the number of shared and species-specific regulatory proteins among the four corynebacteria. The resulting data were summarized in the Venn diagrams of Figure
2. It is striking that the genomes of C. glutamicum and C.
efficiens share 77 transcriptional regulators suggesting that
many regulatory networks might be conserved in both
species and controlled by homologous regulatory functions. This is consistent with the very similar distribution
of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of both species
within the identified regulatory protein families (Figure
1). Approximately 75 % of the transcriptional regulators
detected in C. diphtheriae are shared with the repertoire of

regulatory proteins of the non-pathogenic corynebacteria
C. glutamicum and C. efficiens (Figure 2). Consequently,
both species provide valuable model systems for investigating the regulation of gene expression in C. diphtheriae
since it is likely that not only the regulatory proteins but
also the corresponding regulatory networks are somehow
conserved. The composition of the small regulatory repertoire of C. jeikeium is much more intriguing since virtually
all of the DNA-binding transcriptional regulators are
either species-specific or shared with the other three
corynebacteria. This finding might reflect the distant phylogenetic relationship between C. jeikeium and the investigated corynebacterial species [25]. By combining the
data of the comparative content analyses, the common set
of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators present in C.

glutamicum, C. efficiens, C. diphtheriae and C. jeikeium was
finally confined to only 28 proteins (Table 3).
According to functional assignments deduced from computational predictions and protein similarities, 22 of the
common DNA-binding transcriptional regulators were
grouped into five functional categories (Table 3). The
physiological role of the remaining six transcriptional regulators remained unknown since the potential targets of
their regulation were difficult to predict from the existing
data and the genome organization. The resulting functional classification is of particular interest since members
of four categories are apparently involved in the control of
fundamental processes of the bacterial life style, namely
cell division and septation, SOS and stress response, carbohydrate metabolism and macroelement and metal
homeostasis (Table 3). A fifth category comprises only
single representatives of the ArgR family and the YbaD
family that are involved in the regulation of specific biosynthesis pathways [18,23].
Cell division and septation
The first functional category of common DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators includes three members of the
WhiB protein family. This regulatory protein family represents a specific group of transcriptional activators that
appeared to be present in perhaps all actinobacteria while
being absent from all other sequenced bacterial genomes
[22]. Members of the WhiB protein family were postulated to function in cell division and septation of mycobacteria [26] and in differentiation of streptomycetes [27],
possibly by sensing redox changes in the environment or
internally during metabolic shifts that occur as inescapable part of alterations in the cellular metabolism. The
genomes of C. glutamicum, C. efficiens and C. jeikeium carry
four whiB homologs while a whiB3 ortholog is missing in
the C. diphtheriae genome. In this context it is noteworthy
that the whiB3 gene was shown to be dispensable for
growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium
smegmatis [28,29].
SOS and stress response
The second functional category contains six DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators that are apparently involved in
the SOS and stress response of the cell. First of all,
homologs of the LexA protein and the redox-responsive
transcriptional regulator OxyR were identified in the four
corynebacterial genomes. These proteins are well-known
to control the SOS response and the oxidative stress
response of the bacterial cell respectively [30,31]. Moreover, the conserved HrcA, HspR and ClgR proteins were
included in this functional category since they represent
main components of the heat shock response of C.
glutamicum [32,33]. In general, the major function of the
three responses is either the repair or the elimination of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/86

damaged macromolecules of the cell. A conserved
member of the ArsR protein family was also included into
this functional category of transcriptional regulators
because its conserved genomic context suggested that it
plays a role in the regulation of expression of the corynebacterial suf gene cluster. The respective genes of
Escherichia coli have been implicated in the assembly of
Fe-S clusters in proteins during oxidative stress conditions
by encoding a specific sulphur transfer mechanism that
limits the release of sulphide and thus the formation of
highly damaging hydroxyl radicals [34].
Macroelement and metal homeostasis
The third category of conserved DNA-binding transcriptional regulators is obviously involved in the regulation of
macroelement and metal homeostasis of corynebacteria.
This functional category of proteins is build up by the
McbR, DtxR and FurB homologs and includes also two
regulators of the MerR family which is a collection of
metal-responsive transcriptional activators [35]. The
McbR protein of C. glutamicum was recently demonstrated
to regulate a wide spectrum of genes comprising all
aspects of transport and metabolism of the macroelement
sulphur in this species as well as two transcriptional regulators that were classified into the ROK family [36,37]. In
this context it is noteworthy that AmtR, the master regulator of nitrogen metabolism of C. glutamicum [38], was not
among the conserved set of DNA-binding transcriptional
regulators since an orthologous gene is apparently absent
in the genome of C. jeikeium. This striking difference in the
equipment of corynebacterial genomes with global regulatory genes indicated that transcriptional regulation of
sulphur metabolism is vitally important in corynebacteria
in contrast to a conservation of transcriptional control
mechanisms to provide an optimal supply of nitrogen for
cellular processes. The DtxR repressor is known as global
regulator of iron homeostasis in C. diphtheriae [39] but its
regulatory network might also include genes whose
expression is linked to protect the cell from oxidative
stress [40]. The conserved FurB proteins were included in
this functional category due to the observation that
expression of the orthologous gene in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis was specifically induced by zinc [41].
Carbohydrate metabolism
Our data suggested that six conserved genes are involved
in the regulation of corynebacterial carbohydrate metabolism. The respective functional category of DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators includes the AcnR repressor that
controls the expression of the aconitase gene acn, thus representing an important control point of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle of C. glutamicum [42]. Both RamB and GlxR
apparently participate in the regulation of acetate
metabolism and the glyoxylate bypass of C. glutamicum
[43,44]. The GlxR protein represses at least the expression

according to functional predictions most of these proteins
are involved in the control of fundamental cellular processes encoded by the corynebacterial core genome. However, the majority of the genes belonging to the common
set of transcriptional regulators has not been adequately
studied yet, so further research and direct functional studies are necessary to determine the physiological role of
these regulators and to precisely place them into the architecture of corynebacterial transcriptional regulatory networks. Further research is also necessary to determine the
physiological function of species-specific and shared
transcriptional regulators that might be involved either in
the regulation of cellular processes relevant for biotechnological production or that might control the expression of
genes involved for instance in virulence of pathogenic
corynebacteria. With respect to a very recent study on the
regulation of sulphur metabolism by the conserved transcriptional regulator McbR [37] we are confident that the
combined use of classical genetic approaches along with
post-genomic techniques, such as DNA microarrays and
2D gel electrophoresis, will provide the frame to decipher
transcriptional regulatory networks and to build comprehensive regulatory models of corynebacterial cells.

of the aceB gene in the presence of cAMP, whereas RamB
seems to be a more global regulator of gene expression.
The observation that the glxR gene could not be mutated
in C. glutamicum implies that the common set of DNAbinding transcriptional regulators may include further
members with essential regulatory functions. Three transcriptional regulators of the DeoR, IclR and LacI families
were also grouped into this functional category due to the
conserved physiological role of these homogenous regulatory protein families in the control of carbohydrate
metabolism [20,45,46].

Conclusion
Based on genome analyses with different bioinformatic
tools we have defined the individual set of DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators in four sequenced corynebacterial genomes and deduced thereof the common repertoire
of transcriptional regulators of these species. The data will
provide valuable information on the corynebacterial biology in general and the ways these bacteria interact with
different environments by modulating the expression of
relevant genes. Only 28 DNA-binding transcriptional regulators have counterparts in the four corynebacteria and

Methods
The general strategy to detect and classify DNA-binding
transcriptional regulators of sequenced corynebacterial
genomes was based on a combination of several
bioinformatic tools. According to the work flow schematized in Figure 3, putative DNA-binding proteins were first
searched for in the complete genome sequences of four
corynebacterial species, comprising C. glutamicum ATCC
13032 (GenBank accession number BX927147), C.
efficiens YS-314 (BA000035), C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129
(BX248353) and C. jeikeium K411 (CR931997). These
searches were performed by means of the genome assignment server SUPERFAMILY [21] that contains a library of
hidden Markov models (HMMs) and the results of
searches by these models against completely sequenced
genomes. The HMMs of SUPERFAMILY are based on the
sequences of domains collected in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database [47] and are thus
applicable for a structural classification of proteins. The
search for corynebacterial DNA-binding proteins also
included information deduced from the respective
genome annotations deposited in public databases [1214]. To identify among the DNA-binding proteins those
potentially representing transcriptional regulators, 35 different HMM profiles of bacterial protein families with
known function in transcriptional regulation of gene
expression were downloaded from the Pfam database and
used for searches against the predicted corynebacterial
proteins by applying the HMMsearch module of the
HMMER software package [48]. Verification of the results
was performed by means of the BLAST algorithms [49], in

particular by blastp and rpsblast along with the NCBI
Conserved Domain Search program. Literature information was used to find additional coding sequences for
DNA-binding transcriptional regulators in the corynebacterial genome sequences. During the final step of data
analysis, the putative DNA-binding transcriptional regulators were grouped into regulatory protein families. This
classification was performed by using HMM profiles of
the Pfam database, CLUSTAL X alignments [50] of those
proteins belonging to a distinct regulatory family and
results of PROSITE pattern searches [45]. The HTH recognition tool designed by Dodd and Egan [24] was used to
scan the putative DNA-binding transcriptional regulators
for the presence and position of HTH motifs. By combining all these data, defined collections of putative DNAbinding transcriptional regulators were identified for each
of the selected corynebacterial genomes (see Additional
files 1,2,3 and 4). To deduce thereof the common set of
DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of the four
sequenced corynebacterial species, comparative genomic
analyses were performed. This approach included blastp
searches with the identified regulatory proteins [49]
against the predicted proteins of each genome sequence,
using an evalue cut off smaller than 1 × e-10. To verify
whether the orthologous regulatory genes are present in
the same genomic context, neighbouring coding
sequences were included into synteny analyses.
