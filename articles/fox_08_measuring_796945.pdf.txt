Abstract
Background: The patterns of mutation vary both within and across genomes. It has been shown
for a few mammals that mutation rates vary within the genome, while for unknown reasons, the
sensu stricto yeasts have uniform rates instead. The generality of these observations has been
unknown. Here we examine silent site substitutions in a more expansive set (20 mammals, 27 fungi,
4 insects) to determine why some genomes demonstrate this mosaic distribution and why others
are uniform.
Results: We applied several intragene and intergene correlation tests to measure regional
substitution patterns. Assuming that silent sites are a reasonable approximation to neutrally
mutating sequence, our results show that all multicellular eukaryotes exhibit mutational
heterogeneity. In striking contrast, all fungi are mutationally uniform – with the exception of three
Candida species: C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C. tropicalis. We speculate that aspects of replication
timing may be responsible for distinguishing these species. Our analysis also reveals classes of genes
whose silent sites behave anomalously with respect to the mutational background in many species,
indicating prevalent selective pressures. Genes associated with nucleotide binding or gene
regulation have consistently low silent substitution rates in every mammalian species, as well as
multiple fungi. On the other hand, receptor genes repeatedly exhibit high silent substitution rates,
suggesting they have been influenced by diversifying selection.
Conclusion: Our findings provide a framework for understanding the regional mutational
properties of eukaryotes, revealing a sharp difference between fungi and multicellular species. They
also elucidate common selective pressures acting on eukaryotic silent sites, with frequent evidence
for both purifying and diversifying selection.

Background
Though neutral mutation rates were once considered to be
uniform, it has been discovered that they can vary not
only from one species to the next but also within a single
genome [1]. Within-genome heterogeneity has been demonstrated in a few mammalian species, namely human,

chimp, mouse, rat, dog, and cow [2-8]. In contrast, uniform mutation rates have been observed only in the phylogeny of the sensu stricto yeasts S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus,
S. bayanus, and S. mikatae [9]. The reason for this differing
mutational behavior is not understood, and little is
known about regional biases in other species. CharacteriPage 1 of 13

zation of regional biases in a broader range of species
would improve our understanding of genomic mutational properties. It would also aid in the calibration of
phylogenetic footprinting methods, which are important
for identifying sequences under purifying selection [10].
Most previous studies of mutation rate variation have
focused on mammals. Regional effects in the rodenthuman clade have been detected, for example, by analyzing the correlations of distinct pseudo-neutral quantities
such as SNP density, indel density, substitution rate in
ancestral repeats, and substitution rates in silent sites [11].
Regional effects have been further characterized via the
length scales at which nearby sequences are correlated, as
well as via correlations within single genes [2]. Proposed
explanations for heterogeneous mutation rates have
included variations in base composition, recombination,
gene density, and pattern of gene expression, though the
causal relationships remain uncertain [1].
An important step toward understanding the causes of
mutational heterogeneity would be to characterize
regional mutation rates in a more diverse sampling of species. The diversity of available genomes could aid in distinguishing different types of effects. For example, the
length scale of mammalian regional variation (~10
Mb)[2] is larger than a typical yeast chromosome (1 Mb).
Are long chromosomes a requirement of the mechanism
underlying regional mutation heterogeneity? A single
example of regional heterogeneity in a yeast species would
suggest this is not the case.
In this work, we use synonymous sites to analyze regional
mutational biases in 20 mammalian, 27 fungal, and 4
insect genomes. Such sites can be altered without affecting
the encoded amino acid sequence and are thus typically
less likely to be under selective pressure. This property has
made them a common dataset for measuring neutral
mutation rates[12]. Although it has been shown that
some synonymous sites have functional roles (reviewed in
[13]), only a minor fraction are likely to be under selection pressure (also discussed in [13]). For example,
among the sensu stricto yeasts, only 8% of genes (mostly
under codon usage selection) exhibit silent substitution
rates that deviate from the uniform neutral mutational
background[9], and analysis of these genes shows that
they perturb the overall genome-wide silent substitution
rate by only 3%.
Using silent sites as a proxy for neutral sequence, we
answer the following questions: Do all mammals exhibit
heterogeneity in their mutation rates? And, do all fungi
exhibit uniformity? Studying these phylogenies together
provides a valuable contrast. For instance, we unexpectedly find that while most fungi have uniform mutation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/186

rates, C. albicans and its closest relatives do exhibit
regional heterogeneity. In contrast, we find that all mammals and several insects have heterogeneous mutation
rates. Because our approach involves distinguishing the
neutral pressures that influence silent sites, our study also
naturally reveals genes whose silent sites behave unusually with respect to the mutational background in each
species. Interestingly, we find two strong themes governing such genes. First, we find evidence for purifying selection on synonymous sites in genes associated with RNA
binding or DNA binding, in both mammals and fungi.
Second, we find evidence that diversifying selection has
regularly influenced the silent sites of receptor genes, particularly in the mammals.

Results
There are many types of sequences in the genome which
may be used to determine the neutral mutation rate. In
this work we focus on synonymous sites, in particular
fourfold degenerate sites, from coding regions in 51 species. To isolate lineage-specific effects, pairs of species that
are closely related were chosen based on recently published yeast [14] and mammalian phylogenies [15,16].
Each gene from one species was mapped to an ortholog in
the second species and the two corresponding sequences
were aligned. Synonymous substitution rates were calculated for each orthologous gene pair by counting the fraction of observed substitutions at fourfold sites and then
normalizing to a z-score value (referred to as r) under the
assumption that all synonymous sites mutate independently at the genome-average rate (see Methods). Under
this assumption, a genome with a uniform mutation rate
will exhibit unit standard deviation in its r distribution,
while a heterogeneously mutating genome will exhibit a
larger standard deviation [2].
Most fungi have uniform mutation rates
The distribution of normalized substitution rates (r) provides a test of whether substitution rates are uniform
throughout a genome. In genomes with uniform rates
such as S. cerevisiae, the r distribution is very close to the
theoretical prediction of a Normal distribution with unit
standard deviation (σ = 1) [9]. However, in mammalian
genomes, the width of the r distribution is considerably
larger, due to the tendency of sites in the same gene to be
subject to similar regional mutation rates (Figure 1a).

In the current fungal dataset (27 species, 26 closely related
species pairs; a phylogeny is available in Additional file
1), we found that the r distributions for 22 of the 27 species (23 species pairs) are a good fit to the Normal distribution (Average σ = 1.32, range = [1.02 – 1.40], Figure 2).
This indicates that there are generally not regions of high
or low neutral mutation rate within these genomes (Figure 1b). These 22 fungal species (All species other than C.

Figure 1
Distributions of normalized 4-fold substitution rates
Distributions of normalized 4-fold substitution rates. These graphs indicate that most mammals have heterogeneous
mutation rates and most fungi have uniform mutation rates. The normal Gaussian distribution (thick green line) is what would
be expected if all 4-fold sites in each gene have an equal and independent probability of being substituted. (a) All mammalian
distributions have a bias toward high and low substitution rates, consistent with regional mutation biases in mammalian
genomes (b) Most fungal distributions fit more closely to the Gaussian, except for a tail of genes with low substitution rates
stemming from codon usage selection. (c) The distributions of C. albicans – C. dubliniensis (dotted purple line), C. tropicalis – C.
dubliniensis (solid red line), and N. crassa – C. globosum (dashed blue line). These species pairs each have a wider distribution,
similar to the mammalian distributions.

albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, N. crassa, and C. globosum) do have a slight excess of genes at negative r. That
group is largely comprised of ribosomal and metabolism
genes, consistent with genes known to be under selection
for codon usage bias [9]. Of the 432 genes with r ≤ -2 in
the S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus comparison, 201 (46.5%) have
a ribosomal or metabolism GO annotation. Such codon
usage selection is clear across the fungi. For example, in
the distinct lineage D. hansenii-C. guilliermondii, 138 of

253 genes (54.5%) with r ≤ -2 also map to ribosomal or
metabolism GO categories.
The inference that neutral mutation rates do not vary
across these 22 fungal genomes is further supported by a
neighboring gene analysis. For each pair of species, we calculated the Pearson correlation of r values for neighboring
genes (see Methods). These results are shown in Table 1.
We found no apparent correlation for any of the species

and mammals
Comparison of the widths of the rate distributions for fungi
Comparison of the widths of the rate distributions
for fungi and mammals. The yellow line at σ = 1 shows
the expected standard deviation for a Normal distribution.
The mammals have an average σ of 2.056, indicating their
bias toward both high and low rates – consistent with
regional mutation rates. There are three fungal pairwise
comparisons (C. dubliniensis/C. albicans, C. tropicalis/C. dubliniensis, and N. crassa/C. globosum) which also have wide rate
distributions, with an average σ of 1.825 (see Figure 1c). The
species pairs from the remaining 22 fungi have a noticeably
lower value of σ (average σ = 1.32, range = [1.02 – 1.40]),
consistent with their having uniformly mutating genomes.
Plotted values indicate the average σ in each group and horizontal lines mark the range.
pairs chosen from among these 22 genomes. The same
results were obtained irrespective of which species in the
pair was used to specify gene locations.
More generally, we computed an autocorrelation function
<r(x)r(0)>, where r(0) is the normalized substitution rate
of a gene and r(x) is the normalized substitution rate of a
gene that is x base pairs downstream of the first gene [9].
Because the rates have been constructed to be centered
around r = 0, we would expect <r(0)r(x)> ~ 0 if there are
no regional rate biases (see Methods). We detected no
apparent autocorrelation for species pairs from any of
these 22 genomes (Data for the S. cerevisiae-S. paradoxus
species pair, which is typical, is shown in Figure 3a). Thus
these fungal species do not exhibit the regional mutation
structure that has been observed in mammals.
Three Candida yeasts have heterogeneous mutation rates
Species pairs from two fungal clades [(C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis) and (N. crassa, C. globosum)] were
found to have r distributions that do not fit the Normal
curve. These species have wider r distributions (2.07 ≤ σ ≤
2.20) (Figures 1c and 2).

For the three Candida species, autocorrelation analysis
indicates that substitution rates are significantly corre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/186

lated for genes within 50,000 base pairs of each other (Figure 3b). This implies that C. albicans regional biases
extend over scales encompassing ~20 genes, as the spacing
between genes is 2300 bp [17]. The neighboring gene
Pearson correlations were also found to be highly significant (C. dubliniensis/C. albicans Pearson correlation =
0.218, p = 6.4 × 10-42; C. tropicalis/C. dubliniensis Pearson
correlation = 0.103, p = 9.8 × 10-10). These regional biases
are not due to a CpG dinucleotide effect. When we
excluded CpG sites from the analysis, neighboring genes
were still observed to have correlated substitution rates
(Pearson-correlation = 0.1096, p < 10-8). These Candida
species translate CUG as serine instead of the usual leucine, and it might be hypothesized that this alternate
codon usage is relevant to the rate inferences [18]. However, ignoring such codons does not significantly diminish the correlation (C. dubliniensis/C. albicans Pearson
correlation = 0.208, p = 10-27).
N. crassa and C. globosum substitution rates are skewed
by strong codon usage bias
As in the Candida species, substitution rates between N.
crassa and C. globosum give an r distribution wider than the
Normal Gaussian. However, there is no significant correlation (Pearson correlation = -0.0085, p = 0.6757)
between neighboring genes, and the autocorrelation plot
is similar to those of the fungi with uniform rates (data
not shown). These results suggest that the wide rate distribution (σ = 2.07) is due to pressures on individual genes,
rather than regional effects.

We hypothesized that the large σ without apparent
regional correlation could be due to increased selection
on the silent sites of N. crassa and C. globosum genes. Such
selection could cause some genes to have more extreme
conservation and thus broaden the rate distribution. To
test this, we considered the codon usage bias in these species, as this is the best understood type of silent site selection in yeasts.
Our results indicate that codon usage selection is a more
widespread effect in N. crassa than in the sensu stricto
yeasts (Figure 4) (or than in C. albicans, Additional file 2).
Codon adaptation index (CAI) [19] values were calculated
for N. crassa and S. cerevisiae based on their respective
codon biases. N. crassa genes generally have higher CAI
values (median 0.63) than S. cerevisiae genes (median
0.14). In each of the graphs, there is one main cluster of
genes with r scattered around zero and with low CAI values. There is also another group having negative r and
high CAI, indicating codon usage selection. N. crassa has
more genes in the group apparently subject to codon
usage selection (949 genes above CAI = 0.7) than S. cerevisiae (121 genes above CAI = 0.4). This suggests that
codon usage selection affects more genes in N. crassa/C.

The only species pairs with a significant Pearson correlation (<0.001) are those among C. dubliniensis, C. albicans, and C. tropicalis (shown in bold).
This indicates that virtually all fungal genomes have uniform mutation rates. Average divergence is the fraction of all aligned 4-fold sites which differ
between the two species. Species pairs in italics and marked with a * have at least 10% fewer substitutions than would be expected at mutational
saturation.

globosum, which could explain the larger σ for these
genomes (See Discussion).
All mammals have heterogeneous mutation rates
All 20 mammalian species were found to have strong
regional mutation rates, as evidenced by the wide mammalian rate distributions (1.80 ≤ σ ≤ 2.23) (Figures 1a and
2). The Pearson correlation (Figure 6) of neighboring
genes was found to be significant for every pairwise mammalian comparison. Autocorrelation analysis indicates
that the length scales of mutational blocks are similar in
the various branches of the mammalian phylogeny as
well. For example, in the cow/human comparison (Figure
5), the autocorrelation graph suggests mutational blocks
along each chromosome as large as 10 Mb, similar to the
length scale that has been observed in mouse and human.

The regional variations are also apparent from correlation
analysis of ancestral repeats, another largely neutral dataset scattered throughout the genome [20]. We analyzed
16-way vertebrate multispecies alignments from
genome.ucsc.edu to obtain a set of ancestral repeats
aligned orthologously across the species pairs (human,

macaque), (mouse, rat), (elephant, tenrec), and (dog,
cow). For each species pair we observed that an ancestral
repeat's substitution rate is correlated with the neighboring ancestral repeat along the genome (Table 2). In each
case the significance of the correlation was at the limit of
computational precision (p < 10-276). The rate distributions for repeats are also wider than the Normal, with
standard deviations ranging from 1.41 (elephant-tenrec)
to 1.96 (human-macaque) (Figures 1a and 1c).
Insects have heterogeneous mutation rates
The fungal species we have studied are at phylogenetic distances generally larger than those for the mammalian species. As species approach saturated divergence, mutation
rate inferences become more uncertain. Therefore one
might be concerned that the greater divergences for fungal
species pairs could be obscuring regional effects. This
hypothesis can be tested using insect genomes. Drosophila
melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura are about as
diverged (4-fold divergence = 0.514) as most fungal pairs,
but are more diverged than the mammalian species pairs.
This is also true for the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and
Anopheles gambiae (4-fold divergence = 0.632).

Autocorrelation of normalized substitution rates r for the S. cerevisiae/S. paradoxus (a) and C. dubliniensis/C. albicans (b) pairwise
Figure
analyses3
Autocorrelation of normalized substitution rates r for the S. cerevisiae/S. paradoxus (a) and C. dubliniensis/C.
albicans (b) pairwise analyses. The C. dubliniensis/C. albicans plot shows that substitution rates of neighboring genes are correlated up to 50 kb apart. This contrasts with the lack of correlation at any distance for the S. cerevisiae/S. paradoxus plot. Analogous graphs were produced for all fungal species pairs, and no significant autocorrelation was found, except for the C.
dubliniensis/C. albicans and C. tropicalis/C. dubliniensis comparisons.

However, unlike most fungi, flies and mosquitoes show
clear regional effects. D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
have significant rate correlations between neighboring
genes (Pearson correlation = 0.1642, p = 10-58) and have
a wide r distribution (σ = 2.152). Autocorrelation analysis
indicates that correlations persist out to at least 1 Mb (data
not shown). This conclusion of mutational heterogeneity
is consistent with studies of transposon mutation within
D. melanogaster [21]. Rate correlations between neighboring genes are also apparent in comparisons of Aedes
aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (Pearson correlation =
0.2099, p = 10-89, σ = 1.804). These insect correlations are
stronger than that for C. albicans-C. dubliniensis, despite
the fact that the two Candida species have a lower divergence (0.289). We conclude that the general lack of correlations for the fungi is unrelated to the magnitude of their
phylogenetic separations.

Genes with low substitution rates throughout the
mammalian phylogeny
While these themes of mutational heterogeneity and uniformity can describe much of the behavior of silent sites
in genes, our data also reveal certain types of genes whose
silent substitution rates suggest selective pressures. For
example, it has been observed that genes involved in gene
regulation tend to have few silent substitutions among
human, mouse, cow, and dog, while genes interacting
with the extracellular environment tend to have many
substitutions [2,22]. We have tested the generality of such
observations throughout the mammalian phylogeny.

For each mammalian species pair, a list of Gene Ontology
[23] categories with unusually high or low silent site substitution rates was calculated. Unusual categories were
identified by aggregating the r values from all genes in the
GO category into a z-score zGO (see Methods). Positive zGO
values indicate that a category has above average substitu-

Graphs of Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) vs. normalized substitution rates. Data for the sensu stricto yeasts (S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. mikatae, S. paradoxus) (right) and for N. crassa-C. globosum (left) are both shown. Although the r distribution
for N. crassa-C. globosum (Fig 1c) is wider than a Normal distribution, this appears to be due to a large number of genes under
codon usage selection, rather than regional mutational biases. Genes under codon usage bias tend to have low z-scores and
high CAI values (red ellipse), while the remaining genes have low CAI values and r values centered around zero (yellow ellipse).
N. crassa has a much larger number of genes in the cluster likely to be under codon usage selection (949 genes with CAI≥0.70,
red ellipse) than does S. cerevisiae (121 genes with CAI≥0.40), suggesting that more genes are under codon usage selection in
N. crassa.

tion and negative values indicate below average substitution.
We observed four GO categories with unusually low substitution rates (zGO negative and statistically significant)
across almost all mammalian species pairs (Figure 6). For
the categories "regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent," "RNA binding," and "nucleus", every mammalian
species is involved in at least one pair in which these categories have a significantly depressed rate. The category
"transcriptional activator activity" has a low substitution
rate in every comparison except for the outlier species
opossum-platypus. As an illustration of the strength of
this effect, the GO category "regulation of transcription,
DNA-dependent" contains 1224 genes with a zGO of 8.893 (p = 10-18) for the mouse-human species pair, and
for the cow-dog species pair the category has a zGO of 7.182 (p = 10-12). It cannot be ruled out that RNA binding
and DNA binding genes sit in slowly mutating regions in
every species. However, given the large number of diverse
lineages involved, as well as previous studies indicating
that some of these genes contain ultraconserved blocks
more than a hundred bp long [24], a simpler explanation
is that these genes contain functional silent sites (see Discussion). Interestingly, even in the sensu stricto yeasts (S.
cerevisiae-S. paradoxus) and (S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus), the
categories RNA binding and nucleotide binding have unusually low substitution rates. Thus silent sites in nucleotide binding genes are likely to be under selection in
both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. This does

not seem to merely be due to these yeast categories containing genes under codon usage selection. In the comparison between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, the overall zGO
for the nucleotide binding category is -7.320, and it is 6.686 (still highly significant) when all genes in the glycolysis GO category are removed.
Genes with high substitution rates throughout the
mammalian phylogeny
It has previously been observed that genes which interact
directly with the environment have high silent substitution rates in mouse-human comparisons, and we found
that this is generally true among the mammals. While we
found no GO category with unusually high substitution
rate (zGO positive and statistically significant) in every
mammalian species pair, there was considerable similarity across species. 17 out of the 26 mammalian species
pairs have at least one high zGO category with "receptor
activity" in the description (Figure 6). 15 have "olfactory
receptor activity", 23 have "metabolic process", 10 have
"membrane", and 9 have "sensory perception" and/or
"sensory perception of smell". These annotations repeatedly occur in distinct clades. For example, the category
"olfactory receptor activity" has a significant zGO for the
species pairs armadillo-elephant, mouse-rabbit, opossum-platypus, human-macaque, and common shrew-tree
shrew, among others. Such genes appear to often be clustered in tandem arrays in primate genomes, though such
clustering is not as prevalent in other mammals.

Figure 5
Autocorrelation of normalized substitution rates r for cow-dog (a) and human-macaque (b)
Autocorrelation of normalized substitution rates r for cow-dog (a) and human-macaque (b). In each species pair,
nearby genes have correlated silent site substitution rates even at distances up to 10 Mb. These lengthy regional biases are typical of mammalian genomes, and are much larger than those of the Candida fungi.

The primate clade has strong consistency in the categories
with high zGO. We found 10 high zGO categories in common among the four primate species pairs (macaquebushbaby), (human-bushbaby), (human-macaque), and
(macaque-chimp). However, we found no such categories
consistent throughout species pairs of the clade (rat,
mouse, squirrel, rabbit) or the clade (cat, dog, cow, bat,
hedgehog, shrew). This may be related to the fact that primates are a more closely related group.
Could the high substitution rates in receptor genes be
related to diversifying selection on the protein sequences
of such genes? This could be responsible if protein
changes have reduced the cross-species alignability of
such genes and artifactually increased silent site substitution rates in misaligned regions. To test this, we recalculated rates using only 4-fold sites at least 3 codons away
from any indel in the alignment. With these rates, we still
observed 16 mammalian lineages having at least one
"receptor activity" category with an unusually high zGO.
This robustness shows that the high substitution rates in

receptor genes are not due to diversifying selection at the
amino acid level but are instead a separate effect.
Genes with unusual substitution rates in the fungi
As discussed above, codon usage selection is the clearest
determinant of low silent site substitution in the fungi.
The GO category "translation" has the lowest zGO in the
sensu stricto yeasts (S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus zGO = -11.995),
and it also has a low zGO in C. albicans-C. dubliniensis (zGO
= -4.617). Six low-rate categories are consistent among (C.
albicans-C. dubliniensis), (C. dubliniensis-C. tropicalis), (S.
cerevisiae-S. bayanus) and (S. cerevisiae-S. paradoxus):
"translation", "unfolded protein binding", "structural
constituent of ribosome", "ribosome", "glycolysis", and
"chitin- and beta-glucan-containing cell wall"), and these
categories are largely consistent with codon usage selection.

However, we also found several other C. albicans-C. dubliniensis categories with much stronger silent site conservation than "translation," suggesting other types of silent
site selection. The categories with the lowest zGO are

Pearson correlation of substitution rates between neighboring mammalian genes and evidence of selective
pressures. 20 mammalian species and 26 species pairs are shown. In striking contrast to the fungi, every mammalian comparison gives a highly significant correlation between rates of neighboring genes (column 7). (Right) Similar types of genes have unusually low or unusually high silent substitution rates across the mammals, suggesting universal selection pressures. Genes in the
categories RNA binding, regulation of transcription – DNA dependent, nucleus, or transcriptional activator activity (blue text)
have unusually low silent substitution rates in virtually every mammalian species pair, as marked by ovals. Gene associated with
receptor activity have unusually high silent substitution rates (red text) in most mammalian species pairs.

In all four mammalian pairs considered (human-macaque), (dog-cow), (elephant-tenrec), and (rat-mouse), the correlations were extremely
significant (<10-276). This supports the widespread heterogeneity of mutation rates in mammalian genomes.

tion only because of codon usage selection. After removing all genes also found in categories involving glycolysis
from the GO groups "soluble fraction", "yeast-form cell
wall" and "interaction with host", each category maintains a significant negative z-score.

where the replication timing is static, mutational heterogeneities would manifest as heterogeneities in the crossspecies substitution rates. An experiment that compares
switching of replication timing in Candida and Saccharomyces loci would be an exciting way to test this prediction.

Few fungal gene categories were found to have high zGO
values. This is not surprising for the sensu stricto yeasts,
given their mutational uniformity. We found only one
category with a significant positive z-score in both S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae-S. paradoxus, and its pvalue is marginal (transcription factor activity, Bonferroni-corrected p-value = 0.9216). We also found few Candida categories with unusually high substitution rates,
despite their mutational heterogeneity. C. albicans-C. dubliniensis and C. dubliniensis-C. tropicalis share one category
with a significant positive zGO ("response to pH"), and C.
albicans-C. dubliniensis has the additional category "cell
adhesion". Interestingly, the "cell adhesion" category has
a higher average nonsynonymous substitution rate (Ka)
than the genome-wide average (0.2234 vs. 0.0857). Thus
these cell adhesion genes are analogous to mammalian
receptor genes, which tend to have both high synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates [2].

A comparison of N. crassa and C. globosum also gives an
excessively wide distribution of normalized substitution
rates, but this is due to stronger codon usage selection,
rather than regional mutation effects. This strong codon
usage selection is more apparent in the context of the
mutational defense mechanism RIP [27] that N. crassa
employs against selfish DNA. RIP (repeat-induced point
mutation), inactivates selfish DNA by inducing G:C to A:T
mutations in sequences that occur repetitively in the
genome. This process affects all duplicated regions –
except for ribosomal RNA genes, even though these occur
in large copy number [28]. This observation is consistent
with ribosomal genes being under strong codon usage
selection that shields them from the effects of RIP. Meanwhile, RIP drives other duplicated genes in N. crassa to
unusually high substitution rates, which would increase
the genes with high r in the rate distribution.

Discussion
Based on our examination of 20 mammalian species, we
conclude that all mammals have regional biases of neutral
mutation rates. While the factors controlling these
regional biases are still not well understood [1], our findings indicate that any causal variables must prevail
throughout the mammalian phylogeny. In contrast, we
find that almost all fungi have a uniform neutral mutation
rate. It is worth noting that our fungal phylogeny covers a
broader range of divergence than the mammals, giving
this shared behavior more significance. However, the
monophyletic group of Candida species (C. albicans, C.
dubliniensis, and C. tropicalis) is an exception to the other
fungi. Rate distributions and gene-to-gene correlations
indicate that these species have heterogeneous mutation
rates along their genomes, a trait which has not previously
been observed outside species with much larger genomes.
Previous C. albicans SNP studies have indicated hotspots
of polymorphism, supporting our conclusion of regional
biases [25,26].
What characteristic sets these three yeasts apart from the
others? Of relevance is a recent study showing that S. cerevisiae polymorphisms arise more often in regions that
replicate late in the cell cycle (G. Lang and A. Murray, personal communication). This finding can be reconciled
with our observation of uniformity of Saccharomyces divergence rates, if replication timing is mutable – i.e. provided
the replication timing of a locus switches faster than a polymorphism fixes in the population. However, in species

We have observed that genes interacting with the extracellular environment, especially receptors and olfactory
genes, tend to have high substitution rates in many mammalian lineages. This is in agreement with previous findings in comparisons of human and mouse [2], and it
suggests a recurring interplay between local mutation rate
and receptor genes. Residence in a region of high mutation rate may be useful for speeding up the diversification
of receptor protein sequences and improving the evolvability of the organism [29]. An alternative explanation is
that the silent sites could themselves be under diversifying
selection, though it is unclear why receptor gene silent
sites would be more disposed to such an effect.
We have also found that the silent sites of genes associated
with RNA binding and DNA binding are strongly conserved in not only every mammalian species but also the
sensu stricto yeasts. This expands similar findings in which
mammalian genes have been found to have blocks over a
hundred bp long strongly conserved across the mouse, rat,
human, and dog genomes [22,24,30]. Given the large evolutionary divergences spanned by these species and the
tendency of mutation rates to change over time (H. Imamura, J. Karro, and J. Chuang, in preparation), it seems
unlikely that these consistently low substitution rates are
due to regional background effects in every species. A simpler explanation is that synonymous sites are commonly
functional in such genes throughout the eukaryotic phylogeny.

Conclusion
Among the 51 species studied in this work, all characterized mammals and insects exhibit regional biases in the
mutation rates along their genomes, based on the substitution rates in gene synonymous sites. In contrast, virtually all fungi show uniform mutation rates. One fungal
clade, the Candida, is the exception, as the only fungal
clade with regional mutational biases. Further analysis of
these genomes should be valuable for revealing what features control local mutation rates. Also, in decomposing
neutral and selective effects at synonymous site we found
classes of genes whose synonymous sites have been commonly influenced by selection. Most notably, there
appears to have been widespread purifying selection in
regulatory genes and frequent diversifying selection in
receptor genes throughout mammalian history.

Methods
Ortholog generation
For the fungal analysis, FASTA files of coding regions and
an ortholog tree listing predicted gene relationships
between all fungal species were obtained as described in
[31]. Mammalian and mosquito genes were obtained
using the ENSEMBL BioMart (release 45) database. Fly
CDS and peptide files were downloaded from FlyBase
(version FB2006_01). For the fly species, the amino acid
sequences were run through BLAST and tagged as true
orthologs if they were each other's mutual best hit when
applying BLASTALL with a worst-case E-value cutoff of 1010.
Calculation of substitution rates
Our substitution rate calculations parallel those in previous works [2,9]. Nucleotide sequences of orthologous
coding regions were translated into amino acid residues,
aligned using CLUSTALW, and then back-translated to
determine the aligned DNA sequence. The fourfold synonymous sites – the third base in a codon for which the
amino acid is determined by the first two positions – were
analyzed. If a sequence contained fewer than 20 fourfold
sites before occurrence of a stop codon, the entire
sequence was discarded. To ensure equivalent sequence
context, only fourfold sites for which both the preceding
and succeeding base matched for the two species were
considered.

The raw neutral substitution rate was calculated based on
the fraction of observed differences at silent sites within a
gene. Individual gene rates were then normalized in order
to correct for the finite-size of each gene, and this new rate
was defined to be
r = (p-<p>)/s(N),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/186

where p is the observed 4-fold substitution rate for the
gene in question and <p> is the average substitution rate
for all ortholog pairs for the two species in question. s(N)
is the expected standard deviation for a gene with N independent fourfold sites, i.e. s(N) = (<p>(1-<p>)/N)1/2. The
distribution of normalized substitution rates would be
expected to follow a normal Gaussian (f(x) = e-x*x/2/
√(2π)) if each fourfold site was mutating at the same rate
and independently of each other. This z-score normalization corrects for the finite-size effects that result from
genes having different numbers of 4-fold sites.
One caveat to our approach (and any measurement of
sequence divergence) is that divergence measurements
lose power when comparing species with saturated divergence. However the large majority of species pairs
described here are at sequence divergences considerably
below saturation.
For every species pair described, we calculated the
expected divergence at saturation as 1 −

∑ f i(1) f i(2) ,
i = ACGT

where f i(1) and f i(2) are the frequencies of base i in species
1 and 2, respectively. The variation in this quantity is relatively small, ranging from 0.6634 (C. dubliniensis-C. tropicalis) to 0.7519 (opossum-platypus). As is visible from
Tables 1 and 2, all of the mammalian comparisons are
considerably below saturation. Each of the mammalian
comparisons is at least 600 standard deviations less substituted than what would be expected if every 4-fold site
were substituted independently at the saturated probability. While the fungi are generally at greater distances, a
number are still below the saturated expectation. All yeast
comparisons (with the exception of E. gossypii-S. pombe)
are several dozen standard deviations below the saturated
rate expected from an independent-sites model. More
strongly, there are 10 species pairs with divergences at
least 10% below the saturated substitution level (Table 1).
These include representatives from several independent
clades all with substitution rates below 0.60, including U.
reesii/C. immitis, N. crassa/C. globosum, the Saccharomyces
yeasts, and the Candida yeasts.
A potential concern is that sequence alignments could be
less reliable for the fungal species, given their large
sequence divergences. We therefore recalculated all of the
fungal substitution rates using only high quality regions
of the pairwise alignments, which we defined to be a concatenation of blocks containing a minimum of 10 consecutive aligned amino acids with no gaps. We then
compared the original substitution rates to those rates
obtained from the restricted high quality alignments. For
Page 11 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:186

the 26 pairs, all had a correlation of greater than 0.80 (pvalues < 10-146) with the original results, and 16 had correlations greater than .90. Thus we do not expect that
alignment quality is a concern.
Correlation calculations
We tested whether or not neighboring genes had similar
substitution rates by calculating a Pearson correlation
between the rate of gene r(0) and the rate of gene r(x)
which is located x base pairs downstream. Gene pairs in
orthologous blocks up to the 35th gene downstream from
the starting gene were considered. Blocks were determined
by genes located on the same chromosome (scaffolds
were used when chromosomal data was not available).
Correlations were measured twice, in each case using location data from one of the species, except in cases where
location data was available in only one species. For the
fungi, the data for each pairwise calculation was binned
into 50 uniformly spaced groups covering x = [0, 300000]
and averaged over each bin to determine the autocorrelation function <r(0)r(x)>. Error bars were assigned based
on the standard deviation of the values in each bin. For
the larger genomes of mammals and insects, data was
binned into 200 groups where x ranged from 0 to 15 Mb.
CAI
CodonW (Peden 1999) was downloaded and used to calculate the CAI values for the fungal species. The input file
for each species was a CDS FASTA file of all genes (predicted and known) and the background CAI was set to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the sensu stricto calculation in
Figure 4. The S. cerevisiae sequence and codon preferences
were used to compute the CAI values. The EMBOSS package was also downloaded locally. This includes codon
usage tables for a number of species including N. crassa
[32] and C. albicans. This table was used to calculate the
CAI for the genes in Figure 4 and Additional file 2. Sensu
stricto substitution rates in Figure 4 were taken from [9].
z-score calculation for GO analysis
GO assignments were taken from ENSEMBL annotations
of the orthologous human gene. While this eliminates
orthologs that do not have an ortholog in human, only a
small minority of genes are affected by this problem. For
example, of 7,959 GO annotated gene products for cow,
only 447 (1.5%) do not have a human ortholog. A z-score
and p-value was assigned to each GO category based on
the substitution rates for all of the genes included in the
category.

The z-score (zGO), calculated for each GO category based
on the substitution rates of all members within the group,
was defined to be
zGO : = (<r>GO - <r>all)/(sall/√NGO)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/186

where <r>GO is the average substitution rate for the genes
in the GO category and <r>all is the average substitution
rate for all genes. sall is the standard deviation of the <r>all
data set and NGO is the number of genes in that particular
GO category. The p-value for the zGO calculated for an
ontology group is the probability that a Gaussian-distributed variable would be represented by a value ≥ zGO. The
p-value cutoff was set to be 1/X where X is the number of
GO categories (with a minimum of 5 genes). The significance was then expressed in terms of -log10(p-value).
