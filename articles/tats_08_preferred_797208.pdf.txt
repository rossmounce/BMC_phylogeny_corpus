Abstract
Background: Alternative synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies. In addition,
the contexts of codons – neighboring nucleotides and neighboring codons – can have certain
patterns. The codon context can influence both translational accuracy and elongation rates.
However, it is not known how strong or conserved the codon context preferences in different
organisms are. We analyzed 138 organisms (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes) to find conserved
patterns of codon pairs.
Results: After removing the effects of single codon usage and dipeptide biases we discovered a set
of neighboring codons for which avoidances or preferences were conserved in all three domains
of life. Such biased codon pairs could be divided into subtypes on the basis of the nucleotide
patterns that influence the bias. The most frequently avoided type of codon pair was nnUAnn. We
discovered that 95.7% of avoided nnUAnn type patterns contain out-frame UAA or UAG triplets
on the sense and/or antisense strand. On average, nnUAnn codon pairs are more frequently
avoided in ORFeomes than in genomes. Thus we assume that translational selection plays a major
role in the avoidance of these codon pairs. Among the preferred codon pairs, nnGCnn was the
major type.
Conclusion: Translational selection shapes codon pair usage in protein coding sequences by rules
that are common to all three domains of life. The most frequently avoided codon pairs contain the
patterns nnUAnn, nnGGnn, nnGnnC, nnCGCn, GUCCnn, CUCCnn, nnCnnA or UUCGnn. The
most frequently preferred codon pairs contain the patterns nnGCnn, nnCAnn or nnUnCn.

Background
The frequencies of synonymous codons in protein coding
sequences are biased and different organisms tend to use
different sets of synonymous codons. In addition, other
codons are juxtaposed non-randomly with each codon.
These preferences are typically referred to as codon context biases. It is suggested that codon context biases are
associated with translational efficiency, since codon context influences translational elongation rates [1]. Moreo-

ver, experimental results support the observation that
codon context is more strongly related to translational
efficiency than single codon usage [1]. A second important parameter that is influenced by codon context is
translational accuracy. Codon context can influence both
mis-sense and nonsense suppression [2-7]. In addition,
codons in combination with surrounding nucleotides can
form mononucleotide repeats, which may cause transcriptional [8,9] or translational [10] slippage. Frameshift

errors on 'hungry' codons in specific nucleotide contexts
also increase under starvation conditions [11]. Several
programmed frameshifting sites have been described in
the coding regions of mRNAs from different organisms
(e.g. [12,13]). Such sites are used for regulating gene
expression through recoding. Nevertheless, frameshifting
errors are rare events in most sequences, occurring with a
frequency less than once every 10,000 codons [14]. This
means that sequences that are prone to frameshifting are
successfully avoided in coding sequences. For example, it
has been shown that certain heptanucleotides that are
prone to frameshifts are under-represented in the coding
sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [15] and Escherichia
coli [10].
There have been many studies analyzing codon pair biases
in a limited number of species [16-21]. The main selective
effects on codon context are found in the nucleotides following the codon in the 3' direction [16,18,19,22]. It has
been found that the specific preferred or avoided nucleotide patterns differ among species [16,22].
The only large-scale comparative analysis to date suggested that the codon context in eukaryotes is biased
because target sequences for DNA methylation and trinucleotide repeats are present at high frequencies, while in
bacteria and archaea the codon context is influenced
mainly by the translational machinery [22].
Since the structure and function of the ribosomal decoding centre are highly conserved in evolution, we could
expect that avoidance of and preference for certain
sequence contexts would also be conserved in the protein
coding sequences of different organisms. Previous studies
suggest that the effects of codon context are influenced by
the physical interactions between tRNA isoacceptors in
the ribosomal P- and A-sites [1,16,23]. It has been shown
that in five gamma proteobacteria, Bacillus subtilis and two
yeasts, the A-site codons decoded by the same tRNA have
similar patterns of P-site codon pairing preference [16]. In
addition, it has been confirmed that E-site occupation is
essential for preventing frameshift [24-26]. It was shown
recently that the species specific combinations of three
consecutive codons are highly biased among fungal species and even reaching to the complete vanishing of certain combinations [27]. This study is a comparative
analysis of the usage of neighboring and more distant
codon pairs in 138 randomly selected organisms belonging to different domains of life. We show that certain
codon context biases are conserved in the protein coding
sequences of different species. Most of them are probably
influenced by translational rather than DNA-related
mechanisms.

Results
Definition of conserved biased codon pair
To study the common rules of codon context bias we
looked for codon pairs that are significantly preferred or
avoided in the three domains of life. These conserved
cases of biased codon pairs are most probably caused by
conserved molecular mechanisms and may perhaps shed
light on the mechanisms shaping the genes and genomes.
In this study a preferred or avoided codon pair was designated a "conserved biased codon pair" if it was statistically
significantly avoided or preferred in more than 50% of the
organisms studied. This criterion is likely the reason why
we found many more conserved codon pairs as opposed
to other findings [22], where the universal rules were
searched only among the first ten most conserved codon
pairs in each separate domain.

The significance of the bias of each codon pair in each
genome was calculated by comparing the observed and
expected occurrences of that pair in the open reading
frames (ORFs) of a given genome (see Methods). It is
important to emphasize that the expected frequency of a
codon pair represents the random co-occurrences of two
codons, not the expected frequency of the corresponding
hexanucleotide. This means that the significantly overrepresented co-occurrence of two codons does not necessarily imply that the corresponding hexanucleotide
sequences occur with high frequency.
It is known that proteins contain certain dipeptides at
increased and reduced frequencies [17]. To ensure that the
effects observed at the codon pair level were not caused by
avoidances or preferences of dipeptides, the expected
codon pairs values were normalized to the dipeptide frequencies (see Methods). This aspect was not considered in
previous studies [21,22].
On the basis of that criterion, we found 288 neighboring
codon pairs (1–2 codon pairs) that were preferred or
avoided in most of the organisms studied [Additional files
1, 2]. We also tested the conservation of more distant (1–
3, 1–4, 1–5) codon pairs. However, for codons 1–3 we
found only one codon pair with significant bias –
GGUnnnGGU – which was over-represented in 61% of
the organisms studied. No conserved biases were found
for more distant codon pairs. Thus, all the following analyses are based on neighboring (1–2) codon pairs.
Method for comparing ORFeomes and genomes
The most straightforward method for testing the translational effects of under- and over-representation of a codon
pair would be to compare its avoidances and preferences
in the correct reading frame and in two other reading
frames. In such a comparison, however, one cannot effectively remove the influence of single codon preferences or

amino acid preferences on the avoidance/preference of
codon pairs in other frames. Thus, we consider the comparison of effects in +1 and +2 reading frames biased and
incorrect, so we compare the effects in the ORFeome and
genome instead.
Therefore, to test whether codon pairs are biased because
of translational effects or because of mechanisms operating at the DNA level, we calculated the ratio of observed
and expected co-occurrences of two trinucleotides at the
genome level. If the main selective force for codon pair
usage were related to translational effects at the ribosome
and not to biases in mechanisms operating at DNA level,
the codon pair bias would be stronger in ORFeomes than
in genomes. Some conserved under-represented codon
pairs contained the stop-codon in +1 or +2 frame. Corresponding trimers cannot occur in one of the frames in
genomic regions where they overlap ORFs. This reduced
frequency of occurrence was taken into account when the
ratio of observed to expected co-occurrences of trimers in
genomes was determined.
Under-represented codon pairs can be divided into 9 major
types
We identified 207 codon pairs that were avoided in the
ORFs of more than half the organisms studied (Table 1,
[additional file 1]). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms causing these avoidances, we tried to find recurring
sub-patterns in the conserved biased codon pairs and to
classify them according to those sub-patterns. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the effects (observed/expected

ratio) of pentamers, tetramers, trimers and dimers cannot
be compared directly with that of codon pairs because the
number, and therefore the variation in magnitude of
effect, differs markedly among sub-patterns of different
lengths [Additional file 3]. To overcome this problem we
calculated the standard deviation for each sub-pattern
family and used it to normalize the magnitudes of effects.
This led to a score for each codon pair and sub-pattern
that described the divergence of the observed/expected
ratio from the mean in units of standard deviation. This
score is traditionally called the z-score. Z-scores make subpatterns of different lengths more comparable to each
other and can be used to identify the sub-pattern level on
which the effect is strongest.
The avoided codon pairs could be divided into 9 major
groups (Table 2, [additional file 4]). The most abundant
types of under-represented pairs were nnUAnn (Type 1A).
Among the avoided nnUAnn codon pairs, 75.7% were
more strongly avoided on average in the ORFeome than
in the genome (Table 2). This suggests that selection for
nnUAnn avoidance occurs mainly at the translational
level. This universal effect is clearly visible in the human
genome, where the nnUAnn type codon pairs were also
less frequent than expected (77.1% of nnUAnn type pairs
were more strongly avoided in the human ORFeome than
in the genome).
Many of the nnUAnn type patterns contained codon pairs
with stop codons in -1 frame on the sense strand (67%,
47/70). For such pairs, a -1 frameshift event would create
premature translational termination. Thus, we assume
that avoidance of nnUAnn codon pairs is partly related to
out-frame stop codons. On the other hand, avoidance of
the UA dinucleotide between two codons also has a role
here, because out-frame UGA stop-codons were not
observed in any of the conserved biased dicodon pairs.
Interestingly, 83% (58/70) of the nnUAnn type patterns
contained out-frame UAA and UAG triplets on the antisense strand. However, there are no known mechanisms
that could explain the avoidance of UAA and UAG triplets
in the middle of nnUAnn type hexamers on the antisense
strand.
Including the antisense strand, almost all (67/70, 95.7%)
of the nnUAnn type patterns contained UAA or UAG in 1 frame, although nnUAnn could code for other hexamers
containing UAU and UAC in 25% of cases. Only three of
the type 1A codon pairs did not contain out-frame UAA or
UAG. All three began with GGUA and did not show strong
avoidance on the ORFeome level. Those three pairs may
not be related to the same kind of avoidances as all other
type 1A codon pairs [Additional file 4].

The percentage of codon pairs of the corresponding pattern among all conserved avoided codon pairs is shown. For specific codon pairs of each
type see [additional file 4].

The second most abundant type of conserved avoided
codon pair was nnGnnC (type 2A), which was more
strongly avoided in ORFeomes than in genomes. The
third type, type 3A contained the pattern nnCGCn. Avoidance of mononucleotide repeats such as GGGGGn,
GGGGnn, nCCCCn and UUUUUU was also conserved in
most organisms (Type 8A). UUUUUU was clearly avoided
in ORFeomes but was significantly preferred at the
genome level (Table 2).
The most conserved avoided codon pair was UUCGCA
(type 6A, UUCGnn), which was under-represented in 86%
of the organisms studied. It is interesting to note that this
codon pair contains several clearly avoided sub-patterns
(UUCGnn, nnCGCn, nnCnnA). The observed/expected
ratios of this pair in the ORFeome and genome indicated
that UUCGCA was similarly under-represented on both
the ORFeome and genome levels (Table 1).
Interestingly, among the different avoided sub-patterns
causing the conserved avoidance of codon pairs, the last
nucleotide of the P-site codon in a pair was always fixed
(the only exception was the pattern UnnnnU for codon
pair UUUUUU).
Over-represented codon pairs can be divided into 4 types
We found 81 codon pairs that were over-represented in
more than half the organisms studied (Table 3, [additional file 2]). Four major preferred types can be
described: nnGCnn, nnCAnn, nnUUnn and nnUnCn
(Table 4). The most abundant type of conserved over-represented codon pair was nnGCnn (Type 1P). All the major
types were more strongly over-represented in ORFeomes
than in genomes, again indicating that the common preference of codon pairs that we detected is mainly influenced by translational mechanisms. The most conserved
preferred codon pair, GGGCUU, was over-represented in
76% of the organisms studied and also belonged to Type
1P.

As in the conserved avoided codon pairs, all the different
preferred sub-patterns that caused codon pair preferences
contained a fixed last nucleotide of the P-site codon in the
pair.
Phylogenetic distribution of the conserved codon context
patterns
How are the most preferred and avoided codon pairs distributed among different phylogenetic classes of organisms? To estimate the distribution of biased codon pairs
between phylogenetic groups we built a cluster map of all
codon pairs in the organisms studied (Figure 1). It can be
seen that the most avoided and the most preferred codon
pairs are uniformly distributed across all three domains of
life. To investigate this more closely, we plotted the ten

most conserved and under-represented and the ten most
conserved and over-represented codon pairs against a
phylogenetically organized list of all the organisms studied (Figures 2 and 3). Although phylogenetically very
close species tend to have similar codon pair usage, no
major phylogenetic group-specific distribution was
observed. This indicates that the under- and over-represented codon pairs are indeed uniformly distributed.
Five genomes had atypical sets of biased codon pairs
Interestingly, five organisms showed significant bias in
fewer than five of the top 20 codon pairs (Figures 2 and
3). This raised the question: do those five genomes have
different sets of most-biased codon pairs, do they lack
strong codon pair biases as such, or do we just lack the statistical power to detect biased codon pairs in them?

To distinguish among these possibilities we calculated the
percentage of biased codon pairs in all the genomes under
study. It appeared that those five organisms can be split
into two groups. Aeropyrum pernix, Methanopyrus kandleri
and Nanoarchaeum equitans had a considerable number of
biased codon pairs (Figure 3), indicating that these organisms use a different set of biased codon pairs from the
conserved set. However, Buchnera aphidicola and Candidatus blochmannia pensilvanicus had bias in only 2.0% and
2.3% of codon pairs, respectively, as compared to the
average 37.7% (Figure 2). This suggests that those
genomes either essentially lack codon pair bias or we lack
the statistical power to detect their biased codon pairs. The
genomes of B. aphidicola and C. blochmannia were also
among the smallest in our study. It is possible that smaller
genomes do not have enough codon pairs to reach statistical significance under the criteria we applied. Indeed,
larger genomes appeared to contain larger fractions of
biased codon pairs than smaller genomes (Figure 4A).
Could the small number of biased codon pairs in B.
aphidicola and C. blochmannia simply be the result of a low
detection limit in small genomes?
To answer this question, we created a dataset containing
150,000 randomly sampled codon pairs from all the
genomes studied. This should correspond to the genome
size 0.45 Mb, which is close to the smallest genome in our
set. Using this standardized genome dataset we calculated

how many codon pairs would still remain significantly
biased (Figures 2 and 3). The results show that genome
size indeed has a statistical effect on the number of biased
codon pairs detected. The fraction of biased codon pairs
leveled off after genome reduction (Figure 4B). However,
the same figure also demonstrates that genome size was
not the reason why B. aphidicola and C. blochmannia have
low numbers of biased codon pairs. Even in the standardized sample, most other genomes showed bias in 5–15%
codon pairs, whereas B. aphidicola and C. blochmannia had
only 1.5% and 1.7% biased codons respectively. Therefore, these two genomes seem effectively to lack biased
codon pairs.
We conclude that codon pair usage bias can be distributed
in many different ways. Although most organisms have a
similar set of universally conserved biased codon pairs,
some organisms use slightly different sets (e.g. N. equitans) and some have a very small number of biased codon
pairs (e.g. B. aphidicola, C. blochmannia).
Evolutionary conservation of codon context
Our findings suggest that certain codon contexts are
strongly conserved over all domains of life. It has been
proposed that codon context is even more important than
single codon usage for translational efficiency [1].

To analyze whether single codon preference or codon pair
preference is more conserved on the evolutionary scale,
we compared different bacteria according to RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage) and RDCU (relative dicodon usage). Similarity was measured by calculating the
correlation (Spearman's ρ) of RSCU and RDCU values
between each pair of bacteria. All pairs of bacteria analyzed were divided into nine groups according to the evolutionary distance separating each pair. Pairwise
evolutionary distances were retrieved as a 16SRNA distance matrix from the Ribosomal Database Project [28].
The average correlation coefficients of RSCU and RDCU
were calculated for each group. We observed that the correlation of RSCU values was generally higher than the correlation of RDCU values (Figure 5). As expected, the
highest correlation of RSCU occurred in the phylogenetically closest bacteria. The greatest similarity in RDCU
among the species analyzed occurred when the calcula-

The most avoided and the most preferred codon
pairs are uniformly distributed in all three domains of
life. The map is clustered on the basis of the conservation of
avoidance and preference of different codon pairs. The
avoided codon pairs are marked in yellow (obs/exp < 0). The
preferred codon pairs are marked in blue (obs/exp > 0).
Codon pairs without bias are black (obs/exp = 0). No additional criteria were applied to the figure. Codon pairs are

tion was based on 1–2 codon pairs. Extending the distance between two codons (1–3, 1–4, 1–10) decreased the
RDCU correlation.
Codon pair usage analysis showed that the most considerably biased conserved codon pairs are biased irrespective
of phylogenetic class (Figures 1, 2, 3). To determine
whether this is also true when the usage of all possible
codon pairs is considered and compared with RSCU in
different phylogenetic classes, we used a tree-based
method. The correlation of RSCU or RDCU usage between
two organisms can be used as a measure of the distance
between them: the higher the correlation, the shorter the
distance. For example, the distance between two organisms with identical codon usage would be 0 (1-ρ2 with ρ2
= 1). These distances can be represented as trees and compared to ribosomal RNA sequence-based phylogenetic
trees.

Comparing the RSCU and RDCU trees, we observed that
the branch lengths were shorter in the RSCU tree (Figure
6A) than in the RDCU (codons 1–2) tree (Figure 6B),
showing that codon usage gives stronger similarity
between different organisms than codon pair usage. However, only a few clearly-separated phylogenetic classes
occurred in both trees. Some were similarly clustered in
both trees, e.g. bacilli, gamma-proteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria. This indicates that in addition to similar
codon usage, these organisms use similar codon contexts.
In contrast, eukaryotes showed different patterns, being
spread around the codon usage tree (Figure 6A), but clustered together in the codon context tree (Figure 6B). This
suggests that between different eukaryotes (which in our
dataset were mostly represented by fungi) the similarity in
codon context is greater than the similarity in codon
usage. Still, it has to be noted that the sample we used for
eukaryotes is not representative since it is small and contains only one mammal.

Discussion
The current study is an extensive investigation of sequence
context patterns that are independent of single codon
usage and dipeptide usage. We found that some combinations of neighboring codons are similarly avoided or preferred in many different organisms – bacteria, archaea and
eukaryotes. The conserved avoidances and preferences of
codon pairs observed are not the result of dipeptide biases
since the effect of dipeptides was removed. Much of the
dataset could be divided into subtypes on the basis of
nucleotide patterns influencing the bias of codon pairs.
Conserved patterns result mainly from translational
effects not from DNA-related mechanisms since the biases
are stronger in ORFeomes than in genomes.
It was claimed previously that codon pair preference is primarily determined by a tetranucleotide combination
including the last nucleotide of the P-site codon and all
three nucleotides of the A-site codon [16]. However, our
results showed that different patterns ranging from dinucleotides to hexanucleotides could explain conserved
biased codon pair usage. Still, with one exception (codon
pair UUUUUU and pattern UnnnnU), all sub-patterns
contained a fixed nucleotide in the last position of the Psite codon in the codon pair. As the ribosome does not
contact the bases of the codon in the P-site [29], the reason for this potential P-site effect is not clear.

Previously, the only universal context selection rule found
to cover all three domains of life was the avoidance of
most codon pairs of the nnUAnn type, which was suggested to result from rejection of TA dinucleotides in DNA
sequences [22]. Among 9 groups of under-represented
codon pairs found in our study the largest group was also
influenced by the avoidance of UA dinucleotides. However, although TA dinucleotides could be avoided at the
genome level, this would not exclude the possibility that
avoidance of UA dinucleotides is also important for ORFs
and effective translation. Our methods allowed us to compare the observed/expected ratios of codon pairs more
specifically between ORFeomes and genomes. The results
showed that in 75.7% of cases the avoidance effect for
nnUAnn codon pairs was stronger in ORFeomes than in
genomes, suggesting the influence of translational mechanisms (Table 2).
Many of the avoided nnUAnn patterns contained outframe stop codons, UAA or UAG, on the sense strand. This
indicates that out-frame stop codons influence the avoidance of nnUAnn codon pairs. The reason for avoiding the
codon pairs containing out-frame stops could be to minimize premature translational termination through recognition of those stops by a translation termination factor.
The observation that only the stop codons UAA and UAG
were avoided suggests that this kind of misreading might
be caused by termination factor 1, the protein responsible

for decoding them. Although the frequencies of erroneous
termination events have been studied [30], we have no
information concerning the possible recognition of termination codons through a frameshifting event. Interestingly, most nnUAnn codon pairs also contained outframe UAA and UAG triplets on the antisense strand.
There are no known mechanisms that could explain such
avoidances. However, our results suggest that nnUAnn
type avoidances are related to translational mechanisms
because they are stronger in ORFeomes than in genomes.
Mononucleotide repeats, especially poly(A) and poly(U)
tracts, are also known to cause transcriptional and translational frameshifting [8-10]. Therefore, such contexts
should be selected against in protein coding sequences.
There were eight mononucleotide repeats among the
avoided codon pairs. The repeated nucleotide was G
(GGGGGG, GGGGGU, GGGGGC and GGGGCC), C
(ACCCCG, ACCCCA and GCCCCG) or U (UUUUUU)
[Additional file 4]. All those codon pairs were more
strongly avoided in ORFeomes than in genomes. This suggests that they were avoided to reduce the frequency of
frameshifting events in polynucleotide sequences.

We also found several conserved preferred codon pairs.
The number of conserved preferred codon pairs was
smaller than the number of avoided codon pairs [Additional files 1, 2]. This suggests that the selection for more
effective and more accurate translation acts primarily
through avoidance of the most disadvantageous codon
pairs and not through over-representation of the most
suitable contexts. The most prevalent type of conserved
preferred codon pair was nnGCnn [Additional file 5].
The top 10 avoided and preferred codon pairs were not
specific to any larger phylogenetic group, suggesting that
usage of those codon pairs is universally conserved (Figures 2 and 3). However, in some organisms with small
genomes, only a few of those 20 codon pairs were significantly biased. This is not caused by statistical limitations
on finding biased codon pairs in smaller genomes, but
rather by the absence of codon-pair bias in those organisms. We also observed that some genomes use sets of
most avoided and most preferred codon pairs different
from the conserved sets identified in this study.
It has been proposed that codon context is even more
important than codon usage for translational efficiency
[1]. Our findings suggest that certain codon contexts are

The evolutionary conservation of RSCU (A) and RDCU (B) in the genomes studied. The branch lengths characterize the correlation of RSCU or RDCU usage between two organisms – the higher the correlation, the shorter the branch. In
general, the branch lengths of the RSCU tree are shorter than those of the RDCU tree, showing stronger similarity of codon
usage than codon pair usage between different organisms. Bacilli, gamma-proteobacteria and alpha-proteobacteria form very
similar clusters on both trees. Eukaryotes, which are spread around the RSCU tree, are all clustered together in the RDCU
tree. For the full names of organisms see [additional file 6].

markedly conserved over all domains of life. However, the
comparison of RSCU and RDCU correlations showed that
overall codon pair usage is less conserved than single
codon usage (Figure 5). This was also confirmed by the
shorter branch lengths in the codon pair usage tree than
in the single codon usage tree (Figure 6). Tree analysis
showed that in the RSCU tree certain phylogenetic classes,
for example bacilli, alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria,
have extremely similar codon usage preferences within the
classes (Figure 6A). However, on the codon pair tree
(RDCU tree), species are more distant from each other
(codon pair usage is less similar). In contrast, larger phylogenetic groups are positioned together on the RDCU
tree. For example, the similarity of codon pair usage in
eukaryotes is higher than the similarity of single codon
usage (eukaryotes are placed together on the RDCU tree
but not on the RSCU tree). The large differences between
the RSCU and RDCU tree topologies and branch lengths
imply that codon preference and codon pair preference
are shaped by different molecular mechanisms.
Codon frequencies correlate with tRNA concentrations,
suggesting that this is a major selective force on codon
usage patterns [31-33]. The codon pair preferences can be
shaped by several different molecular mechanisms. One is
the possible decrease of frameshifting errors through
avoidance of mononucleotide repeats [8-10]. In addition,
it has been suggested that codon context might be influenced by certain structural constraints imposed by two
tRNAs occupying the ribosomal P- and A-sites [1,16,23].
Unfortunately, we currently have very limited information about the details of interaction between different
tRNAs with the ribosome [29,34,35], which precludes further extension of this hypothesis.
The ribosome contains three sites for tRNA binding: the A, P- and E-sites. It has been shown that the E-site tRNA can
influence decoding in the A-site [24-26]. In addition, it
was shown in fungi that the combinations of three consecutive codons are biased and some combinations are even
vanished from the ORFeomes [27]. Therefore, bias might
also be observed in codon pair usage where codons are
separated by three nucleotides (the 1–3 pair). We
observed only one conserved 1–3 interaction, over-representation of the pattern GGUnnnGGU, indicating that
interactions between the ribosomal E- and A-sites do not
influence the codon context as much as interactions
between the P- and A-sites. It was shown that the usage of
three neighbouring codons is species specific among fungi
[27]. Our results correlate with that and suggest that this
bias could also be species specific among bacteria and
eukaryotes.

Conclusion
A conserved biased set of codon pairs was found in a dataset covering a large number of organisms from the three
domains of life. Most of the pairs had stronger bias on the
ORFeome level than on the whole genome level, suggesting that translation has a greater influence on codon pair
biases than molecular mechanisms that shape the
genomic DNA in general.

Methods
Data
We selected 100 bacterial genomes randomly and complemented the random dataset so that all major phylogenetic classes were covered by at least one organism
(resulting in 103 bacteria). For archaea we downloaded
protein coding sequences for all sequenced genomes (28
genomes, year 2006). In addition, seven eukaryotic
genomes were selected – six fungi and human. The protein coding sequences of all bacteria, archaea and fungi
were retrieved from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/.
Human protein coding sequences were retrieved from
Ensembl [36]. The list of all genomes analyzed and the
corresponding accession numbers are provided in [additional file 6].

To compile standardized genomes we randomly selected
sequences from the set of all protein coding sequences of
the corresponding organism until 150,000 ± 1000 codon
pairs were obtained.
Calculation of observed and expected codon pair counts
For the observed values, we counted the number of all
possible sense:sense and sense:stop codon pairs (61 × 64
= 3904 pairs) by computer. The initial expected value of a
codon pair was calculated using the frequencies of single
codons in protein coding sequences. The expected value
for a codon pair in the ORFeome was normalized as previously described [16,17]: the dipeptide bias was removed
by multiplying the initial expected value of a codon pair
by the normalization coefficient. The normalization coefficient was the ratio of the observed to expected frequencies of the corresponding dipeptide encoded by the codon
pair.

To separate translational effects from DNA-related effects
influencing codon pair biases we compared the observed/
expected ratios of a codon pair in ORFeomes and the corresponding hexanucleotide in genomes. We averaged the
observed/expected values of each codon pair over all studied organisms for the comparison of ORFeomes and
genomes.
The expected value of a hexanucleotide in a genome was
calculated using the frequencies of trinucleotides in
genomic sequences of that organism. The trinucleotide

Page 12 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:463

frequencies were counted by moving the window one
nucleotide at a time. In genomes, the expected values of
trinucleotide pairs containing out-frame UAA and UAG
triplets on the sense and/or antisense strand were corrected by excluding the frames of coding regions where
the given codon pair could not exist. Without normalization the expected values of pairs containing out-frame
stops would be exaggerated, so the observed/expected
ratio for the given codon pair would also be underestimated.
In each separate ORFeome, only under-represented codon
pairs with observed/expected ratios ≤ 0.9 and over-represented codon pairs with observed/expected ratios ≥ 1.1
were subjected to the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. In all
analyses, p-values of 0.01 or less were considered statistically significant. We used no multiple correction methods
at this point. Codon pairs that were significantly biased in
at least 51% of the organisms studied were marked as conserved.
To analyze which nucleotide positions in a codon pair
have most influence on biases, we calculated the average
observed/expected ratios of all possible sub-patterns covering both adjacent codons (di-, tri, tetra- and pentamers)
in ORFeomes over all the organisms studied. The
observed and expected values of the sub-patterns were
correspondingly summed over all codon pairs that contained the pattern. Among each set of sub-patterns of different lengths, and also for the codon pairs, the z-score
was calculated for the observed/expected ratio of each pattern i:

log 2(observed/expected)i,n
zi =
,
σ [ log 2(observed/expected) n ]
where (observed/expected)i, n is the observed/expected ratio
of a codon pair or sub-pattern i of length n and
σ[log2(observed/expected)n] is the standard deviation of the
observed/expected ratios of all sub-patterns of length n.
Comparison of the z-scores allowed the most biased
nucleotide sub-pattern responsible for the bias of the
codon pair to be identified.
The programs for all those calculations were written in
Perl.
Calculation of evolutionary distance and codon context
correlation
The bias of single codons was described by relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU). RSCU values are the number
of times a particular codon is observed, relative to the
number of times that the codon would be observed in the
absence of any codon usage bias [37]. To represent the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/463

bias of codon pairs, we calculated the relative dicodon
usage (RDCU), which was based on the observed/
expected ratios of four different sets of codon pairs: 1–2
(neighboring codons), 1–3 (codons separated by one
intervening codon), 1–4 (codons separated by two intervening codons) and 1–10 (codons separated by eight
intervening codons) as a control. Next, we measured the
correlation of RSCU values between each pair of bacteria
(Spearman's ρ). Similarly, the correlation between RDCU
values in pairs of bacteria was calculated. All pairs of bacteria analyzed were divided into nine groups on the basis
of the evolutionary distances between them. Pairwise evolutionary distances were retrieved as a 16SRNA distance
matrix from the Ribosomal Database Project [28]. Finally,
we calculated the average correlation coefficients for each
of those groups.
RSCU and RDCU trees
RSCU and RDCU trees were drawn using the corresponding correlation coefficients calculated previously: the
higher the correlation, the shorter the distance between
two organisms. For example, the distance between two
organisms with identical codon usage would be 0 (1-ρ2
with ρ2 = 1). Trees were calculated using the Fitch-Margoliash [38] algorithm from PHYLIP software [39] and were
edited using TreeDyn software [40].

the ORFeome level. The z-score of the most avoided shorter sub-pattern for
each codon pair is also shown (shaded yellow). For type 1A the location of
out-frame UAA or UAG is shown by arrows and colors: → (yellow) – on
sense strand; ← (blue) – on antisense strand; ↔ (green) – on sense and
antisense strands.

Preferred codon pairs of different types. Codon pairs containing outframe UAA or UAG triplets on the sense and/or antisense strand are
shaded blue. The observed/expected ratios in logarithmic scale for each
codon pair in ORFeome and genome are shown. Observed/expected values
greater than 0.58 are shaded green (corresponding to at least a 1.5-fold
difference). % – the percentage of organisms in which the codon pair is
significantly preferred. A – B – difference between log2(obs/exp) ratios in
the ORFeome and the genome. A – B > 0 represents a stronger effect on
the ORFeome level. The z-score of the most preferred shorter sub-pattern
for each codon pair is also shown (shaded yellow).
