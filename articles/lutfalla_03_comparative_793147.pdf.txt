Abstract
Background: The high degree of sequence conservation between coding regions in fish and
mammals can be exploited to identify genes in mammalian genomes by comparison with the
sequence of similar genes in fish. Conversely, experimentally characterized mammalian genes may
be used to annotate fish genomes. However, gene families that escape this principle include the
rapidly diverging cytokines that regulate the immune system, and their receptors. A classic example
is the class II helical cytokines (HCII) including type I, type II and lambda interferons, IL10 related
cytokines (IL10, IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26) and their receptors (HCRII). Despite the report of
a near complete pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) genome sequence, these genes remain undescribed in
fish.
Results: We have used an original strategy based both on conserved amino acid sequence and
gene structure to identify HCII and HCRII in the genome of another pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis
that is amenable to laboratory experiments. The 15 genes that were identified are highly divergent
and include a single interferon molecule, three IL10 related cytokines and their potential receptors
together with two Tissue Factor (TF). Some of these genes form tandem clusters on the Tetraodon
genome. Their expression pattern was determined in different tissues. Most importantly,
Tetraodon interferon was identified and we show that the recombinant protein can induce antiviral
MX gene expression in Tetraodon primary kidney cells. Similar results were obtained in Zebrafish
which has 7 MX genes.
Conclusion: We propose a scheme for the evolution of HCII and their receptors during the
radiation of bony vertebrates and suggest that the diversification that played an important role in
the fine-tuning of the ancestral mechanism for host defense against infections probably followed
different pathways in amniotes and fish.

Background
The increasing number of sequenced genomes provides
molecular explanations for both the unity and diversity of
living organisms. The more divergent the organisms, the
less they share genes. This explains why annotation of
genomes using genes with known functions in other
organisms leaves a high number of predicted genes with
no predicted function. For some prokaryotes, the percentage of genes with no predicted function rises to 65% but
falls to 20% for the closely related vertebrate genomes [1–
3].
The majority of genes with no assigned functions are
those involved in the recent evolutionary success of the
considered taxonomic group. This is both true for
prokaryotes that develop original metabolisms allowing
growth in special environments and for the vertebrate species that have developed original solutions in response to
environmental pressures. Comparison of mammalian
proteins show that host defense ligands and receptors
make up the group of proteins that diverge the most rapidly [4]. According to the «red queen model» the pressure
of pathogens is, at small time scales, the most drastic pressure for the evolution of vertebrate species.
At the genomic level, together with the mutation/modification of regulatory elements, three driving forces are
instrumental for the diversification. The first is the emergence of new domain architecture through domain accretion and shuffling, the second is deletion of genes, and the
third is the expansion of a gene family either by gene
duplications or by retropositions. Lineage specific expansion (LSE) is the proliferation of a given gene family in a
given lineage. Its description implies the comparison of
sister lineages [5]. Using predicted proteomes, Lespinet et
al. have recently performed a systematic comparative
analysis of LSEs in the following eukaryotic genomes: Saccharomyces
cerevisiae,
Schizosaccharomyces
pombe,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. They reached the conclusion that «LSE
seems to be one of the most important sources of structural and regulatory diversity in crown-group eukaryotes,
which was critical for the tremendous exploration of the
morphospace seen in these organisms» [6]. A good example for an LSE is the expansion of immunoglobulin genes
in gnathostomes compared to other chordates. But LSEs
also exist when comparing the different orders of mammals as exemplified by the expansion of the alpha interferons [7,8].
Vertebrate immunoglobulins (Ig) are built up from modules of one hundred amino acids. These modules are
defined both by a common 3-D structure, by conserved
disulfide bridges and by conserved amino acid positions.
They share the same 3-D structure with the Fibronectin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/29

type III repeats (FNIII), but conserved amino acid positions are different in both groups of domains [9,10].
Genes coding for such modules were already present in
the genomes of invertebrates [11]. The originality of the
gnathostomes is the invention of rearranging antigen
receptors by insertion of a transposable element in a gene
coding for one of these Ig modules [3,12]. During the further diversification of the vertebrates, the different lineages (for example, condrychtians and osteichtians) have
developed the system in different ways but the main difference consists in the maturation of the immune
response that mainly takes place in the lymphoid organs.
Cytokines that regulate the maturation of the immune
response from antigen detection to clonal expansion of
the one cell with better affinity mostly belong to the helical cytokine (HC) family [13]. They include interferons,
most interleukins, LIF, CNTF, GCSF, GM-CSF, thrombopoïetine. These helical cytokines have no similarities at
the level of primary amino acid sequences, but they are all
structured around a similar four alpha helix bundle. They
share this common 3-D structure with some hormones
that for this reason are structurally described as helical
cytokines: Growth Hormone (GH), Prolactin (PRL),
Erythropoïetin (EPO) and Leptin [14]. These helical
cytokines all bind to the extracellular binding domains of
their cognate receptors (helical cytokines receptors: HCR)
which all contain a 200 amino-acids (D200) domain that
is the identification mark of the HCR gene family. These
D200 domains are composed of two subdomains of 100
amino-acids (SD100A & SD100B) that are both structured
like the basic Ig domains with two β sheets of respectively
3 and 4 strands (C type). Conserved amino-acid positions
clearly distinguish these D200 domains from the Ig superfamily and from the FNIII family [9,10].
Whereas Ig and FNIII families have been expanded in
invertebrates, a single gene with a D200 has been
described in invertebrates: the dome gene in drosophila
[15–17]. The HCR family is therefore an interesting example of a vertebrate specific LSE. Like other families of
receptors involved in host defense, it mostly consists of
highly diverging receptors (28% amino acids identities
between the human and chicken IFNAR2 proteins) [4,18].
Together with the difficulty of predicting genes from
genomic sequences, this explains why the comparison of
the predicted human and Fugu proteomes did not allow
the identification of the complete repertoire of HCR in
Fugu [1]. Depending on the conserved amino acids residues, HCRs can be divided in two classes: Class I and Class
II. Class II consists of the Tissue Factor, the receptors for
interferons and the receptors for IL10 and its related
cytokines(IL10, IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26). Class I
consists of all other HCRs [9,10]. Their cognate ligands
have been called class I and class II helical cytokines.
Genes for HCRI have been described in the major

vertebrate groups including fish, birds and mammals, but
HCRII have only been described in birds and mammals
[10,18–21]. The question is therefore open as to whether
the HCRII expansion is amniote specific or not. The recent
efforts to sequence genomes from fish offer an interesting
opportunity to answer this question.
Interestingly, the intron/exon structure of the vertebrate
HCR genes is strictly conserved in all the family: like the
exons coding for the Igs and the FNIII, the exons coding
each SD100 are bordered by phase 1 introns, but what is
specific for D200s is that SD100As are encoded by two
exons with an internal phase 2 intron falling at the level
of the third β strand and that SD100Bs are encoded by two
exons with an internal phase 0 intron falling at the level
of the fourth β strand [22–24]. Intron/exon structures can
thus be used as a criterion for the identification of
homologs in distant species.
We decided to use the genomic data from Tetraodon nigroviridis to look for the genes coding the class II HCR
(HCRII) and their ligands. The main interest of T. nigroviridis is both its completely sequenced compact genome
and the ease with which it can be maintained in the laboratory and used for experiments. We report here the complete description of the T. nigroviridis class II HCR
repertoire and show that its diversification from common
ancestral elements has occurred independently in fish and
mammalian lineages. We have also characterized two ligands for these receptors.

Results
Identification of HCRII genes in Tetraodon nigroviridis
The starting point for the search was the alignment of the
classII HCR D200 as reported in Uzé et al. (1995),
extended to include the more recently described members
IFNAR2 and CRF2-8 to CRF2-12 that allows the definition
of a pattern of conserved positions. A conserved tryptophan in exon A1 (the first exon coding for SD100A), a
conserved tryptophan and pair of cysteines in exon A2, a
conserved serine and pair of cysteines in exon B2. All
HCRII were tblastn against the 3 million genomic reads of
T. nigroviridis (see methods). Reads with e<0.1 were kept
and assembled. Each contig was tested for the presence of
correct potential exons: introns of the correct phase and
predicted proteins compatible with HCRII. False positives
were exons coding for FNIII repeats that do not have the
D200 intron/exon structure. All matching contigs were
further extended in order to reach sizes of contigs compatible with whole gene size in the compact genome of T.
nigroviridis: 5 contigs from 4 to 30 kb were obtained. Gene
models were predicted in each contig and most probable
exons were used to design oligonucleotides for 3' and 5'
RACE. The full-length cDNAs were then aligned against
the contigs to deduce gene structures and compared to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/29

Genscan
predictions
http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html. None of the 11 TnHCRII was correctly predicted by Genscan. The largest contig harbors 6 genes
while the 5 others harbour a single HCRII gene. All genes
are around 3 kb long. In agreement with the human
nomenclature, they were named TnCRFB-1 to TnCRFB11. All reading frames start with a leader peptide followed
by a single D200. Except for TnCRFB-9 they all have a
clear transmembrane (TM) domain after the D200.
Expression patterns were determined for each of the 11
genes by Q-PCR using cDNAs reverse transcribed from
RNAs of brain, spleen, cephalic kidney, gonads and intestine (figure 2). Long open reading frames and high expression in at least one tissue were considered sufficient
criteria to state that these genes code for receptors and are
not pseudogenes.
The T. nigroviridis repertoire of HCRII
Figure 3 shows the comparison of the HCRII gene repertoire in human and T. nigroviridis. As already described the
HCRIIs are grouped in clusters on the human genome
[18,19]. The largest cluster lies on human chromosome
21 (HSA21); it contains four genes (IFNAR2, IL10R2,
IFNAR1 and IFNGR2) and is linked to the C21orf4 and
GART genes. Two other clusters exist, one on HSA6q containing three genes (IFNGR1, IL22BP and IL20R1) and
one on HSA1p containing two genes (IFNLR1 and
IL22R2). The TF gene is also located on HSA1p but so distant that it cannot be considered as a member of the same
cluster. The IL20R2 and IL10R1 genes are isolated and
therefore called outgroups. The T. nigroviridis genome harbors a single HCRII gene cluster. As proved by the presence and similar orientation of the TnC21orf4 gene, this
cluster is homologous to the HSA21 gene cluster. It contains six genes instead of the four genes present on the
human homologous cluster. Interestingly, the TnGART
gene, is not linked to this cluster, but is adjacent to the
TnMT gene (T nigroviridis homolog of the yeast YDR140w
gene). The same organization of the GART and MT genes,
has already been described in the Fugu genome [18]. The
human homolog for this MT gene (Acc nb of the cDNA:
AF139682) is present on HSA21, 4.5 Mb centromeric to
the cluster and transcribed toward the centromere [25].
The respective position of these genes indicates that an
inversion has occurred since the divergence of the fish and
mammalian ancestors. This inversion has involved a large
chromosomal fragment covering genes from C21orf4 to
the MT homolog of the yeast YDR140w gene. In one state,
the C21orf4 is adjacent to the GART gene (amniotes), but
in the other, the MT is next to GART.

In order to determine if any of the TnHCRII would be the
homolog of the functionally characterized human genes,
the 13 human D200s (12 genes but IFNAR1 with two
D200) together with some of their mammalian or avian

orthologs were aligned with the 11 D200s of T. nigroviridis. The alignment was used to draw the phylogenetic
tree that is depicted in figure 4. Tree branches with bootstrap values over 80% are indicated in bold. The clearest
result is the grouping of TnCRFB10 & 11 with the TFs.
TnCRFB10 and TnCRFB11 therefore appear as homologous to the mammalian TFs. This is confirmed by the
intron/exon structure of their genes. TnCRFB10 &11, as
the mammalian TF genes, are unique among the HCRII
genes coding for transmembrane proteins in that the same
exon encodes the TM domain and the very short intracellular domain [26]. Except for the genes coding for soluble
proteins, all the other HCRII genes have an exon that
encode the TM domain plus the first amino acids of the
intracellular domain separated from the last exon coding

the intracellular domain by a phase 0 intron [27]. Interestingly, TnCRFB10 &11 are not expressed in the same tissues: TnCRFB11 is specifically expressed in the brain
(figure 2).
The phylogenetic tree derived from the alignment also
reveals an interesting grouping of the TnCRFB4 and
TnCRFB5 with the amniotes IL10R2. We can therefore
postulate that the adjacent corresponding genes are
derived from a recent tandem duplication and are
homologs of the amniotes IL10R2. Furthermore the alignment derived grouping of TnCRFB1, 2 & 3 most probably
reflects recent tandem duplications of their cognate genes
but with no obvious amniote homologs. The other TnH-

Expression pattern for the classII helical cytokine receptor genes
Expression pattern for the classII helical cytokine receptor genes. RNA samples were prepared from tissues, reverse
transcribed and abundance of each cDNA was measured by QPCR using oligonucleotides listed in supplementary material. All
data were normalized to the level of hnRNPA2 cDNA. 5% confidence in a student T test is shown. Orf4 stands for the T nigroviridis homologue of the human C21orf4 gene.

CRII genes do not appear robustly linked to mammalian
genes.
Ligands for TnHCRII
The presence of so many HCRII raises the question of their
ligands and more specifically, that of the existence of an
interferon system in fish [1]. Clearly, as shown in figure 4
(see also Additional file: 2, tetraodons, contrarily to amniotes have no IFNAR1 receptor with its typical double
D200 that has certainly been instrumental to the diversification of the type I IFNs [27]. But the question remains
open whether or not fish have interferon related molecules with similar functions.

The T. nigroviridis reads were searched for exons capable of
coding for molecules structurally related to the IFNs and
IL10 related cytokines (tblastn). Contrary to their receptors, these cytokines are not encoded by genes with similar
intron/exon structures. Genes for type I IFNs (IFNI) have
no introns, those for IFNII have three introns.[28], those
for IFN lambda have four introns [29,30]and those for
IL10 related cytokines have four common introns [19].
Therefore the intron/exon structure could not be used as a
criterion for the search of homologs in distant species.
Potential exons were used for 3' and 5' RACE and the
genes for four helical cytokines could be cloned: three
genes coding IL10 related cytokines with the four conserved phase 0 introns and an interesting TnIFN gene also
interrupted by four phase 0 introns. This gene codes for an

interferon structurally related to IFNI and IFN lambda. For
this reason, we call it TnIFN. The same full-length cDNA
was cloned both from a wild animal and from an animal
from breeders.
In order to establish that this fish IFN gene is not specific
for tetraodons, we also cloned the orthologous gene from
Danio rerio (zebrafish) using the trace repository reads to
design oligonucleotides on potential exons for 3' and 5'
RACE. The first four exons could easily be identified in silico using the T. nigroviridis sequence, but the last exon
could be identified only by 3' RACE. The corresponding
gene was called zIFN. Full-length cDNAs were cloned
from two individuals from different breeders: alleles A &

B. Both zIFN sequences differed at four silent positions,
two non silent positions and differed at their COOH terminus; allele B codes for two extra amino acids. Despite
the report from Aparicio et al. (2002) that they could not
identify a Fugu IFN gene, reexamination of the Fugu
genomic data allowed the identification of a Fugu IFN
gene.
Of the three IL10 related cytokines, one is clearly the
homolog of mammalian IL10, it is therefore called
TnIL10. The two others are so divergent that it is difficult
to identify them as clear orthologs of mammalian genes.
However, according to the identity of the most similar

genes, one is called TnIL20, the other is called TnIL24 (not
shown). Interestingly TnIL10 and TnIL20 are in tandem
(Acc Number AY294557)
An alignment of amino acid sequences of some IFNI and
IFN lambda with the T. nigroviridis and D rerio IFNs was
used to draw a phylogenetic tree of these IFNs (Figure 5,
see also Additional file: 3). Branchings with bootstrap values over 80% are shown in bold. This tree shows a clear
grouping of IFNI with fish IFNs and IFN lambda. This is
illustrated using the outgroup genes hIL10 and TnIL10.
Similar results are obtained whichever IL10 related
cytokine or IFNII is used as an outgroup. The trees with
more of these IL10 related cytokines are not shown
because the bootstrap values are too low to state phylogenetic relationships between them. This tree illustrates very
well the independent diversification of alpha IFNs in the
different mammalian orders [7,8]. Expression patterns for
TnIL10 mRNA (figure 6A) and for TnIFN mRNA in five tissues from animals treated or not by PolyI/PolyC intraperitoneal injection (figure 6B) have been determined. PolyI/
polyC injection induces a very high induction of TnIFN
from more than 10 times in testis to more than 104 times
in kidney.
Activity of the newly discovered fish interferon
To test the biological activity of this interferon we decided
to produce recombinant IFN in order to treat cells and to
use quantitative RT-PCR to test for the induction of an
interferon inducible gene. For this purpose, we looked for
the MX genes both in T. nigroviridis and in zebrafish. MX
genes code for mechanoenzymes of the Dynamin family
[31] and are typical interferon induced genes. We have
identified seven MX genes in zebrafish (zMXA to zMXG)
and have found evidence of expression for all of them
except zMXF. The zMXA gene corresponds to the already
reported zebrafish MX gene [32]. In contrast T. nigroviridis
has a single MX gene. The amount of TnMX mRNA was
therefore used as a test for the biological activity of TnIFN.
The TnIFN orf was cloned in either pIVEX2.3-MCS or
pIVEX 2.4bNde (6HIS Cterm and Nterm fusions respectively) and the resulting plasmids were used to produce
recombinant TnIFN. The recombinant protein was used to
challenge primary cultures of cephalic kidney T. nigroviridis cells. After a 6 hours treatment, cells were harvested
for total RNA preparations and quantitative RT PCR was
used for measuring the amount of TnMX mRNAs. The T.
nigroviridis mRNA for hnRNPA2, a house keeping splicing
regulator, was used as a reference. PolyI/PolyC treatment
was used as a control of interferon induction. Results
shown in figure 6C show that the recombinant TnIFN
molecule with a Nterm HIS tag can induce the expression
of the TnMX mRNA to a level similar to PolyI/PolyC
treatment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/29

We verified that, in contrast to the PolyI/PolyC treatment,
recombinant TnIFN and GFP do not induce the TnIFN
mRNA (not shown). Similar result were obtained with
zebrafish cell lines ZF4/7 using zMXE as a reporter mRNA
as it is the zMX gene the more induced by IFN (not
shown). PKR is an other very well characterized IFN
induced gene [33]. T. nigroviridis has two PKR genes (PKR1
and PKR2) which were used as reporters to confirm the
results with TnMX: both are induced like the single TnMX
gene (not shown).
While this manuscript was in preparation, Altmann et al
(2003) [32] have reported the molecular and functional
analysis of zIFN and shown its antiviral activity and Yap et
al. (2003) [34] have shown that the promoter of the single
Fugu MX gene can be induced by human interferon when
transfected in human cells.

Discussion
Rapidly evolving lineage specific gene families are intrinsically difficult to analyze by large scale comparative
genomic analysis [35]. A good example of this difficulty is
the recent report of the near complete sequence of the
Fugu genome [1]. This report clearly stated that IFNs and
their related IL10 family cytokines and most of their
receptors could not be identified in the Fugu genomes. We
show here that reexamination of the data leads to opposite conclusions. Careful analysis of the HCR family in
amniotes reveals features that can be used as criteria for a
specific search of their homologs in distant species. Both
conserved positions in the amino acid sequence of the
protein and conserved phase and positions of introns are
instrumental for this search.
Receptor diversification
Using the strategy described in figure 1, we have been able
to describe 11 TnHCRII genes in T. nigroviridis. Primary
amino acid sequences are so divergent that the phylogenetic tree is poorly reliable. Only a limited number of
branches have good bootstrap values. For this reason, we
cannot make estimates of divergence time for the different
family members. It also explains why the tree differs from
that of Kotenko et al [19] and why it is difficult to distinguish between paralogy and orthology for those receptors.
The clearest homology is for TnCRFB10 &11 that are paralogous and represent the homologs of the mammalian
TFs. TF is an interesting member of the HCRII family in
that it does not bind a helical cytokine, but a coagulation
factor (VIIa) whose 3D structure is similar to that of a helical cytokine. It clearly is not involved in host defense
against pathogens and as such is not diverging as rapidly
as the other HCRII family members from one species to
the other. Interestingly, the two T. nigroviridis genes are
not expressed in the same tissues, TnCRFB11 being specific for the brain. We see two reasons to postulate that

Page 9 of 15

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

these two genes have not been duplicated recently. The
first is that the encoded proteins show only 35% amino
acid identity and the second is that they do not lie in cluster on the genome of T. nigroviridis. This could lead us to
postulate that other teleost fish species also have two TF
genes. Curiously the Fugu proteome deduced from the
near complete sequence of the Fugu genome contains
only the ortholog of TnCRFB10 (Scaffold8956, protein
61906). A Oncorhynchus mykis TF gene has been cloned
(Acc nb CAC82787) that is also the ortholog of
TnCRFB10. For this reason we propose that TnCRFB10
would be called TnTF1 and TnCRFB11 be called TnTF2.
The absence of TF2 in other species could simply reflect
lack of detection of the paralogous TF2 gene. We therefore
re-examined the Fugu genome for potential exons coding
for a FuguTF2. Such exons could be found on Fugu-Scaffold 5445, but the Scaffold seems badly assembled as the
exons are scrambled, therefore the correct gene model has
escaped automatic detection. This proves that the Fugu
genome has the TF2 gene. The O. mikis TF2 gene has probably escaped cloning by classical means just by chance as
investigators were probably looking for just one gene.
The other possible homology is between TnCRFB4 & 5
and IL10R2. The IL10R2 receptor is in fact a "common
chain" as it is a necessary component of the receptors for
IL10, IL22 and IFN lambda and it is (apart from TF) the
HCRII with the lowest sequence divergence in amniotes.
Its gene lies in the center of the HSA21 HCRII gene cluster.
Interestingly, TnCRFB4 &5 also lie in a similar central
position on the homologous TnC21orf4 linked gene cluster. Finally, TnCRFB1, 2 & 3 are closely related to each
other. Careful inspection of the data indicates that the
three genes are also present in the Fugu genome, but
because of assembly problems they appear on different
contigs (Fugu Scaffolds 3897 & 6320). They seem to code
for receptors distantly related to amniote's IFNAR2. This is
in accordance with their mapping at the extremity of the
C21orf4 linked cluster and could suggest a common
ancestry. The successive tandem duplications that lead to
the three fish genes could be fish specific. The vicinity of
the unassigned outgroups TnHCRII did not reveal genes
whose homologs would be linked to human HCRII genes,
it is therefore not possible to state any clear homology to
mammalian genes. Careful inspection of the Fugu
genome reveals that the 11 TnHCRIIs have homologs in
Fugu.
Ligand diversification
The search for ligands has revealed only four classII helical
cytokines (HCII): IFN and three IL10 related cytokines
(IL10, IL20 and IL24). The present work allows the
definition of two categories of classII cytokines. One category is made up in mammals of lambda IFN and typeI
IFN, the other would be made up of IL10 related cytokines

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/29

and gamma IFN (see below). In fish, the first category
would be made up of only an ancestral interferon gene
with four phase 0 introns that is homologous to the
human IFN lambda genes. The three human IFN lambda
genes are located on human chromosome 19 and their
four phase 0 are perfectly conserved both amongst them
[30] and with TnIFN and zIFN. The key element during
the evolution of the IFN genes has therefore been a retroposition event that occurred during evolution after the
separation of sarcopterygians from actinopterygians and
that created an intronless type I IFN gene. In the mammalian lineage, this gene then underwent successive duplications to generate first the alpha and the beta interferons
and then during the mammalian radiation, the numerous
alpha IFN genes [7,8,36]. This key retroposition event has
probably been associated with duplication of receptor
genes that generated the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 genes. The
IFNAR1 gene that was present in amniote ancestors
already had two D200 allowing the building of receptor
complexes with different binding sites that could accommodate the diversification of the ligands [18,27,37,38].
The "IL10 related cytokines" category is represented in
Tetraodon by three genes with four phase 0 introns (IL10,
20 &24). If some have extra-introns, all genes coding for
IL10 related cytokines have the same four phase 0 introns.
The high expression of the TnIL10 gene in the intestine
(figure 2) suggests that the encoded fish cytokine could
play a role similar to that of mammalian IL10 whose function is to keep under strict control the balance between
immune and inflammatory response especially in the
bowels [39,40].
Interestingly these two categories of HCII, despite having
no similarity at the amino acid level, are both encoded by
genes with exactly the same intron/exon structure. The
four phase 0 introns fall at similar positions. This suggests
that both genes derive from a common ancestor harboring the same four phase 0 introns. As in figure 7, we therefore postulate that the ancestor for classII helical cytokine
was encoded by a gene with this intron/exon structure.
The first duplications would have taken place before the
osteichtian radiation and would have generated the ancestral IFN and an ancestor for the IL10 related genes. The
different lineages having then expanded this gene family
by different means of retrotransposition and duplication.
In this context, the gene for amniote type II IFN (gamma
IFN) poses an interesting problem. It has only three phase
0 introns that correspond to the first three introns of both
the ancestral IFN and IL10 related genes. Is it derived from
an IFN gene or from an IL10 related gene? The location of
the human IFN gamma gene on a cluster of classII
cytokine genes including two other genes for the IL10
related cytokines (IL22 and IL26) [19] suggests that it is in
fact derived from an IL10 related gene. Despite the functional similarities of type I and type II IFNs, receptor bind-

Schematic drawing for the diversification of the helical cytokines and their receptors during the evolution of
the osteichthians. Open boxes are for coding exons, black parts for 3' and 5' non coding regions. Broken lines are for
introns; their phase is indicated. For the receptors, broken boxes indicate that all D200 part of larger proteins. Exons are numbered A1 (for the first exon coding the SD100A) to B2 (second exon coding the SD100B). Conserved cysteines are indicated
as vertical bars over the exon boxes. The retroposition event leading to typeI IFNs has only been observed in amniotes and is
therefore labeled "amniote specific". Data from other sarcopterygians could lead to a revision.

ing characteristics of the dimeric forms of IL10 and IFN
gamma also favor a closer relationship between these ligands [41,42].

Conclusions
To the origins of a diversified ligand/receptor system
This work provides an interesting perspective on the evolution and diversification of the classII helical cytokines
and their receptors during the radiation of the osteichtians. It shows that the fine tuning of the main mechanisms for host defense against infections has been
performed independently in the different vertebrate lineages. This is both true for the non specific antiviral
defenses mediated by interferons and for the regulation of

the immune response invented by ancestors of the gnathostomes in which IL10 related cytokines play a major role.
The question remains open of what happened in other
vertebrate lineages, but the most fascinating question is
the origin of this ligand/receptor system. Both genetic
(intron/exon structures) and structural data (conserved
amino acid positions and/or common 3D structures)
argue in favor of a common ancestry for all classII ligand/
receptor systems. The fascinating quest is now to find
organisms that would have retained this single ancestral
ligand/receptor pair and the central question will be: what
is its function? In this perspective, the dome gene of drosophila is intriguing. Primary amino acid sequence clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/29

indicates that it harbors a D200 domain but the intron/
exon structure is not that of the vertebrate HCR genes.
Thedome gene has one D200 domain plus FNIII repeats in
its extracellular domain, but none of the canonical introns
that border such domains in vertebrate genes is conserved
[17]. The dome gene has lost the intron/exon «memory».
Interestingly, it is the only invertebrate gene with a D200
described so far; the expansion of the HCR family has
occurred only in vertebrates. The dome gene could therefore testify for the presence of an HCR ancestor in
invertebrates. The first step in the diversification of this
gene family in deuterostomes or chordates has therefore
been the duplication to generate class I and class II ancestors. We have started the quest for these classI and classII
ancestors by searching homologs of these genes in animal
groups branching close to the vertebrate ancestors. In the
genome of Ciona Intestinalis, we have found just two HCR
genes, one coding for a classI and the other for a classII
receptor. We have started experiments in order to determine in which biological functions they are involved.

Cloning and Quantitative-PCR
Oligonucleotides are listed in Additional file: 1. 3' and
5'RACE were performed using the GeneRacer Kit from
Invitrogen. Amplified products were tested for the presence of specific products using internal oligonucleotides,
cloned using the Topo TA cloning kit from Invitrogen.
Bacterial colonies were screened using the internal oligonucleotide and the plasmids were entirely sequenced. Oligonucleotides TnIFN.52 and TnIFN.32 were used to
amplify the complete ORF of TnIFN. The resulting fragment was digested by NdeI and SacI and cloned in the
pIVEX2.3-MCS vector (Roche) digested by the same
enzymes for the production of recombinant TnIFN with a
Cterm 6His tag. For the Nterm 6His tagging, amplification
was with TnIFN52 and TnIFN33; cloning was in
pIVEX2.4bNde. In vitro production of recombinant IFN
was done using the RTS100 E. coli HY kit from Roche
using 300 ng of CsCl purified plasmid per 10 µl of reaction (3 h incubation at 30°C). Production was checked
using SDS-PAGE.

Methods

Conventional PCR were performed using Platinium Taq
DNA polymerase in a MJ Research PTC200 thermocycler.
Real time Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) were performed
using SYBR GREEN technology in a LightCycler Instrument from Roche. RNA samples were reverse transcribed
using Spl2XhoT18 as primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transriptase as an enzyme [18]. First strand cDNAs were purified using Quiaquick purification columns (Quiagen).

Fish samples and sequences
T nigroviridis imported from Thailand (wild animals) or
from Indonesia (breeders) were purchased at local dealers. Average animal weight was 3 grams. Phenoxy 2 ethanol was used as an anesthetic prior injections or
dissections. PolyI/PolyC treatment was an IP injection of
0.1 ml of a 2.2 mg/ml solution in PBS. RNAs were prepared using the High Pure RNA Tissue Kit from Roche.
Primary cultures of Cephalic Kidney cells were prepared
by scratching the organ in a 200 micron mesh nylon in
DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum. The primary cells were either used as such or separated in heavy and light populations by centrifugation on
a Ficoll cushion. Primary cultures were kept up to 4 days
with 5% CO2 at 30°C.

D. rerio from breeders were purchased at local dealers. The
ZF4/7 (ATCC: CRL-2050) cell line was maintained in the
same conditions as the T. nigroviridis primary cells.
Genomic sequences for the T. nigroviridis genes are assemblies of shotgun reads produced by the Genoscope http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr and the Whitehead Institute
Center
for
Genome
Research
http://
www.genome.wi.mit.edu. The shotgun reads are available
through the Trace Repository at http://trace.ensembl.org/
. They represent a 8.3X genome coverage Assemblies of
small sets of reads (up to a few hundred) were done using
cap http://www.infobiogen.fr. Sequence of the resulting
contigs were finished by designing oligonucleotides and
resequencing regions of problems.

Phylogenetic analysis
Alignments were performed using Clustal and phylogenetic trees were calculated using the Phylo_win package
(distance, PAM) [43]. Drawing of trees was done using
TREEVIEW.

Authors' contributions

and sequencing of the cDNAs coding for the receptors and
their ligands. They also finished the sequencing of the
genes. GL did the biological work with Tetraodons and
zebrafish and drafted the manuscript. KM did the analysis
