Abstract
Background: Since the mid 1990s populations of non-native apple snails (Ampullariidae) have been
discovered with increasing frequency in the continental United States. Given the dramatic effects that
introduced apple snails have had on both natural habitats and agricultural areas in Southeast Asia, their
introduction to the mainland U.S. is cause for concern. We combine phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA
sequences with examination of introduced populations and museum collections to clarify the identities,
introduced distributions, geographical origins, and introduction histories of apple snails.
Results: Based on sampling to date, we conclude there are five species of non-native apple snails in the
continental U.S. Most significantly, we recognize three species within what has been called the channeled
apple snail: Pomacea canaliculata (California and Arizona), Pomacea insularum, (Florida, Texas, and Georgia)
and Pomacea haustrum (Florida). The first established populations of P. haustrum were discovered in the
late 1970s in Palm Beach County Florida, and have not spread appreciably in 30 years. In contrast,
populations of P. insularum were established in Texas by 1989, in Florida by the mid to late 1990s, and in
Georgia by 2005, and this species continues to spread rapidly. Most introduced P. insularum haplotypes are
a close match to haplotypes from the Río Uruguay near Buenos Aires, indicating cold tolerance, with the
potential to spread from Florida, Georgia, and Texas through Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and South
Carolina. Pomacea canaliculata populations were first discovered in California in 1997. Haplotypes of
introduced P. canaliculata match native-range haplotypes from near Buenos Aires, Argentina, also indicating
cold tolerance and the potential to establish farther north.
Conclusion: The term "channeled apple snail" is descriptive of a morphology found in many apple snail
species. It does not identify a single species or a monophyletic group. Clarifying species identifications
permits a more accurate assessment of introduction histories and distributions, and provides a very
different picture of the tempo and pattern of invasions than was inferred when the three species with
channeled sutures were considered one. Matching introduced and native-range haplotypes suggests the
potential for range expansion, with implications for native aquatic ecosystems and species, agriculture, and
human health.

Background
Members of the freshwater gastropod family Ampullariidae, known as apple snails, have an impressive track
record as invasive species. Species in three genera, Pila,
Pomacea, and Marisa, have demonstrated a tenacious ability to survive and spread rapidly in the freshwater habitats
into which they have been introduced [e.g. [1-3]]. Of
these, members of the genus Pomacea, which is native to
South and Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and
the southeastern U.S., have become widely established in
many areas within Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, Guam,
Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Dominican Republic,
parts of the mainland U.S., and possibly Australia [4-6].
Many of these introductions have resulted from the escape
or release of snails from plant or animal aquaculture operations [e.g. [2]]. Other introductions have probably
resulted from release of snails acquired through the pet
trade [e.g. [3]], a common introduction pathway for alien
species [7].
Within the continental U.S., there is only one native apple
snail, Pomacea paludosa. This species is widely distributed
across the wetlands of the Florida peninsula and extends
into Florida's panhandle as far west as the
Choctawhatchee River, and into warm springs in Georgia
[8]. A population also exists in Alabama, where it was
introduced in 1953 [9]. Over the past 50 years, however,
Marisa cornuarietis and several species of Pomacea have
invaded wetlands and waterways of the mainland U.S.,
and established populations of these non-native ampullariids are now present in six states: Alabama, Arizona,
California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas [10]. Since their
initial appearance in the 1950s, the introductions of nonnative apple snails largely occurred unimpeded and without much apparent concern [but see [11]]. This changed
dramatically in the 1990s, however, with the appearance
and rapid spread of channeled apple snails, thought to be
Pomacea canaliculata, in rice-growing areas of Texas.
Channeled apple snails represent a major risk to native
wetland ecosystems and agriculture. The name "channeled apple snail" was first coined as an Anglicization of
the scientific name of the presumed single species Pomacea canaliculata, with reference to the distinct sutural channel between adjacent shell whorls. Nevertheless, this is a
feature of many species of Pomacea, including Pomacea
insularum, and Pomacea haustrum, and it has not been clear
whether channeled apple snails are a single species or
even a monophyletic group [10,12]. In Southeast Asia,
Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea insularum have become
devastating agricultural pests, especially of rice [4-6], raising concern for U.S. rice growing regions. In addition,
these species have the potential to alter native freshwater
habitats significantly, causing shifts in ecosystem state and
function [13]. In response to these concerns, the U.S.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/97

Department of Agriculture began requiring permits for
importation or interstate movement of aquatic snails in
2006, specifically targeting apple snails with the hope of
limiting their spread in the U.S.
Despite mounting concern, the identity of non-native
ampullariids in the continental U.S., their provenance,
current distributions, and means of introduction and
spread remain poorly understood. Difficulty in species
identification is largely a consequence of the overall conservative external morphology of the group combined
with phenotypic plasticity of Pomacea species. Few rigorous morphometric studies have been carried out on the
family [14-16], and the degree of overlap and variability
in shell morphology makes delimitation of many species
based on shell shape unreliable. This difficulty is complicated further by the fact that the aquaculture industry and
pet trade have not been especially concerned with the species-level taxonomy of the snails introduced [e.g. [17]].
The first known ampullariid introduction into the continental U.S. was of Marisa cornuarietis, discovered in South
Florida in 1957 [11] and probably released through the
pet trade. The introduction history of other ampullariids
is less clear. Pomacea bridgesii was first reported in Florida
by Clench in 1966 [18]. In 1978, snails identified as Pomacea canaliculata were collected from Palm Beach County,
Florida [8]. Since then, apple snails with channeled
sutures have been reported in other Florida counties, and
in Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, and Texas, with
many of these reports since about 2000.
A critical first step in management and control of alien
ampullariids is to ascertain what species are present, their
distributions, where they came from, and when the populations became established. By "established" we mean the
presence of self-sustaining populations in natural bodies
of water or man-made canals and lakes, excluding aquaculture facilities and other locations where the snails may
have been maintained in artificial environments. Correct
identification of species and their origins permits access to
published information on their biology and ecology in
their native habitats, which could be useful in understanding the tolerances, potential non-native ranges, and
possible impacts as invasive species. Determining the timing of establishment helps us to understand the epidemiology of the invasion, that is, the rate and dynamics of the
invasion process. Here, we use molecular phylogenetic
analyses to clarify the identities, origins, and distributions
of Pomacea species within the continental U.S. We supplement this with information from museum collections and
illustrate shells and egg masses of each species. We then
attempt to determine the time and place of initial establishment of each species, and discuss potential impacts to
native ecosystems, agriculture, and human health.

Results and Discussion
Species-Level Phylogenetic Analysis
All introduced ampullariids in the continental U.S. fell
into five well-supported clades based on analysis of the 46
unique mtDNA haplotypes (Fig. 1). Based on comparison
with native-range samples and type material, and knowledge of type localities (see below), these clades represented three apple snail species with channeled sutures
(Pomacea insularum, Pomacea canaliculata, and Pomacea
haustrum), and, also, Pomacea diffusa and Marisa cornuarietis. Pomacea canaliculata was strongly supported as sister
to P. insularum, with Pomacea paludosa robustly supported
as sister to these two species.

Discrete P. haustrum and P. diffusa clades formed a clade
that was sister to the P. insularum, P. canaliculata, and P.
paludosa clade. The position of Pomacea camena was not as
robustly supported and varied among gene regions analyzed. Marisa cornuarietis haplotypes formed a well-supported monophyletic clade that was sister to a clade of
Marisa planogyra and Asolene spixii, indicating that Marisa
is not monophyletic.
Of the three apple snail species with channeled sutures in
the continental U.S., Pomacea canaliculata occurred only in
California and Arizona, P. insularum occurred in Texas,
Georgia, and Florida, and P. haustrum was restricted to
Florida.
Our results indicated that: 1) South American Pomacea
were not monophyletic and 2) apple snails with channeled sutures were not monophyletic. This latter result is
perhaps not surprising. The shells of many Pomacea species are similar in overall shape; unadorned spirally coiled
tubes with overlapping whorls that do not depart appreciably from the axis of coiling. Given these general constraints, simple changes in the rate of shell whorl
expansion and translation down the axis of coiling will
affect the degree of overlap of shell whorls, and consequently the degree of channelling of the suture. The
degree of channeling may also be affected by changes in
the cross-sectional shape of the whorl. Convergence in
channeled shells is thus not unexpected among the fifty or
so species within the genus Pomacea.
Taxonomy, Source Populations, and Introduced
Distributions
Our results indicate that five species of non-native ampullariids have been introduced to the continental U.S.
Below, we assess their probable geographic origins, the
timing of their initial introductions, their spread, and current distribution. We conclude with an assessment of the
risks to environments, native species, agriculture, and
human health that these species pose.

Pomacea haustrum (Reeve, 1856)
Pomacea haustrum is a large species with a channeled
suture (Fig. 2b) that is native to Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia
[19]. It was considered a synonym of Pomacea canaliculata
by Thompson [20] based on shell morphology, but tentatively retained as a separate species by Cowie and Thiengo
[12], because of its reported production of green eggs.
Populations sampled in Florida produce bright green egg
masses consisting of individual eggs approximately 3–5
mm in size compressed into polygonal shapes, giving the
egg mass an irregular honeycombed appearance (Fig. 3a).
Since other Pomacea species also produce green eggs [4],
this character is insufficient to verify this species as P. haustrum. Nevertheless, the Florida material corresponds
closely in shell morphology with the possible syntype of

P. haustrum in the Natural History Museum, London (Fig
2b, Fig. 4a, b).
It is difficult to identify even the general region of the type
locality for this species. The type locality was given as the
Río Marañón, Brazil [21], but this river is in Peru, joining
with the Rio Ucayali above Iquitos to become the Rio
Solimões, which in turn joins with the Rio Negro to
become the Amazon River of Brazil. Some of the first
Europeans to explore the region in the sixteenth century,
however, referred to the Amazon River as El Río Marañón,
and some nineteenth century maps refer to the entire
Amazon as the Marañón [22]. It is likely that the Río
Marañón of one collector was not the same as the Río
Marañón of another.
We extracted DNA from a specimen identified as P. haustrum (FMNH 223530) from the Rio Ucayali in Peru, above
its confluence with the Río Marañón. We were able to
amplify an ~511 nucleotide portion of the 16S rRNA gene.
This sequence grouped with specimens from Florida identified as P. haustrum in a well-supported clade (Fig. 5) and
differed over this region by 1.4% (7 nucleotides). We conclude that the sum of current information supports the
identification of this species as Pomacea haustrum, probably derived from populations in the Brazilian or Peruvian
Amazon River system.
The only established populations of P. haustrum known
by us in the U.S. are in Palm Beach County, Florida. As of
June, 2006, adults and egg masses were present in the
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and in canals and
lakes of some surrounding communities (Collins and
Rawlings, pers. obs.).

Pomacea haustrum was reported as established in Palm
Beach County after 1989 [23], although a specimen of P.
haustrum was collected there as early as 1983 [10]. We
believe, however, that specimens collected in the 1970s
and 1980s attributed to P. canaliculata (see below) are P.
haustrum. For example, the earliest Florida specimen identified as P. canaliculata in the Florida Museum of Natural
History (FLMNH 184660) was collected in 1978 from
Palm Beach County and corresponds closely to the possible syntype of P. haustrum (Fig. 4). Also, an egg mass
attributed to P. canaliculata (FLMNH 142245, collected in
1989) has traces of green color, the irregular honeycombed appearance, and the egg size of P. haustrum.
Therefore, P. haustrum was probably introduced and successfully established by the late 1970s, but has failed to
expand its range appreciably since then.
Pomacea canaliculata (Lamarck, 1822)
The apple snails with channeled sutures introduced into
the continental U.S. have been identified as Pomacea
canaliculata [e.g. [20,24]] or referred to as part of the Pomacea canaliculata complex or group [10]. Cowie and
Thiengo [12] listed the native distribution of Pomacea
canaliculata as Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and
Brazil. Nevertheless, Cazzaniga [25] suggested that all

canaliculata-like ampullariids may constitute a single, very
variable species, distributed throughout most of tropical
and warm-temperate South America. The difficulties in
discriminating Pomacea canaliculata and similar species,
particularly Pomacea insularum (see below), have been
noted [26,27] and reflect not only this poor understanding of its native range but also its considerable intraspecific morphological variability [15,28,29]. The type
locality of P. canaliculata (rivières de la Guadeloupe) is
ambiguous, but may refer to Lago Guadeloupe, Argentina
[25].
Introduced populations of Pomacea canaliculata are genetically distinct from those of P. insularum, based on
mtDNA sequences (Fig. 1), but these species have similar
shell morphologies (Fig. 6). The egg masses of P. canaliculata, although bright reddish pink, like those of P. insularum, contain fewer but larger eggs (Fig. 3c) [27].
Clutches of Pomacea insularum often exceed 1,000 eggs
(Fig. 3e). The variability in clutch size reported for P.
canaliculata [4,30] may reflect inclusion of data for other
species, particularly P. insularum. There is some preliminary evidence that these species are reproductively isolated [31].
In our phylogenetic analyses P. canaliculata and P. insularum are reciprocally monophyletic sister taxa (Fig. 7)
with a mean haplotype difference of 6.30%, compared to
1.29% within P. insularum, and 0.02% within P. canaliculata. We found very little genetic variation in P. canaliculata. Over 2,405 aligned positions, the greatest pairwise

difference was 2 nucleotides, and identical haplotypes of
P. canaliculata were found in snails from two locations in
California, Hawaii, and Buenos Aires. The Arizona
sequence differed from the Argentinean one by a single
nucleotide. The source of the introduced populations of P.
canaliculata is therefore likely to be Argentina, specifically
the Buenos Aires area [K.A. Hayes, R.C. Joshi, S.C.
Thiengo, and R.H. Cowie, in prep.].
In the continental U.S., P. canaliculata is found only in Arizona and California, although we have not sampled the
Alabama population of apple snails with channeled
sutures. The East and West coast populations of apple
snails with channeled sutures are therefore different species, and need to be treated as distinct management units.
The match of haplotypes to Hawaiian samples suggests a

with other populations near major human population
centers such as Jacksonville and Tallahassee. We have also
found populations in ecologically sensitive areas including Everglades National Park and Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge.

possible pathway for its introduction to the western U.S.,
via the food trade.
Pomacea canaliculata was reported in Florida and Texas in
the late 1970s, probably based on misidentification of P.
haustrum in Florida and P. insularum in Texas. The earliest
report of an established population of P. canaliculata in
California is 1997 in Lake Miramar, north of San Diego
[24]. The history of other populations in California and
Arizona was reviewed recently [10].
Pomacea insularum (d'Orbigny, 1835)
The difficulties of discriminating Pomacea insularum from
P. canaliculata have been reviewed above. Pomacea insularum is reported from Argentina, Brazil [12], and Bolivia
[32] and it probably occurs in Uruguay and Paraguay.

The type locality is the Río Paraná, which joins the Río
Uruguay just above Buenos Aires, forming the Río de la
Plata. The area between the Paraná and the Uruguay is the
Argentine province of Entre Ríos, the southern part of
which is marshy, with channels connecting the Paraná
and the Uruguay. We sampled a specimen of P. insularum
(FLMNH 159738) from Concepción del Uruguay on the
Uruguay, which is closely linked to the type locality. We
amplified and sequenced ~1,900 nucleotides, which corresponded closely to sequences from several populations
of introduced P. insularum, differing by only two nucleotides
(0.1%).
Based on our analyses to date, P. insularum is restricted to
Texas, Florida, and Georgia. It has been recorded from a
large number of localities in Florida (Fig. 8), the majority
in the center of the state between Tampa and Orlando, but

Pomacea insularum has not been reported previously in the
continental U.S. Specimens identified as P. canaliculata,
collected in 1978 in Palm Beach County, are P. haustrum
(above). When, then, did P. insularum become established
in Florida? Winner [23] reported ampullariids with pink
egg masses in Florida fish farms in 1991. Specimens collected in Hillsborough (FLMNH 261647) and Collier
Counties (FLMNH 254749) in Florida in 1996 may be P.
insularum. At present, the earliest genetically confirmed
specimen that is from the location of an extant population
was collected in 2002 in Lake Munson (FLMNH 298514).
Many populations were discovered in Florida from 2004
to 2006. The establishment of P. insularum, misidentified
as P. canaliculata, may be considerably more recent than
has heretofore been thought, and its spread may therefore
be much more rapid than has been appreciated.
Howells et al. [10] reviewed the distribution history of P.
insularum (as "Pomacea canaliculata-group") in Texas. The
first established population (identified as P. canaliculata)
was discovered in 1989 in Houston (Harris County) [33].
Populations have since been documented in the surrounding counties of Brazoria, Galveston, Waller, Fort
Bend, and Chambers [10].
In Georgia, P. insularum was first collected from the Alabaha River, in Blackshear (Pierce County) in February
2005. Other populations, some established, have since
been discovered in ponds and streams of the Alabaha
River, on St. Simon's Island (Glynn County) and at the
mouth of the St. Marys River (Camden County) (Brett
Albanese, pers. comm.).
We found considerable intraspecific variation and wellsupported phylogenetic structure in P. insularum (Fig. 1),
although missing data from a few museum specimens
degraded clade support in the P. insularum-P. canaliculata
analysis that encompassed all specimens (Fig. 7). The
Georgia, Texas, and the majority of the Florida samples
grouped with the Argentina samples from the Río Uruguay (Fig. 7). Statistical parsimony analysis showed that
the Argentina haplotype was nested within the network of
introduced haplotypes, further supporting its close relationship to introduced populations (Fig. 9). Although the
majority of introduced snails sampled were most closely
related to the Río Uruguay haplotype, a small number
formed a distinct well-supported clade (Fig. 7), with weak
support for its placement as sister to the clade of Argentinean haplotypes in the full haplotype analysis (Fig. 1).

a larger circle encompasses the area. Localities are based on
our own observations/collections and a database compiled by
Dana Denson, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, as of June 2006.

In the analysis of all P. insularum sampled, this clade was
nested, although not robustly, between two clades made
up of native-range samples from Brazil (Fig. 7). We do not
know yet whether these two clades differ in ecologically
relevant traits.
Pomacea diffusa Blume, 1957
Pomacea diffusa is known as the spike-topped apple snail,
because of its relatively raised spire. It lacks a channeled
suture, and overlaps in size with the native P. paludosa
(Fig. 2a) [8]. The egg masses have an irregular honeycombed appearance, like those of P. haustrum, but are
smaller and have a tan to salmon color (Fig. 3b), although
the egg masses are white when freshly laid. Pomacea diffusa
was originally described as a subspecies of Pomacea bridgesii. Pain [19] argued that P. bridgesii bridgesii was a larger
form with a restricted range, with the smaller P. bridgesii
diffusa being the common form throughout the Amazon
Basin (Brazil, Peru, Bolivia). Cowie and Thiengo [12] suggested that the latter might deserve full species status, and
the two taxa have been confirmed as distinct species by
genetic analyses [[27], K.A. Hayes, R.C. Joshi, S.C. Thiengo
and R.H. Cowie, in prep.].

The type locality of Pomacea diffusa is in the city of Santa
Cruz, Bolivia, although the species is widespread through-

out the Amazon Basin. Three samples from Belém, Brazil,
formed a well-supported clade with non-native populations from Florida and Cuba (Fig. 5), exhibiting 0.4 to
1.8% sequence difference from the introduced populations.
Thompson [8] recorded this species (as P. bridgesii) in
Florida in Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach,
and Pinellas Counties. The FLMNH electronic database
also lists samples from Alachua County, but records cited
from the FLMNH database for Brevard County [e.g. [10]])
are in fact from Broward County. We have also collected
this species in Hillsborough and Collier Counties.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:97

Pomacea diffusa was first recorded in Florida (as P. bridgesii) by Clench [18]. The FLMNH has specimens collected
in Palm Beach County in 1967 (FLMNH 20295) and
Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in the early 1970s
(FLMNH 22175, 222247). Howells et al. [10] reported its
establishment in Mobile, Alabama in 2003.
Marisa cornuarietis (Linnaeus, 1758)
Marisa cornuarietis is a distinctive planispiral ampullariid
(Fig. 10). Its egg masses are unique among introduced
ampullariids in being gelatinous throughout development and in being laid in water [34]. It is widespread in
northern South America, although the type locality is
unknown. There are currently two recognized species in
the genus, M. cornuarietis and M. planogyra [12]. We
included samples of both species in our analysis: nonnative M. cornuarietis from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, and M. planogyra from its native Pantanal region
of Brazil, near its type locality. We also included Asolene
spixii, which clustered within the Marisa clade, thereby
rendering Marisa paraphyletic. The introduced Marisa we
sampled fell within a well-supported clade of Marisa cornuarietis.

Marisa cornuarietis was first discovered in Coral Gables,
Florida, in 1957 [11]. It has spread to many other counties
in southern Florida [[8], Rawlings and Collins, pers. obs.].
It was first found in Texas in 1983 [35] and has also been
reported in California and Idaho [10]. Its potential ecological impacts have been reviewed recently [10].
Potential Impacts of Non-native Pomacea
Pomacea haustrum is currently of relatively minor concern
in the U.S., given its failure to spread beyond Palm Beach

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/97

County after 30 years or more in Florida. It should be
noted, however, that many species have maintained limited distributions, sometimes for decades, before becoming invasive [36]. Pomacea diffusa has generally been
assumed also to pose little threat in the U.S. and it is the
only apple snail for which interstate transport is permitted. This lack of concern may be unwarranted. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture considered it (as P. bridgesii) to
be innocuous [37], presumably based on a study that concluded that it feeds primarily on aufwuchs, not macrophytes [38]. The potential effects of Pomacea diffusa in
natural habitats are unknown, but a conflicting study
reports that, in addition to macrophytes, it will feed readily on animal carcasses, live worms, and the eggs of
planorbid snails [39]. It may therefore have direct effects
on both aquatic vegetation and native snails and compete
for food with native scavengers such as crayfish, shrimp,
and fish.
Pomacea insularum and P. canaliculata pose the greatest
threat to agriculture and native wetland ecosystems in the
U.S. One of the better predictors of the effect of an invasive species is the effect of the species or related species in
other areas where it has been introduced [40]. The potential of P. canaliculata has been clearly demonstrated in
Southeast Asia where its introduction into a tropical wetland ecosystem in Thailand resulted in dramatic changes
in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [13,41,42], and
by its devastating effects on agriculture, especially wetland
rice production [4-6]. Currently, the occurrence of P.
canaliculata has been confirmed in California and Arizona
in the continental U.S. However, it has the potential to
spread into other areas, including the rice-growing parts
of California, where it could cause serious damage.
Some of the ecological and agricultural impacts in Asia
associated with P. canaliculata are almost certainly attributable to Pomacea insularum. This species is also widespread in the region [[27,43], K.A. Hayes, R.C. Joshi, S.C.
Thiengo, and R.H. Cowie, in prep.; see below], but has not
been explicitly acknowledged as a serious pest because of
the confusion in identification of these two species, with
most of the literature referring to P. canaliculata. Pomacea
insularum may therefore be likely to have a significant
impact on aquatic ecosystems and pose a threat to crops
in the southeastern U.S. [10], particularly given the potential for it to spread through parts of Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas.

The match of introduced haplotypes of P. canaliculata and
P. insularum to native Argentinean samples from approximately 35°S suggests that the introduced populations of
these species may be cold tolerant and capable of surviving occasional frosts. Moreover, P. canaliculata occurs as
far as 38–39°S, and topography rather than climate may

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:97

set the natural southern limit of this species [44,45]. The
average minimum monthly temperature in Buenos Aires
is 4–6 degrees Celsius (39–43 degrees Fahrenheit) from
May to September, slightly lower than the average minimum winter monthly temperatures in Charleston, South
Carolina. Consequently, P. insularum could potentially
spread at least this far north on the Atlantic Coastal Plain,
and through parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Texas on the Gulf Coastal Plain. Similarly, P. canaliculata
may be able to spread from its current introduced locations in California at least as far north as San Francisco.
Ecological niche modeling based on the native and introduced range of these species [e.g. [46]] will permit a more
refined estimate of potential introduced ranges. An
important caveat here is that reports of the native ranges
of these two species may be commingled.
P. insularum also poses threats for the native apple snail,
Pomacea paludosa, and the species that rely on it for food.
Pomacea paludosa is recognized by its size (40–70 mm
height), low spire, absence of a channel at the suture, and
distinctive egg masses [8]. Mature egg masses have an
average of thirty round pale pink to white eggs averaging
4 mm in size in grape-like clusters [47] (Fig. 3d), although
when freshly laid, the eggs are pale orange salmon colored
and in a thick mucus matrix (Fig. 11). Those planning
control measures aimed at non-native apple snails in Florida must ensure they have not inadvertently targeted the
native apple snails or their eggs.
In addition to collateral damage from control of nonnative species, "extinction by hybridization" [48] could
result from hybridization of P. paludosa with non-native

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/97

species, which seems possible given the close phylogenetic relationship of P. insularum and P. paludosa. There is
also the possibility of competitive interactions between
native and non-native snails [49]. Introduced Pomacea
spp. have been reported to consume the eggs of both congenerics and other snails and invertebrates [39,50,51]. We
have anecdotally noted a decline in abundance or the
apparent disappearance of P. paludosa following introduction of P. insularum (Collins and Rawlings, pers. obs.).
Pomacea paludosa is the primary food of the endangered
Everglade Snail Kite [52], and an important food for other
birds, including the limpkin, as well as fish, turtles, and
alligators. At Lake Tohopekaliga (Collins and Rawlings,
pers. obs.), limpkins are routinely taking P. insularum for
food.
Finally, introduction of all non-native ampullariids is a
concern because of the suite of associated parasites and
their potential effects on apple snail predators and
humans. We know nothing at present about the parasites
of introduced ampullariids in the continental U.S. Ampullariids, including Pomacea canaliculata, are intermediate
hosts of important vertebrate parasites [53], most notably
nematodes in the genus Parastrongylus (=Angiostrongylus).
Parastrongylus cantonensis causes eosinophilic meningoencephalitis [54], and P. costaricensis causes abdominal angiostrongyliasis in humans [55]. Transmission of
Parastrongylus infections to mammalian hosts requires
development to the L3 larval stage in an intermediate gastropod host. The spread of Pomacea species may therefore
facilitate the spread of Parastrongylus species by completing the life cycle required to infect mammalian hosts. In
Beijing, China, consumption of snails identified as Pomacea canaliculata resulted in 131 cases of human Parastrongylus cantonensis infection during a 4-month period [56].
Parastrongylus cantonensis and/or P. costaricensis are established in Florida and Louisiana [55,57-59], so the potential interaction of Pomacea insularum with Parastrongylus
species is a concern.

Clarification of species identifications, introduced ranges,
and native ranges provides a more accurate picture of the
tempo of apple snail invasions in the continental U.S.,
and suggests considerable potential for future range
expansion. The situation is dynamic: during the time in
which this paper was written, a new population of apple
snails with channeled sutures has been discovered in New
Orleans (S. Longman, pers. comm.), and preliminary
genetic data (T. Collins and J. Bernatis, unpublished data)
suggest that a population of P. canaliculata is present in
north Florida. Considerable work remains to be done. We
have sampled only about one quarter of the Florida populations of apple snails with channeled sutures, and the
ranges of introduced ampullariids remain incompletely

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:97

known. Other species may yet be discovered in introduced
populations. At present, a combination of genetic data,
morphological characters, and egg mass morphology is
the best strategy for definitive identification. Finally, our
genetic results are based on a single marker, although preliminary evidence from the nuclear histone 3 gene gives
similar results [Hayes et al., in prep]. Higher resolution
markers such as microsatellites may be useful in indicating the pathways by which non-native snails are spreading
rapidly through parts of the U.S.

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction, and sequencing
We sampled native Pomacea paludosa in Florida and nonnative apple snails in Florida, Georgia, Texas, California,
Arizona, Hawaii, Cuba, and Guadeloupe in the Lesser
Antilles [see Additional file 1]. These included taxa identified as Pomacea canaliculata or Pomacea canaliculata-group,
Pomacea bridgesii, Pomacea haustrum, Marisa cornuarietis,
Pila conica and Pila polita. We also sampled native-range
populations of Pomacea canaliculata-group snails, Pomacea
haustrum, Pomacea diffusa, Pomacea camena, Asolene spixii,
Marisa planogyra, and Pila polita. Pila conica was used as an
outgroup for phylogenetic analyses [60,61]. Specimens
were also obtained from the Bishop Museum (Honolulu,
BPBM), Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago,
FMNH), Florida Museum of Natural History (Gainesville,
FLMNH), the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle
(Paris, MNHN), and the Natural History Museum (London, BMNH) for both molecular and morphological comparisons.

DNA was isolated from ~50 mg of tissue using standard
phenol/chloroform methods [62], or Qiagen's Dneasy
extraction kit. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
used to amplify two portions of the mitochondrial
genome. The first consisted of ~1,900 nucleotides spanning the 3'end of the 12S rRNA, the intervening tRNA
valine and the 5'end of the 16S rRNA. This region was
amplified in two overlapping portions using the primers
12Sai [5'-AAACTAGGATTAGATACCCTATTAT-3'; 63] with
16Srgast [5'-GCCATGATGCAAAAGGTAC-3'], and 12Sf
[5'-GCACACATCGCCCGTCGCTCT-3'; reverse complement of 12Sb' in 63] with 16SbrH-alt [5'-CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCATGT-3'; slight modification of 16Sbr in
63]. The second region was a ~658 nucleotide portion of
the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene amplified
using slightly degenerate versions of standard primers
[64]. Reactions were performed in a MJ Research PTC-200
thermal cycler in 50 μl volumes with 1.5 mM MgCl2, each
dNTP at 200 micromolar, 10–100 nanograms of genomic
DNA, and 1X Promega buffer B, and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). PCR products were
purified with a GeneClean III Kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, California), and cycle-sequenced with Big Dye version 3.1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/97

chemistry following the manufacturer's protocol (PEABI). Sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI
Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. All samples were sequenced
on both strands and sequences have been deposited in
GenBank: rRNAs [GenBank: EF519073–EF519181,
AY449500] and COI [GenBank: EF514942–EF515081].
COI sequences were generated for 141 snails. The 12S-16S
region was sequenced for representatives of each unique
COI haplotype and locality combination, for a data set of
108 individuals. For some specimens, primarily museum
specimens, amplification did not work for all gene
regions, and different gene regions failed to amplify in different snails, resulting in snails with no sequence in common. This resulted in significant degradation of support
values. We therefore selected the 95 individuals with both
gene regions completely sequenced, representing 46
unique haplotypes, for the among-species phylogenetic
analysis. Nevertheless, some individuals with a great deal
of missing data were important for matching introduced
haplotypes to native ranges, and were therefore used for
within-species analyses and haplotype networks.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
COI sequences were aligned at the amino-acid level and
back aligned to nucleotides without indels in MacClade
[65]. The rRNA sequences were aligned using T-Coffee
[66] on the IGS server with default settings [67]. We tested
alignment sensitivity by repeating phylogenetic analyses
on a data set in which ambiguously aligned regions were
removed by excluding positions in each direction until we
came to nucleotides that were invariant in all taxa in the
analysis [68].

We used maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods for
phylogenetic analyses. Maximum parsimony bootstrap
analyses were performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [69] with
equal weighting, uninformative characters excluded, and
gaps treated as missing data. Three hundred bootstrap replicates with 10 random sequence additions per replicate
(RSAs) and TBR branch swapping were performed using
the heuristic search option. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select the most appropriate model
of sequence evolution using Modeltest 3.07 [70]. Results
indicated that the 12S-16S sequence and the intervening
tRNA sequence could be combined in one partition. The
COI sequence was divided into 3 partitions by codon
position. The parameters determined by Modeltest were
used to specify the models of sequence evolution, and as
priors for the Bayesian analyses, which were performed
using MRBAYES 3.1.2 [71]. The prior distributions for the
Bayesian analyses were as follows: topology uniform;
branch lengths exponential with parameter = 10.0;
gamma shape parameter exponential with parameter = 5;
proportion invariant sites uniform over the interval (0, 1);

and substitution rate matrix and base frequencies Dirichlet with starting values from Modeltest. We employed 4
Markov chains for 3–6 million generations and the partition-specific models described. Trees were sampled every
100th generation, discarding the first 33% of sampled
trees as burn-in. We initiated two simultaneous runs from
different random starting trees, and convergence was
inferred when the average standard deviation of split frequencies approached 0.01, and the potential scale reduction factor for all parameters approached 1.0.
To explore further the relationships among introduced
haplotypes of P. insularum from Florida, Texas, Georgia,
and native-range populations, we performed a statistical
parsimony analysis using TCS [version 1.20, 72]. We
included 48 individuals based on the results of phylogenetic analyses (below). Some museum specimens did not
amplify for all regions, resulting in significant missing
data for a few individuals. Because missing data may cause
problems related to calculated distances and collapsing of
haplotypes in the program TCS, we eliminated characters
with missing data or individuals with excessive missing
data, and performed the TCS analysis based on 1781
nucleotides for which there are no missing data, with a
parsimony limit of 90%.
