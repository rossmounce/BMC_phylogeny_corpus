Abstract
Background: Rare coding variants constitute an important class of human genetic variation, but are
underrepresented in current databases that are based on small population samples. Recent studies show that
variants altering amino acid sequence and protein function are enriched at low variant allele frequency, 2 to 5%,
but because of insufficient sample size it is not clear if the same trend holds for rare variants below 1% allele
frequency.
Results: The 1000 Genomes Exon Pilot Project has collected deep-coverage exon-capture data in roughly 1,000
human genes, for nearly 700 samples. Although medical whole-exome projects are currently afoot, this is still the
deepest reported sampling of a large number of human genes with next-generation technologies. According to
the goals of the 1000 Genomes Project, we created effective informatics pipelines to process and analyze the data,
and discovered 12,758 exonic SNPs, 70% of them novel, and 74% below 1% allele frequency in the seven
population samples we examined. Our analysis confirms that coding variants below 1% allele frequency show
increased population-specificity and are enriched for functional variants.
Conclusions: This study represents a large step toward detecting and interpreting low frequency coding variation,
clearly lays out technical steps for effective analysis of DNA capture data, and articulates functional and population
properties of this important class of genetic variation.

Background
The allelic spectrum of variants causing common human
diseases has long been a topic of debate [1,2]. Whereas
many monogenic diseases are typically caused by extremely rare (<<1%), heterogeneous, and highly penetrant
alleles, the genetic basis of common diseases remains largely unexplained [3]. The results of hundreds of genomewide association scans have demonstrated that common
genetic variation accounts for a non-negligible but modest
proportion of inherited risk [4,5], leading many to suggest

recently that rare variants may contribute substantially to
the genetic burden underlying common disease. Data
from deep sampling of small numbers of loci have confirmed the population-genetic prediction [6,7] that rare
variants constitute the vast majority of polymorphic sites
in human populations. Most are absent from current databases [8], which are dominated by sites discovered from
smaller population samples, and are consequently biased
toward common variants. Analysis of whole exome data
from a modest number of samples (n = 35) suggests that
natural selection is likely to constrain the vast majority of
deleterious alleles (at least those that alter amino acid
identity and, therefore, possibly protein function) to low
frequencies (<1%) under a plethora of evolutionary models
for the distribution of fitness effects consistent with

patterns of human exomic variation [9]. However, in order
to broadly characterize the contribution of rare variants to
human genetic variability and to inform medical sequencing projects seeking to identify disease-causing alleles,
one must first be able to systematically sample variants
below an alternative allele frequency (AF) of 1%.
Recent technical developments have produced a series
of new DNA sequencing platforms that can generate
hundreds of gigabases of data per instrument run at a
rapidly diminishing cost. Innovations in oligonucleotide
synthesis have also enabled a series of laboratory methods for targeted enrichment of specific DNA sequences
(Figure S1 in Additional file 1). These capture methods
can be applied at low cost, and large scale, to analyze the
coding regions of genes, where genomic changes that
most likely influence gene function can be recognized.
Together, these two technologies present the opportunity
to obtain full exome sequence for population samples
sufficiently large to capture a substantial collection of
rare variants.
The 1000 Genomes Exon Pilot (Exon Pilot) Project set
out to use capture sequencing to compile a large catalog
of coding sequence variants with four goals in mind: (1) to
drive the development of capture technologies; (2) to
develop tools for effective downstream analysis of targeted
capture sequencing data; (3) to better understand the distribution of coding variation across populations; and (4) to
assess the functional qualities of coding variants and their
allele frequencies, based on the representation of both
common (AF > 10%), intermediate (1% < AF < 10%) and
low frequency (AF < 1%) sites. To attain these objectives,
while simultaneously improving DNA enrichment methods, we targeted approximately 1,000 genes in 800 individuals, from seven populations representing Africa (LWK,
YRI), Asia (CHB, CHD, JPT), and Europe (CEU, TSI) in
roughly equal proportions (Table 1).

Results and discussion
Data collection and quality control

Four data collection centers, the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), the Broad Institute (BI), the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute, and Washington University applied different combinations of solid-phase or liquid-phase capture, and Illumina or 454 sequencing procedures on
subsets of the samples (Materials and methods). In order
to aggregate the data for a comparison of analytical
methods, a set of consensus exon target regions was
derived (Materials and methods; Figure S2 in Additional
file 1). After filtering out genes that could not be fully
tested because of failed capture or low sequence coverage, and samples that showed evidence of cross-contamination, a final sequence data set was assembled that
corresponded to a total of 1.43 Mb of exonic sequence
(8,279 exons representing 942 genes) in 697 samples (see
section 3, ‘Data quality control’ and Figure S3 in Additional file 1 for details of our quality control procedures).
The project was closely coordinated with two related
Pilot programs in the ongoing 1000 Genomes Project,
the Trio Sequencing Pilot and the Low Coverage Sequencing Pilot, enabling quality control and performance
comparisons.
Data processing and variant analysis

Two separate and complementary pipelines (Materials
and methods; Figure 1a), developed at Boston College
(BC) and the BI, were used to identify SNPs in the
sequence data. The main functional steps in both pipelines were as follows: (1) read mapping to align the
sequence reads to the genome reference sequence; (2)
alignment post-processing to remove duplicate sequence
fragments and recalibrate base quality values; (3) variant
calling to identify putative polymorphic sites; and (4)
variant filtering to remove likely false positive calls.

Mapping

In both pipelines, the individual sequence reads were
first mapped to the genome (using the entire human
reference sequence, as opposed to just the targeted
regions), with the MOSAIK [10] program (at BC), and a
combination of the MAQ [11] and SSAHA2 [12] mapping programs (at BI) (Materials and methods).
Alignment post-processing

Mapped reads were filtered to remove duplicate reads
resulting from clonal amplification of the same fragments
during library construction and sequencing. If kept, such
duplicate reads would interfere with variant detection.
We also applied a base quality re-calibration procedure
that resulted in a much better correspondence of the
base quality values to actual base error rates (Figure S4 in
Additional file 1), a property that is essential for accurate
variant detection.
There was substantial heterogeneity in the depth of coverage of different regions that were targeted for capture
(Figure 2a), reflecting different affinities for individual
probes. Although the coverage variance was generally
reproducible from experiment to experiment, additional
variance could be attributed to individual samples, capture
reagents, or sequencing platforms (Table 1). Despite this
variance, >87% of the target sites in all samples have at
least 5× read coverage, >80% at least 10×, and >62% at
least 20× (Figure 2b).
Variant calling

The two pipelines differed in the variant calling procedures. Two different Bayesian algorithms (Unified Genotyper [13] at BI, GigaBayes at BC: see Materials and
methods) were used to identify SNPs based on read alignments produced by the two different read mapping procedures. Another important difference between the BI and
BC call sets was that the BI calls were made separately
within each of the seven study populations, and the called
sites merged post hoc, whereas the BC calls were made
simultaneously in all 697 samples.
Variant filtering

Both raw SNP call sets were filtered using variant quality
(representing the probability that the called variant is a
true polymorphism as opposed to a false positive call).
The BC set was only filtered on this variant quality and
required a high-quality variant genotype call from at least
one sample. The BI calls were additionally filtered to
remove spurious calls that most likely stem from mapping artifacts (for example, calls that lie in the proximity
of a homopolymer run, in low sequence coverage, or
where the balance of reads for the alternative versus the
reference allele was far from the expected proportions;
see Materials and methods for more details). Results
from the two pipelines, for each of the seven populationspecific sample sets, are summarized in Table 2. The
overlap between the two data sets (that is, sites called by

Page 4 of 17

both algorithms) represented highly confident calls, as
characterized by a high ratio of transitions to transversions, and was designated as the Exon Pilot SNP release
(Table 1). This set comprised 12,758 distinct genomic
locations containing variants in one or more samples in
the exon target regions, with 70% of these (8,885) representing previously unknown (that is, novel) sites. All data
corresponding to the release, including sequence alignments and variant calls, are available through the 1000
Genomes Project ftp site [14].
Specificity and sensitivity of the SNP calls

A series of validation experiments (see Materials and
methods; Table S1 in Additional file 1), based on random
subsets of the calls, demonstrated that the sequence-based
identification of SNPs in the Exon Pilot SNP release was
highly accurate. More than 91% of the experimental assays
were successful (that is, provided conclusive positive or
negative confirmation of the variant) and therefore could
be used to assess validation rates. The overall variant validation rate (see Table S2 in Additional file 1 for raw outcomes; see Table S3 in Additional file 1 and Table 3 for
rates) was estimated at 96.6% (98.8% for alternative allele
count (AC) 2 to 5, and 93.8% for singletons (AC = 1) in
the full set of 697 samples). The validation experiments
also allowed us to estimate the accuracy of genotype
calling in the samples, at sites called by both algorithms,
as >99.8% (see Table S4 in Additional file 1 for raw outcomes; see Table S5 in Additional file 1 for rates). Reference allele homozygotes were the most accurate (99.9%),
followed by heterozygote calls (97.0%), and then alternative allele homozygotes (92.3%) (Table S5 in Additional
file 1). Although the main focus of our validation experiments was to estimate the accuracy of the Exon Pilot SNP
release calls, a small number of sites only called by the BC
or the BI pipeline were also assayed (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Although there were not enough sites to
thoroughly understand all the error modes, these experiments suggest that the homopolymer and allele balance
filters described above are effective in identifying false
positive sites from the unfiltered call set.
We performed in silico analyses (see Materials and
methods) to estimate the sensitivity of our calls. In particular, a comparison with variants from the CEU samples
that overlap those in HapMap3.2 indicated that our average variant detection sensitivity was 96.8%. A similar
comparison with shared samples in the 1000 Genomes
Trio Pilot data also showed a sensitivity >95% (see section 7, ‘SNP quality metrics - sensitivity of SNP calls’, in
Additional file 1). When the sensitivity was examined as
a function of alternative allele count within the CEU
sample (Figure 3), most missed sites were singletons and
doubletons. The sensitivity of the intersection call set was
31% for singletons and 60% for doubletons. For AC > 2,

sensitivity was better than 95%. The strict requirement
that variants had to be called by both pipelines weighted
accuracy over sensitivity and was responsible for the
majority of the missed sites. Using less strict criteria,
there was evidence for 73% of singletons and 89% of doubletons in either the BC or the BI unfiltered dataset.
We investigated other, data-related determinants of
singleton detection sensitivity, beyond the impact of the
Project’s decision to form the official Exon Pilot variant
list as the intersection of the two independently derived
call sets (see section 7.1, ‘Sensitivity of singleton detection’, in Additional file 1, and Figure S7 in Additional file
1). Singleton detection sensitivity improves significantly
from low (1× to 9×) to medium (10× to 29×) read coverage (although there is no further improvement beyond
30× coverage). Importantly, approximately 9% (9 of 97)
of HapMap3.2 singletons in the 84 samples shared with
the Exon Pilot CEU sample panel had zero read coverage
in our data. There was no significant difference in sensitivity between the Illumina and 454 reads, at comparable
sequence coverage. Based on these observations, the
main data-related reason for lower singleton sensitivity is

lack of sufficient read coverage in the samples that have
the singleton. Finally, our analysis (data not shown)
revealed that, even at some of the sites with >100× read
coverage in the sample with the putative HapMap3 singleton, there were no reads showing the alternative allele,
and therefore it would not be possible to call the sites
from the primary data. These cases represent either sites
with allele-specific capture (that is, fragments with the
alternative allele were not captured) or false positive sites
in the HapMap3 study.
Nucleotide diversity and allele frequency distributions

The high quality of the data enabled us to accurately estimate values of nucleotide diversity, a commonly used
measure of genetic variability within populations, in the
coding regions (using pair-wise heterozygosity as our
metric (section 8, ‘Heterozygosity estimates’, in Additional
file 1) within each of the seven populations (Table 1).
These estimates were confirmed in the 1000 Genomes
Low Coverage Pilot data in the Exon Pilot target regions
(Table S9a in Additional file 1). Nucleotide diversity in the
coding regions was 47.3 to 48.4% of the genome-averaged
value for the corresponding population (Table S9b in
Additional file 1). As expected, diversity was substantially
higher in African than in European and Asian populations.
It was, however, very similar for populations within the
same continent (Table S9c in Additional file 1). Missense
variation is substantially reduced (for example, compared
to four-fold degenerate sites, where a single base substitution does not alter the amino acid) as a result of purifying
selection. In turn, diversity at four-fold degenerate sites is
comparable to average genomic diversity, consistent with
very weak selection, if any. Diversity ratios across site
types (for example, missense, four-fold degenerate) and
datasets (for example, Exon Pilot, Low Coverage Pilot) are
highly consistent between populations.
We compared the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) in
the sequenced coding regions among the Exon Pilot populations (Figure 4a). The high sensitivity assures us that the
observed AFS are accurate for AC > 2 (or AF > approximately 1%). The AFS were very similar for populations
from the same continent, except for the JPT population,
where we observed a significantly lower fraction of rare
alleles than in the two other Asian populations, consistent

with reduced recent population growth in Japanese.
Despite the large difference among continents at low AF,
they converged at higher AF, reflecting the greater age of
common variants, many of which pre-date the expansion
of modern humans out of Africa. In all seven populations,
there was a notable excess of rare variants compared to
predictions for a constant-size, neutrally evolving population. This effect was enhanced at missense sites (Figure
4b), which were more highly represented at low alternative
allele frequency than silent variants, as well as intergenic
variants from the HapMap Encyclopedia of Coding Elements Project (ENCODE) re-sequencing study. The
apparent excess of high frequency derived sites has often
been observed in studies of human AFS, and may in part
be due to ancestral misidentification [15].
Rare and common variants according to functional
categories

Recent reports [16] have also recognized an excess of
rare, missense variants at frequencies in the range of 2 to

5%, and suggested that such variants arose recently
enough to escape negative selection pressures [9]. The
present study is the first to broadly ascertain the fraction
of variants down to approximately 1% frequency across
nearly 700 samples. Based on the observed AFS (Figure
4c), 73.7% of the variants in our collection are in the sub1% category, and an overwhelming majority of them
novel (Figure 4c, inset). The discovery of so many sites at
low allele frequency provided a unique opportunity to
compare functional properties of common and rare
variants.
We used three approaches to classify the functional
spectrum (see Materials and methods): (i) impact on the
amino acid sequence (silent, missense, nonsense); (ii)
functional prediction based on evolutionary conservation
and effect on protein structure by computational methods (SIFT [17] and PolyPhen-2 [18]); and (iii) presence in
a database of human disease mutations (Human Gene
Mutation Database (HGMD)). All three indicators
showed a substantial enrichment of functional variants in

Figure 4 Allele frequency properties of the Exon Pilot SNP variants. (a) The allele frequency spectra (AFS) for each of the seven population
panels sequenced in this study, projected to 100 chromosomes, using chimpanzee as a polarizing out-group. The expected AFS for a constant
population undergoing neutral evolution, θ/x, corresponds to a straight line of slope -1 on this graph (shown here for the average value of the
Watterson’s θ nucleotide diversity parameter over the seven populations). Individuals with low coverage or high HapMap discordance (section 9,
‘Allele sharing among populations’, in Additional file 1) have not been used in this analysis. (b) Comparison of the site frequency spectra
obtained from silent and missense sites in the Exon Pilot, as well as intergenic regions from the HapMap resequencing of ENCODE regions,
within CEU population samples. The frequency spectra are normalized to 1, and S indicates the total number of segregating sites in each AFS.
Individuals with low coverage or high HapMap discordance (section 9 in Additional file 1) have not been used in this analysis. (c) Allele
frequency spectrum considering all 697 Exon Pilot samples. The inset shows the AFS at low alternative allele counts, and the fraction of known

the low frequency category within our data (Figure 5).
First, and as noted by other studies [19,20], we saw a
highly significant difference (P << 10-16) in the AFS of
silent versus missense variants (Figure 5a) with a skew
towards rare alleles in the latter, so that approximately
63% of missense variants were <1% in frequency whereas
approximately 53% of silent variants fell into this category. The same patterns held for nonsense versus either
silent or missense variants (P << 10-16) where approximately 78% of nonsense variants were below AF = 1%.
Second, we found that PolyPhen-2/SIFT damaging

predictions (Figure 5b) were likewise enriched in the rare
part of the spectrum (approximately 72% for damaging
versus 63% for possibly damaging, and 61% benign). This
observation goes an important step beyond the enrichment of amino acid changing variants because the PolyPhen-2/SIFT programs make specific predictions about
whether or not such a variant is damaging to protein
function. Error rate variation between different AFS bins
was not a significant confounder for these conclusions:
error rates were estimated at 6.2%, 3.2% and 3.4% for different AFS bins (Tables S3, S4 and S5 in Additional

Figure 5 The distribution of functionally characterized Exon Pilot SNPs according to minor allele frequency within all samples. (a)
Annotation according to amino acid change. The distribution of the Exon Pilot coding SNPs classified according to amino acid change
introduced by the alternative allele (silent, missense, and nonsense) is shown, as a function of AF. Both missense and nonsense variants are
enriched in the rare allele frequency bin compared to silent variants, with highly significant P << 10-16. The differences remain significant after
correcting for the differential error rates in different bins (P << 10-16 for missense, and P << 10-5 for nonsense). (b) Computational prediction of
functional impact. The distribution of SNPs classified according to functional impact (benign, possibly damaging, and damaging) based on
computational predictions by the SIFT and PolyPhen-2 programs, as a function of allele frequency. In case of disagreement, the more severe
classification was used. Silent SNPs are also shown, as neutral internal control for each bin. The damaging variants are highly enriched in the rare
bin compared to the silent variants with highly significant P << 10-16. This remains significant after correcting for the differential error rates in
different bins (P << 10-16). (a-b) Allele frequency was binned as follows: low frequency, <0.01; intermediate frequency, 0.01 to 0.1; and common,
>0.1. The fraction of SNPs also called in the 1000 Genomes Low Coverage Pilot is indicated by blue shading, in each category. (c) Functional
impact among variants shared with HGMD. Functional predictions using SIFT and PolyPhen-2 for the variants shared between the Exon Pilot and
HGMD-DM, as a function of the disease allele frequency bin (<0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, and >0.1). Color represents predicted damage (green, benign;
orange, possibly damaging; red, damaging); open sections represent variants shared between the Exon Pilot and Low Coverage Pilot, while solid
sections represent variants observed only in the Exon Pilot.

file 1) and highly significant differences were still found
after correcting for this error rate variation (P << 10-16
for missense, and P < 10-5 for nonsense SNPs). Third, 99
coding variants in our dataset were also present in
HGMD, and therefore linked with a disease in the literature (although not necessarily causative). We tested these
variants with SIFT and PolyPhen-2, and obtained predictions for 89 (Figure 5c). All 14 variants classified as
damaging were below 1% frequency in our dataset, and
found only in a heterozygous state. This observation
strongly suggests that the majority of variants that are
directly damaging to protein structure and therefore may
result in deleterious phenotypic effects (that is, actual
causative variants, as opposed to merely disease-linked
markers) are likely to occur at low AF in the population.
It is also noteworthy that only a very small fraction
(<20% in each category, marked on all three panels of
Figure 5) of the putatively damaging variants in the Exon
Pilot dataset were detected with an alternative, low coverage whole genome sampling strategy employed in the
Low Coverage Pilot in the 1000 Genome Project [19],
which was designed to find common variants but not
powered to systematically detect low frequency sites (also
see Figure 4b). The higher performance in detecting rare
damaging variants in the Exon Pilot compared to the

Low Coverage Pilot underlines the utility of targeted
exome sequencing for disease studies.
The extent of between-population allele sharing in rare
versus common variants

We next examined the patterns of allele sharing (Materials and methods) among the Exon Pilot populations and
between continents (Figure 6), and observed an expected
reduction in the degree of allele sharing at low frequency.
Comparison to intergenic variants from the HapMap3
ENCODE re-sequencing project [7] revealed that allele
sharing at high and intermediate frequency was similar,
but that at AF <1% it was substantially reduced in the
coding regions, relative to intergenic regions (P < 10-6).
This suggests that the low level of allele sharing of rare
coding variants cannot be explained by allele frequency
alone, and that such variants are likely to be younger
than would be expected from neutral models, presumably
because of negative selection acting at these sites.
Short insertion/deletion variants in the Exon Pilot data

In addition to SNPs, the data also supported the identification of multiple, 1- to 30-bp insertions and deletions
(INDELs; Materials and methods). The BCM and BI
INDEL calling pipelines were applied (Figure 1b), and

minor allele frequency
Figure 6 Allele sharing among populations in the Exon Pilot versus ENCODE intergenic SNPs. The probability that two minor alleles,
sampled at random without replacement among all minor alleles, come from the same population, different populations on the same
continent, or different continents, displayed according to minor allele frequency bin (<0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, and 0.1 to 0.5). For comparison, we also
show the expected level of sharing in a panmictic population, which is independent of AF. The ENCODE and the Exon Pilot data have different
sample sizes for each population panel, which could impact sharing probabilities. We therefore calculated the expected sharing based on
subsets of equal size, corresponding to 90% of the smallest sample size for each population (section 9, ‘Allele sharing among populations’, in
Additional file 1). To reduce possible biases due to reduced sensitivity in rare variants, only high-coverage sites were used, and individuals with
overall low coverage or poor agreement with ENCODE genotypes were discarded. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval based on
bootstrapping at individual variant sites.

identified a total of 21 insertions and 75 deletions in the
1.43 Mb target regions (Tables S6 and S7 in Additional
file 1). Comparisons with dbSNP and the other pilot
projects showed high concordance rates. The overall
experimental INDEL validation rate (Table S8 in Additional file 1) was 81.3%. Secondary visual inspection
revealed that many of the events that did not validate
were cases where multiple INDEL events were incorrectly merged, and the wrong coordinates were submitted for validation. This visual inspection confirmed

all such alleles as true positives, substantially raising the
effective validation rate. Coding INDEL variants change
the amino acid sequence of the gene, and therefore
these variants are very likely to impact protein function.
Indeed, the majority of the events were non-frameshift
variants (Figure S5 in Additional file 1) altering, but not
terminating, the protein sequence. In agreement with
our observations for SNPs, most INDELs were present
at low population allele frequency (Figure S6 in Additional file 1).

Conclusions
In addition to its goal of generating an extensive catalog
of human population variations, the 1000 Genomes Project has served as an intensive technology development
project in terms of both molecular methodologies and
informatics methods for high-throughput data collection
and data analysis. Although it is not a main focus of our
manuscript, development and refinement of the DNA
capture methods for this project have led to the current
whole-exome capture reagents available for the community. The Exon Pilot project also led to the construction
of informatics pipelines for effective analysis of targeted
exon sequencing data, and these pipelines are now routinely used for whole-exome datasets. This study clearly
lays out the informatics steps required to analyze such
datasets and avoid the many pitfalls due to capture
biases, coverage fluctuations, INDELs and alignment
issues, population biases, and sequencing errors.
The extensive collection of SNPs in the 8,000 exons,
detected with accurate and sensitive algorithms, allowed
us to characterize fundamental variation properties in
coding regions, and to compare them to overall genomic
variation. The most important contribution of this study
concerns the functional properties of rare variations, and
their population specificity. We see a substantial depletion of putatively functional variants at intermediate and
high AF, and a corresponding enrichment at low AF,
which is expected as a result of negative selection, and
has been noted recently [20,21]. However, our ability to
study variants at 1% frequency revealed more direct signals, strongly suggesting that variants conferring direct
changes on protein function will be present mostly at low
population frequency. We were also able to note a significant reduction in the level of between-population allele
sharing of rare coding variants, compared to intergenic
variants, an effect that was not visible for variants above
1% in frequency. This effect is likely to reflect a combination of more recent origin and stronger negative selection
for rare alleles in coding, compared to intergenic regions.
Our complete dataset, including a list of SNP and INDEL
variants with well characterized ascertainment properties
is providing a useful substrate for more specialized analyses [22] to interpret functional and population aspects
of low frequency coding variation.

NimbleGen 385 K capture chips were designed to target
the coding regions of the 1,000 genes. Target enrichment was performed following the Short Library Construction Protocol and NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide.
Capture libraries were then sequenced on the 454 FLX/
Titanium platform using standard vendor emPCR,

Single-stranded RNA ‘bait’ was produced using the Agilent
microarray-based method. Genomic DNA was sheared
and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. This ‘pond’ of
DNA was hybridized with an excess of bait in solution.
The sequencing was done using the Illumina GA-II
sequencers to produce either 36-bp fragment reads or
76-bp paired-end reads.
Sanger Institute

A custom Nimblegen 385-K array was used following the
manufacturer’s protocols (Roche/Nimblegen, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA), with the modification that no prehybridization PCR was performed. Captured libraries
were sequenced on the Illumina GA platform as pairedend 37-bp reads.
Washington University in St Louis

Whole genome shotgun libraries for Illumina sequencing
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The pool of synthetic oligos was amplified by PCR
and incorporated biotin-14-dCTP to produce a biotinylated capturing library. Each target library was hybridized
with the biotinylated capturing library, isolated using
streptavidin magnetic beads, and then amplified by PCR.
The captured library fragments were reclaimed by denaturation and sequenced as fragment end reads on the
Illumina GAIIx sequencer.
Derivation of a consensus capture target list

A substantial amount of technological heterogeneity
existed among different centers’ production pipelines.
The Exon Pilot initially selected 1,000 genes as targeted
sequences. However, the capture target designs used in
the four production centers were significantly different.
To account for the heterogeneity introduced by different
capture designs, we defined a set of consensus exon target sequences by intersecting the initial designs (the individual .bed files) with the exonic sequences based on the
CCDS database to create the consensus exon target
sequences (Figure S2 in Additional file 1), which form
the basis of all the analyses described in this study. The
consensus has approximately 1.43 Mb of exonic
sequence, covering 86.1% of the coding regions in the
initial 1,000 genes (the consensus target definition file is
available through the 1000 Genomes Project technical
release ftp directory [23].
Data processing and SNP calling procedures

The SNP calls were a result of intersecting SNP calls from
the BI using the GATK [13] and from BC using the
MOSAIK [24] read mapper and the GigaBayes variant
detection algorithm [25] (a new version of the PolyBayes
SNP discovery program [26]). The BC call set was

Marth et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R84
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/9/R84

generated by calling all 697 individuals together, and perpopulation call sets were generated by a straightforward
projection algorithm: a variant was called in a population
if at least one individual in the population carried a nonreference allele (Figure 1a). The BI calls were made separately within each of the seven populations and a superset
call set was generated as the union of all seven individual
population call sets (Figure 1a). Variants were only called
in the consensus target regions.
Boston College SNP calling pipeline

Read mapping MOSAIK hash size was 15 with minimum mismatches of 4, 6, and 12 for 36-, 51-, and 76-/
101-mer read lengths. MOSAIK parameters for Roche
454 reads were set to 15 with at least 70% of the read
being aligned with a 5% mismatch rate.
Duplicate marking MOSAIK Illumina alignments were
duplicate-marked using the MarkDuplicates program from
the Picard software suite [27]. MOSAIK Roche 454 alignments were duplicate-marked with BCMRemoveDuplicates program (M Bainbridge, personal communication).
Base quality value recalibration MOSAIK Illumina
alignments were re-calibrated using GATK [13] (with
the CountCovariates and TableRecalibration commands). Roche 454 reads aligned with MOSAIK were
not recalibrated.
Bayesian SNP calling GigaBayes was used at BC for SNP
calls. Briefly, it calculates genotype likelihoods, excluding
reads with a mapping quality of <20 and nucleotides with
a base quality <20. It then calculates genotypes using the
previously calculated genotype likelihoods and a prior on
variant frequency. Summing the probabilities of sample
genotypes with at least one non-reference allele generates
the posterior probability.
SNP filtering Variant calls were filtered out if they did
not meet the criteria of a PHRED scaled quality score of at
least 40 with at least one individual with a non-reference
genotype with a genotype quality score of at least 10.
Broad Institute SNP calling pipeline

The Broad Institute employed a five-step protocol consisting of alignment, PCR duplicate marking, base quality score recalibration, application of the SNP calling
algorithm, and filtration of the results.
Alignment with MAQ/SSAHA2 Reads were aligned by
the Sanger Institute using MAQ and SSAHA2 for Illumina and Roche 454 data, respectively. All aligned reads
and metadata (sequencing center, sequencing technology,
run identifier, lane identifier, library identifier, and so on)
were written in BAM format.
Duplicate marking We applied the Picard [27] MarkDuplicates algorithm. This algorithm locates reads from the
same sequencing library with precisely the same starting
position on the genome. When more than one read is
found to have the same start position, all but one are

Page 12 of 17

flagged as duplicates in the BAM file and therefore
ignored in downstream processing.
Base quality score recalibration To correct for inaccuracies in the base quality scores, we developed and
applied a base quality score recalibrator. Comparison of
the estimated quality scores to the empirical quality
scores allowed us to compute corrected quality scores,
which were recorded in the BAM files.
SNP calling We developed a multi-sample Bayesian SNP
calling algorithm, now part of the GATK package [13].
This algorithm considers reads from the provided samples
simultaneously, attempting to ascertain the likelihood of a
site harboring an alternative allele with a frequency of at
least 1/N, where N is the number of samples provided.
Once the presence of a variant is established, the likelihood for each sample’s genotype is determined by a greedy
combinatorial search algorithm (approximately behaving
like Expectation-Maximization).
SNP calls were generated per population. The specific
parameters used were: minimum base quality, 10; minimum mapping quality, 10; minimum confidence threshold, 50.
SNP filtering The SNP calling stage provided a list of any
site in the target region that may plausibly be variant.
These sites were then filtered to identify a set of true variants, discarding the ones deemed to be false-positives. To
this end, we developed several heuristic filters by comparing the behavior of different covariates for known variants
versus novel variants. Putative variants failing the following filters were ignored in downstream analysis: QD (discovery confidence of the variant/depth of coverage) ≥5;
HRun (length of adjacent, allele-sharing homopolymer
run) >3; AB (allele balance of variant, averaged over all
heterozygous samples, polarized for the reference allele)
≥75%; SnpCluster (N or more variants found within M
bases of each other) 3, 10.
Intersecting the Boston College and Broad Institute call sets

Next, we intersected the BC and BI SNP call sets within
the target consensus regions (Figure 1a). This intersecting operation greatly improved the SNP call accuracy
(Table 2), and the calls within the intersection were used
in our official Exon Pilot release in March 2010. Table 2
presents the SNP calls of the seven population-specific
call sets (that is, CEU, TSI, CHB, CHD, JPT, LWK, and
YRI) that were generated by BC and BI pipelines independently. Across each of the seven populations, the
intersection calls (BC ∩ BI) range from 50 to 79% of the
total SNP calls made by BC and BI; more than 50% of the
calls were in dbSNP (build 129), and show a high transition/transversion ratio (Ts/Tv) above 3.00. The large
fraction of overlapping SNPs, with a high fraction of
dbSNP entries and high Ts/Tv ratio, indicated high quality in the intersection call sets. These call sets were thus

Marth et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R84
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/9/R84

highly confident due to being generated from two independent pipelines with quite different and complementary algorithms. Several iterations of comparisons and
tuning of the pipelines led to convergence of these call
sets. In addition, the intersection call sets have yielded
high validation rates (Table 3; Table S2 in Additional
file 1).
The BC unique SNP call set (BC\BI) or BI unique SNP
call set (BI\BC) accounted for the remaining 30 to 50% of
the SNPs. About 20% of BC unique calls and 8% of BI
unique calls were present in dbSNP build 129. Both unique
call sets had a much lower Ts/Tv of 1.00, indicating relatively lower quality in the unique call sets (Table 2).
SNP call set validations

We designed five series of validation experiments in order
to examine the false positive and false negative rate, both
globally in the officially released call sets, and in the SNP
calls specific to the BC or BI call set, as well as in the rare
and singleton SNPs and almost all the SNPs altering
codons (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The validation
experiments were carried out at the BCM Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) and BI, using PCRSanger sequencing and Sequenom genotyping,
respectively.
Series 1 - random sampling

We randomly chose 105 non-dbSNP sites in the intersection (that is, regardless of the frequency spectrum), and
tested them by Sequenom at BI across the entire sample
set.
Series 2 - population-specific discovery

Approximately 135 non-dbSNP sites were chosen regardless of the frequency spectrum from each of CEU, YRI +
LWK, and CHB + CHD + JPT populations. They were
selected to represent both the BC/BI intersection, BC-specific and BI-specific call sets. The sites were genotyped using
Sequenom at BI across the samples in the populations
where they were discovered.
Series 3 - low frequency sites and false positives

We tested 510 sites at low frequency (1 to 5 alleles/occurrences; approximately 300 in the intersection and approximately 200 in the BC-specific/BI-specific sets) using PCR
and Sanger sequencing at the BCM-HGSC, in the particular samples where they were discovered. We allocated
approximately 50% of the sites to singletons, and approximately 50% to sites with alternative allele count 2 to 5.
Series 4 - low frequency sites and false negatives

We chose 33 sites with alternative allele count 2 to 5 and
35 singletons from the intersection call set, and tested
across all samples using Sequenom at BI.
Series 5 - comparative categories

We drew 227 sites at low frequency (singletons and
SNPs with an alternative allele count of 2 to 5) from different functional annotation classes (such as missense,

Page 13 of 17

silent, promoter regions, and so on), and examined
them using PCR-Sanger sequencing at the BCM-HGSC.
SNP validation rate and genotype accuracy estimation

The overall validation rate in the official released data set
(that is, the intersection) was very high at 96.8% (Table 3;
Tables S3 and S4 in Additional file 1), meeting and
exceeding the 1000 Genomes Project goal of >95% validation. The validation rates at the low-frequency categories
were also high, greater than 93.0% for singletons and SNPs
with alternative allele count 2 to 5 (series 3, 4 and 5 in
Table S2 in Additional file 1). The exceedingly high validation percentages indicated that 1) the high coverage targeted resequencing methods were effective in accurately
detecting SNPs at both common and rare allele frequencies; and 2) the intersection calls were highly accurate, and
the vast majority of correctly called low frequency alleles
were indeed at low frequency. Most of the non-validated
sites (Table S2 in Additional file 1) were in the unique
fractions of the BC and BI call sets.
The genotype call accuracies were calculated by comparing the called genotypes to the genotype measurements in
the validation assays for all four series (series 1 to 4; Table
S5 in Additional file 1). In total, 33,938 called genotypes
were compared, and the vast majority of the genotypes
agreed with the validation results: 32,532, 1,320 and 12 for
Ref/Ref (Homozygote Reference), Ref/Alt (heterozygote)
and Alt/Alt (Homozygote NonReference) classes, respectively. The accuracy rate for all called genotypes was as
high as 99.8%, with 99.9% accuracy for Homozygote Reference (HomRef), 97.0% for heterozygote (Het), and 92.3%
for Homozygote NonReference (HomNonRef). The overall
false discovery rate of variant genotypes was <3% and the
missed variant genotype rate was <1% as measured in series 1. The variant genotypes in low-frequency categories in
series 3 were confirmed for 133 of 133 (100%) singleton
sites, and 395 of 419 (94.3%) SNPs with alternative allele
count 2 to 5. The accuracy compared to series 4 validated
sites showed the false discovery rate for these categories
was approximately 6.0% with a missed variant genotype
rate of 0.1%.
Nucleotide diversity estimation

Per-base heterozygosity estimates for the Exon Pilot were
calculated at missense, two-fold, three-fold, and four-fold
degenerate sites, and all base pairs in the autosomal targeted regions. We included only targeted base pairs with
≥10× coverage in at least 100 chromosomes based on the
MOSAIK alignments. The same analysis was performed
on the Low Coverage Pilot, but excluding base pairs that
were masked in the Low Coverage callability files [28].
Base pairs were masked if >20% of Illumina reads had a
mapping quality of 0 and/or read depth was greater than
twice the average depth at HapMap3 sites. Also, a base

Marth et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R84
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/9/R84

pair had to be callable in all three Low Coverage populations in order to be included in our analysis. Per-base
estimates of heterozygosity of ENCODE regions in HapMap3 were normalized by the nominal sequence length
of 1 Mbp.
Degeneracy was calculated based on the hg18 reference sequence and the Gencode gene model annotations
[23]. Note that some base pair positions may have been
counted in multiple categories due to differing reading
frames in alternative splice variants at a locus, but this
number was less than 1% in each category and should
have negligible effects on the resulting analyses.

three classes: (1) Benign: ‘benign’ from PolyPhen-2 + ‘tolerated’ from SIFT, or one of these plus no prediction
from the other program; (2) Possibly damaging: ‘possibly
damaging’ from PolyPhen-2 plus ‘damaging (low confidence)’ from SIFT, or a conflict between the predictions;
(3) Damaging: ‘probably damaging’ from PolyPhen-2 plus
‘damaging’ from SIFT, or one of these plus no prediction
from the other program. AFs were determined in each
population from the number of disease and non-disease
allele calls, excluding individuals with missing data.
These AFs were averaged across all populations.
Analysis of allele sharing within and across populations

Spectrum analysis

In the Exon Pilot SNP data set, not all variant sites had
the same number of genotypes in each of the seven populations studied. In order to make comparisons of spectra
from different populations easier, the unfolded AF spectrum (using orthologous bases from the panTro2 assembly as the ancestral alleles) for each population was
projected to a common sample size of 100 chromosomes
using the software Dadi [29]. The projection is based off
the hyper-geometric distribution, without correcting for
ancestral misidentifications.
Analysis of predicted impact on gene function
Functional prediction

SIFT and PolyPhen-2 were used to predict possible
impacts of missense SNPs on the function of human proteins. Both programs utilize sequence and/or structure
information in prediction. SIFT uses sequence homology
to build a position-specified scoring matrix with Dirichlet
priors, whereas PolyPhen-2 uses both phylogenetic and
structural features combined with machine learning. In
total, 3,708 and 5,990 missense SNPs in the Exon Pilot
were evaluated by either SIFT or PolyPhen-2. We evaluated 3,176 missense SNPs by both SIFT and PolyPhen-2,
which had a concordance rate in functional prediction of
55%.
Functional analyses of Exon Pilot variants found in the
HGMD

The overlaps of the Exon Pilot SNP and INDEL sets with
the HGMD Professional 2009.4 version missense/nonsense SNPs, small insertions, small deletions and small
INDELs were identified based on their locations in the
reference genome sequence (build 36). There were no
overlapping insertions, deletions or INDELs; however, 99
overlapping SNPs within the HGMD-DM class were
found, and these were used in subsequent analyses. Four
led to premature stop codons and the remaining 95 to
missense amino acid changes; the consequences of these
for protein structure were predicted using SIFT and PolyPhen-2. The predicted consequences were combined into

Allele sharing was measured as a function of alternative
allele frequency using the following steps. Singletons,
which cannot be shared, were removed from the catalog
of 12,758 Exon Pilot exonic variants. The remaining
7,137 variants were further filtered using stringent coverage requirements (section 9, ‘Allele sharing among populations’, in Additional file 1) to ensure that coverage
fluctuations between populations would not impact sampling. As a measure of sharing, we considered the likelihood that two minor alleles, when sampled at random
without replacement among all minor alleles, belonged
to the same population, to different populations from the
same continent, or to different continents. In a panmictic
population, every pair of sampled chromosomes is
equally likely to be sampled, and the expected sharing
depends only on the number of pairs of chromosomes in
each sharing category - a combinatorial property of sample sizes, but independent of allele frequency.
We compared the Exon Pilot data with published data
obtained by resequencing ten 100-kb ENCODE regions as
part of the International HapMap 3 Consortium study.
We extracted 3,618 HapMap SNPs based on a noncoding
annotation. Since the HapMap and Exon Pilot data differ
in their sample sizes, we calculated the expected amount
of sharing for each dataset based on subsampling each
population panel to 90% of the minimum population size
between the two datasets, namely CEU:134, CHB:162,
CHD:54, JPT:152, LWK:108, TSI:98, YRI:170. The probability of sharing was averaged over all sites, weighted by
the probability that a site had two minor alleles in the
down-sampled set. Confidence intervals were obtained by
bootstrap over the different variant sites.
INDEL detection and analysis

INDELs were called on the Exon Pilot data from both the
Illumina and the Roche 454 platforms, and the results
were merged to create the final call set (Figure 1b). Only
INDELs inside the consensus target regions were
included in the official release. The Illumina data were
processed with two independent pipelines in a parallel

Marth et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R84
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/9/R84

fashion, by BCM-HGSC and BI (Figure 1b; Table S7 in
Additional file 1). The Roche 454 INDELs were processed by BCM-HGSC. The results were combined by
taking the union of the three call sets (Figure 1b; Table
S7 in Additional file 1).
BCM-HGSC Illumina INDEL calling pipeline

Read mapping The BCM-HGSC Illumina INDEL calling
pipeline used the MOSAIK alignments created at BC as
explained in the SNP calling methods.
Duplicate filtering Duplicate reads were marked in the
alignment using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool [27] as
explained in the SNP calling methods.
Base quality recalibration The base qualities reported
by the instrument were recalibrated using GATK as
explained in the SNP calling methods.
INDEL calling INDELs were called using Atlas-Indel2
(Challis et al., submitted), which uses logistic regression
models trained on validated exon capture data to identify
true INDELs and remove false INDELs arising from
sequencing or mapping errors.
INDEL filtering INDEL calls were further filtered to
require at least two variant reads in a sample. We additionally filtered out all singleton INDELs with a length
of 1, in order to remove the high number of false positive INDELs in this category.
Broad Institute Illumina INDEL calling pipeline

Read mapping The BI Illumina INDEL calling pipeline
used the MAQ alignments created at Sanger as explained
in the SNP calling methods.
Duplicate filtering Duplicate reads were marked in the
alignment using the Picard MarkDuplicates [27] as
explained in the SNP calling methods.
Base quality recalibration The base qualities reported
by the instrument were recalibrated using GATK as
explained in the SNP calling methods.
Multiple sequence alignment near putative INDELs
Reads in the alignment were realigned by GATK IndelRealigner around putative INDELs.
INDEL calling INDELs were called using
IndelGenotyperV2.
INDEL filtering INDEL calls were further filtered based
on local mismatch rate, nearby homopolymer runs,
strand bias and other similar features.
BCM-HGSC Roche 454 INDEL calling pipeline (Figure 1b)

Read mapping The Roche 454 INDEL data were
aligned using BLAT-CrossMatch at the BCM-HGSC.
Duplicate filtering Duplicate reads were removed from
the alignment using the BCMRemoveDuplicates script.
INDEL calling INDELs were called using the AtlasIndel program at the BCM-HGSC.
INDEL filtering Initial calls were further filtered by
removing lower quality reads, singleton INDELs, 2-bp
low frequency INDELs, and any INDELs that may have
arisen due to flow-space errors.

Merging INDEL call sets (Figure 1b)

The intersection of the BCM-HGSC and BI Illumina
INDEL call sets was taken as the consensus for the Illumina data. The union of the Illumina consensus set and
the Roche 454 call set formed the final call set. When
merging call sets any INDELs of the same type (insertion
or deletion) within 5 bp of each other were considered
equivalent and merged together.
In total, we detected 96 INDELs (21 insertions and 75
deletions) from the 697 individuals (Table S7 in Additional file 1). The call set had a dbSNP (build 129) concordance rate of 26%. On the Illumina platform, 9
insertions and 39 deletions were called by BCM-HGSC
and 11 insertions and 37 deletions by BI. A total of 10
insertions and 24 deletions were called on the Roche 454
data. The Roche 454 INDEL set appeared to be enriched
with 2-bp INDELs. This is likely due to flowspace errors
on the sequencing platform, which may make 1- or 3-bp
INDELs appear to be 2 bp long.
When combining call sets from BCM-HGSC and BI,
and calculating concordance, INDELs within 5 bp of
each other and of the same type (insertion or deletion)
were considered equivalent. The INDEL call set for each
population was combined by continent for the alternative
allele count analysis, and all seven sets were combined
into one set for the INDEL size analysis (Figures S5 and
S6 in Additional file 1). When INDELs were found to be
equivalent, they were combined to remove the duplication. When combined to the continental level, 51
INDELs were found in Africa, 46 in Asia, and 30 in Europe (Figure 1b; Table S7 in Additional file 1).
INDEL validation

The Illumina union INDEL calls were assessed by two
methods (Table S8a in Additional file 1). First, the 31
INDELs called by both centers were validated via Sequenom assays for the haplotypes resulting from the INDEL
event. The assays were designed using the GATK, and
dbSNP sites were masked to avoid bias due to nearby
SNPs. The 13 INDELs exclusive to the JPT population
and exclusive to a single center were validated via Sequenom assays following the same protocol. Second, the
remaining INDEL sites unique to either center were validated by targeted resequencing using PCR and the Roche
454 platform.
Sequenom probe design resulted in probes for 31 sites
in the overlapping call set, of which five failed quality
control checks. The remaining 26 sites all validated as
variants, though genotype concordance between sequencing calls and validation was very low (Table S8b in
Additional file 1). Of the 13 probes designed to assess
the unique coding INDEL calls in the JPT population,
10 passed quality control filters, and 6 validated as true
variants.

Marth et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R84
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/9/R84

Unique INDELs from the Illumina BCM and BI call sets
underwent PCR-Roche 454 validation at BCM-HGSC
(Table S8a in Additional file 1). Some additional low-confidence INDELs that were filtered out of the BCM call set
were also included for software tuning purposes. Equivalent INDELs within any of these sets were merged. A total
of 114 on-target sample-sites were submitted for validation; 94 INDELs had conclusive results. The BI unique call
set had a confirmation rate of 78.6% and the BCM-HGSC
call set had a confirmation rate of 80.0% (Table S8c in
Additional file 1). In addition to these INDELs, 405 off-target non-coding sample sites underwent validation. Of
these, 227 gave conclusive results, BI INDELs had a confirmation rate of 88.6% and BCM-HGSC had a confirmation
rate of 59.6%. BCM’s low confirmation rate was due to the
exon-specific nature of the Atlas-Indel2 pipeline.
