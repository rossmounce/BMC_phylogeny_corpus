Abstract
Background: Flexible genomes facilitate bacterial evolution and are classically organized into polymorphic strainspecific segments called regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs). Using a new web tool, RGPFinder, we investigated
plasticity units in bacterial genomes, by exhaustive description of the RGPs in two Photorhabdus and two
Xenorhabdus strains, belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae and interacting with invertebrates (insects and
nematodes).
Results: RGPs account for about 60% of the genome in each of the four genomes studied. We classified RGPs into
genomic islands (GIs), prophages and two new classes of RGP without the features of classical mobile genetic
elements (MGEs) but harboring genes encoding enzymes catalyzing DNA recombination (RGPmob), or with no
remarkable feature (RGPnone). These new classes accounted for most of the RGPs and are probably hypervariable
regions, ancient MGEs with degraded mobilization machinery or non canonical MGEs for which the mobility
mechanism has yet to be described. We provide evidence that not only the GIs and the prophages, but also
RGPmob and RGPnone, have a mosaic structure consisting of modules. A module is a block of genes, 0.5 to 60 kb in
length, displaying a conserved genomic organization among the different Enterobacteriaceae. Modules are
functional units involved in host/environment interactions (22-31%), metabolism (22-27%), intracellular or
intercellular DNA mobility (13-30%), drug resistance (4-5%) and antibiotic synthesis (3-6%). Finally, in silico
comparisons and PCR multiplex analysis indicated that these modules served as plasticity units within the bacterial
genome during genome speciation and as deletion units in clonal variants of Photorhabdus.
Conclusions: This led us to consider the modules, rather than the entire RGP, as the true unit of plasticity in
bacterial genomes, during both short-term and long-term genome evolution.

Background
The portion of the bacterial genome common to all
strains in a defined set of species and required for basic
cellular functions is known as the core genome. The
genes variably present between individual strains constitute the flexible genome [1-3]. The estimate of the core
and the flexible genomes not only depend on the phylogenetic depth of the group considered, the number of

genomes available for comparison but also on the methodology used [3]. Some genes of the flexible genome
may play a role in adaptation to special growth conditions, such as those involved in the colonization of new
ecological niches, symbiosis, host-cell interaction, and
pathogenicity [1,2]. The plasticity of the flexible genome
contributes to bacterial genome evolution [2-4].
The flexible genome is organized principally into polymorphic strain-specific DNA segments that are missing
in at least one of the genomes analyzed. These segments
are named regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs) without
any assumption about the evolutionary origin or genetic

basis of these variable chromosomal segments [5]. This
terminology covers two classes: hypervariable segments
that are likely to be the result of deletions of particular
DNA regions in one or more strains, and the mobile
genetic elements (MGEs).
The plasticity of MGEs depends on three kinds of
molecular events, the duplications, inversions and deletions, mediated by transposases and site-specific recombinases whose genes are located either on core genome
or on the RGPs themselves [4,6]. The MGEs may be
excised from one location and reintegrated elsewhere in
the genome or may undergo replicative transposition
before integration of a new copy of the element elsewhere in the genome (intracellular mobility). Finally,
some MGEs may undergo horizontal genetic transfer
(HGT) by natural transformation, transduction or well
developed and efficient conjugation mechanisms (intercellular mobility) [4].
The MGE class covers some well characterized elements. Plasmids are stable self-replicating MGEs [4].
Some of them may be transferred in other prokaryotic
cells by conjugation. Prophages, the integrated form of
temperate bacteriophages, are MGEs that undergo intercellular DNA mobility via transduction [4]. Non replicative MGEs are integrated into the host chromosome and
encode at least one enzyme involved in their own excision and integration; these MGEs constitute a large,
diverse family [7,8]. They are referred to as (i) transposable elements, if they do not undergo HGT, (ii) genomic islands (GI) if they present features of HGT (phage
and/or plasmid-derived sequences, transfer genes, integrases, insertion sequences (IS), G+C content and codon
usage bias) but do not encode genes involved in transfer, (iii) integrative mobilizable elements when they
require “helper” elements for mobilization and (iv) integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) when they encode
their own complete mobility machinery, generally a type
4 secretion system (T4SS) [8]. However, it is often difficult to apply this nomenclature, because MGEs are generally described on the basis of in silico analysis in
large-scale prokaryotic genome sequencing programs.
Thus, the effective excision, intracellular or intercellular
mobility and subsequent reintegration via site-specific
recombination of MGEs have been demonstrated in
only a few cases [9-14]. For these reasons, in the course
of genomic projects, in the absence of experimental
data, the term “GI” is generally used for putative mobilizable MGEs without the organization typical of prophages [1,2,4,15].
MGEs are potent agents of bacterial genome evolution
[4,16]. This property results from both the plasticity of
MGE and intra-MGE recombination. Indeed, some
MGEs are organized into an array of MGE sub-segments, known as modules [7,17,18]. This mosaic

Page 2 of 21

organization is the product of the combination of a limited number of constitutive modules [17]: intracellular
mobility modules (recombination and replication functions), intercellular mobility modules (transformation,
phage propagation and conjugative transfer) and stability
modules. The stability modules are responsible for the
maintenance of the MGE in the host cell and encode
functions such as poison/antidote systems [19] and antibiotic resistance functions [20,21]. Recombination
between MGEs has been studied in a few cases. Deletions and tandem accretions of modules generate hybrid
MGEs [22-24]. The bacterial recA gene or the recombination systems of the MGEs themselves may mediate
the generation of hybrid MGEs [25].
We investigated the plasticity of the flexible genome,
by addressing three questions: what are the respective
roles of MGEs and hypervariable segments within the
flexible genome? Are all RGPs, like MGEs, composed of
modules? Do all modules undergo accretion? We
addressed these questions by studying the flexible genomes of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus. Photorhabdus
and Xenorhabdus are closely related Enterobacteriaceae
[26], both of which are appropriate for genomic evolution studies because of their particular lifestyle [27,28].
Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus live in monoxenic cultures within the gut of the soil nematodes, Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively. These nematodes
infect insect larvae, releasing the bacteria into the hemolymph of the insect. The nematode and the bacteria kill
the insect and convert the cadaver into a source of food
for nematode growth and development. After several
rounds of reproduction, the bacteria recolonize the
nematodes, which then emerge from the insect cadaver
into the soil, to search for a new host [29-31]. This lifestyle, including obligatory, cyclic pathogenic and mutualistic interactions with invertebrate hosts, restricts the
ecological niches colonized by Photorhabus and Xenorhabdus. This biological constraint may favor clonality
among bacteria and intrachromosomal rearrangements
within the genome. Moreover, Photorhabdus asymbiotica has been recovered in clinical isolates from human
wounds, in both North America and Australia [32,33].
The emergence of pathogenicity in humans is also consistent with a potential for genomic exchange with
environmental bacteria.
Genomic plasticity has been studied to different
extents in the two genera. Whole-genome analysis has
just begun for Xenorhabdus [34], whereas full genome
sequences have been published for two Photorhabdus
strains, revealing the presence of a large number of
phage remnants, IS, transposases, repeat elements and
overrepresented families of paralogs, consistent with a
high level of potential plasticity in these genomes
[35,36]. These features are indicative of a general

Ogier et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:568
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/568

process of genome evolution, as repeatedly observed in
host-restricted lineages from many phylogenetic groups
[37]. One study described genomic deletion and amplification events in Photorhabdus clonal variants obtained
in laboratory conditions [38]. These genomic changes
are cryptic, but are always found within the Enterobacteriaceae flexible genome. Finally, some studies have
characterized a few Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus
RGPs by in silico analysis [35,36,39-43] or by microarray
hybridization [38,44].
In this study, we carried out an exhaustive description
of RGPs in the genomes of three entomopathogenic
strains isolated from nematodes: Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC19061 [34], Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004
[34] and Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 [35], and a
strain isolated from humans: Photorhabdus asymbiotica
ATCC43949 [36]. For the identification of hypervariable
regions, recent MGEs, ancient MGEs and non canonical
MGEs with unknown mobility mechanisms, we used a
new Web tool, RGPFinder, which identifies both synteny
ruptures in the core genome and classical intrinsic and
extrinsic MGE features (Roche, D., unpublished data).
We then described the fine modular structure of RGPs
and showed that (i) each module is a functional unit, (ii)
modules have diverse functions, (iii) modules shape the
flexible genomes of the various strains studied and, (iv)
some modules are deletion units. Overall, our data
strongly suggest that modules are the functional integrated systems serving as the real unit of plasticity
within RGPs.

Results and Discussion
Identification of regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs)

The size of the flexible genome depends on the methodology used, the depth of phylogenetic comparison and
the number of genomes compared [3]. Methods based
on genomic comparison, detection of composition bias
and search of mobility genes are the most performing
tools for the flexible genome characterization [45].
Some methods such as IslandViewer and MobileHomeFinder are dedicated to predict genomic islands (GIs)
with high stringency. Our goal is the identification of
the regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs), which covers
not only GIs but also rearrangement events without any
assumption about the evolutionary origin or genetic
basis of these variable chromosomal segments. For this
reason, we developed a new Web tool, RGPFinder,
which combines comparison and composition based
approaches (Roche et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, RGPFinder is specifically designed to identify
regions absent from at least one genome inside the
comparison genome set. We applied this tool on the
genomes of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 (Pl), Photorhabdus asymbiotica ATCC43949 (Pa), Xenorhabdus

Page 3 of 21

nematophila ATCC19061 (Xn) and Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004 (Xb) strains. We compared the results of
IslandViewer and RGPFinder on our four genomes (data
not shown). RGPFinder carries out a larger description
of the flexible genome (more and larger predicted
regions) than IslandViewer.
We applied the RGPFinder method to different bacterial genome sets (Figure 1.A and Table 1). The first set
included strains from the same genus ("Genus” set: Xn
versus Xb and Pl versus Pa). The second set included
the four Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus strains ("Photo
+ Xeno” set). The third set, the “Entero” set, included
Photorhabdus and Xenorhabus strains together with
other closely related strains from the Enterobacteriaceae
(Additional file 1), including the mammalian pathogen
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Typhi CT18, the
mammalian pathogen Yersinia pestis CO92, which also
interacts with insects, the plant pathogen, Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043, and a commensal
strain, Escherichia coli K12. The proportion of the genome accounted for by RGPs increased with the size of
the bacterial genome set: 26-36%, 46-58% and 60-69%
for the Genus, Photo + Xeno and Entero sets (Table 1).
However, the number of RGPs was similar in the different bacterial genome sets. The nucleus of each RGP was
conserved, but was larger when the “Entero” set was
used. The characterization of flexible genomes through
the comparison of closely related strains can be used to
identify RGPs that have recently been acquired or modified, but this technique may result in RGPs generated by
more ancient HGT or rearrangements being incorrectly
considered part of the core genome[5]. As our objective
was the exhaustive characterization of flexible genome
plasticity and identification of as many HGT and rearrangement events as possible, we chose to work on the
largest comparison set, the Entero set.
After manual inspection of the predicted RGPs (see
Methods), we obtained a list of 96, 92, 83 and 71 RGPs
sensu lato for Pl, Pa, Xn and Xb, respectively (Table 1
and see RGPs listed in Additional File 2; these lists are
the references used throughout this work.). The RGPs
were between 5 kb and 316 kb in length, and more than
50% were less than 20 kb long (Additional File 3). No
integral RGP was found to be conserved in all four genomes. The flexible genome of the Photorhabdus and
Xenorhabdus genera accounted for 52.6 to 61.5% of the
entire genome (Table 1). In other studies in conditions
similar to those used here, the flexible genome has been
found to cover: i) 1 to 10% of the genome when serovar
or clinical isolates are compared [5,46]; ii) 10 to 40% of
the genome when strains are compared [47,48], iii) 25
to 60% of the genome when species are compared
[49-51] and iv) 50 to 69% of the genome when genera
are compared [52]. Thus, the sizes of the flexible

genomes of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus within
Enterobacteriaceae were consistent with the findings of
other studies.
The flexible genome was found to be larger in Photorhabdus than in Xenorhabdus genus. This finding is
consistent with previous genomic analyses highlighting
the importance of genome plasticity in Photorhabdus
genomes, at both the species [36,40,44] and clonal [38]
levels.
Classification of RGPs

We classified the RGPs into different classes according
to their genetic features (Figure 1.B and Table 2). First,
we used the Prophinder tool [53] to identify prophages
(P) (Table 2): Pl, Pa, Xn and Xb have five, eight, six and
seven predicted prophages, respectively. P0_PL, P78_PL,
P0_PA, P30_PA, P67_XB and P22bis_XN are P2-related
phages. This is consistent with previous studies in the
Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genera in which P2phage tail structures were identified [54-58].
RGPs showing at least one of the typical features of
MGEs acquired by HGT (insertion near a tRNA gene,
an integrase-coding gene or a G+C content different
from that of the core genome) and that are not prophages were named GIs. No ICE class was created since

no T4SS loci was identified in the four studied genomes.
GI85_PL and GI25_PA, in the Pl and Pa genomes,
respectively, were found to harbor type three secretion
system (T3SS) loci similar to those of Yersinia pestis
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [35,36,40,59]. Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria encode T3SSs of the Ysc
type [60]. In Pl, this T3SS is involved in bacterial adaptation to the insect host, as it prevents the uptake of
bacteria by the immunity organs of Locusta migratoria
[61]. As previously described [30,59], no such loci are
found in Xenorhabdus genomes. The GI27_PL of Pl is
another cluster potentially involved in interactions
between bacteria and host, as it harbors a homolog of
the Yersinia adhesion pathogenicity island (YAPI) [43].
The YAPI encodes a type IV pilus, which contributes to
pathogenicity in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype
O:1, but also includes genes encoding proteins involved
in general metabolism, a gene cluster for a restrictionmodification system and a large number of mobile
genetic elements [62]. This YAPI cluster was detected
only on the Pl chromosome. Finally, GI63_XN from Xn
is a gene cluster potentially involved in nematode interaction. It harbors the nil locus, enabling X. nematophila
strains to colonize their nematode host, S. carpocapsae,
specifically [42]. It also encodes putative peptide

synthetases, which may be involved in antibiotic production, thereby facilitating the eviction of competing bacteria during the association of nematodes and bacteria
before the nematodes leave the insect cadaver. The
GI63_XN is specific to Xn.
The other predicted regions were named RGPs sensu
stricto. Several of these RGPs contained ISs and genes
encoding enzymes catalyzing DNA recombination, such
as resolvase, invertase and excisionase. We named these
RGPs RGPmob. RGPs with no remarkable features were
named RGPnone. This last group of RGPs probably consists of hypervariable regions with intracellular mobility
mediated by chromosomal rearrangements, such as deletion, duplication or inversion. RGPmob and RGPnone may
also be ancient mobilizable MGEs with degraded mobility machinery. The membership to multiple RGP classes
of Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVCs) and the
toxin complex (Tc) loci is consistent with this hypothesis. PVCs are phage-like elements flanked by variable
putative or identified toxin genes [63-65]). They are
found in Photorhabdus genomes, but not in Xenorhabdus genomes. Yang and coworkers speculated that PVCs
might encode phage-like structures, acting as syringes to
deliver toxins to the interior of eukaryotic cells [64]. Six
of the eight previously described PVC families [36],
belong to the prophage and GI classes (PVCcif:
GI52_PA, GI60_PL, PVClopT of Pl: GI56_PL, PVCpnf
of Pa: GI81_PA, PVClmt of Pa: GI57_PA, PVCphx of Pl
and its tandem repeat: P41_PL). The remaining three
families were classified as RGPmob, despite their putative
ancestral origin from phages (PVClopT of Pa:
RGP54_PA, PVCphx of PA: RGP66_PA). The Tc loci of
Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus encoded families of
insecticidal toxins active by ingestion [35,36,39,41].
These loci are conserved in several other entomopathogenic bacteria (Serratia entomophila, Pseudomonas entomophila) and bacteria associated with insects (Yersinia
spp., Pseudomonas syringae) [43,63,66,67], strongly suggesting that HGT of Tc loci has occurred between soil
bacteria from different genera known to interact with
insects. Some Tc loci are embedded in GIs (GI94_PL,
GI27_PL, GI22_PL, GI23_PA, GI91_PA, GI50_XN,
GI56_XN, GI23_XB), whereas others are found in
RGP none (RGP14_PL, RGP58_PL, RGP47_XN,
RGP14_XB, RGP30_XB). In these two examples, the
genomic erosion of HGT features may lead to a loss of
information in some RGPs. This process has classically
been reported for nucleotide usage: with increasing time
since the HGT event, codon usage in the inserted DNA
is gradually modified to match the background of the
recipient genome [68]. RGPmob and RGPnone may also
be MGE that can be mobilizable in trans by other
MGEs or non canonical MGEs with mobility mechanisms that have yet to be described. Our classification

Page 6 of 21

thus opens up promising new lines of research that may
lead to the identification of new classes of MGE.
From the viewpoint of whole-genome evolution, our
classification highlights the unusual position of the Pa
genome. The proportions of RGPmob and RGPnone are
fairly similar in the Pl, Xb and Xn genomes, whereas the
Pa genome contains a much higher proportion of
RGPnone (Table 2). This difference probably results from
differences in genome evolution and/or plasticity
between Pa, which was recovered from a human patient
in North America [32], and the other three strains,
which were isolated from nematodes. The evolutionary
implications of the higher proportion of RGPnone in Pa
remain unclear, but a systematic functional analysis of
RGP none specific to Pa would complement virulence
mapping techniques [29], thereby contributing to the
identification of new MGEs involved in the emergence
of human pathogens.
RGPs in the core genome architecture

We mapped the different classes of RGPs on schematic
circular maps, to visualize their chromosomal distribution (Additional File 4). GIs, prophages and RGPs sensu
stricto were found to be evenly distributed throughout
the four genomes. Replication, by its inherent asymmetry, shapes the global structure of the prokaryotic chromosome, and some regions of the chromosome are
much less accessible for internal recombination than
others [15]. However, GI, prophages and RGPs sensu
stricto were equally likely to be located in the region of
the origin of replication, the replication termination
region or other regions. This permissiveness probably
results from compensatory lateral transfers and/or
recombination events, preventing dramatic effects on
gene order or the large-scale organization of the genome
[15].
We searched for RGP location sites by identifying the
genes flanking them on the right and left (Additional
File 2). We then looked for RGP location sites conserved
within the core genome. We identified 108 hotspots
conserved in at least three of the studied genomes,
including 14 sites located close to a tRNA gene (tRNAsite) and 94 sites located close to a protein-encoding
gene (coding sequence or CDS-site). By definition,
tRNA attachment sites are associated with GIs and prophages, whereas coding sequence sites may be associated
with all classes of RGPs (Table 3). Therefore, CDS-sites
are potential recombination hot spots for hypervariable
regions or integration hot spots for MGE or ancient
mobilizable MGE. CDS-sites have been little described.
However, a recent comparative genomic study in Escherichiacoli showed that most gene acquisitions and losses
(83%) are adjacent to CDS-sites rather than tRNA-sites

sequences (e.g. repeat sequences) or secondary structures close to the CDS-sites may be targeted as integration hot spots. Alternatively, the function of the
neighboring gene may be required for intracellular
mobility. Indeed, in our study, the genes encoded at
CDS-sites were frequently found to be involved in DNA
and RNA metabolism or often encoding transferases
(Table 3). They may therefore act as cofactors in the
excision/integration process.
Very different RGPs were found to be located in the
same integration hot spot, in the different Photorhabdus
and Xenorhabdus genomes. For example, we compared
the RGPs located within the trmE CDS-site (Figure 2).
In the Salmonella enterica Typhimurium genome, trmE
is the insertion point for the SG1 genomic island, which
includes antibiotic resistance genes and metabolic genes

[70,71]. We found no homolog of SGI1 within the trmE
sites of the Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genomes or
elsewhere in the complete genome sequences for these
genera. In Photorhabdus strains, RGP112_PL and
RGP106_PA are located in the trmE site. These two
RGPs are very similar, differing only in the presence of
a large central inversion and additional flanking blocks
of genes in Pl. Unlike the Photorhabdus genomes, the
Xenorhabdus genomes had different RGPs at the trmE
site, RGP100_XN and P85_XB. Some P85_XB gene
blocks were found to be located in another region of the
X. nematophila genome, between the mrcA and cpxP
integration sites (RGP1_XN), highlighting the modular
structure of the RGP (see below).
In addition to the trmE CDS-site, a number of other
integration hotspots are conserved in other bacteria.

The CS54 genomic island of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium [72] and the 14 kb genomic island of
E. coli CFT073 [73] are both flanked by the xseA integration hotspot. The rpoS gene is considered to be a
recombination hotspot within the Enterobacteriaceae
[74]. Integration hotspots are also conserved in more
distantly related bacteria. flgL and fbaA are the integration sites of the flagellin glycosylation island of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [75] and the ICESt1 and ICESt3 of
Streptococcus thermophilus [76], respectively. The tropism of MGEs for particular integration hotspots in phylogenetically unrelated taxa highlights the probable
ancestral role of such sites in integration and
recombination.
Modules are the functional units within RGPs

We have shown that no single RGP is conserved
between the four genomes. Indeed, the RGPs identified
were either unique or shared a limited number of subregions. An exhaustive in silico analysis provided evidence
for the structuring of each RGP (P, GI, RGPmob and
RCP none ) into several subregions or modules. These
modules are blocks of genes 0.5 to 60 kb in length, with
a conserved gene order (synteny) in at least two genomes of the Entero set or specific to the strain (see
Materials and Methods).
The modular structure of RGPs sensu lato is illustrated by the organization of RGP99_XN in Xn (Figure
3.A). This RGP is located between two genes of the core
genome, typA and treC. RGP99_XN can be broken
down into four modules. Two of these modules,
RGP99_XN_b and RGP99_XN_c, have a similar organization to gene blocks present in Xb, Pa and Pl. The
other two modules, RGP99_XN_a and RGP99_XN_d,
are specific to the Xn strain (Figure 3.B). Each module
is characterized by a specific G+C content. Furthermore,
most of the genes within a given module are involved in
similar functions: the RGP99_XN_b module encodes a
putative type six secretion system (T6SS; [77]), the
RGP99_XN_c module encodes the XhlA hemolysin,
which has been implicated in virulence in insects [78],
and the RGP99_XN_d module encodes proteins that
may be involved in DNA recombination.
For each genome, a list of modules is given in Additional File 5 and the module to which each gene belongs
is identified in the gene file accessible on PhotoScope
and XenorhabduScope (see Materials and Methods). We
distinguished eight functional classes of modules: 1)
metabolic modules, consisting of genes involved in primary metabolism, metabolite transport and cell component biosynthesis; 2) drug resistance modules; 3)
antibiotic synthesis modules encoding bacteriocins, non
ribosomal peptide synthetase, polyketide synthases; 4)
phage modules, 5) recombination modules encoding

Page 10 of 21

enzymes involved in DNA recombination, such as transposase, invertase, excisionase; 6) environment interaction modules encoding proteins or proteinaceous
structures involved in interactions with the environment
(iron uptake, adhesion to surfaces etc.), 7) host-interaction modules encoding virulence or symbiosis factors
essential for interaction with the insect or nematode
host; 8) modules of unknown function.
We calculated the proportion of modules belonging to
each functional class in the four genomes studied (Figure 4). As previously reported [17], RGPs consist of
recombination (4 to 16%) and phage (9 to 14%) modules, each of which mediate intracellular and intercellular DNA mobilization in Eubacteria. Surprisingly,
recombination modules were found to be more frequent
in the Xenorhabdus genomes (13.5% and 16.5%, in Xb
and Xn, respectively) than in the Photorhabdus genomes
(4% and 11% in Pa and Pl, respectively). This difference
in recombination module content suggests a difference
in recombination strategy between the two genera, with
greater recombination activity in the Xenorhabdus genomes. This hypothesis is supported by the different patterns of GC skew between the Photorhabdus and
Xenorhabdus genomes. Indeed, whereas the Photorhabdus genome GC skews were classical, with two major
shifts, one near the origin and the other near the replication termination site, the Xenorhabdus genome GC
skews were inverted at several points over the chromosome (Additional File 4). These data were confirmed by
optical mapping [34] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(Ogier and Gaudriault, unpublished data). Such unusual
GC skew patterns have already been described in a few
genomes [79-82] and were interpreted as the result of
recent chromosomal rearrangements, which are commonly observed in vivo [79].
Antibiotic modules (3 to 6%) and drug resistance
modules (4 to 5%) constitute another canonical module
class [17,20]. The Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus flexible genomes contain numerous genes and operons
encoding antibiotic molecules and secondary metabolites, such as non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides and
bacterocins. These products are prime candidates for
HGT, because they provide a gain-of-function phenotype and are not essential to the microbial cell [2].
Furthermore, one of the major challenges for entomopathogenic nematode symbiosis is the maintenance of a
monoxenic infection in an insect cadaver in the soil.
Flexibility, resulting in the renewal of antimicrobial factors, is therefore likely to be determinant for Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus.
In addition to the most common building blocks
found in MGEs, we identified modules more specifically involved in metabolism, environment/host interaction and unknown functions. Metabolic modules

syntenic genes, (i.e. with a conserved genomic organization in at least two genomes of the Entero set). The putative biological functions of
modules are defined by the specific colors of the box (see the legend below the figure). Yellow squares indicate modules conserved in at least
two genomes of the Entero set. Others are modules specific to the strain. The thin vertical black arrows indicate RGP integration sites. The
conserved modules in the four genomes are linked by dotted lines. Modules are conserved if they have more than 80% of syntenic genes in
common (syntenic genes between two genomes are colocalized genes that shared at least 30% of identity on 80% of the shortest sequence by
BlastP). For example, the two modules RGP99_XN_b (T6SS) and RGP99_XN_c (xhlAB) are conserved between the four genomes. RGP99_XN_b is
composed of 16 genes potentially encoding a type six secretion system (T6SS). The 16 genes display colocalized orthologous genes in XB, PA
and PL (identity between orthologs of XN and XB modules: 75% to 97%; identity between orthologs of XN, PL and PA modules: 58% to 91%).
RGP99_XN_c is composed of 3 genes, two of them encode an hemolysin belonging to the two partner secretion system family and display
colocalized orthologs in XB (73 to 90% of identity), PA (52 to 75% of identity) and PL (51 to 77% of identity).

constituted the most frequently represented class,
regardless of the strain considered (22-27%). This finding highlights the contribution of the acquisition of
additional metabolic traits to adaptability and competitiveness under certain circumstances, such as during
the colonization of a new niche or rapidly changing
growth conditions [2]. Interactions between host and
environment also account for a large proportion of

modules (22-31%). This may reflect the complex life
style of these bacteria, which interact with two invertebrate hosts, an insect and a nematode. No known
function could be attributed to 13 to 18% of the modules, and the hypothetical proteins encoded by the
genes of these modules are good candidates for identifying new genes playing a role in the particular lifestyle
of these bacteria.

Figure 4 Module function distribution in the flexible genomes
of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 (Pl), Photorhabdus
asymbiotica ATCC43949 (Pa), Xenorhabdus nematophila
ATCC19061 (Xn) and Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004 (Xb). Eight
module functions were defined (see the legend below the figure).

The modular structure of some MGEs has already
been reported in previous studies. This structure consists principally of intracellular mobility modules, intercellular mobility modules and antibiotic resistance
modules [17,20]. Furthermore, it has been described
principally for phages, transposons, ICEs and GIs
[24,69,83-89]. By measuring features describing the rate
of change of DNA in the locus of enterocyte and effacement of Escherichia coli, Castillo and coworkers also
concluded that the GI had a mosaic structure and identified subregions, rather than the whole GI, as the true
units of selection [90].
In this study, we show that (i) the modular structure
relates not only to prophages and GIs but also to
RGP mob and RGP none , (ii) module functions cover a
broad range of functions involved in adaptation to the
bacterial environment. RGPs sensu lato are therefore
polyfunctional, and the functional unit of the RGPs is
the module. This RGP organization is observed in the

As discussed above, no entire RGP is conserved between
the four genomes analyzed in this study and RGPs are
composed of functional units, the modules. We investigated whether the mobility of these modules within and
between cells could have contributed to shaping the
RGPs in the different strains or species of a taxon. We
compared the distribution of modules throughout the
genome and their organization, between the four genomes studied.
We first analyzed the distribution of modules within
the Entero set initially used for RGP characterization
(Figure 5). We defined five classes of module as a function of their conservation within a taxonomic group: i)
modules found exclusively in the genome of the strain
of interest ("strain” modules); ii) modules found exclusively in the genomes of the two Photorhabdus strains
or the two Xenorhabdus strains ("genus” modules); iii)
modules present in at least one Photorhabdus genome
and one Xenorhabdus genome but absent from the genomes of other bacteria of the “Entero” set ("PhotoXeno” modules), iv) modules found in genomes of
pathogenic bacteria of the “Entero” set ("pathogens”
modules) and v) modules found in the non pathogenic
bacterium E. coli K12 strain ("Enterobacteriaceae” modules). The modules belonging to “Photo-Xeno”, “Enterobacteriaceae” and “pathogens” groups were evenly
distributed in the four strains, together accounting for
between 30 and 40% of the modules (Figure 5). There
were relatively few “Photo-Xeno"-specific modules (7%
to 13%). Therefore, despite having very similar lifestyles
(entomopathogenic bacteria living in symbiosis with
nematodes) and being closely related phylogenetically,
the flexible genomes of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus
were different, suggesting different mechanisms of molecular adaptation to the environment and hosts of these
two genera. Most of the modules in these four genomes
were of the “strain” and “genus” types, these two types
of module together accounting for about two thirds of
the modules. However, the Photorhabdus genus had
similar proportions of “strain” and “genus” modules,
whereas the Xenorhabdus genus had a higher proportion
of “strain” modules (54 to 57%) than of “genus” modules
(9% to 11%). Thus, the flexible genome of Xenorhabdus,
unlike that of Photorhabdus, is mostly strain-specific.
This may reflect the closer phylogenetic relationship
between P. luminescens and P. asymbiotica than
between X. nematophila and X. bovienii [26].
We then assessed module synteny between the four
strains studied, by aligning conserved modules on linear

The T6SS and XhlA/B modules are either in a syntenic
block (Xn and Xb), intercalated with additional modules
(Pa and Pl) or partially duplicated (Pl). They are also
flanked by additional modules specific to the strain or
conserved inside others RGPs. A patchy structure has
already been described for MGEs, consistent with horizontal transfer leading to the gradual stepwise construction of these MGEs [69,90-92].
Our data show that the RGPs of the flexible genome
are shaped by the acquisition and loss of modules, and
that RGP diversity probably results from intrachromosomal or interchromosomal rearrangements between module units.
Modules are the units of deletion of RGPs involved in
short-term genome rearrangements

module synteny with each other, particularly Xenorhabdus species. As an illustration of this absence of synteny
between modules, we further analyzed the genomic
organization of modules initially described in
RGP99_XN, in the four genomes studied (Figure 3). In
the Xn, Pl, Pa and Xb genomes, the T6SS and XhlA/B
modules were both found in a single RGP but they are
not located in the same integration site, as these modules were flanked by different genes of the core genome.

If modules do indeed shape the RGPs during genome
evolution, some rearrangements are likely to be detectable in clonal populations during growth in the laboratory. We therefore searched for intrachromosomal
rearrangements of modules within the genome of Pl clonal variants available in our laboratory. TT01a is a Pl
variant collected from a laboratory-maintained symbiotic
nematode [38]. TT01a differs from the Pl reference genome by nine large-scale deletion events in the flexible
genome, but these genomic changes have cryptic phenotypic consequences. The boundaries of the deleted
regions in TT01a were located in the Pl genome by a
combination of macrorestriction and DNA microarray
experiments [38].
We first compared the boundaries of the deleted
regions and the module boundaries. All the regions
deleted in TT01a were found to be embedded in an
RGP, and seven of the nine regions matched with one
or several modules. We analyzed the precise boundaries
of four selected loci within these seven deleted regions:
locus D, which matches module RGP45_PL_a and
encodes metabolism and drug resistance functions; locus
E, which matches module RGP53_PL_c and encodes
antibiotic biosynthesis functions; locus F, which matches
with modules GI59_PL_a, b and encodes metabolism
and host interaction functions; locus I, which matches
with modules P80_PL a, b, c, d, e, f and encodes metabolism and phage functions [38]. For each locus, we performed multiplex PCR amplification with two primer
pairs flanking the left (primer 1/primer 2) and the right
(primer 3/primer 4) boundaries of the regions deleted in
TT01a (Figure 7.A). As predicted by macrorestriction
and DNA microarray experiments, PCR amplification
generated two fragments (fragments [1-2] and [3-4] )
when Pl genomic DNA was used as the template, and
one fragment (fragment [1-4]) when TT01a genomic
DNA was used as the template (Figure 7.B), confirming
the occurrence of a deletion event in the TT01a

genome. We mapped the deletion boundaries more precisely, with the goal of obtaining an exact picture of the
result of the deletion making it possible to predict the
intrachromosomal rearrangements occurring at these
loci, by sequencing the four fragments [1-4] obtained
from the TT01a genome.
For all four fragments, the sequence data confirmed
the predicted deletion boundaries: the D, E, F, I locus
boundaries exactly matched the module boundaries
identified by in silico analysis, validating our modularization procedure. Moreover, we distinguished two
classes of deletion patterns potentially matching at
least three deletion scenarios (Figure 8). At loci F and
I, which are embedded in GIs, the whole module or
block of modules was found to be missing in the
TT01a genome, suggesting that a single block deletion
event led to the Pl/TT01a transition in this part of the
genome. In both cases, a gene encoding an enzyme
involved in DNA recombination (transposase for locus
F and integrase for locus I) is located at the internal
border of the locus and is therefore a good candidate
for involvement in the rearrangement. By contrast, at
loci D and E, which are embedded in RGPs sensu
stricto, only subregions of modules are missing in the
TT01a genome, consistent with the occurrence of
more complex rearrangement events in these genomic
areas during the Pl/TT01a transition. Locus E in the
TT01a genome consists of five fragmented remnants
of the initial locus E. Genomic reduction has probably
occurred in several stages at locus E, although the
absence of mobile elements or genes encoding

recombination functions makes it difficult to determine
the genomic rearrangement scenario. Locus D in the
TT01a genome displays a shuffling pattern at three
locations: a 105 bp nucleotide sequence at the left
internal border; a region composed of two Enterobacteriaceae repeat intergenic consensus (ERIC)
sequences, a transposase-encoding gene and a nucleotidic sequence of 154 bp at the right internal border; a
region composed of the truncated plu1870 and
plu1872 genes and the plu1871 gene interrupted by a
transposase gene in the middle part. As the elements
within these shuffled subregions are probably remnants
of molecular actors involved in the rearrangements of
locus D, we analyzed them further. ERIC elements are
miniature (127 bp) non autonomous mobile elements
in Enterobacteriaceae genomes [93,94]. The Pl genome
is particularly rich in such repeats [35]. The two transposase genes encoded a transposase of the IS928
family. The 105 and 154 bp sequences are palindromic
nucleotide sequences consisting of fragments dispersed
in the Pl genome. They display no sequence similarity
to each other or to ERIC and the two transposase
genes. The inserted transposases and ERIC sequences
clearly played a role in the plasticity of locus D, but
the origin and role of the exogenous 105 bp and 154
bp nucleotide sequences remain unknown.
In conclusion, whatever the molecular mechanism
involved in these deletion scenarios, in the case of clonal
genomic plasticity, the modules may be deleted over a
timescale corresponding to growth in the laboratory and
may be considered units of deletion within RGPs.

Conclusions
The data presented here participate to a better vision of
the bacterial flexible genome organization. The characterization of RGPs by the RGPFinder method showed
the flexible genome to be much broader than the sum

Page 15 of 21

of GIs and prophage elements. Additional elements –
RGPmob and RGPnone elements – lacking classical mobility features may be hypervariable regions that undergo
deletions, ancient mobile elements with a degraded
mobilization machinery, MGE that can be mobilizable
in trans by other MGEs or non canonical MGE for
which the mobility mechanism has yet to be described.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that not only GIs and
prophages, but all RGPs sensu lato have a mosaic structure composed of modules that are both functional and
plasticity units.
The application of comparative genome sequencing to
experimental evolution studies provides us with an
opportunity to study the link between genome dynamics
and adaptive evolution. Nevertheless, such studies are
generally carried out on bacterial populations evolving
in a synthetic broth culture, and they mostly identify
point mutations [95,96]. Here, by carrying out comparative genomics studies on variants obtained from their
host in the laboratory, we showed experimentally that
the same modules undergo genomic rearrangements
during genome speciation and short-term genomic rearrangements. This work improves our understanding of
the process responsible for bacterial genome diversification and evolution.
Obtaining of these data were made possible by the use
of the Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genera for our
comparative genomic study. Indeed, the life cycle of
these genera is restricted to two successive ecological
niches. We argue that this unusual pattern of selective
pressure is responsible for an alternation of genomic
shuffling: HGT in the insect cadaver, which constitutes
an abundant nutrient resource potentially shared with
many other microorganisms and intrachromosomal
rearrangements of recently acquired modules in the bacterial monoxenic culture within the nematode gut, as
observed in the Pl variant isolated from a laboratorymaintained symbiotic nematode. We therefore suggest
that Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are suitable new
bacterial models for studies of the evolution of bacterial
genomes.
Finally, the data obtained in this study contribute to
our understanding of the fluid nature of genomes
throughout the kingdoms of life. According to J. A. Shapiro, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are genetic engineers and mobile elements are “natural genetic
engineering systems” that facilitate the evolutionary
rewriting of genomic information [97]. Shapiro’s hypothesis is that repeated evolutionary challenges have
selected systems that (i) reduce the size of the genomic
search space and (ii) maximize the chance of success by
using combinatorial processes based on basal functional
components [97]. We argue that the modules described
here are entirely consistent with this vision, as these

Methods
Bacterial strains and genome sequences

Photorhabdus luminescens subspecies laumondii strain
TT01 is a symbiont of the nematode Heterorhabditis
bacteriophora isolated in Trinidad and Tobago [35,98].
The genome of strain TT01 consists of a single circular
chromosome of 5,688,987 bp (accession number
NC_005126). Photorhabdus asymbiotica subspecies
asymbiotica strain ATCC43949 is a North American
clinical isolate. This strain was isolated in 1977 from a
female patient with endocarditis, in Maryland, USA
[32,99]. The genome of strain ATCC43949 consists of a
single circular chromosome of 5,064,808 bp and a
29,732 bp plasmid [36] (accession numbers NC_012962
and NC_012961, respectively). Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC19061, the type strain of the species, is a
symbiont of the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae,
isolated from Georgia, USA [100]. The genome of strain
ATCC19061 comprises a single circular chromosome of
4,432,590 bp and a 155,327 bp plasmid [34] (accession
numbers FN667742 and FN667743, respectively). Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004 is a symbiont of the nematode
Steinernema jollieti sp. isolated from a woodland in the
Missouri valley, USA, in 1999 [101]. The genome of
strain SS-2004 comprises a single circular chromosome
of 4,225,498 bp [34] (accession number FN667741). The
four genomes were input into the PhotoScope and
XenorhabduScope databases http://www.genoscope.cns.
fr/agc/mage.
RGP identification

Regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs) were sought in the
P. luminescens TT01, P. asymbiotica ATCC43949, X.
nematophila ATCC19061 and X. bovienii SS-2004 genomes, with the RGPfinder web tool implemented in the
MaGe annotation platform (http://www.genoscope.cns.
fr/agc/mage; Roche et al., unpublished data). Briefly,
RGPFinder searches for breaks in synteny between a
reference genome and the genomes of a set of related
bacteria – the bacterial genome set (Figure 1.A). A RGP
sensu lato is the sum of overlapping subregions missing
in at least one of the bacterial genomes of the comparison set. RGPs have a minimal size of 5 kb. This
excludes the isolated insertion sequences of the RGPs,
but favors regions with several genes of potential functional interest in the bacterial biology. This definition
does not involve any underlying assumption about the
evolutionary origin or genetic basis of these variable
chromosomal segments. RGPFinder also provides information about composition abnormalities (GC% deviation, codon adaptation index) and about the features

Page 17 of 21

flanking the RGPs, such as tRNA, IS, integrase (int) and
genetic elements involved in DNA mobility (mob),
which are common characteristics of foreign DNA
acquired by horizontal genetic transfer. The results
obtained with this web tool include those for Alien
Hunter [102], a method detecting atypical sequences (i.
e., sequences potentially acquired by horizontal genetic
transfer) through the analysis of composition bias.
Predicted RGPs were then manually inspected, to
eliminate false-positive results. Indeed, point mutations
may lead RGPFinder to identify a region as an RGP
when it actually belongs to the core genome. Finally, the
boundaries of the RGP were homogenized between the
compared genomes and potential insertion sites were
defined. The genomes used in the bacterial genome set
were those of P. luminescens TT01, P. asymbiotica
ATCC43949, X. nematophila ATCC19061, X. bovienii
SS-2004, Yersinia pestis CO92 (accession number
003143); Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Typhi
CT18 (accession number NC_003198), Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043 (accession number
NC_004547) and E. coli K12 (accession number
NC_000913). Finally, Prophinder was used to detect prophages among the RGP sensu lato [53], http://aclame.
ulb.ac.be/Tools/Prophinder/.
Definition and distribution of modules

The MaGe web interface [103] was used to divide RGPs
manually into subregions corresponding to blocks of
genes specific to the strain or blocks of syntenic genes
(i.e. genes with a conserved genomic organization in at
least two genomes of the Entero set). These subregions,
which often contain genes of similar biological function,
were named “modules”. The distribution of modules
among the “Enterobacteriaceae” genome set was analyzed manually: a module was considered present (or
partially present) in a genome if it had more than 80%
(25%) of syntenic orthologous genes (orthologous genes
shared at least 30% of identity on 80% of the shortest
sequence by BlastP) with the module of the reference
genome. The module was otherwise considered to be
absent. Descriptions of the modules and their distributions are available from PhotoScope https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/wwwpkgdb/Login/log.php?pid=13
and XenorhabduScope https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/
agc/mage/wwwpkgdb/Login/log.php?pid=24, by opening
the Genomic Object Editor of a gene and consulting the
“Module” results.
Multiplex PCR procedure and sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted as previously described
[44] and stored at 4°C. Primers flanking the right (primers P1/P2) and left (primers P3/P4) module borders
were designed with Primer 3 http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/

6. Multiplex PCR with the four primers (P1, P2, P3, P4)
was performed with a Bio-Rad thermocycler (Bio-Rad,
Marne La Vallée, France). Fragments with a predicted
size smaller than 3 kb were amplified with Invitrogen
Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, France), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Fragments with a predicted
size greater than 3 kb were amplified with the Herculase
Enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam
Zuidoost, Pays Bas) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples of reaction mixtures
were analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose gel. The
fragments amplified by PCR [P3-P4] were purified from
the gel with the high purity purification kit from Roche
(Roche Diagnostic, France) and sequenced with the PCR
primers described in Additional File 6, via a chromosome walking process, by Macrogen (South Korea).
