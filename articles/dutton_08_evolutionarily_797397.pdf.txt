Abstract
Background: A major challenge lies in understanding the complexities of gene regulation.
Mutation of the transcription factor SOX10 is associated with several human diseases. The disease
phenotypes reflect the function of SOX10 in diverse tissues including the neural crest, central
nervous system and otic vesicle. As expected, the SOX10 expression pattern is complex and highly
dynamic, but little is known of the underlying mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern.
SOX10 expression is highly conserved between all vertebrates characterised.
Results: We have combined in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish and computational
comparative genomics to identify the first regulatory regions of the zebrafish sox10 gene. Both
approaches converged on the 3' end of the conserved 1st intron as being critical for spatial
patterning of sox10 in the embryo. Importantly, we have defined a minimal region crucial for this
function. We show that this region contains numerous binding sites for transcription factors known
to be essential in early neural crest induction, including Tcf/Lef, Sox and FoxD3. We show that the
identity and relative position of these binding sites are conserved between zebrafish and mammals.
A further region, partially required for oligodendrocyte expression, lies in the 5' region of the same
intron and contains a putative CSL binding site, consistent with a role for Notch signalling in sox10
regulation. Furthermore, we show that β-catenin, Notch signalling and Sox9 can induce ectopic
sox10 expression in early embryos, consistent with regulatory roles predicted from our transgenic
and computational results.
Conclusion: We have thus identified two major sites of sox10 regulation in vertebrates and
provided evidence supporting a role for at least three factors in driving sox10 expression in neural
crest, otic epithelium and oligodendrocyte domains.

Background
Sox10 is an essential transcription factor regulating development of the neural crest, otic vesicle and oligodendrocytes [1-20]. Study of Sox10 mutant phenotypes in mouse
and fish, coupled with overexpression and knockdown
studies in other vertebrate models, have allowed evaluation of Sox10 function in development (reviewed in
[21,22]. It is likely to have distinct roles at different stages,
at least in the development of neural crest and its derivatives. These include roles in maintenance of multipotency
in neural crest cells, specification of pigment cell and neural fates from the neural crest and differentiation/maintenance of peripheral glial cells. In oligodendrocytes, Sox10
is necessary for differentiation [17]. These roles in development are reflected in the association of SOX10 with several congenital conditions in humans, particularly in
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (OMIM#277580), involving defects in pigmentation and the enteric nervous system [3,23], and in PCWH (OMIM#609136), a complex
syndrome involving dysmyelination in the central and
peripheral nervous systems with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome [6,24-26]. The recent identification of some Sox10
target genes has, in part, helped clarify these disease phenotypes (reviewed in [21].
To date, these congenital diseases have been associated
with changes in the SOX10 coding region, but abnormal
regulation of SOX10 expression might also be expected to
contribute to these diseases. Currently little is known of
how expression of Sox10 itself is regulated, but the notion
that abnormal regulation might underlie human disease
conditions is strongly supported by recent work identifying the deletion of a regulatory enhancer of Sox10 as causing a weak Waardenburg-Shah-like phenotype in a mouse
mutant [27]. It is clear from the detailed descriptions of
the expression patterns in human, mouse, chick, frog and
zebrafish [4,7,8,10,18,28-33], that regulation of Sox10
transcription is likely to be complex, with possibly independent regulation in ear, oligodendrocytes and at different phases of neural crest development. Such a picture has
recently also been described for the related gene Sox9,
where enhancer and promoter elements spread over 300
kb of genomic DNA drive expression in the neural crest,
ear and other tissues [34].
Induction and separation of the neural crest from neurectoderm at the neural plate border is described as a multistep process requiring a tightly regulated temporal cascade
of signalling molecules and transcription factors
(reviewed in [35,36]. Factors previously implicated in
controlling gene expression in the early neural crest
include Wnts [37-39], Notch [40,41], FGFs [42], BMPs
[43,44], Sox9 [45-47], Snail2/Slug [48], FoxD3 [49-53]
and Pax 3 [54]. The first expression of sox10 within this
cascade appears to be after the initial induction events and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/105

hence might be dependent on any of these factors. Furthermore, sox10 expression is later seen during phases
when neural crest cell maintenance, proliferation and differentiation are ongoing. Expression of sox10 in the developing otic epithelium has not been explored, but may be
induced by any or all of Sox9, Pax or Dlx, or by signals
from the hindbrain e.g. FGF [55-58]. Likewise, sox10
expression in the oligodendrocyte lineage may require
Notch signalling [59]. Recent studies of sox10 regulation
in mice has suggested that widely dispersed elements control aspects of sox10 expression [27,60,61]. In zebrafish,
however, our previous work showed that at least some
aspects of early embryonic sox10 expression including that
in the neural crest can be recapitulated using only relatively proximal promoter sequences [19].
The use of transient and germline transgenic zebrafish are
complementary in promoter analysis [62]. Transient
transgenics allow very rapid assessment of injected plasmid constructs. However, they are prone to copy number
artifacts distorting the level of transgene expression and
require cumulative scoring to minimise false negative
results and deduce the comprehensive expression pattern
of any individual construct tested. Also ectopic expression
in areas such as muscle and notochord are common.
Alternatively, germline transgenic zebrafish, even when
using improved methods that provide higher integration
rates [63], still require lengthy raising and identification
of adult founders to provide F1 transgenic embryos. However, if multiple lines for each construct are compared to
eliminate position effect artefacts the expression profiles
in these lines are taken to recapitulate endogenous gene
expression.
Given the importance of Sox10 in neural crest development, understanding the regulatory factors driving expression in each tissue will further our understanding of
developmental and disease mechanisms and might, for
example, suggest further candidate genes underlying Hirschsprung's disease and deafness. Recent advances in
sequence analysis programs have allowed identification
of regulatory elements in non-coding sequences conserved between both closely related and divergent species
[64,65]. Combined with analyses of predicted elements in
transgenic embryos such studies enable the functional relevance of predicted regulatory regions to be determined.
Nevertheless, some conserved, regulatory regions may
show strong sequence divergence and thus may be cryptic,
so that a traditional approach of systematic testing of
upstream and other potential regulatory regions remains
important [66]. We have combined these approaches to
begin to determine factors regulating sox10 gene expression in embryonic zebrafish. We show that a short
3'region of the zebrafish sox10 intron 1 is critical in regulating embryonic sox10 expression and identify an evolu-

neural crest-inducing transcription factors clustered

sox10:GFP expression in transient transgenic zebrafish
To identify functional zebrafish sox10 regulatory regions
we generated a series of plasmid constructs using 5'
genomic DNA flanking the zebrafish Sox10 coding region
to drive expression of GFP. Plasmid constructs psox104725:GFP (containing sox10 regulatory regions used previously [13,67]) and psox10-1252:GFP contain the sox10
gene DNA respectively 4725 bp and 1252 bp immediately
5' of the transcript start site. The latter is defined from our
sequencing of zebrafish sox10 cDNAs in which the characteristic signature of the 5' 7-methyl-guanosine cap [68]
was found immediately 5' to sequences of exon 1 as
defined in Fig. 1 (Dutton et al., 2001; TJC, PhD Thesis,
University of Bath). Both constructs also contain the
zebrafish sox10 exon 1, intron 1 and the start of exon 2
(Fig. 1). The GFP sequence was placed so the ATG
sequence of GFP is in the same relative position as the
Sox10 ATG (Fig. 1C). The constructs were then used to test
if these regions of DNA contain sufficient regulatory elements to drive detectable GFP expression in a pattern
reflecting the endogenous sox10 pattern in embryonic

zebrafish. When injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryos
approximately one third of injected embryos subsequently expressed GFP in one or more discrete cell types.
Examples of cells expressing GFP in transient transgenic
sox10:GFP embryos are shown in Fig. 2. In embryos
injected with constructs psox10-4725:GFP or psox101252:GFP, GFP expression was initially seen at early somite
stages in areas corresponding to premigratory neural crest
(Fig. 2A, B). By 24 hpf expression was seen in migrating
neural crest cells in the head and body. These included
migrating cells in all major pathways, including the
streams forming the branchial arches, cells populating the
peripheral head, and cells on both medial and lateral
pathways in the trunk and tail (data not shown). In these
transient transgenic embryos some of these cells had the
morphology and characteristic pigment of melanophores
and xanthophores. GFP expression was also prominent in
the olfactory neurons (Fig. 2C), otic epithelium (Fig. 2D)
and CNS neurons in both the brain and spinal cord. At 48
hpf GFP expression in xanthophores and melanophores
was still visible (Fig. 2E) and Rohon-Beard neurons were
sometimes labeled. Cells of the developing inner ear also
continued to express GFP strongly. GFP expression at 48
hpf became visible in differentiating cartilage cells of the
pectoral fin and the jaw and persisted until at least 7 dpf
(Fig. 2H). GFP expression persisted in the interneurons of

the CNS for 4 days (Fig. 2F). At 72 hpf GFP expression
became visible in developing oligodendrocytes, initially
in the ventral neural tube and then in a more widespread
pattern as they disperse throughout the CNS (Fig. 2G).
GFP expression in lateral line Schwann cells was not seen
in transient transgenic fish expressing GFP from the
psox10-1252:GFP construct but was visible, rarely, in transient transgenic embryos injected with the psox104725:GFP construct. In addition, GFP expression was seen
in notochord and muscle cells, common sites of ectopic
reporter expression in transgenic zebrafish [62]. These
patterns are fully consistent with those described for constructs containing intermediate length promoter fragments (TJC, PhD Thesis, University of Bath). Together,
these data suggested that the genomic sox10 DNA region
present in all these constructs, but importantly even in the
smallest one containing only 1252 bp of upstream
sequence, contained regulatory sequences able to drive
mosaic GFP expression in transient transgenic zebrafish
with an expression profile and timing consistent with that
previously described for the zebrafish sox10 gene by in situ
hybridisation [8].
Germline sox10:GFP transgenic zebrafish
Before extending the promoter analysis, we checked
whether our transient sox10:GFP transgenics data would
be consistent with the pattern of GFP expression seen in
integrated germ line sox10:GFP transgenics. We have previously published a similar line made from the p4.9:GFP
plasmid, Tg(-4.9sox10:egfp)ba2 [19], but since this was only
a single line it was not clear exactly how representative
that pattern might be. Therefore, we generated a number
of sox10:GFP germ line transgenic zebrafish lines using the
psox10-4725:GFP and psox10-1252:GFP constructs. Multiple
transgenic founders were identified for each construct and
representative germline transgenic lines were established.
Initially 10 founders for sox10-4725:GFP and 6 for sox101252:GFP were identified. F2 embryos from all 10 sox104725:GFP founders had similar GFP patterns with no obvious expression domain differences. Lines Tg(4725sox10:GFP)ba3 , Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba4were subsequently maintained in our fish facility as representative
lines although Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba4 embryos have a
slightly greater GFP expression level. The Tg(1252sox10:GFP)ba5 line was the only one maintained from
the shorter construct founders, since it showed no obvious ectopic GFP expression domains; offspring from the
other -1252sox10:GFP founders sometimes displayed
ubiquitous ectopic GFP expression suggesting they were
less insulated against insertion position effects.

expression in transgenic embryos of lines Tg(4725sox10:GFP)ba4 and Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5 are compared in Table 1 alongside the GFP expression profile of
transiently transgenic embryos injected with construct
psox10-1252:GFP. Examples of GFP expression patterns in
Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba4and Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5 are
shown in Fig. 3. The earliest GFP expression seen in the
Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba4 was in the cranial premigratory
neural crest at the 1-somite stage. This expression was not
visible in Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5. At 16 hpf GFP expression was visible throughout the premigratory neural crest
(Fig. 3A) and by 24 hpf in migrating neural crest cells,
branchial arches, ear epithelium and olfactory neurons
(Fig. 3B, C). Weak GFP expression was visible in the neural tube. At 48 hpf GFP expression was observed in the ear
epithelium, and both melanophores (Tg(-4725sox10:GFP
)ba4 only) and xanthophores were labelled (Fig. 3D),
along with jaw and pectoral fin cartilage. GFP expression
was seen in both brain and neural tube. Additional sites of
reporter expression were seen at 96 hpf when labelled
Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes were observed (Fig.
3E, F). GFP expression in pigment cells was largely absent
by this time but the jaw and pectoral fin expression
remained (Fig. 3G, H). These GFP expression patterns
show strong similarities to those we have characterised for
intermediate length promoter fragments, although Tg(4.9sox10:eGFP)ba2 is unique in showing reduced expression in otic vesicle [19] (TJC, PhD Thesis, University of
Bath).
Although transgenic offspring from founders injected
with the psox10-1252:GFP sequence expressed much
weaker GFP levels than individual transient transgenics
containing the same sequence, the GFP patterns in the
transgenic lines were consistent with that deduced from
transiently transgenic cohorts injected with psox101252:GFP.
Lines Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba3 and Tg(4725sox10:GFP)ba4 expressed GFP at a higher level than
Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5 but the pattern and timing of GFP
expression were also comparable in these lines. Some differences in GFP expression between the transgenic lines
and the transient transgenic cohorts could be attributed to
weak levels of expression in the Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5
lines. For example, no melanophores expressing GFP were
seen in Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5 embryos although this was
seen in the corresponding transient transgenic embryos.
Conversely, both glia of the lateral line and DRG associated glia were seen to express GFP in the germline transgenics where this expression had not been seen in the
corresponding transient transgenic cohort. This difference
presumably reflects the mosaic nature of transgene expression in transients and the consequent low probability of
transgene expression in cells derived from uncommon
progenitors.

GFP expression was scored in detail from at least three embryos from each of the Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba4 and Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5 lines. Embryos
were examined at the stages indicated by fluorescent microscopy at 600× and cells expressing GFP scored by position and morphology. The
fluorescent signal in each GFP expressing cell type was scored according to the following levels: – none observed, +/- very weak, + weak, ++ good,
+++ strong, nd not determined. Data for the psox10-1252:GFP construct was deduced from at least 40 transiently transgenic embryos.

Analysis of the GFP expression pattern in lines Tg(4725sox10:GFP)ba4 and Tg(-1252sox10:GFP)ba5, together
with our previous transgenic line [19,69], confirmed our
conclusion from the transient transgenic analysis that the
sox10 genomic sequences described contained regulatory
sequences able to recapitulate the temporal and spatial
pattern of early sox10 expression in zebrafish. In addition,
however, these data considerably reduce the genomic
DNA interval containing these regulatory regions compared with the published Tg(-4.9sox10:egfp)ba2 line. Consequently, we decided to extend our analysis of zebrafish
sox10 regulatory regions using a transient transgenic
approach.
Deletion analysis of the zebrafish sox10 promoter
In order to identify more precisely where key sox10 regulatory elements were located, we created a nested series of
5' zebrafish sox10 promoter deletions (Fig. 4). Cohorts of
transient transgenic fish were examined for patterns of

GFP expression at 48 hpf and 96 hpf points and scored
under a fluorescent dissecting microscope at 600× for
both numbers of fish expressing any GFP signal and those
with GFP signal representing sox10 expression (Fig. 4,
Table 2). Significantly, the representative sox10-like pattern of GFP characterised above was maintained in constructs following increasingly greater 5' deletions.
Although the overall level of GFP expression was reduced
with larger 5' deletions (as deduced from the lower percentage of fish expressing GFP in any pattern; due to the
selection for visible expression the level of GFP expression
in individual cells where seen was generally comparable),
deletion of the transcript start was required for complete
loss of the sox10-like pattern of GFP expression. Although
expression in fish injected with psox10-100:GFP, a construct containing only 100 bp of sequence 5' to the transcript start, resulted in a very low percentage of GFPexpressing fish, the spatial pattern of GFP was generally
maintained with all sox10-like GFP-positive cell-types rep-

resented. This suggested that although control of the level
of the sox10:GFP expression was mediated by sequences 5'
of the transcript start, critical elements regulating the spatial pattern of sox10 expression were likely to be located
elsewhere within the construct.
To attempt to identify these elements we next constructed
plasmids from a zebrafish sox10 cDNA (i.e. lacking intron
1), but with the addition of flanking genomic sequences
from exon 1 (Fig. 4). The first of these were psox101000cDNA:GFP and psox10-1252Δ(+133–+2220):GFP. These
both deleted the whole of intron 1 and differed only in
252 bp of DNA 5' of the transcript start. Transgenic fish
containing either of these two constructs contained only
extremely rare GFP expressing cells and all sox10-like
expression was absent. This immediately suggested that
regulatory elements controlling the sox10:GFP expression
pattern were present within intron 1. Restriction sites
present in intron 1 enabled analysis of constructs containing either 5' or 3' portions of intron 1. Construct psox101252Δ(+1862–+2220):GFP deleted 376 bp from the 3' part of
intron 1. Transgenics made with this construct showed no

GFP expression in a sox10-like pattern. In contrast, psox101252Δ(+159–+1862):GFP transgenics retained the 3' part of
intron 1 and expressed GFP in a sox10-like pattern (Fig.
4B). These data suggested that regulatory elements controlling sox10:GFP expression were likely to be contained
within the 376 bp at the 3' end of intron 1.
Zebrafish sox10 intron 1 harbors predicted promoter
sequences and constrained transcription factor binding
sites
We used the FirstEF promoter prediction algorithm [70]
with a view to beginning to identify the location of the
sox10 promoter in nine species. This software takes a
genomic sequence and identifies putative promoters by
evaluating genomic regions for CpG islands, promoter
regions and first exon donor sites. This algorithm has been
shown to appropriately identify about 80% of first exons
with a false prediction rate of approximately 15%. In addition to the position of the predictions, FirstEF output
includes the probability of finding a true promoter at the
predicted location. These analyses revealed that all species
have a predicted promoter within intron 1 of the sox10

gene (Fig. 5), with results from only two of the eight species (human and chicken) having a probability significantly lower than 1. Interestingly, this software did not
predict the transcription start site used in the identified
zebrafish sox10 cDNAs (AA, data not shown).
Multi-species comparative sequence analysis is emerging
as a powerful tool for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. Indeed, this approach has proven useful for
sox10 using data from multiple mammalian species
[27,60,61]. However, this technique presents unique
problems at greater phylogenetic distances and detailed
analysis using zebrafish as a reference sequence has not
revealed any significant non-coding nucleotide conservation compared to multiple mammalian species or chicken
at sox10 (data not shown; see also [61]). However,
because functionally conserved elements can be missed by
these in silico approaches [66], we explored the possibility
that smaller motifs (e. g. transcription factor binding
sites) are conserved between these species. Specifically, we
identified regions 100% identical and at least six basepairs
long in seven mammalian species at sox10 intron 1 using
the ExactPlus software [27]. The conserved fragments were
then submitted to TRANSFAC to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. These analyses revealed six
biologically-relevant predictions in mammalian species
(Fig. 5B; See Additional file 1). To determine if these predictions were conserved in chicken and zebrafish, we submitted the entire intron one sequence for each species to
TRANSFAC. Interestingly, chicken and zebrafish

sequences have the same predictions as mammals in the
3' most region of intron one. Furthermore, not only are
these sequences conserved but so is their arrangement. We
hypothesised that these conserved transcription factor
binding sites might contribute to an enhancer regulating
sox10 expression in zebrafish.
Functional testing of predicted transcription factor binding
sites
The critical regions of the sox10 promoter highlighted in
this study contained numerous binding sites for transcription factors previously implicated in both neural crest and
sox10 regulation, including Notch, β-catenin/Tcf, FoxD3
and SoxE proteins. Before focusing our attention on the
highlighted regions we wished to confirm whether these
proteins were indeed individually competent to induce
sox10 expression in zebrafish. Embryos at the single cell
stage were injected with constructs containing notchΔEmv, a
constitutively active Notch, Δβ-catenin (an activated
βcatenin) or sox9b under the control of a heatshock promoter. The embryos were incubated at 28.5°C for 6 hours
before being subjected to a 60 min, 37°C heatshock, then
left for 1 hour before fixing and processing to detect sox10
transcripts by in situ hybridization. These embryos, equivalent to approximately 8-9 hpf embryos, would be
expected to be too young to show endogenous sox10
expression at this stage. Consistent with this, uninjected
embryos subjected to heatshock did not express detectable levels of sox10. In contrast, embryos expressing Sox9b,
Notch or β-catenin showed induced sox10 transcripts in

Quantitation indicated that all three transcription factors
were able to induce sox10 expression in these early
embryo tests (Table 3). In contrast, heatshock promoter
driven FoxD3 was unable to induce ectopic sox10 expression in this experiment (data not shown).
To support further the idea that regulatory regions within
the promoter region analysed here might be responsive to
these transcription factors, we repeated the heatshock
experiments in the Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba3 reporter line.
Embryos were injected with 400 pg of either hs:notchΔEmvΔGFP (as hs:notchΔEmv but with GFP coding region
deleted) or hs:zsox9b, heat-shocked for 1 hour at 6 hpf,
then left for one hour, before being fixed and examined by
whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridisation for gfp expression. Uninjected embryos showed no gfp expression confirming that at the stage examined endogenous gfp
expression is lacking; in contrast a large proportion of
embryos injected with either the sox9b or notch constructs
showed gfp expression (Table 4; Figure 6C). Interestingly,
the sox9b construct showed a significantly increased proportion of embryos with ectopic gfp+ in injected embryos
after heat shock when compared with non-heat-shocked
controls, whereas the notch construct did not. Given the
known leakiness of this heat shock promoter [71], this
result indicates that the transgene is very sensitive to even
low levels of Notch activity. Together, these data confirm
the responsiveness of the sox10 promoter to Sox9b and
Notch.
Characterisation of regulatory elements in the 3' end of

that the 3' end of zebrafish sox10 intron 1 might contain

of scored fish; n = 33). Notably, the distribution of these
GFP positive cells was consistent with the sox10-like
expression pattern (see +B in Table 2). Re-introduction of
fragment C into the inactive vector also restored GFP to
23% of the fish scored and again the distribution of GFP
positive cells largely corresponded to that expected for
sox10 expression (see +C, Table 2). Significantly, a construct (psox10-1252Δ(+1862–+2220)+BC) containing a fragment
(BC) spanning both the B and C regions was able to
restore GFP expression in appropriate cell types and with
a distribution not significantly different (p > 0.05) to the
parent psox10-1252:GFP construct (see +BC, Table 2). Thus,

adding the BC fragment, which spans all six conserved,
biologically relevant sequence predictions identified bioinformatically, to the psox10-1252Δ(+1862–+2220) vector is sufficient to restore most aspects of the sox10-like pattern.
The positions of these putative transcription factor binding sites in the B and C regions are shown in Fig. 7.
To assay the functional relevance of these sites in
sox10:GFP expression another intronic deletion sequence
containing these sites and including the minimal required
region was generated. The 2–5 fragment contained multiple sites with invariant CAAA cores of consensus Lef/Tcf/
Sox sites(A/T A/T CAA A/T G/T) and includes the evolutionarily conserved Tcf and NFKappaB sites but not the
FoxD3/Sox sites identified in the TRANSFAC analysis of
sox10 promoters. Reintroduction of this piece into an
inactive vector (psox10-1252Δ(+1862–+2220)) could restore
GFP expression in 22% of fish counted and gave a sox10like pattern (see +2–5, Table 2), although the robustness
of the sox10-like profile was reduced. We concluded that
this region with multiple transcription binding sites was
sufficient to restore the correct sox10-like expression of the
heterologous reporter.
Functional testing of the critical sox10 regulatory region
Given the robust induction of sox10 transcription by β-catenin, and given the prominent role of Wnt signalling in
neural crest induction [39,54,72], we wanted to test if the

Tcf/Lef binding sites identified in the B and 2–5 fragments
could act as functional Tcf/Lef binding sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed
using radioactively labelled fragments and myc-tagged
Lef1MT protein (Fig. 8A). A specific DNA band with
reduced mobility was present in reactions containing
Fragment B and Lef1MT protein but not in those with GFP
protein made in vitro. To ensure that the band was not due
to the presence of rabbit reticulocyte extract a supershift
assay was performed with anti-Myc antibody. In the presence of the anti-Myc tag antibody the specific retarded
DNA complex was abolished and replaced by a supershifted band (*, Fig. 8A). The specific complex was however unaffected by incubation with an unrelated anti-WT1
antibody. Competition assays with unlabelled double
stranded oligonucleotides showed that an oligonucleotide containing a wild-type Lef1 binding site
(GTCAAAG) could abolish the specific binding of Lef1MT
to fragment B but oligonucleotides containing only a
mutated site (AGCTGAG) were unable to compete for specific binding (Fig. 8B).
To directly address whether the Lef1 binding sites might
be crucial for sox10 regulation, we next used site directed
mutagenesis (Table 5) to disrupt the CAA core of the conserved Lef1 binding sites B1, B2 and site 5 (see Figure 7).
Mutation of site B1 alone had little effect on Lef1 binding
in vitro (Frag B1, Fig 8C) but additional mutation of site
B2 reduced Lef1 binding to a fragment carrying both
mutations (Fragment B1B2, Fig 8C). Fragment 2–5, previously shown to restore sox10:GFP spatial expression in
transient transgenics, also efficiently bound Lef1 in
mobility shift assays (Fig 8D) and mutagenesis of the sites
B1, B2 and site 5 in this fragment also reduced but did not
eliminate Lef1 binding (Frag 2–5mut, Fig 8D). To eliminate residual Lef1 binding to the B1 site we made fragment 3–5. This fragment contains only two of the
identified evolutionarily conserved Lef1 binding sites.
Fragment 3–5 bound in vitro made Lef1 less efficiently
than fragment 2–5 (Fig 8E) but insertion of this fragment
into the inactive vector was still able to restore sox10:GFP
expression (18/70 embryos screened at 48 hpf). While
this result further delineates the regulatory region
required for sox10-like reporter expression to that surrounding the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites identified in our sequence comparison,
mutagenesis of the conserved Lef1 target sites in the 3–5
sequence could not eliminate Lef1 binding (Fig. 8E) or
sox10:GFP reporter expression (not shown), indicating
that additional target sequences in this region contribute
to embryonic sox10 expression; these additional
sequences may include non-canonical Lef-binding sites,
as well as sites binding other transcription factors. Taken
together, our data provides evidence that regulation of
early sox10 expression is complex, and is likely to depend

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/105

on a combination of both Lef1 and other transcription
factors binding to a defined region of intron 1 of sox10.

Discussion
In this study we have combined comparative sequence
analysis and promoter deletion approaches to identify
evolutionarily constrained regulatory motifs likely to control expression of sox10 in embryos. We determined that
transient transgenic zebrafish containing isolated sox10
regulatory regions including less than 3.5 kb of genomic
DNA sequences 5' of the first zebrafish sox10 codon were
sufficient to drive GFP expression, both in transient transgenics and in germ-line transgenic animals, in patterns
consistent with that previously established for early
embryonic sox10 expression [8,19]. GFP expression was
initiated at the appropriate time in premigratory crest and
otic epithelium and reporter expression was maintained
in the correct cell types, including neural crest derivatives,
the developing ear and later in differentiating oligodendrocytes. This established that in these assays
sequences from the Sox10 protein coding region and 3'
genomic sequences were not required for initial spatial
and temporal sox10 expression in zebrafish. Recent promoter analyses in mouse have indicated that the presence
of long range enhancers, tens of kilobases distal to the
coding and proximal promoter regions, are additionally
necessary for correct temporal and spatial gene regulation
of both sox10 and sox9 genes in mice [27,34,60,61]. These
mouse studies suggest that additional elements regulating
the level of sox10 expression are likely to reside outside the
7 Kb of 5' genomic sox10 sequence in our zebrafish constructs. Indeed, germline transgenic zebrafish made with
the 7 Kb zebrafish sox10 promoter element driving a sox10
cDNA were only partially able to restore the pigment pattern of sox10 mutant fish (JRD, Ben Steventon and RNK,
data not shown).
Nevertheless, we show here that the proximal promoter
fragments tested in this study do regulate reporter gene
expression in a manner recapitulating the early expression
pattern of endogenous zebrafish sox10. Thus, signals controlling sox10 expression in the zebrafish neural crest,
developing ear and later in the oligodendrocyte lineage
are likely to act via regulatory elements contained in the
discrete promoter fragments tested in this study. As deletion of 5' sequence to within 100 bases 5' of the transcript
start maintained a sox10-like reporter expression pattern
in transient transgenic embryos, we hypothesised that this
regulation was mediated through elements residing in the
5' untranslated region encoded by exons 1 and 2, or the
intervening intron. Further dissection of this region indicated that the key elements for the spatial regulation are
contained within the 1.5 kb intron 1.

Sox10 sequences are available from diverse vertebrate species and an intron in this position is conserved in all cases.
Deletion of the entire intron 1 sequence from the
zebrafish sox10:GFP promoter constructs almost completely removed transgene expression and resulted in the
loss of any discrete sox10-like pattern of GFP expression.
As shown here, the promoter prediction program FirstEF
predicted a core promoter overlapping the first intron of
sox10 in all species analyzed. These data combined are
consistent with intron 1 sequences being critical for the
enhancement and/or initiation of sox10:GFP expression.
Regulatory elements within intronic sequences have been
identified in many other genes including sox9 [73] with
cases where the intronic context is also essential [74-76].
The importance of evolutionarily conserved regulatory
elements within vertebrate introns is clearly recognised
[77]. It is less clear how to interpret the highly-conserved
promoter prediction in intron 1, and the lack of promoter
prediction associated with sequences directly upstream of
the sox10 transcription start site. One possibility is that
intron 1 of sox10 contains an enhancer that is necessary to
obtain visible levels of GFP expression in our assays.
Another possibility is that sox10 has a second transcription start site generating a class of sox10 transcripts associated with a downstream, or intronic, promoter and certain
mRNA and EST data in human and mouse support this
notion (AA, data not shown). However, we have no
empirical evidence that this promoter is utilized in
zebrafish. A transcript start has previously been identified
by 5' RACE [8](A. Pauliny, PhD Thesis, University of Bath;
TJD, PhD Thesis, University of Bath), using nested primers
that were located towards the 3' end of exon 2 in the
region that encodes the HMG box DNA binding domain.

zebrafish embryos resulted in a single band on agarose
gels of a size consistent with the inclusion of both exon 1
and exon 2 sequences. This was confirmed by cloning and
sequencing the amplified products and it was noted that
the sequences terminated at a guanine residue not found
in the genomic sox10 sequence and, therefore, presumed
to represent the 5' cap. We cannot exclude the possibility
that the predicted intronic promoter is utilized at low levels or at developmental stages not represented in our 5'
RACE experiments. The positioning of the 5' RACE primers would allow for the amplification of transcripts encoding the highly conserved HMG domain, including any
that might originate from a promoter within intron 1.
However, the only transcripts identified were those that
start in a position that is consistent with the known
intron-exon structure of sox10 and that is conserved in several vertebrate species. Together with our deletion analysis
of sequences 5' of exon 1, this suggests that the regulatory
elements identified within the 3' region of intron 1 most
likely represent enhancer, rather than promoter,
sequences, at least in zebrafish.
Following deletion of a 309 bp 5' portion of sox10 intron
1, GFP expression in oligodendrocytes was significantly
reduced but expression in pigment cells, ear epithelium,
nasal cells or facial and pectoral fin cartilage was unaffected. Sequence analysis showed the presence of a highaffinity CSL binding site TGTGGGAA (consensus YGTGDGAA) within the deleted sequence. CSL is the nuclear
effector component mediating Notch signalling. Both
Notch signalling and expression of sox10 have been
shown to be necessary for the differentiation of oligodendrocyes in the embryonic neural tube [12,59]. A
single low affinity CSL binding site resides just 5' of the
deletion and further experiments will be required to determine if the combined deletion of both CSL sites might
prevent Notch-dependent regulation of sox10 expression
in the oligodendrocyte lineage.
Significantly, however, it is the 3' part of the sox10 intron
1 that our bioinformatics and functional analysis have

independently identified as critical for sox10:GFP expression. Although initial analysis did not identify significant
non-coding sequence conservation between zebrafish and
mammalian sox10 genes [61]; this study), the focused
approach used here, centred on the experimentally validated regulatory region, identified short sequences highly
conserved in sox10 intron 1 of mammals, chicken and
zebrafish. Strikingly, these included putative regulatory
sequences known to bind transcription factors, such as
Tcf/Lef, Sox and FoxD3, previously suggested as candidates controlling the expression of various neural crest
genes including sox10 in premigratory neural crest
[38,39,45-47,50-53]. We show that the arrangement of
these motifs is conserved in chicken and zebrafish sox10
intron 1, highlighting the possible evolutionary conservation of critical regulatory elements for this gene. Strikingly, sequence analysis of these binding sites in the
critical region of the zebrafish sox10 promoter shows a
great number of clustered, closely related Tcf/Lef binding
sites some of which overlap with the Sox and FoxD3
motifs. This is interesting because the context and exact
sequence of transcription factor target motifs has been
shown to regulate the binding affinity of the target Tcf factors [78] and competition for binding to overlapping
sequences may also contribute to controlling the exact
expression profile of sox10 in the developing zebrafish
embryo. We begin to dissect the roles for these transcription factors in regulating sox10 transcription and show
that mutagenesis of several Tcf/Lef binding sites in a minimal region is insufficient to abrogate transcriptional
activity of this region, suggesting that regulation is complex. While our in vivo data is consistent with direct regulation of sox10 by Lef factors, a view supported at least in
part by our initial mutagenesis analysis of the minimal
regulatory region we identified, our in vivo data also indicates regulation by Sox9b and Notch; further studies will
be required to prove whether regulation of sox10 by each
of the three factors identified here is direct or indirect.

Conclusion
The mutational analysis initiated in this study indicates
that sox10 regulation by this intron 1 region is complex,
and depends only in part upon Lef binding sites. It will be
interesting to use chromatin precipitation profiling to
identify the protein complexes residing on each of these
regulatory motifs at different stages of embryonic development as sox10 expression changes. Further mutational
analysis might reveal the relative importance of the identified sites, but our data indicates that regulation is likely
to depend on multiple sites within the critical region identified in intron 1, with these acting at least partially redundantly to drive sox10 expression during embryonic
zebrafish development. A recent analysis of mouse Sox10
regulation identified multiple partially redundant conserved regulatory regions distal to the Sox10 promoter and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/105

concluded that proximal regions were less important for
regulation in mouse [61]. Our data confirm and extend
the evidence that proximal regions, particularly those in
intron 1, are important for correct sox10 regulation in
zebrafish [13,19]. Interestingly these studies in both
zebrafish and mouse implicate the same key regulatory
factors in controlling sox10 expression. Further work will
be needed to identify whether distal and proximal regulatory elements function redundantly in both species or are
divergent evolutionary solutions to the problem of conservation of sox10 regulation.

Methods
Fish Husbandry
Embryos were obtained through natural mating and
maintained at 28.5°C. Embryonic stages are as described
by Kimmel et al. [79]. Embryo ages are described in hours
post-fertilization (hpf).
Construction of zebrafish sox10 promoter constructs
A PAC clone (BUSMP706I16137Q2) with an 84 Kb insert
encompassing the zebrafish Sox10 coding region was partially sequenced 5' and 3' of the previously identified
sox10 coding region (GenBank RefSeq ID NM_131875;
TJC, PhD Thesis University of Bath) (Fig. 1A and 1B). This
sequence enabled both sub-cloning of potential zebrafish
sox10 promoter sequences and a bioinformatics comparison of the zebrafish sox10 5' UTR with potential sox10 promoter sequences from other vertebrates. Plasmid psox104725:GFP (Figs 1 and 4) was constructed as follows. A 7 kb
EcoR1-SpeI fragment terminating at the 3' end just prior to
the ATG of the zebrafish sox10 gene was isolated from
BUSMP706I16137Q2 (TJC, PhD. Thesis University of
Bath) and cloned into EcoRI-SpeI digested pBluescript KS+
(Stratagene). The fragment was subsequently released as a
SalI-XbaI fragment and cloned into SalI-XbaI digested
pCS2XLTGFP to form psox10-4725:GFP. Note that in this
manuscript we number all constructs with respect to the
transcription start site (+1); the psox10-4725 promoter fragment corresponds to the promoter fragment used in previous publications [13,67]. Plasmids psox10-1252:GFP and
psox10-521:GFP were created by double-digesting psox104725:GFP with EcoRI and MluI, and with EcoRI and NdeI,
respectively. Sticky ends were rendered blunt with T4
DNA polymerase and plasmids recircularised using T4
DNA ligase. Plasmid p+20:GFP was described by TJC
(PhD. Thesis, University of Bath). Constructs psox101000cDNA and psox10-1252Δ(+133–2238) were constructed by
PCR using annealed overlapping fragments generated
from a sox10 5' RACE clone [8] and psox10-4725:GFP. Site
directed mutagenesis (Quik Change XL, Stratagene) was
used to insert restriction sites for further deletions: NheI at
position -100, EcoRV at +159, SmaI at +2220. Deletions
between engineered and naturally occurring sites were
used for further deletion constructs: psox10-100:GFP was

formed by re-ligation between NheI at -100 and EcoRI at 4725. Other deletions were: Δ+159 – +1862 re-ligated
between EcoRV and SmaI, Δ+1862 – +2220 re-ligated
between SmaI sites, Δ+159 – +468 re-ligated beween
EcoRV and BmgB1 and Δ+468 – +1862 re-ligated between
BmgBI and SmaI. Restriction analysis and sequencing were
used to confirm vector construction. Prior to embryo
injection all plasmids were isolated using a High Purity
Maxi-prep kit (Marlingen), DNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and confirmed by agarose
gel electrophoresis.
Expression Constructs
The hs:notchΔEmv-hs:GFP plasmid encodes mNotchΔE, a
Notch mutant which undergoes ligand-independent proteolytic cleavage, under the control of the heatshock promoter. The plasmid also encodes GFP under the control of
a second HS promoter and was a gift from Dr Caroline
Beck. To test this construct in the Tg(-4725sox10:GFP)ba3
transgenic line, we deleted the GFP coding region by double digestion with NdeI/SpeI followed by religation, to
make plasmid hs:notchΔEmvΔGFP. pCH85 encoding hs:Δβcatenin was provided by Arne Lekven. Hs:Fkd6 plasmid
was constructed by cloning the zebrafish Fkd6 coding
region as a BamHI-XhoI fragment into pCsHsp. The
zebrafish Sox9b coding region was cloned as an XbaI fragment into pCsHsp from a plasmid supplied by John
Postlethwait (University of Oregon, USA) to generate
plasmid hs:zsox9b. Myc-tagged Lef1 was made from
pCs2Lef1Myc[37], kindly provided by Richard Dorsky
(University of Utah, USA).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/105

ing sequences were inserted into sox10 promoter constructs at the HindIII and Asp718 sites flanking the
transgene. 10 nl purified, undigested plasmid DNA at a
concentration of 10 ng/μl was injected into the cell cytoplasm of 1-cell stage fertilized embryos in injection mix
containing 0.5× Mg free I-SceI buffer and 0.2 units/μl ISceI (Roche, aliquoted and stored at -80°C). Injected
embryos with mosaic GFP expression were identified after
24 hpf and the individuals with the highest contribution
of GFP-positive cells (approximately 30% of GFP positive
embryos) were raised to adulthood. Subsequent crossing
with wild-type fish enabled identification of founder
germline transgenic fish for individual lines following
observation of non-mosaic GFP expression in F1
embryos. Temporal and spatial expression of GFP was
monitored and documented as for the transient transgenic embryos. Additional images were taken using a LSM
510 (Zeiss) confocal microscope.

Generation and scoring of transient transgenic embryos
10 nl purified, undigested plasmid DNA at a concentration of 40 ng/μl in water containing 0.1% phenol red was
injected into the yolk of 1 cell stage fertilized, wild-type
zebrafish embryos. Morphologically abnormal embryos
were identified and discarded at 24 hpf. GFP expression
was initially observed in live embryos using a MZFL fluorescent dissecting microscope (Leica) before confirmation
and documentation using an Eclipse E800 compound
microscope (Nikon). GFP expressing cells were identified
by their location and morphology and cohorts of at least
35 GFP-positive embryos were examined in detail to compile an overall expression profile for each construct, paying special attention to known sox10 expression domains.
Photographic documentation utilised a C4880 CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and compiled using Adobe Photoshop.

Promoter and transcription factor binding site predictions
Genomic sequences were obtained by sequencing bacterial artificial chromosomes harboring the sox10 locus or
from the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC)
Genome Browser http://genome.ucsc.edu as previously
described
(Antonellis
et
al.
2006):
human
(chr22:36606845–36725000, July 2003 UCSC assembly), cat (GenBank AC137542), dog (GenBank
AC137537), cow (GenBank AC137534), pig (GenBank
AC137657), rat (GenBank AC137528), mouse
(chr15:79203055–79300747, March 2005 UCSC assembly), chicken (GenBank AC147863) and zebrafish (see
above). Genomic sequences corresponding to the 5'
region of sox10 from each species were submitted to the
FirstEF web-based software [70] to predict promoters and
adjacent first exons. Default FirstEF parameters http://
rulai.cshl.edu/tools/FirstEF/ were employed. Sequences
from intron 1 that were identical in 7 mammalian species
[27] were submitted to TRANSFAC [80] version 8.1 using
the Matrix Search for Transcription Factor Binding Sites
(MATCH) and Pattern Search for Transcription Factor
Binding Sites (PATCH) interfaces. PATCH parameters
were set to identify TRANSFAC entries: (1) in vertebrate
genes and for vertebrate transcription factors: (2) six basepairs or greater; and (3) with the maximum number of
mismatches set at zero. MATCH parameters were set to
identify TRANSFAC entries using the "minimize false negatives" setting. The entire zebrafish and chicken intron 1
sequences were analyzed in the exact same manner.

Generation and scoring of GFP germline transgenic lines
sox10 promoter:GFP germline transgenic zebrafish lines
were generated by co-injection of plasmid constructs containing I-SceI restriction sites and I-SceI restriction enzyme
(Roche). Oligonucleotides containing I-SceI restriction
sites (TAGGGATAACAGGGTAAT) and appropriate flank-

Ectopic gene expression in zebrafish embryos
Zebrafish embryos were injected with 10 nl of a heatshock
plasmid construct at 40 ng/μl concentration at the 1-cell
stage before incubation for 6 hours at 28.5°C. The
embryos were then transferred to pre-warmed embryo
media for 60 min at 37°C. After a further 1 hour incuba-

tion at 28.5°C embryos were fixed and processed for
ectopic sox10 or egfp expression by in situ hybridization
[8].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
PCR generated target probes were end labeled with γ32P
ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England
Biolabs) and purified by native PAGE. In vitro generated
protein was made from purified plasmid vectors using
TNT coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega)
according to the manufacturers instructions. Protein production was confirmed by Western blotting. For electrophoretic mobility assays a 20 μl reaction mixture
containing in vitro made protein, 2000 cpm labeled probe,
1 μg poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 50 mM NaCl, 10
mM Hepes pH7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 3% Ficoll,
0.1 mM DTT and 1 mg/ml BSA was incubated on ice for
20 minutes before separation on a 5%w/v polyacrylamide
(37:1), 0.5% TBE gel at 200 V at 4°C. Dried gels were
exposed to Biomax MS X-Ray film (Kodak). In supershift
experiments 20 μg antibody (anti-WT1 C19 (SantaCruz,
USA), anti-Myc (gift of Jonathan Slack, University of Bath,
UK) was added to the reaction tube 5 minutes prior to
addition of the labelled probe.
Statistics
Chi squared tests were employed using Yates' correction.
Bonferroni correction was used to allow for multiple comparisons.

TRANSFAC analysis of mouse, chicken and zebrafish sox10 intron 1.
The sequence of intron 1 for each species was submitted to the TRANSFAC transcription factor binding site database. Shown, in each case, is the
3'-most region of intron 1, with the last two nucleotides of the intron noted
in bold italics. Sequences that are highly conserved in mammals are
underlined in the mouse intron 1 sequence, and the individual transcription factor binding sites are highlighted in colour. Note the conservation
of the order of predictions for (5' to 3') NFKappaB, TCF, FoxD3, and Sox
binding-site consensus sequences. Furthermore, with one exception
(FoxD3 and Sox consensus sequences in chicken), the orientation of each
predicted binding site is also conserved among the three species.
