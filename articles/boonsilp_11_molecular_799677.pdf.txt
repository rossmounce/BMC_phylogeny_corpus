Abstract
Background: Pathogenic Leptospira spp. present in the blood of patients with leptospirosis during the first week
of symptoms can be detected using culture or PCR. A proportion of patients who are positive by PCR are negative
by culture. Leptospira spp. are fastidious bacteria, and we hypothesized that a false-negative culture result may
represent infection with a distinct bacterial subset that fail to grow in standard culture medium.
Methods: We evaluated our hypothesis during a prospective study of 418 consecutive patients presenting to a
hospital in northeast Thailand with an acute febrile illness. Admission blood samples were taken for Leptospira
culture and PCR. A single tube nested PCR that amplified a region of the rrs gene was developed and applied,
amplicons sequenced and a phylogenetic tree reconstructed.
Results: 39/418 (9%) patients were culture-positive for Leptospira spp., and 81/418 (19%) patients were culturenegative but rrs PCR-positive. The species associated with culture-positive leptospirosis (37 L. interrogans and 2
L. borgpetersenii) were comparable to those associated with culture-negative, PCR-positive leptospirosis
(76 L. interrogans, 4 L. borgpetersenii, 1 unidentified, possibly new species).
Conclusion: Molecular speciation failed to identify a unique bacterial subset in patients with culture-negative, PCRpositive leptospirosis. The rate of false-negative culture was high, and we speculate that antibiotic pre-treatment is
the most likely explanation for this.

Background
Leptospirosis is an acute febrile illness caused by pathogenic species belonging to the genus Leptospira [1,2].
This zoonotic disease has a worldwide distribution but
is most common in tropical and subtropical regions and
has the greatest impact on public health in developing
countries [1-4]. Disease is maintained by chronic carrier
hosts that excrete the organism into the environment,
and infection in man results from direct contact with
infected animals or indirect contact with a contaminated
environment [1-3].
Leptospira are present in the blood during the first week
of infective symptoms [1,2]. Culture is rarely performed in

routine clinical practice since this may take several months
and requires considerable expertise, which places it within
the domain of specialist reference centres. Culture continues to have an important role, however, in defining the
global epidemiology of infection [4]. Identification of the
serovar of infecting isolates can provide clues as to the
chronic carrier host, since certain serovars may by associated with one or a small number of mammalian or other
species [2-4]. Such information makes an important contribution to the development of prevention strategies. Culture also provides vital material for basic and applied
research [1,4].
Although culture provides valuable information and
material, it is only positive in a minority of cases [5-8]. In
a recent study conducted by us to assess the diagnostic
accuracy of a real-time PCR assay for human leptospirosis in Thailand, culture was positive in only 39/133 (29%)

admission from all patients. Leptospira culture was established in Udon Thani hospital on the day of venepuncture, and cultures were maintained and examined weekly
for up to 6 months, as described previously [12]. Species
identification of Leptospira cultures was undertaken by
amplification and sequencing of the near full-length 16S
rRNA gene, as described previously [6]. EDTA samples
were left at room temperature for no more than 6 hours
prior to storage at -80°C.

laboratory confirmed cases [5]. The remaining cases were
diagnosed using the microscopic agglutination test
(MAT), a serologic test on paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples. MAT has been used previously to
infer the prevalent Leptospira serovars in a given region
by determining the serovar against which the highest
titer is raised, but this is associated with considerable
inaccuracy. In Thailand, MAT was reported to predict
the infecting serovar in only 33% of human leptospirosis
cases when compared with serovar determination of the
actual infecting isolate using the cross agglutinin absorption test (CAAT) [9].
PCR is more sensitive than culture for the detection of
Leptospira in clinical samples [5,8,10,11]. In our setting,
PCR detects around twice as many cases of leptospiraemia compared with culture in patients presenting to
hospital with an acute febrile illness [5]. Leptospira spp.
are fastidious microorganisms, and a possible explanation is that patients who are culture-negative but PCRpositive are infected with isolates that fail to grow in the
standard culture medium used (EMJH, Ellinghausen,
McCullough, Johnson, and Harris medium). Here, we
explore this possibility by examining the hypothesis that
Leptospira spp. associated with culture-negative leptospirosis includes a distinct subset at the species level
compared with Leptospira spp. associated with culturepositive infection.

The Leptospira spp. used in this study are listed in Table 1.
Additional isolates used were one clinical isolate of each of
the following: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp.,
Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia
pseudomallei, Orientia tsutsugamushi strain Kato and
Rickettsia typhi. Genomic DNA was extracted from
laboratory cultures using the Wizard® Genomic DNA
extraction kit (Promega, USA), with the addition of 5 μl of
10 mg/ml lysostaphin during the extraction of S. aureus.
The EDTA blood sample was thawed and total DNA
extracted in 2009. Extraction was performed using the
Nucleon™ BACC Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (GE
Healthcare Biosciences, USA) and the extract suspended
in 1 ml of TE buffer. DNA samples were stored at -20°C
prior to use.

Methods

Primer design

Ethics Statement

Primer design was based on three criteria. These were that
primers would: (i) anneal to DNA belonging to Leptospira
spp. associated with disease in humans or animals (i.e.
belonging to the pathogenic and intermediate groups), but
not to saprophytes which can be laboratory contaminants;
(ii) amplify a gene fragment small enough to be sequenced
in a single reaction; and (iii) amplify a gene fragment containing the maximal number of polymorphic sites between
species for the size of product, maximizing the ability of
the region to discriminate between different but closely
related Leptospira species.
We downloaded and aligned 184 sequence traces from
GenBank for the partial or full rrs gene of Leptospira spp.
belonging to nine pathogenic and five intermediate species
(see Additional file, Table S1 for accession numbers). The
number for each species was as follows - pathogenic species: L. interrogans (n = 61), L. borgpetersenii (n = 28),
L. kirschneri (n = 21), L. santarosai (n = 22), L. noguchii
(n = 12), L. weilii (n = 13), L. alexanderi (n = 5), L. alstonii
(n = 2), L. kmetyi (n = 1); intermediate species: L. broomii
(n = 3), L. fainei (n = 3), L. inadai (n = 3), L. licerasiae
(n = 9), and L. wolffii (n = 1). The median length of
sequence traces was 1320 nucleotides (range 977-1509,
IQR = 1318-1431); the 1509 nucleotide trace represents
the full-length rrs of L. interrogans serovar Lai. A 443-

Ethical approval was given by the Ministry of Public
Health, Royal Government of Thailand for the cohort
study of acute febrile illness conducted in northeast Thailand from which the subjects and blood samples used here
were drawn. These patients provided written informed
consent [5]. Additional ethical approval was given by the
Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand for their inclusion in this case-control study.
Patient recruitment, sampling and Leptospira culture

A prospective cohort of 418 consecutive patients presenting to the Udon Thani hospital, northeast Thailand with
an acute febrile illness were recruited between 10th January 2001 and 16th June 2002, as described previously [5].
In brief, patients were identified during twice daily
rounds of the medical wards. Inclusion criteria were
patients who were ≥ 15 years of age with fever (> 37.8°C)
of unknown cause who agreed to participate in the study.
Patients with a blood smear positive for malaria parasites
or those with another definable source of infection on
admission such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection
were excluded from the study. Parallel blood samples for
culture and PCR (5 ml collected into each of heparin and
EDTA blood tubes, respectively) were taken on

nucleotide region was identified that contained 32%
(45/141) of all polymorphic sites within the 184 sequence
trace alignment. This was located at positions 89 to 531 of
the rrs gene of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601
[GenBank: NC_004342].
Single tube nested PCR assay

Molecular assays were performed at the Mahidol-Oxford
Tropical Medicine Research Unit. A single tube nested
PCR was developed that would amplify the 443-nucleotide
rrs fragment described above, together with around 50
bases up- and downstream of this target region. PCR primers were designed using PrimerSelect software (DNASTAR Inc., Wisconsin, USA). Primers were as follows: rrsouter-F (5’ CTCAGAACTAACGCTGGCGGCGCG 3’),
rrs-outer-R (5’ GGTTCGTTACTGAGGGTTAAAAC
CCCC3’), rrs-inner-F (5’ CTGGCGGCGCGTCTTA 3’),
and rrs-inner-R (5’ GTTTTCACACCTGACTTACA 3’).
The resulting amplicon was 547 bp. A 25 μl PCR reaction
contained 4.5 mM of MgCl2, 200 μM of dNTP, 1.25 unit
of Tag DNA polymerase (Roche, USA), 0.150 pmol of
each outer primer, 1.25 pmol of rrs-inner-F, 5 pmol of rrsinner-R, 1 M of Betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and either
1 μl of DNA extracted from laboratory cultures or 5 μl of
DNA extracted from EDTA blood samples taken from
febrile patients. PCR was performed in duplicate for each
sample using a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ
research, USA) using the following conditions: one cycle of
95°C for 2 minutes; 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds, 67°C
for 15 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds; 40 cycles of 95°C
for 10 seconds, 55°C for 15 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds; then one cycle of 72°C for 7 minutes. Positive and
negative controls were included in each run. The positive

control was genomic DNA extracted from L. interrogans
serovar Lai strain Lai spiked into human DNA as diluent.
Human DNA was extracted from a 5 ml blood sample
taken from a single individual and extracted as described
above for clinical samples. The negative control was reaction mixture minus DNA template. Amplicons were visualized using 1.5% gel electrophoresis followed by staining
with ethidium bromide. A positive PCR result was defined
as the visualization of a band of predicted size for one or
both samples.
Analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined using
10-fold serial dilutions of genomic DNA extracted from
L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai and suspended in
human DNA as diluent. Genomic equivalents (GE) were
estimated based on a genomic size of 4,659,275 bp, the
average genome size of two L. interrogans strains [13,14].
Analytical specificity was determined using DNA extracted
from Leptospira spp. (Table 1) and other pathogenic bacteria that are common causes of septicemia or febrile illness in our setting (S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., E. coli,
S. enterica serovar Typhi, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,
B. pseudomallei, O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi).
Sequencing and sequence analysis

Purified PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen
Inc. (Seoul, Korea) using the rrs-inner-F and rrs-inner-R
primers. Sequences were aligned using SeqManII software (DNASTAR Inc., Wisconsin, USA), and trimmed
to the 443-nucleotide region. A neighbor-joining tree
was reconstructed prior to inferring Leptospira spp.
based on a comparison with sequence for 14 pathogenic
and intermediate Leptospira spp. acquired from GenBank database using software Mega 5.0 [15].

Results
Discriminatory power of the 443-nucleotide region to
speciate Leptospira spp

Alignment of the 443-nucleotide rrs fragment of 184
strains revealed a total of 25 unique alleles for 14 different
species. Polymorphic sites, a phylogenetic tree and the frequency of each allele by species are shown in Figure 1.
Eight Leptospira spp. (L. borgpetersenii, L. alexanderi,
L. alstonii, L. kmetyi, L. wolffii, L. inadai, L. licerasiae, and
L. broomii) each had a single unique rrs type (of which
two species, L. kmetyi and L. wolffii, only had one rrs
sequence trace available for the analysis). The remaining 6
species had between two to five alleles; the frequency of
each allele within a given species is shown in Figure 1.
An analysis was performed to determine the discriminatory power of the 443-nucleotide rrs fragment to speciate
the 14 Leptospira spp. compared with the nearly whole
length rrs gene (median length 1320 bp) for the 184
sequence traces by comparing average (%) nucleotide distances. Average distances ranged from 0.27-2.50% between

Page 4 of 9

the pathogenic species and 0.23-3.16% between the intermediate species for the 443-nucleotide region (Table 2).
By comparison, average distances ranged from 0.13-1.42%
between pathogenic species and 0.23-2.73% between
the intermediate species for the near full-length gene
(Table 2). This indicates that the use of the 443-nucleotide
rrs fragment is associated with a similar discriminatory
power to that of longer regions of the rrs gene sequence.
Analytical sensitivity and specificity of single tube nested
PCR

The analytical sensitivity of the PCR assay was determined
using DNA of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai diluted
to reach a final concentration of 100, 10 or 1 GE/reaction.
Duplicate samples at each DNA concentration were evaluated on 10 independent occasions. Both samples were
positive on all occasions for 100 and 10 GE/reaction, while
8/10 runs were positive for 1 GE/reaction (both samples
positive in 6/10 runs and one of two samples positive in
2/10 runs). An LOD value of 1 GE/reaction equates to 40

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analyses of 184 partial rrs sequences from 14 Leptospira species resolves 25 unique alleles. The tree was
reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method as implemented in MEGA ver 5.0 [15]. A total of 45 polymorphic sites were demonstrated.
The vertical numbers shown indicate the nucleotide position based on rrs of L. interrogans serovar Lai [GenBank: AE01300.1], and a dot indicates
an identical nucleotide at that position.

Leptospira cells per 1 ml of human blood using the DNA
extraction and PCR protocol described in materials and
methods. Analytical specificity was determined using DNA
from 15 Leptospira strains belonging to pathogenic, intermediate or non-pathogenic Leptospira spp. (Table 1),
together with 9 other bacterial species that frequently
cause febrile illness in our population. The assay gave a
positive reaction for all Leptospira spp. in the pathogenic
and intermediate groups, and was negative for Leptospira
spp. belonging to the non-pathogenic group. All reactions
were negative using DNA from one representative each of
S. aureus, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, S. enterica serovar
Typhi, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, B. pseudomallei, O.

Leptospira spp. associated with culture-positive and
culture-negative leptospirosis

Admission blood samples were taken for Leptospira culture and PCR from 418 consecutive patients presenting
to a hospital in northeast Thailand with an acute febrile
illness. Culture was positive in 39/418 cases (9%); the
infecting species in these cases (determined by extraction
of genomic DNA from cultured organisms, amplification
and sequencing of the near full-length rrs gene) were
L. interrogans (n = 37) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 2).
The 443-nucleotide rrs PCR assay was performed on all
418 samples. This was positive in 37/39 of the culture
positive cases. A comparison of the sequence from the
two PCR assays demonstrated that the 443-nucleotide rrs

fragment amplified directly from blood was identical to
the same region of the near-full length rrs gene amplified
from cultured organisms in each case. The 443 bp rrs
PCR was also positive for 81 of the 379 culture negative
cases. The infecting species in these cases were defined
based on phylogenetic analysis of the rrs fragment as
L. interrogans (n = 76), L. borgpetersenii (n = 4), and an

containing L. borgpertersenii, L. santarosai, L. weilii and
L. alexanderi, and was most closely related to L. borgpetersenii (Figure 2). The 443-nucleotide rrs sequence of L498
was aligned with the nine rrs alleles identified for these
four species (Figure 3). This demonstrated a total of three
polymorphic sites for the unidentified species, as follows:
A at position 175, T at position 219, and A at position
366. The presence of T at position 219 was unique in the
entire rrs database for all 14 species, while the presence of
an A at position 175 was observed in multiple species
(Figure 1). The presence of an A at position 366 was
observed in one of the three rrs alleles of L. kirschneri, and
in three intermediate Leptospira species (L. fainei,
L. inadai and L. broomii) (Figure 1).
The patient from whom this sample was collected presented with 3 days of fever, headache, conjunctival suffusion and calf tenderness. Paired serum samples were taken
on days 2 and 10 after the onset of symptoms from this
patient. MAT was negative (MAT titer < 1:50) against a
panel of reference isolates of the following serovar:
Pomona, Hardjo, Tarassovi, Grippotyphosa, Celledoni,
Copenhageni, Australis, Pyrogenes, Canicola, Hebdomadis,
Mini, Sarmin, Autmnalis, Cynopteri, Ballum, Bataviae,
Djasiman, Javanica, Panama, Shermani and Mwalok. The
patient became afebrile eight hours after the initiation of
doxycycline, made an uneventful recovery, and was discharged home three days after admission. Doxycycline was
continued to complete a 7-day course. The patient had
made a full clinical recovery when seen in clinic for the
day 10 serum sample.

included a distinct subset at the species level compared
with Leptospira spp. associated with culture-positive
infection. The driver for this was to explain why the
majority of patients with PCR-positive leptospirosis in
our setting are culture-negative. Demonstration of a specific culture-negative sub-set would have opened the way
to develop alternative culture media and potentially
increase the sensitivity of culture, but we found no such
differences.
There are several alternative explanations for PCR-positive but culture-negative leptospirosis. The patient may
have received an effective antimicrobial drug but may not
have cleared non-viable organism by the time that the
blood sample was taken. We do not have information on
antimicrobial consumption by our study patients prior to
hospital admission, and this remains an important possibility. Leptospira spp. might also perish in the blood collection tube prior to laboratory culture due to fluctuations in
ambient temperature or other factors, and are fastidious
bacteria with highly defined growth requirements. Timing
of the sample after the onset of symptoms is also important; we have reported previously for the same group of
patients that those who were PCR-positive and culturepositive had a shorter duration of illness prior to sampling
than those who were PCR-positive but culture-negative
[6]. Two patients were culture-positive but PCR-negative.
A possible explanation is that this resulted from a

L498 was compared with that of four species (nine different rrs alleles) with which it genetically clusters.

stochastic effect associated with a sample containing a low
bacterial concentration; i.e., by chance, the aliquot taken
from the sample for culture contained organisms but the
sample used for DNA extraction did not. An alternative
explanation is laboratory error or contamination.
This study has several limitations. The patient group
studied were those people who were sufficiently unwell to
require hospitalization, and so the findings cannot be generalized to cases with milder clinical manifestations.
Furthermore, the characteristics of Leptospira spp. and the
study population in Thailand may be significantly different
to that in other settings.
The genetic diversity of rrs described here has been
noted previously during a study in which a 452-nucleotide region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (defined
with reference to rrs2 of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130) was used as one of six
loci of a genotyping scheme devised by Ahmed et al.
[10]. This region maps to positions 103 to 554 of the rrs
gene of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601, and
includes the 443-nucleotide rrs region used in our study
(position 89 to 531). The number of alleles and polymorphic sites in 9 pathogenic and 5 intermediate Leptospira spp. were identical for the 443-nucleotide and
452-nucleotide regions. Ahmed et al. evaluated 120
strains belonging to 6 pathogenic species (L. interrogans,
L. noguchii, L. kirschneri, L. santarosai, L. alexanderi,
and L. borgpetersenii), which were separated by rrs2 into
29 different alleles containing 20 polymorphic sites. This
suggests that alleles of Leptospira rrs arise frequently
and could occur through homologous recombination
within or between closely related species rather than by
mutation [16,17].
Gene sequence analysis represents an important tool for
the delineation of Leptospira species. The genes used previously in such analyses have included 16S rRNA (rrs)
[18-29], DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) [26,30-32] and RNA
polymerase subunit B (rpoB) [33,34]. An important question is what constitutes a new Leptospira species based on
genetic differences at one or a small number of genetic
loci. At one end of the spectrum, a Leptospira species may
be clearly genetically distinct from other members of the
genus based on a large degree of genetic diversity. Nucleotide distances between pathogenic and intermediate species evaluated in this study were more that 4% when
compared using the nearly entire rrs gene (> 3% based on
the 443-nucleotide rrs region). However, defining a species
based on genetic differences at a small number of genetic
loci is problematic. For example, two closely related Leptospira species (L. interrogans and L. kirschneri) have just
1 to 4 nucleotide differences when compared using the
nearly entire gene, and 1 to 3 nucleotide differences based
on the 443-nucleotide rrs region. Similarly, the sequence

difference between the closely related L. inadai and L.
broomii is 3 nucleotides based on the nearly entire gene
and a single nucleotide based on the 443-nucleotide rrs
region. This is equivalent to the number of differences
observed within L. noguchii alone, which using our 443nucleotide rrs region defined 5 polymorphic sites and 3
alleles. The unidentified species in this study (L498) was
most closely related to L. borgpetersenii and had 3 nucleotide differences based on the 443-nucleotide rrs region. It
remains to be seen whether this is a new species or a variant of an existing one. The lack of a live bacterial culture
in this case precludes further characterization using additional tools such as DNA hybridization.

Conclusions
The PCR assay described here was designed to speciate
Leptospira spp. associated with culture-negative infection, and increases the number of cases for whom the
causative species can be identified. This assay also represents a potentially useful epidemiological tool in settings
where culture is not available. It is not clear why culture-negative leptospirosis is so common among our
patient population, but the ready availability of over the
counter antibiotics and the frequency with which these
are purchased represents a plausible explanation that
could be tested in future studies.
