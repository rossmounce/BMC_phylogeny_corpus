Abstract
Background: Anorexia nervosa carries the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Even the most
critically ill anorexic patients may present with normal ‘standard’ laboratory values, underscoring the need for a
new sensitive biomarker. The complement cascade, a major component of innate immunity, represents a driving
force in the pathophysiology of multiple inflammatory disorders. The role of complement in anorexia nervosa
remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of complement C3 levels, the
extent of complement activation and of complement hemolytic activity in serum, as potential new biomarkers for
the severity of anorexia nervosa.
Patients and methods: This was a prospective cohort study on 14 patients with severe anorexia nervosa, as
defined by a body mass index (BMI) <14 kg/m2. Serum samples were obtained in a biweekly manner until hospital
discharge. A total of 17 healthy subjects with normal BMI values served as controls. The serum levels of
complement C3, C3a, C5a, sC5b-9, and of the 50% hemolytic complement activity (CH50) were quantified and
correlated with the BMIs of patients and control subjects.
Results: Serum C3 levels were significantly lower in patients with anorexia nervosa than in controls (median 3.7
(interquartile range (IQR) 2.5-4.9) vs 11.4 (IQR 8.9-13.7, P <0.001). In contrast, complement activation fragments and
CH50 levels were not significantly different between the two groups. There was a strong correlation between
index C3 levels and BMI (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.71, P <0.001).
Conclusions: Complement C3 serum levels may represent a sensitive new biomarker for monitoring the severity of
disease in anorexia nervosa. The finding from this preliminary pilot study will require further investigation in future
prospective large-scale multicenter trials.

Introduction
Anorexia nervosa occurs in an estimated 0.9% of women
and 0.3% of men in the US alone [1]. The treatment
course is usually lengthy and challenging due to potentially life-threatening medical complications that can
affect almost every organ system [2]. Such impediments
result in the highest death rates (approximately 5%) of
any psychiatric disorder [2,3]. In fact, the overall mortality rate in anorexia nervosa patients is about 10 times
higher than the expected mortality for age-matched
women in the US [2,3]. Published guidelines support
hospitalization for medical stabilization when patients
with anorexia nervosa weigh less than 70% of their

calculated ideal body weight (IBW), have severe bradycardia (≤50 beats/min), severe hypotension, or life threatening electrolyte abnormalities [2,4,5]. In this
population of young, usually otherwise healthy patients
with pure food restriction, normal serum albumin levels
frequently mask the severity of their serious medical
condition [6,7]. A recent analysis of patients with severe
anorexia nervosa (median body mass index 13.1 kg/m2)
admitted for medical stabilization showed that most
patients, despite profoundly low body weight, have normal laboratory values on admission, with the exception
of lymphopenia and anemia due to starvation-mediated
bone marrow suppression [2,4]. However over the
course of the early weeks of refeeding, nearly half developed hypoglycemia, three-quarters showed abnormal
liver function most likely related to starvation-induced
autophagy, 83% showed abnormal bone density, nearly

half developed refeeding hypophosphatemia, and 92%
were hypothermic [8,9]. Despite the significant abnormalities and the extent of bone marrow suppression, these
critically ill patients do not manifest significant inflammatory or infectious processes. Outcome measures of
medical stability draw from a combination of factors
including improvement of standard laboratory values,
ingestion of adequate calories to begin weight restoration, and resolution of comorbidities [4,10,11]. To date,
no appropriate biomarker exists to monitor treatment
success or progression of disease [4,12].
Complement represents one of the phylogenetically
oldest cascade systems. As an important effector of the
innate immune response, the complement system represents the ‘first line of defense’ against invading pathogens [13]. Although of beneficial intention, excessive
complement activation has been associated with detrimental effects related to ‘innocent bystander’ host cell
injury [14]. Disproportionate complement activation in
sepsis, for example, appears to play a key role in the
pathophysiology of neutrophil dysfunction, coagulopathy, apoptotic events and cardiomyopathy [15,16]. There
is relative paucity of data on the role of complement
proteins in anorexia nervosa in the literature and no
correlations were made between complement levels and
the severity of disease. Moreover, anorexia nervosa has
traditionally been viewed as an illness with malnourishment, but devoid of a prominent inflammatory component, as shown by surprisingly normal albumin levels
[6,7].
The present study was designed to assess complement
activation in patients with severe anorexia nervosa, and
to determine whether complement serum levels may
represent a useful marker for determining and monitoring the severity of disease. We hypothesized that anorexia nervosa results in complement activation and
consumption of complement C3, the central component
of all complement activation pathways.

Patients and methods
Setting

The Acute Comprehensive Urgent Treatment of Eating
disorders (ACUTE) center at Denver Health Medical
Center is a five-bed, multidisciplinary center that cares
for the largest number of critically ill anorexic patients
in the country. It serves patients too medically compromised to initiate or continue treatment in a psychiatrically based eating disorder program. Therefore, the
ACUTE center is a medical stabilization unit treating
the most seriously ill anorexic patients. Although hospitalization is recommended for anorexic patients with a
body mass index (BMI) under 14 kg/m 2 , the ACUTE
center’s patients have a mean BMI of 12.6 kg/m2, making them a uniquely ill patient population. It is worth

Page 2 of 6

noting that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for
anorexia nervosa defines this illness as having a BMI
<17.5. Thus the patients in this study have extremely
severe forms of anorexia nervosa. Upon primary medical
stabilization, patients are transferred to a psychiatrically
based inpatient eating disorder program further treatment and follow-up.
Patients and controls

The present study was designed as a prospective cohort
study. Prior to study initiation, approval by the Institutional Review Board was obtained. Patients admitted to
the ACUTE center with a diagnosis of severe anorexia
nervosa were consented and enrolled into the study (n =
14). Blood samples were obtained every 2 weeks and
demographic data, routine laboratory parameters (complete blood counts, electrolytes and minerals, hepatic
function tests), and body weight were assessed in standard fashion until discharge. Patients provided blood
samples only during their hospitalization so patients did
not contribute the same number of samples to the
study. A healthy volunteer group of 17 individuals
served as the control group for this study and blood
samples were obtained once.
Blood sampling

Whole blood was sampled via venipuncture of the anticubital vein. Serum tubes were used in all cases, and were
immediately put on ice. Serum was collected after clotting and centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min at 4°C. To
avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, samples were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until further analysis.
Protein measurements

The total protein content of serum samples was quantified using BCA protein measurement (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were diluted 1:100 in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) prior to incubation and spectrophotometric assessment. Bovine serum albumin
(Thermo Scientific) was used to generate a standard
curve.
Complement hemolytic activity and serum levels

Serum samples were thawed and processed immediately.
Repetitive freeze-thaw cycles were avoided to minimize
in vitro complement activation. The following commercially available ELISA kits were used strictly according
to the manufacturer’s protocol: MicroVue CH50 Eq EIA
kit (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA; sample dilution per
manufacturer’s protocol); C3 fixed complement preceptor ELISA kit (Bachem, San Carlos, CA, USA; 1:20 sample dilution); MicroVue C3a EIA kit (Quidel; 1:150

Flierl et al. Annals of General Psychiatry 2011, 10:16

sample dilution); human complement component C5a
ELISA (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 1:20 sample dilution); MicroVue sC5b-9 EIA kit (Quidel). Obtained concentrations were protein adjusted (concentration/mg
total protein) in order to address differences in total
protein levels between anorexia nervosa patients and
healthy volunteers.
Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics of the study participants are
described with mean and standard deviation (SD) or
percentages. Complement levels are expressed as medians with interquartile ranges because they were nonnormally distributed (Anderson-Darling test). Comparisons between the anorexia nervosa patients and healthy
volunteers were analyzed with an unpaired t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to
determine association between BMI and complements.
A generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis was
used to determine the relationship between BMI and
complement level over time for the anorexia nervosa
patients. PROC GENMOD was used since it accounts
for the repeated measures within a patient, allows missing data, and does not require the response to be normally distributed. Differences were considered
significant when P <0.05. All analyses were conducted in
SAS v.9.1. (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Patient demographics

The study consisted of two cohorts. In all, 14 anorexia
nervosa patients were compared with 17 healthy controls
(Table 1). In the anorexia group, 79% of the patients
were women, with a mean age of 32.4 years (SD 12.8).
The healthy controls had similar characteristics. At the
time of admission, the anorexia group had a mean initial

Page 3 of 6

body mass index of 13.6 ± 1.5 kg/m2 compared with 22.2
± 2.6 kg/m2 in the control group (P <0.001). The initial
percentage of ideal body weight in the anorexia group
was 64.5 ± 7.6%, which was 40% lower than the healthy
controls (P <0.001). The serum total protein was 61.9 ±
8.2 mg/ml in the anorexia group compared with 73.7 ±
9.6 in the control group, P = 0.001. Thus, we adjusted for
this baseline difference in protein when comparing complement activation between the two groups. The mean
admission albumin level for the anorexia nervosa patients
was within normal limits (3.6 ± 0.7 g/dl, normal range 35.3 g/dl). Anorexic patients were followed for a mean of
43 ± 8.8 days. No patient had evidence of systemic infection, malignancy, shock, vascular disease, or rheumatologic disease. The peripheral blood cell counts in the
anorexia cohort are shown in Table 2.
Complement hemolytic activity and serum levels

Complement activation was determined in serum samples
from anorexia nervosa patients (n = 14) obtained on
admission and compared to the healthy control cohort (n
= 17). Complement analysis is depicted in Table 3. Serum
levels of C3 were threefold lower in patients with anorexia
nervosa than in controls (median 3.7 (interquartile range
(IQR) 2.5-4.9) vs 11.4 (8.9-13.7), P <0.001). The serum
levels of complement activation fragments (C3a, C5a,
C5b-9) and the extent of 50% hemolytic complement
activity (CH50) were not significantly different between
the two groups. In contrast, C3 levels were strongly correlated with index BMI (Spearman correlation coefficient =
0.71, P <0.001; Figure 1). Complement C3 levels did not
correlate with BMI in the anorexia group alone (n = 14,
Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.36, P = 0.20).

refeeding and analyzed for levels of CH50, C3, C3a, C5a
and sC5b-9. Each patient provided between one and six
sets of laboratory results depending on the length of
their hospitalization. Eight patients (57%) had multiple
blood samples and were included in the longitudinal
analysis. As the patients became medically stabilized
during their admission, BMI increases over time were
not statistically correlated with C3 changes.

Discussion
This study provides first evidence of significantly
decreased complement C3 levels in patients with severe
anorexia nervosa, compared to healthy control subjects.
There was a strong correlation between index C3 levels
and patients’ and controls’ BMI values (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.71, P <0.001), suggesting that
serum C3 levels may represent a clinically relevant
serum marker reflecting the severity of disease, and
potentially serving as a guide for monitoring the refeeding process. That is, in patients with anorexia nervosa
and severely low body weight, in whom basic laboratory
tests are often normal, low serum C3 levels can confirm
biochemical evidence of severe illness. It is reasonable
that serum C3 levels did not correlate with BMI in the
anorexia group alone, reflective of the fact that a
‘threshold’ of severe illness from anorexia has been
crossed at these profoundly low body weights, which
occasioned the low C3 level. The fact that serum C3
levels did not statistically correlate with weight restoration over the course of treatment may have a complex
explanation, and thus restoration of non-edematous

weight remains the best marker of physiologic recovery
in anorexia nervosa. In contrast to the findings on C3
concentrations, serum levels of complement activation
fragments (C3a, C5a, C5b-9) and the extent of complement hemolytic activity (CH50) did not significantly
correlate with the patients’ BMIs. There are several
potential explanations for this negative finding. First, a
recent study described direct cleavage of C5 via thrombin, thereby bypassing the traditional activation cascade
using C3 convertases or C5 convertases [13]. As a result,
C5a may be generated via thrombin-mediated coagulation abnormalities that have been documented in anorexia nervosa patients [17,18]. In addition, phacocytic
cells are able to directly cleave C5 and locally generate
C5a [19]. Maj and colleagues revealed that peripheral
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from anorexia nervosa patients exhibited significantly elevated levels of
activated intracellular G proteins, indicating increased
PBMC activity in these patients [20]. Thus, activated
PBMCs and neutrophils may further contribute to
alterations of C3a and C5a levels bypassing the traditional complement activation cascade.
There are few reports on complement activation in
anorexia nervosa available in the peer-reviewed literature, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s [21-23]. Wyatt
et al. published a series of five anorexia nervosa patients
and observed significantly decreased serum levels of
C1q, C2, C3, factor B, b leutenizing hormone (b-LH),
C3b inactivator, properdin, and C4 binding protein [22].
After initiation of alimentation, b-LH, C3b inactivator,
C3, and factor B rapidly returned to the normal range

(AN) and healthy controls.

in response to therapy [22]. In line with these findings,
Sigal and colleagues found low serum levels of complement proteins in anorexia nervosa patients [23]. A more
recent report evaluated several components of the complement cascade and analyzed the activities of the alternative complement activation pathways [24]. Serum
levels of C3, Factor B and D, hemolytic activity of the
alternative pathway, and the inhibitors H and I were
found to be low in anorexia patients and normalized
with weight gain [24]. In our current study, we determined low C3 levels in anorexic patients, which is in
line with those previous findings. However, while our
findings suggest complement consumption secondary to
increased activation in anorexic patients, Pomeroy and
colleagues concluded that low serum complement levels
were attributable to hypoproduction as opposed to
increased consumption, and that percentage of ideal
body weight, changes in body weight, and serum transferrin were each highly correlated with serum levels of
complement proteins [24]. These differences to our
findings may be due to the fact that Pomeroy and colleagues assessed functional capacity of the alternative
complement activation pathway exclusively, while our
study focused on complement activation via the classical
pathway (CH50) and complement activity further downstream (C3a, C5a, MAC). Moreover, Pomeroy et al.
failed to adjust their samples to total protein levels,
which may have resulted in variable protein concentrations. In the present study, anorexia nervosa patients
had significantly lower serum total protein levels than
healthy controls on admission (61.9 ± 2.2 mg/ml vs 73.7
± 2.3 mg/ml; P = 0.003) [24]. Nova and colleagues evaluated several biochemical markers in 14 anorexia nervosa patients and compared them to a healthy control
cohort of (n = 15) [25]. The authors reported

Page 5 of 6

significantly increased concentrations of C3 (and C4)
upon admission in anorexia nervosa patients [25]. At
the 1-year follow-up, C3 and C4 levels had returned to
levels comparable to the healthy control cohort. Nova et
al. also failed to adjust their measurements to total protein levels in their samples, which may account for the
differences observed.
Our study has several limitations. First, the low patient
numbers limit the power of our statistical analysis and
make our data vulnerable to a statistical type II error.
Therefore, our data do not allow for advocating complement serum levels as a new biomarker until definitively
proven in future large-scale prospective studies. Moreover, follow-up studies will have to determine during
which time frame complement levels return to healthy
control levels after initiation of refeeding protocols, and
whether complement serum levels may represent a valuable tool to monitor therapy success or failure in anorexia patients. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, our study
is the first to describe a full complement screening in
severely ill anorexia nervosa patients upon admission,
and to correlate complement levels with gain of body
weight as a function of time.

Conclusions
The complement system represents a crucial effector of
the acute phase response of innate immunity. Excessive
complement activation, however, has been implicated in
the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases
[14,16,26]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the increased
complement activation observed in anorexia nervosa
patients may be involved in the development of complications associated with severe anorexia nervosa. The
pharmacological complement blockade has been shown
to ameliorate the severity of numerous diseases, including sepsis [27], neuroinflammation [14,28], chest trauma
[29], and ischemia reperfusion injury [30]. Therefore, it
appears reasonable to hypothesize that the pharmacological blockade of the complement cascade or complement receptors may represent a future therapeutic
treatment strategy to reduce the incidence of anorexia
nervosa-associated complications. In conclusion, future
prospective large-scale studies will have to determine
the value of complement serum levels as potential biomarkers to monitor treatment success or failure in
patients with severe anorexia nervosa.
