Abstract
Background: Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health, safety, and economic
stability of populations. Many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists
of the pathogenic microorganisms relevant to their missions; however, the nomenclature for
biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is inexact. This ambiguity
can be a significant block to effective communication among the diverse communities that must deal
with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.
Results: We have developed a database known as the Microbial Rosetta Stone. The database
relates microorganism names, taxonomic classifications, diseases, specific detection and treatment
protocols, and relevant literature. The database structure facilitates linkage to public genomic
databases. This paper focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global
public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents.
Conclusion: The Microbial Rosetta Stone is available at http://www.microbialrosettastone.com/.
The database provides public access to up-to-date taxonomic classifications of organisms that cause
human diseases, improves the consistency of nomenclature in disease reporting, and provides
useful links between different public genomic and public health databases.

Background
Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health
and safety of the world's populations of humans, animals,
and plants. Infectious microorganisms include species of
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Many different

medical and governmental organizations have created
lists of the pathogenic microorganisms most relevant to
their missions. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an ever-changing
list of notifiable diseases, the National Institute of Allergy

and Infectious Disease (NIAID) lists agents with potential
for use in bioterrorist attacks, and the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains a list of critical human pathogens. Unfortunately, the nomenclature
for biological agents on these lists and pathogens
described in the literature is imprecise. Organisms are
often referred to using common names, alternative spellings, or out-dated or alternative names. Sometimes a disease rather than a particular organism is mentioned, and
often there may be multiple organisms or co-infections
capable of causing a particular disease. Not surprisingly,
this ambiguity poses a significant hurdle to communication among the diverse communities that must deal with
epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.
To facilitate comprehensive access to information on disease-causing organisms and toxins, we have developed a
database known as "The Microbial Rosetta Stone" that
uses a new data model and novel computational tools to
manage microbiological data [1,2]. This article focuses on
the information in the database for pathogens that impact
global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and
bioterrorist threat agents. It provides a compilation of
lists, taken from the database, of important and/or regulated biological agents from a number of agencies including HHS, the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), the CDC, the World Health Organization
(WHO), the NIAID, and other sources. We curated these
lists to include organism names that are consistent with
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) nomenclature and to provide sequence accession
numbers for genomic sequencing projects (if available).
Important synonyms or previously used names that identify the organisms are also shown. We have organized the
lists according to phylogenetic structure. This paper provides graphic representations of the phylogenetic relatedness of important pathogenic organisms.
The goal of the database is to provide an informative,
readily accessible, single location for basic information on
a broad range of important disease causing agents. The
database will help users to avoid the pitfalls of confusing
nomenclature and taxonomic relationships and allow
access to literature on in-depth studies. The database can
be accessed at http://www.microbialrosettastone.com/.

Results
The Microbial Rosetta Stone database was designed to link
genomic sequence data, taxonomic classification, and epidemiological information in a way that facilitates searches
and data updates. The intent is not to replace currently
available tools, like those available from NCBI, but
instead serve to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts.
One of the main goals of building this informatics infrastructure was to support the rapid determination of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/19

causative agent in the event of a bioterrorist action or
emergence of a previously unknown infectious disease.
This paper focuses on pathogenic organisms from several
broad categories. Those currently known to impact global
human health are monitored by a number of public
health organizations and United States governmental
agencies including the WHO [see Additional File 1] and
the CDC [see Additional File 2]. Important food and water
borne pathogens are listed in Additional File 3 [see Additional File 3]. Those agents responsible for emerging diseases are listed in Additional File 4 [see Additional File 4].
Pathogens considered high priority by the NIAID are
listed in Additional File 5 [see Additional File 5]. Agents
are listed that pose a high threat for bioterrorism [see
Additional File 6], biocrimes [see Additional File 7], or
have a high potential to be genetically manipulated [see
Additional File 8]. Human pathogens formally regulated
by the HHS are listed in Additional File 9 [see Additional
File 9] and animal pathogens monitored by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) are listed in Additional File 10 [see Additional File 10].
The organisms listed in the Additional Files are represented according to phylogenetic hierarchy in the figures.
The symbols used in the figures connect the organism
names back to one or more of the Additional Files, which
allows visualization of the fact that organisms are often
represented in multiple Additional Files. Figure 1 is the
symbols key. Figures 2 and 3 show the phylogenetic relationships of cellular life forms including bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, and the plants and animals that produce toxins,
Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic relationships of DNA
viruses, and Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the phylogenetic
relationships of RNA viruses.
For optimal utility, the genomic sequence data, taxonomic, and epidemiological information were linked in a
way that facilitates searches, data updates, and data curation. The Microbial Rosetta Stone system will serve as a
translator to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts
between other public databases and literature and, when
unable to resolve ambiguities, provide enough context for
users understand the nature of the ambiguities. The database provides links to literature on experimental protocols
for pathogen identification and to the genomic and biochemical information specific to a species, strain, or isolate. The data model and query tools are described in
detail in Hari et al. [1]. The following sections describe the
information and literature sources used to populate in the
database for globally important and emerging pathogens
and potential bioterrorist agents.

Important public health pathogens
In the developing world, nearly 90% of infectious disease
deaths are due to six diseases or disease processes: acute
respiratory infections, diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV, measles, and malaria [see Additional File 1] [3]. In both developing and developed nations, the leading cause of death
by a wide margin is acute respiratory disease [3-5]. In the
developing world, acute respiratory infections are attributed primarily to six bacteria: Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus
aureus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumonia,
and Chlamydia trachomatis [6]. These bacteria belong to
four different taxonomic classes and illustrate how similar
parasitic lifestyles can evolve in parallel within unrelated
bacterial species (Figure 2). Major viral causes of respiratory infections include respiratory syncytial virus (Figure
5), human parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (Figure 5), influenza viruses A and B (Figure 5), as well as some adenoviruses (Figure 4) [5,6].

The major causes of diarrhoeal disease in the developing
and developed world have significant differences due to
the great disparity of availability of pure food and water
and the general nutritional and health status of the populations. Important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the
developing world are those that tend to be epidemic, especially Vibrio cholera, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella

typhi [7]. These organisms are gammaproteobacteria (Figure 2) that use many different metabolic pathways to
ensure their survival in a wide range of environments. In
the United States there is a much lower incidence of diarrhoeal disease overall, and a relatively greater impact of
direct human-to-human infectious transmission. The
most important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the United
States are bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter
species, Clostridium difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella species (Figure 2); viruses,
such as Norwalk virus (Figure 6) and rotaviruses (Figure
7); and parasites such as Cryptosporidium parvum,
Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, while microsporidia are responsible for a smaller
number of cases (Figure 3).
Infectious disease agents important to the public health in
the U.S. are monitored by the CDC and listed in Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2]. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the
list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health
departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new
diseases emerge, the notifiable disease list changes. The
list provides links to case definitions of each disease,
including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In cases
where the etiological agent was not listed or was

Bacterial pathogens
Bacterial pathogens. Bacterial phylogeny is based on work by Hugenholtz et al. [69]. Bacterial phyla are shown on the leaves,
with the Firmicutes and the Proteobacteria subdivided to the class level (taxa are shown in italics). Their phylogeny is further
broken down to the order level with the use of smaller branches. These two phyla account for roughly three quarters of the
described infectious bacterial species (with the noticeable exception of deltaproteobacteria pathogens). Proteobacteria contain
both important plant and animal pathogens. Proteobacterial plant pathogens are not clustered, but are observed in alpha, beta,
and gamma subdivisions. Some plant and animal pathogen species share the same genus classification (e.g. Ralstonia and Pseudomonas), and for at least one species, Burkholderia cepacia, different subspecies are plant and human pathogens. Of the 20 bacterial phyla currently recognized in the NCBI taxonomy, thirteen are not present in Figure 2 due to the absence of noteworthy
pathogens. Some of these missing phyla are relatively important, like the Cyanobacteria, but most of the remaining phyla are
restricted to a handful of species and/or environmental niches. Also of interest is the relative weight of the infectious agents
within their respective phylum: While virtually all Spirochaetes and Chlamydiae constitute potential infectious agents due to
their parasitic lifestyle, the phylum Actinobacteria has few pathogens relative to the overall diversity of the phylum. It should be
cautioned that our current view of bacterial diversity is biased towards cultivatable organisms, which represent a small fraction
of bacterial diversity [69]. Therefore, this compilation represents the well-recognized infectious bacterial agents, but should in
no way be considered exhaustive or complete.

Eukaryotic pathogens
Eukaryotic pathogens. Eukaryotic pathogen life forms are clearly dominated by the fungi and protists. Within the Fungi, the
phylum Ascomycota has many human, animal, and plant pathogens and is a major source of toxins. Protist species are responsible for globally important diseases such as the malaria-causing Plasmodium species and the Leishmania and Trypanosoma species
that cause significant mortality in the developing world. The eukaryotic phylogeny tree is based on ribosomal and housekeeping
gene sequence analysis [70], but different taxonomy levels are simultaneously represented as the topology has not yet been
reliably determined.

unspecific (i.e. Brucella spp.), further research was done to
determine an etiological agent and this information is in
Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2].
Food-borne pathogens
Each year in the United States, there are approximately 76
million cases of food-borne illness, including 325,000
hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths [8,9]. In an estimated 2
to 3% of these cases, chronic sequelae develop. These
sequelae include renal disease, cardiovascular diseases,
gastrointestinal disorders, neural disorders, and autoim-

mune disease [10]. The estimated cost of food-borne illness in the United States is $23 billion annually [8].
Mishandling of food is believed to be responsible for 85%
of all outbreaks of food-borne disease in developed
nations, primarily due to a lack of education [8,11-13].
Food-borne pathogens [see Additional File 3] are also
important because they represent one of the largest
sources of emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This is
due in part to the administration of sub-therapeutic doses
of antibiotics to food-producing animals to enhance
growth. For example, certain strains of Salmonella show

resistance to eight or more antibiotics [14]. Studies have
shown that antibiotic resistance in Salmonella cannot be
traced to antibiotic use in humans, suggesting that antibiotic use in animals is the primary cause of resistance [15].
While much is known about the major microbes responsible for diseases, there are still many undiagnosed cases
of infectious disease. It has been estimated that as many as
three-fifths of the deaths from acute gastroenteritis per
year in the United States are caused by an infectious
organism of unknown etiology [16]. Four of the major
causes of food-borne infections (Campylobacter jejuni,
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and
Cyclospora cayetanensis, Figure 2) were only recently recognized as causes of food-borne illness [16].

Emerging infectious disease
Diseases that have recently appeared or that are growing
in incidence are classified as emerging infectious diseases
[see Additional File 4]. Emerging infectious organisms
often encounter hosts with no prior exposure and thus
represent a novel challenge to the host's immune system.
Morse [17] identified six general factors in emergence of
infectious disease: ecological changes, human demographics and behavior, international travel, technology
and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and
breakdown in public health measures. A comprehensive
review by Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse [18] identified
zoonotic status as one of the strongest risk factors for disease emergence. Roughly 75% of emerging pathogens are

Single-stranded negative strand RNA viruses
Single-stranded negative strand RNA viruses. The common origin of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships as
indicated on this chart are based on an extensive analysis of their RNA-dependent RNA- or DNA-polymerases (C.M. manuscript in preparation). The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [73].
Virtually all known branches of ssRNA(-) viruses harbor pathogens and thus are represented in this panel. Only the rhabdoviridae family harbors both animal and plant pathogens. Particularly noteworthy are the deadly Ebola and Influenza viruses, the latter has claimed tens of millions of human lives in the past century.

zoonotic, and zoonoses are twice as likely to be considered emerging as non-zoonoses.
Zoonoses are a special class of pathogens as they co-evolve
with the reservoir host, not with humans. Although not
always the case, when zoonotic pathogens infect humans
they have a tendency to cause severe disease, much like a
commensal microorganism that infects unusual areas of
the body [19]. Zoonoses can be broken down into two
basic groups: those spread by direct contact with the

infected animal and those spread via an intermediate vector [20]. Zoonoses can infect humans through many
vectors. Members of the genus Hantavirus are spread by
rats [21], West Nile virus by mosquitoes [22], and Campylobacter species by family pets [23]. In 2003, there was an
outbreak of monkeypox (Figure 4) in the Midwestern
United States, which was attributed to the importation of
pet animals [24]. Viruses, protozoa, and bacteria can all be
transmitted either directly or via a vector. However, these
groups are clearly differentiated on a phylogenetic level.

Single-stranded positive strand RNA viruses
Single-stranded positive strand RNA viruses. The Togaviridae and Flaviviridae, and to a lesser extent the Coronaviridae and
Picornaviridae, families are the most prominent human pathogens. Important plant viruses affect major cereal grains causing
severe crop damages worldwide and affecting the nutrition of entire populations.

All zoonotic members of the families Flaviviridae and
Togaviridae (Figure 6) are transmitted via an intermediate
vector, while all zoonotic members of the families Arenaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Filoviridae (Figure 5) are
transmitted through direct contact. Almost all zoonotic
proteobacteria are transmitted through direct contact as
well [20]. Of all the agents infectious to humans, a majority are zoonotic in origin [18].

to be proven, it is suspected that severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (Figure
6), also resulted from a species jump [26]. For many years,
Robert G. Webster has studied the importance of
influenza viruses in wild birds as a major reservoir of
influenza viruses and has clarified their role in the evolution of pandemic strains that infect humans and lower
animals [27].

Several viruses responsible for human epidemics have
made a transition from animal host to human host and
are now transmitted from human to human. Human
immunodeficiency virus (Figure 7), responsible for the
AIDS epidemic, is one example [25]. Although it has yet

Intriguingly, it appears that whenever a virus (or any other
pathogen or pest) is eradicated another appears to fill the
environmental niche. For example, in regions where the
wild-type poliovirus (Figure 6) has been eliminated, nonpolio enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks

Retroid viruses and double-stranded RNA viruses. The most prominent include the two HIV viruses and the Hepatitis B
virus, and the main family of double-stranded RNA viruses, the Orbiviridae. The latter family is an example of a virus family that
includes both animal and plant pathogens. The plant pathogens primarily infect rice cultures.

of paralytic disease that clinically exhibit symptoms of
poliomyelitis. The most common non-polio enteroviral
causes of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) are human coxsackieviruses A7 and A9 and human enterovirus 71 (Figure 6). The poliovirus epidemics that emerged in the mid
19th century are now believed to have arisen not due to a
change in the properties of the virus, but due to an
improvement of public sanitation and personal hygiene,
which delayed the acquisition of enteric virus infection
from infancy to childhood. Since maternal antibodies
protected infants, they usually underwent silent immunizing infections, whereas when older children were infected
they more often suffered paralytic poliomyelitis [28].

Economically important plant and animal pathogens
Proteobacteria are important plant and animal pathogens, and it is interesting that proteobacterial plant pathogens are not clustered on the phylogenetic tree, but are
observed in alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions (Figure
2). Some plant and animal pathogen species share the
same genus classification (e.g. Ralstonia and Pseudomonas),
and for at least one species, Burkholderia cepacia, different
subspecies are plant and human pathogens. In viruses,
plant and animal pathogens are generally found in distinct families, with the notable exception of the families
Rhabdoviridae (Figure 5) and Reoviridae (Figure 7) that
harbor both. Most plant-specific virus families are not
shown in Figures 4,5,6,7, but for rice alone at least ten

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:19

unrelated virus species have been reported to infect cultures worldwide. The overall economical effect of plant
pathogens has been estimated to reduce crop production
by one fifth [29]. Foot-and-mouth disease almost
destroyed the beef industry in the United Kingdom and
losses were very high. Bird flu in South East Asia affected
the poultry industry severely. Influenza A is a bird virus
that jumped from birds via pigs to humans and as a
human pathogen has a large impact on the economy [30].
Bioterrorism and biocrimes
Bioterrorism can be defined as an attack or threat of an
attack using bioweapons on humans and/or their assets to
create fear, to intimidate, to inflict harm, and/or affect
economic well being. Such acts may be motivated by
political, religious, ecological, or other ideological objectives. Any microorganism or toxin capable of causing
disease or harm in humans, plants, or animals has the
potential for illicit use and thus the list of potential agents
could be vast. However, not all organisms or toxins make
useful biological weapons. Displaying biological weapons
from a phylogenetic perspective provides insight into how
organisms that have been historically used as biowarfare
agents are related to important human and agricultural
pathogens and also provides insight into other similar
organisms that might be considered as weapons in the
future. The properties that make organisms amenable for
use as biological weapons have been discussed extensively
[31-39]. The most important features include: 1) accessibility; 2) consistent ability to cause death or disability; 3)
culturability; 4) possibility for large scale production; 5)
stability and ability to retain potency during transport and
storage; 6) delivery potential; 7) stability and retention of
potency after dissemination; and 8) infectivity and toxicity [39].

The infectious agents considered by the NIAID to have
high potential for bioterror use are listed in Additional
File 5 [see Additional File 5]. Validated and potential bioweapons agents are listed in Additional File 6 [see Additional File 6]. Agents that have been used to commit
biocrimes [2] are in Additional File 7 [see Additional File
7]. The pathogens regulated by the HHS and the USDA are
shown in Additional File 9 [see Additional File 9] and
Additional file 10 [see Additional File 10], respectively. In
addition to infectious microbes, toxins derived from biological sources are contained on these lists. We identified
the biological source of each toxin, and listed the source
organism in the Additional File containing the toxin.
All 11 regulated toxins can be found on the HHS Select
Agent list [see Additional File 9] and five are also regulated
by the USDA [see Additional File 10]. The regulated toxins
(four small molecules and seven peptides or proteins) are
produced by a wide variety of organisms: five are pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/19

duced by bacteria [40-42], two by fungi [43,44], two by
plants [45,46], one by an animal [47], and one by a protist
[48]. The bacteria that produce toxins are indicated in Figure 2 and the eukaryotic toxin producers are shown in Figure 3. The conotoxins are a collection of five families of
related peptide toxins produced by the various species of
snails in the genus Conus [47]. The two fungal toxins,
diacetoxyscirpenol and T-2 toxin, are produced by multiple species of the genus Fusarium [43,44]. Of the five regulated bacterial toxins, four are peptides or proteins and
tetrodotoxin [49] is a small molecule. Tetrodotoxin is produced by a variety of gammaproteobacteria that colonize
the puffer fish [50]. These toxins are relevant both due to
concern that they may cause outbreaks of disease through
accidental food contamination and because they are
potential bioweapons. According to the CDC [51], an
average of 110 cases of botulism, caused by a bacterial
toxin (Figure 2), are reported each year. Interestingly,
numbers of cases of food-borne and infant botulism have
not changed significantly in recent years, but instances of
wound-botulism have increased primarily due to the use
of black-tar heroin, especially in California. Ricin is a
toxin produced by the plant Ricinus communis (Figure 3)
[46]. When prepared as a weapon, there are three methods
of delivery: ingestion, injection, or inhalation [41]. One of
the most famous documented uses of ricin was in the
assassination of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian defector who
died three days after being shot with a ricin pellet [41,52].
Organisms with high potential for genetic engineering
Pathogens that can be genetically manipulated [see Additional File 8] represent a unique bioterrorist threat, particularly as technology to genetically alter microbes becomes
more commonplace. For the purposes of this work,
viruses considered as having a high potential danger for
bioterrorist engineering were derived from the literature
reports and from the authors' judgment balancing the
considerations of terror potential with the technical difficulty of use.

DNA viruses (Figure 4) with large genomes can be manipulated in culture, and are susceptible to engineering
events such as insertion of genes not normally present in
viral genomes. For example, the entire orthopoxvirus
genus of the poxvirus family is considered to have high
potential for bioengineering because of a much-publicized paper that describes the engineering of an orthopox
member, ectromelia virus, to express mouse interleukin-4,
resulting in a virus with extraordinary virulence [53].
Another member of the orthopoxvirus genus, vaccinia
virus, is commonly used in molecular biology research
and is extensively used in vaccines and vaccine research
[54-57]. Thus, because they are highly infectious, will tolerate inserted genes, and can be manipulated easily in culture, poxviruses must be considered high-risk agents for

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:19

acts of bioengineering. Mutations to create vaccine- and
drug-resistant strains are also possible in other largegenome DNA viruses. Adeno-associated viruses are small
DNA viruses that are members of the family Parvoviridae.
They are satellite viruses that depend upon the presence of
their helper DNA viruses, including members of the families Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae, for replication. Like
vaccinia virus, adeno-associated viruses have been used
extensively as vectors for gene therapy, and therefore
represent a risk for genetic modification and subsequent
terrorist use.
RNA-genome viruses are naturally more resistant to insertion of genes, but can be made resistant to drugs and
potentially even to vaccines by introduction of mutations.
Most critically, RNA viruses may be created in the laboratory by total chemical synthesis to generate active virus
particles or reconstituted from cloned DNA. Total chemical synthesis was demonstrated recently for poliovirus
(Figure 6) [58]. Since this publication in 2002, the technology to chemically synthesize viruses has advanced
substantially. Chemical synthesis of RNA viruses would
eliminate the need for the bioterrorist to obtain stock cultures and would allow creation of any wild-type or mutant
strain of virtually any virus. Other positive-strand RNA
viruses (Figure 6) that have been reconstituted from
cloned DNA samples include Kunjin virus [59], human
rhinovirus [60], foot-and-mouth disease virus [61], transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a coronavirus [62,63], all
three genera of the family Flaviviridae [64], and a variety of
plant and insect viruses [65,66]. Thus, the positivestranded viruses must be considered a high-risk area for
bioengineering, where the relative risk for each virus must
be considered roughly equivalent to the terrorist potential
inherent to the virus.
Negative-strand RNA viruses (Figure 5) can also be reconstituted by total chemical synthesis or from cloned
genomic DNA by a reverse genetics approach [67]. Many
negative-strand RNA viruses, including ebolaviruses, Lake
Victoria marburgvirus, Hantaan virus and Lassa virus, are
important human pathogens and potential bioterrorist
agents. Influenza virus A is a particularly noteworthy negative-strand RNA virus due to its potential to cause pandemic disease, the availability of stock cultures of many
strains, and the potential for total chemical synthesis by
reverse genetics techniques [68].
For bacteria, if virulence factors have previously been
modified successfully in a species, that species was considered to have a high potential for bioengineering and was
included on the chart. However, numerous other methods for engineering bacterial genomes exist. Bacterial
genomes consist of one or more chromosomes and additional genetic information may exist in the form of plas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/19

mids. Plasmids replicate independently of the
chromosomal DNA and can be transferred between bacteria through transformation. Genes encoding virulence factors may be found in either chromosomes or plasmids. In
one example of an early bioengineering event, the selective growth of an antibiotic-sensitive species with an antibiotic-resistant species in the presence of the antibiotic
resulted in transference of resistance. Current techniques
allow for the splicing of genes encoding virulence factors
from one species followed by insertion into another.
However, the complexity of the bacterial genome makes it
difficult to successfully transfer a gene with a high rate of
expression.

Conclusion
This manuscript provides a visualization of the results
obtained from use of the Microbial Rosetta Stone Database, a database that uses a new data model and novel
computational tools to synthesize information on important human, animal, and plant pathogens [1]. Information on critical pathogens and diseases has been collected
from many sources. Organism names from all lists were
converted to NCBI species names and diseases were linked
to particular pathogens, which facilitated computational
analysis and linkage to public genomic databases. This
database should facilitate access to information on disease-causing organisms and toxins. The database can be
accessed at http://www.microbialrosettastone.com/.

Methods
Agent lists were collected from various sources as
described in more detail for each Additional File below.
Government agency lists (Additional Files 1, 2, 5, 9, and
10) were taken directly from the specified agencies, while
additional tables were compiled using cited literature.
Organism names from all lists were converted to NCBI
species names. This included changes from species synonyms to NCBI-accepted nomenclature and expansion
from Genus to Genus species (e.g. Shigella to Shigella dysenteriae or Shigella sonnei) to represent the most important
species (when known). Where possible, disease names
were associated with the name of the most predominant
organism that causes the disease. The Additional Files
contain taxonomic information, the NCBI name of the
agent and any well-known synonyms, and accession numbers for the complete genome of each agent (if available).
Names of the infectious agents listed in the Additional
Files were placed in tree-structure drawings shown in the
figures that display the biological relatedness of the organisms. Cellular life forms were organized according to currently accepted phylogenetic relationships. Bacterial
phylogeny (Figure 2) is based on work by Hugenholtz et
al. [69]. The eukaryotic phylogeny tree (Figure 3) is based
on ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequence analysis

Page 11 of 17

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:19

[70]. The branching order presented in Figure 3 should be
considered tentative as the on-going recognition of additional protist lineages is likely to alter the topology of the
eukaryotic tree in the near future [71]. The phylogeny of
DNA viruses (Figure 4) was derived primarily from the
work of Iyer, Aravind & Koonin [72]. The common origin
of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships (Figures
5,6,7) is based on an extensive analysis of their RNAdependent RNA- or DNA-polymerase (manuscript in
preparation). The RNA virus phylogenetic trees were created using maximum parsimony on protein sequences.
The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is for now
left unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [73].
The symbol key is shown in Figure 1 and symbols are used
in the other figures to link the pathogens in the figures to
Additional Files.
The agents listed in Additional File 1 [see Additional File
1] were taken from a list maintained by the WHO. The
WHO tracks the occurrence of morbidity and mortality of
global infectious diseases. Because of the great disparity in
infectious disease prevalence between developed and
developing nations, the WHO divides the world into
demographically developed nations (including the
United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and nations of the
former Soviet Union) and demographically developing
nations (including India, China, other Asian nations,
Pacific island nations, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East) [3]. The WHO lists leading causes of death
worldwide by disease categories. The disease can be
caused by multiple diverse organisms or co-infections of
different organisms, as is the case for acute respiratory disease, or by specific organisms, such as acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or tuberculosis. In the former
case, we identified the most prominent organisms responsible for the disease for display in Additional File 1.
The CDC-notifiable-disease list represents those diseases
that offer the greatest threat to public health in the United
States. Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2] lists the
agents on this list. There are no set criteria for inclusion on
the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the
CDC in cooperation with state health departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new diseases emerge, the
notifiable disease list changes. An up-to-date version of
the list can be found online on the CDC website [74]. The
online list provides links to case definitions of each
disease, including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In
cases where the etiological agent was not listed or was
unspecific (i.e. Brucella species), further research was done
to determine an etiological agent and literature used is
cited in legend for Additional File 2.
The most common causative agents of food- and waterborne illness were taken from a publication by Tauxe [75]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/19

and are listed in Additional File 3 [see Additional File 3].
Hubálek [20] published a list that constitutes a representative subset of emerging infectious diseases, which was
used as the basis for Additional File 4 [see Additional File
4]. The complete list of all species classified as emerging is
substantial [18,76]. The number of pathogens listed in the
emerging disease table at http://www.microbialrosettas
tone.com/ is significantly larger than that found in Additional File 4.
Additional File 5 [see Additional File 5]was taken from
The NIAID Strategic Plan For Biodefense Research, which
lists agents with potential for "high morbidity and mortality; potential for person-to-person transmission, directly
or by vector; low infective dose and high infectivity by aerosol, with commensurate ability to cause large outbreaks;
ability to contaminate food and water supplies; lack of a
specific diagnostic test and/or effective treatment; lack of
a safe and effective vaccine; potential to cause anxiety in
the public and in health care workers; and the potential to
be weaponized [77]."
The properties that make organisms amenable for use as
biological weapons have been discussed extensively
[31,32]. For the purposes of the database, we have categorized microorganisms or toxins as validated bioweapons if
they have been documented as used, or prepared for use,
as biological weapons [78]. Potential bioweapons are
defined as agents that have some properties that are considered useful as bioweapons or agents for terrorism, or
that have been the subject of serious bioweapons research
and development [31,39]. Greenwood et al. used a hierarchical ranking of 50 infectious agents and toxins of biological origin [31] to classify agents as potentially useful
biological weapons. Greenwood et al.'s 23 highest scoring
agents overlapped substantially with our list of validated
bioweapons and these are shown in Additional File 6 [see
Additional File 6].
The agents listed in Additional File 6 and additional
agents listed in Additional File 7 [see Additional File 7]
could be used in commission of a biocrime. Biocrimes are
similar to traditional crimes that harm specific individuals
except that the weapon is biological in nature. A number
of biological agents have been used to commit biocrimes
[52,79-96], and the potential list of agents that can be
used is enormous. Indeed, it is impossible to anticipate
the next organism that will be used for illicit purposes.
Documented cases and accessibility were the criteria for
choice of agents in Additional File 7.
The high potential for bioengineering category [see Additional File 8] includes both organisms that have been
actually modified in biological weapons research programs in the past, and organisms with properties that

Page 12 of 17

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:19

make them amenable to future engineering. Placement in
the latter category was based upon published reports of
bioengineering for peaceful purposes [53-58] and the
author's (DJE) analysis. The agents on the HHS list are
shown in Additional File 9. HHS regulates the possession
of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to
pose a severe threat to public health and safety. HHS's
Select Agent Program [97] regularly reviews and updates
the list of select agents and critical human pathogens [98].
The USDA is required by federal law to protect animal and
plant health. High Consequence Livestock Pathogens and
Toxins are agents that the USDA considers to have the
potential to pose a severe threat to animal or plant health,
or to animal or plant products [99]. These organisms are
listed in Additional File 10 [see Additional File 10]. The
pathogens on the HHS [see Additional File 9] and USDA
lists include agents that span all domains of life, including
20 bacteria, 48 viruses, four fungi, two protists, one prion,
and 11 toxins. A significant number of these agents appear
on both the HHS and USDA lists.

Authors' contributions
DJE conceived of the study, organized the structure and
contributed to the research and writing, and was overall
responsible for the development of the research and the
manuscript. RS, VS, TAH, KH, JAM, and JRW contributed
to the literature analysis, organization of written sections,
and writing of the manuscript. PW conducted extensive
research, analysis, and constructed and linked the tables.
BB contributed the sections on biocrimes and bioterrorism. CB-O contributed the viral taxonomy components of
the manuscript. CM contributed the phylogenetic organization sections, plant pathogen research, and generated
the figures.
