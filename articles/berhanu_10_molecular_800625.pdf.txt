Abstract
Background: Newcastle disease (ND), caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a highly contagious disease of
birds and has been one of the major causes of economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite routine vaccination
programs, sporadic cases have occasionally occurred in the country and remain a constant threat to commercial
poultry. Hence, the present study was aimed to characterize NDV isolates obtained from clinical cases in various
locations of Malaysia between 2004 and 2007 based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of partial F gene and
C-terminus extension length of HN gene.
Results: The coding region of eleven NDV isolates fusion (F) gene and carboxyl terminal region of haemagglutininneuraminidase (HN) gene including extensions were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR and directly sequenced.
All the isolates have shown to have non-synonymous to synonymous base substitution rate ranging between
0.081 - 0.264 demonstrating presence of negative selection. Analysis based on F gene showed the characterized
isolates possess three different types of protease cleavage site motifs; namely 112RRQKRF117, 112RRRKRF117 and
112
GRQGRL117 and appear to show maximum identities with isolates in the region such as cockatoo/14698/90
(Indonesia), Ch/2000 (China), local isolate AF2240 indicating the high similarity of isolates circulating in the South
East Asian countries. Meanwhile, one of the isolates resembles commonly used lentogenic vaccine strains. On
further characterization of the HN gene, Malaysian isolates had C-terminus extensions of 0, 6 and 11 amino acids.
Analysis of the phylogenetic tree revealed that the existence of three genetic groups; namely, genotype II, VII and
VIII.
Conclusions: The study concluded that the occurrence of three types of NDV genotypes and presence of varied
carboxyl terminus extension lengths among Malaysian isolates incriminated for sporadic cases.

Background
Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious disease of
birds and has been regarded throughout the world as one
of the most important diseases of poultry and other birds
[1], in which infection with the extremely virulent viruses
may result in sudden, high mortality with comparatively
few clinical signs. The causative agent, NDV, is avian

Paramyxovirus under the Avulavirus and has a negativesense, single-stranded RNA genome [2]. So far, NDV
strains with genomic sizes of 15,186, 15192 and 15198
nucleotides which codes for at least six proteins including
nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M) protein, fusion (F) protein, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase
(HN) protein and RNA polymerase (L) [2-4] have been
identified. Among the six major proteins, the two interactive surface glycoproteins, the F and the HN proteins, are
involved in cell surface attachment and cell membrane
fusion [3,5].

The molecular basis for NDV pathogenicity has been
shown to be dependent on the F protein cleavage site
amino acid sequence which is clearly described by OIE
[6] molecular definition of virulent NDV stating that
any AMV-1 virus that has three basic amino acids,
either lysine (K) or arginine (R), at the fusion protein
cleavage site between residues 113 and 116 at the Cterminus of the F2, as well as phenylalanine at residue
117 of F1 and carboxyl terminus amino acid extension
length which varies due to the varying location of termination codons within the HN protein, resulting in the
expression of HN proteins with varying amino acid
lengths. A longer reading frame consisting of HN0 precursor of 616 amino acid residue is expressed only by
avirulent NDV strains and biologically active HN proteins of 571 and 577 amino acid residues are expressed
by virulent and lentogenic viruses, respectively [7].
Three different NDV genotypes, II, III, and IV, were
involved in the first panzootic of ND and were restricted
to the specific geographic region; South East Asia in
which the outbreak began. In the late 1960 s, NDV genotypes V and VI emerged and caused the second and third
panzootics, respectively. After that, two novel NDV genotypes, VII and VIII, were found in Asia, Southern Africa,
and a number of European countries [8-12]. Genotype
VII was mainly responsible for recent outbreaks in the
neighbouring countries of Taiwan and China [8,13-15]
constituting the fourth panzootic of NDV.
Intensive vaccine programs have been implemented in
Malaysia, but ND outbreaks and sporadic cases have
occasionally occurred, even in well-vaccinated farms. A
major epidemic of ND has occurred in Peninsular
Malaysia from 2000-2001 peaking with 84 outbreaks
and 525981 cases in 2001 [16] which cause substantial
losses. Isolates of low virulence, HitchnerB1 and LaSota
are the most common type of vaccines being used in
the world including Malaysia. Other vaccines used in
Malaysia include S, Ulster 2C, NDV-6/10 and enteric
vaccine strain VG-GA [17]. Despite intensive vaccination programs with live vaccines, NDV remains a constant threat to the commercial poultry. Here, we
describe molecular characterization of F and C-terminus
extension length of HN protein genes of recently isolated Malaysian isolates and their phylogenetic relationship of among NDV isolates derived from other
countries or regions. Thus, characterization of these
recent isolates may help to gain invaluable information
about the pathogenicity and epidemiological
relationships.

Results
Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analysis

Sequence analysis of a region between nucleotide positions 47-435 of F gene, encompassing proteolytic

Page 2 of 10

cleavage site of F0 protein revealed 18-55 nucleotide and
4-21 amino acid substitutions in Malaysian isolates and
the calculation of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rate demonstrate that all isolates have a rate
ranging between 0.081 - 0.264, which is a value less than
one. As illustrated in Table 1, in all the NDV isolates
examined, the rate of synonymous substitution (0.126 0.306) dominated the rate of non-synonymous substitution (0.014 - 0.032). The maximum amino acid substitution was observed at amino acid position 11 compared
to consensus in which, 6 isolates (MB043/06, MB091/05,
MB093/05, MB095/05, MB128/04 and MB85/05) had
threonine (T) residue, and 3 isolates (MB016/07,
MB064/05, MB061/06) had an alanine (A) residue. Isolates MB091/05, MB093/05, MB095/05 and MB128/04
shared unique amino acid substitutions with MB043/06
at amino acid position 13; proline (P) for leucine (L),
C25F, T29A, K78R and Q114R (Table 2 and Table 3).
The unique amino acid substitution suggests that these
isolates might have a common origin despite being isolated in different areas in Malaysia. As shown in Table 4,
the deduced amino acid sequence of the F0 protein
cleavage site revealed that isolates MB043/06, MB091/05,
MB093/05, MB095/05, and MB128/04 had an arginine
(R) residue at position 114, which result in an
112
RRRKRF117 motif and the remaining isolates MB047/
05, MB064/05, MB076/05 and MB085/05) carry the residue 112RRQKRF 117. Only one isolate (MB016/07) possessed the motif of 112GRQGRL117 common to avirulent
isolates. Comparisons of nucleotide identities with published local and foreign isolates indicated that seven
isolates (MB076/05, MB047/05, MB043/06, MB091/05,
MB093/05, MB095/05 and MB128/04) were found
to have maximum identity (91.2% to 96.4%) with Indonesian isolate (Cockatoo/Indonesia/14698/90), two isolates
(MB064/05 and MB016/07) with strain Ch/2000
from China (94.8 to 96.6%) and the remaining isolates,
MB085/05 and MB061/06 with the local Malaysian
isolate AF2240 (97.4%) and vaccine strain LaSota
(98.8%), respectively (data not shown). These findings
indicated the high similarity of isolates circulating
in the South East Asian countries but still having
limited variation with isolates from different geographical
areas.
Carboxyl terminus of HN protein gene

Nucleotide sequencing and subsequent deduction of the
amino acid sequence covering the C- terminus of the
HN protein revealed differences in HN length of amino
acid sequences. Isolates MB016/07, MB043/06, MB047/
05, MB064/05, MB076/05, MB091/05, MB093/05,
MB095/05, and MB128/04 had no amino acid extension
length with a total HN length of 571 amino acids
regardless of their cleavage site sequence profiles,

whereas isolates MB085/05 and MB061/06 had HN Cterminus extension length of 11 aa and 6 aa, respectively, as shown in Table 5. Isolate MB085/05 had the
same C-terminus aa extension length and composition
as that of the local isolate AF2240 while isolate MB061/
06 revealed similar aa and C-terminus extension length
with that of common vaccine strains such as LaSota,
VG/GA, and Herts/33 used in Malaysia.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic tree generated based on the variable portion of the F gene between nt 47 - 435 of the 3 isolates
and other 35 local and foreign NDV isolates worldwide
separated into 9 potential clusters corresponding to the
different genotypes of NDV. All the Malaysian isolates
formed six major clusters despite their geographical
entity and within these, the presence of viruses belonging to three of the nine genotypes were identified (Figure 1). Isolates MB016/07and MB043/06 characterized
in this study were assigned to genotype VII within they
belonged to previously established subgenotype VIId
(Figure 1). Isolate MB043/06 together with other five
local strains segregated into a monophyletic group with
100% bootstrap value within genotype VII as shown in
Figure 1. Considering the topology of the phylogenetic
tree, these Malaysian isolates might have a common
origin
Previous phylogenetic analysis performed based on
variable region of F gene at nt 206-421(216 bp) classified
isolate MB085/05 as genotype VII [18]. In this study,
however, it was grouped together with previously characterized local NDV isolate AF2240 (isolated in the
1960s) and Chinese isolates (QH-1/79 and QH-4/85) in
genotype VIII. The phylogenetic grouping of MB085/05
as genotype VIII is supported by unique V 11 Â®T,
A 79 Â®T and S 107 Â®T substitutions although isolates
grouped into genotype VII in previous studies lacked

the aforementioned characteristic (Table 2 and Table 3).
The phylogenetic tree also showed that the lentogenic
isolate (MB061/06) was closely related to strain LaSota.

Discussion
Analysis of the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rate in the current isolates demonstrated the
presence of only purifying (negative) selection, despite the
most variable portion of the F gene between nucleotide
positions 47-435 was used in the analysis. Similar results
were also observed previously on analysis of other entire
NDV genes such as L (Ka/Ks = 0.064), M (Ka/Ks = 0.14
and P (Ka/Ks = 0.25) genes [19-21] which corresponds to
negative selection.
The amino acid sequence of the protease cleavage site
reveals that all of the isolates except isolate MB061/06
maintained multiple basic amino acids motifs within the
penta-amino acid sequence of the F0 cleavage signal
between residues 113 and 116 and phenylalanine (F) on
the residue 117 on the N-terminus. It is widely accepted
that the number of basic amino acids immediately
upstream to the F0 protein cleavage site determines
viral pathogenicity which is clearly described by OIE [6].
The presence of these characteristic patterns of amino
acid demonstrated that the isolates could be considered
as virulent except isolate MB061/06. It is a paramount
importance to note that, the F0 cleavage site of isolate
MB043/06 isolated from Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia,
is unusual, containing an arginine (R) for glutamine (Q)
substitution at residue 114. In our previous studies, isolates MB091/05, MB093/05, MB095/05, and MB128/04
from different districts of Sabah, West Malaysia showed
similar F0 cleavage site characteristics [18]. However, in
recent years, emergence of similar results were reported,
in South African genotype VIII viruses [11], in Taiwan
[15] and from Eurasian collard dove and pigeons isolates
containing a 112 R-R-K-K-R 116 , 112 R-R-Q-K-R 116 , and

R-R-R-K-R116 motif [22-26]. Even though the contribution of arginine (R) at amino acid 114 in our isolates
needs further studies, other studies indicated that arginine residue at different positions 113, 115 and 116 contribute for intracellular cleavage of virulent NDV fusion
proteins [27].
Analysis of C-terminus extension length of HN protein
gene revealed that the nine virulent NDV isolates shared 0
amino acid extension length with a total HN length of 571
amino acids regardless of their cleavage site sequence

profiles (terminating in the sequence KDDRV and
KDNRA), except MB085/05. In the present study, isolate
MB085/05 was shown to have 11aa HN C-terminus extension length. This might have been due to a point mutations occurred at position 8164 (TÂ®C) replacing the stop
codon 8164TAA8166 with 8164CAA8166 codon and hence
delayed terminations. This result may suggest a genetic
relationship of MB085/05 sequences to the local virulent
isolates with a genetic evolution that has led to the presence of these varied HN C- terminus extension lengths.

In contrast, MB061/06 isolated from parrot was shown
to have 6 amino acid C-terminus extension lengths, similar to that of common vaccine strains such as LaSota,
VG/GA, and Herts/33 used in Malaysia. However, it is
shorter than other avirulent strains such as Queensland
V4 strain and Ulster/67, most of which have 45 amino
acid extensions. Substitutions at positions 8149 (CÂ®G)
and 8150 (GÂ®A) might have contributed for generation
of the stop codon 8149TAG8151, terminating early and
hence fewer amino acid extensions. It has been indicated
that the shortest amino acid value (571 amino acids) was

found in genotypes III-VIII consisting exclusively of viscerotropic velogenic strains [4]. The phylogenetic relationships based on the partial sequence of F protein gene
of these isolates also showed that all the nine NDV isolates with shortest amino acid value (571) appeared to be
closely related to viruses from genotype VII. According
to Gould et al [28] and Kattenbelt et al [29], Australian
isolates have HN extensions of 7, 9, 11, 14 or 45 amino
acids and they indicated that viruses with 7 or 14 amino
acid extensions were shown to be associated with summer respiratory disease.

É¸ All the isolates were isolated from chicken except for MB061/06 isolated from parrot.
* Numbers indicate amino acid positions.

The phylogenetic relationship result showed that the 3
Malaysian isolates recovered in 2006 and 2007; belong
to genotype II and VII. Closer phylogenetic relationship
of genotype VII viruses suggests that isolate MB043/06
and local viruses isolated from 2004-2005 belong to a
subgenotype VIId with 100% bootstrap value, all of the
members of which encodes the 112RRRKRF117 motif at
the fusion cleavage site (Figure 1). In addition, we note
that all those isolates share 6 common unique substitutions that distinguished them from all other subgenotypes/genotypes. According to Yu et al [30], genotype
VIIb viruses evolved from genotype VIb viruses by producing a VII specific V121 for I substitution and then
changed to VIIa and VIIc by producing a K101-for-R
substitution and became VIId by producing additional
V52-for-I and Y314-for-F substitutions. Exceptions were
observed in the substitution of V at amino acid position
121 in our isolate but it did share the K substitution at
amino acid residue 101 in which both K101 and V121

were unique features of genotype VII. Lien et al. [31]
reports that Taiwanese subgenotype VIId viruses collected between 2003 and 2006 contained K71 and V52 in
which similar features were observed in isolate MB016/
07. Thus it is predicted that isolate MB016/07 can also
be grouped under subgenotype VIId, which represents
the most newly emerging NDV strains frequently occurring in the region especially from China and Taiwan.
These findings supported by topology of phylogenetic
tree suggest that it genetically related to genotype VII
viruses but with the distinguishable subcluster.
Our study has also indicated the occurrence of other
sub-genotype/genotype; VIIb and VIII viruses. Malaysian
subgenotype VIIb virus in this study would have been
more closely related to local and South East Asian countriesâ isolates because of their regional proximity.
However, it has shared high sequence identities (91.7 92.5%) with Southern Africa subgenotype VIIb
viruses than other Malaysian genotype VII viruses

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationship among 38 NDV isolates on basis of F gene nucleotide sequences between position 47 and 435.
Sequences were obtained either from the present study or GenBank. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour- joining method
on MEGA 4. Malaysian isolates in the current study were indicated by the rotated black square.

(87.4 - 90.4%). Previous studies also proposed that subgenotype VIIb strains isolated in Southern Africa might
have originated in the Far East as their lack of diversity
indicated that they cannot be indigenous to South Africa
[8]. The finding in this work revealed that Malaysian
genotype VII isolates are also phylogenetically related
and share a common ancestor (supported by a high
bootstrap value of 98) with Southern African isolates
strengthening the hypothesis that genotype VII viruses
were endemic in South East Asian countries. It has been
documented that genotype VIII viruses were isolated
from ND outbreaks in western China between 1979 and
1985, Southern Africa and are endemic in Southern
Africa [8,11,13]. The presence of genotype VIII virus

neighbouring country Singapore in early 1960 s and in
Malaysia (AF2240) that gave rise to the recent genotype
VIII virus (MB085/05) suggests that it was maintained
in the region as endemic infection.
In Malaysia, NDV has been isolated frequently from
chickens and most of the isolates were belong to genotype VII viruses [18,32]. The MB061/06 isolate characterized in this study is the first genotype II NDV
isolated from parrot in the peninsular Malaysia since it
was reported in chicken in early 1980 s [33]. It is
worth to point out that the grouping of isolate
MB061/06 and LaSota under the same cluster in genotype II and the existence of similar C-terminus amino
acid extensions length of HN protein suggested

Berhanu et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:183
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/183

MB061/06 might be generated in nature from the
LaSota vaccine strain.

Conclusions
Our study indicates the occurrence of genotypes; II, VII
and VIII and the presence of varied C-terminus extension lengths within Malaysian isolates. The deduced
amino acid sequence of the F0 protein cleavage site
showed also a unique amino acid motif in one of the
isolates incriminated for sporadic cases occurred in different areas of the country. Approaches towards full
characterization of isolates with unique F0 cleavage signal amino acid sequence and 6 amino acid extensions
should be continued and intensified for deeper molecular knowledge and better intervention strategies.
Methods
Isolates

A total of eleven (11) NDV isolates, which were previously detected positive by real time RT-PCR between
2004 and 2007 at Biologics Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) were
employed in this study (Table 1). The virus isolates
were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 9 days old
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs
according to European Community directive 92/66/EC
[34] and identified by haemaglutination tests. Infected
allantoic fluid samples were clarified by centrifugation
and supernatant was stored at -70Â°C for later analysis.
Viral RNA extraction

RNA extraction was performed from infected allantoic
fluid using TRIzolÂ® Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in accordance with the manufacturerâs instructions. The RNA
pellet was re-suspended in 20 Î¼l nuclease-free water
(Promega, USA) after air dried for immediate use or
kept in -80Â°C for later use.

Page 8 of 10

PCR kit (Promega, USA) in a reaction volume of 25 Î¼l.
The cycling parameters for F gene specific primers were
48Â°C for 45 min at reverse transcription (RT), and 35
cycles of 94Â°C for 2 min, 56Â°C for 2 min, and 72Â°C for 1
min, followed by 72Â°C for 10 min and for HN gene specific primers; 48 min at 45Â°C for RT, 95 Â°C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95Â°C, 1 min at 51Â°C
and 1 min at 72Â°C and a final extension step at 72Â°C for
10 min (MyCyclerÂ® Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). The amplicons were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet
after being stained with ethidium bromide.
Sequencing of PCR products

Specific bands for each gene of interest were excised
and purified by using GENEALLâ¢Gel SV kit (General
Biosystem, Inc., Korea) following the manufacturerâs
instructions. The purified DNA encoded for F and HN
regions were sequenced by direct sequencing in both
directions. Sequencing reactions were performed using
ABI PRISMÂ® BigDyeâ¢ Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready reaction kit v2.0 (Perkin Elmer, USA) in an automated DNA Sequencer (ABI PRISMÂ® 377 DNA Sequencer). Each sample was sequenced three times to confirm
consistency of the results.
Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis

Percent nucleotide identity and sequence editing were
carried out using BioEdit software package version 7.01
[36]. Nucleotide analysis, prediction of amino acid
sequences, and alignments were performed by Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, version 4.01 (MEGA 4)
[37]. Determination of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rates was conducted using the Nei-Gojobori
method in Mega 4 [37]. Nucleotide sequences of partial F
and HN gene of studied isolates were deposited in the
GenBank and accession numbers are shown in Tables 4
and 5, respectively.

Primers and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)

Phylogenetic analysis

PCR amplification and sequencing were performed using
previously described degenerative primers 5â²-ATGGGC
(C/T)CCAGA(C/T)CTTCTAC-3â² (sense) and 5â²CTGCCACTGCTAGTTGTGATAATCC-3â² (antisense)
specific to fusion (F) protein gene [13] and HNNDV314
5â²-ATATCCCGCAGTCGCATAAC-3â²(sense)
and
HNNDV304 5â²-TTTTTCTTAATCAAGTGACT-3â²(antisense) specific to HN protein gene [35]. The primers
generate an expected amplicon size of 535 bp (nt 47535) fragment spanning the regions between nucleotides
47 and 581 of the fusion protein, which includes the F0
cleavage site and 320 bp products representing a fragment within HN protein gene, respectively. Standard
RT-PCR was performed using AccessÂ® One- step RT-

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out by comparing the
variable portion of the F gene between 47 to 435 (389
bp) nucleotide sequences using the Clustal W multiple
alignment method using MEGA 4 [37]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining
method after 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The sequence
of the representative strains from each genotype and different geographical areas were retrieved from GenBank.
Since no full-lengh sequence information at nt 47 to
435 was available for the remaining eight Malaysian isolates which were phylogenetically analysed in our previous study [18], sequences in this study were used. The
accession numbers and country are as follows: AF2240
