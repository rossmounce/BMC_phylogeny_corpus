Abstract
Background: Nowadays, better immunosuppressors have decreased the rates of acute rejection in kidney
transplantation, but have also led to the emergence of BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN). Therefore, we
prospectively investigated BKV load in plasma and urine samples in a cohort of kidney transplants, receiving
basiliximab combined with a mycophenolate mofetil-based triple immunotherapy, to evaluate the difference
between BKV replication during the first 3 months post-transplantation, characterized by the non-depleting action
of basiliximab, versus the second 3 months, in which the maintenance therapy acts alone. We also performed
sequencing analysis to assess whether a particular BKV subtype/subgroup or transcriptional control region (TCR)
variants were present.
Methods: We monitored BK viruria and viremia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) at 12 hours (Tx),
1 (T1), 3 (T2) and 6 (T3) months post-transplantation among 60 kidney transplant patients. Sequencing analysis was
performed by nested-PCR with specific primers for TCR and VP1 regions. Data were statistically analyzed using c2
test and Student’s t-test.
Results: BKV was detected at Tx in 4/60 urine and in 16/60 plasma, with median viral loads of 3,70 log GEq/mL
and 3,79 log GEq/mL, respectively, followed by a significant increase of both BKV-positive transplants (32/60) and
median values of viruria (5,78 log GEq/mL) and viremia (4,52 log GEq/mL) at T2. Conversely, a significantly decrease
of patients with viruria and viremia (17/60) was observed at T3, together with a reduction of the median urinary
and plasma viral loads (4,09 log GEq/mL and 4,00 log GEq/mL, respectively). BKV TCR sequence analysis always
showed the presence of archetypal sequences, with a few single-nucleotide substitutions and one nucleotide
insertion that, interestingly, were all representative of the particular subtypes/subgroups we identified by VP1
sequencing analysis: I/b-2 and IV/c-2.
Conclusions: Our results confirm previous studies indicating that BKV replication may occur during the early hours
after kidney transplantation, reaches the highest incidence in the third post-transplantation month and then
decreases within the sixth month, maybe due to induction therapy. Moreover, it might become clinically useful
whether specific BKV subtypes or rearrangements could be linked to a particular disease state in order to detect
them before BKVAN onset.

Background
Immunosuppressive strategies in renal transplantation
aim to improve renal function, to prolong graft survival
and to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects [1].
Standard immunosuppressive regimens in renal transplantation generally consist of calcineurin inhibitors
(CNIs) [tacrolimus or ciclosporin], mycophenolate
(mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or entericcoated mycophenolate sodium), and corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or prednisolone) [2]. The addition of induction
therapy with antilymphocyte antibodies or interleukin
(IL)-2 receptor (IL-2Ra) antibodies, such as basiliximab
(Simulect ® ; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), to standard
immunosuppressive regimens has reduced the risk of
acute rejection episodes during the early post-transplant
period when the risk of rejection is greatest [1,3]. Basiliximab is a recombinant chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the a-subunit of the
IL-2Ra (also referred to as the CD25 antigen) on activated T cells, thereby inhibiting IL-2-mediated proliferation of T lymphocytes, a critical step in the cellular
immune response involved in allograft rejection [2].
Basiliximab induction allows dose reduction of corticosteroids or CNIs, thereby minimizing the adverse effects
associated with these co-administered agents. Moreover,
the addition of basiliximab to a triple immunotherapy
containing azathioprine or MMF resulted either in a significantly reduction in the incidence of biopsy-confirmed
acute rejection episodes (40.4% and 42.5%, respectively)
at 6 months when compared with placebo either in an
increase of the IL-2Ra saturation period (36 vs 50 days
and 36 vs 59 days, respectively) [2,4]. Thus, current treatment guidelines recommend the use of basiliximab as
part of a CNI-based regimen for the prophylaxis of acute
graft rejection in renal transplantation in adults, adolescents and children [5-8].
The introduction in clinical practice of newer, more
potent immunosuppressive agents has been correlated
with the higher prevalence of polyomavirus-associated
nephropathy (PVAN) or, more specifically, BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) in renal
transplant patients, indicating a relationship between
the human polyomavirus BK (BKV) reactivation and
the disruption of the immune system [9-11]. BKVAN
is characterized by necrosis of proximal tubules and
denudation of the basement membrane as a result of
BKV lytic infection in kidney epithelial cells [12,13],
but is often misdiagnosed as acute rejection or drug
toxicity [14,15]. It occurs in 1% to 10% of kidney transplant recipients, usually manifesting in the first year
following transplantation and leading to graft loss in
50% of infected patients within 2-3 years of follow-up
[10,14].

The current recommendation includes screening for
BKV reactivation with subsequent preventive reduction of
immunosuppression with or without antiviral therapy [16].
Among all available diagnostic methods for BKV infection,
analysis of BKV DNA load in plasma has been shown to
have the highest predictive value for BKVAN with BKV
load in plasma ≥ 104 copies/mL for > 3 weeks [17].
BKV infection is ubiquitous among the human population from early childhood, with a seroprevalence in adults
of more than 80% [18]. After primary infection, BKV persists in a latent state in cells of several organs including
kidney (the main site of BKV latency in healthy individuals), peripheral blood leukocytes, and maybe other sites
such as the lung, eye, liver, and brain [9,19]. BKV belongs
to the Polyomaviridae family, which includes nonenveloped DNA viruses with icosahedral capsids of 45 nm
diameter containing small, circular double-stranded DNA
genomes of approximately 5 Kb [20,21]. The viral genome
is divided into early, late, and regulatory regions and
encodes for at least six proteins, two from the early region
[the large tumor antigen (TAg) and the small tumor antigen (tAg)] and four from the late region [the capsid proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and the agnoprotein][21,22]. VP1,
which is the major capsid protein, is present on the surface
of the capsid and is responsible for receptor binding to
host cells. In addition, VP1 is highly immunogenic, is the
target of neutralizing antibody and is required for virion
assembly and hemagglutination of red blood cells. Four
distinct serotypes of BKV have been previously determined
by hemagglutination inhibition, named subtypes I-IV by
Jin et al. [23]. Genetic analyses of VP1 sequences have
determined that the serotyping region contains a variable
region of the BKV genome between nucleotides 1744 and
1812 (amino acids 61 to 83). Subtype I (further divided
into four subgroups, each of which has a unique geographical distribution pattern: I/a, I/b-1, I/b-2 and I/c) is the
most frequent in the normal human population worldwide
(80%), subtype IV (further divided into six subgroups with
their own geographical distribution pattern: IV/a-1, IV/a2, IV/b-1, IV/b-2, IV/c-1 and IV/c-2) is prevalent in
Asia and part of Europe, while subtypes II and III are
infrequently detected in normal adults [24]. Several evolutionary studies using phylogenetic analysis suggest a
co-migration of BKV and the human race to explain the
geographical distribution patterns of BKV subtypes and
subgroups [24-27].
The regulatory region contains the origin of DNA
replication (O-block, 142 base-pairs) and sequences
involved in transcriptional regulation of both the early
and the late genes (promoter/enhancer elements),
referred to as the transcriptional control region (TCR).
The TCR of the proposed archetypal BK strain WW
(WW TCR) has been arbitrarily divided into four

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/407

transcription factor binding sequence blocks, called P
(68 base-pairs), Q (39 base-pairs), R (63 base-pairs), and
S (63 base-pairs). The different BKV strains display a
marked heterogeneity in their TCR due to point mutations, deletions, duplications, and rearrangements in this
region [28]. These rearrangements may play an important role in virus replication by increasing or decreasing
the number or the affinities of host transcription factor
binding sites [28,29]. BKV variants with rearranged TCR
have been identified in various studies including kidney
transplant recipients [30]. The BKV variants with rearranged TCR emerging as the majority species in blood
of recipients with BKV-nephropathy are quite heterogeneous with insertions, deletions, and mixtures, but all
seem to confer an increased early gene expression, a
higher replication capacity and more pronounced cytopathology in cell culture compared to archetype WW
TCR. Interestingly, the displacement of archetype TCR
by rearranged TCR was not matched by a simultaneous
displacement in the urine indicating that these sites
represent largely independent replication compartments
[30].
As mentioned above, although in the last decade better
immunosuppression drugs, including basiliximab as induction therapy, have decreased the rates of acute rejection in
kidney transplantation, they have also led to the emergence of BKVAN, that may occur early after kidney transplantation [16,31,32]. Therefore, the aim of our study was
to prospectively investigate the BKV viral load in plasma
and urine samples belonging to a cohort of 60 adult
kidney transplant patients, treated with basiliximab combined with a MMF-based triple immunotherapy, during
the first 6 months post-transplantation to monitor the
trend of BKV viremia and viruria, focusing our attention
on the difference between viral replication during the first
3 months, characterized by the immunosuppressive action
of basiliximab, and the following 3 months, when the
monoclonal antibody was completely removed and the
maintenance therapy acted alone. We also performed
sequencing analysis of all BKV positive samples to assess
the presence of BKV TCR variants and sequencing analysis of the VP1 region to determine whether a particular
BKV subtype/subgroup was more present in these anatomic areas.

Methods
Study Population

From January 2008 to December 2010, we enrolled 60
patients listed for and undergoing cadaveric or living
donor kidney transplantations at the Department of
Organ Transplantation and General Surgery “Paride Stefanini” of the “Umberto I” Hospital of Rome, Italy.
These patients were evaluated for relevant clinical data
including age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI),

Page 3 of 10

etiology of end stage renal disease, hepatitis C (HCV)
and B (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serological
status, diabetes, months of renal replacement therapy
(RRT) and re-transplantation. We also recorded donor
data of age, gender, weight, BMI, and cause of death.
Graft characteristics and cold ischemia time were also
scored (Additional File 1, Table S1).
All the patients received induction immunosoppressive
therapy with two doses [20 mg within 2 hours prior to
transplantation surgery (day 0) and 20 mg 4 days later
(day 4)] of intravenous basiliximab and maintenance therapy with tacrolimus (or cyclosporine), MMF and corticosteroids. A MMF-based triple therapy induces a significant
reduction of the basiliximab total body clearance (CL)
[36.7 vs 18.3 mL/h], and an increase of its terminal elimination half-life (t½) [7.4 vs 11.5 days] and the period of
IL-2Ra saturation (36 vs 59 days) [2]. Trough levels of
immunosuppressive drugs were maintained within the
therapeutic range.
Blood and urine samples for quantification of BKV
load were collected at median times of 12 hours (Tx), 1
(T1), 3 (T2) and 6 (T3) months after transplantation in
order to evaluate the trend of BKV viremia and viruria
from basiliximab administration (Tx-T1) to its complete
removal (T2), and the following 3 months of immunosuppressive action of maintenance therapy (T3). BKV
DNA copies were measured by Q-PCR. At the same
time we monitored blood count, urea, creatinine, serum
sodium, and potassium levels. Renal biopsies were taken
when acute rejection was suspected.
An informed consent form was signed by each patient
at the time of collection.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Medicine.
Clinical Specimens Collection and Processing

This study was carried out on a total of 240 blood samples and 240 urine samples, collected from a cohort of
60 adult renal allograft recipients at the different times
after transplantation as mentioned above.
DNA for molecular analysis was extracted from 1 ml
of each urine sample, collected without preservatives,
using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, S.p.A,
Italy) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
stored at -20°C until use.
Blood samples, collected in 4-mL Vacuntainer® tubes
containing EDTA (BD Becton Dickinson S.p.A, Italia),
were centrifuged at 1,376 g/sec for 10 minutes and DNA
was extracted from 200 μL of plasma using the DNeasy®
Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, S.p.A, Milan, Italy) and
stored at -20°C until use. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood using the
standard Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation
technique [33]. PBMCs DNA extraction was performed

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/407

on 106 cells by the QIAmp® DNA Blood Kit (QIAGEN
S.p.A, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and stored at -20°C until use.
DNA yield of all samples was determined by measuring its concentration in the eluate by absorbance at 260
nm and then 0.1-1 μg of total DNA was directly used
for PCR amplification assays.
Q-PCR for BKV

DNA samples extracted from all urine and plasma collected in this study were analyzed using the BKV Q-PCR
Alert Kit (Nanogen Advanced Diagnostics S.r.l., Italy), a
quantitative amplification assay designed for the diagnosis and monitoring of BKV infection in DNA samples
extracted from plasma collected in EDTA and urine collected without preservatives. This technique, based on
TaqMan-MGB® (Minor Groove Binder) technology, was
performed using a 7300 Real Time PCR System (AB
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The amplification
reaction is carried out both for a region of the gene
that encodes BKV TAg and for the promoter region
and 5’UTR of the human beta globin (b-globin) gene. bglobin gene is amplified simultaneously with the target
sequence to verify successful DNA isolation and exclude
false-negative results. PCR amplifications were run in a
reaction volume of 20 μL containing 5 μL (50 ng/μl) of
total purified DNA, BKV Q-PCR Alert AmpliMIX (specific primer oligonucleotides mixture), BKV Q-PCR Alert
AmpliPROBE (mixture of fluorescent probes labelled
with FAM/MGB-NFQ specific for BKV DNA and fluorescent probes labelled with VIC/MGB-NFQ specific for
human b-globin gene, the internal suitability test of the
sample) and Q-PCR Alert AmpliMASTER (optimized
reagent mixture with Uracil-N-glycosidase (UNG), an
enzyme to inactivate contamination from amplification
product, and ROX fluorophore, as the passive reference
for the normalisation of the fluorescence). Thermal
cycling was carried out according to the following steps:
an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45
cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min, at the end
of which the fluorescence was read. Amplification data
were analyzed with software provided by the manufacturer. The standard curve for this quantitative amplification assay is obtained using the BKV Q-PCR Standard,
four stabilized serial dilutions at known titre (range:
102-105 plasmid copies) of a plasmid containing part of
the BKV genome region encoding for TAg. All samples
were tested in triplicate and the number of viral copies in
each sample was calculated from the standard curve. The
Q-PCR results for urine and plasma specimens were
expressed as genome equivalents of viral DNA per milliliter (GEq/mL) of sample. Standard precautions designed
to prevent contamination during Q-PCR were followed
and a No Template Control (NTC) lane was included in

Page 4 of 10

each run. The assay detected about 10 molecules of the
target sequence in 5 μL DNA.
PCR for BKV TCR

All BKV-positive specimens were further amplified by a
nested-PCR using two sets of primers annealing to invariant regions flanking the BKV TCR. The first amplification
round was carried out using BKTT1, 5’-AAG GTC CAT
GAG CTC CAT GGA TTC TTC C-3’ (nucleotides 51065133) as forward primer, and BKTT2, 5’-CTA GGT CCC
CCA AAA GTG CTA GAG CAG C-3’ (nucleotides 657630) as reverse primer, that generated a 748 bp PCR product after 40 amplification cycles [34]. The following
amplification round, instead, was carried out using the forward primer BK-1, 5’-GGC CTC AGA AAA AGC CTC
CAC ACC CTT ACT ACT TGA-3’ (nucleotides 50-85)
and the reverse primer BK-2, 5’-CTT GTC GTG ACA
GCT GGC GCA GAA C-3’ (nucleotides 415-391) that
amplified an inner portion of the first-round PCR product,
generating a fragment of 366 bp in length after 29 amplification cycles [35]. The two amplifications were performed
in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2U BioTaq
DNA polymerase with an appropriate reaction buffer
(Tris-HCl 100 mM, pH 8.3, KCl 500 mM). In the first
step, 5 μl (50 ng/μl) of purified DNA was added to the
PCR mixture and, in the second step, 2,5 μl of template.
PCR amplifications were carried out in a GeneAmp® PCR
System 9700 (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
All assays included positive (recombinant pGem-1 plasmid
DNA containing the complete BKV genome, cloned as
EcoR1 fragments) and negative (PCR mixture plus pure
water) controls to exclude false-positive and false-negative
results. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on
an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel.
PCR for BKV VP1 region

In order to amplify the genomic region corresponding to
VP1 of BK virus, a nested-PCR with two different sets of
primers was performed. The first amplification round was
carried out using the forward primer VP1-7, 5’-ATC AAA
GAA CTG CTC CTC AAT-3’ (nucleotides 1480-1500)
and the reverse primer VP1-2R, 5’-GCA CTC CCT GCA
TTT CCA AGG G-3’ (nucleotides 2038-2059) that generated a 579 bp PCR product after 35 amplification cycles
[36]. The following amplification round, instead, was conducted using 327-1, 5’-CAA GTG CCA AAA CTA CTA
AT-3’ (nucleotides 1630-1649) as forward primer, and
327-2, 5’-TGC ATG AAG GTT AAG CAT GC-3’
(nucleotides 1956-1937) as reverse primer, designed to
amplify an inner portion of the first-round PCR product,
generating a fragment of 327 bp in length after 35 amplification cycles [23]. The two amplifications were performed
in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 10 pmol of each

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/407

primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2U BioTaq
DNA polymerase with an appropriate reaction buffer
(Tris-HCl 100 mM, pH 8.3, KCl 500 mM). In the first
step, 5 μl (50 ng/μl) of purified DNA was added to the
PCR mixture and, in the second step, 2,5 μl of template.
PCR amplifications were carried out in a GeneAmp® PCR
System 9700 (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Positive (BKV DNA) and negative (pure water) controls
were set up in parallel to exclude false-negative and contamination. Amplified fragments were detected by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis on 2% agarose
gel.
Sequencing of BKV TCR and VP1 regions

PCR products corresponding to the TCR and VP1 regions
were purified before sequencing to remove the excess of
primers with QIAquick® PCR purification kit, according
to QIAGEN protocol [37]. DNA sequencing was performed by automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystem,
mod. 370A) according to the manufacturer’s specifications
(Amplicycle Kit, Applied Biosystem). Sequences were
organised and analyzed by homology analysis using the
Genetic Computer Group sequence analysis software
package. In particular, all sequences obtained from the
amplification of the TCR region were compared to the
TCR sequence of the BKV archetype strain WW (GenBank accession no. AB211371), whereas those obtained
from the amplification of the VP1 region were classified
into known subtypes/subgroups analysing the single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the amplified
VP1 region. To detect the SNPs, by which we have subclassified our isolates, we aligned 32 complete VP1 subtype-IV DNA sequences, divided into six subgroups, and
13 complete VP1 subtype-I DNA sequences, divided into
four subgroups. We also aligned the complete VP1 gene
sequences of 3 subtype II and 2 VP1 DNA sequences
belonging to subtype III in order to create a consensus
sequence for these subtypes (Additional File 2, Table S2).
Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW2 at
the EMBL-EBI website using default parameters [38].
Sequences were numbered using BKV Dunlop as reference
strain (GenBank accession no. NC_001538) following the
system of Seif et al., in which nucleotide position 1 is the
TCR position next to the start codon of TAg [39].
Statistical analysis

Data were summarized as medians and ranges or as
mean, as appropriate. If Z test indicated a non-normal
distribution, we used non-parametric test such as
Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Categorical data were analyzed by using c2 test and Student’s
t-test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Quantification of BKV load in urine and in plasma
specimens

The Q-PCR analysis highlighted the presence of BKV in
63/240 urine samples and in 85/240 plasma samples collected from the 60 renal transplant patients at different
times after transplantation (Tx, T1, T2 and T3). Tx-T2
correspond to the pharmacokinetics phase of basiliximab action from its administration (Tx-T1) to its complete elimination (T2), whereas T3 corresponds to the
following 3 months of maintenance therapy alone (T3).
Additional File 3, Table S3 shows in detail the BKV
positivity distributed among the various types of samples
analyzed in our study. In particular, BKV DNA was
found in 4/60 (6%) urine samples and in 16/60 (26%)
plasma samples at Tx, and therefore after the first
20 mg dose of basiliximab administration. Monitoring of
BKV replication in the following 6 months showed a
gradual significant increase of patients with viruria when
we compared samples collected at T1 (about 1 month
after the second dose of basiliximab injection) to those
collected at T2, which corresponds to the maximum
period of IL-2Ra saturation (59 days from the first
dose). In fact, at T1, 10/60 (16%) urine were positive to
viral genome whereas, at T2, urine positive raised to
32/60 (53%) (P < 0.05). Similarly for viremia, we found
20/60 (33%) BKV-positive blood samples at T1, whereas
positive specimens were 32/60 (53%) at T2 (P < 0.05).
Conversely, a significantly reduction of individuals with
viruria and viremia (17/60; 28%) was detected at T3
(P < 0.05). The same trend was observed when we compared the median viral loads obtained at different times
of the follow-up. In fact, urinary and plasma BKV loads
significantly increased up to reach the values of 5,78 log
GEq/mL and 4,52 log GEq/mL at T2 (P < 0.05), respectively. On the other hand, a significantly decreasing was
observed 3 months after the IL-2Ra saturation phase
ending (4,09 log GEq/mL in urine and 4,00 log GEq/mL
in plasma) (P < 0.05), when the immunosuppression was
exclusively due to the maintenance therapy.
Finally, there was no significant association with detection of BKV in plasma and/or urine among recipients’
characteristics (age, gender, time of dialysis, etiology of
renal failure and immunosuppressive therapy); donor
parameters (age, gender, weight, BMI and cause of death),
or graft feature (score and ischemic time) (P > 0.05) (data
not shown).
PCR and sequencing analysis of BKV TCR sequences

All specimens resulted positive to viral DNA by Q-PCR
assay as well as the PBMCs isolated from blood samples
with viremia were amplified by nested-PCR and
sequenced, successively, for BKV TCR to investigate the

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407

presence of possible rearrangements within this region.
The TCR sequence derived from the total DNA of each
individual clinical sample was compared to the TCR
sequence of BKV archetype strain WW, available on
GenBank, by using the convention described in the
review by Moens et al. [40]. Specifically, the 233 nucleotides of the archetype WW TCR sequence was arbitrarily divided into four blocks (P, Q, R, and S) with
lengths of 68, 39, 63, and 63 nt, respectively, to more
easily describe the major rearrangements within the TCR.
Homology analysis evidenced that 148 out of 233 BKV
TCR analyzed sequences (63 urine, 85 plasma and 85
PBMCs) showed a TCR identical to the archetypal BKV
control region (designated WW-like archetype 1 TCR or
WWLA1), consisting of a single complete copy of the four
blocks arranged in the correct order (Figure 1), with the
occurrence of a few point mutations at nucleotide positions 18 and 31 within P block, 4 within R block and 18
within S block (Figure 2). These point mutations did not
involve any cellular transcriptional factors binding sites,
except for the single-nucleotide substitution at position 31
within P block involving the nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) binding site (Figure 2). For the remaining 85 analyzed
sequences, obtained from 25 urine, 30 plasma and 30
PBMCs samples, a slightly altered TCR archetype, consisting of a single complete copy of the P, Q, R and S blocks
arranged in the correct order, the last of which characterized by the insertion of a single thymidine nucleotide
between nucleotide positions 49 and 50, was isolated
(Figure 1). This archetype-like structure has been designated WW-like archetype 2 TCR (WWLA2) to distinguish
it from the WWLA1 archetype. When compared with the
TCR nucleotide sequences of the BKV archetype strain
WW, various nucleotide substitutions have been identified
in the different sequences at nucleotide positions: 18, 19
and 31 within P block, 5, 38 and 40 within R block and 22
within S block (Figure 2). The nucleotide substitutions at

indicated by rectangles. Above each colored rectangle is a letter
confirming the name of the block, followed by a pair of numbers to
indicate the range of nucleotides present. The S block of the
WWLA2 archetype has one nucleotide insertion represented by a T

positions 31 within P block and 38 and 40 within R block
involved two binding sites for the transcription factor
NF-1, whereas the thymidine insertion between nucleotide
positions 49 and 50 within the S block interested the
estrogen response element (ERE) (Figure 2).
PCR and sequencing analysis of BKV VP1 region

An additional specific nested PCR was undertaken to
detect the presence of VP1 region in urine and PBMCs
samples collected from all BKV-positive renal transplant
patients. The 327 bp VP1 gene sequence was amplified in
all specimens of our patient group (63 urine and 85
PBMCs). The amplified PCR products from all BKV VP1positive individuals were then sequenced in order to classify each BKV strain into the corresponding subtype/subgroup analysing the SNPs within the amplified VP1
region. Alignment of 13 complete VP1 subtype I and 32
subtype IV DNA sequences, divided into the corresponding subgroups, identified seven positions (nucleotides
1687, 1698, 1809,1860, 1887, 1908 and 1923) showing
SNPs within the 327 bp typing region among subtypes I
subgroups and six positions (nucleotides 1731, 1794, 1851,
1860, 1905 and 1926) among subtypes IV subgroups.
Based on these SNPs and on the consensus sequences for
subtypes II and III, obtained aligning the complete VP1
gene sequences of 3 subtype II and 2 subtype III, subtype
I/subgroup b-2 was detected in 38 out of 63 urine samples
(60%) and in 55 out of 85 PBMCs samples (65%), respectively, while subtype IV/subgroup c-2 was detected in 25
urine (40%) and in 30 PBMCs specimens (35%). Subtype II
and III were never detected (data not shown).

Discussion
In the last 50 years, solid organ transplantation has been
established as not only a key life saving procedure of terminal organ failure, but also as the treatment of choice with
respect to patients’ quality of life. In addition to better
procurement and surgical procedures, much of the success
of solid organ transplantation stems from improving
the control of acute immune reactions across HLAmismatches through the establishment of new efficient
immunosuppressive protocols, which have efficiently
reduced immune injury and acute and chronic loss of
function [31]. Thus, recent regimens for the prevention of
acute organ rejection in both pediatric and adult transplant patients are based on a combination of drugs such as
CNIs, anti-proliferative agents and steroids, that often are
supplemented by induction therapy with non-/depleting
antibodies such as basiliximab, a chimeric monoclonal
anti-CD25-antibody that binds to the a-peptide chain of
the IL-2Ra on the surface of the antigen-activated T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages [2,41]. In the most
recent decade, however, the declining rates of rejection
episodes after kidney transplantation has no longer been

translated into similarly improved rates of graft survival
since better immunosuppression drugs, including basiliximab as induction therapy, have also led to the emergence
of BKVAN, a major cause of renal failure early after kidney
transplantation [31]. Therefore, the aim of our study was
to prospectively investigate BKV load in plasma and urine
samples belonging to a cohort of 60 adult renal transplant
patients, treated with basiliximab and a MMF-based triple
immunotherapy, to evaluate the difference between BKV
replication during the first 3 months post-transplantation,
characterized by the non-depleting action of basiliximab,
versus the second 3 months, in which the induction agent
is not longer detectable and the maintenance therapy acts
alone. In addition we performed sequencing analysis of all
BKV-positive samples to assess whether a particular BKV
subtype/subgroup or TCR variants was present in these
anatomic areas.
The Q-PCR analysis highlighted a significant gradual
increase of both the total number of BKV-positive
patients and the median values of viremia and viruria in

the cohort of kidney transplants during the first month
post-transplantation with a pick in the third month.
Conversely, a significant decrease of the number of individuals with viruria and viremia was observed at 6
months, along with a reduction of the median urinary
and plasma viral loads. Moreover, BK viremia or viruria
did not cause renal dysfunction since graft function
remained stable in all patients during the follow-up
period.
These results could be explained either with the pharmacodynamic properties of basiliximab either with the
change of pharmacokinetic parameters when the antibody
was administered in combination with a dual- or tripleimmunotherapy. As mentioned above, basiliximab binds
specifically to IL-2Ra on CD3+ and CD4+CD25+ cells and
competitively inhibits IL-2 binding to the receptor, thereby
inhibiting IL-2-mediated proliferation of T-cells, a critical
step in the cellular immune response involved in allograft
rejection [2]. In fact, it has been demonstrated that basiliximab reduces the percentage of T-cells expressing IL-2Ra

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/407

in renal transplant recipients from pre-treatment values of
18-44% to < 3% following receptor saturation [2]. Complete saturation of IL-2Ra on circulating CD4+ CD25+
T-cells in renal transplant recipients occurs at serum concentrations of basiliximab > 0.2 mg/mL already 1 day after
administration at the recommended adult dosage of intravenous basiliximab and usually lasts for up to 4-6 weeks
[2,41]. When basiliximab serum concentrations fall below
the 0.2 mg/mL threshold, approximately 30 days after, the
number of T-cells expressing the CD25 antigen returns to
pre-therapy levels in 1-2 weeks [2,41]. It has been demonstrated that in patients receiving a triple immunotherapy
with the addition of MMF, as were the patients of this
study, the clearance of basiliximab is significantly reduced
resulting in a prolonged duration of CD25 saturation (59
days) [42]. Basiliximab pharmacokinetic properties reflect
BKV replication trend: in fact, an increase of BKV replication was observed in our patients during the first 3 months
post-transplantation. Our findings are supported by Koukulaki and colleagues [43], who demonstrated that the
highest incidence of BK viremia and viruria, observed in
the third post-transplantation month, may be related to
immunosuppression induction, along with corticosteroid
doses and/or calcineurin inhibitors therapeutic trough
levels, confirming previously published studies in Europe
and the United States [44,45]. Moreover, the long-term
follow up showed that BKV replication decreased significantly after the third post-transplant month and even transient viremia or viruria did not have an impact on renal
function [43].
However, we cannot exclude that the early post-transplant viremia detected in our patients was due to other
conditions, probably related to graft or recipient features,
although we did not find any relation between BKV infections and recipient, donor or graft characteristics. It could
be also related to the BKV serological status of both
donors and recipients before transplantation, but these
data were not evaluated in this study.
The natural history of BKV infection and reactivation in
transplant recipients is poorly understood. However,
highly effective immunosuppressive treatments are probably the main cause for the virus ability to replicate freely
[46]. Early observations in renal transplant patients with
BKVAN revealed frequent rearrangements of the TCR
genomic region in BKV isolates recovered from various
body compartments, including the urogenital compartment (urine, kidney biopsy specimens) and circulatory
compartment (blood, serum, plasma) [28]. Duplications,
deletions, and/or modifications that arise during reactivation of BKV may affect regulatory protein binding motifs
in the region encompassing the TCR and the origin of
replication [28,47]. These rearrangements may also allow
the virus to adapt to ongoing changes within the host cell
environment by increasing or decreasing the number or

Page 8 of 10

the affinities of host transcription factor binding sites [48].
Specific TCR rearrangements in urine and/or blood might
become the hallmark of a high risk for progression into
BKVAN if they can be linked to biological activities [28].
Therefore, we explored the structure of BKV TCR variants
in urine and blood samples taken from the 60 renal transplant patients enrolled in this study to determine whether
there is any association between TCR variability and the
risk of BKV nephropathy onset, since an apparent association between the presence of rearranged TCR variants and
BKV nephropathy was found [49]. Fortunately, no one of
our recipients developed BKVAN during the first 6
months of follow-up post-transplantation and we always
found archetypal TCR sequences in both urogenital and
circulatory compartment. However, when we compared
the 233 TCR sequences obtained from all BKV-positive
clinical specimens, included those isolated from PBMCs of
blood samples with viremia, to the TCR sequence of the
BKV archetype strain WW, a few single-nucleotide substitutions were found. In particular 148/233 BKV TCR analyzed sequences (63 urine, 85 plasma and 85 PBMCs),
designated WWLA1, showed a few point mutations at
nucleotide positions 18 and 31 within P block (the latter
of which involving the binding site for the transcription
factor NF-1), 4 within R block and 18 within S block,
whereas the remaining 85 (25 urine, 30 plasma and 30
PBMCs), named WWLA2, were characterized by various
nucleotide substitutions at nucleotide positions 18, 19 and
31 within P block, 5, 38 and 40 within R block and 22
within S block, and by the insertion of a single thymidine
nucleotide between nucleotide positions 49 and 50 within
the S block. The point mutations at nucleotide positions
31 within P block and 38 and 40 within R block involved
two NF-1 binding sites, whereas the thymidine insertion
between nucleotides 49 and 50 within the S block interested the ERE binding site. It could be exciting to verify
how these point mutations we detected might affect the in
vitro viral replication.
Interestingly, the point mutations detected in all TCR
analyzed sequences were representative of the particular
subtypes/subgroups we identified by sequencing analysis
of BKV VP1 region, as demonstrated by Yogo et al. [50].
In fact, the nucleotide substitutions detected in the
WWLA1 archetype sequence corresponded to those
found in the consensus TCR sequence for subtype
I/subgroup b-2, when it was compared to the prototypic
TCR sequence defined by Yogo and colleagues [50],
whereas the various nucleotide substitutions and the
single-nucleotide insertion identified in the WWLA2
archetype were typical of the subtype IV/subgroup c.
Therefore, since the TCR of each subtype or subgroup
of BKV has a unique set of nucleotide substitutions and
single-nucleotide insertions (or deletions), the archetypal
TCRs detected in clinical samples should be evaluated

Anzivino et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:407
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/407

with reference to all the subtype- and subgroup-specific
TCRs and not with the TCR of the WW strain, belonging to subtype I/subgroup b-1, that is commonly used
to represent the archetypal TCR of BKV [50].

Conclusions
In conclusion, our results confirm previously published
studies indicating that BKV replication may occur during the early hours after kidney transplantation, reaches
the highest incidence in the third post-transplantation
month and then decreases significantly within the sixth
month [43]. Moreover, monitoring of BKV viremia and
viruria allows to identify renal transplant patients that
could be at risk of BKVAN, since viral re-activation may
occur at any time-point, although it is more likely to
begin in the early period post-transplantation, including
the first hours post-transplantation, maybe as a consequence of the induction therapy. Finally, in association
with viral load determination, it might become clinically
useful whether specific BKV subtypes or rearrangements
could be linked to a particular disease state in order to
develop specific test to detect them before BKVAN
onset, as suggested by some Authors [29,51]. However
larger patient populations and longer follow-up are
necessary.
