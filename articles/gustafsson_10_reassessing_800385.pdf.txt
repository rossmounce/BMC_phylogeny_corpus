Abstract
Background: The temporal origin and diversification of orchids (family Orchidaceae) has been subject to intense
debate in the last decade. The description of the first reliable fossil in 2007 enabled a direct calibration of the orchid
phylogeny, but little attention has been paid to the potential influence of dating methodology in obtaining reliable
age estimates. Moreover, two new orchid fossils described in 2009 have not yet been incorporated in a molecular
dating analysis. Here we compare the ages of major orchid clades estimated under two widely used methods, a
Bayesian relaxed clock implemented in BEAST and Penalized Likelihood implemented in r8s. We then perform a new
family-level analysis by integrating all 3 available fossils and using BEAST. To evaluate how the newly estimated ages
may influence the evolutionary interpretation of a species-level phylogeny, we assess divergence times for the South
American genus Hoffmannseggella (subfam. Epidendroideae), for which we present an almost complete phylogeny (40
out of 41 species sampled).
Results: Our results provide additional support that all extant orchids shared a most recent common ancestor in the
Late Cretaceous (~77 million years ago, Ma). However, we estimate the crown age of the five orchid subfamilies to be
generally (~1-8 Ma) younger than previously calculated under the Penalized Likelihood algorithm and using a single
internal fossil calibration. The crown age of Hoffmannseggella is estimated here at ~11 Ma, some 3 Ma more recently
than estimated under Penalized Likelihood.
Conclusions: Contrary to recent suggestions that orchid diversification began in a period of global warming, our
results place the onset of diversification of the largest orchid subfamilies (Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae) in a
period of global cooling subsequent to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The diversification of Hoffmannseggella
appears even more correlated to late Tertiary climatic fluctuations than previously suggested. With the incorporation of
new fossils in the orchid phylogeny and the use of a method that is arguably more adequate given the present data,
our results represent the most up-to-date estimate of divergence times in orchids.
Background
Orchidaceae is the largest and one of the ecologically and
morphologically most diverse families of flowering plants
[1]. Several ages have been proposed for the origin of
modern orchid lineages (i.e., their crown age), ranging

from ~26 million years (Ma) [2], ~40 Ma [3], ~80 Ma [4]
to as much as ~110 Ma [5]. A correct time estimation is
essential for our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the diversification of orchids, and could contribute to discern between alternative hypotheses of
diversification - such as significant increases in speciation
rates temporally correlated to climatic changes, tectonic
events, or radiation of pollinators.

Many parameters have been identified to affect divergence time estimates in phylogenies, including taxon
sampling, reliability, number and placement of internal
calibration points, and dating method [6-16]. Until
recently, molecular dating of the Orchidaceae has been
challenging due the complete absence of reliable orchid
fossils. The finding of a 15-20 Ma fossil of an extinct
stingless bee (Proplebeia dominicana), covered with
pollinia from an orchid species belonging to the subtribe
Goodyerinae, finally allowed for temporal calibration of
the family [4]. Using this fossil as an internal calibration
point, and departing from a phylogenetic tree obtained
from the analysis of plastid DNA sequences (matK and
rbcL), Ramirez et al. [4] estimated the origin of Orchi-

daceae at 76-84 Ma. These results supported an 'ancient'
origin of orchids in the Late Cretaceous.
Although the study by Ramirez et al. [4] unquestionably
constituted a milestone in orchid research, the large discrepancies in age estimates obtained in the last decade some 80 Ma between the youngest [2] and oldest [5]
crown ages - suggests that the matter is probably not
completely settled. In a recent study in the family Begoniaceae, Goodall-Copestake et al.[16] found that the second largest source of variance in age estimates (after
availability and placement of internal calibration points)
was derived from the choice of dating method employed,
a result consistent with previous evaluations of empirical
data [10,11]. In particular, recent developments in molec-

ular dating techniques have called into question the
assumptions and algorithms implemented in Non-parametric Rate Smoothing [NPRS; [17]] and Penalized Likelihood [PL; [18]] - the two methods employed by Ramirez
et al. [4]. Whereas NPRS has been largely abandoned in
favour of its successor PL [see discussion in [18]], both
implemented in the software r8s [19], PL competes today
in popularity with Bayesian dating [20] implemented in
the software BEAST [21].
PL and BEAST operate in very different ways: i) PL
requires a fixed phylogram as input, whereas BEAST
samples topologies simultaneously as it calculates divergence times under a MCMC analysis, and allows the
choice of several different priors and models; ii) PL
assumes autocorrelation of rates within the phylogeny
(i.e. that mutational rates are inherited, resulting in
closely related taxa exhibiting similar evolutionary rates),
whereas BEAST allows branches to vary in evolutionary
rate; iii) in PL, nodes can be calibrated to be either fixed
to a certain age, or constrained by a maximum or a minimal bound; whereas in BEAST, several additional alternatives are available for calibrating a node, because such
calibrations represent age priors drawn from distributions of various shapes (e.g., normal, lognormal, exponential, or uniform). The methodological and conceptual
differences between r8s, BEAST, and some other meth-

ods available today for molecular dating have been
reviewed by several authors [12,14,22-24].
Although the methodology and assumptions implemented in each molecular dating method can be readily
compared, our knowledge of how time estimates are
influenced by the choice of method is still poor. For
instance, Goodall-Copestake et al.[16] obtained younger
ages in the Begoniaceae using PL than using NPRS, but as
these authors noted the inverse situation was found by
Clement et al. [25,26] on the same taxonomic group.
According to Goodall-Copestake [16], this surprising discrepancy was probably caused by differences in density of
sampled taxa and calibration points. Similarly, it may be
very difficult to predict differences in age estimates using
PL and BEAST: in the study by Goodall-Copestake [16],
PL produced considerably younger ages than BEAST,
whilst the opposite situation was found within family
Caryophyllaceae [26]. These results exemplify the potential influence of methodology on age estimations.
In this study we aim at reassessing the temporal origin
and diversification of Orchidaceae, using the Bayesian
uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock approach implemented in BEAST. In addition to choosing a different dating method, we conduct a new analysis on an expanded
taxon sampling by adding two internal calibration points
in the orchid phylogeny. We base these calibrations on
fossil leaves described subsequent to the study by
Ramirez et al. [4] from Early Miocene deposits of New
Zealand, which were confidently assigned to genera Dendrobium and Earina [27]. Then, to explore how the highlevel age estimates obtained here may affect the evolutionary interpretation of a species-level orchid clade, we
date the origin and diversification of the rare South
American orchid genus Hoffmannseggella.
Hoffmannseggella belongs to the Epidendroideae, the
largest subfamily within Orchidaceae, which comprises
over half of all orchid species [28]. The subfamily has
been divided into 'lower' and 'higher' Epidendroids [29]
and this latter clade includes the monophyletic subtribe
Laeliinae, where Hoffmannseggella is nested [30]. The
genus is endemic to Brazil, where it is confined to the
High Altitude Rocky Complexes (Brazilian Campos Rupestres and Campos de Altitude) of Minas Gerais, Rio de
Janeiro, Espírito Santos and Bahia states. It comprises
exclusively rupicolous species, i.e. growing among rocks
[31]. Adding to the 32 different species recognized by
Chiron and Castro Neto [32], several new species have
recently been described and today Hoffmannseggella
comprises 41 species [31,33-39]. Half of these are "microendemic" - known from a single natural population, and
some only from the type collection. We have been able to
obtain or generate sequences for all but a single species,
thus reaching a 98% complete species sampling.

Results
The maximum credibility tree for the fossil-calibrated
relaxed molecular clock analysis of the family Orchidaceae, using the same matrix and calibration points as
Ramirez et al. [4], is shown in Figure 1. Support values for
the different clades and branches were high, with only a
few values below 0.90 Bayesian posterior probability. Our
age estimates indicate that extant Orchidaceae shared a
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in the Late Cretaceous, ~80 Ma (95% confidence intervals, CI: 56 - 105
Ma). Accordingly, median divergence times for the five
orchid subfamilies currently recognized (Apostasioideae,
Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae) varied between ~31 Ma and ~58 Ma (Table 1).
The most diverse orchid subfamilies Orchidoideae and
Epidendroideae appear to have started to diversify in the
Eocene, 50 Ma (95% CI: 34 - 67 Ma) and 44 Ma (95% CI:
29 - 60 Ma), respectively (Table 1).
Figure 2 shows the maximum credibility tree for the
fossil-calibrated relaxed molecular clock analysis of the
family Orchidaceae including the two new calibration
points (Dendrobium and Earina). Also in this analysis the
support values for most clades were high, with only a few
values below 0.90 Bayesian posterior probability. In
agreement with the previous analysis, our age estimates
indicate that extant Orchidaceae shared a MRCA in the
Late Cretaceous, ~77 Ma (95% confidence intervals, CI:
63 - 92 Ma). Median divergence times for the five orchid
subfamilies ranged from 33 Ma to 57 Ma (Table 1). The
most diverse orchid subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae are inferred also in this analysis to have
started to diversify in the Eocene, 53 Ma (95% CI: 42 - 64
Ma) and 49 Ma (95% CI: 38 - 62 Ma), respectively (Table
1). The median age for the crown 'Higher Epidendroids'
was 39 Ma, with a 95% CI of 31 - 49 Ma. The median
divergence time for the node separating Dendrobium /
Earina was 32 Ma, with a 95% CI of 25 - 40 Ma (Table 1).
The maximum credibility tree for the calibrated relaxed
molecular clock analysis of the 'Higher Epidendroids'
including the genus Hoffmannseggella is shown in Figure
3. All Hoffmannseggella species clustered together with
high support value (posterior probability above 0.90),
supporting the monophyly of the genus. However, the
resolution within the genus was poor, mainly distinguishing two subclades. According to our dating, the genus
Hoffmannseggella shared a MRCA in the Late Miocene,
~11 Ma (95% CI: 5 - 20 Ma) (Figure 3).
Discussion
Evolution of major orchid clades

According to our new estimates based on the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock approach, and incorporating three internal calibration points, extant Orchidaceae
shared a MRCA in the Late Cretaceous, about 77 Ma

Page 8 of 13

(95% CI: 63 - 92 Ma). Except for Orchidoideae, median
age estimates for the remaining orchid subfamilies are
consistently younger in our study as compared to the
youngest mean ages obtained by Ramirez et al. [4] (Table
1). Also in the first analysis where we used the same
matrix as Ramirez et al. [4] and obtained precisely the
same topology for the phylogenetic tree, median age estimates for the five orchid subfamilies are younger (Table
1).
Ramirez et al. [4] proposed a Late Palaeocene radiation
(~56 Ma) for the Orchidaceae, thus during the prominent
temperature increase of the Early Cenozoic (from 59 Ma
to 52 Ma; [40,41]). In contrast, our results suggest a
younger diversification, placing the origin of the two largest orchid subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae
in the Eocene (~53 Ma and ~49 Ma, respectively), thus at
the onset of a long period of temperature decrease [40,41]
(Figure 4). If these estimates are correct, a potential
explanation for the initial radiation of Orchidaceae during the Eocene could be that cooler temperatures
increased the global heterogeneity of ecosystems (e.g.,
with more open and dry habitats), creating new habitats
that could foster adaptive radiation and/or increasing allopatric speciation (e.g.[42]). An alternative or complementary scenario is that the Early Eocene Climatic
Optimum 51-53 Ma [40,41], when mean global temperatures reached ~12°C higher than today's level (Figure 4),
would have caused a wave of large-scale extinction and
thus left many empty ecological niches available for
orchid diversification.
Radiation of the genus Hoffmannseggella

Our estimate for the crown age of Hoffmannseggella indicates a Late Miocene radiation for the genus (~11 Ma;
Figure 3). This is some 3 Ma younger than the dates
obtained using a Penalized Likelihood analysis over a
sample of Bayesian phylograms [43,44] (mean 14.2 Ma,
95% CI: 9.69 - 18.6).
Antonelli et al. [44] postulated a strong correlation
between climate cooling following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum and range expansion and diversification
in Hoffmannseggella. This younger age estimate may
imply an even stronger link than originally conceived,
since the intensity of climatic oscillations augmented
towards the end of the Tertiary [40,41].
Reliability of results

The age estimation of genus Hoffmannseggella is based
on a single, secondary calibration point (the crown group
age of 'Higher Epidendroids' obtained in the high-level
dating analysis), which should have a direct effect on all
internal divergence times. However, the node age estimations between Cattleya and Masdevallia are strikingly
similar in both analyses (25 Ma in the high-level Orchi-

daceae data set, CI:14 - 35; and 26.5 Ma in the Hoffmannseggella data set, CI: 14 - 41). This agreement
provides some cross-validation for the use of the 'Higher
Epidendroids' as a calibration point for the Hoffmannseggella data set.
As outlined in the Introduction, PL and BEAST make
different evolutionary assumptions and have very different algorithms. This precludes categorical assertions on
which of these methods yields the most correct divergence time estimates. One way to assess the autocorrelation assumption made by PL is to examine the covariance
between parent and child branch in each phylogeny. This
value is calculated by the software Tracer v1.4 [45] from
the log files of the MCMC analyses, and should be significantly positive when rates are autocorrelated, and near
zero when there is no evidence of autocorrelation (see
BEAST manual). For the Orchidaceae data set, this covariance had a mean of 0.10 and 95% confidence intervals
ranging from -0.05 to 0.26. Although the covariance has
been criticized as a weak measure of autocorrelation and
more critical discussion on this subject is needed [46], the
low covariance found in this study does not provide positive evidence for autocorrelation, thus favouring the
BEAST results reported here.
Influence of internal fossil calibrations

It is worth noting that the single fossil used by Ramirez et
al. [4], for tribe Goodyerinae, did not influence any age
estimates for Orchidaceae in the BEAST analysis. This is
evident by examining the distribution of ages of the
MRCA of tribe Goodyerinae, which falls outside the
lower age prior of 15 Ma (Figure 5a). In contrast, both
New Zealand fossils affected age estimates, as is apparent
from the age distributions of the two constrained nodes,
truncated at their younger bound 20 Ma (Figure 5b, c).
While the Dendrobium crown age constraint was most
frequently reached during the analyses (Figure 5b), the
Earina stem age constraint was often reached but did not

prevent a normally distributed age distribution with a
mean older than the fossil constraint (Figure 5c).

Conclusions
Molecular dating techniques have greatly improved in the
last years, offering novel opportunities to study the temporal evolution of taxa. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the impact of methodology and other
parameters (taxon sampling, fossil calibrations, sequence
regions) on the reliability of results. This study has shown
that age estimations for orchid clades vary by several million years when using BEAST or Penalized Likelihood.
While the addition of two new internal calibration points
makes our study the most up-to-date estimate of the temporal evolution of orchids, additional studies may be
required before a stable chronogram of this charismatic
plant family is achieved.
Methods
Taxon sampling and genetic markers

In the first analysis for the Orchidaceae family, we used
the matrix compiled by Ramirez et al. [4], including
aligned plastid DNA sequences (matK and rbcL). The
matrix comprised 60 taxa and 2858 characters (see [4] for
a detailed list of included species and GenBank accession
numbers). In the second dating analysis of the Orchidaceae, we used six additional taxa, including sequences
of both matK and rbcL, to allow the use of two recently
described orchid fossils from New Zealand as calibration
points. We also added sequences from four new outgroup
genera, which enabled us to use the stem node of Asparagales as root calibration point, instead of the crown node,
as done by Ramirez et al. [4]. We did this because the oldest fossil used by Ramirez et al. [4] was Liliacidites sp.,
which does not have any diagnostic features of crown
Asparagales. The additional sequences were re-aligned
with those of Ramirez et al. [4], using MAFFT version

Gustafsson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/177

5.64 [47]. The final matrix comprised 70 taxa and 2905
characters (see Table 2 for the additional species and their
corresponding GenBank accession numbers).
For Hoffmannseggella, 40 out of 41 species were sampled (Table 3). The ITS region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) was
sequenced for 14 species to complement the study by van
den Berg et al. [30]. The matrix, including outgroup species selected on the basis of previous phylogenetic analyses [4,30], comprised 56 taxa and 660 characters. No gaps
were coded in any of the matrices.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted exclusively from fresh
plant material using a 2% CTAB protocol (adapted from
[48]). Amplification was performed using PuReTaq™Ready-To-Go™PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences)
for 25 μL reactions using 20 pmol of each primer. The two
primers used were 'P17' (5'-CTACCGATTGAATGGTCCGGTGAA-3') and '26S-82R' (5'-TCCCGGTTCG
CTCGCCGTTACTA3') of [49]. PCR-products were analysed by electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel and purified using QIAquick® PCR Purification Spin Columns
(QIAGEN®). Quantification of the PCR-products was
then done using GeneQuant II (Pharmacia Biotech).
Sequencing was performed using a CEQ™8000 (Genetic
Analysis System, software 8.0, Beckham Coulter®) automated sequencer. Reactions were made with GenomeLab™DTCS-Quick Start Kit (Beckham Coulter®)
according to manufacturer's instructions, except that 10
μL reactions were used, with 50 ng template and 1.6 pmol
per reaction. The two primers used for sequencing ITS
were 'P16b' (5'-CCAYTGAACCTTATCATTKAGAGGA3') of [50] and 'ITS4R' (5'- TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') of [51]. Editing and compilation of the
sequences was done using Sequencher™version 4.1 (Gene
Codes Corporation).
Sequence alignment and dating analyses

The matrix for Orchidaceae [4] was analysed using a
relaxed molecular clock approach with the software
BEAST v1.5.3 [21]. The input data were compiled in
BEAUti v1.5.3 with the tree priors set as follows: i) age for
the monophyletic subtribe Goodyerinae (corresponding
to the age of the fossil orchid pollinia 15 - 20 Ma old; [4]):
uniform prior distribution with a lower bound of 15 Ma
and an upper bound of 120 Ma; ii) age for the root of the
tree (corresponding to the oldest known fossil record for
Asparagales; see discussion in [4]): normal prior distribution with mean 106.5 Ma and standard deviation of 8.21
(giving a 95% CI ranging from 93 - 120 Ma). The second
family-level matrix (with the additional taxa) was analysed with the following tree priors: i) age for the monophyletic subtribe Goodyerinae set as above; ii) the two
additional calibration points for Dendrobium and Earina

Page 11 of 13

set as uniform prior distributions with a lower bound of
20 Ma and an upper bound of 120 Ma (phylogenetic
placement following [27]); iii) age for the root of the tree
set to an uniform prior distribution with a lower bound of
93 Ma and an upper bound of 120 Ma. The upper (maximum) age constraint of 120 Ma for the calibrations above
corresponds to the oldest known monocot fossils [52].
We acknowledge that this constraint may be questionable
since fossils generally provide minimal ages, but in
absence of further evidence such upper bounds are technically advantageous for preventing the root of the tree to
assume unreasonably old ages.
The ITS sequences generated here for 14 Hoffmannseggella species were completely re-aligned with those of van
den Berg et al. [30], along with outgroup sequences from
the 'Higher Epidendroids' downloaded from GenBank.
The alignment was performed using MAFFT version 5.64
[47]. The age for the root of the tree was set to a normal
prior distribution with mean 39 Ma and standard deviation of 5.5 (giving a 95% CI ranging from c. 31 - 49 Ma)
corresponding to the resulting age estimate for the
'Higher Epidendroids' in the second analysis of the Orchidaceae matrix (see under Results).
The Yule process was chosen as speciation process for
all three data sets. The Akaike Information Criterion in
MrModelTest v2.3 [53] was used to choose the best-fitting evolutionary model for each sequence region
(GTR+Γ+I for both partitions in the Orchidaceae data set
and GTR+Γ for ITS in the Hoffmannseggella data set).
Five separate runs were performed in BEAST with 20
million generations each. Log files were analysed with
Tracer v1.5 [45], to assess convergence and confirm that
the combined effective sample sizes for all parameters
were larger than 200, in order to ensure that the MCMC
chain had run long enough to get a valid estimate of the
parameters [54]. All resulting trees were then combined
with LogCombiner v1.5.3, with a burn-in of 25%. A maximum credibility tree was then produced using TreeAnnotator v1.5.3 [21].
