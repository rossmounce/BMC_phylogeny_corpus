Abstract
Recently, we identified a novel porcine circovirus type 2-like agent P1 isolate from swine. The present study
represents the first survey of P1 prevalence in swine herds from Jiangsu, China, by using PCR targeting the
complete genome of P1. Prevalences of 50% and 19% were found among 6 herds and 248 animals, respectively.
The results indicate a high prevalence of P1 in China pig populations.

Introduction
Porcine circovirus (PCV), belonging to the family Circoviridae, is a small non-enveloped virus with a circular,
single-stranded DNA genome. To date, two types of
porcine circoviruses have been recognized: PCV1 and
PCV2. PCV1 was originally isolated from the porcine
kidney cell line PK15 [1] and did not induce a disease in
swine [2], while PCV2 has recently been identified as
the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting
syndrome (PMWS) [3,4]. The major clinical signs of
PMWS are progressive wasting and growth retardation,
pallor of the skin, and occasional icterus [5,6].
PCV2-like agent (designated P1) was discovered by
accident in 2007 from the serum of the porcine with
PMWS by PCR assay. Briefly, a pair of primers was
designed according to the nucleotide sequence of PCV2
ORF2 (AF381175): forward primer F1 (5’-ACGGATATTGTAGTCCTGGT-3’) and reverse primer R1 (5’CAAGGCTACCACAGTCAGAA-3’). This pair of primers amplifies a 472-bp DNA fragment of PCV2. Unexpectedly, a truncated amplicon with 1 nucleotide
deletions was generated by DNA sequencing, which will
result in frameshift mutation and a premature termination codon of ORF2 protein synthesis. According to the
results above, we suspected that the existence of the

agent related with ORF2 sequences of PCV2 might be
possible. Thus, inverse PCR was carried out with a pairs
of primers based on DNA sequence of the amplicon, F2:
5’-TGTAGACCACGTAGGCCTCGG-3’, R2: 5’-GGTTT
GTATCCTCAGCCAAAG-3’. Then, the sequences of
PCR generated fragments were assembled into consecutive sequence by using DNAMAN software (Version
5.2.2, Lynnon Biosoft, 1994).
Using inverse PCR bands should only be amplified if
the agent genome is circular. The exception to this
would be if there was non-specific binding of one of the
primers. This is very unlikely when fragments have been
amplified with two different primer sets but we still
designed another pair of primers based on the
sequences assembled to amplify the agent complete genome containing overlapping regions to verify.

The novel PCV2-like agent (P1) was determined with
a circle DNA genome of 648 nucleotides. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus P1 closely related to
the known virus is PCV. It showed 98.42% of nucleotide
homology with PCV2 BF isolate. The partial sequence
data of P1 have been submitted to GenBank (EF514716),
except 5’terminal 22 nt—————"ggatccactagtaacggccgcc”. P1 genome has three possible open reading frames (ORF), capable of encoding amino acids of
12.5 kD (ORF1), 3.0 kD (ORF2) and 3.9 kD (ORF3),
respectively [7]. P1 has high homologous sequences of

ORF2 of PCV2 and ORF3 of P2, another novel porcine
circovirus-like agent [8]. The genome structure suggests
that P1 and P2 might belong to a new virus family. So
far, Very little is known about the epidemiology of P1.
Therefore, the main objective of the present work was
to determine the prevalence of P1.

Materials and methods
Initially, 248 pig sera corresponding to 6 non-related,
different size herds sampled during years 2009 and 2010
were used for this study. Specifically, these consisted of
4 herds (A, B, C, D) in 2009, and 2 herd (E, F) in 2010,
and the herds were located in the north western (Su
qian), eastern (yancheng and Nantong), southern and
central (Nanjing, zhenjiang, and wuxi) parts of Jiangsu
province (Figure 2). The pigs were between 10 and 120
days of age and submitted to clinic examination because
of different clinicopathological conditions, including
wasting, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, and ochrodermia. Sera samples were stored at -20°C for viral DNA
extraction and PCR analysis.
For the viral DNA extraction, 300 μL of cell lysis buffer (20 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)
and 200 μg/ml proteinase K) was mixed with the 300
μL serum. Thoroughly vortexed and incubated at 50°C
for 2 h. Following incubation, DNA was extracted by
conventional phenol -chloroform methods.
The specific P1 DNA was determined by using onestep PCR assay targeting complete nucleotide sequence
of viral DNA-genome. The primers used for PCR reactions were previously designed [7]. Briefly, the PCR was
performed in a 25 μL final volume containing 2.5 μL of
viral template DNA, 10 pmol of forward primer F3 and
reverse primer R3, 2.5 mM dNTPs and 0.75 U DNA
Polymerase. The amplification was performed using a
PCR thermal cycler (TaKaRa) and was initiated by heating for 5 min at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 58°C for 45 s, and
elongation at 72°C for 45 s. The reaction ended with a
final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Finally, 15 μL of
PCR product was run on 1.5% TAE-agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL). Positive DNA fragments of specific size (approximately 660 bp) were
excised from the agarose gel and purified by using AxyPrep™ DNA Gel Extraction kit (Hangzhou, China), and
finally TA-cloned into vector pMD-18 T (TaKaRa) for
sequencing. Three or 4 PCR positive samples for each
pig herd were selected for sequence identification.
Results
Of the 248 serum specimens obtained from swine, 47
(19%) were P1-positive by PCR assay, whilst 3(50%)
were positive for P1 among 6 farms. Prevalence values
vary from 0% to 50% in pig herds. The prevalence

results of P1 in six different geographical regions in
Jiangsu are shown in Table 1. P1 infection rate of the
pigs differed with their ages as Table 2. There was significant difference on the prevalence of different age
stage, being 50.0% (13/26) (10-30 days), 11.1% (3/27)
(40-60 days), 22.2% (6/27) (70-90 days) and 16.0% (4/25)
(100-120 days), respectively. 10-30 days has the highest
number of infected pigs in herd F infected with P1.
Some of the PCR products were cloned and
sequenced. All of the P1 strains was 648 bp in size and
shared more than 97.2% nucleotide homology with the
isolated P1 strain submitted to GenBank (EF514716).

Discussion
PMWS, a new emerging and multifactorial disease in
swine, was first recognized in North America in 1991
[9]. Since then, this disease has been diagnosed globally
and devastated almost every pig-producing area of the
world [10]. A role of PCV2 in the etiology of PMWS
was first observed in Canada in 1991, and described in
the late 1990s. Although PCV2 infection has been associated with PMWS, the role of PCV2 infection in the
pathogenesis of PMWS is uncertain. To date, PCV-2
infection is regarded as a necessity in PMWS cases,
other cofactors are necessary to evoke disease. PMWSaffected pigs exhibit a wide spectrum of concomitant
infections with PCV2, such as porcine parvovirus
[11,12], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus (PRRSV) [13,14], TTV [15] and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [16], all may enhance PCV2-associated
lesions and develop whole complex clinical symptom of
PMWS under experimental and field conditions [17].
The difficulties in reproducing the full spectrum of
clinical signs and lesions associated with PMWS using
PCV2 alone have resulted in a hypothesis that PMWS
may be triggered by an unknown pathogen, popularly
termed ‘agent X’, Of course, no such novel agent has
been identified until now [18]. The finding of novel
viral agents in the PMWS disease is challenging since
there still are many open questions concerning the
aetiology of the syndrome. From all the studied animals in the present study, 3 were co-infected with
both PCV2 and P1, 10 were positive for PCV2 only
(data not shown). Therefore, further studies needs to
be conducted in order to see if the presence of the
novel agent P1 described here, contributes to the
development of PMWS solely and/or in synergy with
PCV-2.
PCR was proved to be a useful tool for detecting
PCV2 in clinical specimens because of its speed, specificity, and sensitivity. But challenges encountered by its
specificity as to P1 occurrence, most of PCR assay
reported previously would target the ORF2 region of the
PCV2 genome, which shared high similarity nucleotide

sequence with ORF1 of P1. It is vital to determine
whether those PCR amplification fragments were produced by PCV2 or by P1. The PCR assay described here
should provide the ability to identify and differentiate
between PCV2 and P1 and screen pigs for P1 infection.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on epidemiology of P1 in China. Of course, to obtain the complete

genome sequence of P1 and aid in further analysis of
genomic features of P1, we used the pairs of primers F3
and R3 including an overlapping region in this study.
Rather than amplify the entire 648 nt of P1, designing
some primers amplifying smaller products may improve
the sensitivity of the assay and be more suitable for epidemiological investigation of P1.

In a previous study, 1.8% (5/278) of studied swine sera
from China was shown to be P1-positive by a PCR
detecting [7]. The difference in the prevalence of P1
(19%, 47/248) obtained in our present study indicate
that the P1 infection has became popular in pig herds.

Of course, very low copies of P1 DNA were also
detected in some sera samples, the biological importance of the virus remains to be elucidated.
In summary, the present work contributes to the
understanding of P1 epidemiology, including the

establishment of PCR assay described here. Taking into
account the present results, it seems evident that P1
infection is already widespread in Jiangsu and those 1030 days old pigs seem more likely to be infected with
P1. Further studies should be investigated in larger scale
data in order to determine the biological importance of
P1.
