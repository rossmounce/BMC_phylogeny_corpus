Abstract
The c-Myb protein is a transcriptional regulator initially identified by homology to the v-Myb
oncoprotein, and has since been implicated in human cancer. The most highly conserved portion
of the c-Myb protein is the DNA-binding domain which consists of three imperfect repeats. Many
other proteins contain one or more Myb-related domains, including a number of proteins that do
not bind directly to DNA. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of diverse classes of Myb-related
domains and discovered a highly conserved patch of acidic residues common to all Myb-related
domains. These acidic residues are positioned in the first of three alpha-helices within each of the
three repeats that comprise the c-Myb DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, these conserved acidic
residues are present on a surface of the protein which is distinct from that which binds to DNA.
Alanine mutagenesis revealed that the acidic patch of the third c-Myb repeat is essential for
transcriptional activity, but neither for nuclear localization nor DNA-binding. Instead, these acidic
residues are required for efficient chromatin binding and interaction with the histone H4 Nterminal tail.

Background
In vertebrates, c-Myb (MYB), A-Myb (MYBL1), and B-Myb
(MYBL2) comprise the Myb gene family. Myb proteins
encoded by these genes serve essential roles in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (reviewed in [1]).
Studies of c-Myb null and hypomorphic mutant mice have
delineated an essential role in hematopoiesis and in the
maintenance of intestinal epithelium [2,3]. A-Myb null
mutant mice display abnormal spermatogenesis and
mammary gland proliferation [4]. B-Myb null mice suffer
from embryonic lethality at the 8-cell stage, suggesting an
essential role for B-Myb in cell proliferation that is consistent with the expression of B-Myb in all proliferating cell
types [5]. Importantly, aberrant expression of these Myb
genes occurs in a variety of human malignancies includ-

ing leukemias, lymphomas, breast, colon, brain, pancreatic, and lung cancers (reviewed in [1]).
Proteins in the Myb family share conservation of both an
N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The Myb DBD is composed of
three imperfect helix-turn-helix repeats and Myb-related
proteins have one or more of these Myb-like repeats [6].
In plants, Myb-related repeats have been utilized in hundreds of DNA-binding transcription factors [7]. Other
Myb-related proteins serve an assortment of nuclear functions, including chromatin remodeling (SWI3, RSC,
ISWI), covalent histone modification (ADA2, NCoR),
basal transcription (TFIIIB-B', SNAPC4), transcriptional
silencing (REB1, TTF1, RAP1), telomere regulation (TAZ1,

TRF1, TRF2, RAP1), and RNA splicing (CDC5). Surprisingly, some of these proteins have conserved Myb-like
repeats, but do not utilize this domain to bind DNA [1,6].
Deletion and mutational analysis of such Myb-related
repeats has implicated these domains in histone binding
[8-11].
While it is tempting to think of DNA-binding domains
(DBDs) of proteins as specialized building blocks with a
singular DNA-binding function, the multifunctional
nature of such domains has previously been reported
(reviewed in [12]). In this regard, the distantly Mybrelated RAP1 DBD also has nucleosome binding activity
and the capacity to alter chromatin structure [13].
Remarkably, although deletion of the entire yeast RAP1
gene was lethal, the expression of the Myb-related RAP1
DBD alone was sufficient to restore viability [14]. These
results imply that the RAP1 DBD has critical function(s)
in addition to simply binding to DNA.
Previous studies have provided evidence for non-DNAbinding functions of the vertebrate Myb DBD, as well. For
example, insertional mutations or a cysteine-to-serine
substitution within the v-Myb DBD disrupt transcriptional activation and oncogenic transformation without
affecting nuclear localization or DNA-binding [15,16].
Consistent with these observations, the Myb DBD has
been reported to specifically interact with the DBD of the
C/EBPα transcriptional activator, the DBD of the c-Maf
protein, and with Cyclin D [17-20].
Intrigued by the presence of Myb-related repeats in so
many nuclear proteins, especially those lacking specific
DNA-binding capacity, we reasoned that residues conserved among this larger group of Myb-related proteins
might uncover novel functions for the c-Myb DBD. By
performing alignments of Myb-related repeats of both
DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding proteins, we discovered patches of highly conserved acidic residues. Alanine
mutagenesis of these residues in each c-Myb repeat identified an important role in transcriptional activation for the
acidic patch in the third c-Myb repeat independent of
nuclear localization or DNA-binding. Rather, the acidic
motif in the c-Myb third repeat was required for chromatin association in vivo and for binding to the histone H4
tail in vitro. Furthermore, these data suggest that the acidic
patches of Myb-related repeats in other proteins may also
function in chromatin binding and/or histone association.

Results
Myb-related domains contain a conserved acidic patch
Myb-related repeats are conserved in a variety of proteins
with very different nuclear functions. Whether the duplication and retention of many genes encoding Myb-related

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/77

repeats occurred due to the presence of a versatile structural scaffold or whether the preservation of this domain
took place due to a conserved biochemical function
remains unknown. To determine if conservation of nonstructural residues occurred within the diverse array of
Myb-related proteins, we created and analyzed alignments
of the amino acid sequences of Myb repeats from all
known Myb-related protein families. Each Myb-related
repeat contains three highly conserved helices connected
by two turns/loops that are variable in both sequence and
length [6]. Solved structures of several Myb-related
domains have revealed that the length, orientation, and
spatial organization of the three helices are very similar to
the structure of the c-Myb repeats [11,21-23]. Therefore,
to align Myb-related repeats from many different proteins
we deleted the turn/loop regions and aligned the helices
using the ClustalX program [24]. The residues most highly
conserved among all Myb-related proteins are those
involved in forming the hydrophobic core (tryptophan
residues at position four, nineteen, and thirty-six in Figure
1A), indicating that structural integrity of the domain is
essential for both DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding
Myb repeat functions. Consistent with this structural preservation is the presence of a highly conserved salt bridge
between an acidic residue at position eight and a basic residue at position twenty-six (asterisks in Figure 1A).
Aside from residues essential for structural integrity, the
most conserved residues among all Myb domains are a
stretch of acidic amino acids near the beginning of the first
helix (shown in red in helix I, Figure 1A). Remarkably,
these acidic amino acids are more highly conserved than
residues involved in DNA binding. Glutamic/aspartic acid
residues are often present at positions six through ten, but
the highest concentration of acidic residues occurs consistently at positions seven through nine. This acidic patch
includes the highly conserved salt bridge at position eight,
but the conserved adjacent acidic residues do not have a
known role in structural integrity or DNA binding.
DNA-binding domains typically exhibit a strongly basic
character in order to form ionic bonds with the phosphate
backbone of the DNA double helix, making the presence
of a patch of highly conserved acidic residues in the Myb
DBD rather unusual. Because these acidic residues are also
present in non-DNA-binding Myb-related repeats, we
hypothesized that these residues might be important for
protein-protein rather than protein-DNA interactions.
Consistent with such a model is the localization of these
conserved acidic residues on a surface facing away from
the DNA within the c-Myb crystal structure (shown in red
in Figure 1B) [18]. The positions of these acidic patches
are conserved in the structures of the distantly Mybrelated RAP1 and TRF2 proteins; once again these residues
face away from the DNA (Figure 1C) [22,23].

Amino acid alignments of Myb-related repeats display high conservation of structural residues and an acidic
patch in the first helix. A. We created a multiple sequence alignment of Myb repeats using ClustalW and color coded the
alignments based on conservation using the BioEdit program. Labeling of Myb-repeats indicates genus and species with the first
two letters, followed by the protein name. For proteins containing multiple Myb-motifs, repeats are numbered starting from
the N-terminus and identified after an underscore. Residues known to bind DNA of c-Myb (c-Myb DNAB) second repeat (R2)
and third repeat (R3) are depicted in bold on the first two lines, those interacting with DNA bases are in black and those associating with the phosphate backbone are in grey. Note the high conservation of acidic residues in the first helix compared to cMyb DNA-binding residues. Species and genus abbreviations: Hs = Homo sapiens, Dm = Drosophila melanogaster, Ce =
Caenorhabditis elegans, Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae. B. The crystal structure of the c-Myb DNA-binding domain bound to
DNA is shown [18]. The first repeat (R1) is depicted in yellow, the second repeat (R2) in purple, and the third repeat (R3) in

of the protein consistent with a protein-protein interaction motif. C. Myb-repeats from the solved c-Myb third repeat (cMyb_R3) [18], yeast Rap1 first repeat (Rap1_R1) [22], and human Trf2 [23]. For each repeat, one is looking down the barrel of
the first helix (bottom) with the second helix on the left and the third helix on the right. The conserved acidic residues are
depicted in red. Conserved salt bridges are shown between the acidic residue in the first helix (red) and a basic residue in the
third helix (green).

A conserved acidic patch is required for transcriptional
activation by c-Myb
To explore the function of these highly conserved acidic
residues, we performed alanine mutagenesis of the acidic
patch in each of the three repeats of chicken c-Myb.
Mutant proteins were analyzed for expression, stability,
nuclear localization, DNA-binding, and transcriptional

activity. Table 1 summarizes the results of these assays for
mutants in all three c-Myb repeats. In particular, we tested
the ability of each mutant to transcriptionally activate a
luciferase reporter regulated by five tandem high-affinity
Myb-binding sites (A site) from the mim-1 target gene
placed upstream of a minimal E1b TATA box (EW5-E1bLuciferase reporter) [25,26]. This reporter was co-trans-

fected with wild-type or mutant c-Myb expression plasmids into the QT6 quail fibroblast cell line. These cells
have the advantages of having no endogenous c-Myb
expression and of being highly transfectable. We found
that mutagenesis of acidic residues without a known role
in structural stability (i.e. participation in salt bridges) did
not disrupt transcriptional activity for the first (R1) and
second (R2) c-Myb repeats (see Additional File 1; data
summarized in Table 1). However, because two adjacent
acidic residues in both R1 and R2 are involved in salt
bridge formation (asterisks in Additional File 1), it was
difficult to evaluate the function of the acidic patch independent of the structural contributions of these residues.
The third repeat has a single conserved acidic residue
involved in a salt bridge (asterisks in Figure 2A) and disruption of this salt bridge not surprisingly led to loss of
transcriptional activity (mR3-2 in Table 1). However,
third repeat mutants with intact salt bridges but with
mutation of the two or three adjacent acidic residues
(mR3-1, mR3-3, Figure 2A) demonstrated a dramatic
reduction of transcriptional activity to one-quarter and
one-tenth that of wild-type c-Myb, respectively (Figure 2C;
see also Additional File 1). Interestingly, the reduction in
activity of the third repeat mutants appeared to correlate
with the amount of negative charge eliminated. The mR33 mutant lost three negatively charged residues and displayed less activity than mR3-1 which was missing two
charged residues. In order to further understand the nonstructural function of the acidic patch, we therefore
focused our analyses on these two mutants of the third
repeat.
Carboxy-terminal domains of c-Myb have been reported
to negatively regulate transcriptional activation through
intramolecular interactions with the DBD [27-30]. The
conserved C-terminal domain also negatively regulates
the c-Myb transcriptional activation domain, independent of interactions with the DNA-binding domain [28]. In
order to isolate the DBD from effects of C-terminal
sequences, we used a truncated c-Myb protein (c-MybΔ in
Figure 2B) containing the DBD and c-Myb transcriptional
activation domain but missing the C-terminal negative
regulatory domain. The mR3-3 truncated protein had a
defect in transcriptional activity similar to the full length
mR3-3 protein when compared to their respective wildtype proteins, indicating that the C-terminal sequences do
not contribute to the mR3-3 phenotype (Figure 2C).
Another concern was that mutation of the acidic residues
may affect DNA-binding. We reasoned that if the c-Myb
DBD could still bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion, then fusion of the c-Myb DBD to the strong VP16
activation domain would overcome the transcriptional
defect of the mutant protein. Indeed, fusion of the mR3-3
mutant DBD to the VP16 activation domain rescued its

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/77

transcriptional activity (Figure 2C). These data indicate
that this acidic patch mutant of the c-Myb DBD is still
capable of interacting with DNA in vivo.
Analysis of multiple western blots revealed no significant
difference in the stability of these mutants relative to wild
type c-Myb (Table 1; see also Additional File 1). Furthermore, transcriptional activity was measured at saturating
levels of wild-type and mutant c-Myb. Therefore, the
decreased activity of the mR3-1 and mR3-3 mutants is an
intrinsic property of these proteins.
Third repeat c-Myb acidic patch mutants localize to the
nucleus and bind DNA in vitro
Previous experiments used deletion analysis to define two
nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the DBD and in
another region of the v-Myb protein [31]. We utilized a
Myb-specific antibody to perform immunofluorescence of
QT6 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant c-Myb
expression vectors to determine if the acidic residues were
important for nuclear localization. The wild-type and
third repeat acidic patch mutants all localized to the
nucleus, were excluded from the nucleolus, and appeared
to concentrate in more euchromatic regions of DNA
delineated by areas that stained less brightly by propidium iodide [see Additional File 2]. Replacement of the Cterminus by the VP16 activation domain or truncation of
the C-terminus did not affect this localization (data not
shown).

Since mutations were made in the DNA-binding domain,
determining the ability of mutant proteins to bind DNA
provides an essential and stringent control for structural
stability. We expected disruption of salt bridges to interrupt DNA-binding. However, alanine mutants with intact
salt bridges should maintain their ability to bind DNA
since these mutations are clustered on the non-DNAbinding surface and are not predicted to affect structural
stability. The observation that fusion to the VP16 activation domain rescues reporter gene activation by mR3-1
and mR3-3 was consistent with the ability of the mutant
DNA binding domains to associate with DNA. In addition, we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a
single high-affinity Myb-binding site with nuclear extracts
containing either wild-type or mutant c-Myb VP16 fusion
proteins. The c-Myb-VP16 fusions were less susceptible to
proteolysis in lysates than the full length proteins, and
therefore were ideal for these studies.
As expected, DNA-binding by the mutant proteins
required intact salt bridges but was not disrupted by mutation of other acidic residues. In particular, mR3-1 and
mR3-3 mutant proteins bound the oligonucleotide at levels similar to those of wild-type while disruption of the

binding domain
The mR3-3 is previous in transcriptional activation and this phenotype can be rescued by VP16 fusion to the mutant DNAThe mR3-3 is defective in transcriptional activation and this phenotype can be rescued by VP16 fusion to the
mutant DNA-binding domain. A. Alanine mutagenesis of the third c-Myb repeat was performed to analyze the structural
and functional contributions of the acidic patch in the first helix of each repeat. Three mutants of the third repeat (mR3-1,2,3)
were constructed: mR3-1 preserved the salt bridge and converted two acidic residues to alanines, mR3-2 eliminated the salt
bridge, and mR3-3 preserved the salt bridge and changed all three acidic residues not involved in salt bridges to alanines. B. The
diagram identifies the positions of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the transcriptional activation domain (TA), and the C-terminal negative regulatory domain. The DNA-binding domain consists of three imperfect repeats labeled R1, R2, and R3. The
truncated form of c-Myb (c-MybΔ) is missing the negative regulatory domain. c-MybVP represents the c-Myb DBD fused to the
VP16 activation domain. C. Vector only (v/o), wild type (wt) c-Myb, or the mR3-3 c-Myb mutant constructs in (A) were tested
for transcriptional activation of the EW5-E1b-Luciferase reporter. Luciferase activity for each of the mutant c-Myb constructs
was normalized for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity from a cotransfected CMV-β-galactasidase plasmid. The wild-type c-Myb values were then set to 100% for each class of proteins and the mutants were scaled accordingly,
allowing the comparison of multiple experiments and comparison of c-Myb, c-MybΔ, and c-MybVP. Before normalization the
wild-type c-MybΔ and c-MybVP had a transcriptional activity 100× and 1000× greater than the full length c-Myb, respectively.

salt bridge in the mR3-2 mutant led to defective DNAbinding (Figure 3A). The DNA-binding activity of mutants
in the first and second repeats was also dependent on the
protein having intact salt bridges and is summarized in
Table 1. western blot analysis indicated the presence of
similar levels of wild-type and mutant proteins in these
lysates (Figure 3B). In addition, similar affinities for specific DNA binding were observed with purified recombinant wild type and mutant c-Myb DBD produced in E.
coli [see Additional File 3]. Together these results imply
that the acidic residues in the third c-Myb repeat that are
not involved in salt bridge formation have no effect on
binding DNA in vitro or in vivo.
The mR3-3 mutant is defective for activation of an
endogenous target gene and cannot be rescued by the
VP16 activation domain
The experiments described above measured transcriptional activation of transiently transfected reporter genes.
However, previous studies have reported structural and
functional differences between transiently transfected and
genomic templates (reviewed in [32]). These differences
may reflect inefficient chromatinization of transient templates as well as differences in regulation of supercoiling.
Therefore, it was important to test the ability of our
alanine mutants to activate expression of an endogenous
target gene. We used RT-PCR analysis to determine
whether the third repeat mutant could activate the expression of endogenous mim-1, a well-studied target of c-Myb
whose activation depends on collaboration between cMyb and C/EBPα [33]. Either wild type or mR3-3 mutant
c-Myb was transfected into HD11 cells, macrophages
which express endogenous C/EBPα but not c-Myb. We
performed RT-PCR with specific primers to detect mim-1
expression and then normalized for total RNA using βactin expression. RT-PCR on 10-fold serial dilutions of
total RNA revealed that the wild-type c-Myb protein activated the endogenous mim-1 gene as expected, the prod-

uct being detectable at a 1:1000 dilution of total RNA
(Figure 4). However, activation of mim-1 expression by
mR3-3 was undetectable at all dilutions tested. Thus, the
acidic patch in the third repeat is essential for activation of
this endogenous target.
Since fusion of the VP16 transcriptional activation
domain rescued the ability of the mR3-3 mutant to activate a transfected reporter gene (Figure 2), we wondered if
it would have a similar effect on endogenous gene activation. RT-PCR of total RNA from HD11 cells expressing
wild-type or mR3-3 c-Myb-VP16 fusions revealed that the
wild-type c-Myb-VP16 fusion could collaborate with C/
EBPα to activate mim-1 expression, but the mR3-3 VP16
fusion could not activate transcription in the context of
native chromatin (Figure 4).
The ability of the mR3-3 mutant to interact with native
chromatin is impaired
Since VP16 was able to rescue the mR3-3 transcriptional
defect on a transiently transfected reporter but not on an
endogenous gene, we suspected a defect in the ability of
mR3-3 to associate with a fully chromatinized template.
To test this hypothesis we performed protein chromatin
immunoprecipitation (PChIP) assays that examine global
association with chromatin by determining if a specific
non-histone protein has a decreased capacity to pull down
nucleosomes [see Additional File 4]. An advantage of this
assay is that it provides a robust signal, allowing the experiment to be done without the use of stably expressing cell
lines. Such experiments provide a more rigorous test of
global chromatin association than assaying a single DNA
site or a subset of sites, but cannot discriminate between
differences on specific promoters.

Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors
for Flag-tagged wild-type c-Myb, mR3-3 c-Myb, or a vector
only control. The cells were fixed with formaldehyde and

The mR3-3
The mR3-3 mutant is defective in activating the mim-1 endogenous target gene and cannot be rescued by the
VP16 activation domain. PCR was performed on ten fold serial dilutions of cDNA with primers specific for the mim-1 (676
bp) and β-actin (823 bp) genes. For mim-1 1:10^1;, 1:10^2;, and 1:10^3; dilutions are shown. For β-actin 1:10^2;, 1:10^3;,
1:10^4;, 1:10^5;, and 1:10^6; dilutions are shown. Expression of β-actin reveals that a similar amount of total RNA was used for
each sample. Expression of mim-1 at a 1:10^3; dilution was detected for the full length wild-type c-Myb but no expression at
any dilution was found for mR3-3. Complete absence of target gene activation was found for the mR3-3 DBD fused to VP16,
while the wild-type c-MybVP did induce mim-1 expression. The 1 Kb Plus DNA molecular weight marker (Invitrogen) flanks
each of the mim-1 samples and is at the left side of the β-actin gel. Sizes are 12,000 to 3000 bp for the top cluster of bands,
then 2000 (arrows), 1650, 1000, 850, 650, and 500 bp for the lower bands.

cell lysates were sonicated to produce chromatin fragments of 100–300 bp in length [see Additional File 4].
Sonicated chromatin fragments were roughly the size of a
single nucleosome; therefore, histones present in Mybbound chromatin fragments represent the population of
single nucleosomes bound by Myb. Anti-Flag-agarose
beads were used to pull down Myb-bound chromatin
fragments. Western blot analysis confirmed specific
immunoprecipitation of Flag-c-Myb and Flag-mR3-3 at
similar levels [see Additional File 4].
Since we suspected that the mR3-3 mutant had a defect in
association with chromatin, we first looked at the fraction
of core histones associated with mR3-3 compared to the
wild-type c-Myb. Representative western blots are shown
with quantitation of western blots from several lysates
(Figure 5A and 5B). Quantitation of western-blots for H3,
H4 and H2A showed a roughly 50% decrease in association of mR3-3 with core histones compared to wild-type
c-Myb (Figure 5B). These results indicate a defect of the

mR3-3 mutant proteins to bind native chromatin. Since
this assay analyzes global chromatin binding one cannot
differentiate between a partial defect of the mutant to
associate with all binding sites and a complete defect in
binding to half of the sites. Nevertheless, the fact that this
effect is observed on a global chromatin fraction suggests
that the acidic patch serves an important and global function in chromatin association by c-Myb.
Covalent modification of histones by acetyl, methyl,
phosphate, ubiquitin, and sumo groups regulates nuclear
processes including transcription, silencing, replication,
and repair [34]. Work in this field supports a model in
which these modifications provide a molecular blueprint,
termed the histone code, for nuclear function at particular
chromatin sites. For example, methylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 at lysine four (K4) is characteristic
of active genes and the presence of euchromatin. A wellstudied mark of heterochromatin is methylation at lysine
nine (K9) of the histone H3 tail which provides a docking

The mR3-3 c-Myb mutant has impaired chromatin binding
The mR3-3 c-Myb mutant has impaired chromatin binding. A. Western analysis was used to determine the amounts
of core histones present in the vector only control (v/o), wild-type c-Myb (wt), and mR3-3 (mR3) chromatin immunoprecipitation fractions. Data displayed used antibodies directed at histone H3 (Abcam) and histone H4 (Upstate). Input and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) fractions are shown at different exposures. B. The relative amounts of core histones from several
blots similar to those shown in (A) were quantitated and normalized for background using the ImageJ program http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. Wild-type levels were set to 100% and the mutants were normalized to this level for adequate comparison
between different experiments. The plots shown represent an average of two separate experiments for H2A and five separate
experiments for H3. The H4 antibody was used for only one experiment but is consistent with results for the other core histones. C. We compared the amount of H3-acetyl R18 (H3-AcR18) and H3-acetyl K23 (H3-AcK23) modifications present in
the wild-type and mR3-3 bound nucleosomes using specific anti-H3-acetyl R18 and K23 antibodies (Upstate). Labeled as in A.
Inputs are shown at a different exposure than chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) samples and confirm that samples have
similar amounts of input protein.

site for HP-1 (heterochromatin protein-1) and facilitates
chromatin compaction. Thus, these two modifications
provide a means of analyzing euchromatic and heterochromatic nuclear compartments. Analysis of wild-type cMyb bound nucleosomes with antibodies to specific H3
modifications showed that both H3-dimethyl K4 (mainly
euchromatin) and H3-dimethyl K9 (mainly heterochromatin) were present in wild-type c-Myb fractions (data
not shown). Since the H3-dimethyl K9 modification can
occur at lower levels in euchromatin, we confirmed our
result with an antibody to H3-trimethyl K9 which localizes virtually exclusively to heterochromatin. The mR3-3
bound nucleosome fraction revealed reduced association
with H3-dimethyl K4, dimethyl K9, and trimethyl K9
compared to wild-type c-Myb. The relative amount of
modified histones in the mutant compared to wild-type cMyb samples showed a reduction similar to that observed
for the total core histones. These results indicate that the
defect in association with chromatin of the mR3-3 c-Myb
occurs in both the euchromatic and heterochromatic
regions.
c-Myb directly binds to the CBP/p300 histone acetylase
complexes leading to acetylation of histone H3 arginine
eighteen (R18) and lysine twenty-three (K23) at c-Myb
dependent promoters [35,36]. We found that nucleosomes marked by acetylation of acetylated H3-R18 and
H3-K23 were bound 50–70% less by the mR3-3 mutant
than by wild-type c-Myb protein, consistent with the
binding results for total core histones (Figure 5C). Similar
results were found with antibodies to H3-acetyl lysine
nine (K9), lysine fourteen (K14), and H3-dimethyl
arginine seventeen (R17) (data not shown). All of our
results support a defect in global chromatin association
for the mR3-3 mutant, indicating the acidic patch in the cMyb R3 serves an important function in binding to native
chromatin in vivo.

Defective H4 tail binding by mR3-3 c-Myb mutant
An impaired ability to bind to specific histone protein(s)
rather than whole nucleosomes constitutes one possible
explanation for the observed defect in chromatin binding.
Therefore, we tested the ability of the wild-type and the
mR3-3 mutant c-Myb DBD to bind histone tails. Association with histone tails makes biological sense for transcriptional regulators because histone tails extend out of
the core nucleosomal particle, are essential for higher
order chromatin folding, and are targets of many posttranslational modifications [37,38]. Thus, opening of
chromatin structure or reading of the histone code
requires interaction with the histone amino termini. We
used GST-yeast histone tail fusions in pull down assays
with 35S-labeled in vitro translated c-Myb DBD [39]. Wildtype c-Myb activates transcription from integrated
reporter genes in yeast, demonstrating that c-Myb is capable of interacting with yeast chromatin in vivo [25]. Furthermore, histones are highly conserved between yeast
and vertebrates (Figure 6A; see also Additional File 5). A
single conservative amino acid substitution exists between
the yeast and human H4 tail (residue 22, Figure 6A) and
the H3 tail has only two conservative changes (residues 23
and 32, Figure 6A). H2A and H2B are less conserved [see
Additional File 5]. The H2A tail is 56% identical and 72%
similar between yeast and human. The H2B tail is the
most divergent between yeast and human, being only
41% identical and 50% similar 6.

The ability of wild-type and mR3-3 c-Myb to bind to GSThistone tails was tested under three different conditions:
(1) those used in a previous study reporting a specific cMyb association with the H3 tail [40]; (2) binding in the
presence of glycerol, non-specific protein competitors,
and a reducing agent in low salt (50 mM KCl); and (3)
binding in the presence of glycerol, non-specific protein
competitors, and a reducing agent plus a higher salt concentration (150 mM KCl). Under the first condition, we
noted binding to all histone tails by both wild type and
mR3-3 DBDs, with reduced binding to the H2A tail rela-

The mR3-3 DBD demonstrates a selective defect in H4 tail binding
The mR3-3 DBD demonstrates a selective defect in H4 tail binding. A. Alignment of histone H3 and H4 tails is
shown, with basic residues highlighted. Sequences are from H. sapiens (Hs), G. gallus (Gg), X. laevis (Xl), and S. cerevisiae (Sc).
B. The ability of in vitro translated 35S-labeled c-Myb DBD to interact with GST-histone tail fusions (~25–27 kDa) was tested
under three conditions: (1) NETN buffer; (2) GST binding buffer with low salt (50 mM KCl); (3) GST binding buffer with high
salt (150 mM KCl). Similar amounts of wild-type (wt) and mR3-3 (mR3) 35S-labeled c-Myb DBD, shown with a vector only
control (v/o), were used in each precipitation (different exposure than GST binding assays). Staining by Coomassie revealed a
similar amount of GST-histone tails in each precipitation. A selective defect in the ability of mR3-3 to bind GST-H4 tail and be
precipitated compared to wild-type was found under condition 2 (*). The broad bands directly above the GST-histone tails
(conditions 2 and 3) reflects the use of nonfat milk and are likely the major casein proteins (~30–35 kDa). The Benchmark
prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) separates GST-H4 tail and GST-H3 tail (top to bottom are ~50, 40, 25, 20, and 15 kDa).
C. Relative amount of the 35S-labeled c-Myb DBD bound to the GST-H4 tail was quantitated for two separate experiments
using the ImageJ program http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. The wild-type (wt) c-Myb DBD was normalized to 100% and the mR3-3
(mR3) was scaled accordingly.

tive to other histone tails (Figure 6B; see also Additional
File 5). Under the second condition which included nonspecific competitor proteins, we observed binding of the
wild-type c-Myb DBD to the H4 and H2B tails but not to
the H3 or H2A tails (Figure 6B; see also Additional File 5].
These interactions could be disrupted with increased salt
concentration in the third condition (Figure 6B; see also
Additional File 5]. Remarkably, the mR3-3 DBD demonstrated an impaired ability to bind the H4 tail relative to
the wild type DBD (80% reduction in the mutant). A similar reduction was not seen in binding to the H2B tail by
mR3-3 versus wild type DBD. Thus, the mR3-3 DBD has a
specific defect in binding the histone H4 tail relative to
binding by the wild type DBD (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Myb repeats were first discovered in the DNA-binding
domains of proteins typified by the products of the v-Myb
retroviral oncogene and its normal cellular progenitor, cMyb. Such Myb domains adopt a helix-turn-helix fold
found in many DNA-binding proteins in which basic residues interact with the negatively charged phosphate
backbone of the DNA double helix. However, Mybrelated domains are present in a wide variety of nuclear
proteins, some of which do not themselves bind directly
to DNA. We used phylogenetic analysis to identify a conserved acidic patch within the first of the three helices of
most Myb domains. Remarkably, these acid patches lie on
surfaces of DNA-binding Myb proteins that face away
from DNA.
We have used alanine scanning mutagenesis to determine
the function of the conserved acidic patches in the c-Myb
protein. We chose to focus particularly on the acidic patch
within the third Myb repeat of c-Myb because a mutant of
this patch that did not affect protein stability via salt
bridge formation, nuclear localization, or DNA binding,
nevertheless was defective in transcriptional activation
both of transfected reporter genes and of an endogenous

target gene. We used biochemical analyses to demonstrate
that the specific defect in transcriptional activation by this
conserved acidic patch mutant correlated with a decrease
in chromatin association in vivo. This mutant protein also
displayed a reduced ability to interact with the histone H4
tail in vitro.
Although we observed a complete defect in activation of
the endogenous target by the mR3-3 mutant, we detected
only a 50% decrease in the ability of the third repeat
mutant to bind chromatin in vivo. One possible explanation for our results is that c-Myb may utilize different
methods of binding at distinct chromatin domains. The in
vitro histone binding experiments demonstrated a specific
defect of mR3-3 for binding the histone H4 tail but not
the histone H2B tail. If the interaction of c-Myb with chromatin requires the H4 tail at a subset of sites and conversely the H2B tail at a different subset of sites, then the
reduced ability to bind nucleosomes by mR3-3 in the
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays would represent
the loss of binding at the subset of sites requiring the cMyb interaction with the H4 tail.
Another possibility is that all sites require both H4 and
H2B tail association for stable c-Myb chromatin binding.
In this case, the observed decrease in association with
nucleosomes would represent a weakened interaction of
the mR3-3 mutant with chromatin at all sites. Weakened
association with nucleosomes would lead to a higher offrate for the mutant protein bound to chromatin. However, the chemical crosslinking used in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments might allow us to capture
mutant protein bound to chromatin even if the mutant
cannot occupy its chromatin site long enough to effectively activate transcription, thereby explaining the
observed complete loss of activity in the context of a partial chromatin binding defect. The reduced association of
the mR3-3 mutant with nucleosomes containing a variety
of specific histone modifications was similar to that see

for total core histones, supporting a global chromatin
binding defect.

conditions which did permit binding to H4 and H2B
(data not shown).

Although we observed a decreased binding of the mutant
Myb protein to histone H4 tails in vitro, it is also possible
that the defects in transcriptional activation and in chromatin association in vivo are due to interactions with nonhistone proteins. For better or worse, the major histone
proteins in metazoans are encoded by large clusters of tandemly repeated histone genes, making the generation and
study of substitution mutants impossible with current
technology. This is a general problem with all studies of
covalent histone modifications and histone binding proteins. At present, the simplest model that explains all of
our data is that the conserved acidic patch in Myb-related
proteins is required for interaction with the basic region of
the H4 tail, and that a loss of this interaction in the acidic
patch mutant results in decreased chromatin occupancy
which in turn results in a failure of transcriptional activation in vivo.

The acidic patch of c-Myb was identified due to high conservation of these amino acids among the diverse group of
Myb-related proteins, suggesting a common conserved
function. Our results demonstrating chromatin and histone binding properties of the c-Myb DNA-binding
domain are consistent with activities reported for other
proteins containing Myb-related repeats. SANT domains
represent a subset of Myb-related repeats in proteins that
lack specific DNA-binding capacity [42]. Mutagenesis and
deletion analysis of the Myb-related repeat, or SANT
domain, in the ADA2 component of yeast GCN5 histone
acetylase complex led to impaired histone acetylase activity and disrupted H3 tail binding of the complex [8,9].
Myb-related repeats in components of the ATP-dependent
chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF and RSC complexes were
also essential for in vivo activity [9].

We note that genome-wide studies of chromatin occupancy by the sole Myb protein of Drosophila have shown
that in a single cell line, greater than 30% of all promoters
are occupied by a Myb protein complex [41]. One can
hypothesize two classes of promoters: those which require
the Myb acidic patch for initial access in their native chromatin environment; and those in which another protein
creates an apparently nucleosome-free promoter region
and thus do not require the Myb acidic patch for DNA
occupancy by Myb protein. Such a model might explain
why the VP16 activation domain can bypass the absence
of the Myb domain acidic patch in poorly chromatinized
templates for transcription typicial of transient transfection assays, whereas no such bypass occurs on the endogenous mim-1 gene in its native chromatin context.
Others have presented data arguing that the c-Myb but not
the v-Myb DBD can specifically bind the histone H3 tail in
vitro and have proposed that disruption of H3 tail binding
by v-Myb is due to three mutations of hydrophobic residues in the second Myb repeat (N91I, H106L, D117V)
[40]. Specific H3 tail binding by the c-Myb DBD was not
observed in our experiments under several different conditions. However, by including competing proteins (1%
nonfat dried milk), glycerol to disrupt hydrophobic interactions (10%), and a reducing agent (5 mM DTT), we did
observe specific binding to the H4 and H2B tails, arguing
that histone tail binding is an important function of the cMyb DBD. Alanine mutagenesis of the acidic patch (mR33) led to a selective disruption of H4 tail binding. We did
not see binding to the H3 tail by c-Myb in the presence of
non-specific competitor proteins unless we used a concentration of GST-H3 tail ten-times higher than our standard

The ISWI protein provides the enzymatic component of
several ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes
and contains two Myb-related repeats. Nucleosome and
histone H4 tail stimulated activity in vitro required the
Myb-related repeats. One of the ISWI Myb-related repeats,
termed the SLIDE domain, was also essential for stimulation of ISWI ATPase activity by free DNA, indicating this
Myb-related repeat contacts DNA as well as histones in
chromatin [11]. Interestingly, deletion of the Myb-related
repeat in the TFIIIB-B" subunit of RNA polymerase III disrupted transcription on native chromatin in vivo but not
on a naked DNA template in vitro [43]. Myb-related
domains are also present in protein complexes that associate with and regulate inactive heterochromatin, suggesting that Myb-related motifs can function in the context of
different chromatin domains [44,45].
Our data may reflect a predilection for histone H4 binding
by complexes containing the three-repeat Myb proteins.
Consistent with this idea is the finding that the Drosophila MMB complex (Myb-MuvB/dREAM) specifically
interacts with unmodified histone H4 tails [46]. Histone
H4 constitutes a prime target for complexes involved in
global regulation of chromatin because it is the only histone without known variants [47]. In contrast, histones
H3 and H2A have relatively abundant nonallelic variants,
some of which define particular chromatin domains.
Association of the Myb domain with histone H4 may
reflect the ability of Myb-related proteins to bind chromatin despite the structural context since nucleosomes in all
chromatin domains would carry the same invariant H4.
An intriguing group of Myb-related proteins in yeast may
provide further insight into the role of Myb family protein
in vertebrates. Yeast general regulatory factors (GRF) con-

sist of a group of four proteins (ScRAP1, ScREB1, ScTBF1,
ScABF1) identified due to their involvement in multiple
nuclear processes including replication, transcription,
silencing, and telomere maintenance [48-50]. The presence of many binding sites throughout the genome and
the existence of Myb-related DNA-binding domains in
three of these proteins (ScRAP1, ScREB1, ScTBF1) are
common to this group [51,52]. Data suggest that GRFs
have a common mechanism since the binding site of one
GRF can substitute for another and swapping of protein
domains leads to functional GRF chimeric proteins
[51,53]. GRFs were first identified because in vivo binding
led to a nucleosome free region at promoters, giving rise
to the hypothesis that GRFs function by local opening of
chromatin structure [50]. Recent studies have implicated
the REB1 GRF in establishing "poised" chromatin
domains at about 60% of budding yeast promoters via
localization of the variant histone H2A.Z at the boundaries of a nucleosome free region [52,54-56]. Association
with an invariant H4 tail might be required to facilitate
this replication-independent exchange of H2A variants.
GRFs also function by insulating chromatin domains,
such as between silenced heterochromatin and genes
primed for activation [48,49]. The ability to properly
establish and regulate such chromatin domains is essential for genomic stability and the loss of any single yeast
GRF leads to cell death, possibly due to genomic instability.
Besides the obvious presence of a Myb DNA-binding
domain, the Myb family of proteins share many common
properties with yeast GRFs. Myb proteins have a short
consensus binding site (PyAACG/TG) present throughout
the genome [57]. Visualization of GFP-tagged Dm-Myb
revealed many cytologically visible binding sites on polytene chromosomes [58]. In addition, genome-wide studies have recently shown that this Myb complex is present
at greater than 30% of all promoters in a single cell type
[41].
Our finding of a conserved acidic motif essential for the
biological function and required for efficient chromatin
and histone association support a role for Myb proteins in
binding to and possibly regulating chromatin structure.
Consistent with this are the observations that other Mybrelated proteins utilize their Myb domains for chromatin
regulation. The Myb-like domain in yeast GRFs has been
implicated in genomic partitioning and regulation of
chromatin domains [49]. The Myb-related domains in
SANT proteins have been shown to be required for in vivo
function and are known to serve a role in histone binding.
The Myb family is required for the regulation of multiple
genomic processes, is essential for genomic stability, and
we have demonstrated that it contains a conserved acidic
motif necessary for transcriptional activity and efficient

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/77

chromatin association. Because this acidic patch is among
the most conserved features common to all Myb-related
domains, our findings support the idea that the primary
conserved function of Myb-related domains may be histone-binding rather than DNA-binding. We postulate that
the acidic patch of the Myb-related proteins may interact
with the same basic region of the N-terminal histone H4
tail that was bound to an acidic patch created by the H2A/
H2B core in the crystal structure of the nucleosome [37].

Methods
Identification of Myb repeats
Homologs of protein families previously reported to contain domains similar to the Myb-repeat were identified in
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum,
Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe using NCBI BLAST.
Alignments
Myb-repeats of the following protein families were used
for alignments: three-repeat transcription factors (Myb
family, yeast BAS1), two-repeat transcription factors
(plant Myb proteins), telobox, Swi3, Rsc8, ISWI, TFIIIBB", NCor, Ada2, CDC5, REB1/TTF1, RAP1, CDC5,
SNAPc4, and the arthropod R2 retrotransposon class.
Highly divergent turns/loops between the helices were
deleted to facilitate the alignment of the second and third
helices. Identification and deletion of the turns/loops was
facilitated by the Simple Modular Architectural Research
Tool (SMART) program http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/
, but in some cases the length of the loop necessitated
adjustment by hand [59]. These sequences were aligned
using the ClustalW program [24].

The protein sequence for the N-terminal histone H4, H3,
H2A, and H2B tails were retrieved from the PubMed database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi for
Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Gallus gallus (G. gallus), Xenopus laevis (X. laevis), and Saccharomyces cerevisia (S. cerevisiae). These sequences were then aligned using the
ClustalW program. H2A and H2B alignments were
adjusted by hand to facilitate a better alignment of residues but a greater number of gaps. Shading and formatting of all alignments was done using BioEdit http://
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html.
Mutagenesis
The acidic residues in the first helix of each of the three
repeats (R1, R2, and R3) were substituted with alanines
using the Stratagene Quickchange kit (Figure 2a). Alanine
residues were chosen because they have minimal effects
on protein structure and disrupt interactions between
charged surfaces [60]. Complementary primers extending
approximately twenty nucleotides past both ends of the

mutagenesis site were synthesized which substituted three
to four nucleotides in close proximity to create the alanine
substitutions. The primer sets used for mutation of the
first repeat (R1) changed EEDE to AEDA, AEAA, AADA,
and AAAA. The AEAA and AAAA mutations were monitored by creation of an AlwNI restriction site, while AEDA
and AADA were monitored by DNA sequencing. Primers
converting the second repeat (R2) residues EED to AED,
AEA, and AAA led to disruption of a BseRI site. Mutation
of the third repeat (R3) created another unique AlwNI site
and changed the EEED to EAEA, EAAA, and AAEA. Mutagenesis was performed in the SP73-c-Myb plasmid and
mutant DNA-binding domains were sequenced and
recloned into the appropriate vectors for expression.
Plasmids
All of the mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His-B
mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) as follows.
Initially, an XbaI/HpaI fragment containing the cMybVP16 fusion gene was subcloned from the N-CC-VP
[61,62] vector into pcDNA3.1/myc-His-B using the XbaI/
PmeI restriction sites. This strategy eliminated the mycHis tag from the final pcDNA3.1/c-MybVP16 product.
Mutant c-Myb DBDs excised from the SP73-c-Myb vector
using the unique Bsu36I and BstEII restriction sites were
sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1-c-Myb-VP16 using the same
restriction sites. Full length wild-type and mutant c-Myb
expression vectors were made by replacing the BstEII/ClaI
C-terminal coding fragment from the pcDNA3.1-cMybVP16 vectors with the BstEII/ClaI C-terminal coding fragment from the SP73-cMyb vector. The truncated c-Myb
(Δc-Myb) was constructed by swapping the BstEII/ClaI
fragment of the pcDNA3.1-cMyb-VP16 for the BstEII/ClaI
fragment of the retroviral vector, N-I-CCd (N-I-c-MybΔ)
[61,62]. To facilitate analysis of DNA binding, the threerepeats (3R) of the mutant DNA-binding domains were
subcloned into the MT7-His6-R1R2R3-c-Myb-Tag bacterial expression vector using Bsu36I and BstE II restriction
sites [62]. All subclones were screened by restriction site
analysis and vectors were sequenced.
Cell culture and DNA transfection
Quail QT6 fibroblasts were cultured at 37°C in 10% CO2
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). QT6 cells were
split into 10 cm (Falcon #3003) or 15 cm (Falcon #3025)
treated tissue culture dishes and transfected a day later
using the Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche) according
to the manufacture's instructions. Cells were harvested
36–48 hours after transfection for reporter assays and
western blotting.

Chicken HD11 macrophages were cultured at 37°C in
10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 5%

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/77

chicken serum (Sigma) on noncoated tissue culture plates
(Falcon #1005). For transfections, cells were plated onto
coated 10 cm (Falcon #3003) or 15 cm (Falcon #3025)
dishes and allowed to grow overnight. Transfections were
performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown
for 24 hours in antibiotic-free media before harvesting.
Reporter assays
Reporter assays were performed in QT6 cells by transfecting, 0.3 micrograms CMV-β-galactosidase, 0.1 micrograms CMV-EGFPc1 (Clonetech), 1.6 micrograms EW5E1b-Luciferase reporter, and eighteen micrograms
pcDNA3.1 c-Myb wild-type or mutant expression constructs [63]. The cells were harvested, lysed by freeze/
thawing, and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase
activity. The values obtained in relative luciferase units
(RLU) were normalized for transfection efficiency using
the β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. In order
to easily compare experiments the normalized relative
luciferase units were plotted as a percentage of the wildtype activity which was set to 100% activity. The results for
each mutant are the average of three to six separate experiments. Truncated c-Myb had a transcriptional activity
100 times stronger than the full length c-Myb and the
VP16 c-Myb fusion had an activity 1000 times greater than
the full length. Thus, the wild-type full length, truncated,
and VP16 fusion of c-Myb were all set to 100% and the
respective mutants were scaled accordingly to facilitate
comparison of the change in mutant activity relative to the
corresponding wild-type protein.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
For analysis of vertebrate cell extracts, QT6 fibroblasts
were transfected in 10 cm dishes (Falcon #3003) using
twenty micrograms pcDNA3.1-MybVP16 fusion plasmids
and 0.1 micrograms CMV-EGFP-C1 (Clontech) to monitor transfection efficiency. QT6 cells were scraped into one
milliliter of PBS and pelleted at 2500 g for ten minutes.
Nuclear extracts were made according to standard protocols. To investigate DNA-binding in the absence of C-terminal sequences the wild-type and mutant c-Myb DNAbinding domains were expressed in E. coli using the MT7His6-R1R2R3-c-Myb-Tag expression vectors [62].

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using QT6 nuclear
extracts were conducted with a 26 base pair oligonucleotide containing a single strong Myb binding site from the
mim-1 promoter [62]. One-tenth (four microliters) of
QT6 nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice for thirty
minutes in DNA-binding buffer (10 mM Hepes pH7.6, 30
mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Ammonium
Sulfate, 5% Glycerol, 5% Ficoll 400, 100 micrograms/milliliter BSA, and 0.5× EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche)) and one hundred nanograms each of

Salmon Sperm DNA, Calf Thymus DNA, and poly d(I-C).
Ten femtograms of a 32P Klenow labeled 26 bp mim-1A
oligonucleotide was added to the reaction and incubated
for another thirty minutes on ice. The entire reaction was
loaded onto a one millimeter thick 5% polyacrylamide gel
made using 0.25× TBE buffer and a ratio of 80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide. The gel was run at ten volts/cm at
4°C in the same buffer. The gel was dried onto Hybond
N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) to minimize loss
of the oligonucleotide and then exposed to x-ray film
(Kodak) for three hour to overnight.
Western blot analysis
In order to monitor the wild-type and mutant protein
expression in our reporter assays, half of the QT6 cells
from the reporter assays were pelleted and resuspended in
two hundred microliters of SDS-PAGE loading buffer.
Boiled samples were analyzed using western blot analysis
by standard techniques. The loading of protein samples
was adjusted for transfection efficiency by using β-galactosidase to normalize the amount loaded or by co-staining the western blot for GFP using an anti-GFP mouse
monoclonal antibody (Clontech). The c-Myb protein was
detected using the 5E mouse monoclonal antibody
(1:5000) using HRP [64]. For western blot analysis of cMybVP16 protein in EMSA assays bands were visualized
using alkaline phosphatase.
Immunofluorescence
To determine the nuclear localization of mutant c-Myb
proteins we utilized immunofluorescent staining. 200 ng
of pcDNA3.1-c-Myb wild-type and mutant vectors with
full length, c-Myb-VP16 fusions, or truncated c-Myb genes
were transfected into 50–70% confluent QT6 cells grown
in 8-well chamber slides using Fugene6 (Roche). After 36–
48 hours QT6 fibroblasts were stained with a mix of monoclonal antibodies: Myb 2.2 (1:3000), Myb 2.7 (1:3000),
and 5E (1:5000) [64,65]. A goat anti-mouse secondary
coupled to Alexafluor was used to visualize Myb proteins
(Molecular Probes). The cells were mounted in Vecta
Shield mounting media containing propidium iodide to
stain nuclei. The fibroblasts were imaged using a Nikon
Eclipse E800 and a Spot camera system (Diagnostic
Instruments).
Analysis of endogenous mim-1 expression
Expression of the endogenous mim-1 gene was measured
by preparing total RNA and performing reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis (RT-PCR). HD11 cells were transfected with twelve micrograms of pcDNA3.1-cMyb
expression vectors and 0.1 ug CMV-EGFP-c1 as described
above. The next day total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen). Total RNA was analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, revealing minimal degradation.

Two micrograms of total RNA was treated with DNase I
(Invitrogen) for fifteen minutes. Synthesis of cDNA was
performed using Oligo-dT primers and the First Strand
Synthesis RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). Detection of the mim1 and β-actin genes using gene specific primers and standard PCR reactions were performed on ten-fold serial dilutions of the cDNA templates. The relative amount of total
RNA for each sample was determined using amplification
curves of β-actin expression. The quantity of mim-1 expression was determined by normalizing to the amount of
total RNA in each sample using the β-actin level as a standard.
Protein chomatin immunoprecipitation assays
293T cells were grown in 150 mm × 25 mm treated tissue
culture dishes (Falcon #3025) as described above. Cells
from five 150 mm × 25 mm dishes were lightly
trypsinized and then fixed with freshly prepared 1% buffered formaldehyde for fifteen minutes at room temperature in a 50 ml Falcon tube with constant shaking. The
crosslinking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a
final concentration of 50 mM. Cells were pelleted at 3000
rpm for five minutes, washed once with ten milliters of 1×
PBS, and transferred to Falcon tubes (Falcon 2096). Cell
pellets were resuspended in one milliliter of ChIP lysis
buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for ten minutes to lyse the cells. The cell lysate
was then sonicated twelve times for twenty seconds each
at a duty cycle of 50% and a power setting of two in a
Branson sonicator using a 1/8" microtip. The cell lysates
were incubated on ice for two minutes after each pulse.
The lysate was precleared by spinning at 10,000 × g for fifteen minutes at 4°C.

The immunoprecipitation was performed by adding 55
microliters of a 50% slurry of Flag M2 antibody coupled
to agarose beads (Sigma) plus 50 micrograms/milliliter
salmon sperm DNA for two hours to overnight at room
temperature or 4°C, respectively. The beads were pelleted
and washed three times in low salt buffer (0.01% SDS, 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl), three times in high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM
NaCl), two times in LiCl/detergent buffer (50 mM
TrisHCl pH8.0, 500 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.5%
deoxycholate) and two times in TE buffer (pH 8.0). Protein complexes were released by incubating twice at
100°C for fifteen minutes in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.
Western analysis with antibodies to modified and core
histones (Abcam and Upstate) were performed using a
standard protocol.

Histone binding assays
GST-yeast histone tails were expressed in bacteria and prepared according to standard procedures [39]. The c-Myb
DBD was in vitro translated and 35S-methionine labeled in
rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT-Promega). Roughly equal
amounts of GST-histone tail, c-Myb DBD, and twenty
microliters of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose were
added to one milliliter of binding buffer. Binding reactions were conducted for two hours at room temperature
and beads were washed six times with the same binding
buffer. The beads were then boiled for ten minutes and
the eluted proteins were loaded on 12% SDS PAGE. Protein gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to stain GSThistones then gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film to
visualize 35S-labeled c-Myb DBD. Binding conditions
were as follows: (1) NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40) [40]; (2) GST
binding buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM
EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 0.5% nonfat milk, 5
mM DTT); or (3) GST Binding Buffer with 150 mM KCl.
