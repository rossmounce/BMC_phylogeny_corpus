Abstract
Background: Flax, Linum usitatissimum L., is an important crop whose seed oil and stem fiber have multiple
industrial applications. Flax seeds are also well-known for their nutritional attributes, viz., omega-3 fatty acids in the
oil and lignans and mucilage from the seed coat. In spite of the importance of this crop, there are few molecular
resources that can be utilized toward improving seed traits. Here, we describe flax embryo and seed development
and generation of comprehensive genomic resources for the flax seed.
Results: We describe a large-scale generation and analysis of expressed sequences in various tissues. Collectively, the
13 libraries we have used provide a broad representation of genes active in developing embryos (globular, heart,
torpedo, cotyledon and mature stages) seed coats (globular and torpedo stages) and endosperm (pooled globular to
torpedo stages) and genes expressed in flowers, etiolated seedlings, leaves, and stem tissue. A total of 261,272
expressed sequence tags (EST) (GenBank accessions LIBEST_026995 to LIBEST_027011) were generated. These EST
libraries included transcription factor genes that are typically expressed at low levels, indicating that the depth is
adequate for in silico expression analysis. Assembly of the ESTs resulted in 30,640 unigenes and 82% of these could
be identified on the basis of homology to known and hypothetical genes from other plants. When compared with
fully sequenced plant genomes, the flax unigenes resembled poplar and castor bean more than grape, sorghum, rice
or Arabidopsis. Nearly one-fifth of these (5,152) had no homologs in sequences reported for any organism,
suggesting that this category represents genes that are likely unique to flax. Digital analyses revealed gene
expression dynamics for the biosynthesis of a number of important seed constituents during seed development.
Conclusions: We have developed a foundational database of expressed sequences and collection of plasmid
clones that comprise even low-expressed genes such as those encoding transcription factors. This has allowed us
to delineate the spatio-temporal aspects of gene expression underlying the biosynthesis of a number of important
seed constituents in flax. Flax belongs to a taxonomic group of diverse plants and the large sequence database
will allow for evolutionary studies as well.

Background
Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a globally important agricultural crop grown both for its seed oil as well as its stem
fiber. Flax seed is used as a food source and has many valuable nutritional qualities. The seed oil also has multiple
industrial applications such as in the manufacture of linoleum and paints and in preserving wood and concrete.
The fiber from flax stem is highly valued for use in textiles
such as linen, specialty paper such as bank notes and in

eco-friendly insulations [1]. Flax belongs to the family
Linaceae and is one of about 200 species in the genus
Linum [2]. It is a self-pollinating annual diploid plant with
30 chromosomes (2n = 30), and a relatively small genome
size for a higher plant, estimated at ~700 Mbp [3,4].
Although flax demonstrates typical dicotyledonous seed
development, there are species-specific differences compared to, for instance, Arabidopsis thaliana seed development. However, very little is known about genes expressed
during flax seed development. Advancing this knowledge
and comparison of gene expression profiles and gene
sequences would provide new insights into flax seed
development.

Nutritionally, flax seed has multiple desirable attributes. It is rich in dietary fiber and has a high content
of essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. The seeds
are composed of ~45% oil, 30% dietary fiber and 25%
protein. Around 73% of the fatty acids in flax seed are
polyunsaturated. Approximately 50% of the total fatty
acids consist of a-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor for
many essential fatty acids of human diet [5]. Flax seed is
also a rich source of the lignan component secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). SDG is present in flax seeds
at levels 75 - 800 times greater than any other crops or
vegetables currently known [6,7]. In addition to having
anti-cancer properties, SDG also has antioxidant and
phytoestrogen properties [8]. Flax seed contains about
400 g/kg total dietary fiber. This seed fiber is rich in
pentosans and the hull fraction contains 2-7% mucilage
[9]. The other major constituent of flax seeds are storage proteins that can range from 10-30% [10]. Globulins are the major storage proteins of flax seed, forming
about 58-66% of the total seed protein [11,12].
Improvement of flax varieties through breeding for various traits can be assisted by development of molecular
markers and by understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of these characteristics [13,14]. The goal of this
research was to develop a comprehensive genomics-based
dataset for flax in order to advance the understanding of
flax embryo, endosperm and seed coat development. We
report the construction of 13 cDNA libraries, each derived
from specific flax seed tissue stages, as well as other vegetative tissues together with the generation of ESTs derived
from these libraries and the related assembled unigenes.
We mined the resulting database with the goal of revealing
new insights into the gene expression in developing seeds
in comparison to that of vegetative tissues and other plant
species. We show the usefulness of this database as a tool
to identify putative candidates that play critical roles in
biochemically important pathways in the flax seed. Specifically we analyzed gene expression during embryogenesis
as related to fatty acid, flavonoid, mucilage, and storage
protein synthesis and transcription factors.

Results and Discussion
Seed development characteristics in flax

Limited information is available regarding flax seed
development, despite its economic importance. Since the
seed is an economically important output of this crop, in
this study, we performed a detailed analysis of embryogenesis and flax seed development. The flax seed consists
of three major tissues: the diploid embryo and triploid
endosperm as products of double fertilization, and the
maternal seed coat tissue. Soon after fertilization, the
seed is translucent and the embryo sac is upright within
the integuments (Figure 1A). The developing embryo is
anchored at the micropylar end of the embryo sac. The

thick, clear and fragile integuments of the fertilized ovule
differentiate into the thin, dark and protective seed coat
during seed development. Observation during the dissection process revealed that the endosperm initials, which
formed at fertilization, undergo divisions to form a cellularized endosperm by the globular embryo stage (Figure
1B and Figure 2H). The endosperm progressively
increases in size up to the torpedo stage, after which time
it begins to degenerate, presumably to make space for the
rapidly elongating cotyledons and to provide nutritional
support to the developing embryo. By the late cotyledon
stage the majority of endosperm cells have been consumed, leaving a thin layer of endosperm on the inner
wall of the seed coat of the maturing seed.
The globular embryo (Figure 1C, 1E) has a short suspensor consisting of just four cells that is nestled into the
micropylar sleeve (Figure 1D). As the embryo develops
from the globular (Figure 1E) to heart (Figure 1F) and
torpedo (Figure 1G) stages, the increase in embryo size is
largely due to growth of the cotyledons. This is in contrast to the Arabidopsis embryo where the increase in
size is due to an increase in both the cotyledons and the
embryonic axis [15]. The embryonic axis consists of the
hypocotyl and radicle initials that are formed at the heart
stage and it eventually differentiates to form a short peglike structure in the mature embryo. Whereas the tips of
the cotyledon primordia are pointed in the late torpedo
stages (Figure 1H) they become rounded at the top in the
cotyledon stage (Figure 1I). The mature embryo (Figures
1J, 1K) is primarily composed of two large cotyledons,
and a relatively short embryonic axis. The cotyledons
play a dual role nutritionally during germination and
early seedling growth. They hold much of the seed storage reserves and become photosynthetic after germination. The mature embryo contains dormant leaf
primordia initials and shoot and root apical meristems
that will become activated after imbibition and during
the germination of the seed (Figures 1L, 1M). A crosssection of the cotyledon shows differentiation of the cortical cells into a layer of palisade cells and the compact
mesophyll cells. The mesophyll cells of the cotyledon and
the parenchyma cells of the hypocotyl are filled with storage deposits (Figure 1N, 1O) similar to those previously
reported [16]. While flax seed development follows the
general trends described for seeds of other model dicot
species, there are some features that are different. For
instance, unlike the Arabidopsis embryo, where the
mature embryo is bent inside the anatropous seed, the
flax embryo is positioned upright within the seed [15]. In
the flax seed, the cotyledons take up the majority of the
seed space with only a thin endosperm and seed coat left
at maturity. This is in contrast to castor bean seeds
where the endosperm is thick and the cotyledons nestled
within the endosperm are thinner [17].

Sequencing 13 cDNA libraries provides insights into the
flax transcriptome

The cDNA libraries constructed in this study provide a
broad representation of seed development (8 libraries) as
well as 5 libraries for vegetative tissues. The 8 seed libraries
were all from the most widely cultivated Canadian linseed
variety CDC Bethune and comprised globular embryo,
heart embryo, torpedo embryo, cotyledon embryo, mature
embryo, seed coat from the globular stage, seed coat from
the torpedo stage and pooled endosperm (globular to torpedo stage) (Figure 2 A-H); four of the remaining five
cDNA libraries were prepared from whole etiolated seedlings, stem, leaf, and flowers (Figure 2 I, J, L and 2M) of cv.

CDC Bethune and the last library was for stem peels from
cv. Norlin (Figure 2K).
The EST collection from single pass sequencing of the 3’
end of the cDNA in plasmid clones had a median length
of 613 nucleotides (nt). Each of these clones has been catalogued and stored at -80°C to allow for further studies.
Full length cDNAs have also been identified for some
clones by additional 5’ end sequencing. Table 1 summarizes the distribution, quantity and quality of the ESTs
obtained from the 13 libraries. After removal of vector
sequences, rRNA sequences, sequences <80 nt, organelle
sequences and masking for repeats, 261,272 sequences
remained. The assembly of a final unigene set was done in

two steps. First, ESTs from each library were assembled
with EGassembler [18], resulting collectively in 27,168
contigs and 51,041 singletons. This collection of 78,209
contigs and singletons was reassembled with EGassembler.
Thus a unigene set for each tissue source and a unified set
of unigenes encompassing all the tissues were obtained.
This second assembly process resulted in 15,784 contigs
and 14,856 singletons, totaling 30,640 unigenes. The
30,640 unigenes identified here likely represents a major
part of the flax seed transcriptome. Table 2 shows the

distribution of the clusters, contigs, singletons and unigenes in the individual libraries. The length of the contigs
varies from 102 to 3,027 nucleotides with a median length
of 778 nt (data not shown). The sum of the lengths of the
contigs plus singletons is 21.6 megabases, which represents 3% of the predicted 700Mb flax genome [3]. The
EST distribution for each unigene among the 13 tissues
and its predicted or putative Arabidopsis homologue is
presented in Additional File 1. A queryable flax unigene
database is available at http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca/portal/flax/

and all the EST sequences are also deposited in GenBank
(Table 3). Of the 30,640 unigenes, 23,418 (76.4%) were
identified as having significant homology with Arabidopsis
gene sequences. The Arabidopsis genome is ~157 Mbp
[19] and has a transcriptome of ~27,000 genes [20] and
our analysis hints that flax potentially has a larger transcriptome than Arabidopsis. While our libraries do not
give complete coverage of the flax vegetative tissues, they
can be used as minimum number to estimate the size of
flax transcriptome.
GO annotation and functional categorization

The unigene collection of 30,640 contigs and singletons
was analyzed using the BLASTX algorithm against the
UniProt-plants and TAIR databases. The unigenes that
showed significant homology to known genes (E-value ≤
e-10) against UniProt-plants were selected for Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation and further mapping of the
GO terms to TAIR database which is manually and
computationally curated on a ongoing basis [21]. The
values generated for the different GO-categories were
used to generate the classification based on molecular
functions, biological processes and cellular components
(Figure 3). Based on the BLAST analysis in TAIR,
23,418 unigenes showed significant homology to Arabidopsis genes and these are listed in a spreadsheet (Additional File 1; http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca/portal/flax/) along
with the distribution of ESTs for each unigene from the
13 tissue libraries. Our analysis suggests that the different GO-categories are well represented in our unigene
dataset indicative of a broad coverage of expressed
genes in the flax genome.

Hierarchical cluster analysis of flax tissue based EST
collections

In order to compare the gene expression profile in different tissues, the entire set of 261,272 EST sequences
was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using the
software HCE3.5 [22] (see Methods). Amongst the parameters required for hierarchical cluster analysis, we
selected the average linkage method and the Pearson

The analysis shows that in general gene expression is
most closely related in tissues that are developmentally
related and connected. For example, globular (GE) and

heart (HE) embryo stages are most closely related, followed closely by the torpedo stage (TE). The maturing
embryos, viz., cotyledon (CE) and mature (ME) stages
clustered together but were distantly placed from the
early stage embryos. The two seed coat stages (GC and
TC) also shared a relatively high degree of similarity to

each other. Gene expression in the pooled endosperm
tissue (EN) from early developing seed stages shared
some similarity with early embryonic stages but was
more distant from the seed coats and maturing embryos.
It is interesting to note that the CE and ME stages cluster away from the early seed tissues (GE, HE, TE, GC,
TC and EN) and to a lesser extent from other non-seed
tissues viz., (ES, LE, FL, ST) which is indicative of the
distinct seed maturation program that is occurring in
the later stages of embryo development. As the stem
peel (PS) did not contain all of the tissues normally present in whole stems (ST), and was enriched for the
phloem and phloem fiber cells [24], the PS gene expression profile did not cluster with ST, and as expected
was distantly placed from the rest of the vegetative tissues and seed tissues. Whole stems (ST) and etiolated
seedlings (ES) showed a high degree of similarity, possibly due to their polysaccharide composition. Both whole
stems and etiolated seedlings are likely to be particularly
enriched in xylem tissues, the secondary walls of which
produce polysaccharides different from those found in
the pectin-enriched phloem fibers in (PS), seed coats
(GC, TC), or the primary walls of developing embryos
[25]. Taken together, this analysis showed three distinct
patterns of relatedness of gene expression among the 13
tissues: early seed stages, the maturing embryo stages
and the juvenile vegetative tissues (ES, ST and LF).
Nearly a fifth of the identified transcriptome is apparently
unique to flax

To identify the degree of potential homology of the flax
unigenes shared with other plant species, we performed

BLASTX analysis against the proteomes representing the
six fully sequenced and annotated genomes of Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), Vitis
vinifera (grape), Populus trichocarpa (poplar) and Ricinus
communis (castor bean) (see Methods). In general, the
deduced flax polypeptides are more similar to those of
poplar and castor bean than to grape, Arabidopsis, sorghum or rice (Table 4). This is consistent with the taxonomic grouping of flax, poplar and castor bean within
the order Malpighiales [26]. The order Malpighiales,
which is a large diverse grouping of 42 families containing several economically important species, is hypothesized to have diverged within a relatively short time
frame and the taxonomic relationship of families within
this order is poorly resolved. However, genome sequencing of poplar [27], castor bean [28], cassava [29] and
large EST libraries from other species within this order
including flax (this study) will likely aid in molecular systematic studies to address broader phylogenetic relationships between these families. Whereas 66% of the
unigenes (20,251) had hits in all six species, 16.8% (5,152)
of the unigenes had no hits in any species, indicating that
they may be flax specific genes.
Key embryogenesis regulators are present in the EST
collections

Transcription factors (TFs) are generally expressed at
low levels and their presence in ESTs indicate the depth
of the EST coverage. We analyzed the TFs present in all
flax libraries. Among the TF families, three important
motifs present in the TFs that regulate plant growth and
development are the homeodomain (HD), MADS and
the MYB domain [30]. TFs containing these domains
are well represented in the 13 libraries and indicate
good coverage of low expressed genes in the EST datasets (see Figure 5; Additional File 2). Overall, at least
783 transcription factors are present in the 30,640 flax
unigenes.

Figure 5 Distribution of putative flax unigenes encoding
MADS, homeodomain and MYB domain transcription factors.
These transcription factor families are expected to have wide
distribution and are found in majority of the flax EST libraries. EST
distribution of flax unigenes used to compile this graph is listed in
Additional File 2.

As one of the main objectives of this study was to gain
a better understanding of what happens in the flax seed
as it develops, we further analyzed the EST libraries for
transcription factors with specific roles in embryo and
seed development (Additional File 2). The establishment
of the adaxial and abaxial polarity during cotyledon primordia differentiation at the heart stage of embryo
development is specified by the HD-ZIPIII family,
ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) (adaxial) and YABBY,
KANADI families (abaxial) respectively [31]. ESTs corresponding to adaxial and abaxial polarity specifying TFs
are expressed from globular stage onwards with maximum number of ESTs in the heart stage when the cotyledon primordia are specified (Figure 6; Additional
File 2).
LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes LEC1, LEC1-like
(L1L), LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3) are master regulators
of embryogenesis that are primarily expressed throughout seed development, and ectopic expression of these
TFs results in somatic embryogenesis or embryonic
characteristics being overlaid on vegetative organs
[32-35]. ABI3 is expressed only during seed maturation
and is a key regulator of seed maturation processes such
as seed dormancy and storage reserve accumulation
[36]. AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15), a MADS domain
containing TF is primarily expressed during Arabidopsis
seed development and its ectopic expression increases
the competency of cells to respond to somatic embryogenesis induction conditions [37,38]. In Arabidopsis,
AGL15 is directly upregulated by LEC2 [39]. In addition,
LEC2, FUS3 and ABI3 have all been demonstrated to be
direct targets of AGL15 [40]. Examination of flax unigenes showed seed-specific enriched expression of L1L,
LEC2, FUS3, ABI3 and AGL15 (Figure 7; Additional File

2). Only one EST with similarity to LEC2 was identified.
The absence of LEC1 and the presence of the closely
related L1L in seed tissues have also been observed for
scarlett runner bean [33]. The identification of ESTs in
seed-specific libraries that are pertinent to seed maturation program lends support to the quality of these
libraries.
Mining for biochemical pathway-specific ESTs that make
flax seed nutritionally rich

The flax seed contains many nutritionally important
compounds such as proteins, fatty acids, lignans, flavonoids and mucilage. To determine the usefulness of the
EST resources generated in this study, we queried for
genes involved in the synthesis of the above noted seed
components. In order to identify potential candidate
enzymes amongst many flax unigenes, the Additional
Files 3 and 4 provide the first step to narrow down
putative flax candidates by examining the timing and
distribution of ESTs across different tissues.
Seed storage proteins

Much of the proteins in flax seeds are storage proteins
that exist within protein storage vacuoles and these proteins constitute 23% of the whole flax seed [41]. Storage
proteins in flax seed are made up of ~65% globulins and
~35% albumins [11]. Conlinin is a 2S albumin and cupin
and cruciferin are 11S and 12S globulins, respectively.
Our EST data correlates the expression of the genes coding for the storage proteins with the reported levels of
proteins in flax seeds (Figure 8A; Additional File 3). Globulin encoding genes were expressed at much higher
levels than those encoding the albumin and were
observed in the later cotyledon (CE) and mature (ME)

stages of embryo development. Interestingly, small numbers of ESTs for all the storage proteins were identified
in young seed coats, primarily at the torpedo stage
(Figure 8A; Additional File 3). This is in agreement with
the observation that a conlinin gene promoter is active in
early stages of seed coat development [42]. Pooled endosperm from the corresponding seed coat stages did not
identify any storage protein ESTs. These observations
suggest that the seed coat does have a role in storage protein synthesis. Given that the seed coat is a major part of
the overall mass in developing seeds, the seed coat might
be a transient source of protein for developing embryos.

genes of important flax seed nutritional components. Fatty acid
biosynthesis, oleosin oil body proteins and storage protein ESTs are
highly represented in zygotic library compartments (A). Lignan,
flavonoid and mucilage biosynthetic pathways are highly

Fatty acids and oil body formation

Mature flax seeds consist of approximately 43% oil,
mostly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) within oil
bodies located in the embryo [11]. In order to study the
timing and source of lipid synthesis within the developing seeds, enzymes representing the four key steps of
fatty acid synthesis were studied: acyl-chain elongation,
termination, desaturation and TAG synthesis [43,44]
(Figure 8A, Figure 9; Additional File 3). Based on the
preponderance of ESTs representing the 3-ketoacyl-acyl
carrier protein synthases (KAS1, KAS2 and KAS3) in
the various tissues, it appears that acyl chain elongation
activity increases during the torpedo stage and that the
embryo, endosperm and seed coat all contribute to this
activity in the seed (Figure 9A). Although the number of
ESTs representing termination of elongation by fatty
acyl-ACP thioesterases (FATA and FATB) was lower
than KAS ESTs, this activity also appears to peak during
the torpedo stage (Figure 9B). Within the developing
embryos, fatty acids are transferred onto a glycerol backbone to form triacylglycerols by the activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). TAGs are stored in oil

bodies, the outer membrane of which is a spherical
phospholipid monolayer interspersed with the protein
oleosin [44]. ESTs representing DGAT were found in
quantities similar to the FATA and FATB ESTs, i.e. in
very low quantities. The key difference is that this activity seems to peak later, during the cotyledon embryonic
stage rather than the torpedo stage (Figure 9D). Also,
while termination of elongation and release of free FAs
appears to occur in both seed tissues as well as in some
of the vegetative tissues, DGAT expression in vegetative
tissues is too low to detect with the EST counts. Desaturation is the key step that results in the desirable
omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids [44]. This seems to
occur later during seed development as the spike in the
number of ESTs representing the Fatty Acid Desaturases
(FAD) 2, 3, 5 and 8 occurs within the mature embryo
(Figure 9C). One of the omega-3 fatty acids found in
flax, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), constitutes up
to 55% of the total seed oil [41]. ALA is an essential
fatty acid in human diet and it is converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)

our datasets, the expression of putative homologs of
Arabidopsis Oleosin 1, 2 and 3 genes was observed in
the embryo beginning at the torpedo stage (TE), with
greater levels in mature stage (ME) (Figure 8A; Additional File 3). This also coincides with the expression in
the CE and ME stages of the FAD desaturases that are
involved in the formation of the omega-3 and omega-6
fatty acids. Oleosin gene expression has been shown to
be regulated in part by ABI3 in Arabidopsis [46]. There
is also a correlation of ABI3 with oleosin ESTs at the
torpedo and mature embryo stages (Figure 7 and 8A;
Additional File 2 and 3), indicating that the EST data is
reflective of the underlying genetic and biochemical
programs.

Flax is a rich source of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside
(SDG). SDG is converted by intestinal bacteria to the
so-called mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone.
SDG has phytoestrogen, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [8]. Lignans present in the seed coat of flax and are
derived from coniferyl alcohol by the initial action of
oxidases and dirigent proteins that yield pinoresinol
[47]. Sequential reduction of pinoresinol by pinoresinollariciresinol reductase (PLR) results in the formation of
SDG [48]. Analysis of our flax unigene collection identified
several candidates corresponding to dirigent proteins and
PLR that are predominantly expressed in the globular and
torpedo stage seed coats (Figure 8B; Additional File 4). Dirigent proteins had a higher number of EST hits in globular
stage seed coat which corresponds with its early role in the
lignan biosynthetic pathway, whereas pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase, which acts later in the pathway, is expressed
in the seed coat at the torpedo stage.

which are then incorporated into membrane phospholipids. Some fatty acids are used in plant membrane
synthesis, wax formation and pigmentation. The repertoire of lipid synthesis ESTs found in stem, stem peel
and flowers provide a basis to probe these processes in
these tissues (Figures 8A and 9).
Oleosins, proteins associated with oilbodies, are
known to stabilize them by preventing the coalescence

Flavonoids constitute a major class of plant phenolics.
Flax seeds are a rich source of flavonoids, which
includes flavonols and anthocyanidins [49]. The flavonoid biosynthesis branch starts with the formation of
chalcone, a reaction catalyzed by chalcone synthase
(CHS), followed by the synthesis of flavanone by chalcone isomerase (CHI). Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR)
activity is the committing step for leucoanthocyanidin
synthesis and proanthocyanidin, anthocyanidin and
anthocyanin synthesis follows this step [50]. The key
enzymes in the flavonoid synthesis pathway, viz., CHS,
CHI and DFR are expressed during flax seed development especially in the seed coat tissues as shown by the
number of ESTs (Figure 8B; Additional File 4).
BANYULS (BAN) gene of Arabidopsis encodes an
anthocyanidin reductase in the anthocyanidin branch
that produces cis-3-flavan-3-ol which has known health
benefits in humans [51]. ESTs representing BAN are
present in the embryonic and seed coat tissues of flax

Venglat et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/74

indicating that flax seeds could be a likely source of cis3-flavan-3-ols (Figure 8B; Additional File 4).
Mucilage synthesis and secretion

During flax seed development, the ovule integuments differentiate and form specialized cell types which include
the seed coat epidermis that stores mucilaginous compounds. The chemical composition of flax seed mucilage
has been investigated because of its benefits to human
health. The pectin rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I) is the
primary constituent of seed mucilage in Arabidopsis and
several other species, whereas flax seed mucilage contains
a mixture of neutral arabinoxylans (75%) and RG I (25%)
[52-54]. In the mature seed, the cells of the outer epidermal layer of the seed coat are transformed into mucilage
secretory cells (MSCs) that release mucilage upon seed
hydration. In Arabidopsis, MUCILAGE-MODIFIED4
(MUM4) gene encodes Rhamnose Synthase2, an enzyme
that catalyzes the synthesis of RG I [55], whereas MUM2
encodes a beta-galactosidase that enables the hydration
properties of the mucilage by modifying the RG I side
chains [56]. Furthermore, AtBXL1 gene, which encodes a
beta-xylosidase/alpha-arabinofuranosidase, is essential for
the release of mucilage by degradation of the arabinan
side chains in the mucilage and/or cell wall of the mucilage secretory cells [57]. Genes encoding rhamnose
synthase and beta-xylosidase are represented in the GC
and TC tissue specific ESTs indicating that the mucilage
synthesis and secretion pathway observed in Arabidopsis
is represented in flax and the expression of corresponding genes are enriched specifically in seed coat tissues
(Figure 8B; Additional File 4). However, ESTs corresponding to the rhamnose synthase did not include the
ortholog of Arabidopsis MUM4 gene, suggesting the possibility that there is some diversity of this mucilage synthesis pathway in flax. Galacturonosyltransferases that are
involved in the polymerization of galacturonic acid [58]
to form pectic RG I were also well represented in GC
and TC tissue specific manner, indicative of their conserved roles in the synthesis of mucilage in the seed coat
(Figure 8B; Additional File 4). Interestingly, ESTs corresponding to the putative homologs of the AtBXL2 gene, a
member of the small gene family that includes AtBXL1
[57], were expressed at very high levels in the seed coat
tissues suggesting their role in the quick and uniform
release of mucilage from the flax seed coat upon imbibition (Figure 8B; Additional File 4). A putative flax ortholog of AtBXL1 is also one of the most abundant ESTs
identified in a previous report of cDNAs from fiber-bearing flax tissues [59].

Conclusions
We have developed a comprehensive EST resource for
flax representing developmental stages of specific seed
tissues, some vegetative and reproductive tissues. These

Page 11 of 14

resources include publicly available EST sequences at
GenBank (Table 3), a queryable flax unigene database
(http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca/portal/flax/) and unigene distribution across libraries (Additional File 1). The datasets
developed in this study enhance the genomic resource
base for flax, an important crop. These resources can
contribute to gene discovery and development of
expanded molecular marker sets for breeding. Additionally, the unigene set developed in this study will contribute to the annotation and assembly of the whole flax
genome sequence.
The recently published flax-specific microarray based on
EST sequences obtained from a fiber focused study while
the present manuscript was under preparation provides a
complimentary genomic tool for flax gene expression analysis [60]. However, having the EST resources of the developing seed partitioned into embryo, endosperm, and seed
coat compartments relative to vegetative tissues in our
study allows further refinement into determining the
involvement of genes in temporally and spatially specific
metabolic pathways. Analysis of our datasets indicates
good representation of biological processes related to seed
development. 7,222 flax unigenes did not have homologs
to the genes of the model species Arabidopsis and there
were 5,152 unigenes that do not show any homology to
plant species in UniProt. These 5,152 unigenes therefore
likely represent flax-specific genes. Many of these unidentified genes were broadly distributed whereas some were
specific to a single tissue. Further studies of these will provide new insights into flax-specific programs.

Materials and methods
Plant growth conditions and tissue collection

Breeder seed (F11) of Linum usitatissimum cv CDC
Bethune was selfed for 7 generations (F18) as single
plants in the Phytotron at the University of Saskatchewan. F19 seeds were germinated and grown in a growth
chamber using a daily cycle consisting of 16 hours of
light (23°C) and 8 hours of dark (16°C). Tissue samples
were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.
The leaf, stem and flower samples were each collected
from more than 10 individual plants. Dissection of 5,000
flax seeds was performed in order to isolate sufficient
endosperm, embryonic, and seed coat tissues for creating
the cDNA libraries. Five stages of embryos representing
globular, heart, torpedo, cotyledon, and mature stages
were isolated from developing seeds. Seed coat samples
were collected from globular and torpedo embryo stages.
Endosperm tissues were pooled from seeds containing
globular to torpedo embryo stages. Etiolated seedlings
were generated by incubating seeds on MS medium
plates in the dark for four days and prior to harvesting,
the seed coats were removed. The stem peel tissue consisting of epidermis, cortical tissues, phloem, developing

Venglat et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/74

fibers, and cambial tissue was prepared from stems of
four week-old Linum usitatissimum L. cv Norlin germinated and grown as described previously [24].
RNA isolation and cDNA library construction

The stem peel library (PS) was constructed using the
Superscript Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for
cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
[24]. cDNAs were directionally cloned in pCMV-SPORT6
(Invitrogen) and transformed in chemically competent
DH5a-FT E. coli. For the remaining 12 libraries, total
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 74904). On-column DNase digestion was
performed using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen, Cat.
No. 79254). Approximately 2 μg of total RNA from the tissues was used to construct each cDNA library. These 12
libraries were constructed using the Creator SMART
cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Cat. N. 634903).
The 8 libraries derived from seed tissues (globular, heart,
torpedo, cotyledon and mature embryos, as well as endosperm and globular and torpedo stage seed coats) were
prepared as per the manual instructions and are in the
pDNR-lib vector (Clontech).
Two modifications to the manual were made during
construction of the cDNA libraries for leaf, stem, flower
and etiolated seedling. First, the cDNA size fractionation
was performed on agarose gel instead of CHROMA
SPIN-400 column supplied by the kit. The SfiI digested
cDNAs were loaded into a 1% TAE agarose gel, and run
for about 2 cm. The cDNA samples were excised from
the agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 28704). Second, a modified pBluescript II SK(+) vector was used. A ccdb gene,
with SfiI sites at both ends, was inserted between the
EcoRI and XhoI of pBluescript II SK(+). This modified
vector was then digested with SfiI, agarose gel purified,
and used for ligation with the SfiI digested cDNA samples. Ligations to construct the libraries were performed
according to the Creator SMART manual.
EST sequencing and analysis

The libraries were spread onto the LB medium plates
and cultured at 37°C overnight. Individual clones were
picked into 96 or 384-plates manually or automatically
by a Colony Picker (CP-7200, Norgren Systems). The
ESTs were sequenced on the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) at the DNA sequencing facility of
the National Research Council-Plant Biotechnology
Institute (NRC-PBI, Saskatoon, SK, Canada). The HE,
TE and ME libraries were sequenced in two batches
(Table 3). A total of 274,278 sequences were obtained.
The reader can refer to Table 1 for the tissue distribution. The assembling process of EGassembler was used.
Details are given in the EGassembler tutorial [18]

Page 12 of 14

(http://egassembler.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/eassembler4.cgi?pmode=help&i_param=tutorial). In the first step, the
sequences were cleaned and ones with length of less
than 100 bases were removed. The following steps consisted of masking the repeats, vector and organelle
sequences. Masked nucleotides were removed and any
resulting sequences less than 80 bases in length were
also removed. The first clustering process was performed for each separate library. The resulting 78,209
sequences (27,168 contigs and 51,041 singletons) were
then merged, and reassembled, resulting in 30,640 unigenes (15,784 contigs and 14,856 singletons). These unigenes were reallocated back into their respective
individual libraries. All EST sequences and unigenes
have been deposited at http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca/portal/
flax/. The clustering of the ESTs were performed using
Hierarchical Clustering Explorer 3.5 sofware (http://
www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hce/power/power.html) [22]. The
number of EST reads for each unigene in each of the 13
different tissues was used as the input data for HCE3.5
software with parameters set for Pearson correlation
coefficient for similarity/distance measure and average
linkage method for hierarchical clustering.
BLASTX analysis of flax unigenes against the six plant
genomes were performed using the proteomes from the
respective species: Arabidopsis thaliana ’ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR9_genome_release/
TAIR9_sequences/’; Oryza sativa ’ftp://ftp.plantbiology.

Microscopy
Clearing

Fertilized ovules were cleared for 2 days in chloral
hydrate solution (8:1:2 chloral hydrate - glycerol - water
w/v/v) and viewed with a compound microscope (Leica
DMR) using Nomarski optics.
Scanning Electron Microscopy

Samples were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in
1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated in a graded acetone series as described [61]. Samples were mounted on
aluminum stubs and coated with gold in an Edwards
S150B sputter coater. Observations were made with a
Phillips 505 scanning electron microscope at 30 kV and
recorded on Fujifilm FP-100b professional film. Images
were scanned and treated in Adobe Photoshop CS
(Adobe Systems, San Jose, California) to improve the
contrast and place scale bars.
