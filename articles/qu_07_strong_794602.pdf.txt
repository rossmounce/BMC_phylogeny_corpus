Abstract
Background: The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members, falling into
two subfamilies. Subfamily 1 is composed of ETR1 and ERS1, and subfamily 2 is composed of ETR2,
ERS2, and EIN4. Although mutations have been isolated in the genes encoding all five family
members, the only previous insertion allele of ERS1 (ers1-2) is a partial loss-of-function mutation
based on our analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of signaling mediated
by subfamily-1 ethylene receptors through isolation and characterization of null mutations.
Results: We isolated new T-DNA insertion alleles of subfamily 1 members ERS1 and ETR1 (ers13 and etr1-9, respectively), both of which are null mutations based on molecular, biochemical, and
genetic analyses. Single mutants show an ethylene response similar to wild type, although both
mutants are slightly hypersensitive to ethylene. Double mutants of ers1-3 with etr1-9, as well as with
the previously isolated etr1-7, display a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype more
pronounced than that observed with any previously characterized combination of ethylene
receptor mutations. Dark-grown etr1-9;ers1-3 and etr1-7;ers1-3 seedlings display a constitutive
triple-response phenotype. Light-grown etr1-9;ers1-3 and etr1-7;ers1-3 plants are dwarfed, largely
sterile, exhibit premature leaf senescence, and develop novel filamentous structures at the base of
the flower. A reduced level of ethylene response was still uncovered in the double mutants,
indicating that subfamily 2 receptors can independently contribute to signaling, with evidence
suggesting that this is due to their interaction with the Raf-like kinase CTR1.
Conclusion: Our results are consistent with the ethylene receptors acting as redundant negative
regulators of ethylene signaling, but with subfamily 1 receptors playing the predominant role. Loss
of a single member of subfamily 1 is largely compensated for by the activity of the other member,
but loss of both subfamily members results in a strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotype.
The role of subfamily 1 members is greater than previously suspected and analysis of the double
mutant null for both ETR1 and ERS1 uncovers novel roles for the receptors not previously
characterized.

Background
The simple gas ethylene serves as a diffusible hormone in
plants [1,2]. Ethylene regulates seed germination, seedling growth, leaf and petal abscission, organ senescence,
fruit ripening, and responses to stress and pathogens.
Mutants affecting ethylene responses have been isolated
in Arabidopsis, and characterization of these mutants has
led to the identification of ethylene receptors and several
downstream components in the ethylene signal transduction pathway [3-5].
The Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family consists of five
members: ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2 and EIN4 [6,4,7]. The
ethylene receptors have similar overall structures with
transmembrane domains near their N-termini and putative signaling motifs in their C-terminal halves, but can be
divided into two subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis and some shared structural features [3,6,4]. All five
receptor members contain three highly conserved transmembrane domains that incorporate the ethylene binding site, and a GAF domain of unknown function in their
N-terminal halves [7-10]. The subfamily 1 receptors ETR1
and ERS1 have a highly conserved histidine kinase
domain containing all the required motifs essential for
kinase functionality, with histidine kinase activity for
both having been demonstrated in vitro [11,12]. The subfamily 2 receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 lack residues
considered essential for histidine kinase activity and have
instead been proposed to act as serine/threonine kinases
[12]. Some of the ethylene receptors (ETR1, ETR2 and
EIN4) possess a receiver domain in addition to a histidine
kinase-like domain.
To define role of the receptors in signaling, loss-of-function mutations were initially isolated in four out of the
five Arabidopsis ethylene receptors, no mutation being
isolated for ERS1 [13]. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations
in any single ethylene receptor demonstrated little or no
effect upon seedling growth, consistent with functional
overlap within the receptor family. Plants with multiple
LOF mutations in the receptors demonstrated a constitutive ethylene response, indicating that the receptors are
negative regulators of ethylene signaling [13]. These
effects of receptors upon signaling are apparently due to
their physical association with the Raf-like kinase CTR1
[14-16]. According to the current model, CTR1 actively
suppresses ethylene responses in the air (absence of ethylene). Ethylene binding by the receptors results in a conformational change in CTR1, reducing its kinase activity and
relieving repression of the ethylene response pathway.
Because CTR1 is physically associated with the receptors,
loss of a sufficient number of ethylene receptors, such as
occurs with the higher order LOF mutations, results in a
redistribution of CTR1 from the membrane to the soluble
fraction [15]. Without membrane localization, CTR1 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/3

apparently unable to suppress the ethylene responses,
which results in a constitutive ethylene response phenotype.
Recently, a T-DNA insertion allele into the 5' untranslated
region of ERS1 was identified and this mutant allele
named ers1-2 [17-19]. The responsiveness to ethylene of
the ers1-2 mutant plants was similar to that of wild-type
plants. But when combined with an etr1-7 LOF mutation,
the etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant displayed an ethylene
response phenotype when grown in the absence of ethylene, this effect being more pronounced in light-grown
plants than in dark-grown seedlings. Although these data
reveal a significant role for the subfamily 1 receptors in
signaling, the degree to which they contribute is unclear
because transcript for ers1-2 could be detected[17,18].
Here we report on the isolation and analysis of two new
T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of ETR1 and ERS1, named
etr1-9 and ers1-3. Our results indicate that both etr1-9 and
ers1-3 are null alleles for their genes, whereas ers1-2 is a
partial LOF allele. Analysis of the etr1-7;ers1-3 and etr19;ers1-3 double mutants indicates that the subfamily 1
members ETR1 and ERS1 play more predominant roles in
the regulation of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis than
previously suspected.

Results
Isolation of the ers1-3 and etr1-9 T-DNA insertion
mutations
To obtain additional T-DNA insertion mutations in ERS1
and ETR1, we screened the Wisconsin Basta population
representing 72,960 T-DNA insertion lines from the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility [20]. A line was identified that
contained a T-DNA insertion within the first exon of ERS1
(Fig. 1A). Sequence at the T-DNA junction with ERS1 was
ATACTATTTTAAGAACCACaatgagtaaata(taaatggcgacatgtccggg), with capitals indicating ERS1 sequence and parentheses indicating T-DNA left border sequence. This
mutation was named ers1-3 to differentiate it from the
previously isolated ers1-2 insertion mutation [17,18].
Northern blot analysis indicated an absence of ERS1 transcript in the ers1-3 background, consistent with ers1-3
being a complete null allele (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis demonstrated that the expression level of ETR1
remained the same in both the wild-type and ers1-3 backgrounds, suggesting that ETR1 did not functionally compensate for the loss of ERS1 (Fig. 1D), functional
compensation having been found in some cases upon
elimination of ethylene receptors in tomato [21].

From the same T-DNA population, we also identified a TDNA insertion allele of ETR1, which we named etr1-9 to
differentiate it from the previously identified etr1-5, etr16, etr1-7, and etr1-8 LOF mutants [13]. The T-DNA was
inserted into the fourth exon of ETR1 (Fig. 1A). Sequence

at the T-DNA junction with ETR1 was GGTAAAAGACTCTGGAGCtcca, with capitals indicating ETR1 sequence and
lower case indicating random sequence between ETR1
and left border of T-DNA. Northern blot analysis indicated that no full-length ETR1 message was made in the
etr1-9 mutant seedlings (Fig. 1B). However, a highly
expressed truncated transcript was found at a lower
molecular weight. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that this
transcript originated from the 5' end of the gene, prior to
the site of the T-DNA insertion (Fig. 1C). To determine
whether any truncated protein was made, immunoblot
analysis was performed and no full-length or truncated
ETR1 receptor was detected (the hypothetical truncated
ETR1 protein being predicted to consist of 515 amino
acids with a molecular weight of 58 kD) (Fig. 1D). Therefore, etr1-9 is a null mutation of ETR1. The increased
expression of the truncated transcript from the native promoter may arise as part of compensatory mechanism due
to lack of signaling by ETR1. The etr1-9 allele is in the WS
background, the same as the ers1-2 and ers1-3 mutant alleles, and is thus more suitable for genetic crosses than the
previous LOF mutant alleles of ETR1, which are in the
Columbia background.
Quantitative analysis of the ethylene-induced seedling
growth response in single etr1 and ers1 T-DNA insertion
mutants
Both etr1-9 and ers1-3 T-DNA insertion mutants displayed
a wild-type-like growth phenotype. To gain quantitative
information, ethylene dose response analyses were performed for the T-DNA insertion mutants ers1-2, ers1-3,
and etr1-9 in the WS background and for the etr1-7 LOF
mutant in the Columbia background (Fig. 2).
Homozygous etiolated seedlings were grown in air and in
ethylene at different concentrations ranging from 0 to
1000 μL L-1. The inhibitor aminoethylvinyl-glycine (AVG)
was included in growth media to inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by seedlings. The etr1-9 mutant seedlings displayed
reduced hypocotyl elongation in comparison with the
wild-type WS control at all tested ethylene concentrations,
which is consistent with dose-response analysis of the
etr1-7 loss-of-function mutant (Fig. 2; [13]). This effect of
the etr1-7 mutation upon growth has been demonstrated
to be due to enhanced ethylene responsiveness of the
seedling [22]. We confirmed the enhanced responsiveness
of etr1-9 by treating the seedlings with 100 μM AgNO3,
which inhibits ethylene perception by the receptors. The
hypocotyl length of 4-day-old etiolated seedlings of etr1-9
was similar to wild type with Ag-treatment [10.25 mm
(SD = 1.24) for etr1-9 compared to 10.54 mm (SD = 1.18)
for wild type) but was significantly shorter than wild type
when grown on AVG [9.25 mm (SD = 1.03) for etr1-9
compared to 10.25 mm (SD = 1.78)]. The etr1-9 mutant
exhibited a 10% reduction in hypocotyl length comparing
the AVG to Ag treatments, whereas wild type exhibited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/3

only a 3% reduction in hypocotyl length. As found with
etr1-7, this demonstrates that etr1-9 requires ethylene perception for manifestation of the shortened hypocotyl phenotype [22]. The shortened hypocotyl of etr1-9 found
with AVG treatment would be due to the low levels of
endogenous ethylene production not eliminated by the
treatment with this ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor.
The ers1-3 mutant was similar to wild type in the absence
of exogenous ethylene (Fig. 2). But ers1-3 exhibited a
growth response to 0.01 μL/L ethylene, indicating a
greater sensitivity to ethylene than wild type which did
not show a response at this ethylene concentration. In
addition, the ethylene-responsiveness of the ers1-3
mutant was slightly greater than that of ers1-2, this difference potentially arising due to the presence of low levels
of the ERS1 transcript in the ers1-2 background but lacking in the ers1-3 background [17,18]. The difference in the
ethylene responses between ers1-3 and etr1-9, particularly
when examined without exogenous ethylene treatment, is
likely due to difference in their expression, ETR1 being
constitutively expressed but ERS1 being induced by ethylene. These data indicate that single LOF mutations in
either ETR1 or ERS1 result in some hypersensitivity to ethylene.
Dark-grown seedlings of the etr1-7;ers1-3 and etr19;ers1-3 double mutants display a strong constitutive
triple-response phenotype
ERS1 and ETR1 are closely related at the sequence level
and, together, make up subfamily 1 of the receptors
[3,6,4]. To gain information on how subfamily 1 receptors contribute to ethylene signaling, we constructed double mutant etr1;ers1 combinations by crossing ers1-3 with
etr1-7 as well as with etr1-9. Effects of the mutations upon
the triple-response phenotype of dark-grown seedlings
were examined. As shown in Fig. 3A, the triple response of
wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings to ethylene is characterized by inhibition of root and hypocotyl elongation, an
exaggerated apical hook, and a thickening of the hypocotyls [23,24]. These features contrast sharply with the etiolated phenotype observed in dark-grown seedlings
exposed to air. The single etr1 and ers1 mutant seedlings
displayed phenotypes similar to wild type when grown in
the absence of ethylene (in air) (Fig. 3A). However, double mutants of etr1 with ers1 displayed a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype when grown in the absence of
ethylene. Significantly, the etr1-7;ers1-3 and the etr19;ers1-3 double mutants displayed a more pronounced
phenotype (shorter hypocotyl and exaggerated apical
hook) than the etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant. This is consistent with our hypothesis that ers1-2 is a partial LOF
allele and that ers1-3 is a true null allele. Both the etr17;ers1-3 and etr1-9;ers1-3 mutants displayed a similar constitutive ethylene-response-like phenotype, consistent

with the newly identified etr1-9 being a null allele like the
previously characterized etr1-7.
We confirmed that the severe constitutive ethyleneresponse phenotype of etr1-9;ers1-3 was due to lack of the
receptors by transformation of this line with wild-type
ETR1 (Fig. 3B). For this purpose, a genomic clone containing both promoter and coding regions of ETR1 was used.
Transgenic lines were indistinguishable from a wild-type
control when examined for growth in the absence of ethylene (in air).

From this point forward in the text, when we refer to
etr1;ers1-3 mutants we are referring to both the etr1-7;ers13 and etr1-9;ers1-3 mutants, with the intent here to indicate that both exhibited the same phenotype. We refer to
the specific genotypes as appropriate to the experiment
and where pictured in the figures. When grown in the light
(Fig. 4A, B, C), the etr1;ers1-3 mutant plants were
extremely reduced in stature as is found with a constitutive ethylene-response mutant, but with a severity greater

than that found with the ctr1 mutant or any previously
characterized receptor mutant combination including the
double mutant etr1-6;ers1-2 and the quadruple mutant
etr1;etr2;ein4;ers2 [13]. Leaves of the etr1;ers1-3 mutants
were epinastic (Fig. 4A, B, C). Epinasty is a well-documented effect of ethylene and has been previously
observed in ctr1 mutants and higher order ethylene-receptor mutants [13,25].
Leaves of the etr1;ers1-3 double mutants senesced prematurely when compared to wild type (Fig. 4A, B, C and Fig.
5). An effect upon leaf senescence has not been previously
reported with other receptor mutant combinations but is
consistent with the role of ethylene as a regulator of the
senescence response in plants. Analysis of the weaker etr17;ers1-2 mutant also revealed a degree of premature senescence but not as pronounced as that observed with the
etr1;ers1-3 mutants (Fig. 5). By treatment of the weaker
etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant with the ethylene precursor
ACC, we were able to induce a level of leaf senescence
comparable to that observed with etr1-9;ers1-3 (Fig. 5). In
addition, the ACC treatment resulted in an inhibition of
root growth and decreased production of leaves from the
axillary meristems of etr1-7;ers1-2, so that the overall morphology of the plant appeared more similar to that of etr19;ers1-3. Our ability to phenocopy features of etr1-9;ers13 by ACC treatment of etr1-7;ers1-2 is consistent with the

etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant showing a more pronounced
ethylene response phenotype than that observed in wild
type as well as etr1-7;ers1-2 plants.
The ability of the etr1;ers1-3 mutant plants to bolt was
affected by the light conditions used for growth. The
etr1;ers1-3 mutant plants died without bolting when
grown at 120 μE light, producing greater than wild-type
numbers of leaves under this growth condition. Previously, the etr1;etr2;ein4;ers2 quadruple LOF mutant was
often observed to wilt and die before bolting, potentially
for similar reasons [13]. Improved growth of etr1;ers1-3
occurred when the plants were grown under constant light
at light levels below 60 μE. Under these growth conditions, the timing for the transition from vegetative to
reproductive growth for the etr1;ers1-3 double mutants
occurred similarly to wild type (etr1-7;ers1-3 produced 15
rosette leaves compared to 13.3 for wild type). The wildtype-like bolting time of the etr1;ers1-3 mutants differs
from that found with the etr1-7;ers1-2 mutant, which is
delayed in bolting and produces many additional leaves
from axillary meristems (Fig. 4D) [19]. But, as described
in the previous paragraph, by optimizing growth conditions and treating etr1-7;ers1-2 with the ethylene precursor
ACC (Fig. 5B), we could partially phenocopy etr1-9;ers1-3
indicating that this difference in bolting may arise due to

differences in the level of signaling through the ethylene
pathway.
Although the etr1;ers1-3 mutants flowered, they had
severely reduced fertility and altered floral morphology
with an apparent decrease in the size of some floral organs
compared to wild type (Fig. 4E, F). The carpels appeared
normal in size, but the outer whorls of stamens, petals,
and sepals were reduced in size. Floral buds appeared as
though they had progressed through stage 13 as defined
according to [26]. The flowers had open buds and visible
petals, but did not progress to later stages during which
petals and stamens elongate above the stigamatic papillae.
Most flowers contained 4 stamens instead of the usual 6.
In most cases, no seeds were produced. In a few cases,
however, small siliques were made containing seeds of
reduced size, indicating that the double mutants could
self-pollinate. We obtained 20 seeds from etr1-7;ers1-3
and 6 seeds from etr1-9;ers1-3 plants, but none of the

seeds germinated. These effects upon flower development
are similar to those reported for an etr1-6;ers1-2 double
mutant [19], but not quite as severe as those found in the
etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant which often did not progress
beyond stage 11 (Fig. 4F) [19].
We also observed the formation of novel organs at the
base of the pedicel of etr1;ers1-3 mutants (Fig. 4G, H).
These appeared at the position where a subtending leaf
(bract) is formed in many non-Arabidopsis plant species.
The organs appeared filamentous in morphology, suggesting that not only is a developmental pathway being activated that is normally suppressed in Arabidopsis, but that
there may be homeotic conversion of the organ produced
from a leaf-like to a flower-like structure. We also found
similar filamentous organs when we examined etr1-7;ers12 under optimized growth conditions that promoted bolting (Fig. 4I). The formation of the same organs in etr19;ers1-3 and etr1-7;ers1-2, which were generated with

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:3

independent insertion mutations, confirms that loss of
the receptors is the basis for formation of the filamentous
organs.
Expression of a wild-type ETR1 transgene in the etr19;ers1-3 mutant background rescued all the phenotypes
we observed in the etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant. The transgenic lines were indistinguishable from wild type in terms
of stature, leaf senescence, and flower development. In
addition, the transgenic plants no longer made the filamentous organs at the base of the pedicel. These data are
thus consistent with all the phenotypes found in the double mutant as having originated from lack of the two
receptors ETR1 and ERS1.
Ethylene responsiveness of the etr1-9;ers1-3 double
mutant
The constitutive ethylene-response phenotype for the
etr1;ers1-3 double mutants is stronger than that observed
for any previous receptor mutant combination. Because
both ETR1 and ERS1 belong to subfamily 1, this raises the
question as to whether the ethylene response phenotype
has reached maximal levels in the double mutant. If so,
then this would imply that the subfamily 1 receptors are
absolutely required for mediation of the ethylene
response. However, if the etr1;ers1-3 mutant still displays
an ethylene response, then this would indicate that subfamily 2 receptors are able to contribute to the ethylene
response independently of subfamily 1 receptors. We
therefore examined the ethylene response in the etr19;ers1-3 double mutant background.

In dark grown seedlings, we observed a small but significant difference (P < 0.01 in Student's t test) between the
hypocotyl lengths of etr1-9;ers1-3 seedlings grown in the
presence or absence of 10 μL/L ethylene (Fig. 6A). However, due to the small effect found in the dark-grown seedlings, we also examined light-grown seedlings grown in
the presence or absence of the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane (ACC) (Fig. 6B). ACC treatment did not significantly affect rosette leaf size but did result in a
reduction in root growth of the mutant seedlings. This
result suggests that subfamily 2 receptors can act independently of subfamily 1 receptors in transmission of the
ethylene signal for at least some growth responses.
Ethylene signaling by the receptors occurs through regulation of the kinase CTR1. Previous work has demonstrated
that CTR1, which contains no transmembrane domains,
is membrane localized due to its physical association with
the ethylene receptors [15]. We could still detect a reduced
level of CTR1 in the membranes of etr1-9;ers1-3 (Fig. 6C),
consistent with subfamily 2 receptors being able to bind
CTR1 independently of the subfamily 1 receptors. This
result suggests that the residual level of ethylene response

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/3

found in etr1-9;ers1-3 is mediated by the regulation of
CTR1 activity through subfamily 2 receptors. In addition,
as previously found when examining the levels of membrane-associated CTR1 in the etr1-7 single mutant [15],
we found increased levels of membrane-associated CTR1
in the etr1-9 and in the ers1-3 single mutants. This result
suggests that loss of a subfamily 1 receptor may be partially compensated for by the binding of additional CTR1
to the remaining ethylene receptors.

Discussion
In Arabidopsis, ethylene signaling is mediated by a receptor
family consisting of five members. LOF mutations have
been isolated in the genes encoding all five receptors and
these mutations have been used to assess the contribution
of each member to the plant ethylene response [13,1719,22]. Our results indicate that the previously isolated TDNA insertion mutation ers1-2 is a partial LOF allele not
a null allele of ERS1. Northern-blot analysis indicated that
although there was a substantial reduction in the message
level, full-length ERS1 transcripts were still detectable in
the ers1-2 background [17]. The T-DNA insertion in the 5'UTR of ERS1 in the ers1-2 allele could potentially result in
a null allele because the altered ERS1 transcript contains
additional upstream start codons arising from the T-DNA
sequence [18]. However, the wild-type ERS1 gene contains two upstream start codons in the 5'-UTR, which
apparently do not disrupt the correct transcription of the
gene. Consistent with ers1-2 being partial LOF rather than
a null allele, we found that the etr1-7;ers1-3 and etr19;ers1-3 double mutants displayed a stronger constitutive
ethylene-response phenotype than the etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant. The isolation of the ers1-3 allele allows for a
reassessment of the contribution of ERS1 and the subfamily 1 receptors to ethylene signaling.
Previous work has shown that ethylene receptors are negative regulators and function redundantly in ethylene signaling [13]. Our results are consistent with this model,
and indicate that the subfamily 1 receptors play a greater
role in signaling than the subfamily 2 receptors. First, single LOF mutations in either subfamily 1 receptor ETR1 or
ERS1 resulted in a slight increase in ethylene sensitivity,
whereas single LOF mutations in subfamily 2 receptors
were indistinguishable from wild type [13]. Second, the
etr1;ers1-3 double mutants displayed a strong constitutive
ethylene-response phenotype, greater than that observed
with any previously characterized mutant combination
including a quadruple LOF mutant of ETR1 and the subfamily 2 receptors [13]. In contrast, a triple mutant of subfamily 2 receptors is primarily distinguished by an
increase in its ethylene sensitivity such that it exhibits a
partial triple response phenotype due to its responsiveness to endogenous ethylene levels in the seedling [22].
Third, the pronounced effect of the etr1;ers1-3 double

mutants on signaling was not dependent upon growth in
the light, as found in a previous study of the etr1;ers1-2
mutant [19], indicating that a predominant role for subfamily 1 receptors may be a general mechanistic feature of
ethylene signal transduction.
Our results also suggest that signaling by the subfamily 2
receptors may be partially dependent upon the subfamily
1 receptors. It was previously found that when LOF mutations of subfamily 2 members are combined with the LOF
etr1-7 mutation, the higher order loss-of-function
mutants display a progressively stronger constitutive ethylene response phenotype [13]. Thus under these conditions of analysis, where subfamily 1 member ERS1 is still
present, the subfamily 2 members appear to make significant contributions to signaling. We find, however, that the
etr1-9;ers1-3 mutant shows a strong constitutive ethylene
response phenotype which is only minimally affected by
ethylene treatment, suggesting that there is little additional signaling by the subfamily 2 receptors under conditions when both subfamily 1 receptors are missing.
Consistent with the hypothesis that the function of subfamily 2 receptors may be partially dependent on subfamily 1 members is the finding that the dominant
ethylene-insensitive mutant of ETR2 (etr2-1) is less effective in a etr1-7 background that lacks ETR1 than in a wildtype background [22], as well as the finding that the etr17;ers1-2 mutant cannot be complemented by a subfamily
2 receptor [18].

Examination of the etr1;ers1-3 double mutants reveals
physiological effects upon plant growth and development
not previously noted in the examination of higher order
mutant combinations of the ethylene receptors, in particular the extremely reduced stature of the seedlings, the
premature leaf senescence, and the development of the filamentous structures at the base of the flower. In addition,
we are able to confirm some of the developmental defects
found in the etr1;ers1-2 mutants, in particular the floral
organ defects such as reduced organ size and numbers, as
well as the reduced fertility. This is important because
ers1-2 was generated from a T-DNA that contains part of
the AP3 promoter, which has been found to result in fertility problems in some of the insertion lines [20]. Expression from the AP3 promoter may account for some of the
variability in the point at which flower development terminated in the previously characterized etr1;ers1-2 lines,
in particular the termination of flower development in
stage 11 of the etr1-7;ers1-2 mutant [19], which is earlier
than the stage 13 termination observed in the etr1-6;ers12 mutant [19] as well as the newly isolated etr1;ers1-3
mutants.

flower under standard light conditions for Arabidopsis
growth, potentially due to stress responses, which resulted
in bleaching of the leaves and a cessation of growth prior
to bolting. But, when the light intensity was reduced, the
transition from vegetative to reproductive growth of
etr1;ers1-3 occurred similarly to wild type. Interestingly,
the previously characterized etr1-7;ers1-2 mutant shows a
substantial delay in flowering time compared to wild type,
as measured either by days to flowering (63 days compared to 22) or by the number of rosette leaves produced
before flowering (25–45 more rosette leaves than wild
type) [19]. Most of these additional leaves arise from axillary meristems, and under optimized growth conditions,
etr1-7;ers1-2 did not exhibit as pronounced a delay in
flowering, often producing similar numbers of leaves as
wild type from the shoot apical meristem (Figure 5). The
etr1-7;ers1-2 mutant still initiated more leaf formation
than etr1;ers1-3 from the axillary meristems, but axillary
leaf production was reduced by treatment with the ethylene precursor ACC, indicating this phenotype may arise
from differences in activation of the ethylene signaling
pathway in the different backgrounds. Overall, our results
suggest that ethylene signaling interacts with lightdependent signaling pathways in several ways, both
affecting the light stress response and the cues that regulate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.
The greater role played by the subfamily 1 receptors compared to the subfamily 2 receptors in ethylene signaling
raises the question as to which features of subfamily 1
members are important for this role. Many features are
shared between the two subfamilies. Both subfamily-1
and subfamily-2 ethylene receptors appear to have a similar affinity for ethylene [7] and localize to the ER membrane [15,27]. Thus, the most distinctive characteristic of
the subfamily 1 receptors is that each possesses a functional histidine kinase domain [11,12]. To date only
minor roles in signaling have been attributed to the histidine kinase activity [28,29] but, due to the lack of an ERS1
null allele, it has not been previously possible to eliminate
histidine kinase activity of the receptors in the backgrounds examined. Thus, a reevaluation of the role of
kinase activity in signaling is needed. Our results do indicate, however, that histidine kinase activity is not an absolute requirement for an ethylene response, because we still
detected a weak ethylene response in the etr1-9;ers1-3
double mutant, primarily in the effect of ethylene upon
root growth. Plants thus contain an ethylene signaling
pathway that does not require the kinase activity of the
subfamily 1 receptors, although the degree to which this
pathway contributes to signaling is not known at this
point.
The interaction between the ethylene receptors and the
Raf-like kinase CTR1 represents an alternative mechanism

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/3

by which subfamily 1 receptors may play a greater role
than subfamily 2 receptors in mediating the ethylene
response. CTR1 is a negative regulator of ethylene signaling and loss-of-function mutations in CTR1 result in a
constitutive ethylene response phenotype [16,25]. CTR1
physically interacts with the receptors and, as a result,
localizes to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum
[15]. Our results demonstrate that loss of subfamily 1
receptors results in a decrease in the levels of CTR1 at the
membrane, which correlates with the strong constitutive
ethylene response phenotype observed in the etr1;ers1-3
double mutants. We still observe some CTR1 present on
the membrane, however, indicating that subfamily 2 is
sufficient for localization of a proportion of CTR1 to the
membrane. These data, coupled with our previous analysis of receptor LOF mutants [15], indicate that both subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 are capable of independently
localizing CTR1 to the membrane. Thus the difference in
roles of the two receptor subfamilies is not simply due to
one subfamily interacting with CTR1 and the other not.
Two observations, however, suggest that the interaction of
CTR1 with subfamily 1 receptors is not necessarily equivalent to its interaction with subfamily 2 receptors. First,
when analyzed by two-hybrid analysis, subfamily 1 members ETR1 and ERS1 both exhibit a stronger interaction
with CTR1 than does subfamily 2 member ETR2 [14,22].
Second, the level of membrane-associated CTR1 does not
always correlate with the level of signaling through the
ethylene pathway. Significantly, single null alleles in
either of the subfamily 1 members ETR1 and ERS1 actually result in a higher level of CTR1 associated with the
membrane (Figure 6). This effect is only found with LOF
mutations in subfamily 1, not with subfamily 2 [15], and
may serve to partially compensate for the loss of the subfamily 1 receptor. But, even with the higher levels of
CTR1, the etr1 and ers1 mutant seedlings still exhibit
increased sensitivity to ethylene (Figure 2) rather than the
decreased sensitivity predicted if the ethylene response
were directly proportional to the amount of CTR1 present.
Thus, the predominant contribution of subfamily 1 receptors to ethylene signaling may arise from their possessing
a greater effectiveness at maintaining CTR1 in an active
state compared with the subfamily 2 receptors.

Conclusion
A model for ethylene signaling that incorporates the
results from the analysis of the etr1;ers1-3 mutant is
shown in Figure 7. Our data are consistent with a greater
role for ETR1 and ERS1 (subfamily 1) in the regulation of
ethylene signaling as compared to the other three members of the ethylene receptor family (subfamily 2). Loss of
either subfamily 1 receptor is partially compensated for by
the other, but loss of both together results in a strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotype. Previous analysis

media at a concentration of 5 μM as indicated to inhibit
ethylene biosynthesis by seedlings. Plates were placed in
sealed containers with 0 to 1000 μL/L ethylene. To examine seedlings growing in the absence of ethylene, hydrocarbon-free air was passed to remove any ethylene
synthesized by the seedlings. All containers were kept in
the dark at 22°C. Seedlings were examined after 3.5 or 4
days of growth, time 0 corresponding to the time when
the plates were removed from 4°C and brought to 22°C.
To measure hypocotyl length, seedlings were grown on
vertically oriented square plates so as to simplify later
scanning of the plates. Seedlings were scanned and
hypocotyl length measured in NIH Image (version 1.6,
National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Plant growth conditions
To examine the triple response of seedlings to ethylene
[30,31], seeds were grown on Petri plates. The inhibitor
aminoethylvinyl-glycine (AVG) was included in growth

To examine growth in the light, the etr1;ers1 mutants were

suggested that the predominant role for subfamily 1
might be limited to light-grown plants [19], but our analysis of the etr1;ers1-3 mutants indicates that the model
also applies to dark-grown seedlings, suggesting that this
model may apply to most aspects of ethylene signal transduction. The etr1;ers1-3 double mutant is only minimally
affected by ethylene, but the residual response detected
indicates that subfamily 2 receptors are capable of initiating a response independently of subfamily 1. As indicated
in the model, the greater role for subfamily 1 receptors
compared to subfamily 2 receptors may lie in an
enhanced ability to stimulate the kinase activity of CTR1.

Figure 7
Model for signaling by ethylene receptors
Model for signaling by ethylene receptors. CTR1 (shown in gray) interacts with all five receptors, but subfamily 1 receptors
activate CTR1 to a greater extent than subfamily 2 receptors. In the absence of ethylene (in air), the kinase domain of CTR1
actively represses ethylene responses. Ethylene binding to the receptors induces a conformational change in CTR1 that
reduces its kinase activity, thereby relieving repression of the ethylene response pathway. Loss of subfamily 1 receptors (the
etr1;ers1 mutant), leads to the stimulation of ethylene responses because there is not enough active CTR1 to suppress the
pathway. In the figure, active CTR1 is indicated by a circle and inactive CTR1 by a square; the size of the CTR1 symbol indicates its relative contribution to signaling.

Murashige and Skoog basal media with Gamborg's vitamins (pH 5.75; Sigma, St. Louis), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and
8% (w/v) agar. Optimal growth was observed under
reduced light intensity (below 60 μE), when using standard fluorescent bulbs augmented with 18,000 K fluorescent bulbs (e.g. Aqua-Glo, Rolf C. Hagen Corp.,
Mansfield, MA). For treatment with ACC, segregating
seedlings were initially grown under standard conditions
so as to identify the double mutant by phenotype and the
seedlings then transferred to media containing 50 μM
ACC for the times indicated.
Identification and genetic analysis of T-DNA insertion
mutant alleles in ERS1 and ETR1
Both ers1-3 and etr1-9 were isolated from Wisconsin Basta
population at the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison [20], which contains
72,960 BASTA-resistant lines in the ecotype Wassilewskija
(WS) transformed with an activation-Tag vector, pSK1015
[32]. The ers1 mutant was identified with a PCR primer for
the T-DNA left border (5'-CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3') and an ERS1-specific primer (5'-CAGAGAGTTCTGTCACTCCTGGAAATGGT-3').
Plants
containing the wild-type ERS1 gene were identified by use
of PCR with the above ERS1 primer and a second ERS1specific primer (5'-CACAACCGCGCAAGAGACTTTAGCA
ATAGT-3'). The etr1-9 mutant was identified by a PCRbased method using an ETR1-specific primer (5'-GCGGTTGTTAAGAAATTACCCATCACACT-3') and the same TDNA left border primer as described above. Plants containing the wild-type ETR1 gene were identified by use of
PCR with the above ETR1 primer and a second ETR1-specific primer (5'-ATCCAAATGTTACCCTCCATCAGATTCAC-3'). PCR conditions for identification of the T-DNA
inserts included: preheating at 96°C for 8 min (hot-start);
94°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 2 min (40
cycles); with a final extension at 72°C for 4 min.

To generate the ers1;etr1 double mutants, the ers1-3
mutant was crossed to the etr1-7 and etr1-9 mutants. For
genotyping the ers1-2,ers1-3, and etr1-9 mutations, PCR
was performed using the T-DNA left-border primer and
the gene-specific primer as described above. The etr1-7
mutation was identified by PCR-based genotyping of F2
progeny from the crossed plants as described [13].
The etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant was transformed with a
previously described full-length ETR1 construct driven by
its native genomic promoter [29]. The construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefacians strain GV3101 and
used to transform an etr1-9;ers1-3/+ line by the floral-dip
method [33]. Lines homozygous for both etr1-9 and ers13 were identified by PCR-based genotyping, and
homozygous for the transgene based on the segregation of
hygromycin resistance and by PCR-based genotyping.

RNA isolation, Northern Blot, and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from 4-d-old Arabidopsis etiolated
seedlings by a modified method of Carpenter and Simon
[34] using TRIzol® Reagent (Gibco BRL, Grand Island,
NY). RNA was separated on 1% (W/V) agarose gels using
the NorthernMax-Gly system (Ambion, Austin, TX). Separated RNAs were transferred to the MagnaCharge nylon
membrane (GE Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN) by the capillary method and fixed by UV-cross linking using GS
Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Singlestranded DNA antisense probes were made using primers
designed to anneal at the 3' end of an ERS1 cDNA clone
(5'-ACTAGTGACTGTCACTGAGAA-3') or an ETR1 cDNA
clone (5'-ATCCAAATGTTACCCTCCATCAGATTCAC-3').
Radio-labeled probes were made and stripped between
hybridizations by using the Strip-EZ PCR system from
Ambion according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Radioactivity was imaged and quantified by phosphor
imaging with a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad Laboratories), using accompanying Quantity One software.

For RT-PCR analysis of the etr1-9 mutant, total RNA was
extracted from plants, treated with RNase-free DNAse
(Invitrogen), and used to make first strand cDNA using
Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Primers were designed to span introns so as to distinguish
cDNA amplification products from genomic DNA amplification products. The primers used were ETR1-5'F (5'
CGTGGAGTATACGGTTC 3') and ETR1-5'R (5' CTGGTGCAAGATTTAGTGTGATG 3') for amplification of a product 5' to the site of the T-DNA insertion, and ETR1-3'F (5'
CATACCGAAAGTTCCAGCCATTC 3') and ETR1-3'R (5'
CAAGCATCCATAACTCGATCCAAATTC 3') for amplification of a product 3' to the site of the T-DNA insertion.
After 25 cycles, the PCR products were examined by gel
electrophoresis and EtBr staining. Primers specific for
ubiquitin, UBQ-SENSE (5'-GTGGTGCTAAGAAGAGGAAGA-3') and UBQ-ANTI, (5'-TCAAGCTTCAACTCCTTCTTT-3'), were used as a control.
Immunoblot analysis
To isolate membrane proteins, plant tissue was homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 20% [v/v] glycerol). As protease
inhibitors, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
1 μg/mL pepstatin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and 10 μg/mL
aprotinin, were included to prevent protein degradation.
The homogenate was filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem-Novobiochem, San Diego, CA), and then centrifuged at 8,000 g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was
centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min, and the membrane
pellet then resuspended in resuspension buffer (10 mM
Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% [v/v]
glycerol) with protease inhibitors. Procedures described

above were all done at 4°C. Protein concentration was
then determined by a modification of the Lowry assay
[35] in which samples were treated with 0.4% (w/v)
sodium deoxycholate [36]. Bovine serum albumin was
used in preparing a standard curve. For the experiment in
Figure 1, 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings were used as the
membrane source. For the experiment in Figure 6, seedlings grown in liquid culture were used as the membrane
source [15]; the double mutant seedlings were initially
selected on Petri dishes based on phenotype then transferred to liquid culture.

Membrane proteins were mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer [125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS,
20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue] containing
100 mM dithiothreitol as a reducing agent. After incubation at 50°C for 1 hour, proteins were separated by SDSPAGE using an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel [37]. Precision Plus Protein all blue Standards were included as
molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Separated proteins were electro-transferred to Immobilon
nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblot
analyses were conducted by use of the anti-ETR1(165–
401), anti-ETR1(401–738), and the anti-CTR1 antibodies, with the anti-(H+-ATPase) and anti-BiP antibodies
used as a membrane and soluble fraction loading controls, respectively [15,29]. Immunodecorated proteins
were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer (Pierce Chemical,
Rockford, IL).
