Characterization and analysis of the cotton
cyclopropane fatty acid synthase family and their
contribution to cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis
Xiao-Hong Yu1, Richa Rawat1 and John Shanklin1,2*

Abstract
Background: Cyclopropane fatty acids (CPA) have been found in certain gymnosperms, Malvales, Litchi and other
Sapindales. The presence of their unique strained ring structures confers physical and chemical properties
characteristic of unsaturated fatty acids with the oxidative stability displayed by saturated fatty acids making them
of considerable industrial interest. While cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPE) are well-known inhibitors of fatty acid
desaturation in animals, CPE can also inhibit the stearoyl-CoA desaturase and interfere with the maturation and
reproduction of some insect species suggesting that in addition to their traditional role as storage lipids, CPE can
contribute to the protection of plants from herbivory.
Results: Three genes encoding cyclopropane synthase homologues GhCPS1, GhCPS2 and GhCPS3 were identified
in cotton. Determination of gene transcript abundance revealed differences among the expression of GhCPS1, 2
and 3 showing high, intermediate and low levels, respectively, of transcripts in roots and stems; whereas GhCPS1
and 2 are both expressed at low levels in seeds. Analyses of fatty acid composition in different tissues indicate that
the expression patterns of GhCPS1 and 2 correlate with cyclic fatty acid (CFA) distribution. Deletion of the Nterminal oxidase domain lowered GhCPS’s ability to produce cyclopropane fatty acid by approximately 70%.
GhCPS1 and 2, but not 3 resulted in the production of cyclopropane fatty acids upon heterologous expression in
yeast, tobacco BY2 cell and Arabidopsis seed.
Conclusions: In cotton GhCPS1 and 2 gene expression correlates with the total CFA content in roots, stems and
seeds. That GhCPS1 and 2 are expressed at a similar level in seed suggests both of them can be considered
potential targets for gene silencing to reduce undesirable seed CPE accumulation. Because GhCPS1 is more active
in yeast than the published Sterculia CPS and shows similar activity when expressed in model plant systems, it
represents a strong candidate gene for CFA accumulation via heterologous expression in production plants.

Background
Fatty acids containing three-carbon carbocyclic rings,
especially cyclopropane fatty acids, occur infrequently in
plants and their major plant producers include Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, Bombaceae, Tilaceae, Gnetaceae and
Sapindaceae [1-4]. They can represent a significant component of seed oils and accumulate to as much as 40%
in Litchi chinensis [1,5].

[8,9] and parasites [10]. There are two principle classes
of bacterial cyclopropane synthases: the Escherichia coli
cyclopropane synthase (ECPS) type that uses unsaturated phospholipids as substrates and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis cyclopropane mycolic acid synthases
(CMAs) that perform the introduction of cis-cyclopropane rings at proximal and distal positions of unsaturated mycolic acids [11-14]. Despite their different
substrates the two classes of enzymes share up to 33%
sequence identity suggesting a common fold and reaction mechanism. Moreover, a shared reaction mechanism is suggested by the fact that both E. coli CPS and
M. tuberculosis CMA active site residues are almost

completely conserved and harbor a bicarbonate ion in
their active site [15,16].
Although CPA had been identified in a few plant
seeds as early as 1960s [17], the key gene responsible for
their biochemical synthesis was not identified for more
than three decades when Bao et al. [8] identified a
cyclopropane synthase from S. foetida. The SfCPS is a
microsomal-localized membrane enzyme, which catalyzes the addition of a methylene group derived from Sadenosyl-L-methionine across the double bond of oleic
acid esterified to the sn-1 position of PC [9]. The S. foetida enzyme is the first plant CPS that has been characterized, the other plant CPS has been reported to date is
from Litchi sinensis (WO/2006087364).
E. coli CPS is thought to be involved in the long-term
survival of non-growing cells and its expression can be
associated with environmental stresses [6]. Plant CPEs
inhibit some insect stearoyl-CoA desaturases thereby
interfering with their maturation and reproduction, suggesting that in addition to their role as storage lipids,
CPE can also serve as protective agents. CPE are also
strong inhibitors of a variety of fatty acid desaturases in
animals [18-21], and feeding animals with CPE -containing oilseeds, such as cotton seed meal, leads to accumulation of hard fats and other physiological disorders
[20,22,23]. For the same reasons vegetable oils that contain CPE must be treated with high temperature hydrogenation before human consumption. These treatments
add to processing costs and also result in the accumulation of undesirable trans-fatty acids. Therefore, reducing
the levels of CPE in cotton seed oil by gene-silencing or
other techniques could reduce processing costs and the
associated production of undesirable trans fatty acids as
well as increasing the value of processed seed meal for
food consumption (US2010/0115669).
Cyclic fatty acids, especially CPA such as dihydrosterculic acid, are desirable for numerous industrial applications and therefore it would be useful to identify
candidate enzymes for heterologous expression in production plants with the goal of optimizing the accumulation of CPAs. CPAs have physical characteristics
somewhere in between saturated and mono unsaturated
fatty acids. The strained bond angles of the carbocyclic
ring are responsible for their unique chemistry and physical properties. Hydrogenation results in ring opening
to produce methyl-branched fatty acids. These branched
fatty acids have the low temperature properties of unsaturated fatty acids, but unlike unsaturated fatty acids,
their esters are not susceptible to oxidation and are
therefore ideally suited for use in lubricant formulations
[24] (WO 99/18217). Moreover, the methyl branched
fatty acids are an alternative to isostearic acids that are
used as cosmetics. Oils with high levels of cyclopropene
fatty acids self-polymerize at elevated temperatures

because the cyclopropene ring is highly strained and
readily opens in an exothermic reaction. This property
makes CPE particularly suitable for the productions of
coatings and polymers. Sterculic acid (18-carbon cyclopropene) also has potential applications as a biocide in
fatty acid soap formulation (US2008/0155714A1).
In this study, we identify three CPS isoforms from
cotton and analyze their expression in different tissues
to help define their physiological roles. We also present
an analysis of the consequences of over-expressing cotton GhCPS1, 2 and 3 in yeast, tobacco suspension cells
and Arabidopsis.

Methods
Plant growth conditions and transgenic analyses

Arabidopsis and camelina plants were grown in walk-ingrowth chambers at 22°C for 16 h photoperiod, and cotton
plants were grown in the greenhouse at 28°C for 16 h
photoperiod. The full length cDNA corresponding to
GhCPS1[GenBank:574036.1], GhCPS2 [GenBank:574037.1]
and GhCPS3[GenBank:574038.1] genes were PCR amplified using gene specific primers with restriction siteencoding linkers and subsequently digested and cloned
into pYES2 (Invitrogen) via corresponding SacI and
EcoRI restriction sites. For Arabidopsis and camelina
transformation, the genes were cloned downstream of the
phaseolin seed-specific promoter in binary vector pDsRed
[25]. These binary vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation and
were used to transform Arabidopsis via the floral dip
method [26], and camelina through vacuum infiltration
[27]. Seeds of transformed plants were screened under
fluorescence, emitted upon illumination with green light
from a X5 LED flashlight (Inova) in conjunction with a
25A red camera filter [25]. For tobacco Bright Yellow 2
(BY2) transformation, GhCPS1 was cloned into pBI121
using BamHI and SacI sites, and GhCPS2 and 3 were
cloned into pBI121 using the XbaI and SacI restriction
sites and transformed into BY2 cells. After 4-5 months
kanamycin selection, stable transformed cell lines were
collected 7 days after subculture and analyzed for fatty
acid composition. The composition of pBI121-containing
negative control lines were compared with lines transformed with SfCPS in pBI121.

Phylogenetic and sequence analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the cyclopropane fatty acid
synthase (CPS) family was conducted by using full
length protein sequences from cotton and cyclopropane
fatty acid synthase from Sterculia, E. coli, Agrobacterium, Mycobacterium, and Arabidopsis. Full-length
amino-acid sequences were first aligned by CLUSTALW
version 2.0.12 (Additional file 1) [28] with default parameters (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw/), and
imported into the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) package version 5.0 [29]. Phylogenetic and
molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [30] implemented in
MEGA, with the pair-wise deletion option for handling
alignment gaps, and the Poisson correction model for
computing distance. The final tree graphic was generated using TreeView program [31].

RNA extraction, Reverse transcription and quantitative
PCR analyses

RNA from cotton leaf, flower, stem and seeds at different development stages were extracted according to Wu
et al. [32] and RNA from cotton root was isolated using
Qiagen’s plant Mini RNA kit. RNA quality and concentration were determined by gel electrophoresis and
Nanodrop spectroscopy. Reverse transcription (RT) was
carried out using Qiagen’s QuanTect Reverse Transcription Kit. Quantitative PCR analyses were carried out
using Bio-RAD iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix as
described in Additional file [2]. Primers ubiq7-1F (5’GAAGGCATTCCACCTGACCAAC -3’) and Ubiq7-1R
(5’- CTTGACCTTCTTCTTCTTGTGCTTG -3’) were
used to amplify ubiquitin 7 as internal standard. Genespecific primers used for qRT-PCR analysis were
qGCPS-1F(5’- TTAAGTGGTCAACCGGCCATGCAA
-3’) and qGCPS-1R (5’-TTCTTTGGACTGGGCGGAACAGAA -3’), qGCPS2-1F (5’-ATATTCCCTGGAGG
AACC CTG CTT-3’) and qGCPS2-1R (5’-AAACCG
GCAGCGCAGTAATCGAAA-3’) for GhCPS2, and
qGCPS3-1F (5’-ACTGGTTGCGAGGTGCATTCTGTT3) and qGCPS3-1R (5’-TTGGAAAGCGCCAAGCACTGTTGA -3’) for GhCPS3.
Fatty acid analyses

Yeast culture, expression induction, and fatty acid analyses were carried out as described [33]. Lipids were
extracted in methanol/chloroform (2:1) from 0.1 g of
fresh weight cotton tissue and internal standard heptadecanoic acid was added. The isolated lipid was methylated in 1% sodium methoxide at 50°C for 1 hr and
extracted with hexane. To analyze the fatty acids of
single seeds, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were
prepared by incubating the seeds with 35 μL 0.2M trimethylsulfonium hydroxide in methanol [34]. For analysis of CFA in BY2 cell lines, FA were extracted from
~0.1 g of BY2 callus tissue, FAMEs were prepared as
described above for cotton tissue, or FA dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives were prepared in a one-pot
reaction in which FA are reacted with 2-amino-2methyl-1-propanol in a nitrogen atmosphere at 190°C
for 4 hours [35]. Lipid profiles and acyl group identification were analyzed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas
chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective
detector (GC/MS) and either Agilent J&W DB 23
capillary column (30 m × 0.25 μm × 0.25 μm) or
SUPELCO SP-2340 (60 m × 0.25 μm × 0.20 μm) column. The injector was held at 225°C and the oven
temperature was varied from 100-160°C at 25°C/min,
then 10°C/min to 240°C. The percentage values were
converted to mole percent and presented as means of
at least three replicates.

Results
The cotton cyclopropane fatty acid synthase family
consists of three highly conserved members

A database search of the cotton genome database
(http://cottondb.org/) identified three genes predicted to
encode proteins with high sequence similarity to Sterculia CPS (Figure 1). The predicted polypeptides encoded
by the cotton CPS isoforms range from 865 to 873
amino acids. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic
analysis of the different isozymes conducted using the
MEGA5 program revealed that the GhCPS1 and 2 isozymes are the most similar, showing 97% identity at the
amino acid level, and group in a clade with Sterculia
CPS. GhCPS1 and 2 showed 82% and 84% identity to
Sterculia CPS, respectively. The GhCPS3 protein showed
divergence from these 3 synthases, arising from a completely separate branch (Figure 1). Sequence comparisons showed GhCPS3 had 64% identity with GhCPS1
and 65% with GhCPS2.
The cotton CPSs have two enzymatic domains as
reported for the Sterculia CPS [8]; the carboxy terminus
encodes the CPS domain and catalyzes the synthesis of
dihydrosterculate while the amino terminus encodes a

Page 4 of 10

distinct oxidase domain of unknown function. A sequence
proposed to play a role in S-AdoMet binding, VL(E/D)
xGxGxG [36,37], was found in GhCPS3 as ILEIGCGWG
and in a more degenerate form (DxGxGxG) in GhCPS1
and 2. Given that S-AdoMet binding and methyl group
transfer is the only known function shared between CPS
and other S-AdoMet binding enzymes, this segment of the
GhCPSs seems very likely to be involved in binding this
substrate. It should be noted that all CPS coding
sequences lack the phenylalanine residue of the FxGxG,
proposed by both Lauster [38] and Smith et al. [39]. However, this motif has been found only in methyltransferases
that act on nucleic acids [37].
Active site conservation

The crystallized M. tuberculosis CPS structure shows a
bicarbonate ion hydrogen-bonded to five active-site residues [15], including two interactions via backbone amides.
In E.coli CPS C139, I268, E239, H266, and Y317 are
strictly conserved within all non-plant CPSs [16]. In cotton, the amino acids corresponding to E. Coli I268, E239,
and Y317 are conserved in all 3 GhCPS genes, i.e. I739,
E710, Y794 for GhCPS1; I731, E702, Y786 for GhCPS2
and I736, E707, Y791 for GhCPS3. However, H266 has
been substituted for Q in GhCPS (Q737, I729 and Q734
respectively). Interestingly, C139 remains the same in
GhCPS3 as C602, but is substituted for S in the other two
GhCPS (S602 in GhCPS1 and S595 in GhCPS2). An E.
coli C139S mutant is less active than the wild-type enzyme
(its catalytic efficiency is 31%), but addition of bicarbonate
increases its Kcat, by a factor of two [16].
The GhCPS genes exhibit tissue-specific differences in
their expression

constructed by neighbor-joining distance analysis. Line lengths
indicate the relative distances between nodes. Sequences of
characterized enzymes and CPS homologues from Arabidopsis and
cotton were used for alignment, pcaA, mycolic acid synthase from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv [NCBI Reference Sequence:
NC_000962.2]; cmaA1, Cyclopropane mycolic acid synthase 1 from
Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97 [NCBI Reference Sequence:
NC_002945.3]; AtCPs, cyclopropane synthase from Agrobacterium
tumefaciens (AGR-C-3601p); EcCPS, cyclopropane synthase from E.Coli
[NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000913]; cmaA2, Cyclopropane
mycolic acid synthase 2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [NCBI
Reference Sequence: NP_215017.1]; mmaA2, Cyclopropane mycolic
acid synthase MmaA2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [NCBI
Reference Sequence: NP_215158.1].

To provide clues as to possible physiological roles of the
three isozymes, their expression patterns in various tissues of cotton plants were examined. Quantitative
reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR analysis of RNA from
leaf, stem, root, flower and seeds at different development stages using gene-specific primers for the three
isoforms revealed that GhCPS1 and 2 are highly
expressed in root, stem, and flower. Both GhCPS1 and 2
showed low transcription levels in leaf and seeds at
early development stages, i.e., from 0 to 25 day post
anthesis (dpa) (Figure 2 A and B). In contrast, GhCPS3
showed highest transcription in leaf and flower but
reduced levels in root and stem (Figure 2, C). All three
GhCPS gene-transcript levels increased with seed development (Figure 2).
Expression of GhCPS1 and 2 correlates with cyclic fatty
acid accumulation levels

The FA profile of leaf, stem, root, flower and seeds at
different development stages were determined to

deviation.

evaluate how they differed in their fatty acid compositions (Table 1). In root, stem and flower tissues, cyclic
fatty acids made up about 19.2%, 9.9% and 4.0% of total
fatty acids, respectively. Of these fatty acids, malvalic acid
(7-(2-octyl-1-cyclopropenyl) heptanoic acid) was the
most abundant, accounting for 11.9%, 6.9% and 3.0% of
total fatty acids in root, stem and flower tissues, respectively. Cyclopropane and cyclopropene fatty acids were
present at less than 2% in cotton leaf and seed tissues.
With seed development, cyclic fatty acid increased

to1.5% at 40 dpa seeds from less than 1.0% in 0, 5, 10 and
25 dpa seeds, and decreased to 1.2% in 50 dpa seeds.
In cotton tissues the abundance of GhCPS1 and 2 transcripts in different tissues is in general agreement with the
cyclic fatty acid distribution, while GhCPS3 is expressed at
very low levels in the root and stem tissues which are rich
in the cyclic fatty acid. This suggests that GhCPS1 and 2
contribute to the CFA production in cotton. Cyclic fatty
acids are synthesized very early in seed development,
which was detected as early as 0 dpa in the ovule, and

Fatty acid composition from leaf, stem, root, flower and seeds at 0, 5, 10, 25, 40 and 50dpa were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results
are expressed as a percentage of the total seed fatty acids, and 18:1 is the sum of 18:1Δ9 and Δ11 isomers. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of

increased to peak at 40 dpa and then decreased a little at
50 dpa. This pattern is consistent with the expression pattern of GhCPS1, 2 and 3, but we cannot rule out GhCPS3
involvement in CFA production in the seed.
Expression of GhCPS1 and 2 in yeast demonstrates their
physiological activity

To test whether the identified GhCPSs have enzymatic
activity, the 3 genes were cloned into pYES2 vector and
transformed into host strain YPH499. In addition to the
authentic GhCPS2 sequence, a mutant, GhCPS2 I733T
was identified and since the mutant point I733T is only
one amino acid from the biocarbonate ion binding site,
we decided to include it in our analysis. As shown in Figure 3, the fatty acid composition of yeast expressing
GhCPS1 shows the production of two extra fatty acids
relative to the control, the 17:0 CFA and 19:0 CFA. 17:0
CFA is identified by its mass ion from GC/MS. As shown
in Figure 4, the GhCPS1 overexpression strain converted
16:1 FA to 2.96% of 17CFA and 18:1 FA into 2.32% of
19CFA, i.e., yielding a total of 5.28% CFA accumulation.
The expression of GhCPS1 resulted in almost twice the
CFA accumulation reported for the expression of the
CPS from Sterculia [8]; SfCPS produced 2.36% of 17CFA
and 0.82% of 19CFA, i.e., 3.18% total CFA. Expression of
GhCPS2 resulted in only 0.36% CFA accumulation, while
the expression of GhCPS3 didn’t result in detectable
levels of CFAs. Interestingly, the fortuitously obtained
GhCPS2 I733T mutant resulted in the accumulation of
2.50% 17C and 19C cyclopropane, i.e., approximately 10fold that of the WT GhCPS2. These results demonstrate
that GhCPS 1 and 2 are indeed active CPSs that can act
on both 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acid substrates to produce
both 17C and 19C cyclopropane fatty acids.
Deletion of the N-terminal oxidase domain decreases CPS
activity

Compared to bacterial CPS, GhCPS contain a ~400amino acids-long N-terminal extension, homologous to
oxidases that possesses an FAD-binding motif. In order

to deduce the function of the oxidase domain of cotton
CPS, different lengths of the N-terminal extension were
deleted and the resulting constructs were expressed in
yeast. After a 2-days of induction, a full length GhCPS1
yielded 2.94% 17CFA and 2.36% 19CFA, totaling 5.30%
CFA. When the entire oxidase portion (409 aa) was
deleted, the GhCPS1 still retained about 30% of the activity demonstrating that the oxidase activity is not necessary for CPS activity, but that it enhances CPS activity by
an as yet unknown mechanism. Surprisingly, deletion of
part of the oxidase domain, reduced CFA accumulation
more than a total deletion (Figure 5), possibly by making
the mRNA unstable or by incorrect folding of the protein, destabilizing it. Further deletion beyond the oxidase
domain, i.e., into the N-terminal portion of the CPS
domain, resulted in additional decreases in activity, with
only 1.21% CFA accumulating upon deletion of 426 aa
and 0.84% CFA upon deletion of 433 aa.
Co-expression of the Agrobacterium oxidase with the E.
Coli CPS resulted in lower CFA accumulation in yeast
compared to expression of the CPS alone. A similar
decrease was found when the Agrobacterium oxidase was
fused with E. Coli CPS protein. Fusion of a plant CPS Nterminal oxidase to E.Coli CPS also inhibited its ability to
produce CFA (data not shown). These results demonstrate that unlike the cotton CPSs, E.Coli CPS activity is
not enhanced by the oxidase domain. We cloned the
Agrobacterium, gene AGR-C-3599p (N-terminal homolog to plant CPS) and AGR-C-3601p (C-terminal homolog to plant CPS) that was located 802 bp upstream of
AGR-C-3599p. We also failed to detect any CFA from
the ACPS over expression in yeast, and neither coexpression of these two proteins in yeast nor the fusion
of these two polypeptides into a single polypeptide
yielded any cyclopropane fatty acids (data not shown).

Figure 3 GC analysis of FAMEs extracted from yeast expressing cotton CPS GhCPS 1. After a 2-day induction with galactose (A) YES2; (B)
YES2 spiked with DHSA and GhCPS1 which produced both 17:0 CFA and 19:0 CFA

yielding about 1.0% of 19C cyclopropane. No significant
accumulation of cyclopropane products was detected in
GhCPS2 and 3 over expression lines (Figure 6). Consistent with the GhCPS expression in yeast, a trace amount
of cyclopropane was detected upon the expression of the
SfCPS and GhCPS2 I733T mutant. Expression of CPSs
in Arabidopsis seeds didn’t lead to significant changes in
other fatty acid composition and the oil content (data
not shown).
When these genes were expressed in BY2 cell lines,
~1.0% of 19C cyclopropane was produced in GhCPS1
lines and SfCPS lines, and only a trace amount of CFA
was detected in GhCPS2 transformed BY2 lines. No

cyclopropane fatty acid was detected in lines transformed with GhCPS3, the chromatograms of which
were indistinguishable from control pBI121-containing
lines. In one of the 16 GhCPS2 I733T lines, 2.9% of
CFA was detected.
These results demonstrate that GhCPS1 and 2 can
cause the accumulation of CPA FA upon heterologous
expression in plants.

Discussion
Blast searching of the cotton genome database using the
Sterculia CPS gene resulted in the identification of three
cotton CPS homologous genes (GhCPS1, 2, 3). GhCPS1

yeast. FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS, both 17:0 CFA and 19:0
CFA were calculated as a percentage of the total fatty acids. The
values represent the mean and standard deviation of three
replicates.

and 2 show high similarities to the published SfCPS
gene and their expression patterns correlate closely with
CFA distributions in a variety of tissues. In addition, we
confirmed their biochemical identity as cyclopropane
synthases in yeast and plant.
Interestingly, GhCPS3’s transcription level is relatively
low in roots and stems where higher abundance of CFA
is found. In addition, when heterologously expressed
GhCPS3 did not result in detectable CFA accumulation
in yeast, tobacco BY2 cell lines, or in Arabidopsis seeds.
A number of plant sequences are related to GhCPS3;

Figure 5 Effect of N-terminal deletions on the CPS activity of
GhCPS1. Different portions of the N-terminal domain ranging from
21aa to 433 aa were deleted from GhCPS1, and their effects on CFA
production analyzed. Both 17:0 and 19:0 CFAs were calculated as a
percentage of the total fatty acids. The values represent the mean
and standard deviation of three replicates.

Figure 6 Cyclopropane fatty acid production upon the
expression of CPS in fad2/fae1 plants. FAMEs were analyzed by
GC/MS, cyclopropane fatty acid expressed as a percentage of the
total fatty acids. The values represent the mean and standard
deviation of three lines.

for instance, in Arabidopsis, 5 genes clustered in the
same clade with GhCPS3 (Fig 1) and are more closely
related to GhCPS3 than to SfCPS or to GhCPS 1 and 2.
CPA and CPE have not been reported in Arabidopsis so
far consistent with our analysis of Arabidopsis seeds and
leaves in which we failed to identify any cyclopropane
or cyclopropene fatty acids (data not shown). Since
GhCPS3 and its Arabidopsis homologues are mainly
expressed in leaf, it is possible that they catalyze the formation of other cyclopropanated products [9].
The role of the N-terminal oxidase portion of the
plant-type CPS gene remains to be determined. From an
evolutionary point of view, it is interesting to speculate
on the origin of the cyclopropane synthases that contain
the oxidase domain at the N-terminus. The oxidase
gene and CPS gene are located adjacent to one another
in the genomes of Agrobacterium and Mycobacteria; in
plants the genes are fused to form a single product;
taken together this suggests that the N-terminal domain
in plants and its homologs in bacteria may play a role(s)
related to cyclopropanation [9]. There is a conserved
FAD-binding motif in the first 21 aa of the plant oxidase
domain. It is hard to envisage how a redox system such
as a FAD-containing protein could be involved in the
catalytic reaction of methylene addition. After removal
of the oxidase portion, the C-terminal CPS portion of
GhCPS1 still retains 30% of its activity, showing that the
oxidase activity is not necessary for function but that an
intact oxidase domain somehow enhances activity perhaps by conferring stability to the CPS polypeptide. Cotton CPS antibodies would be helpful in distinguishing
whether the reduction of activity upon partial, or complete deletion, of the oxidase domain results from destabilization of the enzyme or from loss of catalytic

Yu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:97
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/97

activity. It is possible that the oxidase portion plays a
potential role in either the desaturation of dihydrosterculic acid to produce sterculic acid or the a-oxidation
of the product to form malvalic acid.
Malvalic acid is a predominant CPE in cotton. No
chain-shortened CPA was found when GhCPSs are
expressed in yeast, tobacco BY2 cell lines, or fad2/fae1
Arabidopsis seeds. The data also show that the presence
of CPA was insufficient to induce a-oxidation in these
systems. Since neither CPE nor a-oxidation products
were observed, we conclude that additional gene products are required for these functions.
A variety of bacteria initiate the cyclopropanation of
fatty acids in the stationary phase or upon exposure to
low pH [6,40,41], osmotic stress [42,43] and high temperature [44]. The conversion of unsaturated fatty acids
into the corresponding CFAs reduces the levels of unsaturated fatty acids in membranes and therefore contributes to a reduction of the membrane fluidity which
renders lipid bilayers more rigid [45]. Cyclization of
fatty acid acyl chains is therefore generally regarded as a
means to reduce membrane fluidity to adapt the cells
for adverse conditions [6]. The content of cyclopropane
fatty acids with 25 carbon atoms is correlated with early
growth in spring for Galanthus nivalis L. and Anthriscus
silvestris L. [46]. Lipids esterified with long chain cyclopropane fatty acids could contribute to the physiological
adaptations of early spring plants and drought-tolerant
plants by reducing membrane permeability to solvent
[46].
CPE inhibited fatty acid desaturation in two fungi of
interest to plant pathologists and CPE from Sterculia
foetida affected U. maydis, the basidiomycete responsible for corn smut growth and morphology, suggesting
that CPE serves as antifungal agent [47]. Study of gene
expression changes in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum-infected cotton seedlings identified GhCPS2 (i.e.,
CD486555) as having increased expression in cotton
roots at 3 days post-infection, together with a bacterially
induced lipoxygenase. This makes GhCPS2 one of the
few potential defense-related genes induced in infected
roots and putative stress-related genes encoding proteins
such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) 18 and nitropropane dioxygenase [48].

Conclusions
We have shown that both GhCPS1 and 2 contribute to
CFA accumulation in cotton seeds; but GhCPS1
accounts for the majority of CFA accumulation in roots
and stems. The information presented herein has potential uses for two distinct biotechnological applications. It
is highly desirable to target both GhCPS1 and 2 for suppression to reduce the CPE content of cottonseed meal
for use as animal feed. Conversely, to facilitate CPA

accumulation for use as oleochemical feedstocks, our
data suggests GhCPS1 to be the best choice for heterologous expression in a production plant.
