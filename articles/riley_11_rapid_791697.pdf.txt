Rapid whole genome optical mapping of
Plasmodium falciparum

Abstract
Background: Immune evasion and drug resistance in malaria have been linked to chromosomal recombination
and gene copy number variation (CNV). These events are ideally studied using comparative genomic analyses;
however in malaria these analyses are not as common or thorough as in other infectious diseases, partly due to
the difficulty in sequencing and assembling complete genome drafts. Recently, whole genome optical mapping
has gained wide use in support of genomic sequence assembly and comparison. Here, a rapid technique for
producing whole genome optical maps of Plasmodium falciparum is described and the results of mapping four
genomes are presented.
Methods: Four laboratory strains of P. falciparum were analysed using the Argus™ optical mapping system to
produce ordered restriction fragment maps of all 14 chromosomes in each genome. Plasmodium falciparum DNA
was isolated directly from blood culture, visualized using the Argus™ system and assembled in a manner
analogous to next generation sequence assembly into maps (AssemblyViewer™, OpGen Inc.®). Full coverage maps
were generated for P. falciparum strains 3D7, FVO, D6 and C235. A reference P. falciparum in silico map was created
by the digestion of the genomic sequence of P. falciparum with the restriction enzyme AflII, for comparisons to
genomic optical maps. Maps were then compared using the MapSolver™ software.
Results: Genomic variation was observed among the mapped strains, as well as between the map of the reference
strain and the map derived from the putative sequence of that same strain. Duplications, deletions, insertions,
inversions and misassemblies of sizes ranging from 3,500 base pairs up to 78,000 base pairs were observed. Many
genomic events occurred in areas of known repetitive sequence or high copy number genes, including var gene
clusters and rifin complexes.
Conclusions: This technique for optical mapping of multiple malaria genomes allows for whole genome
comparison of multiple strains and can assist in identifying genetic variation and sequence contig assembly. New
protocols and technology allowed us to produce high quality contigs spanning four P. falciparum genomes in six
weeks for less than $1,000.00 per genome. This relatively low cost and quick turnaround makes the technique
valuable compared to other genomic sequencing technologies for studying genetic variation in malaria.

Background
Malaria is caused by various species of the genus Plasmodium, the most prevalent and deadly of which is
Plasmodium falciparum[1,2]. With ~40% of the world’s
population at risk for malaria, efforts in prevention, eradication and treatment of the disease are globally vital
[2,3]. Despite efforts to develop vaccines and drugs to
combat malaria, vaccine escape and drug resistance

continue to be a problem [1,4,5]. The ability to compare
whole genomes could assist in these efforts, as genetic
variation and recombination have been shown to facilitate antigen diversity, immune escape and evolution of
anti-malarial drug resistance [4,6-9]. Proposed mechanisms for these events include chromosome translocation
and recombination, segmental duplication and CNV
[10-13]. Ideally, fully sequenced and assembled genomes
would be a way to study these mechanisms; however,
this continues to be expensive and labour intensive
[12-14]. Optical mapping provides an alternative to
study these events, but to date has not been used for

this purpose in malaria, partly due to the impracticality
of scaling up previous mapping techniques to multiple
genomes [15].
Optical mapping is a technique during which visualization of high molecular weight DNA cut by restriction
enzymes is used to create a scaffold fragment pattern
across a genome (Figure 1). The first and most critical
step in this process is the purification of extremely high
molecular weight DNA (150Kb-1.6Mb). This was
accomplished in this case by using magnetic bead technology. The DNA is then bound to a glass surface and
subjected to a pre-determined restriction enzyme and
labelled using a fluorescent dye. These digested, bound
molecules are then imaged and relative sizes are

assigned to generate a cut site pattern. These patterns
are used to assemble the molecules against each other,
generating a digital representation of fragment pattern
alignments, or an “optical map”[16].
The 14 chromosome, 14 Mbp P. falciparum strain 3D7
genome was published in 2002, and to date this is the only
complete, assembled genome sequence for this organism
[14]. Optical mapping of DNA was used to assist in assembly of this published genome sequence, but until now has
not been widely used on any other species or strains
[15,17]. The Argus™ optical mapping system represents a
radical advancement in whole genome optical mapping
technology, and is being widely used for studies in bacterial identification, evolution, comparative genomics and

genome assembly [18-22]. By developing new parasite isolation techniques and DNA extraction protocols, stated
Argus™ limitations were surpassed to produce whole genome maps of malaria genomes for under $1,000.00 each,
fully assembled in less than one week.

Results
Parasite isolation and DNA extraction

Two vaccine research P. falciparum strains and two drug
resistance research strains were selected for this work.
Strains 3D7 and FVO are commonly used in vaccine
development and 3D7 allowed the direct comparison of its
optical map and the sequence based in silico map which
was used as a reference [14]. Strains D6 (NC_004317) and
C235 were selected based on their opposing anti-malarial
drug resistance profiles; D6 is generally considered drug
sensitive with minor mefloquine resistance, while C235 is
considered a multi-drug resistant strain [Unpublished
Data]. All four parasites are culture-adapted strains and
were grown to 4-6% parasitaemia in 6 mL standard blood
culture prior to purification. Isolation of late ring- early
schizont-stage parasites was performed by multiple 4°C
wash/centrifuge cycles after initial lysis with 0.1% saponin
in PBS. The blood culture was centrifuged at 2,486 rpm
(860 rcf) and 4°C for 6 minutes and the pellet resuspended
in one-half starting volume of ice cold 0.1% saponin/PBS
(w/v). This solution was allowed to incubate on ice for 10
minutes and then centrifuged again at 2,486 rpm (860 rcf)
and 4°C for 6 minutes. After removal of supernatant, the
pellet was resuspended in ice cold DNAse free water and
centrifuged again at 2,486 rpm (860 rcf) and 4°C for 6
minutes. This protocol resulted in release of malaria parasites and elimination of RBCs (Figure 2). This pellet was
resuspended in 50 μL of ice cold DNAse free water and
used directly in DNA extraction.
DNA extraction was performed on this purified parasite
sample according to the Gram-negative Bacterial DNA
Preparation protocol available from Opgen, Inc.®. The
parasites were lysed and resulting DNA was mixed with
magnetic beads, subjected to a variety of wash buffers and
eluted off the beads using wide bore pipette tips. Modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol included addition of a
20 minute extension of initial lysis time, reduction in elution volume from 90 μL to 75 μL, and an extra two elutions at 65°C for 15 minutes each. Between 4 μL and 6 μL
DNA was applied to mapcards (cards run on the Argus™)
and run on the Argus™ system per manufacturer’s specifications, after proper quality controls checks and appropriate dilutions using Opgen® QCards.
Mapset filter and contig assembly

Contig assembly was performed using the Argus™ software, but with changes to default settings. The mapset

Page 3 of 8

(total dataset generated from a single run) was filtered
for minimum molecule (chromosome segment imaged)
size (> 150 Kb), minimum fragments per molecule (>12)
and minimum molecule quality (>0.4). Each genome was
able to be assembled on as few as two mapcards; however, in some cases more cards were used in an attempt
to resolve difficult telomeric chromosome ends. The data
from each additional run on the same strain were combined together for final assembly. Assembly was conducted using either the “fastest” setting or “slower”
setting, with removal of default circularization parameters. Partial assembly results were saved when 14 contigs became apparent by having >50 molecules each.
Contigs were split off and reassembled against the original mapset individually using the “Find Hits” feature.
Contigs were considered “finished” when no additional
molecules were added by subsequent reassemblies. The
only areas that did not pass default Argus™ quality control (QC) settings were telomeric repeats near some
chromosome ends. Chromosome ends that were not
blunt were visually inspected and any questionable molecule was removed from the final map. Finished contigs
were imported and aligned using Opgen® MapSolver™
software with default alignment settings (Figure 3).
Genome alignment and comparative genomics

Each genome was aligned against the 3D7 reference
genome and genomic differences were noted and compared against the other strains (Table 1). Relative to the
3D7 reference DNA sequence, the 3D7 optical map
showed two probable misassemblies, one gene duplication and two insertion/deletion events. Overall, this
accounts for ~304 Kb of unaligned sequence. The
multi-drug resistant strain C235 shows a ~70 Kb insertion that is of particular interest as it is the largest
observed difference and is completely unique to this
genome (Figure 4).
Each genomic event was aligned to the reference
sequence from PlasmoDB [23], and the DNA sequence
for the insertion (or flanking DNA for deletions) was
referenced to associated genes. In many cases var or rifin
complexes were associated with these events, in particular PfEMP1, a known source of antigenic variation [24].
One identified var cluster of known variation on chromosome 4 is shown in Figure 5 in the four genomes mapped
aligned to the reference genome.

Discussion
The major hurdle to optically mapping P. falciparum
was sample preparation. Because the parasites can be
grown only in blood culture, there is a possibility of
contamination of the sample by human white blood
cells or nucleated erythrocytes. As there is no

amplification involved in this technique, even a single
human cell (3,300 Mb DNA/cell) could overwhelm the
sample with human DNA and mask the comparatively
small 24 Mb/cell malaria genome. This was overcome

using the parasite isolation technique described in the
methods. The success of this method was such that no
contigs in the assemblies failed to match a region of the
sequenced Plasmodium genome.

Some chromosome ends did not readily align to the
reference strain. These unaligned map ends often had
poor QC scores and low coverage. Using AflII as a mapping enzyme would result in multiple small AflII fragments at the end containing telomeric repeats which
would be not resolved. Thus, while there may be more
DNA at the ends of some chromosomes than is represented in our optical maps, the DNA and related cut
site patterns internal to these ends are correct. Blunt
ends were observed at some contig ends and passed QC
indicating that we resolved the full length of the chromosome (Figure 6).
Complete chromosome end translocations were
observed in C235 and FVO, indicating this could be a frequently observed difference between distantly related
strains. A single region on chromosome 4 varied significantly in length (up to 65Kb) among the strains studied.
It includes a known var gene cluster in the reference
genome (Figure 7) [6]. The var clusters (which contain
variants of PfEMP1) are known to be associated with
antigenic variation and are thought to be a candidate for
vaccine development [6,9,24]. In the 3D7 optical map, an
exact duplication of PfEMP1 was observed in comparison
to other strains and the reference genome (Figure 8).
PfEMP1 is a known source of antigenic variation, and
while segmental duplication has been implicated as a
possible mechanism, until now it has not been directly
observed [24]. Strain C235 is considered multi-drug
resistant and thus any unique genomic events compared
to susceptible strains are of particular interest [Unpublished Data]. While there were several non-unique insertions and deletions compared to the reference genome,
we did observe a single 70Kb insertion on C235 chromosome 10 that does not have a similar pattern in any of
the other genomes mapped (Figure 4). This insert seems
to be a 35Kb segment of DNA that was duplicated back
to back, which is potentially meaningful as drug resistance is often associated with gene duplication and CNV
[4]. Using Mapsolver™ UPGMA phylogenetic trees for
individual chromosomes, 3D7 was found to be most
similar to D6 (9/14 chromosomes), while C235 and FVO
were most closely related (9/14 chromosomes). These
relationships most likely reflect the geographic regions
that each parasite is from (Table 1).

Figure 6 Optical Resolution of Blunt Chromosome Ends; Unlike
bacterial optical maps, malaria DNA is not circular. Telomeric
repeats near the ends of some chromosomes can cause the map to
be truncated, unless a “blunt” end is observed as shown in this
figure. “Blunt” ends in optical mapping refer not to enzyme cut sites
but the true end of a chromosome as depicted by having all
individual molecules “end” at the same sequence.

Conclusions
Optical genomic mapping technology represents a significant advancement in comparative genomic research of
malaria parasites. The optical maps of the four P. falciparum strains presented here demonstrate significant genome variation, much of which can be traced to regions
known to contain coding sequence implicated in antigenic
variation. This confirms findings generated via more difficult and expensive research methods that have suggested

chromosomal translocations and segmental duplications
are associated with immune escape and drug resistance in
malaria [6-8,10,11]. Optical mapping resolves these types
of genomic events and the techniques described in this
paper allow for inexpensive, rapid, robust production of
whole genome optical maps for malaria. This method also
opens the door for assistance with genome assembly, as
has been demonstrated with optical mapping of other
