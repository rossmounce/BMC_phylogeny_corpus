metapneumovirus (hMPV) in Cambodia

Background
First identified in 2001, human metapneumovirus
(hMPV) is a novel pathogen and causative agent of
acute respiratory tract infection. Re-infection with
hMPV is common, and currently there is no available
vaccine against this virus. Two genetic subgroups
(A and B) have been identified, both of which can be
divided further into at least two distinct sub-lineages.
Here we report the results of the genetic variability of
hMPV strains circulating within Cambodia.
Methods
A total of 3858 samples were collected, between 20072009, from hospitalized patients presenting with acute
lower respiratory illness in the regional hospitals of
Takeo and Kampong Cham, under the guidelines of the
SISEA (Surveillance and Investigation of Epidemic Situations in Southeast Asia) project. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 18 respiratory viruses using
multiplex PCR/RT-PCR at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. To investigate the genetic heterogeneity of hMPV
strains in Cambodia, regions within the highly variable
G gene, and highly conserved F gene of 65 strains were
amplified. Neighbour-Joining trees were constructed
using Mega 4.0 software.
Results
Most of hMPV cases occurred in 2008 (89%) with a
peak in August (32%). Only a very low number of
hMPV positive samples were detected in November and
December 2007 and in 2009. Partial F gene sequences
were obtained from 48 samples, collected from patients
between 3 months and 58 years of age. Phylogenetic

analysis revealed the co-circulation of B2 (91%) and
A2 (9%) genotypes. Genotypes A1 and B1 were not
detected. Twenty eight partial G gene sequences were
generated. Phylogenetic analysis results were consistent
between the F and G genes. We observed more than
10% diversity at the nucleotide level between G gene
sequences clustering within the B2 genotype.

Conclusion
This is the first study to investigate the molecular epidemiology of hMPV in Cambodia, and the first study to
report a predominance of circulating genotype B2
strains in Southeast Asia. Our findings contribute to
those of recent studies, demonstrating the high variability of the global distribution of hMPV genotypes. This
emphasizes the need for ongoing genetic characterization of circulating strains to aid generation of an effective vaccine.
