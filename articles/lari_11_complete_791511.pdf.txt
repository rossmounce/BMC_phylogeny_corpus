Abstract
Background: Bos primigenius, the aurochs, is the wild ancestor of modern cattle breeds and was formerly
widespread across Eurasia and northern Africa. After a progressive decline, the species became extinct in 1627. The
origin of modern taurine breeds in Europe is debated. Archaeological and early genetic evidence point to a single
Near Eastern origin and a subsequent spread during the diffusion of herding and farming. More recent genetic
data are instead compatible with local domestication events or at least some level of local introgression from the
aurochs. Here we present the analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a pre-Neolithic Italian aurochs.
Results: In this study, we applied a combined strategy employing both multiplex PCR amplifications and 454
pyrosequencing technology to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of an 11,450-year-old aurochs
specimen from Central Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of the aurochs mtDNA genome supports the conclusions from
previous studies of short mtDNA fragments - namely that Italian aurochsen were genetically very similar to modern
cattle breeds, but highly divergent from the North-Central European aurochsen.
Conclusions: Complete mitochondrial genome sequences are now available for several modern cattle and two
pre-Neolithic mtDNA genomes from very different geographic areas. These data suggest that previously identified
sub-groups within the widespread modern cattle mitochondrial T clade are polyphyletic, and they support the
hypothesis that modern European breeds have multiple geographic origins.

Background
Genomic analyses of ancient samples are limited principally by DNA preservation. Standard ancient DNA methods that consist of amplification, followed by cloning and
sequencing of multiple clones, have been used to obtain
mitochondrial genomes from the bones of mammoths and
other permafrost-embedded animals, where up to 400-500
base pair DNA fragments can be retrieved [1-4]. However,
these methods are not as useful for less well-preserved
samples [5] where the preference is for different
approaches based on the development of metagenomic
libraries or direct large-scale genome sequencing through
Next Generation massively-parallel sequencing. For example, the mitochondrial genome and several million base

pairs of nuclear DNA from Neanderthal bone fragments
were sequenced with a Next Generation approach [6-8]
and 80% of the diploid genome from an extinct PaleoEskimo was recovered with a similar procedure [9]. These
powerful technologies are extremely well suited for the
analysis of bulk genomic DNA extracted from ancient
remains [6,10,11] but their use for characterization of the
mitochondrial genome is less effective outside of mtDNAenriched tissues such as hair shafts [12-15]. Recently,
selective target enrichment prior to Next Generation
ultra-deep sequencing has also been shown to be an
appropriate method for the characterization of mitochondrial genomes from ancient tissues [16-20].
In this study, we applied a combined strategy that
made use of multiplex PCR amplifications and 454 pyrosequencing technology to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of a Bos primigenius sample
excavated from Vado all’Arancio rockshelter in Central

Italy (see inset in Figure 1), dated by associated remains
at around 11,450-years. Bos primigenius, the aurochs, is
the wild ancestor of modern cattle breeds and was formerly widespread across Eurasia and northern Africa.
After a progressive decline thought to be due to overhunting and habitat contraction, the species became
extinct in 1627. The history of cattle domestication and
the degree of genetic contribution of local aurochsen to
modern taurine breeds in Europe is still a matter of
debate [21-30]. While previous studies have utilised
both modern and ancient DNA sequences, the ancient
data consisted almost exclusively of short fragments of
the mitochondrial control region. These studies suggested that all Northern and Central European aurochsen and a small fraction of Italian aurochsen had
control region sequences belonging to haplogroup P
[29], whereas the typical Italian aurochsen belonged to
haplogroup T [24,29]. Modern taurine cattle also possess haplogroup T, with the exception of a handful of
individuals who have sequences attributed to the aurochs haplogroup P, or the putative aurochs haplogroups
R and Q (Figure 1). Recently, the first aurochs mtDNA
genome was typed from a 6,700-year-old bone sample
located in England [30], and this sequence was found to

Page 2 of 10

belong to haplogroup P, consistent with the results from
the short control region sequences. The present study
reports the first pre-Neolithic aurochs mitochondrial
genome typed from Southern Europe, and confirms the
view that the aurochs was genetically structured in
Europe, with different local populations having different
genetic relationships with the modern cattle.

Results and Discussion
The Bos primigenius mtDNA genome

The combined multiplex PCR and 454 sequencing procedure generated more than 85,000 total reads from
the Vado all’Arancio aurochs phalanx bone. Approximately 66% of the reads were mapped to the bovine
reference mtDNA sequence (BRS) [31]. After excluding
false insertions and deletions commonly introduced by
the 454 sequencing technology at homopolymeric
strings, a total of 7,565,547 bases (Table S1, Additional
File 1) were used to assemble a preliminary consensus
sequence. The frequency distribution of the number of
reads per nucleotide (Figure S1a, Additional File 2) is
irregular, due to the overlap of fragments and because
specific fragments were pyrosequenced more than
once. The mean and median number of reads per

nucleotide were 463 and 93 respectively. Overall, the
number of reads for each specific fragment analysed
with the 454 approach was between one and two
orders of magnitude higher than the number of clones
commonly sequenced using traditional aDNA
approaches. At each site, the most frequent nucleotide
was observed in 99.4% of the reads on average (Figure
S1b, Additional File 2).
Among the 4113 sites where amplicons overlap, we
analysed if different error patterns were observed at
sites which are either monomorphic or polymorphic in
modern breeds, or at homologous sites typed in different amplicons. Different patterns are expected in case
of contamination with modern DNA. Very similar
allele frequencies spectra were observed considering
separately monomorphic and polymorphic sites in
modern breeds, and only 6 out of 176 sites which are
polymorphic in the cattle had a rare allele at a frequency > 2% among the reads (and never larger than
10%). In addition, the frequency of nucleotide misincorporation among reads shows a pattern typical of
ancient templates, with an excess of type II over type I
transitions (ratio typeII/typeI = 1.58; see Table S2,
Additional File 3).
The Vado all’Arancio aurochs sequence showed eight
indels and nine mutations compared to the Bos taurus
reference sequence [31]. However we noted that all but
one of the indels involved an insertion/deletion of the
last base in a homopolymeric string of > 5 bases, which
is likely to result from an artefact of the 454 pyrosequencing technology [32]. In two other positions, C- >
T substitutions were present in only 54% and 58%
respectively of the total reads, a strong signal of nucleotide misincorporations due to degradation of the original
templates rather than real substitutions. For this reason
we carefully checked these ambiguous positions by singleplex PCRs, cloning and Sanger sequencing (Figure S2,
Additional File 4) before assembling the definitive consensus sequence for the specimen of 16,339 bp.
The consensus Vado all’Arancio aurochs sequence
differed from the Bos taurus reference sequence (BRS)
at just four transitions, three transversions and one
insertion, all located in the mtDNA coding region
(Table 1). The positions were confirmed independently
in three different aDNA labs (Table S3, Additional File
5 and Figure S3, Additional File 6), according to standard practice. When compared to 134 complete
mtDNA sequences from different cattle breeds [27,28],
only three of these positions (12744, 14159, 15384)
correspond to fixed differences. On average, the Vado
all’Arancio aurochs mtDNA genome differs from modern domestic cattle at 15.2 sites (range: 5 - 86), a
value similar to the average distance between two
modern domestic cows (16.6 sites, range: 0 - 97). 73

differences were observed between our sample and the
complete genome of the 6,700-year-old English sample
[30]. Substitutions are distributed in the non-coding
control region (30.14%), rRNA and tRNA genes
(16.44%) and in 11 protein genes (53.42%) (Table S4,
Additional File 7).
Phylogenetic analysis

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the European cattle
and aurochs mtDNA coding genomes revealed that a
model allowing for polytomies is strongly supported
over a strict bifurcating model (Bayes Factor > 100).
Therefore, the pattern of previously classified bovid
clades and sub-clades is not supported, suggesting that
recurrent mutations and short internal branches may
limit meaningful evolutionary information. Overall, the
structure of the Bayesian consensus tree (Figure 2) is
similar to the tree reported in [27] and [33], but only
the major clades (R, P, Q, and T) and two subclades (T2
and T5) are monophyletic. This result is supported by
analysis of the mtDNA control region [33] (this study,
results not reported). This suggests that the previously
identified T1, T3 and T4 clades do not correspond to
robust evolutionary clades, and suggests that evolutionary inferences in cattle and aurochs based on mtDNA
sub-clades frequencies should be avoided.
The Vado all’Arancio aurochs mtDNA genome clearly
belongs to the major clade T, and is embedded within
the European cattle mitochondrial genealogy in contrast
to the British aurochs specimen [30], as previously suggested [24,29]. Polymorphisms within the control region
sequence of the Vado all’Arancio specimen had
previously led to it being assigned to the T3 subhaplogroup [24]. However, our statistical analysis of
complete genome sequences indicates that T3 is not
monophyletic and is therefore not a useful designation
for inferring evolutionary processes. In addition, the
Vado all’Arancio sequence does not cluster with any of
the cattle sequences previously assigned to the T3 subhaplogroup (see Figure 2).

Demography, domestication and clades dating

A Bayesian skyline analysis was performed with BEAST
[34] to estimate the demographic history of Italian cattle. 44 modern mtDNA genomes from previous studies
[27,28] were used for this analysis. We selected this geographically homogenous subset of mtDNA genomes to
reduce possible biases due to population structure. As
expected from previous studies of the mtDNA control
region in European cattle [33], a strong signal of rapid
demographic expansion was inferred (Bayes Factor > 20
when compared to a constant size model) (Figure 3).
The estimated starting date of this expansion varies
between about 7,000 and about 35,000 years BP depending on the calibration date used for the divergence time
between B. taurus and B. bison. In fact, at least three
dates have been proposed for this split: 1 MYA [35], 2
MYA [27] and 5 MYA [36]. The rapid increase in population size inferred by the Bayesian skyline analysis also
points to a very small effective size prior to the expansion, which is compatible with the long-term population
size estimated for several modern cattle breeds [37].
It seems therefore that the inferred demographic
expansion corresponds to the rapid increase of cattle
numbers occurred less than 10,000 years ago during the
Neolithic domestication process, considering also that
no evidence of expansion was found when pre-domestication specimens were analysed [29]. If correct, this

Sequences belonging to cluster T are not collapsed in order to
show sub groupings, and the traditional haplogroup nomenclature
is shown on the right. Clades R, P, Q and T are monophyletic, but
only subclades T2 and T5 are supported as definable groups
amongst the previously recognized T subclades. The disparate
phylogenetic positions of the Italian and the British aurochsen are
indicated. All other tips refer to modern cattle genomes.

would suggest that the most likely divergence time
between B. taurus and B. bison is older than 1 MYA but
much younger than 2 MYA.
We used the 1 MYA calibration date to estimate the
age of several monophyletic mtDNA haplogroups in the
reconstructed phylogeny (see Table 2), although it is
important to note that these dates are only rarely related
to population events (see for example, [38]). The
TMRCA (time to the most recent common ancestor) in
this species is slightly younger than 100 thousand years,
while the origin of the most frequent clade observed in
domestic European breeds (haplogroup T) clearly predates the Neolithic revolution. This result is compatible
with our finding that a pre-Neolithic aurochs also had a
T sequence. For comparison, the TMRCA ages for the
same clades were calculated with a 2 MY calibration
point, and compared with results from [28], where the
2MY calibration point and simpler statistical methods
(based either on a fixed topology or on the pairwise estimator Rho) were used. As expected from theoretical
arguments [39], we found that these simple methods
tend to underestimate the clade ages.
Finally, we investigated the effect of adding the Italian
aurochs genome on the TMRCA estimates for mtDNA
clades, by reanalyzing the data with and without the
aurochs sequence. The aim of this analysis is to understand how the addition of this single ancient sequence
influences the estimates of the timing of the origin of
each clade in the genealogy. We assumed genealogical
continuity between ancient and modern samples and
applied the single population flexible coalescent model
(Bayesian skyline) implemented in BEAST. Under this
model, ancient DNA sequences from specimens with
known age can be appropriately included in the data set,
and given the phylogenetic position of the aurochs genome (Figure 2) this analysis appears robust to deviations
from the single population assumption. The inclusion of
the aurochs genome increased the estimated age of the
T clade from 12.1 KY (HPD 95%: 8.2 - 16.4) to 16.1 KY
(HPD, highest posterior densities, 95%: 12.7 - 19.8).

Thus, the inclusion of an 11 KY-old T haplotype
sequence increases the estimated TMRCA of the relatively recent T clade by about one third under a coalescent population model. The 16.1 KY value is compatible
with the age estimated from the full European mtDNA
genome dataset and the phylogenetic approach. As
expected, the addition of the aurochs genome has little
impact on the estimated TMRCAs for the more basal
clades. For example, the median TMRCA for RPQT and
QT estimated with the aurochs genome are 83.6 KY
(95% HPD: 68.0 - 101.1) and 32.5 KY (95% HPD: 24.0 41.3) respectively, and 82.8 KY (95% HPD: 66.7 - 100.1)
and 30.1 KY (95% HPD: 21.8 - 40.0) without it.
Clearly, more ancient genomes will be necessary to
fully investigate the role of aurochs in the crucial time
interval following the domestication of cattle. However,
the data available so far suggest that the genetic variation in the cattle was strongly affected by a bottleneck
during the domestication process followed by an intense
demographic expansion, while a constant population
size model appears more appropriate for the aurochs
dynamic [29].

Conclusions
The complete Bos primigenius mtDNA genome generated from an 11 KY Italian skeleton as part of this study
has a genetic distance of 0.45% from a 6,700-year-old
sample recovered in England [30]. While the British
genome belongs to the now extremely rare P clade, the
Italian genome belongs to the T clade, a pre-Neolithic
homogeneous group of sequences which contains
sequences from the vast majority of modern cattle. This
supports the view, previously based on short mitochondrial fragments from several Mesolithic individuals and
modern breeds, that aurochs populations in northern
and southern regions were clearly differentiated, and
that southern European aurochsen may have played a
role during the domestication of modern cattle
[24,28,29]. Using a Bayesian approach, we also show
that the domestication process left a significant trace of

The estimated age (median and 95% HPD of the posterior distribution, in thousands of years) of several key monophyletic clades was calculated assuming that
the B. taurus - B. bison divergence occurred 1 MYA [35]. This calibration point is compatible with the demographic expansion detected in cattle mitochondrial
data resulting from the Neolithic domestication event. Ages are also calculated assuming that B. taurus - B. bison diverged 2 MY [27]. For comparison, the last
column reports the maximum likelihood estimates obtained in a previous study based on the 2 MY calibration point but a fixed topology [28], with standard
errors in parenthesis.

rapid demographic expansion in cattle mtDNA genomic
variation. Finally, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that
efforts to assign aurochs mitochondrial genomes within
specific cattle sub-clades of the T clade may be irrelevant, since the branching pattern within this clade
appears to contain several polytomies. This suggests that
studies of the domestication process, which essentially
involved individuals bearing T mtDNA genomes, may
be particularly complicated, and are likely to require
additional information from nuclear markers.

Methods
Mitochondrial genome sequencing in the aurochs

Various preliminary biochemical tests indicated that a
phalanx bone sample excavated in Vado all’Arancio rock
shelter (Massa Marittima, Grosseto, Italy, Figure 1) and
ascribed to Bos primigenius sp. by morphological and
morphometrical analysis [40], was well-preserved for
molecular analysis (Table S5, Additional File 8 and Figure
S4, Additional File 9). Three lines of evidence suggested
that endogenous biomolecules were likely to be wellpreserved [41,42]. Firstly, the degree of racemization for
three amino acids (aspartic acid, alanine and glutamine)
was low (Table S5, Additional file 8), and this has been
suggested to be compatible with DNA survival [42,43],
though concerns have been raised about the utility of this
approach [44,45]. Second, we calculated that, under our
reaction conditions, the estimated copy number of a 180
bp mtDNA target was greater than 5000 copies per reaction (5127 ± 912; standard curve fit values: Slope =
-3.391, Y-intercept = 45.34, R2 = 0.977, Efficiency = 0.97).
This value is much larger than the threshold under
which consensus sequence determination is thought to
be seriously affected by nucleotide modifications present
in the ancient DNA molecules [46]. Third, using a system
of three overlapping primer pairs we obtained the same
sequence for the hypervariable segment of the mtDNA
control region from different bone fragments and in multiple PCRs (Figure S4, Additional File 9).
The Vado all’Arancio rock shelter is a well known
Italian site with a clear stratigraphy, and was occupied
only for a short period of time during the Late Palaeolithic. The presence of specific artifacts and the radiocarbon dating of associated faunal remains (11,300 ± 150BP
obtained in Rome for R1333, and 11,600 ± 130 obtained
in Lyon for Ly3415; average of 11,450 years BP) unequivocally date Vado all’Arancio rockshelter to a preNeolithic context preceding the spread of domestication
[40]. This further confirms that the specimen belongs to
an aurochs, rather than an early Holocene Bos taurus.
We applied a combined typing strategy for mtDNA
genome sequencing. Multiplex PCR amplifications of
short overlapping fragments covering the whole mtDNA
genome were used to enrich the total extracted DNA,

Page 6 of 10

prior to 454 pyrosequencing of the pooled enriched
material. A multiplex PCR approach has previously been
used for the reconstruction of ancient mithocondrial genomes [1,47,48,17]. Compared with a singleplex PCR strategy, multiplex PCR has two advantages: first, a small
quantity of starting material can be used to retrieve multiple DNA fragments simultaneously, and second, limited
manipulation of the original template reduces the risk of
sporadic contamination by exogenous DNA.
We designed 130 overlapping primer pairs on the
basis of Bos taurus reference sequence (BRS) [31]. Primer pairs (designed to produce 155 to 230-bp long
DNA sequences) were arranged into four sets (A,B,C,D)
with overlapping pairs in different sets (see Additional
File 10). Each multiplex PCR set was performed on each
different extract following stringent criteria for ancient
DNA analysis and sequence authentication [41]. The
amplification success for each primer pair was checked
with secondary singleplex PCRs. All the amplification
products were then diluted to equal concentration,
pooled, and used as a substrate for the FLX library preparation and pyrosequencing reaction using the Roche
FLX/454 technology. After identifying sequence reads
with the PCR primers at their termini, the primers were
masked and the resulting portion mapped against the
reference sequence [NCBI accession: V00654] using the
Amplicon Variant Analyzer application (AVA, Roche)
with default parameters. Finally, starting from the AVA
multi-alignments, we generated consensus sequences
using a home-made Python script, which assigned the
most frequent base at each position. A large number of
mtDNA amplicons were sequenced to allow the consensus sequence to be determined accurately, without
laborious cloning and sequencing of PCR products.
Amplicons with no or low coverage (< 10 reads) after
the first round of sequencing were pooled again and
pyrosequenced separately.
Standard ancient DNA singleplex PCRs, cloning and
Sanger sequencing approaches were used to fill remaining gaps and resolve ambiguous sequences after the first
assembly of the total reads generated with the 454 technology. Particular attention was paid to insertions or
deletions in homopolymer regions that are problematic
for the 454 pyrosequencing technology [32], and to
potential misincorporations due to degradation in the
original template (see Additional File 10).
Finally, to check the reproducibility of the results, we
replicated 16 selected amplicons in three different
laboratories in Italy, Sweden and Australia (see Table
S3, Additional File 5, and the Additional File 10).
Amplicons that showed polymorphic positions with
respect to the BRS sequence, or with critical phylogenetic markers, were replicated at Uppsala University
(Sweden) and at the Innovation and Research Centre

Lari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/32

(San Michele all’Adige, Trento, Italy). Control region
fragments and a small portion of the 12S gene were
sequenced at Adelaide University (Australia).
Additional details regarding the sample and the molecular procedures are reported in the Additional File 10.
Phylogenetic analysis and demography

Phylogenetic inferences were performed on the coding
region (15440 bp) of the mtDNA alignment. The
model of nucleotide substitution was selected by
means of the MODELTEST software [49], according to
the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The model
resulting with the lowest AIC score was the GTR+g+I
(general time reversible model with heterogeneity in
substitution rates plus a proportion of invariable sites).
We performed Bayesian phylogenetic inference under
two prior models: a) an unrooted, strictly bifurcating
model, and b) an unrooted model allowing for polytomies (following the algorithm proposed in [50]).
Both analyses were performed using the software PHYCAS [51], and the input file for this analysis is provided as Additional File 11.
The first model is similar to the standard unrooted
model implemented in MRBAYES 3.1.2 [52] with the
difference that a hyperprior parameter is used to model
the rate of the exponential prior distribution on branch
lengths (while in MRBAYES such parameter is fixed and
set by the user). We used as hyperprior distribution an
inverse gamma with mean 1.0 and variance 10.0, following [53]. In the second model, a polytomy prior [50]
needs to be set. This value indicates the relative strength
of a less resolved topology compared to a more resolved
one: a value equal to 1 gives same prior to polytomic or
strictly bifurcating topologies, while values greater than
1 places more weight on polytomic topologies. We set
the polytomy prior to e (Nepero’s number), following
[50]. PHYCAS uses slice sampling to update continuous
parameters and the LOCAL move of Larget and Simon
[54] to update topology and branch lengths. In the second model that allowed for polytomies, a RJ-MCMC
scheme was used because each iteration the number of
parameters can change (as the number of branches vary
due to the presence of polytomies).
PHYCAS was run twice for 200,000 cycles for both
models. A cycle on PHYCAS roughly corresponds to
100 iterations in MRBAYES. We sampled one cycle
every 100, after discarding the first 100,000 cycles as
burn-in. We compared the traces of the two runs to
check for convergence. After the burn-in was removed,
we compared both models using Bayes Factors. The
Bayes Factor was computed as twice the difference
between the log of the marginal likelihoods, which were
approximated using the harmonic mean as suggested in
[55]. To check if the heating procedure could produce

different results (which would in turn implies that a single MCMC chain could not converge properly to the
correct posterior distribution), we ran the first model
using MRBAYES. The analysis was run twice using four
incrementally heated chains with the default temperature, over 2*10 8 generations long with a 20% burnin.
Convergence was checked by examining the generation
plot visualized with TRACER [56] and we computed the
potential scale reduction factor [57] with the sump function in MRBAYES. The resulting tree topology as well as
the posterior probabilities of the various nodes were
almost identical to the results obtained with PHYCAS,
suggesting that the posterior distribution was correctly
explored using PHYCAS even without the heating
procedure.
Molecular dating is subject to many sources of errors.
Indeed, usually topology and branch lengths are not
known a priori and they need to be estimated from data
with the associated uncertainty in the estimation procedure. In addition, the calibration of molecular clock
relies on a known divergence time which is often
assumed as a fixed value. The importance of a correct
calibration point (usually a fossil divergence) has been
well acknowledged in the phylogenetic literature, though
it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate that can be
readily translated into an accurate molecular clock rate.
The Bos spp. phylogeny is no exception to this rule, and
several different paleontological data have been used to
calibrate the bovid mitochondrial clock. For this reason,
we employed three divergent, though widely used calibration points and performed the following analyses for
all of them. The three points were: a split between
B. taurus and B. bison at 1 MYA [35], at 2 MYA [27]
and at 5 MYA [36].
We first performed phylogenetic dating on all our
dataset employing a bayesian algorithm implemented in
BEAST [58]. The input file for BEAST is provided as
Additional File 12. We choose a Yule prior [59] on
topology and branch lengths and constrained the root of
our phylogeny (which coincides with the split B. taurus-B.
bison) to one of the three calibration points above (i.e.,
1MY, 2MY, and 5MY). Since the new B. primigenius specimen is dated at more than 11,000 years B.P., we
excluded it from this analysis as the Yule prior has not
been adapted to handle serial data. We ran each of these
analyses twice for 20,000,000 MCMC, with a thinning
value of 1,000. Since these models differ only in the age of
one node, we could have just estimated the scaled branch
lengths and used the three calibration points to translate
them into years. The three analyses can be however considered as an additional check for convergence. We
removed the first 10% MCMC iterations as burnin. Under
this phylogenetic dating approach, we computed the
TMRCA of several nodes of interest and, at the same

time, estimated the posterior distribution of the molecular
clock rate.
We then selected only Italian cattle and performed
bayesian based population genetic inference and molecular dating under two coalescent priors: constant
population size and the Bayesian skyline plot [58], with
gene genealogies divided into three internode groups
and effective population size function fitted with a piecewise constant function of population size change.
Both analyses were run using BEAST software for
20,000,000 MCMC iterations with a 10% burn-in and a
thinning interval of 1,000. The input file for BEAST is
provided as Additional File 13. As local domestication
and/or introgression from aurochs into domestic
breeds in Italy cannot be excluded [24,27-29], these
analyses were perfomed both without the new Bos primigenius sequence and including it (i.e., assuming that
Italian aurochs were direct ancestor of modern Italian
breeds). The constant population size model and the
Bayesian skyline were compared by means of Bayes
Factor, computed as described above. In these analyses,
the mutation rate was fixed as the median values estimated from the previous BEAST phylogenetic analyses.
These values, corresponding respectively to 1, 2, and 5
million years of divergence between B. taurus and B.
bison, are 3.3*10 -8 , 1.6*10 -8 , and 6.6*10 -9 . Population
sizes were estimated assuming a generation time of 7
years [60].
