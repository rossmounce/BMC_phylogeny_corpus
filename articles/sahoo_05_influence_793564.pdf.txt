Abstract
Background: We have examined genetic diversity at fifteen autosomal microsatellite loci in seven
predominant populations of Orissa to decipher whether populations inhabiting the same
geographic region can be differentiated on the basis of language or ancestry. The studied
populations have diverse historical accounts of their origin, belong to two major ethnic groups and
different linguistic families. Caucasoid caste populations are speakers of Indo-European language
and comprise Brahmins, Khandayat, Karan and Gope, while the three Australoid tribal populations
include two Austric speakers: Juang and Saora and a Dravidian speaking population, Paroja. These
divergent groups provide a varied substratum for understanding variation of genetic patterns in a
geographical area resulting from differential admixture between migrants groups and aboriginals,
and the influence of this admixture on population stratification.
Results: The allele distribution pattern showed uniformity in the studied groups with
approximately 81% genetic variability within populations. The coefficient of gene differentiation was
found to be significantly higher in tribes (0.014) than caste groups (0.004). Genetic variance
between the groups was 0.34% in both ethnic and linguistic clusters and statistically significant only
in the ethnic apportionment. Although the populations were genetically close (FST = 0.010), the
contemporary caste and tribal groups formed distinct clusters in both Principal-Component plot
and Neighbor-Joining tree. In the phylogenetic tree, the Orissa Brahmins showed close affinity to
populations of North India, while Khandayat and Gope clustered with the tribal groups, suggesting
a possibility of their origin from indigenous people.
Conclusions: The extent of genetic differentiation in the contemporary caste and tribal groups of
Orissa is highly significant and constitutes two distinct genetic clusters. Based on our observations,
we suggest that since genetic distances and coefficient of gene differentiation were fairly small, the
studied populations are indeed genetically similar and that the genetic structure of populations in a
geographical region is primarily influenced by their ancestry and not by socio-cultural hierarchy or
language. The scenario of genetic structure, however, might be different for other regions of the
subcontinent where populations have more similar ethnic and linguistic backgrounds and there
might be variations in the patterns of genomic and socio-cultural affinities in different geographical
regions.

Background
Human society in a geographic area develops when colonizing populations bring along with them different languages, cultures and technological advancements over a
period of time. As more populations migrate to settle in
the same area, they are either eliminated, subjugated or
absorbed [1]. In India, majority of incoming populations
have been absorbed, forming heterogeneous and complex
human societies. A few have subjugated the subservient
cultures to establish a hierarchical caste system or have
totally isolated some groups such as tribes, which still
remain outside the social boundaries. This practice has
enriched India with populations having varied socio-cultural and linguistic diversities that have flourished independently, nurtured by the vast geographical and
ecological regime [2]. Studies based on various DNA
markers on diverse populations occupying different geographical areas of the Indian subcontinent have revealed
much about the presence of large extent of human genetic
variation [3-10] and the distinct genetic difference
between castes and tribal populations of India [11-13].
These studies, however fail to characterize the structure of
populations in geographic contiguity, where populations
with different language and social hierarchies cohabit
together. Although distinct social demarcation between
castes and tribes is well established, the origin of a few
populations of India still remains controversial. Though
many castes are known to have tribal origins [14], nevertheless their assessment with polymorphic DNA markers
still remains incomplete.
This study aims to understand the genetic diversity of populations of Orissa and examines the role of language and
genetic origin on structure of populations inhabiting the
same geographic region and evaluates some of the suggested population histories from a molecular perspective.
Orissa is a coastal state in the southeast region of India,
which is occupied by population groups having varied
ethnicity, belonging to different strata of the hierarchical
caste system and speaking languages belonging to different linguistic families. Its strategic geographic location
between Northern plains and peninsular Southern India
and cultures assimilated during the 4th – 5th century B.C.
from southeast Asian countries of Java, Sumatra, Brunei
and Indonesia [15] have enriched the socio-cultural diversity of contemporary populations of Orissa. The extant
populations of the region can be broadly classified into
two major social groups; castes and tribes. Brahmin,
Khandayat, Karan and Gope comprise a large section of
Indo-European speaking caste populations of Orissa,
whose position in hierarchical caste system is governed by
occupation and where ancestry is patrilineal. Brahmins
form the priestly class who occupy uppermost strata in the
caste hierarchy, with historical accounts that trace their
migration from upper Gangetic regions of north India.

¯
Next in hierarchy is the Kshatriya – a warrior group comprising the Khandayats; followed by Karans (Kayastha
¯),
record keepers and Gope are cattle-breeders who occupy
the subsequent strata in caste system [16]. Other than
caste groups, tribes constitute a large number of aboriginal Australoid populations of Orissa who are predominantly forest dwellers, most of them having their own
dialects. Linguistically, the tribal groups of the region can
be categorized into three of the four major language families spoken in India: Indo-European, Austro-asiatic and
Dravidian. Kharia, Juang, Gadaba, Ho, Munda and Saora
are among few of the most ancient tribes whose dialects
belong to the Austro-asiatic linguistic family, while those
of Paroja, Oraon and Kondh belong to the Dravidian linguistic group [16]. Of these populations, only a few
(Paroja, Agharia, Gaud, Tanti) have been included in
studies using DNA markers to get a perspective of the
overall genetic diversity present in the country [8,11,12].
Hence, to understand the genetic constitution of these
ethnically and linguistically diverse populations, we have
used autosomal microsatellites, genetic markers with
proven precision in deciphering genomic diversity and
affinities of human populations [17].
Microsatellites or short tandem repeats (STRs) are most
extensively used for elucidating the genetic diversity and
evolution of human populations because of their abundance and prevalence in the genome, high level of polymorphism and amenability to automation [18-23]. High
mutation rates of STR loci facilitate inferences to be drawn
about population substructure and short-term evolutions
and to make a more reliable and precise estimation of
phylogenetic relationships among populations both at
racial and continental levels [24-29]. Also, most questions
of anthropological interest involve processes occurring
over relatively short time periods, during which substantial genetic drift and migration may occur but fewer mutations get accumulated. These minor changes are easily
detected using STR markers rather than bi-allelic markers,
where mutations accumulate slowly through evolutionary
time. STR markers are therefore markers of choice for this
study, which involves closely related populations that
share similar ethnicity, language, culture or history of
origin.
In this study, we have examined variation at 15 autosomal
STR loci in a sample of 404 individuals from Orissa (Table
1, Figure 1) and compared the results with previously
published data from other regions of the Indian subcontinent. Our aim was (i) to assess the genetic diversity and
relationship of populations of Orissa with other Indian
populations, and (ii) to find out the role of language and
ancestry, if any, on genetic structure of populations living
in geographic contiguity. This study also allows a finer

Results
Nature and extent of allelic diversity
The distribution of allele frequencies and tests of HardyWeinberg Equilibrium (HWE) on the seven populations
of Orissa have been previously reported [30,31]. Except
for Saora, all other studied populations were found to be

in HWE. Saora showed significant departures from HWE
at three analysed parameters (p < 0.05 for exact test and
homozygosity test; p < 0.1 for log-likelihood ratio test)
and a lower heterozygosity value (0.571) compared to the
expected estimates of allele frequencies at D3S1358 locus.
Number of alleles and most common alleles at the fifteen
STR loci along with gene diversity of each of the studied
seven populations are shown in Table 2a, 2b and 3. The
most common alleles at each of the 15 STR loci were

shared between 2–4 populations. These results agree with
the analysis of 4 STR loci (CSF1Po, TPOX, THO1 and
vWA) reported by Mukerjee et al, 1999 on three populations of Orissa (Agharia, Gaud and Tanti). The number of
alleles observed in the studied population and heterozygosity values (0.615–0.967) indicate that the selected STR
markers are highly polymorphic in all populations and

that genetic variability within populations is significantly
high across populations with mean gene diversity of 81%.
Extent of differentiation between populations
To quantify the amount of genetic diversity that exists
among populations, FST was calculated separately for caste
groups and tribes. The coefficient of gene differentiation
was found to be significantly higher in tribes (0.014) than
caste groups (0.004). Combining all seven populations
yielded an FST of 1%, demonstrating low level of population differentiation within Orissa. All values of FST were
significantly different from zero (p < 0.05). Analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) presented in Table 4,
revealed that as a single group, a large extent of genetic
variation (98.98%) was present within the populations of
the region. To determine how the residual genetic variance was compartmentalized, we grouped the
populations into (i) caste and tribes, (ii) linguistic groups;
Indo-European speaking caste populations (Oriya Brahmins, Karan, Khandayat, Gope), Austro-Asiatic speakers
Juang and Saora and Dravidian speaking, Paroja and (iii)
according to their origins as suggested by historical
accounts. The genetic variance between the groups varied

from 0.25% to 0.34% and was equally distributed in both
ethnic and linguistic clusters, but statistically significant
only in the ethnic apportionment.
Because the amount of genetic variance between groups
was found to be low, we also used clustering algorithm
implemented in STRUCTURE analysis (Figure 2) to
explore the population structure and relationship among
these geographically contiguous but socially and linguistically disparate populations. When the populations were
analysed assuming no admixture model and K varying
from 1 to 7, only a single distinct genetic cluster could be
found with the highest log likelihood value at K = 3. Most
of the individuals of the seven populations clustered in
cluster 1 and did not split into distinct clusters corresponding to their population affinities. A few of the individuals of Paroja and Khandayat were found in cluster 2
and 3 respectively.
Genetic relationship among populations
The inter-population genetic relationship among Brahmins, Khandayat, Karan, Gope, Juang, Saora and Paroja
was determined using principal component analysis. The
plot (Figure 3) of principal component (PC) depicts population configurations in accordance with their ethnic
affiliations. Together, the first two principal coordinates
described almost 99.9% of the variance in the distance
matrix. The caste populations (Brahmins, Khandayat and
Karan) and the three tribal populations of Juang, Saora
and Paroja were distinctly separated by the first component of the distance matrix. All the caste populations were
found to cluster in the upper right quadrant while the
tribes distinctly occupied the lower right quadrant. The
only discordance was position of Gope, where this
population was genetically separate from the other studied caste populations in the PC plot.

tions from populations of Bihar [32,33], Uttar Pradesh
[34], Maharastra [35,36] and Tamil Nadu [37], belonging
to similar rank and occupational affiliation in the caste
hierarchy. The genetic closeness exhibited by Brahmins of
Orissa to those of North India (NJ tree; Figure 4) was
clearly discernible, supported by moderately high bootstrap values. While Karan belonging to the next level of
hierarchy in the caste system showed similarity to Maratha, a warrior group of Maharastra; Khandayats and
Gope depicted affinity to the tribal populations (Figure
4). Paroja, a Dravidian linguistic group, demonstrated
affinity with Gonds, and the two Austro-Asiatic speakers
Juang and Saora distinctly branched out in the phylogenetic tree.

Discussion
India is a remarkable representation of a large segmented
society that harbours rich genetic diversity within its
human populations and offers myriads of attributes to
study the various factors influencing demographics of
human populations. It is of particular interest to study
patterns of genetic affinities among endogamous groups
inhabiting small geographical regions within the
subcontinent because of their diverse origins and interethnic admixtures.
We have typed a set of fifteen polymorphic autosomal
microsatellite markers in linguistically and socially divergent populations with different histories of origin to elucidate the genetic diversities and affinities among them
and to understand the role of genetic origin and language
on the genetic structure of populations living in geographic contiguity. The most distinctive feature of our
study was the clear delineation between castes and tribes,
as was evident from both multivariate and phylogenetic
analyses (Figure 3 and 4 respectively). The tribes seem to
be the most unique and genetically isolated populations
within Orissa. The two Austro-Asiatic tribes Juang and
Saora were not significantly different from each other and

both showed least number of alleles even at the most polymorphic STR loci such as, D21S11, D18S51, Penta E and
FGA (Table 2a, 2b) and lowest heterozygosity values in as
many as six loci as compared to the caste groups [30,31].
The tribal groups show relatively high between group
differentiation that probably can be attributed to reproductive isolation and drift. This finding is consistent with
similar studies carried on tribal populations of Central
India [6]. The low heterozygosity estimate of tribes suggests that they have probably undergone some stochastic
processes that have resulted from limitations in mating
practices and socio-cultural differences in them.

The significantly low coefficient of differentiation among
the seven populations (Fst: 0.010, p < 0.05), along with
the number of alleles shared between them, confirms
admixture and suggests an increased genetic affinity
among populations residing in geographic proximity irrespective of their socio-cultural affiliation [3,38,39]. This is
also substantiated with the AMOVA and Structure results,
which showed that all the individuals of the studied populations cluster in one group and could not be subdivided
further. The inability of STRUCTURE analysis to subdivide populations may be due to gene flow among groups
or may be that more number of samples and loci are
required to identify such close genetic subgroups.

Among the caste groups, Orissa Brahmin showed close
affinity to the other upper caste populations of North
India rather than to its geographic neighbors. The affinity
between Bihar Brahmin and Orissa Brahmin was supported with moderate bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 4), which could be attributed to gene
flow between them because of sharing same hierarchical
status in the Hindu caste system [9]. This observation
corroborates prevalent historical accounts, which suggests
that the Brahmin populations of different parts of the subcontinent were natives of upper Gangetic region, who
later dispersed to different parts of the country to propagate their cultural and religious ideologies and to explore
better economic opportunities [15]. The phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4) also clearly depicted that Khandayat and Gope
are genetically more related to each other than to other

occupationally similar populations (Rajput, Thakur, Maratha and Yadav) of adjoining regions. These results are in
congruence with the observations of Majumder et al 1998,
where populations studied from widely separated geographic areas were found to exhibit closer genomic affinities with their geographic neighbors than with those
sharing similar social ranks. It also substantiates the suggested origin of Khandayat from skilled individuals drawn
from peasantry and aboriginals of the region [14].
Because the natives were assimilated into the caste system,
they adopted the language and culture of the expanding
and dominant upper caste population as a consequence
of 'elite-dominance'. Their gene pool, however, still
remains closer to aboriginals of the region. Therefore,
except Brahmins, other groups were probably pooled
from the local people to serve the needs of upper castes in

the brahminical society. Thus, two castes bearing similar
names simply represent affiliation to the same profession,
but have probably different genetic constitution in different geographical regions. When populations of diverse
geographic regions were included, the genetic difference
among populations of the Indian subcontinent increased.
This can probably be ascribed to drift caused by limitations imposed on social mobility between groups due to
differences in culture and language. Juang and Saora
speak Austro-Asiatic languages while Paroja follow the
Dravidian language, both of which are unrelated to Oriya
and by itself is a branch of Indo-European linguistic family spoken largely by the caste groups. PC analysis (Figure
3) revealed distinct isolation of the tribes from the Oriya
speaking caste populations. The position of Juang and
Saora in the NJ tree suggests that they are genetically still
separate from other populations and extent of admixture
in them from neighboring caste groups is negligible. It is
also discernible that genetic distance among tribes is more
strongly correlated with their genetic origin, with Paroja
forming a close cluster with Madia Gond, a Dravidian
tribe of India. This also substantiates the historical
account describing Paroja to be an offshoot of the Gonds,
one of the largest tribal populations of India. The NJ tree
clearly shows that ethnic affiliation (caste/ tribe) and
genetic ancestry are the key factors in shaping the genetic
variation and sub-structuring among populations in geographic contiguity.

Conclusions
Our study on linguistically distinct but geographically
contiguous populations of Orissa using autosomal microsatellite markers reveals a significant amount genetic
homogeneity in them. AMOVA results suggest that linguistic differences probably play a negligible role in the
present day scenario in restricting gene flow between these
populations. The middle-order caste groups shared
genetic affinity with the local people of the area, while the
Brahmins were similar to those from northern regions.
Tribal populations, on the other hand, because of their
long-term isolation and mating patterns, were well differentiated from the upper caste groups. This paper provides
evidence that for populations living in geographic contiguity, ancestry is the governing factor in fine-tuning of
genetic differentiation.

Methods
Population samples analyzed
Blood samples were collected from randomly chosen consenting volunteers, distributed across 17° -48' and 22° 34' North latitude and 81° -24' and 87° -29' East longitude of Orissa (Figure 1). A total of 404 individuals from
seven populations, Brahmins (n = 57), Khandayat (n =
62), Karan (n = 62), Gope (n = 60), Juang (n = 50), Saora
(n = 35), and Paroja (n = 78) were analyzed for the fifteen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/4

autosomal microsatellite loci. These populations were categorized based on ethnic and linguistic criteria (Table 1).
The populations used for comparison in the study were
selected on the basis of ethnicity, language and occupational similarity: Kanyakubj Brahmins (95), Bihar Brahmins (59), Kayastha (53), Yadav (44), Bhumihar (65),
Rajput (58), Thakur (48), Irular (54), Maratha (65),
Madia Gond (45), Katkari (72) and Pawara (51).
DNA typing
DNA was extracted from blood samples using standard
phenol-chloroform procedure and amplified for fifteen
autosomal microsatellite loci using primers multiplexed
in the Powerplex 16 System (Promega Corp., Madison,
Wisconsin). STR loci analyzed in the study included
thirteen tetranucleotides D3S1358, THO1, D21S11,
D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539,
CSF1PO, vWA, D8S1179, TPOX, FGA and two pentanuleotides, PentaD and PentaE.
Analysis of data
The genetic structure of the populations was analyzed at
two hierarchical levels – within populations and among
populations. The intrapopulation variability was estimated by analyzing the number of alleles and most common allele at individual loci and by estimating the average
gene diversity [40] across the fifteen microsatellite loci. To
understand the genetic variation among populations; FST
estimates, genetic distance and the analysis of molecular
variance [41] were calculated. Genetic relationships
among populations were analyzed using the Principal
Component Analysis [42]. Genetic distances were estimated by using the DA distance measure [43], and were
used to construct neighbor-joining tree [44]. The degree of
support for the branches was evaluated by bootstrap analysis. To test the correspondence of genetic clusters with
linguistically labeled groups, we used STRUCTURE program [45] assuming that each individual had ancestry in
all clusters, so that fractions of ancestry in various clusters
could be estimated.

Authors' contributions
