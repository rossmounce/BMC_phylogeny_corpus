The evolution of antennal courtship in
diplazontine parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera,
Ichneumonidae, Diplazontinae)
Seraina Klopfstein1,2*, Donald LJ Quicke3,4, Christian Kropf1

Abstract
Background: As predicted by theory, traits associated with reproduction often evolve at a comparatively high
speed. This is especially the case for courtship behaviour which plays a central role in reproductive isolation. On
the other hand, courtship behavioural traits often involve morphological and behavioural adaptations in both
sexes; this suggests that their evolution might be under severe constraints, for instance irreversibility of character
loss. Here, we use a recently proposed method to retrieve data on a peculiar courtship behavioural trait, i.e.
antennal coiling, for 56 species of diplazontine parasitoid wasps. On the basis of a well-resolved phylogeny, we
reconstruct the evolutionary history of antennal coiling and associated morphological modifications to study the
mode of evolution of this complex character system.
Results: Our study reveals a large variation in shape, location and ultra-structure of male-specific modifications on
the antennae. As for antennal coiling, we find either single-coiling, double-coiling or the absence of coiling; each
state is present in multiple genera. Using a model comparison approach, we show that the possession of antennal
modifications is highly correlated with antennal coiling behaviour. Ancestral state reconstruction shows that both
antennal modifications and antennal coiling are highly congruent with the molecular phylogeny, implying low
levels of homoplasy and a comparatively low speed of evolution. Antennal coiling is lost on two independent
occasions, and never reacquired. A zero rate of regaining antennal coiling is supported by maximum parsimony,
maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
Conclusions: Our study provides the first comparative evidence for a tight correlation between male-specific
antennal modifications and the use of the antennae during courtship. Antennal coiling in Diplazontinae evolved at
a comparatively low rate, and was never reacquired in any of the studied taxa. This suggests that the loss of
antennal coiling is irreversible on the timescale examined here, and therefore that evolutionary constraints have
greatly influenced the evolution of antennal courtship in this group of parasitoid wasps. Further studies are needed
to ascertain whether the loss of antennal coiling is irreversible on larger timescales, and whether evolutionary
constraints have influenced courtship behavioural traits in a similar way in other groups.

Background
Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that traits
linked to reproduction evolve more rapidly than other
traits and might be involved in speciation processes
[1-7]. Well-known examples are the often species-specific genitalia of spiders and insects [8-10], weapons
involved in male-male competition over access to
females [11,12], or ornamentation characters influencing

female choice [13-15]. A trait complex that might evolve
even more quickly than sexually dimorphic morphological characters is courtship behaviour, which might be
modified under sexual selection long before morphological adaptations take place [16-20]. While the diversifying
role of sexual selection in shaping courtship behaviour
has been extensively studied, the role of evolutionary
constraints has gained less attention [17,21-23]. The
most obvious mode of constrained evolution is irreversibility, or the fact that some traits once lost cannot be
reacquired. This is sometimes referred to as Dollo’s law,

and the characters involved as Dollo characters [21,24].
Typically, Dollo characters are either very complex or
involve modifications at different levels, e.g. morphology
and behaviour. Courtship related traits could represent
such character systems, often involving specialized morphological adaptations and different behavioural components from both the male and female sex. Under the
constraint argumentation, courtship characters, as long
as they invoke also morphological adaptation, might
thus evolve rather slowly, and moreover follow restricted
pathways, with some characters only being lost and
never reacquired during the evolutionary history of a
group.
Courtship behaviour has been studied extensively in a
wide range of taxa, but with a strong bias towards vertebrates. To understand the role of sexual selection in the
diversification of life, it is important to study especially
diverse groups, such as the insect order Hymenoptera.
In this order, many species from a wide range of
families have peculiar, male-specific modifications of the
antennae [25-32]. Many such modifications have been
shown to be connected to internal glands secreting a
contact pheromone, and in some species, there is
experimental evidence for antennal courtship mediating
mate acceptance [26,33]. However, descriptions of
hymenopteran courtship behaviour are rather scarce. In
most species, courtship can only be observed if virgin
females are at hand, which often requires rearing. In
parasitoids, which account for the vast majority of
hymenopteran species, this may also necessitate rearing
the host as well. This is either very intricate or even
impossible for species with unknown host relationships.
Courtship data are consequently very sporadic and
biased towards those species that can easily be cultured
[29,34-44]. However, to conduct comparative studies
and to reconstruct the evolution of courtship behaviour,
an extensive taxon sampling is needed.
Recently, Steiner et al. [45] proposed a simple method
to reproduce a specific form of courtship-related antennation, i.e. antennal coiling, in museum specimens. This
method relies on the fact that the movement of the
antennal flagellum is achieved by differences in haemolymph pressure and in the elasticity of the intersegmental membranes, since muscles are missing from
flagelliform antennae of all insects. This coiling test acts
as a proxy for courtship behaviour, as demonstrated in
four hymenopteran species with known courtship behaviour [26,45,46]. Here we use this test to obtain antennal coiling data for 56 species of Diplazontinae, and
examine the antennal morphology of a total of 64 species. Compared to other ichneumonid subfamilies [27],
the Diplazontinae exhibit a large variation in the morphology and location of male-specific antennal structures, the so-called “tyloids”. Using a well supported

Page 2 of 12

phylogeny of the group [[47], unpublished data], we
assess the correlation between tyloids and antennal
coiling in a comparative framework. We reconstruct the
evolutionary history of tyloid morphology, tyloid location and antennal coiling under maximum parsimony,
maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Finally,
we investigate whether the tyloid/antennal coiling
character system shows signs of accelerated or of
constrained evolution on the phylogeny.

Results
Variation in tyloid morphology and coiling behaviour

Of the 64 diplazontine species studied here, 34 have
male-specific antennal modifications (Table 1). These
tyloids show a large variability in terms of their shape,
coloration and location on the antenna (Fig. 1, Table 2),
with the shape ranging from narrowly linear tyloids,
stretching over the whole length of the antennal segment, to broadly oval or drop-shaped, short tyloids
(Table 1). Most of the tyloids were plain coloured,
usually sharing the colour of the surrounding area, but
some species possess two-coloured tyloids with a yellow
and a dark brown half. In other ichneumonid and braconid subfamilies, only a single or at most two different
types of tyloids can be found [27]. SEM investigations
revealed numerous pores on the surface of those tyloids
in 7 of 8 examined species with tyloids. In Enizemum
ornatum, a species with broadly linear tyloids specific to
the genus, we could not detect any pores (Figs. 1B and
1D); this brings into question whether the tyloids in this
species are also used to transfer a secretion during
courtship, or whether they rather serve for mechanical
stimulation. The number and positions of tyloids on the
antennae are correlated, with a low number of tyloids
always being located on the middle segments of the
antennae, and larger numbers of tyloids either ranging
from the basal segments to the middle or from the middle close to the apex (Table 1).
We performed the coiling test with 22 female specimens from 11 species and 110 male specimens from 56
species. There was a clear sexual dimorphism in the
reaction to the coiling test. While the antennae of all
females bent slightly at the middle, the configurational
changes observed in the male specimens varied a lot
between genera and species. They ranged from an even
curve of the antenna (no coiling, Fig. 2A), to a single,
tight coil in the middle of the antenna (single-coiling,
Fig. 2B) and two consecutive turns (double-coiling,
Fig. 2C). Each coiling type was observed in at least two
genera, and no intra-generic variation was observed
except in the genus Homotropus (Table 1). The convex
tyloids in all cases are located in a way that they face
towards the inside of the coils, where they would be in
close contact with the female antennae.

Ancestral state reconstructions

Ancestral state reconstructions of tyloid morphology by
maximum likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods are
similar, but with some differences especially in the
reconstruction of the tyloid shape (Table 2). Both methods reveal that the most recent common ancestor of the
studied diplazontines probably had narrowly linear, long
and plain-coloured tyloids such as in Promethes, Syrphoctonus, Homotropus and related genera (Table 2).

The location of those tyloids cannot be unambiguously
reconstructed, with a middle position being favoured by
maximum likelihood and an apical position favoured by
the Bayesian analysis.
The MP, ML and Bayesian reconstructions of ancestral states in antennal coiling are shown in Figure 3.

perform single-coiling. The ancestor of the Syrphoctonus
clade probably performed double-coiling, with coiling
subsequently lost in the genus Woldstedtius and transformed to single-coiling on two separate occasions, in
Fossatyloides gracilentus and Homotropus vitreus. The
Diplazon genus group probably lost any form of antennal coiling during courtship already in its stem lineage.
The evolution of tyloids and antennal coiling

To test whether tyloids and antennal coiling evolved in
a correlated manner, we compared the likelihoods of a
model assuming independent evolution to a model
assuming that the two traits co-evolve [48]. The likelihood ratio test revealed significant support for the
dependent model (LHR = 15.43, df = 4, p = 0.0039).
This result was confirmed by the Bayesian approach

which converged on the dependent model with 99.98%
posterior probability (Bayes factor = 9.8). The correlation between tyloid possession and antennal coiling was
almost strict, with Sussaba cognata as the single exception. This species lacks tyloids or similar structures (as
confirmed by SEM, Table 1), but consistently displays
single coiling when examined with the coiling test.
Overall, the rate of evolution of both morphological
and behavioural characters was rather low, as indicated
in Figure 3 for antennal coiling. The consistency (CI)
and retention index (RI) of presence and absence of
both tyloids and coiling behaviour indicated low levels
of homoplasy (CI = 0.333 and RI = 0.931 for tyloids and
CI = 0.500 and RI = 0.960 for coiling behaviour). To
further study the mode of evolution of antennal coiling
in Diplazontinae, we examined more closely the

estimated transition rates between the two states, especially, whether the rate of change from the state ‘absent’
to ‘present’ (rate0- > 1) was equal to zero. To this end,
we restricted the transition rates to being either all
equal or one of them being zero, and compared the outcomes to the unrestricted case with two different transition rates. Under the unrestricted model, the rate0- > 1
was estimated to be zero, and this model had the highest likelihood. However, when compared to the equal
rates model, this increase in likelihood was not significant with the likelihood ratio test (LRH = 1.61, df = 1,
p = 0.20). The posterior probability of rate0- > 1 being
zero was estimated as 72% by the MCMC approach,
which integrates over phylogenetic uncertainty. When
taking the mode of antennal coiling into account, ML
estimations confirm a zero rate for the transitions 0- >
1 and 0- > 2, as shown in Figure 4A. The corresponding
posterior probability distributions obtained from the
Bayesian analysis are shown in Figure 4B.

Discussion
We successfully applied the coiling test developed by
Steiner et al. [45] to obtain courtship behavioural data for
a large number of parasitoid wasp species to reconstruct
the evolution of this trait. The underlying assumption
was that the coiling test performed on dead specimens
provides information about the mode of antennal coiling
actually performed by the wasps. The observed sexual
dimorphism in the outcome of the antennal coiling test
supports this assumption, as does the high correspondence between the configurational change of the antenna

and the movement actually performed by the males in
Syrphoctonus tarsatorius. Three other hymenopterans for
which information on antennal courtship is available
further confirm this link [[45], unpublished results].
However, we have to bear in mind that species not showing any coiling in the test might still perform another
form of antennal courtship, such as antennal tapping or
stroking. Moreover, the link between the outcome of the
test and the behaviour actually displayed during courtship might not be strict, as the coiling test only reflects
the presence of the morphological requirements to perform antennal coiling. In Sussaba cognata, the only species in the Sussaba genus group that does not possess
any tyloids but still performs antennal coiling in the coiling test, one could imagine that the morphological
requirements for coiling have not yet been completely
reduced, although the tyloids as release and spread structures for a courtship pheromone are absent. It would be
of great interest to know whether the males of this species actually do or do not perform antennal coiling during courtship. Such data would provide insights into how
the different aspects of the tyloid/antennal coiling system
co-evolve, i.e. the behaviour of the males per se, the morphological prerequisites for the movement, the tyloids as
release and spread structures for a sex pheromone and
finally the preference of the females. The observation
that not all aspects of this character complex need to be
present in all species opens up the possibility of evolution
through intermediate stages. Enizemum ornatum provides another such example. Although this species possesses tyloids, we could see no pores on their surface

unlike in all the other species examined. The absence of
tyloid pores might indicate that they no longer serve as
release and spread structures for a courtship pheromone.
Instead, they could be involved in purely mechanical stimulation in this species.
The strong correlation observed in diplazontines
between tyloids and antennal coiling further supports
the hypothesis that male-specific antennal modifications
are likely involved in courtship [25,26,29,31-33,39,42,49].
Various forms of antennal courtship have been
described in this diverse insect order, and even more
diverse antennal modifications. As exemplified in the
present study, the coiling test could be used to further

establish the link between morphology and behaviour in
the case of antennal courtship [45], and shed light on
the evolution of courtship behaviour in this order.
The overall low rate of evolution and low levels of
homoplasy in the courtship traits analyzed here seem to
contradict previous assertions that characters under sexual selection would evolve at comparatively high rates
[1-4,6,9]. However, there are numerous previous examples demonstrating that parts of courtship behaviour
can evolve in a very conservative mode, translating in
high phylogenetic informativeness of some courtship
characters [50-53]. Although sexual selection can in
some cases lead to accelerated evolution, this does not

need to be the case, and might largely depend on the
variability of a trait and on geographic and population
dynamic patterns [16]. Moreover, it has been shown
that female preference sometimes even imposes selection against a change in mating behaviour, thus decelerating the speed of evolution [e.g. [54]]. Courtship
behavioural traits are accordingly influenced by a variety
of selective pressures and evolutionary constraint which
might differ between traits in a single species. In our
case, the estimation of a zero rate of regain of antennal
coiling suggests that this trait is under severe constraints
and that its loss evolves as an irreversible character, at
least over the timescale examined. This is further supported by the fact that the loss of antennal coiling

Page 9 of 12

involved 31 species in two groups, implying that there
would have been plenty of time for a re-acquisition of
the coiling state. On the other hand, there is a large variation found in antennal modifications in this subfamily,
especially in the Sussaba genus group, implying that a
more detailed examination of courtship behaviour in
Diplazontinae might reveal a larger variation and higher
evolutionary lability in other courtship traits.
The concept of irreversibility of evolution was already
introduced by Dollo in 1893 [24], and has been extensively disputed in the past [e.g. [55,56]]. It has been
invoked to explain patterns of evolution of complex morphological characters, of sex determination systems, polyploidy and parthenogenesis, of gains and losses of genes,
and many others [56-59]. In our case, there are arguments both in favour and against antennal coiling being a
Dollo character in the narrow sense. From a theoretical
point of view, a complex trait involving different character systems is difficult to be regained, once it is lost, and
this description clearly applies to antennal coiling. On
the other hand, there might be some pre-adaptations that
could favour the reacquisition of some form of antennal
courtship in parasitoid hymenopterans. For instance, the
high sensitivity of the female antenna which is needed for
host location and evaluation could facilitate the evolution
of male behaviours that target the antenna of the female
for sexual stimulation. Moreover, in the mounted
position, the male body parts that can most easily access
the female’s antennae are the male’s antennae. The variability of antennal courtship and related morphological
adaptations in the order Hymenoptera further suggest
that these behaviours might not all be homologous, but
instead might represent convergent evolutionary events.
Further studies on a larger evolutionary scale are needed
to ascertain the irreversibility of a loss of antennal
courtship in Hymenoptera.

Conclusions
Antennal coiling is a mode of courtship found in many
hymenopteran and even other insect species, and represents a complex character involving both morphological
and behavioural adaptations. We here demonstrate in a
comparative context that antennal courtship is highly
correlated with the possession of sexually dimorphic
antennal modification in diplazontine parasitoid wasps.
Moreover, we show that antennal coiling evolves at a
low rate. It is lost two times independently in the subfamily and never re-acquired, which is in accordance
with Dollo’s law of irreversibility of evolution.
Methods
Tyloid morphology

Presence and absence of tyloids and morphological types
were recorded for 64 species of Diplazontinae,

Klopfstein et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:218
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/218

classifying all male-specific, convex antennal structures
of a minimum size of one fifth of the diameter of an
antennal segment as tyloids, following the conception of
Diller [60]. To study the evolution of the tyloids, we
classified them into different types, examining their
number, length, shape and colour. To indicate the location of the tyloids on the antennae, we progressively
numbered the antennal segments from the segment
attached to the head capsule (scape) to the apex following Bin and Vinson [31]. The use of a stereo-microscope
(Leica Wild M10) at magnification 80 proved sufficient
to score these data; however, to make sure not to have
overlooked tyloid-like structures and to study the ultrastructure, we further examined some species by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To this end, the
antennae of males stored in 80% ethanol were mounted,
air dried and gold-sputtered. SEM studies were performed with a Philips XL30 FEG scanning electron
microscope. No overlooked, tyloid-like structures were
found by SEM analysis.
Reproducing antennal coiling

Courtship behaviour has to date only been described in
two diplazontine species [45,46]. To simulate a change of
pressure inside the antennae and thus reproduce antennal
courtship in museum specimens, we used a method developed by Steiner et al. [45]. We first cut off the antennae of
dried specimens or of specimens kept in 80% ethanol. The
amputated antennae were then put into 10% aqueous
potassium hydroxide (KOH) for 10 min at room temperature to macerate the inter-segmentary membranes. Antennae from dried specimens were then put into 80% ethanol
overnight. Afterwards, we placed them in 100% ethanol
for 10 min and finally transferred them to distilled water.
Because of different viscosities of the two liquids, this
transfer resulted in an overpressure inside the antenna
that led to an elongation of the inter-segmentary membranes and eventually to a configurational change. We
recorded this change in the configuration of the antennal
segments of male specimens of 56 diplazontine species
(Table 1). To test reproducibility, we included multiple
specimens for some of the species for which enough fresh
material was available. Tests were regarded as successful if
the antennae performed a distinct movement after being
transferred to water, following the recommendations of
Steiner et al. [45]. We classified those movements as
antennal coiling that involved a specific range of segments
coiled up in a spiral-like form. We denoted spirals of 200°
to 360° as single-coils and spirals of more than 360° as
double-coils.
Reconstructing the evolution or antennal courtship

The test phylogeny employed in this study was obtained
from Klopfstein et al. (unpublished data). It is based on

Page 10 of 12

four molecular markers, two mitochondrial (cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 and NADH 1) and two nuclear (28S,
elongation factor 1-a). The phylogeny is well resolved,
with most nodes highly supported. We used the tree
with the highest likelihood as obtained from the partitioned Bayesian analysis for the maximum parsimony
(MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations, and
10’000 trees from the post-burnin Bayesian tree distribution for the MCMC methods. MP and ML reconstruction of ancestral states were conducted in Mesquite
[61], ML under the Mk1 model of evolution. Additionally, rate parameters and ancestral states at each node of
interest were reconstructed under a Bayesian approach
using the program BayesMultiStates from the BayesTraits package [62]. In the Markov-chain Monte Carlo
approaches, we applied an exponential reversible-jump
hyperprior within the interval of zero to 30 and set the
ratedev parameter, which controls the proposal of new
rate values, to 8. This resulted in an acceptance rate
between 20% and 29% in all analyses, which falls inside
the recommended range. To draw inferences about the
modes of evolution, we restricted the rate parameters to
obtain the likelihoods of different models [63]. To test
whether antennal coiling evolved as an irreversible character, we forced the rate parameters of the reversals to
zero, and restricted the most ancestral node to the ‘present’ state, following Goldberg and Igic [64]. The resulting likelihood values were then compared under the
likelihood ratio test [63]. Alternatively, the posterior distribution of the models was assessed using reversiblejump MCMC [48]. To test for correlated evolution of
tyloids and coiling behaviour in diplazontine wasps, we
used BayesDiscrete from the BayesTraits package [48]
under an independent and a dependent model of evolution. Likelihoods obtained under the two models with
50 ML attempts per tree were compared by a likelihood
ratio test. Posterior probabilities of the dependent and
independent models, and harmonic means of the likelihoods for Bayes factor comparisons, were obtained by
reverse-jump MCMC, using the above-mentioned parameter settings.
