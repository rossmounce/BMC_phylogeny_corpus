Abstract
Background: Ants use the odour of the colony to discriminate nestmates. In some species, this
odour is learned during the first days following emergence, and thus early experience has a strong
influence on nestmate discrimination. Slave-making ants are social parasites that capture brood of
other ant species to increase the worker force of their colony. After emerging in the slave-maker
nest, slave workers work as if they were in their own colony. We tested the hypothesis that early
experience allows the deception of commonly enslaved species, while non-host species use a
different mechanism, which does not involve learning.
Results: Pupae of a host species, Temnothorax unifasciatus, and a non-host species, T. parvulus, were
allowed to emerge in the presence of workers of one of two slave-maker species, Chalepoxenus
muellerianus or Myrmoxenus ravouxi. When T. unifasciatus was exposed to slave-makers for 10 days
following emergence, they were more aggressive towards their own sisters and groomed the slavemaker more. T. parvulus gave a less clear result: while workers behaved more aggressively towards
their sisters when exposed early to C. muellerianus workers, this was not the case when exposed
early to M. ravouxi workers. Moreover, T. parvulus workers allogroomed conspecific nestmates less
than T. unifasciatus. Allogrooming activity might be very important for the slave-makers because
they are tended by their slaves.
Conclusion: Our findings show that early experience influences nestmate discrimination in the ant
T. unifasciatus and can account for the successful enslavement of this species. However, the nonhost species T. parvulus is less influenced by the early environment. This might help to explain why
this species is never used by social parasites.

Background
The early stages of an animal's life constitute a critical
period during which the environment can have dramatic
and sometimes irreversible effects on adult behaviour.
The best example is imprinting, a process by which the
individual develops an irreversible reference pattern from
a stimulus present during a short period of time during its
development. Lorenz [1] was the first to conceptualize the

imprinting process and gave one of the most striking
examples: during the few minutes after hatching, young
birds developed an attachment to their parents if present,
or a parental surrogate, such as Lorenz himself. Imprinting is only a special case of the processes by which early
experience affects subsequent adult behaviour. For
instance, in monkeys and humans, Harlow & Harlow [2]
and Bowlby [3] noted the importance of attachment

during the early phase after birth for the development of
adult behaviour.

ing the early experience of T. unifasciatus and T. parvulus,
we tested and compared their discrimination capabilities.

Despite a much simpler brain structure, insects display
similarly pronounced plastic responses to the early environment. Influences of the preimaginal environment on
adult behaviour have been demonstrated as early as the
late 1930's in Drosophila [4], and were later documented
and shown to be involved in various contexts in many
other species (see review in [5]). These contexts can have
a social dimension in social insects. Some ants, for example, learn the colony odour during the early phase of
imaginal life and later use this template for recognizing
brood [6-11] and discriminating among adults [12-15].
This critical period determines who benefits from altruistic behaviours shown by worker ants, which rarely reproduce directly but rely on indirect fitness benefits via
reproduction of related individuals [16].

Results

Slave-making ants are social parasites that exploit the
labour force of other ant species. Slave-maker workers are
specialized for conducting raids, wherein they seize brood
from nearby host ant colonies and bring them back to
their own nest [17]. When they emerge, the slave ants
behave as if they were in their own colony. Among other
routine ant tasks, they rear the slave-maker brood, defend
the nest, and sometimes feed and groom the slave-maker
workers. Altruistic acts of slaves are thus directed toward
unrelated individuals. One hypothesis suggests that slave
deception is possible because slaves are captured as pupae
and learn the slave-maker colony odour after emergence
[18-20].
Myrmoxenus ravouxi and Chalepoxenus muellerianus are
among the most common slave-makers in Western
Europe. They use several related species as slaves but show
a preference for Temnothorax unifasciatus [21]. In the Mediterranean area, M. ravouxi, C. muellerianus and T. unifasciatus can be found in sympatry with T. parvulus, though T.
unifasciatus seems to prefer more arid environments. T.
parvulus has never been found as a slave, but the reason for
this is unknown. We postulated that slavery would be prevented if nestmate discrimination in T. parvulus was not
achieved through early learning of colony odour, because
slave workers emerging in the slave-maker colony would
recognize the slave-maker brood and workers as aliens.
Our study had two aims. First, we tested the hypothesis
that deception of the host T. unifasciatus ensues from early
learning of colony odour as a mechanism for nestmate
discrimination. Second, we tested the hypothesis that
early experience (within the first 10 days following emergence) affects the discrimination capabilities of T. parvulus
workers less than those of T. unifasciatus. After manipulat-

T. unifasciatus workers reared with M. ravouxi (batch A) or
C. muellerianus (batch B) were significantly more aggressive towards their unfamiliar sisters than towards the
familiar M. ravouxi or C. muellerianus workers (Table 1).
Moreover they spent significantly more time allogrooming the familiar M. ravouxi or C. muellerianus workers than
their unfamiliar sisters. Similarly, T. unifasciatus workers
reared with conspecifics (batch C) were less aggressive
towards their familiar sisters than towards the unfamiliar
M. ravouxi and C. muellerianus workers. They also spent
significantly less time allogrooming the unfamiliar M.
ravouxi or C. muellerianus workers than the familiar sisters
(Table 1).
T. parvulus workers reared with M. ravouxi (batch A) did
not show a significant difference in aggressive behaviour
or in the time spent allogrooming between their unfamiliar sisters and the familiar M. ravouxi workers (Table 1).
Conversely, T. parvulus workers reared with C. muellerianus
(batch B) were significantly more aggressive towards their
unfamiliar sisters than towards the familiar C. muellerianus workers, and they spent significantly more time allogrooming the familiar C. muellerianus workers than the
unfamiliar sisters. T. parvulus workers reared with conspecifics (batch C) were significantly less aggressive towards
their familiar sisters than towards the unfamiliar M.
ravouxi or C. muellerianus workers, but the time they spent
allogrooming the unfamiliar M. ravouxi or C. muellerianus
workers and their familiar sisters was much reduced and
did not differ significantly (Table 1).
T. unifasciatus and T. parvulus workers reared with conspecifics (batch C) did not show any significant difference in
the number of aggressive acts towards M. ravouxi (6.3 ±
3.2 and 3.4 ± 1.5 respectively, Z = 1.2, p = 0.22) or C. muellerianus (3.2 ± 1.4 and 3.2 ± 1.8 respectively, Z = 0, p =
0.99). However, T. unifasciatus workers reared with conspecifics (batch C) spent significantly more time allogrooming familiar sisters than did T. parvulus (19.3 ± 13.4
and 0.1 ± 0.1 respectively, Z = 2.6, p = 0.01).

Discussion
Our results suggest that the environment experienced by
T. unifasciatus during the first 10 days after emergence
influences nestmate discrimination, at least in our artificial laboratory conditions. Indeed, workers that were
exposed early to M. ravouxi and C. muellerianus displayed
a very aggressive behaviour towards their own sisters and
spent much time grooming the slave-makers. This suggests that the influence of the early environment could
potentially account for the fact that T. unifasciatus slaves

care for and defend the slave-makers. However, as host
workers never emerge only with slave-makers present the
mechanisms allowing enslavement could be different in
nature. The same result was obtained for T. parvulus workers that were exposed to C. muellerianus. However, when
exposed to M. ravouxi, they were not more aggressive
toward their sisters than toward the slave-maker. These
results partly confirm our hypothesis that the effect of
early experience on the discrimination capabilities is
reduced in T. parvulus when compared with T. unifasciatus
workers.
The use of tethered, but live ants to record the reaction of
test workers could have influenced their behaviour
through the performance of antennation, biting, stridulation, etc., and the emission of pheromones. Indeed, several species of social parasites are known to use repellent,
appeasement, and/or propaganda substances to usurp
host nests [22]. The occurrence of such substances in our

focal slave-maker species is likely and could have reduced
aggressiveness of test workers. Moreover, several pupae of
the test species were allowed to emerge in the glass tubes
containing slave-makers. The early experience of test
workers could then have been influenced by the other
emerging test workers. Another potential source of bias in
our results is the unequal representation of collected populations of Temnothorax in the experimental groups. The
observed differences between our T. parvulus and T. unifasciatus might be due to differences between populations
rather than species, if early experience had a smaller influence on nestmate discrimination in the Italian population. However, this possibility seems unlikely because
species differences for fundamental mechanisms (such as
the determinant of nestmate discrimination) are expected
to be unaffected by population differences. The observed
differences between the two species cannot be due to a
mere difference in aggressiveness, because their levels of
aggression towards slave-makers in the control experi-

ment were not significantly different. However the difference between their levels of allogrooming was highly
significant. A low basic level of allogrooming activity for
T. parvulus workers was probably responsible for the fact
that they did not groom their sisters more than the slavemakers in the control experiment. This makes it difficult
to test the influence of early experience on allogrooming
behaviour of T. parvulus.
Few other studies have demonstrated that early experience
with slave-maker workers or brood elicits slave-maker care
in the host species [23-25]. These studies dealt with species in the subfamily Formicinae; specifically, the slavemaker Formica sanguinea and its hosts F. fusca and F. cunicularia. Slave-making ants are known from only two subfamilies: the Formicinae and the Myrmicinae [26]. In the
only study considering Myrmicinae, Alloway and Hare
[27] showed that early learning was not necessary to
explain the acceptance of the brood of the slave-maker
Protomognathus americanus by enslaved T. longispinosus
workers. Indeed, slave-maker larvae were preferentially
accepted even when T. longispinosus workers were exposed
early to conspecific larvae. Our results confirm that early
experience can be important for successful ant enslavement in other myrmicine systems. Together, these studies
across subfamilies seem to confirm the hypothesis that
early behavioural plasticity of certain ant species has permitted or at least facilitated the evolution of slave-making
habits [28], and show that other mechanisms are possible
[27] but seem less common. This suggests that early
behavioural plasticity could be a general prerequisite for
the evolution of slave-making in ants [20]. The fact that
early experience is important for the integration of the
young slaves into the slave-maker colony might explain
why M. ravouxi and C. muellerianus do not capture adult
hosts during raids [29,30]. In fact, out of 10 genera displaying interspecific slavery, only one is known to result
in the mixing of adult slaves into the slave-maker colony
[26]: raids of the slave-making Strongylognathus commonly end in the fusion with the Tetramorium host nest
[31]. However, the fusion occurs after a prolonged fight
that often results in casualties on both sides. It is noteworthy that intraspecific colony fusion has been reported in
the genus Tetramorium as a result of territorial competition
[26].
For some slave-making species, host colony take-over by
slave-maker queens requires acceptance by adult host
workers that have had no previous exposure to slave-makers. The founding queen of many slave-making species
has to enter a host nest, be accepted by the host workers,
then kill and replace the resident queen [19]. Once the
slave-making queen manages to kill the resident queen,
the workers care for the new queen and rear her brood.
The acceptance of the new queen does not require previ-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/13

ous exposure to slave-makers because specialised behavioural and chemical strategies are involved [22]. For
example, in the genus Polyergus, the young slave-maker
queen does not bear any odour, and thus prevents the
host workers from detecting her. The slave-maker queen
then acquires the cuticular hydrocarbons of the host
queen by physical contact and the host workers accept her
as though she were there natal queen [32,33]. The founding queen of M. ravouxi enters the Temnothorax host nest,
reaches the queen, and slowly throttles her to death [34].
The chemical mechanism responsible for the acceptation
of the M. ravouxi queen by the host workers remains to be
elucidated.
Queens of other slave-making species including C. muellerianus, Harpagoxenus and Protomognathus evict all adult
ants from the host nest and keep only the host brood.
They thus rely completely on the manipulation of early
experience even during colony foundation. The life history of slave-making ants suggests that the use of adult
slaves without previous exposure to the slave-maker is
costly or involves a highly specialised strategy. Manipulation of early experience by the slave-maker appears as the
most parsimonious strategy, which reinforces the suggestion that it facilitated the evolution of slavery.
Early behavioural plasticity is a widespread mechanism in
animals and is involved in a number of host-parasite systems. However, in most cases, this mechanism is used by
the parasite to find its host. The European cuckoo is
known to rely on habitat, probably in addition to other
cues, which is learned when reared by the host [35], but it
does not seem to imprint directly on the host [36]. In parasitoid wasps, preimaginal imprinting is involved in host
selection [5]. In slave-making ants, imprinting was also
shown to influence host selection during raids and colony
foundation [37,38].
A striking result of this study was that manipulating the
early experience of T. parvulus had different consequences
depending on the slave-maker species to which it was
exposed; nestmate discrimination seemed to be influenced by C. muellerianus, but not by M. ravouxi. If T. parvulus was insensitive to experience at emergence due to a
strict genetic system of odour discrimination or an earlier
sensitive period, we would expect the same outcome for
both slave-maker species. A possible explanation is that
there is a limited set of odours that T. parvulus can learn
and/or perceive at emergence. M. ravouxi and C. muellerianus likely have different chemical profiles and T. parvulus
might be chemically more similar to C. muellerianus than
to M. ravouxi. Thus, the latter could be out of the range of
potentially learned patterns. As we show in our experiments, phylogenetically closely related ant species can display various sensitivities to the early environment. Thus,

perhaps the mechanisms of nestmate discrimination differ as well.
Nestmate discrimination has been shown to be less influenced by social environment at emergence in the ant
genus Camponotus than in the genus Formica [7]. It is
therefore interesting that no species of Camponotus is parasitized by slave-makers, while many Formica species are
hosts to slave-makers. Similarly, our results on T. parvulus,
the non-slave species, suggest that plasticity at emergence
is not the only determinant of nestmate discrimination. A
first alternative possibility is that nestmate discrimination
is determined during an earlier sensitive period. Indeed,
studies in Camponotus floridanus and Cataglyphis cursor
demonstrated the importance of larval stages for nestmate
discrimination [39,40]. As most slave-makers capture
pupae preferentially, a nestmate discrimination mechanism based on larval experience might prevent these species from being enslaved. A second possibility is that
nestmate discrimination in T. parvulus has a genetic component or is based on self-referent phenotype matching.
T. nylanderi, a species very closely related to T. parvulus, has
nestmate discrimination cues based on colony environment, and especially nest site material [41]. Even if T. parvulus can be expected to rely in part on a similar
mechanism in the field, it could not have influenced our
results because colonies were reared in identical artificial
nests. Whatever the determinant of nestmate discrimination in this species, it can be an obstacle to slavery because
at least some elements of the template involved in discrimination are established before the slaves are captured.
Moreover, T. parvulus workers do not groom their nestmates often, which could be problematic for the slavemakers because they are tended by the slaves. These characteristics might partly explain why T. parvulus has never
been found as slave. However, other factors could explain
why M. ravouxi and C. muellerianus does not enslave T.
parvulus. Social parasites in the tribe Formicoxenini are
phylogenetically closely-related to their hosts [42]. It
might be impossible for the social parasites to exploit
more distant species as hosts because they would not
share the same ecological and microhabitat requirements,
or the same communication system. Slave-maker species
could also be under selection to match the colony odour
of the host species. Coevolution occurs between slavemaking ants and their hosts [43,44] and it has been
shown that in slave-maker colonies both species have similar cuticular hydrocarbon profiles [45,46]. It might therefore be easier for the host species to learn the more similar
profile of the parasite, than for the non-host species.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/13

experimental (this study) or natural (social parasitism)
context influences nestmate discrimination. However, we
showed that the effect varies across species: it was more
pronounced in the host than in the non-host species.
Social parasitism is not evenly distributed in ants: most of
the 200 known species occur in only two subfamilies (the
Formicinae and the Myrmicinae), and in these subfamilies it is concentrated in a few genera [47]. The reasons for this distribution are still unknown and
elucidating the fine scale mechanisms involved in nestmate discrimination across taxa might help to explain the
evolution of slavery in ants.

Methods
Colonies of the two slave-maker species and of both host
species were collected in northern Italy (Lago di Garda)
and southern France (Vaison-la-Romaine and Grasse, we
found no slave-makers near Grasse) in the spring and
summer 2003. Because of a sampling bias, significantly
more T. unifasciatus originated from southern France and
more T. parvulus from northern Italy (Chi-square = 13, p =
0.022). Nests were housed in plastic boxes containing a
thick layer of plaster. The print of a microscope slide covered by a glass plate provided a nest site [48]. Colonies
were fed twice a week with frozen fruit flies and a mixture
of honey and apple. Rearing conditions were as follows:
day/night: 14 h-24°C/10 h-17°C. Genus names comply
with Bolton's new classification of Formicidae [49]. The
experiments were performed in August and September
2003.
Pupae of T. unifasciatus and T. parvulus that were close to
emergence were removed from their colonies (unparasitized) and isolated in glass tubes with either M. ravouxi
(experimental batch A), C. muellerianus (experimental
batch B) or homo-colonial (control batch C) workers.
Each glass tube contained one to three pupae (from the
same colony) and two to six adult workers. The small
numbers of slave-maker workers available precluded
larger worker/pupae ratios, but at least two adult workers
were used for each pupa. Slave-maker workers of M.
ravouxi and C. muellerianus were obtained from 20 and 27
colonies respectively. Pupae close to emergence were recognizable by pigmentation, and emergence took place
within two days of uniting pupae with their respective
conditioning workers. Amputation of the distal segments
of one leg of adult Temnothorax workers from batch C
allowed us to distinguish them unambiguously from the
newly emerged test workers. Slave-makers from batches A
and B were not subjected to this amputation. Workers
were tested 10 ± 0.3 (mean ± SE) days after emergence.

Conclusion
Early experience can have important consequences on the
behaviour of adult ant workers and consequently on their
inclusive fitness. Manipulation of early experience in an

Each test worker was introduced into a circular arena of
1.5 cm2 where another worker was tethered by a nylon
thread tied between the head and alitrunk. We were only

interested in the behaviour of the test worker, thus we
tethered the other worker to reduce the probability of
interaction. Tethered workers could, however, still emit
pheromones and engage in various other behaviours such
as antennation, biting, stridulation etc. Tests started at
least five minutes after tethering in order to let the tethered worker acclimate, but we cannot totally exclude the
influence of pheromones on the behaviour of test workers. Duration of allogrooming and number of agonistic
acts (mandibles opening, biting, stinging attempts)
towards the tethered worker were recorded over 10 minutes (from the first encounter). Each test worker from
batches A and B was tested successively against a slavemaker worker (M. ravouxi or C. muellerianus respectively)
from its glass tube (hetero-colonial and familiar) and a
worker from its colony of origin (homo-colonial and
unfamiliar). Test order was controlled. Duration of allogrooming and number of agonistic acts were compared
between the two tests using the Wilcoxon test for paired
samples. Each test worker from batch C was tested successively against a worker from its glass tube (homo-colonial
and familiar), a M. ravouxi worker, and a C. muellerianus
worker (hetero-colonial, unfamiliar). All combinations of
test order were equally represented. The test involving the
homo-colonial and familiar worker was compared to each
of the two tests involving a slave-maker worker using the
Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Moreover, the number
of agonistic acts towards the slave-makers was compared
between T. unifasciatus and T. parvulus with a Mann-Whitney test for independent samples in order to test for a difference in levels of aggression between the two species.
Differences in duration of allogrooming between the two
species were similarly tested by comparing the performances of test workers from batch C in tests involving a
homo-colonial and familiar worker. Tests were computed
with Statistica 6.
