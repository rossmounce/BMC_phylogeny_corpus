Abstract
Background: Nutrition and predation have been considered two primary agents of selection important in the
evolution of avian life history traits. The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the evolution of avian
embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus
on a single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and
Spheniscidae (penguins) exhibit marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked
to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a
key life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relative
importance of behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in the evolution of avian EDP.
Results: Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition and predation risk (i.e., clutch size, activity
pattern, and nesting habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and penguin EDP based on models
predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had
significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among birds which forage in distant offshore waters,
relative to those that foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not significantly so.
Conclusion: Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent of selection driving avian life history
diversification. Our results suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective forces in the
evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic
scales. We suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups will continue to constructively
inform the debate on evolutionary determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters.
Background
Embryonic developmental period (EDP) is an evolutionarily conservative life-history trait in birds, with 80% of
the Class-wide variation residing at the taxonomic levels
of order and family-within-order [1,2]. Such strong conservatism is to be expected, given that embryonic development is a tightly constrained process [3], and that egg
size, which has a positive relationship with EDP, is equally
conservative [1,2]. Nonetheless, EDP varies more than
threefold even among avian species with eggs of similar
size [4], indicating that this trait can and does respond

strongly to natural selection. However, accounting for
this variation remains an ongoing challenge [5-8].
All else being equal, we expect natural selection to favor
a reduction in the time taken to complete development
[9]. However, there may be fitness costs for the individual
associated with its faster development, such as decreases
in resistance to pathogens and parasites [8,10,11] or
breeding lifespan [12,13], which could counteract that
tendency. How then are the evolutionary trade-offs
resolved, and what ultimate factors play important roles?
Nutrition and predation have been considered two primary agents of selection on avian life-history traits,
including the rate of development [5,14]. However, their
roles remain somewhat poorly resolved, perhaps in part
because research has tended to focus on a single, high
taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes

[7,15-20]. Further, several basic assumptions that underlie much of the passerine research, which in general supports a primary role for predation [14], have been
questioned [15]. Here, we pose a simple question: could
the focused study of lower taxonomic-level avian groups
help clarify the relative roles of nutrition and predation in
the evolution of EDP?
Lack [5] first noted that EDP and post-EDP are positively correlated across avian species. The underlying
cause of the relationship remains obscure (e.g., pleiotropy
or independent unidirectional selection), and one can
find exceptions to the general rule [18,21]. Nonetheless,
the relationship has been demonstrated in phylogenetically-controlled analyses [2], supporting its biological relevance. Lack proposed that the correlation indicated the
existence of an evolutionary predisposition for a constant
growth trajectory, an idea also supported by Bennett and
Owens [2]. That a relatively constant rate of development
[22] is ultimately beneficial, either fast or slow depending
on critical facets of a species' ecology, is consistent with
recent studies documenting deleterious, long-term phenotypic consequences associated with irregular growth
[12]. Consequently, we can expect rapid embryonic
development to evolve more readily in species where parents can provide sufficient nutrition to support rapid
post-embryonic development. If so, then behavioural and
ecological factors that increase the rate at which parents
deliver food should lead to coevolution of a briefer EDP.
Clutch size is another factor that could affect EDP [23].
The intensity of sibling competition for food increases
with brood size, and individuals that hatch early usually
outcompete late-hatched siblings, especially if hatching is
asynchronous. Therefore, we can expect from existing
theory that a larger clutch size selects for a briefer EDP
and brood reduction as nest-mates engage in an evolutionary race to hatch first [6,18].
Like nutrition, predation also has a potentially complex
relationship with EDP. On the one hand, life-history theory suggests that long-lived species should accept an
increased risk to their offspring when countered by a
decrease in the risk to themselves. Thus, parents in longlived species should be less attentive to the nest site if that
attentiveness subjects them to the risk of being depredated. This could drive the species to slower overall
development as a result of frequent egg neglect [7] (but
see Tieleman et al. [19]). On the other hand, it is more
commonly argued that an increase in the offspring's mortality rate while in the nest could select for more rapid
development in order to minimize the period of vulnerability [5,17,24].
Among avian families, the Alcidae exhibit unusual variation in several behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked to EDP in other avian groups [25].
Throughout all species within the family, both males and

females incubate on approximately equal schedules and
there is no feeding of incubating adults by non-incubating partners. Egg mass varies by a factor of four, while
clutch size is either one or two, representing considerable
variation in relative if not absolute terms. The family further exhibits unparalleled variation in the amount of time
spent (species means of two-54 days), and post-EDP completed (zero to 80%), at the nest site before offspring
depart to sea, either alone, or accompanied by one or
both parents [1,26]. Variation in the frequency of offspring provisioning is also extreme: the auks include diurnal, nearshore-feeding species that bi-parentally deliver
ten to 15 meals per day; but also nocturnal, offshore species that bi-parentally deliver at most two meals per day
[27]. Several species even forego provisioning at the nest
site altogether as their chicks are precocial [28] and fed at
sea. Moreover, a range of nest types is used. Most auks
breed on mammal-free islands in enclosed earthen burrows, or rock crevices, where their eggs are inaccessible
to avian predators. However, some species breed in the
open, either cryptically on old-growth tree branches or in
alpine tundra, while others nest very densely and conspicuously on exposed cliff ledges. For open-nesting auks,
the nest site is vulnerable to avian predators, and in some
situations rates of predation on eggs and chicks can be so
high as to compromise population viability [29,30].
The penguins, originally conflated with some auks for
their morphological similarities (the now extinct great
auk (Pinguinus impennis) was the original bird called
penguin, from the Welsh pen gwyin, for white head [31]),
and have comparable variation in the traits under study
here. Like auks, in all penguin species, except the
emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), both sexes take
incubation shifts [32]. The lower extreme in egg mass is
found in the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) (53 g),
while the upper extreme is found in the emperor penguin
(465 g) with most other species ranging between 100 and
150 g [32]. Clutch size is also one or two eggs [32]. Incubation period ranges between one and two months, while
nestling period has some high extremes in the emperor
and king (Aptenodytes patagonicus) penguin (150 days),
with the rest of the species ranging between 49 and 90
days [32]. Like the auks, penguin nests vary from those
built in crevices or burrows, to nests in the open built out
of sticks and grass, to bare patches on the ground. Penguins also are vulnerable to avian predators, with low
breeding success in small colonies being partially attributable to depredation [33].
Given the extent of variation in that suite of ecological
and life-history traits (Table 1), it is not surprising that
EDP varies widely among auk and penguin species (27 to
64 days, or approximately zero-60% longer than predicted
from egg mass; Figure 1). Therefore, these taxa provide a
unique opportunity to assess variation in a key life-his-

influence of behavioural and ecological factors related to
nutrition and predation risk in the evolution of EDPs
within a comparative, phylogenetic framework. We test
the following specific predictions: (1) species that provision nocturnally or crepuscularly, thus only once per day,
will have longer EDPs than diurnal species; (2) species

that feed in offshore habitats far from the centrallylocated nest site will have longer EDPs than inshore species; (3) species that lay a single-egg clutch, thereby lacking sibling competition, will have longer EDPs than

for phylogeny [34] to study the regression of EDP residuals (over those predicted by egg mass) and our four
behavioural and ecological predictor variables using phylogenetic hypotheses generated from our Bayesian phylogeny
estimation.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships

During our MCMC phylogenetic inference we discarded
those trees sampled during the first 2.5 million (out of ten
million) generations, a very safe, long burn-in given the
speed of convergence. The majority rule consensus over
the full set of trees sampled after burn-in generally shows
that most genera are reconstructed as monophyletic
groups (the only exception in the consensus being the
instability of the AdÃ©lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), Figure 2) and that the topology matches the current understanding of the phylogeny of the taxa under study (e.g. see
for comparison Pereira and Baker [35], Bertelli and Giannini [36], and Baker et al. [37]), albeit with some nodal
instability for the deeper nodes, an effect caused by saturation of sites in the cytochrome b locus at this level of
divergence.

in species with two-egg clutches relative to those with
one-egg clutches [6,18]. Activity pattern and nesting habits also both significantly affected EDP, in the direction
predicted: diurnal taxa had shorter EDP, presumably due
to their higher provisioning rates, and taxa with open
nests had shorter EDP, presumably due to higher predation risk. Although the standardized coefficient for foraging habitat suggested an effect in the predicted direction
(offshore foragers seem to have longer EDP), this effect
was not significant (see Table 2 for analysis results).

Discussion
EDP in the auks and penguins tend to be longer than predicted by egg mass (Figure 1). Long developmental periods are characteristic features of the life-histories of

oceanic birds [5]. Here we have investigated the influence
of several behavioural and ecological factors, proxies for
nutrition and predation, on EDP in these taxa. Our
results support the hypothesis that surrogates related to
both nutrition and predation played important roles in
shaping the evolution of EDP within alcids and penguins.
Effect of behavioural and ecological variables on EDP

Firstly, the most important variable affecting EDP was
clutch size. As predicted, larger clutches seem to drive
the evolution of shorter EDP presumably due to an arms
race between siblings for early hatching [6,18]. Among
our taxa, most of the two-egg clutches were confined to
the penguins; it is noteworthy that in auks the two-egg
clutch is found exclusively among two clades: the guillemots, nearshore specialists that provision very frequently [38]; and the murrelets of the genus
Synthliboramphus in which parents take their two chicks
to sea, thus to the food source, within a day or two after
hatching [28].
Secondly, EDP tends to be longer in those taxa that
attend the colony nocturnally or crepuscularly rather
than diurnally. Nocturnality is thought to have evolved in
seabird groups primarily to reduce predation on adults
while visiting colonies [28,39]. From the perspective of
the offspring, nocturnal provisioning decreases the rate
of postembryonic development because it restricts the
number of energetically demanding [40] provisioning
trips that each parent makes to one per day [27]. Given
some direct or indirect mechanistic link between EDP
and post-EDP, we can expect nocturnality to be associated with slower embryonic development. In the auks,
the strong effect of nocturnality on EDP is perhaps most
clearly evident in the Aethiini and Fraterculini: in both
tribes, the basal species, including Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca
monocerata), is nocturnal, delivers at most one meal per
parent per day to the nest site [27,41], and has a very long
EDP (and post-EDP).
Thirdly, we found an association between longer EDP
and the use of enclosed, rather than open nest sites, an
association also observed in other avian groups [42]. Like
previous authors, we attribute this to the fact that offspring experience higher predation risk at open nest sites.
There are few open-nesting auk species, but among these
few, avian predators (i.e., larids and corvids) prey heavily
on murre eggs and chicks at cliff sites [43,44], as do corvids on marbled murrelet eggs and chicks at nests on tree
branches in old-growth forests [30]. Because most auks
breed on islands free of terrestrial mammals [25], and
because their fully enclosed nest sites are inaccessible to
avian predators, egg predation is rare or non-existent
under most natural conditions in burrow- and crevice-

Page 5 of 8

nesting auks [25]. On the other hand, relatively more penguins are open-nesting, and nest predation by skuas, gulls
and petrels is a common occurrence [33].
Because of the mortality risk at open-topped nest sites,
one of the two parents must always remain to guard the
offspring throughout the period of post-EDP on the colony; or, analogously, adult penguins must guard the juveniles that assemble in crÃ¨ches. That requirement for
protection reduces the maximum provisioning rate at the
nest [45]. Therefore, we might expect nesting habits to
have opposing influences on EDP due to nutrition (longer) and predation risk (shorter). That murre EDP is brief
relative to egg size for an auk (Figure 1) suggests that the
mortality risk has been a very strong selective factor. It is
interesting therefore that limits on the provisioning rate,
rather than predation risk, usually are considered the primary drivers of the evolution of the unusually brief nestling periods in alcids [26,46,47], but see Cody [48].
Finally, our results further suggest that foraging habitats (nearshore or offshore) also help shape the evolution
of auk EDP. This factor operated in the predicted direction: EDP tended to be briefer in taxa that feed in less distant, nearshore waters, which in seabirds facilitates
increased rates of provisioning and post-embryonic
growth [5,49]. However, the influence of this variable was
not statistically significant in our results.
Data quality and availability

In the present study, we have used behavioural and ecological surrogates for offspring growth and mortality (i.e.,
nutrition and predation), rather than direct measures
such as are used widely in other studies; see for example
Martin [14]. However, comprehensive vital rate estimates
are available for relatively few species [25,32], and complete measures of growth rate are lacking entirely in auk
clades in which offspring complete all (all four species of
Synthliboramphini) or most (three of four species of
Alcini) of their post-natal growth at sea. Moreover, the
quality of the information is somewhat uneven (e.g., invasive techniques are required to study hole-nesting species, some of which are highly sensitive to disturbance
[28,50]). Even within species for which a considerable
amount of reliable information is available, such as the
open-nesting murres (Uria spp.), which are widely studied throughout their range using standardized, non-invasive protocols [51], growth and mortality rates can vary
dramatically from year to year and site to site [52]. The
variation can be driven by a number of factors, including
colony size and thus intraspecific competition [53] and
oceanographic variability [54]. In sum, with the available
data it simply is not feasible to use direct estimates, especially given that sample sizes for our analyses are already
necessarily small.

Other factors

One factor we would have liked to consider directly is
adult survival rate. For example, we noted that species
with high adult survival rates might be less attentive to
their offspring, if attending the nest subjects them to an
unacceptable mortality risk [7,55]. The key prediction of
this hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation
between the amount of egg neglect and the duration of
EDP [19]. While this basic prediction is supported intraspecifically in the auks [56], the hypothesis is not tenable
applied across species. Egg neglect is rare in the two auk
clades with the longest EDPs for egg mass, the Aethiini
and the Fraterculini [25]. Neglect is also rare (albeit
slightly less so) in murrelets (Brachyramphus spp.) and
guillemots (Cepphus spp.), and all but non-existent in
murres (Uria. spp.), whose eggs would almost certainly
be taken by predators or roll away from the nest site if left
alone. In fact, egg neglect is common only in the murrelets (Synthliboramphus spp.), in which EDP is intermediate relative to egg mass. Thus, there is no simple positive
association between frequency of egg neglect and EDP,
and further, there also is no simple association between
egg neglect and the suite of predictor variables used in
our analysis.
More generally, the limited data available on adult survival rates are equivocal in relation to the idea that long
lifespan is linked to slow development, thus long EDPs
and their predictors. In the Aethiini, a reasonably well
studied clade, adult survival averages 87% Â± 4 (95% CI) in
the diurnal least auklet (Aethia pusilla) [57] and 86% Â± 2
in diurnal crested auklet (Aethia cristatella) [58]; but in
nocturnal Cassin's auklet, with the longest EDP in the
tribe, various studies document similar survival rates of
88% Â± 5 [59]; 84% Â± 4 in females and 0.75 Â± 0.03 in males
[60]; and 0.789 Â± 0.040 (SE) and 0.774 Â± 0.036 (SE) for
males and females [61]. Likewise, within the Fraterculini,
survival in the nocturnal rhinoceros auklet, with the longest EDP in the tribe, averaged 0.86 Â± 0.02 (both sexes),
lower in general than in the diurnal tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), 0.96 Â± 0.05 for females and 0.91 Â± 0.06 for
males [60]; and for diurnal, brief EDP Atlantic puffin
(Fratercula arctica) survival was 89-99% in 19/20 years,
but dropped to 81% in 1/20 years [62]. In aggregate, however, previous studies do as predicted indicate a particularly low adult survival rate relative to body mass in the
guillemots (Cepphus spp.), in which parental investment
appears to be particularly high due to their two-egg
clutch, very high provisioning rates, and fast development [63].
The question remains as to what proximate mechanisms facilitate the evolutionary responses to selection on
EDP. In the auks, eggshell porosity and EDP are negatively related, after controlling for egg size [64]. Thus, a
reduction in the EDP might be achieved in part by pro-

Page 6 of 8

viding the developing embryo with access to more oxygen
to fuel its metabolism. Maternally derived yolk hormones
also could be involved; there is some evidence that yolk
testosterone levels are higher in avian species with briefer
EDPs [65,66], but see Gill et al. [67]. However, to date
there has been no investigation of the role of yolk hormones in the evolution of auk EDPs.

Conclusion
Much current debate centers on the relative importance
of nutrition and predation in avian life-history evolution
[6,7,18]. Bennett and Owens [2] concluded that it was the
adoption of different nest types, which largely determine
predation risk, which acted as the primary catalyst for
life-history diversification in ancient avian lineages. Food
availability, they argued, was mainly involved in population regulation, rather than life-history diversification, a
view that is in contrast with Lack [5]. We found evidence
that both nutrition and predation have played roles in
shaping the evolution of EDP at the lower taxonomiclevel of the alcids and penguins. We suggest that a full
understanding of the nature of avian life-history evolution will require additional studies that focus on lowerlevel taxonomic groups, especially those, like the taxa
studied here, that exhibit marked interspecific variation
in life-history traits. Further, speciose clades for which
reliable data on key factors are available will generate
conclusions based upon more robust sample sizes and
lend stronger inference concerning the evolution of avian
life-histories drawn from comparative studies. Future
studies also could comprehensively investigate the roles
of other ultimate factors, such as extra-pair fertilization
rates [18] and parasites [8].
Methods
Phylogenetic inference

We collected nucleotide sequences for the mitochondrial
cytochrome b locus from GenBank [68] and aligned these
using BioPerl's [69] wrapper around MUSCLE [70],
obtaining a multiple sequence alignment of 1144 columns. We then used reversible jump for selection of all
prior parameters and the BayesPhylogenies program [71]
to construct a Markov chain of trees, using a general time
reversible [72] model of sequence evolution with 4 discrete gamma rate heterogeneity categories. We ran the
chain for 3 * 106 generations, sampling topologies every
30,000th generation and allowing a burn-in of 25% of the
resulting chain, i.e. omitting the first 750,000 generations.
We rooted the remaining trees on our putative outgroup,
great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus), which we then
pruned from the trees. We subsequently built a Majority
Rule consensus tree, which is the tree we used for the
remainder of the analysis.

Comparative analysis

We collected the following comparative data from the
recent literature [25,32,73]: EDP in days, egg mass in
grams, clutch size, foraging strategy (0 = inshore foraging,
1 = offshore foraging), activity pattern (0 = nocturnal or
crepuscular, 1 = diurnal) and nest type (0 = enclosed nest,
burrow, rock cracks or caves, 1 = open nests). For some of
the taxa for which we found sequence data we were
unable to locate comparative data: four penguin species
including snares (Eudyptes robustus), royal (Eudyptes
schlegeli), white-flippered (Eudyptula albosignata), and
Galapagos (Spheniscus mendiculus) penguins, in addition
to four alcids Craveri's (Synthliboramphus craveri), Kittlitz's (Brachyramphus brevirostris), long-billed (Brachyramphus marmoratus perdix) murrelet, and whiskered
auklet (Aethia pygmaea). Based on the relationship of
expected EDP = 17.18 Ã egg mass0.119 for the Charadriiformes [74] we calculated the residuals of EDP from this
slope (See Table 1).
Using our pruned consensus tree, we then analyzed the
regression of EDP residuals on the combination of clutch
size, foraging strategy, activity pattern and nest type using
the continuous maximum likelihood regression method
of the BayesTraits program [34]. The commonly-explored
Îº parameter (for stretching of long branches relative to
short branches) and Î´ parameter (overall path length
scaling) were omitted from the calculations reported
here. We did estimate the Î» parameter, which quantifies
the influence of shared ancestry on the patterns of covariance among the taxa for a given trait. This parameter is
used to test whether one of the underlying assumptions
in comparative analysis holds: that species values are not
independent for a given tree and trait. Values of Î» near 1.0
are interpreted to mean that the Brownian motion model
is a correct representation of the data.
The comparative analysis reports the standardized
coefficients (sometimes called Î²) and the standard error
for each of the independent variables. The biological
interpretation of the effect of each independent variable
on EDP follows from the sign of the coefficient, and the ttest statistic is calculated from its division by the standard
error (degrees of freedom are the number of taxa) (C.
Venditti, pers. comm.).
