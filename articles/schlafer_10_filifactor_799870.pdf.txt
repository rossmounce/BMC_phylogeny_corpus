Abstract
Background: Bacteria in periodontal pockets develop complex sessile communities that attach to the tooth
surface. These highly dynamic microfloral environments challenge both clinicians and researchers alike. The
exploration of structural organisation and bacterial interactions within these biofilms is critically important for a
thorough understanding of periodontal disease. In recent years, Filifactor alocis, a fastidious, Gram-positive,
obligately anaerobic rod was repeatedly identified in periodontal lesions using DNA-based methods. It has been
suggested to be a marker for periodontal deterioration. The present study investigated the epidemiology of
F. alocis in periodontal pockets and analysed the spatial arrangement and architectural role of the organism in in
vivo grown subgingival biofilms.
Results: A species-specific oligonucleotide probe, FIAL, was designed and evaluated. A total of 490 subgingival
plaque samples were submitted to PCR and subsequent dot blot hybridization to compare the prevalence of
F. alocis in patients suffering from generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP), chronic periodontitis (CP), and control
subjects resistant to periodontitis. Moreover, a specially designed carrier system was used to collect in vivo grown
subgingival biofilms from GAP patients. Subsequent topographic analysis was performed using fluorescence in situ
hybridization.
While the majority of patients suffering from GAP or CP harboured F. alocis, it was rarely detected in the control
group. In the examined carrier-borne biofilms the organism predominantly colonized apical parts of the pocket in
close proximity to the soft tissues and was involved in numerous structures that constitute characteristic architectural features of subgingival periodontal biofilms.
Conclusions: F. alocis is likely to make a relevant contribution to the pathogenetic structure of biofilms accounting
for periodontal inflammation and can be considered an excellent marker organism for periodontal disease.

Background
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory bacterial infection leading to destruction of periodontal ligaments and
supporting bone of the tooth. Its aetiology has been a
field of intensive research in the past decades. As periodontal pockets accommodate a multitude of bacterial
phylotypes, it is difficult to differentiate between mere
commensals and true pathogens. During the 1970’s, 80’s
and early 90’s, research focused mainly on a number of
culturable bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus)actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema

denticola that proved to be associated with the disease
[1]. Studies have determined their relative prevalences,
interactions and virulence factors [2-7]. By the end of
the 1980’s, the development of novel, culture-independent techniques allowed the identification of as-yetunculturable and fastidious organisms in patients
suffering from periodontitis and added new insight into
bacterial communities in periodontal pockets [8-10]. In
recent years, research has detected increasing numbers
of bacterial species and phylotypes in subgingival plaque
and other habitats of the human oral cavity [11-18].
There is little reason to believe that easily culturable
bacteria contribute more to the development of periodontitis than fastidious organisms. Doubt has been raised
whether the widely accepted periodontal pathogens

P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and T. forsythia are appropriate diagnostic markers to differentiate between health
and disease [19,20].
Along with these discoveries it became clear that the
mere isolation and characterization of bacteria from diseased sites is not a sufficient approach to understand
the complex pathogenesis of periodontitis. The organisms do not live in a planktonic form, but rather as a
sessile community attached to the tooth surface in a
matrix of extracellular polymers [21]. The structure and
function of these bacterial biofilms are influenced both
by bacterial interactions and host factors. Exploring the
biofilm architecture and identifying its bacterial architects are pressing goals in current periodontal research.
Filifactor alocis (ATCC 35896T) was first isolated in
1985 from the human gingival crevice as Fusobacterium
alocis [22] and later reclassified as Filifactor alocis [23].
It is a fastidious, Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic rod
that possesses trypsin-like enzymatic activity [24], as do
P. gingivalis and T. denticola [25,26]. In recent years, it
has been discovered in patients suffering from chronic
periodontitis (CP) [14,18,27,28], generalized aggressive
periodontitis (GAP) [29] and endodontic infections [30].
Recently, F. alocis was detected in elevated numbers in
CP patients with periodontal deterioration compared to
patients with a stable periodontal condition and was
therefore proposed as a potential marker for active disease [19].
The present study chose a DNA-based epidemiological
approach utilizing dot blot hybridization to investigate
the prevalence of F. alocis in subjects with GAP, CP,
and in a subject group resistant to periodontitis.
Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
was employed to analyse the spatial arrangement and
the architectural role of F. alocis in periodontal pockets.
For that purpose, a specially designed carrier system was
used to collect in vivo grown biofilms from GAP
patients [31].

Methods
Oligonucleotide probes

To detect F. alocis, a species-specific probe, FIAL (5’TCTTTGTCCACTATCGTTTTGA-3’) was designed
after comparative sequence analysis of close phylogenetic neighbours to F. alocis. To ensure specificity, the
probe sequence was compared to the sequences deposited in the Ribosomal Database Project II [32] and to all
16S rRNA entries at the EMBL and GenBank databases
(as of August 2009) employing the Husar program package (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany). The probe was
checked for its practical use in hybridization experiments with the program OLIGO (version 4.0). EUB 338,
a probe complementary to a highly conserved region of

Page 2 of 13

the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria, was used in dot blot
hybridization experiments to verify successful PCR
amplification and in FISH experiments to detect and
visualize large parts of the bacterial biofilm population
[33]. For comparative purposes, probes POGI, PRIN,
ACAC, TDEN, FUNU and B(T)AFO were employed in
dot blot experiments to detect P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and T. forsythia, respectively. These
probes have been published previously and deposited in
ProbeBase [34].
Clinical samples for dot blot hybridization

A total of 490 subgingival plaque samples from 121
patients were examined and evaluated. Samples from
GAP and CP patients were obtained from those reporting to the departments of periodontology of the Charité
- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the Dresden University of
Technology, the University of Oslo and the University
of Basel. These patients were diagnosed according to the
criteria of the 1999 International Workshop for the
Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions
[35] (see Table 1). Control samples were taken from
elderly patients of a private periodontal practice in Berlin. These subjects, aged 65 years and older, had at least
20 natural teeth and displayed only mild periodontal
disease. They had not received periodontal treatment
previously, exhibited no sites with attachment loss of
more than 2 mm or probing pocket depth (PPD) of
more than 5 mm and will be referred to as periodontitis
resistant (PR) patients in the following. Subjects suffering from chronic systemic disease were excluded from
the study as well as pregnant or breast feeding women
and patients who had received antiinflammatory or antimicrobial therapy within the past six months. Patient
demographics are presented in Table 2. Ethical approval
was given by the Ethical Committee at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. All patients signed informed consent forms. After removal of supragingival plaque the
deepest periodontal pockets available were sampled. In
GAP patients, additional samples were taken from shallow sites if present. None of the samples were taken
from the same site in one patient. Three sterile paper
points (ISO 35, Becht, Offenburg, Germany) were
inserted into the pockets, removed after 10 seconds and
placed immediately in 1 ml of reduced transport fluid
(RTF) [36] containing 25% glucose.
Dot blot hybridization

DNA extraction from the 490 collected subgingival plaque
samples, subsequent PCR amplification, preparation of dot
blot membranes and dot blot hybridization experiments to
analyse the prevalence of F. alocis were performed as

published previously [37]. The broad range bacterial primers TPU1 5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’ (corresponding to complementary positions 8-27 in the
Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene) and RTU3 5’-GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3’ (corresponding to positions 519536 in E. coli 16S rRNA) were used to amplify part of the
16S rRNA gene out of the bulk DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed successful amplification. Hybridizations
with both EUB 338 and FIAL were carried out at 54°C,
while stringency washes were performed at 58°C for EUB
338 and at 60°C for FIAL with a washing buffer containing
2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium
citrate) - 0.1% SDS for EUB 338 and 5× SSC - 0.2% SDS for
FIAL. In all experiments, PCR-amplified products obtained
from fixed cells of F. alocis, its closest cultured phylogenetic
relative Filifactor villosus (ATCC 33388T), and a panel of 43
periodontal pathogens (see Figure 1 legend) and related
bacteria were included as positive and negative controls,
respectively. After hybridization, X-ray films were exposed
for 2 to 30 hours. After stripping, all membranes were reused for further experiments.

A carrier system designed to collect biofilms grown in
vivo in periodontal pockets was used for sampling [31].
Ethics approval for subgingival sample collection was
given by the Ethical Committee at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene
(ePTFE) membranes were placed in periodontal pockets
of GAP patients for 7 to 14 days and colonized by the
subgingival bacterial flora. Strips of ePTFE measuring
3 mm in width were wrapped around and attached to
rigid plastic tips (Plast-O-Probe; Maillefer, Ballaigues,
Switzerland), which permitted the insertion of these
strips down to the bottom of the pocket, therefore
allowing the complete extension of the membrane over
the entire probing depth. One side of the double bent
strip faced the soft tissue and the other side, slightly
longer, faced the root surface. This longer cervical end
was fixed to the tooth with cyanoacrylic glue (Tesa,
Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany) to stabilize the position
of the carrier. After removal, carriers were fixed for at
least 3 h with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (pH 7.4) and embedded in cold polymerizing resin (Technovit 8100, Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany) as reported previously [38]. Sectioning into slices
of 2-3 μm was performed as previously published [39].
A total of 28 carriers from 11 GAP patients seeking
treatment at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin
were examined. These patients met the same inclusion
criteria as the GAP patients selected for dot blot hybridization and likewise signed informed consent forms.
See Table 2 for patient demographics. Additionally, a
gingival biopsy of a GAP patient obtained during periodontal surgery was processed in the same manner and
included in the FISH experiments.
FISH

Statistical analysis

Statistical evaluation of the dot blot hybridization results
was performed using the exact chi-square test. The prevalence of F. alocis in different patient groups was compared. Moreover, the presence of F. alocis in relation to

FISH experiments were performed as described previously [40] apart from using Vectashield containing
DAPI (4,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindoldihydrochlorid)
(Vector Laboratories, Orton Southgate, UK) as mounting medium. The probes were synthesized commercially

(biomers.net, Ulm, Germany). EUB 338 was 5’ endlabelled with fluorochrome Cy5 (indodicarbocyanine)
while FIAL was 5’ end-labelled with fluorochrome Cy3
(indocarbocyanine). Differential labelling allowed simultaneous hybridization with both probes.
Optimization of probe FIAL for FISH

The stringency of FIAL was adjusted by incubating fixed
cells of F. alocis and its closest cultured relative, F. villosus with different hybridization mixes. The formamide
concentrations covered a range from 0% (v/v) to 75%
(v/v), rising in steps of 5% (v/v). At each level of formamide, a series of images of each bacterial species was
taken with a fixed exposure time. The software daime
[41] was used to measure the light intensities emitted by
both species for each concentration of formamide.
While the signal intensity of F. villosus did not reach 50
Relative fluorescence Units (RU) at any level of formamide due to unspecific binding of the probe, the intensity of F. alocis remained constantly above 150 RU using
formamide concentrations of up to 20% (v/v) (see Additional file 1). In addition, fixed cells of 16 different bacterial species, most of them periodontal pathogens, were
incubated with FIAL at 20% (v/v) formamide as negative
controls, namely F. nucleatum (ATCC 25586), Eikenella
corrodens (CCUG 2138), Kingella kingae (ATCC 23330),
Veillonella parvula (ATCC 10790), Veillonella dispar
(ATCC 17748), P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 33384), Pasteurella haemolytica (ATCC 33396), T. forsythia (ATCC 43037),
Haemophilus aphrophilus (NCTC 55906) P. intermedia
(ATCC 25611), Campylobacter rectus (ATCC 33238),
Capnocytophaga sputigena (ATCC 33612), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (ATCC 33624), Eggerthella lenta
(ATCC 25559), and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
(ATCC 27337). As none of the controls were detected
by FIAL, all further experiments were performed with
20% (v/v) of formamide, including F. alocis as positive
and F. villosus as negative control.
Epifluorescence microscopy

After hybridization, carrier and biopsy sections were
analysed using an epifluorescence microscope (AxioPlan II, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 100 W
high pressure mercury lamp (HBO 103W/2, Osram,
Munich, Germany) and 10×, 40× and 100× objectives.
DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5 signals were analysed by narrow
band filter sets HQ F31-000, HQ F41-007 and HQ
F41-008, respectively (AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen,
Germany). Image acquisition was performed with an
AxioCam MRm (Zeiss) making use of the AxioVision
4.4 software.

Results
Dot blot hybridization

When carried out with the probe EUB 338 (specific for
most bacteria), dot blot hybridization experiments indicated the presence of bacteria in all 490 patient samples
as well as in the positive (F. alocis) and negative controls
(see Figure 1 legend) and thus confirmed successful PCR
amplification (Figure 1a). The Filifactor alocis-specific
probe FIAL clearly detected F. alocis, while neither the
closest phylogenetic neighbour F. villosus nor any of the
organisms in the panel of oral bacteria (see Figure 1
legend) yielded a signal, thus indicating specific hybridization conditions (Figure 1b).
Taking all the collected samples into consideration, F.
alocis could be identified in 77.8% of the 330 samples
from 72 GAP patients, 76.7% of the 78 samples from 30
CP patients and 15.8% of the 82 samples from 19 PR
patients (Table 2; Figure 2a). The prevalence of the
organism was highest in the Oslo CP collective (87.5%),
followed by the Basel GAP collective (80.0%), and the
Dresden GAP collective (77.8%) (data not shown). As
the number of samples per patient varied between the
different collectives, statistical evaluation focused on the
deepest pocket of each patient. Prevalence rates were
68.1% for the GAP group, 66.7% for the CP group and
5.3% for the PR group. While detection frequencies did
not differ significantly between GAP and CP patients,
both diseased groups harboured F. alocis significantly
more often than the PR group (p < 0.001) (Figure 2b).
The signal intensity of the FIAL-positive patient samples varied between the three groups, suggesting a
higher number of Filifactor in GAP and CP pockets
than in PR pockets tested positive for the organism.
Nonetheless, as hybridizations were carried out on PCRamplified bacterial DNA, no further analysis of signal
intensities was performed.
Detection frequencies of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia,
A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. denticola, T. forsythia,
and F. nucleatum in the three patient groups are displayed in Figure 2b.
To investigate the prevalence of F. alocis in relation to
the PPD, the donor sites were divided into four groups
(I: 1-3 mm, II: 4-6 mm, III: 7-9 mm, IV: > 9 mm). As
there is a certain degree of interdependency between
pockets belonging to the same patient, statistical analysis
was limited to one pocket per patient and probing depth
group. Although a slightly higher percentage of group
III pockets than group II pockets was positive for Filifactor in both the GAP and the CP patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, analysis
revealed no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of the organism in GAP patients compared to

CP patients in both pockets of 4-6 mm and pockets of
7-9 mm. In contrast, the prevalence of F. alocis in pockets of 4-6 mm differed significantly between both PR
and GAP patients (p < 0.001) and PR and CP patients
(p < 0.001) (Figure 2c). Insufficient numbers or complete absence of pockets of 1-3 mm in GAP and CP
patients, pockets of 7-9 mm in PR patients and pockets
deeper than 9 mm in CP and PR patients did not permit
further statistical analysis.
FISH

F. alocis was reliably detected by both the species-specific probe FIAL and the eubacterial probe EUB 338. The
negative control F. villosus was not targeted by FIAL
but only by EUB 338, thus confirming specific hybridization conditions (Figure 3). In all of the periodontal
ePTFE carriers from GAP patients as well as in the gingival biopsy gained during periodontal surgery, the bacterial biofilms could be visualized by FISH with EUB
338 and displayed characteristic features like densely-

Page 7 of 13

packed mushroom-like protuberances and signal-free
channels [42]. F. alocis could be detected in 9 out of 11
carrier patients (in 17 out of 28 carriers) as well as in
the examined gingival biopsy.
In the carrier-grown biofilms, the organism could be
visualized in those areas that had grown in the depth of
the pocket, but rarely in areas corresponding to the cervical part of the pocket and rarely on the very tip of the
carrier. In most cases, Filifactor colonized the side of
the carrier facing the soft tissue (Figure 4c) and could
only be found in few numbers or not at all on the carrier side facing the root (Figure 4b). Many parts of the
biofilm showed F. alocis as a short rod of 1-2 μm length,
whereas at some sites the organism appeared longer,
extending to 7-8 μm (Figure 5a). While in some areas
Filifactor cells seemed to be scattered within the biofilm
without any recognizable pattern, numerous sites clearly
showed a higher degree of organisation. Repeatedly,
F. alocis could be found in densely packed groups (Figure 4c), arranged in concentrical structures (Figure 5d)

Figure 3 Specificity of FISH experiments. Hybridization of fixed cells of F. alocis (a and c) and F. villosus (b and d) was performed with probes
EUB 338-Cy5 (magenta, a and b) and FIAL-Cy3 (bright orange, c and d). (a and c): Identical microscopic fields show detection of F. alocis by
both EUB 338 (a) and FIAL (c) whereas detection of F. villosus by EUB 338 only (b) and not FIAL (d) proves specificity of the FISH experiment.

or grouped in “test-tube brush” formations [43] around
signal free channels (Figure 5c). Figure 5b shows the
radial orientation of F. alocis towards the surface of a
mushroom-like protuberance of the biofilm.
Similar formations that indicate ultrastructural organisation of the biofilm could be observed in the gingival
biopsy. In several areas, F. alocis formed branch-like
structures within the affected tissue (Figure 6a) or palisades around large rodshaped bacteria (Figure 6b).
Again, Filifactor was observed among the organisms in
concentric bacterial aggregations (Figure 6c).

Figure 4 Carrier grown biofilm visualized by FISH. Hybridization
was performed with the probes EUB 338-Cy5 (magenta) and FIALCy3 (bright orange) along with DAPI staining (blue) on a carrier
after 7 days of attachment to the mesial aspect of tooth 16 in a
GAP patient. (a): Collage of several microscopic fields in low
magnification. The overlay of Cy3, Cy5 and DAPI filter sets shows
the bacterial biofilm that grew in the depth of the pocket. EUB 338
visualizes large parts of the bacterial community, while FIAL detects
only F. alocis. DAPI stains both host cell nuclei and bacteria. The

no presence of F. alocis. The bright orange signal on the carrier side

Filifactor in the part of the biofilm indicated by the arrow.

Discussion
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyse the prevalence of F. alocis in samples from both
GAP and CP patients, and subjects with apparent periodontitis resistance. The detection of the organism in
77.8% of the GAP patients and in 76.7% of those suffering from CP is convincing evidence that suggests an
involvement of F. alocis in periodontal disease. Equally
striking is the low prevalence of Filifactor in the PR
group. All of these patients had reached the age of 65
years and were in good periodontal condition without
the help of extensive therapeutic efforts. Even if a multitude of factors including oral hygiene and immune
response contributed to their periodontal status, one
would assume that frequent detection of an organism in
the GAP and CP groups along with scarce detection in
PR patients, as is the case for F. alocis, indicates pathogenic rather than commensal behaviour.
One can argue that deep periodontal pockets harbour
increased numbers of bacteria and that any organism
inevitably should be isolated more constantly from CP
patients (mean pocket depth: 7.13 mm, 1.4 mm SD) and
especially GAP patients (7.81 mm, 2.48 mm SD) than
from PR patients (3.63 mm, 0.79 mm SD). However,
dividing the entirety of the sampled sites into four
groups according to the measured PPD (I: 1-3 mm, II:
4-6 mm, III: 7-9 mm, IV: > 9 mm), statistical analysis of
pockets between 4 and 6 mm still reveals a significantly
higher prevalence of F. alocis in both the GAP and the
CP group compared to the PR group. In addition, the
organism was not detected significantly more frequently
in deeper pockets (7-9 mm) than in rather shallow
pockets (4-6 mm) in both GAP and CP patients.
Although a connection between PPD and bacterial load
cannot be denied, these findings indicate that the influence of pocket depth does not invalidate the aforementioned results.
If one compares the prevalence rate of F. alocis to
those of the widely accepted periodontal pathogens
P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans,

T. denticola, F. nucleatum, and T. forsythia (see Figure
2b), investigated in these very samples using identical
methods, Filifactor is the third most prevalent for GAP
and second most prevalent for CP patients and is thus
at eye level with organisms that are considered key
players in periodontal disease. At the same time, F. alocis shows the lowest prevalence in the PR group of all
analysed organisms. Together with F. nucleatum, F. alocis is the only organism to show a significantly higher
detection frequency in both GAP and CP patients compared to the PR group.
Using PCR-based identification methods may introduce bias, since structurally different organisms could
exhibit different copy numbers of ribosomal genes and
will generally respond differently to DNA isolation and
the chosen set of broad range bacterial primers [44].

However, the relevance of F. alocis is supported by several other epidemiological studies conducted in the past
years using DNA-based techniques. F. alocis was
detected in GAP patients as well as in CP patients with
prevalence rates varying between 45% [29] and 90%
[28], depending on the methods employed. Some
authors propose F. alocis as a marker organism for periodontal disease [28] and even for the shift from periodontal health to disease [19].
Our data strongly support the findings of these studies
and motivated the attempt to visualize F. alocis within
the periodontal biofilm of GAP patients using FISH.
The organism could be detected in high numbers in the
majority of the examined carriers. The percentage of
positive patients approximately matches the dot blot
results. Strikingly, several areas of the biofilm show

Schlafer et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/66

F. alocis in densely packed groups (Figure 4c) or as a
part of concentric bacterial agglomerations (Figure 5d) formations that suggest a certain degree of organisation
to the observer. Moreover, the organism could be visualized in structures that are considered characteristic
architectural features of periodontal biofilms. F. alocis is
among the bacteria in mushroom-like protuberances on
the surface of the biofilm (Figure 5b) and it contributes,
grouped around what might be diffusion or convection
channels, to the formation of structures reminding of
test-tube brushes (Figure 5c). The close colocalization of
F. alocis with other periodontal pathogens suggests that
Filifactor might be involved in coaggregation events that
take place during the establishment and maturation of
the biofilms and that are thought to play a crucial role
in biofilm formation [45]. Moreover, the tight colocalization might indicate necessary symbiotic relationships
that could help to explain the fastidiousness of Filifactor.
Just like group I treponemes [31], F. alocis predominantly colonizes the apical and middle third of the carriers and could only casually be detected in the cervical
third. Most interestingly, the organism preferably settles
on the side of the carrier facing the soft tissues and is
thus in immediate contact to the host’s immune
defence. All these observations point to a causal involvement of F. alocis in the formation and maintenance of
the analysed biofilms.
However, one might question whether these carrierborne biofilms accurately model the unperturbed biofilms in periodontitis patients. Wecke et al. [31] compared the bacterial load after 3 and 6 days and showed
that the biofilm mass covering the carriers increases
with time. The presence of F. alocis on only one side of
the membranes is further evidence that these samples
are not simply fragments of biofilm torn out of the
pocket during the removal of the carriers, but in fact
newly grown biofilms that form while the carriers are in
situ. Although FISH reveals structural elements specific
to periodontal biofilms, one cannot deny that the introduction of the carrier into the periodontal pocket creates an artificial environment. The barrier between root
surface and pocket epithelium might hamper access of
the immune system to the bacteria on the tooth side,
while only the biofilm growing on the soft tissue side
actually faces the host. Moreover, these biofilms do not
form on natural substrate but instead on ePTFE membranes. However, it seems likely that the substrate is of
minor importance to the biofilm development. Wecke et
al. [31] did not observe differences between biofilms
grown on different carrier materials, and it is likely that
the acquired pellicle, which covers both the root and
the membrane, renders colonization conditions on a
broad range of materials alike. This claim is supported
by microscopic examination of the biopsy submitted to

Page 11 of 13

FISH. F. alocis could be visualized in high numbers and
detected in arrangements similar to those seen in carrier-borne biofilms. Thus, a contribution of Filifactor to
the structural organisation of ‘naturally’ grown biofilms
seems highly probable.
The applied carrier system proves to be a valuable tool
for the exploration of periodontal biofilms as it allows to
investigate topographic relations within the pocket without invasive treatment. Subsequent FISH permits to
analyse the distribution and colocalization of potential
pathogens within the biofilm and can thus contribute to
a better understanding of the complex host-microbe
interactions that lead to periodontal destruction.

Conclusions
The prevalence of Filifactor alocis in both GAP and CP
patients was found to be elevated as compared to PR
control. F. alocis thus seems to be a powerful diagnostic
marker organism for periodontal disease. FISH revealed
the involvement of F. alocis in numerous structural
arrangements that point to its potential role as one of
the architects of structural organisation within periodontal biofilms. Filifactor alocis should be considered an
important periodontal pathogen and warrants further
research.
Additional file 1: Optimization of probe FIAL for FISH using the
program daime. FISH was performed incubating fixed cells of F. alocis
and F. villosus with different hybridization mixes. Signal intensities
(Relative fluorescent Units, RU) emitted by F. alocis and F. villosus at
different formamide concentrations were calculated from images taken
with a fixed exposure time. Due to unspecific binding of FIAL, the light
emission of F. villosus cells remained below 50 RU at every level of
formamide. The signal emitted by F. alocis cells was considered sufficient
using formamide concentrations of up to 20% (v/v).
