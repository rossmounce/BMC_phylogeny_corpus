Abstract
Background: Bacterial genomes differ dramatically in AT%. We have developed a model to show
that the genomic AT% in rapidly replicating bacterial species can be used as an index of the
availability of nucleotides A and T for DNA replication in cellular medium. This index is then used
to (1) study the evolution and adaptation of the bacteriophage genomic AT% in response to the
differential nucleotide availability of the host and (2) test the prediction that double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) phage should exhibit better adaptation than single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phage
because the rate of spontaneous deamination, which leads to C→T or C→U mutations depending
on whether C is methylated or not, is about 100-fold greater in ssDNA than in dsDNA.
Results: We retrieved 79 dsDNA phage and 27 ssDNA phage genomes together with their host
genomic sequences. The dsDNA phages have their genomic AT% better adapted to the host
genomic AT% than ssDNA phage. The poorer adaptation of the ssDNA phage can be partially
accounted for by the C→T(U) mutations mediated by the spontaneous deamination. For ssDNA
phage, the genomic A% is more strongly correlated with their host genomic AT% than the genomic
T%.
Conclusion: A significant fraction of variation in the genomic AT% in the dsDNA phage, and that
in the genomic A% and T% of the ssDNA phage, can be explained by the difference in selection and
mutation between them.

Background
We first present a simple model of DNA replication to
show that the genomic AT% of rapidly replicating bacterial species is indicative of the relative availability of
nucleotides A and T in the bacterial cell. By using the
genomic AT% of bacterial species as an index of AT availability, we study how bacteriophage would evolve in
response to the differential AT availability in different bacterial hosts. We expect natural selection to favour the evolution of phage genomic AT% to take advantage of the

differential AT availability in different hosts. In particular,
given that the rate of spontaneous deamination, which
results in C→T mutation (when the C is methylated or
C→U mutations (when the C is not methylated), is 100fold higher in single stranded DNA than in doublestranded DNA [1], we expect the adaptation of phage
genomic AT% to their host cellular environment to be
more disrupted by the C→T(U) mutations in singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) phage than in double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) phage.

Designate the amount of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP
available for DNA replication as VdA, VdC, VdG and VdT,
respectively. Note that these are abstract terms and may
not correspond to the cellular concentration of dNTPs or
rNTPs. Suppose a single-stranded DNA genome of length
L is composed of A, C, G, and T with frequencies NA, NC,
NG and NT, respectively (NA + NC + NG + NT = L). The
polymerization reaction is characterized as
kp

Mn • + M → Mn+1 •

(1)

where Mn• stands for an elongating (or propagating in
chemistry terminology) DNA strand with n monomer residues, M is the monomer, and kp is the propagating constant. According to the law of mass action, and assuming
that kp is the same for adding any of the four nucleotides
to the elongating chain, the elongation rate (r) during
DNA replication can be modelled as
r=

dL
= kp [VdA ]N A [VdC ]NC [VdG ]NG [VdT ]NT
dt

(2)

Bacterial species often need, and typically are selected, to
replicate rapidly. For example, E. coli in unlimited culture
conditions can replicate once every 20 minutes. It is therefore reasonable to assume natural selection to operate on
increasing r for such organisms. According to equation
(2), if VdA is the largest, then r is increased with increasing
NA and decreasing NG, NC and NT, with the constraint of
NA + NC + NG + NT = L. The maximum r is achieved when
NA = L and NC = NG = NT = 0. This means that, in order to
maximize r with differential nucleotide availability, the
genomic nucleotide usage should evolve to adapt to the
availability of nucleotide availability by maximizing the
usage of the nucleotide of the highest availability. Similar
conclusions have also been derived elsewhere on optimization at the molecular level [2].
One should note that the model above does not consider
the effect of differential depletion of the nucleotides. For
example, consider that VdA is the largest among the four at
the beginning of DNA replication. If a rapidly replicating
genome is made entirely of A, then A will be differentially
depleted leading to a reduced VdA which consequently
may become smaller than VdC, VdG and VdT. This means
that the replication of the remaining A-rich part of the
genome would be slow, thus compromising the statement
above that "The maximum r is achieved when NA = L and
NC = NG = NT = 0". However, the qualitative conclusion
that, if VdA is larger than VdC, VdG and VdT, then NA should
be larger than NG, NC and NT remains correct.
When VdC = VdG = VdA = VdT = V, then equation (2)
becomes:

r=

dL
= kV N A + NC + NG + NT = kV L
dt

( 3)

so that r is independent of NA, NC, NG, and NT. This might
be interpreted to mean that, with equal availability of the
nucleotides for DNA replication, there is no selection on
genomic nucleotide usage and genomic nucleotide frequencies can vary freely. However, the replication of a
large, rapidly elongating and AT-rich genome may differentially reduce VdC, VdG, VdA, and VdT. For example, rapid
replication of a large AT-rich genome will reduce VdA and
VdT and increase the time for adding the remaining A and
T to the elongation chain. Thus, even with VdC = VdG = VdA
= VdT = V at the beginning of the replication, we would still
expect the genomic AT% to be near 50% instead of fluctuating to extreme values.
For a double-stranded genome where NA = NT = NAT and
NC = NG = NCG, equation (2) becomes

r=

dL
= k(VdA VdT )N AT (VdC VdG )NCG
dt

(4)

If VdA*VdT >> VdC*VdG, then increasing NAT in the genome
will increase r, with the maximum r achieved when NAT =
L and NCG = 0, i.e., the genome should evolve towards ATrichness. Again, this assumes no differential depletion of
A and T and should be interpreted qualitatively to mean
that, with VdA*VdT >> VdC*VdG, we should have NAT > NCG.
If VdA*VdT = VdC*VdG, then r becomes independent of NAT
and NGC. However, this again does not necessarily mean
that there is no selection to constrain genomic AT% and
that genomic AT% can consequently vary freely. As we
have argued before, a large, rapidly replicating and AT-rich
genome will differentially reduce nucleotides A and T and
lead to VdA*VdT << VdC*VdG which is unfavourable for replicating an AT-rich genome. Thus, with VdA*VdT = VdC*VdG,
we expect the genomic AT% to be near 50% instead of
fluctuating to extreme values.
In summary, we expect an extremely GC-rich bacterial
genome to indicate high VdC*VdG, an extremely AT-rich
bacterial genome to indicate high VdA*VdT, and a bacterial
genome with GC% = 50% to indicate (VdA*VdT) ≈
(VdC*VdG).
Based on the reasoning above, we may infer that different
genomic AT% values in different bacterial species indicate
different AT availability in the cells of these bacterial species. By using the genomic AT% of bacterial species as an
index of AT availability, we now study how bacteriophage
genomic GC% evolve in response to different nucleotide
availability in different hosts.

Assuming that it is beneficial for the phage to replicate its
genome rapidly, we can make two testable predictions.
First, a phage genome should evolve to become AT-rich in
a host with a high genomic AT% (indicating VdA*VdT >>
VdC*VdG in its cell), and GC-rich in a host with a low
genomic AT% (indicating VdA*VdT << VdC*VdG in its cell).
This will lead to a positive correlation between the phage
genomic AT% and the host genomic AT%. Such a correlation has in fact been known for a long time [3]. Second,
because the rate of spontaneous deamination, which
leads to C→T or C→U mutations depending on whether
C is methylated or not, is about 100-fold higher in the
ssDNA than in dsDNA [1], we expect such mutations to
reduced the effectiveness of natural selection to optimize
the genomic AT% of the ssDNA phage in response to their
host genomic AT%. In particular, with low host AT availability, natural selection should favour the reduction of
the phage genomic AT%, but the C→T(U) mutation mediated by the spontaneous deamination in the ssDNA phage
would counteract against natural selection and increase
the genomic AT% of the ssDNA phage. In addition,
because genomic A% and T% can evolve independently in
ssDNA phage, we can specifically predict an increase in
the genomic T% in ssDNA phage without an associated
increase in the genomic A%. We will test these
predictions.

Results
The positive relationship between the phage genomic
AT% and their host genomic AT% is shown separately for
the dsDNA and ssDNA phages (Fig. 1). Such a positive
relationship itself is trivial because the relationship has
been known for nearly 40 years [3]. However, the difference between the dsDNA and ssDNA phages is scientifically significant. The regression line for the ssDNA phage
has a higher intercept and a lower slope than that for the
dsDNA phage (Fig. 1).
We can employ the general linear model (GLM) to test the
statistical difference of the two regression lines:
PhageAT = B0 +B1 • HostAT+B2 • PhageType+B3 • HostAT • PhageType+ε
= (B0 +B2 • PhageType)+(B1 +B3 • PhageType)HostAT+ε

( 5)

where PhageAT and HostAT are AT% of the phage and
host genomes, respectively, and PhageType is of two categories (i.e., dsDNA and ssDNA) coded by a binary dummy
variable with 0 for ssDNA and 1 for dsDNA. If B2 and B3
are not significantly greater than 0, then there is no significant difference between the two regression lines.
The parameters of the general model in equation (5) can
be evaluated by the GLM procedure in SAS [4], which uses
the method of least-squares to fit general linear models.
The resulting B2 is -10.156 which is statistically significant
(t = 2.83, p = 0.0028). Similarly, B3 = 0.135, t = 2.04, p =

0.0221. The other parameters are B0 = 18.503 (t = 6.08, p
< 0.0001), and B1 = 0.734 (t = 12.93, p < 0.0001)
Given the evaluated parameters in equation (5), the relationships between PhageAT and HostAT for dsDNA and
ssDNA phages are
PhageATdsDNA =(B0 +B2 )+(B1 +B3 )HostAT=8.347+0.869HostAT

(6)

PhageATssDNA =B0 +B1HostAT=18.503+0.734HostAT

The increased intercept and decreased slope in the ssDNA
phage relative to the dsDNA phage is easy to interpret in
light of the finding that the rate of spontaneous deamination, which increases the C→T(U) mutation rate, is about
100-fold higher in ssDNA than in dsDNA [1]. This spontaneous deamination features prominently among all
other factors contributing to the degradation of DNA [5].
When host genomic AT% is low (the left extreme of Fig.
1), indicating low availability of nucleotides A and T in
the cellular medium according to equations (2) and (4),
natural selection should cause the phage genome to
reduce its AT%, but the C→T(U) mutation mediated by
the high rate of spontaneous deamination in the ssDNA
phage goes against natural selection and increases phage
genomic AT%. In other words, the C→T(U) mutations
reduce the effect of the natural selection to push the phage
genomic AT% downwards. This would raise the intercept
and decrease the slope of the regression for the ssDNA
phage relative to the regression line for the dsDNA phage.
Note that the C→T(U) mutations act in the same direction as the natural selection when the host genomic AT%
is high, indicating high availability of nucleotides A and T
in the cellular medium according to equations (2) and
(4). In this case, natural selection should favour phage
genomes to become AT-rich, and the C→T(U) mutation
mediated by the high rate of spontaneous deamination in
the ssDNA phage also increases phage AT%, i.e., the two
act in the same direction. Such an interpretation is consistent with the right side of Fig. 1 in which few points are
below the regression line and with little scatter above and
below the regression line, especially when the host
genomic AT% is extremely high.
To further substantiate this interpretation, we can test
whether the increased intercept and decreased slope for
the regression line of the ssDNA phage in Fig. 1 is really
due to an increase in the genomic T% instead of the
genomic AT%. This can be done because A and T do not
need to be equal to each other in number for ssDNA. We
expect an increased genomic T% but not genomic A% in
the ssDNA phage. Such an inference is consistent with
plotting the genomic A% and T% separately for the ssDNA
phage against the host AT% (Fig. 2).

phages are plotted separately with their respective linear regression lines.

We can test the statistical significance of the difference
between the two regression lines in Fig. 2 by using the general linear model similar to the approach in equations (5)
and (6). The regression line for the genomic T% has a significantly increased intercept (P = 0.0068, one-tailed test)
and decreased slope (P = 0.0323, one-tailed test). Also, the
relationship between the phage genomic A% and the host
genomic AT% is stronger than that between the phage

genomic T% and the host genomic AT%, with the Pearson
correlation coefficient being 0.87857 for the former and
0.60249 for the latter.
The results above corroborate our interpretation that
C→T(U) mutations contribute significantly to the relationship in nucleotide frequency distribution between the
phage genome and the host genome. In particular, the

increased intercept and decreased slope for ssDNA phage
in Fig. 1 can be largely attributed to the C→T(U) mutations mediated by the spontaneous deamination.
The pattern in Fig. 2, however, can have an alternative
explanation. First, it is important to note that the host
genomic AT% is only indicative of VdA*VdT. If VdT is similar in all hosts, but VdA differs substantially among hosts,

then VdA*VdT will also differ substantially and phage
genomic AT% will consequently be selected to adapt to
the host environment of different VdA*VdT. However, for
ssDNA phages in such a scenario with the hosts differing
much in VdA but little in VdT, only the genomic A%, but
not the genomic T%, of the ssDNA phages will show a
good correlation with the host genomic AT%. This is also
consistent with the pattern in Fig. 2.

Discussion
Mutation and selection are the two sculptors of nature,
but the effect of mutation on the evolution of genomes
and proteins is only recently appreciated [6-9], notably
after the pioneering work of Sueoka [10]. The C→T(U)
mutations mediated by spontaneous deamination
[1,5,11,12], in particular, have been invoked to explain
the strand-asymmetry in nucleotide frequency distribution in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes [13-15], in the
bacterial genomes [16-18], and in coding sequences [1922]. In this paper, we have shown how the C→T(U) mutations can operate together with selection to shape the
genomic AT% of dsDNA phage and the genomic A% and
T% in ssDNA phage.
Previous studies have shown that spontaneous mutation
appears to be AT-biased in different genomes and genetic
backgrounds [23-26], and the evidence is convincing
based on the comparison between functional genes and
their pseudogene counterparts [25,26]. However, mutation alone is often insufficient to explain the observed
genetic variation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/20

scription hypothesis of codon usage states that, with the
high availability of rATP and relatively low availability of
the other three rNTPs, the transcription efficiency can be
increased by maximizing the use of A in the third codon
position of protein-coding genes.
The variation of the genomic AT% in the dsDNA phage
and the genomic A% and T% in the ssDNA phage in our
study cannot be explained by the C→T(U) mutations
alone, and we believe that the correlations shown in Figs.
1,2 are mainly the work of natural selection favouring the
AT-rich phage in AT-rich hosts and AT-poor phage in ATpoor hosts. The data from ssDNA phage helped us to conclude that it is the C→T(U) mutations, instead of ATbiased mutations, are mainly responsible for the difference between the ssDNA and dsDNA phages we observe
in Figs. 1,2. The results in this paper corroborate our previous finding [15] that spontaneous deamination has profound effect on the strand-biased nucleotide and codon
frequency distributions and on the codon-anticodon
adaptation in another kind of intracellular genomes, i.e.,
the vertebrate mitochondrial genomes.

Two different kinds of AT-richness have been documented
for mitochondrial genomes alone demanding two different explanations [2]. The first kind is represented by (1)
the insect mitochondrial genomes where most codons
end with A and T and (2) the mammalian mitochondrial
D-loop which is not transcribed and very AT-rich. Both
the D-loop and the third codon position of protein-coding genes evolve rapidly. In the insect mitochondrial
genomes, the number of A-ending codons roughly equals
the number of T-ending codons. In the D-loop, the
number of A and T are distributed roughly equally in the
two strands. This first kind of AT-richness was attributed
to AT-biased mutation [2]. The second kind of AT-richness
is represented by the coding sequences in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, where most codons in four-fold
degenerate codon families end with A but few end with T.
This cannot be explained by the mutation hypothesis
invoking AT-biased mutation because such mutations
would lead to roughly equal number of A-ending and Tending codons in four-fold degenerate codon families.

Conclusion

The large number of A-ending codons with few T-ending
codons in mammalian mitochondrial genomes prompted
the proposal of the transcription hypothesis of codon
usage [2], based on the observation that cellular concentration of ATP is much higher than that of the other three
rNTPs [Table 2.1 in [27-29], pp. 4–5]. For example, in the
exponentially proliferating chick embryo fibroblasts in
culture, the concentration of rATP, rCTP, rGTP and rUTP,
in units of (moles × 10-12 per 106 cells), is 1890, 53, 190,
and 130, respectively, in 2-hour culture, and 2390, 73,
220, and 180, respectively, in 12-hour culture. The tran-

The genomic AT% for bacterial hosts with a genomic
sequence
If the bacterial host is a particular strain of a particular species, and if the genomic sequence of that particular strain
is available, then the genomic AT% was calculated from
the genomic sequence. If the "specific_host" does not
include a specification of the strain, and if several strains
of the same bacterial species have complete genomic
sequences, then the genomic AT% of the host species is
the weighted average of these genomic sequences. This

The phage genomic AT% has evolved in response to the
availability of A and T in their host cell. In particular, the
difference in the relationship between the ssDNA phage
and dsDNA phage, can be partially explained by the difference in (1) selection operating to maximize the rate of
DNA replication and (2) the C→T(U) mutation mediated
by the high rate of spontaneous mutations in the ssDNA
phage.

Methods
We have downloaded complete bacteriophage genomes
for 79 dsDNA phages and 27 ssDNA phages in GenBank
format from NCBI [30]. Nucleotide frequencies and AT%
for each viral genome was calculated from the GenBank
sequence files. The host species of each viral genome is
taken from the "specific_host" entry in the FEATURES
table of the phage sequence file [see Additional file 1], and
the genomic AT% for the host species is calculated as
follows.

group consists of 82 cases out of the total of 118 phagehost pairs.
The genomic AT% for bacterial hosts without a genomic
sequence
Among the total of 118 phage-host pairs, 36 cases have
the bacterial host without a completely sequenced
genome. The genomic AT% of these bacterial hosts is estimated from sequences retrieved from GenBank as follows.
First, we perform an ENTREZ search of the host species
name with the limit of sequences set to "Genomic DNA/
RNA" and with the exclusion of ESTs, STSs, GSSs, and patented sequences. Second, we deleted all plasmid
sequences in the retrieved files. From the remaining
sequences, one might then compute AT% from the
retrieved sequences as the weighted average:
n

PA+T =

∑ N A +T

i

i =1

n

∑ Li

(7)

i =1

where n is the number of retrieved sequences for the host
species, NA + Ti is the number of A and T for the ith
sequence, and Li is the length of the ith sequence.
One problem with this calculation is that some genes
from the same bacterial host have been sequenced and
deposited multiple times and the resulting PA + T would
tend to be over-represented by those genes present in multiple copies. For example, among 292 DNA sequences
deposited in GenBank for Acinetobacter sp., 152 are rRNA
sequences (mostly 16S rRNA sequences), and all
sequences deposited in GenBank for Roseobacter sp. are
rRNA sequences. For this reason, we have first identified
these genes by BLASTing [31] the sequences against each
other with E-value = 0.0001 and calculated AT% by representing each set of multiply sequenced genes by the consensus sequence.
Note that this treatment may still suffer from biases. For
example, DNA sequences of extreme GC% values (e.g.,
extremely GC-poor ones) may be more difficult to obtain
than those with middle-range GC% values and are consequently underrepresented in GenBank. For this reason, we
have also chosen the longest DNA sequence for each bacterial host as a genomic sample. The two sets of AT% values, with one set calculated as the weighted average and
the other from the longest sequence in GenBank, are
highly correlated (r = 0.975). The conclusions reached in
this paper remains the same regardless of which set of the
host AT% values we use. We present here only numerical
results from representing each of these 36 bacterial hosts
without a genomic sequence by its longest GenBank

sequence. We have also performed an analysis by using
only completely sequenced genomes. The sequence
retrieval and analysis were carried out by using DAMBE
[32,33].
In a comparative study, one should not treat each bacteriophage or bacterial host as providing an independent data
point because of shared ancestry. For illustration, consider
an extreme case with two clades of bacterial hosts, with
each clade of species having close phylogenetic relationship and each infected by a clade of closely related phage
species. We would essentially have only two data points
when studying the relationship in AT% between the bacteriophage and the host, no matter how many species of
bacterial hosts or bacteriophage species we have in each
clade. Ideally, one should perform a phylogeny-based
comparison as was done before [e.g., [34,35]]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to build a phage tree because, while a
tree can be reconstructed for the bacterial species by using
universally shared genes such as rRNA sequences, there is
no such shared sequence among bacteriophage species.
However, the phage genomic AT% appears to show little
phylogenetic inertia. For example, for pairs of bacteriophage species (say A and B) in our study that share
homology in protein-coding genes (indicating phylogenetic affiliation), the similarity in AT% between A and B
is, in general, smaller than the similarity in AT% between
each of them and their respective hosts (i.e., between A
and the host of A and between B and the host of B). For
this reason, we have adopted a technically undesirable,
but approximately true, assumption of little phylogenetic
inertia in bacteriophage AT%, with a caution for the
reader that the probabilities associated with significance
tests may not be exact. This assumption is somewhat justifiable based on the recent documentation of the lack of
phylogenetic inertia in GC% (or AT%) of bacterial
genomes [6]. If there is little phylogenetic inertia in bacterial genomes, then there should be even less phylogenetic
inertia in the phage genomes because the latter evolve
much faster than the former.
