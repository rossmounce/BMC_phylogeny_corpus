The mitochondrial genome of the ascalaphid
owlfly Libelloides macaronius and comparative
evolutionary mitochondriomics of neuropterid
insects
Enrico Negrisolo*, Massimiliano Babbucci and Tomaso Patarnello

Abstract
Background: The insect order Neuroptera encompasses more than 5,700 described species. To date, only three
neuropteran mitochondrial genomes have been fully and one partly sequenced. Current knowledge on
neuropteran mitochondrial genomes is limited, and new data are strongly required. In the present work, the
mitochondrial genome of the ascalaphid owlfly Libelloides macaronius is described and compared with the known
neuropterid mitochondrial genomes: Megaloptera, Neuroptera and Raphidioptera. These analyses are further
extended to other endopterygotan orders.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of L. macaronius is a circular molecule 15,890 bp long. It includes the entire
set of 37 genes usually present in animal mitochondrial genomes. The gene order of this newly sequenced
genome is unique among Neuroptera and differs from the ancestral type of insects in the translocation of trnC.
The L. macaronius genome shows the lowest A+T content (74.50%) among known neuropterid genomes. Proteincoding genes possess the typical mitochondrial start codons, except for cox1, which has an unusual ACG.
Comparisons among endopterygotan mitochondrial genomes showed that A+T content and AT/GC-skews exhibit
a broad range of variation among 84 analyzed taxa. Comparative analyses showed that neuropterid mitochondrial
protein-coding genes experienced complex evolutionary histories, involving features ranging from codon usage to
rate of substitution, that make them potential markers for population genetics/phylogenetics studies at different
taxonomic ranks. The 22 tRNAs show variable substitution patterns in Neuropterida, with higher sequence
conservation in genes located on the a strand. Inferred secondary structures for neuropterid rrnS and rrnL genes
largely agree with those known for other insects. For the first time, a model is provided for domain I of an insect
rrnL. The control region in Neuropterida, as in other insects, is fast-evolving genomic region, characterized by ATrich motifs.
Conclusions: The new genome shares many features with known neuropteran genomes but differs in its low A+T
content. Comparative analysis of neuropterid mitochondrial genes showed that they experienced distinct
evolutionary patterns. Both tRNA families and ribosomal RNAs show composite substitution pathways. The
neuropterid mitochondrial genome is characterized by a complex evolutionary history.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationships among holometabolous

several distinct gene orders differing from the insect ancestral gene
order. In the case of Diptera, only the family Culicidae has a gene
order different from the ancestral arrangement. In the case of
Coleoptera the gene order change is restricted to Mordella atrata
[14]. Genes coded on the a strand (clockwise orientation) are light/
deep-green. Genes coded on the b strand (counterclockwise
orientation) are red or orange. Alternation of colors was applied for
clarity. Gene names are the standard abbreviations used in this
paper; tRNA genes are indicated by the single-letter IUPAC-IUB
abbreviation for their corresponding amino acid in the figure. On
the branch leading to the relative holometabolous order, the
genomic change characterizing the gene order is shown. In case of
multiple gene orders within a single order, the changes were not
depicted to avoid overcrowding.

Background
Insect mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) are usually a
double-strand circular molecule containing 13 proteincoding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 2
ribosomal RNAs, i.e., the small and large subunits [1]. A
notable exception is represented by the mtDNA of the
human body louse Pediculus humanus, which consists
of 18 miniature circular chromosomes containing one to
three genes [2]. Insect mtDNA size is typically in the
range of 14 to 20 kbp, but genomes exceeding these
values are known [3]. In these latter cases, the size
increase is connected to the expansion of the main noncoding region, named the AT-rich or control region [3].
The gene order is a feature of mtDNA that can provide
important evidence to establish evolutionary relationships among taxa at high and/or low taxonomic levels
[4,5]. The most widespread gene order in insect
mtDNAs is shown in Figure 1. This gene order, initially
determined for Drosophila yakuba mtDNA, is considered ancestral for the entire class Insecta [5-7]. Several
gene orders departing from the ancestral arrangement
exist and can be restricted to single species as in the
strepsipteran Mengenilla australiensis or common to
whole groups of higher taxonomic rank, ranging from
family (e.g., Culicidae) to order (e.g., Lepidoptera) (Figure 1) [8-12]. In the latter cases, the peculiar gene order
becomes an important marker to delimit taxonomic
boundaries and constitutes a major signature of
mtDNA. To date, full-length mtDNAs in insects have
been sequenced in an imbalanced manner, with whole
orders still lacking any published information or being
poorly represented in data banks. In this respect, the
neuropterid orders Megaloptera, Neuroptera (also
named Planipennia), and Raphidioptera are underrepresented taxa. Only recently have sequences become available for these taxa [13-15]. Currently, full-length
mtDNAs are known for the megalopterans Corydalus
cornutus and Protohermes concolorus, both members of
the Corydalidae family, and Sialis hamata, of the Sialidae [13-15]. Three mtDNAs are available for the neuropterans Ascaloptynx appendiculatus (Ascalaphidae),
Ditaxis latistyla (Mantispidae), and Polystoechotes punctatus (Polystoechotidae) [13,14]. A complete mtDNA
sequence exists for the raphidiopteran Mongoloraphidia
harmandi (Raphidiidae) [14]. Finally, partial mtDNA
sequences are available for the neuropteran Myrmelon
immaculatus (Myrmelontidae) and the raphidiopteran
Agulla sp. (Raphidiidae) [13].
Here we determined the complete mtDNA sequence of
the ascalaphid owlfly Libelloides macaronius (Scopoli,
1763) (Neuroptera, Ascalaphidae). The newly determined

genome was compared with available neuropterid
mtDNAs (complete and partial) as well as with genomes
obtained from other holometabolous insects (Table 1)
[6,9-52]. The analyses were performed following a comparative and evolutionary perspective.

Figure 2 Structure of the mitochondrial genome of L. macaronius. Genes are depicted as described in the legend of Figure 1. Intergenic
spacers were marked with yellow/light-blue dots. Only spacers > 15 bp are labeled s1-s3. The genomic features are described in the table on
the right. Start, first position along a strand; end, last position along a strand; size, size of the sequence; inc, intergenic nucleotides; fcd, first
codon; scd, stop codon. Incomplete stop codons are written in parentheses. Negative inc values refer to overlapping nucleotides for genes
located on the same or different strands.

and 14 non-coding portions. Three of these spanning at
least 15 bp are labeled as intergenic spacers (s1-s3) in
Figure 2.
Atp8 and atp6 are the only genes, located on the same
strand, that overlap. The atp8-atp6 partial superimposition is a common feature of neuropterid mtDNAs and,
in general, of animal mtDNAs [1,13,15]. Other genes
located on the same strand (both a and b) are contiguous (e.g., nad4L and nad4) or separated by a few
nucleotides (e.g., nad3 and trnA). Genes on opposite
strands overlap (e.g., nad2 and trnC), are contiguous (e.
g., trnQ and trnM), or are separated by some nucleotides (e.g., trnT and trnP) or intergenic spacers (e.g.,
trnS2 and nad1) (Figure 2). Similar patterns can be
observed in other neuropterid mtDNAs. It must be
noted that nad4L and nad4 are contiguous in A. appendiculatus and L. macaronius (both members of the
family Ascalaphidae). Conversely, in all other sequenced
neuropterid mtDNAs, nad4L and nad4 overlap by 7 bp
[13,15].
The gene order of L. macaronius mtDNA differs from
the insect ancestral gene order in the translocation of
trnC, which is located upstream of trnW in contrast to its

traditional location downstream of trnW (Figures 1, 2).
This translocation is shared by and exclusive to all neuropteran mtDNAs that are fully or partly sequenced to
date. Conversely, Megaloptera and Raphidioptera exhibit
the typical insect ancestral gene order as shown in Figure
1[13,15]. This figure presents the distribution of various
gene orders in holometabolous insects, mapped on the
tree obtained by Wiegmann et al. [53], but alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses exist ([e.g., [54]]).
According to Aspöck et al., Neuroptera includes three
major groups, Hemerobiiformia, Myrmelontiformia and
Nevrorthiformia [55]. The first two taxa are sister
groups and encompass most neuropteran species, while
Nevrorthiformia includes the single small family Nevrorthidae, which represents an early branching-off taxon
within Neuroptera [55,56]. This view has been challenged by Winterton et al., who favor a paraphyletic
Hemerobiiformia with respect to Myrmelontiformia and
identifies the Coniopterygidae (Hemerobiiformia) family
as the sister taxon of all other Neuroptera [57]. Irrespective to the arrangement of internal taxa, all studies
strongly support a monophyletic Neuroptera order
[55-57].

Negrisolo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/221

Available neuropteran mtDNAs, fully or partly
sequenced, have been obtained from species belonging
to distinct phyletic lines within Neuroptera. Indeed D.
latistyla and P. punctatus belong to the divergent
hemerobiiform families Mantispidae and Polystoechotidae, while M. immaculatus (Myrmelontidae), and A.
appendiculatus + L. macaronius (Ascalaphidae) are
members of two myrmelontiform families [13,14], present paper]. The known distribution of trnC translocations was mapped (data not shown) based on the recent
phylogeny of Neuropterida produced by Winterton et
al., which also contains estimations of the divergence
times of major phyletic lineages [57]. It appears that
such genomic re-arrangement occurred at minimum
238 million years ago. The estimation could be further
extended back to 294 million years if this genomic
change is confirmed for the whole order Neuroptera.
Further work is needed to establish whether the trnC
translocation represents a strong molecular signature for
the entire Neuroptera clade.
Within Endopterygota, the translocation of trnM characterizes all lepidopteran species sequenced to date and
seems to be a strong molecular mitochondrial signature
for the whole order (Figure 1) (e.g., [11,12]). At the
family level, the mosquitoes (family Culicidae) are characterized by the trnR-trnA arrangement instead of the
traditional trnA-trnR (Figure 1) [9,10]. Several other rearrangements are known for endopterygote mtDNAs
but are restricted to single species (e.g., Xenos vesparum) or not consistent within broad taxonomic
groups (e.g., Hymenoptera) [37,39,58-63]. The insect
ancestral gene order remains the most widespread
arrangement among holometabolous (Figure 1) and heterometabolous insects, suggesting that the gene order
cannot play a pivotal role in resolving the relationships
at the interordinal level among pterygote insects [7].
Conversely, mtDNA re-arrangements represent strong
potential signatures to define taxa at the order and
lower taxonomic levels (i.e., family, genus and lower)
[9-14,39], present paper].
Base composition and AT- and GC-skews in the
mitochondrial genomes of endopterygote insects

The nucleotide-compositional behavior of mitochondrial
genomes is usually investigated through the calculation
of the three parameters: AT-skew, GC-skew, and A+T
content (AT%), expressed in percentages (e.g., [8,12]).
Here these parameters were studied for 84 complete
endopterygotan mtDNAs (Table 2; Additional file 1,
Table S1) and combined, for the first time, in a single
three-dimensional scatter-plot analysis (Figure 3).
Arbitrary partitioning schemes, further detailed below,
were applied to the estimated values to facilitate the
presentation/discussion of the results. Each empirical

Page 5 of 26

clustering scheme was defined in order to maximize the
appreciation of the uneven distribution of various
mtDNAs within the continuum of variation of the considered parameter.
A+T content

The range of variation of AT% spanned from 66.99 to
87.41, with the average value equal to 77.77. Different
mtDNAs exhibited an uneven distribution within this
range. Five principal clusters (A1-A5) were obtained
that divided the whole range of AT% into intervals
encompassing 5% of the variation.
The majority (61/84) of endopterygote mtDNAs exhibited an AT% in the range of 74-82 (A2 partially; A3; A4
partially), with a strong concentration in the interval 7580 (43/84) (A3). Most of neuropterids were included in
cluster A3, while L. macaronius and C. cornutus belonged
to cluster A2. The mtDNA of M. harmandi was comprised in cluster A4. Very high AT% (>84) contents (A4
partially; A5) were characteristic of and limited to a few
hymenopterans and dipterans. Conversely, low AT%s (<
70) were restricted to coleopterans (A1).
AT-skews

The average AT-skew was 0.039, while the whole range
of variation extended from -0.047 to 0.248. The endopterygote mtDNAs were grouped into six clusters (B1B6) through the partitioning of the whole range of ATskews in intervals spanning 0.050.
The majority of mtDNAs exhibited a positive AT-skew
(71/84) with two peaks, in the intervals 0.000-0.050 (44/
84; B2) and 0.050-0.100 (16/84; B3). In cluster B2 were
placed the mtDNAs of C. cornutus, S. hamata, D. biseriata and M. harmandi. The cluster B3 contained also the
mtDNAs of A. appendiculatus and L. macaronius. Only
some coleopteran mtDNAs exceed values of 0.100 (B4B6), and the skews were higher than 0.200 solely in C.
fulgidissima and T. bruchi; (B6). Negative AT-skews (13/
84) were modest (>-0.005; B1), and lepidopteran taxa
predominated in this group. The mtDNAs of P. punctatus and P. concolorus exhibited negative AT-skews.
GC-skews

The average GC-skew value was -0.213, and all 84
mtDNAs displayed negative skews. The whole set of
genomes was grouped into six clusters (C1-C6), each
spanning 0.050 of the range of GC-skew variation.
The majority of the GC-skews were located within the
range -0.30/-0.15 (68/84; C3-C5), with two peaks represented by clusters C4 (30 genomes) and C5 (24
mtDNA). The neuropterids C. cornutus and P. concolorus were included in C3, M. harmandi and A. appendiculatus in C4, while D. biseriata, L. macaronius, S.
hamata, and P. punctatus were inserted in cluster C5.
Overall comparison

When the three variables analyzed above were considered together, some patterns emerged. Even if the

Figure 3 Three-dimensional scatter-plot of the AT-, GC-skew and A+T% in endopterygote insects. Values calculated on the a strand of
full-length mtDNA genomes. Species with a placement that is difficult to identify in the main plot are depicted in the frame. Taxa are
numbered as in Table 2.

parameter distribution followed a continuum range of
variation, most of the sequenced endopterygote
mtDNAs exhibited A+T contents in the range 70%-80%,
with the highest density in the interval 75%-80%; ATskews in the range 0.003-0.010; and GC-skews in the
interval -0.300-0.150. This behavior can be represented
by the cluster formula: A2/A3,B2/B3,C3-C5. Most neuropterid mtDNAs are included in this formula, with the
exceptions of P. punctatus and P. concolorus (B1).
While no genome exhibited extreme values for any of
the three parameters, some mtDNAs markedly departed
from the most represented ranges for the behavior of
one or two parameters. Very low AT content was
coupled with high AT-skew in some coleopteran
mtDNAs. Very high A+T contents (>84%) were
restricted to a small group of hymenopterans and dipterans. Highly negative GC-skews (< -0.300) were found
mostly in hymenopterans, plus the moth O. lunifer and
the beetle T. castaneum.
The comparisons performed at the intra-ordinal level
showed that in several cases the extremes of the ranges
of variation of the analyzed parameters were occupied
by the same mtDNAs. This behavior could be the result
of limited taxon sampling. Thus, further data are

necessary to verify if the observed patterns are consistent over a broader taxon sampling.
Generally, the A+T content, AT-skew, and GC-skew
exhibited complex behaviors that do not appear to be
tightly linked, at least at the order level.
Start/stop codons in neuropterid PCGs

The inferred start/stop codons for neuropterid PCGs are
listed in Table 3. ATN, GTG, TTG, and GTT are
accepted canonical mitochondrial start codons for invertebrate mtDNs and most of PCGs exhibited these start
codons [64].
The cox1 start codon for L. macaronius was inferred
to be the triplet ACG, a non-canonical start codon for
mtDNA genes. Despite the fact that cox1 is one of more
conserved mitochondrial genes, the identification of its
start codon has been problematic (see [13]). An ATC
codon located 27 bp upstream of ACG, within the trnY
gene that is encoded on the b strand, could be a start
codon for L. macaronius cox1. However, amino acid
sequence comparison with a broad selection of endopterygote insects led us to the more probable conclusion
that the ACG triplet was the start codon for L. macaronius cox1. An ACG start codon for cox1 has also been

proposed for M. immaculatus [13]. The non-canonical
start codons TTA and TCG have previously been
inferred for cox1 in A. appendiculatus and P. punctatus
[13]. The remaining neuropterid cox1 genes exhibited
an ATT start codon. Non-canonical start codons in
cox1 have been inferred repeatedly for endopterygote
insects (e.g., [12,65,66]).
Stop codons for the 13 neuropterid PCGs were almost
invariably complete (TAA) or incomplete TAa/Taa. The
only exception was observed in nad1, where the two
ascalaphids L. macaronius and A. appendiculatus and P.
punctatus exhibited TAG as stop codon.
Codon usage and amino acids abundance

All analyzed neuropterid mtDNAs use the standard
invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. This result was
determined using the server GenDecoder [67,68]. The
behavior of codon families in PCGs was investigated
and the results are presented in Figures 4, 5. First
codons, as well as stop codons, complete and incomplete, were excluded from the analysis to avoid biases
due to unusual putative start codons and incomplete
stop codons. The abundance of codon families and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) were calculated
together with the other statistics listed below.

The A+T content, AT-skew, G+C content and GCskew, which were calculated in pooled-a + b, pooled-a
and pooled-b PCGs, exhibited behaviors identical, similar to or contrasting with those observed for the whole
genomes (see Additional file 2, Table S2).
The total number of codons was different in analyzed
species (Figure 4; Additional file 2, Table S2). The
codon families exhibiting more than 50 codons per
thousand cds varied (7-9) and the majority of them
were two-fold degenerate in codon usage and AT-rich.
In almost all mtDNAs, the four most represented codon
families were Leu2, Ile, Phe and Met with Leu2 being
the most common. The only exception was P. punctatus, in which Ser2 was the fourth most abundant codon

amino acids, and their sum varied from 42.75% (L.
macaronius) to 46.62% (M. harmandi) of the total number of amino acids.
Four-fold degenerate codon usage was A/T biased in
the third position, and T was the preferred nucleotide,
except in the Arg, Gly and Ser1 codon families, where A
was the most common nucleotide in the third position.
Two-fold degenerate codon usage showed a similarly
biased pattern, with A/T favored over G/C in the third

with the AT-biased content exhibited by pooled-a+b
PCGs.
In pooled-a PCGs, the four-fold degenerate codon
usage followed a pattern similar to that of the whole
PCG set, with the exceptions of Ala, Pro and Val codon
families (Figure 5 vs. Additional file 3, Figure S1).

In the pooled-b PCGs, the four-fold degenerate codon
usage partly mirrored the pattern observed for pooled-a
+b PCGs. Among the discrepancies, the loss of synonymous GC-rich codons was the easiest to detect (Figure

GC-rich. Codon usage could not be directly linked to
total number of codons nor to A+T content (Figure 5;
Additional file 2, Table S2). The reduction in codon
usage could be possibly linked to AT/GC-skews. Indeed,
P. punctatus, which used the smallest number of
codons, also exhibited the most negative AT-skewa+b
and the highest GC-skew a+b . The number of used

codons decreased when PCGs encoded on a single
strand were analyzed (Additional file 2, Table S2; Additional file 3, Figure S1; Additional file 4, Figure S2). The
pattern observed for pooled-a+b PCGs was mostly mirrored by pooled-a PCGs. On the b strand, codon reductions appeared to be species specific. The lost codons
belonged to GC-rich and comparatively A-rich codonfamilies. Finally, on the b strand, the pattern of codon

mtDNA [69]. The abundance of Cys residues in neuropterid NADHs, and in general in endopterygotes, appears
to agree with findings derived from primates. Several
marked departures from oavg-ratioa/b can be explained
in terms of structural/functional requirements of single
polypeptides and are not explored here.
A compositional bias effect was evident in the behavior of Leu1 (CTN) and Leu2 (TTR) codon families. As
mentioned above, Leu was the most abundant amino
acid in the PCGs. The pooled superfamily Leu = Leu1 +
Leu2 exhibited an avg-ratioa/b = 1.28 ± 0.11. This result
supports a moderate b strand bias in the distribution of
Leu. However, Leu1 and Leu2 codon families exhibited
an opposite bias in term of strand distribution. These
strand biases can be linked to the AT-skew and GC
content shown by pooled-a and pooled-b PCGs.

Different parameters have been used to evaluate the performance of mitochondrial single/combined PCGs for
phylogenetic, population genetics, and taxon molecular
identification purposes (e.g., [11,12]). The suitability of
different PCGs is linked to, influenced by the evolutionary history of each molecular marker. The calculation of
p-distance values has been used to test the level of
divergence within each PCG (e.g., [11]). Recently, codon
usage has also been investigated to study the differentiation of mitochondrial PCGs [12]. In the present paper,
the evolutionary behavior of PCGs, at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, was studied in a combined
analysis based on the calculation/estimation of p-distances, effective number of codon usage (ENC), phylogenetic signal and the saturation of the substitution
process present in single/combined PCGs.
The percent of fully resolved quartets (%FRQ),
obtained in a maximum likelihood mapping analysis,
was used as a measure of phylogenetic signal [70]. The
saturation of the substitution process was established by
calculating the m-slope of the regression line passing
through the origin in a scatter plot analysis of p-distances vs. GTR+I+G - mtREV24/JTT + G distances (see
Methods for further details).
Parameters were estimated for pooled-a+b, pooled-a,
pooled-b, and single PCGs at both the nucleotide and
amino acid levels, with the exception of atp8. This gene
was not analyzed individually because it contains a limited number of codons (< 55) to provide reliable estimations of ENC [71]. Conversely, atp8 was included in the
pooled-a+b/-a sets. The results of the global analysis
are summarized in Figure 6 and Table 5.
As a general rule, proteins, individually or pooled,
exhibited levels of saturation of the substitution process
lower than those observed in the nucleotidic counterparts. This result can be explained in terms of the

Oavg, overall (o) average(avg) ratioa/b; avg-ratioa/b, average-ratioa/b; STD,
standard deviation

loss appeared to be linked to the single/combined effects
of GC content and AT-/GC-skews.
The total number of a-codons vs. the total number of
b-codons (ratio a/b ) was calculated for every species
(Table 4). The overall (o) average (avg) ratioa/b (1.59 ±
4 × 10-3) was used as a measure to identify possible distributional biases of different codon families. Several
codon families exhibited ratioa/b values close to oavgratioa/b, suggesting that their distribution is not markedly diverse in the PCGs coded on different strands.
Codon families His, Leu1, Pro, and Thr exhibited ratioa/
b values strongly biased toward the a strand. Conversely,
codon families Cys, Leu2 and Ser1 presented ratio a/b
values clearly b strand-oriented.
The most obvious bias was due to structural/functional requirements of PCGs. This point is well represented by the distribution of Cys codon family. Cys was
the rarest amino acid in mtDNA proteins and was more
abundant in polypeptides (NADH subunits) encoded on
the b strand than in the proteins encoded on the a
strand. The Cys residues can produce intra- and interchain disulfide bridges (S-S) that play a fundamental
structural role. Disulfide bonds and interactions between
pairs of Cys residues have been postulated to have an
important structural role in NADH subunits of primate

substitution process, which permits more alternatives in
the amino acid replacements. The m-slope values show
that all PCGs/proteins experienced some degree of
saturation of the substitution process. This phenomenon
was particularly marked at the third codon positions of
some PCGs, where the GTR+I+G-distance values largely
exceeded 1 (data not shown), a result strongly supporting
a complete saturation of the substitution process [72].

Pooled-a+b PCGs/proteins and pooled-a PCGs/proteins showed the best phylogenetic signals and clearly
surpassed pooled-b PCGs/proteins. Because pooled-a+b
and pooled-a proteins also exhibited a less pronounced
saturation of the substitution process than their nucleotide counterparts, they represented the first choice as
markers to investigate the phylogenetic relationships
among Neuropterida at the inter-order taxonomic level.

plot analysis of p-distances vs. GTR+I+G - mtREV24/JTT + G + G distances
distances; avg-pd, average p-distance; avg-ENC, average-ENC (effective
number of codon usage); n.a., not applicable calculation.

The single genes exhibiting the best phylogenetic signals at the inter-order taxonomic level were cob, cox1
and cox3 (%FRQ> 94.00). Intermediate values were
observed in atp6, cox2, nad4, nad5 and nad1 (89.00 < %
FRQ > 75.00) The lowest signals were present in nad2,
nad3, nad4L and nad6 (%FRQ < 70.00).
Pooled and single PCGs having the best phylogenetic
signals usually exhibited a combination of high avgENCs, small avg-pds, and high m-slopes in their protein
counterparts (e.g., cox1), but exceptions occurred. Conversely, PCGs with low phylogenetic signals usually
showed high avg-pds and low values of m-slope at both
the nucleotide and amino acid levels (e.g., nad2).

Reduction of phylogenetic signal with respect to the
best-performing PCGs can be explained in terms of
three different processes/properties: a) accelerated evolution; b) retarded evolution; and c) possession of an
intrinsically lower phylogenetic signal.
A marked accelerated evolution mechanism can be
invoked for nad2, nad3 and nad6. These PCGs showed
avg-pds, at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels,
which were clearly higher than those observed in cox1,
cox3 and cob. Furthermore, their m-slope values favored
the occurrence of a more pronounced saturation of the
substitution process, a finding corroborated by the lowest values of fully resolved quartets. All of these results
are compatible only with an acceleration of the substitution process. Thus, nad2, nad3 and nad6 should be
excellent markers for studies performed at medium/very
low taxonomic levels (i.e., family, genus, species).
The mechanism of accelerated evolution, but less pronounced than that described above, can be invoked also
for atp6, nad5 and nad4. These genes showed avg-pds
higher than cox1, cox3 and cob, at both the nucleotide
and amino acid levels. They exhibited phylogenetic signals higher than nad2, nad3 and nad6 but lower than
the best-performing PCGs. Finally, their m-slope values
were comparable to those of cox1, cox3 and cob. All
these findings suggest that atp6, nad5 and nad4 evolved
slightly faster than the best-performing PCGs and that
these genes can be optimally used at the order or lower
taxonomic levels.
The nad1 and cox2 genes had avg-pds similar to or
even smaller than cox1, cox3 and cob, while their levels
of saturation of the substitution process appeared to be
less marked than PCGs exhibiting the highest %FRQ
values. These results suggest that the reduction of phylogenetic signal in cox2 and nad1 was probably due to a
slower rate of divergence of these two genes in comparison with cox1, cox3 and cob. Thus, they should be considered favored markers at high/very high taxonomic
ranks.
The behavior of nad4L provided contradictory evidence. The low %FRQ and relatively high avg-pd value
suggested that this is a fast evolving gene and that the
loss of phylogenetic signal was due to an accelerated
rate of multiple substitutions. However, the m-value was
the highest obtained in the analysis and did not favor a
strong saturation of the substitution process in the evolution of this gene. Thus, it could be that even evolving
in a way not dissimilar to cox1, cox3 and cob, nad4L has
an intrinsically lower phylogenetic signal due to its
reduced size.
Taken together, these data indicate that the 13 PCGs
encoded by mtDNA exhibit complex evolutionary trajectories that can be investigated using the combination of

Figure 8 Secondary structure of tRNA families (trnL2-trnV) in neuropterid mtDNAs. The nucleotide substitution pattern for each tRNA
family was modeled using as reference the structure determined for L. macaronius.

the parameters considered above. No single parameter
seems able to fully describe the behavior of PCGs.
Comparison of tRNA structure in neuropterid genomes

The mtDNA of L. macaronius contained all 22 tRNAs
genes found in other neuropterid mtDNAs and typical
of animal mitochondrial genomes [1]. All neuropterid
mtDNAs had 14 a-strand tRNAs and 8 b-strand tRNAs
(Figures 1, 2). Among the 22 tRNAs, only trnS1 did not
exhibit the common cloverleaf structure, due to the
absence of DHU stem. Loss of this stem in trnS1 is a
feature common to many insect mtDNAs (e.g., [12]).
The results of comparative analyses on secondary structures of neuropterid tRNAs are provided in Figures 7, 8.
Multiple alignments of tRNAs genes were produced,
and the percent of identical nucleotides (%INUC) was
calculated for each group of orthologous sequences
(Additional file 5, Table S3).
The pattern of nucleotide conservation was markedly
a strand-biased. Indeed, trnG, trnK, trnN, trnM and
trnE, which showed the highest levels of nucleotide conservation (%INUC ≥ 70), were all located on the a
strand.
TrnL2, trnP, trnQ, trnS1, trnS2, trnT, trnW and trnY
showed 60 < %INUC < 70. Only three of them were
located on the b strand (Figure 2). Seven remaining
tRNAs exhibited 50% < %INUC < 60. Four of them
were located on the a strand, i.e., trnI, trnA, trnD, and
trnR, while three were on the b strand, i.e., trnL1, trnH
and trnV. %INUC values < 50% characterized the bstrand genes trnF and trnC. While the level of conservation was positively a strand-biased, no clear pattern
could be identified for single tRNAs located at various
points along the genome. For example, trnK, one of the
most conserved tRNAs, was located immediately
upstream of trnD (Figure 2), a much less conserved
gene (see above).
The tRNAs closest to the control region (i.e., trnV and
trnI), which is one of the start points of mtDNA replication, were not among most/less conserved. The same
applied to trnS2, immediately upstream of the s2 spacer,
where another center of mtDNA replication was located
(see below). The abundance of codon families did not
appear to be linked to the level of tRNA conservation.
Indeed, none of the most abundant codon families
(Leu2, Ile and Phe) exhibited the highest %INUCs.
Irrespective of the level of conservation, some tRNAs
presented mismatched pairs in stems (e.g., A-A in the
anticodon stem of trnK; T-T in the acceptor stem of
trnM). These mismatches are common in arthropod
mtDNAs and can be corrected through editing processes
(e.g., [73]) or may represent unusual pairings [74].
Further research at the transcript level is necessary to
better characterize this feature in neuropterid mtDNAs.

Page 16 of 26

In the most conserved tRNAs the nucleotide substitutions are largely restricted to TΨC and DHU loops and
extra arms (Figures 7, 8), with changes on acceptor and
anticodon stems reduced to 0-3 fully compensatory base
changes (cbcs) (e.g., G-C vs. A-T in the anticodon stem
of trnG) and/or hemi-cbc (e.g., G-T vs. A-T on the
acceptor stem of trnM) [75]. Note that in trnG, the
most conserved tRNA, it was not possible to model the
substitution pattern in the TΨC loop due to a high level
of variation among orthologous sequences (Figure 7).
With the increased variation, the number of cbcs and
hemi-cbcs increased in stems, usually with a more
marked substitution process in the TΨC stem (e.g., trnI,
trnV). In several tRNAs it was not possible to model
properly the substitution patterns in TΨC and DHU
loops due to the high level of divergence among
sequences. Cbcs and hemi-cbcs were restricted to a single species or characterized taxa at a higher taxonomic
rank (family/order). An example of the first type is the
G-C pair found in the trnH acceptor harm of P. concolorus, which was mirrored by A-T in all other neuropterids (Figure 7). An example of a full cbc characterizing
a unique family is the G-C pair found in the acceptor
stem of trnEs of family Ascalaphidae (A. appendiculatus
and L. macaronius), while other taxa exhibited the A-T
pair (Figure 7). A substitution pattern involving two full
cbcs characterizing the trnS1 acceptor arm of C. cornutus and P. concolorus (Corydalidae megalopterans) is
another example of high-taxonomic rank cbcs (Figure
8). Figures 7, 8 depict several more examples.
The presence of hemi-cbcs and, particularly, full cbcs
characterizing taxa at different taxonomic levels underscores the potential phylogenetic value of tRNA
sequences, especially when secondary structures are
taken into account. Until now, tRNAs have been rarely
considered in the study of insect phylogenetic relationships [76,77]. Our results suggest that these markers
deserve much more attention and should be more routinely used, as demonstrated by analyses performed in
other animal groups (e.g., [78]).
The study of the level of conservation in tRNA
families was extended to other endopterygotan orders in
which at least two fully sequenced mtDNAs exist. The
results of this analysis are summarized in Figure 9.
The pattern of %INUC variation exhibited by codon
families was not consistent among different endopterygotan taxa. The highest level of conservation was
observed in lepidopteran trnK (%INUC = 84.51), while
the minimum was found in hymenopteran trnC (%
INUC = 20.55). Lepidoptera had nine codon families
with %INUC ≥ 70, whereas five such families were
found in Neuropterida, two in Diptera, and none in
Coleoptera or Hymenoptera. Lepidopteran codon
families were the most conserved (avg-%INUC = 66.25

± 8.49), immediately followed by neuropterid codon
families (avg-%INUC = 61.46 ± 9.84). Dipteran codon
families showed slightly more divergence (avg-%INUC =
60.84 ± 8.59), while coleopteran (avg-%INUC = 38.92 ±
8.84) and hymenopteran (avg-%INUC = 37.19 ± 8.22)
codon families exhibited much lower levels of
conservation.
Neuropterid %INUCs were in some cases very similar
(e.g., trnA, trnH, trnM) or even surpassed (trnE, trnG,
trnS1) their lepidopteran counterparts (Figure 9). This
finding is striking because it indicates that the level of
variation among the three neuropterid orders is very
low, taking into account that Lepidoptera have very conserved tRNAs among Insecta [11]. Conversely, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera had diverging codon families.
Indeed, all hymenopteran tRNAs showed %INUC values
≤ 47.14, while no coleopteran tRNA exhibited %INUC >
58.21. The %INUC scores indicate a clear-cut discrepancy between the morphological diversity observed in
neuropterid orders and the low rate of substitution that
characterizes the evolution of their codon families. If the
level of divergence is considered a measure of taxonomic diversity, then the %INUC values would suggest
that Neuroptera, Megaloptera and Raphidioptera should
be treated as members of a single order.
Comparison of neuropterid rrnS and rrnL structures

The inferred secondary structure model for rrnS of L.
macaronius is provided in Figure 10. This is the first
prediction for a neuropterid insect. The overall structure, including three domains and 34 helices (progressively numbered in Figure 10), is largely in agreement
with those proposed for other endopterygote orders (i.e.
Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera)
[11,17,74,79]. A limited number of non-canonical

pairings (e.g., G-A on helix H23-434) were present in
the rrnS of L. macaronius. The multiple alignment of
neuropterid rrnSs spanned 812 positions and contained
353 conserved (43.47%) and 459 variable (56.53%) positions, respectively. Nucleotide variability among domains
and helices was unevenly distributed (Figure 10).
The inferred secondary structure model for the rrnL
of L. macaronius is provided in Figure 11. This is the
first prediction for a neuropterid insect. The structure
of this rrnL largely overlaps with previously published
structures for endopterygote insects (i.e. Coleoptera,
Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera) [11,17,74,79]. It
presents the five canonical domains (I-II, IV-VI) of
insect rrnLs that do not contain domain III [74]. In the
present paper domain I was fully modeled. This is the
first time that a secondary structure has been provided
for this domain, which in previous studies has been left
unmodeled (e.g., [8,11,56,74,79]). The predicted secondary structure of domain I included eight helices and is
consistent among all neuropterid taxa (Additional file 6,
Figure S3). The proposed structure can also be fitted to
rrnL of D. melanogaster (Additional file 6, Figure S3),
further extending the taxonomic range. Domain I contained a limited number of non-canonical pairings
(Additional file 6, Figure S3). More studies will be
necessary to corroborate the validity of the new structure presented here. Taking into account the secondary
structure of domain I, L. macaronius rrnL includes 50
helices. The multiple alignment of neuropterid rrnLs
extended over 1376 positions and contains 591 conserved (42.95%) and 785 variable sites (57.05%). Conserved nucleotides were unevenly distributed throughout
the rrnL secondary structure, with highest level of
invariable positions located on domain IV and lowest
level observed in domains I-II (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Secondary structure of L. macaronius rrnL. Each helix is numbered progressively from the 5’ to the 3’ end, followed by the first
nucleotide belonging to the helix itself. Domains are labeled with Roman numerals. Tertiary structures are denoted by boxed bases joined by
solid lines. Watson-Crick pairs are joined by dashes. GT pairs are joined by a blue dot, while other non-canonical pairs are connected by a red
dot.

Comparison of neuropterid mtDNA genomic spacers

The L. macaronius mtDNA contained 14 non-coding
portions (ncps), extending from 1 to 1049 nucleotides,
interspersed through PCGs, tRNAs and rrnL and rrnS
genes (Figure 2). Three of them spanned more than 15
bp and are labeled as spacers s1-s3 in Figures 2 and 12.
More or less similar patterns, but not fully overlapping,
were observed in other neuropteran mtDNAs, where the
ncps varied from a maximum of 15 (D. biseriata) to a
minimum of 10 (P. punctatus), with 13 non-coding portions found in A. appendiculatus. The dobsonflies C.
cornutus and P. concolorus exhibited the same number
(10) of ncps even if their distributional patterns did not
coincide. Conversely, the other megalopteran, S.
hamata, had 12 ncps. Finally, the raphidiopteran M.
harmandi exhibited the most compact mtDNA, having
only six npcs (Figure 12).
The spacers of L. macaronius are described more in
detail below. The s1 spacer was located between trnI
and trnQ and spanned 55 bp. Spacer s1 was present in

all partly/fully sequenced mtDNAs available for Neuroptera, i.e., A. appendiculatus, P. punctatus, M. immaculatus and D. biseriata [13,14], present paper)]. It was also
found in the megalopteran S. hamata, while it was
absent in the other megalopterans C. cornutus and P.
concolorus and in the raphidiopteran M. harmandi (Figure 12) [13-15]. The L. macaronius s1 can be aligned
confidently only with the counterpart found in A.
appendiculatus.
The s1 sequences of L. macaronius and A. appendiculatus shared a CCCCCC repeat located near the boundary with trnI and the CAA(A/G)TTAA(A/C)TAAAT
(TA/GT)A(C/T)GCA motif adjacent to trnQ. A. appendiculatus and L. macaronius belong to the same family,
Ascalaphidae. Thus, it seems that s1 sequences, when
present, diverge very fast among different families of the
same order.
The L. macaronius s2 was 20 bp long and was located
between trnS2 and nad1. The s2 spacer was present in
all partly or fully sequenced neuropterid mtDNAs

(Figure 12) [[13-15], present paper]. The s2 spacer is
supposed to contain [13] the binding site for the
DmTFF bidirectional transcription termination factor
[80]. Spacer s2 is a common feature of insect mtDNAs
(e.g., [12]).
The L. macaronius s3 spacer was composed of a 1049bp AT-rich region. The A+T content was 84.46%. This
finding implies that s3 contained 10% more A+T than
the whole a strand. Conversely, s3 was much less ATskewed than the complete a strand (0.029 vs. 0.072).
Strings of repeated single nucleotides (T)3-8, (A)3-11, (C)25, (G)2-5 characterized the s3 sequence. Furthermore, the
abundance of A/T was mirrored by the presence of
repeated motifs containing mostly/only A/T, a common
feature of insect control regions [81]. These motifs were
represented by shorter identical strings as well as longer
consensus patterns sharing 75% of identical positions.
The motif AT was the most abundant, occurring 192
times. ATA occurred 70 times, ATAT 29, AATAATTA
5, and ATATAAATA 6. Finally, five distinct A/T-rich
12-mers were repeated twice each (data not shown).
When a 75% minimum identity was allowed among
repeated motifs, two strings were identified, each containing 37 nucleotides and extending, respectively, from
base 551 to base 591 and from 811 to 847. Their consensus sequence was ATATTA (C/T) ATAT (GT/AA) ATA
(AT/TG) TA (T/A) TTATTA (A/T) TATATAAAT.
Thus, the L. macaronius AT-rich region contains several
repeated motifs of different sizes. A similar trend also
occurs in other neuropterids (data not shown).
Pair-wise as well as multiple alignments between/
among neuropterid AT-rich regions were performed by
applying very relaxed alignment parameters (i.e., gapopening = 1 vs. standard 15; and gap-extending = 3 vs.
standard 6.6). This strategy was applied to maximize the
matches of these fast-evolving genomic portions (see
below). This approach allowed us to align quite diverse
sequences but did not guarantee that the positional
homology principle was retained when the more diverging sequences were compared. The obtained results are
summarized in Table 6.
What is immediately evident is that the level of conserved positions dropped rapidly when comparisons were
extended above the taxonomic rank of family. Indeed, L.
macaronius and A. appendiculatus, both members of the
family Ascalaphidae, shared 71.59% nucleotide identity
and a common GC-rich motif TCCCCGGCCCCCCAGGAT located 96 bp downstream of the 5’-end of rrnS in
L. macaronius mtDNA. This motif could be a molecular
signature for the whole family, but a better taxon sampling is necessary to assess this point.
When all Neuroptera were considered, the identical
positions diminished to 30.15% in the multiple alignment. Thus, a substantial drop in nucleotide identity

shared by AT-rich regions occurs at the order level,
even permitting very permissive gap costs.
Similarly, C. cornutus and P. concolorus, both members of the family Corydalidae, shared 63.50% nucleotide
identity in their control regions. Conversely, the identity
level decreased to 45.91% when all megalopteran ATrich regions were compared. Finally, the alignment at
the interordinal taxonomic rank of neuropterid control
regions produced only 14.80% identical positions. Provided that gaps are quite numerous, this result leads to
the conclusion that the AT-rich region is a fast-evolving
genomic region. This behavior of neuropterid control
regions is a common feature of insect AT-rich regions
(e.g., [12]) and is shared with other animal groups. In
this respect, a well-documented group is represented by
mammals (e.g., [82,83]).
The utility of the AT-rich region as a phylogenetic
marker should be most effective at low taxonomic rank
(family level and below).

Conclusions
The mtDNA of L. macaronius, the fourth genome
sequenced for the order Neuroptera, exhibits the peculiar translocation of the trnC gene with respect to the
ancestral gene order of insects. This structural modification represents an exclusive feature of partly or fully
sequenced neuropteran mtDNAs and could be a peculiar genomic marker characterizing the entire order
Neuroptera.
The analysis of the AT%, AT-skew and GC-skew
parameters, which were performed on a set of 84

Negrisolo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/221

holometabolous insect mtDNAs, shows that these characteristics exhibit complex patterns of variations. Such
patterns can be linked or completely unlinked in their
variation process.
The neuropterid mtDNAs sequenced to date use the
standard invertebrate mitochondrial genome. The distribution of codon families in the PCGs located on the a
and b strands is influenced by both structural/functional
requirements of the corresponding proteins and by the
base composition and AT-/GC-skews. The comparison
among orthologous neuropterid PCGs shows that different genes have been subject to different rates of molecular evolution and form a pool of markers suitable for
different phylogenetic purposes.
The evolution of neuropterid tRNAs seems to have
been variable both in terms of sequence conservation
and nucleotide substitution processes.
Neuropterid rrnL and rrnS structures, as demonstrated
by the models produced for L. macaronius, appear similar to those determined for other insects. In their structural domains, they show diverse levels of conservation,
influenced by different rates of substitution.
An important advance in our comprehension of the
structure of rrnL is the production of a model for its
domain I. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
such a structural modeling has been attempted for an
arthropod rrnL.
Neuropterid mtDNAs are punctuated by non-coding
portions highly variable in size. Among them, the most
extended segment is the control region (AT-rich
region), which appears to be a fast-evolving genomic
region characterized by short to medium-size repeated
motifs/AT-rich patterns.

Methods
Sample origin and DNA extraction

The L. macaronius specimen used to determine the
mtDNA was collected in June 2007 by EN on arid prairies (45°47’35.75"N 13°35’50.63"E, 98 m elevation)
located in the Triestine karst along the road connecting
San Giovanni al Timavo to Medeazza (Friuli Venezia
Giulia region, northeastern Italy).
Total DNA was purified using the Invisorb DNA
extraction kit (Invitec). The quality of DNA was
assessed through electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel
and staining with SYBR-safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen).
PCR amplification and sequencing of L. macaronius
mtDNA

PCR amplification was performed using a mix of insect
universal primers and primers specifically designed
against the L. macaronius sequences [84,85]. The complete list of successful primers is available upon request.
The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in

Page 22 of 26

a 1% agarose gel and staining with SYBR-safe DNA gel
stain. Each PCR product represented by a single electrophoretic band was purified with the ExoSAP-IT kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and directly sequenced.
Sequencing of both strands was performed at the BMR
Genomics service (http://www.bmr-genomics.it/) on
automated DNA sequencers mostly employing the primers used for PCR amplification.
Sequence assembly and annotation

The mtDNA final consensus sequence was assembled
using the SeqMan II program from the Lasergene software package (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Gene and
strand nomenclature used in this paper were described
by Negrisolo et al. [86].
Sequence analysis was performed as follows. Initially,
the mtDNA sequence was translated in silico into putative proteins using the Transeq program available at the
EBI web site. The true identity of these polypeptides
was established using the BLAST program available at
the NCBI web site [87,88]. Gene boundaries were determined as follows. The 5’ ends of PCGs were inferred to
be at the first legitimate in-frame start codon (ATN,
GTG, TTG, GTT) in the open reading frame that was
not located within the upstream gene encoded on the
same strand [64,89]. The only exceptions were atp6 and
nad4, which overlap with their upstream genes (atp8
and nad4L, respectively) in many mtDNAs (e.g., [13]).
The PCG terminus was inferred to be at the first inframe stop codon encountered. When the stop codon
was located within the sequence of a downstream gene
encoded on the same strand, a truncated stop codon (T
or TA) adjacent to the beginning of the downstream
gene was designated the termination codon. This codon
was thought to be completed by polyadenylation to a
complete TAA stop codon after transcript processing.
Finally, pair-wise comparisons with orthologous proteins
were performed with ClustalW program to better define
the limits of PCGs [90].
Irrespective of the real initiation codon, formyl-Met
was assumed to be the starting amino acid for all proteins, as previously shown for other mitochondrial genomes [91,92].
The transfer RNA genes were identified using the
tRNAscan-SE program or recognized manually as
sequences having the appropriate anticodon and capability of folding into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure [64,93].
The boundaries of the ribosomal rrnL gene were
assumed to be delimited by the ends of the trnV-trnL1
pair. The 3’ end of the rrnS gene was assumed to be
delimited by the start of trnV, while the 5’ end was determined through comparison with orthologous genes of
other previously sequenced neuropterid insect mtDNAs.

Negrisolo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/221

The published neuropterid genomes were re-annotated using the criteria listed above. This approach led
us to propose different start/end positions for some
genes.
Genomic analysis

Nucleotide composition was calculated with the EditSeq
program included in the Lasergene software package.
GC-skew = (G-C)/(G+C) and AT-skew = (A-T)/(A+T)
were used to measure the base-compositional difference
between the different strands or between genes coded
on the alternative strands [94]. The prediction of the
genetic code used by each mtDNA was performed using
the GenDecoder web server [67,68].
Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values were
calculated with MEGA 4 program [95].
Codon usage in neuropterid mtDNAs was studied by
calculating the effective number of codon used index
(ENC) with the INCA 2.1 program [71,96]. Multiple
alignments of genes were produced with the ClustalW
algorithm implemented in MEGA 4 [90,95]. Both p-distances and the numbers of different nucleotides in pairwise comparisons were calculated with the PAUP* program [97].
Sequence motifs in the AT-rich region were identified
using the Spectral Repeat Finder program [98]. Not only
simple motifs were searched but also longer consensus
patterns with a minimum match of 75% among different
strings.
Testing for phylogenetic signal and saturation of the
substitution process

An a priori estimation of the phylogenetic signal present
in the multiple alignments was performed by maximum
likelihood mapping [70]. The phylogenetic signal was
evaluated using the TREEPUZZLE 5.2 program [99].
For the nucleotide sequences, the level of saturation of
the substitution process was estimated by plotting
uncorrected p-distances (based on observed substitutions) against GTR+I+G estimated distances for multiple
alignment of single PCGs as well as concatenated PCGs.
In the case of amino acid sequences, the level of saturation was estimated by plotting uncorrected p-distances
against mtREV24/JTT + G models implemented in
MEGA4 and TREEPUZZLE 5.2. After fitting a regression line, its slope (m) was used as a measure of saturation. If m = 1, no saturation is inferred, while for m
<<1, a high level of saturation has occurred.
rrnL and rrnS homology modeling

Secondary structures of rrnL and rrnS were produced
through homology modeling using as templates published structures of Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis [74,79].
