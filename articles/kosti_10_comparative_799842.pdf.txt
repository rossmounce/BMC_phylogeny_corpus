Comparative analysis of fungal protein kinases
and associated domains
Idit Kosti1, Yael Mandel-Gutfreund1, Fabian Glaser2*, Benjamin A Horwitz1*

Abstract
Background: Protein phosphorylation is responsible for a large portion of the regulatory functions of eukaryotic
cells. Although the list of sequenced genomes of filamentous fungi has grown rapidly, the kinomes of recently
sequenced species have not yet been studied in detail. The objective of this study is to apply a comparative
analysis of the kinase distribution in different fungal phyla, and to explore its relevance to understanding the
evolution of fungi and their taxonomic classification. We have analyzed in detail 12 subgroups of kinases and their
distribution over 30 species, as well as their potential use as a classifier for members of the fungal kingdom.
Results: Our findings show that despite the similarity of the kinase distribution in all fungi, their domain
distributions and kinome density can potentially be used to classify them and give insight into their evolutionary
origin. In general, we found that the overall representation of kinase groups is similar across fungal genomes, the
only exception being a large number of tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) kinases predicted in Laccaria bicolor. This
unexpected finding underscores the need to continue to sequence fungal genomes, since many species or
lineage-specific properties may remain to be discovered. Furthermore, we found that the domain organization
significantly varies between the fungal species. Our results suggest that protein kinases and their functional
domains strongly reflect fungal taxonomy.
Conclusions: Comparison of the predicted kinomes of sequenced fungi suggests essential signaling functions
common to all species, but also specific adaptations of the signal transduction networks to particular species.

Background
Filamentous fungi detect and respond to a variety of signals. As saprophytes or parasites, fungi need to monitor
the nutrient status, presence of a host and host defenses,
and avoid or respond to osmotic or oxidative stress,
light and other environmental variables [1]. Although
fungal development is less complex than that of higher
multicellular eukaryotes, internal signals are probably
required to program major differentiation steps: hyphal
extension and branching, sporulation, mating, secondary
metabolite accumulation and production of infection
structures. Finally, regulation of transcription, translation and cell division is expected to be similar to that of
other eukaryotes. Indeed, fungal models such as budding

and fission yeasts, Neurospora and Aspergillus have figured prominently in cell biology and genetics [2].
Protein kinases have roles in every aspect of regulation
and signal transduction, and provide new targets for
drug development [3]. Most eukaryotic protein kinases,
with the exception of the histidine kinases found in
two-component sensory systems, belong to a superfamily defined by a conserved protein kinase domain (ePK,
eukaryotic protein kinase). There are nearly 500 members of this superfamily in human and mouse [4-6]. The
ePK superfamily can be classified into several major
groups. The members of each of these groups are
related according to the signals that activate them and
the kinds of protein substrates they phosphorylate. The
original classification of Hanks and Hunter [7] has been
extended, refined, and applied to many eukaryotic genomes including some fungi [8]. Beginning a few years
ago there has been an increasing effort to sequence filamentous fungal genomes [9]. There has, however, been
no complete study of the kinomes of the recently

sequenced filamentous fungi. Furthermore, in addition
to identifying and classifying the kinases in the genomes,
there is now a unique opportunity to discover speciesspecific properties, as well as general trends related to
taxonomic group or other properties that are shared
between different sequenced fungi.
Based on the kinomer database [8], we developed an
automatic pipeline that predicts all putative kinases
from any given proteome, and classifies them. We then
analyzed their distribution, and tested different potential
classification methods. In addition to the basic ePK
domain present in almost all putative kinases, other
domains of the protein are essential for kinase activity
and interaction with effector proteins and substrates. In
the human kinome, 83 additional domain types were
identified, and additional domains were recognized in
over half of the kinases [6]. We identified all additional
domains that are present in the fungal kinomes according to PFAM classification, and discuss their presence
or absence in the different groups. Finally, we show that
the information contained in the domains is sufficient to
classify the fungi. Our analysis can be applied to any
other taxonomic or protein groups, and suggests a great
functional richness of kinases in different organisms.

Results and Discussion
We have studied the distribution, domain content and
kinase density among 30 species representing the
Dikarya or higher fungi, including two phyla (see Table
1). In this analysis, we obtained the full proteome for
each fungal genome from diverse sources, and then
used the Kinomer database [10] to identify and classify
each predicted kinase. This database classifies the eukaryotic protein kinases into two groups: ‘conventional’
(ePK) and ‘atypical’ (aPKs) protein kinases. This classification, based on sequence similarity, also allows the
construction of an accurate multi-level HMM library
that can be used to search and classify each putative
kinase in any organism to each of the 12 basic subgroups (see Methods for details).
Distribution of kinases in each functional sub-group

The initial result of this work is a list of putative kinase
proteins, classified by the Kinomer library. Figure 1A
shows the distribution of the 11 populated groups of
kinases (RGC has no representatives) found by applying
the Kinomer HMM library to each of the 30 fungal proteomes studied. The main populated groups of kinases
are AGC, CMAK, CMGC and STE, all of them belonging to the protein kinase superfamily [7,10]. These four
groups include 88% of all predicted kinases on average.
The least populated groups are Alpha and TK with only
1 and 2 representatives for all fungi, respectively. Within
the Hemiascomycota group (ascomycete yeasts:

Page 2 of 12

subphylum Saccharomycotina) the number and distribution of the different kinase groups are generally similar
(Figure 1A). In contrast, within the filamentous Ascomycota (subphylum Pezizomycotina) and the Basidiomycota groups, the variation in terms of kinase number is
much higher. When we look, however, at the normalized frequency of kinases in each group (relative to the
total number of kinases in each fungal proteome, Figure
1B), it is evident that, despite minor variations within
the different phyla and subphyla, the overall proportion
of each group is quite similar in each kinase sub-group:
AGC includes about 20% of all kinases in each species,
CAMK about 30%, etc.
Thus, most variation between species diminishes upon
normalization. Nevertheless, in terms of the kinome
size, we can see two distinct groups. The first one has
larger kinomes with, on average, 159 kinases, and
includes the ascomycetes Aspergillus clavatus, Aspergillus niger, Neosartorya fischeri, Aspergillus nidulans and
Ascosphaera apis and the basidiomycetes Cryptococcus
neoformans and Malassezia globosa. The second group
includes all other fungi in our study, having an average
of 85 putative kinases (see Additional File 1). Thus, the
larger group has, on average, almost twice the number
of kinases compared to the smaller group. The large
variation in the total number of kinases might be related
to partial genome duplication event(s). This assumption
is supported by considerable evidence of genome duplication in fungi [11]. However, expansion of the number
of predicted protein kinases does not correspond to the
overall predicted frequency of duplications. Aspergillus
nidulans, for example, has an expanded number of
kinases compared to A. fumigatus and A. oryzae (as we
find also in this study, see Additional File 1), yet the
estimated frequency of duplications [11] is quite similar
for these three members of the genus Aspergillus. About
a third of our samples seem to have undergone a possible duplication event of either the kinome and/or the
genome of these fungi.
As mentioned above, the Hemiascomycota (Ascomycota, Subphylum Saccharomycotina) group seems to be
much more compact in terms of kinase number. This
indicates, perhaps, a “tighter” evolution of this group
with respect to their signaling pathways. For those fungi
that have not undergone kinome duplication, the number of kinases found for each group is remarkably similar (see black bars in Additional File 1), given the large
evolutionary differences between them. The reasons for
independent expansion of protein kinase gene families
are not clear, but it has been proposed that genes
involved in regulatory interactions might retain duplication. The result would be selective expansion of these
classes of genes. Modeling of the effects of three genome duplications in Arabidopsis over the past 350

Taxonomy follows [18] and [21]. Saccharomycotina (Ascomycete yeasts) are often referred to as Hemiascomycota and we have retained the tag _he in the
abbreviated species names in the figures, for simplicity.

million years suggests that duplications of regulatory
genes are retained, particularly, for large-scale events,
because signal transducer proteins act in complexes
[12,13]. The Zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae genome has
undergone a high level of duplication [14]. In this species, we found (data not shown) that the main kinase
families are expanded about two fold. Here again, after
normalization the relative number of kinase families are
within the range of the Dikarya which are shown in Figure 1B. Analysis of other Zygomycete species will
answer the question of whether expanded numbers of
kinases are a more general property of this phylum.
One striking exception to the overall similarity in the
(normalized) distribution of kinases among the major

subfamilies is the TKL kinase family (25) predicted for
Laccaria bicolor. It is generally thought that there are
no tyrosine kinases (TK) in fungi and our results support this. Nevertheless, in our data the Basidiomycete
Laccaria bicolor shows, exceptionally, a huge number of
TKL protein kinase genes. Pending direct experimental
evidence, of course, this suggests a large deviation of
this fungus kinome towards the TKL group.
Kinome and Proteome Size

An expanded and/or diverse kinome may provide a
more flexible signaling network. This implies that
overall parameters like kinome size as compared to
proteome size might not always follow classical (and

molecular) taxonomy. A striking example comes from
recent work on the genomes of myxobacteria, which
are prokaryotic, but contain an unexpectedly high
number of eukaryotic-like (serine/threonine and tyrosine) protein kinases [15]. The proteome and kinome
sizes of the fungi used in this study vary considerably.
We note that the predicted fungal proteomes are only
as accurate as the assumptions used in their construction. For example alternative splicing, a major source
of protein diversity, is not taken into account, although
there is evidence for biologically important alternative
splicing events in fungi (in the Neurospora circadian
clock, for example, [16,17]). Figure 2A shows the correlation between proteome and kinome sizes. The
Hemiascomycota (Ascomycota, Saccharomycotina)
fungi form a fairly uniform cluster (blue squares on
cluster 1, Figure 2B). These species have smaller proteomes and tend to be highly similar in terms of
kinome and proteome size. The Ascomycota (Pezizomycotina) and Basidiomycota groups have larger proteomes and also show greater variation; a subset of the
filamentous Ascomycetes forms a compact group,
quite variable in proteome size, but with very similar
kinome sizes (cluster 2, Figure 2A).
Another way to look at this information would be to
calculate the kinome density. This is the percentage of
the total number of predicted kinase proteins within
the total number of proteins predicted for each fungal
species. Figure 2B shows the kinase density for all the
fungi, sorted by value. It suggests that filamentous
ascomycetes and the hemiascomycete yeasts can be
classified according to their kinome density. The basidiomycetes have a much more variable kinome density
and therefore it would be difficult to classify them
based on this parameter. A Wilcoxon test (p-value =
9.6 × 10-4) confirmed that the Ascomycete and Hemiascomycete fungi could be successfully classified using
their kinome density values. This difference in kinome
density might represent the result of evolutionary pressure toward diversification of signal transduction pathways. Although this seems logical, there is really no
obvious correlation between kinome density or diversity and the “lifestyle” (pathogen or saprophyte, particular host or ecological niche) of the sequenced
species that we have studied. S. pombe is the only
exception within the Ascomycetes, having the largest
kinome density of all fungi studied. S. pombe though is
the only species belonging to the Taphrinomycotina
subphylum within the Ascomycetes, which represents
its own subphylum branch. Thus we cannot anticipate
whether this is a unique difference or a trend of its
subphylum (see Figure 1 in [18]). Interestingly, the second densest fungal kinome belongs to S. cereviseae,
another type of yeast.

Domain distribution

Most protein kinases act in combination with other
kinases and other signaling effectors, and are modulated
by phosphorylation cascades. Other domains within
these proteins have important regulatory activity, link to
other signaling modules, or provide a localization signal
[6]. We therefore studied the identity and number of
domains flanking the kinase catalytic domain ePK in
each predicted kinase. To this aim we searched the
putative kinases against the PFAM database (see
Methods).
The 30 fungal species have a total of 2976 putative
kinase sequences, matching 4294 significant PFAM
domains, which makes an average of 1.4 domains per
kinase. According to PFAM, 3292 domains have kinase
catalytic activity and the remaining 1002 have nonkinase domain activity. This suggests that the kinase
proteins have an enormous richness of functional
domains, with an average 0.3 of non-kinase domains
and 1.1 kinase domains per sequence. We find that
there are a total of 72 different domain types, of which
7 are annotated in PFAM to have kinase activity (see
Figure 3 and text below): Pkinase (2867 domains), Pkinase_C (196), PI3_PI4_kinase (103), BCDHK_Adom3
(81), RIO1 (36), Pkinase_Tyr (8) and Alpha_kinase (1).
The Pkinase domain is the most common type of kinase
domain in our fungi, where it represents about 87% of
all catalytic domains, and in PFAM, with more than
32000 representative sequences. But Pkinase is not the
only conserved kinase catalytic domain type. There are
425 additional putative kinases with a catalytic kinase
domain different from the classical kinase catalytic
domain Pkinase: Pkinase_C is a kinase C terminal
domain, PI3_PI4_kinase is a phosphatidylinositol 3- and
4-kinase domain, BCDHK_Adom3 is a mitochondrial
dehydrogenase kinase domain, RIO1 is a typical serine
kinase domain, the Pkinase_Tyr kinase, a tyrosine kinase
domain and Alpha_kinase an alpha kinase domain.
Those additional kinase domains represent almost 13%
of the catalytic kinase domains, and add a rich variety of
specific kinase catalytic functions to the kinome.
Very interestingly, while Pkinase (and in smaller proportion Pkinase_C, PI3_PI4_kinase, BCDHK_Adom3,
HATPase_c and RIO1) appears almost in every fungal
species, Pkinase_Tyr and Alpha_kinase domains are
much more rare (see below). Pkinase_Tyr is highly
represented only in Laccaria bicolor while isolated TK
and TKL kinases were found in several species in our
analysis and in the Kinomer database [10].
Figure 3 shows the sum of the domain distribution
found in the predicted kinase proteins studied here.
Overall, we have found that in addition to the 7 kinase
domains, there are 65 different types of domains. This
number is about three quarters of that found for the

human kinome [6]. The three most common domains are
kinase catalytic domains (in black in Figure 3), while
many of the highly frequent non-kinase domains (in grey
in Figure 3) are kinase regulatory domains, like FHA,
FATC, HR1, etc. Additionally, Figure 3 shows that there
are 32 very rare domains, appearing only once in all the
kinomes studied, like TPP_enzyme_C (Thiamine pyrophosphate enzyme, C-terminal TPP binding domain) and

Fungal_trans domain (Fungal specific transcription factor
domain). This variation in the domain type and frequency indicates functional and evolutionary differences
that are not easy to interpret, but that can, in principle,
be used to classify the fungi, as a complement to classical
taxonomical and phylogenetic procedures.
Of the first 10 most common domains in the fungi
studied here, 9 are also present in the human kinome,

reflecting a highly conserved kinome functional milieu:
Pkinase_C (Catalytic kinase), PI3_PI4_kinase (Catalytic
kinase), FATC and FAT (Accessory domain for PI34K
domains), FHA (Nuclear signaling), HATPase_c
(ATPase catalytic activity), C1_1 (Phospholipid binding)
and PBD (GTPase interaction). These functional
domains have very broad and general functions, thus
explaining why they appear in all types of fungi and
also in the human kinome. The exception is
BCDHK_Adom3; this domain is involved in the regulation of the dehydrogenase complex that breaks down
branched-chain amino-acids and it is similar to the
HATPase_c family [19]. Interestingly, however, these
are, as mentioned, the 10 most common accessory
domains in fungi, while in human only two of them,
Pkinase_C and C1_1, are also among the 10 most common domains. The remaining six domains that do exist
in the human kinome are far less common than in
fungi, indicating that these kinase associated domains
could be good indicator of functional differences among
species.
We believe that the kinome domain distribution, both
in type and number, should be indicative of functional
and evolutionary differences between fungi. In the next
section, we show that this variability is enough to differentiate among different fungal phyla and subphyla.

Domain analysis and Principal Component Analysis
grouping

Taxonomic classification is not always a straightforward
task. In this work we tested several criteria for clustering
all 30 fungi studied here, based on the number and type
of kinases and additional domains (see Methods). Following that, we compared the results with fungal taxonomy [20,21]. We found that the most informative
clustering was achieved when considering only the distribution of the most common accessory domains. Figure 4 shows the PCA clustering of the different fungi,
based on the frequency and type of the 21 most common domains found among all fungal kinomes (see
Methods). This classification yields 3 clusters of fungi
which show a high correspondence with classical taxonomic classification.
As illustrated in Figure 4, the PCA grouping shows
that the domain distribution is more similar among the
Pezizomycota subphylum of the Ascomycota and among
the Saccharomycota subphylum of the Ascomycota.
Among the Basidiomycetes the domain distribution is
less tight, although still distinguishable from the first
two groups. Though only five species are currently available for analysis, it is noticeable that M. globosa and U.
maydis both belong to the subphylum Ustilaginomycotina and are fairly close to each other (dots 20 and 22).

Figure 4 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of domain frequencies. The PCA plot is based on 21 domain frequencies in all 30 fungi (i.e.
domains present in at least half of the fungi, see Additional File 4), projected onto three uncorrelated axes (principal components). The PCA
analysis revealed two tight clusters for Ascomycota/Pezizomycota (red dots) and Saccharomycotina (blue dots) groups, and a more spread, but
still distinguishable, cluster for Basidiomycetes (green dots). Ellipsoids enclose the clusters for clarity. The only representative of Ascomycota/
Taphrinomycotina (S. pombe) dot 30 (in yellow), forms its own singleton cluster. Species numbers (according to Table 1) are given for some dots,
for reference in the text.

Kosti et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/133

Likewise, dots 18, 19 and 21, which represent members
of the Agaricomycotina: C. neoformans, P. chrysosporium
and Laccaria bicolor, are closely located. Assuming that
S. pombe forms its own singleton cluster, 26 members
of the fungi family in this study are clustered by the
PCA into one of four groups according to their domain
distribution. Four species fall outside these clusters. Of
those, two do not reside in any group, and two are
mixed: among the ascomycetes, one member of
the Pezizomycota (dot 16, Figure 4) and one member of
the Saccharomycotina (dot 28, Figure 4) crossed to the
other side of the cluster boundaries. Very interestingly,
here again S. pombe (Ascomycota/Taphrinomycotina),
clusters differently from the Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina groups. Indeed, when looking closely at
the domain content, there are several examples in which
S. pombe is quite different from its ascomycete relatives.
For example, it has a much lower density of HATPase_c
domains, a higher percentage of HEAT domains and a
higher percentage of the Rapamycin_bind domains. It
would be difficult to conclude whether this reflects any
aspect of fission yeast lifestyle, or is simply a consequence of evolutionary distance among the species. The
PCA results indicate clearly that the domain distribution
includes different evolutionary information at the level
of the subphyla.
While the classification, based on the most common
functional domains from the kinome, is very similar to the
classical taxonomy it would also be interesting to try and
understand the functional and evolutionary implications of
the rare domains appearing only in a certain phyla or fungal species. For example, the ascomycete A. nidulans has
unique domains like CNH, FAD-oxidase_C, RCC1 and
many more, making a total of 16 unique accessory
domains, which suggests that A. nidulans has possibly
acquired a diverse kinase-related functionality. Currently,
based on its physiology, there is no obvious clue as to why
this should be so, but since A. nidulans is one of the beststudied model genetic species there may be a good basis
to understand this result in future studies.
From the most common domain distribution, there
are some clear cases of variations between the subgroups. For example the POLO_box domain appears in
all Basidiomycota and in the Saccharomycotina, while is
quite rare within the filamentous Ascomycota. Polo
boxes appear to mediate interaction with multiple proteins through protein-protein interactions. The HEAT
domain, common in both Ascomycete subphyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina, is extremely rare in
Basidiomycetes (appears only in C. neoformans). Many
HEAT repeat-containing proteins are involved in intracellular transport processes. Although we cannot fully
understand how these differences directly impact the
function of the different species, there is a clear

correlation between the domain distributions and the
taxonomic classification.

Conclusions
The overall distribution of protein kinases within very
different fungal phyla and subphyla seems to be very
similar. The overall kinome density is in good agreement with taxonomy. The distribution of additional
domains, which could have functional implications,
does differ significantly between species, and seems
able to provide a functional classification that overlaps
with taxonomical classification. Although generally the
classical phyla classification correlates with the kinome
density and domain distribution, there are exceptions.
Basidiomycota do not cluster by kinase number, but
they have a similar kinome to proteome ratio. Ascomycetes are well clustered by all criteria, with two exceptions: A. nidulans has a different kinome to proteome
ratio and a different kinase distribution. Nevertheless,
A. nidulans is not unusual according to the PCA analysis. Among the filamentous ascomycetes, there is no
obvious clustering according to class within the subphylum Pezizomycotina. We note, however, that the
class Eurotiomycetes is over-represented in the
sequenced genomes published to date, perhaps because
the beneficial (Penicillium, Aspergillus oryzae), harmful
(Aspergillus nidulans), or pathogenic (Coccidioides, Histoplasma) members of this group, which have drawn
much attention over the years. Schizosaccharomyces
pombe has a very high kinome density much similar to
the Saccharomycotina group. The predicted proteome
of Laccaria bicolor has an extraordinary number of
TKL kinases; further work can determine whether this
is an anomaly, or a more general trait found in mycorrhizal symbionts [22]. Finally, the PCA approach based
on the most common domains clusters the Pezizomycotina group and the Saccaromycotina group very
tightly, while the Basidiomycetes are more divergent.
The approach taken here could be repeated for additional groups of proteins (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors) in order to study their evolution and variability
within each fungi phylum. These data can also be used
to guide experimental work to elucidate the function of
individual protein kinases and the signal transduction
pathways they function in.
Methods
Kinase collection and analysis pipeline

We have designed and implemented an automatic pipeline (Figure 5) to extract all putative kinases from fungi
proteomes and explore their properties. The pipeline
uses a variety of tools to extract and classify the putative
kinases from all the fungi. Below we describe the pipeline, which can be downloaded as Additional File 2.

We chose a fixed bit score cutoff, since it provides us
with a unified criterion for all fungi, so we can compare
the numbers based on the same scale. The bit score
reflects whether the sequence is a good match to the
HMM model. A score above log 2 of the number of
sequences in the target database is likely to be a true
homologue. For our fungi proteomes, this rule-of-thumb
number is on the order of 20 bits. In any case e-value
and bit score should be strongly correlated, true homologues will have both a good bit score and a good Evalue [23].
Once the kinase groups are populated, the pipeline is
designed to extract functional and phylogenetic information from the list of putative kinases. The pipeline procedure and subsequent analysis (see below) is
summarized in Figure 5. Since we preferred here to
miss a number of potential kinases rather than including
false positives, we did not use the category “Others” as
described in the Kinomer database.

Kinase searching and classification

In order to extract the kinome we fed the HMMer software (version 2.3.2 [23]) with pre-calculated multilevel
HMM libraries from the Kinomer 1.0 database. HMMer
uses profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) to do sensitive database searching using statistical descriptions of
a sequence family’s consensus. This process allows an
accurate extraction and classification of protein kinases
into one of the 12 previously defined kinase groups [8].
Our procedure is very similar to that described by [8],
the only significant difference is the cutoff value used
for each putative kinase. While Miranda-Saavedra and
coworkers [8] used a variable e-value cutoff to choose
the correct group for each kinase, we used a fixed
HMM bit score cutoff: if the score is greater than 20 a
protein is predicted to be a kinase, and if more than one
HMM is matched, the higher is selected. Miranda-Saavedra and coworkers reported a high accuracy of their
HMM, which according to their study are able to identify successfully between 90 and 97.5% of all the ePKs of
37 annotated kinomes; from those ~98% were estimated
to be correctly classified in each of the subgroups [8].
Therefore we believe that our results should present a
similar accuracy, despite the fact that there might be a
few mis-classifications in any group of kinases. The
modified cutoff criteria used here (see Methods) resulted
in slightly different numbers of predicted kinases when
compared to the Kinomer results, but the calculated distribution (data not shown) is very similar, for those species previously studied [8].

Homology search - The pipeline runs Blastp [24] (version 2.2.17) against the Swissprot database (November
2008 version) to allow comparison to known proteins
with annotation. The output of this stage is a list of all
homologs for each kinase entry. Data from this stage is
not shown in the paper.
Domains search - The pipeline identifies the domains
of each putative kinase by running the pfam_search.pl
script against PFAM A [25] HMMs library. We then
analyze the presence of each domain within a specific
fungal group.
Phylogenetic information

In order to build phylogenetic trees we constructed
multiple alignments for each group using the MSA program MUSCLE (version 3.7) [26,27]. The multiple
sequence alignments are then used for constructing phylogenetic trees using FastTree version 2.0 [28] with the
generalized time-reversible models of nucleotide evolution and the JTT model [29] of amino acid evolution.
We used FigTree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ for phylogenetic visualization. Additional File 3
shows one example of the phylogenetic trees produced.
This corresponds to the 134 predicted kinases of Aspergillus nidulans. Aside from a few exceptions, the kinases
are clustered according to their predicted group.
The pipeline is written in Perl scripting language and
was tested on Fedora and Ubuntu operating systems.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We classified the 30 fungi based on the percentage of
each domain type found in each species, limiting the
data to those domains present in at least half of the

Kosti et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/133

fungi (see Additional File 4). We then applied the PCA
procedure described in [30] to cluster the fungi. The
PCA was obtained using the GNU R software (R: A
Language and Environment for Statistical Computing,
http://www.R-project.org, 2009).
