Systematic mapping of two component response
regulators to gene targets in a model sulfate
reducing bacterium

Abstract
Background: Two component regulatory systems are the primary form of signal transduction in bacteria. Although
genomic binding sites have been determined for several eukaryotic and bacterial transcription factors,
comprehensive identification of gene targets of two component response regulators remains challenging due to
the lack of knowledge of the signals required for their activation. We focused our study on Desulfovibrio vulgaris
Hildenborough, a sulfate reducing bacterium that encodes unusually diverse and largely uncharacterized two
component signal transduction systems.
Results: We report the first systematic mapping of the genes regulated by all transcriptionally acting response
regulators in a single bacterium. Our results enabled functional predictions for several response regulators and
include key processes of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism, cell motility and biofilm formation, and
responses to stresses such as nitrite, low potassium and phosphate starvation. Our study also led to the prediction
of new genes and regulatory networks, which found corroboration in a compendium of transcriptome data
available for D. vulgaris. For several regulators we predicted and experimentally verified the binding site motifs,
most of which were discovered as part of this study.
Conclusions: The gene targets identified for the response regulators allowed strong functional predictions to be
made for the corresponding two component systems. By tracking the D. vulgaris regulators and their motifs
outside the Desulfovibrio spp. we provide testable hypotheses regarding the functions of orthologous regulators in
other organisms. The in vitro array based method optimized here is generally applicable for the study of such
systems in all organisms.

Background
Signal transduction to sense and respond to environmental and intracellular changes governs key cellular
regulatory functions. In bacteria, two component systems, composed typically of a sensor histidine kinase
(HK) and a response regulator (RR), are the primary
and best-studied mechanisms for perceiving such
changes and controlling downstream responses [1-3].
The regulatory network of an organism is often a reflection of the environments in which it can survive and the
signal transduction systems in microbes have been correlated to their sensory IQs [2]. Desulfovibrio vulgaris
Hildenborough, an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacterium,

occupies a variety of ecological niches and encodes a
strikingly large number of these systems with unusual
diversity attributed to lineage-specific expansion of
existing gene families [4]. Studied since the 1940s, D.
vulgaris Hildenborough has come to serve as a model
system to evaluate dissimilatory sulfate reduction and
hydrogen cycling [5]. However, the function of none of
its two component systems, encoded by 72 RRs and 64
HKs, have been characterized to date.
The distribution of RRs in D. vulgaris Hildenborough
is considerably different from in other microbes. Of the
72 RRs in D. vulgaris Hildenborough, 29 have a DNA
binding domain (DBD), indicating function via gene regulation. Twenty-two of these fall into the NtrC family of
s54-dependent RRs. s54-dependent response regulators
in bacteria typically make up approximately 9% of the

total RRs in most organisms [2] but in D. vulgaris Hildenborough this group constitutes 30% of the total RRs,
and 75% of the ones with DBDs. On the other hand, the
OmpR family, which typically constitutes the most
abundant class of RRs in bacteria, has only two representatives in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. The remaining
five RRs fall into the LytR and NarL families (Table S1
in Additional file 1). With the exception of DVU1083,
which is an ortholog of the Escherichia coli PhoB [6],
none of the RRs have any characterized orthologs. The
targets of these 29 RRs represent the transcriptional
portion of the two component regulatory network of
this organism and to date remains almost entirely
undetermined.
With the exception of a few model organisms such as
E. coli [7,8], Caulobacter crescentus [9], and Bacillus
subtilis [10,11], genes regulated by these systems remain
largely unmapped in most organisms. Even in model
bacteria, systematic approaches to delineate gene targets
and regulatory networks controlled by two component
systems are rare and the available knowledge of their
networks represents information compiled from a large
body of literature, in silico efforts [8,12], or by indirect
inference of targets based on transcriptomics analysis
[10]. While mapping of binding sites via ChIP-on-chip
assays is now done routinely for transcription factors, it
is effective for two component RRs only if the activating
signal or conditions are known. As a result, even in E.
coli and B. subtilis the function and targets of some
two-component systems remain unmapped.
Here we present a systematic experimental determination of the genes regulated by the transcriptionally acting RRs in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. We optimized an
in vitro approach in order to bypass the requirement of
using activating conditions that are largely unknown for
these two component systems. To our knowledge, this is
the first extensive use of an in vitro genome-wide
method to map bacterial two component system RR
binding sites.

Results and discussion
Gene targets were determined for 24 D. vulgaris
Hildenborough RRs

Activation of RRs and downstream effector function via
two component systems are highly regulated events in
vivo. As a result, efforts to identify genes regulated by a
given RR in vivo necessitate the use of conditions that
activate the signal transduction cascade. These signals
are known for very few two component systems and are
not known for any of the regulators in this study. As
such, in vitro analyses adapted from ChIP-on-chip-based
assays [13-15] provide a reasonable approach. We
devised the DNA-Affinity-Purified-chip (DAP-chip)
strategy where purified His-tagged RRs are incubated

with sheared D. vulgaris Hildenborough genomic DNA,
and RR-bound DNA is affinity purified using Ni-NTA
resin. The enriched DNA fraction and the starting input
DNA are whole-genome amplified, labeled with Cy5 and
Cy3, respectively, pooled and hybridized to a custom D.
vulgaris tiling array to determine enriched gene targets
(Figure 1a).
In our study all RRs being examined present systems
with unknown gene targets. To minimize artifacts associated with in vitro DNA protein binding assays, we
undertook several preliminary experiments to provide
the adequate controls to assess false positives and to set
the threshold for cut off (outlined in Figure 1b). An
example of a completely mapped RR is depicted in Figure 2. We determined one gene target for each of the
RRs using gel-shift assays that then served as a positive
control. First, the RR was tested for binding to the
upstream region of its own gene or operon. If no binding was observed, other candidates were selected for
testing based on either their proximity to the RR gene/
operon or its regulon predictions (MicrobesOnline
[16,17]). For the NtrC family RRs, we also used s54 promoter predictions to narrow candidates for target genes.
Using these rationales, target sequences were successfully found for 21 of the 28 purified RRs (Figure 3;
Table S2 in Additional file 1), of which 8 showed binding to sequences upstream of the RR gene/operon itself
and 7 had targets in adjacent upstream or downstream
operons. For the remaining six RRs, targets were identified as described in Additional file 2.
Parameters for RR binding to the sheared genomic
DNA were determined using the gel-shift assays and
enrichment of the positive control target in the RRbound DNA fraction was confirmed using quantitative
PCR (qPCR; Table S3 in Additional file 1). Successful
enrichment of the positive control and no enrichment
of a non-specific negative control (Figure 2c) also serves
as a validation of the specificity of binding seen in the
gel-shift assays, and increases the confidence in the subsequent DAP-chip data set. The chip-based measurements were then conducted as described in Materials
and methods. Nimblescan software was used to analyze
the tiling array data and rank enriched gene loci for
each RR. The top 20 peaks obtained for each DAP-chip
are provided in Table S4 in Additional file 1.
For all RRs, the DAP-chip assays generated peaks with
corresponding low false discovery rate (FDR) scores.
Therefore, several criteria (Materials and methods) were
used to manually curate the list of most likely targets
(Figures 4, 5 and 6; Table S5 in Additional file 1). In
most cases the positive target was among the top five
candidates on the list (Table S4 in Additional file 1),
strengthening the confidence in our data sets. For the
seven RRs that had no target positive control

Figure 2 The steps used to map RRs are illustrated using an example. (a) DVU1419 is a s54-dependent RR encoded in a three-gene
operon. (b) RR DVU1419 shifts the upstream region of its own operon. (c) Quantitative PCR shows that the upstream region of DVU1418 is
enriched in the RR-bound DNA fraction (E) compared to the input DNA (I). As a negative control (-C), quantitative PCR of the upstream region of
an unrelated kinase gene, DVU0013, shows no enrichment. (d) Artemis plots [52] of the three most highly enriched peaks obtained by DAP-chip.
The corresponding gene is highlighted in the red oval. The vertical line corresponds to the location of the binding site motif (highlighted in
yellow) within the peak. (e) An 18-bp motif was predicted by applying MEME (MicrobesOnline, using PATSER [53]) on the upstream regions of
orthologs of DVU1418 in the closely related species D. vulgaris Miyazaki (DvM) and D. desulfuricans G20. (f) A similar motif was found by
applying MEME to the upstream regions of the three DAP-chip gene targets. (g) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to validate the
motif. Changing selected bases within the motif eliminated the shift. DvH, D. vulgaris Hildenborough; HK, histidine kinase, Hpt, histidine

are shown by their DVU#. (a) RRs whose target was identified upstream of its own gene or operon. (b) RRs whose target was identified

determined, DAP-chips were conducted blind (Table S4
in Additional file 1). The blind assays were successful
for the two s54-dependent RRs (DVU0653 and
DVU0744) where the targets identified also contained
putative s54-dependent promoters, and for two of the
five remaining RRs (DVU0749 and DVU2588). A clear
target list could not be identified for RRs DVU2675 or
DVUA0137 due to poor overlap in hits from their replicates (Table S4 in Additional file 1). RR DVU2577 had
high non-specific binding activity in an electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA). As a result, although the
DAP-chip assay for this RR generated a list with some
possible targets (Table S4 in Additional file 1), the specificity of these peaks could not be unambiguously
determined.
Based on our cutoff criteria and EMSA validations,
approximately 200 genes (Table S5 in Additional file 1)

in 84 operons could be mapped to two component signal control, representing approximately 4% of the ORFs
encoded in the D. vulgaris Hildenborough genome (Figure 7). The DAP-chip method worked especially well for
the s54-dependent RRs, since s54 promoter predictions
could be used as an additional tool to validate gene targets. The method works best when at least one target is
known or can be determined using other methods prior
to assaying via DAP-chip. Nevertheless, successful blind
DAP-chip measurements are possible for two component systems with no known target, or regulon predictions, as we demonstrated for four RRs.
Determination of binding site motifs

Binding sites for the RRs were determined using two
methods. The first method used MEME [18] to find a
motif using the upstream regions of the target gene

mapped to a single target locus. The second method
used MEME on the upstream regions of the multiple
target genes from the DAP-chip results. In most cases,

motif finding was more successful using the first method
since DAP-chip data were likely to contain sequences
that did not correspond to upstream regions or were
sticky DNA that did not contain a conserved motif. A
reasonable motif prediction was then validated using

EMSA on synthesized DNA substrates containing the
motif. Where a shift was observed, specificity of the
shift was confirmed using synthesized DNA substrates
with base pair changes in the predicted conserved
sequence (Figure 9). A maximum of three conserved
bases within each repeat of the motif was changed as
detailed in Table S6 in Additional file 1. For validated
motifs that had been predicted based on target orthologs, the DAP-chip peak list was reviewed for other
peaks containing the motif. Using the binding sites from
the different targets (Table S7 in Additional file 1), the
motif was refined to obtain the final binding site motif
for the RR (Figure 8).
Our approach proved to be very successful. Binding sites
were predicted and confirmed for 15 hitherto uncharacterized RRs (see Figure 8 for the motifs and Figures 4, 5 and
6 for binding site distribution within targets). Experimentally validated motifs further confirm the specificity of the
peaks discovered using the DAP-chip method. The majority of the binding sites are palindromic, ranging from 4- to
6-bp inverted repeats separated by 3 to 8 bp in between.
In two cases, DVU2394 and DVU1083, the binding site

was found to be a direct repeat. Interestingly, RRs
DVU0539 and DVU0946, which are paralogs, also recognized the same binding site (Figures 8 and 9).
The confirmed binding motifs were used to assess the
general applicability and robustness of this method. First
we examined if the binding sequences were present in
all the hits for an RR in its DAP-chip data set. Our analyses indicate that for the RRs where a motif was determined, a single motif explained all the targets found in
the DAP-chip analysis. The primary exception was
DVU1083 (PhoB), where the motif was found upstream
of only 14 of the 30 targets. The other exceptions were
DVU2394 and DVU0539, where the discovered motif
was only present in a subset of the DAP-chip hits
(Table S8 in Additional file 1).
A genome-wide scan also revealed that the DAP-chip
assay successfully enriched all loci containing the binding
site motif for a given RR. An exception to this general
observation was the RR DVU1063 (the flagella regulator,
see below), for which a sizable number of potential
sequences in upstream regions were present that were not
enriched as targets in our assay (Table S9 in Additional

Figure 6 Regulatory network involving 12 two component systems. These 12 RRs (each colored differently), including three non-s54 RRs
(shown on the right-hand side), are connected by their overlapping targets. DVU0946 and DVU0539 are paralogs with similar targets and binding
sites and are colored the same. Objects are not drawn to scale. This is a conservative list of the most likely targets (for a more comprehensive list of
DAP-chip peaks see Table S4 in Additional file 1). Where present, predicted s54-dependent promoters are indicated. Note that there is a missing
gene annotation downstream of DVU0653 (Figure S1 in Additional file 3). Validated binding site motifs (vertical bars) are colored according to the
RR gene color. For RR DVU1083, only those targets with a binding site motif are shown in the figure. DBD, DNA binding domain; HK, histidine

file 1). Interestingly, many of these are flagella and motility-related genes, suggesting that they are real targets.
While it is not clear why these sequences were not
enriched in the in vitro assay, one possibility is that the
quantity of protein or the provided activated state used
was insufficient for interaction with all available loci. DNA
modification such as via methylation is another source of
regulation that would persist in an in vitro assay and affect
motif recognition. Additional experiments would be
required to examine these hypotheses.

data available for D. vulgaris Hildenborough from transcriptomics studies under different stresses and conditions (MicrobesOnline) and high-resolution tiling arrays
conducted to identify transcribed regions and estimate
their level of expression [19] were also used to obtain
support for conclusions from our measurements. Using
the transcriptomics data, RRs and their target operons
were examined for any obvious co-expression patterns
while the tiling array data provided support for the
expression levels of a gene under routine growth
conditions.

Figure 7 Regulatory network of D. vulgaris Hildenborough. Circular-genome diagram depicting the loci of all RRs, the corresponding
mapped genes and predicted functions based on putative annotated functions of target genes. The figure was generated using a
modified Circos script [54]. Genes and connections are as labeled in the figure. Color legends are derived from maps in Figures 4, 5 and 6.
Probable functions of RRs as suggested by regulated genes are shown in green boxes. Cognate histidine kinases, where predicted, are shown in
gray. Figure does not include pDV1 borne RRs or target genes that map to this plasmid. RR, response regulator; sRNA, small RNA.

DVU0539, DVU0621, and DVU1083 (PhoB). Lactate is
the primary electron donor and carbon source for
Desulfovibrio spp., and the genome of D. vulgaris Hildenborough encodes several lactate permeases, lactate
dehydrogenases, and pyruvate oxidation genes. Since
DVU3025-3033 is so highly regulated, it is likely that it
is the primary pathway for lactate utilization. These
genes were also observed to be highly expressed in the
tiling array data (Figure S1 in Additional file 3) [19].
This operon additionally contains the ack gene encoding
acetate kinase, which generates acetate from acetyl
phosphate, the energy generating step in dissimilatory
sulfate reduction. Since acetyl phosphate can act as a

small molecule phosphate donor for RRs [20], having
multiple regulators for this operon may present a
mechanism to modulate acetyl phosphate levels inside
the cell.
The targets for the RR DVU3023 are lactate-pyruvate
oxidation genes DVU3025-3033, and two lactate permeases (Figure 6), suggesting that the corresponding
two component system senses lactate and also plays a
role in lactate utilization. Further, the two lactate permeases targeted by DVU3023 are expressed differently.
Tiling array data indicate that DVU2451 is expressed
highly under normal growing conditions, whereas
DVU3284 is not (Figure S1 in Additional file 3) [19].

regulators as the strain Hildenborough and are not shown in the figure. Orthologs were identified using the ortholog and tree browser functions
on MicrobesOnline. Two RRs, DVU1083 and DVU3220, are conserved in all Desulfovibrio spp. Experimentally validated binding site motifs for the
respective RRs are shown on the right. Motif logos were created using Weblogo [56] by using the sequences shown in Tables S7 (DAP-chip
target based) and S9 (ortholog based) in Additional file 1. DAP, DNA affinity purified; RR, response regulator.

Gene expression correlations show that the two genes
are negatively correlated with each other (Figure S2 in
Additional file 3). DVU3023 may be activating
DVU2451 expression, while repressing DVU3284.

Additionally the lactate permease gene DVU2451 is
also targeted by three RRs -DVU3023, DVU0539 and
DVU2588 (Figure 6). These three RRs, along with
DVU0946, have common targets that may form a

network to fine-tune lactate utilization (see below).
Thus, lactate consumption appears to be affected in
response to multiple stresses or environmental signals.
D. vulgaris encodes paralogous RRs with overlapping
functions

The RRs DVU0539 and DVU0946 are paralogous and
have identical binding sites (Figures 8 and 9), although
their corresponding predicted proximal sensor kinases
are not paralogous. The two RRs appear to auto-regulate
their own expression, and to regulate each other, and
the operon DVU2133-2132. DVU0539 additionally regulates DVU3025-3033, and DVU2451 (Figure 6). Further,
within the regulated candidates, genes in the operon
DVU2133-2132 appear to be paralogs of those in
DVU0943-0944. A gene expression correlation map of
these candidates shows that DVU0539-0540 transcript
levels positively correlate with DVU0542-0545, and
DVU2133-2132, but is negatively correlated with
DVU0943-0946 and with DVU3025-3033 and DVU2451
(Figure S2 in Additional file 3). Tiling array data support

this observation, where during regular growth
DVU0943-0946 genes are well expressed, whereas no
expression of DVU0539-0545 genes was measured (Figure S1 in Additional file 3) [19]. Since DVU3025-3033
and DVU2451 are lactate utilization genes, it is likely
that the functions of the other target genes encoding
hypothetical proteins are also tied in to lactate/pyruvate
utilization. Taken together these RRs and their target
genes present a highly interconnected and feedback controlled regulatory module to control lactate utilization.
Despite identical binding motifs used for DNA binding,
our findings suggest that DVU0539 and DVU0946 regulate genes differently. Additional experiments, such as
the biochemical evaluation of the phosphotransfer from
the respective histidine kinases, may shed more light on
the mechanism of such regulation.
Regulation of lipid A biosynthesis

DVU2934 has a single target, the lpxC gene DVU2917

Figure 9 Validation of predicted binding site motifs using EMSAs. The sequences tested are in Table S6 in Additional file 1. The RRs are
shown by their DVU#. For each RR, a wild type motif (w) and a modified motif (m) were tested. RRs DVU0946 and DVU0539 bind to the same
sequence and are shown in one panel. We used 10 μl of the RR prep in the assay, except for RRs DVU3023 (2 μl), DVU3381 (5 μl) and DVU1083
(5 μl). The gel shift observed using the wild-type motif was titrated away using unlabeled wild-type motif but not the modified motif (shown for
RR DVU2934 in Figure S5 in Additional file 3). RR, response regulator.

Rajeev et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R99
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R99

regulation appears to be primarily via control of LpxC
protein levels. Excess LpxC in these systems is toxic to
the cell, although lpxC is an essential gene [21,22]. Tiling array data for D. vulgaris [19] suggests that lpxC is
highly expressed (Figure S1 in Additional file 3). Regulation by DVU2934 may be an additional mechanism to
fine-tune its expression. DVU2934 is part of an operon
that encodes the histidine kinase DVU2931 and a second RR with a HD-GYP domain (DVU2933), suggesting
that cyclic-di-GMP levels may be used to regulate lipid
A biosynthesis in D. vulgaris.
The phosphate starvation response ties in to DNA
replication, nitrogen metabolism, and cyclic-di-GMP levels

DVU1083 is annotated as the phosphate starvation
response regulator PhoB, and the DAP-chip data support this prediction. Aside from the expected phosphate
ABC transporter genes and phosphate transport regulators (PhoU), its targets include DNA polymerase and
gyrase genes, amino acid transport genes, glutamate
synthase, phosphodiesterase domain (HD/EAL) genes
and also some energy metabolism genes, such as the
alcohol dehydrogenase and the pyruvate oxidation
operon (this also includes the acetate kinase and the
phosphotransacetylase (pta-ack) genes) (Figure 6). The
Pho regulon in other organisms is known to include
members that function outside the direct phosphate
starvation response, such as in nitrogen assimilation
[23], DNA replication [6], and cyclic-di-GMP concentration [24]. The binding site for known PhoB boxes in
other bacteria, particularly E. coli, consists of two 7-bp
direct repeats (consensus CTGTCAT) separated by a 4bp spacer [25,26]. The D. vulgaris PhoB box consensus
is a 6-bp repeat with a 4-bp spacer (c/t)GT(n)AC (Figure 8). DVU1083 regulates the DVU2477-2479 operon
that encodes the pstS-C-A phosphate ABC transporter
genes. The D. vulgaris genome also has another set of
phosphate transporter genes, DVU2667-2663 (pstS-C-AB-ATPase), but interestingly these genes do not have the
binding site motif in their upstream regions and were
not among the peaks for the PhoB DAP-chip assay.
DVU2114 regulates pili assembly

DVU2114 targets the pilin genes DORF39640-DVU2116,
and the operon DVU3342-3345 (Figure 4), which
encodes pilus assembly genes [27]. Pili are regulated by
s54-dependent RRs in other species such as Geobacter
[28], Myxococcus xanthus [29], and Pseudomonas [30].
The type of pilin encoded by DORF39640-DVU2116,
and the genes downstream of DVU2116 (DVU21172126) appear most similar to the pili assembly machinery (cpaA-F, Tad genes) found in C. crescentus [31].
DVU1063 appears to be a flagella regulator

DVU1063 has a large number of targets for a s54dependent regulator, and among these are some flagellarelated genes (Figure 4), suggesting its role as a flagella

Page 12 of 20

regulator. DVU1063 is homologous to the flagella regulator FlbD in C. crescentus [32], and the binding site
motif (GGCAxxxxTGCC) resembles that of the C. crescentus FlbD (CCCGGCAxxxxxTGCCGGG), where the
italic bases are those that form contacts directly with
the RR [32]. Scanning the C. crescentus genome with
the D. vulgaris motif identified several of the FlbD-regulated promoters (not shown). Like FlbD, DVU1063 has
an atypical receiver domain that lacks some of the active
site residues of the phosphorylation pocket, and it may
not require activation by phosphorylation. The regulation of cell motility appears to be complex, since other
targets for RR DVU1063 include hypothetical proteins,
regulatory proteins, membrane proteins and
transporters.
Exopolysaccharide and biofilm synthesis is controlled by a
pDV1 plasmid encoded regulator

DVUA0057 has been predicted to regulate genes encoding proteins with a PEP-CTERM (Pro-Glu-Pro carboxyterminal) domain. This domain is predicted to target
proteins for export into the exopolysaccharide layer
[33]. The RR gene itself is encoded on the native pDV1
plasmid in a ten-gene operon that appears related to
exopolysaccharide synthesis. The five predicted PEPCTERM targets [33] for this RR were enriched in the
DAP-chip assay along with several other hits (Figure 5;
Table S5 in Additional file 1). The pDV1- D. vulgaris
strain (lacking the native plasmid) produces three-fold
less biofilm than the wild type, and the wild-type biofilm
also contains less carbohydrate and more protein filaments [34]. It is possible that DVUA0057 is involved in
biofilm formation and that the PEP-CTERM proteins
are an integral part of the biofilm. Expression correlations show that most of the PEP-CTERM proteins are
positively correlated with each other and DVUA0057
(Figure S3 in Additional file 3). The RRs DVU0804 and
DVU0110 have a few overlapping targets with
DVUA0057 (Figure 5), and may also be involved in
similar functions.
A three-component system for modulating general stress
responses

DVU3305 may be part of a three-component system
that includes a HK, DVU3304, and another RR,
DVU3303, that has an unusual domain structure containing a lon protease. DVU3305 regulates its own
operon as well as its upstream genes DVU3302-3298,
which encode membrane and hypothetical proteins,
some of which have UspA type domains (Figure 6;
Table S5 in Additional file 1). The two operons have
good expression correlation to each other (Figure S3 in
Additional file 3). DVU3303-3305 and/or DVU32983302 are upregulated during various stresses, such as
high pH [35], heat shock [36], and stationary phase [37].
DVU3303 may require phosphorylation to be protease-

Rajeev et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R99
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R99

active, which in turn may be part of the general stress
response. The other targets for this RR are the operon
DVU2822-2825, which encodes a putative dicarboxylate
transporter and pyruvate formate lyase genes, and the
high affinity potassium transporter DVU3334-3339 (see
below).
Potassium uptake genes are controlled by multiple RRs

DVU3334 regulates its own operon, encoding the high
affinity potassium uptake genes (kdpFABC). The HK in
this operon appears to be split into two ORFs, with
DVU3336 having the K + sensor domain and an UspA
domain, and DVU3335 having the HK dimerization and
phosphoacceptor domain. Interestingly, two other RRs
also target the Kdp operon - DVU0596 and DVU3305 suggesting that potassium uptake is a response to other
stresses as well. The putative binding sites for DVU3305
and DVU3334 upstream of the Kdp genes also overlap
(Table S9 in Additional file 1).
DVU0596 has a LytR type DBD, and its other targets
are two copies of a putative carbon starvation (cstA)
gene that lie downstream of this RR-HK operon. In E.
coli the cstA gene is upregulated upon exhaustion of
carbon source in the medium, and appears to be a peptide permease. Activated DVU0596 may also function by
regulating the putative cstA. Presumably due to the regulation of the DVU3334-3339 Kdp operon by multiple
RRs, the genes in this operon do not demonstrate simple correlation patterns with the co-cistronic RR
DVU3334 (Figure S3 in Additional file 3).
Regulation of acetyl-CoA levels

A second LytR-type RR, DVU0749, has four genes/operons as its targets (Figure 4). DVU2969 is annotated as
an acetyl-CoA synthetase similar to DVU0748, which is
in the same operon as the RR itself. DVU2970 has acylCoA synthetase and acetyltransferase domains. These
seem to suggest that this RR is involved in maintaining
acetyl-CoA levels in the cell. Based on the gene annotations for DVU0443-0448, they may constitute a cAMPdependent membrane transporter or signal transduction
protein. Regulon prediction, based on the gene neighbor
method [17], also associates this operon with DVU2969.
Additionally, DVU0749 has an atypical receiver domain,
with the phosphorylatable aspartic acid replaced by a
glycine. Since it also lacks a proximally encoded HK, it
is likely that this RR is not activated by phosphorylation.
Two component system involved in energy metabolism
regulation

DVU2394 regulates the DVU2405-2397 operon, which
encodes the alcohol dehydrogenase and heterodisulfide
reductase genes (Figure 6). The adh gene is necessary
for growth with ethanol as electron donor, but was also
highly expressed during growth on lactate, pyruvate, formate or hydrogen as the electron donor [38]. The
operon encoding the RR and DVU2405-2397 are

Page 13 of 20

positively correlated, but they appear to be anti-correlated to the other targets DVU3298-3305, which are
part of the general stress response (Figure S3 in Additional file 1).
Response to nitrite stress

Nitrates and nitrites are known to inhibit sulfate reduction, and thus pose a stress for sulfate-reducing bacteria.
DVU0621 targets its upstream genes DVU0624-0625,
which encode a nitrite reductase and are highly upregulated in the presence of nitrite [39,40]. The nitrite
reductase protein has been crystallized and biochemically shown to reduce nitrite as well as sulfite [41,42].
The tiling array data indicate DVU0624-0625 to be
highly expressed in the absence of nitrite (Figure S1 in
Additional file 3) [19], and therefore suggest roles in
addition to responding to nitrite stress. DVU0621 also
targets the lactate/pyruvate oxidation genes DVU30253033, and another hypothetical gene, DVU3384.
The nitrogen regulator is the most conserved among
related species

Despite the identification of a target gene via EMSA, no
DAP-chip data could be acquired for RR DVU3220, since
conditions for qPCR enrichment of the target could not
be found. However, DVU3220, along with DVU1083, are
the only two RRs that are conserved in all sequenced
Desulfovibrio and other related genomes as well (Figure
8). DVU1083 is the phosphate regulator, and it seems
likely that DVU3220 is the nitrogen regulator. The identification (by EMSA; Figure 3) of DVU1231-1234, the
operon encoding the ammonium transporter, the nitrogen regulatory protein PII, and the P-II uridylyltransferase, as its target supports this hypothesis.
Regulation through sRNAs

The RR DVU0679 has as its target a sRNA that lies
downstream of the RR gene (Figure 4) that has been
annotated as Dv_sRNA2 (Bender, personal correspondance). Tiling array data [19] confirm the expression of
this sRNA during normal growth (Figure S1 in Additional file 3), but its function is unknown. The validated
binding site motif is present in other unique DAP-chip
hits, which are not in upstream regions but may be physiologically relevant. It may be that there are as yet
undiscovered non-coding RNAs present near these binding sites, or that binding within coding regions or within
an operon presents additional ways of modulating
expression of the target genes [43].
Functional validation using reporter assays

For several of the RRs, the corresponding target promoters were tested using in vivo transcriptional reporter
analysis. Examination of two component system RRs in
D. vulgaris would require the knowledge of the activating signals. To bypass this requirement, we sought to
examine the binding specificity in the heterologous host

Rajeev et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R99
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R99

Page 14 of 20

strong indicator of similar function. Orthologs of D. vulgaris RRs could be tracked in several other genomes (Figure 8). We screened 23 sequenced genomes that
contained orthologs of any of the D. vulgaris Hildenborough RRs for the presence of conserved binding motifs
and target genes. These included six Desulfovibrio genomes, specifically, the closely related D. vulgaris Miyazaki,
D. desulfuricans G20, D. salexigens, the magnetotactic D.
magneticus, the rumen isolate D. desulfuricans 27774 and
the human isolate D. piger. Two RRs that are conserved in
all these species were DVU1083, the phosphate regulator,
and DVU3220, a possible nitrogen regulator. DVU3220 is
also conserved in some of the other sulfate-reducing bacteria we examined, namely Desulfomicrobium baculatum,
Desulfohalobium retbaense, Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, and Desulfotalea
psychrophila (Figure 8).
DVU3023, the lactate responsive RR in D. vulgaris, is
conserved in all the environmental Desulfovibrio isolates,
as well as D. baculatum, D. retbaense and D. psychrophila, where the binding site motif is also conserved
upstream of the central lactate-pyruvate oxidation genes.
Similarly, the alcohol dehydrogenase regulator DVU2394
is also conserved in many of the sulfate reducers,
although the validated motif for D. vulgaris Hildenborough was only found in D. vulgaris Miyazaki (Figure 8).

E. coli. The assay utilized two compatible plasmids:
pETDEST42, which expressed the RR from an IPTGinducible promoter; and pBbS2K-RFP, which expressed
the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene under the control
of the target D. vulgaris promoter (Materials and methods; Figure S4 in Additional file 3). Expression of RRs in
the reporter strains was confirmed using anti-His immunoblots (Figure S4 in Additional file 3).
As shown in Figure 10, activation of expression was
observed for several RR-promoter combinations. In the
case of the two paralogous RRs DVU0946 and DVU0539,
both showed transcription from the promoter
pDVU0542. Interestingly, RR DVU0539 decreased the
background activity of pDVU3025, suggesting that it may
act as a transcriptional repressor at this promoter (Figure
10). Not all constructs tested provided meaningful results
(Figure S4 in Additional file 3), which could be due to
several reasons, such as the absence of a required transcriptional factor, insufficient RR phosphorylation and
leaky promoters. However, using the heterologous E. coli
background did allow us to confirm functional transcription of several target genes by the corresponding RRs.

The flagella regulator DVU1063 is conserved among
the Desulfovibrio spp., being absent in only the nonmotile D. piger. It is also present in the related pathogen
Lawsonia intracellularis and in D. baculatum, and the
binding site motif is also conserved upstream of several
flagella and motility related genes in these species
(Table S9 in Additional file 1). The pili assembly regulator DVU2114 and its binding site motif upstream of
pilin genes are conserved in only a few species - D. vulgaris Miyazaki, D. desulfuricans G20 and Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans (also a sulfate reducer with propionate
as electron donor). A DVU2114 ortholog is also present
in D. magneticus, but this genome lacks the target pilin
genes and a similar binding site motif was present
upstream of a different gene (Table S9 in Additional file
1).
Orthologs of the paralogous RRs DVU0946 and
DVU0539 and their binding site motifs are conserved in
all the environmental Desulfovibrio spp. as well as other
sulfate reducers such as D. baculatum, D. retbaense and
D. alkenivorans (Figure 8). Interestingly, D. vulgaris
Miyazaki and D. retbaense also have paralogous copies
for this RR. The orthologs in D. desulfuricans G20 and
D. vulgaris Miyazaki present a case where the motif
occurs upstream of additional genes different from
those identified in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. These
genomes have the motif upstream of orthologs of the
target DVU0943, but they also have it upstream of a
putative split soret cytochrome c precursor gene that is
not a target in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (Table S9 in
Additional file 1). These additional genes may be true
targets for the respective RRs, and our genome scans
can be a valuable tool for identifying potential targets.
DVU2934, which targets lipid A biosynthesis, has several orthologs, including those found in non-sulfate
reducers such as Geobacter lovleyi and Acidobacterium
capsulatum. However, the validated motif was present
upstream of the target lpxC gene only in D. vulgaris
Miyazaki and D. desulfuricans G20 (Figure 8; Table S9
in Additional file 1). It is possible that the other RRs
may have evolved to have different functional roles.
Alternately, the RR may have diverged to recognize a
different motif upstream of the same target. Suggestive
of this latter occurrence, in S. fumaroxidans, the lpxC
gene is directly upstream of the ortholog RR operon,
suggesting that its regulation is likely to be linked to the
orthologous RR despite the absence of the motif.
Orthologs for the general stress responsive RR
DVU3305 are present in some of the Desulfovibrio species, D. baculatum and D. retbaense, and also in less
related species such as Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii,
Thioalkalivibrio spp. and Dechloromonas aromatica. In
most of these genomes, the RR is also associated with
the lon-protease RR ortholog of DVU3303, and the

Page 15 of 20

binding site is also conserved, indicating that their functions are likely to be related (Figure 8; Table S9 in Additional file 1).
The potassium responsive RR DVU3334 has orthologs
only in D. vulgaris Miyazaki and S. fumaroxidans, where
the motif is also conserved (Figure 8). Interestingly,
other Desulfovibrio species and sulfate reducers do not
have the high affinity potassium uptake Kdp genes.
The sRNA regulating RR DVU0679 has orthologs in
some of the Desulfovibrio species and in another sulfate
reducer, Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans, and in Syymbiobacterium thermophilum. Genome scans show that a
target sRNA with a conserved binding site may lie
downstream of the RR orthologs in D. vulgaris Miyazaki
and D. desulfuricans G20 (Table S9 in Additional file 1),
suggesting that sRNA regulation is a function of these
orthologous RRs as well. Genome scans of D. acetoxidans and S. thermophilum also showed that the highest
scoring hits to the motif were not upstream of coding
regions (Table S9 in Additional file 1).
Other RRs such as DVU1419 and DVU3381, which
target hypothetical genes and therefore have unknown
functions, are conserved along with their binding sites
in closely related species. Orthologs of RRs without
binding site motif predictions, specifically DVU0621,
DVU0653, DVU0804, DVU0744, DVU2675, and
DVU2577, are limited to a few of the Desulfovibrio species (Figure 8).
Conservation of RRs in other Deltaproteobacteria,
such as Geobacter species and the myxobacteria, are
shown in Figure 8. Three RRs do not have any other
Desulfovibrio orthologs, although orthologs may be present in more distant species. These include DVU1156
and the pDV1 encoded DVUA0137, with no functional
predictions from our study, and DVU2588, which may
be involved in lactate utilization. The binding site motif
for DVU2588 is also conserved in S. fumaroxidans and
A. capsulatus but is present upstream of genes different
from those in D. vulgaris (Figure 8; Table S9 in Additional file 1).

Conclusions
Prior to our study, very little was known about the two
component regulatory network in sulfate-reducing bacteria. Here we provide a fairly comprehensive map of
genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the majority
of the two component systems in this model sulfatereducing organism (Figure 7). Our results include 200
target genes for 24 response regulators and provide
strong predictions for the corresponding two component systems that include the regulation of cell motility
(flagella and pili), exopolysaccharide production, energy
metabolism (lactate utilization, alcohol dehydrogenase
regulation, acetyl-CoA levels), lipid A synthesis, nitrogen

Rajeev et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R99
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R99

and phosphate metabolism, and in the responses to
stresses such as low potassium, nitrite and carbon starvation. Functions such as lactate utilization and potassium uptake genes are regulated by multiple RRs and
appear central to the stress response in D. vulgaris. In
addition, the experimentally confirmed binding motifs
for several of these RRs could also be used to assess
gene targets and function of the orthologs of these regulators in related bacteria. With the exception of a few
RRs (for example, DVU1083 (PhoB) and DVU2934),
most of the DBD-containing RRs encoded in D. vulgaris
Hildenborough appear to be unique to the sequenced
Desulfovibrio species and closely related sulfate reducers.
This suggests that responses modulated by most two
component systems in these sulfate reducing bacteria
are unique to the ecological niches they occupy. In addition, the significant numbers of hypothetical proteins
and genes with unknown functions amongst the regulated candidates indicate that there remains a lot to be
learnt about the environmental stresses faced in these
ecosystems. Deeper knowledge of stress response and
regulation in these environments is required for robust
bioremediation approaches and a better understanding
of biogeochemical processes mediated by these bacteria.

beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside), and then grown at RT
for 24 hours. The cells were pelleted, and resuspended
in HisTrapFF wash/binding buffer (40 mM imidazole,
500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4).
Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and 1X Novagen’s benzonase
nuclease were added to the cell suspension. The cells
were lysed using a French Press at 4°C, and the cell
lysate was clarified by spinning at 10, 000 rpm at 4°C.
To check for over-expression, a sample was run on 4 to
12% Bis-Tris gel, the gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and a western blot was performed
with mouse anti-6X His-tag antibodies. Prior to purification using the AKTA Explorer, the clarified lysate was
filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. The lysate was
loaded onto a 1 ml HisTrapFF column (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) that had been equilibrated with
HisTrapFF wash/binding buffer (10 ml). The column
was washed with 20 ml of the wash buffer, and then
eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 100% elution buffer
(500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.4). The pooled protein fractions were
stripped of imidazole using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting
column (GE Healthcare) and washing with a desalting
buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH
7.4). The protein preps were concentrated using a high
molecular weight cutoff spin filter, and glycerol (50%)
and DTT (0.1 mM) were added to the preparations for
storage. Examples of purified proteins are shown in Figure S6 in Additional file 3.

D. vulgaris Hildenborough was grown on LS4D medium
[44], and the cell pellet was used to purify genomic
DNA with the Qiagen Genomic DNA buffer kit, and the
Qiagen midi column (tip 100/G). The response regulator
gene was PCR amplified and cloned into the entry vector pENTR™/SD/D-TOPO (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) with forward primers carrying the 5’
sequence CACC. A list of primers used for cloning the
genes is in Table S11 in Additional file 1. The entry
clone was transformed into Invitrogen’s OneShot Top10
chemically competent cells, and selected on LB-Kanamycin plates. Sequencing was used to confirm the presence of the insert. The expression construct was
generated by performing an LR recombination reaction
(Gateway LR Clonase II, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) with the destination vector pETDEST42 (Invitrogen) such that the RR gene is expressed
with a carboxy-terminal V5-epitope and a 6X His-tag.
The final construct was transformed into E. coli BL21
Star (DE3) OneShot chemically competent cells (Invitrogen), and selected on LB-Amp plates. Sequencing was
used to confirm the presence of the insert.

Oligonucleotides (oligos; unlabeled and 5’-biotinylated)
were ordered from IDT, San Diego, CA, USA. Full
length (200 to 400 bp) upstream regions of target genes
(Figure 3) were prepared by PCR amplification from D.
vulgaris Hildenborough genomic DNA using one unlabeled oligo and one 5’-biotin-labeled oligo. A list of oligos is given in Table S2 in Additional file 1. The biotinlabeled substrates were then gel-purified from agarose
gels using Qiaquick gel extraction kits (Qiagen Inc,
Valencia, CA, USA). Substrates for validating binding
site motifs (Figure 9) were prepared by annealing oligos
carrying the motif to be tested and approximately 10 bp
on either side (Table S6 in Additional file 1). The top
strand biotinylated oligo was mixed with a slight excess
of unlabeled bottom strand oligo in 10 mM Tris HCl,
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl, and heated to
95°C for 5 minutes followed by slow cooling to 25°C.
The annealed substrate was then diluted to 1 pmol/μl.

Protein expression and purification

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay

The E. coli BL21 (DE3) pETDEST42-RR strains were
grown on LB-carbenicillin at 37°C. At mid-log phase,
the cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-

EMSAs were performed using the Pierce Lightshift chemiluminescent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford,

mixed with 50 to 100 fmol of biotinylated DNA in 10
mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl 2 and 25% glycerol. Poly dI-dC (1 μg/ml) was
added as a non-specific competitor. The reactions were
incubated at 25 to 30°C for 20 minutes, and the reactions were loaded on a pre-cast mini 6% polyacrylamide-0.5X TBE gel (Life Technologies), and run at 100
V at room temperature. The gels were transferred to a
nylon membrane by semi-dry blotting (BioRad, Hercules, CA), the nylon membranes were UV cross-linked
for 3 minutes, and the blot was developed using the
Pierce Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blot was scanned using
the Typhoon 8600 Imager (Molecular Dynamics/Amersham Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ, USA)).
Binding reactions with genomic DNA and DNA affinity
purification

D. vulgaris Hildenborough genomic DNA was prepared
using a Qiagen genomic tip and genomic buffer set. The
DNA was sheared by sonication to an average length of
500 bp. Binding reactions (100 μl) were set up with 2 to 3
μg of sheared genomic DNA, and the appropriate
amount of purified response regulator, in 10 mM Tris
HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM acetyl
phosphate and 25% glycerol. The amount of protein used
in the binding reactions was determined based on activity
of protein in EMSAs (Table S3 in Additional file 1).
Acetyl phosphate was used as a generic method to activate the RRs based on protocols described in the literature [20]. The reactions were incubated at 25°C in a
thermal cycler for 30 minutes; 10 μl of the reaction was
saved as input DNA. The rest was allowed to bind to 30
μl of Ni-NTA resin that had been washed in the binding/
wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 50
mM KCl, 25% glycerol). After 30 minutes of binding, the
tubes were spun down to remove the unbound DNA.
The resin was washed three times in 100 μl of the wash
buffer, and then the bound DNA was eluted with 35 μl of
elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8,
500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole); 35 μl of this elution buffer was also added to the input DNA. The input
and the enriched DNA fractions were cleaned up using
Qiaquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen Inc).
Whole genome amplification

The input and enriched DNA samples (10 μl; after clean
up) were subjected to whole-genome amplification using
Sigma WGA2 kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)).
Since the starting material was sheared genomic DNA,
the first fragmentation heat step was omitted and the
number of amplification cycles was increased to 20 as
per the manufacturer’s suggestions. The amplified

Page 17 of 20

samples were cleaned up using Qiagen spin columns
and quantified using the nanodrop.
Quantitative PCR

qPCR was performed on the whole genome amplified
input and enriched DNA samples using the PerfectA
Sybr Green Mix with ROX (Quanta Biosciences,
Gaithursburg, MD, USA). The DNA samples were
diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μl, and 5 μl of each
sample was used as the template. The primers used for
qPCR of target upstream regions are listed in Table S2
in Additional file 1. Each reaction was done in triplicate. Delta CT was calculated as the difference in the
C T values of the input and enriched samples (ΔC T =
CT (input) - CT (enriched). Fold enrichment was calculated as 2 ΔCt . If the target was found to be at higher
amounts in the enriched sample, then the samples
were Cy3/Cy5 labeled and hybridized to the chip. If no
enrichment of the target was observed, then the DAPwhole-genome amplification steps were repeated under
different conditions (usually by varying the protein
amount) until enrichment was obtained. For each RR
tested, the upstream region of a randomly selected
gene was also tested to ensure that non-specific gene
targets were not enriched. For most RRs, the negative
control used was the upstream region of DVU0013.
The exceptions were DVU3234 used for RR DVU1083,
DVU0599 used for RR DVU1063, and DVU1083 used
for RR DVU0946.
DNA labeling and hybridization

Cy3- and Cy5-labeled 9-mers were obtained from Trilink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA, USA). One microgram each of the input and enriched DNA was labeled
with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, using Klenow polymerase (3’-5’ exo-, 50, 000 U/ml, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) at 37°C for 2 hours in the dark. The
reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mM. The DNA was precipitated using
NaCl and isopropanol, and the pellet was rinsed in 80%
ethanol, and air-dried. The pellets were resuspended in
25 μl water, and quantified using the nanodrop. Six
micrograms each of the Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA
were pooled together, and vacuum dried. The pellet was
resuspended in 5 μl water, and hybridized overnight at
42°C to a custom D. vulgaris Hildenborough 385K tiling
array (Roche-Nimblegen, Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The tiling array used 50-mer
probes with a 46-bp overlap in the intergenic regions,
and a 20-bp overlap in the coding regions. The slides
were washed, and scanned on a GenePix 4200A scanner.
Each slide was scanned at wavelengths of 532 and 635
nm, and the images were saved separately.

Data analysis to generate binding site peaks

Nimblescan software v.2.4 (Roche-Nimblegen) was used
to grid the 532 and 635 nm images, and to generate the
pair files that contain signal intensities for each probe on
the array. Scaled log2R ratios were then computed for the
probes. Nimblescan then used a sliding window of 500
bp to search for peaks that have more than four probes
above a cutoff value. The cutoff value is a percentage of
the hypothetical maximum log2R ratio (mean + 6 standard deviation) that starts at the most stringent value of
90% and decreases in steps of 1 to 15%. The ratio data
are randomized 20 times to evaluate the possibility of
false positives. As the method to estimate the FDR scores
for the peaks, we chose to optimize for strong peaks of
varied width. The peak file generated by Nimblescan
gives the location of the peak (genomic or plasmid), the
start and end loci for the peak, a score that is the log2R
ratio for the fourth highest probe in the peak, the cutoff
percentage (cutoff_p) at which the peak was identified,
and the FDR score for the peak. We used MicrobesOnline [16] to map the peak loci to the upstream regions of
the gene targets. Nimblescan guidelines state that FDR
scores of 0 to 0.05 are indicative of a high-confidence
binding site, while peaks with scores of up to 0.2 may
also be considered as binding sites. Since our DAP-chip
data sets had a large number of peaks with FDR scores
less than 0.2, a combination of high log2 R scores, high
cutoff_p values, and low FDR scores was used to identify
the most likely targets for each RR. The list of targets
presented in Table S5 in Additional file 1 and Figures 4,
5 and 6 is a conservative estimate of the most likely targets. Peaks falling within coding regions, or those that
appear in multiple DAP-chip sets, or those with lower
scores or higher FDR values were not considered unless
they were also found to carry a binding site motif, or
appeared to be functionally related to the other top
peaks. For DVU1083, where the positive target did not
appear in the top hits, DAP-chip was conducted in triplicate and the common hits from the three sets were
pooled together to generate a target list. The array data
have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO:GSE25163] [45].
Binding site motif predictions for the RRs

MEME was used (through MicrobesOnline [16] and
The Meme Suite [46]) to predict motifs in the
upstream regions. For each RR, motif predictions were
run on the upstream regions of the positive target
orthologs, and for those RRs that had more than one
target MEME was also run on the upstream regions of
the target hits obtained from the DAP-chips. Genomes
of interest were scanned for the resulting motif using

Page 18 of 20

Perl scripts based on the methods as described in Rhodius et al. [47].
Sigma54 promoter predictions

The rpoN matrix was downloaded from Promscan [48].
Promscan generated an rpoN matrix based on the s54
promoter sequences in more than 80 bacterial species
[49]. We used the Perl script to determine the s54 promoters of D. vulgaris. Additionally, to test specific
upstream regions, we ran the sequence on the Promscan
website directly. A list of s54-promoters that are regulated by RRs is given in Table S10 in Additional file 1.
Construction of pBbS2K-promoter-RFP plasmids

Promoter regions (300 bp upstream) of selected D. vulgaris genes were PCR amplified using primers (Table S12
in Additional file 1) that have a 20-bp overlap with the
target vector. The kanamycin-resistant vector pBbS2KRFP contains the RFP gene under the control of the Ptet
promoter and tetR gene. The RFP gene is repressed by
TetR, and can be induced using anhydrotetracycline
(aTC). The vector pBbS2K-RFP was PCR amplified using
promoter-specific primers that have a 20-bp overlap with
the promoter of interest (Table S12 in Additional file 1)
and the promoters were cloned in by the Gibson method
[50] downstream of the Ptet and upstream of rfp such
that they replace the native ribosome binding site. The
Gibson reaction was used to transform E. coli Top10
electrocompetent cells and transformants were selected
on LB-Kan-aTC plates and red-white screening was used
to pick positive colonies. Sequencing was used to confirm
the presence of the promoter insert in the pBbS2K-promoter-RFP constructs.
RFP reporter assay in E. coli

E. coli BL21 (DE3) electrocompetent cells were transformed
with equal amounts of pBbS2K-promoter-RFP (pSC101 ori,
KanR) and pETDEST42-RR (pBR322 ori, AmpR) plasmids
(Figure S4 in Additional file 3), and the transformants were
selected on LB-Kan-carbenicillin plates. The colonies were
adapted to M9 minimal media as described previously [51].
Overnight cultures grown in M9-Kan-Carb were subcultured 1:100 in fresh media and grown at 37°C for 2 hours.
The cultures were induced with 50 μM IPTG and 1 ml of
each culture (in triplicate) was transferred to a 24-well plate
and the plate was incubated with shaking at 25°C in a
Tecan Infinite 200 instrument (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) for 24 hours. Cell growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 590 nm. RFP fluorescence was measured
at 535 nm (excitation) and 610 nm (emission). Relative
fluorescence units (RFU) were calculated as the ratio of
RFP fluorescence to cell growth.
