Abstract
Background: The medfly, Ceratitis capitata, is a highly invasive agricultural pest that has become a
model insect for the development of biological control programs. Despite research into the
behavior and classical and population genetics of this organism, the quantity of sequence data
available is limited. We have utilized an expressed sequence tag (EST) approach to obtain detailed
information on transcriptome signatures that relate to a variety of physiological systems in the
medfly; this information emphasizes on reproduction, sex determination, and chemosensory
perception, since the study was based on normalized cDNA libraries from embryos and adult
heads.
Results: A total of 21,253 high-quality ESTs were obtained from the embryo and head libraries.
Clustering analyses performed separately for each library resulted in 5201 embryo and 6684 head
transcripts. Considering an estimated 19% overlap in the transcriptomes of the two libraries, they
represent about 9614 unique transcripts involved in a wide range of biological processes and
molecular functions. Of particular interest are the sequences that share homology with Drosophila
genes involved in sex determination, olfaction, and reproductive behavior. The medfly transformer2
(tra2) homolog was identified among the embryonic sequences, and its genomic organization and
expression were characterized.
Conclusion: The sequences obtained in this study represent the first major dataset of expressed
genes in a tephritid species of agricultural importance. This resource provides essential information
to support the investigation of numerous questions regarding the biology of the medfly and other
related species and also constitutes an invaluable tool for the annotation of complete genome
sequences. Our study has revealed intriguing findings regarding the transcript regulation of tra2 and
other sex determination genes, as well as insights into the comparative genomics of genes
implicated in chemosensory reception and reproduction.

Background
The medfly, Ceratitis capitata, is a highly invasive agricultural pest species that has expanded from its native range
in sub-Saharan Africa to become a cosmopolitan species
in less than 200 years. Its success as an invasive species is
partially due to its unusually wide host range and its ability to adapt to a wide range of climatic conditions and
habitats [1]. As such, it has become the target of extensive
control programs and a model organism for the sterile
insect technique (SIT), a method considered to be among
the most efficient and environmentally friendly control
procedures [2,3]. This technique, designed to reduce the
size of the target population, is based on the release of
sterile males that compete for wild females. Indeed, the
medfly was the first non-drosophilid organism to be
transformed [4], with the goal of introducing genes capable of improving genetic sexing systems for the SIT.
Although molecular genetics studies of the medfly began
in the early 1990s, at present (January 2008) only 182
putative coding sequences are known, almost half of
which are fragmentary [5]. This lack of molecular data is
in sharp contrast to the mass of data that has been accrued
on the classical and population genetics of this model
insect.
The number of published complete genome sequences
has grown exponentially since the first two bacterial
genomes were reported in 1995, with over 600 available
as of 2008 [6]. These genome sequences include a number
of important insect genomes, such as those of Drosophila
melanogaster, the malarial mosquito, Anopheles gambiae,
the silkworm Bombyx mori, and the honeybee Apis mellifera
[7-10]. Numerous other insect genome-sequencing
projects are in progress, including those for numerous
species of Drosophila, mosquitoes of the genera Aedes,
Anopheles and Culex, the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa
armigera, the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens, the
human louse Pediculus humanus, the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus, the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans, the
sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis, parasitic wasps of the genus
Nasonia, the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, and several
aphids and ticks [6,11,12].

relatively quick and inexpensive technology for discovering new genes, for obtaining data on their expression and
regulation, and for the construction of genome maps [13].
They are an ideal means for the rapid exploration of transcriptomes, especially those of species with large genome
sizes. ESTs can also form a very solid basis for evolutionary studies.
The genetic information obtained from this EST initiative
will be of enormous value for identifying and determining
the functions of genes involved in a number of important
biological processes, including sex determination, sex differentiation, reproduction, courtship behavior, and olfaction. Such processes represent ideal targets for the
development of novel control methods and pest-monitoring systems. To target these biological processes we have
utilised cDNA libraries derived from medfly embryos and
adult heads as the source of our ESTs. The embryo library
permits the identification of genes involved in sex determination and development whereas the head library permits the identification of genes involved in different
behaviours, in olfaction etc. The availability of a large
number of transcripts also permits the development of
oligonucleotide-based microarrays that will facilitate the
study of these biological processes by means of mass
expression profile analyses.
Apart from its economic importance, the medfly also represents an alternative model dipteran species. Drosophila
melanogaster is the model dipteran par excellence, but in
many ways it is an atypical species. The availability of
mosquito genomes has helped to balance this bias, and
hopefully the medfly data presented here will also contribute to that end.
Here we present a comprehensive EST-based gene discovery project that has provided sequences of 11,885 transcripts and yielded novel insights into various biological
activities of an important agricultural pest, the medfly.

Results and Discussion

The initial goal of these genome sequence projects is to
identify a complete set of genes and subsequently to determine their expression in different life stages and tissues
and to characterize their regulation and function. Given
that the haploid genome size of the medfly is relatively
large (540 Mb), three times larger than that of D. melanogaster, the sequencing of the complete genome would
be prohibitively expensive except by a large consortium.

Generation and assembly of medfly embryo and head ESTs
Two unidirectional, normalized cDNA libraries were constructed from embryos ranging in age from 30 min to 36
hr after oviposition and from adult male and female
heads of flies ranging from 30 min to 8 days after emergence. Thus, the embryo library is representative of the
transcriptome of embryos at different stages of development. The head library is representative of the transcriptome of adult heads of both sexes and different
physiological states (immature, virgin, mated).

To address the lack of sequence data available for the
medfly, we have initiated a functional genomics approach
based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs represent a

A total of 24,030 random cDNA clones from the two
libraries were sequenced from the 5' end. These
sequences, once trimmed of vector, contaminants, and

low-quality sequences, yielded a total of 21,253 highquality masked ESTs, with an average length of 700 bp for
the embryo sequences and 723 bp for the head sequences,
and representing over 15 megabases of medfly sequence.
The sequences from the two libraries were assembled separately using the Phrap program [14]: 7,173 of the embryo
ESTs were assembled into 2,107 contiguous sequences
(contigs), and the remaining 3,094 ESTs that were not
redundant were classified as singlets. For the head ESTs,
assembly resulted in 2,785 contigs (from 7087 ESTs) and
3,899 singlets. Contigs and singlets derived from the
embryo ESTs are given the prefixes FC and FS, respectively,
followed by a number. The head contigs and singlets have
the prefixes HC and HS, respectively. The phrap program
produces contigs consisting of a single-read which represent sequences that produced a match with other
sequences but that could not be consistently assembled
with these other reads. The highest number of ESTs in a
single contig was 206 (HC2785), but very few contigs contained more than 10 ESTs. The distribution of the ESTs in
contigs and singlets is illustrated in Table 1.
Almost 55% of the assembled embryo sequences and 29%
of the assembled head sequences contained open reading
frames (ORFs) with start codons that potentially encode
at least 150 amino acids. However, given that ESTs are single-read sequences and that 5'-truncated cDNA inserts are
not uncommon, we obtained a less stringent estimate of
69% for the embryo sequences and 36% for the head
sequences when the presence or absence of the start codon
was ignored (Table 1).
The sequences that lacked a putative ORF produced 43%
hits in the case of the embryo library and only 19% hits
for the head library. Of the assembled sequences containing a putative ORF, 89% of those derived from both the
head and the embryo libraries had BLASTX matches in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/243

non-redundant (nr) database. Subsequent TBLASTX analyses against the insecta set of EST sequences in the dbEST
database increased this percentage to 91% in the embryo
and 92% in the head. This finding suggests that perhaps
9% of the medfly transcripts, from the embryo or head,
are highly divergent from their homologs in other organisms. It is probable that many of the sequences without
putative ORFs and BLAST matches are non-coding
sequences and may represent 5' or 3' UTRs.
Consistent with the expectation that the cDNA clones
were sequenced from the 5' end, 98.4% of the assembled
embryo sequences and 93.8% of the head sequences with
hits in the nr database were encoded on the forward
strand. The small proportion of assembled sequences that
appeared to be encoded on the reverse strand may be the
result of the cDNA being inserted in the opposite direction in the vector.
Almost 75% of the assembled embryo sequences and 44%
of the assembled head sequences produced BLASTX hits
against the nr database with an expectation, e, of less than
10-5. Well over 90% of the best hits were arthropodderived sequences. Not surprisingly, of these arthropod
sequences, 90% were Drosophila sequences, and of these,
more than half pertained to D. melanogaster (Additional
file 1, Table S1).
Only 58 of the best hits (18 for embryo and 40 for head
sequences) were against C. capitata sequences, a finding
that reflects the scarcity of medfly sequences in the databases (Additional file 2, Table S2). BLASTN analysis
showed that three of the 13 sequences identified from a
medfly male accessory gland cDNA library [GenBank:DQ406807, DQ406810, DQ406812] [15] were represented in the embryo (FC2089) and head assembled
sequences (HC1979, HC2078, HC2666, HC2668). This
finding has no bearing on the specificities of our libraries

as all three genes (Antigen-r5, Jafrac1 and virus-induced
RNA 1) are putatively involved in the immune pathway
and in Drosophila are expressed in embryos and/or other
adult tissues including the head.
Fifteen of the embryonic assembled sequences and 44 of
the head sequences appeared to be of viral origin. Thirteen
assembled sequences showed significant amino acid similarity to the polyproteins of the sacbrood [GenBank:AAT45735] and 16 to the Kakugo viruses
[GenBank:NC_005876] previously identified in the honeybee. Another three sequences showed significant amino
acid similarity to a virus polyprotein sequence isolated
from Varroa destructor mites living on honeybee larvae.
Twenty-three sequences showed significant amino acid
identity to a cysteine-rich repetitive sequence in the U88
gene of the human herpesvirus 6 [GenBank:NC_001664]
and another similarity to a highly repetitive sequence
within the latency associated antigen gene of the ovine
herpesvirus 2 [GenBank:AAL05844]. Single sequences
showed similarity with the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase region of the 183-kDa protein of the Odontoglossum ringspot virus, the polymerase subunit of the
influenza C virus, and the putative viral replicase of the
prune dwarf virus. It is possible that some of these
sequences represent retroviral elements.
Only 20 sequences appeared to have originated from the
fly's bacterial flora, with homology to bacterial sequences
of the genera Bacteroides, Burkholderia, Escherichia, Haemophilus, Magnetococcus, or Staphylococcus.
Sixty three of the transcripts showed significant homology
to transposable elements; 11 of these were from the
embryo library and the remaining 52 from the head
library. The majority of these putative transposable elements belonged to the mariner (44) and Tc1 (15) families
of transposable elements, but elements related to hAT
family (two sequences, one to an element from Danio rerio
and another to hermit from Lucilia cuprina), and to retrotransposons (two sequences related to the D. melanogaster
1731 retrotransposon) were also detected. The best hits
for almost two-thirds of the mariner-like elements identified were previously identified elements from C. capitata
or Ceratitis rosa (e values ranged from 1e-6 to 5e-25) [16].
Annotation of the assembled sequences
The medfly ESTs were annotated with respect to D. melanogaster, which is not only the most extensively annotated
genome but also relatively close to the medfly in evolutionary terms. Both species are members of the Acalyptratae and are estimated to have diverged from a common
ancestor 80 â 100 million years ago [17,18]. Each medfly
assembled sequence and singlet was assigned a gene
ontology (GO) classification based the annotation of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/243

best-hit D. melanogaster peptide obtained in BLASTX
searches; thus, our annotations are at the "inferred from
electronic annotation" (IEA) level of evidence. To avoid
potential compounding of errors, Drosophila annotations
assigned at the IEA level were not considered for the annotation of the medfly ESTs.
Of the 5,201 assembled embryo sequences, 74.5% (3876)
produced best hits with an expectation, e, of <10-5 against
the Drosophila peptide database (containing 19,178 peptides), and 51.9% (2699) were assigned GO annotations.
In the case of the head sequences, 39.6% (2,649 of 6,684)
produced hits, and 31.1% (2,077) were assigned GO
annotations.
The 5,201 embryo-derived and 6,684 head-derived
assembled sequences presumably represent distinct transcripts. However, these numbers are likely to be an overestimate of the actual number of transcripts obtained,
because ESTs derived from the same gene may not have
been assembled into a single contig because of alternative
splicing or sequence polymorphism. A total of 3,876
assembled embryo sequences produced best hits with
3,290 different D. melanogaster genes, suggesting a 15.1%
redundancy in the assembled sequences. Extrapolating
this redundancy value to the complete dataset, we estimate that the 5,201 assembled sequences represent about
4,400 genes expressed in the embryo. Likewise, for the
head sequences, a total of 2,649 assembled medfly head
sequences produced best hits with 2,304 different D. melanogaster genes, a 13% redundancy in the assembled
sequences; thus, the 6,684 assembled sequences may represent about 5,815 genes expressed in the adult head.
Clearly, we can expect that there will be some overlap in
the genes expressed in the sequences derived from the
embryo and head library. To determine the extent of this
overlap, the ESTs from the two libraries were pooled and
reassembled using Phrap. This procedure generated a total
of 9,614 assembled sequences (4,185 contigs and 5,429
singlets). Given that the two libraries when assembled
separately gave rise to a total of 11,885 assembled
sequences, we can estimate that approximately 2,271
sequences were shared between the two libraries, for an
overlap of about 19%.
A summary of the allocation of the annotations to specific
biological processes and molecular functions as classified
by GO is presented in Additional files 3 and 4, Tables S3
and S4. A wide range of processes and functions are represented. Of particular interest in terms of the development
of novel control methods for this pest species are the
annotations related to sex determination, olfaction, and
reproductive behavior.

Genes involved in sex determination
In Drosophila, the primary sex determinant is the ratio of
the number of X chromosomes to the number of sets of
autosomes. When the ratio is 1 (XX:AA), the master switch
gene, Sex lethal (Sxl), is activated and sets in motion a cascade of regulatory genes, transformer (tra), transformer-2
(tra2) and doublesex (dsx), that result in female development. When the ratio is 0.5 (X:AA), Sxl is not activated,
and male development proceeds. Although the medfly sex
determination cascade is only partially characterized, it is
clear that the initial levels differ from those of Drosophila.
In the medfly, the primary sex determinant is a maledetermining factor (M) on the Y chromosome. Thus, XX
embryos develop into females and XY embryos into
males. The medfly homolog of tra, Cctra, acts as the switch
gene rather than the homologue of Sxl, CcSxl. The active
product of the Cctra gene, CcTRA, which is present only in
females, directs female-specific splicing of the doublesex
(dsx) pre-mRNAs [19-21]. In this respect, the medfly sex
determination pathway appears to have a greater affinity
to that of Musca domestica than to that of Drosophila [22].

Of the three sex determination genes previously described
in the medfly, CcSxl, Ccdsx, and Cctra, only CcSxl was
identified among the medfly assembled sequences (Additional file 2, Table S2). However, 24 of the medfly assembled sequences shared homology with 13 Drosophila genes
that have been implicated in sex determination (Table 2).
Of particular interest was the sequence FC1744 from the

embryo library, which shared 57%/73% amino acid identity/homology with the transformer 2 (tra2) sequence of D.
melanogaster. FC1744 appears to be a full-length tra2 transcript. In Drosophila tra2 encodes a splicing regulator protein that contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM)
flanked by two regions rich in arginine and serine residues
(RS domains). The existence of a medfly tra2 homologue,
Cctra2, has been hypothesized [20,21] but has not previously been described. It is thought that the CcTRA2 protein might interact with CcTRA to control both femalespecific splicing of Ccdsx and the positive feedback loop
established by the Cctra gene. The Ccdsx sequence contains conserved TRA/TRA2 binding sites close to the regulated splice site, suggesting that both TRA and TRA2
proteins are involved in the splicing process [20,21].
The genomic sequence of the Cctra2 gene, amplified using
a pair of primers designed in the 5' and 3' UTRs on the
cDNA sequence of FC1744, is over 2.6 kb in length. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed the
presence of eight exons (34 â 176 bp in length) and seven
introns (64 â 834 bp in length). The splice sites all conformed to the GT-AG rule [23]. The positions of the
introns were conserved with respect to the other tephritid
tra-2 sequence from Bactrocera oleae [GenBank:AJ547623]
and that of M. domestica [GenBank:AY847518]. The tra2
gene of D. melanogaster has seven exons rather than the
eight present in Cctra2. This difference appears to be the
result of the presence of an extra intron in Cctra2 within

the Drosophila equivalent of exon 6. Furthermore, only
two of the intron positions were conserved with respect to
the Drosophila tra2. Figure 1 illustrates the cDNA sequence
and the deduced 251 amino acid sequence of Cctra2.
Amino acids 106 to 177 represent an RNA recognition
motif (RRM) (e value, 7e-10) diagnostic of an RNA-binding protein [24]. The RRM is flanked by two arginine-rich/
serine-rich regions (RS domains), which mediate proteinprotein interactions to facilitate the formation of spliceosomal and regulatory splicing complexes [25]. Examination of the four EST sequences that comprise FC1744
revealed no indication of alternative splicing of the Cctra2
gene. RT-PCR analysis of different development stages/tissues (embryos, male and female larvae, adult heads and
adult bodies) with primers located in the 5' UTR and exon
7 produced a single product of about 840 bp in each case,
suggesting that the gene is not alternatively spliced (data
not shown). The gene was expressed in both sexes and in
all the life stages examined, although the transcripts
present in the very early embryos may be of maternal origin. This expression pattern is very similar to that of M.
domestica [22] but very different from that of D. melanogaster where at least five different tra2 transcripts are
known, resulting from alternative promotors and differential splicing [26]. In Drosophila, the somatic transcripts
are not sex-specific but two alternatively spliced transcripts are found only in the male germline [26].
The highest identity/similarity of the Cctra2 amino acid
sequence was with the tra2 homologue from B. oleae
(Botra2) ([GenBank:CAD67988]; 88%/93%). The phylogenetic relationships of the tra2 amino acid sequences
from C. capitata, B. oleae, M. domestica [GenD.
melanogaster
[GenBank:AAW34233],
Bank:AAA62771], D. virilis [GenBank:AAB58114], D.
pseudoobscura [GenBank:XP_001360605], A. mellifera
[GenBank:XP_001121070], Nasonia vitripennis [Genmori
[GenBank:XP_001601106], and Bombyx
Bank:AAX47001] are represented in the neighbor-joining
tree (Figure 2). The sequences cluster according to the taxonomic relationships of the insect species. Thus, Cctra2
clusters with the other tephritid sequence Botra2 from B.
oleae, and the two hymenopteran sequences, Amtra2 and
Nvtra2, form a well-supported cluster, as do the three Drosophila sequences. In both trees, the tra2 products of the
Tephritidae (Acalyptrate) appear to be more closely
related to that of M. domestica (Calyptrate) than to those
of the Drosophilidae (Acalyptrate). This topology is in
agreement with those inferred from glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase [27], white [28], and alcohol dehydrogenase [29] and supports the evolutionary hypothesis in
which the Tephritidae are closer to the Calyptrate Calliphoridae than to the Acalyptrate Drosophilidae [30]. The
greater affinity of the medfly sex-determination system to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/243

that of the housefly than to that of Drosophila is further
evidence of this evolutionary relationship [22].
Apart from their role in sex-determination, tra2 genes are
also involved in male courtship behavior. The TRA2 protein interacts with TRA to regulate splicing of the fruitless
gene (fru). Male-specific fru transcripts are essential for
male courtship behavior [31,32].
Three of the other medfly assembled sequences that are
putatively involved in sex determination share sequence
homology with members of the three classes of primary
X:A signal genes that encode transcription factors that regulate Sxl expression in Drosophila. The sisterless A gene
belongs to the numerator class of primary signal genes
and positively regulates Sxl, whereas deadpan is the only
known denominator gene and negatively regulates Sxl.
The third class of primary signal genes is represented by
groucho, a maternal gene whose product is also a negative
regulator of Sxl. The genes female lethal(2)d and sans fille
are also involved in the autoregulation of Sxl. Intersex is
required for the activity of DSXF, the female transcription
factor product of doublesex [33]. In addition to their potential usefulness in comparative studies of the sex determination pathways, these genes and others expressed during
embryogenesis may be useful for the development of
genetic sexing strains and as targets for pest control programs.
Genes involved in olfaction
The biological success, and hence the economic impact, of
the medfly can be ascribed in part to the sensitivity and
selectivity of its olfactory systems, which are essential for
the location of plant hosts and for the detection of pheromones during the recognition and location of mates
[34].

The olfactory signal transduction cascade in insects is
facilitated by three main groups of molecules: odorantbinding proteins (OBPs), odorant receptors (ORs), and
odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs) [35]. A group of
OBPs, the pheromone binding proteins (PBPs), are
expressed in pheromone-responsive sensilla and bind to
pheromone molecules [36].
OBPs are small, water-soluble proteins that are present in
high concentration in olfactory and gustatory sensilla
[37]. They are thought to solubilize hydrophobic odorant
molecules and transport them through the hydrophilic
environment in the hemolymph to the ORs on the cell
surface. However, given the large number of OBPs present
in many insect species, many of which display different
odorant-binding specificities, it is probable that they play
an active role in odorant recognition, perhaps acting as
selective filters rather than as passive odorant shuttles

[38,39]. Once the odorant/OBP complex has bound to
the receptor, the OBP may be actively involved in terminating signal transmission by inactivating the odorant
molecule [40].
Fifty-one potential OBP genes have been identified in D.
melanogaster [38]. BLASTX analyses identified 29 medfly
sequences with significant hits to 12 different Drosophila
OBP genes (Table 3). All but two of these putative medfly
OBP genes were derived from the head library. Fourteen
of these putative OBPs that produced hits with the Obp99c
gene also gave very significant hits with the previously
identified medfly male-specific serum polypeptide
(MSSP) family of genes [41,42]. These MSSP sequences
are presumably members of the minus-C subfamily of
OBPs, since they do not contain all six of the conserved
cysteine residues that characterize insect OBPs [40]. The
MMSPs, of which there are at least seven members classified into three subgroups, Î±, Î² and Î³, appear to be nonolfactory OBPs, and it has been hypothesized that they
may be involved in the binding and transportation of
male specific sex pheromones [42].

Another putative OBP was identified during the BLASTX
analyses against the nr database. The sequence HS1065,
again a head-derived sequence, shares 71/88% amino
acid identity/similarity (alignment length = 120aa, e = 2E50) with the An. gambiae gene Obp1 [43].
ORs are a group of transmembrane proteins with very
diverse sequences. The OBP/odorant complex interacts
with the OR to initiate signal transmission from the outside of the neuron to the inside. Two putative medfly OR
genes were identified in the head library (Table 4), one
with a complete coding sequence with high amino acid
identity to Drosophila Or83b. Or83b, unlike other OR
genes, is highly conserved in other insects, and its presence is essential for olfaction. In fact, the Or83b homolog
has already been isolated in the medfly [44] (Additional
file 2, Table S2). The other putative medfly OR (HS336)
identified in the head library shares homology with the
Drosophila Or59a gene, which is expressed in the dorsal
organ dome on the larval head, where it is involved in the
detection of food odors, and particularly aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring [45-47]. Or59a appears
not to be expressed in adult Drosophila olfactory organs

[48] but is maximally expressed in the male accessory
glands of adult Drosophila [49]. At least 60 putative OR
genes have been identified in D. melanogaster, of which 43
are expressed in the antenna or maxillary palp [47]. In
mosquitoes, 79 and 131 putative OR genes have been
identified in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, respectively [50,51]. Given the dramatic sequence divergence of
the other ORs between different insect species, it is difficult to identify these sequences by sequence homology,
which may explain why only two OR sequences were
identified in our preliminary screening of the medfly
sequences.
Little is known about the genes involved in reception and
behavior in the medfly. This gene discovery study thus
represents a unique opportunity to explore the molecular
bases of these behavioral traits in the reproductive biology

of this important economic pest species. In the long term,
the results of the study will aid the development of more
efficient sex attractants for the detection, monitoring, and
control of this species [52,53].
Genes involved in reproductive behavior
A total of 27 assembled sequences shared homology with
20 Drosophila genes known to be involved in reproductive
behavior (Table 5). In Drosophila, the majority of these
genes are involved in male courtship behavior. Mutants
for the gene quick-to-court initiate courtship toward virgin
females abnormally quickly and also readily attempt to
court other males [54]. The prospero gene, which is
involved in nervous system development, can alter the age
of onset of sexual behavior in males: Males carrying a single copy of a prospero mutation court and mate precociously [55]. Other mutations can result in little or no

courtship behavior (courtless and takeout) and produce
defects in spermatogenesis (takeout) [56,57]. Mutations in
the dunce and Calcium calmodulin kinase II genes disrupt
the ability of the male to learn to avoid courting males
and mated females [58]. Males with a mutation at one of
the clock genes, timeless, display extended copulation
times [59] and those with the lingerer mutation court and
copulate with females normally, but subsequently have
great difficulty in disengaging their genitalia [60]. Hyperexcitability mutations in the potassium channels encoded
by the Shaker gene result in courtship suppression. Other
mutants such as paralytic and slowpoke affect the sodium
channel and calcium activated potassium channel, respectively, and result in defective courtship song production
[58]. Finally, mutations in a mitochondrial ribosomal
protein gene, technical knockout, result in unsuccessful
male courtship behavior, apparently because of a hearing
impediment [61].

One of the two medfly assembled sequences that may be
involved in female reproductive behavior has homology
to the Drosophila logjam (loj) gene. Females carrying mutations in loj mate normally and store sperm just as normal
females do, but they do not lay eggs. The loj mutation has
no observable effect on male courtship behavior and fertility. The gene encodes a member of a family of putative
vesicle cargo receptor proteins that may mediate the transmission of positive signals for oviposition from the central and ventral nerve cord [62]. The other medfly
sequence that may be involved in female reproductive
behavior has homology to the Sphingosine kinase 2 gene.
Drosophila females with a mutation in this gene have
reduced flight activity and fecundity. The reduced fecundity of these Sk2 mutants is due to retention of mature
eggs in the ovaries, which may be the result of compromised ovarian function or a defect in either sperm storage
or the response to seminal fluid proteins [63].

The reproductive and sexual behavior of the medfly is relatively well studied [64-66]. Receptive females are
attracted to aggregations (leks) of "signaling" males emitting a sex pheromone, which also acts as an attractant for
other males. The male orientates towards the female,
deflects his abdomen ventrally and begins to vibrate his
wings in a continuous manner, apparently wafting a
plume of pheromone from his everted rectal pheromone
sac toward the female. After a while the male switches to
a rhythmic backwards and forwards wing movement
while continuing to vibrate rapidly. At this point the rectal
pheromone sac is retracted, so the male does not appear
to produce pheromone; the female, however, may be
stimulated aurally by the sound of the wing movements
and visually by rapid movements of the male's head. The
male subsequently leaps onto the back of the female,
buzzes his wings, and rocks his body back and forth
before aligning himself to face the same direction as the
female and attempting to copulate. Copulation usually
lasts up to 3 hr. Throughout the courtship, the female can
terminate the affair by merely leaving, dislodging the
male, or by refusing to copulate. After insemination, the
female's behavior changes from mate-searching to hostfruit location for oviposition [64].
The courtship behavior of Drosophila has been studied in
far greater detail and involves a series of steps: orientation,
following, tapping, wing vibration or "singing," and licking (of the female genitalia), followed by tail curling and
copulation [58]. Although the courtship behavior of Drosophila differs from that of the medfly, it is probable that
the underlying genetic bases of these behaviors are sufficiently similar to allow the genes identified to be used to
modify or disrupt the medfly's reproductive behavior.

Conclusion
The sequences obtained in this study represent the first
major dataset of expressed genes in a tephritid species of
agricultural importance. The availability of this resource
will support the investigation of numerous questions
regarding the biology of the medfly. EST libraries represent a rich source of polymorphic markers, be they SSRs or
SNPs, that can be employed in high-throughput genotyping methods for population genetics and ecological studies [67]. The EST sequences will also be of utmost
importance for any future project in which the genome of
this organism is sequenced. In practical terms, the EST
resource represents an arsenal of information that will
allow us to develop new control tools, whether chemical
or genetic, that are aimed at altering sex determination,
reproductive traits and behavior, and host preference. The
identification of these genes in C. capitata will also greatly
facilitate the isolation of homologous genes in other
tephritid species, as the medfly is by no means the only
tephritid species of economic importance. It does, how-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/243

ever, represent a model species for true fruit flies of the
genera Ceratitis, Bactrocera, Dacus, Anastrepha and Rhagoletis, which include agricultural pests in several geographic
areas worldwide. The medfly ESTs will also facilitate studies to elucidate the genetics underlying polyphagous and
monophagous traits in pest and non-pest tephritid species. The sequences obtained in this study have been
arrayed on a 22K microarray, which will make it possible
for biologically important questions to be addressed by
mass expression profile analyses.

Methods
Flies
An established strain, ISPRA, was chosen for the creation
of the cDNA libraries. ISPRA was established in 1968 at
the European Community Joint Research Centre, Ispra,
Italy, with wild medflies from Sicily and Greece. The strain
has been maintained in the quarantine facility at the University of Pavia, Italy since 1979. Standard larval and rearing methods were used [68]. For the embryo library, two
separate collections of eggs at <30 min to 36 hr after oviposition were carried out, with each collection offset by 9
hr (i.e., in the early morning and afternoon). The eggs
were filtered from the water and rinsed with distilled
water, then with 0.02% Triton X-100, and finally with
diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. To obtain
adults for the head library, a standard laboratory rearing
cage was set up with about 600 less than 1 day old adults.
Twelve males and 12 females were removed from the cage
and used for RNA extraction at intervals of 24 hr for 8
days.
cDNA library construction
For the embryo library, total RNA was extracted from
approximately 1 g (wet weight) of eggs from each collection using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by treatment with DNase
(DNAfree, Ambion). An equal quantity of total RNA from
the two extractions was pooled prior to poly(A)+ RNA
purification. For the head library, total RNA was immediately extracted separately from the male and female heads
from each collection using Trizol, followed by treatment
with DNase. An equal quantity of total RNA from the
male head and female head extractions was pooled prior
to poly(A)+ RNA purification.

First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with an oligo(dT)
containing a NotI restriction site. The double-stranded
cDNA was ligated to an EcoRI adaptor, digested with NotI,
and cloned directionally into a NotI- and EcoRI-digested
pT7T3-Pac phagemid vector [69]. The cDNA inserts were
flanked by a library-specific 3' linker tag sequence (5'NotI-TAAGGTCGAG-3' in the embryo library and 5'-NotITCGACACAAT-3' in the head library) and 5' linker (5'-

EcoRI-GGCACGAGG-3'). Both libraries were normalized
[69].
Sequencing and contig assembly
Randomly selected clones were sequenced from the 5' end
using the M13 reverse sequencing primer (5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3') with an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer. Base-calling and low quality
sequence trimming were achieved using Phred [70], and
vector sequences were trimmed using Cross-match [71].
Repeat sequences were masked using RepeatMasker [72].
The sequences were assembled using Phrap [14]. The
resulting assembled sequences were used to perform
BLAST searches locally on a Macintosh G5 Unix workstation and on locally installed sequence databases, including the non-redundant protein sequence database and the
Drosophila, Anopheles gambiae, and Apis mellifera protein
databases. BLAST searches were performed using the lowcomplexity filter with the low-complexity sequences
masked. A similarity was considered significant if the e
value was lower than 10-5. GO annotations were derived
from the best-hit Drosophila sequences and were obtained
for each assembled sequence using FlyBase [73]. The presence of putative ORFs in the assembled sequences (with
and without the start codon) was determined using Flip
2.0.2, with the minimum length set to 150 amino acids
[74]. The sequences reported in this study have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers [GenBank: FG068301 â FG089553].
PCR-based cloning of Cctra2
Two primers based on the sequence of FC1744, Tra2-26f
(5'- tcaatcagcggtagcttgtg-3') and Tra2-939r (5'-acgtgtgtttgtttgtttgct-3'), were used to amplify the sequence of the
putative Cctra2 gene from genomic DNA isolated from the
ISPRA strain. Amplification was performed using the
AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity Kit (Invitrogen Srl, Milan) using the following conditions: an initial denaturing step at 94Â°C for 1 min, followed by 30
cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 30 sec at 56Â°C, and 3 min 30 sec
at 68Â°C, with a final extension of 10 min. Amplification
products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands using the Big Dye
Ready Reaction kit on an ABI 310 DNA Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
RT-PCR-based transcript detection
For transcript detection by RT-PCR, total RNA was
extracted using Trizol (according to the manufacturer's
instructions; Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) from pools of ~250
embryos in age ranges of 0â5, 5â10, 10â15, 15â20, 20â25
and 25â30 hr after oviposition; individual third instar larvae; and pools of eight heads and two headless bodies of
1- and 4-day-old adult virgin male and female flies. DNA
was extracted from the same samples using the Trizol

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/243

DNA extraction protocol. The larvae were sexed using a
PCR technique [75]. cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 Î¼g of
RNA using the Cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). The primers used for the RTPCR were Tra2-26f and Tra2-901r (5'-gcgaataggaacgactacgg-3'). The medfly glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [GenBank: S67872] housekeeping gene was
amplified as a control using the primers G6PDH-196f (5'ttgtcatctttggtgcttcg-3') and G6PDH-372r (5'-ccggttgcaccttcatgtat-3'). To control for genomic DNA contamination,
RT-PCR was also performed on samples in which cDNA
synthesis had been performed in the absence of reverse
transcriptase. RT-PCR was performed using 5% of the synthesized cDNA with the following cycle conditions: 94Â°C
for 2 min, 30 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 sec, 56Â°C for 30 sec,
72Â°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72Â°C for 10 min.
The amplification products were electrophoresed on 1.5%
or 2% agarose gels.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments of putative amino acid sequences
were performed using the PRALINE server with the standard progressive strategy [76], and neighbor-joining minimum evolution trees were obtained using PAUP 4.0b10
[77]. Maximum-likelihood trees were obtained using the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid change in
Phylip version 3.67 [78].
