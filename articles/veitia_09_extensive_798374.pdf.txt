Abstract
We show that the predicted signal peptide (SP) sequences of the secreted factors GDF9, BMP15
and AMH are well conserved in mammals but dramatic divergence is noticed for more distant
orthologs. Interestingly, bioinformatic predictions show that the divergent protein segments do
encode SPs. Thus, such SPs have undergone extensive sequence turnover with full preservation of
functionality. This can be explained by a pervasive accumulation of neutral and compensatory
mutations. An exploration of the potential evolutionary landscape of some SPs is presented. Some
of these signal sequences highlight an apparent paradox: they are encoded, by definition, by
orthologous DNA segments but they are, given their striking divergence, examples of what can be
called functional convergence.
Reviewers:
This article was reviewed by Fyodor Kondrashov and Eugene V. Koonin.

Findings
A typical signal peptide (SP) involves a hydrophobic
alpha-helical region which is called the h-region. This
hydrophobic segment is generally shorter (i.e. approximately 7–15 residues) than required for a transmembrane
helix. The h-region is close the N-terminus of the protein
but it is generally preceded by a slightly positively charged
n-region which is variable in length (i.e. 1–12 residues).
The cleavage site for the signal peptidase lies between the
h-region and a c-region, a stretch of 3–8 amino acid
involving rather polar and uncharged amino acids [1,2].
TGFβ superfamily members are secreted proteins that play
important roles in developmental and physiological processes in mammals and other organisms. They are classified into the TFGβ/Nodal/Activin group and the BMP/
GDF group [3-7]. In our analysis, we will focus on the SPs

of some members of the BMP/GDF group, namely
BMP15, GDF9 and AMH. BMP/GDF factors are synthesized as inactive precursors (pre-proproteins). They comprise an N-terminal SP, a propeptide and a mature region
located at the C-terminal part of the protein. Thus, production of the mature bioactive polypeptide requires
extensive post-translational processing: SP removal, dimerisation and further cleavage [8,9].
As shown in Figure 1, the predicted SP sequences of GDF9
and BMP15, and to a lesser degree of AMH, are well conserved in mammals. However, strong divergence is
noticed between the mammalian and the chicken
orthologs. Nevertheless, bioinformatic predictions of SP
using Phobius http://phobius.sbc.su.se[10] and SignalP
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/[11] clearly show
that the divergent protein segments do encode SPs (Figure

1A, 1B and 1C). Divergence is even stronger in comparisons with sequences from cold-blooded vertebrates (i.e.
fishes, data not shown). However, this behavior is not a
strict rule within this family, since, for instance, the SP of
BMP2 is very well conserved between mammals and
chicken (Figure 1D and Table 1), and even between mammals and fishes (i.e. Danio rerio/zebrafish). Strong
sequence divergence in the SP of AMH, BMP15 and GDF9
shows that such sequences can undergo extensive turnover with full preservation of their functionality. This can
be explained by the accumulation of multiple neutral
and/or intragenic compensatory mutations.
Wright (1964) and Kimura (1990) have defined compensatory mutations as those masking the deleterious effect of
another mutation or as mutations that are independently

deleterious but neutral when combined [12,13]. However, this criterion can be relaxed to non deleterious mutations that compensate for the effects of potentially
deleterious ones. The most obvious cases of canonical
compensatory mutations are provided by alterations
affecting the secondary helical structures of tRNA and
rRNA molecules, whose effects are counterbalanced by
changes restoring base pairing [14,15]. Compensatory
mutations in the context of proteins and cis-regulatory
sequences are also well known [16].
The analysis of the SP of some members of the TGFβ
superfamily is very instructive to understand the evolution of neutral and compensatory mutations in protein
coding regions. Although it is a difficult exercise to predict
the sequence of events leading to the emergence of several

The percentage of sequence identity for the signal peptide was calculated for the first 30 amino acid in human sequences, excluding gaps. Notice
that there are several possibilities, ranging from strong conservation in the three species including the signal peptide (BMP4), passing through cases
of overall conservation excluding the signal peptide (GDF8), to cases of rather low conservation in the three species (BMP15).

compensated mutations, we will explore this issue with
the particularly interesting case of the SP of GDF9 in
mammals.
First of all, we need to define a 'reference' sequence, to
which compare a sequence in question. For this we have
derived a consensus mammalian SP sequence, from a
multiple alignment of the N-terminus of GDF9 (Figure
2A). We have assumed that the consensus sequence is
likely to be closer to a eutherian ancestral sequence than
any sequence considered in isolation. The alignment
between the consensus and any individual sequence
shows that divergence varies greatly, in nature, position
and number (from no divergence for the P. troglodytes SP
to 8 differences for O. cuniculus). To assess whether the
divergent sites noticed in the various sequences are either
functionally irrelevant (neutral) or compensated, we have
explored the predicted 'fitness' landscape by taking into
account the functional impact of each change in the context of the consensus sequence, either isolated or in various combinations. Specifically, we used the bioinformatic
tool Phobius to predict the SP character of all possible
combinations of 'mutations' in the context of the consensus sequence, and by calculating the ratio of the resulting
predicted activity over the predicted activity for the consensus sequence. We verified most of the results with SignalP (data not shown).
Figure 2B shows the simplest example of compensatory
mutation: in Papio anubis, the SP of GDF9 displays only 2
divergences from the consensus sequence. The first one
involves a C in the consensus and a Y in the sequence
from Papio anubis. The 'mutation' C12Y (in the context of

the consensus), is predicted to be deleterious when
present alone, as it drives down the SP activity to 51% of
that of the consensus. The second mutation I21V has a
slightly positive effect, yielding 113% of the activity of the
consensus sequence (when alone), and is able to compensate the negative impact of the first one, as the two mutations together provide 94% of the consensus activity.
A completely different landscape is predicted for the
murine sequence. The alignment of the consensus and the
murine SP sequences shows that 6 positions are divergent
(Figure 3A). Now we can ask whether the 6 amino acid
changes between the consensus and the murine sequences
(numbered from 1 to 6 in Figure 3A) are neutral to function or, more interestingly, compensated. According to
Phobius predictions, the consensus sequence for GDF9
should contain a strong SP, and this is also the case for the
murine sequence, in spite of the divergent sites (Figure
3B). A very telling example of compensatory mutations is
provided by the mutations K6N+F11V+P20L (i.e. mutations 1, 3 and 4 placed in the context of the consensus
sequence). Such alterations of the consensus have a negative effect on the SP, since the predicted SP probability is
only 21% of the one obtained for the consensus (Figure
3B). How can such a negative effect be compensated? As
shown in Figure 3B, a further substitution (I21S, mutation
number 5) is able to compensate for the negative impact
of K6N+F11V+P20L, restoring almost completely the SP
character of the sequence. Similar results are obtained
when using SignalP. To explore the fitness landscape more
systematically, we have introduced the 64 combinations
of mutations in the context of the consensus sequence,
and evaluated their functional impact (Figure 3C). We

respect to the score of the consensus with no mutations). For the murine sequence, the predicted impact varies from slighlty

represent the fitness landscape as an hexagon, where each
vertex represents a mutation, and the lines joining the vertices (and the intersections of the latter) represent different combinations of mutations. A color code similar to
that of Figure 2B reflects the predicted functional impact
of a mutation or their combinations. This systematic analysis shows that some combinations are particularly deleterious. For instance, combinations involving mutations 1
and 4 together (in the context of the consensus) are highly

problematic, but their effects are compensated by mutation 5. Interestingly, some mutations appear rather
'hypermorphic' with respect to the consensus. This is the
case of mutations 5 and 6 (alone or associated) which
may foster compensation of potentially deleterious
changes.
A much quieter landscape is predicted for the Sus scrofa SP
sequence (Figure 4), that presents 7 changes when com-

changes each, and all led to at least 109% of the score of the consensus, and would have been color-coded in blue.

pared to the consensus (numbered from 1 to 7 in Figure
4). A systematic analysis shows that almost all mutations
and their combinations are either neutral or even slightly
hypermorphic (in green and blue, Figure 4). Only the second (L8F) and the fifth (L17F) changes are predicted to
slightly diminish SP activity. As expected, their combination is predicted to be the most deleterious one, yielding
71% of the consensus activity. Nevertheless, this functional impact is weak, and is very easily compensated by
the introduction of any other change. Therefore, this quiet
landscape can be considered as representing an evolution
of the sequence by fairly neutral mutations.
Given that compensated mutations separately can be disadvantageous and that they are unlikely to appear concertedly, one puzzling aspect is the sequence of steps leading
to their appearance. Theoretical studies of compensatory
mutations related to RNA secondary structure show that
"almost all bases [of the RNA molecule] can be substituted sequentially without ever changing the shape [phenotype] of the molecule" [17]. This is linked to the
existence of neutral mutational networks that opens the
possibility of changing the genotype while preserving the
phenotype [18,19]. In the context of the murine SP of
GDF9, the simplest scenario would predict that the first
change expected to have appeared in the ancestral murine
sequence is I21S (mutation 5) which does not alter SP
activity (and might even increase it), and that the other
mutations might have appeared later in whatever order,
because they are always compensated by S21.
Rapid sequence turnover also bears important practical
consequences. For instance, we have recently detected a
BMP15 mutation leading the potentially damaging variant S5R in a patient with severe ovarian dysfunction [20].
This mutation lies within the SP of BMP15, and very
recently, Rossetti et al. found that it decreases significantly
the activity/amount of the secreted protein [21]. This is in
agreement with our in silico analyses using Phobius and
SignalPep that predicted a quantitative alteration of SP
processing. In order to further assess the potential deleterious effect of this amino acid change we used the SIFT
software, which uses protein sequence conservation data
and the physicochemical properties of amino acids to calculate the probability for an amino acid substitution of
being deleterious [22]. Ser5 in BMP15 is conserved in vertebrates ranging from the zebrafish to mammals. However, the divergent chicken sequence does have an
obviously compensated arginine at position 5. Thus,
depending on the inclusion or exclusion of the chicken
sequence in the alignment, the mutation p.S5R is predicted to be either very pathogenic or not pathogenic at
all.

Speculations
It is known that sex and reproduction-related genes, as is
the case of BMP15, GDF9 and AMH [23,24], can have
increased evolutionary rates [25]. This might explain at
least in part the divergence of the SPs observed here. For
some of these SPs, sequence turnover is so important that
the original protein segments have been almost entirely
replaced by new sequences, fully retaining a SP function.
This can be explained by an important accumulation of
neutral and compensatory mutations through an evolutionary scale. Thus, sequences encoding SPs deriving from
common ancestral sequences (which is obvious from the
underlying gene structures and homology outside the SP
regions) can be highly divergent at present: they are
orthologous by definition but their corresponding
encoded peptides are by definition functionally convergent.

Review of Veitia and Caburet, titled "Extensive turnover of
the signal peptides of some members of the GDF/BMP
family: whatever happened to these sequences?
This is a beautiful story of the compensatory nature of signal peptide evolution and one of the few attempts out
there to actually define the nature of fitness ridges in protein space. Figure 2C is a wonderful depiction of one of
the most important questions in macroevolution – how
different genotypes are connected in fitness space. The use
of a consensus sequence as a rough representative of the
ancestral state is one of my favorite ideas and, of course,
has its biases, but they should be relatively small if used in
a correct phylogenetic setting as has been done here. More
works should replicate what Veitia and Caburet have done
here.

Specific critiques:
1) I think that the title of the paper does not do justice to
the content. I think that the most wonderful result is not
the extensive turnover of sequence (we know this must be
possible because we see many different highly divergent
orthologs) but in the fact that the authors can reproduce
the fitness landscape of an entire functional unit.
Authors' response: We agree with the referee and we have
changed the title accordingly.
2) The compensation of a deleterious allele by a neutral
variant is known as a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility, and has been described in a molecular level as compensations of disease mutations.
Authors' response: Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility has
indeed been described in eukaryotic hybrids, and the molecular
basis of this incompatibility is thought to be due to mismatches
in macromolecular complexes and cellular networks (failure of
intergenic compensation). Nevertheless, we failed to link this to
our findings, which imply intragenic compensation.
3) Overall the methodology is clear, but I think that it
would be good to have a formal methods section that
describes the approaches more generally. In particular, it
is not clear to me why the specific 6 sites shown in Figure
2C are shown (or if these are the differences between consensus and mouse, why the mouse and not the horse?). In
general, would it be possible to devise a scheme similar to
that in Figure 2C that takes into account more species, and
a greater number of sites and states in those sites? I realize
that the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of sites, but perhaps the
authors could focus on actually defining the path that evolution may have traversed in these species: removing combinations that probably have not yet been observed in
evolution may help simplify the schematics. I believe that
these fitness ridges are the most exciting part of this
research and expanding on this would give us wonderful
insights into evolution.
Authors' response: Although we would be glad to answer positively to such an enthusiastic request, we failed to devise a
proper way to draw a diagram that would take into account all
the listed possibilities (more species, more sites, several states for
one site). Nevertheless, we expanded this part to include methodological explanations on the general approach and to display
additional examples, both simple (Figure 2A) and more sophisticated (heptagonal diagram, Figure 4).
4) The question at the very end of the discussion I think is
too simple. Surely, homology (orthology) is defined by

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/22

common ancestry and not by the practical limitations of
being able to identify it.
Authors' response: We agree with the referee. However, our
point here was not that we were not able to recognize orthology,
which could be properly done. Instead, we wanted to highlight
the apparent paradox posed by a subset of the signal peptides
analyzed. Indeed, some of them are completely divergent in
spite of being encoded by orthologous DNA fragments, yet they
are strong SPs. In our opinion, they are clear examples of functionalconvergence.

Reviewer's report 2
Eugene V. Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH, USA.
In this very interesting brief paper, Veitia and Caburet
examine the conservation and divergence of the signal
peptides in three sets of growth factors of the BMP/GDF
family. This analysis reveals an anomalous pattern of evolution whereby the signal peptide sequences are highly
conserved within mammals but are extremely divergent in
non-mammal vertebrates, despite conservation of the salient properties of signal peptide. They then hypothesize
that this extreme divergence involves compensatory mutations and apply a straightforward but clever approach to
demonstrate the existence of such compensation by measuring the change in the quality of signal peptide prediction in different mutants. The effect of compensation
indeed comes out loud and clear. This is an interesting
observation of a rather general appeal (despite the fact
that the analyzed data set is quite small) because rarely
can compensatory amino acid replacement be demonstrated in such an explicit manner.
Although the work is interesting and certainly worth publishing, I think there are areas where considerable
improvement is possible, and then, I am also confused
about one of the conclusions. First potential improvements, then the confusion.
1) The signal peptides are short, so the number of mutations involved is rather small. Thus, at least in some cases,
a complete enumeration of all sequences of replacements
should be possible, and then, the neutral network and the
attainable and prohibited paths in them can be presented
explicitly. I think this would greatly increase the value of
the work
Authors' response: Indeed, this is what we now propose in our
figures 2, 3 and 4, where we provide two examples of exhaustive enumeration of the possible combinations of mutations.
Figure 4 shows an almost complete neutral network, whereas
the diagram in Figure 3C displays neutral, deleterious and even
slightly 'hypermorphic' mutations. Possible paths for evolution

of this sequence can be deduced, starting from any single mutation and following the various lines inward, avoiding deleterious combinations. The central combination contains all
mutations (i.e. it is the present state of the sequence in relevant
species). We think that 7 mutations and their various combinations is the maximum that can be displayed clearly in a polygonal diagram.

3.

2) I realize that this is a brief Discovery Note, and yet, I
think it would be most helpful to include some background, that is, what is the characteristic level of conservation divergence of signal peptides within the same
phylogenetic range. That would allow the reader to better
assess the novelty of the results presented in the paper.

8.

Authors' response: We have included a table (1) displaying the
% of sequence idendity for the total protein and the relevant signal peptide for the BMP/GDF family, in human/mouse and
human/chicken alignments. There are several possibilities,
ranging from strong conservation in the three species including
the signal peptide (BMP4), passing through cases of overall
conservation excluding the signal peptide (GDF8), to cases of
rather low conservation in the three species (BMP15).
3) My confusion: I do not understand why the authors
talk about convergence in this case, and even use exclamation points to emphasize this conclusion. As far as I know,
convergence implies that similar sequences (the same
amino acid residues) evolve independently in different
lineages, from dissimilar ancestors. The sequences in
question may well be orthologs but the essence of convergence is that they start from distant points and get closer
to each other in the course of evolution (cf. the famous
case of monkey lysozymes studies by A. C. Wilson and
coworkers). Is this what was observed here? I did not get
this impression but, if this is the case, it should be made
much more transparent.
