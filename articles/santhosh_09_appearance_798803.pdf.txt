Abstract
Chikungunya has resurged in the form of unprecedented explosive epidemic in 2006 after a long
gap in India affecting 1.39 million of persons. The disease continued for the next two consecutive
years affecting 59,535 and 64,548 persons during 2007 and 2008 respectively. The 2008 outbreak
being the second largest among these three years the information regarding the etiology and the
mutations involved are useful for further control measures. Among the 2008 outbreaks the Coastal
Karnataka accounts for the 46,510 persons. An in-depth investigation of Chikungunya epidemic of
Coastal Karnataka, India, 2008 by serology, virus isolation, RT-PCR and genome sequencing
revealed the presence and continued circulation of A226V mutant Chikungunya virus. The
appearance of this mutant virus was found to be associated with higher prevalence of vector Aedes
albopictus and the geographical proximity of coastal Karnataka with the adjoining Kerala state. This
is the first report regarding the appearance of this mutation in Karnataka state of India. The present
study identified the presence and association of A226V mutant virus with Chikungunya outbreak in
India during 2008.

Findings
Chikungunya fever is an acute arthropod borne viral illness reported from many parts of Africa and south east
Asia. The causative agent is Chikungunya virus (CHIKV),
a member of the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae
and is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito
[1-3]. CHIKV illness in humans is often characterized by
sudden onset of fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia and severe arthralgia. The arthralgia
may persist in a small proportion of cases even for
months. These clinical symptoms mimic with that of dengue fever and therefore, many cases of Chikungunya are

misdiagnosed as dengue infections [4-6]. At present, there
is no vaccine or antiviral therapy available against
Chikungunya infection.
An outbreak of Chikungunya virus infection occurred during 2006 in 15 states or union territories in India affecting
more than 1.39 million of persons [7-10]. The epidemic
started from December 2005 and since then continued for
the next three consecutive years. Among the various outbreaks in different states, the 2007 outbreak of Kerala was
unique in the sense that it affected more than 25,000 persons with higher epidemic potential and reported mortal-

ities [11]. The investigation of full genome sequence of
2007 Kerala isolates and its comparison with 2006 Indian
isolates revealed the presence of A226V mutation in E1
gene of the virus and was found to be associated with evolutionary success due to adaptation in the Aedes albopictus
mosquito vector with progression of epidemic from 2006
to 2007 [11,12].

Biosystems, USA). The nucleotide sequences were aligned
edited and analysed using Seqscape V.3 software (Applied
Biosystem, USA). CLUSTALW version 1.83 [13] was used
to perform multiple nucleotide and amino acid sequence
allignment of E1 gene (1044 nt). A The phylogenetic analysis was performed based on partial E1 gene (837 nt)
sequences of CHIK viruses using MEGA version 3.1 [14].

In 2008, an outbreak of fever with severe arthralgia
occurred in costal Karnataka, in India adjoining the state
of Kerala, affecting 46,510 persons [10]. The affected areas
include Puttur, Mangalore, Sulya and other parts of the
Dakshina Kannada district. The outbreak seems similar to
Kerala 2007 outbreak with respect to higher epidemic
potential and reported mortalities. The geographical proximity of coastal Karnataka to Kerala coupled with the
higher prevalence of Aedes albopictus created an apprehension regarding involvement of similar etiology. To rule
out any confusion, an in depth virological, serological and
molecular investigation was carried out to identify the etiology of this unprecedented outbreak, which is considered to be the second highest in terms of number of
persons affected since its resurgence in 2006.

For the construction of phylogenetic trees, the neighbourjoining algorithm and the Kimura two-parameter distance
modelwere utilized. The reliability of the analysiswas
evaluated by a bootstrap test with 10,000 replications

A total of 100 blood samples from patients suspected of
having Chikungunya fever were brought from District Surveillance Unit, Mangalore which were collected from
Mangalore, Puttur, Sulya and other parts of the Dakshina
Kannada district for this study. Two sets of blood samples
were collected with and without anticoagulant for virus
isolation and serology respectively. All these samples were
investigated for the presence of Chikungunya specific
RNA by RT-PCR and for the presence of CHIKV specific
IgM antibodies by using recombinant E1 and E2 protein
based IgM ELISA.
The presence of CHIKV specific RNA in clinical samples
was detected using the Access quick one-step RT-PCR kit
(Promega, USA) employing a primers pair targeting the E1
gene (CHIK13: TTACATCACGTGCGAATAC genome position 10128-10146 and CHIK14: CTTTGCTCTCAGGCGTGCGACTTT genome position 10604-10627); designed
from the nucleotide sequence of the reference S27 strain,
GenBank Acc No. AF490259[8,11]. The 8 representative
RT-PCR positive samples were again amplified through
RT-PCR using a different set of primer targeting E1 gene
(E1-10145F:ACAAAACCGTCATCCCGTCTC
genome
position 10145-10165, E1-11158R: TGACTATGTGGTCCTTCGGAGG genome position 11137-11158, E111011F:CGGGAAGCTGAGATAGAAGTTGAA
Genome
position 11011-11034, 3'NTR-11669R: TTGATTTTTATTAGTTTTATGTTT genome position 11645-11669) for
sequencing and were subjected to double stranded
sequencing employing Big dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with ABI 310 sequencer (Applied

The isolation of virus was also attempted in C6/36 cells
from selected RT-PCR positive samples following the virus
adsorption technique [15]. The serological analysis was
carried out using an in-house developed recombinant E1
& E2 protein based indirect format IgM ELISA.
The serological analysis of the samples indicated overall
28% seropositivity for IgM antibodies. A total of 40 (40%)
serum samples were found positive for the presence of
CHIKV specific RNA, through demonstration of CHIKV
specific 500 bp amplicon by RT-PCR. A representative of
20 RT-PCR positive samples were subjected to virus isolation in C6/36 cells, which yielded 8 CHIKV isolates. The
isolation of the virus was further confirmed by RT-PCR
and nucleotide sequencing.
Nucleotide sequencing of the partial E1 gene of 8 representative CHIKV strains was determined and were compared with 27 other globally diverse CHIKV isolates
including Chikungunya isolates from 2006, 2007 outbreaks of India and Reunion islands (Table 1). The BLAST
search revealed > 99% identity with CHIKV isolates from
2006-07, French Reunion isolates. All the Eight representative isolates from this outbreak revealed A226V shift in
the E1 gene as observed in the 2007 Kerala isolates (Fig.
1). The presence of this A226V shift in 2008, coastal Karnataka isolates as well as the geographical proximity with
adjoining karala state where this mutation was reported
and the results of phylogenetic analysis suggest that the
current outbreak might have spread from the Kerala. As E1
gene sequences were available for additional isolates and
also because of its importance in phylogenetic analysis, a
Neighbour-joining phylogenetic was constructed (Fig. 2).
It revealed that all the DRDE-08 isolates from this epidemic grouped along with the DRDE-07, and other 2007
Kerala isolates within the Indian Cluster of ECSA genotype, whereas all the Reunion isolates form a RU cluster
with in the ECSA genotype as reported earlier [11].
Since early 2005, a major epidemic of CHIK started in
many Indian Ocean island nations; and towards end of
2005, it reemerged in several parts of India [7-9,16]. The

Showing portion of alignment of amino acid sequences of the E1 gene of CHIKV isolates (amino acid positions
from E1: 201-250 are shown). The position of the A226V mutation is indicated by an vertical column. Sequences are identified by the name as given in the table 1.

resurgence of CHIK epidemic after a gap of 32 years and
the subsequent hiatus of explosive epidemic for three consecutive years is a point of major concern. In addition, the
implication of A226V mutation with increased severity,
non classical symptoms, reported mortality and large epidemic in Kerala during 2007 has warranted the continues
monitoring and surveillance of the activity of the mutant
virus in this particular region [11]. The investigation of
2008 coastal Karnataka outbreak clearly showed the
involvement of A226V mutant in large scale morbidity.
The present study revealed less seropositivity in comparison to RT-PCR which may be attributed to the collection
of samples at very early or acute stage of the illness. The
demonstration of CHIKV RNA in 40% samples by RT-PCR
and detection of IgM antibodies in 28% of sample confirmed the causative agent of this epidemic to be CHIKV.
The isolation of CHIKV from clinical samples further confirmed this etiology. The sequence of CHIKV were directly
determined from clinical samples without risk of altering
the genome by in vitro passaging. During this outbreak,
patients also reported non classical symptoms including
hemorrhage, lymphadenitis, ictures and liver involvement, etc. similar to the cases in Reunion 2005-06 and
Kerala India-2007 [11,16]. These types of unusual cases,
geographical similarity, proximity and higher prevalence
of Aedes albopictus leads to the speculation for the involve-

ment of Kerala 2007 strain for the current outbreak. The
sequencing of CHIKV strains from the current 2008 outbreak led to identification of A226V shift in these isolates.
The E1:A226V mutation was earlier correlated with vector
specificity as well as epidemic potential [17]. This shift in
the present outbreak may be attributed to the higher epidemic potential and higher prevalence of Aedes albopictus
vector in Coastal Karnataka in 2008. However, the complete genome sequencing is required to see other mutations other than A226V which are unique for the current
2008 outbreak
The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all isolates from
the current outbreak were very closely related to analogous strains from Kerala 2007 outbreak. All these isolates
harbor valine at E1-226 position compared to alanine in
the 2006 Indian isolates
In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report regarding the appearance of this mutation in Karnataka state of India. The involvement of A226V mutant
virus was attributed to the continued circulation of the
2007 Kerala strain in the current outbreak due its geographical proximity coupled with higher prevalence of
Aedes albopictus vector, supporting the higher epidemic
potential of A226V mutant virus. However, a continuous
