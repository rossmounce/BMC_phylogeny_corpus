Abstract
Background: A large multigene family of NOD-like receptor (NLR) molecules have been
described in mammals and implicated in immunity and apoptosis. Little information, however, exists
concerning this gene family in non-mammalian taxa. This current study, therefore, provides an indepth investigation of this gene family in lower vertebrates including extensive phylogenetic
comparison of zebrafish NLRs with orthologs in tetrapods, and analysis of their tissue-specific
expression.
Results: Three distinct NLR subfamilies were identified by mining genome databases of various
non-mammalian vertebrates; the first subfamily (NLR-A) resembles mammalian NODs, the second
(NLR-B) resembles mammalian NALPs, while the third (NLR-C) appears to be unique to teleost
fish. In zebrafish, NLR-A and NLR-B subfamilies contain five and six genes respectively. The third
subfamily is large, containing several hundred NLR-C genes, many of which are predicted to encode
a C-terminal B30.2 domain. This subfamily most likely evolved from a NOD3-like molecule. Gene
predictions for zebrafish NLRs were verified using sequence derived from ESTs or direct
sequencing of cDNA. Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed expression of
representative genes from each subfamily in selected tissues.
Conclusion: Our findings confirm the presence of multiple NLR gene orthologs, which form a
large multigene family in teleostei. Although the functional significance of the three major NLR
subfamilies is unclear, we speculate that conservation and abundance of NLR molecules in all
teleostei genomes, reflects an essential role in cellular control, apoptosis or immunity throughout
bony fish.

Background
In recent years, a family of molecules with roles in apoptosis and immune regulation has been discovered in
mammalian genomes. This gene family, is known under
several pseudonyms, including the CATERPILLER (CLR),
NACHT, NOD-LRR or NOD-like receptor (NLR) family

and is comprised of two major subfamilies of NOD and
NALP molecules, along with 3 divergent members; IPAF,
the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) and neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) [1,2]. Official names
have been recently assigned to many members of this family by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee

(HGNC) [3] using the NLR prefix (Table 1). NLRs are recognized by the presence of three specific domains; an
effector domain at the N-terminus that is involved in protein:protein interactions, a central NACHT (or nucleotide
binding oligomerization/NOD) domain and a C-terminal
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. They are, therefore,
structurally similar to disease resistance (R) proteins
found in plants that are well known for their anti-microbial activities [4]. In humans, 22 NLRs have been
described including 14 NALPs, with a PYRIN effector
domain, and 5 NODs whose effector domain is typically
a caspase recruitment domain (CARD).
The functions of the NLRs are presently not well defined.
However, based on their structural characteristics, these
molecules are thought to be expressed in the cytosol of
immune-related cells, and have been implicated in
autoimmune diseases and responses to bacterial [5] or
viral molecules [6] supporting their importance in host
immunity. Some of these molecules activate caspase-1 [7],
while others initiate [8,9] or inhibit NF-κB signaling [10].
These two molecular pathways are fundamental to a
molecular platform known as the inflammasome [7],
which coordinates the production and processing of
important inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
(IL)-1, IL-18 and IL-33 in mammals. Proteins that assemble in this caspase-1 inflammasome vary according to the
cell type and stimulus [11]. Other molecules (e.g. caspase
11) that are necessary for inflammasome function are

thought to be generated or recruited as a result of crosstalk between NLR and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
[12]. According to current hypotheses, the activation of
NLRs occurs following recognition of specific ligands by
their LRR domains similar to the way that TLRs recognize
molecules from extracellular pathogens. NLR proteins are,
therefore, believed to represent cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that use LRR regions to detect intracellular pathogens. Those NLRs that are better defined
functionally include NOD1, NOD2, and NALP3. NOD1
and NOD2, have both been shown to play a role in
immunity of the mammalian gut and are highly expressed
in epithelial cells or macrophages associated with the
intestine. NOD1 recognizes a molecule known as mesoDAP (γ-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid), which is
a peptidoglycan (PGN) component found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [13], while NOD2 recognizes muramyl dipeptide, a peptidoglycan component
found only in Gram-positive bacteria [14]. NALP3 (alias
cryopyrin) has been shown to recognize a wide range of
molecules, including bacterial RNA and synthetic viral
RNA/DNA mimics (R837 and R848) [6]. NALP3 becomes
activated in TLR-primed macrophages in response to ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) and bacterial toxins that lower
cytoplasmic K+ [12], which is thought to be the major
mechanism in the NALP3 response to certain Gram-positive bacteria. In a distinct pathway, monosodium urate
and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals have been
shown to increase caspase-1 activity in a NALP3-depend-

ent (TLR-independent) manner [1], representing potential 'danger signal' ligands for NALP3 [5] and defining a
further role for NLRs in recognizing cellular stress.
Members of the NLR family have not been extensively
studied in taxa other than mammals, although recent
reports indicate some members of this family exist in
lower vertebrates [15] and in invertebrates [16]. Extending
the knowledge of NLRs in ectotherms, this study reports
an extensive overview of the NLR family in teleost fish,
represented using information derived from the zebrafish
Danio rerio. Here, we describe the gene phylogeny and
expression of three major subfamilies of NLRs in teleostei,
which we designate NLR-A and NLR-B (resembling mammalian NOD and NALP subfamilies respectively) and
NLR-C, a large subfamily (characterized with a NOD-3like NACHT domain and an unusual C-terminal domain)
that appears in all teleostei genomes, and is unique to
bony fish. The implications of all three subfamilies in
immune regulation of fish are discussed.

Results
Many NLR-like sequences were identified in the genome
and EST databases of non-mammalian vertebrates. These
genes were compared by phylogenetic analysis of their
deduced NACHT domains (Fig 1). Mammalian NLRs are
categorized into NOD and NALP families according to
previous publications [1] and as depicted in Table 1. In
the zebrafish genome, three distinct subfamilies were
identified and highly supported by bootstrap analysis;
some resembled mammalian NODs (designated subfamily A; Table 2; Fig 1C), some resembled mammalian
NALPs (designated subfamily B; Table 3; Fig 1B) and
some formed a unique clade, closely related to NOD3,
which was restricted to teleostei (designated subfamily C;
Table 4; Fig 1A).
Subfamily A
Teleost fish possess gene orthologs for all five members of
the mammalian NOD subfamily (Table 2; Table 5). While
chicken and Xenopus genomes apparently lack the NOD2
gene (Table 5; Fig 1C), both are in possession of the
remaining four NODs. The gene predictions for zebrafish
NOD sequences were corrected using corresponding ESTs
identified in the TIGR database, and missing sequence
found with assistance from other fish NOD-like
sequences using the BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool)
program. Following assembly, zebrafish NODs were
highly structurally conserved relative to human NODs.
Zebrafish NOD1 (NLR-A1) has an N-terminal CARD
domain, and nine highly conserved leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) (Fig 2) although the 5' and 3' exons were not identified. Two CARD domains were identified at the N-terminal end of zebrafish NOD2 (NLR-A2), and eight LRR
domains were recognizable by their LRR-like motifs (e.g.

CDD, it shares some similarity with the human NOD3
effector domain with two conserved sequence signatures,
MRK and EAG (amino acids 59–61 and 69–71 of DRNLR-A3 respectively). The C-terminal end of NLR-A3 possessed 14 LRR motifs, which aligned exactly with LRR
domains of human NOD3 [see Additional file 1], with a
similar motif (CxxLxMxxNxF) between the NACHT
domain and the first true LRR motif. Both NOD4 (NLRA4) and NOD5 (NLR-A5) orthologs in zebrafish have
conserved sequences within their LRR domains relative to
their human equivalents, although the predicted LRR for
zebrafish NLR-A4 is shorter than that of human NOD4,
and less conserved relative other human and zebrafish
NLR-A orthologs. The N-terminal domains for NLR-A4
and NLR-A5, as with NLR-A3, were not identified within
the CDD database set, but share some conserved features
with the corresponding regions of mammalian NOD4
and NOD5. NLR-A4/NOD4 appears to represent the most
divergent gene within the NLR-A subfamily, yet zebrafish
NLR-A4 groups with high bootstrap support with human
NOD4 and its orthologs from chicken and Xenopus during
phylogenetic comparisons (Fig 1C). All five NLR-As are
located on distinct chromosomes in zebrafish. The NLRA1 gene is located on chromosome 16 in version 6 of the
zebrafish genome (Zv6) (Table 2), but is not mapped to a
chromosome in version 7 (Zv7) [see Additional file 2],
NLR-A2 resides at chromosome 7 and NLR-A3, NLR-A4
and NLR-A5 can be found on chromosomes 24, 18 and 15
respectively.

Subfamily B
Six distinct genes encoding NACHT domains were identified in Zv6 that belong to subfamily B and form a separate
cluster within the clade of mammalian NALPs. Although
zebrafish NLR-B2 and B3 were identified in distinct
regions of the zebrafish genome (Table 3) these genes are
identical in the region of the NACHT domain used for
phylogenetic analysis. Several NALP-like sequences were
also identified for Xenopus tropicalis (Table 5) that similarly formed their own cluster distinct from the human
and zebrafish NALPs (Fig 1B). Gene predictions encoding
putative NALPs in zebrafish are short, with most lacking a
recognizable effector domain and C-terminal LRR
domain. One exception is NLR-B2, which appears to have
an N-terminal region with low similarity to a CARD motif
as identified by searching the CDD. Only one cDNA
sequence resembling this subfamily could be identified in
the zebrafish EST database [GenBank:AI883819] that,
although highly similar in sequence, was not an exact
match to any of the predicted NLR-B genes and appeared
to encode only a portion of the NACHT domain. NLR subfamily B genes appear to be restricted to small clusters on
chromosomes 2 and 15 in zebrafish. Furthermore, NLRB5 and NLR-B6 reside close (28.3–28.5 m) to NLR-A5 (32
m) on chromosome 15. Later analysis of Zv7 revealed
removal of the NLR-B5 gene prediction, and its merger
with the prediction for NLR-B6 [see Additional file 2].

Subfamily C
Database searches revealed multiple genes that possessed
NACHT domains and shared significant homology to
human NOD3 yet were distinct from the zebrafish NOD3
molecule (NLR-A3) described above. This large number of
highly similar genes clearly arose from several gene(ome)
duplication events. Several hundred predicted genes/proteins were observed for this group in the databases for all
teleost fish (data not shown). In zebrafish, these genes
were found at numerous chromosomal loci, with large
clusters evident on (at least) chromosomes 1, 4, 14 and
17. A small selection of these genes was subjected to fur-

Schematic diagram depicting the deduced protein structures
of zebrafish NLRs. Zebrafish NLR subfamily-A have structures similar to the NOD subfamily in mammals, with
NOD1/NLR-A1 possessing one CARD motif while NOD2/
NLR-A2 possesses two. While only the NACHT domain was
identified for most members of the NLR-B subfamily, one
member of this group (NLR-B2) was predicted with a putative N-terminal CARD effector domain. All NLR-C subfamily
members were predicted to have an N-terminal effector
domain, a central NACHT domain and a LRR domain. In
addition, some of the NLR-C molecules were identified with
a C-terminal B30.2 domain. The predicted effector domains
of molecules within the NLR-C subfamily varied; some had a
pyrin (P) effector domain, while others had a distinct uncharacterized effector domain (X). B30.2 domains are also found
in other important immune related molecules such as certain
TRIMs and the Pyrin molecule, whose structures are also
shown. C = card domain, P = pyrin domain, X = other
domain, N = NACHT domain, L = LRR region, B = B30.2/

ther analysis (Table 4 and Fig 1A). These molecules
divided into three clusters during phylogenetic analysis,
which also corresponded to sequence differences identified in the N-terminal region. Representatives from chromosome 14 were identified in all three clusters, while
NLRs from some other chromosomes (e.g. chromosomes
12 and 17) were restricted to one cluster, although not all
genes were included in the analysis.
Although the NACHT domains of the C-group NLRs are
clearly homologous to NOD3, many of these genes were
found to encode a conserved PYRIN domain at the N-terminus (Figs 2, 3) showing some analogy to mammalian
NALP genes. The presence of this domain was confirmed
by identifying an EST sequence containing the PYRIN
domain and a partial NACHT domain that resembled Cgroup NLRs. Other C-group NLRs had N-terminal
sequences with no obvious gene ortholog. While some are
likely incorrectly predicted domains, EST sequences confirm at least two of these predicted N-termini are transcribed in association with the NLR C-group NACHT
domain (Fig 4). The NLR C-group molecules also possess
an LRR region, as with other NLRs. Unexpectedly, a B30.2
(PRY-SPRY) domain was identified in several of the predicted genes for NLRs of the C subfamily. Owing to nature
of this large multigene family, a single representative EST
was sequenced to confirm domain structure, including the
verification of the B30.2 domain. The B30.2. This domain
was found at the C-terminus, following the LRR domain
and was confirmed by completely sequencing EST [Genbank:CK126487]; the 4,524 bp sequence was submitted
to GenBank [GenBank:EF613347] and contained
sequence from the NACHT domain to the poly-A tail. Further overlapping ESTs/TCs identified in the TIGR database
provided additional confirmation for the NLR C-group,
with an effector (PYRIN or other) domain, NACHT
domain, LRR domain and a C-terminal B30.2 domain
(Fig 5) [see Additional file 3] although, due to the high
number of closely related sequences for this subfamily
and the current stage of the zebrafish genome sequence, it
was not possible to ascertain whether the overlapping
ESTs were generated from the same gene or distinct genes
within the NLR-C family.
Other NLRs
Although the CIITA was evident in the genomes of the
pufferfishes, frog and chicken, this molecule was not readily identifiable in zebrafish Zv6. However, later analyses
identified a CIITA-like gene, in Zv7 of the zebrafish

tions whose templates were sterile water (not shown) or
from cDNA syntheses performed in the absence of reverse
transcriptase (RT-). ARP was amplified from all tissues
confirming the integrity of the cDNAs and the success of
RT-PCR. Genomic products were amplified for all NLR-A
genes that were larger than the cDNA amplicons and supported the presence of intron(s) between the primer
regions.

Discussion
Expression of zebrafish NLRs
The spatial expression of NLR genes was evaluated in
selected tissues from naïve zebrafish. NLR-A1, -A2, -A3 A4 and -A5 were all identified in zebrafish intestine using
RT-PCR. All five genes were also expressed in liver
although expression of NLR-A2 was extremely weak. NLRA3 expression was not detected in the spleen following 35
PCR cycles, but the four other NLR-A genes were expressed
in this tissue (with low expression of splenic NLR-A5 in
one individual). As a representative of the NLR-B subfamily, NLR-B2 expression was investigated and detected
in all three tissues. Similarly, mRNA was detected for an
NLR-C gene(s) in all three tissues using primers based on
the completely sequenced EST clone. The primers used to
detect these genes amplified no products in control reac-

New insight into the regulation of essential developmental, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways was achieved
with the discovery and characterization of the NLR gene
family of putative cytoplasmic pattern recognition molecules. While an increasing amount of information exists
for these molecules in mammals, this gene family is
poorly studied in other vertebrates with little to no information available even at the gene level for birds, amphibians and fish. This study resolves this issue by identifying
and characterizing many NLR-like genes from these three
classes of animals and uncovering a unique subfamily of
NLRs in teleost fish.
Our evidence shows early evolution and high conservation of the NOD (NLR-A) subfamily of NLRs. All species

Many N-terminal effector domains of the predicted zebrafish NLR-C molecules are recognized as pyrin/PAAD-DAPIN domains
based on the HMM logo. Some examples are shown, with conserved amino acids [A]. Other N-terminal sequences were
observed for NLR-C molecules, which were confirmed in the EST databases at TIGR [B]. TC326097 encodes a pyrin domain,
whereas TC353741 and TC343155 represent undefined N-terminal domains such as those denoted by 'X' in Figure 2.

of teleost fish that were analyzed had five distinct members of this subfamily designated NLR-A1, NLR-A2, NLRA3, NLR-A4 and NLR-A5 that were clear gene orthologs of
human NOD1 to NOD5 [1]. A NOD1 ortholog was also
described during an earlier screen of zebrafish ESTs for
molecules similar to apoptosis regulators [17]. In addition to encoded NACHT domains, the effector domains
and LRR regions were highly conserved in the fish NLR-A
genes relative to their human equivalents, suggesting
retained function. NLR-A1 and NLR-A2, the fish orthologs
of human NOD1 and NOD2 respectively, both possessed
clear CARD domains (one in NLR-A1 and two in NLR-A2)
with high amino acid identity to the equivalent regions of
human molecules. In mammalian NOD1 (and presumably NOD2), the CARD domains are necessary for the
interaction with RICK kinase, an enzyme that participates
in NFκB activation and, ultimately, the generation of proinflammatory molecules [18]. Since RICK is also present
in fish genomes (see zebrafish RIPK2, Q4V958), it would

appear that this inflammatory cascade was established
prior to the divergence of teleost fish from the tetrapod
lineage, assuming that the same interaction occurs
between these molecules in fish. The highly conserved
sequences in the LRR domains implies these zebrafish
NLR-A1 and NLR-A2 may also be able to recognize mesoDAP and muramyl dipeptide as mammalian NOD1 and
NOD2 respectively [13,14] although this requires formal
confirmation. NLR-A1 transcript was detected equally in
intestine, liver and spleen, reflecting the wide-spread distribution observed for murine NOD1 [18], while NLR-A2
was strongly expressed in intestine, with some expression
in spleen and barely detectable levels in liver. Similar to
the highest expression of NLR-A2 in zebrafish intestine,
human NOD2 has a more restricted expression pattern,
with predominant expression in cells of myeloid origin
including monocytes [9] and Paneth cells [19] that are
associated with the gut, although expression of NOD2 can
also be induced in epithelial cells [20]. Zebrafish NLR-A3

is clearly an ortholog of mammalian NOD3, with similarity in the effector and NACHT domains and an equal
number of LRR domains. At the genomic level, NOD3 is
flanked by RHOT2, SBK1 and PDPK1, GNPTG respec-

tively in zebrafish and fugu further supporting the orthologous relationship for NOD3 between fish species.
Expression of NLR-A3 was strong in zebrafish intestine,
with some expression also in liver and little to no expression observed in the spleen. Interestingly, the kidney
(bone marrow equivalent) did not express NLR-A3 as well
suggesting that it is not expressed by lymphocytes (data
not shown). In mammals, NOD3 expression occurs primarily in lymphocytes and is attributed to inhibition of Tcell activity [21]. Two other NLR-A subfamily members
were also identified in zebrafish that were designated
NLR-A4 and NLR-A5 with NLR-A4 resembling human
NOD4 and NLR-A5 being highly conserved to human
NOD5. NLR-A4/NOD4 genes represent the most divergent members of this subfamily based on amino acid conservation within the N-terminal and LRR regions between
different vertebrate orthologs. Both NLR-A4 and NLR-A5
genes were constitutively expressed in intestine, spleen
and liver of naïve zebrafish, although there is clearly some
fish to fish variation preventing their detection in some
individuals under the conditions used for RT-PCR. Currently, there is no information concerning the expression
patterns or functions of these latter two NLRs in mammals.
Whereas NOD1, NOD3, NOD4 and NOD5 appear to be
conserved in bird and amphibian genomes, the gene for
NOD2 was identified in neither the chicken nor the frog
genomes. This would suggest that NOD2 has been deleted
from the genomes in these species, although the genome
of Xenopus tropicalis is, at present, incomplete. This is surprising since NOD2, in mammals, appears to be a highly
important sensor for intracellular microbial molecules.
However, chickens do possess a NALP3 ortholog (see
below) representing another potential PRR for muramyl
dipeptide [22] and may functionally replace NOD2 in this
species.
Members of the NALP subfamily are also evident in lower
vertebrates. Six genes were identified in zebrafish (Zv6)
for NALP-like molecules (NLR-B1 to -B6), and ten predicted NALP-like genes (nicknamed NALPa to NALPj)
were found for Xenopus. These genes clustered separately
for each species, suggesting recent duplication events
formed the NALP subfamilies independently in fish,
amphibians and mammals. The closest human ortholog
of the amphibian and fish NALPs appears to be NALP6. A
single NALP-like sequence predicted in the chicken
genome (ENSGALG00000005155) and in the Uniprot
database (Q5F3J4) clusters closest to the group of human
NALPs 1, 3, 10, and 12 when analyzed phylogenetically
(although not with strong bootstrap support) and has
recently been given the name NLRP3 (previously designated CIAS1/NALP3). Chicken NALP was identified on
chromosome 5, separate to the chicken NOD5 gene (chro-

mosome 24). Although sequence variation makes accurate comparisons difficult, it is likely that this chicken
gene arose from a distinct NALP than the fish and
amphibian NALPs, with the ancestral NALP(s) possibly
lost from the genome. The discovery of multiple NALPlike proteins in lower vertebrates contradicts a recent
hypothesis by Hughes suggesting that the NALP subfamily
evolved only in mammals [15], with clear evidence that a
gene encoding the NACHT domain of at least one NALP
(possibly a NALP6-like gene) was present prior to the fishtetrapod split. Zebrafish NALPs are situated at two distinct
chromosomal locations, four of these genes (NLR-B1 to B4) are located on chromosome 2, and the other two
(NLR-B5 and -B6) can be found near NLR-A5 on chromosome 15; the new assembly of the zebrafish genome (Zv7)
suggests these two sequences may represent the same
gene. It should be pointed out that although chicken
NLRP3 has an N-terminal PYRIN domain, the N-terminal
domains for the Xenopus and zebrafish NALPs were not
identified. One exception was NLR-B2, which appears to
have a domain that resembles a CARD and not a PYRIN
domain as would be expected from its similarity to the
mammalian NALPs. No PYRIN domains are observed for
the Xenopus NALP-like sequences and, other than the PYCARD protein (prediction ENSXETT00000004042), no
PYRIN domains were predicted in the Xenopus genome.
These observations may reflect that early ancestors of
NALPs lacked these effector domains and later acquired
the PYRIN domain (or CARD domain in the case of NLRB1). Whether these NALP-like genes encode functional
PRRs in poikilotherms remains uncertain, however, NLRB2 transcript was detectable in zebrafish intestine, spleen
and liver suggesting this may represent a functional gene.
In addition to the NOD- and NALP-like subfamilies, a
unique subfamily of NLRs was identified in teleost fish,
and designated NLR subfamily C (NLR-C). This subfamily
is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, all teleostei
genome (and EST) databases show numerous NLR-C
genes, amounting to several hundred of these genes in a
single species. Secondly, these genes all possess a central
NACHT domain that is highly similar to the NACHT
domain of NOD3 (NLR-A3) suggesting they evolved from
a NLR-A3-like molecule, yet many of these genes possess
a PYRIN domain at their N-terminus making them more
structurally similar to mammalian NALP molecules.
Finally, following the LRR domain many of these molecules (representatives found in all bony fish) possess a
B30.2 (PRY-SPRY) domain, which may allow them to
interact with distinct molecules to standard NLRs and
thus perform some novel function. B30.2 domains are
also found on some tripartite motif containing (TRIM)
proteins [23] and on the PYRIN molecule [24] (Fig 2) and
have several roles related to immunity. TRIM5a has been
shown to inhibit retroviral activity by directly binding the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/42

capsid of the HIV retrovirus [25], and PYRIN has been
shown to inhibit the activity of caspase-1 by directly binding to the active site of this enzyme [24], both using their
B30.2 domains for these interactions. Each of these functions would fit with the role of NLRs as intracellular PRRs;
the ability to bind viruses could be an extension of the
pattern detection system attributed to the neighboring
LRR domain, while the potential to inhibit caspase-1
activity may make NLR-C molecules important negative
regulators of the inflammasome in teleost fish. The latter
function would reflect gene families of cell surface receptors such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)
[26] or novel immune-type receptors (NITRs) [27] that
possess many inhibitory receptors and a small number of
stimulatory receptors for controlling cellular activation. It
is also interesting that these molecules all contain a
NACHT domain similar to NOD3, since mammalian
NOD3 has an inhibitory role in T cells [21]. Importantly,
since the predicted N- and C-termini of some NLR-Cs are
structurally similar to the two domains of the PYRIN molecule, this would also fit with a potential function of mimicking PYRIN. However, additional studies are required to
determine what, if any, role in the immune system NLR-C
molecules may play.
The evolutionary processes generating the vast subfamily
of NLR-C genes are not clear and appear very complex.
The relationships are further confused by apparent errors
in the assembly of the zebrafish genome (Zv6 versus Zv7),
as evidenced by clear differences in the mapping of some
NLR-C genes to their predicted chromosomes between
assembly versions [see Additional file 2]. However, evidence suggesting tandem duplications of individual genes
within a chromosomal locus is consistent between Zv6
and Zv7, which result in NLR-C genes adopting new exons
encoding distinct N-terminal domains and/or C-terminal
domains via exon-shuffling. The clusters of tandem NLRC genes appear to have undergone en bloc duplication, to
generate further clusters in the same locus (cis duplication), or within distinct loci or chromosomes (trans duplication) through translocation. Single genes may also have
duplicated independently multiple times, within established loci and to create new loci, prior to and following
formation of new gene structures. A large scale duplication of this gene family may be explained by the teleostspecific genome duplication event (3R) occurring early in
the evolution of teleost fish, which followed two rounds
of complete genome duplication (2R) observed early in
the evolution of the vertebrate lineage [28]. Should this be
the case, mutations and deletions of many of the duplicated genes would be expected, to remove redundancy
from the genome [29]. Therefore, many NLR-C genes may
be non-functional genes or pseudogenes, although a
small number have likely established new functions.
Clearly, it is too early to assign functionality to these

presumably translated into protein products. Transcripts
for NLR-C were detected, in this study, in three distinct tissues in naïve zebrafish, and many more can be identified
in the EST databases for this fish species.

ertoires of these molecules throughout vertebrates and
invertebrates. Although there are still many members of
the NLR family that require functional characterization,
their implication as regulators of immunity is highly
intriguing and warrants future investigation.

A CIITA-like gene was identified in the zebrafish genome
(Zv7) and is an important molecule, in mammals, for
controlling the expression of both major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules and therefore is
significant for antigen presentation to T lymphocytes.
Defects in human CIITA gene expression have been linked
to several immune disorders [5]. However, alternative
molecules have been implicated in the induction of antigen presentation pathways [30], including other members
of the NLR family, such as NALP12 [31]. NAIP/IPAF
homologs have been identified in the sea urchin [16]
implying that the ancestral NLR resembled one of these
molecules. However, neither NAIP nor IPAF was identified in the fish genomes at this time, although IPAF was
evident in the frog genome, suggesting that the genes for
these molecules may have been lost from the fish
genomes during the teleost-specific genome duplication
event.

Methods

Conclusion
In summary, the NLR gene family contains several members in all vertebrates, and at least one prototypical gene
must have existed prior to the evolution of vertebrates.
Clearly, there are some losses and gains of NLR genes in
the genomes of distinct species thus shaping unique rep-

Identification of NLRs in non-mammalian vertebrates
The amino acid sequences for human NLRs were obtained
from UNIPROT (Release 9.0) [32]. These are listed in
Table 1, with recently defined nomenclature assigned at
HGNC [3]. Predicted genes for non-mammalian NLRs
were identified in the UNIPROT database and at
ENSEMBL [33] for chicken Gallus gallus, pipid frog Xenopus tropicalis, Japanese pufferfish Fugu rubripes, green spotted pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis and zebrafish Danio
rerio, by using the BLAST algorithm to search for
sequences with similarity to human NLRs [34]. Gene predictions were also identified in ENSEMBL by keyword
searches for NACHT, PYRIN or CARD domains. EST
sequences for these species were identified by BLASTbased searching the TIGR gene indices [35] or the "other
vertebrate EST" section of GenBank at NCBI, and used to
confirm and correct the gene predictions. The unique
NACHT-LRR-B30.2 arrangement for NLR-C was determined by completely sequencing zebrafish EST
CK126487 [GenBank:EF613347]. The EST was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Image number 7049223) and sequencing was carried out
in-house using an ABI 3030 automated sequencer, univer-

sal (SP6/T7) and gene specific primers (located in Table 6)
and BigDye V3.1.
Chromosomal locations for the NLRs were deduced by
matching the translated NLR sequences against the
genomes using BLAT [36] at the UCSC Genome Browser
database [37]. Specific domains within the zebrafish NLRs
were confirmed by searching the Conserved domain database (CDD v 2.09) [38] at NCBI, by comparison to the
PFAM hidden Markov Model (HMM) logos [39] and by
direct comparison to putative mammalian orthologs.
Genome versions used during these analyses are G. gallus
assembly version 2.1 (May 2006), X. tropicalis assembly
version 4.1 (August 2005), T. nigroviridis assembly version
7 (February 2004), T. rubripes assembly version 3 (August
2002) in BLAT and version 4 (December 2005) in
ENSEMBL, and D. rerio assembly version 6 (March 2006).
Following submission of this manuscript, assembly version 7 of the zebrafish genome became available, and all
gene predictions were reanalyzed against this assembly.
Data from Zv7 are available in supplementary tables [see
Additional file 2].
Phylogeny of NLRs
The phylogenetic relationships between zebrafish NLRs
and human NLRs were predicted using both the maximum evolution and neighbor-joining methods within the
MEGA 3.1 program [40]. Partial amino acid sequences
from the NACHT domain (from regions corresponding to
the GxxGxGKS motif to the FAAFY sequence signature of
human NOD2) were used in the analyses as this region
was clearly identified in all NLRs. Further analysis of the
NLR-A and NLR-B subfamilies including frog and chicken
NLRs were performed using the same methods. All trees
were constructed from CLUSTALW generated alignments
[41], using Poisson correction, complete deletion of gaps,
and bootstrapped 1000 times.
Expression of zebrafish NLRs
The specific expression patterns of the NLR gene family in
zebrafish tissues were investigated. Zebrafish (Ekwill
strain) were obtained from Ekwill Fish Farm, FL and
reared in sand-filtered and UV-treated freshwater at a constant temperature of 24°C. Fish were fed a daily ration of
adult zebrafish diet (Zeigler). Genomic DNA was
extracted from fin tissue using the DNeasy extraction kit
(Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. The
spleen, liver and intestinal tissues were removed from two
individuals and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy RNA
extraction kit with in-column DNAse treatment (Qiagen)
following manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was
purified and cDNA was synthesized as previously
described [42]. A control, containing liver RNA but lacking reverse transcriptase, was also synthesized. The 20 µL
cDNA synthesis reactions were diluted to a final volume

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/42

100 µL and stored at -20°C until use. PCR amplifications
were performed in a 25 µl final reaction volume containing 2 µL of diluted cDNA, reagents from the Taq core PCR
kit (Qiagen) and 12.5 pM of each primer. Primer pairs
used to detect transcripts for each NLR gene are listed in
Table 6 with their sequences. Cycling conditions for all
amplifications consisted of 95°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, followed by final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Amplified
products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
