Abstract
Background: A cross-sectional study on 625 Female Sex Workers (FSWs) was conducted
between 2000 and 2002 in 6 cities in Argentina. This study describes the genetic diversity and the
resistance profile of the HIV-infected subjects.
Results: Seventeen samples from HIV positive FSWs were genotyped by env HMA, showing the
presence of 9 subtype F, 6 subtype B and 2 subtype C. Sequence analysis of the protease/RT region
on 16 of these showed that 10 were BF recombinants, three were subtype B, two were subtype
C, and one sample presented a dual infection with subtype B and a BF recombinant. Full-length
genomes of five of the protease/RT BF recombinants were also sequenced, showing that three of
them were CRF12_BF. One FSW had a dual HIV-1 infection with subtype B and a BF recombinant.
The B sections of the BF recombinant clustered closely with the pure B sequence isolated from the
same patient. Major resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs were found in 3 of 16 (18.8%)
strains.
Conclusion: The genetic diversity of HIV strains among FSWs in Argentina was extensive; about
three-quarters of the samples were infected with diverse BF recombinants, near twenty percent
had primary ART resistance and one sample presented a dual infection. Heterosexual transmission
of genetically diverse, drug resistant strains among FSWs and their clients represents an important
and underestimated threat, in Argentina.

Background
The genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) was recognized early in the epidemic. Phy-

logenetic analyses of HIV-1 have revealed the presence of
9 subtypes (A-D, F-H, J and K) and at least 34 circulating
recombinant forms (CRFs) worldwide. A great variety of

unique recombinant structures have also been identified
[1]. Previous studies have highlighted the complex nature
of the HIV epidemic in Argentina and revealed the presence of two independent epidemics: one among men who
have sex with men (MSM) where the viral strains are
mostly subtype B, and the second among heterosexuals
and injecting drug users (IDUs) where BF recombinants
predominate [2,3]. Further sequencing studies have
revealed the presence of a new CRF, CRF12_BF [4]. More
recently, phylogenetic analysis of strains from Argentina
has described different subtypes and recombinants in
newly diagnosed patients [5], including one triple recombinant between subtypes B, C and F [6].
Female sex workers (FSWs) have been at high-risk of infection since the beginning of the HIV epidemic all over the
world. Multiple sex partners, irregular condom use, and
co-infection with other sexual transmitted infections
(STIs) are the principal risk factors for HIV infection
among FSWs [7]. During March 2000 and March 2002, a
cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted
among 625 FSWs in six cities in Argentina (Buenos Aires,
Salta, Rosario, Córdoba, Mendoza and La Plata) with the
objective of estimating the HIV prevalence and associated
risk factors [8]. The findings of this study clearly indicated
that this population of FSWs was found to be at high risk
of STIs, as illustrated by the high prevalence found for
syphilis (45.7%), hepatitis B (14.4%), HIV (3.2%), hepatitis C (4.3%), and HTLV-I/II (1.6%) infections. The study
also showed that this group has sexual contact with men
from other countries: 51.2% of them reported having had
sexual contact with foreigners, mostly from Brazil and
Paraguay. In addition, FSWs have multiple exposures due
to the number of sex partners they have over time (mean
per week: 14).
The main objective of this retrospective study was to
describe the genetic diversity and antiretroviral resistance
profile of HIV strains among Argentinean FSWs who represent an important core group, which can serve as a link
with subsequent transmission to the heterosexually active
population at-large.

Methods
Study population
Details of the enrollment and data collection procedures
for this study have been reported previously [8]. FSWs (n
= 625) were recruited through a non-governmental organization (AMMAR: Asociacion de Mujeres Meretrices de
Argentina) for a cross-sectional seroprevalence study.
Confidential one-on-one interviews were conducted onsite by health care workers. During these encounters, the
study was explained and subjects were invited to participate. Only those subjects who were willing to participate
were provided written informed consent, enrolled, and

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/58

sampled. Study participants were interviewed using a
standardized questionnaire with information regarding
sociodemographic characteristics, sexual practices, current
or past use of illegal drugs, and prior history of STIs. FSWs
declared not to be under HIV antiretroviral treatment.
This research was reviewed by the institutional review
boards and scientific ethical committees at the University
of Buenos Aires and at the U.S. Naval Medical Research
Center (NMRC) in the United States and was conducted
in compliance with all federal regulations governing the
protection of human subjects.
Blood sampling and genotyping procedures
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIVinfected FSWs recruited during the seroprevalence study
were obtained, separated by Ficoll-Hypaque technique
and maintained at -70°C. PBMCs were used for DNA
extraction by the QIAmp DNA extraction kit (QIAgen,
Valencia, CA, USA). All 17 samples were subjected to PCR
amplification in env, 16 were amplified at the protease/
reverse transcriptase (pro/RT) region, and 6 samples were
subjected to near full-length amplification. The env region
was amplified using ED3/ED14 as outer primers and
ED31/ED33 as inner primers. Heteroduplex mobility
assay (HMA) was performed with the second-round PCR
products using nine reference standards as previously
described [9]. The pro/RT region was amplified using
Por5F/RT3474R in the first round and Pro3F/ProRT for
the second round. The conditions of the PCR amplification have been previously described [10].

Near full-length sequences were done with primers
MSF12b and OFMR1 for the first-round. The secondround amplification was completed using 1 μl of the firstround product and primers F2NST and UNINEF 7. This
nested strategy amplifies about 9000 kb of the HIV
genome and was slightly modified from that used previously [11,12]. The amplified products were then
sequenced with Big Dye terminators using an ABI 3100
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City
CA).
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by first aligning the
sequences obtained with reference sequences using the
program MacGDE [13] followed by a Neighbor-joining
method with Kimura's two-parameter model of distance
calculation; bootstrap analysis was performed with 100
replicas. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using
MEGA3 [14,15]. Recombinant analysis was performed
using SimPlot v.3.5.1 [16].
Resistance profile
The genotypic antiretroviral drug resistance profile was
examined by examining for mayor mutations which have

Results
Characteristics of the study participants
A total of 625 FSWs were enrolled in the seroprevalence
study and 20 tested HIV positive, reflecting a prevalence of
3.2% [8]. These HIV positive samples were from different
cities in the country, one from La Plata (1/100, 1.0%), two
from Cordoba (2/86, 2.3%), two from Mendoza (2/33,
6.1%), five from Salta (5/98, 5.1%) and ten from Buenos
Aires (10/296, 3.4%). No infections were detected in
Rosario (0/12)
Genetic Characterization
Heteroduplex Mobility Assay (HMA)
Out of 20 HIV positive samples, envelope HMA was completed in 17 samples. As shown in Table 1, env subtype F
was found in 52.9% (n = 9), subtype B in 35.3% (n = 6)
and subtype C in 11.8% (n = 2).
Sequencing analysis
Sequencing analysis of the pro/RT region was performed
in 16 of the samples (there was no sufficient pro/RT gen
amplified product in one sample). Phylogenetic analysis
of these samples is shown in Figure 1. Ten samples
(62.5%) were found to be BF recombinants, three were
subtype B, two were subtype C, and one sample presented
a dual infection with subtype B and a BF recombinant.

All of the samples that were characterized as subtype F (n
= 9) by envelope HMA, were BF recombinants in the pro/
RT gen region (Table 1). The two samples classified as subtype C by HMA were also subtype C in pro/RT gen region.
Of the samples that were characterized as subtype B by
envelope HMA (n = 6), 3 were subtype B in pro/RT and
one was a BF recombinant. The near full-length genomes
of 5 of the pro/RT BF recombinants were also sequenced
(Figure 2). Simplot and Bootscan analysis of these 5 samples showed that 3 of them were CRF12_BF and 2 were
unique recombinant forms (URFs, data not shown). The
2 subtype C strains significantly clustered with subtype C
from Brazil.
Double Infection (sample 01AR4008TS)
Participant 01AR4008TS was discovered by chance to
have a dual infection. This sample was characterized as

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/58

subtype B by envelope HMA and subsequently the pro/RT
region was amplified and the sequence was characterized
as a BF recombinant. The sample was then amplified to
obtain a near full-length genome to corroborate the
results obtained from the pro/RT, however, the amplicon
resulting was non-recombinant subtype B. In order to
exclude possible contamination or mixing of samples, the
near full-length PCR was repeated; obtaining a BF recombinant that matched the BF pro/RT previously obtained.
Simplot and Bootscan analysis of the BF recombinant was
performed with a B consensus with reference samples and
the B strain found in the same patient. The results
obtained showed that the B regions of the BF recombinant
were closer to the strain found in the same patient than to
the subtype B consensus (Figure 3). The same result was
obtained when consensus sequence of subtype B was performed with samples from Argentina.
Phylogenetic analysis concatenating the B parts of the full
length BF recombinant and using other samples from
Argentina, showed that the B region of the BF recombinant and the subtype B isolate were closely related, with
a bootstrap value of 100% (Figure 4). This FSW was in her
twenties, and unmarried. She reported having been a sex
worker for 8 years, with an average of 12 clients per week,
and reported irregular use of condoms with clients. She
was diagnosed with a co-infection with Treponema pallidum and had no past history of illegal drug use.
Resistance Profile
Primary anti-retroviral resistance to reverse transcriptase
inhibitors was detected in 3 patients out of 16 studied,
leading to a rate of primary resistance of 18.8% (Table 1).
The major resistance mutations detected were: L74V,
K103N, M41L and V108I. L74V causes resistance to DDI
and ABC. K103N causes multi NNRTI resistance and
M41L multi NRTI resistance. Mutation V108I causes
resistance to NVP and EFV. Secondary mutations were
detected in samples 02AR4014 (T215N) and 00AR2140
(V179E).

Conclusion
This study shows, for the first time in Argentina, the
genetic variability of the HIV-1 viral strains circulating
among FSWs from different cities in Argentina. As stated
previously, Argentina has two predominant epidemics;
subtype B among men who have sex with men (MSM) and
subtype BF among IDUs and the heterosexually-active
population [2,3]. It is only recently that other subtypes
such as the CRF12_BF and subtype C have been identified
in Argentina. The presence of subtype C has been reported
previously among heterosexuals in Argentina and in most
countries of the South American region [17]. However,
subtype C is the most prevalent HIV subtype in the global
epidemic and it is also becoming important in the Brazil-

ian epidemic [18]. In this study, phylogenetic analysis
showed that the two subtype C samples found grouped
with the consensus sample from Brazil. This suggests that
subtype C has been recently introduced to Argentina and
it was possibly through Brazil. The potential evolution of
subtype C in the Argentinean epidemic will require future
molecular epidemiologic studies among heterosexuallyactive populations in this country.
The co-existence of subtype B and BF recombinants in the
population appears to be consistent with previous reports
in heterosexual women [2]. However, this is the first
report of a dual HIV infection with subtype B and a BF
recombinant where the BF recombinant shares the B section with the B sequence isolated from the same patient.
For recombination to occur between distinct HIV strains,
a single cell needs to be infected with different viruses,
both of which must integrate their genome into the cell
genome. The cell needs to transcribe the integrated
genome of both viruses and in the packaging process a
heterodimeric virus can be formed. This virus can then
infect another cell and recombination between the two
viral RNAs can occur during the reverse transcription process [19]. This dual infection may occur during the primary
infection or it may occur as a re-infection with a new viral
strain after the initial strain has established a chronic
infection. It is unknown if the double infection detected
in this subject (01AR4008) is the result of a dual infection
at the primary infection or if it is the result of a re-infection. It can be hypothesized, however, that the BF recombinant originated through a recombination between the B
strain presented in the patient and an F subtype or another

BF recombinant not detected. Likewise, the B strain could
have been generated from the B portion of a BF recombining with a B strain.
A similar case has been reported in the Nairobi sex worker
cohort [20]. In this case, one woman had evidence of both
superinfection and recombination. A first sequence of the
patient was entirely subtype A, and a new sequence
obtained 10 years later was A/C recombinant with a SimPlot demonstrating that the subtype A fragment in the AC
recombinant was derived from the original A subtype
sequence. As this study has two different time points, and
they use HTA (Heteroduplex Tracking Assay) to demonstrate that the subtype C sequence was not detectable as
minor species in the first sample, they can almost prove
that the event of intersubtype recombination resulted
from superinfection intra patient.
This study was not initially designed to detect dual infections, no follow-up was performed, and only one sample
of each FSW was analyzed. This limits the conclusion that
can be made, it is not known if these two related strains
originated in this patient or if they were acquired from
another person. It is important to point out that the identification of this dual infection was a chance event, there
was not systematic search for dual infections in the other
samples.
Most of the FSWs reported having had sexual relationships with multiple partners and thus were potentially
exposed to many HIV variants. It is important to see not
only the subtype distribution circulating in this group and

the event of the dual infection, but also the resistance profile that is circulating among them since this epidemic can
potentially spread the virus to the general population. The
presence of resistant viruses in this group should cause
concern to the public health community. Previous surveys
performed in Argentina reported prevalences of mutations between 7.7% [21] and 15.4% [22] in drug-naïve
patients and individuals with primary infection, respectively. The prevalence detected in our study shows to be
higher that the previously reported. However, this study
does not encompass the minimum number of patient (n
= 52) recommended by the World Health Organization
for HIV drug resistance survey [23].

dual infection with rapid disease progression [24]. For
this reason, HIV-infected FSWs should be warned that
safe-sex practices are still necessary to prevent superinfections and associated disease progression.
