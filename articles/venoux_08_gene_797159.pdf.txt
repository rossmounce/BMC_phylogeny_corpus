Abstract
Background: ASAP is a newly characterized microtubule-associated protein (MAP) essential for proper
cell-cycling. We have previously shown that expression deregulation of human ASAP results in profound
defects in mitotic spindle formation and mitotic progression leading to aneuploidy, cytokinesis defects and/
or cell death. In the present work we analyze the structure and evolution of the ASAP gene, as well as the
domain composition of the encoded protein. Mouse and Xenopus cDNAs were cloned, the tissue
expression characterized and the overexpression profile analyzed.
Results: Bona fide ASAP orthologs are found in vertebrates with more distantly related potential
orthologs in invertebrates. This single-copy gene is conserved in mammals where it maps to syntenic
chromosomal regions, but is also clearly identified in bird, fish and frog. The human gene is strongly
expressed in brain and testis as a 2.6 Kb transcript encoding a ~110 KDa protein. The protein contains
MAP, MIT-like and THY domains in the C-terminal part indicative of microtubule interaction, while the Nterminal part is more divergent. ASAP is composed of ~42% alpha helical structures, and two main coiledcoil regions have been identified. Different sequence features may suggest a role in DNA damage response.
As with human ASAP, the mouse and Xenopus proteins localize to the microtubule network in interphase
and to the mitotic spindle during mitosis. Overexpression of the mouse protein induces mitotic defects
similar to those observed in human. In situ hybridization in testis localized ASAP to the germ cells, whereas
in culture neurons ASAP localized to the cell body and growing neurites.
Conclusion: The conservation of ASAP indicated in our results reflects an essential function in
vertebrates. We have cloned the ASAP orthologs in mouse and Xenopus, two valuable models to study
the function of ASAP. Tissue expression of ASAP revealed a high expression in brain and testis, two tissues
rich in microtubules. ASAP associates to the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules, and represents
a key factor of mitosis with possible involvement in other cell cycle processes. It may have a role in
spermatogenesis and also represents a potential new target for antitumoral drugs. Possible involvement in
neuron dynamics also highlights ASAP as a candidate target in neurodegenerative diseases.

Background
Microtubules (MTs) are linear polymers which self-assemble from α-β tubulin heterodimers in the presence of GTP
[1-3]. They participate in a number of functions within
cells including chromosome movements in mitosis, vesicle and organelle motility, cell polarity, and flagellarbased motility [4-6]. During interphase, MTs are organized in astral arrays that radiate from the centrosome, and
function as a scaffold to direct organelle and vesicle trafficking. During mitosis, the centrosome mediates the
assembly and organization of the mitotic spindle that is
required for correct chromosome segregation.
This variety of roles is made possible by the dynamic
nature of the MT cytoskeleton, modulated by multiple
accessory proteins [7,8]. A delicate balance between MT
stabilizing and destabilizing proteins is believed to generate the MT dynamics observed in cells [9-14]. Molecules
regulating MT dynamics have been identified, and their
effects on the assembly of purified tubulin into MT determined. Several spindle proteins, including XKCM1 and
XMAP215 family members have been identified that
either stabilize or destabilize MTs by mediating the rapid
changes between polymerization and depolymerization
[8,15]. These proteins play an important role in spindle
formation. Another important group of spindle proteins
comprise motors of the kinesin and dynein families essential for mitotic progression [8,15-18], and the small
GTPase Ran [19-21].
MTs are especially abundant in testis and neurons. Celltype specific MTs, such as the Sertoli cell MTs and the
manchette and flagellum MTs of the spermatids, play
essential roles in spermatogenesis. Others are important
for flagellar-based motility. In neurons, their integrity is
essential to maintaining normal neuron morphology and
in the transport of materials between cell body and synaptic terminals. The MT network undergoes drastic changes
in neural cells at different developmental stages. For
instance, during neural proliferation, MTs assemble into
the highly organized mitotic spindle on entering mitosis.
In order to transmit signals, neurons stop dividing early in
development and direct their efforts towards the elaboration of elongated cellular processes. Neurons are thus terminally post-mitotic cells that no longer form mitotic
spindles. After the post-mitotic neurons are generated,
they extend a directional process and migrate towards
their destination, during which another MT network takes
place. MAPs have been shown to directly regulates MT
dynamics during many of these developmental processes.
We have recently characterized a novel human MAP
named ASAP (ASter-Associated Protein) [22] that was
renamed MAP9 in the nomenclature. ASAP localizes to
MTs in interphase, associates with the mitotic spindle dur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/406

ing mitosis, localizes to the central body during cytokinesis and directly binds to purified MTs by its COOHterminal domain. Overexpression of ASAP induces profound bundling of cytoplasmic MTs in interphase cells
and aberrant multipolar or monopolar spindles in mitosis. Depletion of ASAP by RNA interference results in
severe mitotic defects, inducing the formation of aberrant
mitotic spindle, delays in mitotic progression, defects in
chromosome congression and segregation, defective cytokinesis and cell death. We have also shown that ASAP is a
substrate of the oncogenic mitotic kinase Aurora-A [23].
The phosphorylated form of ASAP localizes to centrosomes from late G2 to telophase and to the midbody during cytokinesis. Aurora-A depletion induces a
proteasome-dependent degradation of ASAP. ASAP depletion provokes spindle-defects that are specifically rescued
by expression of a phosphorylation-mimetic ASAP
mutant indicating the need for ASAP phosphorylation by
Aurora-A for bipolar spindle assembly and mitotic progression. These previous results suggest a crucial role of
ASAP in the organization of the bipolar mitotic spindle,
mitosis progression and cytokinesis and highlight ASAP as
a putative target for cancer treatment.
Mice knock-out studies and Xenopus egg extracts have
allowed detailed studies providing valuable information
about the involvement of genes in regulatory pathways in
the first model, and MT, mitotic spindle formation and
cell cycle in the latter. In this report, we characterized the
structure of the ASAP gene in human and mouse. We identified the ASAP orthologs in different species in order to
perform phylogenetic and molecular evolution analyses
and cloned and characterized the murine and Xenopus
orthologs. We also show that ASAP is predominantly
expressed in testis and brain, especially in the germ cell
line and in the growing neurites, opening up new perspectives on ASAP functions.
All together, these results shed light on new putative functions of ASAP, in its role both in mitosis and post-mitotic
neurons, and provide new tools for the scientific community.

Results
ASAP orthologs
ASAP has been identified as a new MAP. By comparing the
ASAP cDNA and its deduced protein sequence with the
human genome and the putative transcripts of the
Ensembl database, we assigned the ASAP gene to chromosome 4q32.1. The ASAP gene is transcribed on the minus
strand, spans ~29.5 kb and contains 14 exons (Fig. 1).
BLAST searches identified a conserved potential homolog
in mouse (mASAP, 647 amino acids, 71% Protein
Sequence Identity or PSI) and partial Xenopus laevis (frog)
ESTs (Table 1). Comparison of human ASAP with the

published genomes of dog (Canis familiaris), chicken (Gallus gallus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and zebrafish
(Danio rerio) allowed us to identify ASAP homologs in
these species. BLAST searches in translated EST databases
using the tblastn option, identified ASAP transcripts in all
mammal species including primates, cow, pig, mouse, rat,
bat, squirrel, rabbit, cat, dog and elephant, as well as in
shrew, opossum, hedgehog, armadillo and platypus.
ASAP is also present in birds (chicken), fish (fugu,
zebrafish, medaka and stickleback) and frog (X. laevis and
X. tropicalis). We were able to identify the complete pro-

tein sequence in mouse, dog (643 amino-acids, >78%
PSI), chimpanzee (99% PSI), frog (38.7% PSI) and
zebrafish (23.5% PSI), and partial sequences in chicken
(>32% PSI). Invertebrate homologs were more difficult to
identify. Nevertheless, a distantly related 512-amino acid
protein, C34D4.1 (GenBank: NM_068725), that shares
~18.5% amino acid sequence identity and about 35%
sequence similarity with ASAP, was identified in the nematode C. elegans (Table 1). The highest degree of sequence
identity (31%) between ASAP and C34D4.1 is found in
the region spanning amino-acids 426–568 of ASAP.

Accession numbers of ASAP orthologs of selected species used in phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2). The numbers corresponding to the sequences used
in these analyses are underlined. Numerous references correspond to predicted transcripts and proteins. Different databases were searched:
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/, Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/index.html, XDB (Xenopus datbases, http://xenopus.nibb.ac.jp,
Wormbase http://wormbase.org.

Another distant but potential ortholog was found in sea
urchin (Table 1), a hypothetical protein sharing 17% PSI
and 38% sequence similarity with ASAP (not shown).
Most vertebrate orthologs are contained in chromosomal
regions that are syntenic to human (not shown), i.e., on
chromosome 3F1 in mouse (this region is syntenic with
human chromosome 4q32.1 as described in http://
www.broad.mit.edu/mouse/synteny/humanPlots.html,
chromosome 3 in chimpanzee (at 174 Mb), chromosome
15 in dog (at 55.9 Mb) and chromosome 4 in chicken (at
21.2 Mb). The X. laevis cDNA (645 amino-acids) was
assembled using clones AW764964 and AW764609
(Table 1). The zebrafish gene is located on chromosome 1
at 26.02 Mb and has a similar intron-exon structure to
that of human (not shown). Using the ASAP protein
sequences from selected species we performed a phylogenetic comparison using Clustalw with a bootstrap
method. As shown in Fig. 2, the human and dog proteins
are very similar (>78% PSI) whereas mouse ASAP is more
divergent. Although frog and fish ASAP are more distant
than those from the other species, they do not constitute
a separate family, since they have a similar topology and
share >32–38% PSI and >44–48% sequence similarity
with the human protein. Pairwise sequence comparisons
confirmed these results (Fig. 2B).
In addition, the multiple alignment used for the phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly conserved regions

(about 90% PSI between human, mouse and dog), i.e. the
N- and C-terminus ends (amino acids 1–98 and amino
acids 420–647, respectively), and a more divergent central
region (≤50% PSI). The N-terminus region contains no
known motifs or domains, whereas the C-terminus region
corresponds to the MAP domain and contains three
nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs (see below) (Fig.
2C).
To follow the evolution of the ASAP gene, we analyzed the
mouse gene and compared it with the human ortholog. As
shown in Fig. 1, the mouse gene is ~33.8 kb long, localizes
on chromosome 3F1 at 88.77 Mb and is also composed of
14 exons encoding a mRNA of ~2.7 kb. The predicted protein is also 647 amino-acids long and shares >71% PSI
with human ASAP. The coding exons have the same
lengths in both species, except for exons 2 (N-terminus)
and 14 (C-terminus) whose non-translated moieties vary
(not shown). Exon-intron junctions are identical (same
codon and amino acid positions) in both species (not
shown). In contrast, the intron length may vary considerably. We next compared human and mouse ASAP using
the PipMaker software. The dot plot of the percent identity plot (PIP) indicates the regions of similarity with the
mouse sequence and the location of repetitive sequences
(Fig. 3). Exons are conserved (≥ 75% on average), whereas
introns are more divergent with a nucleotide sequence
identity as low as <50% as is the case for introns between
exons 3–4 or 5–6, mainly due to insertions or deletions of

Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of ASAP from different species

Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of ASAP from different species. (A) Phylogenetic tree of the ASAP
protein from fish, frog, mouse, dog and human. The predicted protein sequences were compared using the ClustalW software
to generate a rooted phylogenetic tree using the bootstrap method. Branch length and bootstrap numbers are indicated. (B)
Pairwise comparison (%) of ASAP proteins between the species depicted in A. The values above the diagonal show protein
sequence identities, those under the diagonal show protein sequence similarities. These values were estimated using the Gap
program of the GCG package. (C) Clustal alignment of the phylogenetic analysis performed in (A) plus a partial chicken

repetitive sequences in either species. Interestingly, a ~1
kb region upstream of the first codon is conserved in the
two species and may therefore contain the promoter
region. One weak CpG island (67% GC) was identified in
the region 5 kb upstream of the first exon corresponding
to nucleotides -1371 to -879 before the ATG start codon
(not shown). Numerous transcription factor binding sites
including SP1 sites, CAAT, TATA and GC boxes were iden-

tified in the region 2 kb upstream of exon 1 using TFSCAN
(not shown).
ASAP domains and motifs
We next compared the ASAP protein sequence with the
databases using different programs. No obvious consensus or known motif was found, except discrete sequence
similarities for the C-terminal part (Figs. 2C and 4A). The

Dot plot of the percent identity plot (PIP) analysis of human and mouse ASAP gene regions. The human ASAP
sequence (hASAP) is represented on the x-axis, and the mouse sequence (mASAP) on the y-axis. The ATG start codon and
the 5' upstream region are indicated, showing that the two genes are conserved for ~1 kb upstream the coding region. Introns
differ between the two species by homology losses due to large insertion/deletion of repeats as examplified between exons 3
and 4, and exons 5 and 6.

N-terminal part of the human protein (amino-acids 1–
396) contains a conserved region (1–98), moderately conserved regions (148–187, 214–250, 368–392) and varia-

ble portions dispersed throughout the 99–396 region. The
C-terminal moiety (~410–630) is weakly homologous
with various proteins involved in binding microtubules

Domains and motifs of the ASAP protein
Domains and motifs of the ASAP protein. (A) Top: General structure of ASAP. The residues are numbered 1 (N-terminal end) to 647 (C-terminal end). The MAP domain is indicated as well as the coiled-coil regions (springs). The blue rectangle
indicates the region that is the most conserved during evolution in the N-terminal part (Fig. 2), orange boxes indicate moderatly conserved regions and uncoloured portions represent variable regions. Bottom: Detail of the MAP domain. This domain
contains a self similarity (SS) region as MAP1A, an MIT-like and an THY domain. The nuclear localization signals (NLS) are
boxed in red. MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MIT, microtubule interacting and trafficking domain; THY, thymosin beta

Protein self matrix of human ASAP. The comparison was performed using the Strider software (window 23 amino-acids, stringency 5 amino-acids). One region with self-similarity (SS-ASAP, amino-acids 420–610) corresponding to the region homologous to MAP1A, could be identified.

such as dynein (~27% sequence identity, GenBank:
AAN35824), kinesin (~26%, GenBank: AAG51044) and
MAPs (microtubule associated proteins) (MAP1A ~22%,
GenBank: AAB41132) (Fig. 4B). However, we found no
obvious consensus sequence reminiscent of particular
protein classes in the ASAP protein. The sequence similarity detected with the proteins described above is mainly
due to the richness of the ASAP C-terminal region in Lys
(K), Glu (E), Arg (R), and Ala (A) amino-acids.
In mammalian MAPs, the tubulin-binding domains are
basic regions containing repeats of charged amino acids as
is the case for MAP2, MAP4 and tau with a pI of 10 [2427]. MAP1B binds to microtubules via a basic domain
close to its N terminus, containing 19 repeats of the motif
KKE [28] and a pI of 9.65. Two regions of self-similarity,
referred to as SS1 and SS2, have been described in MAP1A,
due to the presence of repeats [29]. Although rich in
charged residues, these two regions contain no highly
conserved sequence motifs. The SS1 domain (residues
300 to 500), close to the N-terminus, contains 3 KKE
motifs with a pI of ~11.00 whereas the SS2 domain (residues 1307–1606) is acidic with a pI of 4.51, an unusual
feature for a MT-binding domain. The charged aminoacids are clustered in non-canonical groups of 3–5 residues separated by irregular intervals. We found a weak
sequence similarity of the C-terminal end of ASAP (amino
acids 411–631), with a region corresponding to the acidic
microtubule-binding region SS2 of MAP1A (amino acids
1353–1606), due to the Glu+Lys richness of both regions
but without significant conserved motifs (Fig. 4B).
Indeed, using a scrambled ASAP sequence generated using
RandSeq http://expasy.org/tools/randseq.html, we found
a significant similarity level in the same region, demonstrating a bias towards the amino acid composition of
MAP1A and ASAP in this region rather than conserved
motifs. However, given that the microtubule-binding
nature of this ASAP region has also been experimentally
demonstrated (Saffin et al. [22], and below in the "overexpression of ASAP deletion mutants" paragraph), we indicate it as a MAP region in Figs 2 and 4. A dotplot matrix

comparison of ASAP with itself identified a region with
self-similarity (amino acids 420–610, Fig. 4C), revealed as
sharing common features with SS1 with amino acid analysis (Table 2). The two regions are about the same length,
have the same charged amino acid composition and are
basic (pI ~11), in contrast to SS2 which is acidic with a pI
of 4.50. They also share different motifs such as KEE,
EKKE and EKKDK(E/D)K.
In addition, PSORTII software identified three NLS in the
ASAP C-terminal domain corresponding to amino acids
483–501, 508–524 (bipartite NLS) and 621–624 (monopartite NLS), respectively (Fig. 4A).
The ASAP secondary structure was predicted using a hierarchical neural network [30,31]. ASAP is mainly composed of alpha helix (~43% in the complete protein, and
>72% in the SS region, amino acids 420–610, Fig. 4A).
Similar results were obtained using either the mouse or
the frog ortholog. The SMART program [32,33] identified
two coiled-coil regions spanning amino acids 297–327
and 477–628 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a block of ~80
amino acids (420–500) composed exclusively of alphahelical structures was clearly identifiable from the predicted secondary structure in the SS domain. A search in

the PDB database for similar structures, and eye inspection allowed us to identify the MIT domain as possessing
similar characteristics [34] (Fig. 5): 3 conserved positively
charged residues (+), a unique conserved negatively
charged residue and a succession of polar and hydrophobic areas (50% of the positions are conserved, with ~33%
of the residues identical or similar to at least one of the
aligned MIT sequences). As shown in Fig. 2C, this region
is conserved during evolution, and the (+) and (-) amino
acid positions are conserved in most orthologs. Furthermore, in the scrambled ASAP sequence, we were unable to
identify any MIT-like domain, suggesting that the identification of this domain is not only due to a particular
amino acid composition. Therefore, although this region
was not identified as an MIT domain using conserved
domain search programs, we suggest that this region of
ASAP is an MIT-like domain. Although the function of
MIT domains remains unclear, one could reasonably
assume that they convey the capability to interact with
MTs as also described with spastin [35,36]. Another
region of the ASAP MAP domain shares sequence similarity with the THY motif (thymosin beta actin-binding
motif, Conserved Domain Database: smart00152) with
28% sequence identity (residues 565–597 of ASAP, Fig.
4A).
Finally, as a very rich Ser/Thr protein, ASAP contains several putative phosphorylation sites, among which two are
characterized and referenced on http://www.phos
phosite.org: the S625 determined by ourselves and necessary for spindle formation and mitosis completion [23] is
conserved only in mammals (Fig. 2C) and the S132 conserved in all vertebrate species as a SQ motif whose activation is typical of the ATM/ATR pathway in response to
DNA damage [37]. Other SQ sites are found across the
homologs but not significantly conserved.

Overexpression of Cter and Nter ASAP deletion mutants
In order to gain insight into ASAP function and provide
support to some sequence analysis data, we overexpressed
the Cter and Nter ASAP truncation mutants in U2-OS cell
lines (Fig. 6). As already described [22], the EYFP-ASAPNter fragment, deleted from its MAP domain led to a loss
of the fiber-like distribution in interphase cells, confirming that the MT interaction occurs via this CTer domain.
However, when this MAP domain was overexpressed
(EYFP-ASAP-Cter), the MT-bundling and co-localization
could still be observed but the protein appeared also as
distinct nuclear foci (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the NLS
localized in this domain became accessible. We were unable to determine whether these foci correspond to defined
nuclear organelles (not shown). We performed NLS mutations but since they are localized in the MAP domain, the
mutants no longer co-localized with the MT network and
showed a pattern similar to that observed with Nter
domain overexpression (not shown).
Mouse ASAP characterization
In order to develop the murine model as a tool, we cloned
the full-length mouse ASAP (mASAP) cDNA by RT-PCR
using total testis RNA and primers derived from the
sequence available at the time in the database
(XM_143366).

We first investigated if mASAP had the same endogenous
and overexpression patterns as its human counterpart. We
raised polyclonal antibodies against the full-length protein. Affinity-purified antibodies recognized an endogenous single protein band of ~110 kDa in NIH3T3 and
U2-OS cells, as observed with human ASAP (Fig. 7A,
right). The specificity of the antibodies was assessed by
comparing these profiles to that observed with the antiGFP antibody against EYFP-mASAP transfected cells (Fig.
7A, left), and to ASAP-depleted U2-OS cells by RNA interference (Fig. 7A, right). The endogenous signal disappeared in siRNA-transfected cells and the anti-mASAP

recognized the highest molecular form of EYFP-mASAP
(~137 KDa, highlighted by the EYFP-antibody) in the corresponding NIH3T3-transfected cells. It is noteworthy
that, as suspected by sequence comparison, the mouse
antibody is able to recognize the human protein. Unfortunately, as observed for the human antibodies, the two
antibodies generated against mASAP gave a significant
background in immunofluorescence studies. The same
ASAP localization was observed using several fixation
methods in U-2 OS (not shown) and NIH3T3 cell lines.
We observed an identical subcellular localization between
endogenous mASAP and human ASAP. Mouse ASAP colocalizes with the MT network in interphase. During mitosis it first relocates to the poles at the astral MTs and the
spindle during prometaphase, metaphase and early anaphase, and then to centrosomal MT asters and the central
spindle during anaphase and early telophase. During late
cytokinesis mASAP colocalizes with the midzone MT bundles when it is also located on MTs nucleated from centrosomes (Fig. 7B).
We then overexpressed the full-length EYFP-mASAP in U2 OS (not shown) and NIH3T3 cells. As observed for
human ASAP, the overexpressed mASAP induced bundles
of stabilized microtubules in interphase cells and the
same mitotic defects (i.e. an increased mitotic index with
more than 70% of monopolar spindles) [22] even in the
fibroblast-derived NIH3T3 cell line (Fig. 7C).

Tissue expression
To investigate ASAP expression, human multiple-tissue
Northen blots were probed with an ASAP cDNA probe. A
single ~2.6 kb transcript was detected in testis and a ~9 kb
one in brain (Fig. 8A). No detectable signals were found
in other tissues. To confirm these results, semi-quantitative RT-PCRs were performed on mouse total RNA. ASAP
was found to be strongly expressed in testis and brain and
to a lesser extent in heart, lung and ovary (Fig. 8B). Supporting these observations, the ASAP transcript is well represented among ESTs derived from different parts of the
brain and in testis libraries.

We then investigated if the protein was expressed in brain
and testis extracts. As shown in Fig. 8C, ASAP protein is
also strongly expressed as a 110 KDa protein in both tissues as observed in NIH3T3 and U2-OS cell line extracts.
No expression was found in spleen or colon tissues, or in
the colon-derived HT-29 cell line. It is noteworthy that in
brain no higher molecular weight protein was detected,
suggesting that the 9 Kb mRNA probably corresponded to
a partially spliced ASAP mRNA.
Since hASAP is involved in mitotic spindle formation, we
were not surprised to find the ASAP gene highly expressed
in a proliferative tissue such as testis. To determine
whether ASAP expression is indeed germ cell line specific,
we used in situ hybridization. In mouse testis, each sem-

Unfortunately, despite different trials of fixation, our antibodies proved not suitable for immunohistochemistry
experiments. However, as shown in Fig. 9A–B, we were
able to confirm ASAP immunoreactivity observed in seminiferous tubules as a specific cytoplasmic filamentous
staining when compared to the preimmune serum (Fig.
9C). We were unable to observe a real co-staining with αtubulin (not shown). ASAP expression may be stage specific since the hybridization is somehow stronger in some
tubules but an adequate antibody would be necessary to
confirm this.
In contrast, normal adult brain is a tissue containing
mainly non-proliferating cells. To analyze the expression
of ASAP in the brain, we performed immunofluorescence
on culture neural stem cells (NSC). In culture, these
multipotent cells self-renew, and after mitogen withdrawal, differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in predictable proportions. Here, we
addressed the question of whether ASAP is expressed during differentiation of NSC as a first step to studying the
possible role of ASAP during brain development. Mouse
cortical neural stem cells were isolated from CD1 mouse
embryos at 13.5 embryonic days. Nine days after differentiation, cells could be identified by immunocytochemistry
as neurons (β-III tubulin positive cells) or astrocytes
(GFAP positive cells) (Fig. 10A–D). We also analyzed the
pattern of expression of ASAP by immunocytochemistry.
ASAP was clearly detected in neuronal cells as demonstrated by co-labeling of cells with β-III tubulin and ASAP
antibody (Fig. 10E–H). ASAP was not detected in GFAP
positive cells. Therefore in this model, ASAP is specifically
expressed in the cell body and growing neurites of postmitotic neurons. Further experiments are necessary to
characterize the function of ASAP in brain.

Xenopus ASAP characterization
In order to develop Xenopus as a model system, we PCRscreened a Xenopus tadpole stage 24 library using primers
derived from EST databases. Only one partial cDNA clone
containing the N-terminal part of the sequence was isolated. The full-length clone was PCR-reconstructed using
an overlapping cDNA found in the database (see methods). Given the sequence divergence between human
ASAP and X-ASAP, we overexpressed the full-length EYFPX-ASAP in Xenopus XL2 cells to observe the subcellular
localization. Western blot analysis revealed an expression
of EYFP constructs at ~120 kDa, a molecular weight
slightly lower than that observed for hASAP or mASAP
(Fig. 11A). As observed for mammalian ASAP, overexpressed X-ASAP colocalized with interphasic and mitotic
MTS, showing the same localization as both mASAP and
hASAP (Fig. 11B). However, we observed neither bundles
nor monopolar spindles. Since the transfection level was
very low, it was quite difficult to observe transfected mitosis. This may be accounted for by abnormal mitotic cells
having undergone cell death.

Discussion
In a previous report, we demonstrated that ASAP/MAP9 is
a novel microtubule-associated protein required for a
proper cell cycle progression [22,23]. In this paper, we
detected homologs in all vertebrate species investigated
and potential orthologs in different invertebrates, thus
suggesting a requirement of ASAP in higher eukaryotes.
The coding sequence and exon-intron structure have been
conserved during vertebrate evolution, suggesting that
selective constraints are exerted on this gene to maintain
its function. These genes are also invariably located in
regions syntenic to the human locus, demonstrating common ancestry. Invertebrate and vertebrate ASAP also likely
derive from a common ancestor but which evolved independently after the separation of the two clades. This
would account for the low level of homology where

events such as insertion/deletion or exon shuffling shaped
the ASAP gene differently.

the vertebrate MAP region, other motifs such as NLS or an
MIT-like domain are also conserved (Fig. 2C).

The highly N-terminal conserved region 1–98 (Fig. 2C)
corresponds to no known conserved motif and its function remains to be elucidated.

The sequence similarity of ASAP with different proteins/
domains is concentrated in the C-terminal MAP domain
and seems connected to microtubule binding/dynamics
properties. For example, the character of ASAP as a microtubule binding protein is also found with the structural
domains that ASAP shares with MAP1A. In particular
there is a striking analogy with the self-similarity region
SS1 that is involved in binding microtubules [29]. Besides
MAP1A, ASAP is also weakly homologous to dynein and
kinesin, two motor proteins that bind to MTs, although
no motor activity was found in ASAP (not shown). On the
other hand, THY has been shown to be involved in the
cytoskeleton organization by binding actin monomers
and thus inhibiting actin polymerization. We also identified a potential MIT-like domain in the MAP domain of

Importantly, the C-terminal MAP region is the most conserved not only within vertebrates, but also between
invertebrates and vertebrates, suggesting that the conservation of the MAP function is essential. Indeed, the
sequence similarity with C34D4.1 (C. elegans) or with the
sea urchin protein (Table 1) is higher in the MAP region
(amino-acids 428–568 and 340–680, respectively).
C34D4.1 could be involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics since it contains stathmin domains [38]
that are known to be involved in the regulation of microtubule skeleton by acting on microtubule dynamics. In

ASAP. This domain was first described in proteins
involved in MT binding and in intracellular transport and
named MIT for it being "contained within microtubuleinteracting and trafficking molecules". For example the
MIT domain has been identified in spastin (responsible
for the dominant form of spastic paraplegia) [36], spartin
(recessive form of spastic paraplegia) [39], both proteins
that interact with microtubules, or VSP4 [40] which is
involved in the intracellular protein transport machinery
and the regulation of membrane association of several
proteins. As with spastin, ASAP overexpression causes perturbations in the MT network. The identification of
related MIT domains in ASAP, spastin and spartin may
therefore suggest the possible involvement of ASAP dysfunction in pathways leading to pathogenesis.

We have cloned the murine ortholog of ASAP and confirm
an intracellular pattern similar to its human counterpart.
We also showed that deregulation of this protein leads to
the same mitotic defects even in the fibroblast derived
NIH3T3 cell line, confirming that the phenotypes
observed in U2-OS cells were not due to the transformed
status of these cells. We have also cloned the Xenopus
ortholog and demonstrated a similar localization when
overexpressed. The identical subcellular ASAP localization
within the MT network between these species suggests an
evolutionary conservation of MAP function. However, the
mitotic defects were not observed in the Xenopus cell line
because of a lack of transfected mitosis, due either to low
transfection efficiency or to the lethal issue of these transfected mitotic cells.

Many MAPs regulated by Aurora-A and involved in spindle assembly (TPX2, NuMA, RHAMM, TACC3) are
nuclear in interphase and recruited after reorganization of
the different compartments (nuclear envelope, endogenous membrane structures). They are regulated via their
NLS by the small GTPase Ran, that releases and activates
them from bound importins [19,41]. The presence of
these conserved NLS may suggest the regulation of ASAP
by this pathway. In our fixation conditions, we observed
no ASAP in the nucleus accounted for either by a very
weak signal or by the fact that our antibody did not recognize the nuclear epitopes. However, when we overexpressed the Cter domain, we observed a localization of
ASAP as nuclear foci, suggesting that the NLS are functional and become accessibles in this mutant. However,
these nuclear foci could also suggest that ASAP, under certain conditions that need to be determined, has a nuclear
function. Indeed, these foci are reminiscent of those
observed after DNA damage. Although a putative BRCTdomain hit (amino acids 66–303) found in the ASAP protein sequence could not be confirmed with confidence, it
may nevertheless be indicative of a putative role of ASAP
in DNA damage, since BRCT domains are usually found in
proteins involved in the checkpoint DNA-damage
response. On the other hand, the S132, which is conserved in all vertebrates, corresponds to a SQ motif and
has been identified in a large-scale proteomic analysis of
proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage on
consensus sites recognized by ATM and ATR [37]. These
data hint towards ASAP playing a role in the DNA damage
response.

Tissue expression analyses have shown that ASAP is predominantly expressed in testis and brain. Such a distribution pattern has already been described for different
MAPs. For example, MAP2 is neural-specific but is also
expressed as a lower molecular weight isoform in the testis
[42]. The testis is one of the most abundant sources of MT
networks. These include mitotic and meiotic spindles, the
spermatid manchettes and axonemes, and the Sertoli cell
cytoskeleton. Some MAPs, such as E-MAP-115, are
required for spermatogenesis. Since ASAP is also
expressed in the ovary and is involved in the mitotic spindle formation of cultured cells [22], its strong expression
in this proliferative tissue is not surprising and a role in
the meiotic spindle could be possible. We have indeed
confirmed in a preliminary experiment that ASAP is specifically expressed in the germ cell line during spermatogenesis, and its expression may be stage-specific. One
might expect an expression in spermatogonia which
undergo rapid successive divisions or in spermatocytes
where meiosis takes place. Spermatogenesis is an intricately regulated morphogenetic process during which
many structural changes are necessary to produce mature
spermatozoa. Differentiation and polarization of the
round spermatid are associated with new microtubular
configuration, that resembles that of pachytene spermatocytes [43]. On the other hand, ASAP could be present in
the perinuclear theca which is a rigid cytoskeleton that
covers the entire nucleus of mammalian spermatozoa,
and could coat the acrosomal vesicle of round spermatids
before attachment to the anterior region of the nucleus.
Different MAPs, such as Ndel1 [44], E-MAP-115 [45],
MAP4 [46], and tau [47], are present in the spermatid.
Together with these proteins, ASAP could be involved in
nuclear shaping and the process of spermatid elongation.
Deciphering the exact location of ASAP expression will
require antibodies adapted for immunohistochemistry
experiments.

ASAP is very rich in Ser and Thr residues suggesting multiple putative phosphorylation sites. The S625 phosphorylated by Aurora-A is necessary for spindle assembly and
completion of mitosis, but is conserved only in mammals
(Fig. 2C) as the emergence of a new feature.

Microtubules are also essential for a number of cellular
processes that include the transport of intracellular cargo
or organelles across long distances. They are especially
abundant in neurons, where they exhibit an extreme state
of stability. They are involved in neuronal migration and
positioning during cortical development. After the postmitotic neurons are generated, they extend a directional
process and migrate towards their destination, during
which another MT network takes place. MAPs have been
shown to be the direct regulators of MT dynamics during
many of these developmental processes. In neurons, the
major MAPs include tau, MAP1A, MAP1B and MAP2.
These MAPs are phosphoproteins and the level of phosphorylation has been shown to regulate their activities to
stimulate MT assembly. Tau has been associated with different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease and frontotemporal dementia
associated with Parkinson's disease [48,49]. However,
several other proteins such as Ndel1, the partner of LIS1
involved in lissencephaly [50], ASPM involved in microcephaly [51], or spastin involved in hereditary spastic paraplegia [52], are also neuronal MAPs. The identification of
numerous MAPs and the progressive elucidation of the
mechanisms of MT assembly and transport are beginning
to have a profound impact on the study and treatment of
human genetic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease) (for
review see [53]). Here we have demonstrated the specific
expression of ASAP in neurons and growing neurites, suggesting an important role in the brain. It is noteworthy
that neuronal MAPs described above such as Ndel1, spastin and ASPM are also expressed at the mitotic spindles of
cell cultures [36,54,55]. Even though neurons are quite
dissimilar from typical interphase cells with regards to MT
distribution and organization, several observations suggest that axonal and dendritic arrays may be established
by mechanisms very similar to those used for the formation and function of the mitotic spindle [56].
Adult CNS neurons are considered as postmitotic but it
appears that these cells must keep their cell cycle in check
to avoid any reinitiation leading to an altered state. There
is now growing evidence that neurons at risk of neurodegeneration are also at risk of reinitiating a cell cycle process [57], and several neurodegenerative disorders are
related to cell cycle failures. In human, cell cycle events
(loss of cell cycle control) are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and
ataxia telangiectasia [58].

Conclusion
ASAP is a novel MAP whose expression defects provoke
aberrant mitoses leading to cell phenotypes reminiscent
to those observed in cancers. ASAP is phosphorylated by
the oncogenic mitotic kinase Aurora-A that plays a key

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/406

role in mitotic spindle formation and the cell cycle, highlighting ASAP as a potential new target for anti-tumoral
drugs [22,23]. In this work, evolutionary and expression
studies have shed light on new putative functions of ASAP
both as a germ cell line and neuronal MAP that could be
involved in spermatogenesis and neuronal developmental processes. Consequently, deregulation of ASAP expression in such tissues, as observed with other MAPs, may
lead to spermatogenesis defects or neurodegenerative disease. Although our analysis shows an evolutionary conservation of MAP function in ASAP, it also suggests also that
this protein might be involved in other cell cycle processes
such as DNA damage response. Our data also validate
mouse and Xenopus as models for further ASAP studies
using either knock-out or MT in vitro experiments.

Methods
Sequence analysis
We performed general database searching using the BLAST
program of the GCG package (University of Wisconsin)
[59]. Potential coding regions and gene structure were
identified by comparison of the cDNA sequences with the
genome sequences and the predicted transcripts http://
www.ensembl.org, and examination by eye. We performed sequence comparisons using the Clustalw v. 1.8
software package [60] and PipMaker [61]http://
bio.cse.psu.edu/. Clustalw was used for the phylogenetic
analysis and the tree was constructed using the neighbor
joining method [62], based on the number of amino acid
substitutions. The numbers on internal branches represent the frequency of occurrence among 1000 trees (bootstrap method with the Clustalw package). Clustal
alignment was visualized using Jalview and clustal X colour codes were used as defined in the Jalview options
[63]. PipMaker was used for determining local alignments
of human and mouse genes. Gap-free segments are displayed in a PIP (percent identity plot) and the corresponding dot-plot. We searched CpG islands using the
cpgplot software from EMBOSS [64]http://bioweb.pas
teur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/cpgplot.html. Transcription factor binding sites were searched using TFSCAN from
EMBOSS http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/tfs
can.html and promoter regions were searched using the
neural network promoter prediction software http://
www.fruitfly.org/cgi-bin/seq_tools/promoter.pl.

Protein domains and motifs were searched using the following programs and databases: phi- and psi-blast programs of the NCBI platform, SMART [32,33]http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/, prosite http://www.expasy.ch
/prosite/, pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/, MotifScan

Secondary structures was predicted using a hierarchical
neural network (HNN [30,31], http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/)

and then exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette for one
week.

Cter and Nter ASAP deletion mutants sub- cloning
The truncation mutants EYFP-ASAP-Cter (420–647) and
EYFP-ASAP-Nter (1–420, that corresponds to the EYFPΔCter described in [22]) were constructed in pEYFP-C1
(Clontech, EYFP in N-ter) and pEAK-EGFP ((EGFP in Cter). Since the same patterns were obtained in overexpression, only the EYFP constructions are presented in the
results section.

To assay mRNA transcripts expression in mouse, total cellular RNA was extracted from normal adult mouse tissues
using the GenElute Total Mammalian Total RNA kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA were treated with DNAse (DNA-free kit
from Ambion) as indicated by the manufacturer. cDNA
synthesis and PCR amplification were performed with
Superscript one-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen), using 200 ng of
total RNA. Each element of a primer pair was chosen in
different exons to discriminate with possible contaminations by genomic DNA (mFIS2F: 5'-AAGTGAAGACAGAAACACGAAG-3'; mFIS1R: 5'-CTGTGCATTTCATGTAA
ATACAC-3'), and amplification was performed for 30
cycles during which the exponential phase of PCR amplification was maintained. GAPDH cDNA was amplified for
24 cycles with the primers GAPDH1: 5'-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT-3' and GAPDH2: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3'. Ten microliters of PCR products were
analyzed on a 1% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.

Mouse and Xenopus cDNA cloning
BLAST analyses revealed a full-length mouse cDNA clone
in the databases. We obtained the mouse ASAP cDNA
(mASAP) by RT-PCR using total testis RNA and primers
derived from the mouse sequence (mASAP-1F: 5'-ATGTCCGATGAAATCTTCAGCAC-3' and mASAP-1R: 5'AAATACTTTTGAGGGCGCAGTTC). The resulting cDNA
was cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Mouse
cDNA was subcloned into EYFP-C1 (Clontech) and
pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham) vectors.

At that time, BLAST analyses did not reveal any available
partial or full-length Xenopus cDNA clone (X-ASAP). We
PCR-screened primary and secondary DNA pools of X. laevis tadpole stage 24 (Library N° 725, RZPD, Germany)
using primers derived from the AW 764609 and AW
764964 sequences that contained a partial cDNA X-ASAP
sequence (X2F: 5'-AAAGCAGCATTTGAGGCATGG-3' and
X1R: 5'-TGATAGCGGTTATAGTATCGTTC-3'). We isolated
a single partial ORF clone (XL1) that also lacked the 3'
end. However, this clone was overlapping with XL402j02
http://xenopus.nibb.ac.jp and was kindly provided by the
NIBB (NBRP Xenopus ANE library) [65]. A full cDNA clone
was reconstructed by PCR, cloned into a TOPO-TA cloning vector and fully sequenced. Xenopus cDNA was subcloned into EYFP-C1.
Generation and affinity-purification of polyclonal mouse
ASAP antibodies
Polyclonal rabbit sera to the full-length mouse protein
were raised against the corresponding GST fusion protein
purified from bacteria E. coli BL21RP+. The antibodies
were affinity purified on a GST column followed by a GSTmASAP fusion protein affinity column. Antibodies were
routinely used at 1:500 for immunofluorescence and
1:5000 for western blots.
Tissue expression
Two human tissue northern blots (MTN I and MTN II,
Clontech) were probed with a random-primed
[32P]dCTP-labelled ASAP cDNA. Hybridizations were
performed at 42°C and the blots were washed at high
stringency according to the manufacturer's instructions,

To assay mASAP protein expression in mouse, 1 to 2 mg
of each tissue were directly crushed and lysed 2 h in (50
mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 50% glycerol, 1% β-mercapto-ethanol) buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After 15 min centrifugation at 13000
rpm, supernatant was collected and proteins were analyzed by western-blot as described below.
Cell culture and transfections
All cell culture media and additives were obtained from
Sigma. Human U-2 OS and Mouse NIH3T3 cells were routinely grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, and
penicillin/streptomycin. Where indicated, cells were synchronized by a thymidine-block (2 mM) 24 h, released
and analyzed at S, G2 or M phases. Xenopus XL2 cells were
grown in L-15 medium as described [66]. U-2 OS and
NIH3T3 cells were transfected using JetPei (Polyplus),
while XL2- cells were transfected using the Amaxa-nucleofector system (solution T, program T-20), following the
manufacturer's instructions. Human ASAP siRNA
sequence and transfection procedure are described in
[22].
Antibodies
Antibodies were used at dilutions or concentrations stated
by the manufacturer, for both western blotting and
immunofluorescence microscopy, unless indicated otherwise. Primary antibodies used were anti-α-tubulin (DM
1A, Sigma), anti β-tubulin (TUB 2.1, Sigma), anti-γ-tubulin (GTU-88, Sigma), anti-GFP (Zymed); mouse polyclonal anti-ASAP (1/500 for immunofluorescence and 1/

3000 for western blotting). Secondary antibodies used for
immunofluorescence were coupled to Alexa Fluor 488-,
Alexa Fluor 546- or Alexa Fluor 642-conjugated goat antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1/1000, Molecular Probes).
Secondary antibodies used for the immunoblots were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1/
5000, Zymed). Hoechst 33258 was purchased from
Sigma.
Cell extracts and Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plate,
and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris
pH8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40) supplemented with 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail
tablet (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors. After 15 min
on ice, lysed cells were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10
min at 4°C. Ten to 15 mg of murine brain or testis were
directly lysed in 1 ml of Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris
pH8.0, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-Mercaptoethanol).
Protein concentrations in the cleared lysate were determined using a Bradford assay, and equal amounts were
loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Schleicher
and Schuell) and were detected by various antibodies and
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent reagents
(Supersignal West-PicoPico, Pierce Chemical).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed either by incubation
in 4% paraformaldehyde in MTSB (Microtubule Stabilization buffer: 100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 4% PEG 8000,
pH 6.9) 10 minutes at room temperature followed by
0.5% Triton X-100/MTSB for 5 min (PAF/MTSB fixation)
or by incubation in formaldehyde 3.6% in PHEM (60 mM
Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, pH
6.9) for 10 minutes followed by methanol 1 minute at
room temperature (F/PHEM/methanol fixation). Fixed
cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the primary antibody, and 30 min at 37°C with the secondary antibody.
All antibodies were diluted in PBS/3% BSA. Coverslips
were mounted using Gel-Mount (Biomedia). Images were
acquired on a Leica DM6000B fluorescence or a confocal
Leica TCS SP2 microscopes using CCD cameras and subsequently processed by the Metamorph or LCS LEICA confocal softwares, respectively.
Cryosection and Immunofluorescence
Testis tissues were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 3.7%
(vol/vol) paraformaldehyde/PBS for 18 h at 4°C, washed
twice in PBS, and incubated overnight in 30% (wt/vol)
sucrose/PBS. Samples were embedded in OCT medium
(Tissue-Tek) and frozen at -70°C, and serial 12 μm sections were cut with a cryostat (Leica). After drying, the sections were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min. Tissue sections

mASAP rabbit serum (used at a 1/500 dilution) were as
described [67].
Culture of mouse cortical neural stem cells and
immunocytochemistry
The protocol used was described in Milhavet et al. [68]
with minor modifications: during proliferation cells were
cultured in a medium containing DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France) with modified
N2 supplement and 25 ng/ml of Basic fibroblast growth
factor (βFGF, Abcys, France). βFGF was added daily and
medium changed every two days. Undifferentiated cells
cultured in presence of βFGF expressed primarily nestin,
an intermediate filament protein expressed in neural stem
cells and progenitors, whereas β-III tubulin, a neuronal
marker and GFAP, an astrocytic marker, were not. After
two passages, cells at 80% confluence were differentiated
by removal of βFGF in a culture medium containing 50%
of DMEM-F12 with modified N2 supplement and 50%
Neurobasal with B27 supplement (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France). During differentiation
the medium was changed every two days. Cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.15% picric acid in PBS,
and standard immunocytochemical protocols followed
before observation with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. The following primary antibodies were used: ASAP
rabbit antibody at 1:500, β-tubulin type III (Tuj1) monoclonal antibody at 1:1000 (Covance Research Products,
Berkeley, CA, USA) for specific detection of neuronal cells,
and rabbit glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at 1:1000
(Dakocytomation, Trappes, France) for specific detection
of glial cells. Appropriate fluorescence-tagged secondary
antibodies (AlexaFluor 488 and 555, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France) were used for visualization. DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining.
