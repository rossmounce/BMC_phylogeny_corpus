Background: Gene duplication is assumed to have played a crucial role in the evolution of
vertebrate organisms. Apart from a continuous mode of duplication, two or three whole genome
duplication events have been proposed during the evolution of vertebrates, one or two at the dawn
of vertebrate evolution, and an additional one in the fish lineage, not shared with land vertebrates.
Here, we have studied gene gain and loss in seven different vertebrate genomes, spanning an
evolutionary period of about 600 million years.

The sequencing of vertebrate genomes occurs at an everincreasing pace. Currently, the genome sequences, or at least
first drafts thereof, are available for more than 14 different
vertebrate species, while many more are underway. These

vertebrate genome sequences cover a phylogenetic distance
of more than 450 million years of evolution, dating back as far
as the split between fishes and land vertebrates. Unfortunately, genome sequences of cartilaginous fish such as sharks,
rays or skates, or of jawless vertebrates such as lampreys and

Conclusion: Based on phylogenetic analyses, we show that both the mode of duplication and the
functional class the duplicated genes belong to have been of major importance for the evolution of
the vertebrates. In particular, we provide evidence that massive gene duplication (probably as a
consequence of entire genome duplications) at the dawn of vertebrate evolution might have been
particularly important for the evolution of complex vertebrates.

refereed research

Results: We show that: first, the majority of duplicated genes in extant vertebrate genomes are
ancient and were created at times that coincide with proposed whole genome duplication events;
second, there exist significant differences in gene retention for different functional categories of
genes between fishes and land vertebrates; third, there seems to be a considerable bias in gene
retention of regulatory genes towards the mode of gene duplication (whole genome duplication
events compared to smaller-scale events), which is in accordance with the so-called gene balance
hypothesis; and fourth, that ancient duplicates that have survived for many hundreds of millions of
years can still be lost.

hagfish, which diverged well before that time, are not available yet.
Based on rather inaccurate indicators such as genome size
and isozyme complexity, Ohno already suggested in 1970 that
the genomes of (early) vertebrates have been shaped by two
whole genome duplications (WGDs) [1]. More than 20 years
later, important indications for two rounds (1R/2R) of largescale gene duplications in early vertebrate evolution came
from the analysis of Hox genes and Hox gene clusters [2-4].
Since then, the 2R hypothesis has been heavily debated, and
several modifications have been proposed, assuming a diversity of small and large scale gene duplication events (reviewed
in [5]). Based on quadruplicate paralogy between different
genomic segments [6-8], or a large increase in the number of
new duplicated genes at the dawn of vertebrate evolution
about 600 million years ago (MYA) [9], some have indeed
strongly argued for two rounds of genome duplications, possibly in very short succession [10,11]. Others, often analyzing
the same data but using different techniques, found only clear
evidence for one genome-doubling event [12-14]. Still others
have rejected whole genome duplications in vertebrates all
together and only accept a continuous rate of gene duplication [15,16]. Recently, additional evidence for two rounds of
whole genome duplications was presented [17], combining
data from gene families, phylogenetic trees, and genomic map
position. In particular, when examining the genomic map
position of those genes in the human genome that can be
traced back to a duplication event at the base of vertebrates, a
clear pattern of tetra-paralogy emerges, making a convincing
case for 1R/2R.
Whole genome duplication events shaping the genomes of
vertebrates have not only been proposed in the early evolution of vertebrates, but also in the stem lineage of ray-finned
(actinopterygian) fishes, after their divergence from the land
vertebrates. Again, the first strong indications for a fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) [18] came from studies
based on Hox genes and Hox clusters. Extra Hox gene clusters
discovered in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) [19], medaka
(Oryzias latipes) [20], the African cichlid (Oreochromis niloticus) [21], and the pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) [22], suggested an additional genome duplication in ray-finned fishes
(Actinopterygii) before the divergence of most teleost species.
Comparative genomic studies have also revealed many more
genes and gene clusters for which two copies exist in teleost
fishes but only one cognate copy in other vertebrates. The
observations that different paralogs are found on different
linkage groups and show synteny with other duplicated chromosomal regions [23] and that many paralogous pairs seem
to have originated at about the same time [9,24] support the
hypothesis that these genes arose through a complete genome
duplication event during the evolution of the actinopterygian
lineage. Both Vandepoele et al. [9] and Christoffels et al. [24]
identified duplicated genes in Takifugu and estimated that
3R took place about 320 to 350 MYA. The split between ray-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R43

finned fishes and land vertebrates, dated at 450 MYA, was
used as a calibration point for the dating of the gene duplication events in fishes. However, the most conclusive evidence
for a complete genome duplication in ray-finned fishes came
from the comparative analyses of the recently determined
Tetraodon genome sequence and the human genome
sequence [25]. Jaillon et al. [25] compared the chromosomal
distribution of genes of Tetraodon with those in human and
observed that many incidents of human synteny segments
were found in duplicate on two different Tetraodon chromosomes.
Apart from a continuous creation of genes [26] through
small-scale gene duplication events such as unequal crossingover or reverse transcription, vertebrate genomes have thus
most probably been shaped by two or more WGD events. As a
matter of fact, it is even very tempting to speculate that vertebrates as we know them today might not have existed if it
were not for these major duplication events [1,27,28]. Similarly, the fish-specific genome duplication might have contributed to the biological diversification of ray-finned fishes
[18], although others reject such a hypothesis [29]. Nevertheless, a recent paper by Scannell et al. [30] suggests a clear link
between genome duplication and speciation in yeasts, and
also in plants, genome-wide duplication events have been
associated with speciation and adaptive radiations [31-33].
Here, we report on gene gain and loss in seven different vertebrate genomes, namely human, mouse, rat, chicken, frog,
zebrafish and pufferfish. The aims of our study were: to determine in which part of the vertebrate tree gene duplication and
gene loss have been the most extensive; to investigate
whether there is a bias in gene loss towards the functional
class duplicated genes belong to and whether this is correlated with the mode of duplication (small-scale versus largescale); and to speculate on the importance of these events for
the evolution of vertebrates in general.

Results and discussion

The current composition of vertebrate proteomes is, to a large
extent, the result of gene duplication and gene loss events that
have occurred at different times during vertebrate evolution
[5,9,17] (see also this study). To study the consequences of
these events on vertebrate proteomes and vertebrate evolution, we delineated gene families and used these for constructing phylogenetic trees (see Materials and methods). The
delineation of gene families resulted in 9,461 families with a
Ciona or Drosophila outgroup. As expected, Ciona was more
often found as first outgroup sequence (better E-value score
in BLAST) than Drosophila (5,609 versus 3,852, respectively). We discarded 602 multi-gene families, for which no
Ciona or Drosophila outgroup sequence could be identified.

refereed research

On the basis of the 9,461 gene families, 8,165 phylogenetic
trees containing 85,426 vertebrate genes were inferred, and
speciation and duplication events were counted (59,852 and
11,167, respectively; Figure 1). The relative position of the
duplicated genes in a vertebrate tree was used to determine
timing of a duplication event. For ease of reference, the different branches in the tree, corresponding with certain periods
in vertebrate evolution, are indicated by TPx, where x is a
number between 1 and 13 (Figure 2). All trees can be consulted on our website [34]. The whole genome duplication
(WGD) events during the early evolution of vertebrates (1R/
2R) are assumed to have occurred before the divergence of
the fishes and the tetrapods (indicated by TP13) [5,9]. TP12
marks the branch on which 3R (the FSGD) has occurred [18].
It should be noted though that, although we assume that
many of the duplicates in TP13 and TP12 were created as a
result of WGD events, a considerable fraction originated

Apart from WGDs, gene duplication is a continuous process
and, as expected, duplication events were found on all
branches during vertebrate evolution. Nevertheless, there are
remarkable differences in the number of duplications in the
different branches. For instance, the number of zebrafishspecific gene duplicates seems exceptionally high, while that
for Tetraodon is rather low. Zebrafish and Tetraodon are
assumed to have diverged about 140 MYA [35], and since that
time Tetraodon has retained 363 duplicates (TP11), while
zebrafish counts almost four times as many duplicates (1,265,
TP10). When the number of retained duplicates is divided by
the time since speciation, a net average duplication rate of
9.04 duplications per million years in zebrafish is obtained,
which is the highest of all lineages in the vertebrate tree, compared to only 2.6 for Tetraodon. Mouse and rat have values
that lie in between those of zebrafish and Tetraodon (7.27 and
5.07 duplications per million years, respectively). Comparing
these net rates to net rates in other terminal branches confirms the extremely high number of retained duplicates in
zebrafish, rather than an exceptionally low rate in Tetraodon.
The lower net rate of duplicate retention after species-specific
duplications in rat (TP2) compared to mouse was already
noted before [36]. The numbers of retained duplicates for
frog and chicken are exceptionally low (0.6 in TP8, and 0.27
in TP6, respectively). It should be noted though that low
values for duplications might reflect excessive gene loss in

deposited research

Gene duplication in the vertebrate tree

As can be seen in Figure 2, the number of identified duplications at TP13 (2,972 duplications) exceeds all other values,
which indeed suggests that gene duplication has been rampant during early vertebrate evolution. A high number of
duplications is also detected in TP12 (branch of the FSGD).
Nevertheless, the number of detected duplications in the
common ancestor of the fishes (coinciding with 3R, TP12: 545
duplications) is more than five times smaller than the number
of duplications on TP13. There might be several explanations
for the large difference in the number of duplications between
TP12 and TP13. First, the FSGD was one event (reviewed in
[18]), while there is good evidence that there have been two
WGD events at the dawn of vertebrate evolution (see, for
example, [8,9,17]). Second, gene loss following the FSGD
might have been more extensive than gene loss following 1R/
2R (see below). In addition, a duplication on TP12 can only be
recognized if at least one of the two fish (Danio or Tetraodon)
has retained two copies of the same gene. Regarding the TP13
branch, there is a much greater chance to detect duplications,
simply because there are more species in our dataset to compare with. As long as two duplicated genes that arose early in
vertebrate evolution (for example, TP13) can be found in at
least one of the extant vertebrate genomes, this can be
regarded as evidence for a duplication event in the common
ancestor of the vertebrates (TP13; see Materials and
methods).

Hypothetical examples of phylogenetic trees with duplication and gene
Hypothetical examples of phylogenetic trees with duplication and gene
loss events. The phylogenetic trees were inferred from a gene family
including members of all genomes used in the current study (human, HS;
mouse, MM; rat, RN; chicken, GG; frog, XT; zebrafish, DR; Tetraodon, TN;
Ciona, CI). All nodes are assumed to be supported by >70% in bootstrap
analysis. Gene duplication can be recognized if at least two gene copies are
present for the same species. (a) The duplication event (represented by a
pink diamond) was inferred to have occurred early in vertebrate evolution
because both land vertebrates and fishes have two copies of the gene. This
is the most likely explanation, since the alternative assumption, where all
lineages have undergone separate gene duplication events, is much less
parsimonious. Subsequently, a gene loss event can be inferred for
Tetraodon, since gene2 is missing (dotted line). The general conclusion of
this hypothetical tree is thus one gene loss event of a TN duplicate that
first had been created in the common ancestor of land vertebrates and
fishes. For all other genomes, we count two retained duplicates after this
ancient duplication event. (b) This more complex phylogenetic tree
contains three duplication events (again indicated by diamonds). The
oldest duplication event (pink diamond) is dated early in vertebrate
evolution (TP13, similar to the one in (a)). HS, MM, RN and GG lost gene2,
which is interpreted as gene loss of a TP13 duplicate in the common
ancestor of these organisms (thus at TP7; Figure 2). GG also lost gene1, a
gene loss event at TP6 of a duplicate that originated at TP13. The orange
diamond indicates a duplication event in the common ancestor of the
fishes, not shared with land vertebrates (TP12), resulting in gene1 and
gene1' for both DR and TN. Finally, DR gene1 and gene1" are the result of a
species-specific duplication event in DR.

those lineages, rather than a decreased rate in gene
duplication.

Gene loss in the vertebrate tree
After a duplication event, the most likely fate of a duplicate is
gene loss or nonfunctionalization [26,32]. However, there is a
reasonable chance that both copies will be retained, after

which different scenarios can be envisioned: one of the two
duplicates might acquire a new function (neofunctionalization); the duplicates undergo so-called subfunctionalization,
in which both gene copies lose a complementary set of subfunctions and thereby divide the ancestral gene's original
functions [37], or instead of diverging in function both gene
copies remain largely redundant and provide the organism

As can be seen in Figure 3, the gene duplicates of ancient origin (TP13) contribute considerably less to the whole of the
current paranome (the full set of paralogs in a genome) of

refereed research

Similarly, fishes also seem to have lost many genes following
the FSGD. As a matter of fact, both zebrafish and Tetraodon
seem to have lost a similar amount of duplicates, although, as
stated before, zebrafish has much more recent duplicates
than Tetraodon. For instance, Figure 2 shows that both
zebrafish and Tetraodon have lost about 30% of the genes
that could still be identified as duplicated at TP13, about 15%
before the split and about 15% after the split of both fish species (pink bins in plots, Figure 2). On top of that, about 20%
of the duplicates resulting from the FSGD (or from smallscale duplication events that have occurred between 450 and
140 MYA; Figure 2) have been lost in both fish species.

We have also computed the relative contribution of gene
duplication at different times in vertebrate evolution to the
total gene or proteome content of extant vertebrates (Figure
3a). Rescaling to the fraction of retained duplicates of different origin versus the total number of retained duplicates (Figure 3b) provides a view on the relative importance of
duplication events for the composition of current vertebrate
proteomes. As can be seen in Figure 3a, the majority of duplicated genes in all vertebrate genomes have been created by
ancient duplication events early in vertebrate evolution and
coinciding with TP13 or 1R/2R (pink parts in graph of Figure
3). For fishes, the FSGD (TP12) has also contributed a considerable number of genes to their current genome content
(orange parts in graphs of Figure 3). As can be observed, and
stated above already, a majority of duplicates in zebrafish are
of more recent origin (indicated in light green, TP10), created
after the split between zebrafish and Tetraodon. Apparently,
the zebrafish genome, unlike that of Tetraodon, has not only
considerably expanded through the accumulation of (retro-)
transposable elements [45], but also through a large number
of recent duplications.

deposited research

In the current study, gene loss was determined as follows:
when a sequence was missing from a certain species or a clade
of species in a tree topology, while it was expected to be
present because of a duplication event deeper in the same
tree, this was counted as a gene loss event in the branch leading to the species or the clade (Figure 1). However, if one
accepts that one or two WGD events have occurred in the
early evolution of vertebrates (TP13), we can roughly estimate
the amount of gene loss following these events. More in particular, we can infer where in the vertebrate tree these genes
have been lost again. Since these WGDs originally duplicated
all genes, we can assume that gene families for which such a
duplication event at TP13 cannot be uncovered are characterized by an immediate gene loss of the duplicates created
through 1R/2R. In the 7,350 gene families that have a representative in fish, land vertebrates and one of the outgroup
sequences, 5,396 families were identified without a duplication on TP13, which seems to indicate massive gene loss following 1R/2R.

Strikingly, all vertebrates continue to lose duplicates that
were created at much earlier times. Figure 2 (pink bins in
plots) clearly shows that duplicates that were created during
1R/2R can still be lost after they have survived for hundreds
of millions of years of evolution. Some of those genes are lost
only after the divergence of human and rodents, or after the
divergence of mouse and rat. As a matter of fact, this is in congruence with what is predicted by age distributions of duplicated genes, which usually show an exponential or power-law
decay of genes that have been duplicated [26,32], suggesting
that, although chances become smaller, anciently duplicated
genes are still getting lost. A high gene loss of such old duplicates is observed in particular for frog, chicken, and both fish
genomes, while this is much less the case for mammals. Actually, gene loss in general is about four times higher in frog,
chicken, and fishes, compared to primates (human) and
rodents (mouse and rat). Extensive gene loss in the avian lineage has been reported before [44].

reports

with increased genetic robustness against harmful mutations
[38]. Recent studies revealed that subfunctionalization can
occur rapidly after duplication, and is often accompanied by
neofunctionalization. This has led to a new model of gene
function evolution called sub-neofunctionalization [39,40].
Shiu et al. [41] provided some evidence that positive selection
plays a more important role in the retention of gene
duplicates than subfunctionalization. A general overview of
the mechanisms of gene duplication and retention can be
found in [42,43].

In a first step, we compared the paranome of all organisms in
a pairwise manner, without considering the mode and time of
origin of the duplicates. Several functional categories with a
significantly different number of retained duplicates could be
identified. Interestingly, all of the significant differences were
observed between fishes on the one hand and land vertebrates on the other (Additional data file 1, Table S1). For
instance, genes belonging to the GOslim category 'catalytic
activity' have been retained in excess in both zebrafish and
Tetraodon compared to the land vertebrates, whereas other
categories such as 'protein modification', 'protein metabolism', 'catabolism', and 'peptidase activity' show the opposite
trend (Additional data file 1; Table S1). Significant differences
regarding gene retention for different functional categories
within the land vertebrates or within the fishes could not be
observed, suggesting that land vertebrates on the one hand
and fishes on the other show similar gene loss for the same
functional classes of genes.

fishes than to that of the land vertebrates, because of both the
FSGD and species specific duplications. Indeed, while for
land vertebrates the fraction of the paranome formed by
ancient duplicates amounts to 80% or more, this is only 50%
for zebrafish and 70% for Tetraodon. However, the total
number of ancient duplicates in fish genomes is still very similar to that of chicken and frog, and only slightly less than in
human or rodents.

Which genes have been retained or lost?
To determine whether gene families involved in different biological processes or with distinct biochemical functions show
dissimilar patterns of gene retention and gene loss, the Gene
Ontology (GO) controlled vocabulary was used [46] (see

In a second step, we investigated the effect of the time and
mode of duplication on the retention of genes belonging to
different functional categories. We already showed that the
WGDs have played a major role in contributing extra genes to
vertebrate genomes. In addition, there seems to be a considerable functional bias in gene retention following these major
events (1R/2R, TP13 and 3R, TP12). For instance, for most
vertebrates, genes belonging to GO classes such as 'protein
binding', 'signal transduction', 'transcription', 'development',
'DNA binding', 'receptor activity', 'ion transport', and 'protein
modification' show significantly higher levels of gene retention following WGD events (TP12 and TP13; Table 2) than
when such genes are being created in smaller-scale events.
Again, it should be noted that we assume that many of the
genes created at TP12 and TP13 are the result of a WGD event
(see above). On the other hand, genes belonging to other
functional classes such as 'electron transport', 'amino acid
and derivative metabolism' and 'RNA binding' seem to have
been retained in particular following small-scale duplication
events in at least four different species of the dataset (Table
2). The strong bias in gene retention for regulatory genes following large-scale gene duplication events is very much in
congruence with what has been observed in plants. There too,
genes involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction seem to have been preferentially retained following
genome duplications [32,47,48]. Even in yeast, a large
number of duplicates resulting from the WGD with functions
in transcription were observed [49]. Similarly, in both vertebrates (this study) and plants [32,33], developmental genes
are observed to be well retained following genome duplications. Furthermore, the high retention rate of transcription
factors following WGD events might be explained by the fact
that they are often active as protein complexes and probably
need to be present in stoichiometric quantities for their

The GOslim label, its category (MF, molecular function; BP, biological process) and the general description are shown. For each organism (HS,
human; MM, mouse; RN, rat; GG, chicken; XT, frog; DR, zebrafish; TN, Tetraodon), the number of species-specific duplicates was compared to the
number of duplicates from time points (TPs) coinciding with WGDs (TP12 and TP13). The time points showing a significant difference (q < 0.05) in
comparison are shown (TPx vs TPy), followed by the time point with the highest number of duplicates. The last column shows the q-value. Only
significant results that are discussed in the text are listed (others can be found in Additional data file 1; Table S2).

correct functioning. This is also supported by the retention of
genes belonging to classes such as 'protein binding' and 'protein modification' following WGDs. As a matter of fact, the
higher retention of genes belonging to these particular classes
is predicted by the 'gene balance' hypothesis, which states
that retention of genes that may have strong dosage effects,
such as transcription factors, will be selected against if they
are copied without their partners in the regulatory or protein
interaction network [50-53]. On the other hand, if the genes,
encoding products that cooperate in the same complex pathway or network, are duplicated at the same time, which is the
case in WGDs, gene dosage effects might be avoided by
retaining all genes in that particular complex or network. It
should be noted that the exceptionally high number of species-specific duplications in zebrafish outshines the number
of retained WGD duplicates in this proteome. This explains
why many genes of GOs resulting from WGDs are retained in
excess in all species except zebrafish (Table 2).
Figure 4 shows the retention of duplicates in human and
zebrafish following WGD events (assumed at TP12 and TP13)
versus small-scale duplication events for the GOSlim ontologies 'biotic stimulus, 'signal transduction', 'transcription', and
'metabolism'. As can be seen, apart from a larger number of
genes that have to do with signal transduction and
transcription factor activity, these genes are also retained at a
higher level following WGD events. Compared to these genes,
the contribution of small-scale duplication events to the
retention of genes involved in 'biotic stimulus' and 'metabolism' is much more significant, in particular for human. As a
matter of fact, duplicates involved in 'response to biotic stimulus' occur all throughout the vertebrate tree, and none of the
branches in the vertebrate tree contain exceptionally few or
many duplicates. For instance, the amount of gene loss following 1R/2R was not significantly higher or lower than
expected. This again confirms previous findings that genes
involved in secondary metabolism or response to biotic stimuli tend to be preserved regardless of the mode of duplication
because they are important adaptive traits that are heavily
selected for during evolution [32].

Conclusion

It has been shown before that gene duplication greatly contributed to the complexity of eukaryotic genomes [54,55].
Although gene and genome duplication events in vertebrates
might have been less extensive than in plants [56], in vertebrates a major part of the proteome also consists of proteins
encoded by duplicated genes. As shown previously, many of
the duplicates residing in vertebrate genomes have been created during very ancient paleopolyploidy events [5,9,17]. As
previously observed for plants [32,33,47,48], in vertebrates
there also seems to be a significant difference in gene retention between genes created in polyploidy events or in smallscale duplication events. In addition, similar to plants, and as
predicted by the 'gene-balance' hypothesis [51-53], retention
for genes encoding proteins that are active as protein
complexes and need to be present in stoichiometric quantities
for their correct functioning (for example, genes involved in
transcriptional regulation and signal transduction), is high
following (paleo)polyploidy events, while this is not the case
when such genes are being duplicated individually.
It has been suggested that polyploidy events can be associated
with important evolutionary transitions, major leaps in
development, and/or adaptive radiations of species
[1,18,28,31,33,53,57]. The high retention of many important
genes involved in transcriptional regulation, signaling, and
development after paleopolyploidy events as shown here and
in previous studies, and the fact that in particular such genes
are considered important for introducing phenotypic variation and increase in biological complexity, makes it tempting
to speculate on the importance of such large-scale duplication
events for vertebrate evolution. As far as we know, within the
animal lineage, vertebrate genomes are still the most complex, and, at least compared to invertebrates, vertebrates still
do contain considerably more genes, a majority of which is
probably created by gene and ancient genome duplications.
Whether these 'ancient' extra genes are sufficient to explain
the increased morphological complexity of vertebrates is
doubtful, but they might hold at least part of the answer.

Construction of the dataset and phylogenetic analysis
of gene families

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R43

information

The predicted protein sequences from human (release
31.35d), mouse (release 31.33g), Tetraodon nigroviridis
(release 31.1c), zebrafish (Danio rerio, release Zfish5), rat
(Rattus norvegicus, release 31.34a), chicken (Gallus gallus,
release 31.1g), and frog (Xenopus tropicalis, release 31.1a)
were retrieved from Ensembl [58]. If multiple splice variants
were reported for one gene, only the longest transcript was
used. Transposon-like genes were removed based on homology with known transposons [59].

To delineate vertebrate gene families, a similarity search was
performed (BLASTP, [60]; E-value cutoff E-10) with all proteins from the organisms listed above, plus the proteins of
Ciona intestinalis ([61], version 1) and Drosophila melanogaster (Ensembl [58], version 3), which were added as outgroup species. Because the focus of this study was to identify
genes that were duplicated during vertebrate evolution, only
vertebrate genes were used as blast query. Blast hits between
vertebrate sequences with a better score than the best score
between a vertebrate sequence and an outgroup sequence
(Drosophila or Ciona) were retained in the gene family. The
Drosophila or Ciona sequence was used to root the phylogenetic tree (see below). Redundancy between the families was

removed. Gene families without a homolog in Ciona or Drosophila were discarded from the dataset.
For all retained gene families a multiple alignment was created with T-Coffee 1.37 using default parameters [62]. Alignment columns containing gaps were removed when a gap was
present in >10% of the sequences. To reduce the chance of
including misaligned amino acids, all positions in the alignment left or right from the gap were also removed until a column in the sequence alignment was found where the residues
were conserved in all genes included in our analyses. This was
determined as follows: for every pair of residues in the column, the BLOSUM62 value was retrieved. If at least half of
the pairs had a BLOSUM62 value ≥0, the column was considered as conserved.
Neighbor joining trees (with 500 bootstrap replicates) were
constructed using PHYLIP 3.5 [63]. Families containing more
than 100 proteins were aligned with ClustalW 1.83 [64] and
were bootstrapped 100 times. Families with more than 260
genes were excluded from the dataset, because PHYLIP was
unable to build a phylogenetic tree. The neighbor-joining
trees were parsed, and phylogenetic information supported
by a bootstrap value of at least 70% was considered for further
analysis.

Functional annotation of the gene families
Gene families were functionally annotated using GO [46,65].
The GO annotation for human and mouse, as well as the
InterPro annotation for all organisms listed above was
downloaded from Ensembl. For the organisms that did not
have a GO annotation, a GO labeling was obtained based on
the InterPro annotation [66]. In a first step, the InterPro
annotation was linked to the corresponding GO annotation
with the InterPro2GO mapping ([65], version of April 2005).
Since some GO categories only contain a small fraction of
genes, in a second step all GO labels were remapped to the
GOslim ontology, a reduced version of GO ontology ([65],
generic version of August 2002). GO annotation per family
was obtained by listing the GOslim labels for all the genes of
that family. A weight, equal to the percentage of genes with
GOslim annotation within the same subcategory (molecular
function, cellular component, biological process) that carried
this label, was attached to all the GOslim labels. Only GOslim
labels with a weight greater than 30% were considered as representative for the family because it is unlikely that a GOslim
label ascribing fewer members of that family is representative
for the entire family. A lower cutoff leads to a considerable
increase in the number of GOslim labels for each family,
which means that rare GO labels would be assigned to an
entire family. A higher cutoff only decreased the number of
GOslim labels for each family slightly (Additional data file 1;
Figure S1).

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R43

Relative dating of duplication events
Phylogenetic trees were systematically analyzed for the presence of gene duplication events at different points in vertebrate evolution (see below). Duplication events were
evaluated by relative dating, thus based on the relative position of the duplicated genes compared to speciation events in
the phylogenetic tree. Gene loss following gene duplication
events was always counted as parsimonious as possible. Two
hypothetical examples that explain identification of gene loss
after duplication are given in Figure 1. For instance, a duplication event is registered at TP13 (Figure 2) if a land vertebrate and a fish gene are clustered at one side of the root and
at least one other vertebrate sequence is found on the other
side of the root. For example, the topology (((TNgene1,
HSgene1), HSgene2), CI), supported by bootstrap values
higher than 70%, is a minimal requirement for accepting a
duplication event at TP13. A tree with only mammals and
amphibians, such as (((HSgene1, XTgene1), (HSgene2,
XTgene2)), CI) does contain a duplication event, shared by
mammals and amphibians, but does not allow one to correctly identify the time point of the duplication event since it
is possible that the duplication took place at TP9 or at TP13.
To identify a duplication on TP9, we need a fish gene that
clusters outside the duplication node. All scripts to parse phylogenetic trees are available upon request.
To determine if there are any significant differences in the
total number of duplicates in the vertebrate proteomes, we
performed pairwise comparisons and used the Fisher's exact
test. This test was also used to determine whether gene retention at different time points or between different species is
biased towards particular functional categories (GOslim)
[34]. The false discovery rate method (q-value) [67] was used
to correct for multiple hypotheses testing and adjusted p values smaller than 0.05 were considered as significant.
