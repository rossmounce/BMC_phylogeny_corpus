Abstract
Microbiology is a relatively modern scientific discipline intended to objectively study
microorganisms, including pathogens and nonpathogens. However, since its birth, this science has
been negatively affected by anthropocentric convictions, including rational and irrational beliefs.
Among these, for example, is the artificial separation between environmental and medical
microbiology that weakens both disciplines. Anthropocentric microbiology also fails to properly
answer questions concerning the evolution of microbial pathogenesis. Here, I argue that an
exclusively biocentric microbiology is imperative for improving our understanding not only of the
microbial world, but also of our own species, our guts, and the world around us.

Prologue
"Despite our monumental achievements in philosophy, technology and the arts, to bacteria humans are no more than
an organic mass to be utilized for growth and reproduction."
E.V. Sokurenko, et al. 1999 Trends in Microbiology[1]

Introduction: Two irreconcilable worldviews
Scientific revolutions involve paradigm shifts in the scientific community's worldviews, and the swiftness of such
revolutions depends largely on the willingness of scientists to adopt novel ideas and perspectives. According to
the science historian and philosopher Thomas Kuhn,
"normal science" advances by the accumulation of data
and findings that fit into an existing paradigm reflecting a
particular worldview whereas scientific revolutions stem
in response to "crises" caused by anomalies in normal science that need to be resolved[2]. These revolutions,
according to Kuhn, often erupt as unaccepted ideas that
eventually lead to paradigm shifts and are initially resisted
by the community before becoming the new norms[2].

Indeed, unusual scientific ideas are often resisted by peer
reviewers, funding agencies, and journal and book editors
– the gatekeepers of "good science." There is hardly a better contemporary example than the struggle to establish
Helicobacter pylori as an etiologic agent of gastritis and peptic ulcers[3], a landmark discovery that was resisted for
year[4].
A common theme in major scientific revolutions (e.g.,
those ignited by Kopernik-Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein)
is the decentralization of our worldview from anthropocentrism outward. Take, for example, the painful and controversial change in how humankind perceived the Earth's
position in the universe. A paradigm shift from a universe
revolving around planet Earth to a universe where Earth is
one of several celestial bodies revolving around a star
among a myriad stars was very slow to establish. Likewise,
a paradigm shift in Homo sapiens' position among life
forms – from being considered a biologically privileged
species to a member of a cellular world that belongs to a
universal tree of life[5] – is still the subject of endless
debates, even in some "scientific" forums.

Surprisingly, although microbiology is a relatively modern science, it has not escaped the anthropocentrism associated with classical sciences like astronomy and physics.
Since its birth, microbiology has been associated with
human health and human interests (e.g., cheese, yogurt,
beer, wine, pickles, and lately fuel). Its very name "microbiology" reflects an anthropocentric attitude, implying
that because humans cannot see them, microbes are
smaller than normal. Needless to say, this arbitrary
nomenclature does not properly depict the biosphere.
Biology is mostly microscopic[6]; humans, other macroscopic animals, and large plants are the exception[7]. The
fact that human eyes have a limited visual range should
not prevent humans from embracing a realistic view of
nature. Nevertheless, research institutions and funding
agencies give priority to the study of microbes that interact
with human health, those that produce energy, or those
that improve the taste and yield of human food, largely
ignoring the majority of 4–6 × 1030 estimated bacterial
and archaeal cells on Earth[8].
Ten million years ago, there were no humans. One hundred million years ago, there were no mammals. Yet,
members of the major bacterial and archaeal phyla had
been thriving for thousands of millennia[9,10]. Thus, to
imagine that the raison d'être of pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria is to survive by "harming" their host is simplistic, to say the least. The alternative viewpoint, which
remains surprisingly uncommon in scientific literature
and textbooks, is that some bacteria that had been
stranded in the human body were driven to gradually
evolve and adapt to such a hostile environment[11,12].

In this Commentary, I am openly claiming that current
microbiology is contaminated with anthropocentric convictions (Table 1), many of which are irrational and negatively affect the objectivity of this science. Instead, I
suggest that an exclusively biocentric microbiology (Table
1) is imperative for a proper understanding not only of
the bacterial world, but also of the bacterial interactions
with our species and other ecosystems on our planet.

The status quo: How anthropocentrism distorts
microbiology
One prominent consequence of anthropocentrism is the
artificial separation between medical and environmental
microbiology. While the historical and practical reasons
for such separation are understandable, they do not justify
maintaining the status quo. Nowadays, the consideration
that human or mammalian ecosystems – and their microbiota – are significantly distinct from other ecosystems,
like soil, salt lakes, hot springs, or sediments, is scientifically tenuous. In my opinion, this separation has weakened both disciplines, depriving environmental
microbiology of deserved attention, funding, and technological advances, and depriving medical microbiology of
an eco-evo perspective[13,14]. Fortunately, the emerging
field of metagenomics has successfully crossed the medical-environmental barrier, and it is becoming increasingly
common to read that the mouth and gut microbiomes
[15-17], for example, are being analyzed and described
similarly to those in the soil [18] and other habitats[6].
Anthropocentrism has also had mostly negative impacts
on the fields of taxonomy and phylogeny. Every taxo-

Table 1: Some major differences between the anthropocentric and biocentric views of microbes

The anthropocentric view of microbes

The (micro-) biocentric view of microbes

Humans – being more complex, more sophisticated, and more
important than microorganisms – are the center of attention.

Humans and microorganisms are cellular, nucleic acid-based life forms
that struggle to survive and disseminate their nucleic material. They both
deserve equal attention, and so do other acellular nucleic acid-based
forms (e.g., viruses).

According to their effect on human health and lifestyle, microbes are
classified into:

Humans and microbes share many ecosystems. Their interests converge
or diverge, and their interactions include symbiosis as well as mutual
killing. To microbes, humans also represent an ecosystem that they use
as a relatively safe (?) haven and a source of nutrition. For this purpose,
microbes do whatever it takes to better survive and disseminate.

- those that are useful (e.g., generate vitamins, food, and fuel) and need
to be exploited for the common good of humankind
- those that are harmful (e.g., cause diseases or spoil food) and need to
be controlled and exterminated if necessary
- those that do not interfere with humans
The first two classes, albeit a minority among microbes, are the best
studied and are preferred by funding agencies.
Because humans' energy and resources are limited, anthropocentric
microbiology focuses on microbes of interest to humans.

Biocentric microbiology implies that the thorough study of all bacteria,
archaea, and other eukaryotic microbes (or representatives thereof) is
imperative for the understanding of every single microbe, including
those of direct interest to humans.

nomic group to which Homo sapiens belongs has been historically inflated at the expense of other taxonomic
groups, which have been collapsed together or totally
ignored. It is not surprising then that the current tree of
life has only been formulated about 30 years ago when the
domain Archaea was established[19], and it is possible
that novel major branches or even domains of life are still
to be discovered[20]. Human-centered tendencies can be
found in all early classification systems from those dividing living organisms into humans, animals, and plants to
those dividing them into three or five kingdoms. Even the
currently popular distinction between eukaryotes and everything else (i.e., prokaryotes) is criticized [21] and
debated[22,23]. If you think about it, it is somehow arrogant to consider cells with additional membranes around
their nucleic acids as truly (Greek. eu) nucleated, while
those that have different membrane organization as primitive. This distinction is clearly an artifact of how humans
drew analogy between fruit kernels and cell components
that they called the nuclei. In the 21st century, as we
understand the differences between fruits and cells, the
definition of a prokaryote is evolving[24].
Another sign of anthropocentrism's influence on microbiology is the distorted view of microbial pathogenesis, a
view that artificially separates pathogenesis from other
forms of adaptation[25,26]. A pathogenic bacterial lifestyle, bacteriocentrically speaking, should not be regarded
as different from the behavior of a colony of Homo sapiens
camping in a forest, exploiting some of the forest's
resources, and leaving wastes that cause damage to that
habitat. In fact, the current state of the global environment qualifies humans as the major pathogens of planet
Earth. Just as an example among many, humans were
recently described as co-pathogens of coral reefs[27].
In an anthropocentric world, the microbial virulence strategies include mechanisms dubbed immune evasion, invasion, and toxigenesis. In a biocentric world, much closer
to reality, the same strategies can be considered as defense,
nutrition seeking, and excretion mechanisms, respectively[28]. Who attacks whom, that is the question!
Indeed, the fact that we, humans, have more bacterial cells
than our own cells has prompted the rhetorical question,
"who parasitizes whom?" [29]. An anthropocentric question such as "why do bacteria produce immunogenic molecules that alert the host to their presence, and then invest
much energy to regulate and diversify these molecules to
escape the host's immunity?" makes little sense. A bacteriocentric reciprocal question would be "why does the
human host keep producing molecules that bind and
deactivate the colonization factors that are essential to our
(i.e., the bacterial) survival?" Obviously both questions
are equally subjective, but role reversal may help humans
realize their own subjectivity in dealing with microorganisms.

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/16

Another question that anthropocentrism cannot answer is
why bacteria like staphylococci and clostridia secrete toxins in food items that would poison humans who ingest
them without offering the bacterial cells any survival
advantage in those humans. This and similar questions
about the origin of toxigenesis can only be answered in an
eco-evo context, according to which these toxins may be
viewed as metabolic waste products that need to be
excreted, as preemptive competition factors against other
bacteria (e.g., bacteriocins and lantibiotics), or as antipredation defense mechanisms against protists[10].
By thinking outside the anthropocentric box, microbiologists answered a similarly puzzling question concerning
the pathogenesis of the legionellae. These bacteria have
not infected humans until the 20th century, with the widespread use of showers and air conditioners[28]. They have
certainly not been evolving for millions of years "in anticipation" to adapt to human macrophages. Instead, the
pathogenesis of these aquatic bacteria could be explained
as an adaptation to the macrophage-like protozoan predators, in whose vacuoles they evolved intracellular survival strategies[30].
One final example of anomalies arising from the anthropocentric contamination of our microbiology relates to
the nomenclature of microbial proteins. For example, a
bacterial protein was named Mac because of its similarity
to a human macrophage receptor [31] and a bacterial
genetic locus was called the locus of enterocyte effacement
because it encodes gene products involved in damaging
intestinal cells[32]. These names, and many more, may be
accurately describing phenotypes associated with the
expression of these proteins; however, they complicate the
current efforts for automated genome annotations [33]
because they fail to explain the functions of homologs of
these proteins in organisms that never had a human
encounter. Instead, annotations that are more biologically
relevant should use controlled vocabulary related to the
biochemical or structural properties of these proteins.
Thinking like a microbe
Attempts, in print and online, have been made to "think
like a microbe" or describe the microbial world from a
microbial perspective. For example, in A Field Guide to
Bacteria, Betsey Dexter Dyer defends bacteriocentricity and
tries to put herself "in the place of bacteria and observe the
world as they observe it" [7]! To describe how this approach
was taken too far, she tells the story of a friend who asked
her advice on dealing with food poisoning. She writes, "I
found that I was unable to properly sympathize with him
(the human host) but instead came down quite strongly on
the side of his intestinal bacteria, which, after all, were
experiencing an invasion and were being dislodged from
their habitat and deprived of their usual nutrients."
(Ref[7], pages 6–7)

Another book that is even more bacteriocentric (The Other
End of the Microscope: the Bacteria Tell Their Own
Story[34]) describes a gathering, in which bacteria portray
themselves more objectively, express their discontent with
how they are named by humans, and finally suggest new
names for the species Homo sapiens.
In the science blogosphere, addressing a mixed audience of
scientists, scholars, students, and innocent bystanders, there
are also attempts where the authors "impersonate"
microbes, and let bacteria and viruses present themselves to
the world (e.g., Adopt A Microbe, http://adoptami
crobe.blogspot.com).

Paradigm shift: How biocentrism can improve
microbiology
Biocentric microbiology helps us better understand
microbial pathogenesis. Classifying microbes into friends
and foes, useful and harmful, often diverts us from recognizing the main goal of every microbe, which is no different from the main goal of every other organism: survival
[28]. Host-associated microbes, including gut pathogens
– the focus of this journal, would do whatever it takes for
niche adaptation, defense against the immune system,
and maximal dissemination. If some of their excreted/
secreted proteins or metabolic byproducts represent a
"conflict of interest" with human's multicellular tissues
and organs, and if this conflict of interest offers the bacteria selective advantage over competing life forms around
them (including human cells, other bacteria, or even
peers) they will retain these proteins and use them, thus
adopting what we call a pathogenic lifestyle. If their
defense strategies necessitate hijacking human cells to
hide in them and exploit their nutritious resources, again
these "anti-human" traits will be selected, propagated,
and possibly shared with other species via horizontal gene
transfer. If, on the other hand, their survival necessitates
killing or feeding on their parent, sibling, or daughter
cells, they will resort to cannibalism and fratricide[35].
Before you call the latter mechanisms cruel or abhorrent,
think about human cells that continuously commit fratricide and suicide during the processes of growth, neoplasia, and immune surveillance[36].
Biocentric microbiology will particularly benefit microbial genomics, phylogenomics, and-consequently – evolutionary biology. The focus on sequencing genomes of
few bacterial phyla that interest Homo sapiens has led to a
skewed representation of the tree of life [37,38] and a distorted view of the microbial world. Filling the gaps in the
tree of life by sequencing genomes of more diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa will reveal many missing links and
will fine-tune our understanding of metabolic networks.
Metagenomic analysis will particularly benefit from a
fairly represented tree of life. Currently, large fractions of

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/16

sequenced metagenomes lack homologs in known databases and are thus uninformative[39]. With genome
sequences from more diverse life forms, the informative
sequences in each metagenomes are expected to multiply[40,41].
I also argue that biocentric microbiology will advance
fields related to human health, including diagnostics,
immunoprophylaxis, and therapeutics. The classical
example of how diagnostics have benefited from environmental microbiology is the development of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based microbial identification
tools. PCR is now essential in identifying and quantifying
many human pathogens, and is sometimes the only reliable diagnostic method. This technology owes its speed
and reliability to a bacterium that is totally out of anthropocentric microbiology's scope of interest: Thermus aquaticus.
In antimicrobial chemotherapy, the paradigm is shifting
from screening different natural and synthetic products
for drug candidates to screening microbial genomes and
proteomes for drug targets that are essential and specific to
bacteria. The conceptual shift here is from focusing on a
tool to "kill the bad bugs" to a gene-product or a molecule
without which the bacterial cell cannot survive. The same
can be said about reverse vaccinology, the successful strategy that has revolutionized immunoprophylaxis. This
strategy starts with the bacterial genome (bacteriocentric)
to predict candidate immunogenic proteins rather than
screening the sera humans or animals for antibodies
against different bacterial proteins (usually those that can
be purified from cultured bacteria) [42].

Conclusion
At the end of this Commentary, having made the case for
biocentric microbiology, I emphasize that I am not calling
for self-hating ecocentric extremism. Human health is
undoubtedly precious, and humans have every right to
fight infectious diseases that kill and debilitate hundreds
of million members of their species. However, when it
comes to retaining the objectivity of science, a fundamental pillar of the scientific method, the boundaries between
the disciplines of infectious diseases and microbiology
should be made and kept clear. Microbiology should
remain faithful to the study of its main subject: microbes.
In doing so, it should equally focus on all microbes
regardless of their interaction with humans.
