Abstract
Background: A growing amount of scientific evidence suggests that microbes are involved in the
aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota of individuals
suffering from diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is distinguishable from other IBS-subtypes. In our
study, the GI microbiota of IBS-D patients was evaluated and compared with healthy controls (HC)
by using a high-resolution sequencing method. The method allowed microbial community analysis
on all levels of microbial genomic guanine plus cytosine (G+C) content, including high G+C
bacteria.
Methods: The collective faecal microbiota composition of ten IBS-D patients was analysed by
examining sequences obtained using percent G+C (%G+C) -based profiling and fractioning
combined with 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing of 3267 clones. The IBS-D library was
compared with an analogous healthy-control library of 23 subjects. Real-time PCR analysis was
used to identify phylotypes belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria and the order
Coriobacteriales.
Results: Significant differences were found between clone libraries of IBS-D patients and controls.
The microbial communities of IBS-D patients were enriched in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but
reduced in the number of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes compared to control. In particular, 16S
rDNA sequences belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae within the phylum Firmicutes were in
greater abundance in the IBS-D clone library.
Conclusions: In the microbiota of IBS-D sufferers, notable differences were detected among the
prominent bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria) localized
within the GI tract.

Background
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract diagnosed in 1020% of the adult and adolescent populations, is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, distorted bowel
habits and altered stool characteristics [1]. Although IBS
does not predispose to severe ill health, it diminishes the
patients' quality of life and has an economic impact on
society via work absenteeism and medical leave [2].
Because of the differing symptoms experienced by IBSdiagnosed individuals, sufferers have been divided into
four subtypes, i.e. constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C),
diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed-type IBS (IBSM) and unsubtyped IBS [1]. The aetiology of IBS is currently unknown, although genetic, environmental, psychosocial or physiological factors are likely to contribute
to the disorder [3,4]. Intestinal bacteria may also play a
role in the onset and maintenance of IBS given that previous studies have indicated disparities in the microbiota
between IBS-D sufferers and healthy individuals or, to
lesser extent, those individuals diagnosed with the other
IBS subtypes [5,6]. Consequently, a detailed analysis of
the IBS-D associated GI microbiota present is justified.
Several studies have strengthened the argument for a role
of intestinal microbes in the causation of IBS. Acute bacterial gastroenteritis often leads to lingering gastrointestinal complaints in individuals, one-third of whom develop
IBS [7]. Moreover, elevated levels of serum antibodies specific for bacterial flagellins, the dominant antigens associated with Crohn's disease (CD) [8], have been detected in
post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) sufferers [9]. Evidence for a
low level of mucosal inflammation within the GI tract has
also emerged for all subtypes of IBS [10,11]. Reports have
indicated an increased level of serine protease activity,
possibly originating from bacteria [12], in faecal samples
recovered from IBS-D sufferers. Although not correlated
with bowel movements or present in individuals with
acute infectious diarrhoea [13], serine protease activity in
mice is associated with increased mucosal colonic permeability and heightened visceral hypersensitivity [12],
symptoms that also occur in humans with IBS-D [14,15].
In our study, the combined 16S rRNA gene composition
from the faeces of ten individuals with IBS-D, in agreement with the Rome II criteria, was analysed by %G+C
profiling and fractioned DNA sequencing, compared with
a similarly produced sequence library of 23 healthy individuals [16] and then examined for selected phylotypes
using real-time PCR. We observed significant difference
between the clone libraries constructed from the IBS-D
sufferers and healthy controls samples in the abundance
of the four major phyla of bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) found in the GI tract.
To the best of our knowledge, these sequencing data rep-

resent the first comprehensive study to sufficiently
describe the GI microbiota associated with IBS-D.

Methods
Study subjects
Faecal samples used for %G+C fractioning and cloning
were collected from ten donors (six females, four males),
with an average age of 46.5 years that suffered from IBS
according to the established Rome II criteria [17]. Realtime PCR assays were performed for two additional individuals diagnosed with IBS-D (one female and one male
aged 30 and 27 years, respectively) and for 22 healthy
control (HC) individuals that had been used for the construction of the unfractioned DNA sample previously by
Krogius-Kurikka et al. [16]. IBS-D subjects were excluded
from the study if they were pregnant, lactating or unable
to cooperate, had consumed antibiotics during the past
two months, had undergone major or complicated
abdominal surgery, were suffering from organic GI disease, severe systematic disease or endometriosis, or had
been diagnosed with senile dementia. Healthy individuals
with lactose intolerance, celiac disease and regular GI tract
symptoms were not used as controls. All participating IBSD individuals had undergone clinical and endoscopic GI
examinations or had had a barium enema within a year
prior to starting the study. Lactose-intolerant IBS-D individuals consuming low-lactose or lactose-free diets as well
as individuals medicated for IBS were allowed to participate. All test subjects have been studied previously for a
comparison of the GI microbiota between IBS-related and
healthy individuals [18-21], and represented the placebo
group of a probiotic intervention study [22]. The IBS-D
faecal samples were recovered prior to onset of the intervention period and approximately two weeks to 12
months after the clinical GI examination, and the intestinal microbiota contained therein was considered typical
of IBS-D sufferers.
Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the human ethics
committee at the joint authority for the District Hospital
of Helsinki and the Uusimaa (HUS) region. All participants provided written informed consent and were
allowed to withdraw from the study at any point.
Sequencing of the %G+C profiled sample
To avoid methodological distortions and to enable comparison of IBS-D subjects' microbiota with that of healthy
controls', the faecal samples from IBS-D subjects were
exposed to the same processes as described in detail by
Krogius-Kurikka et al. [16]. In brief, the procedure
included bacterial genomic DNA isolation with the
method described by Apajalahti et al. [23], followed by
%G+C profiling and fractioning of an equal amount of
pooled DNA samples according to their %G+C -content
using 5%G+C intervals [24] (Additional file 1). The 16S
Page 2 of 11

BMC Gastroenterology 2009, 9:95

rRNA was amplified from each of the %G+C fractions 3035, 35-40, 45-50, 50-55, 60-65, 65-70 and 70-75 separately, with a low number of PCR cycles using two primer
pairs with a broad bacterial range [25,26]. The amplicons
were pooled and clone libraries were constructed separately for each fraction with the QIAGEN® PCR Cloning
plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The sequencing of
the 3' end of the 16S rRNA gene clones was performed
with the primer pD' [27]. For templates that were hard to
sequence, 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide was used in the
sequencing reaction. These templates were mainly representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria.
Sequence analysis
Sequences were checked manually and the primer
sequences were removed with the Staden Package pregap4
version 1.5 and gap version 4.10 assembly programs [28].
Sequences present in more than one clone library were
considered to be non-chimeric. Potential chimeras were
also searched by manually browsing the ClustalW 1.83
sequence alignment [29] with Bio Edit version 7.0.5.3
[30]. The sequences from %G+C fractions 25-30, 40-45
and 55-60 (AM276372 to AM277303 [21], comprising
one-third of the total sample DNA, were included in any
further analyses to encompass the whole sample.
Determination of operational taxonomic units and
diversity measurements
MAFFT 6.603b [31] available at the CSC-IT Center for Science (Espoo, Finland) was used for 16S rRNA gene
sequence alignments. The MAFFT FFT-NS-2 alignment
option was used to align the 16S rRNA gene clone
sequences of the IBS-D and healthy control (HC) libraries
separately and together. The sequences were cut from the
Escherichia coli position 430 (totally conserved GTAAA),
resulting in an alignment including the 16S rRNA variable
regions V1 and V2. The alignments were visually
inspected, but they were not edited manually to avoid
subjectivity and to maintain reproducibility of the alignments. Distance matrices were created from the cut alignments with Phylip 3.66 Dnadist [32] using the F84
evolution model. The sequences were assigned into phylotypes (operational taxonomic units, OTUs) with
DOTUR [33] by applying the furthest neighbor rule in
which all sequences within an OTU fulfil the similarity
criterion. The 98% cut-off for sequence similarity was
used to delimit an OTU. The OTU representatives determined separately for IBS-D and HC libraries were used in
the RDP library compare [34] and UniFrac [35] analyses.
Common OTU representatives were used in the SONS
analysis [36] and in constructing a phylogenetic tree of the
family Lachnospiraceae. From each OTU with less than
95% similarity to any EMBL nucleotide sequence database
entry a representative clone was sequenced to near fulllength as described by Krogius-Kurikka et al. [16], but the
sequence analyses were preformed with the 16S rRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/9/95

region covering approximately 450 bp from the 5'-end of
the 16S rRNA gene.
The indices for diversity and richness estimates were calculated using DOTUR [33]. Simpson's 1/D and Shannon's
indices take into account the number of species present
and the abundance of each species, with the value of the
indices increasing with greater diversity [37,38]. The Chao
estimator for richness [39] considers singletons and doubletons as rare species and the ACE richness estimator
considers OTUs represented with less than ten sequences
as rare species [40]. Coverage of the clone libraries was
calculated with the formula of Good [41], which takes
into account the number of singletons in the clone library.
The Fasta EMBL Environmental and EMBL Prokaryote
database searches [42] and the Ribosomal Database
Project II (RDP II) Classifier Tool [43] were used to affiliate the phylotypes.
Comparison of IBS-D and HC libraries
The 16S rRNA gene clone libraries of the IBS-D patients
and healthy controls [16] were compared using SONS
[36], RDP library compare [34] and UniFrac [35]. SONS
calculates the observed fraction of sequences in shared
OTUs in each library and the observed fraction of shared
OTUs in each library. A distance matrix calculated based
on the common MAFFT alignment of IBS-D and HC
sequences, as described above in the Determination of operational taxonomic units and diversity measurements -section,
was used in the SONS analysis. The RDP library compare
online analysis tool was used to make microbial community comparisons and the UniFrac program was applied to
compare the microbial communities in a phylogenetic
context. In both analyses, a comparison between IBS-D
and HC libraries was performed for separately determined
OTUs, as described in the section Determination of operational taxonomic units and diversity measurements. The RDP
analysis was also performed at the sequence level.

In constructing a phylogenetic tree for the UniFrac analysis, a representative sequence of each OTU was aligned
with MAFFT [31] using the E-INS-i alignment algorithm.
Thereafter, 16S rRNA reference sequences from the European ribosomal RNA database [44] (Additional file 2)
were selected and similarly aligned. The MAFFT-profile
alignment option was used for constructing a combined
profile alignment from the above mentioned alignments.
The alignment was cut from E. coli position 430 (totally
conserved GTAAA) and reference sequences, except for
Methanobrevibacter smithii, were then deleted from the
alignment with BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [30]. A F84-corrected distance matrix was created using Phylip 3.66
dnadist [32]. The OTU representatives in the tree were
labelled with taxonomic information from the Ribosomal
Database Project II Classifier Tool [43] to identify the
sequence affiliations. UniFrac Significance using abunPage 3 of 11

dance weights and P Test Significance analyses were used
to describe whether the communities were significantly
different overall. Lineage-Specific Analysis was used to test
whether significant differences were present between the
libraries within separate lineages at a specified distance
from the root.
Phylogenetic tree of the family Lachnospiraceae
A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the common OTU
representatives from the IBS-D and HC libraries, with over
50% confidence threshold to the family Lachnospiraceae
(Firmicutes) according to the RDP Classifier [43] (Additional file 3). The sequences were aligned with the reference sequences representing the Clostridium rRNA XIV
group [45] and selected additional reference sequences
(Additional files 2 and 3). An MAFFT profile alignment
and an F84 distance matrix were constructed as for the
UniFrac analysis in the Comparison of IBS-D and HC libraries -section, with the exception that sequences from the
European ribosomal RNA database representing Clostridium rRNA Cluster XIV and Clostridium leptum AF262239
were used as references. Bootstrapping the data with one
hundred replicates and construction of the tree were performed with the Seqboot and Consense programs of
Phylip 3.66 [32]. A phylogenetic tree was generated with
a neighbor-joining algorithm from the distance matrix
using Phylip 3.66 neighbor [32]. The tree was visualized
with MEGA4 [46].
Real-time PCR assays
The real-time PCR assays for Enterobacteriaceae and Eggerthella lenta -like phylotypes were developed since the common OTUs for HC and IBS-D, presenting these
phylotypes, were notably more abundant in sequences
from the IBS-D library (Figure 1) and the genera were significantly more abundant in the IBS-D library according
to the RDP library compare tool (Additional file 4). The
primers and assays were designed as described in Lyra et
al. [5]. The forward and reverse primers and positive control clones for real-time PCR assays were 5'-CATAACGTCGCAAGACCAAAGA-3',
5'GAGTCTGGACCGTGTCTCAGTTC-3' and AM276420 for
the first and 5'-GTGACCAACCTGCCCCTTG-3', 5'-GACCCCATCCCTTGCCGT-3' and AM276078 for the latter.
The clones AM275716 and AM693283 were used as negative controls for the assays targeting Enterobacteriaceae and
Eggerthella lenta -like phylotypes, respectively. The negative controls were highly similar in sequence with the positive target clones, but included mismatches within the
primer annealing sites.

The analyses were performed using the iCycler iQ RealTime Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
associated with the iCycler Optical System Interface software (version 2.3; Bio-Rad). The 12 IBS-D and 22 HC
patients' individual faecal DNA samples were run as trip-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/9/95

licates using the following optimized reaction conditions:
25 ng of faecal DNA, 1:75 000 dilution of SYBR Green I
(Lonza Biosciences, Basel, Switzerland), 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.8), 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM and 3
mM of MgCl2 for Enterobacteriaceae and E. lenta (respectively), 100 μM each dNTP, 0.5 μM each primer, 0.024 U
Dynazyme II polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland)
and 5 μl of either template or water. Standards ranging
from 102 to 107 16S rRNA gene copies, amplified from the
positive controls, were applied. After an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min the real-time PCR amplification
proceeded with 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20
s, primer annealing at 64°C for Enterobacteriaceae and at
68°C for E. lenta for 20 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s and
a fluorescence detection step at 85°C for 30 s. A melt
curve analysis was preformed after amplification by slow
cooling from 95°C to 60°C, with fluorescence collection
at 0.3°C intervals and a hold of 10 s at each decrement to
check the specificity of the real-time PCR assay. The raw
data were transformed to log10 ratios of the number of 16S
rRNA gene copies in one gram of faeces. The R software
environment for statistical computing and graphics [47]
was used for performing non-parametric Mann-Whitney
U-tests.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The 16S rRNA gene sequences reported in this study were
deposited in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
under accession numbers AM691850 to AM694184.

Results
Library characteristics
Approximately 300 sequences were recovered from each
%G+C fraction of the IBS-D patients' (n = 10) pooled
sample, resulting in a total of 3267 sequences. The IBS-D
clone library constructions and sequencing were performed similarly to those of the healthy controls (n = 23)
that comprised of 3199 sequences [16] with the exception
of amount of subjects pooled to construct the sample
(Table 1). According to Good's formula [41], the coverage
of clone libraries was above 95%. Less phylotypes were
present in the IBS-D library (n = 302) than in the HC
library (n = 428), with a 98% cut-off level for OTUs [16]
(Table 1). The Shannon and Simpson indices for diversity
and Chao and ACE richness estimates were lower for the
IBS-D library. The rank abundance curves of the libraries
showed highly similar OTU evenness (Figure 2).
Microbial community comparisons
The microbial community comparison at the phylum
level using RDP classifier revealed that the IBS-D library
had significantly more representatives of Proteobacteria
and Firmicutes than the HC library, whereas the condition
was the opposite with Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Figure 3). When the comparison was made with OTUs, the
IBS-D library was significantly richer in Firmicutes than the

Distribution of sequences and OTUs among IBS-D and HC clone libraries
Distribution of sequences and OTUs among IBS-D and HC clone libraries. The unique sequences or OTUs (cut-offlevel of 98%) in the IBS-D and HC libraries are indicated in red and blue, respectively. The grey area in the group-wise bars is a
mirror-image of shared sequences or OTUs and it is presented on both sides of the y-axis. The number of singleton OTUs is
given in parentheses. The roman numerals XIV and IV within the Firmicutes indicate the corresponding Clostridium rRNA clusters, 1) Other Firmicutes, 2) Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, TM7 and Verrucomicrobia.
HC library (Figure 3). In the UniFrac Lineage-Specific
Analysis, the phylum Actinobacteria differed significantly
(p = 0.0013), and the phylum Bacteroidetes, the Firmicutes
families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaeae and the Proteobacteria classes Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria differed highly significantly (p < 0.001) between
the IBS-D and HC libraries. Overall, however, the libraries
did not differ significantly.
A substantial proportion of sequences were members of
the family Lachnospiraceae in both libraries; 45% and 33%
in the IBS-D and HC libraries, respectively (Additional file
3). The Lachnospiraceae diverged significantly between
IBS-D and HC according to the RDP library compare
sequence and OTU-based analyses (Additional file 4).
Among significantly differing groups of Actinobacteria,
Eggerthella was the only genus more abundant in the IBSD library than in the HC library (Additional file 4). The

IBS-D library contained significantly less Bacteroidetes
sequences than the HC library (29 vs. 96) in both the RDP
library compare and UniFrac analyses. Presence of GI
pathogens was not demonstrated by sequencing.
The combined sequence pool from both community samples comprised 578 OTUs, 30.4% of which were shared
(Figure 4). The IBS-D library had only half the number of
unique OTUs found in the HC library. The majority of the
sequences were, however, shared (81.0%), and the proportions of unique sequences in both libraries were similar. The proportion of shared OTUs in the IBS-D library
was greater than in the HC library at all OTU cut-off levels,
with the highest difference being observed at the (cut-off)
level of 90% (Figure 5). The HC library harboured more
unique sequences and OTUs than the IBS-D library, with
a few exceptions; the portion of unique sequences in the
classes Bacilli and Proteobacteria, and the portion of

Real-time PCR analysis
The average PCR efficiencies were 89% for the Enterobacteriaceae and 96% for E. lenta -like real-time PCR assays. The
differences between the IBS-D and HC libraries were not
significant according to the Mann-Whitney U-tests (Figure
6). The result remained similar when the amounts of
detected phylotypes were proportioned to the total
amount of bacteria; Mann-Whitney U-test p-values 0.15
and 0.63 for Enterobacteriaceae and Eggerthella lenta -like
phylotypes, respectively (data not shown). According to
the dry weights, the moisture content of the samples did
not affect the real-time PCR results (data not shown).

Discussion
To determine whether diarrhoea-predominant IBS is
linked to particular changes in the GI microbiota, 16S
rRNA gene sequence data constructed from pooled faecal
DNA samples of ten IBS patients with diarrhoea were
compared with the similarly constructed data of 23
healthy controls [16]. The %G+C fractioning enhances the

within the libraries. However, the method allowed thor-

Lower number of OTUs in the IBS-D library
The lower diversity and number of OTUs in the IBS-D
library is probably mostly due to the smaller number of
subjects used to construct the library. On the other hand,
a decreased diversity in the GI microbiota of IBS-D
patients compared with healthy individuals may exist, as
has been observed with CD patients [48]. Acute diarrhoea
has been shown to reduce the overall microbiota composition, which could simply be caused by washing out of
the commensal bacteria [49]. At the approximate family/
genus level (90% OTU cut-off), the number of shared
OTUs was above 85% in the IBS-D library compared with
50% in the HC library. Thus the lower diversity of IBS-D
patients' GI microbiota seems more apparent at a higher
taxonomic level, possibly indicating dysbiosis. A likely
cause for these observations is the subject number difference in the pooled samples. On the other hand, the Simpson diversity indexes were very similar below
approximately 90% OTU cut-off levels, suggesting little
difference between the two libraries (data not shown).
However, comparative analysis at higher taxonomic level
is likely to be less affected by individuality and thus less
prone to such bias.

and colleagues [51] isolated a bacterium (A4) with a
highly similar flagellin (A4-Fla2) to Fla-X, which has been
shown to be an important antigen in CD [8]. The A4 bacterium was classified as a member of the family Lachnospiraceae and the Clostridium cluster XIVa. Interestingly,
elevated antibody concentrations towards the flagellins
A4-Fla2 and Fla-X have also been associated with IBS,
especially with the PI-IBS subgroup of patients [9], which
is most often diarrhoea-predominant [52]. In our study,
the family Lachnospiraceae was significantly more abundant in the IBS-D library than in the HC library. A large
part of the sequences and OTUs in IBS-D (45% and 41%)
and HC (33% and 30%) libraries are affiliated with the
family Lachnospiraceae, including the largest OTU in the
IBS-D (n = 395) and HC (n = 160) libraries, which is affiliated with Eubacterium rectale, a prevalent member of this
family in the gut. Contradictory results on the abundance

Rajilić-Stojanović et al. [6] observed a significantly lower
level of Bacteroides spp. in IBS patients than in healthy
controls, but at the Bacteroidetes phylum level no difference was detected between the groups. In this study, the
number of Bacteroidetes phylum sequences was lower in
the IBS-D library. However, the number of sequences
assigned to this phylum was overall low, and thus, extra
caution should be employed in interpreting the data. The
group Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas has previously
been quantified from the faeces of healthy controls and
IBS patients, with no significant difference between the
groups [18]. The maximum four hour delay due to transportation from the study subjects to the laboratory in the
freezing of the samples in -70°C may have lowered the
proportion of Bacteroides detected (Salonen et al., personal
communications). All samples were, however, stored and
processed in the same manner to minimize any technical
bias into the comparative analysis.
Real-time PCR quantification compared with community
comparison
The sequencing results were in accordance with the earlier
real-time PCR quantification of a Collinsella aerofaciens like phylotype [21], Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus
spp. [18], all being less abundant in the IBS-D library than
in the HC library. Several OTUs comprising at least 100
sequences were not commonly found in the IBS-D library.
These OTUs were affiliated with Bifidobacterium longum
(Bifidobacteriaceae), Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum
(Bifidobacteriaceae), Eggerthella lenta (Coriobacteriaceae), a
phylotype with 93% similarity to E. lenta (Coriobacte-

riaceae), Enterobacter ludwigii (Gammaproteobacteria) and
Streptococcus bovis (Bacillus). However, real-time PCR
assays performed on individual samples for targeting
these OTUs, e.g. B. longum [18], a B. catenulatum/B. pseudocatenulatum-like phylotype [21] and a S. bovis-like phylotype [21], have not revealed significant differences
between IBS subjects and healthy controls. Additionally,
phylotypes affiliating with Lachnospiraceae resembling
Ruminococcus torques with less than 95% 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity have been detected with an association to either IBS-D or healthy depending on the phylotype [5]. Caution should be taken when comparing the
real-time PCR results and the sequencing data since the
targets of the real-time PCR assays and the taxonomic
grouping of the sequence data may not be congruent.
In this study, an Eggerthella lenta -like phylotype and an
Enterobacteriaceae phylotype were quantified with realtime PCR. The median of the 16S rRNA gene quantities for
the E. lenta -like phylotype was lower for IBS- than for HC
(Figure 6), similarly as previously reported for the
Atopobíum group, which contains the E. lenta -like pylotype [18]. However, these differences were not significant.
A minor tendency for Enterobacteriaceae to be more abundant among IBS-D patients than controls was detected.
Consistent with this, elevated number of Enterobacteria
have previously been detected among CD patients [53].
Evidence of higher quantities of aerobic bacteria in the
clone library of IBS-D subjects was seen among Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli. An elevated aerobe:anaerobe
ratio [19] and higher amounts of Enterobacteriaceae [54]
have earlier been detected in association with IBS using
culture-based techniques. Furthermore, in association
with acute diarrhoea, increases in the number of enteric
(aerobic) bacteria have been reported [49,55], while
anaerobic bacterial counts have decreased [56].

Conclusions
Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach applied
here, the faecal sample of IBS-D patients showed indications of a dysbiotic microbiota, even though the overall
structure was similar to that of healthy controls. Notable
differences between IBS-D and controls were identified in
all dominant bacterial phyla of the GI microbiota; Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Differences on such a high taxonomic level are not as prone to
biases in sequence library comparisons as lower level
comparisons. Within Firmicutes, the family Lachnospiraceae was significantly increased in the IBS-D group
regarding the number of sequences and OTUs. In future
research, the role of this family in IBS-D should receive
more attention.
