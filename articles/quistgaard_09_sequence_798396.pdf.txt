Abstract
Background: The Asp-box is a short sequence and structure motif that folds as a well-defined βhairpin. It is present in different folds, but occurs most prominently as repeats in β-propellers. Aspbox β-propellers are known to be characteristically irregular and to occur in many medically
important proteins, most of which are glycosidase enzymes, but they are otherwise not well
characterized and are only rarely treated as a distinct β-propeller family. We have analyzed the
sequence, structure, function and occurrence of the Asp-box and s-Asp-box -a related shorter
variant, and provide a comprehensive classification and computational analysis of the Asp-box βpropeller family.
Results: We find that all conserved residues of the Asp-box support its structure, whereas the
residues in variable positions are generally used for other purposes. The Asp-box clearly has a
structural role in β-propellers and is highly unlikely to be involved in ligand binding. Sequence
analysis of the Asp-box β-propeller family reveals it to be very widespread especially in bacteria and
suggests a wide functional range. Disregarding the Asp-boxes, sequence conservation of the
propeller blades is very low, but a distinct pattern of residues with specific properties have been
identified. Interestingly, Asp-boxes are occasionally found very close to other propeller-associated
repeats in extensive mixed-motif stretches, which strongly suggests the existence of a novel class
of hybrid β-propellers. Structural analysis reveals that the top and bottom faces of Asp-box βpropellers have striking and consistently different loop properties; the bottom is structurally
conserved whereas the top shows great structural variation. Interestingly, only the top face is used
for functional purposes in known structures. A structural analysis of the 10-bladed β-propeller fold,
which has so far only been observed in the Asp-box family, reveals that the inner strands of the
blades are unusually far apart, which explains the surprisingly large diameter of the central tunnel
of sortilin.
Conclusion: We have provided new insight into the structure and function of the Asp-box motif
and of Asp-box β-propellers, and expect that the classification and analysis presented here will
prove helpful in interpreting future data on Asp-box proteins in general and on Asp-box βpropellers in particular.

Background
The Asp-box is a phylogenetically ubiquitous sequence
and structure motif. It was first described as a short repeat
motif with consensus sequence S-X-D-X-G-X-T-W distinguishing bacterial from influenza sialidases or neuraminidases (the two terms are equivalent) [1]. For this reason
it is also known as the bacterial neuraminidase repeat
(BNR repeat). However, it is now clear that it is neither
limited to sialidases nor to bacteria and we therefore prefer the term Asp-box, which is also the more prevalent
term in the literature. The structure of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 sialidase [2] was the first structure to be determined of a bacterial sialidase or indeed any glycoside
hydrolase family 33 (GH33) protein; bacterial, eukaryotic
and some related viral sialidases all belong to this family.
This structure revealed that the GH33 catalytic domain
adopts a 6-bladed β-propeller fold with the Asp-boxes
spanning the loop between the two outer strands, strand
3 and 4, of the four-stranded 'up-and-down' propeller
blades [2], and that the Asp-box itself adopts a β-hairpin
fold [2,3]. Structures of GH33 sialidases, trans-sialidases
or sialidase-like proteins have since been determined
from a variety of organisms including bacteria [2,4-9],
trypanosomes [10,11], leech [12] and man [13]. Asp-box
repeats have furthermore been observed in equivalent
positions in the structures of several other β-propeller
domains including the 6-bladed β-propeller of the bacteriophage K1F sialidase (GH58 family) [3,14], the tandem
7-bladed β-propellers of GH74 hydrolases [15-17] and
the 10-bladed β-propellers of the Vps10-domain (Vps10D) receptors, which stand out from all other structurally
characterized Asp-box β-propellers by not being carbohydrate active enzymes [18,19]. The Asp-box is however not
restricted to the β-propeller fold, but also occurs in the
jelly-roll subrepeats of reelin [3,20], as singlet in the
immuno-globulin-like (Ig-like) C-terminal domains of
chitobiase (GH20 family) and sulfite oxidase and as singlet in the central 'up-and-down' β-sheet of the microbial
ribonuclease fold [3,21]. Furthermore, a shorter variant of
the Asp-box, missing the conserved glycine, has recently
been identified. This motif occurs in the arabinase/levansucrase/invertase group of 5-bladed β-propellers and in
some carbohydrate binding modules [15]. The Asp-box is
just one among several repeats that are found in specific
positions in β-propellers and defines a particular propeller family. Others include for example the WD40, kelch,
YWTD (LDL receptor class B), PQQ (tryptophan docking
motif), NHL and RCC1 repeats, which seem to generally
function in folding and/or stabilization of the propellers.
Such functions may also apply to the Asp-box [5,22], but
functions in carbohydrate binding or secretion have also
been proposed [2,3]. The Asp-box β-propeller family
stands out from other β-propeller families in at least three
ways; firstly Asp-box β-propellers are unusually irregular
[23], secondly Asp-boxes are often missing in several and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

indeed sometimes most of the blades e.g. the 6-bladed βpropeller of bacteriophage K1F sialidase has just two Aspboxes [14], and thirdly it is so far the only β-propeller
family that encompass a 10-bladed fold. The considerable
structural work carried out on Asp-box glycosidases
reflects a fundamental interest in the mechanisms of these
enzymes, but implications in diseases has also been a
motivating factor. Bacterial sialidases serve parasitic nutritional functions for several pathogens and may act directly
as virulence factors in some diseases e.g. cholera, gas gangrene, septiacemia, meningitis and cystic fibrosis [24],
trypanosomal sialidases are crucial for the life-cycles of
the parasitic species causing sleeping sickness and Chagas
disease [25,26], human Neu3 sialidase is a potential target
for cancer treatment [27], Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 may find
use in cancer diagnosis [28] and mutations in Neu1 are
the cause of the lysosomal storage disease sialidosis [29].
Structural insight into the Vps10-D family has just
recently been obtained by the structure determination of
sortilin [19], but more structures will probably follow,
since these proteins are now emerging as important players for central cellular functions in sorting and signaling
and are firmly linked to several human disorders e.g.
SorLA is implicated in Alzheimers disease, SorCS1 in type
2 diabetes and sortilin in age and trauma-induced neuronal cell death [30]. An examination of the structure and
occurrence of the Asp-box as well as a discussion of its
evolution and function has been published previously by
Copley et al. [3]. However, at that time the only known
Asp-box β-propellers were a number of sialdiases. Only
very recently has it been realized, that Asp-boxes are also
found in several β-propellers not belonging to the sialidase group [15]. Here we provide an updated and considerably more detailed analysis of the structure and function
of the Asp-box motif and a much needed classification
and comprehensive analysis of the Asp-box β-propeller
family.

Results and Discussion
Sequence and structure of the Asp-box
From the full Pfam BNR alignment, which is based on
5236 sequences, we find that the Asp-box consensus
sequence can be expressed as X-X-(S/t)-X-(D/n)-X-G-X-(T/
s)-(W/f/y)-X where capital letters represent the most conserved residue in a given position, small letters represent
more or less commonly seen alternatives and X signifies
variable positions. The additional variable residues at the
beginning and end of the motif are included to indicate
that they too are structurally conserved. Positions 3, 5, 7
and 10 are all strongly conserved (JalView conservation
scores of 9–10 for the full Pfam BNR alignment), whereas
the T/s of the 9th position is only partly conserved (JalView
score 4). The most preferred residues in positions 2, 6 and
8 are R, G and K respectively, but they were omitted from
the expression due to very weak conservation (JalView

score of 2). The Asp-box forms a structurally conserved
hairpin loop, which is delineated by the two main chain
hydrogen bonds between the residues at position 2 and
11, typically leaving the remaining residues to constitute
a type 8:8 β-hairpin [31]. However, since the main chain
carbonyl group at position 9 points into the loop towards
the amides at positions 4 and 5 the loop can occasionally
be classified differently (Figure 1A). The structural conservation is reflected in the distribution of phi and psi angles,
and two standard β-turns [32] are easily recognized; a type
I' turn at position 5–8 and a type VIII turn at position 7–
10 of the motif (Figure 1E). The loop structure is further
stabilized by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds
involving the conserved residues of the Asp-box motif and
a water molecule in a conserved position (Figure 1A). The
water molecule is coordinated by the main chain amide in
the 4th and the main chain carbonyl in the 9th position and
most often also the side chain hydroxyl in position 9
when a threonine or serine is found here (although not in
the example shown in Figure 1A). The hydrogen bonding
network, though slightly variable, is in general constituted
by the following interactions; the conserved hydroxyl
group at position 3 forms a hydrogen bond to the main
chain amide at position 6, the conserved D/n is within
hydrogen bonding distance of several main chain amides
and also hydrogen bonds to the side chain hydroxyl of the
S/t in position 3 as well as T/s if present in position 9. The
Cβ of S/t in position 3 forms Van der Waal contacts to the
side chain of the conserved aromatic residue in position
10 and when this is conserved as a tryptophan, which is
strongly favored, a hydrogen bond is generally formed
between the Nξ1 atom and the main chain carbonyl of the
glycine in position 7. The conserved residues thus clearly
contribute to maintaining the fold. Divergence from the
consensus sequence is tolerated to some extent, but no
other residues than D/n are found in position 5 and no
non-aromatic residues are found in position 10 in any
known structures. Furthermore, rare examples are found
of Asp-boxes that conform to the consensus sequence but
are distorted in structure. Two such examples are the Aspbox in blade 5 of M. viridifaciens sialidase [5] and the Aspbox in blade 6 of sortilin. In the case of sortilin, the conserved aspartate in position 5 is forced into an unusual
position by forming ionic interactions with an arginine
side chain of the interacting 10cc-b domain, which leads
to a marked change in the loop structure. A motif that
appears to be derived from the Asp-box has recently been
identified. It lacks the conserved G and so conforms to the
simplified consensus S/t-X-D/n-X-X-X-W/f/y [15] (Figure
1B). The structures of these motifs, which we name s-Aspboxes, s is for short, are conserved and overall similar to
that of the regular Asp-box in positioning of the conserved
side chains and the structurally conserved water molecule
(Figure 1D). The absence of the glycine in position 7 is
compensated for by changes in the psi-angle of the two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

preceding residues and in the phi angle of position 8. As a
result of this, no standard β-turns are recognized in the sAsp-box, though the traces of the two loops in the Ramachandran plot are similar (Figure 1E–F). Due to the
shorter loop, the hairpin of the s-Asp-box is typically classified as a type 7:7 β-hairpin.
Occurrence of Asp-boxes in different folds
We have performed a structure-based search for the Aspbox motif in the pdb database and find that it in addition
to the already known occurrences listed in the introduction, also occurs as repeats in the 7-bladed β-propeller of
the functionally uncharacterized bacterial YP_299179.1
protein labeled 'glycosyl hydrolase' in the NCBI database,
as singlet in the 5-bladed β-propeller of inulinase (GH32
family) and not surprisingly as singlet in the Ig-like dimerization domains of bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase and
nitrate reductase, both of which are related to the dimerization domain of eukaryotic sulfite oxidase, which is
already known to contain a single Asp-box [3]. We conclude that Asp-boxes occur in 5-bladed (rare occurrence in
GH32), 6-bladed (GH33, GH58), 7-bladed (GH74,
'YP_299179.1 family') and 10-bladed (Vps10-D) β-propellers, in the β-sandwich folds of sulfite oxidase, some
structurally related enzymes, in reelin and in chitobiase
(GH20 family), and finally in the microbial ribonuclease
domain characteristic of barnase, binase, RNase Sa, Sa2
and Sa3. A structure-based search has also been performed
for the s-Asp-box variant. This motif is found as repeats or
singlet in the 5-bladed β-propellers of the GH32 and
GH43 families and as singlet in the β-sandwich fold of
many family 32 carbohydrate binding modules (CMB32
domains), which is in good agreement with previous
observations [15]. In addition it occurs in the F5/F8 type
C domain of neuropilins and coagulation factors V and
VIII, which is not surprising, since these domains adopt
the same fold as the CBM32 domain. Finally it occurs in
the central β-sandwich of the PqqB coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein and in the anti-parallel β-sheet of the N-terminal domain of type III pantothenate kinase (type III
PanK) from Thermotoga maritima. The fold of the latter
belongs to the widespread Ribonuclease H-like family
[33], which does not generally encompass an s-Asp-box.
Indeed an s-Asp-box is even missing in type III PanK from
Bacillus anthracis and it therefore seems likely that it has
evolved relatively recent in Thermotoga maritima by chance
convergence.
Structural contexts and functions of Asp-boxes in nonpropeller folds
In Ig-like and jelly-roll β-sandwich domains the Asp-box
is rather surface exposed and is often involved in supporting domain-domain interactions. The Asp-box bends
away from the sandwich interface and the conserved aromatic residue in position 10 is found on the outer face of

one of the two β-sheets where it interacts quite extensively
with several other side chains belonging to the same sheet.
A C-terminal Ig-like domain with a single Asp-box is
found in both sulphite oxidase and chitobiase. In sulfite
oxidase the Asp-box contributes to the homodimer interaction face (Figure 2A), but chitobiase is a monomer and
it is not clear if the Asp-box plays any functional role for
this protein, although it may be noted that it is involved
in crystal packing of 1qba. Reelin is a large protein containing several so called reelin repeats, which are compact
domains consisting of three modules; an EGF sub-domain
and two β-sandwich or jelly-roll sub-domains called subrepeats A and B, which both contains a single Asp-box
(Figure 2B). As has been reported previously, the Asp-box
in subrepeat B seems to ensure that the three individual
modules form a single compact entity by binding to subrepeat A of the same repeat [20]. We find however, that
the Asp-box in subrepeat A also seems to support structural integrity. It contributes to the interface between two
reelin repeats by interacting with subrepeat B of the preceding repeat and may thus support the rodlike superstructure of the protein. In bacterial ribonucleases the single Asp-box is found in a surface exposed position in the
central β-sheet (Figure 2C) and has several functions; H85
and Y86 of RNase Sa representing positions 6 and 7 of the
Asp-box are involved in binding of the nucleotide [34]
and the histidine in position 6 is also directly involved in
catalysis [35]. In addition the tyrosines in Asp-box positions 1, 2 and 7 of RNase Sa (Y80, Y81, Y86) form hydrogen bonds, that have been shown to significantly
influence the stability of the protein [36].

ing the blade to the previous blade and additional
stabilizing contacts are often formed to the succeeding
blade as well. The distance between blades and the actual
interactions formed are quite variable, excepting that the
conserved aromatic residue in position 10 almost always
forms van der Waals interactions to the preceding blade
and/or to the loop connecting the blade to the preceding
blade. Further common interactions are from positions 6
and 8 to the preceding blade, from position 1 to the loop
connecting the blade to the preceding blade and from
positions 2 and more rarely 4 to the succeeding blade. It
has previously been proposed that the PQQ repeat/tryptophan docking motif is related to the Asp-box since this
motif also has a conserved aromatic residue in the beginning of strand 4, which is likewise involved in blade to
blade interactions [5]. We find however that the loop
between strand 3 and 4 is not overall similar in the two
motifs, and furthermore the conserved aromatic residue
of the PQQ motif points in the opposite direction and
thus interacts with the succeeding rather than the preceding blade.

Structural contexts and functions of Asp-boxes in βpropellers
In β-propellers Asp-boxes are invariantly found in the
loops between strand 3 and 4 of the sheets/blades and are
rather surface exposed (Figure 2D). They always form contacts to the previous blade or at least to the loop connect-

Furthermore, the W240R mutation in position 10 of a
conserved Asp-box in human Neu1 sialidase causes type II
sialidosis [37], and although this was hypothesized to be
caused by altered surface properties, destabilization or
misfolding of the enzyme seems to be valid alternative
explanations. However, the fact that Asp-boxes are often

Nonetheless we can conclude that the repeats of Asp-box
β-propellers appear to have a structural function in mediating blade to blade interactions reminiscent of other propeller-associated repeats. This notion is furthermore in
agreement with mutational analysis carried out on the
Clostridium perifringens NanH sialidase, since mutating
conserved Asp-box positions in this enzyme resulted in
delayed or abolished secretion and reduced enzymatic
activity indicative of misfolding [22].

missing in several blades of Asp-box β-propellers, may
suggest that they are not generally of paramount importance for dictating or stabilizing the fold and indeed additional or alternative functions in carbohydrate binding or
as secretion signals have been proposed [2,3]. The notion
that Asp-boxes may bind carbohydrate stems from the
observations that they mostly occur in carbohydrate active
enzymes and form polar surface exposed loops [3], but it
should also be mentioned that the two most conserved
residues, D and W, are generally highly favored in carbohydrate binding sites [38-40]. Asp-boxes have however
never been observed to bind carbohydrate even though a
great many known structures of Asp-box proteins have

been determined from crystals grown or soaked with carbohydrates. In addition, the conserved D and W side
chains are almost completely unavailable for interacting
with carbohydrate, since the aromatic residue is buried
between two blades and the aspartate is secluded by internal interactions of the Asp-box. Furthermore, a specific
function in binding carbohydrate enzyme substrates is
made unlikely by the facts that Asp-boxes are found on
the opposite face of the active site of glycosidase Asp-box
β-propellers, that the carbohydrate binding sites of the
occasionally found flanking carbohydrate binding modules [41,42] are likewise far away from the Asp-boxes, and
that Asp-boxes are present in non-carbohydrate active

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

proteins such as the Vps10-D receptors. A general function
in cell adhesion by binding to cell-surface glycoconjugates
is likewise unlikely, since such a function is in poor agreement with the existence of cytosolic GH33 proteins and
since the Asp-boxes of sortilin are found on the same propeller face as two bulky N-linked glycosylations. Aspboxes may however affect secretion by way of their polar
properties and if indeed the motif facilitates folding, this
function will likely translate into an effect on the rate of
secretion as well. There is however not much evidence to
suggest that Asp-boxes serve as actual signal sequences for
secretion. Indeed the existence of cytosolic GH33 proteins
makes it rather improbable that the primary function of
Asp-boxes is to aid in secretion, as has also been pointed
out previously [3]. The s-Asp-box motif is, like the Aspbox, always found in the loop between the third and
fourth strand of a subset of propeller blades when occurring in β-propellers, but it is usually found in just one or
two blades. In the CBM32/F5/F8 type C domain it is
invariantly found in a specific loop connecting two outer
strands of the β-sandwich. Notably, this loop is found
directly opposite of the CBM32 carbohydrate binding site
and there is therefore no reason to believe that it can function in carbohydrate binding. If any, it probably has a
structural function similar to that of the Asp-box.

all major branches i.e. bacteria, archea, protozoans, metazoans, plants and fungi although with some curious
absences in the metazoan branch. It has been noted previously that no Vps10-D proteins are present in the Drosophila genus or the Nematoda phylum although this
protein family is generally widespread in animals [30].
We now find that these puzzling absences actually apply
to all Asp-box repeat proteins. Most putative Asp-box βpropellers are found in bacteria. Indeed the Asp-box family appears to be one of the most common β-propeller
families in bacteria together with the PQQ and WD40related repeat families (Table 1). On the other hand, the
number of kelch and especially WD40 repeat proteins far
exceeds that of Asp-box repeat proteins in eukaryotes. The
functional range of the so far characterized Asp-box β-propellers is limited, but we find that proteins with two or
more Asp-boxes can co-occur with at least 70 different
domains and motifs, implying that Asp-box proteins are
much more variable and diverse than can be appreciated
from the currently available experimental data. Most of
these domains are implicated in carbohydrate binding,
cell surface adhesion, protein-protein interaction or different kinds of hydrolysis, or have structural or unknown
functions (see additional file 1: Suppl_Box1.pdf for list of
domains)

Phylogenetic distribution and diversity of Asp-box βpropellers
Asp-box β-propellers have so far been described from
most major branches of life as well as from some viruses
and bacteriophages. To further investigate the phylogenetic distribution, we have performed an Asp-box InterPro search. InterPro 18.0 covers 75.6% of UniProtKB and
almost exclusively detects proteins with at least two Aspbox repeats, thus only 11 out of 1311 hits in bacteria and
2 out of 562 hits in eucaryotes were found to be single
Asp-box proteins. The far majority are thus putative Aspbox β-propellers, although it should be mentioned that
reelin and possibly a few other non-propeller proteins
also contain more than one Asp-box. This search revealed
that putative Asp-box β-propellers are indeed present in

Overview and classification of known Asp-box β-propeller
structures
An overview of all known structures of Asp-box β-propellers and their basic characteristics is given in Table 2. It
should be pointed out however, that the many hundreds
of uncharacterized proteins with Asp-box repeats (Table
1), suggests that several additional families remain to be
discovered. The so far known structures of Asp-box β-propellers belong to the GH33, GH58 and GH74 glycoside
hydrolase families, an uncharacterized family defined by
YP299179.1 and the Vps10-D family. It is noticeable that
there is a considerable variation in the number of Aspboxes and that no known n-bladed structure encompasses
n Asp-boxes. In all known Asp-box β-propellers, except
YP299179.1, the N-terminal strand of the propeller

other β-propellers [43]. The maximum number, n-1, of
asp-boxes is reached in both sortilin and M. viridifaciens
sialidase, and most Asp-box β-propellers are just one or
two Asp-boxes short of a full complement. In the cases
where Asp-boxes are missing in one or more blades, it is
quite variable in which blades the absences occur, even
within the same sequence families. This is in good agreement with a general function in stabilization, since such a
function would be equally important in any blade due to
the inherent symmetry of the β-propeller fold. The s-Aspbox motif is found in the 5-bladed folds of the GH32 and
GH43 families, but usually occurs in only one or two copies and is even missing entirely in some GH43 β-propellers (not shown in Table 2). Notably there are single
examples of proteins where an s-Asp-box is found in an
Asp-box β-propeller (3sil) or vice versa (1y4w). This,
together with the structural similarities and equivalent
positions of the two motifs, strongly suggests that all or
most Asp-box and s-Asp-box β-propellers share a common ancestor. This is furthermore in agreement with
recent results from a systematic pair wise analysis of the
hidden Markov model profiles of sixty representative βpropellers, showing that the eleven Asp-box and s-Aspbox β-propellers included in the study were more similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

to each other than to other β-propellers [15]. As an alternative to sequence-based classification, Asp-box β-propellers can also be classified by the number of blades i.e. 6-,
7- or 10-bladed β-propellers, or by how the Asp-box
motifs are organized with respect to other domains and
motifs in the proteins (Figure 3). Both of these classification schemes are useful for illustrating the structural plasticity of Asp-box β-propellers and may also be valuable for
future structure predictions. Based on the currently known
structures we find that Asp-box β-propellers can be
divided into at least four different organizational types. In
type 1 a continuous stretch of Asp-box repeat blades is
associated with a single propeller domain. This is the simplest and most prevalent type and includes most sialidases, YP_299179.1 and the vertebrate Vps10-D receptors.
Type 2 also forms just one propeller domain, but here the
blades are interrupted by an inserted domain as in V. cholera sialidase. In type 3, which encompass the GH74 proteins, two propellers are formed from a continuous stretch
of Asp-box repeat blades equivalent to two type 1 propellers in immediate succession. Finally, in type 4 two propellers are formed from a stretch of Asp-boxes that is
interrupted by one or more domains, as can be deduced
to apply to yeast Vps10p. Note that these different types
may be difficult to distinguish from sequence data alone,
which can make it quite challenging to perform theoreti-

Organizational types of Asp-box β-propeller proteins

Organizational types of Asp-box β-propeller proteins. The four organizational types identified from known structures
are represented by specific examples. The Asp-boxes are shown as light blue rectangles, Asp-box propeller boundaries are
framed in blue, known or predicted blade boundaries are marked by vertical blue lines inside the frame and other domains
found in the selected examples are shown as labeled ovals. Type 1 (top); a stretch of Asp-boxes that is not interrupted by any
domains forms one β-propeller, shown here is YP299179.1 (3b7f). Type 2 (second from top); a stretch of Asp-boxes is interrupted by an inserted domain, but yet forms a single propeller, shown here is Vibrio Cholera sialidase (1w0p). 'Lect' is a lectinlike domain and 'S-l-ins' represents Pfam: Sial-lect-inser, which is a lectin binding protein-protein interaction domain, which has
a fold similar to that of 'Lect'. Type 3 (second from bottom); a stretch of Asp-boxes not interrupted by any domains forms two
tandem propellers, shown here is the GH74 protein Avicelase III from Aspergillus aculeatus (BAA29031.1). 'CBM1' stands for
carbohydrate binding module 1. Type 4 (bottom); an interrupted stretch of Asp-boxes forms two propellers, shown here is
Vps10p from yeast (AAA18831.1). '10CC' represents the two neighboring 10CC-a and 10CC-b domains.

There are currently 76 known structures with Asp-box β-propeller domains. These have 2–9 Asp-boxes and represent 16 different proteins and 5 different protein families. There are
furthermore 29 known structures with 1–3 s-Asp-box motifs, which represent 12 different proteins and 2 families of 5-bladed β-propellers. Most known structures are from bacteria (unmarked),
but there are also several from eukaryotes (species marked by *) and one from a bacteriophage (marked by †).

cal modeling of Asp-box β-propellers of structurally
uncharacterized families.
Putative hybrid β-propellers
Among the yet uncharacterized putative Asp-box β-propellers a heterogeneous group of putative hybrid β-propellers deserves specific mentioning. Hybrid β-propeller
domains containing more than one type of propellerassociated repeats are rare in known structures, yet Aspboxes are found in between other propeller-associated
repeats in several sequences. Examples are a putative
archeal kelch hybrid (InterPro accession A3CWT3) and
some putative bacterial PQQ (e.g. Q3KK02) and
Reg_Prop (e.g. A9KRI6) hybrids. The Reg_prop motif is
related to the WD40 and PQQ repeats and is according to
Pfam believed to promote a β-propeller fold, although
this has not yet been shown. Interestingly, it seems that in
some cases, Asp-boxes are even found in the same blades
as other propeller-associated repeats. The positioning of
the Asp-box and Reg_prop motifs in the sequence of the
YP_001558799.1 hypothetical protein from Clostridium
phytofermentans (A9KRI6) suggests the presence of several
hybrid blades as the two motifs follow each other in
immediate or almost immediate succession with often
just three amino acids in between (Figure 4). Such hybridblade β-propellers have to our knowledge neither been
described nor predicted before. A recombination event
involving just two strands does not seem particularly
likely and the blades of such propellers may thus represent ancestral units that have since diversified into blades
retaining just one or the other repeat. Alternatively, they
may reflect that some propeller-associated repeats have
evolved more than once e.g. the Reg_prop motif may in
one case have evolved in a blade already containing an
Asp-box.
Structural alignment of Asp-box β-propeller blades
A multiple structural alignment was made of all blades
containing an Asp-box from ten representative Asp-box βpropellers (Figure 5). The Asp-box itself is clearly the most
well-conserved feature of these blades, but there are also
several conserved hydrophobic positions; a doublet in
strand 1, a triplet in the beginning of strand 2 and a doublet in strand 3. These residues and some surrounding residues in the first three strands are furthermore
characterized by having a strong propensity for forming βstrands. Conversely, there is in between the strands, a high
incidence of residues with strong propensity for forming
turn structure i.e. G, P, S, D and N [32]. The conserved
hydrophobic positions overlaps a set of positions previously identified as being generally conserved in β-propellers [23] and the observed conservation of hydrophobic
positions and the pattern of strand and loop propensities
do therefore not appear to represent specific properties of
the Asp-box family, but rather of β-propellers in general.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

It is thus not surprising that a structural alignment including all blades of the same set of proteins reveals that the
hydrophobic positions are conserved in all the blades,
regardless if they contain an Asp-box or not (see additional file 2: Suppl_Figure1.pdf for figure). It may however be noted that these patterns can probably be readily
recognized by fold recognition programs that employ secondary structure algorithms and sensitive sequence profile matching, and thus be useful for evaluating if an
uncharacterized Asp-box repeat protein adopts a β-propeller fold or like reelin adopts an alternative fold. Mapping out the conserved residues in the structures clearly
reveals the likely reasons for why they are conserved; the
hydrophobic residues basically make up the hydrophobic
core, and as previously described the Asp-boxes mediate
stabilizing blade to blade interactions at the outer rim
(Figure 6A). The overlay resulting from the structural
alignment reveals that the two ends of the blades and
thereby also the top and bottom faces of the propeller i.e.
the faces that comprise the N-terminal and C-terminal
parts of the inner strands respectively, have very distinct
properties. The end comprising loop1–2 (the loop
between strand 1 and 2) and loop3–4 is very well-defined,
whereas the opposite end comprising loop2–3 is
extremely variable (Figure 6B). The strands generally overlay fairly well although with some exceptions, but there is
a marked variation in lengths, the outer strands are sometimes reduced to loop structure and the inner strands may
encompass various insertions, e.g. a signature of the
GH33 family is a β-bulge in the inner strand of blade 3,
which we find to conform to the consensus sequence G-XG-X-G. It is these features that underlie the previously
noted distinctive irregularity of members of the Asp-box
β-propeller family as compared to other β-propellers [23].
The conserved positions of the Asp-box are restricted to
just one loop, whereas they are scattered over longer
regions in most other propeller-associated repeats. This
probably leaves more room for structural variation in Aspbox β-propellers than in other families and could thus at
least partly explain why they contain more irregularities.
Interestingly, the set of residues involved in ligand binding and catalysis in all known Asp-box glycosidases are
located in the variable loop2–3 on the top face of the propeller. In sortilin it appears that ligand binding generally
occurs in the tunnel rather than at the loops of one of the
two faces [19], but two hydrophobic loops that strongly
protrude from the structure are expected to be of functional significance, and these loops are indeed found on
the top face. It thus seems, that the variable top face is generally used for functional activities, whereas the welldefined bottom face comprising the Asp-boxes is generally used for supporting the structural integrity of the fold.
In new structures of Asp-box β-propellers, we therefore
recommend that focus should be on the top face in any
attempts to identify functionally important residues. It is

Putative hybrid β-propeller
Putative hybrid β-propeller. The YP_001558799.1 hypothetical protein from Clostridium phytofermentans (Interpro accession A9KRI6) is an example of a putative Asp-box/Reg_prop hybrid β-propeller. A single blade (blade 2) of a fold recognition
model is shown along with a schematic of the sequence. The putative hybrid propeller boundaries suggested by fold recognition are marked by stippled purple frames and the likely boundaries of the blades are indicated by vertical lines. The Reg_Prop
repeats are colored pink, the Asp-box repeats are light blue and residues not belonging to any of these motifs are grey. The
structural model is in cartoon representation with the side chain of the tryptophan in the 10th position of the Asp-box (W111)
shown in sticks. It is based on 2cn2 and is probably rather inaccurate in most respects (sequence id. 15%), but it illustrates well
how the two motifs are likely to be arranged in special hybrid propeller blades. The fourth strand is missing in the modeled
blade, which may appear to indicate that the model is erroneous in this area, but a lack of the fourth strand is indeed quite
commonly observed for Asp-box β-propeller blades.

beyond the scope of this paper to systematically investigate if this structural and functional distinction between
the two faces also applies to other families of β-propellers,
but it should be mentioned that most β-propellers bind
ligands at the top face [44], although binding can also
occur at the bottom face [45] or at the side of the domain
[46,47]. Phasing by molecular replacement can be challenging for Asp-box β-propellers e.g. phases for the M.
viridifaciens GH33 sialidase could not be obtained using
the GH33 sialidase structures from V. Cholera or S. typh-

imurium as search models [5]. There are now so many
known structures of GH33 proteins, that phasing by
molecular replacement is a routine matter for members of
this family, but Asp-box β-propellers that are slightly
more distantly related to potential templates, can still
prove challenging. For such cases, we recommend that the
search models should include the strands and Asp-boxes,
whereas loop2–3 should be removed completely from all
blades. Furthermore, the side chains of the conserved Aspbox residues should not be trimmed. Finally we suggest

strands, black arrows representing the four strands of the sixth blade of 3b7f are shown beneath the alignment.

that theoretical models resulting from homology modeling or fold recognition should be interpreted with great
caution, since the functionally interesting parts are likely
to be on the variable top face, which will be very challenging to model accurately, unless a very closely related template is used.
The 10-bladed β-propeller fold
The Asp-box β-propeller of the recently published structure of sortilin deserves special attention in being the first
and so far only observed 10-bladed β-propeller [19]. As a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

measure for the impact on packing geometry of an
increased number of blades, we have measured the strand
to strand distances and tunnel dimensions of selected
examples of 6-, 7- and 10-bladed Asp-box β-propellers
(Table 3). The distances between the second or third
strands remain almost constant regardless of the number
of blades, but the distances between the inner first strands
or outer fourth strands increase and decrease respectively
when the number of blades increases. Thus, as more
blades are accommodated they tweak relative to each
other, so that the strand to strand distances become more

even for all four strands. It is well known that residues of
the inner strands of β-propellers pack by intercalation of
hydrophobic residues whereas residues in the other
strands pack in more variable ways [23,48], but in the 10bladed fold the inner strands have moved so far away
from each other that they now also pack in more variable
ways, much like the middle strands of the smaller β-propellers. It has previously been predicted that the tunnel of
a 10-bladed β-propeller would have a diameter of approximately 25 Å [23], but we find it to be considerably larger,
roughly 25 by 37 Å in the equatorial plane and expanding
drastically in size when moving towards the top face.
Thus, the unforeseen increase in inner strand distances
results in the tunnel of sortilin being unexpectedly large,
which is crucial for its mode of ligand binding [19]. The
shape of the tunnel is quite variable e.g. in sialidases it
narrows towards the top face as in most other β-propellers
[23], whereas in sortilin it narrows towards the bottom
face. However, the tunnel of the 5-bladed β-propeller of
tachylectin-2, which is however not an Asp-box protein,
likewise narrows towards the bottom face, suggesting that
the shape of the tunnel is not dictated by the number of
blades in the propeller. The reason why 10-bladed β-propellers are rare is not quite clear and it is difficult to assess
if the Asp-box family is better suited than other β-propeller families for adopting a 10-bladed fold. A characteristic
of the Asp-box is however, that all conserved positions
except the conserved aromatic residue are used solely to
support the structure of the Asp-box itself, so that the positions generally used for interacting with other blades are
free to vary and thus adapt to different structural contexts.
It is however possible that the 10-bladed fold is indeed
not exclusive to the Asp-box family. Some members of the
RCC1 superfamily thus have ten highly conserved RCC1like repeats that likely form a 10-bladed β-propeller,
although it can not be precluded that they rather form a
tandem of e.g. two 5-bladed β-propellers [49]. Furthermore, engineered proteins with nine or ten WD40 repeats
have been expressed, but it remains to be shown that they
actually fold as 9-bladed or 10-bladed β-propellers [50].

Conclusion
Here we have examined the occurrence of the Asp-box and
investigated its structure and structural contexts in detail
and we also provide the first thorough overview, classification and detailed structural analysis of Asp-box β-propellers. In addition we have dealt with the current
confusion regarding the functions of Asp-box repeats,
which is an important point to clarify given their wide distribution and occurrence in physiologically and medically
important protein families. Finally, we have analyzed the
packing principles of the 10-bladed β-propeller fold,
which has so far exclusively been observed in the Asp-box
β-propeller family. The Asp-box and the shorter variant,
the s-Asp-box, both occur in different folds, but are most
prominently found in β-propellers. They can be viewed as
micro-scaffolds where the conserved residues ensure a stable very well-defined fold of the motifs and the residues in
variable positions are free to carry out other functions.
Generally, the Asp-box has a structural role both when it
occurs as singlet and when it occurs as repeats, but it can
also be used for other purposes i.e. it is involved in catalysis and nucleotide binding in microbial ribonucleases. In
β-propellers, the Asp-box repeats support structural integrity by mediating blade to blade interactions, but
although they may have additional roles in some cases, a
survey of the current evidence does not support the previously suggested functions as secretion signals or carbohydrate binding motifs. Putative Asp-box β-propellers occur
in all major branches of life and appear to constitute one
of the most common β-propeller families in bacteria. Furthermore, Asp-box repeats occur together with a long list
of different domains, suggesting a much wider functional
range of the Asp-box β-propeller family than has hitherto
been acknowledged. Most or all Asp-box and s-Asp-box βpropellers probably share a common ancestor, which
would place the GH32, GH33, GH43, GH58, GH74 and
Vps10-D families in the same superfamily. However, since
the Asp-box and s-Asp-box are quite short motifs and
occur in β-sheets with different topologies, it is certainly
possible that they in some cases have evolved by conver-

gence, e.g. it seems likely that the s-Asp-box in the Ribonuclease H-like fold of Thermotoga maritima type III PanK
has evolved by recent chance convergence, as it does not
generally occur in other related proteins with this fold.
The discovery of novel putative hybrid-blade β-propellers
is intriguing and may prompt a revised view of β-propeller
evolution, but detailed evolutionary analysis should await
experimental validation of the predicted fold. A multiple
structural alignment of representative Asp-box β-propeller
blades discloses that not only the Asp-boxes are conserved, but also a set of hydrophobic positions with high
propensity for β-strand formation. These appear to be
common to all β-propellers and may be helpful in predicting if an uncharacterized Asp-box repeat protein adopts a
β-propeller fold. The structural alignment furthermore
shows that the two faces of Asp-box β-propellers are strikingly different and further examination reveals that they
are indeed also used for different purposes; the top face is
extremely variable and is used for functional purposes
whereas the bottom face displays limited variability and
supports the fold. This finding will likely be very useful for
interpretation of future structures and can also, along with
the classification into organizational types, be used for
aiding the making and evaluation of theoretical models.
The analysis of the 10-bladed fold, which has so far only
been observed in the Asp-box sequence family of β-propellers, reveals that accommodation of more blades in an
Asp-box β-propeller, and indeed probably in any β-propeller, is accompanied by tweaking of the blades, so that
the distances between inner strands becomes longer and
those of the outer strands become shorter. This increase in
inner strand distances explains the unexpectedly large size
of the ligand binding tunnel of sortilin, which is crucial
for the function and regulation of this receptor [19] and
probably of the Vps10-D receptors in general.

Methods
Classification and sequence analysis
The nomenclature for glycosidase families that encompass Asp-box β-propeller domains was looked up in the
CAZy database for sequence-based classification of carbohydrate active enzymes http://www.cazy.org/[51]. The
Asp-box consensus sequence was determined from the
full alignment of the BNR entry in the Pfam release 22.0
database http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[52] and Pfam was
also used to identify the various motifs and domains that
can be present in proteins with at least two Asp-box
repeats. It should be noted however that Pfam release 23.0
contains a much smaller set of sequences in the BNR
entry. This is also reflected in the current version of interpro (20.0) as it is based in part on Pfam. Information on
the phylogenetic distribution of Asp-box repeats and
other propeller-associated repeats was retrieved from
InterPro 18.0 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/[53], putative hybrid propellers were identified using both Pfam

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/46

and InterPro, and fold recognition of YP_001558799.1
was carried out with the Phyre server http://
www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/[54].
Structure-based search for Asp-box proteins
The structural search for Asp-box motifs was carried out
with SPASM [55] using the first Asp-box of 2bf6 (residues
302–311) and the July_08 pdb database [56] as inputs.
The key search criteria were as follows; max superpositioning RMSD was set to 1.0 Å, max Cα-Cα distance mismatch
was set to 1.5 Å, BLOSUM 45 was used as substitution
matrix, the directionality and gaps of the peptide trace was
conserved and only the Cα atoms were used for centre-ofgravity. The search for the one residue shorter motif,
which we call the s-Asp-box, was also carried out using
SPASM. Here the conserved S, D and W of the first s-Aspbox of 1y4w (S75, D77, W81) was used as input. The key
search criteria were as follows; max superpositioning
RMSD was set to 0.7 Å, max Cα-Cα distance mismatch
was set to 0.5 Å, max side chain to side chain distance mismatch was set to 2.0 Å, the only allowed substitutions
were S75/T, D77/N and W81/F/Y, the directionality and
gaps were conserved, and here both the Cα and side chain
atoms were used for centre-of-gravity. For both search procedures, the sequences of the hits were checked and representative hits were manually inspected in PyMol [57] in
order to avoid potential false negatives. Importantly,
SPASM proved efficient in finding the Asp-boxes and sAsp-boxes of proteins that were already known to contain
these motifs, demonstrating the robustness of the
approach.
Structural alignment and analysis
Borders for individual Asp-box β-propeller blades (first
residue in the first strand to last residue in the fourth
strand) were identified using PDBsum http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum[58]. The multiple structural
alignments of blades and individual Asp-box/s-Asp-box
motifs were then made with the MUSTANG program [59]
and the results were presented using PyMol and the
JalView alignment editor [60]. Information on hairpin,
turn types and phi and psi angles for Asp-boxes and s-Aspboxes was retrieved from PDBsum. Strand to strand distances were measured between equatorial Cα atoms in
PyMol and averaged over all blades in the analyzed structures. The dimensions of the β-propeller tunnels were
measured between any surface-exposed atoms in the
equatorial plane.

Authors' contributions
