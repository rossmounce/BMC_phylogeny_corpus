Large-scale gene discovery in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum
(Hemiptera)

Abstract

Many of the 4,500 aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
cause serious physical and economic damage to cultivated
and ornamental plants throughout the world. Aphids affect
plant growth not only directly through feeding on phloem sap
but also as vectors of plant viruses [1]. The extent of losses due

to aphids is difficult to evaluate as it depends on multiple factors such as aphid species or virus isolate, crop, location, and
year. On many crops insecticides provide a simple solution
for aphid control. The large-scale application of such chemicals is becoming increasingly unacceptable, however, and
their use needs to be optimized in an environmentally

Background

interactions

Aphids are the leading pests in agricultural crops. A large-scale sequencing of 40,904 ESTs from the
pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum was carried out to define a catalog of 12,082 unique transcripts. A
strong AT bias was found, indicating a compositional shift between Drosophila melanogaster and A.
pisum. An in silico profiling analysis characterized 135 transcripts specific to pea-aphid tissues
(relating to bacteriocytes and parthenogenetic embryos). This project is the first to address the
genetics of the Hemiptera and of a hemimetabolous insect.

acceptable way so as to maintain both farm incomes and an
adequate food supply. This is even more important in face of
the increasing number of aphid species (more than 20) that
have developed resistant populations against most insecticides [2]. The use of plant varieties resistant to aphids is an
alternative to chemical control. But again, aphids have developed biotypes able to overcome the few sources of aphid
resistance in plants [3]. It is therefore necessary to develop
new targets for specific and effective molecules against aphids
and to assess their sustainability through a careful analysis of
the adaptive potential of these insects.
The harmful effects of aphids depend on four main traits:
first, a high intrinsic rate of increase driven largely by parthenogenesis and telescoping of generations [4]; second, the
capacity to adapt physiologically to variable phloem sap content between host plants [5], which is partly conferred by bacterial endosymbionts; third, the facultative production of
winged dispersal forms [6], which allows the rapid colonization of new environments; and fourth, the vectoring of many
plant viral pathogens [7,8].
A basic understanding of aphid biology and applied research
both require a better characterization of the physiological,
cellular, and molecular mechanisms specific to these insects.
Aphid sequences are poorly represented in gene databases:
when beginning this study (in November 2003) only 6,491
nucleotide sequences (including a majority of anonymous
molecular markers) were found in GenBank for the whole
Aphididae family. Although several other insect genomes are
now available, they all belong to orders that undergo complete metamorphosis (the Holometabola) and share a common ancestor about 300 million years ago (Figure 1). The
evolutionary divergence of aphids (which belong to the Hemiptera and do not undergo complete metamorphosis) from the
Holometabola occurred about 330 million years ago [9], so
their genome is expected to differ substantially from that of
other insects. Genomic data for non-holometabolous insects
(aphids will be the first complete sequence in that category
along with the bug Rhodnius prolixus) will have great value
for understanding aphid biology.
The International Aphid Genomics Consortium has selected
the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum as the model aphid species (it has a genome of four holocentric chromosomes and
approximately 525 Mb), and its genome sequencing project
has recently been funded. We present here a collection of
40,904 high-quality annotated expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) generated from different organs of the pea aphid.
These ESTs form 12,082 different contigs and singletons, and
represent a first significant step towards the comprehensive
description of cellular functions involved in aphid biology.

Results
Unique transcript catalog for A. pisum
We generated 47,443 ESTs from nine cDNA libraries corresponding to six different biological sources (Table 1) representing about 28 Mb. Sequences were filtered in order to
remove rRNA contaminants, short sequences, Escherichia
coli and Buchnera aphidicola sequences (see Materials and
methods and Table 2). From 47,443 sequences, 40,904 (86%)
were retained for further analysis. Some virus sequences
(213) were detected in the collection and were eliminated
afterwards. Cytochrome oxidase subunits I and III transcripts
encoded by the mitochondrion (289 and 119 ESTs respectively) were detected as well. The average sequence size per
library varied from 363 bp (ApHL3SD) to 871 bp (ApBac).
Clusters and contigs were produced from the set of 40,904
ESTs, together with three cDNAs retrieved from GenBank.
Redundancy (defined as one minus the number of ESTs forming singletons and contigs/total number of ESTs) ranged
from 30% (antennae) to 86% and 92% (bacteriocytes and parthenogenetic embryos respectively) (see Table 2). A contig
version (called v2) determined from the whole collection of
40,907 ESTs and cDNAs is available [10]. A total of 12,082
different assembled sequences were produced with a global
redundancy of 70.5%. Despite this high redundancy, contigs
composed of only one EST (singletons) were more abundant
(7,782 contigs or 64%) than contigs made of more than one
EST (4,300 contigs or 36%) (see Table 2). In this paper, we
will call 'unique transcripts' the collection of 12,082 different
assembled A. pisum sequences composed of singletons and
contigs.

Functional annotation
Putative functions corresponding to this pea aphid gene collection were reported by comparing these ESTs with the Uniprot database using BLASTX. Among the 12,082 unique
transcripts 7,146 showed no homology with any other protein
sequences (resulting in 59% of orphan sequences). This high
representation of orphan genes might reflect the limited
sequence quality delivered by single-pass sequencing (for
example, too short sequences, wrong base calling leading to
frameshift errors, and so on) [11]. Figure 2 indicates that pea
aphid unique transcripts corresponding to orphan sequences
were biased toward smaller sizes. Indeed, 25% of the orphan
sequences and 2.5% of the sequences with a significant hit
were less than 300 bp long, while 3% of the orphan sequences
and 21% of the sequences with a significant hit were more
than 1,000 bp long. Moreover, the median size for sequences
with significant database hits was 838, whereas it was 596 for
sequences without significant hits. Short sequence length
cannot, however, explain our inability to detect homology for
all no-hits sequences and some of these would actually contain coding genes that would be unique to aphids.
The 25 most abundant unique transcripts are listed (see Additional Data File 1 for the original data used to perform this

analysis). Many correspond to housekeeping proteins (for
example, ribosomal proteins and structural proteins) but
some are orphan genes or represent more specific functions
like the gene takeout (see Discussion). Among the 4,936
annotated unique transcripts, 4,080 and 3,977 had a significantly similar hit in D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, respectively. Thus, less than 34% of the pea aphid
unique transcripts have similarities to the model dipteran
species D. melanogaster. Among these, 751 D. melanogaster
genes (defined as having a FlyBase ID) correspond to more
than one A. pisum contig. This suggests the occurence of several paralogs of many pea aphid transcripts.
Pea aphid unique transcripts were also annotated through the
Gene Ontology (GO) classification [12] (Table 3). The GoToolBox statistical test was used to compare the distribution of the
GO terms in pea aphid unique transcripts with the D. melanogaster homologs for the different GO terms. General processes ('Physiological' or 'Cellular Processes', as well as 'Cell
Components' or 'Transporter Activity') are more highly represented in the aphid collection than in the fly. This is due to the
high proportion of 'Binding' and 'Catalytic Activity' terms in
the aphid collection. The depletion of 'Development' GO
terms in the pea aphid collection was unexpected, as in the
parthenogenetic females that we sampled, embryos develop
continuously in the ovarioles [13]. We also found an over-representation of transcripts with 'Translational Regulator
Activity' and an under-representation of transcripts with 'Signal Transducer Activity'. There is an absence of A. pisum
unique transcripts from the 'Defense and Immunity' category: this may reflect the fact that the aphids were not challenged with pathogens or parasites. Several enzymes involved
in degradation of bacterial cell wall have been detected,
however.

Separation of coding and noncoding sequences
Detection of coding sequences by a program (FrameD) based
on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (also using similarity

information for sequences that had hits in databases) allowed
us to predict open reading frames (ORF) among the different
categories of sequences (those with or without a hit). As
expected, there was a high rate of ORF prediction in the
former category (more than 96% for contigs of at least 1,000
bp, see Figure 2). There was, however, a small proportion of
sequences with a hit (and yet probably containing an ORF)
but without any coding sequence (CDS) predicted. The frequency of such false negatives slightly exceeded 10% for contigs less than 1,000 bp and peaked for the shortest ones.
Failure to detect a CDS is probably linked with too short size
of the coding region in these sequences (which are probably
mostly untranslated region (UTR)), and is also possibly a
result of a low EST coverage (short contigs are made of fewer
ESTs). For sequences without any hit in the Uniprot database,
the program also generated some CDS but at a markedly
lower frequency. The frequency of detected CDS appeared to
plateau at about 30% for short contigs (less than 1,000 bp)
and then rose sharply at about 60% for longer sequences (see
Figure 2). Probably, most of the short contigs without hits and
without detected CDS are entirely made of untranslated
region (UTR), while 'long' contigs with the same characteristics are either particularly long UTRs, or could be untranslated RNAs with a functional activity. Overall, we could
therefore extract a large collection of coding sequences and 5'
UTR and 3' UTR sequences, and analyze their compositional
properties.

GC content of different regions and microsatellites
The global mean GC content was 33% (SD = 9.3% for the
12,082 unique transcripts), indicative of an AT-rich genome.
Extraction of CDS and their separation from 5' UTRs and 3'
UTRs yielded estimates of nucleotide composition at the different codon positions and in noncoding parts of the contigs
for 5,309 aphid unique transcripts. For comparative purposes
we analyzed a subset of the D. melanogaster transcript
sequences corresponding to putative homlologs to pea aphid
contigs, which amounted to 3,443 different CDS in the fly.

We carried out in silico gene-expression profiling for each tissue used for cDNA library construction (see 3 for the original
data used to perform this analysis). This statistical test was
performed on the organ-specific cDNA libraries, with the
exception of the Whole body - Multi stage library. A group of
135 unique transcripts was selected above the R threshold of
10, corresponding to a 1% error risk, based on a Monte-Carlo
computation. We found that bacteriocytes and parthenogenetic embryos were rich in tissue-specific unique transcripts
(58 and 52, respectively). Thus, while these two libraries
showed the highest level of redundancy (see Table 2), they
also contained many tissue-specific genes. Bacteriocyte-specific unique transcripts corresponded mainly to amino-acid
metabolism and transport as well as defense reactions, and
have been described in detail elsewhere [17]. A majority of the
genes specifically expressed in the bacteriocytes - as judged
by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) performed in [17] - were among the list of the unique transcripts

A list of 921 perfect microsatellite motifs is presented (see
Additonal data file 2 for the original data used to perform this
analysis) with their location in 796 different unique transcripts. A large proportion of microsatellite loci were dinucleotide (453) and trinucleotide (442) whereas 26

In contrast, a major compositional change between aphid and
fly was observed at the third synonymous codon positions,
which are typically more susceptible to evolutionary change.
The relatively high dispersion of %GC3 (the percentage of G
or C at the third codon position), as measured by a larger
standard deviation in aphid sequences (see Table 4), leads us
to expect a rather strong heterogeneity in base composition
and codon usage. This will be the subject of a future paper.
Finally, the estimated percentage of GC in the 5' UTRs of the
transcripts (34.9%) is almost equal to that of the third codon
position, and that of 3' UTRs is even lower (23.1%). Thus,
overall, the pea aphid transcripts show a significant compositional shift from D. melanogaster in being more AT rich while
D. melanogaster shows high GC richness at the third codon
position [14,15].

tetranucleotide repeats were found in the database. This differs from the general pattern of dominance of dinucleotide
repeats and rarity of trinucleotide repeats [16]. (AT)n repeats
dominate in pea aphid ESTs. Information from our gene prediction analysis shows that 92.5% of these motifs are expected
to locate in noncoding sequences (either in contigs with no
gene detected, or in the 5' UTR or 3' UTR of a contig with a
gene dectected). These observations are statistically consistent with a high AT richness of the pea aphid genome and the
locations of most motifs in noncoding sequences that are even
more AT rich. These microsatellites provide a large collection
of potential markers for genetic mapping and analysis of
quantitative trait loci.

deposited research

Within the CDS, we found a sharp difference in GC content
between the two insect species, particularly at the synonymous third codon positions (34% and 69% GC for A. pisum
and D. melanogaster respectively) (Table 4). The net difference between the two species (defined as %GC from D. melanogaster minus %GC from A. pisum) was 9.0%, 2.8%, and
34.4% at the first, second, and third synonymous positions,
respectively. The small difference at the second codon positions is consistent with these sites typically being the most
conserved (because a change at the second position is always
nonsynonymous).

selected in silico (for example, lysozyme, phenylalanine
monooxygenase, and inorganic phosphate transporter).
The parthenogenetic embryos displayed a high redundancy of
unique transcripts and, most surprisingly, 75% of these
unique transcripts did not share a homolog with D. melanogaster. Some of these highly expressed transcripts do not
share similarity with any other sequences in GenBank. This
might indicate specialized differentiation processes specific
to parthenogenetic embryogenesis in aphids [13]. Two transcripts encoding proteins homologous to D. melanogaster
proteins involved in regulation of sex determination (Transformer-2) and dosage compensation (MSL3) were detected as
specifically expressed in parthenogenetic early embryos. But,
whether sex determination and dosage compensation mechanisms in aphids are similar to those of Drosophila or not
remains unknown.
Transcripts specifically expressed in heads and antennae of
the pea aphid were also identified. Among the head- and
antennae-specific transcripts were several endocuticular proteins, which may suggest a special cuticle composition of the
head and antennae, and/or the high cuticle ratio represented
in these body parts compared with other analyzed organs.

Hemiptera (for example, true bugs, whiteflies, cicadas, and
aphids) are characterized by modified piercing and sucking
mouthparts that are used to suck plant juices or to bite animals, and include many agricultural and horticultural pests
as well as biting and blood-sucking pests (for example, Rhodnius prolixus, the vector of Chagas' disease). The pea aphid
EST collection described in this paper represents half of all
the Hemiptera sequences deposited in GenBank (as of October 2005) and is an invaluable source of molecular markers
(microsatellites) and protein-coding genes. The large collection of unique transcripts derived from these ESTs may represent a high percentage of the expected approximately
15,000 genes from the genome of A. pisum, as estimated from
the gene content of other insect species. Hemiptera and Diptera have diverged for more than 300 million years [18] and
only about one-third of the pea aphid unique transcripts have
putative homologs with the two dipteran species D. melanogaster and A. gambiae. The pea aphid gene sequences
show a marked AT enrichment at degenerate positions compared with those of Diptera. A detailed study elsewhere will
analyze more precisely the patterns of codon usage and codon
preferences in the aphid genome, to determine whether we
find signs of adaptation of codon bias, as has been found in D.
melanogaster [19]. Buchnera species, the aphids' primary
endosymbiont, also exhibits a strong bias towards AT [20],
contrary to the situation in most free-living enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli.
The pest status attributed to many aphid species is largely the
result of their biology, such as their particular mode of reproduction through cyclical parthenogenesis, their dispersal
capacity through the induction of winged morphs, their transmission of viral and other plant diseases, and their rapid
adaptation to insecticides and resistant host plants. Our
large-scale EST project involving both the whole insect and
specific tissues or organs is a first step in describing the cellular functions involved in these biological processes. The
sequences derived from the whole-insect library provide an
overview of the main cellular functions active in pea aphid
parthenogenetic females. In contrast, the five other cDNA
libraries from isolated organs focused on more specific functions in the head, antennae, digestive tract, bacteriocytes, and
parthenogenetic embryos. This diversity of tissue types, as
well as the use of non-normalization procedures, allowed digital analysis of gene expression. The in silico analysis of geneexpression patterns identified 135 genes putatively expressed
in tissue-specific patterns. For example, our analysis revealed
that the parthenogenetic embryos express a large number of
orphan genes that are expressed at low levels or not at all in
other tissues. The parthenogenic aphids of embryos represent
a highly modified form of embryogenesis [13]. It is possible
that these novel genes play specific roles in embryonic development and, if so, then this would conflict with the widespread view that embryonic development in insects reflects
the action of conserved genes in distantly related species [21].

high levels of expression of these ESTs in our collections, it is
likely that these takeout-related genes have an unexpected
and important role in aphid biology.

information

A. pisum belongs to the tribe Macrosiphini of the family
Aphididae. Some of the most important aphid agricultural
pests, such as the Russian wheat aphid Diuraphis noxia and
the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae, belong to the Macrosiphini. There are more limited EST collections from two species of the tribe Aphidini, also of the family Aphididae,
Rhopalosiphum padi and Toxoptera citricida, and many of
these ESTs share homologs with ESTs in our collection. This
indicates that our A. pisum unique transcript set is a valuable

interactions

A second surprising result of our survey is the observation
that transcripts for genes related to the takeout gene of D.
melanogaster are expressed at high levels in pea aphids. The
transcripts we found seem, in fact, to represent two paralogs
that originated after the divergence of the common ancestor
of aphids from the common ancestor of flies (data not
shown). Both paralogs are found in both our collection of
ESTs from A. pisum and the ESTs from another aphid, Toxoptera citricida [22]. Takeout shares amino-acid sequence
similarity with a large class of proteins related to juvenilehormone-binding proteins. Takeout is regulated both by circadian rhythms [23] and by the sex-determination pathway
[24]. The gene is also induced under starvation conditions
and prolongs survival under starvation conditions. In addition, a related protein, Moling, discovered in the tobacco
hawkmoth Manduca sexta (also known as the tomato hornworm, hornblower or Carolina sphinx) [25], is regulated by

Conclusion

This work demonstrates the importance of characterizing
transcript collections (codon usage, putative paralogs,
orphan sequences) of an agronomical important pest that
diverged a long time ago from model organisms. To pursue
this effort, the aphid EST collection is an important resource
for the future annotation of the pea aphid genome, which was
selected in 2005 by the National Human Genome Research
Institutefor sequencing.

Materials and methods
Nomenclature
Several cDNA libraries were constructed from different A.
pisum genotypes and different biological sources. The names
and descriptions of the different cDNA libraries are listed in
Table 1. Bacteriocyte ESTs have already been described elsewhere [17]. For some libraries, different codes were used to
discriminate between the different sequencing centers.

Biological material
The pea aphid lines YR2 [27] and P123 (A. Frantz, M. Plantegenest, and J.C.S. unpublished work) were reared on Vicia
fabae in the laboratory. They were maintained in conditions
of continuous parthenogenetic reproduction under long photoperiod (16 hours light/8 hours dark) and warm temperature (18°C). For libraries ApAL3SD and ApHL3SD, insects
were placed in sex-inducing conditions using a standard protocol at short photoperiod [27] in order to enrich the cDNA
libraries in transcripts expressed during induction of sexual
reproduction. The strain ISO was described in [17]. The clone
LL01 of A. pisum used for 15 years for all the Lyon group's
physiological and toxicological experiments, was collected in
1987 near Lusignan (France) from an alfalfa field, and has
been continuously reared since then on broad bean seedlings
in parthenogenetic conditions. An anonymous clone collected
in Cambridge, UK, that has since been lost, was used to generate the cDNA libraries ApMS, 14419 and 14436.

cDNA libraries
The multistage cDNA library (ApMS; 14419; 14436) was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from the whole bodies
of a mixture of wingless and winged parthenogenetic individuals at the five different developmental stages (first through
fourth instar larvae and adult). All other cDNA libraries were
prepared from total RNA. Transcripts from antennae and
heads were extracted from third instar larvae of parthenogenetic individuals (50 individuals for heads and 200 individuals for antennae) reared under either long (ApHL3LD,
ID0ACC and ID0AEE) or short (ApAL3SD, ApHL3SD) photoperiod. Dissection of antennae and heads (without antennae) was performed under a dissecting microscope on frozen
insects. Parthenogenetic embryos (n = 150) were dissected
from adult parthenogenetic females under a dissecting microscope: only the three to four earliest stages of embryos were
collected. The digestive tract cDNA library was constructed
from the guts of young parthenogenetic adult females. For
dissection of guts, insects were immobilized in batches of 10
or 20, and guts were carefully dissected in ice-cold PBS,
pulled out through the head after liberating the hindgut by
cutting the anal part. Freshly dissected gut batches (n = 50)
were deep-frozen by plunging the plastic Eppendorf tube in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until extraction (n =
1,200).
Total and poly(A)+ RNAs were extracted either by the guanidinium-salt-phenol chloroform procedure as described
[22] or by using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) in the RTL extraction buffer. Plasmid cDNA libraries were constructed with the Creator Smart cDNA Library
Construction Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, USA).
Lambda Uni-ZAP libraries and mass excision of plasmids
were obtained as described [22]. The bacterial glycerol stocks
are archived at the Horticultural Research Laboratory (USA),
the INRA-Rennes Laboratory (France), the INRA-Lyon Laboratory (France), and RIKEN (Japan).

Sequencing, sequence processing and annotation
Sequencing reactions were performed either on purified plasmids [22,28] or on PCR-amplified products [29] using the
ABI PRISM BigDye technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster

interactions

Identification of ORFs among the collection of contigs was
intended to be by analysis separately of the compositional
properties of different sections of the DNA sequences - CDS
or UTR. As a first step, we used similarity information from a
BLASTX pairwise comparison between the collection of contigs and the D. melanogaster coding genome. High-scoring
pairings indicate that the coding frame in the contig had a hit
in D. melanogaster, and this is followed by a search for the
first 5' methionine and the first 3' stop codon. Because such
reconstruction was limited to contigs with a hit in D. melanogaster, however, and was error prone (for example, no fine
detection of potential frameshifts and poor identification of
the starts and ends of genes), we used a randomly chosen
sample of 270 putative complete CDS constructed in the first
step (genes starting with a methionine and ended by a stop
codon) to train a program based on HMMs. This program,
FrameD, has been specially designed to recognize genes
among genomes of biased composition and among noisy data
(such as ESTs), predicting frameshifts and proposing corrections in such cases [42]. After training, the program was run
on the complete set of contigs, using both the information
from the matrix of the training set and similarity information
(BLASTX hits if any). The program can be used online at [43],
setting the probabilistic model to 'Apisum'.

deposited research

Simple-sequence repeats and SNPs
Perfect simple-sequence repeats have been extracted from
the pea aphid unique transcripts by application of an exact
pattern algorithm. Only motifs with at least seven repetitions
of two nucleotides, six repetitions of three nucleotides or five
repetitions of four nucleotides were retrieved.

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R21

information

Description of the contig collection was facilitated by a link to
the GO database through the Amigo browser [12] to search for
contigs belonging to different GO categories. Furthermore,
GO categories were also used to search for over- or under-represented GO terms in the pea aphid contig dataset using
GOToolBox [39]. This program statistically associates overor under-represented GO terms with a given contig, compared to the distribution of these terms among the annotation
of the complete genome. For this analysis, as the A. pisum
genome is not yet available, D. melanogaster was selected as
the reference genome. Thus, only the A. pisum contigs having
a hit with a D. melanogaster gene have been computed. Putative orthologous peptides of the pea aphid unique transcript
sequences were extracted from FlyBase using BLASTX
(greater than an E-value threshold of 1e-5) and used for the
comparison between the D. melanogaster and A. pisum distribution of GO terms.

A statistical analysis of the frequency of each EST in the different cDNA libraries was performed to compare geneexpression levels in different tissues. Groups of contigs and
singletons were first done on the basis of their EST composition (frequency per cDNA library), using the K-means algorithm through a boostrap aggregating function provided by
the R package. Whole contig groups or selected K means were
then statistically analyzed to identify putative differentially
expressed genes [40]. The null hypothesis states that the frequency of a gene transcript is the same in each library, the
variation in numbers of ESTs from different libraries in a
given contig being due to sampling error. The significance of
the R-value test is determined either by a large deviation rate
or a Monte Carlo simulation. Any new putative differentially
expressed genes can be identified on a web interface (ADEL Analysis of the Distribution of ESTs in cDNA Libraries) developed at Genoplante-Info [41].

reports

Of the remaining sequences, clustering was performed using
Biofacet [33], based on the criteria of 96% similarity in 80 bp.
Clusters were then aligned in contigs and consensus
sequences were obtained using Cap3 [34]. The contigs were
analyzed through a NCBI-BLASTX [35] against Uniprot [36]:
only significant matches with a Phred 20 score and with an Evalue of less than 1.0e-5 were considered for report. All data
were stored in a freely accessible relational database [10]. A
tutorial is available [37] and all sequences (contigs and singletons) can be downloaded [38].

EST frequencies

reviews

Each EST was then analyzed through a pipeline for cleaning
and clustering, as described in [30]. Phred was used from
traces to predict sequences. Adaptor and vector were localized using cross_match, an implementation of a SmithWaterman algorithm using default matrix (1 for a match, -2
penalty for a mismatch), with mean scores of 6 and 10 respectively. Sequences were then trimmed following three criteria:
vector and adaptor, poly(A) tail or low quality (defined as at
least 15 among 20 bp with a phred score below 12) [30]. Identification of contaminant sequences was also performed by
cross_match, using the default matrix (1 for a match, -2 penalty for a mismatch). E. coli and yeast sequences were eliminated with a score greater than 100 against complete
corresponding genomes retrieved from Genbank. Ribosomal
sequences were eliminated by comparison to an invertebrate
ribosomal sequence library (extracted from GenBank) using a
cross_match score of 50. Finally, as aphids live in symbiosis
with Buchnera bacteria [31], A. pisum ESTs were compared
to the Buchnera species APS genome [32] and those
sequences presenting a match score of greater than 50 were
eliminated.
