Abstract
Background-: Parent-specific methylation of specific CpG residues is critical to imprinting in
eutherian mammals, but its importance to imprinting in marsupials and, thus, the evolutionary
origins of the imprinting mechanism have been the subject of controversy. This has been
particularly true for the imprinted Insulin-like Growth Factor II (IGF2), a key regulator of embryonic
growth in vertebrates and a focal point of the selective forces leading to genomic imprinting. The
presence of the essential imprinting effector, DNMT3L, in marsupial genomes and the
demonstration of a differentially methylated region (DMR) in the retrotransposon-derived
imprinted gene, PEG10, in tammar wallaby argue for a role for methylation in imprinting, but several
studies have found no evidence of parent-specific methylation at other imprinted loci in marsupials.
Results-: We performed the most extensive search to date for allele-specific patterns of CpG
methylation within CpG isochores or CpG enriched segments across a 22 kilobase region
surrounding the IGF2 gene in the South American opossum Monodelphis domestica. We identified a
previously unknown 5'-untranslated exon for opossum IGF2, which is flanked by sequences defining
a putative neonatal promoter, a DMR and an active Matrix Attachment Region (MAR).
Demethylation of this DMR in opossum neonatal fibroblasts results in abherrant biallelic expression
of IGF2.
Conclusion-: The demonstration of a DMR and an active MAR in the 5' flank of opossum IGF2
mirrors the regulatory features of the 5' flank of Igf2 in mice. However, demethylation induced
activation of the maternal allele of IGF2 in opossum differs from the demethylation induced
repression of the paternal Igf2 allele in mice. While it can now be concluded that parent-specific
DNA methylation is an epigentic mark common to Marsupialia and Eutheria, the molecular
mechanisms of transcriptional silencing at imprinted loci have clearly evolved along independent
trajectories.

Background
Monodelphis domestica is a South American opossum of the
family Didelphidae, belonging to the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia, which last shared a common ancestor
with Eutheria approximately 145 million years ago [1].
Marsupials possess a non-invasive yolk sac placenta that
allows for maternal-fetal nutrient exchange following
implantation [2]. Thus, while marsupials differ from eutherians in several embryological features, notably: the
absence of both a morula stage and an inner cell mass during development [3], they can, nonetheless, be considered
"placental" mammals.
Marsupials also share with eutherians genomic imprinting, resulting in parent-specific gene expression (PSGE) at
several loci in embryonic and placental development.
Examination of allele-specific expression patterns of IGF2
in M. domestica and the chicken Gallus gallus showed
paternal monoallelic expression in opossum but biallelic
expression in birds [4], supporting the Kinship Theory of
genomic imprinting [5]. PSGE has since been demonstrated for the genes IGF2R, PEG1/MEST, and PEG10 in
marsupials, but thus far PSGE has not been found in birds
or egg-laying mammals, the monotremes [6-8].
Imprinted expression of most genes in eutherians is
dependent upon parent-specific differential methylation
of specific CpG residues within imprinted loci. The indispensability of CpG methylation to the maintenance of
genomic imprints in eutherians was first demonstrated by
the loss of imprinting in mice carrying targeted mutations
of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene, Dnmt1
[9]. Furthermore, mice carrying targeted mutations of the
gene, Dnmt3L, demonstrated the necessity of this DNA
methyltransferase-like gene to the establishment of
genomic imprints in the female germline. A Dnmt3L
ortholog has been identified in marsupials [10], but the
importance of methylation to imprinting in marsupials
has remained controversial since several studies have
failed to identify differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) associated with imprinted loci in marsupials
[6,8,11]. However, the recent discovery of a DMR associated with the PEG10 gene in the tammar wallaby is the
first demonstration that differential methylation is critical
for imprinted expression of a gene in marsupials [12].
PEG10 is a gene derived from the retrotransposon sushi
ichi leading these authors to hypothesize that mammalian
genomic imprinting evolved from a host defense mechanism to silence selfish mobile elements [12].
In eutherians, imprinting of IGF2 depends upon allelespecific interaction of DMRs within and near the IGF2
transcription unit [13,14]. In mouse, the DMRs include
DMR1, a paternally methylated repressor element adjacent to the fetal-specific promoter [15], DMR2, a pater-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/205

nally methylated element in the last protein-coding exon
of Igf2 [16], and the H19-DMD imprinting control region
(ICR) located 90 kb downstream of Igf2 that binds the
insulator CTCF on the unmethylated maternal allele
[15,17]. Both DMR1 and DMR2 associate with MARs that
allow for long-range interactions with the ICR [13,14,18].
The interaction of DMR1 with the ICR on the maternal
allele generates a chromatin loop enclosing the Igf2 promoter region and effectively preventing transcription of
the gene from this allele. The paternal allele, however, features an interaction of DMR2 with the ICR, which places
the Igf2 promoter outside of the chromatin loop where
transcription activating factors are presumably available.
To date, no DMRs have been reported at marsupial IGF2
loci, nor has a marsupial ortholog of H19. To examine the
mechanism of genomic imprinting of the IGF2 locus in
marsupials we tested the necessity of CpG methylation for
mono-allelic expression of IGF2, performed 5' RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) to identify the site of
transcription initiation and promoter region of IGF2 and
assayed a 22 kilobase region surrounding this gene for
DMRs and MARs in neonatal tissues of Monodelphis domestica.

Results
5-azacytidine treatment of neonatal fibroblasts
Day 0 neonate fibroblast cells were treated with 5-azacytidine followed by RNA/DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to ascertain the affect of CpG
hypomethylation on the allelic expression profile of IGF2
in M. domestica. Both treated and control cells were subjected to RNA FISH to determine mono-vs biallelic expression status, followed by DNA FISH as an internal
hyrbidization control. Only those cells containing two
DNA FISH signals were scored for RNA FISH (Figure 1A–
C). Untreated neonate cells showed zero RNA signals in
11.1% of cells (Figure 1A), one RNA signal in 77.7% of
cells (Figure 1B), and two RNA signals in 11.1% of cells,
confirming the imprinted status of IGF2 (Figure 1D).
Cells treated with 5-azacytidine showed a significant (p <
0.001) shift to biallelic expression, with 14.3% of cells
containing no RNA signal, 10.7% containing one RNA
signal and 75% of cells containing 2 RNA FISH signals
(Figure 1C,D). We have previously shown that only the
paternal allele of IGF2 is transcriptionally active in neonatal opossums [4]. The detection of two RNA FISH signals
in treated neonatal fibroblasts, therefore, indicates that
the normally silent maternal allele has been activated by
the loss of cytosine methylation.
IGF2 transcription unit analysis
Slightly greater than 22 kilobases of DNA sequence
encompassing the M. domestica IGF2 gene was assembled
from sequencing of a 14 kb lambda clone and from sub-

cloning and sequencing regions of a BAC clone (223O16,
pCC1BAC) [19]. A northern blot of RNA extracted from
whole neonate tissue was hybridized to a cDNA probe
encompassing the protein coding portion of the M. domestica IGF2 gene. A single transcript of approximately 5 kb
was detected (data not shown). To determine the 5' extent
of the transcript and identify the promoter for the gene we
performed 5' RACE using oligonucleotide primers seated
in the first protein coding exon. 5' RACE of neonatal RNA
generated a single product that revealed a 95 base pair
non-coding exon situated ~5 kilobases upstream of the
start codon in the first protein coding exon of IGF2 (Figure
2A). In mouse and human, multiple transcripts for IGF2
have been detected with specific spatiotemporal expression profiles that result from differential promoter usage
and alternative splicing of noncoding exons upstream of
the three conserved protein coding exons. The single band
detected by northern analysis and the single 5' RACE
product, both from whole neonatal RNA, suggest that
opossum neonates express only one IGF2 transcript isotype from one promoter. The 5' flanking region of the
noncoding exon identified by 5' RACE was analyzed by
PROSCAN [20] and was predicted with high confidence
to be a promoter (promoter score = 73.63).
We next determined if features of the M. domestica IGF2
locus, including the region encompassing the 5' noncoding exon and the predicted promoter, show conservation
among marsupial clades and between marsupials and
eutherians. Pairwise alignments using a 100 base pair sliding window were performed in VISTA [21] utilizing the
genomic sequences of IGF2 from M. domestica, Macropus
eugenii (tammar wallaby) and Homo sapiens (Figure 2B,C).
Conservation was extremely high (>80%) between all
three species within the three protein coding exons. In
addition, a segment of approximately 600 base pairs,
encompassing the 5' noncoding exon and upstream flanking sequence showed >85% identity between opossum
and tammar wallaby and >50% identity between opossum and human. Didelphids (including Monodelphis and
Didelphis) and Macropodids (including Macropus) last
shared a common ancestor ~85 MYA, while estimates for
the most recent common ancestor for human and M.
domestica are ~145 MYA [1]. Given these deep phylogenetic branches, sequences containing high homology
between these disparate species may be indicative of functional conservation and represent potential targets for further epigenetic analyses.
CpG Methylation Analyses
Several CpG isochores and CpG enriched regions were
predicted within the assembled sequence contig using
CpG Plot [22]. A CpG enriched region was found
upstream and within the third coding exon (region VI,
Figure 2A) corresponding to DMR2 in mice, which is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/205

paternally methylated and known to be important in
maintaining high levels of transcription of Igf2 from the
paternal allele [16]. Bisulphite sequencing of this CpG
enriched region encompassing 750 base pairs in M. domestica revealed no differential methylation (Figure 3A).
No sequence cognates of mouse Igf2 DMR0 or DMR1
were identified. Nevertheless, bisulfite sequencing and
methylation-sensitive Southern analyses were performed
on the CpG enriched regions found upstream of the first
exon (regions I and II, Figure 3A,B), within the first intron
(region IV, Figure 3B) and flanking the second exon
(region V, Figure 3A). Like region VI, region V is fully
methylated on both alleles, while regions I, II and IV are
unmethylated on both alleles.
Region III includes the first exon and approximately 500
base pairs of its immediate 5' flank. Apart from the predicted promoter, this region is composed of extremely low
complexity DNA sequence: the upstream half of which is
comprised of interspersed strings of G's or A's two to six
bases in length, while the downstream half is comprised
of similarly short strings of C's and T's. The character of
the sequence in this region precludes both the ability to
design primers for bisulphite sequencing, which requires
high complexity sequence to compensate for the conversion of C's to U's by deamination, as well as the utilization
of methylation sensitive restriction enzymes for Southern
analysis to detect differential CpG methylation. Therefore,
we designed a methylation-sensitive restriction digest/
quantitative real-time PCR assay to examine select CpG
residues in the vicinity of the predicted promoter. The
quantitative real-time assay detects 50% methylation
(99.9% confidence limits) within Region III (Figure 3C).
Furthermore, the 50% methylation of Region III is lost
upon 5-azacytidine treatment of cells. Sequence polymorphisms that might distinguish parental copies of Region
III were not found among the available stocks of M.
domestica, therefore it is formally possible that the CpGs in
this region are randomly methylated. However, the precise 50% methylation (within 0.1% error) of Region III
despite full methylation or unmethylation of CpGs in surrounding regions, and the activation of the maternal allele
of IGF2 concurrent with the loss of methylation of Region
III in 5-azacytidine treated neonatal fibroblasts, strongly
suggest that Region III comprises an allele-specific DMR
essential to PSGE of IGF2 in opossums.
Matrix Attachment Regions
When sequence obtained from the 5' region of the M.
domestica IGF2 gene was input into the bioinformatics
program MAR-Wiz [23], a region within the first intron
just downstream of the 5' noncoding exon was predicted
to be a Matrix Attachment Region (92% average strength)
(Figure 2A). FISH using a 5 kilobase probe containing the

predicted MAR sequence showed two signals exclusively
in the nuclear matrix rather than in the loop region of
nuclear halos (Figure 4), confirming the presence of an
active MAR in the 5' region of this gene in opossum.

Discussion
Research published in the aftermath of the discovery of
genomic imprinting in marsupials found no evidence of
parent-specific CpG methylation at imprinted loci, the
hallmark of genomic imprinting in eutherians [6,8,11]. As
a consequence, there has been speculation that there has
been evolutionary divergence of imprinting mechanisms
between eutherians and marsupials, with differential CpG
methylation proposed as a eutherian innovation [24].
However, the observation that marsupials carry the genes
for both DNMT3L [10] and DNMT1o [25], both key factors in establishing and/or maintaining genomic imprints
in eutherians [26,27], suggested a role for CpG methylation in marsupial imprinting. Furthermore, recent investigation of the regulation of tammar wallaby PEG10
suggested that differential methylation in response to a
retrotransposition in the common ancestor to marsupials
and eutherians may constitute the mechanistic origin of
genomic imprinting in mammals [12]. Interesting in this
regard, the DMR in the opossum IGF2 promoter shows no
evidence of having been derived from a mobile element.
Prior efforts to find differential methylation at the IGF2
locus in opossum has likely been hampered by the fact
that this locus is highly enriched in low complexity polynucleotide repeats. This has made demarcation and local-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/205

ization of exons and assembly of long contiguous
sequence at the M. domestica IGF2 locus a difficult task.
Nevertheless, we have now shown that imprinted expression of IGF2 in opossum is dependent on CpG methylation and that sequences adjacent to the putative promoter
of this gene appear to be differentially methylated in a
parent-specific manner. Further comparative studies
between opossum and the tammar wallaby, including
promoter-reporter assays and allele-specific methylation
studies, may reveal conservation of these features among
Marsupialia.
The DMR at the promoter of IGF2 in opossum may be
analogous to the DMR1 just upstream of Igf2 promoter P1
in mouse. Imprinted expression of Igf2 in mesodermal tissues of the mouse embryo depends on the interaction of
DMR1 with the H19 DMD located ~45 kilobases downstream of Igf2 and 2–4 kilobases upstream of the H19
gene [13,28]. The absence of methylation on the maternal
copy of the H19 DMD allows for the binding of CTCF and
assembly of a chromatin insulator at that site [17]. Assembly of this insulator is indispensable to the transcriptional
silencing of the maternal IGF2 allele. Mouse embryos in
which the gene for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, has been knocked out by gene targeting
express H19 from both parental alleles while silencing
both alleles of Igf2 [29]. The activation of the maternal
allele of IGF2 in neonatal opossum cells in which differential methylation of the Region III DMR has been abolished by 5-azacytidine treatment suggests an important
divergence between marsupials and eutherians in the epi-

genetic regulation of IGF2 imprinting. To date, no report
of marsupial orthologs of H19 have been published.
Analysis of the distribution and function of matrix attachment regions (MARs) at the opossum IGF2 locus also
shows striking contrasts to the mouse Igf2 locus. MAR-wiz
analysis of 22 kilobases encompassing the M. domestica
IGF2 transcription unit only identified one MAR with
strong statistical support. Three MARs (MAR1, 2, 3) have
been identified in mouse and human that are conserved
in location with respect to IGF2 intron/exon structure.
Two of these, MAR2 and MAR3, show allele-specific
matrix attachment in mouse that varies by tissue and
developmental stage [14,30]. These MARs allow for longrange interactions between the Igf2 DMRs and the H19
DMD, creating a chromatin conformation that places the
Igf2 promoter inside DNA loops on the maternal allele to
prevent transcription, or forming a transcriptional complex on the paternal allele at the nuclear matrix
[13,14].The VISTA alignment of opossum and human
IGF2 suggests that the opossum MAR may play an analogous role to MAR1, which in mouse, like opossum, does
not show parental-allele specific matrix attachment.

Conclusion
The critical role of IGF2 signaling during vertebrate development, the imprinting of IGF2 and several genes modulating its activity in placental mammals [31], and the
demonstration of sustained Darwinian selection on IGF2
in placental fishes [32], places this gene at the crux of the
parent-offspring conflict that accompanies the adaptation
to placental reproduction. It is most parsimonious to
assume that genomic imprinting of IGF2 evolved in the
common ancestor of Eutheria and Marsupialia, and the
demonstration that imprinting relies on allele-specific
cytosine methylation in both supports this notion. However, we have shown that the epigenetic signals and chromatin conformation that govern imprinting at this locus
in opossum are dramatically different than that in mouse,
suggesting that the mechanism of transcriptional silencing of the maternal allele may have evolved independently in these two lineages.

were further disaggregated with a 1 mL syringe capped
with a 21G needle, transferred to flasks (25 cm2) and
grown to confluency at 35°C in complete marsupial
media. Optimal 5-azacytidine treatment recovery time
was determined empirically. Four flasks (25 cm2) with
cells at ~60% confluency were treated with 20 uM 5-azacytidine in complete marsupial media for 24 hours followed by 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of recovery, respectively.
DNA was isolated from each flask and 1 µg was digested
with HpaII overnight. The recovery time of 48 hours contained cells showing the greatest decrease in CpG methylation and was subsequently chosen for further analyses
(data not shown).
RNA FISH
Igf2 probe was derived from 5 kb of intronic sequence 5'
of the first noncoding exon. The subclone was generated
from M. domestica IGF2 BAC DNA clone # 223O16,
pCC1BAC [34] from the VMRC18 library (CHORI)
digested with EcoR I and Bgl II and ligated into pBluescript® KS+ (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA (1 µg) was labeled
with dig-11-dUTP using the Dig High Prime (Roche) Kit
for RNA FISH and with biotin-16-dUTP with the Biotin
High Prime (Roche) Kit for DNA FISH, both according to
manufacturer's instructions. Probe DNA was precipitated
with 10 µg salmon sperm DNA, 10 µg tRNA, 20 µg sonicated M. domestica genomic DNA and 2 volumes -20°C
ethanol for 30 minutes at -80°C. Following centrifugation
for 20 minutes, hybridization cocktail DNA was resuspended in 17 µl of 100% deionized formamide and 17 µl
2 X hybridization mix [35]. Hybridization cocktail DNA
was denatured at 70°C for 10 minutes and incubated at
37°C for 30 minutes to allow blocking of repeat
sequences in the probe DNA.

Cell Culture
Primary cultures of fibroblast cells were established from
(Day 0) neonates.

Day 0 neonate fibroblast cells were plated on a Dual
Chamber slide in DMEM media supplemented with 10%
FBS and non-essential amino acids overnight at 35°C.
Once the cells were at ~60% confluency, one of the two
wells for each slide was treated with 5-azacytidine (20
uM) for 24 hrs, while the control well was treated with
media alone. After 24 hours of treatment, both wells were
rinsed with PBS and treated with media for 48 hours of
recovery at 35°C. Following recovery, slides were processed in cytoskeletal buffer for 2.5 minutes, followed by
formaldehyde fixation and 2 × 70% ethanol rinses according to [36].

Neonate tissues were treated with 500 units Collagenase
type 3 (Worthington Biochemical), in 35 mm Petri dishes
containing complete marsupial media [33]. Tissues were
excised with a scalpel blade and incubated 18–24 hours at
37°C. Disaggregated cells were then transferred to 15 mL
Falcon tubes and centrifuged to collect cells and rinsed
with sterile PBS to remove remaining Collagenase. Cells

Following overnight hybridization at 37°C under a 22 ×
50 mm coverslip across both the treated and control wells,
slides were washed in 50%formamide/2 × SSC at 45°C for
3 washes of 5 minutes each followed by 1 × SSC (prewarmed to 60°C) at 45°C for 3 washes of 5 minutes each.
Detection using anti-dig-rhodamine was performed
according to [37]. Cells were counterstained with DAPI,

equipped with a DFC350FX CCD camera and analyzed on
a CW4000 Cytogenetics Image Analysis Workstation.
Once positive hybridization signals were visually confirmed, the slide was rinsed in PBS to remove the coverslip
and antifade solution and was subsequently processed for
DNA FISH. The slide was treated with RNAse A (0.1 mg/
mL RNAse A in 2 × SSC). Following chromosome denaturation in 70%formamide/2 × SSC at 70°C for 2 minutes
the slide was dehydrated in ice cold 70%, 90% and 100%
ethanol.
DNA FISH probe (1 µg biotin labeled DNA) was precipitated according to RNA FISH (above). The DNA FISH
hybridization cocktail was denatured and pre-annealed
and applied to the slide as above. FISH washes were performed as above followed by detection with anti-biotin
FITC Avidin Fluorescein (Vector Laboratories).
Hybridization signals were scored for a minimum of 25
cells per well [38]. Only cells containing two positive
DNA hybridization signals were scored for use in statistical analyses. Chi tests were performed to determine
whether the observed peak signal distribution of hybridization signals within the treated well was significantly different than the peak signal distribution of the control
sample.
Isolation and sequencing of M. domestica IGF2
A Monodelphis domestica genomic library constructed in
Lamda FIX®II/XhoI (Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's protocol) was screened using a probe generated
from amplification of genomic DNA from a male M.
domestica liver with primers designed from an alignment
of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of several species [4].
Subclones were generated by restriction digests with
BamH I, EcoR I, Not I, and Sac II and ligation into pBluescript® II KS+ vector (Stratagene). Additional sequence was
obtained by screening the VMRC-18 M. domestica
genomic library ordered from BACPAC Resources (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA)
using the same 3' UTR probe. BAC DNA was prepared
using a QIAGEN™ Plasmid Midi Kit following manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was accomplished by
primer walking using BigDye Chemistry (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacture's protocol. Regions
of repeats or secondary structure were subcloned after Pst
I digestion into pBluescript® KS+, then sequenced using
400 ng DNA, 2.3 µL of 5× buffer, 5% DMSO (final concentration), 1 M Betaine (final concentration), 2 µL
BigDye Terminator v3.1, dGTP BigDye Terminator v3.0
(Applied Biosystems), 3.2 picomoles primer, and MilliQ
water to 20 µL. The reaction was run for 30 cycles at 95°C
for 15 sec., 50°C for 5 sec., and 60°C for 2 min.

Detection of noncoding exons
The 5' untranslated exon sequence was captured by RACE
using the BD SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit. The
procedure was done as described by the manufacturer
using 1 ug of total RNA, a reverse gene specific primer (5':
GACGCTTGGCCTCTCTGAT) in the primary PCR, and a
reverse nested gene specific primer (5: CGGGGAATCTGGGGAAGTTGTCC). The resulting amplicon was cloned
into the pCR® II Topo® vector and sequenced.
Sequence analyses
The full 22 kb from M. domestica IGF2 and Macropus eugenii (BAC MEKBa-346C2, gi: CR925759) were analyzed in
VISTA [21] using a 100 bp sliding window. Sequence
identity greater than 70% over 100 bp was scored. The
homologous segment of human IGF2 (UCSC Genome
Browser: hsa chr11:2107400-2125903) was used in pairwise VISTA alignments to identify conserved portions
within a 100 bp sliding window with greater than 50%
identity.
Assessment of differential methylation
CpG islands were predicted by the program CpG Plot with
input analyzed using an observed/expected ratio of 0.6
and a window length of 200 bp [22]. Either bisulfite
sequencing or southern analysis was conducted on CpG
islands to evaluate the presence of differential methylation. Bisulfite sequencing was performed on neonate liver
DNA. Briefly, 4 µg of DNA extracted from a Day 0 neonate
was treated with bisulfite reagents using the EZ DNA
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) as per manufacturer's
instructions. Four microliters of treated DNA was then
amplified using 100 ng forward and reverse primers
designed in MethPrimer [34] (see Additional file 1) in a
35 cycle protocol consisting of 94°C for 1 min., 55°C for
30 sec., and 72°C for 30 sec. The PCR products were
ligated into pCR® II Topo® vector (Invitrogen) and multiple sublcones sequenced. Sequences were aligned with
Clustal X and analyzed in Meth Tools [39].

Two CpG islands (I and IV, Figure 2B) were not amenable
to primer design due to the presence of repeats, and were
thus analyzed by southern analyses. For CpG island I, 10
µg of genomic DNA was digested with PstI in conjunction
with either Msp I or Hpa II to allow for the detection of a
<1 kb band encompassing the boundary of this island.
The probe was generated by amplification of DNA from
forward (5': GCTTCATCGACTTCAGGCTG) and reverse
(5': CTCAGTGGGGAGCTCTCCA) primers. For CpG
island IV, 10 µg of genomic DNA from a Day 0 neonate
was digested with EcoR I and Xmn I in conjunction with
either Msp I or Hpa II to allow for the detection of a <1 kb
band encompassing the boundary of this island. The
probe was generated by amplification of DNA from forward (5': AAAGTCCGCAAGGGGATG) and reverse (5':

CCCCCTTCAGTCCTCTCTCT) primers. In both assays, a
shift, or lack thereof, in the size of the hybridizing fragments in the HpaII digests indicates the methylation status
of the respective targeted CpGs.
Quantitative PCR (QPCR) of the region just upstream of
the 5' noncoding exon (CpG island III) was performed
using Biorad Sybr Green on Biorad iCycler machine as
previously described [40]. Briefly, 2 µg genomic DNA isolated from non-treated and 5-azacytidine treated neonate
cells was digested overnight at 37°C in separate reactions
with either 40 Units of EcoRI (an enzyme targeting sites
outside of the PCR target region), HpaII (methylation sensitive) or MspI (methylation insensitive) and subsequently cleaned using Microcon YM-100s according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Primers spanning one CCGG
(HpaII/MspI) targeting the CpG island III (see Additional
file 1) amplified 50 ng of gDNA (undigested gDNA, EcoRI
digested gDNA, HpaII digested gDNA and MspI digested
gDNA) from either non-treated or 5-azacytidine treated
cells with the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 15
sec, 63°C for 45 seconds in 40 total cycles. EcoRI digested
DNA was analyzed by QPCR to verify there was no effect
on amplification efficiency due to post-digestion processing (data not shown). MspI digested DNA was analyzed by
QPCR to verify there was complete digestion of HpaII/
MspI sites regardless of methylation (no amplification
detected, data not shown). The reference PCR product targeted the first coding exon and contained no restriction
sites (see Additional file 1). Reactions were assembled in
triplicate and normalized against the reference as in [41].
Matrix attachment region fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH)
Sequence obtained from BAC and lambda clones were
input into the MAR-Wiz program v 1.5 [23] for analysis of
potential matrix attachment regions. Halo preparation
was performed by culturing fibroblast cells from M.
domestica day 0 neonates as above. Nuclear halos were
then prepared by the methods of [42] with the exception
that dehydration following halo formation consisted of
10%, 30%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol, and slides were
fixed in methanol/acetic-acid (3:1) for 1 hour, then baked
for 1 hour. The slide was treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL
in 2 × SSC) for 1 hour and denatured in 70% formamide/
2 × SSC at 70°C for 2 minutes prior to hybridization, then
serially dehydrated at -20°C in 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol and allowed to dry.

The in situ hybridization experiments were carried out
with prepared halos using the 5 kb sublcone as above.
Random priming with DIG-High Prime (Roche), DNA
FISH probe preparation, hybridization and post-hybridization washes were performed as above for RNA-DNA
FISH.
