Abstract
Background: Enterococci have emerged as the third most common cause of nosocomial infections, requiring
bactericidal antimicrobial therapy. Although vancomycin resistance is a major problem in clinics and has emerged
in an important extend in farm animals, few studies have examined it in wild animals. To determine the prevalence
of vanA-containing Enterococcus strains among faecal samples of Seagulls (Larus cachinnans) of Berlengas Natural
Reserve of Portugal, we developed a proteomic approach integrated with genomic data. The purpose was to
detect the maximum number of proteins that vary in different enterococci species which are thought to be
connected in some, as yet unknown, way to antibiotic resistance.
Results: From the 57 seagull samples, 54 faecal samples showed the presence of Enterococcus isolates (94.7%). For
the enterococci, E. faecium was the most prevalent species in seagulls (50%), followed by E. faecalis and E. durans
(10.4%), and E. hirae (6.3%). VanA-containing enterococcal strains were detected in 10.5% of the 57 seagull faecal
samples studied. Four of the vanA-containing enterococci were identified as E. faecium and two as E. durans. The
tet(M) gene was found in all five tetracycline-resistant vanA strains. The erm(B) gene was demonstrated in all six
erythromycin-resistant vanA strains. The hyl virulence gene was detected in all four vanA-containing E. faecium
isolates in this study, and two of them harboured the purK1 allele. In addition these strains also showed ampicillin
and ciprofoxacin resistance. The whole-cell proteomic profile of vanA-containing Enterococcus strains was applied
to evaluate the discriminatory power of this technique for their identification. The major differences among
species-specific profiles were found in the positions corresponding to 97-45 kDa. Sixty individualized protein spots
for each vanA isolate was identified and suitable for peptide mass fingerprinting measures by spectrometry
measuring (MALDI/TOF MS) and their identification through bioinformatic databases query. The proteins were
classified in different groups according to their biological function: protein biosynthesis, ATP synthesis, glycolysis,
conjugation and antibiotic resistance. Taking into account the origin of these strains and its relation to infectious
processes in humans and animals, it is important to explore the proteome of new strains which might serve as
protein biomarkers for biological activity.
Conclusions: The comprehensive description of proteins isolated from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium
and E. durans may provide new targets for development of antimicrobial agents. This knowledge may help to
identify new biomarkers of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors.

Background
Enterococcus spp. are commensal bacteria of the intestinal
microbiota of humans and animals but are now becoming
recognized as important causes of nosocomial, and to a
lesser extent, community acquired infections. Typical
enterococcal infections occur in hospitalized patients with
underlying conditions representing a wide spectrum of
severity of illness and immune modulation [1,2]. The
emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in
Europe has been associated with the use of avoparcin as
feed additive in food animals [3], until its ban in 1997 by
the European Union. There are reports on the presence of
VRE in farm animals in different countries [3-6], including
in Portugal, but studies dealing with the occurrence of
VRE in wild animals are limited [7,8]. For many years,
vancomycin was considered as the last resort when all
other classes of antibiotics failed. In the nineteen-eighties
plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among
enterococci was first demonstrated and since then occurrences of infection caused by VRE have increased dramatically. This situation causes several challenges, including
firstly the sole availability of expensive new antimicrobials
for therapy of VRE infections since most strains are also
resistance to multiple other economically acceptable drugs
in developing countries, e.g., aminoglycosides or ampicillin, and secondly the possibility that the vancomycin resistance genes present in VRE could be transferred to other
gram-positive microorganisms such as Staphylococcus
aureus [9]. On the other hand virulence factors have been
mainly detected in bacteria of the E. faecalis species, being
E. faecium generally free of these determinants [10]. Studies reporting the presence of virulence factors in enterococci of food and animal origin are few [10,11], and the
occurrence is not well documented in faecal enterococci
from wild animals [9,12,13]. Birds are sentinel species
whose plight serves as barometer of ecosystem health and
alert system for detecting global environmental ills. Harmful effects seen in wildlife can be useful ‘sentinel events’
warning us of potential hazards for humans. This calls for
integrated ecological and health hazard appraisals.
Frequently, these wild birds are often opportunistic marine
feeders along the shoreline or offshore, but also readily utilizing the food sources provided by humans, especially
garbage. Migrating birds that fly and travel long distance
seem to act as transporters, or as reservoirs, of resistant
bacteria and may consequently have a significant epidemiological role in the dissemination of resistance, as well
as being mirrors of the spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms present in humans. Of such migratory birds,
particularly dominant in our study were the seagulls.
A natural heritage of great environmental value, the
Berlengas archipelago, is situated about 10 km from the
Portugal Peniche coast. It comprises the Berlengas

Page 2 of 12

Grande Island and adjacent reefs. It has been classified
as a Natural Reserve since 1981. In an almost pure and
wild state, the archipelago is a rich habitat for many animals and plant species. The dominant local fauna consists mainly of sea birds. Nowadays, the archipelago has
no permanent human population and is only visited by
scientists and, in the summer, by a small number of
tourists. Visitors are required to respect the natural
environment and the species that inhabit the area.
Makeshift paths are marked with stones and park rangers watch out for visitors straying into the prohibited
areas, disturbing the birds and the wildlife of this
reserve. For these reasons, apparently, the seagulls are
not directly under antibiotic selective pressure in the
Berlengas.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of whole-cell
polypeptides solubilised by treatment with sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) has been used to identify and type bacteria
[14-16]. This technique allows the comparative study of
large numbers of proteins encoded by a significant portion
of the genome and, therefore, has a very high potential for
measuring relationships among isolates [15,17,18]. Over
the past decade numerous genomes of pathogenic bacteria
were fully sequenced and annotated, while others are continuously being sequenced and published. More recently
to understand the molecular mechanisms of bacteria resistance to glycopeptides, proteomic profiles of vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecalis V583 (reference strain) and
V309 (clinical isolate) were analysed [19]. Vancomycin
induced specifically and reversibly VanA, VanX, VanB,
and VanXB. Some of these proteins have known vancomycin resistance functions or are related to virulent factors,
stress, metabolism, translation, and conjunction, which
would help Enterococcus survive under drug selection.
The genetic characterization of antimicrobial resistance genes as well as their location and diversity is
important in identifying factors involved in resistance,
understanding the diversity of multi drug resistant
strains, identifying genetic linkages among markers,
understanding potential transfer mechanisms, and developing efficient detection methods. The aim of this study
was to analyse the prevalence of faecal carriage by
vanA-containing Enterococcus strains in seagulls (Larus
cachinnans) inhabiting the Berlengas archipelago, which
are a group of very small islands of the Portuguese coast
near to the city of Peniche. The islands are one of the
first protected areas in the world. Additionally esp and
hyl virulence factor genes were also investigated. Unlike
genome studies, investigations at the proteomic level
provide insights into protein abundance and/or posttranslational modifications and it is also one of the best
methods of investigating basic biological processes such
as pathogenesis, physiology, and metabolic mechanisms.

For these reasons the whole-cell protein (WCP) profiles
of vanA-containing Enterococcus strains was followed by
genotypic and proteome characterization of these bacteria. The goal was to demonstrate the usefulness of the
WCP profiling approach as a technique for identifying,
typing and studying the relationships between isolates.

Results
Phenotypic and genetic characterization of enterococci
isolates to antibiotic resistance

Additional file 1 shows the different antimicrobial resistance genotypes detected in the enterococci isolates
showing resistance to one or more antibiotic agents
recovered from seagulls. It demonstrates that the majority of the enterococci strains carried the combination tet
(M) + tet(L) and erm(B) genes. Different genomic profiles (17) were demonstrated in all of the enterococci
isolates. The most prevalent genotype included the tet
(M) + tet(L) + Tn916 + Tn5397 + erm(B) genes.
vanA-containing enterococcal strains were detected in
six of the 57 seagull samples (10.5%). Four of the vanAcontaining Enterococcus strains were identified as
E. durans, and two as E. faecium. The characteristics of
these strains and of the animals from which they were
recovered are shown in additional file 2. All vanA
strains showed high level vancomycin (MIC ≥128 mg/L),
and teicoplanin resistance (MIC 64 mg/L); most of them
showed resistance for tetracycline (n = 5), and all of
them for erythromycin. The tet(M) gene was found in
all five tetracycline-resistant vanA strains, in most of the
cases associated with tet(L) gene (additional file 2); the
erm(B) gene was demonstrated in all six erythromycinresistant vanA strains. Enterococci with intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanC-1 or vanC2-3 gene) were not
found. The esp gene was not detected among our isolates. The hyl virulence gene was detected in both
vanA-containing E. faecium isolates in this study (additional file 2), and they harboured the purK1 allele, and
in addition showed ampicillin and ciprofoxacin resistance. Additionally, the MLST typing of the two vanApositive E. faecium isolates demonstrated the ST5 type
(included in CC17 clonal complex).
One-dimensional electrophoresis

The enterococci isolates were displayed in the onedimensional gel electrophoresis based on the genotypic
profiles similarities. The SDS-PAGE of whole-cell
extracts of the 6 vanA-containing enterococci strains are
shown in Figure 1. Analysis of different strains by SDSPAGE gave reproducible whole-cell proteins patterns
which allowed differentiation between the species
included in this study (Ed for E. durans and Ef for
E. faecium). The major differences between these two
species were identified in the 97-45 kDa region. The

Page 3 of 12

four E. durans strains studied presented two different
genomic patterns (tet(M)-tet(L)-erm(B) and tet(M)-tet
(L)-erm(B)-hyl), were traduced into three different protein profiles. This picture reveals the higher complexity
of the proteome when compared with the static genome
screened by PCR. Similar antibiotic resistance had similar protein profiles for E. durans (SG 1 and SG 2)
(Figure 1, Lanes 2 and 3) but shows evident differences
when compared strains SG3 and SG56, both identified
as E. durans (Figure 1, Lanes 4 and 5). Although these
two strains show the same genotypic pattern (tet(M)-tet
(L)-erm(B)-hyl) presents very clear differences between
protein bands (1-4 in contrast to 5-6). Differences
revealed by SDS-PAGE for the two E. faecium strains
characterised which have differences in tetracycline
gene, SG 41 (erm(B)-hyl) and S-G 50 (tet(M)-tet(L)-erm
(B)-hyl) were represented by three different bands (7-9).
Two-dimensional Electrophoresis

A comparative analysis among the strains has been carried out. The protein expressions of the two vancomycin-containing enterococci (vanA E. faecium SG 41 and
vanA E. durans SG 3) strains were visualized on 2-DE
gels (Figures 2 and 3). The use of pH 4-7 IPG strips
resulted in a well spread protein spots display which
contributed to an accurate and safe excision and image
identification of the spots. For each sample SG 3 and
SG 41, a total of 60 relevant protein spots were collected
for their analysis using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
The peptide mass peaks were compared with those in
the NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, and
the protein identification data including genebank ID,
MW, PI value, mascot score, number of matched peptides and sequence coverage ratio (%) are listed in additional file 3 for and vanA E. durans SG 3 and additional
file 4 for the vanA E. faecium SG 41 proteins. The identified proteins were showing diverse functional activities
including glycolysis, conjugation, translation, protein
biosynthesis, among others (Figures 4 and 5). Replicate
sequences, truncated sequences, and sequences with
partial alignments were removed from the BLAST
results (not shown). From the collected sequences were
selected to represent the initial tree. These sequences
were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed
by the minimum-evolution method to root the tree. The
clustering of the initial phylogenetic tree indicated that
all of the proteins included in the data set diverged
from a common ancestor (Figure 6).

Discussion
Unlike the genome, the proteome is dynamic: it varies
according to the cell type and the functional state of the
cell. In addition, the proteome shows characteristic perturbations in response to disease and external stimuli

[20]. Nevertheless three different bands were observed
(7 until 9) which can represent hypothetic correlation
with differences in genomic data. The molecular weight
of these bands is similar to those obtained from the
2-DE separations, which identify nine proteins associated with resistance to tetracycline [21]. The esp gene,
that encodes an enterococcal surface protein associated
with the ability to biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces
[10], is more frequently found in clinical isolates [22],
and this fact could explain the absence of detection
among the commensal isolates analysed in this study.
The wide dissemination of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates of the epidemic-virulent clonal complex-17
(CC17), which harbour the purK1 allele, and are very
frequently associated with ampicillin and ciprofloxacin

resistance, and also with the presence of esp and hyl
virulence genes has been reported [23-26]. Two of our
isolates present most of these characteristics (although
do not harbour esp gene).
In our study of the identified proteins, it is important
to point out the presence of vancomycin/teicoplanin
A-type resistance protein vanA in vanA-E. durans SG 3
isolate. It has therefore been postulated that resistant
cells produce peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in
the depsipeptide D-alanine-2-D-hydroxy acid rather
than the dipeptide D-alanine-D-alanine, thus preventing
vancomycin binding [27]. Vancomycin-dependence
results from a mutation that inactivates the D-Ala:
D-Ala ligase gene (ddl) in the chromosome, so that the
mutant strain no longer produces D-Ala: D-Ala-ending

peptidoglycan precursors. Thus, cell wall synthesis in the
mutant strain is dependent on the production of alternative peptidoglycan precursors. The D-Ala: D-Lac
ligase activity of vanA and vanB can replace ddl activity
by production of D-Ala: D-Lac-ending peptidoglycan
precursors instead of the native D-Ala: D-Ala-ending
precursors. As both resistances are inducible with vancomycin, the production of alternate precursors requires
the presence of vancomycin and the mutant strain
becomes vancomycin-dependent for growth [28]. It is
interesting to find the ddl protein in vanA E. durans
isolate from faecal sample of seagulls because since
E. faecalis and E. faecium represent more than 95% of
the clinical isolates collected, identification of enterococci based on the amplification of a fragment internal
to the ddl gene encoding a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase included
only these two species [29].
In vanA E. faecium SG 41 isolate it is notice to indicate the presence of D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase that
hydrolyzes D-Ala-D-Ala, thereby preventing vancomycin

binding. The unstability of depsipeptide could also make
VanY, a D-, D-carboxypeptidase in the van gene cluster
which could participate to vancomycin resistance by
removing D-Ala residue from C-terminus of peptidoglycan [30], functionally unnecessary for high-level vancomycin resistance in E. faecium isolate.
From a total of 60 protein spots identified in vanA
E. durans SG 3 isolate, 5 proteins were found as related
to stress response. Chaperone protein dnaK was
detected and shows to be involved in the stress response
mechanism for heat, a very important reaction for the
survival of bacteria such as enterococci and that contributes for the antibiotic resistance capability [31]. The
protein dnaK was detected in spot 20 as linked to two
E. coli serotype 0157:H7 strains (accession number
P0A6Z0 and A6T4F4), one Citrobacter koseri strain
(A8ALU3), one Enterobacter sakazakii strain (A7MIK5)
and one Salmonella choleraesuis strain (Q57TP3). In the
spot 21 was found the protein 60 kDa chaperonin
(groL) in the vanA E. durans SG 3 isolate related to

Enterococcus faecalis (Q93EU6) and Streptococcus constellatus (Q8KJ18). The protein groL was also present in
the spot 10 of the vanA E. faecium SG 41 isolate. This
protein prevents misfolding and promotes the refolding
and proper assembly of unfolded polypeptides generated
under stress conditions [32,33].
The D-alanine-D-alanine ligase protein (A3PEE0) was
also found in this isolate (SG 41) as being related with
Prochlorococcus marinus, where it is involved in the cell
wall biogenesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis [34]. It is
important to highlight the presence in the vanA E. durans SG 3 isolate of the wrbA flavoprotein (B7UNY7 and
B5YU47) related to two enterhemorrhagic E. coli strains
(Escherichia coli O127:H6 and Escherichia coli O157:H7,
respectively). WrbA (tryptophan [W] repressor-binding
protein) was discovered in Escherichia coli, where it was
proposed to play a role in regulation of the tryptophan
operon. This protein seems to improve the formation
and/or stability of noncovalent complexes between the
trp repressor protein and operator-bearing DNA [35,36].
This wrbA flavoprotein was also detected in E. coli
C580 isolated from faecal sample of human by our
investigation group and shows the partage of different
sequences among different bacteria [37].
Our results clearly show that electrophoretic methods
can provide valuable epidemiological information that
may be used to isolate and characterize Enterococcus
spp. The results are in accordance with previous results
of Wang et al. [19] that demonstrated that many proteins involved in antibiotic resistance were differentially
regulated by vanomycin which also triggered innate signal regulators, adhesion factors, and metabolic gene
expression in E. faecalis. Therefore, these responses
may enable Enterococcus spp. to adapt, survive, and
remain pathogenic even under pressure of vancomycin
treatment.

Conclusions
This work, albeit preliminary in nature, reveals the
complexity of expressed proteins in bacteria or different species and profiles of antibiotic resistance. SDSPAGE patterns can be obtained easily and rapidly, are
reproducible and do not require any sophisticated
equipment and expensive reagents. Although protein
profiles also represent phenotypic characteristics, they
are considered to provide an excellent approximation
of a microorganism’s genome information. In addition,
their extractability, sequence homology, and post
translational modifications (PTMs) make proteomic
analysis complex and informative. Proteomic methodologies contribute towards determining antimicrobial
resistance mechanism(s) through the capacity to analysis global changes of bacteria. The totality of proteins
identified in the present work are not necessarily
related with antibiotics, hence the importance of 2DE.
Epidemiological studies in different animals should be
continued in the future to elucidate the evolution of
vanA enterococcal and enterococci strains in different
ecosystems. The complete sequencing and comparative
proteome of some of these strains were isolated for the
first time in this wild population of seagulls as well as
the recognition of these proteins as markers in antibiotic resistance mechanisms. This biochemical and genomic foundation coupled to the parallel improvements
of proteomic procedures enabled us to study vanAenterococci proteome. This now provides a sound
basis for a comprehensive understanding of adaptability to environment and pathogenicity mechanisms.
This work reports the impact of proteomics on our
knowledge of van-A enterococci strains.
To our knowledge, this study is the first report which
identifies candidate proteins related in antibiotic resistance and involved in the general stress response in

vanA- containing Enterococcus faecium and durans species. Therefore, our results may reflect the expression of
a few membrane proteins involved in antibiotic resistance. Correlation with web databases allowed the exact
identification and characterization of the proteins present as well as their functions and relations within
known biological processes occurring at the cellular
level in enterococci. Proteomics and protein identification by 2-DE correlated with MALDI/TOF-TOF and
bioinformatic databases are expected to become increasingly essential in elucidating the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

Materials and methods
Samples and bacteria

The presence of faecal VRE was investigated in 57 faecal
samples recovered from seagulls of Berlengas islands.
Faecal samples of seagulls were recovered in the soil
along the entire Berlengas Island during September of
2007 and they were tested for the presence of vanAcontaining Enterococcus isolates.
Faecal samples were diluted and sampled in SlanetzBartley agar plates, incubated 48 h at 35°C, and two different colonies were isolated but only a single isolate of
each species was included. Colonies with typical enterococcal morphology were identified to the genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram’s strain,
catalase test, bile-aesculin reaction and by biochemical
tests using the API ID20 Strep system (BioMérieux). Species identification was confirmed by PCR using primers

aminoglycosides was considered in the susceptibility of
our enterococci. E. faecalis strain ATCC29212 and Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC29213 were used for
quality control.
Antimicrobial resistance genes

Vancomycin resistance genes (vanA, vanB, vanC-1,
vanC-2/3 and vanD) were tested by PCR in all vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains, and positive amplicons
were sequenced (Torres et al., 2003). Resistance genes for
other antibiotics, including tet(M), tet(L), erm(A), erm(B),
erm(C), were analysed by PCR [6]. The presence of esp
and hyl virulence factor genes was tested by PCR in all
isolates, using primers and conditions previously
described [23], and the purK allele type was investigated
by PCR and sequencing in all E. faecium isolates. Positive
and negative controls were included in all analyses and
the bacteria come from the collection of the University of
Rioja (Spain). The specific gene harboured by the positive
controls used in this study had previously been confirmed by sequencing, in all the cases.
MLST typing

E. faecium vanA isolates were characterized by Multilocus
Sequence Typing (MLST). For this purpose, internal 400to 600-bp fragments of seven housekeeping genes (adk,
atpA, ddl, gdh, gyd, purK and pstS) were amplified and
sequenced. The sequences obtained were analysed and
compared with the database http://www.mlst.net. The
combination of the seven obtained alleles for each isolate,
give us a specific sequence type (ST) and clonal complex
(CC) [39].

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antibiotic susceptibility was tested for 11 antibiotics of
interest in animal and human medicine (μmug/disk):
vancomycin (30), teicoplanin (30), ampicillin (10), streptomycin (300), gentamicin (120), kanamycin (120), chloramphenicol (30), tetracycline (30), erythromycin (15),
quinupristin-dalfopristin (15), and ciprofloxacin, (5), by
the disk diffusion method [38]. Antibiotic disks were
obtained from Oxoid (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK), with
the exception of aminoglycoside disks that were prepared
in the laboratory. Minimal inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of vancomycin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
and teicoplanin (Hoeschst Marion Roussell, Paris,
France) were determined by the agar dilution method
according to the CLSI (CLSI 2007). Serial two-fold dilutions were tested for antibiotic MIC determinations
(from 0.25 μmug/ml to 64 μmug/ml). The breakpoints
for resistance were the following ones: vancomycin or teicoplanin, ≥32 μmug/ml (a MIC of 8-16 μmug/ml of vancomycin or 16 μmug/ml of teicoplanin was considered as
intermediate susceptibility). Only high-level resistance to

Protein extraction

Frozen vanA-containing Enterococcus cell stocks were
streaked onto Luria-Bertani (LB) plates and grown at
37°C. Single colonies of vanA-containing Enterococcus
strains were conducted in 250 mL of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 4 gL-1 of glucose in covered
1 L Erlenmeyer flasks at 37°C. Cells were harvested
from the exponential phase in all experiments. The cells
were pelleted down at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 3 min. The
pellet should be visible after spinning and resuspended
in an equal volume of pre-warmed phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) pH 7.4 [40]. After new centrifugation pellet
was suspended in 0.2 ml of SDS sample solubilization
buffer. The sample was sonicated with an ultrasonic
homogenizer. The disrupted cells were centrifuged in an
Eppendorf microfuge at maximum speed (14,000g) for
30 minutes at 4°C. For SDS-PAGE experiment the
supernatant was collected and resuspended in an equal
volume of buffer containing 0.5 M Tris HCl pH 8.0,
glycerol, SDS and bromophenol blue.

One-dimensional electrophoresis and coloration

One-dimensional electrophoresis was conducted on vertical gel with SDS-polyacrylamide gels (T = 12.52%, C =
0.97%) in a Hoefer™SE 600 Ruby® (Amersham Biosciences) unit, following Laemmli [41] with some specific
modifications [42]. Electrophoresis was carried out with
a constant current of 30 mA per gel until the dye-front
reached the bottom of the gels which were stained with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 during 24 hours and
washed in water overnight. It was then fixated in trichloroacetic acid 6% for four hours and in glycerol 5%
for two hours [43]. Reproducibility of the SDS-PAGE
technique for enterococci characterization was confirmed by the analysis of triplicate protein extracts in
which cells grown independently had similar banding
patterns.

buffer, blotted to remove excessive buffer, and then
applied onto a 12.52% polyacrylamide gels in a
Hoefer™SE 600 Ruby® (Amersham Biosciences) unit.
Some modifications were introduced in the SDS-PAGE
technique previously reported by Laemmli [41], that
allowed its resolution to be increased, with proper insertion of the IPG strips in the stacking gel [41,42]. After
SDS-PAGE, the 2-DE gels were fixated in 40% methanol/10% acetic acid for one hour and afterwards stained
overnight in Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 [40].
Coomassie-stained gels were scanned on a flatbed scanner (Umax PowerLook 1100; Fremont, CA, USA), and
the resulting digitized images were analyzed using
Image Master 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences; GE
Healthcare).
Protein identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF

Two-dimensional electrophoresis and proteomics

2-DE was performed according to the principles of
O’Farrell [44] but with IPG (Immobiline™pH Gradient)
technology [45]. Protein samples of vanA E. durans isolate [SG 3 VRE] were used in parallel with those vanA
E. durans isolate [SG 41 VRE] proteins. For IEF, precast
IPG strips with linear gradient of pH 4-7 were passively
rehydrated overnight (12 to 16 hours) in a reswelling
tray with rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 1% CHAPS,
0.4% DTT, 0.5% carrier ampholyte IPG buffer pH 3-10)
at room temperature IPG strips were covered with DryStrip Cover Fluid (Plus One, Amersham Biosciences).
Lyses buffer [9.5 M urea, 1% (w/v) DTT, 2% (w/v)
CHAPS, 2% (v/v) carrier ampholytes (pH 3-10) and 10
mM Pefabloc® proteinase inhibitor] was added to the
two vanA-containing enterococci isolates (1:1). Samples
containing a total of 100 μg of protein were loaded into
13 cm IPG strips (pH 4-7 NL, Amersham Biosciences,
UK) [43]. The sample solution was then applied in the
previously rehydrated IPG strips pH4-7 by cup loading
and then proteins were focused sequentially at 500 V
for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, 8000 V for 2 h 30 and finally
8000 V incremented to 12505 V/h on an Ettan™IPGPhor
II™(Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Seven IEF
replicate runs were performed according to Görg [45]
and the GE Healthcare protocol for IPG strips pH 4-7
of 13 cm, in order to obtain the optimized running conditions, resulting in a final 5 h 25 hour run. Focused
IPG strips were then stored at -80°C in plastic bags.
Before running the second dimension, strips were equilibrated twice 15 minutes in equilibration buffer (6 M
urea, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS in 0.05 M TrisHCl buffer (pH 8.8)). In the first equilibration it was
added 1% DTT to the original equilibration buffer and
to the second 4% iodoacetamide, and also bromophenol
blue was added to both solutions. The equilibrated IPG
strips were gently rinsed with SDS electrophoresis

Spots of expression in all gels were manually excised
from the gels and analyzed using Matrix-Assisted Laser
Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The gel pieces were washed three
times with 25 mM ammonium bicabornate/50% ACN,
one time with ACN and dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo
Savant). 25 mL of 10 mg/mL sequence grade modified
porcine trypsin (Promega) in 25 mM ammonium bicabornate was added to the dried gel pieces and the samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Extraction of
tryptic peptides was performed by addition of 10% of
formic acid (FA)/50% ACN three times being lyophilised
in a SpeedVac (Thermo Savant). Tryptic peptides were
ressuspended in 10 mL of a 50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid solution. The samples were mixed (1:1) with a
matrix consisting of a saturated solution of a-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid prepared in 50% acetonitrile/0.1%
formic acid. Aliquots of samples (0.5 μL) were spotted
onto the MALDI sample target plate.
Peptide mass spectra were obtained on a MALDITOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4800 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Europe) in the positive ion
reflector mode. Spectra were obtained in the mass range
between 800 and 4500 Da with ca. 1500 laser shots. For
each sample spot, a data dependent acquisition method
was created to select the six most intense peaks, excluding those from the matrix, trypsin autolysis, or acrylamide peaks, for subsequent MS/MS data acquisition.
Mass spectra were internally calibrated with autodigest
peaks of trypsin (MH+: 842.5, 2211.42 Da) allowing a
mass accuracy of better than 25 ppm.
Database search

Spectra were processed and analyzed by the Global Protein Server Workstation (Applied Biosystems), which
uses internal MASCOT software (v 2.1.04, Matrix
Science, London, UK) on searching the peptide mass

Radhouani et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:48
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/48

fingerprints and MS/MS data. Swiss-Prot nonredundant
protein sequence database was used for all searches
under Enterococcus. Database search parameters as follows: carbamidomethylation and propionamide of
cysteine (+71Da) as a variable modification as well as
oxidation of methionine (+16Da), and the allowance for
up to two missed tryptic cleavages. The peptide mass
tolerance was 25 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance
was 0.3 Da. Protein identifications were considered as
reliable when the MASCOT score was > 70 (MASCOT
score was calculated as − 10 × log P, where P is the
probability that the observed match is a random event.).
This is the lowest score indicated by the program as significant (P < 0.05) and indicated by the probability of
incorrect protein identification.
Sequence alignments and construction of the
phylogenetic tree

The analysis was performed on the Phylogeny.fr platform
and comprised the following different steps. Sequences
were aligned with MUSCLE (v3.7) configured for highest
accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings). The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML program (v3.0
aLRT). The JTT substitution model was selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites (of 0.000)
and 4 gamma-distributed rate categories to account for
rate heterogeneity across sites. The gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data (gamma =
12.476). Reliability for internal branch was assessed using
the aLRT test (SH-Like). Graphical representation of the
phylogenetic tree (phenogram) was performed with
Drawgram from the PHYLIP package (v3.66).
