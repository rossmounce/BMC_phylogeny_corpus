Abstract
Computational analysis of eukaryotic promoters is one of the most difficult problems in
computational genomics and is essential for understanding gene expression profiles and reverseengineering gene regulation network circuits. Here I give a basic introduction of the problem and
recent update on both experimental and computational approaches. More details may be found in
the extended references. This review is based on a summer lecture given at Max Planck Institute
at Berlin in 2005.

Background
The promoter of a gene is defined as the cis-regulatory
DNA region at a specific location (the transcription start
site, or TSS) that can drive the transcription of its target
gene in response to environmental signals. Computationally, it is often conveniently divided into three regions: the
core-promoter (~80–100 bp surrounding the TSS), the
proximal-promoter (~250–1000 bp upstream of the corepromoter) and the distal-promoter (further upstream,
normally excluding enhancer or other regulatory regions
whose influences are position/orientation independent).
The core-promoter is minimally required for the assembly
of the preinitiation complex (PIC) and can drive a
reporter gene at a basal level from the TSS. The proximalpromoter often contains major cis-regulatory elements for
driving activated reporter gene expression with some tissue-specificity. However, the distal-promoter together
with distal enhancers/silencers and insulators are often
necessary for accurately reproducing the endogenous gene
expression patterns in vivo, especially for early developmental genes. Distal cis-regulatory elements also occur in
the introns and the downstream regions, and therefore
computational studies of these regions have been difficult
and often limited to only the conserved sub-regions and/
or regions in which functional cis-regulatory elements
form clusters. Most of our work has been focused on 1 kb
proximal-promoters (defined as -700 to +300 with respect
to the TSS). We have shown that DNA motifs in this
region can predict tissue-specific gene expression [1].
Computational promoter analyses usually face two

related problems: the localization of the core-promoter
(TSS prediction) and the identification of cis-regulatory
elements (motif discovery). Basic computational methods
have been reviewed previously [2], here I emphasize some
recent developments.

Results
New experimental developments
One recent surprise, revealed after more detailed biochemistry studies of promoter activation, is that people
have underestimated the diversity and complexity of corepromoter architecture and regulation. I refer readers to the
recent comprehensive review on "the general transcription machinery and general cofactors" [3].

Although several core-promoter elements have been identified (Figure 1), with each element being short and
degenerate and not every element occurring in a given
core-promoter, the combinatorial regulatory code within
core-promoters remains elusive. Their predictive value has
also been very limited, despite some weak statistical correlations among certain subsets of the elements which were
uncovered recently [4,5]. Further biochemical characterization of core-promoter binding factors under various
functional conditions is necessary before a reliable computational classification of core-promoters becomes possible. An example of the type of question that must be
answered is how CK2 phosphorylation of TAF1 may
switch TFIID binding specificity from a DCE to DPE function [6] (Figure 1).

The most significant advance comes from the new
sequencing and microarray technologies that, for the first
time, can provide ample and accurate 5'UTR sequence and
core-promoter/TFBS location data. In particular, largescale 5'RACE technology at Tokyo University and 5'CAGE
tag technology at Riken have provided DBTSS (Database
of Transcriptional Start Sites, mainly human) [7] and Fantom (Functional Annotation of Mouse) [8,9] with an
order of magnitude more promoter sequences derived
from full-length 5'UTRs/cDNAs than were present in the
traditional part of EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database)
[10]. These sequences serve as the best training data for all
current computational studies in promoter recognition.
Many of the surprising new statistical features of the corepromoter have come from the recent analyses of such data
(see [11] for a nice updated summary). One particularly
interesting point made in this reference is that "Contrary
to expectations, only a small fraction of RNAP II promoters appear to contain a TATA box. In contrast, a large pro-

portion of RNAP II promoters in metazoan genomes
appear to contain an INR element. Finally, about 25% of
human promoters appear to lack known core promoter
elements. This may point to the existence of additional
core promoter sequence elements that remain to be identified and functionally characterized.". More mammalian
promoter statistics are discussed in [12] which presents a
comprehensive study of Fantom3 data.
In addition to sequence data, ChIP-chip technologies (e.g.
see review [13]) provide genome-wide in vivo mapping of
protein-DNA binding regions which provide the best
experimental data for all current computational studies in
cis-regulatory motif discovery. Most of the important data
for promoter prediction has come from the ChIP-chip
localization of PIC at active core-promoters in the whole
genome at sub-100 bp resolution [14]. When more such
data are produced for different tissues/cells and development stages, it will transform the field of computational

promoter prediction and genome regulation networks
(further discussed below).
Advances in motif discovery
The traditional approach for finding cis-elements is to collect a set of (target gene) promoter sequences believed to
be enriched by some common TFBS motifs. They may
either be collected from the literature or from systematic
experiments (such as SELEX, etc.). There are many de novo
TFBS motif finding algorithms available. For a recent
review on computational TFBS finding methods, see e.g.,
[15]. For a recent benchmark of some popular motif finders, see [16]. In addition to the classical alignment-based
motif finding algorithms, such as CONSENSUS [17], EM
[18]/MEME [19] and the Gibbs sampler [20] which have
been reviewed previously [21], most modern approaches
have tried to extend either to the discovery of motif combinations (called cis-regulatory modules or CRMs), the
use of evolutionary conservation information (with either
phylogenetic footprinting or shadowing approaches), or a
combination of both approaches. One can also increase
specificity by incorporating structural information, for
example, if the protein binds as a homodimer, one could
restrict the search to only the palindromic motifs.

first successful motif selection algorithm based on linear
regression [30]. It has now been generalized to include
cross-interaction terms [31], to use nucleotide weight
matrices discovered by MDscan (Motif Regressor [32]), to
apply logistic regression [33] and to a nonlinear model
based on regression trees called MARSMotif [34,35]. The
matrix version of REDUCE (called MatrixREDUCE [36])
and of MARSMotif (called MARSMotif-M [37]) are
becoming important motif discovery tools for mammalian promoter analyses. Almost all the tools developed for
analyzing expression microarray data can also be easily
applied to the analysis of localization data, such as ChIPchip data. Although ChIP-chip is a global measurement
for in vivo binding of proteins to chromatin DNA and
hence is potentially capable of revealing direct target
genes (most targets identified in expression arrays are not
direct targets); due to the current resolution and to nonspecific or non-functional cross-links, not all putative targets are functional or possess functional cis-elements.
ChIP-chip data have also been used to further refine
motifs found by expression data (e.g. using a boosting
approach [38]).

More powerful and flexible motif finders can take the
advantage of a separate sequence set called a background
set, serving as a negative control. The goal is to search only
for motifs that are most discriminating, i.e. only those
enriched in the foreground set relative to the background
set. Examples of such motif finders, called discriminant
motif finders, include: ANN-Spec [22], DMOTIFS [23],
DWE [24] and DME [25]. DME is particularly novel and
powerful; it can enumerate all possible (discretized)
weight matrices above user-defined minimum information content. A newer version (called DME-B [26]) of
DME can optimize the classification ability of the identified motifs based on whether or not the sequence contains
at least one occurrence of the motif. This technology has
been used to systematically catalog of mammalian tissuespecific TFBS motifs [27,28].

Better promoter prediction
A number of statistical and machine learning approaches
that can discriminate between the known promoter and
some non-promoter sequences have been applied to TSS
prediction. In a recent large scale comparison [39], eight
prediction algorithms were compared. Among the most
successful algorithms were Eponine [40] (which trains
Relevant Vector Machines to recognize a TATA-box motif
in a G+C rich domain and uses Monte Carlo sampling),
McPromoter [41] (based on Neural Networks, interpolated Markov models and physical properties of promoter
regions), FirstEF [42] (based on quadratic discriminant
analysis of promoters, first exons and the first donor site)
and DragonGSF [43,39] (based on artificial neural networks). However, DragonGSF is not publicly available
and uses additional binding site information based on the
TRANSFAC database [44], exploiting specific information
that is typically not available for unknown promoters.

The most powerful generalization of this idea would be to
turn motif finding into a feature selection problem in
regression analysis by asking what is the set of features X
(some functions of the motifs or CRMs) that can best
explain the microarray data Y (e.g. expression scores). This
is very similar to the general problem in genetics: Y represents the phenotype (mRNA expression) and X represents
the genotype (promoter DNA elements). One would like
to learn a model (function f) so that f(X) can best predict
Y. When "best" is measured by the average squared error
based on the distribution Pr(X, Y), the solution is the conditional expectation (also known as the regression function, see, e.g. [29]): f(X) = E (Y| X = x). REDUCE was the

Two new de novo promoter prediction algorithms have
emerged that further improve in accuracy. One is ARTS
[45], which is based on Support Vector Machines with
multiple sophisticated sequence kernels. It claims to find
about 35% true positives at a false positive rate of 1/1000,
where the above mentioned methods find only about half
as many true positives (18%). ARTS uses only downstream genic sequences as the negative set (non-promoters), and therefore it may get more false-positives from
upstream non-genic regions. Furthermore, ARTS does not
distinquish if a promoter is CpG-island related or not and
it is not clear how ARTS may peform on non-CpG-island
related promoters. Another novel TSS prediction algo-

rithm is CoreBoost [46] which is based on simple LogitBoosting with stumps. It has a false positive rate of 1/5000
at the same sensitivity level (Zhao, personal communication). CoreBoost uses both immediate upstream and
downstream fragments as negative sets and trains separate
classifiers for each before combining the two. The training
sample is 300 bp fragments (-250, +50), hence it is more
localized than ARTS which has training sample of 2 kb
fragments (-1 kb, +1 kb). The ideal application of TSS prediction algorithms is to combine them with gene prediction algorithms [21] and/or with the ChIP-chip PIC
mapping data [14].

Future direction: epigenetics and chromatin
states
Although much progress has been made in promoter prediction and cis-regulatory motif discovery, false-positives
are still the main problem when scanning through the
whole genome. Fundamentally this is because the information about chromatin structure is still missing in all
our models! Protein-DNA binding specificity is partly
determined by the energetics and partly determined by
"entropy", which depends on how much of the genome is
accessible to the DNA binding protein [47] Without
knowing which regions of chromatin are open or closed
(and to what degree), researchers have to assume the
whole genome is accessible for binding, which is obviously wrong and will lead to more false positives (and
false negatives because of the extra noise). This is clearly
shown by recent genome-wide ChIP-chip data as well as
DNase I Hypersensitivity mapping data. There is a necessity for higher order prediction algorithms that are capable of predicting chromatin states based upon, perhaps,
genome-wide epigenetic measurements, CpG-islands and
repeat characteristics in addition to genomic sequences. It
is fortunate that such kinds of data are rapidly being generated [48-54] and the corresponding analysis tools [5557] are also coming along. The days of more realistic
dynamic modeling of chromatin structure and its relation
to expression and regulation are finally coming.
