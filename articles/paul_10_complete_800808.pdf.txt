Abstract
Background: Oligotropha carboxidovorans OM5 T. (DSM 1227, ATCC 49405) is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium
capable of utilizing CO (carbon monoxide) and fixing CO2 (carbon dioxide). We previously published the draft
genome of this organism and recently submitted the complete genome sequence to GenBank.
Results: The genome sequence of the chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans OM5 consists
of a 3.74-Mb chromosome and a 133-kb megaplasmid that contains the genes responsible for utilization of carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. To our knowledge, this strain is the first one to be sequenced in the
genus Oligotropha, the closest fully sequenced relatives being Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi and USDA110 and
Nitrobacter hamburgiensis X14. Analysis of the O. carboxidovorans genome reveals potential links between plasmidencoded chemolithoautotrophy and chromosomally-encoded lipid metabolism. Comparative analysis of
O. carboxidovorans with closely related species revealed differences in metabolic pathways, particularly in
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as transport pathways.
Conclusion: Oligotropha, Bradyrhizobium sp and Nitrobacter hamburgiensis X14 are phylogenetically proximal.
Although there is significant conservation of genome organization between the species, there are major
differences in many metabolic pathways that reflect the adaptive strategies unique to each species.

Background
OM5, the type strain of the gram-negative bacterium
Oligotropha carboxidovorans [1,2] (originally called
Pseudomonas carboxidovorans), was isolated from soil of
waste water sewage treatment settling ponds. OM5 is
capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth on CO, CO2,
and H2 [3-5] and can utilize chemoorganoheterotrophic
substrates under aerobic conditions, including the salts
of pyruvate, formate, glyoxylate, lactate, ascorbate,
malate, oxoglutarate, acetate, and oxalate.
Initial 16 S rDNA sequencing [5] showed Oligotropha
carboxidovorans is phylogenetically close to two Bradyrhizobiaceae: Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi and Nitrobacter hamburgiensis X14. All three species share some common
gene(s) and operons; however, these three bacteria vary
greatly in metabolism. Together they are an excellent

model for understanding how closely related bacteria
adapt to very different environments.
In addition to its utility for comparative genomics, O.
carboxidovorans genes may have practical utility for bioenergy production. O. carboxidovorans is capable of utilizing syngas, which is a mixture of CO, CO2, and H2 that
results from gasification of organic wastes, for chemolithoautotrophic growth. Microbial fermentation of this
gas mixture could serve as a source for biofuels. Many of
the chemolithoautotrophy genes in O. carboxidovorans
are located on a megaplasmid and have been studied
[2,4,6,7]. The O. carboxidovorans genome will allow
further studies to understand how they are regulated and
how fixed carbon is assimilated into its metabolism,
which could enhance use of syngas as a biofuel source.
We previously announced the O. carboxidovorans genome sequence [8]. At the time of our previous announcement, the chromosome sequence was in two large
contigs. We now report completion of the O. carboxidovorans OM5 genome and comparative genomics analysis

with Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi and N. hamburgiensis
X14. Central intermediary metabolism is similar in O.
carboxidovorans, Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi, and N. hamburgiensis X14, and O. carboxidovorans shares other
features such as iron transport systems. However, O. carboxidovorans also has several unique features, particularly in fatty acid oxidation and glyoxylate cycle.

Results and discussion
Genome organization

Closure of the last two gaps produced a 3,745,629 bp
long circular OM5 chromosome (62.4% GC) with 3782
predicted genes. The vast majority (3722) are protein
coding; 48 encode RNAs, and 12 are predicted as pseudogenes. Of the 48 RNA genes, three are rRNA genes (one
rRNA operon is present), and the rest code for tRNAs.
Twelve percent of the genome is predicted to be intergenic DNA. Of the OM5 protein coding genes, TIGR
role categories were assigned to 87.59%. Of these, 72.01%
had a definitive functional assignment, and 1.31% did not
have a role category. In addition, 15.99% were identified
as conserved hypothetical proteins (CHPs), and 10.67%
were designated as hypothetical proteins (HPs). Transporter and enzyme functions are the most abundant
major metabolic activities in the OM5 genome, together
making up 10.5% of the predicted coding capacity.
Table 1 shows predicted functional classifications (COG
groups) of O. carboxidovorans proteins.

Using RfamScan http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/[9] in Oligotroscope, we found 10 potential non-coding RNA
sequences, which includes small RNA (sRNA) (Table 2).
Prediction of prokaryotic sRNAs has limitations because
their sequences are diverse; therefore, identification is
based on conserved sequence features in the intergenic
regions (promoters, terminators, and RNA secondary
structures). In several bacteria, sRNAs have important regulatory functions, including regulation of outer membrane
protein expression and regulating stress responses (e.g.,
oxidative stress, SOS/DNA damage, cold shock, and iron
stress). Some sRNAs such as DsrA and RprA are translational activators [10-12]. The regulatory RNA SsrA is
needed for correct high-level translation of RpoS [13].
GC and AT skew analysis http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/OriFinder/ suggests a putative replication origin (spanning
150 nt) starting at position 357,583 [14]. The origin has a
strong inflection point in the coding strand with 4 DnaA
box motifs (tgtttcacg). This motif was identified using
search parameters that allowed no more than one mismatch compared to the perfect E. coli DnaA box (ttatccaca) (see Figure 1; constructed using CG View) [15].
The final sequences discussed in this paper (GenBank:
NC_011386; tax ID 504832) are available at Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) (cmr.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/

Comparative genomics

O. carboxidovorans, N. hamburgensis, and Bradyrhizobium spp. have contrasting physiologies and ecological
niches. N. hamburgensis is ubiquitous in nature; it has
been isolated from soil, building sandstone, and sewage
sludge. It is similar to O. carboxidovorans in that it is a
facultatively lithoautotrophic bacterium, but it differs
from O. carboxidovorans by using nitrite to nitrate

oxidation (nitrification) as its autotrophic growth energy
source. N. hamburgensis can also grow mixotrophically
with NO2 and organic components or heterotrophically
using only organic compounds [16,17]. Its current biotechnology applications include efficient transformation
of fertilizer nitrogen into readily usable forms (such as
nitrates) and nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. B. japonicum USDA110 is a nitrogen-fixing

bacterium that develops a symbiotic relationship with
the soybean plant Glycine max by establishing root
nodules [18]. Such symbiotic relations are agriculturally
important as they obviate the need for expensive and
environmentally damaging fertilizer. Bradyrhizobium sp.
BTAi1 is a photosynthetic rhizobium that is also capable
of nitrogen fixation, the first known example of such an
organism [19]. It can form stem and root nodules.
The OM5 16 S rDNA genes are most similar to those
of Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14, followed by Bradyrhizobium sp. strains USDA110 and BTAi1 (Figure 2). The
OM5 genome is also more syntenic to N. hamburgensis
X14 than Bradyrhizobium (Table 3). Thus, overall gene
synteny substantiates the rDNA phylogeny, but regional
synteny between the three strains varies considerably.
Synteny is well conserved between the three species in
regions containing genes that encode conserved functions, such as ABC transporters, heavy metal binding
and transporter proteins, ribosomal proteins, and metabolic pathways (amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, flagellar proteins, chaperones, etc.). By contrast, synteny is
less conserved in genes encoding some of the hypothetical proteins, and this difference is likely due to specific
evolutionary adaption. A comparison of general genome
features shows considerable variation in genome size in
the three species, but otherwise the three species are
similar (Table 4).
Although these three genera have different physiologies, they show significant homology at the protein level.
O. carboxidovorans OM5 shares 1148 orthologous proteins (bidirectional best hits (BBHs) with identity ≥ 70%)
[20] with N. hamburgensis X14, and it shares 1157 with
B. japonicum USDA110. Comparing all three strains
using the same criteria, there are 953 proteins that have
orthologs in all three strains [Additional file 1]. Many of

these are “housekeeping” proteins involved in DNA
metabolism, repair, protein synthesis, central metabolic
pathways, and chaperones/heat shock proteins. Many of
the flagellar proteins and proteins responsible for nitrogen uptake and regulation had orthologs in all three
species. Membrane proteins involved in uptake of
cations and heavy metal ions (such as CusA
(OCAR_4024) and CzcA-like proteins (OCAR_4741,
OCAR_4871, OCAR_6437, OCAR_6658, OCAR_7479,
OCAR_7726, and OCAR_7738)) also had orthologs in
all three species.
On the other hand, 1090 O. carboxidovorans proteins
did not have similarity with any proteins from B. japonicum and N. hamburgensis (identity < 30%) [21] [Additional file 2]. Most of these proteins are hypothetical;
some are phage integrase proteins, and a few are transcriptional regulators or permease genes responsible for
transport of ions across the cell membrane. These proteins appear unique to O. carboxidovorans and could be
interesting for further study to determine their roles in
cellular metabolism.
Mobile and extrachromosomal elements

The O. carboxidovorans genome has 49 putative phage
or transposon related genes and two prophages as
determined by Prophinder. No transposons are present.
This number of bacteriophage genes is lower than
N. hamburgensis strain X14, which has 96 predicted
phage-related genes and six prophage genes. High genome plasticity or presence of a large number of mobile
elements can indicate the need for rapid changes in
response to the environment [22]. For example, the
Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 genome contains at least
8 large DNA segments that have evolved due to genetic
exchanges with other bacteria [23]; these adaptations
improved its ability to compete and survive in the
dynamic and microbiologically complex rhizosphere.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 also has a large number of
mobile elements that provide a means of rapid adaptation [24]. Thus, O. carboxidovorans may live in an
environment where there is less selective pressure compared to N. hamburgensis. By contrast, B. japonicum
strain USDA110 does not have any predicted prophages
(although it has 20 predicted phage-related genes).
Genes coding for mobile and extrachromosomal element functions form a distinct and major category only
in N. hamburgensis and not in the other two species.
Energy metabolism

Many of the unique features of OM5 energy metabolism
enabling it to use CO (carboxidotrophy) or H2 (hydrogenotrophy) under aerobic chemolithoautotrophic conditions [25,26] are encoded on the pHCG3 megaplasmid.
OM5 central energy metabolism genes are similar to

*Number of coding sequences (CDS) encoded in each respective genome.
†Percent bidirectional best hits (BBH) in each respective species compared to O. carboxidovorans. BBH are defined as gene couples encoding proteins that are
considered orthologous based on either reciprocal best BLAST hits or satisfying a BLASTp alignment threshold (a minimum of 35% sequence identity over 80%
of the length of the smaller protein).
‡The number of syntons shared between each respective species and O. carboxidovorans. A synton is a conserved gene cluster (synteny group) shared between
two bacterial genomes. All possible kinds of chromosomal rearrangements are allowed (inversion, insertion/deletion). The gap parameter, representing the
maximum number of consecutive genes that are not involved in a synteny group, was set to five genes.

N. hamburgensis and B. japonicum (as well as other
members of Bradyrhizobiaceae). For energy production,
OM5 mainly uses NADH-quinone oxidoreductases by
oxidative phosphorylation. The chromosome encodes a
F-type ATPase that is typical in bacteria and cytochrome c oxidase (cbb3 type), which would be used in
various other carbon metabolism pathways. Gene(s)
responsible for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are
located on the chromosome; they allow heterotrophic
growth on nutrient rich media (tryptic soy broth) and
on minimal medium containing acetate [8].
Carbohydrate metabolism

Genes enabling CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) reductive pentose phosphate cycle are located
on the megaplasmid [4]. The OM5 chromosome encodes
a complete Krebs cycle [Additional file 3] and a complete
anaplerotic glyoxylate cycle [Additional file 3]. The glyoxylate cycle functions similar to the Krebs cycle but lacks
enzyme steps that generate CO 2 . It is primarily an

oxidative pathway that allows synthesis of carbohydrates
from acetyl~SCoA, which usually is derived from the oxidation of fatty acids by the b-oxidation pathway. The
glyoxylate cycle is found in many b-proteobacteria, including OM5, particularly in organisms that grow well in
media in which acetate and other Krebs cycle dicarboxylic
acid intermediates are the sole carbon growth source.
Compared to N. hamburgensis, the OM5 chromosome
encodes many gene(s) that participate in glyoxylate and
dicarboxylate metabolism alone [Additional file 3]. The
difference may reflect the inability of N. hamburgenesis to
utilize dicarboxylates. B. japonicum is capable of catabolizing dicarboxylic acids [16,18]; not surprisingly, it has
nearly the same number of gene(s) as O. carboxidovorans.
Fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation

All three species have enzymes participating in saturated
and unsaturated fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis. In
OM5, of the 2.54% genes responsible for fatty acid and
phospholipid metabolism, 61 code for fatty acid biosynthesis, and 32 code for fat degradation. Genes present in
OM5 involved in fatty acid biosynthesis encode orthologs
for Acp, AccA, AccB, AccC, AccD, FabD, FabH, FabF,
FabG, FabA, FabZ, and FabI [27]. OM5 is capable of generating malonyl-CoA via acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc)
(OCAR_5979, 5980, 4079) and transferring malonyl-CoA
to acyl carrier protein by FabD. It also has genes necessary for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation (fabH, fabB and
fabF), keto group reduction (fabG), dehydration (fabA or
fabZ), and enoyl reduction (fabI). As expected, because
O. carboxidovorans, N. hamburgensis, or B. japonicum
have fabI, they do not have fabK and fabL.
Compared with N. hamburgensis or B. japonicum,
O. carboxidovorans has fewer fatty acid oxidation

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:511
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/511

enzymes [Additional file 3]. In particular, OM5 lacks the
genes that degrade long chain fatty acids. For example,
O. carboxidovorans does not have a gene encoding
bll2324 (long-chain-fatty-acid–[acyl-carrier-protein]
ligase), which is involved in degradation of long chain
fatty acids. This gene is present in B. japonicum. Fatty
acid methyl ester analysis on strain OM5 indicated an
accumulation of some long chain fatty acids when it is
grown under different environmental conditions
(unpublished results). We believe the absence of these
genes in O. carboxidovorans may contribute to accumulation of long chain fatty acids under certain conditions.
Chemolithoautotrophic growth

O. carboxidovorans is an autotrophic organism that can
grow at the expense of inorganic compounds and use
CO2 as a carbon source. Its nitrogen comes from inorganic compounds such as NH 3 , NO 3 - , or N 2 . During
chemolithoautotrophic growth, it derives energy from
oxidation of CO to CO2. This function is encoded on a
megaplasmid encoding the enzyme CO dehydrogenase
(cox gene cluster). Plasmid-cured mutants (or mutants
in which deletions have been introduced into the plasmid) either lose all chemolithoautotrophic growth capabilities or cannot utilize H 2 plus CO 2 but retain the
ability of using CO plus CO2 [4,25,28].
The N. hamburgensis genome contains genes that are
found in carboxidotrophic bacteria. For example, it has
several genes encoding cytochrome b561, an important
electron transfer component in aerobic carboxidotrophic
bacteria [29]. The N. hamburgensis genome also has
four gene clusters and a lone CDS encoding multiple
homologs of molybdopterin-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (Mo-CODH). The largest of these
clusters (Nham_2601 to Nham_2608) has high similarity
to B. japonicum USDA110 and few other species [16].
In fact, the N. hamburgensis genome has more copies of
Mo-CODH-like genes than it does of nitrite oxidoreductase (membrane bound Mo-dependent enzyme required
for converting nitrite to nitrate) [16]. This suggests that
these proteins have a vital, but poorly understood, role
in the lifestyle of N. hamburgensis. B. japonicum
USDA110 also encodes a Mo-CODH, and it can oxidize
CO at the expense of nitrate reduction under anaerobic
conditions. However, it does not grow under these conditions [30]. In strain USDA110, anaerobic CO uptake
only occurs in the presence of nitrate, which is not a
substrate or electron acceptor for anaerobic CODH.
Therefore, no carbon fixation occurs [16,31]. Thus,
although these two species differ from O. carboxidovorans in their chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, they have
similar enzyme(s) for this purpose, particularly CODH.
In O. carboxidovorans, the cox genes are specifically and
coordinately transcribed under chemolithoautotrophic

Page 6 of 10

conditions in the presence of CO [26]; therefore, sensing
CO is an important function. CO sensors are typically
heme-based [32]. Two O. carboxidovorans genes encode
proteins (CoxC and CoxH) that are putatively associated
with CO sensing based on sequence motifs similar to two
component regulatory systems [4]. However, the O. carboxidovorans sequence upstream of the cox cluster does
not have genes with unambiguous functions in the sensing
of CO or the regulation of cox genes. Other species, such
as Azotobacter vinelandii and Bradyrhizobium, contain a
gene encoding CooA transcriptional receptor that may be
involved in CO sensing and regulating the function of CO
dehydrogenase [4]. BLASTP results suggest this protein
belongs to the ACAD superfamily, and it shows similarity
to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in lipid metabolism.
O. carboxidovorans has chromosomally encoded acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase genes; some of them are directly involved
in fatty acid metabolism (OCAR_5221, OCAR_5223,
OCAR_5308, OCAR_5791, OCAR_6069, OCAR_6878,
and OCAR_6891). Therefore, it is possible that chromosomally encoded lipid metabolism in O. carboxidovorans
and plasmid-encoded CO fixation are linked, but further
studies are needed to confirm this.
Transport and binding

One tenth of O. carboxidovorans genes are responsible
for cell motility, binding, and membrane transport. By
contrast, 6% of N. hamburgensis genes are in this category. This difference likely reflects their contrasting lifestyles. As an environmental species, O. carboxidovorans
likely has increased need for a diversity of these functions, while the symbiotic species N. hamburgensis is in
a relatively constant environment.
Iron transport and related proteins are responsible for
specific uptake of ferric-siderophore complexes, which
are high affinity iron chelators in gram-negative bacteria. O. carboxidovorans codes for 3 Fhu gene(s),
OCAR_4564, OCAR_4560, and OCAR_4561, that are
periplasmic proteins and may function as an ABC-type
transport mechanism driven by ATP hydrolysis. The E.
coli fhu system consists of four genes, designated fhuA,
fhuC, fhuD and fhuB, that are arranged in one operon
[33]. Periplasmic FhuD (31 kDa) and cytoplasmic-membrane-associated FhuC (29 kDa) and FhuB (41 kDa) are
proteins necessary for the transport of ferrichrome and
other Fe3+-hydroxamate compounds (Fe3+-aerobactin,
Fe3+-coprogen) across the cytoplasmic membrane from
the periplasm into the cytoplasm [34-36]. The protein
complex TonB-ExbB-ExbD [37,38] provides energy for
this process. The presence of genes encoding these proteins suggests a functional iron siderophore transport
complex in O. carboxidovorans.
Iron acquisition is important in bacteria, both as a
requirement for growth and as an environmental signal

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:511
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/511

that regulates gene expression [39]. Iron transport is
especially important in nitrogen fixing bacteria [40]
because it increases fitness in the competitive rhizosphere [41,42]. Rhizobium leguminosarum (a symbiotic
nitrogen fixing species) contains a fhuDCB operon for
siderophore uptake [43]. Bradyrhizobium also has iron
transport systems, but unlike O. carboxidovorans, it
does not utilize TonB iron transport. The presence of
Fe siderophores and transporter genes in non pathogenic, non-nitrogen fixing O. carboxidovorans reflects its
similarity to nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria. The presence of these genes in O. carboxidovorans also indicates
that its natural environment, like most natural environments, is restricted in iron [40].
Unlike N. hamburgensis, O. carboxidovorans and B.
japonicum have nickel/peptide transporting genes.
Other O. carboxidovorans transport related proteins (e.
g,. oligosaccharide/lipoprotein/amino acid transport
related proteins) are also present in N. hamburgensis
and B. japonicum.

Conclusion
The previously reported sequence of the O. carboxidovorans megaplasmid revealed mechanisms for its chemolithoautotrophic growth. The complete O.
carboxidovorans genome reveals metabolic pathways
used during heterotrophic growth and how chemolithoautotrophic growth is linked with central metabolism. Further research is needed to identify genes
involved in the regulation of chemolithoautotrophic
growth versus heterotrophic growth.
O. carboxidovorans appears to be adapted to a relatively
stable microenvironment because its genome contains
remarkably few phage- or transposon-related genes in
comparison to N. hamburgensis and other soil bacteria.
The lack of any typical Gram-negative communication
system based on acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs)
also suggests an exclusive microhabitat, similar to Azoarcus BH72 [44]. Production of AHLs is not uncommon in
environmental bacteria, but it only occurs in some microhabitats under appropriate conditions [45]. Another
important characteristic of the O. carboxidovorans genome
is the presence of TonB-dependent receptors for iron
transport across the cell membrane, unlike N. hamburgensis and B. japonicum. The role of iron acquisition in O.
carboxidovorans metabolism is another very interesting
area for future research.
O. carboxidovorans, N. hamburgensis, and B. japonicum each have unique genetic pathways that enable
them to have specialized functions such as CO oxidation, nitrite oxidation, and N2 fixation. These genetic
pathways have historically been the most well studied
from these species. However, comparison of their

Page 7 of 10

genomes reveals that there are many metabolic pathways that are conserved between these closely related
species. Comparison of these three genomes also
revealed previously unknown differences in the “conserved” metabolic pathways. The cumulative effects of
these metabolic differences, along with the unique pathways, allow these phylogenetically related species to
adapt to diverse environments [46]. Therefore, the
unique pathways for these organisms must be understood in the context of their respective genomes. This
current analysis is only a beginning, and further work
on the function of O. carboxidovorans proteins will yield
valuable information on how this species survives in its
unique environment and how it adapts to both heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic lifestyles.

Methods
Sequencing methods

O. carboxidovorans OM5 (ATCC no. 49405) was grown
on carboxydobacterium medium (ATCC no 1789) using
acetate as a substrate at 30°C with continuous shaking
for 72 h under aerobic conditions. DNA isolation,
sequencing, and assembly were conducted as described
previously [8]. The assembly at this point had two large
contigs. The two gaps were closed by PCR amplification
and primer walking. Sequencing reactions were performed to correct a misassembly in the genome. The
gaps had G+C rich regions that resulted in early signal
loss during sequencing. To circumvent this problem, we
used SequenceR x Enhancer Solution A (Invitrogen),
which enables longer reads on templates containing
regions with secondary structure caused by high G+C
content, small nucleotide repeats, hairpins, direct
repeats, and inverted repeats. Other techniques were
used by MWG Biotech (Eurofins) to resolve hard
sequencing stops to complete the reads. The complete
genome was submitted to NCBI.
Once the complete genome was submitted to NCBI,
Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) and Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) were used to compare
OM5 against all of the publicly available, complete prokaryotic genomes. Orifinder, Prophinder [47]http://
aclame.ulb.ac.be/Tools/Prophinder/, and CGVIEW were
used to determine the origin of the circular genome,
identify prophages, and to obtain a circular graphical
representation of the genome.
Comparative genomics

The O. carboxidovorans genome sequence was submitted to Magnifying Genomes Microbial Genome
Annotation System (MaGe) [48], which benevolently
created Oligotroscope. This website allowed manual
annotation as well as orthology and synteny detection of

Paul et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:511
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/511

microbial genomes available in NCBI. Putative orthologous relationships between genomes were defined as
gene couples satisfying the bidirectional best hit (BBH)
criterion or a BLASTP alignment threshold (a minimum
of 70% sequence identity over 80% of the length of the
smallest protein) [48]. Unique proteins were identified
as proteins having <30% sequence identity over 80% of
the length. These relationships were subsequently used
to search for conserved gene clusters (synteny groups or
syntons) among several bacterial genomes using the
Syntonizer function. All possible kinds of chromosomal
rearrangements were allowed (inversion, insertion/deletion). The gap parameter, representing the maximum
number of consecutive genes that are not involved in a
synteny group, was set to five genes. Orthology relations
were strengthened by synteny detection (conservation of
chromosomal co-localization between pairs of orthologous genes from different genomes) using the Phyloprofile synteny option in Oligotroscope. The method used
was not restricted to the BBH definition; therefore, it
allowed for multiple correspondences between genes
(fusion/fission, duplication) and chromosomal rearrangements (inversion, insertion/deletion). Oligotroscope was
also used to determine the misc_RNAs in the genome
(Table 1).
We determined O. carboxidovorans-specific genes
(genes encoding proteins where no orthologs were
detected in the compared species and not in any synteny
group) using the two most closely related species with
fully sequenced genomes for comparison, Bradyrhizobium sp. (strain USDA110 and BTAi1) and N. hamburgensis X14. Cartographic representations in the MaGe
web interface allowed us to confirm the manual annotations and detect specific gene(s).
Phylogenetic tree construction

For tree construction, 16 S rRNA sequences were
aligned in ClustalX [49], followed by tree construction
using Treecon [50]. Distance estimations were performed in Treecon by Jukes and Cantor method [51].
Tree topology for the 16 S rRNA nucleotide sequences
were inferred by the distance matrix using Neighbour
Joining method [52].
Pathway analysis

For pathway analysis, we used the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) PATHWAY Database,
which includes the completed sequence of strain OM5
http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?
org=oca. The KEGG database was also used to trace the
enzymes/pathways in Bradyrhizobium USDA110 and N.
hamburgensis X14 and compare with strain OM5.
