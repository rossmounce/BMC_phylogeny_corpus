Abstract
Background: Cryptophytes are an enigmatic group of unicellular eukaryotes with plastids derived
by secondary (i.e., eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis. Cryptophytes are unusual in that they
possess four genomes–a host cell-derived nuclear and mitochondrial genome and an
endosymbiont-derived plastid and 'nucleomorph' genome. The evolutionary origins of the host and
endosymbiont components of cryptophyte algae are at present poorly understood. Thus far, a
single complete mitochondrial genome sequence has been determined for the cryptophyte
Rhodomonas salina. Here, the second complete mitochondrial genome of the cryptophyte alga
Hemiselmis andersenii CCMP644 is presented.
Results: The H. andersenii mtDNA is 60,553 bp in size and encodes 30 structural RNAs and 36
protein-coding genes, all located on the same strand. A prominent feature of the genome is the
presence of a ~20 Kbp long intergenic region comprised of numerous tandem and dispersed repeat
units of between 22–336 bp. Adjacent to these repeats are 27 copies of palindromic sequences
predicted to form stable DNA stem-loop structures. One such stem-loop is located near a GCrich and GC-poor region and may have a regulatory function in replication or transcription. The H.
andersenii mtDNA shares a number of features in common with the genome of the cryptophyte
Rhodomonas salina, including general architecture, gene content, and the presence of a large repeat
region. However, the H. andersenii mtDNA is devoid of inverted repeats and introns, which are
present in R. salina. Comparative analyses of the suite of tRNAs encoded in the two genomes reveal
that the H. andersenii mtDNA has lost or converted its original trnK(uuu) gene and possesses a trnSderived 'trnK(uuu)', which appears unable to produce a functional tRNA. Mitochondrial protein
coding gene phylogenies strongly support a variety of previously established eukaryotic groups, but
fail to resolve the relationships among higher-order eukaryotic lineages.
Conclusion: Comparison of the H. andersenii and R. salina mitochondrial genomes reveals a
number of cryptophyte-specific genomic features, most notably the presence of a large repeat-rich
intergenic region. However, unlike R. salina, the H. andersenii mtDNA does not possess introns and
lacks a Lys-tRNA, which is presumably imported from the cytosol.

Background
The mitochondrion is a double-membrane enclosed
organelle found in the vast majority of extant eukaryotes.
Mitochondria are best known for their essential role in
energy generation, but they are also the site of additional
important cellular processes such as iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
cluster assembly and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids [1].
Some degenerate forms of mitochondria, such as the
mitosome of the diplomonad parasite Giardia lamblia,
have secondarily lost energy generating pathways and
seem to retain only the Fe-S cluster maturation function
[2]. All mitochondria are believed to share a single origin
from an α-proteobacterial-like prokaryote [1], but a wide
diversity of mitochondrial genome architectures have
evolved subsequent to the diversification of modern-day
eukaryotes [1,3,4]. For example, whereas "derived" animals possess monomeric circular mitochondrial
genomes, an observation which led to the initial assumption that mtDNAs are primarily circular [5], many other
mitochondrial genomes, such as that of the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis [6], the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [7] and the cnidarian metazoan Aurelia aurita
(moon jelly) [8] are linear [9]. In addition, while some
fungi and many plants have circular-mapping mtDNAs,
their mitochondria actually contain predominantly linear
mtDNA molecules with combinations of monomers and
concatemers, with only a minor fraction of the molecules
present in a circular form [10]. A more extreme example is
the mtDNA of kinetoplastids, which consists of one maxiand many different mini-circles that are interconnected to
form an extensive network [11]. Mitochondrial gene content is also highly variable; the mtDNA of the jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana encodes 97 genes, the
largest set of mitochondrial genes currently known [12],
whereas the mtDNA of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum contains just 3 protein coding genes and 2
highly fragmented small and large subunit ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) genes [13]. The most highly derived forms of
mitochondria, such as the hydrogenosome of Trichomonas
vaginalis [14] and the Giardia lamblia mitosome [2], have
lost their genomes entirely [15].
Mitochondria are also known as sites of unusual molecular biology and biochemistry. Marande and Burger [3]
recently showed that the mtDNA genes of the euglenid
Diplonema papillatum are fragmented into as many as nine
modules, each residing on a distinct 6 or 7 Kbp chromosome. The mechanism by which these fragmented gene
pieces are linked together to form contiguous transcripts
is unknown. Extensive mRNA editing is another example
of the bizarre molecular biology of mitochondria. Kinetoplastid mitochondrial mRNAs are subject to insertions
and deletions of uridylate residues, sometimes >100 such
insertions/deletions per transcript [16]. Mitochondrial
mRNA editing is also widespread in land plants [17] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/215

dinoflagellates [18]. For example, ~2% of the cox1 and cob
gene sequences in three dinoflagellate species investigated
by Lin et al. [19] were edited at the mRNA level.
We are studying the genomic diversity and evolution of
cryptophytes, a ubiquitous and ecologically significant
group of single-celled eukaryotes found in freshwater and
marine environments. Most cryptophytes, except for
members of the genus Goniomonas, harbor plastids of secondary endosymbiotic origin [20]. A variety of shared
morphological features, such as the presence of ejectisomes, flat mitochondrial cristae, and an anterior depression, support the monophyly of cryptophytes, as do
molecular phylogenetic data [21]. One unique feature of
cryptophyte plastids that distinguishes them from other
plastids of red algal origin is the retention of the remnant
nucleus of the red algal endosymbiont, referred to as the
nucleomorph [22,23]. Consequently, most cryptophytes
harbor four distinct genomes–nuclear, nucleomorph,
mitochondrial, and plastid genomes–contained in separate compartments. Cryptophytes are thus an interesting
model system with which to study endosymbiotic gene
transfer, genome evolution, and protein targeting.
In this study, we report the complete mitochondrial
genome sequence of the newly described cryptophyte species Hemiselmis andersenii CCMP644, and compare it to
the only other cryptophyte mitochondrial genome
described thus far, that of Rhodomonas salina [24]. In addition, individual and concatenated mitochondrial protein
coding gene sequences were analyzed to infer the phylogenetic relationships of cryptophytes to other eukaryotes.

Methods
DNA preparation, sequencing, and genome assembly
Hemiselmis andersenii mtDNA was isolated and sequenced
to ~10× coverage as described in Lane et al. [25]. About
1,200 end sequences were screened for quality and vector
contamination with Pregap4 and automatically assembled using gap4 version 4.10 in the Staden package [26].
Complete automated assembly of a large intergenic space
between trnS and cox2 was unsuccessful due to the highly
repetitive nature of this region. In an attempt to manually
resolve this area, short (~30 bp) unique sequences within
the trnS and cox2 genes were used to probe the sequence
database for reads that extended from these two loci into
the repeat region. These sequences were extracted and
manually aligned using MacClade version 4.08 [27].
Sequences at the ends of the new constructs were then
selected and the process was repeated. However, due to
the presence of multiple identical copies of a >500 bp
repeat, the assembly of a single unambiguous contig was
not possible. When all available sequence reads were considered, three robust contigs were produced, each ending
with similar repetitive sequences consisting of a ~340 bp

repeat unit. These three contigs were joined to circularize
the map. The complete H. andersenii mtDNA has been
submitted to GenBank under the following accession
number: EU651892.
DNA secondary structure within the repeat region was
predicted using mfold version 3.2 [28] at a folding temperature of 37°C and the ionic conditions of 1.0 M [Na+]
and 0.0 M [Mg++].
Genome size/structure determination
We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to obtain
an independent size estimate of the H. andersenii mitochondrial genome. Hemiselmis andersenii total DNA plugs
were prepared as described in Lane et al. [29] and digested
overnight with the restriction enzymes PstI or BglII (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA). Based on the genome
sequence, these enzymes were predicted to cut the mtDNA
only once or twice. Both untreated and enzyme-digested
H. andersenii DNA plugs were run on a 1% agarose gel (1×
TBE) in 0.5× TBE buffer at 14.0°C for 18 h at a voltage of
6.0 V/cm with a switch time between 1–25 s using a
CHEF-DR III Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). DNA on the
pulsed-field gel was transferred to a nylon membrane.
Southern hybridization using a ~700 bp coxI probe as in
Lane and Archibald [30] revealed that undigested mitochondrial DNA molecules were trapped in the wells or
found in the 'compression zone'. The PstI or BglII endonuclease treated DNA plugs revealed mitochondrial molecules in a discrete band below the 'compression zone'. The
corresponding bands could not be visualized on the
ethidium-bromide stained pulsed-field gel image because
of nuclear and nucleomorph DNA smears in the background. In order to visualize mtDNA on the pulsed-field
gel, an initial PFGE run was used to remove the linear
nuclear and nucleomorph chromosomes from the PFGE
plugs. These plugs, which still contained organellar DNA,
were subsequently removed from the gel and digested
with the restriction enzymes PstI and BglII. Digested plugs
were then inserted into a fresh gel and electrophoresed
under the conditions described above. The 5 Kbp and
Lambda CHEF DNA Size Standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) were used to estimate the size of the
enzymatically linearized H. andersenii mtDNA.
Genome annotation and GC content/skew analyses
Annotation of the H. andersenii mtDNA and the GC content and skew analyses were performed in Artemis version
8 [31]. Gene identification was carried out using BLASTX
and BLASTN. Small and large ribosomal rRNA subunit
genes were identified by comparison to rRNA gene
sequences in the mitochondrial genome of Rhodomonas
salina. Transfer RNAs were identified using tRNAscan-SE
version 1.21 [32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/215

Genome rearrangements between the two cryptophyte
mtDNA
The extent to which the H. andersenii and R. salina mitochondrial genomes are rearranged to each other was estimated using GRIMM [33]. Each genome was designated
as a sequence of 63 units, which include a repeat region
and 62 genes common between the two cryptophyte mtDNAs.
RT-PCR of 'trnK(uuu)'
tRNAscan-SE version 1.21 [32] identified a putative intron
of ~20 bp in the anticodon loop of the H. andersenii
trnK(uuu) gene. To determine whether this prediction was
correct, we performed RT-PCR using Lysine-tRNA-specific
primer pairs and H. andersenii total RNA provided by H.
Khan. To eliminate DNA contamination, 1 μl of total RNA
was incubated for 30 min with RQ1 RNase-Free Dnase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). RT-PCR was performed
using the QIAGEN one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) and with control reactions in which the
reverse-transcription process was skipped. The following
two pairs of primers were used: 1) The forward primer 5'GAAGGTTGCTCGAATGGAA-3' with the reverse primer
5'-GAAGGTATAGGAATTGAACCTATTC-3' 2) and the forward primer 5'-GCCCAGAAGGTTGCTC-3' with the
reverse primer 5'-AAGAAGGTATAGGAATTGAACCTAT-3'.
RT-PCR was performed with the reverse transcription step
for 30 min at 50°C and the subsequent inactivation of
reverse transcriptase and activation of HotStart Taq DNA
polymerase for 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles at
94°C for 1 min, 47°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and
a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified PCR
fragments were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector in the
TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Between 5 and 10 bacterial colonies
from each reaction were selected for sequencing on a
Beckman Coulter CEQ8000 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, California, USA).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
From the 36 protein-coding genes found in the H. andersenii mtDNA, 25 were selected for phylogenetic analyses.
Eleven genes (atp8, nad8, rps2, rps3, rps4, rps7, rps8, rps13,
rpl5, rpl6, tatC) were excluded because their sequences
were poorly conserved and/or were only present in a few
taxonomic groups. H. andersenii protein sequences were
aligned with their homologs from other mitochondrial
genomes available from GenBank. Amino acid sequences
were aligned using MacClade version 4.08 [27] and
ambiguously aligned sites were manually removed. In
addition to individual protein analyses, a concatenated
protein data set containing 25 proteins was analyzed. To
include the maximum number of gene sequences, we
combined 25 protein-coding gene sequences encoded in
18 mitochondrial genomes across diverse eukaryotic taxa.

As most mitochondrial genomes do not possess all 25
protein-coding genes selected for analysis, as many as 12
protein gene sequences were missing per taxon. A maximum likelihood tree was produced using RAxML-VI-HPC
version 2.2.3 [34] with the PROTOMIXJTT model of
sequence evolution and the automatic tree rearrangement
setting, and from 100 distinct randomized maximum parsimony starting trees. Bootstrap analysis was based on 100
re-samplings.

Results and Discussion
General features of Hemiselmis andersenii mtDNA
The mitochondrial DNA of the cryptophyte Hemiselmis
andersenii CCMP644 was sequenced, assembled and manually edited to produce a circular-mapping genome
60,553 bp in size (Figure 1). Genome assembly was complicated by the presence of a highly repetitive non-coding
region of ~20 Kbp (see below); genome size was thus verified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Several observations suggest that the H. andersenii mtDNA
exists primarily in a linear-branched form comprised of
multiple genome units. In PFGE, the H. andersenii mtDNA
remains in the well or migrates within the 'compression
zone' (i.e., the unresolved portion of DNA near the top of
the gel), which contains primarily linear nuclear and
nucleomorph chromosomes larger than ~150 Kbp (data
not shown). The lack of mtDNA below the 'compression
zone' suggests that the H. andersenii mtDNA is not composed of linear monomers or dimers. Furthermore, when
the H. andersenii mtDNA is partially digested with PstI, an
enzyme predicted to cut the genome only once, it produces a discrete band of ~60 Kbp in size (data not shown)
but not a band ~120 Kbp in size, which would correspond
to a dimeric linear form of the genome. This result indicates that the H. andersenii mtDNA is not composed of circular concatemers or linear head-to-tail concatemers
consisting of three or more genomic units. Therefore, we
suggest that the H. andersenii mtDNA exists primarily as a
branched linear molecule although monomeric circles
may also exist. Further studies using transmission electron
microscopy or the 'moving picture' technique [10] will be
necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

The H. andersenii mitochondrial genome is comprised of
a gene-rich region ~40 Kbp in size and a large (19,675 bp)
intergenic region between trnS and cox2 with complex
repeats (Figures 1 and 2). The intergenic region accounts
for 32.5% of the entire genome and 83.5% of the total
amount of non-coding DNA (23,549 bp). The overall GC
content of the genome is 28.72%, slightly higher than that
of the nucleomorph genome of this organism [25]. Interestingly, a ~40 bp region near the start of the coding portion of the genome is very GC-rich (78.38%) and is
followed by a 100% AT-containing region ~190 bp in size
(Figure 3). This unusual stretch of sequence is about 70 bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/215

from a palindromic sequence that is predicted to form a
Type II stem-loop (Figures 2 and 3; see discussion below),
and may be involved in regulating replication or transcription.
The H. andersenii mitochondrial genome encodes 66
genes with predicted functions and 8 hypothetical protein-coding genes, a total somewhat higher than the average for eukaryotes (40–50 genes) [1]. Ten genes–orf167,
orf71, rps13, rps11, nad3, rps2, tatC, 'trnK (uuu)', rps12, and
rps7–overlap by up to 51 bp, emphasizing the extreme
compactness of the coding portion of the genome. The
genome encodes small and large rRNA subunit genes and
28 tRNAs, one of which may be a pseudogene (see discussion below). Of the 36 identifiable protein-coding genes,
14 encode ribosomal proteins, 21 are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and one gene encodes a membrane
translocase protein (Table 1).
Comparison of the mtDNA gene order in H. andersenii to
other genomes reveals the presence of five gene clusters
shared among distantly related protists: two ribosomal
protein clusters (rps12-rps7-rps19-rps3-rpl16-rpl14-rpl5rps14 and rps8-rpl6-rps13-rps11) and three NADH dehydrogenase clusters (nad4L-nad5; nad4-nad2; nad10-nad9).
These gene clusters have been suggested to represent vestiges of bacterial operons [12,24]. Interestingly, all 74
genes in the H. andersenii mitochondrial genome are
encoded on the same strand. While the evolution of such
an arrangement seems improbable, absolute strand polarity has been observed in the mitochondrial genomes of
diverse eukaryotes such as the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii (59 genes), the fungus Penicillium marneffei (47
genes), and the green alga Chlamydomonas eugametos (20
genes) [35-37]. In addition, strikingly similar mtDNA
architectures–gene-dense regions, a single large repetitive
intergenic region, and all genes encoded on one strand–
are seen in diverse protists such as the stramenopile
Thraustochytrium aureum (The Organelle Genome Megasequencing Program; http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/
ogmp/) and the green alga Pedinomonas minor [38].
Understanding the biological significance of such convergence at the level of genome architecture will require comparative molecular and biochemical studies of
mitochondria in these organisms.
Comparison of the mitochondrial genomes of Hemiselmis
andersenii and Rhodomonas salina
H. andersenii is only the second cryptophyte, after R. salina
[24], for which a mitochondrial genome has been completely sequenced and annotated. Comparative analyses
of the two genomes revealed a number of similarities.
Both genomes feature a compact gene arrangement and a
single large repeat region (Figure 1) [24], although the size
of the large intergenic region in H. andersenii (~20 Kbp) is

respectively. Additionally, while two group II introns are
present in R. salina mtDNA, the H. andersenii mtDNA is
devoid of introns (Table 2) [24].
With respect to conservation of gene order, 64.5% of the
shared genes between the two cryptophyte mitochondrial
genomes (40 out of 62 genes–36 protein-coding genes, 24
tRNA genes (see below), 2 rRNA genes) are present in thirteen syntenic blocks, each consisting of 2–7 genes. These
include: 1) cox1-cob-nad11, 2) nad4L-nad5, 3) atp1trnP(ugg), 4) rps8-rpl6-rps13-rps11, 5) trnC(gca)-atp6, 6)

eukaryotes and appear to be vestiges of bacterial operons.
Analysis using GRIMM [33] suggests that the observed difference in gene order between the two cryptophyte mitochondrial genomes can be explained by at least 31
instances of genome reversal events.
Repeat structure of the H. andersenii mitochondrial
genome
The R. salina mtDNA is characterized by a pair of ~1.5 Kbp
inverted repeats that are joined by 112 bp of sequence
[24]. In contrast, repeats in the H. andersenii mitochondrial genome are not inverted, but are instead dispersed or

arranged in tandem throughout the large non-coding
region, with individual repeat units ranging from 22 to
336 bp and occurring up to 100 times (Figure 2). Given
that R. salina and H. andersenii are distantly related to one
another [29], the large repeat region presumably arose
during or prior to the early diversification of cryptophytes.
While there is no obvious sequence similarity between the
two repeat regions, both contain multiple copies of palindromic sequences, which are predicted to form stable
stem-loop DNA structures [24]. In H. andersenii, two types
of stem-loop structures were identified–I and II–using the
DNA MFOLD program [28]. The Type I structure has two
slight variations, I-a and I-b, which occur 21 and 5 times,
respectively (Figures 2 and 3). Type I-a and I-b structures
have 22 and 20 base pairings in their stems, respectively,
and occur adjacent to tandem repeats (Figures 2 and 3).
One copy of the type II stem-loop structure is located
within a ~300 bp segment that is devoid of any discernable repeat units, but close to the high and low GC regions
noted earlier (Figures 2 and 3). As was suggested for R.
salina by Hauth et al. [24], tandem repeats and multiple
stem-loop structures in H. andersenii mtDNA might be
involved in the regulation of transcription and replication, a hypothesis that needs to be tested further.
Hauth et al. [24] demonstrated that the repeat region of
the R. salina mtDNA roughly coincides with a change in
the direction of 'cumulative GC skew' [calculated as (GC)/(G+C)] and suggested that the repeat corresponds to
the origin of replication. We investigated the GC skew in

genomes do not seem to be the result of replication-associated mutational bias, but rather the non-random distribution of the protein coding genes, as has been observed
in some other genomes [39]. Nevertheless, based on the
presence of other features such as stem-loop structures, it
seems reasonable to assume that the repeat region in both
cryptophyte mitochondrial genomes corresponds to the
origin of replication.
Codon usage and transfer RNAs
The H. andersenii mtDNA encodes 28 tRNAs, 27 of which
are predicted to form standard cloverleaf secondary structures. One tRNA gene, 'trnK(uuu)', shows atypical structure in the anticodon loop and the variable region, and is
probably a pseudogene (Figure 4A). Allowing for wobble
pairings and some base modifications, 26 tRNAs are the
theoretical minimum required to cover all codons in bacteria. For some mitochondria, even smaller sets of tRNAs,
as few as 22–23, are possible by adopting several additional strategies [40]. The H. andersenii mitochondrial
genome lacks only one tRNA gene, trnK(uuu), which is
minimally required in order to recognize all 61 codons
(Table 3). It is thus predicted that nuclear-encoded
cytosolic Lys-tRNA is imported into H. andersenii mitochondria. Mitochondrial tRNA import has been demonstrated in apicomplexans and trypanosomatids where
tRNA genes are completely missing in their mitochondrial
genomes [41], as well as in ciliates and plants where mitochondrial genomes encode fewer than the 22–23 minimally required tRNA genes [42]. Although most animals
and some fungi do not import tRNAs into mitochondria

[43], the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown
to import one specific cytosolic tRNA even though its
mitochondrial genome encodes the full complement of
tRNAs [44]. Analyses of the tRNA repertoire of mitochondrial genomes suggest that a number of other protist taxa
across the eukaryotic tree also import one or more tRNAs
into their mitochondria [43,45]. It is thus reasonable to
assume that H. andersenii imports at least Lys-tRNA,
although it is possible that tRNA editing makes up for the
Lys-tRNA deficit by changing the identity of an existing
tRNA, as has been shown in marsupials [46].
Another possible mechanism to account for the missing
tRNA is that the structurally abnormal 'trnK(uuu)' gene
(Figure 4A) forms a functional Lys-tRNA to decode the
codons AAA and AAG. Several cases of atypically-structured tRNAs are known from animal and ciliate mitochondria [47,48]. Interestingly, tRNAscan-SE [32]
predicted the existence of a 20 bp intron within the H.
andersenii 'trnK(uuu)', and we conducted further experiments to test whether this is indeed the case. RT-PCR
experiments using primer sets specific for 'trnK(uuu)' indicated that the putative intron was not removed in the
mature tRNA. This results is not unexpected, given that the
20-bp putative intron is too short to be a self-splicing
group I or II intron, which are the only known types of
introns reported in mitochondrial genomes [49].
Sequencing of ~20 clones also did not reveal any evidence
for RNA editing within the 'trnK(uuu)'. These results suggest that if 'trnK(uuu)' is indeed expressed to form a functional Lys-tRNA, it is predicted to have an unusually AU-

Predicted secondary structures for three homologous cryptophyte tRNAs.Hemiselmis andersenii 'trnK(uuu)' (A) is
paralogous to trnS(gcu) (B). Duplication and divergence of an ancestral trnS(gcu) appears to have led to the evolution of
'trnK(uuu)' in H. andersenii (A), which consequently, possesses an atypically long variable region. The anticodon loop and the variable region of 'trnK(uuu)' is AT-rich and the predicted stem regions consist entirely of A-T base pairings. Furthermore, the loop
of the anticodon loop/stem region is missing one nucleotide (arrow). These structural considerations suggest that 'trnK(uuu)'
may not be functional. The 'trnK(uuu)' gene in H. andersenii (A) is orthologous to trnS(gcu) in R. salina (C). Note that while
sequences within the anticodon loop, V-arm, and acceptor stem are divergent between the two orthologous copies, sequences
within the D loop and the T loop are conserved.

rich stem in the codon loop and a long variable region,
atypical for Lys-tRNA (Figure 4A). Long variable regions
ranging from 11 to 23 nucleotides are generally restricted
to tRNA-Leu, tRNA-Ser, and bacterial tRNA-Tyr [40]. The
D- and T-loops of the 'trnK(uuu)' sequence show sequence
similarity to one of the two mitochondrion-encoded
tRNA-Ser genes (Figure 4A and 4B), both of which have a
long variable region. In addition, comparative analysis
with the R. salina mtDNA revealed genomic position conservation between the H. andersenii trnS-like 'trnK(uuu)'
gene and the trnS(gcu) gene of R. salina, flanked by the
tatC and nad7 genes. The H. andersenii 'trnK(uuu)' and R.
salina trnS(gcu) genes both overlap tatC by 51 bp and 22
bp, respectively. This strongly suggests that the H. andersenii 'trnK(uuu)' is indeed derived from an ancestral gene
that encoded tRNA-Ser, explaining the origin of its long
variable region. The overlap between the H. andersenii
'trnK(uuu)' and tatC suggests that 'trnK(uuu)' may play a
role in processing the 3' end of the tatC gene transcript.
This hypothesis could explain why the 'trnK(uuu)' gene
still remains in the genome and retains conserved secondary structure in the stem loop and D- and T-loops, even if
it does not form a functional tRNA. Comprehensive
molecular and biochemical experimentation will be necessary to confirm or refute the existence of mitochondrial
tRNA import in H. andersenii and the functionality of the
unusual 'trnK(uuu)' gene.
When the H. andersenii tRNA genes were compared to
those of R. salina, 24 homologous pairs of tRNAs were
identified, leaving only four H. andersenii tRNA and three
R. salina tRNA genes not unambiguously matched to each
other. Each of the tRNA pairs possess identical anticodons
except for the H. andersenii 'trnK(uuu)' and R. salina
trnS(gcu) pair, despite their common derivation. The
trnS(gcu) of H. andersenii, having sequence homology to
the 'trnK(uuu)', probably originated from a recent gene
duplication event. Of the three remaining H. andersenii
tRNA genes that are unmatched in R. salina, two–trnL(gag)
and trnG(gcc)–are redundant because trnL(uag) and
trnG(ucc) can decode all of their respective four-codon
families [40]. These redundant copies might have been
lost in an ancestor of R. salina after it diverged from H.
andersenii. Lastly, the H. andersenii trnI(cau) is somewhat
similar to the trnK(uuu) of the R. salina and only marginally resembles the R. salina trnI(cau) at the 3' end. It is possible that the H. andersenii trnI(cau) originated through
recombination between ancestral trnI(cau) and trnK(uuu)
genes, which would explain the lack of an obvious
trnK(uuu) homolog in H. andersenii comparable to the R.
salina trnK(uuu). Substantial sequence divergence among
the three genes, however, makes it difficult to accurately
trace the origin of the trnI(cau) and the loss of the original
trnK(uuu) gene in H. andersenii. On the other hand, the
unusual trnI(uau) gene reported from R. salina is not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/215

found in H. andersenii. It was suggested that the R. salina
trnI(uau) is derived from trnF(uuc) through a recent gene
duplication event [24]. Overall, the two cryptophyte mitochondrial genomes use similar tRNA sets to recognize
codons. However, unlike H. andersenii, which may need to
import at least trnK(uuu) from cytosol, the R. salina
mtDNA does possess the minimal required set for tRNA
autonomy.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses
Cryptophytes are a well-established eukaryotic lineage,
supported by both molecular and morphological features
[20]. However, their relationship to other eukaryotic
groups, particularly those containing plastids of secondary endosymbiotic origin, has been the subject of considerable debate. The cryptophyte plastid is the product of a
secondary endosymbiosis involving a red algal cell, the
same process which accounts for plastid origins in haptophytes, dinoflagellates, and stramenopiles [50]. CavalierSmith [50] suggested that plastids in these four algal lineages arose from a single secondary endosymbiosis in a
common ancestor that these organisms shared, to the
exclusion of other eukaryotic groups. However, this "chromalveolate" hypothesis is controversial [51,52]. Recent
molecular studies have shown that the katablepharids, an
enigmatic collection of plastid-less flagellates, are a sister
group to cryptophytes [53,54], and large-scale concatenated analyses of nuclear genes suggest that cryptophytes
and haptophytes are also related [55,56].

To gain insight into the phylogenetic relationship of the
cryptophytes H. andersenii and R. salina to other eukaryotes, and more specifically, to test the hypothesis that cryptophytes and haptophytes are related to one another,
phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial protein sequences
were performed (Figure 5). Unlike the cryptophyte plastid
genome, in which several cases of LGT have recently been
discovered [57,58], individual analyses of 25 mitochondrial proteins did not reveal any obvious instances of LGT
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes or within eukaryotes
(data not shown). However, the possibility of ancient
LGTs cannot be ruled out, as the backbones of individual
protein phylogenies were generally very poorly supported.
As expected, a close relationship between the two cryptophytes H. andersenii and R. salina was well supported in
the mitochondrial protein phylogenies, with twenty of
twenty-five individual protein phylogenies showing this
relationship. Five individual gene phylogenies–nad2,
rpl14, rpl16, rps12, rps14–did not recover a H. andersenii-R.
salina clade, although alternative topologies were not supported with >50% bootstrap support values. Additionally,
single protein phylogenies were not, for the most part,
able to resolve the relationship of cryptophytes to other
eukaryotes. The position of cryptophytes was highly vari-

(cob). In summary, while mitochondrial gene sequences
are able to resolve some of the eukaryotic lineages determined using other markers, they are at present incapable

Conclusion
We have sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the
cryptophyte H. andersenii and compared it to that of the
distantly related cryptophyte R. salina. Our analyses reveal
that both genomes are characterized by a gene dense
region and a single large intergenic space that includes
numerous repeats and palindromic sequences predicted
to form stable DNA stem and loop structures. Despite the
overall similarities in content and architecture between
the two genomes, their modes of regulating DNA replication and transcription seem to differ. Unlike R. salina, all
73 genes in the H. andersenii mtDNA are located on the
same strand, a relatively rare observation in mitochondrial genomes. Phylogenic analysis of multiple mitochondrial gene sequences indicated a clear affiliation between
the two cryptophytes but was not able to resolve the position of cryptophytes relative to other eukaryotic groups.

We subsequently analyzed a set of 25 concatenated proteins to assess the phylogenetic position of cryptophytes.
In this analysis, the H. andersenii-R. salina clade received
100% bootstrap support (Figure 5). Other well-established eukaryotic groups including opisthokonts, rhodophytes, stramenopiles, and Viridiplantae, were also
strongly recovered, but the relationships among major
lineages were not. The jakobid Reclinomonas branched as
the sister group to the Viridiplantae with moderate support (89% bootstrap support), and Malawimonas showed
an affinity for these two groups in two of the three data
sets, as was previously inferred from a concatenate of ten
mitochondrial proteins [59]. It is not clear whether the
