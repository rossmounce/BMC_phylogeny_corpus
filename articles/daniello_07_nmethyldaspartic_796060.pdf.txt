Abstract
Background: NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) is a widely known agonist for a class of glutamate
receptors, the NMDA type. Synthetic NMDA elicits very strong activity for the induction of
hypothalamic factors and hypophyseal hormones in mammals. Moreover, endogenous NMDA has
been found in rat, where it has a role in the induction of GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone)
in the hypothalamus, and of LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and PRL (Prolactin) in the pituitary gland.
Results: In this study we show evidence for the occurrence of endogenous NMDA in the
amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum. A relatively high concentration of NMDA occurs in the
nervous system of this species (3.08 ± 0.37 nmol/g tissue in the nerve cord and 10.52 ± 1.41 nmol/
g tissue in the cephalic vesicle). As in rat, in amphioxus NMDA is also biosynthesized from Daspartic acid (D-Asp) by a NMDA synthase (also called D-aspartate methyl transferase).
Conclusion: Given the simplicity of the amphioxus nervous and endocrine systems compared to
mammalian, the discovery of NMDA in this protochordate is important to gain insights into the
role of endogenous NMDA in the nervous and endocrine systems of metazoans and particularly in
the chordate lineage.

Background
Synthetic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) is widely
known for its property to be an agonist of the L-glutamate
receptor of the NMDA-type. Among the three families of
glutamate receptor proteins identified, one is activated by
NMDA. The subunits of this receptor (NR1, NR2A, NR2B,
NR2C and NR2D of the ligand-gated ionic channels) are
collectively referred to as glutamate receptors of the
NMDA-type. Another receptor family, known as AMPAtype, is activated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-

isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and by kainate. The
third family of glutamate receptors consists of G-protein
coupled receptors, the so-called matabotropic receptors
(mGluR1-8) [1,2] for its widespread activity, among
which one of the most important is to induce hormone
release in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland [3-6].
NMDA was first isolated as endogenous compound in the
marine mollusk Scapharca brougtonii in 1987, by cation
exchange chromatography [7], and later by HPLC methods [8]. Recently, using a novel strategy consisting in the

purification of the tissue sample with o-phthaldialdehyde
(OPA) associated with an enzymatic HPLC method, we
demonstrated that NMDA is present in neuroendocrine
tissues of rat [9,10], of the protochordate Ciona intestinalis
[11] and in other animal phyla [12]. In addition, it has
been also demonstrated that endogenous NMDA is a molecule derived from D-aspartic acid (D-Asp), in which an
hydrogen atom of the amino group (NH2) at the alpha
carbon position of D-Asp is substituted by a methyl group

methyl transferase), according to the reaction in Figure

date's evolution, and in particular to distinguish between
conserved (potentially ancestral) and derived (potentially
novel) characteristics of vertebrates.

Amphioxus is an emerging animal model, situated in a
key phylogenetic position, as a descent of a chordate
ancestor. With vertebrates, amphioxus shares many body
plan characteristics such as a dorsal nerve cord, notochord, endostyle, segmental muscles, pharyngeal gill slits
and a post-anal tail. The genetic programs patterning the
amphioxus embryo are also similar to those of vertebrate
embryos, even if they are supported from a limited set of
genes. In fact, cephalochordates did not undergo the
extensive genome duplications that gave raise to more
complex pathways and the gene redundancy typical of
polyploid organisms, such as vertebrates.

Results

Noticeably, in the last few years the position of cephalochordates and tunicates has been reversed. In fact, an
accurate phylogenetic analysis of a large amount of
molecular data indicated that urochordates are the closest
relatives to vertebrates, while cephalochordates branched
earlier [13]. This change in the chordate phylogeny has
profound implications for the understanding of the evolution of body plans, and it may imply that the chordate
ancestor had a body plan organization similar to contemporary amphioxus.
Taking this into consideration, cephalochordates represent a valuable model organism in understanding chor-

Recently, we reported that the amphioxus nervous system
contains considerable amounts of free D-aspartic acid
[14]. Since in rat and in Ciona this amino acid constitutes
the precursor for the in vivo biosynthesis of NMDA [9-11],
in the present study we have designed approaches to
reveal if NMDA is also present in the amphioxus nervous
system and to know if this excitatory amino acid is biosynthesized from D-aspartic acid.

Purification of NMDA and HPLC determination
To determine specifically NMDA contained in an amphioxus homogenate, the sample was highly purified from
other amino acids and amino compounds, then the
NMDA content in the purified sample was determined by
HPLC. The purification of NMDA from a crude homogenate was an essential step in order to avoid interference by
the chromatographic peaks of other amino acids that
could overlap with the peak of methylamine, CH3NH2
(generated from the oxidation of NMDA with D-AspO).
In fact, after the sample has been purified with OPA,
almost 95–98% of all NMDA is purified from other compounds. The use of the D-aspartate oxidase for the determination of NMDA was another essential condition,
because NMDA as such does not react with OPA-mercaptoethanol to form a fluorescent complex. Therefore,
NMDA was first oxidized with D-AspO to form CH3NH2
and then treated with OPA-mercaptoethanol. In this way
the CH3NH2 reacts with OPA-mercaptoethanol giving a
fluorescent chromatographic peak. Figure 2 shows a typical example of NMDA determination from a pool of
amphioxus nerve cords. In panel A, an analysis of total
amino acids obtained from 2 mg of tissues is shown.
Panel B shows the same sample after OPA purification, in
this case almost all the amino acid peaks have disap-

peared. Furthermore, when the sample is treated with DAspO there is an increase of the peak at elution time of
about 12 min due to the formation of CH3NH2 derived
from the oxidation of NMDA (Fig. 2, panel C).

free amino acids at HPLC. C) The same sample as B, but

OPA-mercaptoethanol to give a well-defined sharp peak at
the end of the chromatogram at retention time 11.8–12.0
min.

The concentration of NMDA in the nervous tissue of several animals ranges normally between 1.4 and 7.6 nmol/
g of tissue, except for the cerebral ganglion of Ciona intestinalis, where NMDA occurs at considerably higher concentrations, 13.8 nmol/g of tissue (Table 2). Interestingly
also the amphioxus brain contains a very high NMDA
concentration (10.52 ± 1.41 nmol/g).
Biosynthesis of NMDA
In rat [7] and in ascidians [9] NMDA is biosynthesized
from D-aspartic acid, which represents the precursor
amino acid for the synthesis of this molecule, and SAM (SAdenosyl Metionine) as the methyl group donor. In this
study we carried out parallel experiments, finding a very
high NMDA biosynthetic activity when D-Asp was used as
substrate and when we used extracts from the same
amphioxus tissues in which NMDA was found endogenously (Table 3). In fact, the nerve cord and particularly
the brain were the tissues in which a higher amount of
NMDA was synthesized: 33.4 ± 4.30 and 45.5 ± 5.4 nmol/
g of tissue, respectively. However, muscular tissues show a
poor NMDA synthase activity (1.5 ± 0.4 nmol/g of tissue).
It seems, thus, that the amount of endogenous NMDA is
proportionally comparable with in vitro activity of Daspartate methyl transferase enzyme, able to transform
the D-aspartic residue into NMDA.

In order to know if only D-Asp constitutes the NMDA precursor molecule, several different amino acids, in both Dand L-conformation, were used as potential substrate in
the same reaction conditions as previously described for
D-Asp (Table 3). The results obtained demonstrate that,
except for D-Asp, no other amino acid is able to act as precursor for the synthesis of NMDA.

Discussion
We recently found that the neural system of amphioxus
contains a considerable amount of D-aspartic acid,
approximately 280 nmol/g of tissue [14]. In the present
work we found in the nervous system of B. lanceolatum a
considerable quantity of NMDA in different regions
(nerve cord and brain) similar to that found in the cerebral ganglion of Ciona intestinalis (Tables 1 and 2). In
addition, as occurs in rat and in urochordates, NMDA is
synthesized also in amphioxus from D-Asp by a SAMdependent NMDA synthase, which transports a methyl
group from SAM to D-Asp, transforming it into NMDA
(Table 3). Thus, as in other animals, a biological pathway
for the endogenous production of NMDA seems to exist
in amphioxus.
Recently, we also demonstrated that NMDA is present in
the rat neuroendocrine system, in C. intestinalis and in
other animal phyla [9-12]. Synthetic NMDA is well
known for its stimulating action on the NMDA-type Lglutamate receptors. In addition to having this effect,
NMDA is also known for inducing hormone release in the
hypothalamus and hypophysis. In fact, already back in
1978, Price and collaborators found that a very low
amount of NMDA injected into the rat increased LH levels
[3]. After that, Gay and colleagues [5] found that NMD/LA
(N-methyl-D/L-aspartic acid) elicits hypothalamic gonadotropic release in the Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta),
and Downing and colleagues [6] observed that a minute
quantity of NMD/LA injected into the ewe induced the
release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from
the hypothalamus, and growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) from the pituitary gland. It has also been demonstrated that in rat synthetic NMDA is able to elicit the
release of LH and PRL [9,10].
In addition, an elevation of testosterone and progesterone
concentration in rat has been observed as a consequence
of the LH increase [9]. The same phenomenon has been
shown to occur in C. intestinalis [11]. In tunicates, interestingly, D-Asp is present in the cerebral ganglion while

NMDA is present in the neural gland. NMDA is synthesized in the neural gland from D-Asp as precursor and in
turn it induces the release of the GnRH. Then, GnRH
reaches the gonads where it induces the synthesis and
release of testosterone and progesterone. Thus, in both
mammals and in the protochordate Ciona intestinalis,
NMDA is involved in hormone production and activity
[11]. Although our data do not allow to ascertain the functional effects of NMDA in amphioxus physiology or endocrine system, its high concentration in the brain area is
suggestive of it, and indicates that NMDA-driven actions
most probably predated chordate evolution.

Conclusion
The presence of NMDA primarily in the cephalic vesicle of
the amphioxus B. lanceolatum led us to argue that in
cephalochordates NMDA may have a role in both nervous
and endocrine systems. Thus, as in mammals and in tunicates, where D-Asp and NMDA are implicated in the
development and function of the neuroendocrine system,
it is reasonable to suggest that the presence of D-Asp and
NMDA in the nervous system of the amphioxus gives support to the concept that modern vertebrates and cephalochordates share a common chordate ancestor, in which DAsp and NMDA neurotransmission could play a relevant
function in the neuroendocrine system. Although data in
other deuterostomes (echinoderms and hemichordates)
are not available, the presence of NMDA in the nervous
system of several mollusks may indicate that NMDAderived neurotransmission could even be a more general
character of Bilateria.

Methods

Adult amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum were collected in the bay of Argelès-sur-Mer (southern coast of
France) in January 2007 as described in Fuentes et al.,
2007 [15]. Adult animals were kept for a week before dissection in glass tanks in the laboratory at a water temperature of 15°C and a 10/14 day-night light cycle
(corresponding to natural conditions). Filtered seawater

Specimens were dissected under an optic microscope
using a micro-fine knife with a 4 mm cutting edge (F.S.T.)
on ice. No anaesthetic was used to immobilize the animals, in order to avoid drug-induced alterations in the
measurement of NMDA. All salts, amino acids, OPA (ophthaldialdehyde), NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) and other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. The Sep-Pak® ODS C18 (octadecylsilyl-C18) cartridges were purchased from Waters Corporation, Milford,
MA, USA.

Tissue homogenization and purification of NMDA from
other amino acids and amino compounds
Nerve cord, brain and muscle tissues were obtained from
adults' animals and divided in five pools (each pool containing tissue from 20 animals). Samples were homogenized in 0.1 M TCA (trichloroacetic acid) in a ratio of 1:10
and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatants were purified to separate NMDA from other free
amino acids and amino compounds. The sample purification was necessary to avoid interference of the NMDA
peak by the peaks of other amino acids or amino compounds at HPLC. The principle of purification was based
on the fact that free amino acids and amino compounds
react with OPA (o-phthaldialdehyde) to give a complex

"amino acid-OPA" which, if passed on an ODS-C18 SepPak cartridge, binds strongly to the resin. NMDA instead,
since it does not possess a primary amino group (NH2),
does not react with OPA, therefore it does not form a complex with OPA and passes through the ODS-C18 column in
purified form [9-12]. Briefly, the procedure is the following: 0.3 ml of TCA supernatant of tissue homogenate, as
obtained above, is brought to pH 9.5 with 0.1 M NaOH
and then mixed with 100 µl of 0.1 M sodium borate-boric
acid buffer, pH 9.5 (to stabilize the pH), 20 µl of 1 M OPA
and 2 µl of mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at
37°C to complete the formation of the "OPA-amino
acids" complex. After incubation, the mixture is brought
to pH 8.2 with 0.1 M HCl and passed through an ODS-C18
cartridge containing about 800 mg of resin (the Sep-Pak
had been previously regenerated by treatment with 10 ml
of methanol and washed with 10 ml of distilled water).
After the sample has been loaded on the cartridge, the eluent is collected. The cartridge is washed with 5 ml distilled
water and this last eluent is pooled with the previous eluent and dried in a Petri dish, placed on a warm plate at
40–50°C and under aspiration in a hood until dried. The
residue is dissolved in 0.3 ml distilled water and used for
the HPLC determination of NMDA.
Determination of NMDA by enzymatic HPLC method
This method is based on the measurement by HPLC of
CH3NH2 (methylamine), which is generated by the oxidation of NMDA with D-aspartate oxidase (D-AspO) according to the reaction in Figure 3[9-11].

The CH3NH2 formed is then treated with OPA-mercaptoethanol to generate a fluorescent compound and analyzed by HPLC. The method is specific for NMDA since
the purified beef kidney D-AspO oxidizes only D-Asp and
NMDA [16-18] and only NMDA can generate CH3NH2
when NMDA is oxidized by the D-AspO [7,8]. Briefly, the
procedure is as follows: 100 µl of purified sample is mixed
with 50 µl of 0.2 M borate buffer, pH 8.2, and 5 µl of purified D-AspO (1–2 mg/ml; 200–300 U/ml) [16-18] and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, 100 µl of
0.1 M sodium borate buffer, pH 10.0, and 5.0 µl of OPAmercaptoethanol reagent (20 mg of OPA plus 40 µl of 2mercaptoethanol in 2 ml of methanol) are added and
mixed. After 2 min, 100 µl of this mixture is injected into
an ODS-C18 Supelcosil column (µ 5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/109

connected to a Beckman-Gold HPLC system and to a fluorescence detector with excitation wavelength 330 nm
and emission wavelength 450 nm. The column is eluted
at 1.2 ml/min with a gradient consisting of 2 mobile
phases, A and B. Solvent A consists of: 920 ml of double
distilled water, 50 ml acetonitrile and 30 ml of 1.0 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.3 (final pH 5.6). Solvent B
consists of: 900 ml acetonitrile and 100 ml double distilled water. The column is equilibrated with solvent A
and then the following gradient program is carried out: 0–
30% B over 3 min; 30–70% B over 11 min; 70–100% B
over 4 min, 100% B for 4 min and return to 0% B in 1
min. The CH3-NH2 elutes as a sharp peak at the retention
time of 11.8–12.0 min.
In the same way they are carried out a blank sample, a general standard and a general blank. The blank sample is
prepared as the sample, but no D-AspO was added. The
standard is prepared using 100 µl of NMDA at a concentration of 0.01 nmol/ml instead of the sample. The general blank is prepared using 100 µl of distilled water
instead of the sample.
D-Aspartate oxidase
D-Aspartate oxidase (D-AspO: EC 1.4.3.1) is an oxidative
enzyme, which specifically catalyzed the oxidation of only
the dicarboxylic amino acids in D-form (D-Asp, D-Glu
and NMDA). However, it has been shown that the purified enzyme obtained from beef kidney oxidizes primarily
D-Asp and NMDA and only minimally D-Glu (D-Glu is
oxidized in a ratio of 2–3% compared to D-Asp or
NMDA). On the other hand, the purified D-AspO
obtained from the hepatopancreas of the mollusc Octopus
vulgaris oxidizes only D-Asp and D-Glu, and only minimally NMDA (4–6% compared to D-Asp or D-Glu [1618]). In this study we have used purified beef kidney Daspartate oxidase obtained by recombinant expression in
E. coli according to the described procedure [16].
Biosynthesis of NMDA
Recently, we reported that the amphioxus nervous system
contains considerable amounts of free D-aspartic acid
[14]. Since this amino acid constitutes the precursor for
the in vivo biosynthesis of NMDA [9-11], in the present
study we have designed experiments to reveal if NMDA is
biosynthesized from D-Asp in the amphioxus nervous sys-

tem. To verify this, we used the described procedure [9]
modified as follows: pools of nerve cord, cephalic vesicle/
hindbrain and muscle, obtained from 10 animals were
homogenized with 200 µl of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH
7.5, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 100
µl of the supernatant was incubated with 10 µl of 0.2 M
D-Asp (used as precursor for the biosynthesis of NMDA)
and with 10 µl of 10 mM SAM (S-AdenosylMethionine,
used as methyl group donor) for 2 h at 37°C. A blank
sample was carried out in the same way as the sample, but
without D-Asp. After incubation, the sample was mixed
with 200 µl of 0.2 M TCA and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 5 min. The supernatant was neutralized with 0.1 M
NaOH and was subjected to the purification of NMDA by
using the above method for the determination of NMDA
by HPLC. In the same assay conditions other amino acids
(L-Asp, D-Glu, L-Glu, D-Ala, L-Ala, D-Ser, L-Ser and Gly)
instead of D-Asp were used.
