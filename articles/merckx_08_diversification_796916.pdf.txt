Abstract
Background: Myco-heterotrophy evolved independently several times during angiosperm
evolution. Although many species of myco-heterotrophic plants are highly endemic and longdistance dispersal seems unlikely, some genera are widely dispersed and have pantropical
distributions, often with large disjunctions. Traditionally this has been interpreted as evidence for
an old age of these taxa. However, due to their scarcity and highly reduced plastid genomes our
understanding about the evolutionary histories of the angiosperm myco-heterotrophic groups is
poor.
Results: We provide a hypothesis for the diversification of the myco-heterotrophic family
Burmanniaceae. Phylogenetic inference, combined with biogeographical analyses, molecular
divergence time estimates, and diversification analyses suggest that Burmanniaceae originated in
West Gondwana and started to diversify during the Late Cretaceous. Diversification and migration
of the species-rich pantropical genera Burmannia and Gymnosiphon display congruent patterns.
Diversification began during the Eocene, when global temperatures peaked and tropical forests
occurred at low latitudes. Simultaneous migration from the New to the Old World in Burmannia
and Gymnosiphon occurred via boreotropical migration routes. Subsequent Oligocene cooling and
breakup of boreotropical flora ended New-Old World migration and caused a gradual decrease in
diversification rate in Burmanniaceae.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that extant diversity and pantropical distribution of mycoheterotrophic Burmanniaceae is the result of diversification and boreotropical migration during the
Eocene when tropical rain forest expanded dramatically.

Background
Myco-heterotrophic plants present a number of unique
challenges to those who are trying to understand their
diversification and distribution. Many myco-heterotrophic plant species are rare and have very limited distribution ranges [1-4]. Their tiny, dust-like, seeds are
assumed to be dispersed by wind or rainsplash [5]. This
strategy seems ineffective for long-distance dispersal particularly because most species grow on the forest floor of
dense primary rain forests. Furthermore their occurrence
seems limited by their interaction with specific arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi, from which they obtain their organic
carbon [6,7]. Paradoxally, some myco-heterotrophic genera are widely distributed often with remarkable disjunctions. Examples are Sciaphila (Triuridaceae), Burmannia
and Gymnosiphon (Burmanniaceae), Thismia (Thismiaceae), Voyria (Gentianaceae) and Monotropa (Ericaceae), which all occur both in the New and the Old
World [5]. While the disjunct distribution of Voyria has
been interpreted as a result of a long-distance dispersal
event [8], the widespread distributions of Sciaphila, Burmannia, Gymnosiphon, and Thismia were traditionally
explained as an indication for a great antiquity, allowing
vicariance explanation of the observed patterns [5,9,10].
This would imply that these genera originated before the
breakup of western Gondwana, about 90–105 million
years ago (Mya) [11,12]. A recent molecular dating analysis on monocots would not refute the western Gondwana
vicariance hypothesis for Burmanniaceae (including Thismiaceae), as the stem and crown nodes of the family were
estimated at 116 and 93 Mya respectively [13]. These dates
would roughly put the relevant divergences in a Late Cretaceous timeframe, in particular when considering the
generally large confidence intervals associated with
molecular dating experiments in flowering plants [14].
The results of Janssen and Bremer [13], however, were
based on 14 species of Dioscoreales, only three of which
belong to the Burmanniaceae. Poor taxon sampling is one
of the sources of error in molecular dating, though the
effect of undersampling may depend on the method used
to accommodate for rate variation [14-16].
The fossils used to calibrate the tree are another possible
source of error in molecular dating [17]. Ambiguously
interpretable morphology may result in the calibration of
an erroneous node, and uncertain age of fossil-bearing
rock may give rise to inaccurate dates [17,18]. Burmanniaceae are absent from the fossil record. A common
approach in similar cases is to apply secondary calibration, i.e. use ages derived from other molecular dating
estimates. This approach has been criticized for generating
large confidence intervals [19]. We choose to rigorously
expand our taxon sampling, including all monocot lineages, to estimate branch lengths based on one of the most
widely available markers (18S rDNA), and to constrain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/178

the phylogeny to the most accurate phylogenetic hypotheses available in the literature. The date estimates of this
single gene approach are compared with a Bayesian
relaxed clock phylogenetic analysis [20] that uses secondary calibrations on a multi-gene Burmanniaceae dataset.
In this study we attempt to elucidate the diversification
and biogeographic history of one of the most species-rich
clades of myco-heterotrophic plants, the Burmanniaceae,
by analyzing a thoroughly sampled data set containing
nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data. The family
consists of seven species-poor Neotropical genera and two
species-rich genera with a pantropical distribution (Burmannia and Gymnosiphon). While the pantropical distributions of many angiosperm groups were traditionally
interpreted as a result of tectonic vicariance, recent molecular dating studies have lead to a revival of long-distance
dispersal theories [21,22]. Most recent studies on disjunct
dispersal patterns between the Old and the New World of
angiosperm families have strongly rejected vicariance as
an explanation for the observed biogeographic pattern
(e.g. Malpighiaceae [23], Rapateaceae and Bromeliaceae
[24], Sapotaceae [25], Burseraceae [26], Melastomataceae
[27], Moraceae 28], Meliaceae [18], Renealmia [29].

Results
Phylogenetic analyses
The three data partitions comprised the following numbers of taxa and characters: (1) 18S rDNA with 51 accessions, 1694 characters, and 222 parsimony-informative
characters; (2) nad1 b-c intron with 49 accessions, 1645
characters, and 275 parsimony-informative characters
plus Simple Indel Coding of the gaps adding 112 parsimony-informative characters; (3) ITS with 47 accessions,
598 characters, and 372 parsimony-informative characters.

One of the six most parsimonious trees (tree length 4215;
CI 0.522; RI 0.687) recovered during the parsimony analysis on the combined data is shown in Figure 1. No significant difference was observed between the maximum
parsimony strict consensus tree and the Bayesian 50%
majority-rule consensus tree. Most clades are well-supported (≥85% bootstrap support/≥95% Bayesian posterior probability). A well-supported clade with two
samples of Burmannia congesta and Campylosiphon is sister
to all other Burmanniaceae. Consequently, Burmannia is a
paraphyletic genus. The neotropical genus Dictyostega is
sister to the rest of the ingroup. Apteria is sister to the core
Burmannia clade. Within the core Burmannia species B.
sphagnoides is sister to the other species, consisting of two
neotropical, two African, one Madagascan, and three East
Asian clades. Hexapterella is sister to Gymnosiphon. Cymbocarpa is embedded in the Gymnosiphon clade. This clade

consists of three neotropical, one East Asian, and two African lineages.
Molecular dating
The 50% majority-rule consensus tree of the constrained
Bayesian analysis of the 18S rDNA monocot dataset with
optimized branch lengths is shown in Figure 2. The age
estimations with their standard deviations and credibility
intervals obtained for the monocot orders Acorales, Alismatales, Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales,
Asparagales, Arecales, Zingiberales, Commelinales, and
Poales are listed in Table 1. The stem-node age of the Burmanniaceae is estimated to 116 ± 2.6 Mya, the crown
node to 96 ± 3.37 Mya. The Burmanniaceae clade clipped
from the r8s chronogram of the monocots is shown in Figure 3. The crown and stem age estimates of the Burmanniaceae were used as secondary calibration points for the
multigene analysis with BEAST. The chronogram resulting
from this analysis is also shown in Figure 3.
Tempo of diversification
We measured a negative γ value for our chronogram (γ = 6.51), which rejects the hypothesis that rates of lineage
accumulation in Burmanniaceae remained constant over
time, in favour of a decrease of speciation rate through
time [30]. Simulations indicate that with a sample of 41
species for the γ-statistic to yield – 6.51 when the true
value is zero, there would need to be 562 species of Burmanniaceae (95% CI: 139–1708) (Figure 4). We can
therefore reject the possibility that the negative γ-value is
the result of a poor sampling artefact.
Lineage-through-time plot
A semilogarithmic lineage-through-time (LTT) plot (Figure 5) shows a trend toward reduced diversification rates
beginning ≈72 Mya (Late Cretaceous), and an Eocene
increase of diversification rate. A model of gradual change
in diversification rate (model B, γ = 1.65, AIC = 360.15)
was chosen over model A (AIC = 371.05) and model C
(AIC = 391.02) as best fit of the empirical LTT plot using
AIC. Model B was preferred no matter which timing of an
abrupt rate shift in model C was specified. The hLRT
showed significant difference between model A and B (P
= 0.0004), while there was no significant difference
between model A and C.

Significant diversification rate shifts were detected in two
branches by the Δ1, Δ2, and the Slowinski and Guyer (SG)
statistic (Figure 5, branches 1 and 2). The relative cladogenesis (RC) test identified four different branches with
rate shifts (Figure 5, branches 3–6). The shifts identified
by RC should be treated with caution as the RC test is sensitive to temporal depth, phylogenetic scope, and the nonindependence of diversification rate shifts [31].

Analysis of ancestral areas
The optimal solutions obtained with the DIVA analysis
calculated three equally likely possibilities for the distribution of the most recent common ancestor of the Burmanniaceae: 1) the Amazonian Region; 2) the GuineoCongolean and Amazonian Region; 3) the Amazonian
and Brazilian Region. Thus despite the lack of resolution
to precisely identify the ancestral area of Burmanniaceae,
the analysis indicates it was western Gondwanan. According to the second DIVA analysis seven New-Old World
dispersals are required to explain the distribution of the
terminals. But again, the ancestral area of Burmanniaceae
cannot be tracked solely to the paleotropics or neotropics
(Figure 1). We assigned seven nodes that may represent
dispersal or vicariance events between the neotropics and
the paleotropics (Figure 3). Due to the ambiguous optimization of the ancestral areas events 2 and 3 could equally
likely be placed on adjacent deeper nodes yet this would
still place these events in the same geological epoch.

Discussion
Divergence time estimates
The araceous fossil Mayoa portugallica [32] was identified
as the most inconsistent calibration point relative to the
other calibration points and was therefore not used in the
PL analysis, which estimated the node at 64 Mya or 42%
younger than suggested by fossil data. This observation
does not necessary imply that the fossil was assigned to a
wrong node. There are many possible explanations for
this result (for example, error in branch length estimation,
failure of the rate smoothing method to comply with the
18S rDNA rate heterogeneity, underestimation of the true
age by the other fossils as a result of an incomplete fossil
record) [17,33]. A rerun of the PL analysis revealed that
calibration point A had hardly any impact on the age estimations of the Burmanniaceae. With calibration point A
included Burmanniaceae age estimations were overall less
than 1% older (results not shown). Apparently the long
phylogenetic distance of calibration point A from the Burmanniaceae clade or the influence of calibration points in
more closely related clades reduces the impact of this calibration point.

The obtained divergence time estimations of the monocot
orders, using a different marker (18S rDNA instead of
rbcL) and considerably fewer taxa, are mostly younger
than those published by Janssen and Bremer ([13] see also
Table 1). For most orders these differences in age estimations are small. However, the estimations of both crown
and stem nodes of some more derived orders (Arecales,
Commelinales, and Zingiberales) are considerably
younger than those of Janssen and Bremer [13] (Table 1).
We attempted to sample the earliest-diverging lineages of
each order as well as some more derived taxa. But the
much lower taxon sampling in our study compared to the

more than 800 terminals in Janssen and Bremer [13] is
likely to have caused an overestimation of the branch that
subtends the indicated clades (or underestimation of the
branches within these clades) and as a result has led to
underestimation of the ages of the crown nodes [15,16].
The stem and crown node ages of Dioscoreales are consistent with a recent estimate that used a similar calibration
strategy on a two-gene dataset (18S rDNA and atpA) but
with fewer taxa [34].
In general the use of secondary calibration points for
divergence time estimates is not favored [35]. However,
this strategy becomes more sound when the error associated with molecular dating estimates can be transferred

into the subsequent divergence time analysis. Here this is
coupled with the advantage of accommodating unlinked
rate variation across all available loci (a 'multigene'
approach). Not unexpectedly, the BEAST analysis results
in a chronogram with slightly less branch length heterogeneity than the PL chronogram. 18S rDNA sequences alone
do not support a fully resolved Burmanniaceae clade. Artificially resolved clades (by constraints) will result in short
branch lengths and more compressed divergence patterns
if the data provides insufficient phylogenetic signal to
support these clades. This effect seems limited here: the
age estimations of the BEAST analysis are not significantly
different from those inferred by PL (Figure 3). Node 1

intervals on both estimates are large and overlapping.
Biogeography and diversification of Burmanniaceae
This study points towards a West Gondwanan origin of
Burmanniaceae. According to our results the family
started to diversify 96.4 Mya (mid-Cretaceous), well
before the K/T boundary. The diversification rate shift
tests and the LTT plot suggest a high initial diversification
rate. Mid-Cretaceous climate was relatively warm [36]
although fossil data suggests tropical forests were open
and dry adapted and modern closed-canopy rain forest
did not originate until after the K/T boundary [37]. However, recent molecular studies suggest that closed-canopy
rain forest existed during the mid-Cretaceous [38]. The
most recent common ancestor of Burmanniaceae was
photosynthetic (see further) and it is possible that initial
diversification of the family started when Burmanniaceae
lineages became parasitic on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
as an adaptation to shaded habitats [39]. The separation
between South America and Africa has been dated to 105
Mya [12], but the biogeographical timing of this conti-

nental breakup is somewhat uncertain because it is
unclear when an effective dispersal barrier was established
[40]. Furthermore, stepping-stone dispersal routes
between South America and Africa may have delayed biogeographical isolation into the Late Cretaceous [41].
Because the Burmannia congesta-Campylosiphon clade is the
earliest-diverging lineage in Burmanniaceae one proposed
ancestral area of the family includes both neotropics and
paleotropics (Figure 1). Under this assumption the separation between Africa and South America is likely to be
reflected in the divergence time hypotheses. While such a
vicariance event is indeed suggested by the direct dating
approach with PL (node 1 = 94 Mya), BEAST analysis
favours an Eocene divergence (node 1 = 47 Mya). Due to
the large error associated with both estimates none of the
hypotheses can be rejected. A Cretaceous continental drift
scenario thus could explain the split between B. congesta
and Campylosiphon, however, such a vicariance event has
been observed only rarely in flowering plants [42-44].
Contrasting this hypothesis, an Eocene boreotropical
migration scenario (see further) would be an equally possible explanation for the disjunction observed in node 1.
The DIVA analysis supports a neotropical origin for the

The relationship between γ and the proportion of extant taxa in Burmanniaceae (f)
The relationship between γ and the proportion of extant taxa in Burmanniaceae (f). We sampled 41 species of
Burmanniaceae and measured a γ-value of -6.51 using the BEAST chronogram (blue dotted line). To explore the effects of missing lineages we generated γ-statistic values under the assumption that our sampling n (n = 41) represents only a proportion (f)
of the extant Burmanniaceae species. The three curves show the mean, 0.975 percentile, and 0.025 percentile of the γ-distribution. This distribution was constructed by calculating γ of 1000 simulated pure-birth phylogenies with n/f tips, each randomly
pruned to 41 tips, for values of f ranging from 0.018 to 0.5. To measure a γ-value of -6.51 using 41 taxa while the actual value is
not significantly different from zero, Burmanniaceae should contain 562 lineages (95% CI: 139–1708). Currently 92 Burmanniaceae species are known [60].
clade containing all other Burmanniaceae lineages. The
Malaysian species, Burmannia sphagnoides branched off
from its neotropical predecessors 75 Mya (PL) – 72 Mya
(BEAST) ago (Figure 3, node 2). Migration between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Cretaceous could have been
possible through land connections allowing the interchange of taxa between South America, India, and Madagascar [12,45,46]. Furthermore, India may have acted as a
raft that transported some taxa from Madagascar to Asia
[47]. Both phenomena together could well explain the
biogeographical history of B. sphagnoides.
The Late Cretaceous and Paleocene are characterized by a
decrease in diversification rates (Figure 5). This slowdown
may have resulted from decreased origination rates (e.g.
filling ecological niches, [48]), and/or from increased

extinction rates. The latter hypothesis is coincident with
the occurrence of the K/T mass-extinction [49,50]. A subsequent increase of the diversification rate, associated
with the diversification Burmannia and Gymnosiphon,
occurred at the Late Paleocene and through the Eocene.
Simultaneously lineages of both genera reached the Old
World (Figure 3). These events are well correlated with a
boreotropical dispersal scenario as proposed for other
tropical angiosperm families [18,23,25-28]. According to
this scenario South American taxa of Burmannia and Gymnosiphon are hypothesized to have migrated via scattered,
continental and/or volcanic islands that connected North
and South America at various times during the Tertiary
[23]. From North America migration across Laurasia in to
the Old World could continue via a series of connections
across the North Atlantic ('North Atlantic Land Bridge'

[23,51]. Further diversification into Africa, Madagascar,
and Asia would explain the current distribution patterns
of these genera. Laurasian migration of tropical groups
was facilitated by warm and humid climates that occurred
during the Eocene [52]. Particularly at the beginning of
the Eocene global temperatures peaked and plants with
tropical affinities grew at middle and high latitudes
[53,54]. This is also the reason why an eastern migration
through Beringia, which did not support tropical vegetation, seems unlikely [23,26]. Significant cooling during
the Oligocene caused a retraction of the boreotropical
flora from across the North Atlantic [55]. This cooling,
which started at the end of the Eocene [51], probably
caused a 'climatic' vicariance in Burmannia and Gymnosiphon: as both distributions moved southwards they
became separated into New and Old World groups (Figure 3, nodes 5 and 7). According to our results, no migration between the neotropics and paleotropics occurred for
the remaining ≈30 My, illustrating the limited long-distance dispersal capabilities of Burmanniaceae species.
Simultaneously with the Oligocene cooling the LTT plot
shows the start of a gradual decrease of the diversification
rate towards the present. An overall decrease in lineage
accumulation for Burmanniaceae is also suggested by the
CR test.
Loss of chlorophyll
One of the most intriguing features of Burmanniaceae is
the absence of chlorophyll in most taxa, except for some
Burmannia species. Almost nothing is known about the
chloroplast genome in achlorophyllous Burmanniaceae
or myco-heterotrophic plants in general. Studies on the
chloroplast genome of parasitic plants reported the loss of
most chloroplast genes [56,57]. If we assume that the
chloroplast genes in myco-heterotrophic Burmanniaceae
undergo the same fate, then a reversal to autotrophy
seems highly improbable. With this assumption, at least
eight independent losses of chlorophyll took place in Burmanniaceae (Figure 5). As each lineage may have lost its
chlorophyll independently, it is difficult to speculate
about the age of these events. According to a most-parsimonious pattern, the ancestral lineage leading to the Gymnosiphon-Hexapterella clade lost its photosynthesis during
the Late Cretaceous. The evolution from a mycorrhizal
photosynthetic plant towards a non-photosynthetic
myco-heterotroph has been explained as a phenomenon
that can provide escape from competitive exclusion in the
shaded conditions of forest understory habitats [39]. A
Late Cretaceous origin of myco-heterotrophy thus provides evidence for the presence of closed-canopy environments before the K/T boundary [38]. The chlorophyll
losses in the core Burmannia clade would have occurred
during the Eocene and the Oligocene, when closed-canopy rain forest was abundant even at low latitudes
[53,58]. While Burmannia species seem to have lost their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/178

chlorophyll after crossing the North Atlantic Land Bridge,
a single loss event in the Gymnosiphon clade would have
occurred before their Laurasian migration. This result suggests that achlorophyllous plant species were able to
migrate and diversify long after their adaptation to a
myco-heterotrophic nutrition strategy.

Conclusion
In his excellent monograph of the Burmanniaceae Jonker
[10] wrote: "Fossil Burmanniaceae are unknown. The
family however is very old, according to the occurrence of
closely related species in America, Africa, and Asia [...]".
Our analyses reveal that Burmanniaceae are a relatively
old family, and vicariance events possibly influenced the
early diversification of the family. Our study also suggests
that the diversification and radiation of the pantropical
genera Burmannia and Gymnosiphon started from South
America during the Eocene when continental drift had
separated South America from Africa. The global temperature during that epoch was high enough to allow tropical
rain forests to expand significantly. This triggered an
increased diversification in Burmannia and Gymnosiphon
and allowed for boreotropical migration across the North
Atlantic Ocean in to the Old World for both genera. Our
results imply that the increase of neotropical plant diversity during the Eocene [58] and the boreotropical migration of tropical plants [23-29] also applies to mycoheterotrophic plants.

Methods
Molecular data
This study samples 41 species of Burmanniaceae, covering
seven of the nine genera [10,59,60]. Only the monospecific neotropical genera Marthella and Miersiella are not
represented. For Burmannia our sampling includes 23 of
the approximately 60 described species (38%), for Gymnosiphon 12 species of 24 known species were available
(50%) [60]. With species from the New World, Africa, and
Asia our sampling covers the current geographic distribution range of both genera. For the phylogenetic inference
of Burmanniaceae, sequence data of Pandanus tectorius
(Pandanales) were used as outgroup. Herbarium vouchers
and GenBank accessions for the taxa used in this study are
listed in Additional file 1.

Sequence data of 18S rDNA and nad1 b-c from a previous
study [61] were supplemented with additional sequences.
For most species ITS data was obtained using the following protocol. DNA was extracted from silica dried and herbarium material with the PureGene DNA extraction kit
(Gentra Systems, Landgraaf, The Netherlands) following
the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear 18S rDNA
region and the mitochondrial nad1 b-c intron were amplified following Merckx et al. [61]. Amplification of the
nuclear ITS region was carried out with the primers ITS1

and ITS4 [62], with a premelt of 5 min at 94°C, followed
by 30 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94°C, 30 s annealing at 55°C, 1 min extension at 72°C, and a 7 min final
extension at 72°C. All PCR products were cleaned with
the Nucleospin Extract II columns (Machery-Nagel,
Düren, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions.
Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 310 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Fostercity, USA). Some
samples were sequenced by the Macrogen sequencing
facilities (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). Sequencing
files were edited and assembled using Staden for Mac OS
X [63].
Due to contamination with fungal DNA no ITS data could
be obtained for three taxa: Burmannia sphagnoides, Gymnosiphon suaveolens, and G. panamensis. In the nad1 b-c
dataset sequences of B. nepalensis and C. saccata are missing. The nad1 b-c sequence of C. saccata (DQ786096) was
not used as this sequence probably belongs to a Gymnosiphon species.
Alignment was done by eye using MacClade 4.04 [64].
Gaps in the nad1 b-c intron data were coded using the simple indel coding method (SIC; [65]) as implemented in
SeqState [66]. Autapomorphic indel characters were manually removed from the dataset.
Phylogenetic analyses
Molecular data were analyzed using maximum parsimony
and Bayesian methods. Each of the three data partitions
(18S rDNA, ITS, and nad1 b-c [including indel characters]) was analyzed separately. Since no strongly supported (>85% bootstrap percentage/>95% Bayesian
posterior probability) incongruences were observed
between the topologies, combined analyses of the molecular data were performed. Maximum parsimony (MP)
analyses were done with PAUP* v4b10 [67] using a heuristic search with the TBR branch swapping algorithm for
1,000 replicates, holding 5 trees at each step and with the
Multrees option in effect. Branch stability was calculated
using a bootstrap analysis with 1,000 pseudo-replicates.
For each replicate a heuristic search was conducted with
the same settings as described above. Model selection for
the Bayesian analyses was done using Modeltest v3.06
[68]. For all tree genes Modeltest selected the GTR+I+G
model. For the indel data we selected the restriction site
model as recommended in the MrBayes 3.1 manual [69].
The combined analyses were performed with a partitioned
model approach. Bayesian analyses were run on the K.U.
Leuven UNIX cluster ('VIC') using MrBayes 3.1.2 [70,71].
Each analysis was run three times for three million generations sampling every 1,000 generations. The first 50% of
the sampled trees were treated as burnin and discarded.
The sump command in MrBayes was used to check
whether the two separate analyses converged on similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/178

log-likelihoods. Additionally convergence of the chains
was checked using TRACER 1.4 [72] and the effective sampling size (ESS) parameter was found to exceed 100,
which suggests acceptable mixing and sufficient sampling.
Divergence time estimation
Burmanniaceae and Dioscoreales in general are absent
from the fossil record [73] and because our sampling does
not allow dating based on geographic history (e.g. volcanic islands), it is impossible to calibrate the Burmanniaceae tree directly. To estimate ages of nodes in the
Burmanniaceae phylogeny we expanded our phylogeny to
comprise all monocot lineages. This allowed the incorporation of multiple fossil calibration points, in order to
minimize bias produced by single calibration points. An
additional purpose was to have fossils calibrating nodes at
different distances to the root of the phylogeny, averaging
out any biases that might result from calibrating at different levels in the phylogeny. To this end we extended our
18S rDNA sampling with 18S rDNA accessions from GenBank of all monocot orders and Amborella as outgroup
[see Additional file 1]. This dataset of 203 taxa and 1662
characters was analyzed with MrBayes using the following
constraints: (1) all monocot orders were forced to be
monophyletic; (2) the relationships between the orders
was constrained according to the multi-gene monocot
topology by Chase [74], and (3) the relationships
between the Burmanniaceae taxa were constrained to the
multi-gene tree presented in this study. The Bayesian analysis was run for five million generations, sampling every
1,000 generations, and using the GTR+I+G model as
selected by the AIC implemented in Modeltest 3.06. A
majority-rule consensus tree with branch lengths averaged
over the last 2,500 trees (50%) was obtained with the
sumt command. Branch lengths of this majority-rule consensus tree were then optimized with MrBayes under the
GTR+I+G model by setting the proposal probability
('props') of the 'node slider' to 5 and the proposal probability of all other topology moves to 0 [69]. Because
MrBayes requires a fully resolved starting tree polytomies
in the majority-rule consensus tree were arbitrarily
resolved. The MCMC was run over two million generations, sampling every 1,000 generations. A majority rule
tree was calculated over the last 1,000 sampled trees (Figure 1). Because a χ2 likelihood ratio test strongly rejected
a strict molecular clock for our data (χ2 = 1316.36; df =
201; P = 6.6 × 10-150), we applied a relaxed clock model,
using penalized likelihood (PL) analysis as implemented
in r8s [75] to obtain age estimations. Seven calibration
points were used to calibrate the 18S rDNA tree (Figure 2).
A: a minimum age constraint of the stem node of Monsteroideae (Araceae) of 110 Mya. This is consistent to the
minimum age of Mayoa portugallica, an araceous fossil
assigned to the tribe Spathiphylleae [32]. B: a minimum
age constraint of 90 Mya to the crown node of Triuri-

daceae. This is based on the Triuridaceae fossil flowers
Mabelia and Nuhliantha from the Upper Cretaceous [76].
Phylogenetic analyses of morphological data showed that
both fossil genera are nested within extant Triuridaceae.
Our sampling includes two species of Sciaphila and one
Kupea species. The latter genus was shown to be the
basally-divergent node of Triuridaceae [77]. C: the minimum age of the split between Zingiberales and Commelinales constrained to 83 Mya [78,79]. D: the stem node
age of the Arecaceae constrained to a minimum of 89.5
Mya [79,80]. E: the crown node of the Flagellariaceae/
Poaceae/Joinvilleaceae/Restionaceae clade constrained to
a minimum age of 69.5 Mya [79,81]. F: a minimum age of
93 Mya for the Asparagales crown node based on the minimum age of fossil Liliacidites pollen [82]. G: all calibration points listed above are fossil data and therefore apply
minimum ages only. However, the r8s software requires at
least one fixed calibration point. In order to achieve this
we considered a fixed crown node age of the monocots of
134 Mya, an estimate obtained by Bremer [79]. This age is
consistent with results obtained by other studies [83-85].
We used the 'fossil cross-validation' method to measure
the agreement between these different calibration points
[17]. This method compares the difference between the
fossil and molecular ages by rerunning the PL analysis
with single calibration nodes. The summed square (SS)
values of the deviations between molecular age estimations and the fossil constraint's age for each node are plotted in Figure 6. Calibration point A exhibited the largest
SS. Removal of this calibration point resulted in a twofold decrease of the average squared deviation (s) of all
remaining fossils (Figure 7). Subsequent removal of the
other fossil calibrations had no impact on the magnitude
of s. Fossil constraint A was therefore identified as the

most inconsistent calibration point and omitted from the
analyses.
The rooted Bayesian majority-rule consensus tree with
optimized branch lengths was used as the input tree for a
penalized likelihood (PL) analysis with r8s 1.70 [75,86].
As suggested by the author, the truncated-Newton (TN)
optimization algorithm was selected for the analyses. The
rate smoothing penalty parameter was set to 1.3e2 as
determined by the statistical cross-validation method
implemented in r8s 1.70. Standard deviations and credibility intervals on the age estimations were calculated by
reapplying PL to 1,000 randomly chosen trees kept from
the Bayesian analysis.
Additionally we performed a Bayesian relaxed clock analysis with all three data partitions using BEAST 1.4.6 [87].
We applied a GTR+I+G model with 4 gamma categories
on each partition following the 'BEAST partitioning manual' [88]. The uncorrelated lognormal clock model [20]
was selected and two secondary calibration points and the
credibility intervals were taken from the r8s analysis
described above: a prior of 116.3 ± 2.6 Mya was set for the
root of the tree and a prior of 96.0 ± 3.4 Mya for the crown
node of the Burmanniaceae. In the BEAST analysis a normal distribution was applied to reflect the credibility
intervals produced by reapplying PL to 1,000 trees. The
distribution of all other priors was set to uniform. Posterior distributions of parameters were approximated using
two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses of
twenty million generations followed by a discarded
burnin of 2,000,000 generations (10%). Convergence of
the chains was checked using TRACER 1.4 [72] and the
effective sampling size (ESS) parameter was found to

exceed 100, which suggests acceptable mixing and sufficient sampling. The XML BEAST input file is available
from the first author on request.
Tempo of diversification
We evaluated the tempo of lineage accumulation in Burmanniaceae using the constant-rate (CR) test [30]. This
test uses the γ-statistic to compare the relative positions of
the nodes in the chronogram to those expected under a
CR model of diversification. A negative value of the γ-statistic indicates that that nodes are closer to the root than
expected under a CR model and implies a deceleration in
the accumulation of lineages. A positive value indicates
that nodes are closer to the tips than expected under a CR
model and implies an acceleration of lineages [30]. A CR
model of diversification can be rejected at the 95% level if
γ < -1.645 [30]. We calculated the gamma-statistic of the
BEAST chronogram of the ingroup with duplicate species
excluded. However, the γ-statistic is biased by extinction,
because older lineages have higher risks of being extinct at
present than younger ones (bias towards positive γ values), and by incomplete taxon sampling, because nodes
near the root of the tree give rise to more extant descendants than nodes near the tips and are therefore more likely
to be included in a small random sample (bias towards
negative γ values) [89,90]. To explore the effects of incomplete taxon sampling on the γ-statistic calculated on the
Burmanniaceae chronogram we simulated pure-birth (d:b
= 0) trees with Phylogen 1.1 [91] under the assumption
that our Burmanniaceae sampling n (n = 41) represents
only a proportion (f) of the actual diversity [92,93]. 1,000
pure-birth trees were simulated with n/f tips for f values
ranging from 0.018 to 0.5. This corresponds to an extant
Burmanniaceae diversity ranging from 82 to 2278 species.
Each tree was then randomly pruned to 41 tips and the γstatistic was calculated. For each simulated dataset of
1000 phylogenies the mean value of γ and the 95% confidence interval were plotted to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the number of lineages that must be
missing to obtain a γ-statistic as extreme as the measured
one if γ actually is zero [93]. The resulting curves are
shown in Figure 4. All γ-statistics were calculated with
Genie 3.0 [94].
Lineage-through-time plot
A lineage-through-time (LTT) plot of the BEAST chronogram without doublet species was constructed with ENDEPI [95]. Our sampling consisted of ≈45% of described
Burmanniaceae lineages (41 out of 92 species [60]). To
evaluate the effects of incomplete taxon sampling on the
slope of the LTT plot, we generated 1,000 phylogenies
with 92 taxa under a death-birth ratio of 0.5, and randomly pruned each tree to 41 taxa. The branch lengths of
the resulting trees were scaled with TreeEdit 1.0 [95] to set
the root node of each tree 96.4 My from the tips (the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/178

crown node age of the Burmanniaceae estimated using
BEAST). The scaled trees were used to construct a mean
LTT curve with 95% confidence intervals. To evaluate the
fit of the empirical LTT plot to three general models of
diversification (A, B, and C [97,98]) we used the different
survival models implemented in the APE 1.8 package
[97,99]. Model A assumes a constant diversification rate;
Model B assumes a monotonically changing diversification rate. The parameter that controls the change of this
rate is called γ. If γ is greater than one, then the diversification rate decreases through time. Model C assumes an
abrupt change in rate before and after some breakpoint in
the past. See McKenna & Farrell [98] for a visual comparison between these models. For model C, optimal time
points for a shift in rate of diversification suggested by the
LTT plot were tested. To detect and locate significant diversification rate shifts we used the Δ1, Δ2, and the Slowinski
and Guyer (SG) [99] statistic (implemented in SymmeTREE 1.1 [100]), and the relative cladogenesis (RC) test
(implemented in END-EPI).
Analysis of ancestral areas
We estimated ancestral areas of Burmanniaceae with a dispersal-vicariance analysis using DIVA 1.1 [101]. Species
distributions were scored using floristic regions as
described by Takhtajan [102]. The ingroup taxa used in
this study are distributed over 12 regions: Guineo-Congolian Region, Sudano-Zambezian Region, Madagascan
Region, Indian Region, Indochinese Region, Malaysian
Region, Caribbean Region, Amazonian Region (including
Guyana Highlands), Brazilian Region, Eastern Asiatic
Region, Northeast Australian Region, North American
Atlantic Region. The number of unit areas allowed in
ancestral distributions was restricted to two with the maxareas option in DIVA. To estimate the number of dispersals between the New and Old World the DIVA analysis
was repeated with the terminals scored for presence in
either the New World or the Old World.
