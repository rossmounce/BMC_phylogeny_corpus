Abstract
Background: To date, 6 tick-borne rickettsiae pathogenic for humans are known to occur in
Africa and 4 of them were first identified in ticks before being recognized as human pathogens.
Results: We examined 33 and 5 Amblyomma tholloni ticks from African elephants in the Central
African Republic and Gabon, respectively, by PCR amplification and sequencing of a part of gltA and
ompA genes of the genus Rickettsia. The partial sequences of gltA and ompA genes detected in tick
in Gabon had 99.1% similarity with those of R. heilongjiangensis and 97.1% with those of Rickettsia
sp. HL-93 strain, respectively. The partial gltA and ompA gene sequences detected in tick in the
Central African Republic were 98.9% and 95.1% similar to those of Rickettsia sp. DnS14 strain and
R. massiliae, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed Rickettsia sp. detected in Gabon clusters
with R. japonica and R. heilongjiangensis in a phylogenetic tree based on the partial gltA and ompA
genes. The genotype of the Rickettsia sp. detected in the Central African Republic is close to those
of R. massiliae group in the phylogenetic tree based on partial gltA gene sequences, and distantly
related to other rickettsiae in the tree based on partial ompA gene.
Conclusion: The degrees of similarity of partial gltA and ompA genes with recognized species
indicate the rickettsiae detected in this study may be new species although we could only study the
partial sequences of 2 genes regarding the amount of DNA that was available. We propose the
Rickettsia sp. detected in Gabon be provisionally named "Rickettsia sp. stain Davousti" and Rickettsia
sp. detected in the Central African Republic be named "Rickettsia sp. strain Uilenbergi".

Background
Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae are obligatory intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that belong to the genus
Rickettsia. They are associated with arthropods, mainly
ticks, which act as vectors and/or reservoirs [1]. Between

1984 and 2005, 11 new species or subspecies of rickettsiae
have been identified as emerging agents of human tickborne diseases [1]. Additionally, many SFG rickettsiae
have been identified only in ticks and their pathogenicity
for humans is unknown [1].

To date, 6 tick-borne rickettsiae pathogenic for humans
are known to occur in Africa [1]. Rickettsia conorii conorii,
the agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, transmitted by
Rhipicephalus sanguineus [2] is endemic in North Africa
and has been reported from South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe. R. conorii caspia, the agent of Astrakhan fever, has
recently been detected in Rh. sanguineus in Chad. It is now
almost 15 years since Rickettsia africae, the agent of African
tick-bite fever (ATBF), was discovered in sub-Saharan
Africa. In southern Africa, Amblyomma hebraeum, a tick of
large ruminants and wildlife species, is the recognized vector (and reservoir) of R. africae, which has also been
detected in A. variegatum throughout west, central, and
eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and in A. lepidum from the
Sudan. Rickettsia aeschlimannii has been found in
Hyalomma marginatum marginatum and H. marginatum
rufipes and, while probably following the distribution of
these ticks. This rickettsia has been identified in Morocco,
Niger, Mali, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Rickettsia massiliae which was proven to be a human pathogen in 2005
has been detected in several Rhipicephalus ticks parasitizing cattle in the Central African Republic and Mali [1]. It
should be noted that the four last rickettsiae were first
identified in ticks before being recognized as human pathogens [1]. Finally, R. rhipicephali, a rickettsia of unknown
pathogenicity, has been detected in ticks of the Rh. compositus group and Rh. lunulatus [3]. Here, we report two
candidate new species in the genus Rickettsia detected in
ticks collected from African elephants.

Results
Ticks
Thirty-eight ticks were collected from African elephants in
the Central African Republic (5; 1 female, 3 males and 1
nymph) and Gabon (15 females and 18 males). They were
all identified as Amblyomma tholloni.
PCR and sequencing of gltA and ompA genes
One female from the Central African Republic and 1 male
from Gabon were PCR positive for the rickettsial gltA and
ompA genes. These amplicons were sequenced and ambiguous parts in the end of each sequence were deleted. Consequently, 914 bp of gltA and 590 bp of ompA genes, and
1196 bp of gltA and 544 bp of ompA genes were obtained
from tick samples from Gabon and the Central African
Republic, respectively. The partial sequences of the gltA
and ompA genes of Gabon tick sample were 99.1% identical to those of R. heilongjiangensis [GenBank accession
number, AY280709] and 97.1% to those of Rickettsia sp.
HL-93 strain [AF179364], respectively. The partial
sequences of the gltA and ompA genes amplified from the
tick from the Central African Republic were 98.9% identical to those of Rickettsia sp. DnS14 strain [AF120028] and
95.1% identical to those of R. massiliae [U43799], respectively.

and ompA genes are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first
molecular detection of spotted fever group rickettsiae in
A. tholloni. This three-host tick is primarily found on African elephants [4,5] but also occurs on other animals
including reptiles (lizards), birds and mammals (horse,
antelope, wild pig, mongoose, buffalo and hippopotamus). It has been reported to feed on humans [4,5] and
occurs widely in Africa following the distribution of the
African elephant; from South Africa in the south to the
Sudan in the north, and from Sierra Leone in the west to
Somalia in the east [4,5]. Amblyomma tholloni can transmit
Ehrlichia ruminantium, the agent of heartwater in domestic
ruminants, but the tick has not been implicated in field
outbreaks of the disease [6].
The rickettsiae we detected in A. tholloni in our study are
members of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae. All the
gene sequences that we have identified were unique. The
rickettsia from Gabon clustered with R. japonica and R.
heilongjiangensis in the phylogenetic trees based on the
partial gltA and ompA genes (Figure 1 and 2). The rickettsia
from the Central African Republic was close to the R. massiliae group in the phylogenetic tree based on the partial
gltA gene sequences (Figure 1) and distinct from other
rickettsiae in the tree based on the partial ompA gene (Figure 2). Recently, guidelines for the genotypic classification
of rickettsiae at the genus, group, and species levels have
been published [7]. According to these criteria, the
degrees of nucleotide similarity with recognized species
indicate the rickettsiae from the A. tholloni may be new
species. However, we could only study the partial
sequences of 2 genes regarding the amount of DNA that
was available. Until isolates are made and definitively
characterized as new species, we propose the rickettsia in
the A. tholloni from Gabon be provisionally named "Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti" after the French veterinary scientist Bernard Davoust in recognition of his work on
zoonoses. Further, we propose the rickettsia in the A. tholloni from the Central African Republic be provisionally
named "Rickettsia sp. strain Uilenbergi" after the Dutch
veterinary scientist Gerrit Uilenberg in recognition of his
research into tick-borne tropical diseases. Both scientists
coordinated field works that help to get the ticks used in
our study.
The ticks harboring "Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti" and
"Rickettsia sp. strain Uilenbergi" were feeding on elephants when they have been collected. It is not clear if the
ticks were infected with the rickettsiae or if the organisms
were only present in the ingested elephant blood. It

appears unlikely the elephants were rickettsemic, however, as other ticks feeding on the same animals did not
contain rickettsiae. It seems most probable that the organisms are associated with the ticks as it is commonly the
case with other spotted fever group rickettsiae [8]. The tick
vectors of the spotted fever group rickettsiae transmit the
organisms while feeding and the role that the African elephant, the major host of A. tholloni, plays in the biology of
the new rickettsiae requires further investigation. The
pathogenicity of "Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti" and "Rickettsia sp. strain Uilenbergi" in the other species on which
A. tholloni feeds, should also be investigate. In particular,
A. tholloni is known to feed on people [4,5] and it would
seem prudent to consider "Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti"
and "Rickettsia sp. strain Uilenbergi" as potential human
pathogens until further studies clarify the situation.

Conclusion
The rickettsiae detected in A. tholloni in our study are
members of the SFG rickettsiae, and their gltA and ompA
gene sequences were unique. The degrees of similarity of
partial gltA and ompA genes with recognized species indicate the rickettsiae detected in this study are new species.
Although the pathogenicity of these rickettsiae were not
evaluated in our study, it would seem prudent to consider
these rickettsiae as potential human pathogens until further studies clarify the situation because A. tholloni is
known to feed on people.

Methods
Ticks
Ticks were collected from African elephants (Loxodonta
africana) in the Central African Republic in 1970 and in
Gabon in 2004. In Gabon, ticks were collected from an
elephant which had just been killed illegally by hunters.
The ticks were identified on their morphology [4,5] and
kept in 70% ethanol until DNA was extracted in Marseille,
France, in 2005.
DNA extraction and PCR for rickettsiae
The ticks were washed twice in distilled water and dried
on sterile filter paper. Each tick was bisected longitudinally with a sterile scalpel blade and DNA extracted from
one half using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. PCR was performed using primers Rp877p
and Rp1258n that amplify a 380 bp fragment of the gltA
gene of rickettsiae [9]. DNA samples that gave a positive
result with gltA PCR were also tested in a second PCR
using primer pairs 190.70 or 190.180, and 190.701 that
amplify a 632 bp and 552 bp fragment of the ompA gene
of rickettsiae [10-12]. Negative controls consisted of (i)
DNA from uninfected Rh. sanguineus (from our laboratory
colony) which was extracted simultaneously with the test
samples, and (ii) distilled water added to the PCR mix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/74

instead of DNA. One sample of DNA from Rickettsia montanensis was included in each PCR as a positive control
Sequencing and extension of gltA sequences
Products amplified using PCR for rickettsial gltA and ompA
were sequenced as described previously [9,12], used in a
BLAST search [15] and aligned with sequences of other
rickettsial species registered in GenBank using Clustal program [13]. Sequences of partial gltA gene were extended
using primers CS2d and CS535R, and CS409d and
CS1273r as described previously [9,14]. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed using TreeView [16] based on the
data from ClustalW.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The partial gltA and ompA sequences of rickettsia in tick
from Gabon have been deposited under accession
number DQ402516 and DQ402517, respectively. The
partial gltA and ompA sequences of rickettsia in tick from
Central African Republic have been deposited under
accession number DQ402514 and DQ402515, respectively.
