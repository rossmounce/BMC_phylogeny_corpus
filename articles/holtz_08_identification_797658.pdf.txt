Abstract
Diarrhea, the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide, causes approximately 2 million
deaths a year. Approximately 40% of these cases are of unknown etiology. We previously
developed a metagenomic strategy for identification of novel viruses from diarrhea samples. By
applying mass sequencing to a stool sample collected in Melbourne, Australia from a child with
acute diarrhea, one 395 bp sequence read was identified that possessed only limited identity to
known picornaviruses. This initial fragment shared only 55% amino acid identity to its top BLAST
hit, the VP3 protein of Theiler's-like virus, suggesting that a novel picornavirus might be present in
this sample. By using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, 6562 bp
of the viral genome was sequenced, which includes the entire putative polyprotein. The overall
genomic organization of this virus was similar to known picornaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the
polyprotein demonstrated that the virus was divergent from previously described picornaviruses
and appears to belong to the newly proposed picornavirus genus, Cosavirus. Based on the analysis
discussed here, we propose that this virus represents a new species in the Cosavirus genus, and it
has tentatively been named Human Cosavirus E1 (HCoSV-E1).

Findings
Diarrhea is the third leading infectious cause of death
worldwide and causes approximately 2 million deaths
each year [1]. Additionally, an estimated 1.4 billion nonfatal episodes occur yearly [2,3]. Importantly, it is estimated that 40% of diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology
[4-6]. Motivated by an interest to identify novel or unrecognized viruses associated with diarrhea, we recently
developed a mass sequencing strategy to define the spectrum of viruses present in human stool [7]. Using this
approach, we describe here the identification of a novel
virus in a stool sample collected in 1981 at the Royal Chil-

dren's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia from a child with
acute diarrhea.
Previous testing of this diarrhea specimen for known
enteric pathogens using routine enzyme immunoassays
(EIA) and culture assays for rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and
common bacterial and parasitic pathogens was negative
[8]. Additionally, RT-PCR assays for caliciviruses and
astroviruses were also negative [8,9], making this sample
a good candidate for viral discovery efforts as described
[7].

In brief, 200 mg of frozen stool was chipped and then
resuspended in 6 volumes of PBS [7]. The sample was centrifuged to pellet particulate matter and the supernatant
was then passed through a 0.45 μm filter. RNA was isolated from 100 μL primary stool filtrate using RNA-Bee
(Tel-Test, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Approximately, 100 nanograms of RNA was randomly
amplified using the Round AB protocol as previously
described [10]. The amplified nucleic acid was cloned into
pCR4.0 using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), and clones were sequenced using standard Sanger
chemistry [7]. High quality sequences were compared to
the GenBank nr database by BLASTx and one 395 bp
sequence read was identified in this sample that had only
55% identity at the amino acid level to its top hit, the VP3
protein of Theiler's-like virus, a murine picornavirus in
the genus cardiovirus.
Picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a single
stranded positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a single polyprotein [11]. The genomes range in size from
approximately 7 kb to 8.5 kb in length, are polyadenylated, and have 5' and 3' non-translated regions. The 5'non-translated regions of picornaviruses are highly structured and contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
that directs translation of the RNA by internal ribosome
binding [11]. The 3'-non-translated region also contains a
secondary structure, including a pseudoknot, that has
been implicated in controlling viral RNA synthesis [11].
Recently, Kapoor et al identified multiple novel related
picornaviruses which they propose belong to a new genus,
cosavirus. These viruses were found in the stools of both
healthy children and those with acute flaccid paralysis in

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/159

Pakistan and Afghanistan [12]. Additionally, 1 stool from
a 64 year old woman in Scotland was found to be positive
for Human Cosavirus A. Other picornaviruses have also
been found in stool such as enteroviruses, polio, and aichi
virus [11,13].
Using a combination of direct Sanger sequencing, RTPCR, 5' and 3' random amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE), and 454 sequencing performed on RNA isolated
from the stool sample, a 6562 bp contig [GenBank:
FJ555055] containing the entire predicted polyprotein
and the 3' untranslated region to the poly A tail was generated. For these sequencing experiments, the stool filtrate
was proteinase K and DNAse treated prior to RNA extraction. RT-PCR and 3'RACE reactions were performed using
SuperScript III and Platinum Taq (Invitrogen One-Step
RT-PCR). For 5'RACE reactions cDNA was generated with
Stratascript (Stratagene) and amplified with Accuprime
Taq (Invitrogen). The initial assembly was confirmed by
sequencing a series of four overlapping RT-products to
give 2.7× coverage. All amplicons were cloned into pCR4
(Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard sequencing
technology. Despite repeated efforts, we were unable to
obtain additional sequence at the 5' end, presumably due
to the presence of RNA secondary structures. Even performing 5' RACE reactions at 65°C or 70°C with multiple
high temperature reverse transcriptases (Monsterscript
[Epicentre Biotechnologies], rTth [Applied Biosystems],
and Thermoscript [Invitrogen]) did not extend the contig
further in the 5' direction.
Analysis of the contig sequence showed that this virus has
a genomic organization similar to other picornaviruses

(figure 1). Using Pfam [14], conserved motifs characteristic of picornaviruses were found to be present, including
two picornavirus capsid proteins, RNA helicase, 3C
cysteine protease, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase.
Predicted polyprotein cleavage sites were identified by
scanning for conserved amino acids characteristic for
cleavage sites [GenBank: FJ555055] as described [15]. We
performed phylogenetic analysis on each of the three coding regions: P1 (Figure 2A), P2 (Figure 2B) and P3 (Figure
2C). Protein sequences associated with the following reference virus genomes were obtained from GenBank:
Equine Rhinitis A virus (NP_653075.1), Foot-and-mouthtype-O (NP_658990.1), Equine Rhinitis B virus
(NP_653077.1), Theiler's-like virus of rats (BAC58035.1),
Saffold virus (YP_001210296.1), Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (AAA47929.1), Mengo virus (AAA46547.1),
Encephalomyocarditis virus (CAA60776.1), Seneca valley
virus (DQ641257), Aichi virus (NP_047200.1), and Porcine teschovirus (NP_653143.1). Human cosavirus
and
FJ442991sequences
(FJ4388825-FJ438908
FJ442995) were kindly provided by E. Delwart. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX
(1.83). The amino acid alignments generated by ClustalX
were input into PAUP [16], and maximum parsimony
analysis was performed using the default settings with
1,000 replicates.

also encode for a L* protein, a protein that is initiated
from an alternative AUG downstream from the initiation
site of the polyprotein. Neither HCoSV-E1 nor the other
described members of the proposed genus cosavirus
appeared to encode an L or L* protein. [12]

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus
sequence is highly divergent from previously described
picornaviruses and is most closely related to viruses in the
newly reported genus cosavirus (Figure 2) [12]. According
to the Picornavirus study group [17] members of a genus
should share > 40%, > 40% and > 50% amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 genome regions respectively. For all
picornavirus genera except apthovirus, species are defined
as sharing > 70% amino acid identity in P1 and > 70%
amino acid identity in 2C and 3CD [18]. Sequences from
the 4 previously described cosavirus species share 48–
55% amino acid identity in the P1 region to each other
and 63–72% identity in the 3D [12]. This virus had 51%
amino acid identity to the P1 region, 88% amino acid
identity to 2C, and 77% amino acid identity to 3CD of
HCoSV-D1, its closest relative based on phylogenetic
analysis of the entire polyprotein (data not shown). Given
that this virus does not meet all criteria for inclusion in the
existing cosavirus species, we propose that this virus be
considered a new species within the cosavirus genus.
Therefore we have tentatively named this virus Human
Cosavirus E1 (HCoSV-E1).

At this time the relationship of HCoSV-E1 to diarrhea or
other human diseases is unknown. One possibility is that
HCoSV-E1 represents a true human pathogen that causes
gastroenteritis. Alternatively, it may be a human pathogen
that is shed in the stool, but causes extraintestinal disease
such as poliovirus. Another possibility is that HCoSV-E1
may be a commensal or symbiotic microbe. Additionally,
it is also possible that HCoSV-E1 is a result of dietary
ingestion and is not a virus that truly infects or replicates
in human cells. Regardless of the clinical role of HCoSVE1, the identification of HCoSV-E1 in this study further
emphasizes the tremendous microbial diversity of the
human gut that remains to be discovered and the need for
systematic investigations of the human "virome". In addition, future work will focus on defining if HCoSV-E1 is a
true human pathogen.

A subset of viruses in the family Picornaviridae, members
of the genera Cardiovirus, Apthovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, Teschovirus and the proposed genera Sapelovirus and
Senecavirus [11,19,20], encode a leader protein (L) at the
N terminus of the polyprotein. In addition, cardioviruses

253 pediatric stool specimens sent to the clinical microbiology lab for bacterial culture at the St. Louis Children's
Hospital and 143 stool samples from children with acute
diarrhea at the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne,
Australia) were analyzed for the presence of HCoSV-E1 by
RT-PCR using primers (LG0053: 5'-GAACTCATGCAACTTACCCAGC-3' and LG0052: 5'-GCCAAGACATGATCCAACGG-3') designed to the 3D region of the genome.
None of these samples were positive for the presence of
HCoSV-E1. This suggests that the prevalence rate of
HCoSV-E1 is more similar to the reported cosavirus prevalence in Scotland (1/1000) than that described in Pakistan [12]. However, obtaining more sequence from the
5'UTR of HCosV-E1, would enable design of more robust
screening primers to more comprehensively analyze these
cohorts for the presence of viruses closely related to
HCosV-E1. Additionally, usage of conserved primers
capable of detecting all of the known cosaviruses could
potentially reveal the presence of other cosaviruses in
these cohorts of stool samples.
