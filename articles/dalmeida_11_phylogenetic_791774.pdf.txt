Dof proteins are a family of transcription factors specific
to the plant kingdom that contain a particular class of
zinc finger DNA binding domain. Members of this
family are involved in the regulation of genes related to
a plethora of metabolic processes including stress or
hormone response, seed and endosperm development,
flowering, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell or tissue
specificity. Dof proteins and encoding genes were characterized in several plant species. Nevertheless poplar is
the only woody species whose Dof genes were better
characterized. The recent availability of the Eucalyptus
grandis genome and transcriptome, along with transcription factor databases of several plant species
allowed us to identify and run a valuable comparative
analysis of the Dof protein family in this tree. These
species included Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Carica papaya, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera,
Sorghum bicolor, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Oryza
sativa indica and Zea mays.The phylogenetic relationships among Dof proteins from E. grandis and Arabidopsis thaliana - a popular model for studying the
genomics of many plants - is a fundamental step to
unravel functionality of new Dof genes not yet characterized. Twenty-three distinct DNA sequences were predicted to belong to the Dof gene family after the
analysis of the complete available genome of E. grandis.
The deduced protein sequences of 22 members do contain a conserved Dof domain. One sequence seemed to
have lost the conserved Dof domain, suggesting it to be

a pseudogene or to present an activity not directly
linked to the Dof family. Gene structures, including
exon/intron positions, and amino acid sequences were
predicted for each gene based on the available E. grandis
transcriptome. In order to determine the relationship
and function of the genes putatively encoding Dof proteins, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis with 43 Dof
protein sequences from A. thaliana. Our analysis
allowed us to classify the E. grandis Dof sequences into
five groups of orthologous genes. Gene expression analysis via real time, quantitative PCR was also conducted
with ten of the E. grandis Dof genes, using samples
obtained from flowers, leaves and vascular tissue. Generally, Dof steady-state mRNA levels were higher in E.
grandis vascular tissues, with more reduced levels in
flowers. Dof genes showed an increase in steady-state
mRNA levels after hormone signaling, and reduced
levels following abiotic stress. This is the first study that
aimed the identification of Dof genes in E. grandis
which are possibly involved in numerous plant metabolic processes. The phylogenetic relationship to
A. thaliana counterparts and the patterns of mRNA
accumulation in E. grandis allowed us to speculate on
possible roles for some of the Dof-encoding genes.
