Abstract
Background: Pigs play a critical role in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission between mosquitos and
humans. In 2009, lots of piglets developed symptom of viral encephalitis in a pig farm in Yunchen, Shanxi
province.
Methods: Virus isolation was carried out in BHK-21 cells. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and indirect
immunofluorescent assay were used to identify the newly isolated virus. The complete genome of one isolate
(SX09S-01 strain) was sequenced and analyzed. Two phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of the 24
full-length JEV genomes and 62 E genes mostly selected from China.
Results: JEV SX09S-01 strain was isolated from piglets. Sequence analysis indicates that the completed genome
sequences of this strain consists of 10965 nucleotides and there are 13 nucleotides deletion in the 3’ nontranslated
variable region. Compared with other JEV strains, homology ranges from 99.1% (XJ69) to 74.1% (XZ0934) and 99.6%
(XJ69) to 91.1% (XZ0934) on the level of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic trees
show that SX09S-01 strain belongs to genotype I and it is most closely related to the XJ69 strain.
Conclusions: Genotype I of JEV still circulates in Yuncheng and it is thus important for active surveillance on
genotype I of JEV from the swine population.

Background
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is mostly prevalent in eastern
and southern Asia, such as China, India and Japan [1,2]. JE
has extended its geographic regions and it has been
recently reported in Australia and USA [2,3]. There are
approximately 30,000-50,000 JE cases and up to 10,00015,000 deaths occur worldwide each year [2,4]. In fact, the
actual number of cases caused by Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) is most likely to be much higher, and up to
175,000 each year [5]. Most of cases occurred in the young
children and older people. Approximately 25%-30% of
cases caused by JEV are fatal, and 50% result in permanent
neuropsychiatric sequelae [2,6].
In China, JE is one of the most important viral encephalitis and has been reported in most provinces of mainland
China, except for Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

and Qinhai Province [6,7]. There are still 8,000-10,000
cases reported annually and nearly 80% of globally
reported cases occur in China although JE vaccines are
widely used [8]. Particularly, in August 2006, an outbreak
of JE occurred in Yuncheng, Shanxi Province, China Sixtysix human cases were reported with 19 fatalities [9].
JEV, the etiological agent of JE, belongs to a mosquitoborne Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae [10]. JEV
exists in a zoonotic transmission cycle between animals/
water birds and human by Culex mosquitoes, and
humans are a dead-end host [11]. The viral genome is a
single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule approximately 11 kb in length and contains a single long open
reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein flanked
by 5’ and 3’ nontranslated regions (NTRs). The polyprotein consists of three structural proteins, designated capsid protein (C), membrane (M, a mature form of its
precursor protein prM), and envelope protein (E), as well
as seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3,
NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The prM and E proteins play

critical roles in several biological activities, such as
hemagglutination, neutralization, viral binding to cellular
receptors and membrane fusion. In addition, the E protein has a major role in determining the neuorovirulence
or neuroinvasiveness. Phylogenetic analyses mainly
focused on partial sequences derived from either the C/
prM or E gene and JEV can be divided into five genotypes (GI-GV) based on the nucleotide sequence of E
gene [1,7,12].
Swine is an important reservoir and overwintering host
for JEV and thus plays a critical role in the human encephalitis epidemics. However, the detailed information on
JEV from pigs was lacking. Here, we report the isolation of
a GI JEV from piglets that developed viral encephalitis in
Yuncheng in July 2009 and this virus is designated SX09S01 strain. To investigate its molecular characters, the completed genome was sequenced and analyzed. Eight critical
amino acids in the E protein were found to be closely
related to the JEV neurovirulence. Phyogenetic trees were
constructed on the basis of the 24 full-length JEV genomes
and 62 completed E genes mostly selected from China.
Phyogenetic analysis indicated that SX09S-01 strain was
most closely related to the XJ69 strain.

Materials and methods
Collection of samples and virus isolation

Seven swine brain samples were collected from piglets
which were suspected to be infected with JEV in Yuncheng, Shanxi province 2009. A part of brains was fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry and
others were ground and used for virus isolation.
The virus was isolated on BHK-21 cells as previous
described [13]. Briefly, the supernatant was inoculated
onto the monolayer of BHK-21 cells, and the cytopathic
effects (CPE) was observed daily under a microscope. Culture supernatants were harvested and re-inoculated onto
fresh BHK-21 cells until the typical CPE of JEV appeared.
One virus was isolated and designated SX09S-01 strain.
The SX09S-01 strain was further identified by indirect
immunofluorescent assay (IFA). SX09S-01 was inoculated
on BHK-21 cells monolayer, and IFA was carried out 36
hours later as previously described [14]. The primary antibody is murine monoclonal antibody against JEV E protein
and the secondary antibody is FITC conjugated antimouse IgG (Cat no: BA1101, Boster).
Virus purification

The SX09S-01 strain was propagated by injection into the
brains of suckling mice [15]. The brain tissue was collected
and ground while the first signs of paralysis emerged. The
sample was centrifuged at 10000r/min for 30min and the
supernatant was stored at -80°C as a virus stock. Mice
were bought from Center for Animal Disease Control,
Hubei province and all experiments were conducted with

approval of the Animal Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University.
Viral RNA extraction

Total viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of
infected cells with TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 200 μl of
sample was mixed with 1.0 ml of TRIZOL® reagent and
0.2 ml of chloroform. After incubation on ice for 10 min,
the aqua phase was separated by centrifugation (12,000 ×
g for 15 min) at room temperature (RT) and 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol was mixed with 80% of the aqua phase in a
fresh tube. After incubation at RT for 10 min, the RNA
was precipitated at 12,000 × g at RT for 10 min. After
washing once with 80% ethanol, the pellet was briefly
dried at RT and then dissolved with DEPC treated water
and stored at -80°C until use.
Full-length genome sequence analysis of the SX09S-01
strain

Extracted viral RNA was used as a template for cDNA
synthesis using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse
transcriptase (Toyobo, Japan). The cDNA was subsequently used for PCR amplification with LA PCR™ Kit
Ver.2.1 (TaKaRa, Dalian). In order to amplify the completed genome, the six pairs of primers (Table 1) were
designed according to the XJ69 strain genome sequences.
The PCR products were purified by agarose gels electrophoresis and then ligated directly into TA cloning vector
system (Promega, USA) and sequenced. Analysis of
nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identifies
was performed by DNASTAR software.
Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis

The JEV strains used in multiple sequence alignments and
phylogenetic analyses in this study are listed in additional
file 1. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were performed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method
using the Maga4.1 software. To generate the rooted trees,
the Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE-1-51) was used
as an outgroup in phylogenetic analysis.

Results
Viral isolation

In July 2009, lots of piglets developed the viral encephalitis
and died in Yuncheng, Shanxi province, China. Brain samples were collected and haemorrhage lesions were found
(Figure 1A). To investigate whether it was caused by JEV,
specific IHC and RT-PCR were performed. IHC revealed
brown positive cells in the brain (Figure 1B) and RT-PCR
with the C/prM primers resulted in the amplification of a
674 bp band (Figure 1C).
In order to isolate the pathogen, brain samples were
ground and the supernatant was inoculated onto the

fresh BHK-21 cells. BHK-21 cells appeared rounding,
shrinkage and dislodgment from the cell surface under a
microscope on days 3-4 after inoculation, and typical
cytopathic effect (CPE) of JEV was observed (Figure 1E).
Cells infected by the isolate reacted with the specific
monoclonal antibody against JEV E protein by IFA. Several focuses of bright fluorescence were observed in the
cytoplasm compared with normal control cells (Figure
1G).
Full-length nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence
analysis

To further investigate the molecular characters of the
SX09S-01 strain, the completed genome RNA was amplified with several pairs of primers listed in Table 1. It
contains 10965 nucleotides in length and encoded a
10299-nucleotide single ORF (3432 amino acid residues)
flanked by a 96-nucleotide 5’-NTR and a 570-nucleotide
3’-NTR. The complete genomic sequence of SX09S-01
strain was compared with other 24 JEV strains available in
GenBank (Additional file 1, indicated by boldface type).
The results of multiple alignments showed that homology
ranged from 99.1 (XJ69) to 74.1% (XZ0934), and 99.6
(XJ69) to 91.41 (XZ0934) on the levels of nucleotide and
amino acid, respectively. The SX09S-01 strain shares the
highest nucleotide sequence homology with other strains
of the GI with 97.8% (KV1899)-99.1% (XJ69), and amino
acid sequence homology between 98.3% (KV1899)-99.6%
(XJ69). There is further distance with the XZ0934 strain of
the GV, 75.8% and 91.4% homology on the level of nucleotide and amino acid, respectively (Additional file 2).
NTRs might play a vital role on the biological properties,
including viral replication and neurovirulence. No nucleotide changes were found when compared with other three
GI strains of JEV. However, there is an additional adenine
(A) nucleotide insertion comparison with other genotype

strains (data not shown). The nucleotide sequences of the
3’-NTRs of SX09S-01 strain was compared with those of
other 24 strains belonging to GI to GV(Figure 2). A 13nucleotide deletion immediately downstream of the translation stop codon was conserved among the 3’-NTR of the
G I strains, including SX09S-01, the newly isolated strain.
But a deletion of 11 nucleotides was observed in the FU
strain of the GII. There was no nucleotide deletion found
in 3’-NTRs of the JEV GIII strains, except for the Ling
strain (25 nucleotides deletion). In addition, the 3’-NTRs
of the JEV GVis about 14 nucleotides longer in than GII.
The roles of these deletions in the 3’-NTR of the SX09S01 strain needs further investigation.
Analysis of the E gene amino acid sequences of SX09S-01
strains

JEV E protein is one of the major structural proteins
and is closely related to viral virulence, host tropism
and antigenicity. Eight amino acid residues of E protein
play a critical role in the neurovirulence [16]. To analyze
these key amino acids, we compared the E protein of
SX09S-01 strain with SA14-14-2, an attenuated vaccine
strain, and other virulent strains. No differences among
the eight key amino acid residues were found between
SX09S-01 and other virulent strains (Table 2). So, we
predicted that the SX09S-01 strain possessed some typical characteristics of strong virulent JEV.
Phylogenetic analyses

For better understanding of the genetic relationships
and evolution of JEV strains, especially isolated in
China, a total of the 62 sequenced JEV strains (shown in
additional file 1) were used to construct phylogenetic
trees. The genetic relationship was established on
sequences of the full-length genome and the E gene
sequences.

Phylogenetic tree was produced according to the fulllength sequences by the NJ method. As shown in Figure 3,
all the viruses could be classified into five groups and
there were two distinct phylogenetic clusters. Newly isolated SX09S-01 is classified as JEV GI and this cluster also
included the XJ69 (China), Ishikawa (Japan, 1994), and
KV1899 (Korea, 1999) strains. SX09S-01 was closely

related to the XJ69 strain isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus in China. The strains from India, China, Taiwan
and Japan belonged to JEV GIII and be branched into four
minor clades. The first clade consisted of early isolates
from China (Beijing-1), Taiwan (Ling), India (VelloreP20778) and Japan (Nakayama); The second contained the
virulent strain (P3) and JaGAr-01 (Japan); The third

included two strains from Taiwan (CJN-L1 and CJN-S1);
other strains from India and China-including SA14 and its
vaccine derivatives made up the fourth clade. Strain FU
(Austraria, 1995) and JKT6468 (Indonesia, 1981) belonged
the GII and GIV, respectively. GV consisted of two stains,
Muar strain isolated from Malaysia in 1952 and XZ0934
strain recently isolated from China in 2009.
To determine the genetic relationships of JEV, the fulllength E genes sequence was utilized to construct the
phylogenetic tree. On the basis of the E gene sequences,
a total of 62 JEV strains, which included 52 strains from
China Mainland and Taiwan and 10 strains from other
countries, were analyzed (Figure 4). Five distinct phylogenetic groupings were identified that corresponded to the
five genotypes (GI to GV). The JEV strains isolated from
China include GI, GIII and GV with the majority belonging to GI and GIII groups.

Discussion
JE is mostly prevalent in China and there are many
human JE cases reported recently [7,9,17]. However,
there is very limited information on JEV strains

originated from pigs. Pigs play a critical role to JEV
transmission between mosquitos and humans, it is very
important to surveillance the JE in the swine population
in China.
In 2009, lots of piglets developed viral encephalitis in
one pig farm in Yunchen, Shanxi province, where human
JE cases broke out in 2006 [9]. In this study, we isolated a
new JEV stain by serial passages on BHK-21 cells in
Yunchen (Figure 1). The newly isolated JEV, designated
SX09S-01, belongs to genotype I by C/prM sequences analysis. Tang [18] and Nerome [19] analyzed the molecular
characterizations of JEV isolates from swine in Japan. To
our knowledge, it’s reported that only HEN0701 and
SXBJ07 strains have been isolated from swine and belong
to the GI JEV in China [20,21]. In this study, we clearly
confirmed that GI JEV strains still circulate in Yuncheng.
It suggests that we need to pay more attentions on the
prevention and treatment of swine JE in order to control
human JE effectively in this region.
To fully characterize the JEV SX09S-01 strain, its complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were
determined. Compared with other strains isolated from

Figure 3 Phyogenetic analysis of JEV strains based on the full-length genome. The multiple sequence alignments were obtained by
Mega4.1 software, and tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Newly isolated strain, SX09S-01, was indicated by black triangle
marker. Scale bar indicates number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Bootstrap confidence limits are shown at each node. The full-length
genome sequence of the Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MEV) was used as an outgroup.

different geographic regions at different time periods, a
13-nucleotide region that immediately followed the ORF
stop codon was deleted in the genome of SX09S-01
(Figure 2). Similar deletions in this region were also
observed in FU [1], K94P05 [22], Ishikawa strains (GenBank accession number AB051292), and Ling strain [23].
RNA secondary structure doesn’t exist in this region by
computational analyses [24,25]. Ta and Vrati [26] reported
that a 60-nucleotide variable region immediately downstream of the ORF stop codon in JEV genome is not
required for viral replication. However, it has recently
been suggested that this variable region in the 3’-NTR
may play an important role on the rate of viral RNA replication [22,27,28], but it still needs further clarification.
JEV E protein forms the viral spikes on the surface and
has important biological functions related to virulence
and viral host tropism. In this study, we compared the
eight critical amino acids in E protein that are closely
related with the neurovirulence of JEV with other virulent and attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 strains and found
that SX09S-01 strain has these typical characters of high
virulent strain (Table 2) and displays high neurovirulence
and low neuroinvasiveness in mice (Additional file 3).
These results indicated that neuroinvasiveness of JEV

may not have closely relations with the eight amino acids
in the E protein and some other gene(s) contributed in
part of the level of neuroinvasiveness. Nerome [19]
reported that Sw/Mie/40/2004 is a high neurovirulent
and neuroinvasive JEV and there were no amino acids
differences in the E protein between Sw/Mie/40/2004
and other low neuroinasiveness strains. In addition, we
also found that there was a censuses motif Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) in the C-terminal of E protein. It has confirmed
that protein contained RGD motif can interact with cellular integrins, such as VP1 protein of FMDV [29]. It is
not known if JEV E protein interacts with intergrins for
virus entry.
JEV can be divided into four genotypes based on a 240nucleotide highly variable sequence of prM gene [9,30-32].
However, it results in unreliable information when short
sequences (< 300 nt) were used in phylogenetic analyses of
flaviviruses [33]. In recent years, full-length genome and E
gene have also been used to establish phylogenetic trees
for JEV [8,34-39] and JEV can be divided into five genotypes [7,12,40]. JEV E protein plays important roles in
both induction of protective immune responses and in the
biology of the virus [41,42]. In order to analyze the evolution of JEV in China, sequence information of JEV strains,

originated from mainland China, were collected and phylogenetic trees were constructed on basis of the 24 fulllength genomes or 62 E genes. Phylogenetic trees based
on the full-length genomes or E genes provided similar
topology (Figure 3, 4). JEV strains revealed five distinct
phylogenetic groupings, reflecting broad geographical and
temporal relationships. In China, JEV isolates are divided
into three genotypes, GI, GIII and GV recently reported
by Li MH et al [7]. GI strain was firstly isolated in 1979,
whilst GIII strains have been isolated since the 1940s.
Before the 1980s, GIII JEV was predominant in China.
After 2000, there were more and more GIII JEV strains
isolated and there is tendency that major genotype of JEV
isolates changes from GIII to GI . In Japan, major genotype of JEV isolates had shifted from GIII to GI [19] and
this phenomena were also found in Korea[39] and in Vietnam[43]. In mainland China, current vaccines used in
human and pigs are inactivated or attenuated vaccines
that both made up of the GIII JEV and it needs to investigate whether the same genotype shift will occur under the
selected pressure of JEV vaccines.
In summary, here we have isolated GI JEV SX09S-01
strain from swine in Yuncheng in 2009. Its completed
genome was sequenced and molecular characterization
was analysized on the level of nucleotide and amino acid.
Phyogenetic trees based on the full-length genome and E
gene indicate that SX09S-01 strain is most closely related
to the XJ69 strain. Future study should be aimed to
investigate the efficacy of current vaccines against the
SX09S-01 strain and other Chinese GI JEV strains and
control the JE of pigs in order to prevent human JE.
