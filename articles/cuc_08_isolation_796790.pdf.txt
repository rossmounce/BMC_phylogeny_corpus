Abstract
Background: Cultivated peanut or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is the fourth most important oilseed
crop in the world, grown mainly in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates. Due to its origin
through a single and recent polyploidization event, followed by successive selection during breeding
efforts, cultivated groundnut has a limited genetic background. In such species, microsatellite or simple
sequence repeat (SSR) markers are very informative and useful for breeding applications. The low level of
polymorphism in cultivated germplasm, however, warrants a need of larger number of polymorphic
microsatellite markers for cultivated groundnut.
Results: A microsatellite-enriched library was constructed from the genotype TMV2. Sequencing of 720
putative SSR-positive clones from a total of 3,072 provided 490 SSRs. 71.2% of these SSRs were perfect
type, 13.1% were imperfect and 15.7% were compound. Among these SSRs, the GT/CA repeat motifs
were the most common (37.6%) followed by GA/CT repeat motifs (25.9%). The primer pairs could be
designed for a total of 170 SSRs and were optimized initially on two genotypes. 104 (61.2%) primer pairs
yielded scorable amplicon and 46 (44.2%) primers showed polymorphism among 32 cultivated groundnut
genotypes. The polymorphic SSR markers detected 2 to 5 alleles with an average of 2.44 per locus. The
polymorphic information content (PIC) value for these markers varied from 0.12 to 0.75 with an average
of 0.46. Based on 112 alleles obtained by 46 markers, a phenogram was constructed to understand the
relationships among the 32 genotypes. Majority of the genotypes representing subspecies hypogaea were
grouped together in one cluster, while the genotypes belonging to subspecies fastigiata were grouped
mainly under two clusters.
Conclusion: Newly developed set of 104 markers extends the repertoire of SSR markers for cultivated
groundnut. These markers showed a good level of PIC value in cultivated germplasm and therefore would
be very useful for germplasm analysis, linkage mapping, diversity studies and phylogenetic relationships in
cultivated groundnut as well as related Arachis species.

Background
The cultivated peanut or groundnut, Arachis hypogaea L.,
(2n = 4x = 40) is a major crop in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world, with 68% of groundnut cultivated world-wide produced in Asia (23 Mt), 24% in Africa
(8 Mt) and the remaining 8% (3.5 Mt) from North America, the Caribbean, Europe and Oceania [1]. The seeds are
used for direct human consumption, and as an oil and
protein source [2]. Additionally, plant residues are
extremely important as fodder for cattle in many regions
of the world [3]. The crop is becoming increasingly important as an income source in tree plantations before tree
crops mature. In Africa and Asia, groundnut is intercropped between maize, sorghum, and soybean or, in a
few areas, between mature coconut trees [4].
In contrast to the wealth of phenotypic diversity observed
within cultivated groundnut, the genetic diversity
observed to date within the cultivated gene-pool is much
lower. This low level of genetic variation in cultivated
groundnut is attributed to its origin from a single polyploidization event that occurred relatively recently on an
evolutionary time scale [5]. However, additional contributing factors to the low levels of molecular polymorphism
observed to date could be the marker techniques used and
the amount of diversity of samples tested [6].
Molecular markers, in general, and microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in particular have proven very
useful for crop improvement in many species [7]. In
groundnut, the use of molecular markers for breeding
applications, however, has been limited by the low level
of the genetic variation in this species. Nevertheless, in
recent years, significant efforts have been made to develop
the SSR markers in groundnut [8-10]. Development of
SSR markers traditionally requires cloning and sequencing and hence is more cost and labour-intensive, compared to PCR arbitrary priming techniques e.g. randomly
amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) [7]. However, once
the SSR markers are developed, their applications in
breeding activities particularly using high throughput
approaches becomes very cost effective. To isolate the
SSRs from genomic DNA libraries, several approaches for
creating SSR-enriched genomic libraries have been developed, with SSR selection either before [11-13] or after
genomic library construction [14].
By using different approaches, > 500 SSRs have been
developed in groundnut [15]. By using these SSR markers,
good progress has been made in developing the genetic
maps and diversity studies in AA- and BB-genome groundnut species [8,9,16-22]. In case of cultivated germplasm,
however, these SSR markers showed very low level of polymorphism [8,19-22]. This is one of the reasons that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/55

despite the availability of moderate number of SSR markers in groundnut, not a single genetic map based on cultivated germplasm has been published so far. To overcome
the low level of polymorphism, one of simple solutions
will be to develop a critical number of SSR markers in
groundnut so that a repertoire of about 200–300 polymorphic SSR markers for cultivated groundnut germplasm may be available.
The present study was initiated in order to isolate and
characterize new microsatellite markers from groundnut,
following a microsatellite enriched genomic library
approach. The overall aim of this study is to enhance the
repertoire of polymorphic SSR markers for cultivated
groundnut germplasm so that genetic mapping and trait
mapping could be feasible in cultivated groundnut.

Results and Discussion
SSR-enriched library
The SSR enriched library was constructed from the genotype TMV2 following by modified method of Fischer and
Bachmann [23]. This library was enriched for CA and CT
SSR repeat motifs. From this library, 3,072 clones were
picked from 32 96-well plates. Hybridization of these
clones with digoxigenin-labeled SSR probes (CA and CT)
provided 720 (23.4%) putatively positive clones.
Sequencing of these clones indicated the insert size in the
range of 50 bp to 792 bp with an average size of 309 bp.
Majority of clones (43.9%) contained the insert of moderate size (200 bp-400 bp) while 34.6% clones contained
small inserts (50 bp-200 bp) and 21.5% clones contained
inserts of > 500 bp.

Analysis of sequence data mentioned above with Tandem
Repeat Finder (TRF) had 490 (68%) clones which contained one or more SSRs. The efficiency of the enrichment
procedure for the constructed library was higher as compared to other SSR isolation studies of groundnut. Like the
present study, 61% of clones were found to contain SSRs
in the study of He and colleagues [20], 56% clones had
SSRs in the study of Gimenes and colleagues [18] and
43.7% clones were reported to contain SSRs by Wang and
colleagues [24]. However very low enrichment efficiency
(10% to 31%) were obtained in some other libraries
enriched for SSRs [8,9,21]. Indeed, this enrichment efficiency depends on many factors including the choice of
restriction enzyme used for library construction, the SSR
probes used for enrichment, etc. The approach used in the
present study seems to be the most efficient enrichment
strategy for SSR isolation in groundnut.
A redundancy level of 26% in the SSR-enriched genomic
library was observed through multiple sequence alignment analysis using the ClustalW programme; in total 5
copies of one clone was observed, 4 copies of five clones,

3 copies of 10 clones and 2 copies of 65 clones. The rate
of redundant SSR-containing clones was found to be comparable (26%) to other studies utilizing microsatelliteenriched genomic libraries in other plant species, e.g.,
olive tree (Olea europaea L., 16.6%) [25], onion (Allium
cepa L. 24.3%) [23]. As compared to SSR isolation studies
in groundnut where upto 67% redundancy has been
observed [8,20,21], the strategy employed in the present
study seems to be quite effective to isolate a higher proportion of novel and unique SSRs. Observed level of
redundancy in this study could be explained due to the
existence of multiple copies of some SSRs in the groundnut genome, which may be present on both the A and B
genomes within cultivated A. hypogaea. The bias observed
for some SSRs being repeated in multiple clones could
also be explained by the fact that during the enrichment
procedure (adaptor ligation, amplification of singlestrand enriched DNA, bacterial growth before plating)
some fragments can be arbitrarily selected over the rest.
Despite the addition of excess adapter during the enrichment procedures, 7.2% of clones were identified as concatenates, generated during the initial restriction/ligation
step, by the presence of internal RsaI and MluI restriction
sites. Another type of concatenation may be formed during the PCR step of the enrichment cloning procedure
[27]. Such chimeras usually remain undetected and may
result in the failure of some primer pairs to amplify
genomic DNA templates in the evaluation of primers [28].
Occurrence and features of SSRs
Sequence analysis of 720 clones showed the presence of
one or more SSRs in 490 (68%) clones. Following the definitions of Weber [29], 71.2% of the SSRs identified were
perfect, 13.1% were imperfect (when SSRs are interrupted
by few bases) and 15.7% were compound (when more
than one SSRs are spaced by few base pairs) with 9.8%
being compound perfect and 5.9% being compound
imperfect. Similar kind of distribution of different SSR
classes was observed in different SSR isolation studies in
groundnut [8,9,18].

In terms of the repeat motifs, the GT/CA repeat motif was
the most common, accounting for 37.6% of all repeat
types, followed by GA/CT repeat at 25.9%. The previous
surveys carried out on microsatellite abundance in plant
genomes have shown AT as the most frequently occurring
dinucleotide repeat motifs followed by AG/CT and GT/CA
[30-34]. The AT repeat is self-complementary and is difficult to screen for by colony hybridization, hence the
library was not enriched for AT. Abundance of GA/CT,
GT/CA, AT and ATT repeat motifs in isolated SSRs in
groundnut in the present study is in agreement with earlier reports on isolation of SSRs in groundnut [8,9,20,24].
The use of separate GA and GT filters could increase the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/55

ability of detecting perfect GA/CT and GT/CA repeat
motifs or the frequency of the repeats, in comparison to
using mixtures of different repeat motifs in the same
hybridization. However several studies have shown the
retrieval of higher proportion of compound SSRs (upto
75%) when the library was enriched using a mixture of
different SSR oligos [18,35,36].
The maximum repeat unit number of dinucleotide repeat
motifs of GT/CA and GA/CT were 48 and 50 units, respectively; the overall repeat motif number ranging from 7 to
50. In fact, in some studies, the markers developed for
longer repeat motifs were found more informative for
detection of polymorphism in cultivated groundnut
germplasm [9]. In addition to GT and GA repeats containing SSRs, several SSRs containing the repeat motifs(AAG)n, (CAA)n, (TAA)n, (TTG)n, (GTT)n, (TTC)n, (CCT)n,
(AAAG)n, (TTTC)n, (TTCTC)n, (CTTTT)n, (CTCTTT)n and
(GTGTTT)n with 2–11 repeat numbers were also isolated.
It was interesting to note that most of the clones containing these repeats had an additional repeat of GT/CA or
GA/CT. Gimenes and colleagues [18] also observed 37%
SSRs with different repeats, like in the present study, that
were not totally complementary sequences to the oligonucelotide probes used. However, the repeat motif ATT is
highly abundant and informative in several legume species like soybean [37], chickpea [38] and pea [39] was not
observed abundant in the present study. In case of
groundnut, many reports are available on isolation and
distribution of SSRs, only two studies [8,9] indicated the
abundance of AAT repeat motifs. In the present study, as
only 720 clones sequenced were selected randomly from
the set of 3072 clones, probably sequencing of larger
number of clones could have showed the abundance of
AAT repeat motifs.
Marker development
SSR containing sequences were used for primer designing
using Primer3 programme. Following the standard criteria: primer length- 18–27 bp; Tm- 57–63°C; GC content
– 40–60%, maximum Tm difference between forward and
reverse primer – 1.5°C, primer pairs were designed for
170 SSR containing clones [see Additional file 1]. Of this
set, 47.1% primer pairs were designed for perfect repeats,
18.2% for imperfect repeats while the remaining 34.7%
for compound repeats. For the remaining sequences, the
primer designing could not be possible as in some cases
sequence quality was poor while in some cases the SSRs
were too near the start or end of the insert. The percentage
of primers designed, in relation to the number of clones
sequenced (23.6%) is higher than some studies in
groundnut like Moretzsohn and colleagues [9] (10.5%),
He and colleagues [20] (14.0%) and Ferguson and colleagues [8] (21.3%) while lower than some other reports
such as Moretzsohn and colleagues [21] (41.4%) and

Wang and colleagues [24] (43.7%). This may be attributed to the size range of insert, the restriction enzyme
used for genomic DNA library construction and the
approach used for SSR enrichment, etc. [7].
Newly designed SSR markers were tested for amplification
on two genotypes i.e. TMV2 and ICG 99001. Of this set,
only 104 (61.2%) primer pairs yielded the scorable amplicon in the genotypes examined (Table 1). The functionality of the primer pairs is comparatively lower than the
studies of Ferguson and colleagues [8] and Moretzsohn
and colleagues [9] who observed amplification in 84.9%
and 81.6% cases, respectively. It is noteworthy that several
PCR profiles and PCR optimization strategies were
adopted in above mentioned studies, however in the
present study to save costs and time, PCR conditions for
non-amplifiable markers were not optimized repeatedly.
Out of 104 working primers, 89 (85.6%) primer pairs
were optimized on 65°C -60°C touch down profile, 14
(13.5%) primer pairs optimized on 60°C -55°C touch
down profile while only one (0.9%) primer pair was optimized on 55°C -45°C specific profiles. It is quite likely to
increase the rate of functionality of newly developed
markers by using different PCR conditions and profiles.
It is also noted that the markers for less than 20 repeat
units produced amplicons in about 73% cases, while the
markers containing the higher number of repeat units (>
20) yielded amplicon in 16.7% – 54.5% cases only. It is
possible that higher number of repeat units make the Taq
polymerase unstable that makes it unable to extend alongwith the template DNA [7].
SSR polymorphism
In order to assess the potential of newly developed SSR
marker for detecting the polymorphism in 4× groundnut
genotypes, all the 104 primer pairs yielding PCR products
were tested on the set of 32 genotypes (Table 2). As a
result, only 46 (44.2%) markers showed polymorphism
in the germplasm analyzed (Table 3). Of the 46 primers,
30 primers were for perfect SSRs while 16 primers were for

imperfect SSRs. Marker polymorphism observed in the
present study is higher or comparable to earlier studies on
SSR diversity in cultivated groundnut germplasm. For
example, in two different studies, He and colleagues
observed polymorphism with 29.2% [40] and 33.9%
markers [20] while 35.8% markers showed polymorphism in the study of Moretzsohn and colleagues [9]. In
all these studies, the SSR markers, like in the present
study, were isolated from the genomic DNA libraries. It
seems that either the SSR markers developed in the
present study are more informative or the germplasm surveyed here is more diverse. Higher informativeness of the
newly developed markers is supported by the general theory that degree of polymorphism of the SSR marker
increases with the total length of the repeat [7,9,29]. The
majority of the markers (> 80%) developed here contained more than 10 repeat units for the corresponding
SSRs (Table 1). However, Ferguson and colleagues [8]
observed higher (48.7%) marker polymorphism as compared to this study which can be attributed to the diverse
nature of the germplasm examined in their study.
In recent years, SSR markers have been developed from
the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) because of increasing
the emphasis on developing the functional molecular
markers [10]. Luo and colleagues [22] had 20% of the
markers showing polymorphisms; while Moretzsohn and
colleagues [9] detected polymorphisms in cultivated
germplasm with 7.5% of the markers. Lower level of polymorphism of EST-based SSR markers can be attributed to
their origin from highly conserved proportion of the
genome [41]. In our opinion, the crops like groundnut
having narrow genetic background needs higher number
of SSR markers derived from genomic DNA library instead
from cDNA library or ESTs.
The numbers of alleles detected by the set of 46 polymorphic markers were in the range of 2 to 5 with an average
of 2.44 alleles per locus (Table 3). The PIC value for these
polymorphic markers varied from 0.12 (IPAHM 92) –
0.75 (IPAHM 123) with an average of 0.46 (Table 3).

When looking at SSR classes and motifs, the trinucleotide
SSRs showed higher allele numbers (average 2.5 per
locus) and PIC values (average 0.53 per marker) followed
by dinucleotide (average alleles- 2.45 per locus; PIC valueaverage 0.45 per marker) and compound SSRs (average
alleles- 2.35 per locus; PIC value- average 0.44 per
marker). Among dinucleotide SSRs, GA/CT repeat motifs
exhibited more informativeness (average alleles- 2.6 per
locus and PIC value- average 0.50 per marker) as compared to GT/CA repeat motifs (average alleles- 2.0 per
locus and PIC value- average 0.33 per marker). Ferguson
and colleagues [8] as well as Moretzsohn and colleagues
[9] observed higher informativeness of GA/CT repeat
motifs. Therefore to develop more polymorphic markers
for cultivated groundnut, we propose to isolate and
develop the GA/CT repeat based SSR markers.
To understand the possible relationship between polymorphism of SSR markers with the repeat unit length of
the corresponding SSRs, two scatter plots were made
between repeat unit length and number of alleles detected
(Fig. 1) and the PIC value calculated (Fig. 2). The scatter

plot between number of alleles and repeat unit length
shows the widest variation in number of alleles was
between 13 and 20 repeats and a lower number of alleles
found in the low number or very high number repeats.
However it does not provide any conclusive relationships
between the number of alleles and repeat unit length as
indicated by Ferguson and colleagues [8] and Moretzsohn
and colleagues [9] that loci with longer repeats are much
more likely to be more variable. Indeed, among the polymorphic SSR markers, the IPAHM 147 marker containing
highest number of repeat units (41) provided just 2 alleles
while the IPAHM 103 markers with 20 repeat units long
SSR revealed the highest number of alleles (5). This is possible as the majority of the polymorphic SSR markers
detected 2 and 3 alleles in the present study.
The scatter plot between PIC value and repeat unit length
indicates that the higher PIC values (> 0.50) were between
13 and 20 repeats while lower PIC values were found in
the low number (< 13) or very high number (> 20)
repeats. It is noteworthy that the relationship appeared to
be SSR class specific as it was more consistent for the com-

including in groundnut showed no relationship or weak
correlation between SSR polymorphism and repeat unit

Diversity analysis and genetic relationships
Based on the unique DNA fingerprint profiles of each
accession of cultivated groundnut obtained by the polymorphic markers, a phenogram was constructed to understand the relationships among the cultivated groundnut
germplasm surveyed. The dendrogram based on DICE
similarity coefficient and constructed using the DARwin
programme classified the germplasm in four main clusters
A, B, C and D (Fig. 3). The cluster A contained 14 genotypes, the cluster B contained 8 genotypes while the other
two clusters namely C and D contained 8 and 2 genotypes, respectively. Under each of these main clusters, genotypes were grouped further into sub clusters. For

pound SSRs. As no other report, to the best of our knowledge, is available on relationship between PIC value and
repeat unit length in groundnut, a direct comparison of
the observed results could not be possible.
Based on our investigations on relationship of repeat unit
length with number of alleles or PIC value, no consistent
relationship between the number of repeat units and SSR
polymorphism was observed. It has been reported earlier
that the degree of polymorphism increases with the total

instance, the cluster A contained four subclusters (AI, AII,
AIII and AIV) and the cluster B (BI, BII) and C (CI and CII)
contained two subclusters each.
Majority of the genotypes (8 out of 10) representing subspecies hypogaea (6 hypogaea and 2 hirsuta genotypes) were

found in the main cluster A. The genotypes belonging to
fastigiata subspecies were grouped mainly under the main
clusters B and C. The grouping of genotypes representing
two subspecies in different clusters agrees with the classification of groundnut botanical varieties [44]. However,

Page 7 of 11

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:55

in an earlier study [45] genotypes representing the two
subspecies were classified in only two groups.
The cluster B contained 4 (out of 10) genotypes belonging
to variety fastigiata and three genotypes belonging to variety vulgaris. The cluster C also contained the genotypes
from the fastigiata subspecies that includes 2 genotypes of
variety fastigiata, 2 to variety peruviana and one each from
varieties vulgaris and aequatoriana. The cluster D contained
only 2 genotypes belonging to subspecies fastigiata.
Majority of the nodes under the main clusters were supported by high bootstrap values.
It is important to note that positioning of botanical varieties aequatoriana and peruviana to the subspecies fastigiata
or hypogaea has been debatable in the literature. For
instance, in the past, based on morphological and physiological traits, two botanical varieties were classified
under the subspecies fastigiata (that includes other varieties fastigiata and vulgaris) while AFLP markers suggested
relationships of aequatoriana and peruviana to hypogaea
rather than subspecies fastigiata [45]. The present study
included only two aequatoriana and three peruviana genotypes, and they were grouped under all three major clusters (A, B and C). Nevertheless, like the observations of He
and Prakash [45], four out of the five genotypes representing aequatoriana and peruviana subspecies showed closer
relationships with the hypogaea genotypes (clusters AII
and CII) while only one genotype of peruviana subspecies
(ICG 1705) showed some proximity to subspecies fastigiata. The botanical variety peruviana, based on RAPD and
ISSR marker data, was classified as an operational taxonomic unit in addition to four varieties i.e. fastigiata, vulgaris (both belonging to subspecies fastigiata), runner and
bunch (both belonging to subspecies hypogaea) [46].
It is interesting to note that the two accessions with resistance to leaf rust (ICGV 99003 and ICGV 99005) were
grouped together (AII) and similarly the other two accessions resistance to late leaf spot (ICGV 99001 and ICGV
99004) were grouped together (BI). It seems that genotypes resistant to leaf rust and late leaf spot shared the
pedigree or have the same resource of resistance. However, three accessions resistance to early leaf spot (ICG
405, ICG 1705 and ICG 6284) were scattered in the dendrogram. The accession, TMV2, susceptible to all three diseases (leaf rust, late leaf spot and early leaf spot) was
present under cluster B. The dendrogram suggests the
potential parental genotypes having higher genetic diversity for constructing the mapping population(s) for mapping the leaf rust, late leaf spot and early leaf spot. Even
selection and utilization of diverse cultivars in breeding
programmes is needed to enhance the diversity of breeding populations for selection gains in the future [47].

Conclusion
The results of this study highlight a reliable and efficient
way of obtaining microsatellites markers from cultivated
groundnut. It is desirable to isolate and characterize more
DNA markers in cultivated groundnut for more productive genomic studies, such as genetic mapping, markerassisted selection, and gene discovery. Construction and
sequencing of SSR enriched library yielded a total of 400
SSRs, however, primer pairs could be designed for only
170 SSRs of which 104 primer pairs showed the functionality. As a result, the present study contributes a new set of
104 SSR markers for cultivated groundnut. In order to
assess the potential of newly developed markers for germplasm analysis, screening of these markers on 32 genotypes showed reasonable level of polymorphism. Newly
developed markers detected on average 2.44 alleles per
locus with an average PIC value 0.46. The present study
also provided some indications about nature and type of
repeat class or length of SSRs on the polymorphism of corresponding SSR marker. Finally, the SSR markers, developed in this study would be very useful for germplasm
analysis, population genetic structure and phylogenetic
relationships.

Methods
Plant material
For constructing the SSR-enriched genomic libraries, the
groundnut germplasm line TMV2, belonging to the Spanish botanical variety was used. While two genotypes
(TMV2 and ICG 99001) were used for optimizing the PCR
assays for newly developed SSR markers, a set of 32 genotypes were used for identifying the potential polymorphic
markers for cultivated groundnut germplasm (Table 2).
Of these 32 genotypes, 10 genotypes represent the subspecies hypogaea (2 to variety hirsuta and 8 to variety hypogaea)
and the remaining 22 genotypes belong to subspecies fastigiata (10 to variety fastigiata, 7 to variety vulgaris, 3 to
variety peruviana and 2 to variety aequatoriana).
DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA was isolated from unfurled leaves
according to a modified CTAB-based procedure [48]. The
quality of DNA was checked on 1% agarose gels and the
DNA concentrations using spectrophotometer UV- 160A
following the recommendations of manufacturer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).
Construction of SSR-enriched library
A modified protocol of Fischer and Bachmann [23] was
used for constructing the SSR enriched library. Six micrograms of genomic DNA genomic were digested by blunt
end – generating restriction endonuclease RsaI. After confirming digestion on agarose gel electrophoresis, the MluI
adapter, consisting of a 21-mer (5'-CTCTTGCTTACGCGTGGACTA-3') and a phosphorylated 25-mer (5'-pTAGTC-

CACGCGTAAGCAAGAGCACA-3') was ligated to the
blunt termini of restriction fragments using 50 ng
adapter/μg of genomic DNA. Ligation was performed for
2 hours at 37°C in order to allow the restriction digest to
continue, hence preventing the DNA fragments from religating to one another. The ligation products were then
separated on a 1% TAE agarose gel and fragments size
from 100–900 bp and 900–1500 bp cut from the gel and
purified with GFX Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham
Biosciences, USA). The constructs were then heat denatured and hyribridised to biotinylated microsatellite oligonucleotides. The hybridizations were carried out using
75 μl of 6×SSC and 150 nM of each biotinylated oligo
(GT)15 and (GA)15 overnight at Thyb= Tm-5°C. The hybrids
were subsequently bound to streptavidin – coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M -280 Streptavidin- Dynal, Norway). In order to capture the target sequences, the beads
were incubated either at room temperature for 15 min for
the 100–900 bp fragments or at 43°C for one hour for the
900–1500 bp fragments. Non-hybridizing genomic DNA
was subsequently removed through a series of washes;
twice in 2× SSC; 0.1% SDS (5 mins each, at 25°C), twice
in 1× SSC (5 mins each, at 25°C) and finally twice in
1×SSC at Thyb for 2 and 5 mins respectively. The bound
DNA was eluted as single stranded fragments in TE preheated to 95°C.
The hybridized DNA fragments served as a template for
PCR using the 21-mer oligonucleotide as the primer (30
cycles with 56°C annealing temperature). Following PCR,
like samples were combined and purified using the GFX
column purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, USA).
The purified PCR products were then digested with MluI
to obtain vector-compatible, sticky ended fragments by
incubation at 37°C overnight. The restriction fragments
were purified using a MicroSpin™ column (Amersham
Biosciences, USA) prior to ligation into a modified
pUC19 vector (pJV1) (Edwards et al., 1996 [11]) which
had been linearized with BssHII and dephosphorylated.
The ligated vector fragments were transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen, USA), plated on LB
agar containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). To allow for
blue-white selection, the plates were spread with 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal;
80 μg/ml) plus isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG; 80 μg/ml). White colonies were picked and plated
in a grid on LB containing ampicillin, prior to making colony lifts with Nylon Membranes, positively charged, following the recommendation of manufacturer (Amersham
Biosciences, USA). Hybridization was carried out at 42°C
overnight using digoxigenin-labelled probes containing
the SSR motifs being searched (Roche, Germany).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/55

Sequencing of SSR-positive clones
The SSR positive clones identified after hybridization were
grown overnight in 3 ml LB broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was extracted using GFX™ Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Biosciences, USA).
Subsequently, the plasmid DNA was sequenced using
M13 Forward 24-mer Sequencing Primer following the
dideoxynucleotide chain termination method on ABI
3700 sequencer. Base calling was carried out using Phred
[49]. Sequence data were quality trimmed using the sliding windows of 50 bp with a minimal average Phred score
of 20.
SSR identification and primer designing
The sequencing data were analysed using the ClustalW
programme in order to determine the rate of redundancy
in the library. Non-redundant sequences were analysed
with Tandem Repeat Finder software [50]. The SSR containing sequences were subsequently used for primer
design using Primer3 programme. Primers were designed
from within the regions flanking the repeat motifs; for
dinucleotides the repeat motifs selected were greater than
14 bp in length, trinucleotides greater than 15 bp and
tetranucleotides greater than 16 bp.
Amplification and visualization of microsatellite loci
PCR reactions for all the primer pairs were performed in 5
μl reaction volume following three touch down profiles
i.e. 65–55°C (89 markers), 60–55°C (14 markers) and
55–45°C (1 marker). The PCR was performed on 5 ng of
genomic DNA with varying amount of primer pairs, Mg2+,
dNTPs and Taq DNA polymerase. Details on these reaction components for each primer pair (marker), that
yielded PCR amplicon, are given in Additional file 1.
Touch down amplification programs included 94°C for 2
min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, annealing temperature
(65–55°C/60–55°/55–45°C) for 60 sec, 72°C for 60 sec
and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.

The PCR products were separated on a non- denaturing
6% polyacrylamide gel at 250 V for 2.5 to 3 hours in 1×
TBE buffer and visualized by silver staining, modified
from Kolodny [51]. The presence or absence of amplicons
in the genotypes examined was scored as 1 or 0, respectively.
Statistical analysis
The polymorphism information content (PIC) of each
microsatellite locus was determined as described by Weir
[52]:

PIC = 1-Σ Pi2,
where Pi is the frequency of the ith allele in the genotypes
examined.

Allelic data obtained in 0–1 fashion for all alleles at microsatellite loci amplified were used for computing the
inter-individual genetic dissimilarity following simple
matching coefficient by using DARwin v 5.0.153 programme [53]. The dissimilarity matrix thus generated was
further used to generate UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic mean) dendrogram following
neighbour-joining (NJ) by using the DARwin programme.
