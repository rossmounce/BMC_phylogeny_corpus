Abstract
Background: Accurate formal taxonomic designations are thought to be of critical importance
for the conservation of endangered taxa. The Galápagos sea lion (GSL), being appreciated as a key
element of the Galápagos marine ecosystem, has lately been listed as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN. To
date there is, however, hardly any scientific evidence, whether it constitutes a separate entity from
its abundant Californian neighbour (CSL). In this paper, we delineate the taxonomic relationships
within the genus Zalophus being comprised of the Galápagos sea lion, the Californian sea lion and
the already extinct Japanese sea lion (JSL).
Results: Using a set of different phylogenetic reconstruction approaches, we find support for
monophyly of all three taxa without evidence of reticulation events. Molecular clock estimates
place time to common ancestry of the Galápagos sea lion and the Californian sea lion at about 2.3
± 0.5 mya. Genetic separation is further suggested by diagnostic SNPs in the mitochondrial and
nuclear genome. Microsatellite markers confirm this trend, showing numerous private alleles at
most of the 25 investigated loci. Microsatellite-based estimates of genetic differentiation between
the Galápagos sea lion and the Californian sea lion indicate significant genetic differentiation. Gene
diversity is 14% lower in the Galápagos sea lion than in the Californian sea lion, but there is no
evidence for recent bottleneck events in the Galápagos sea lion.
Conclusion: Based on molecular evidence we build a case for classifying the Galápagos sea lion
(Zalophus wollebaeki), the Californian sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and the Japanese sea lion
(Zalophus japonicus) as true species. As morphological characters do not necessarily fully reflect the
rapid divergence on the molecular level, the study can be considered as a test case for deriving
species status from molecular evidence. We further use the results to discuss the role of genetics
in conservation policy for an organism that already is under the general protection of the habitat it
lives in.

Background
Conservation effort is directed to biological units that can
largely differ in scale ranging from a single target species
to entire biocoenoses. It is nonetheless believed to be
imperative in all cases that the conservation unit of interest ought to be operationally defined. On the level of single species, the concept of evolutionary significant units
(ESU) has successfully been implemented to determine
population units that merit separate conservation management [see [1]]. However, even in long-managed populations ecological, geographical and genetic borders, core
to the ESU concept, are not always clearly delineated. This
is well illustrated in the case of the endemic Galápagos sea
lion, whose geographical range is well defined (Fig. 1),
while it is unclear if it constitutes a unique ecological and
evolutionary entity.
The Galápagos sea lion is one of the most conspicuous
marine organisms of the Galápagos archipelago. Not only
does it play a central role as a key predator in the Galápagos marine ecosystem. With its playful behaviour and
friendly appearance it engages the sympathy of thousands
of national and international visitors year by year and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/20

constitutes a keystone reference for the preservation of
marine resources in the Galápagos Islands. As other
marine organisms in the Galápagos it deserves special
attention from a conservation viewpoint, being subject to
extreme changes in food availability triggered by climatic
fluctuations of the El Niño Southern Oscillation events.
During such an event, mortality drastically increases and
can lead to the loss of entire cohorts [2]. Population recovery may be increasingly hampered by human activities, in
particular by the increasing depletion of marine resources,
often in disrespect of existing regulations [[3], see also
[4]]. While in the early 1960s its population was estimated at about 20.000 to 50.000 individuals and
described as abundant [5,6], recent census results suggest
that numbers have declined since the late 70s to approximately 14.000 individuals at present [7]. The 'IUCN Red
List of Threatened Species™', which classifies species at
high risk of global extinction, has categorized it as 'vulnerable' in 1996 [8]. In contrast, the Californian sister population has experienced steady growth over the last three
decades [9] reaching numbers of 167.000–188.00 with a
yearly pup production of about 33.000 [10]. It is classified
at 'lower risk with least concern'. The JSL is considered

extinct; the last credible reports date back to the late
1950s.
The taxonomic status within the three allopatric taxa of
the genus Zalophus that so markedly differ in the degree of
threat is contentious and inconsistently treated by the scientific community. Originally, the GSL has been
described as a new species, Zalophus wollebaeki [11], but
was soon relegated to sub-species level by Scheffer [12]. A
representative screen of several citation databases illustrates this taxonomic uncertainty, as all of the three taxa
have been treated as both subspecies and full species until
today [e.g. [13,14]]. In pinniped phylogenies, the existence of the GSL is usually ignored [15,16]. Marine mammal encyclopaedias also differ in their viewpoint without
specifying the reasons for their decision [10,17-20].
The aim we pursue in this study is twofold. In a first step,
we address the taxonomic relationships within the three
taxa of the genus Zalophus. We tackle the problem from
the perspectives of both systematics and population biology, an approach that is more and more appreciated to
confront species uncertainty in conservation [21]. The
former will help to clarify the existence of characters that
are shared uniquely among the specimens assigned to one
taxon, and allows delineation in a purely taxonomic
sense. The inclusion of the taxa into the broader phylogenetic context of all otariid species will further help to estimate genetic divergence, the degree of reproductive and
historical isolation and will also contribute to a better
understanding of pinniped phylogeny. The latter
approach based on population genetics, describes evolutionary processes such as gene flow and helps to decide,
whether it is justified to view the populations as separate
evolutionary entities.
Second, we use our results to discuss the role of genetics
in conservation policy for an organism that already is
under the general protection of the nature reserve it lives
in. We raise the question, whether better taxonomic classification is likely to affect conservation policy. We further
address the important issue of genetic depauperation that
can correlate with a population's resilience to introduced
diseases.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA
Position of the GSL and the CLS within the otariid phylogeny
The phylogenetic reconstruction based on part of the
mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b gene supports the major topological relationships within the otariid seals as suggested by Wynen and co-workers [15].
Sister group relationship of the two remnant Zalophus taxa
is clearly exposed by both Bayesian and maximum parsimony analysis (Fig. 2). The Steller sea lion (Eumetopias

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/20

jubatus) proves to be the neighbouring clade. A clear split
between the CSL and GSL is supported by Bayesian analysis with maximum posterior probabilities for both clades
(straight numbers Fig. 2). In the maximum parsimony
bootstrap consensus, the GSL is still found to be monophyletic with high bootstrap support, while the Californian clade holds up with medium support (italic numbers
Fig. 2). As the alignment with all otariid species compromises the resolution of the tree, we additionally estimated
genetic divergence between the two Zalophus taxa separately making use of the entire available sequence information (1123 bp alignment). The number of fixed
differences is considerably higher for the control region
(9/623 bp) than for the cytochrome b gene (1/500 bp).
Molecular clock estimates are based on the Bayesian consensus tree, using the Phocina clade (Phoca vitulina and
Halichoerus grypus) for calibration (see Methods). Minimum radiation time for the CSL and the GSL are estimated at 1.31 ± 0.43 mya and 0.58 ± 0.29 mya,
respectively. Time to common ancestry of the Californian
and the Galápagos sea lion is calculated to be in the range
of 2.3 ± 0.5 mya.
Relationships within the genus Zalophus
To account for the fact that the observed split between the
GSL and the CSL might be specific for the Monterey population used in the overall otariid tree, we conducted a
detailed analysis on the genus Zalophus including
sequences of the JSL and a broader sampling of CSL populations (see Methods). Although only a relatively short
sequence is available for all these samples (301 bp) the
Bayesian tree identifies all three taxa as monophyletic
with reasonable posterior probabilities (Fig. 3). Within
the CLS divergence is high and the population in the Gulf
of California stands out as a possible unit of its own.

Phylogenetic network approaches reproduce the pattern
without showing reticulation between the taxa (Fig.
4A,B). In the parsimony based median-joining algorithm
(Fig. 4B) individuals from one taxon form particularly
clear clusters. Again, divergence within the CSL is evident.
Nuclear microsatellites
The mitochondrial evidence for monophyly of the CSL
and the GSL is underpinned by markers of the nuclear
genome. Both, the CSL and the GSL show numerous private alleles in 18 and 23 out of 25 microsatellite loci
respectively (Table 1). Moreover, the two clades constitute
separate population clusters in two Bayesian assignment
approaches, assigning every single individual correctly
with mean admixture proportions of 1.0000 in STRUCTURE and 0.9934 (± 0.0008SE) in BAPS pointing to a
complete lack of exchange of individuals.

model) are shown above with branches in non-italicised numbers and parsimony bootstrap support values below the nodes in
italics (5000 replicates).

Traditional population genetic measures also indicate a
clear quantitative differentiation between the taxa far
above random level (G-statistic: p < 0.001). All estimates
of population differentiation are high, although they vary
considerably. Estimators of Rst, taking allele size into
account, are more than twice as high as Fst estimates
based on the infinite allele assumption (SMM: Rst = 0.43;
IAM: Gst' = 0.20; θ = 0.21 ± 0.03SE). This difference
reflects bimodality in allele sizes and underlines the high
number of private alleles in each taxon. Strongly differing
sample sizes do not affect estimates of differentiation statistics. Population comparisons of CSL and ten random,
equally sized sub-samples of the larger GSL database produce similar estimates (SMM: Rst = 0.40 ± 0.006; IAM:
Gst' = 0.20 ± 0.002SE; θ = 0.20 ± 0.002SE). All ten comparisons indicate highly significant population differenti-

ation, even when taking multiple testing into account.
Overall, genetic distance between the CSL and GSL is an
order of magnitude larger than within populations of the
GSL (Rst = 0.010, Gst' = 0.009, θ = 0.009).
Nuclear SNPs
In addition to microsatellite markers, we screened 13
unlinked loci of the nuclear genome for single nucleotide
polymorphisms using genomic DNA pools of 11 individuals for each population. Out of a total of 4606 bp, we
find one diagnostic difference and four polymorphic sites
that are fixed in only one taxon (last two columns of Table
2).

Genetic variation and bottleneck
Gene diversity is significantly lower in the GSL than in the
CSL (mean over all loci: GSL 0.622 ± 0.035SE; CSL 0.720
± 0.030SE, Wilcoxon-test: V = 49, p = 0.0118). Mean
allelic richness is lower only in tendency in the GSL (GSL:
5.22 ± 0.41SE; CSL 6.04 ± 0.58SE; Wilcoxon-test: V = 69,
p = 0.063). Random sub-sampling in the GSL confirms
that gene diversity and allelic richness estimates are hardly
influenced by differing sample sizes (bootstrapped range

of mean gene diversity: 0.585–0.632, range of mean
allelic richness: 5.00–5.37).
None of the loci, nor any of the sampled colonies deviates
significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Tests for
a very recent bottleneck, as assessed by statistics looking
for heterozygote excess, detect no evidence for a bottleneck neither under the SMM nor under the TPM (W.-test
one-sided: p = 1.00).

Discussion
Taxonomic status of the genus Zalophus
It was one goal of this study to address taxonomic relationships within the genus Zalophus in order to better
delineate conservation units of interest. Despite of all difficulties with the species concept as such [22], to our
understanding we can build a case for classifying the JSL,
the GSL and the CSL as true species relative to the taxonomic practice in the entire group of the eared seals (Otariidae).
Japanese sea lion
Several phylogenetic reconstruction methods support
monophyly for the JSL with no apparent signs of reticulation with other taxa. Our results are in line with other
studies that claimed species status for the JSL based on
morphological data [23,24]. As to our knowledge there is
no conflicting evidence for this, we suggest to consider
species status for the JSL as the null hypotheses for further
studies and recommend calling it Zalophus japonicus hereafter.

Californian sea lion and Galápagos sea lion
It also seems justified to reinstall species status for the
GSL, as originally proposed by Sivertsen [11]. This is supported by several lines of evidence.

1) Bayesian approaches suggest reciprocal monophyly for
the sister taxa (genealogical species concept). Although
the amount of mtDNA divergence between the GSL and
the CSL is low, it lies within the range of well established
otariid species [15].
2) Molecular time estimates place the time to common
ancestry at about 2.5 mya. This degree of historical isolation is not uncommonly small among pinniped species
[16].
3) Ten diagnostic markers in the mitochondrial as well as
one marker in the nuclear genome show that unequivocal
assignment into distinct taxonomic units is possible
(diagnostic species concept).
4) Evidence of clear separation between the GSL and the
CSL is bolstered by population genetic analysis on the

basis of microsatellite markers. Private alleles are found
for nearly all loci in both taxa. While the high number of
private alleles detected in the GSL could be considered as
an artefact of low sample sizes in the CSL, the reverse is
clearly not the case. Unique alleles found for the GSL can
be regarded as real, since more than 1200 individuals
from all over the Galápagos archipelago are very likely to
reflect the full allelic inventory of the population. What is
more, allele size distributions are often bimodal where
each peak reflects one taxon. This further indicates that
private alleles are more than occasional sampling dropouts. Moreover, bimodality in allele sizes also explains
that Rst estimates are almost twice as high than estimates
for Fst. Both estimates of genetic differentiation, as well as
the assignment test point towards complete reproductive
isolation (strict allopatry, biological species concept).
Even if casual observations of long-distance migrants are
considered, CSL and GSL ranges do not overlap [10]. This
is not astounding, as populations of the CSL and the GSL
are isolated by vast expanses of unproductive tropical
waters.
In summary, analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
suggests that the GSL and the CSL are two distinct genetic

entities that deserve species status. This evidence is partly
supported by behavioural studies [25,26], but contrasts
with recent analyses based on morphological discrimination where a few outliers do not perfectly cluster in their
group [23]. Cranial morphometric characters may thus
not reflect the rapid divergence on the molecular level in
the two species under study, or may be subject to convergent plasticity effects.
Conservation management
It is widely believed that "bad taxonomy can kill", i.e. that
an accurate taxonomic delineation of conservation units
is of critical importance in conservation biology [27].
However, for a species that already is protected in its core
range, is there anything to be gained by clarification of its
taxonomic status beyond mere scientific interest? Conservation problems in the Galápagos have seriously
increased with dramatically increased tourism and immigration into the archipelago over the last 10 years. Plans
of long-line and drift net fishing even within the protected
zone have recently been discussed seriously. Thus, the
finding that the GSL constitutes a genetically unique population strengthens the position of the Galápagos
National Park to argue against aggressive exploitation of

Loci marked with an asterisk were derived from nuclear genome sequences of Canis familiaris and can be found in the ENSEMBL data base.
Remaining loci have been specifically cloned for the Galápagos sea lion and are accessible via GenBank. Sequences containing microsatellite repeats
are marked as such (MSAT). Repeat unit stretches were excluded for the analysis

the marine reserve. But even more importantly, our findings show very clearly that in case of drastic population
decline, no recruitment can be expected from populations
outside the Galápagos archipelago. If the GSL disappears
from the Galápagos Islands it is lost worldwide.
The amount of genetic diversity is another issue of concern in conservation biology. Gene diversity in the GSL is
only about 14% lower than in the CSL, but this estimate
is conservative for three reasons. 1) The real diversity of
the CSL is expected to be higher, as our samples were only
derived from a single area (Monterey), whereas samples of
the GSL cover its entire distribution. 2) Samples sizes were
considerably lower in the CSL and 3) there is an ascertainment bias as the majority of microsatellites were developed for the GSL. The lower degree of genetic diversity is
not due to a single recent severe El Niño event, as we
found no evidence for recent bottlenecks. Instead, it is
more likely a reflection of repeated bottlenecks which
would lead to a generally reduced effective population
size as has been suggested for the Galápagos Penguin [28].
This explanation also fits with the overall lower mitochondrial diversity of the GSL compared to the CSL (Fig.
2, 3). The lowered genetic diversity in the GSL relative to

the CSL may be of concern, as reduced lowered genetic
diversity can negatively affect resilience to environmental
challenges and can correlate with increased disease susceptibility [29]. Taking into account that sea lion colonies
partly overlap with ever growing human settlements and
sea lions virtually come into people's houses and physically interact with humans and dogs, an immediate threat
to a population with low genetic diversity is not a farfetched scenario. This danger is particularly acute, as distemper virus and possibly also rabies (non-confirmed case
in Isabela) that are known to ravage pinniped populations
have been documented in dogs (M. Cruz, S. J. Goodman,
A. A. Cunningham, personal communication). Management decisions reinforcing the separation between
humans, feral or domestic carnivores and sea lions are
urgently needed. Even vaccination programs on the dog
population in proximity to sea lion colonies as e.g. in San
Cristobal, Santa Cruz and Isabela might be advisable.

Conclusion
Based on molecular evidence we suggest treating the
Galápagos sea lion, the Californian sea lion and the Japanese sea lion by the name of species Zalophus wollebaeki
and Zalophus californianus and Zalophus japonicus, respec-

tively. We point out that -contrary to recent practice – all
three species should be included in future studies on pinniped phylogeny. The strong divergence within the Californian sea lion further calls for a diligent analysis of the
Californian clade [see also [30]].
Regarding conservation of the Galápagos sea lion we
deem the general protection provided by the Galápagos
National Park highly warranted. Moreover, given its small
geographical range, the variable ecological conditions in
its marine habitat and increasing human-induced pressure, we recommend devising more specific conservation
management plans for this vulnerable species.

Methods
Laboratory procedures and data analyses of molecular
markers
Sample collection and DNA extraction
GSL: A total of 376 skin samples were collected from the
interdigital membrane of the hind flippers of pups (< 3
months of age) at their natal rookeries and stored in 70 %
ethanol. Sampling locations were uniformly spread across
the Galápagos archipelago except the northernmost
islands of Darwin and Wolf. Genomic DNA was extracted
with the DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen ™) and stored in TrisEDTA buffer.

CSL: DNA samples of the CSL were supplied from locations of the Pacific Coast (Monterey Bay) central to the
taxon's range containing adults (n = 5) as well as subadult individuals (n = 11).
The striking disproportion in sample sizes is taken into
account in the subsequent analysis of microsatellite data
and discussed in more detail later on. The analysis of
mtDNA data is not affected since we here use only a small
subset of the GSL-samples.
Mitochondrial DNA
Part of the mitochondrial control region (625 bp) and the
cytochrome b gene (500 bp) were amplified in both taxa
by use of PCR with primers that were constructed on the
basis of conserved regions of several mitochondrial pinniped genomes [see e.g. [16]]. After purification by ultrafiltration (Machery Nagel) PCR-products were sequenced
on an ABI 3730 sequencer employing the Bigdye® Terminator 3.1 cycle sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). A
total of ten specimens of the GSL (control region:
AM422165–AM422174, cytb: AM422143–AM422152)
and twelve of the CSL (control region: AM422175–
cytb:
AM422153–AM422164)
were
AM422186,
sequenced (see Table 3). Quality ascertainment and
sequence alignment were conducted using SeqMan™ 6.1.
(DNAStar Inc.). Alignments were evaluated by eye and
corrected where required.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/20

In a first step, we evaluated sister group status in a phylogenetic context including all eared seals (Otariidae). We
used the sequence set from Wynen et al. [15] for both the
cytochrome b gene and the control region and included a
randomly chosen subset of six specimens for the GSL and
six specimens for the CSL. The final alignment of the concatenated sequences of both markers consisted of 59 individuals from 16 taxa. The two phocid species Halichoerus
grypus and Phoca vitulina, on which the phylogenetic tree
was rooted, showed considerable longer sequences in the
control region (335 bp) than the otariid seals (276 to 293
bp). No variation in sequence length was observed for the
cytochrome b sequence (360 bp). Within the otariids a 24
bp region of the mitochondrial control region (bp 116–
140) showed indels in basically all individuals. Sequences
were arranged manually such that the number of nucleotide substitutions was minimized. Otherwise the alignment was unambiguous, several large deletions in the
otariids compared to the phocid sequences could unequivocally be aligned. Final alignment length was 700 bp
including gaps and 617 bp excluding gaps, respectively.
For phylogenetic reconstruction we applied maximum
parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Maximum parsimony analysis was carried out in MEGA 3.1 [31] with the
following settings: unweighted parsimony, close-neighbour interchange heuristic search with 500 random initial
trees, including gaps as fifth character. Alignment gaps
that exclusively related to the outgroup taxa were removed
prior to the analysis. Confidence limits on interior
branches in MP phylogeny reconstruction were estimated
using bootstrap resampling with 5000 replicates [32].
Bayesian analysis was performed using MrBayes 3.1.2.
[33]. To account for differential nucleotide substitution
rates we partitioned the dataset (control region and
codon-specific subsets of the cytochrome b gene) and
chose the most complex evolutionary model of substitution rate and among-site rate variation as a starting point
(GTR +Γ+I). As the more parsimonious HKY model was
slightly less supported (Bayes factor comparisons), and
the analysis in MrBayes is rather robust to over-paramatrization, we here report the outcome of the complex model.
Results obtained from the HKY model yielded the same
results. The program was run twice with four simultaneous chains and two simultaneous runs for one million
generations, every 103 of which a tree was sampled. The
first 50*103 MCMC steps were discarded as burn-in after
which convergence of the Markov chains had long been
reached. 1900 remaining trees of the two runs with highest harmonic mean likelihood were used to construct a
50% majority rule consensus.
Within the order of pinnipeds there is evidence for molecular clock-like sequence evolution [15,34], which was
confirmed by Tajima's relative rate test on the two taxa in

question [35] using the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) as the outgroup. Molecular clock estimates were based
on the work by Arnason and coworkers [16], who place
the basal Phocina split at 4.5 mya. We used one member
of each Phocina clade, Phoca vitulina and Halichoerus grypus, as our calibration point with a minimum divergence
time of 4.5 mya. This estimate is better supported than the
often used 'Phoca standard' [34], which assumed 2.7 mya
for the Phocina split (Arnason, personal communication). Molecular distances are based on the Bayesian consensus tree and correspond to mean branch lengths of the
posterior distribution. Error in divergence estimates stemming from branch length uncertainty were derived as follows: As shorter genetic distances are associated with a
higher proportionate error, a calibration curve was built to

adequately describe this relation and finally to predict the
error associated with a given branch length. We fitted a 2nd
degree polynomial regression on branch length and its
proportionate standard deviation in R [36] and used the
predicted regression curve for calibration.
In a second step, the genus Zalophus including the GSL,
the CLS and the JSL was examined in more detail. As populations of the CSL are known to diverge, a broader sampling across the taxon's range is desirable. To this end we
used published sequences from Maldonado et al. [30] of
the mitochondrial control region from populations further South of the Pacific Coast (Channel Islands) and
from the Gulf of California. Sequences for the mitochondrial control region isolated from ancient DNA of the JSL

have also just become available [37]. A detailed list of
sampling locations and respective sample sizes is given in
Table 3. The phylogenetic analysis had to be restricted to
an alignment including 301 bp of the mitochondrial control region, as the cytochrome b information of the published CSL sequences was of bad quality, and none was
available for the JSL. A phylogenetic tree rooted by the
Steller sea lion was constructed with the Bayesian
approach described above (using HKY as the best model
of nucleotide substitution). To investigate possible reticulations between taxa, we constructed a median-joining
network [38] and a distance based Neighbour-Net network [39] using the software SplitsTree4 [40]. The patterns obtained by these methods were very robust to
different substitution models and were highly repeatable
across other network based approaches.
Microsatellites
Genomic DNA was genotyped for a total of 367 GSL and
16 CSL at 25 fluorescently labelled dinucleotide microsatellite loci using the Qiagen® multiplex PCR Kit. To get an
accurate idea on the allelic inventory of the GSL population, another 853 samples were included exclusively for
the estimation of the number of private alleles (for details
see Table 1). These samples stem from an ongoing behavioural study on the central islet of Caamaño [13,41,42].
Three loci (ZcwG06, Hg63, ZcCgDh4.7) deviated from
Hardy-Weinberg-equilibrium (null alleles) in most of the
sampled Galápagos rookeries and were excluded from the
analysis. The programs STRUCTURE 2.1. [43] and BAPS
4.13. [44] were used to quantify the degree to which individuals cluster within the same taxon. Default settings
were used for individual clustering in BAPS 4.13, run
parameters for analysis in STRUCTURE were as follows:
10 independent runs using correlated allele frequencies
and no admixture as ancestry model, burn in length 6*105
and 106 MCMC steps. Two clusters explained the data
considerably better than assuming one panmictic population of both taxa (ln(P|D)K = 1:-23387.7 ± 0.025SE;
ln(P|D)K = 2:-22416.1 ± 3.74SE). Structural properties
within the Galápagos population are small and of no further interest in the context of this study and will be
described elsewhere (Wolf et al., in prep.). Conventional
Fst estimates [θ [45]] and the Rst estimate following Rousset [46] were used to estimate the degree of genetic differentiation between the sister taxa using Fstat 2.9.3.2. [47].
Standardized pairwise Rst distances [48] were obtained
from the software Microsat 1.5d [49] and used for clusterbased tree reconstruction in the Phylip module Neighbor
[50]. The G statistic proposed by Goudet [51] was used for
statistical inference on population differentiation. As sample sizes markedly differed between compared populations (see above) we explicitly chose an Fst estimators that
is presumably independent of sample size [45]. As sample
sizes were extremely skewed, we examined the effect by

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/20

random sub-sampling nonetheless. We created ten random sub-samples of 20 genotypes each from the GSL and
ran the analyses again. Summary statistics are reported as
means and standard errors.
Microsatellite allele frequency data were further used to
uncover, whether the GSL population underwent a recent
bottleneck event. We estimated gene diversity and allelic
richness separately for each locus using rarefaction estimates implemented in Fstat that standardize for differing
sample sizes. Differences between taxa in the two measures were assessed using Wilcoxon's matched-pairssigned-rank tests as implemented in R [36]. We further
used the software Bottleneck 1.2.02. [52], which makes
use of the fact that in populations, which have experienced a recent reduction in their effective population size,
number of alleles drop quicker than gene diversity. Such
populations will show an unexpected high degree of gene
diversity, if compared to the expected equilibrium gene
diversity computed from the number of alleles [53]. The
relation of observed and expected gene diversity depends
on the assumed mutation model of the marker. As neutral
microsatellite markers are thought to follow a stepwise
mutation model (SSM) rather than an infinite allele
model, we performed the analysis under the assumption
of stepwise mutation and under a two phased model
(TPM), which allows 10% of multi-step mutations, as recommended by the program's authors.
Single nucleotide polymorphism
We further screened the nuclear genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms pursuing two different approaches.
First, we used microsatellite clones that have specifically
been developed for the GSL [for cloning procedure see
[54]] including 'false positive clones' of this screen with
genomic inserts devoid of microsatellite stretches. Second,
we designed primers in exon regions of the dog genome
(Canis familiaris) closing around intron sequences of
appropriate size (700–850 bp). A SNP-pool detection
approach was used to search for fixed differences between
populations [55]. All sequencing reactions were performed on pools of DNA from each taxon including equal
amounts of DNA from 11 specimens each. Sequencing
was conducted as specified above. This direct sequencing
of pooled DNA will somewhat underestimate rare alleles.
In artificial mixing experiments we found that alleles at a
frequency of 10% can still be detected, but alleles below
5% may be missed (Staubach and Tautz, unpublished).
Loci, primers, expected size, length of reliable sequence
and GenBank/ENSEMBL accession number are reported
in Table 2.
