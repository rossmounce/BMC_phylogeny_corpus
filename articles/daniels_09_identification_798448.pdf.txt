Abstract
The transcription machineries of Archaea and eukaryotes are similar in many aspects, but little is
understood about archaeal chromatin and its role in transcription. Here, we describe the
identification in hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota and a Korarchaeon of an orthologue of the
eukaryotic transcription elongation factor Elf1, which has been shown to function in chromatin
structure maintenance of actively transcribed templates. Our discovery has implications for the
relationship of chromatin and transcription in Archaea and the evolution of these processes in
eukaryotes.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Chris P. Ponting and Eugene V. Koonin.

Findings
Despite their prokaryotic morphology, Archaea are more
similar to eukaryotes in their mechanisms of copying and
expression of their genetic information than to bacteria [1].
With the recent description of an RPB8 orthologue (RpoG)
in hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota and a Korarchaeon [2]
and demonstration of its constitutive incorporation into
archaeal RNAP [3], homologues of all of the twelve DNAdependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) eukaryotic core subunits have been identified in Archaea [4]. The structure of the
archaeal RNAP closely resembles the eukaryotic RNAPII [5].
Eukaryotic transcription furthermore depends on accessory
factors aiding initiation. Of those, homologues of eukaryotic
basal transcription initiation factors TBP (TATA-binding protein), TFIIB (transcription factor II B) and of the α-subunit of
TFIIE are found in Archaea (TBP, TFB and TFE) [1].

In eukaryotes, transcription elongation factors assist RNAP
in overcoming pausing and arrest on the template [6]. TFIIS
releases RNAPII from transcriptional arrest by supporting
RNA transcript cleavage, whereas the yeast DSIF complex
consisting of Spt4 and Spt5 (bacterial homologue NusG) is
thought to belong to the class of chromatin elongation factors that affect RNAP transcription through chromatin [7].
The archaeal TFIIS-homologue TFS appears to operate in an
equivalent manner to eukaryotic TFIIS [1]. Also, an orthologue of Spt5/NusG and a protein with sequence and structural similarity to Spt4 have been identified in Archaea,
further supporting the ancestral link between archaeal and
eukaryotic transcription [1].
Elf1 is a transcription elongation factor that has recently been
identified and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a
screen for mutations that cause synthetic lethality with mutaPage 1 of 5

tions in other genes coding for transcription elongation factors [8]. A role for Elf1 in transcription elongation was
demonstrated by genetic interaction with several transcription elongation factor genes, including those coding for
TFIIS, Spt4 and Spt5. Elf1 is recruited to regions of active
transcription [8]. Transcription initiation from a gene-internal site in elf1Δ cells and the production of short transcripts
in an elf1Δ hir1Δ background strongly suggested that Elf1 acts
by maintaining the chromatin structure of active transcription units [8].
During a sensitive sequence-similarity search for transcription elongation factors in an evolutionary wide range of
organisms, we noticed high-scoring hits for Elf1 in a subset
of archaeal predicted proteomes. Consequently, a thorough
search of more archaeal genomes was initiated. A multiple
sequence alignment of Homo sapiens Elf1 (NP_115753.1)
and S.cerevisiae Elf1 (NP_012762.1) was generated using
MAFFT [9] and trimmed to well aligning sequence blocks.
The alignment was then utilized to build a profile-hidden
Markov model [10], which was queried against the predicted
proteomes of 48 archaeal and 28 eukaryotic organisms with
a wide evolutionary diversity (Additional file 1, Tables S1
and S2). Hits with expectation values lower than a threshold
of 10-3 were selected and aligned. The alignment was
trimmed to aligned sequence containing no more than 50%
gaps and sequences were removed so that no sequence pairs
with an identity higher than 95% remained in order to prevent sequence bias. A new hidden-Markov model was built
and the whole process was repeated iteratively until no new
sequences could be identified [11]. This method provides a
sensitive and high-quality dataset of Elf1 homologues.
In this way, we found 46 sequences from 14 archaeal and
25 eukaryotic organisms (Figure 1A; Additional file 1,
Tables S3 and S4). All the Elf1 homologues identified contain a C4-zinc finger signature and most sequences are
characterized by a stretch of up to seven consecutive basic
amino acids at their N-terminus (Figure 1B). All Archaea
and most eukaryotes with an Elf1 only contain a single
gene, although some eukaryotic organisms have lineagespecific gene duplications (Figure 1A). Importantly, Elf1
homologues were restricted to a distinct subset of the
archaeal predicted proteomes. Elf1 was identified only in
hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota and the Korarchaeon
Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum. It was found in none
of the predicted proteomes from Euryarchaeota or in the
mesophilic marine group I Cenarchaeum symbiosum and
Nitrosopumilus maritimus [12-14] (now classified as
belonging to the Thaumarchaeota) [15]. This demonstrates that these organisms either do not have Elf1 orthologues or that homologues in these lineages are very
divergent from both crenarchaeal and eukaryotic versions.
The only hyperthermophilic Creanarchaeon without a hit
for Elf1 in the profile-hidden Markov model-based

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/24

searches of its predicted proteome was Thermofilum pendens. In order to ensure that Elf1 orthologues were not
missed in our searches because they had not been annotated in the predicted proteomes, we conducted tBLASTn
[16] queries of the archaeal genome sequences with all 14
identified archaeal Elf1 proteins and gene order analyses
using the UCSC Archaea genome browser [http://
archaea.ucsc.edu/; Additional file 1, Table S5; [17]]. By
this approach, Elf1 was found in all hyperthermophilic
Crenarchaeota, including T. pendens, and Candidatus K.
cryptofilum, but not in any Euryarchaeota, C.symbiosum or
N.maritimus (Figure 1). Failure to detect an Elf1 orthologue in C.symbiosum and N.maritimus is in agreement
with their phylogenetic position in a separate archaeal
phylum, the Thaumarchaeota, as recently proposed [15].
Although Pfam family PF05129.5 describes many of the
orthologues relationships identified in this work, we
chose our iterative hidden Markov model approach,
because this enabled us to define a species set and gathering threshold which would be both sensitive and selective
for this specific task. Comparison confirms that our
method was more selective (Additional file 1, Fig. S1).
Other iterative procedures, such as PSI-BLAST [16], may
achieve similar results, however.
Interestingly, this phylogenetic distribution is identical to
that of RpoG, the divergent archaeal orthologue of the
eukaryotic RNAP subunit RPB8 [2]. The same group of
archaeal organisms that contain the full set of all twelve
RNAP subunits also has an orthologue of the eukaryotic
transcription elongation factor Elf1. This raises interesting
questions as to whether and how Elf1 functions in archaeal
transcription and whether it interacts with particular subunits of RNAP. Considering the function of yeast Elf1 in the
maintenance of chromatin structure on actively transcribed
genes [8], the issue arises as to how chromatin is constructed
in Archaea. In eukaryotic chromatin, nucleosomes consist of
the highly conserved histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and
H4. Archaeal histones have been found in many euryarchaeal organisms and Cenarchaeum [18] and have recently
also been described in T. pendens and Korarcheum [19,20]. In
order to revisit this question in the light of new sequence
data, we built a profile-hidden Markov model for archaeal
histones. In addition to T. pendens (ABL77757.1), and Candidatus K.cryptofilum (ACB06807.1 and ACB07883.1), we
were able to also identify a histone homologue in Caldivirga
maquilingensis (ABW02527.1) (Figure 1A; Additional file 1,
Figure S2). Thus, only some of the archaeal genomes in
which we identified an Elf1 orthologue also code for histones. It is therefore likely that the function of archaeal Elf1
is independent of histone-containing chromatin.
Other, non-histone chromatin proteins have also been
identified in Archaea. Alba is found in Crenarchaeota and a
subset of Euryarchaeota [18], while Sul7d is restricted to
Sulfolobus [21]. In eukaryotes, the transcription of a temPage 2 of 5

plate is affected by its chromatin state, which can be regulated by post-translational modifications of terminal tails
that protrude from the histone core. In Archaea, chromatin
can also impair transcription, as nucleosomes slow RNAP
down in vitro [22]. Archaeal histones lack protruding tail
sequences [18], but Alba can be post-translationally
acetylated at a lysine residue. Deacetylation of Alba by the
conserved deacetylase Sir2 increases the DNA-binding
affinity of Alba and impairs transcription in vitro [23].
Thus, it appears that Archaea have the ability to regulate
transcription at the chromatin level in a similar way to
eukaryotes. Our identification of an Elf1 orthologue in
Archaea indicates that these mechanisms might be even
more similar than previously thought, despite major differences in the composition of the chromatin template. It thus
seems possible that a common ancestor of eukaryotes and
Archaea already employed chromatin structure-modulating factors to regulate transcription. It will be very exciting
in the future to learn about a role of archaeal Elf1 in transcription and how its function can be applied to non-histone chromatin templates.

for Elf1-like proteins provided by Pfam. However, because
Pfam families are built with a slightly different aim from
that of the paper, we chose to iteratively build a bespoke
HMM, because this enabled us to define a species set and
gathering threshold which would be both sensitive and
selective for this specific task.
Attached (Additional file 1, Figure S1) is a comparison of
the results of searches using our HMM with those performed with the Elf1 HMM provided by Pfam
(PF05129.5). These data demonstrate that, while both
models identify the true Elf1 homologues in the organisms searched (labelled in red), our HMM provides a
greater ability to distinguish between positives (red) and
negatives (black).

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1
Dr. Chris Ponting, University of Oxford, UK
Reviewer's comments
This manuscript describes a thorough analysis and a compelling argument for the existence of archaeal Elf1 orthologues. Whilst these findings are relatively straightforward
to derive using standard database search tools, including
PSI-BLAST and the authors' method of choice HMMer, the
manuscript provides a detailed case for the evolutionary
and functional importance of these findings. One addition that I would recommend is for the authors to
acknowledge that Pfam has already collated many or all of
these
orthology
relationships
(see
http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF05129) and differences
from this Pfam family need to be stated explicitly.
Author's response
We probably didn't make the relationship between the
Pfam Elf1 model and our HMM sufficiently clear in the
manuscript. As mentioned, there already exists an HMM

Reviewer's comments
This is a straightforward but quite valuable paper that
extends the homologous relationship between the
archaeal and eukaryotic transcription machineries to
include the crenarcaheal orthologs of the eukaryotic chromatin remodeling factor Elf1. The results are valid and
complete (see comments below for some possible extensions), and also rather unexpected because Elf1 is thought
to function in the maintenance of eukaryote-specific chromatin structure. This paper shows that there might be
even more functional similarity between the process of
transcription in eukaryotes and some archaea (in particular, Crenarchaeota) than currently thought.
