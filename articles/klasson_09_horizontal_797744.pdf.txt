Abstract
Background: The evolutionary importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Wolbachia
endosymbiotic bacteria to their eukaryotic hosts is a topic of considerable interest and debate.
Recent transfers of genome fragments from Wolbachia into insect chromosomes have been
reported, but it has been argued that these fragments may be on an evolutionary trajectory to
degradation and loss.
Results: We have discovered a case of HGT, involving two adjacent genes, between the genomes
of Wolbachia and the currently Wolbachia-uninfected mosquito Aedes aegypti, an important human
disease vector. The lower level of sequence identity between Wolbachia and insect, the
transcription of all the genes involved, and the fact that we have identified homologs of the two
genes in another Aedes species (Ae. mascarensis), suggest that these genes are being expressed after
an extended evolutionary period since horizontal transfer, and therefore that the transfer has
functional significance. The association of these genes with Wolbachia prophage regions also
provides a mechanism for the transfer.
Conclusion: The data support the argument that HGT between Wolbachia endosymbiotic
bacteria and their hosts has produced evolutionary innovation.

Background
Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular inherited bacterium
found in arthropods, where it manipulates host reproduction using phenotypes such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), male killing, parthenogenesis and feminization,
and can spread rapidly through insect populations [1]. It
is also an obligate mutualist of a number of filarial nematode species [2].
Several cases where sections of the Wolbachia genome,
sometimes large, have been transferred to the host chro-

mosomes are now known in both insects and nematodes
[3-5]. These are either recent events where Wolbachia and
host sequences are highly similar or involve extensive
pseudogenization [4]. Transcription was reported for 2%
of the genes transferred to Drosophila ananassae but the
levels were estimated to be 104 to 107 fold lower than for
a control gene, act5C [5,6], and it has been argued that
this could represent background transcriptional noise (as
occurs for many pseudogenes) rather than functional
expression [7,8] – translation has yet to be demonstrated.
It has therefore been suggested that these fragments are on

an evolutionary trajectory to degradation by neutral mutation and play no significant part in host evolution [8]. If
so they would be analogous to the non-functional nuclear
fragments of mitochondrial DNA present in some animal
genomes [9], which are transient and in the process of
decay.
The case has therefore been made that if Wolbachia-insect
HGT has evolutionary significance, both longevity and
integration into host biology would need to be demonstrated [8]; and furthermore that we would expect to see
Wolbachia-like genes in species that do not currently harbour Wolbachia but presumably did in the past. Both phylogenetic analyses and theory suggest that Wolbachia can
be lost over time from host species by a variety of mechanisms [10-12]. Aedes aegypti, the most important mosquito vector of human dengue fever and various other
arboviruses, is naturally Wolbachia-uninfected but has
been shown to be able to support Wolbachia following
artificial transinfection – with both high rates of maternal
inheritance and the expression of high levels of CI [13].
The examination of its sequenced genome [14] for any
genes that could have originated in Wolbachia was therefore undertaken.

Results and discussion
We have discovered a case of HGT involving adjacent
genes in the genomes of Ae. aegypti and two Wolbachia
strains. The Ae. aegypti gene AAEL004181 shares around
50% amino acid identity with two genes in the genome of
Wolbachia strain wPip [15] from the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, WP1348 and WP1346), which were probably
originally a single gene split by insertion of IS element
WP1347, and also with WD0513 in strain wMel from Drosophila melanogaster [16]. The adjacent Ae. aegypti gene
AAEL004188 shows partial similarity to wPip WP1349
and to wMel WD0514 and is inverted compared to the

Wolbachia genes. The intergenic region between
AAEL004181 and AAEL004188 is around 15 Kb (Figure
1). The level of sequence identity and the fact that adjacent sets of genes are involved provide a robust case for an
HGT event.
RT-PCR analysis was conducted and confirmed that Ae.
aegypti genes AAEL004181 and AAEL004188 were transcribed in both male and female adult mosquitoes. The
Wolbachia wPip genes WP1348 and WP1346 were clearly
amplified by RT-PCR in adult Cx. quinquefasciatus of both
sexes, indicating that they are also transcribed. Primers
AAEL004181 b, c and i were designed to span three
introns present in the Aedes aegypti Vectorbase annotation
for AAEL004181; based on product size from RT-PCR
amplification (Figure 2 and Table 1), all of these three
introns proved to be mis-annotations and it was concluded that no introns are present. The apparent absence
of introns, which would be particularly unusual for a mosquito gene of the size of AAEL004181, is suggestive of a
bacterial origin.
Full genome microarrays for Aedes aegypti were hybridized
to cDNA from adult females, as shown in Figure 3. All
probes with hybridization signal levels significantly above
background (see methods) were ranked in order of signal
intensity; 4.9% of these probes (or approximately 15% of
all probes) showed lower signal intensity than was seen
for either of the two AAEL004181 probes, while 28.2% of
probes significantly above background (42% of all
probes) showed lower signal intensity than was seen for
either of the two AAEL004188 probes. Quantitative RTPCR data for AAEL004188, AAEL004188 and he act5C
gene used as a control by Hotopp et al. [5] matched the
array results, as shown in figure 3. The act5C gene is, as the
authors note, highly and constitutively expressed and may
in fact be an overly stringent point of comparison to assess

whether horizontally transferred genes are likely to be
functional. In the microarray data a number of genes of
known function showed very similar or lower hybridization intensities relative to the two genes of interest; for
example the probes for AAEL012836 (Cytochrome B561)
and AAEL002230 (encoding a chromatin helicase DNA
binding protein) showed very similar hybridization intensities as AAEL004181, while AAEL013002 (Cdk9) and
AAEL010226 (Daughterless) showed very similar hybridization levels as AAEL004188. Based on these data it is
considered likely that both AAEL004181 and
AAEL004188 are expressed, functional genes, although
obviously definitive proof of this will require the raising
of antibodies followed by protein studies.
Close homologs of the two Ae. aegypti genes could not be
found in other sequenced mosquito/insect genomes such
as Anopheles gambiae [17]. Various PCR primer pairs
designed for the Aedes aegypti genes AAEL004181 and
AAEL004188 failed to amplify PCR products from several
other fellow subgenus Stegomyia members, but did
amplify products for both genes from Ae. mascarensis
(Table 2). This species, from Mauritius, is able to produce
sterile offspring in laboratory crosses with Ae. aegypti [18].
Ae. mascarensis PCR products from AAEL004181 primers
b & f plus g & h (see Figure 2 and Table 1), located in
diverse regions of the gene, were sequenced and shared a
mean 97% nucleotide identity over 1278 base pairs with
Ae. aegypti AAEL004181. Diverged homologs of the two
genes may well be present in other more distant Aedes species, but could not be detected here. Thus, if the direction
of the HGT was from Wolbachia to host it would have
occurred at least prior to the species divergence of Ae.
aegypti and Ae. mascarensis and indeed the accumulation
of the 15 Kb of non-coding DNA between the two genes
would likely have required a considerable period of time
(although it is not possible to make any precise time estimates from the data available).
The wPip genes are located at the end of a genomic
prophage region, providing a putative mechanism for the

HGT. Wolbachia have been shown to contain phage particles by EM in several studies; WO prophage have been
shown to be highly variable and rapidly evolving regions
in the genomes of mosquito Wolbachia, and non-congruent with host phylogeny [19-24], strongly suggesting that
lateral transfer of phage between Wolbachia strains has
occurred. The two wMel genes WD0512 and WD0513 are
part of an operon that also contains the ankyrin repeat
domain (ANK) encoding gene WD0514. This operon is
present in mod+ strain variants of wMel (able to induce CI
in males) but not in the related mod- strain wAu (unable
to induce CI) [25]. The operon is located in a region of the
wMel genome that was shown to be missing in wAu,
WD0506-WD0518 in wMel, and in fact all these genes
have homologs in the prophage regions of the wPip
genome, except for the ANK gene WD0514. Therefore,
although not annotated as prophage [16], these genes in
wMel are likely to be remnants of an old prophage region,
the rest of which has been deleted or rearranged.
The Ae. aegypti gene AAEL004181 also shares considerably
lower amino acid similarity with a group of genes in the
Ae. aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens genomes.
One of these Ae. aegypti genes showed female salivary
gland specific expression and was named aaSGS1 (SGS =
Salivary Gland Specific). This gene and homologs in
Anopheles are candidate Plasmodium sporozoite receptors
[26,27]. It has already been suggested that the SGS-type
mosquito genes might have arisen from an ancient transfer between Wolbachia and mosquitoes, but with weak
support [26,27].
An alternative hypothesis is that the direction of horizontal transfer was in fact from Aedes into Wolbachia, and
AAEL004181 is part of a family of SGS-type genes that
originated and evolved in mosquitoes. The acquisition of
host genes by Wolbachia has not previously been documented. It could be argued that this scenario is more parsimonious since only one inter-domain HGT event would
be required, if a subsequent transfer from wPip (or a
related strain) to wMel is assumed. In contrast, the

hypothesis of Wolbachia to Aedes transfer requires a different origin of the SGS genes compared to AAEL004181.
However, phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 4) does not
support the hypothesis of a single host-to-Wolbachia HGT,
since AAEL004181 clusters with the wPip gene WP1346

with a posterior probability of 1 and a boostrap value of
89. If AAEL004181 had been transferred from mosquito
to Wolbachia followed by subsequent transfer between
Wolbachia strains, the wPip and wMel sequences would be
expected to be more closely related to each other than to

tree, which is not the case. Thus, both phylogenetic evidence and the lack of introns support a Wolbachia-to-host
direction of transfer of AAEL004181. The SGS genes may
also have had a bacterial origin, as suggested by their
apparent lack of introns, but if this is the case then the

The data presented provide a robust case for HGT between
Wolbachia and mosquitoes, and we consider Wolbachia-tohost to be the most likely direction of this transfer of the
genes AAEL004181/8 in Ae. aegypti and mascarensis. Our
results support the argument that HGT between Wolbachia
and their insect hosts has led to the acquisition of evolutionary innovation, provide a putative mechanism for
transfer via nuclear-phage recombination, and suggest
that the previously documented examples of recent/ongoing Wolbachia-host HGT may have considerably more significance than interesting, but transient, phenomena.

Methods
Mosquito DNA and RNA extraction, PCR, sequencing,
and RT-PCR using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit were carried out as previously described [22,28]. DNA from
Museum specimens was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp
DNA micro kit according to the manufacturers instructions. Primers were designed using Primer3 [29] and previously published primers for gene wsp (81F and
691R)[30] were used to check for presence of Wolbachia,
and AegS7F and R primers amplifying the ribosomal S7
gene [31] as controls for Aedes DNA quality. DNA from
Aedes simpsoni, heischi, soleatus, calceatus, metallicus and
mascarensis (all considered phylogenetically close to Ae.
aegypti) was extracted from preserved Museum specimens;
only data from specimens where strong AegS7 amplification was observed were included. DNA from Ae. aegypti
and Ae. albopictus was extracted from laboratory specimens.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Gene expression levels were monitored using quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol™
reagent from groups of ten Aedes aegypti females and
cDNA was synthesized from 1 microgram of total RNA
using SuperScript II enzyme (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer's protocol. qRT-PCR was performed on a 1
in 20 dilution of the cDNAs using dsDNA dye SYBR Green
I. Reactions were run on a DNA Engine thermocycler (MJ
Research) with Chromo4 real-time PCR detection system
(Bio-Rad) using the following cycling conditions: 95C for
15 minutes, then 45 cycles of 95C for 10s, 59C for 10s,
72C for 20s, with fluorescence acquisition at the end of
each cycle, then a melting curve analysis after the final
one. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined and
background fluorescence was subtracted. Gene expression
levels of target genes were calculated, relative to the internal reference gene RpS17 (ribosomal protein S17). Primer
pairs used to detect target gene transcripts were as follows:

Microarray experiments
Custom Ae. aegypti microarrays were designed using Agilent eArray software [32]. A probe set, containing two
unique 60-mers per annotated Ae. aegypti gene, was
designed using the gene expression probe design module.
These probes were randomly position across the surface of
the array.

Aedes aegypti were reared using standard procedures to
either 0–2 days (young) or 14–16 days (old) posteclosion before collection. Total RNA was extracted from
pools of 10 female Ae. aegypti using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated total RNA was quantified on the Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer. The two-colour low RNA input
linear amplification kit PLUS kit (Agilent Technologies)
was used to amplify cyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5)
labeled complimentary RNA (cRNA) from 1.5 μg of total
RNA from each pool of female mosquitoes. cRNA samples
were purified using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen), then
cRNA concentration and dye incorporation (labeling efficiency) where quantified using the Nanodrop. Prepared
cRNA samples were hybridized to four 4 × 44K format
microarrays using Agilent reagents and protocols. Microarray slides were washed following Agilent protocols to
prevent ozone degradation and scanned with an Agilent
scanner at 5 μm scan resolution using the extended
dynamic range (XDR) function (XDR Hi 100%, XDR Lo
10%). Agilent feature extraction software (version 9.5.3)
was run on all array datasets using the GE2-v5_95_Feb07
protocol. This protocol reports processed Cy3 and Cy5

signal intensities and identifies probes significantly
expressed above background (2-sided t-test; P = 0.01).
Phylogenetic analysis
The two genes WP1346 and WP1348 in Wolbachia strain
wPip and the two genes WD0512 and WD0513 from Wolbachia strain wMel were concatenated. The gene
AAEL004181 from Aedes aegypti was extended to the new
start codon and the parts annotated as introns were
included. All genes identified as putative SGS family
members by searching the genomes of Anopheles gambiae,
Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus with tblastn in
VectorBase [33] were extracted. All gene sequences were, if
necessary, extended to the putatively correct start codon
based on homology with AAEL004181 and introns were
included and translated together with the exon sequences.
The gene annotated as CPIJ007816 contained two large
open reading frames that were both similar to the SGS
genes, they were both included and are called
CPIJ007816a and b. Two SGS genes from Anopheles gambiae, agSGS2 and agSGS3 sequenced by Korochkina et al.
[27], were retrieved separately from Genbank, since the
corresponding region in the Anopheles gambiae genome
contains sequence gaps. The amino acid sequences were
aligned using MUSCLE [34]. Phylogenetic reconstruction
was performed using MrBayes 3.12 [35], with the mixed
amino acid model. The program was run for 200,000 generations, sampling every 100th generation, using 2 runs
with 4 chains in each. A consensus tree was constructed
using a burnin of 25% of the sampled trees. A maximum
likelihood analysis was conducted using RAxML ver. 7.0.4
[36]. A rapid boostrap analysis using 1000 replicates with
a following search for the best scoring ML tree was conducted in two separate runs using the WAGF+GAMMA+I
model. For each run, the final ML optimization was conducted for every 5th bootstrapped tree to search for the
best scoring ML tree.

Phylogenetic tree of the SGS genes, AAEL004181 in Ae. aegypti and homologous sequences in Wolbachia. The
fragments of the AAEL004181 homolog sequenced from Ae. mascarensis are highly similar to AAEL004181, and are not shown
here. Boostrap values from the ML analysis of 1000 replicates are shown above the branches and posterior probabilities from
the Bayesian analysis are shown beneath the branches.
