Abstract
Background: In the global eradication program for poliomyelitis, the laboratory diagnosis plays a critical
role by isolating poliovirus (PV) from the stool samples of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. In this study,
we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system for a
rapid and highly sensitive detection of enterovirus including PV to identify stool samples positive for
enterovirus including PV.
Methods: A primer set was designed for RT-LAMP to detect enterovirus preferably those with PV-like
5'NTRs of the viral genome. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP system was evaluated with prototype strains of
enterovirus. Detection of enterovirus from stool extracts was examined by using RT-LAMP system.
Results: We detected at least 400 copies of the viral genomes of PV(Sabin) strains within 90 min by RTLAMP with the primer set. This RT-LAMP system showed a preference for Human enterovirus species C
(HEV-C) strains including PV, but exhibited less sensitivity to the prototype strains of HEV-A and HEV-B
(detection limits of 7,400 to 28,000 copies). Stool extracts, from which PV, HEV-C, or HEV-A was isolated
in the cell culture system, were mostly positive by RT-LAMP method (positive rates of 15/16 (= 94%), 13/
14 (= 93%), and 4/4 (= 100%), respectively). The positive rate of this RT-LAMP system for stool extracts
from which HEV-B was isolated was lower than that of HEV-C (positive rate of 11/21 (= 52%)). In the stool
samples, which were negative for enterovirus isolation by the cell culture system, we found that two
samples were positive for RT-LAMP (positive rates of 2/38 (= 5.3%)). In these samples, enterovirus 96 was
identified by sequence analysis utilizing a seminested PCR system.
Conclusions: RT-LAMP system developed in this study showed a high sensitivity comparable to that of
the cell culture system for the detection of PV, HEV-A, and HEV-C, but less sensitivity to HEV-B. This RTLAMP system would be useful for the direct detection of enterovirus from the stool extracts.

Background
In the global eradication program for poliomyelitis, the
laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role by isolating
poliovirus (PV) from the stool samples of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) cases. The isolation procedure of PV have
been established based on the cell culture system using a
human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD cells) and a
mouse L cell line expressing PV receptor (L20B cells) [1,2].
The advantages of cell culture-based procedure are; 1)
apparatuses for molecular diagnosis are not required, and
2) a high sensitivity (detection limit of 1 infectious dose
that contains 50 to 1,000 virions in picornavirus infection) [3]. The disadvantage is that some expertise and
quality control system are required for the cell culture system and for the identification of the cytopathic effect of
infected cells. As for the timeliness of reporting, the cell
culture-based procedure is time-consuming. It takes for 10
days to confirm the sample as PV-negative even after the
introduction of the latest procedure "New Algorism" recommended by WHO [2]. Currently, detection of the circulating vaccine-derived PV (cVDPV) has a high priority in
the eradication program and will be in the post-eradication era. Therefore, rapid (at the order of day) and sensitive detection of PV in laboratory diagnosis could
contribute to shortening of the timeliness of reporting for
mop-up vaccine campaign to control cVDPV outbreaks.
Among currently available procedures detecting RNA
viruses, a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) system seems to be a most
promising method that meet the demands expected for
the cell culture-based isolation procedure [4]. The advantages of RT-LAMP system are; 1) minimum essential
equipment is an isothermal heat bath (final results can be
visibly observed by the increased turbidity)[5], 2) high
sensitivity (detection limits of 0.01 PFU for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 0.1 PFU for mumps
virus, 0.4 focus forming units for hepatitis A virus, 50 copies of viral genomes for swine vesicular disease virus) [69], 3) rapid detection (about 1 h), 4) less possibility of
cross-contamination between the samples due to the onestep procedure.
In the present study, we have developed a RT-LAMP system for the detection of enterovirus, including PV. This
RT-LAMP system showed a high sensitivity comparable to
that of the cell culture system for the detection of PV, HEVA, and HEV-C, but less sensitivity to HEV-B. This RT-LAMP
system would be useful for the direct detection of enterovirus from the stool extracts.

Results
RT-LAMP primers for the detection of PV
To detect PV by RT-LAMP methods, we analyzed the
5'NTR for the design of the primers (Figure 1a). 5'NTR is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/208

known to be classified into two phylogenetic groups
based on the primary structure, PV-like or CBV-like 5'NTR
[10,11]. PV-like 5'NTR is observed for enteroviruses
belonging to Human enterovirus species C (HEV-C) and
HEV-D, and CBV-like 5'NTR is observed for those belonging to HEV-A and HEV-B, respectively [11]. Therefore, we
designed the primer sets to detect PV-like 5'NTR according
to conditions required for the primer in RT-LAMP reaction
in terms of the location and Tm values of the primers
(Figure
http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/lamp/primer.html
1b). Among the 5 primers used in the RT-LAMP reaction,
2 primers were preferable (a complete match for PV-like
5'NTR near the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in
RT-LAMP reaction, FIP primer) or specific (a complete
match for PV-like 5'NTR at the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, BIP primer) to PVlike 5'NTR (Figure 2). Other 3 primers (F, B, Loop B primers) were designed with conserved sequences between PVlike and CBV-like 5'NTRs.
Sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for the detection of PV
First, the sensitivity of RT-LAMP reaction was examined by
using purified viral RNA of PV(Sabin) strains (Figure 3a).
In the RT-LAMP reaction, 400 copies of viral genome were
detected for all the PV(Sabin) strains (4/4), and 40 copies
of viral genome were detected in some samples (1/4 to 3/
4). Signals of RT-LAMP were detected within 50 min of
the reaction for samples with 400 copies of viral genomes
(Figure 3b). For samples with 40 copies of viral genomes,
the signals were detected as late as 50 to 73 min.

Next, we examined the sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for
enterovirus species by using cell culture supernatant of the
virus without viral RNA extraction (Figure 3c). Cell culture
supernatant of cells infected with PV(Sabin) strains were
RT-LAMP positive at dilution of 1:10,000,000, which contains at least 0.73 to 2.4 CCID50 of viruses (about 100 copies of the viral genomes). Echovirus 11 (belonging to
HEV-B) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) strains (belonging to
HEV-A) showed lower sensitivity in the RT-LAMP reaction
compared to PV(Sabin) strains. The detection limit of
echovirus 11 and EV71 strains were 17 CCID50 (28,000
copies of the viral genome) and 7.8 to 53 CCID50 (7,400
to 13,000 copies of the viral genome), respectively.
Finally, we examined to detect PV from the stool samples
of AFP cases (Figure 3d). Stool samples that were positive
for PV (16 samples), HEV-A (4 samples), -B (21 samples),
and -C (14 samples), or negative for enterovirus (38 samples) by cell culture-based isolation were examined. PV
and HEV-C were detected with high positive rates in the
stool samples by RT-LAMP (94 and 93%, respectively).
Unexpectedly, HEV-A was also detected with a high positive rate (100%), and HEV-B was also detected with a relatively high positive rate (52%). For stool samples

negative for enterovirus, 2 samples (derived from one AFP
case) were positive by RT-LAMP. For these samples, enterovirus 96 was identified by sequence analysis of VP1 coding region utilizing a seminested PCR [12] (data not
shown). Therefore, this RT-LAMP system showed a good
correlation with the cell culture-based isolation especially
for PV, HEV-C, and HEV-A.
We analyzed the sequence of HEV-B isolates (CAM2515
and CAM2549) that were positive for RT-LAMP, and for a
HEV-C (CAM2730) and a PV2 (CAM2553) strains that
were negative for RT-LAMP (Figure 4). The 5'NTR of these
HEV-B isolates showed mixed genetic properties of PVlike 5'NTR and CBV-like 5'NTR. The 5'NTR of CAM2515
showed CBV-like sequence in the FIP primer-binding
region, but has a PV-like sequence in the region for BIP
primer. The 5'NTR of another HEV-B isolate CAM2549
and a HEV-C isolate CAM2730 showed similar sequence
to PV-like 5'NTR in these regions. The sequence of the
5'NTR of PV2 isolate CAM2553 was similar to its parental
PV2(Sabin).

Discussion
In this study, we have developed a RT-LAMP system for a
rapid and highly sensitive detection of enterovirus including PV directly from stool samples of AFP cases without
cell culture-based procedures. 5'NTR of enteroviruses is
classified into two groups based on its primary structure,
PV-like or CBV-like 5'NTR [10,11]. Actually, a RFLP assay
utilizing BstOI have been developed to differentiate these
genogroups [13]. We designed RT-LAMP primers preferably to detect PV-like 5'NTR rather than PV-specific primers, because we could not find nucleotide sequences
specific to PV strains but not to other HEV-C strains in the
5'NTR. Actually, cVDPVs with unknown nucleotide
sequences in the 5'NTR, which was probably derived from
the viral genome of other non-polio enterovirus, were isolated [14].
In the primers examined in this study, the specificity to
PV-like 5'NTR was defined by 2 primers (FIP and BIP
primers, Figure 2). The sequences of primers we used
might detect most of the cVDPVs or immunodeficient

VDPVs, which were circulating or infecting for about 2 to
10 years [14-16] (Figure 5). However, one cVDPV strain
(EGY88-074), which was isolated in an early stage of the
circulation in Egypt with its 5'NTR that was probably
derived from other enterovirus genomes by recombination [14], contained a different nucleotide at the 3' end of
F primer. This nucleotide change was not observed for
another cVDPV strain (EGY93-034), which was isolated in
the late stage of the circulation, suggesting that this nucleotide change was not stable during the circulation. Therefore, some cVDPV isolates with this rare mutation might
not be detected with the primer set examined in this
study.
We observed the specificity to PV-like 5'NTR to some
extent compared to CBV-like 5'NTR in the RT-LAMP reaction, where about 100-fold difference was observed in the
sensitivity (Figure 3c). However, detection of enteroviruses from stool samples showed only slightly lower positive rates for HEV-A and HEV-B (100 and 52%,
respectively) compared to those for PV and other HEV-C
(94 and 93%, respectively) (Figure 3d). The relatively low
positive rates of HEV-B among these virus species might
depend on the designed specificity of RT-LAMP to PV-like
5'NTR. Sequence analysis of 5'NTR of HEV-B isolates indicated that these field isolates could have some genetic features similar to PV-like 5'NTR (Figure 4). Therefore, with
relatively low specificity of RT-LAMP system (100-fold difference between PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTR), the mixed
genetic features of the 5'NTR of HEV-B field isolates might
have affected the specificity of the RT-LAMP system.
An essential factor of the sensitivity of RT-LAMP system
for the detection of PV from stool extracts seems to be the
amount of viral RNA available for the reaction in addition
to the quality of the RNA. We found one stool sample
(CAM2553) was negative by the RT-LAMP among the 16
stool extract that was positive for PV by cell culture (Figure
3d). The 5' NTR of the PV2(CAM2553) did not have any
nucleotide changes from that of its parental PV2(Sabin)
strain (Figure 4). It is plausible that the low amount of
viral RNA in the sample caused this false-negative result
under the detection limit of RT-LAMP. The amounts of PV
in the stool extracts were not generally high (< 100.5 to
102.5 CCID50/50 Î¼l, Table 1). In the RT-LAMP reaction
examined in this study, we purified viral RNA from 200 Î¼l
of stool extract and collected in 50 Î¼l of elusion buffer (4fold concentration by this procedure), and then 2.5 Î¼l of
this purified viral RNA solution was used for RT-LAMP
reaction. Therefore, the net amount of viral RNA used in
RT-LAMP reaction corresponds to that contained in 10 Î¼l
of stool extract. For the isolation of PV, 200 Î¼l of stool
extract is inoculated into the cells. Therefore, there is 20fold difference in the available viral RNA or the infectious
units between the RT-LAMP system and the cell culture
system because of the intrinsic difference of the scale of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/208

the assay (12.5 Î¼l vs. 1.0 ml). Because of a high particleto-infective-unit ratio of PV, which was estimated as 56 to
153 copies of viral genome per CCID50 in this study (Figure 3c), relatively high sensitivity was attained in RTLAMP system almost comparable to that of cell culturebased isolation. It should be noted that the sensitivity of
this RT-LAMP system (< 400 copies) was not high compared to those of optimized RT-LAMP systems (1-100
copies), and was lower than that of a conventional realtime PCR system [17] (< 10 copies). Additional procedures to increase the concentration of viral RNA and to
improve the quality of RNA would be helpful to improve
the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP system for the detection of
PV from stool extracts.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a highly sensitive RT-LAMP
system for the detection of enterovirus, including PV,
from the stool extracts. The cell culture-based isolation
will be needed for genetic characterization of PV isolates,
particularly differentiation of wild, VDPV, and mixtures of
PV and enterovirus. The RT-LAMP system would be useful
for a triage of overwhelming number of clinical samples
to reduce the workload and to minimize the timeliness of
the report by identifying the samples negative for PV
within a day.

Methods
Cells, viruses, and clinical samples
RD cells (human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) and used for titration of viruses. Virus titre
was determined by measuring 50% cell culture infectious
dose (CCID50) at 35Â°C by a microtitration assay [18].
Stool extracts from AFP cases were used for isolation of
enterovirus and for RT-LAMP reaction. The species and
serotypes of enterovirus isolates were determined by
sequencing of the viral genome with a primer set for 2BC
coding region (2A2+ and 2C-primers) [19] and with those
for VP1 coding region (292 and 222 primers) [20]. All the
clinical samples and virus isolates used in this study are
appropriately anonymized. Therefore, they are exempt
from the regulation under the Committee for Ethical Regulation of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.
RNA purification
Viral genomic RNA was purified from the stool extracts of
AFP cases by using a High Pure viral RNA purification kit
(Roche). In this purification procedure, viral genomic
RNA was collected in 50 Î¼l of distilled water purified from
200 Î¼l of stool extracts.

Primers used in this study are shown in Figure 1 (Figure

in concentrations as follows; 40 Î¼M for FIP and BIP primers, 5 Î¼M for F and B primers, and 20 Î¼M for Loop B primers. RT-LAMP reaction was performed by using a RNA
Amplification Kit (RT-LAMP) (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan). RT-LAMP reaction was prepared according
to the manufacturer's instruction but in a total 12.5 Î¼l
reaction. The final concentrations of the primers were as
follows; 1.6 Î¼M for FIP and BIP primers, 0.2 Î¼M for F and
B primers, and 0.8 Î¼M for Loop B primers. In the total
12.5 Î¼l reaction, 2.5 Î¼l of purified viral RNA solution or
diluted cell culture supernatant were included (Figure 1c).
RT-LAMP reaction was performed at 60Â°C for 90 min and
optical density at 650 nm was measured as the turbidity
by a Loopamp Realtime Turbidimeter LA-320C (Teramecs, Kyoto, Japan). The threshold of the turbidity for
RT-LAMP positive sample was defined at 0.1 in the measurement [5]. The numbers of copies of the viral RNA of PV
Sabin strains and prototype enterovirus strains were determined by real-time TaqMan PCR system developed by
Nijhuis et al. [17], as described previously [21].
