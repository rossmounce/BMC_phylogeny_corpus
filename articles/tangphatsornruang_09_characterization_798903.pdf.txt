Abstract
Background: Mungbean is an important economical crop in Asia. However, genomic research has lagged
behind other crop species due to the lack of polymorphic DNA markers found in this crop. The objective
of this work is to develop and characterize microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from
genome shotgun sequencing of mungbean.
Result: We have generated and characterized a total of 470,024 genome shotgun sequences covering
100.5 Mb of the mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) genome using 454 sequencing technology. We
identified 1,493 SSR motifs that could be used as potential molecular markers. Among 192 tested primer
pairs in 17 mungbean accessions, 60 loci revealed polymorphism with polymorphic information content
(PIC) values ranging from 0.0555 to 0.6907 with an average of 0.2594. Majority of microsatellite markers
were transferable in Vigna species, whereas transferability rates were only 22.90% and 24.43% in Phaseolus
vulgaris and Glycine max, respectively. We also used 16 SSR loci to evaluate phylogenetic relationship of 35
genotypes of the Asian Vigna group. The genome survey sequences were further analyzed to search for
gene content. The evidence suggested 1,542 gene fragments have been sequence tagged, that fell within
intersected existing gene models and shared sequence homology with other proteins in the database.
Furthermore, potential microRNAs that could regulate developmental stages and environmental
responses were discovered from this dataset.
Conclusion: In this report, we provided evidence of generating remarkable levels of diverse
microsatellite markers and gene content from high throughput genome shotgun sequencing of the
mungbean genomic DNA. The markers could be used in germplasm analysis, accessing genetic diversity
and linkage mapping of mungbean.

Background
Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) is an important
food leguminous crop in Asia, with an annual production
of around 3.5 - 4.0 million tons [1]. The crop is grown
principally for its protein-rich dry seeds (24% protein)
which is a major protein source for people in Asian countries as part of a nutritionally balance diet [2]. It is popularly grown as a component in various cropping systems
because of its ability to fix nitrogen in association with
soil bacteria, early maturity (ca. 60 days) and relatively
drought tolerance. Mungbean belongs to the genus Vigna,
in which several species such as azuki bean (Vigna angularis (Wild.) Ohwi & Ohashi), bambara groundnut (Vigna
subterranea (L.) Verdc.), blackgram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), moth bean
(V. aconitifolia (Jacq.) Maréchal) and rice bean (Vigna
umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi & Ohashi), are domesticated
and utilized in a similar way to mungbean.
Mungbean is a self-pollinated diploid plant with 2n = 2x
= 22 chromosomes and a genome size of 515 Mb/1C [3].
Genomic study in this crop is far behind other legume
crops. Mungbean was among the primary crops that
genetic linkage maps have been developed. However, the
current linkage maps, based on RFLP and RAPD markers
of mungbean, do not resolve 11 linkage groups [4]. Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are markers
of choice for crop improvement of many species because
they are reliable and easy to score [5]. SSRs are clusters of
short tandem repeated nucleotide bases distributed
throughout the genome. SSR markers are co-dominant,
multi-allelic and requiring small amount of DNA for scoring. The traditional method of SSR marker development
involves construction of SSR-enriched library, cloning,
and sequencing, which is costly and labor intensive. Nevertheless, significant efforts have been invested in development of SSR markers in recent years, but so far only 35
polymorphic SSR markers published for mungbean [610]. In a study by Somta et. al. (2008), more than 200
primer pairs amplifying SSRs were tested for polymorphism among 17 mungbean accessions, only 12 (5.7%)
primer pairs were polymorphic. The authors suggested
that the use of SSR markers has been limited due to the
lack of polymorphism in this species [7].
Over the past few years, the introduction of a massivelyparallel pyrosequencing technology developed by 454
Life Sciences Technology has opened new possibilities for
high-throughput genome analysis [11]. This new technology has been applied to the sequencing of microbial
genomes, genotyping, genome resequencing, transcriptome profiling and methylation studies. Although,
sequences generated by this technique are relatively short,
there are evidences suggesting that this technique can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/137

used to sequence plant genomes that are complex and
large [12-14]. Wicker et al. (2006) suggested that 454
sequencing technology could reveal almost complete
assembly of the entire gene sequences in 4 barley BAC
clones at only 9-folds coverage and concluded that the
method is a rapid and cost effective way of sequencing the
gene-containing portions of the genome. Low coverage
shotgun sequencing using 454 sequencing technology has
also been used to study functional genomics in soybean
[12], repetitive DNA in the pea genome [14] and transcriptome from a normalized cDNA library of Medicago
truncatula [15]. Here, we report genome shotgun sequencing of the mungbean genomic DNA using 454 Life Sciences sequencing technology for isolation of SSR markers
and characterization of gene content.

Results and Discussion
Shotgun sequencing of Vigna radiata genome
Sequencing of Vigna radiata genomic DNA was carried out
using 454 Life Sciences technology on the Genome
Sequencer (GS) FLX System. A total of 470,024 quality filtered sequence reads was generated with the average read
length of 216 bases covering 100.5 Mb. All reads were
deposited in NCBI Short Read Archive (ID = SRA003681)
http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Traces/. Assembly of the
obtained nucleotide sequence reads was performed using
the Newbler, de novo sequence assembly software [11].
Redundant reads were reduced to 46,646 contigs with the
average contig length of 297 bases covering 13.85 Mb. The
contig sequence data were reported in the DDBJ/EMBL/
GenBank nucleotide sequence databases with the accession number BABL01000001-BABL01046645. The contig
length ranges from 89 bases to 44,462 bases. The average
GC content of mungbean genomic DNA generated in this
study is 34.69% which is consistent with the reports on
GC contents in other plant genomes such as Arapbidopsis
(36% [16]), grape (34.6% [17]), poplar (33.7% [18]),
tomato (36.2% [19]) and potato (35.6% [19]). It is
slightly higher than the mean of GC content for intergenic
regions in the Arabidopsis genome (32.9%, Genome Indices 8/04: http://http//gi.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp) [20]; but it is
much lower than the average GC content of Arabidopsis
coding sequences (44.5%) [21].
Characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers in
Vigna radiata
We isolated 1,493 microsatellite regions using the Troll
software. There were 889 dinucleotide repeats (DNPs),
282 trinucleotide repeats (TNPs), 123 tetranucleotide
repeats (TTNPs), 124 pentanucleotide repeats (PNPs) and
75 SSRs with hexanucleotide repeats or more. The distribution of the number of motif repeat ranged from 4 - 30
repeats (Table 1). The most common motif type of DNPs
was TA/AT (89.3% of DNPs) followed by TC/AG (7.1% of

DNPs) and AC/TG (3.6% of DNPs). The GC/CG motif
was not found in the data set. TNPs were found at 282 SSR
loci (18.9%), which was three times lower than that of
DNPs. The TAA repeat was the most common motif type
found at 184 loci (65.24% of TNPs). The least frequent
TNP motif was GC-rich (GCG/CGC) found at only 2 loci.
The genomic SSRs with GC-rich motif repeats are rare in
most plants as previously reported in rice, corn, soybean
[22], wheat [23], Arabidopsis thaliana, apricot, peach [24],
coffee [25] and rubber tree [26]. In contrast, the GC-rich
motifs have been reported as frequent motifs in studies on
development of SSR from expressed sequence tags and
genomes with methylation filtration [27-30]. Thus, GCrich SSR are most likely to be derived from the coding
region of the genome. The frequency of identified SSR in
mungbean was one SSR in every 67 kb (1,493 SSRs in
100.5 Mb) which is significantly lower than the SSR frequency in soybean (1/7.4 kb) [31]. Among plant species,
the SSR frequencies range from 1/1.5 kb in coffee to 1/20
kb in cotton [25,31]. The observed low SSR frequency in
this study is probably because a large proportion of reads
from the low coverage sequencing (0.2x) of the mungbean genome were biased toward highly repetitive parts of
the genome.

From 1,493 identified SSRs, 192 SSRs were identified
from contigs and 1,301 SSRs were from singletons.
Among 192 contigs containing SSR motifs, majority of
contigs were assembled from 2 reads (87 contigs) followed by 3 reads (48 contigs) and 4 reads (16 contigs)
(Table 2). By applying the Lander-Waterman model [32]
to this dataset, there should be no contig assembled from
more than 9 reads provided that all sequences were generated by chance from non repetitive DNA (Table 2). Therefore, 16 out of 192 contigs that were assembled from
more than 9 reads are likely to represent repetitive
sequences of the genome. It should be noted that loci
present in multiple copies are not desirable for construction of genetic maps. Interestingly, there was a highly
repetitive contig containing SSR (contig 44495) which
was assembled from 3,174 raw reads. Sequence homology
search revealed that contig 44495 is a fragment of the
chloroplast genome. The number of chloroplast genome
of higher plants can reach hundreds of copies per cell. Due
to the deep sequencing nature of 454 technology, it is
expected to obtain a large number of reads from
sequences with multiple copies such as organellar
genomes, transposons and ribosomal DNA [12]. The
degree of sequencing over-representation in a repetitive

genome can be estimated from the difference between the
observed read coverage and the predictions from the
Lander-Waterman model (Table 2) as suggested by [12]. It
should be noted that the number of observed contigs with
assembled reads = 2 was much lower than the prediction
by the model. This was probably due to the effect of low
sequencing coverage; thus it was not included in the calculation of the number of repetitive reads. In total, there
were 241,410 reads (51%) present in multiple copies. We
estimated that 51% of shotgun reads from 0.2× genome
coverage represented repetitive DNA. This estimate is
slightly more than the result from the DNA re-association
kinetic study which estimated 46% of the total leaf DNA
as repetitive sequences [33].
To evaluate these SSR loci in further detail, we designed
192 primer pairs to amplify all SSR loci identified from
the contig data set. Among the 192 primer pairs evaluated
in 17 mungbean accessions, 179 (93.23%) primer pairs
were amplifiable and 127 (66.14%) primer pairs produced scorable bands. Of these, 58 primer pairs targeting
60 loci revealed polymorphism because 2 primer pairs,
VR257 and VR400, were able to target 2 independent loci
for each primer pair. Characteristics of all 60 loci are summarized in Additional File 1. These primer pairs were able
to detect a range of 2 to 6 alleles with a mean of 2.6833
alleles per locus. Polymorphic information content (PIC)
values ranged from 0.0555 to 0.6907 with an average of
0.2594 which is similar to the previous studies [7,34]. In
this study, there were 33 pair-wise combinations that significantly deviated from linkage disequilibrium (LD).
Genetic variation at a given locus in a population is meas-

ured by the observed heterozygosity (HO). The HO values
varied from 0 to 0.6471 with the average HO of 0.0289;
while the expected heterozygosity (HE) values ranged
from 0.0571 to 0.7356 with the average HE of 0.2908.
Tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the polymorphic loci revealed that all loci, except VR400, were
significantly deviated from HWE (P < 0.05). This is in
agreement with the previous studies in mungbean which
have shown that most if not all of the loci deviated from
HWE [6,7,34]. The low level of heterozygosity and significant deviation from HWE are probably because mungbean is a highly self-pollinated species with an estimated
outcrossing rate of only 1.1% [35].
We also tested the SSR locus in the highly repetitive contig
44495, which was a fragment on the chloroplast genome.
The VR0453 locus, located in the non-coding region near
the atpB gene in the chloroplast genome, had 2 alleles and
showed relatively low PIC value of 0.1046 (see Additional
File 1). Chloroplast microsatellites have been used in ecological and evolutionary studies, especially at the intraspecific level, because they are nonrecombinant,
uniparentally inherited and effectively haploid [36].
However, the major barrier for utilization of chloroplast
microsatellites is the low mutation rates associated with
the chloroplast genome [37] leading to low polymorphism level of markers in the chloroplast genome.
Sequence homology search of other loci against the Genbank non-redundant protein database and the TIGR plant
repeat databases [38] revealed that there were 5 loci
(VR029, VR073, VR216, VR256 and VR323) matched

Additional File 1). Note that there was no sequence
matched against known repeat sequences in the TIGR
plant repeat databases.

amplified only 1 legume species, V. aconitifolia. In most
cases, mungbean microsatellite primers were able to
amplify DNA of other Vigna species (Figure 1). The transferability rates of mungbean primers were between
45.80% (V. subterranean) and 91.60% (V. angularis).
However, the amplification rate was reduced in Phaseolus
vulgaris and Glycine max to 22.90% and 24.43%, respectively (Figure 1). Transferability rate of mungbean
genomic microsatellite markers to other Vigna species
appeared to be more or less similar to previous studies.
Somta et al. (2009) reported that amplification of genic
microsatellite markers in 19 taxa of Vigna species was
between 80% (V. aconitifolia) to 95.3% (V. reflex-pilosa)
[39]. Whereas, Chaitieng et al. (2006) reported that
amplification of azuki bean (V. angularis) microsatellite
markers in V. mungo, V. radiata, V. aconitifolia and V.
umbellata was between 68.8 to 90.2% [40]. The high
amplification rates of both mungbean and azuki bean

microsatellite markers
With the exception of azuki bean (V. angularis), SSR markers are very limited for other Vigna species. Therefore,
novel markers with high cross-species transferability rates
are desirable. Cross-species amplification of the 127 microsatellite markers was assessed in 24 taxa of legumes in
the tribe Phaseoleae including genus Vigna (African and
Asian Vigna), Phaseolus and Glycine. One hundred and
twenty five primer pairs successfully amplified DNA from
more than one legume. Five primer pairs were able to
amplify DNA of all legume taxa tested; while VR339

microsatellite markers in Vigna species indicate high
genome homology among species in this genus and are
useful for genetics and genomics studies, especially
genome mapping and comparative genomics.
Phylogenetic relationship
To determine the genetic diversity structure and relationships between 35 genotypes of 20 taxa of Asian Vigna, polymorphism scores at 16 microsatellite loci without
missing data were used (see Additional File 2). UPGMA
cluster analysis was conducted using software NTSYSpc
2.2 [41]. Results from the cluster analysis revealed that all
the genotypes of Asian Vigna could be clearly differentiated and classified into two groups; mungbean group and
azuki bean group (Figure 2). The results were in agreement with previous studies using non-coding sequences
of trnT-F [42,43]. In contrast, studies using AFLP [44],
rDNA-ITS and atpB-rbcL sequences [45] recognized three
groups within the Asian Vigna. In addition, it is worth noting that V. nepalensis, which has similar morphology [46]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/137

and close genetic relationship with V. angularis [43,45],
was found to be highly distinct in our study. V. grandiflora
previously shown to have high morphological and genetic
similarity to V. radiata [46,47] was found to have closer
genetic relationship with V. trilobata and V. stipulacea than
V. radiate in this study. Also, V. subramaniana that was
reported to be closely related to mungbean [45] appeared
to be more distant from mungbean but more closely
related to V. aridicola in our study. It should be noted that
V. subramaniana has a complex taxonomic history, controversy in the literature and classification concerning the
taxonomy of this species still remains [48]. The differences in the phylogenetic relationship of Asian Vigna may
be explained by the differences in the methods used in the
previous studies. Morphological traits [46], rDNA and
cpDNA sequences [43,45] were used in previous studies
to demonstrate phylogenetic relationship, while our study
used SSR markers for demonstration. The use of PCRbased SSR markers may possibly result in size homoplasy
of PCR products between/among species [49]. The same

allele size of an SSR locus may contain different sequence
variants; thus species sharing the same SSR allelic size
include species that are identical by descent and species
that have originated from convergent evolution.
Sequence annotation and gene ontology
The contigs were analyzed by GeneMark.hmm eukaryotic
version 3.3 [50] to predict Open Reading Frame (ORF)
using Medicago trunculata as a model organism and default
parameter conditions. Results from GeneMark predicted a
total of 44,112 ORFs. For functional annotation, the
potential coding regions were analyzed by BLAST2GO
[51] leading to consistent gene annotations, assigning
gene names, gene products, EC numbers and Gene Ontology (GO) numbers. Gene Ontology provides a system to
categorize description of gene products according to three
ontologies: molecular function, biological process and
cellular component. Sequence homology search revealed
that there were 1,542 ORFs matches with non-redundant
protein database with an E-value cut-off at E-6. Nine hundreds and fifty sequences were mapped to one or more
ontologies with multiple assignments possible for a given
protein within a single ontology. There were 647 assignments made to the molecular function ontology, with a
large proportion of these in catalytic (42.72%) and binding activities (44.17%) categories (Figure 3a). Under the
biological process ontology, 555 assignments were made
with a large proportion of assignments fell into metabolic
process and cellular process (such as secretory pathway,
transcription and translation) categories (Figure 3b).
Similarity of mungbean predicted ORFs with other plant
ESTs
To identify gene functions, the mungbean contig set was
blasted (TBLASTX) to identify ESTs encoding similar proteins, at an e-value cutoff at E-6, against other plant gene
indices collected in The Gene Index Databases, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, such as soybean (GMGI, 13.0), Arabidopsis (AGI, 13.0), rice (OGI, 17.0), M. truncatula
(MTGI, 9.0) and Vitis vinifera (VVGI, 6.0) [52]. The
number of sequences that showed similarity to encoding
sequences is shown in Figure 4. Comparison between the
mungbean dataset and the Glycine max gene index gave
the highest number of matched sequences (7,940
sequences). V. radiata and G. max are grouped together as
tropical season legumes or Phaseoloid exhibiting extensive genome conservation based on previous comparative
genetic mapping [53,54]. The other Papilionoideae legume, M. truncatula, which is a cold season legume, also
shares a large number of homologous sequences (5,759
sequences) with the mungbean dataset. A. thaliana and V.
vinifera gave lower number of matched sequences to the
mungbean dataset; 4872 and 4,949 sequences respectively. The lowest number of matched sequences (1,971
sequences) was observed when the mungbean dataset was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/137

blasted against the Oryza sativa gene index, the only
monocot plant used in the comparison.
Discovery of microRNA
To predict functional non-coding RNA, such as microRNA, in the mungbean dataset, we made computational
prediction of potential microRNA using MiRFinder to
search for the potential hairpin-loop structure in their
sequences [55]. Next we calculated the minimal folding
free energy (MFE) using Sfold [56]. There were 2,247
microRNA candidates with MFE < -25 kcal/mol which
were selected for further analysis. Then we blasted the
mungbean microRNA candidates against previously
known microRNAs from Arabidopsis, rice, and other
plant species to search for potentially conserved microRNAs. A total of 4 miRNA candidates had sequence homology with miR171, miR408, miR1171 and miR414, which
have been shown to target genes coding for SCARECROW-like proteins implicated in radial root pattern
[57], plantacyanin [58], copper chaperone [59] and translation initiation factor [60], respectively (Table 3).

Conclusion
The results provided by the present study highlight a reliable and efficient way in obtaining polymorphic microsatellite markers and characterization of putative genes
using shotgun genome sequences of Vigna radiata. A significance of the results from this study is that highthroughput shotgun sequences of mungbean can be useful not only for marker development, construction of linkage map, mungbean genetic improvement, phylogenetic
relationship, but also for gene discovery as the paucity of
DNA markers in cultivated mungbean has precluded
detailed genetic research on this crop.

Methods
Plant materials, DNA extraction and 454 Life Sciences
Sequencing
Seventeen accessions of mungbean (Vigna radiata) and the
other 23 taxa of legumes in the tribe Phaseoleae including
genus Vigna (African Vigna and Asian Vigna), Phaseolus
and Glycine as listed in Additional File 3 were used in this
study. For sequencing, DNA was extracted from young leaf
tissue of mungbean cultivar "Kamphaeng Saen 1" using
DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). For SSR analysis, DNA
of all plant materials was extracted from young fresh
leaves using CTAB method [61]. The concentration of
each sample was calculated from OD measurement and
the samples were separated by gel electrophoresis on
0.8% agarose gels. The sequencing was performed using
the GS-FLX instrument (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT)
and yielded 470,024 quality filtered sequence reads with
the average length of 216 bp. The reads were deposited
into NCBI Short Read Archive.

[31]. For comparison of SSRs in plant genomic sequences,
we used the criteria of SSR motif of ≥ 20 bases [31,62,63].
Primer pairs were designed to amplify microsatellite
regions using PRIMER3 [64]. PCR was carried out in a
total volume of 10 μL containing 2 ng of DNA template,
1× Taq buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas) and 0.5 μM each of forward and
reverse primers. Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) programmed as follow: 94°C for 2 min followed by
35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50-65°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1
min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were separated on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver-staining.

Isolation, amplification and transferability of SSR markers
In order to identify microsatellite markers, non-redundant sequences were screened for SSRs using TROLL software http://wsmartins.net/webtroll/troll.html. For the
searches, we defined SSRs as being DNP ≥ 14 bases; TNP

Analysis of polymorphic loci
Seventeen mungbean genotypes as listed in Additional
File 3 were used for polymorphism analysis of SSR markers. Details of primer pairs for SSR markers are listed in
Additional File 4. Scoring data from polymorphic loci
were used to calculate Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) [65], Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
[66], pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) using chisquare test, and observed heterozygosity and expected
heterozygosity using the PowerMarker 3.25 software [67].
Cross taxa transferability and phylogenetic relationship
The cross taxa transferability of all scorable 127 SSR loci
was evaluated using 17 accessions of mungbean (Vigna
radiata) and the other 23 taxa of legumes in the tribe Phaseoleae including genus Vigna (African Vigna and Asian
Vigna), Phaseolus and Glycine (see Additional File 3). The
percentage of transferability was calculated for each taxon
(23 taxa) in which the detected fragment/the total
number of loci analyzed. A genetic similarity matrix (see
Additional File 2) was prepared for 35 genotypes from 20
taxa at 16 SSR loci (as listed in Additiional File 4).
UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
mean) cluster analysis was conducted using software
NTSYSpc 2.2 [41].
Analysis of gene content and annotation
The mungbean contig set was analyzed in two parts which
are 1) gene prediction/Gene Ontology (GO) term annotation and 2) functional gene identification. Gene-

Mark.hmm eukaryotic version 3.3 [50] based on Hidden
Markov Models was used to predict coding sequence (cds)
of the contig set using Medicago trunculata as a model
organism and default parameter conditions. For the functional annotation, the potential coding sequences were
analyzed by BLAST2GO [51]. To identify gene functions,
sequence similarity search program-BLAST was used to
identify ESTs encoding similar proteins of the mungbean
contig set. All 46,646 contigs were blasted (TBLASTX)
with the threshold E-value cutoff at 1e-6 against 580,213
assembled Unique Transcripts sequences from various
plant species from The Plant Genome DataBase (PlantGDB) [52], which included Arabidopsis thaliana
(324,630), Glycine max (105,862), Medicago truncatula
(57,231), Oryza sativa (44,644), and Vitis vinifera
(47,846).
