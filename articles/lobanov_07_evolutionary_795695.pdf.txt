Conclusion: Our data suggest many selenoproteins originated at the base of the eukaryotic
domain and show that the environment plays an important role in selenoproteome evolution. In
particular, aquatic organisms apparently retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes,
whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost.
These findings suggest a hypothesis that, with the exception of vertebrates, aquatic life supports
selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element due to
an unknown environmental factor.

Results: We analyzed the selenoproteomes of several model eukaryotes and detected 26 and 29
selenoprotein genes in the green algae Ostreococcus tauri and Ostreococcus lucimarinus, respectively,
five in the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, three in the fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, and 16
in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, including several new selenoproteins. Distinct selenoprotein
patterns were verified by metabolic labeling of O. tauri and D. discoideum with 75Se. More than half
of the selenoprotein families were shared by unicellular eukaryotes and mammals, consistent with
their ancient origin. Further analyses identified massive, independent selenoprotein losses in land
plants, fungi, nematodes, insects and some protists. Comparative analyses of selenoprotein-rich and
-deficient organisms revealed that aquatic organisms generally have large selenoproteomes,
whereas several groups of terrestrial organisms reduced their selenoproteomes through loss of
selenoprotein genes and replacement of Sec with cysteine.

Background

Selenium is an essential trace element in many, but not all,
life forms. Its essentiality is based on the fact that this element
is present in natural proteins in the form of selenocysteine
(Sec), a rare amino acid that chemically differs from serine or
cysteine (Cys) by a single atom (for example, Se instead of O
or S) [1]. Sec is known as the 21st amino acid in the genetic
code as it has its own biosynthetic machinery, a tRNA and an
elongation factor, and is inserted into nascent polypeptides
co-translationally in response to the Sec codon, UGA [2-4].
Selenoproteins often escape attention of genome annotators,
because in-frame UGA codons are interpreted as stop signals.
However, several bioinformatics tools have recently been
developed that help identify these genes [5,6]. The use of
these methods begins to shed light on proteins and processes
dependent on selenium, as well as on the occurrence and distribution of these processes in various life forms.
Sec is typically found in active sites of redox enzymes, which
are functionally similar to thiol-based oxidoreductases [7].
Sec-containing proteins occur in all major lines of descent
(for example, eukaryota, eubacteria and archaea), but not all
organisms have these proteins. Prokaryotic genomes have
been extensively analyzed for the occurrence of selenoprotein
genes [8], but among eukaryotes, only the genomes of mammals (human, mouse) [9], nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggzae) [10], fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster) [11], green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) [12] and Plasmodia [13,14] have been analyzed with
regard to the entire set of selenoproteins (selenoproteomes).
In addition, the genomes of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana
and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been scanned
for the occurrence of selenoprotein genes and Sec biosynthetic/insertion machinery genes and found to have neither
[9].
Selenoproteome analyses also revealed that various organisms have substantially different sets of selenoproteins. One
example of uneven selenoprotein occurrence is selenoprotein
U (SelU), which occurs in fish, birds and some unicellular
eukaryotes, but is present in the form of a Cys-containing
homolog in mammals and many other eukaryotes. Even a
narrower occurrence has been described for SelJ and Fep15
[15,16].
In this study, we characterized the selenoproteomes encoded
in several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes.
Detailed analyses of these selenoproteomes and comparison
with those of other eukaryotic model organisms revealed an
ancient origin of most eukaryotic selenoproteins and a possibility of increased Sec utilization in aquatic environments and
decreased use of Sec in terrestrial habitats. These studies provide important insights into selenoprotein origin and dynamics of selenoprotein evolution.

Results and discussion
Eukaryotic selenoproteomes
Several eukaryotes have been previously analyzed for their
selenoprotein content (selenoproteomes). These studies
identified 24-25 selenoproteins in mammals and 0-4 selenoproteins in other organisms. It is generally thought that many
eukaryotic selenoproteins evolved in vertebrates, but evolutionary paths have not been examined for the majority of
these proteins. In this work, we analyzed the selenoproteomes of several additional model eukaryotes, whose
genomes have been completed. These included marine algae
(Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus), a diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana), a soil amoeba (Dictyostelium discoideum), an insect (Drosophila pseudoobscura), and a red alga
(Cyanidioschyzon merolae).

Drosophila pseudoobscura
The D. pseudoobscura subgroup [17] is found mainly in the
temperate and tropical zones of the New World [18]. Application of an earlier version of SECISearch to the D. melanogaster genome identified three selenoprotein genes (SelK/
G-rich, SelH/BthD and SPS2); however, it was not known
whether this set represents the entire Drosophila selenoproteome. We applied an advanced version of SECISearch (see
Materials and methods and Additional data file 1) to analyze
the D. pseudoobscura genome and, in addition, analyzed D.
pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster genomes in parallel to
identify evolutionarily conserved selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS) elements using relaxed SECIS criteria.
These searches resulted in the same, already known set of
three selenoproteins (Table 1), suggesting that the selenoproteome of insects of the Drosophila genus consists of these
three proteins. By homology analyses, we then identified
three selenoproteins in a mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and
one in a honey bee, Apis mellifera.

Ostreococcus tauri
O. tauri is a unicellular green alga that was discovered in the
Mediterranean Thau lagoon in 1994. It belongs to the family
Prasinophyceae, which is thought to be the most primitive in
the green plant lineage from which all other green algae and
ancestors of land plants have descended. This organism has a
very small genome, 11.5 Mb [19], especially when compared to
other sequenced Plantae genomes (for example, the Arabidopsis genome is 125 Mb [20] and that of Chlamydomonas
exceeds 100 Mb [21,22]). The O. tauri genome is densely
packed and provides a useful genomic model for green plants
[23]. Previous research revealed the lack of selenoproteins in
land plants [9], whereas 10 selenoproteins were detected in
the green alga C. reinhardtii [12]. Surprisingly, we detected
26 selenoprotein genes in O. tauri.
Among the known selenoproteins detected in O. tauri, fourteen were homologs of human selenoproteins (thioredoxin
reductase (TR), SelT, SelM, SelK, SelS, Sep15, SelO, SelH,
SelW and five glutathione peroxidase (GPx) homologs), five

information

O. lucimarinus, previously known as Ostreococcus sp.
CCE9901, is a close relative of O. tauri adapted to high light
and isolated from surface waters. Its genome size is 13.2 Mb.

C. merolae is an ultrasmall unicellular red alga that lives in
acidic hot springs. It is thought to retain primitive features of
cellular and genome organization. C. merolae has a simple
cell architecture, containing a single nucleus, a single mitochondrion and a single chloroplast. Its genome size is 16 Mbp,
which is approximately one-seventh the size of the A. thaliana genome. Its chloroplast might be among the most ancestral [26]. A BLAST search against the C. merolae genome
revealed several known components of the Sec insertion
machinery, including SBP2, EFsec, SecS and SPS2, suggesting that selenoproteins should also be present in this organism. However, a search for SECIS elements followed by ORF
analyses revealed no candidate selenoproteins in the C. merolae genome.

refereed research

We metabolically labeled O. tauri cells with 75Se and analyzed
the selenoprotein pattern on SDS PAGE gels using a PhosphorImager (Figure 2a). This method detects the most abundant selenoproteins. The overall pattern was similar to that of
human HEK 293 and other mammalian cells. As in mammalian cells, the dominant 25 kDa band in the alga was likely a
glutathione peroxidase, and one or both major selenoprotein
bands in the 50-55 kDa range likely corresponded to thioredoxin reductase. Consistent with the genomics analysis, the
number of selenoprotein bands in the O. tauri sample was
higher than in mammalian cells.

Similar to O. tauri, all O. lucimarinus SECIS elements except
one had a conserved G in the position directly preceding the
SECIS core (Figure 1a), and in addition a single ATGA-type
SECIS element was found. Interestingly, single ATGA-type
SECIS elements occur in different selenoprotein genes in the
two Ostreococcus species. In O. lucimarinus, this SECIS type
is within a glutathione peroxidase gene, while in O. tauri the
ATGA-type SECIS is in the gene for a hypothetical protein. In
contrast to O. tauri, no type I SECIS elements (Figure 1a)
were found in O. lucimarinus.

deposited research

Of interest was the observation that all O. tauri SECIS elements except one had a conserved G in the position directly
preceding the quartet of non-Watson-Crick interacting nucleotides (Figure 1). Most eukaryotic SECIS elements have an A
in this position, although the G was described in several
zebrafish and nematode selenoprotein genes [10,24,25]. In
addition, almost all O. tauri SECIS elements had a long ministem in the apical portion of the structure (for example, SelT
in Figure 1). This feature was also observed previously in a
number of Chlamydomonas SECIS elements [12].

Homologs of all identified O. tauri selenoproteins were found
in O. lucimarinus. In addition, three new sequences were
identified, raising the number of selenoproteins in this organism to 29. This is the largest selenoproteome of all previously
analyzed eukaryotes (although even larger selenoproteomes
apparently exist; Lobanov and Gladyshev, unpublished).
Additional selenoproteins included a peroxiredoxin, and peroxiredoxin-like and SelW-like proteins. The latter O. lucimarinus selenoprotein contained two predicted Sec residues.

were homologs of eukaryotic selenoproteins with restricted
distribution (MsrA, SelU and three PDI homologs) and three
were homologs of bacterial selenoproteins (methyltransferase, thioredoxin-fold protein and peroxiredoxin). We also
identified four novel eukaryotic selenoproteins in the O. tauri
genome. These included a predicted membrane selenoprotein
(MSP) and three hypothetical proteins of unknown function.
In addition, several excellent SECIS element candidates were
identified during analysis, but at present no suitable open
reading frames (ORFs) could be identified upstream of these
structures, in part because of the inadequate length of contigs. Therefore, the total number of Ostreococcus selenoproteins might be even higher than 26.

information

By searching for SECIS elements, we detected 16 selenoprotein genes in T. pseudonana (Table 1). In addition, a partial
SelO sequence was detected, but it did not include the regions
corresponding to the possible Sec codon and SECIS element.

interactions

T. pseudonana is a marine-centric diatom that serves as a
model for studies on diatom physiology [28]. A Sec tRNA
sequence [29] and one selenoprotein, Sec-containing glutathione peroxidase [30], have been identified in this organism.
In this work, we isolated and directly sequenced the T. pseudonana Sec tRNA (see Additional data file 3 for the sequence
and clover-leaf structure), which exhibited features typical of
eukaryotic Sec tRNAs.

Interestingly, all identified Dictyostelium SECIS elements
had a highly conserved UGUA sequence that preceded the
SECIS core, and a U-U mismatch immediately following it
(Figure 5). The SECIS element of the deiodinase-like protein
had two U-U mismatches; however, they were located further
from the SECIS core. All detected SECIS elements were type
II structures [24]. The deiodinase-like SECIS element had an
extremely long mini-stem. As discussed above, the latter feature was also observed in many Ostreococcus selenoprotein
genes, whereas it rarely occurs in SECIS structures in other
organisms. All Dictyostelium SECIS elements had an
unpaired AAA in the apical bulge. The areas of strong conservation include an SBP2-binding site and nucleotides interacting with this protein [32]. Since the five selenoproteins have
different evolutionary histories and are not homologous with
each other, the conservation of primary sequences in Dictyostelium SECIS elements must represent convergent evolutionary events.

refereed research

Thalassiosira pseudonana

D. discoideum is a slime mold that primarily inhabits soil or
dung and feeds on bacteria. We previously reported the finding of Sec tRNA in this organism [31]. In the present study, we
analyzed its selenoproteome and found SPS2, SelK, Sep15,
MSP and a homolog of thyroid hormone deiodinase (Table 2).
The presence of the deiodinase homolog was unexpected as
thyroid hormones are not known to occur in amoebae. However, this sequence assignment was unambiguous; for example, the D. discoideum selenoprotein exhibited 39% sequence
identity to iodothyronine deiodinase type I from Fundulus
heteroclitus (accession number AAO31952) and 37% identity
to iodothyronine deiodinase type III from Sus scrofa (accession number NP_001001625). Among the five amoebae
selenoproteins, MSP had the narrowest distribution and
could only be detected in Dictyostelium, Chlamydomonas,
Volvox and both Ostreococcus species. This novel selenoprotein had two Sec residues.

deposited research

The presence of the Sec insertion machinery in C. merolae
and detection of a selenoprotein in a related red alga suggest
that Sec-containing proteins exist in this evolutionary branch.
It is possible that the difficulties in identifying selenoproteins
in C. merolae may be due to incompleteness of the genome or
presence of lineage-specific selenoprotein(s), whose
homologs are not represented in sequence databases. In addition, it is possible that the small selenoproteome of C. merolae resulted in unusual SECIS elements, which could not be
detected by SECISearch. It is clear, however, that the selenoproteome of this organism is extremely small.

Dictyostelium discoideum
reports

We applied additional sensitive tools for identification of
selenoproteins in the red algal genome. Most homologs of
known selenoproteins were found to either have Cys in place
of Sec or were missing in this organism. We further carried
out a search for Sec/Cys pairs in homologous sequences using
the C. merolae genome and all protein sequences extracted
from NCBI non-redundant database. Again, no selenoproteins were detected in C. merolae. To test if related organisms
possess selenoproteins, all available red algal ESTs were
extracted from NCBI dbEST and searched for SECIS elements
using SECISearch. This analysis revealed one bona-fide
selenoprotein, SelO, in Porphyra haitanensis, which was also
highly homologous to the O. tauri SelO (Additional data file
2). The red algal SECIS element was also detected in these
sequences (Figure 4).

The T. pseudonana selenoproteome includes two GPx
homologs, SelT, TR, SPS2, two SelM, two SelU, MsrA, two
PDI homologs, a predicted SAM-dependent methyltransferase, two peroxiredoxins and one thioredoxin-like protein.
It is remarkable that in spite of large evolutionary distances,
Ostreococcus, Thalassiosira and mammalian selenoprotein
sets were large and showed a significant overlap, whereas
many other eukaryotes, including some animals, had small
selenoproteomes.

reviews

tRNAscan-SE, were also unsuccessful. We were able to identify the C. merolae Sec tRNA using our recently described tool
for detection of unusual tRNAs [27]. This tRNA (Figure 3) has
all the features characteristic of Sec tRNAs, such as the UCA
anticodon and a long variable stem.

Selenoproteins are found in all three domains of life, which
share several protein and RNA components involved in Sec
biosynthesis and insertion, suggesting an origin of the Sec
machinery that predates the last universal common ancestor.
Thus, Sec decoding is an ancient trait that has been maintained for hundreds of million of years without widespread
expansion or loss.

To further examine the Dictyostelium selenoproteome, we
metabolically labeled the amoebae cells with 75Se and analyzed the selenoprotein pattern on SDS PAGE using a PhosphorImager (Figure 2b). Four selenoprotein bands were
detected, which corresponded in size to the four selenoproteins identified computationally (SPS, MSP, DI and Sep15).
Apparently, Sep15 was a major selenoprotein in D. discoideum, whereas SelK was not detected. The latter
selenoprotein might be expressed at low levels or under
different growth or developmental conditions than those
examined in our study.

We used the observation of unusually high sequence conservation of Dictyostelium SECIS elements to develop a
modified version of SECISearch, which allowed the searches
wherein other search parameters were relaxed. However,
application of this procedure did not detect additional
selenoproteins.

We compiled newly and previously characterized selenoproteomes and analyzed the occurrence of particular selenoproteins against taxonomic distribution of species based on the
tree of life [33]. The number of selenoproteins varied from
zero (in plants, yeast and some protists) to 29 (in Ostreococcus) (Figure 6a). Significant differences in the composition of
selenoproteomes could be seen even among related organisms. For example, among viridiplantae, all higher plants
lacked selenoproteins, whereas the green algae
Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus had 12 and 26-29 selenoproteins, respectively (Figure 6b). Three selenoproteins were
found in Mesostigma viride, a Streptophyte and a common
ancestor of land plants [34].

Since mammalian selenoproteomes were large and included
essentially all known eukaryotic selenoproteins, they were
initially thought to represent the entire eukaryotic selenoproteome. Subsequent identification of selenoproteins with

evolution

highly restricted occurrence added further complexity, but
did not challenge the overall idea of recent evolution of the
majority of eukaryotic selenoproteins. However, our analysis
of selenoproteomes of six eukaryotic model organisms and
their comparison with the previously characterized
selenoproteomes revealed that 20 of the 25 human selenoproteins have Sec-containing homologs in many unicellular
organisms. Similarly, taking into account protein families, at
least 11 of the 16 mammalian selenoprotein families could be
traced back to single-cell eukaryotes. SelU, which is not a
selenoprotein in mammals, is present in some animals and
protozoa and may be viewed as an additional ancient selenoprotein family. Overall, these data suggest that the origin of
many selenoproteins not only precedes animal evolution, but
can be dated back to the ancestral eukaryotes. Thus, many of
these original selenoproteins were preserved during
evolution and remain in vertebrates (including mammals),
green algae and a variety of protists, whereas many other
organisms manifested massive selenoprotein losses.

refereed research

Tracing individual selenoproteins, we found that some
selenoprotein families were present in many organisms and
others in only a few species, yet each identified family had a
unique pattern of occurrence (Figure 6a). None of the
selenoproteins matched the overall Sec trait (compared to the
occurrence of Sec machinery). SelK was among the most
widespread selenoproteins. This protein of unknown function
is present in nearly all eukaryotes that utilize Sec (but is
replaced with a Cys-containing homolog in nematodes and
several other organisms). An additional widespread selenoprotein was SelW, which also occurs in most (but not all)
selenoprotein-containing eukaryotes. Several other selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin
reductase, also had a wide distribution.

Red algae selenoprotein O. SECIS elements in O. tauri (green alga) and P. haitanensis (red alga) SelO genes

Red algae selenoprotein O. SECIS elements in O. tauri (green alga) and P. haitanensis (red alga) SelO genes. The P. haitanensis SECIS element belongs to type
I, while O. tauri to type II structures.

It should be noted that Cys/Sec replacement is not always
unidirectional and that prior evolutionary analyses suggest
that both a Sec loss and gain is possible [35]. However, the
probability of independent parallel Sec gain, as well as
consecutive homoplastic Sec-to-Cys and Cys-to-Sec substitutions in a single protein position, is extremely rare, and no
selenoprotein families are known that evolved more than
once. Two factors are required for a Cys-to-Sec change to take
place. First, the presence of Sec insertion machinery, such as
Sec tRNA, SECIS-binding protein SBP2, Sec-specific elongation factor and Sec synthase. This requirement is met (for
example, all components of the machinery are present) if at
least one other selenoprotein is present in the same organism.
Second, a SECIS element should evolve in the 3'-untranslated
region. While only a single nucleotide change is sufficient to
change the codon from Cys to Sec (that is, UGA instead of
UGC or UGU), evolution of new SECIS elements is difficult.
On the other hand, once Sec is replaced with Cys, the presence
of the SECIS element provides no competitive advantage and
this structure is quickly lost. Unless the reverse Cys-to-Sec
mutation takes place before disruption of the SECIS element,
the probability of restoring Sec is extremely low. Unless
strong pressure exists to preserve Sec, its functional replace-

ment with Cys may be expected. Combined, these factors
allow us to assume that the character-state Sec follows Dollo's
behavior.

Selenoproteins with restricted occurrence are
common to organisms with large selenoproteomes
In addition to the many ancient eukaryotic selenoproteins,
several selenoproteins have a more narrow distribution. For
example, SelP, SelN, MsrB and SelI appear to be specific to
animals, whereas MSP, peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin-like
protein could be detected only in unicellular eukaryotes.
These observations suggest an emerging picture of selenoprotein evolution wherein core selenoprotein families evolved
first, followed by the origin of additional selenoproteins in
more narrow groups of organisms. The new selenoproteins
further increased the size of the selenoproteomes and remain
prevalent in organisms with large selenoproteomes. In our
current analysis, several Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira
selenoproteins fit this pattern, in addition to the rare selenoproteins previously discovered (for example, SelU, SelJ and
Fep15). However, it could not be excluded that new selenoproteins might also occasionally evolve in organisms with
small selenoproteomes (for example, red algae).

We further identified and examined several groups of organisms characterized by massive selenoprotein loss. Location of
these organisms on the eukaryotic tree of life suggests independent events of selenoprotein loss (Figure 6a). Five examples of selenoprotein loss are discussed below.

Apicomplexan parasites
The high selenoprotein content of Thalassiosira (as a reference point), the reduced selenoproteome of Plasmodium and
the lack of selenoproteins in Cryptosporidium parvum illustrates an example of massive selenoprotein loss in apicomplexan parasites.

information

The small selenoproteomes of A. gambiae, A. mellifera, D.
pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster, which consist of one to
three selenoproteins, is an additional example of large-scale
selenoprotein loss. On the other hand, aquatic arthropods,
such as shrimp, have many selenoprotein genes (based on the
expressed sequence tag (EST) analyses as the genomes are
not yet available; unpublished data). Thus, it appears that
selenoprotein genes were massively lost in either insects, or
all terrestrial arthropods.

interactions

As discussed above, A. thaliana, O. sativa and other higher
plants lost both selenoproteins and Sec insertion machinery,
whereas these genes were preserved in green algae, for example, Chlamydomonas, Volvox and Ostreococcus. An early
Streptophyte, M. viride, has both Sec machinery and selenoproteins. Thus, there was a specific selenoprotein loss event
in the Streptophyte subset of Viridiplantae, which invaded
land. Analysis of selenoproteins present in green algae suggests that they were either replaced with Cys-containing
homologs or entirely lost in land plants (Figure 6b). A more
distantly related C. merolae also manifested a large-scale
selenoprotein loss.

Nematodes
The selenoproteomes of C. elegans and C. briggsae have only
one selenoprotein, thioredoxin reductase, and, therefore, the
Sec insertion system is used to decode only a single UGA
codon in these nematodes [10].
The decreased size of selenoproteomes in these five groups of
organisms appears to be not only due to the loss of entire
selenoprotein genes, but also due to replacement of Sec with
Cys. Thus, Cys-containing homologs, while often catalytically
inefficient, may occasionally compensate for selenoprotein
loss [36].

A hypothesis for association of large selenoproteomes
and aquatic life
The mosaic occurrence of eukaryotic selenoproteins and their
consistent loss in different phyla suggest that the decreased
selenoproteome size is the result of a selective force. What
could be the factors responsible for or associated with selenoprotein loss? Comparative analysis of organisms with large
and small selenoproteomes shows that many of the selenoprotein-rich organisms live in aquatic environments. In contrast, almost all organisms that lack or have a small number
of selenoproteins are terrestrial (Figure 6). Considering independent, large-scale selenoprotein loss in these organisms, a

common denominator appears to be the non-aquatic habitat.
It should be noted, however, that the differences between
aquatic and terrestrial selenoproteomes are ultimately influenced by specific environmental factors that differ with habitat. Therefore, the aquatic/terrestrial association should not
be viewed as the basis for selenoprotein loss/gain, but rather
a convenient illustration of differences between these organisms. Once environmental factors are identified, this association may be modified to reflect these factors rather than
habitat.
To further examine selenoprotein content of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, we analyzed organisms that are well represented by ESTs. We excluded large animals (vertebrates)
from this analysis because their intra-organismal environment would be less affected by environmental conditions due
to availability of their outside protective cover and complex
morphology. With this limitation, aquatic eukaryotes had
more selenoprotein genes than terrestrial organisms (Figure
7).
Whether C. merolae fits this association is not clear. This
organism lives in highly acidic sulfate-rich hot springs (pH
1.5, 45°C). It is possible that this extreme environment is
responsible for the reduced use of Sec in red algae. The pKa of

orthologous proteins in order to be considered further.

These modifications allowed increased sensitivity of SECISearch and supported identification of unusual SECIS structures. The overall strategy of the searches was similar to that

Until recently, the mammalian selenoproteome was thought
to represent accurately eukaryotic selenoproteins and to be of
recent (perhaps vertebrate) origin. However, as additional
genome sequences became available, selenoproteins with
restricted occurrence have been identified. In mammals,
these proteins either occur in the form of Cys-containing
homologs or are absent altogether; instead, these rare selenoproteins have been found in several lower eukaryotic organisms. In our work, the searches of additional eukaryotic
genomes identified new selenoprotein genes, revealed examples of convergent evolution of SECIS elements, and identified many features of selenoproteome organization and

Whether mammals and other vertebrates fit the hypothesis
on the preferential use of selenium in aquatic environments is
not clear. We note, however, that fish have larger selenoproteomes than those living in terrestrial environments, including mammals, reptiles and birds. Further genomic analyses of
these organisms could clarify evolutionary changes in utilization of selenium. In future studies, it would also be important
to determine which of the factors discussed above influence
the preferential use of Sec in aquatic organisms or are responsible for the loss of selenoproteins in terrestrial organisms.

evolution. Integrated analyses of eukaryotic selenoproteomes
suggested that the majority of eukaryotic selenoprotein families evolved in single-celled eukaryotes. Our data show that
the mosaic occurrence of selenoproteins is the consequence of
selective, independent selenoprotein loss events in various
eukaryotic phyla. Moreover, these analyses revealed an interesting pattern: large selenoproteomes tend to occur in aquatic
life, whereas the organisms that lack selenoproteins or have
small selenoproteomes are mostly terrestrial (with the notable exception of mammals, whose large bodies and intraorganismal homeostasis support an internal environment
that may be less dependent on habitat). Further studies will
be needed to test this hypothesis and identify environmental
factors that influence selenium utilization.

reviews

One possible explanation for the occurrence of large selenoproteomes in aquatic organisms is bioavailability of selenium
in oceans. Dissolved organic selenides can account for
approximately 80% of the dissolved selenium in ocean water
[37] and represent an important source of selenium for phytoplankton. Following the food chain, this could explain a
large number of selenoproteins in algae and fish. Likewise, a
considerable number of selenoproteins in mammals could
reflect the consequence of food sources, body size and relatively recent (in evolutionary terms) emergence of these
organisms from marine environments. An additional factor
may be constancy in the environmental conditions and nutrients in the aquatic environments. For aquatic organisms,
environmental changes are slower and involve gradients of
temperature, pH, pressure, oxygen and chemical environment. In contrast, in terrestrial environments, the changes
are more frequent and they happen more suddenly. As a
result, terrestrial organisms often face feast and starvation
situations. An attractive factor to explain the differences
between aquatic and terrestrial selenoproteomes may be oxygen content. Higher content of oxygen in air than in aquatic
environments may make highly reactive selenoproteins more
susceptible to oxidation in terrestrial organisms and select
against the use of these proteins.

comment

Sec is approximately 5.5. Whereas this residue would be ionized in most organisms under physiological conditions, at low
pH, protonation of Sec may minimize its catalytic advantages.
Abundance of sulfate in hot springs might also be of importance, as selenium and sulfur have similar chemistries.

Eukaryotic selenoproteomes. (a) A simplified cladogram of model organisms discussed in the text that illustrates distribution of selenoproteins in
eukaryotes. The number of selenoproteins in each indicated model organism is shown in red (current study) and gray (previously analyzed and other
model organisms) squares, and is proportional to the size of the bars on the left. Yellow circles show possible origins of various selenoprotein families, and
red crosses examples of massive selenoprotein loss. (b) Selenoprotein evolution in plants. The 'mountain' symbols show terrestrial organisms, and
'anchors' those that live in aquatic environments. Green checkmarks indicate the presence of an indicated selenoprotein in the corresponding genome.
The presence of Cys-containing homologs is shown by blue checkmarks. Crossed red circles indicate absence of either Sec- or Cys-containing homologs.
Unfilled spots correspond to lack of data due to unfinished genomes, unclear relationship between proteins and lineage specific gene duplications.

The primary sequence analysis step included searches for

Figure invertebrates have more selenoproteins than terrestrial organisms
Aquatic 7
Aquatic invertebrates have more selenoproteins than terrestrial organisms. Numbers of detected selenoproteins were plotted against the total number of
available (redundant) ESTs for organisms that are represented by more than 25,000 ESTs. Vertebrate ESTs were excluded from this analysis due to large
size of these organisms. Blue circles correspond to aquatic and brown squares to terrestrial organisms. The difference is statistically significant (P value is
less than 2 × 10-6).

The secondary structure analysis step examined for consistency with the eukaryotic SECIS element consensus. Several
additional filters were implemented to filter out candidates
with unsuitable secondary structures, including SECIS
elements with more than two unpaired nucleotides in a row
and Y-shaped SECIS elements.
The free energy for each candidate structure was estimated;
the free energies for the whole structure (threshold value of 12.6 kcal/mol) and the upper stem-loop (threshold value of 3.7 kcal/mol) were calculated. Only thermodynamically stable structures were considered further.
Based on the location of candidate SECIS elements, candidate
ORFs were predicted in upstream regions. SECIS candidates
located within coding regions of known proteins were filtered
out. An additional requirement was the presence of at least
one homologous protein in the NCBI non-redundant database. If SECIS elements and ORFs corresponding to known
protein families were on different DNA strands, the candidates were filtered out.
The final step included manual sequence analyses of predicted selenoprotein ORFs located upstream of candidate
SECIS elements.

tes, it is less so in eukaryotes, particularly in multicellular
organisms. We also analyzed selenoprotein evolution in the
eukaryotic domain. To reconstruct the phylogenies of selenoproteins, we adopted a character-based tree estimation
method, a maximum parsimony approach that implies that
the preferred phylogenetic tree is the tree that requires the
least number of evolutionary changes.

Metabolic labeling of D. discoideum and O. tauri cells
D. discoideum cells were grown as previously described [31],
the medium was supplemented with 100 μCi of 75Se [selenite]
(University of Missouri Research Reactor), and the cells were
further maintained under continuous shaking for two days. A
similar procedure was used for labeling O. tauri cells, except
that they were grown in K-medium. The radioactive bands
were visualized on the gel with a PhosphorImager. Samples of
75Se-labeled mammalian HEK 293 and CV-1 cells were
included, which were prepared as described previously [49].

Searches using the Sec/Cys homology approach
For three organisms, O. tauri, O. lucimarinus and C. merolae,
additional procedures for selenoprotein detection included
the search for Sec/Cys pairs in homologous sequences. ORFs
with in-frame TGA codons were extracted that satisfied the
following criteria: Sec-flanking regions for these proteins
were conserved; and homologs could be detected that contained Cys in place of Sec. TBLASTX was used to examine all
potential ORFs with in-frame UGA codons against NCBI nonredundant protein database. All hits were then tested for the
occurrence of SECIS elements. Orthologous proteins were
defined as bidirectional best hits. PSI-BLAST was used for
identification of distant homologs. Homologs were further
confirmed by phylogenetic trees construction.

Phylogenetic analyses
Numerous attempts to derive a tree of life using various methods that were based on genes encoding ribosomal RNAs and
several proteins have been published. However, their principle existence has been questioned recently because of either
an insufficient amount of discriminating characters or other
biases such as horizontal gene transfer and chimerism. To
avoid such problems, we adopted a eukaryotic branch of a
phylogenetic tree recently developed by Ciccarelli et al. [33].
This highly resolved tree of life utilized 31 concatenated, universally occurring genes with indisputable orthology in 191
species with completed genomes across all three domains of
life. The missing organisms were filled in using a 'Tree of Life'
web project [44] and selected publications 5-48]. Although
the horizontal gene transfer is highly prevalent in prokaryo-

Note added in proof

Two recent studies reported the complete genomes of O. tauri
and O. lucimarinus [50,51]. One of these articles identified 18
and 20 selenoprotein genes in O. tauri and O. lucimarinus,
respectively [51]. Compared to our analyses, this published
study did not detect 17 selenoproteins in the two organisms,
whereas the protein they designated as SelA and predicted to
contain three selenocysteines appears to be a false positive.
Nevertheless, the large number of detected selenoproteins in
Ostreococcus further highlights the association with aquatic
life reported in our work.
