Rationale

With the huge array of bioinformatics software tools and
resources available, it might seem unthinkable that functional annotation accuracy would be so difficult to ensure.
Rather like the parable of the blind men and the elephant,
each tool used separately provides a partial and imperfect picture; taken as a whole, the probable molecular function of the
protein, biological process, cellular component, interacting
partners, and other aspects of a protein's function can often
come into better focus. For instance, annotation transfer from
the top BLAST hit may suggest a protein is a receptor-like
protein kinase, while domain structure prediction reveals

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R83

information

An additional complicating factor in annotation transfer by
homology is the complete failure of this approach for an aver-

age of 30% of the genes in most genomes sequenced: in some
cases no homologs can be detected within a particular significance threshold, for instance, a BLAST [10] expectation (E)
value (that is, the number of hits receiving a given score
expected by chance alone in the database searched) of 0.001
or less, while in other cases database hits may be labeled as
'hypothetical' or 'unknown'.

interactions

Computational methods for protein function prediction have
been critical in the post-genome era in the functional annotation of literally millions of novel sequences. The standard protocol for sequence functional annotation - transferring the
annotation of a database hit to a sequence 'query' based on
predicted homology - has been shown to be prone to systematic error [1-3]. The top hit in a sequence database may have
a different function to the query due to neofunctionalization
stemming from gene duplication [4], differences in domain
structure [5,6], mutations at key functional positions, or speciation [1]. Annotation errors have been shown to propagate
through databases by the application of homology-based
annotation transfer [7-9]. While the exact frequency of annotation error is unknown (one published estimate is 8% or
higher [7]), the importance of detecting and correcting existing errors and preventing future errors is undisputed.

The Berkeley Phylogenomics Group presents PhyloFacts, a structural phylogenomic encyclopedia
containing almost 10,000 'books' for protein families and domains, with pre-calculated structural,
functional and evolutionary analyses. PhyloFacts enables biologists to avoid the systematic errors
associated with function prediction by homology through the integration of a variety of
experimental data and bioinformatics methods in an evolutionary framework. Users can submit
sequences for classification to families and functional subfamilies. PhyloFacts is available as a
worldwide web resource from http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/phylofacts.

that no kinase domain is present; the two orthogonal analyses
prevent mis-annotation of the unknown protein.
In this paper we present PhyloFacts, an online structural phylogenomics encyclopedia containing almost 10,000 'books'
for protein families and domains, designed to improve the
accuracy and specificity of protein function prediction [11].
PhyloFacts integrates a wide array of biological data and
informatics methods for protein families, organized on the
basis of structural similarity and by evolutionary relationships. This enables a biologist to examine a rich array of
experimental data and bioinformatics predictions for a protein family, and to quickly and accurately infer the function of
a protein in an evolutionary context.

Annotation accuracy requires data and method
integration

PhyloFacts is motivated by two of the biggest lessons of the
post-genome era - the power of integrating data and inference
tools from different sources, and improved prediction accuracy using consensus approaches in bioinformatics. For
instance, protein structure prediction 'meta-servers' making
predictions based on a consensus over results retrieved from
several independent servers typically have lower error rates
than any one server used separately [12]. In the case of protein structure prediction, we can also take advantage of the
fact that members of a large diverse protein family tend to
share the same three-dimensional structure even when their
primary sequence similarity becomes undetectable. This enables us to use another type of consensus approach involving
the application of the same method to several different members of the family to boost prediction accuracy (for example,
[13]).
We employ the same basic principles in this resource, by integrating many different prediction methods and sources of
experimental data over an evolutionary tree. In cases where
attributes are known to persist over long evolutionary distances (such as protein three-dimensional structure), we can
integrate predictions over the entire tree to derive a consensus prediction for the family as a whole. In cases where
attributes are more restricted in their distribution in the family (for example, ligand recognition among G-protein coupled
receptors), inferences will be more circumspect, potentially
restricted to strict orthologs. Evolutionary and structural
clustering of proteins enables us to integrate these disparate
types of data and inference methods effectively, to identify
potential errors in database annotations and provide a platform to improve the accuracy of functional annotation
overall.
In addition to new methods developed by us for phylogenomic inference, PhyloFacts includes a number of standard
bioinformatics methods available publicly. To motivate the
need for protein functional classification integrating diverse

http://genomebiology.com/content/7/9/R83

methods and data in an evolutionary framework, we examine
the major classes of bioinformatics methods in turn, and discuss their different pros and cons. Methods designed for predicting the biological process(es) in which a protein
participates (for example, bioinformatics approaches such as
Phylogenetic Profiles [14] and Rosetta Stone [15], analysis of
DNA chip array data, and proteomics experiments such as
pull-down experiments, yeast two-hybrid data, and so on) are
clearly complementary, and will be included in future releases
of the PhyloFacts resource.

Database homolog search tools
Database homolog search tools (for example, BLAST, FASTA
[16], and so on) can be blindingly fast, but do not distinguish
between local matches and sequences sharing global similarity; they report a score or E-value measuring the significance
of the local match between a query sequence and sequences in
the database. This can lead to errors when annotations are
transferred in toto based on only local similarity. These pairwise sequence comparison methods of homolog detection
have also been shown to have limited effectiveness at recognizing remote homologs (distantly related sequences) [17].

Iterated homology search methods
Iterated homology search methods such as PSI-BLAST [10]
have been developed in recent years. These methods enable
larger numbers of sequences to be annotated functionally,
albeit with a potentially higher error rate due to divergence in
function from their common ancestor.

Domain-based annotation and protein structure
prediction
Domain-based annotation and protein structure prediction
libraries of profiles or hidden Markov models (HMMs) for
functional or structural domains (PFAM [18], SMART [19], or
Superfamily [20]) are particularly helpful when a homolog
search fails. There are two primary limitations of this
approach to functional annotation. First, these statistical
models of protein families and domains are typically designed
for sensitivity rather than specificity, and thus afford a fairly
coarse level of annotation. For example, the PFAM 7TM_1
HMM recognizes a variety of G-protein coupled receptors,
irrespective of their ligand specificity. Second, a protein's
function is a composite of all its constituent domains; thus,
even in cases where each of a protein's domains can be identified, the actual function of the protein may not be
elucidated.

Phylogenomic inference
Phylogenomic inference was originally designed to address
the problem of annotation transfer from paralogous rather
than orthologous genes through the construction and analysis
of phylogenetic trees overlaid with experimental data. This
approach has been shown to enable the highest accuracy in
prediction of protein molecular function [21-23], but inherent
technical and computational complexity has limited its use.

Prediction of protein localization

Classification to a protein family is enabled by HMM scoring.
Biologists can submit either nucleotide or amino acid
sequences in FASTA format; nucleotide sequences are first
translated into all six frames and analyzed separately. Batch
mode submission of up to five sequences is enabled. Results
are returned by e-mail, and allow users to select families for
more detailed classification of sequences to functional subfamilies based on scoring against subfamily HMMs (Figure
2). This functionality is available online [33].
PhyloFacts includes books focusing on specific protein families or classes. The largest of these series is the PhyloFacts
'Protein Structure Prediction' library, with 5,328 books, each
representing either a structural domain from the Astral database [34] or protein structures from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB [35]). This series enables biologists to obtain predicted
structures for submitted proteins. The books in the Protein
Structure Prediction library were created using individual
structural domains as seeds, gathering homologs from the NR
[36] database using PSI-BLAST or the UCSC SAM [37] software tools.
The second major book series in PhyloFacts is the 'Animal
Proteome Explorer' library, containing 4,226 protein families
in the human genome, expanded to include additional
homologs from other organisms. Specialized sections of the
Animal Proteome Explorer series are devoted to protein families of particular biomedical relevance: G-Protein Coupled
Receptors (65 books), Ion Channels (50 books), and Innate
Immunity (52 books). The Animal Proteome Explorer series
has been constructed using GHGCluster (see section 'Details
on Library Construction and Software Tools'). The GPCR
library includes books for protein families based on the classification of the GPCRDB [38].

These three main divisions are not strictly distinct, and there
are some overlaps. For instance, a book for the Toll Interleukin Receptor (TIR) domain (PhyloFacts book ID:

The 'Plant Disease Resistance Phylogenomic Explorer' forms
the third main series of specialized books in PhyloFacts,

proteins involved in defense signaling and effector proteins
from plant pathogens.

Slightly more than half of the books in the PhyloFacts
resource represent experimentally determined structural
domains; the remaining fraction is divided between global
homology groups (GHGs: globally alignable proteins having
the same domain structure), conserved regions, motifs, and
'Pending', a label for those books that have not passed the
stringent requirements for global homology and must be
manually examined. Each book is labeled with the book type
('domain', 'global homology', and so on) to enable appropriate
functional inferences. These labels are based primarily on
multiple sequence alignment analysis. See Table 1 for the
number of books within each class.

Each of the books in the library has a corresponding web page
[32] for viewing the associated annotation and experimental
data, MSA, trees, predicted domain structures, and so on
(Figure 1).

deposited research

As of 11 July 2006, the PhyloFacts encyclopedia contains
9,710 'books' for protein superfamilies and structural
domains. Each book in the PhyloFacts resource contains heterogeneous data for protein families, including a cluster of
homologous proteins, multiple sequence alignment, one or
more phylogenetic trees, predicted three-dimensional structures, predicted functional subfamilies, taxonomic distributions, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations [31], PFAM domains,
hyperlinks to key literature and other online resources, and
annotations provided by biologist experts. Residues conferring family and subfamily specificity are predicted using
alignment/evolutionary analyses; these patterns are plotted
on three-dimensional structures. HMMs constructed for each
family and subfamily enable classification of novel sequences
to different functional classes. Details on each aspect of the
resource construction are available in the 'Details on Library
Construction and Software Tools' section.

reviews

Prediction of protein localization is enabled by resources such
as the TMHMM [27] transmembrane prediction server, the
TargetP [28] cellular component prediction server, and the
PHOBIUS [29] integrated signal peptide and transmembrane
prediction server. These provide another perspective on a
protein's function, and can suggest participation in biological
pathways when other data are lacking. Because these methods can rely on fairly weak and non-specific signals (for example, hydrophobic stretches as indicators of membrane
localization), both false positive and false negative predictions are not uncommon [30].

Several attempts at identification of orthologs (for example,
Orthostrapper [24] and RIO [25]) and at automating phylogenomic inference of molecular function [26] have been presented, and may lead to more widespread application of this
approach.

PhyloFacts contains books of different structural types. Global homology group: sequences sharing the same domain architecture, aligned globally.
Domain: sequences sharing a common structural domain (defined experimentally), aligned only along that domain. Conserved regions: sequences
sharing a common region with no obvious homology to a solved structure, aligned along that region. Motifs: highly conserved amino acid signatures
typically <50 amino acids. Pending: all other books, including clusters produced by GHGCluster that did not pass the global homology group criteria

bpg002615) is placed in the Protein Structure Prediction
library (due to the presence of a solved structure for this family) as well as in the Innate Immunity and Plant Disease
Resistance libraries (since TIR domains are found in both
plant and animal proteins involved in eukaryotic innate
immunity).
Because our recommended protocol for protein function prediction starts with transfer of annotation from globally alignable orthologs (see section 'Functional annotation using
PhyloFacts'), a large number of books in PhyloFacts are designated as type Global Homology, and subjected to rigorous
quality control (see section 'Details on Library Construction
and Software Tools, Defining Book Type'). Standard protein
clustering tools typically ignore the issue of global sequence
similarity, so that even resources intending to cluster proteins
based on global similarity can occasionally fail (for example,
the Celera Panther resource [39] class Leucine-Rich Transmembrane Proteins [PTHR23154] contains proteins with
diverse domain structures; Additional data file 1). By contrast, most web servers for protein functional classification
provide primarily domain-level analyses (for example,
SMART and PFAM). To supplement these analyses, PhyloFacts also provides books for different types of structural similarities across sequences, including short conserved motifs
and structural domains.
PhyloFacts has other distinguishing features relative to other
online resources. In contrast to model organism databases
that are restricted to a single species (for example [40-43])
sequences in PhyloFacts are clustered into protein families
with potentially diverse phylogenetic distributions, enabling
biologists to benefit from experimental studies in related species. GO annotations and evidence codes are provided for
each subfamily separately as well as for the family as a whole.
Phylogenetic trees are constructed for each protein family,
using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods. Analysis of the full phylogenetic
tree topology, along with GO annotations and evidence codes,
allows biologists to avoid the systematic errors associated

with annotation transfer from top database hit. Protein structure prediction and domain analysis are presented to enable
biologists to take advantage of the unique information provided by protein structure studies. Simultaneous evolutionary and structural analyses enable us to predict enzyme active
sites and other types of key functional residues. HMMs for
each family and subfamily provide functional classification of
user-submitted sequences at different levels of a functional
hierarchy. This enables functional annotation that can be far
more specific than what is provided by typical protein family
or domain classification web servers. A detailed comparison
of PhyloFacts with some of the standard functional classification servers is presented in Table 2.
PhyloFacts currently includes almost 10,000 books providing
pre-calculated phylogenomic analyses for protein superfamilies and structural domains, and over 700,000 HMMs
enabling classification of user-submitted sequences to families and subfamilies. Between 64% and 82% of genes encoded
in different model organism genomes can be classified at least
at the domain level to one or more books in the PhyloFacts
resource (Table 3). PhyloFacts coverage is constantly increasing. We have currently completed clustering and expansion of
the human genome, resulting in 10,163 global homology
group clusters. Of these, approximately 3,969 clusters (representing 38% of human genes) have been installed in the PhyloFacts resource (although not all of them have passed the
stringent GHG requirements); remaining books are in various stages of completeness.

Functional annotation using PhyloFacts

In an ideal scenario, annotation transfer between a query and
homolog would meet three criteria [22]: first, global
homology; second, orthology [44]; and third, supporting
experimental evidence for the functional annotation being
transferred. In practice, confirming agreement at all three criteria is not always straightforward. Very few sequences have
experimentally solved structures; satisfaction of the first
condition is, therefore, typically determined by comparison of

their predicted domain structures using, for example, PFAM
or Conserved Domain [45] analysis, or by pairwise alignment
analysis. Automated determination of orthology is complicated due to incomplete sequencing, gene duplication and
loss, errors in gene structure and other issues; for a review see
[46]. Satisfying the last condition is equally difficult due to the
paucity of sequences with experimentally determined
function; our analysis of GO annotations and evidence codes
for over 370,000 sequences in the UniProt database [47]
shows <3% to have experimental evidence supporting a functional annotation. (This statistic is based on the analysis of
372,448 UniProt sequences present in the PhyloFacts
resource as of June 2005. Two-thirds of these (248,152) had
GO annotations, but only 3% of this smaller set had evidence
codes indicating experimental support: IDA (inferred from
direct assay), IGI (inferred from genetic interaction), IMP
(inferred from mutant phenotype), IPI (inferred from physical interaction), and TAS (traceable author statement).)
Books in the PhyloFacts resource are labeled by the level of
structural similarity across members (that is, global homology, domain, and so on), and include phylogenetic trees,
inferred subfamilies, and GO annotations and evidence codes
to enable a biologist to check for agreement at the three criteria for transferring annotations. In cases where a protein of
unknown function is placed in a global homology group with
an ortholog having experimentally determined function,
annotation transfer can proceed with high confidence. In
other cases, the biologist can check for experimentally determined function in paralogous genes (bearing in mind that
functions may have diverged), or at domain-based clusters, to
obtain clues to the molecular function for different regions of
a protein of interest. We attempt to accommodate all of these
possibilities; a sequence search against the resource may
match books representing global homology groups, structural
domains, conserved regions, or even short motifs, all of which
are presented to the user (Figure 2).
We note that while domain-based annotation is inherently
less precise, PhyloFacts does provide predicted functional
subfamilies within domain-based books as well as within
books representing global homology groups. While annotation transfer across proteins having different overall folds is
prone to systematic error, previous results suggest that subfamily classification of sequences aligned along a single common domain can be consistent with the overall domain
structure and molecular function of sequences [48]. Our

experiments using SCI-PHY to analyze proteins with different
overall domain structures also support the same conclusion
(unpublished data, Brown DP, Krishnamurthy N, Sjölander
K).
In addition to the value PhyloFacts presents to a human
investigator, it also provides a framework for the development of a fully automated functional inference system. A new
generation of probabilistic methods for inferring molecular
function automatically has arisen in recent years (for example, [26,49,50]). For instance, SIFTER uses a Bayesian
approach to infer a distribution over possible functions in a
phylogenetic tree, taking as input a cluster of sequences, a
phylogenetic tree, and GO annotations and evidence codes,
all of which PhyloFacts collects and integrates in one
resource. SIFTER integration is to be available in our next
release.
However, technical issues present barriers to the goal of fully
automated function prediction (see [51] for a review).
Sequences in a cluster may have different descriptors based
on the species of origin; for example, the Drosophila community is likely to use different names for a gene to that used by
the Caenorhabditis elegans community, and both are likely
to use different terms to those used by investigators working
in mouse genomics. The value of a standardized nomenclature, such as that being developed by GO, is obviously important, but significant work remains in this area. An exhaustive
thesaurus of equivalent biological terms would be valuable.
The sparse nature of experimentally supported molecular
functions provides an additional barrier to automated
approaches. We discuss these issues further in the section
'Challenges to phylogenomic inference'.
Clustering together proteins based on predictable global
homology enables us to analyze a cluster of homologs as a unit
and detect potential errors in annotation; database annotation errors tend to stand out as anomalous against a backdrop
of otherwise consistent annotations (unless, of course, annotation errors have percolated through the database).
For instance, the Oryza sativa GenBank protein AAR00644
is labeled as a 'putative LRR receptor-like protein kinase'. The
canonical structure of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) consists
of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain;
AAR00644 contains no kinase domain. On the other hand,

Figure 2 search results for
PhyloFacts(see previous page) ANDR_RAT, androgen receptor from Rattus norvegicus
PhyloFacts search results for ANDR_RAT, androgen receptor from Rattus norvegicus. Books with significant scores are displayed graphically at top,
followed by various statistics about each match in a table below. The top-scoring book (red bar) represents a global homology group of Androgen
receptors, which matches the entire query sequence. Examining the table below shows the Androgen receptor book has an E-value of 2.71e-162, 91%
identity between the query and book consensus (based on aligned residues), and high fractional coverage of the HMM (99%). Other global homology
groups retrieved include evolutionarily related Glucocorticoid and Progesterone receptors, but analysis of query coverage and percent identity shows the
Androgen receptor book to provide a superior basis for annotation transfer. Other books displayed include structural domains detected in the query.
Two books (for the ligand-binding domain 1kv6a and the DNA-binding domain 1dsza) were constructed for the Structure Prediction series based on
SCOP domains. Subsequent construction of the specialized book series on transmembrane receptors in the human genome resulted in additional books
being constructed for these domains. Scoring subfamily HMMs is enabled by selecting the 'Search subfamilies' box (second column in the spreadsheet of
results, shown checked in the figure), and clicking on the 'Go' button at bottom ('Search selected books for top-scoring subfamily HMMs against query').
Clicking on the 'Go' button below 'View alignment' in the first column brings up a separate page displaying the pairwise alignment of the query and the
family consensus sequence along with relevant statistics about the alignment. Clicking on the hyperlink to the book itself (in the 'PhyloFacts book' column)
retrieves the webpage for the family (see example book page shown in Figure 1).

AAR00644 does match the canonical structure of closely
related receptor-like proteins (RLPs), which are structurally
very similar to RLKs, except that they terminate with a short
cytoplasmic tail, and do not contain a kinase domain [52]. In
the PhyloFacts resource, this protein is classified as a member
of the global homology group book 'Plant LRR proteins (putative RLPs)' (PhyloFacts book ID: bpg005632), where PFAM
domain analysis of the cluster shows no detectable kinase
domains.
For a second example, the GenBank sequence AAF19052
labeled as 'neutral human sphingomyelinase' [53] appears to
be neither human nor a sphingomyelinase. Instead it appears
to encode a bacterial isochorismate synthase protein. This
sequence is classified to the PhyloFacts book 'Isochorismate
synthase-related' (Phylofacts book ID: bpg004927), in which
this purportedly 'human' sequence is the only representative
eukaryote. (Note that even the translated BLAST search of
this sequence against the human genome finds no matches.)
In this case, both domain structure analysis and analysis of
the taxonomic distribution of the globally homologous members of the family help identify the probable error.
Lastly, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) classification is
notoriously difficult, with many receptors having no known
ligand (termed 'orphan receptors'). One such orphan, a GPCR
from river lamprey (UniProt: Q9YHY4), is annotated as
'Putative odorant receptor LOR3', based on its expression in
the olfactory epithelium [54]. Standard profile/HMM-based
analyses (for example, PFAM, SMART and the NCBI CDD)
only match this protein to the PFAM 7TM_1 class, containing
dozens of subtypes. BLAST analysis shows other putative
odorant receptors from river lamprey (submitted by the same
authors) as top hits, followed by trace amine receptors. However, analyses of phylogenetic trees containing this sequence
show it (and the other putative odorant receptors detected by
BLAST) to be located within subtrees containing trace amine
receptors (see PhyloFacts books bpg004950, bpg000525 and
bpg000543) and to be quite different from experimentally
confirmed odorant receptors (Additional data file 2).

Anomalous annotations such as these are often signs that
annotation transfer has gone wrong. In other cases, anomalies may be quite real and provide new insights into the evolution of novel functions in a family. Automated anomaly
detection faces the same technical barriers as automated
functional annotation, including the need for probabilistic
inference of gene function, standardized nomenclatures and
exhaustive synonym tables of biological terms. At present,
these anomalies - whether true functional differences or database annotation errors - are detected manually. In the future
we expect automated function prediction methods will enable
anomalous annotations to be flagged for expert examination.
Protocols will then need to be established by the biological
community to correct any errors and to ensure that sequence
databases receive corrected annotations.

Details on resource construction and software
tools

Construction of the PhyloFacts resource required the development of a computational pipeline (shown in Figure 3), software for classifying user-submitted sequences, and graphical
user interfaces. These are outlined briefly below.

Clustering sequences for PhyloFacts books
Sequences for structural domain books were gathered using
PSI-BLAST and UCSC SAM Target-2K (T2K) [37]. Sequences
retrieved for global homology group books are required to
share the same overall domain structure (global alignment).
We have two tools for this process: FlowerPower (NK, Brown
D, KS, unpublished data) and GHGCluster.

FlowerPower
FlowerPower is an iterative homolog detection algorithm like
PSI-BLAST that retrieves homologs to a seed sequence (or
query) and aligns sequences using profile methods. However,
instead of using a single profile to identify and align new

Phylogenetic trees for single domains

This table compares the functionalities provided by PhyloFacts with those of standard functional classification resources for structural phylogenomic
analysis. PhyloFacts is the only online resource that enables structural phylogenomic inference of protein function, including clustering of sequences
into structural equivalence classes (that is, containing the same domain architecture), construction of phylogenetic trees, identification of functional
subfamilies, subfamily hidden Markov models and structure prediction. This differentiates PhyloFacts from other resources that almost exclusively
enable domain prediction (for example PFAM, Superfamily) and those such as TIGRFAMs that cluster full-length protein sequences but do not
integrate structural and phylogenomic analysis. Reported as of May 2006. *Although Panther asserts that its families contain globally alignable
sequences, this is not always the case (see additional data file 1 for details). †InterPro has defined parent/child relationships between some entries that
are considered equivalent of family/subfamily relationships. But these are not defined for every cluster. ‡Panther provides its own ontology terms
instead of the standard GO annotations. Links to the resources used for this comparison: PhyloFacts Resource [11]; Celera Genomics Panther

PhyloFacts whole-genome library construction pipeline
PhyloFacts whole-genome library construction pipeline. This figure represents our protocol for building global homology group protein family books. The
pipeline starts with clustering a target genome into global homology groups (GHGs; sequences sharing the same overall domain structure), and proceeding
through various stages of cluster expansion, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, retrieval of experimental data, a variety of
bioinformatics methods for predicting functional subfamilies, key residues, cellular localization, and so on, and quality control assessment.

genome) into global homology groups, while also including
homologs from a second, generally larger, database.
GHGCluster takes two inputs: a set of sequences Q, containing the sequences to be clustered, and a database D to use for
expanding the clusters to include globally alignable homologs
from other organisms. A superset of sequences, the expansion
database E, is created by merging Q and D. To improve run
time, E is partitioned into overlapping bins based on
sequence length. A seed sequence (query) is chosen from Q
and homologs are gathered from its corresponding bin in E,
using PSI-BLAST (E-value < 1e-5; user-specified number of

iterations). Each hit is assessed for global homology to the
query, based on percent identity (≥20%), and bi-directional
alignment coverage, that is the fractional aligned length of
both seed and hit (ranging from 60% for sequences <100 residues to 85% for sequences of >500 residues). In some cases,
PSI-BLAST returns multiple short aligned regions, none of
which is long enough to pass the above requirements. In these
cases, the failing hits are realigned to an HMM built from the
seed, followed by alignment analysis. The seed and any
accepted sequences are defined as a cluster and removed
from Q (but not E). A new seed is then chosen from Q and the
process is iterated until Q is empty.

Subfamily identification is provided using the SCI-PHY (Subfamily Classification In Phylogenomics) software [61]. SCIPHY is an automatic subfamily identification algorithm;
given an input MSA, SCI-PHY uses Dirichlet mixture densities [62] and relative entropy to construct a hierarchical tree,
and cuts the tree into subtrees to identify subfamilies using
minimum-description-length principles. Extensive studies
show SCI-PHY subfamilies correspond closely to both expertidentified subtypes and to conserved clades in phylogenetic
trees (unpublished data, Brown DP, Krishnamurthy N, Sjölander K). The SCI-PHY server is available online [63].

Multiple sequence alignment

To be defined as a 'Global Homology' book, a multiple
sequence alignment must meet the following criteria: first,
≤15% gap characters over the multiple sequence alignment;
second, ≤30% columns with BLOSUM62 [60] sum-of-pairs
scores < 0; third, difference between the longest and the
shortest sequence in the alignment <150 amino acids; and
fourth, all sequences align over ≥75% of their length. Books of
type 'Domain' were required to match a structural domain (as
determined by SCOP) or to correspond to a PDB structure.
Books labeled as 'Conserved Region' required global-local
alignment of sequences to the HMM (generally matching over
70% of the HMM match states). Most books labeled as 'Pending' are those that were produced by the GHGCluster program, but which failed the stringent 'Global Homology Group'
alignment quality control tests; the final classification of
these books to the different structural types is in progress.

deposited research

Our atomic unit in PhyloFacts clustering is the protein
sequence, independent of its origin. Consequently, splice and
allelic variants of a gene are not handled differently to genes
from entirely different species during clustering, alignment
and tree construction (although they would be interpreted
differently during a subsequent phylogenomic analysis using
the resource). If the variant retains the same domain structure and is globally alignable to other isoforms, it will be
included in the global homology group cluster for those
genes, otherwise it may end up in a different book in the
resource. It should be noted that the presence of different isoforms for a gene can cause difficulties in phylogenomic inference if their common genome locus is not evident. Future
releases of PhyloFacts will display this information and create
links between different gene isoforms present in different
books.

(PSI-BLAST or T2K). The method used is indicated in the
'Book Details' section at the bottom of each book page, under
'Build method notes'. Multiple sequence alignments for all
books (except those constructed to model solved threedimensional structures) are masked to remove columns with
>70% gaps prior to phylogenetic tree construction. Alignments are available for the family as a whole and for each subfamily; these can be downloaded or viewed using the Javabased Jalview software [59]. An annotated alignment, indicating SCI-PHY subfamily membership, is also available for

including average, minimum and maximum percent identity,
fraction of gap characters in the MSA, and other relevant
measurements.

comment

This procedure results in a set of clusters, some of which may
contain the same sequence(s). At this stage we merge
compatible overlapping clusters. We rank all pairs of clusters
by the number of sequences they have in common and
attempt to merge pairs in order. For each pair, we choose the
alignment with the greater number of aligned columns and
designate this as cluster A; the other cluster becomes B. We
build an HMM from the cluster A alignment and use the
COACH algorithm [56] to align the entire cluster B alignment
to this HMM (and therefore to cluster A). If the total fraction
of gap characters in the merged alignment (that is, no. of
gaps/(no. of sequences × no. of columns)) is less than 20%,
and the mean percent identity is greater than 20%, the merge
is accepted. Otherwise, if the alignment fails based on gap
content alone, we trim columns with >30% gaps from the
amino and carboxyl termini and reassess: the merge is
accepted if cluster sequences align at least 70% of their residues, on average, within the trimmed 'core' alignment and if
the core alignment contains >50% of the columns from the
merged alignment and <10% gaps. Note, this procedure is
computationally efficient, but can produce clusters that fail to
meet the criteria set for global homology group books. In
these cases, books are flagged for additional automated analysis and manual inspection in order to maintain quality
control.

unique SCOP folds comparing subfamily and family HMMs
show SHMMs to have high specificity in detecting functionally similar sequences and to improve the range of homolog
detection with significant scores (unpublished data, Brown
DP, Krishnamurthy N, Sjölander K).

Protein structure and domain prediction
PFAM domains are identified using the consensus sequence
for the family as a query using the PFAM gathering threshold
as a cutoff. Matches to PDB structures are predicted by
BLAST analysis of the family consensus sequence, using an Evalue cutoff of 0.001 (that is, protein structure prediction
based on inferred homology). Any putative homologous
structures were aligned to the family HMM using local-local
alignment (SAM parameter - sw 2). Transmembrane domains
and signal peptides are predicted using the PHOBIUS server
[29], selected due to its ability to differentiate between signal
peptides and transmembrane domains.

Phylogenetic tree construction and visualization
Because many of the protein superfamilies in the PhyloFacts
resource span extremes of evolutionary divergence (for example, with pairwise identities <20%), tree topologies produced
by different methods can often disagree. For this reason, most
of the protein families in the resource contain several phylogenetic trees built using different algorithms, enabling
biologists interested in these families to examine the differences and commonalities between the trees.

http://genomebiology.com/content/7/9/R83

Predicted critical residues
Residues appearing to be important based on analysis of conservation patterns across the family as a whole, or within SCIPHY subfamilies, are displayed under the header 'Predicted
critical residues'. Key functional residues for the family as a
whole are determined by multiple sequence alignment analysis. For each column c, we compute the log-odds of the positional conservation and the background conservation in the
MSA: log (Fc/F). Here, Fc is the frequency of the most frequent amino acid at column c, and F is the average value of Fc
over the multiple alignment. Subfamily-defining positions
are computed similarly, based on a cut of the MSA into subfamilies using the SCI-PHY algorithm, and then averaging
log-odds values across the subfamilies at each position. Positive log-odds values indicate higher-than-average conservation at a position, whereas log-odds values below zero reflect
conservation that is lower than average; the magnitude of the
log-odds gives a measure of the significance of the result.
Computing the log-odds instead of the conservation per se
enables us to differentiate truly informative positions from
those that only appear conserved due to limited sequence
divergence in the multiple alignment. Our default cutoffs for
coloring residues based on this analysis are 0.7 for family conservation and 0.07 for subfamily conservation; cutoffs can be
adjusted by the user. Conservation patterns are plotted on
protein three-dimensional structures for the family using an
interactive Java-based structure viewer, Jmol (Figure 5) [71].

Novel sequence classification
Neighbor-Joining trees are constructed using the PHYLIP
software [66], using the default parameters for 'protdist' and
'neighbor' (JTT model [67] and no variation of rates). Maximum Likelihood trees are estimated using the PHYML software [68], also using the JTT model, four substitution rate
categories, and a gamma-distributed model of rates (gamma
= 1), and are set to optimize tree topology only. Maximum
Parsimony trees are estimated using the PAUP* software
[69], by taking an extended majority rule consensus of the
most parsimonious trees obtained via ten repetitions of heuristic tree search. All trees are rooted using the midpoint
method. As of 4 July 2006, of the 9,707 books in the library,
8,511 have at least one true phylogenetic tree constructed, and
3,613 have NJ, ML and MP trees. All books have had SCI-PHY
subfamily analyses completed, and will eventually include
Neighbor-Joining (including bootstrap values), Maximum
Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony trees.

Classification to a protein family is enabled by HMM scoring.
Since HMM scoring is computationally intensive and the PhyloFacts resource contains almost 10,000 books (each containing a family HMM and potentially dozens of subfamily
HMMs), we provide heuristic approaches enabling rapid classification of user-submitted sequences. For computational
efficiency, we select books for HMM scoring via BLAST analysis of the submitted query against a dataset of over 2.5 million PhyloFacts training sequences using an E-value cutoff of
10; this significantly reduces the number of HMM scores
required without affecting sensitivity. Users can override this
'BLAST pre-screen' protocol using the 'Advanced' settings
page. Books retrieved based on either protocol can then be
selected for scoring the submitted sequence(s) against
subfamily HMMs for additional specificity of functional
classification.

Phylogenetic trees are displayed using ATV, a Java-based tree
viewer [70]. Users can view any of the standard trees pre-estimated for the family or subtrees corresponding to SCI-PHY
subfamilies. Phylogenetic trees can also be downloaded in
NHX format. To facilitate a comparison with SCI-PHY subfamilies, the nodes in the phylogenetic trees containing
sequences from a single SCI-PHY subfamily are annotated
with the SCI-PHY subfamily number and annotation (Figure
4).

Future work

In future releases of the PhyloFacts resource we plan to
include automated predictions of protein function using the
SIFTER software. SIFTER will be used to provide predicted
molecular functions and participation in biological processes
for SCI-PHY subfamilies as well as for conserved evolutionary
clades. Links between proteins, or between books, will be provided, to reflect the many types of relationships (for example,

Key residue prediction using SCI-PHY subfamily-specific and family-wide conservation patterns. Shown above is the PDB structure for the Pyrococcus

functional residues. Residues colored yellow are conserved within both subfamilies and across the family as a whole. Positions conserved only within
individual subfamilies but not across the family are colored dark blue. Positions having sufficient conservation across the family, but potentially variable
within one or more subfamilies are colored light blue. These conservation patterns are predicted for each book in the PhyloFacts resource; where
homologous PDB structures can be identified, these patterns are plotted on the structure. Users can modify cutoffs for determining significance using the

be able to retrieve comparative (homology) models for
selected proteins from the ModBase resource [72] through
hyperlinks on book pages. Literature will be retrieved automatically for sequences in a book, and natural language

We will expand the resource for improved coverage of key

melanogaster), and to keep our protein structure prediction
library current. We plan to reduce redundancy in the library
by combining books with significant sequence overlap. We
will develop software tools to identify and include new family
members as well as new experimental data (for example, the
availability of solved structures, results from site-directed
mutagenesis, protein-protein interactions, and so on). We
will also include extensions to the subfamily HMM scoring
protocol to differentiate between sequences representing a

novel subtype and those that can be classified to the top-scoring subfamily (based on logistic regression analysis). Phylogenetic trees for each family will be extended to include strict
consensus trees across two or more methods, and bootstrap
analysis will be provided for Neighbor Joining trees. Finally,
we plan to provide community annotation tools to enable
biologists to upload their data, commentaries and hyperlinks
to experimental data for members of protein families.

Challenges to phylogenomic inference

Phylogenomic analysis of protein function is known to
improve the accuracy of functional annotation, but has had
restricted application due to its technical complexity. The
PhyloFacts resource enables biologists who may have limited
bioinformatics expertise to take advantage of pre-computed
phylogenomic analyses for hundreds of thousands of proteins. New sequences can be classified to families and subfamilies using over 700,000 hidden Markov models, for
increased functional specificity. The resource as a whole

Finally, assessing annotation accuracy is a very labor-intensive practice. Biological curators can spend days analyzing
and annotating a single gene; to do this in high-throughput
for thousands of sequences is clearly not feasible. An additional complication is that definitions of molecular 'function'

deposited research

One of the fundamental questions in phylogenomic inference
of protein function is determining the evolutionary distance
within which annotations may be transferred. Given the paucity of sequences with experimentally determined function, if
annotations can only be transferred between orthologs (and
are also restricted to annotations having experimental support), the vast majority of unknown sequences will remain
without predicted function. Is this necessary or overkill?
Analysis of different types of 'function' associated with proteins show that some types of attributes (for example, catalytic activity) persist over large evolutionary distances, while
in other cases (for example, substrate specificity), functions
can diverge extremely rapidly. Moreover, the degree to which
different types of function persist over evolutionary distance
can vary from one family to another. One intriguing possibility for the next generation of phylogenomic inference
methods involves identifying attribute-specific evolutionary
distances over which attributes may percolate.

Additional data files

reports

Other challenges to automating functional annotation
through phylogenomics methods include: the lack of a
standardized nomenclature for gene names across different
model organisms, although the GO consortium efforts are
making progress in this respect; natural structural and
sequence divergence among family members causing difficulties in clustering; ensuring multiple sequence alignment
accuracy when divergently related sequences are included in
a cluster; and the persistence of database annotation errors.
Database annotation errors should be correctable at the
source, so that the primary sequence repositories (GenBank,
UniProt, and so on) can be kept current.

or 'subfunction' are not at all standardized within biology.
Instead, some biologists use the term 'function' very specifically (see for example, [3]) while others may use the term
more loosely. Assessing annotation accuracy, and comparing
the relative effectiveness of different function prediction protocols, also requires judgment calls regarding definitions of
correctness. An annotation may be technically correct, but at
such a high level that it is minimally helpful. For instance, a
novel gene may be labeled as 'putative membrane protein',
'putative GPCR' and 'putative chemokine receptor'. If experimental studies show the protein to be a chemokine receptor,
then only the third annotation would be particularly helpful
to biologists, although all annotations would be technically
correct. In other cases, an annotation may be technically
incorrect, although quite close, due to annotation transfer
from a paralog with a slightly different functional specificity
(for example, Serotonin receptor type 1 versus Serotonin
receptor type 2). Critically, there is also no communityaccepted benchmark dataset or scoring function to evaluate
methods of protein functional classification. These need to be
developed to enable computational biologists to determine
what types of inference methods are robust under what conditions, and where our methods fail. Efforts to develop true de
novo function prediction efforts, analogous to the biennial
CASP protein structure prediction experiments, are underway [73], and are likely to play an important role in improving
our understanding of method accuracy in this important area.

reviews

Phylogenetic uncertainty and ambiguity remain significant
challenges to phylogenomic inference of molecular function.
Consensus analysis can be used to detect clades with support
across two or more tree methods, but this approach could
inadvertently be misleading if inherent biases in the methods
are not taken into account. It is critical that the computational
biology community and the systematics community work
together to develop methods to assess the expected accuracy
of phylogenetic methods for protein superfamily reconstruction; new simulation studies should be developed that model
the kinds of structural and functional changes observed in
protein superfamily evolution.

Krishnamurthy et al. R83.15

comment

brings together many different types of bioinformatics analyses and data; the integration of these data and improved
orthology determination enables biologists to avoid making
new annotation errors at the outset, and to detect, and possibly correct, existing annotation errors.
