Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses of the Annonaceae consistently identify four clades: a basal
clade consisting of Anaxagorea, and a small 'ambavioid' clade that is sister to two main clades, the
'long branch clade' (LBC) and 'short branch clade' (SBC). Divergence times in the family have
previously been estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS) and penalized likelihood
(PL). Here we use an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock in BEAST to
estimate diversification times of the main clades within the family with a focus on the Asian genus
Pseuduvaria within the SBC. Two fossil calibration points are applied, including the first use of the
recently discovered Annonaceae fossil Futabanthus. The taxonomy and morphology of Pseuduvaria
have been well documented, although no previous dating or biogeographical studies have been
undertaken. Ancestral areas at internal nodes within Pseuduvaria are determined using dispersalvicariance analysis (DIVA) and weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA).
Results: The divergence times of the main clades within the Annonaceae were found to deviate
slightly from previous estimates that used different calibration points and dating methods. In
particular, our estimate for the SBC crown (55.2-26.9 Mya) is much younger than previous
estimates (62.5-53.1 ± 3.6 Mya and ca. 58.76 Mya). Early diversification of Pseuduvaria was estimated
to have occurred 15-8 Mya, possibly associated with the 'mid-Miocene climatic optimum.'
Pseuduvaria is inferred to have originated in Sundaland in the late Miocene, ca. 8 Mya; subsequent
migration events were predominantly eastwards towards New Guinea and Australia, although
several migratory reversals are also postulated. Speciation of Pseuduvaria within New Guinea may
have occurred after ca. 6.5 Mya, possibly coinciding with the formation of the Central Range
orogeny from ca. 8 Mya.
Conclusion: Our divergence time estimates within the Annonaceae are likely to be more precise
as we used a UCLD clock model and calibrated the phylogeny using new fossil evidence. Pseuduvaria
is shown to have dispersed from Sundaland after the late Miocene. The present-day paleotropical
distribution of Pseuduvaria may have been achieved by long-distance dispersal, and speciation events
might be explained by global climatic oscillations, sea level fluctuations, and tectonic activity.

Background
The Annonaceae are a large pantropical family of flowering plants, consisting of ca. 135 genera and ca. 2,500 species in predominantly tropical and subtropical lowland
forests [1]. The phylogeny of the family has previously
been reconstructed based on morphological [2-4] and
molecular data [5-7]. Four main clades are consistently
recognised in the molecular analyses: two of these clades
(consisting of Anaxagorea and the small 'ambavioid'
clade) form a heterogeneous basal grade, basal to two
large clades known as the 'long branch clade' (LBC) and
'short branch clade' (SBC) to reflect differing rates of
nucleotide substitutions [7,8].
Evolutionary divergence times based on molecular data
have been estimated for the Annonaceae as a whole [5,7]
as well as for several individual genera and clades, including Anaxagorea [9], 'Andean-centred' genera in the SBC
[8], Guatteria [10], and an African clade including Isolona
and Monodora [11]. These studies were based on between
two and five commonly used chloroplast regions (matK,
trnL-F, trnT-L, rbcL, and psbA-trnH spacer). Comparatively
few fossil calibration points were used in these studies due
to the scarcity of unequivocal Annonaceae fossils. The
most widely applied calibration point is the stem age of
the Magnoliaceae, based on the fossil Archaeanthus from
North America, which either provides a minimum age of
98 Mya in the early Cenomanian [12], or 100 Mya in the
late Albian [13]. Other possible calibration points
include: 68 Mya for the split between the ambavioids and
the combined LBC-SBC clade, derived using Anonaspermum seeds from Nigeria [14]; 112 Mya for the split
between the Eupomatiaceae and Annonaceae, using the
fossil Endressinia [15]; and 120 Mya for core Magnoliales,
based on Aptian granular monosulcate pollen [16]. In
addition, secondary calibration points have been derived
from earlier studies of divergence times, including 82 Mya
[17] and 90.93 Mya (unpublished estimate by M.D. Pirie)
for the stem of the Annonaceae. Richardson et al. [7]have
accordingly estimated the Annonaceae stem age at 90.6 ±
1.3 Mya, based on three calibration points [7]. The age
estimates for the family have enabled significant palaeobiogeographical insight, although the most important work
has focused on dispersal patterns in Africa and South
America (western Gondwana) since the genera studied
were largely neotropical.
The program r8s [18] has been widely adopted in studies
of divergence times in the Annonaceae [7,9,10]. This program incorporates both non-parametric rate smoothing
(NPRS) methods and penalized likelihood (PL) methods.
NPRS methods estimate ages through a smoothing criterion [19], whereas PL is a semiparametric approach [20]
that combines parametric methods with the robustness of
non-parametric methods. Other dating methods utilized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/153

in studies of the Annonaceae [21] include PAML [22] and
MULTIDIVTIME [23], based on Bayesian dating methods.
BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees)
[24] is the only software that simultaneously co-estimates
phylogeny, node ages and substitution rates. BEAST has
recently been used to estimate the origins of the East African lineages within the Annonaceae [11].
The present study focuses on the palaeotropical genus
Pseuduvaria, which is nested within the SBC. The genus
consists of 56 species of trees and treelets (inclusive of
Craibella phuyensis, which has recently been shown to be
congeneric with Pseuduvaria [25,26], and three newly
described species [26]). A comprehensive monograph of
the genus has been completed [27] and the phylogeny of
Pseuduvaria has been inferred using five chloroplast
regions [25]. The genus was previously estimated to have
evolved at least ca. 16 Mya ago based upon a published
chronogram [7], although this may not represent the true
age of the genus since the study included only five Pseuduvaria species (inclusive of C. phuyensis).
The Malesian phytogeographical region is separated into
two main subregions by Huxley's line and Wallace's line
(Figure 1: [28]): western Malesia, which includes Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Palawan; and
eastern Malesia, which includes Sulawesi, the Lesser
Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. Borneo
and New Guinea represent the two most important centres of plant species richness and endemism within
Malesia [29]. Pseuduvaria is widely distributed from Indochina to New Guinea and NE Australia (Figure 1, inset),
with the main centre of diversity in New Guinea (with 20
species) and a secondary centre in Peninsular Malaysia
(with 16 species, including three recently described species) [26]. In an earlier molecular phylogenetic study of
Pseuduvaria, five clades were recognized, with the three
basal clades occurring in the western Malesia [25]. A continuous land mass connecting Indochina, Thailand,
Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java (collectively known as Sundaland) was formed during the Early
Mesozoic [30], separated from the Australian-New
Guinea plate by a major ocean barrier. The collision
between the Asian and New Guinea land masses during
the Cenozoic may have promoted the dispersal of Pseuduvaria species from Sundaland to New Guinea. The present
paper aims to use molecular dating techniques to test
whether this biogeographical hypothesis is supported by
evidence of past geological events.
We use Bayesian molecular dating techniques in BEAST to
estimate the divergence times of major Annonaceae clades
(including the date of origin of Pseuduvaria as well as
clades within Pseuduvaria). Five chloroplast DNA regions,
psbA-trnH spacer, trnL-F, matK, rbcL and atpB-rbcL spacer,

were used in all analyses. The divergence times of major
Annonaceae clades were estimated using a dataset ('matrix
A') with a broad taxonomic sampling across the basal
grade, LBC and SBC of the Annonaceae, together with representatives of related families in the Magnoliales. Two
fossil calibration points were used to date the divergence
times within the Annonaceae: the fossil Archaeanthus [12],
providing a minimum age of 98 Mya for the stem of the
Magnoliaceae (J.A. Doyle, pers. comm.); and the Late Cretaceous fossil Futabanthus, providing a minimum age of
89 Mya for the split between Anaxagorea and the combined ambavioid-LBC-SBC clade [31]. The ages of clades
within Pseuduvaria were subsequently estimated using a
smaller dataset ('matrix B') that included all Pseuduvaria
species available (54 species) and selected members of the

SBC. The age estimates inferred from BEAST analyses
using matrix A were used as prior information in the subsequent analyses using matrix B. An additional objective
was to identify the most likely biogeographical origin of
Pseuduvaria, and to infer subsequent dispersal patterns
using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) [32] and
weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA) [33].

Methods
Taxon sampling and sequence data
We used two separate datasets: matrix A (for higher-level
analyses) and matrix B (for species-level analyses within
Pseuduvaria). Both sets of analyses were based on chloroplast DNA sequences from five regions (psbA-trnH spacer,
trnL-F, matK, rbcL and atpB-rbcL spacer). The materials and

consisted of 69 taxa, with 54 Pseuduvaria species. The
selection of outgroups was based on the phylogeny generated by BEAST using matrix A (Figure 2A). The SBC genera
selected as outgroups were Alphonsea, Haplostichanthus,
Miliusa, Monocarpia, Neo-uvaria, Orophea, Polyalthia, and
Sapranthus, representing 15 species.

Matrix A comprised a total of 83 species. The ingroup
included 22 of the total 56 Pseuduvaria species, representing all five main clades identified in our previous phylogenetic study [25], and 56 species from 46 different
Annonaceae genera (inclusive of the basal grade, LBC and
SBC). The outgroups included were Coelocaryon preussii

tar), and aligned manually using BioEdit ver. 7.09 [34]
and Se-Al ver. 2.0a11 [35]. Ambiguously aligned positions
were excluded from the analyses. The combined fiveregion data sets in matrices A and B are composed of 4860
and 4361 characters, respectively (see Table 1 for data on
individual gene regions).
Divergence time estimation
MrModelTest ver. 2.3 [36] was used to determine the
appropriate DNA substitution model and gamma rate heterogeneity using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
For both matrices, MrModelTest was performed for each
gene region and combined regions (Table 1). For the combined five chloroplast DNA regions in matrices A and B,
the GTR+I+G was determined as the best-fitting statistical
model.

The tree topology, node ages and substitution rates were
simultaneously estimated using a Bayesian MCMC
(Markov chain Monte Carlo) approach as implemented in
BEAST ver. 1.4.8 [24,37]. For matrix A analyses, exponential priors were selected for the two calibration points (see
discussion below): the Archaeanthus calibration used 98
Mya (labelled C1 in Figure 2A) as zero offset, with an
exponential mean of 1; and the Futabanthus calibration
used 89 Mya (labelled C2 in Figure 2A) as zero offset, with
an exponential mean of 1. A Yule speciation tree prior was
furthermore specified; this prior has been recommended
for species-level phylogenies, and assumes a constant rate
of speciation per lineage [24]. An uncorrelated lognormal
distributed relaxed clock (UCLD) model was employed,
which allows evolutionary rates to vary along branches
within lognormal distributions [38]. The five chloroplast
regions were partitioned (see Table 1 for the different
models of substitution), allowing the incorporation of
different models of substitution for each gene independently; the xml input file based on matrix A was edited
manually for gene region partition following the tutorial
by T.L.P. Couvreur [11,39].
Two independent MCMC runs were performed, each run
of 50 million generations, with sampling every 5000 gen-

erations. The two separate runs were then combined (following the removal of 10% burn-in) using LogCombiner
ver. 1.4.8 [24,37]. Adequate sampling and convergence of
the chain to stationary distribution were confirmed by
inspection of MCMC samples using Tracer ver. 1.4 [40].
The effective sample size (ESS) values of all parameters
were greater than 200, which was considered a sufficient
level of sampling. The sampled posterior trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator ver. 1.4.8 [24,37] to generate a maximum clade credibility tree (maximum posterior
probabilities) and calculate the mean ages, 95% highest
posterior density (HPD) intervals, posterior probabilities
(PP) and substitution rates for each node. The BEAST
topology (Figure 2A) was visualized with FigTree ver. 1.2
[41]. The MCMC analysis based on matrix A was also performed without sequence data; the prior distribution can
therefore be compared with the posterior distribution in
order to examine the influence of the data and prior,
showing that the results are not influenced by the chosen
priors alone [38].
The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of
Monocarpia and Pseuduvaria inferred from the MCMC runs
of matrix A were used as prior information in the subsequent BEAST analyses using matrix B in order to estimate
the divergence times within Pseuduvaria lineages. A normal probability distribution was employed as priors for
matrix B analyses, since the 95% HPD intervals from previous estimation (based on matrix A) can also be accommodated as uncertainty for this analysis. The normal
probability distribution is thought to reflect uncertainty in
secondary calibration points [11,42,43]. Normal distribution priors were therefore applied to calibration points at
two nodes: the MRCA of Monocarpia, with a mean age of
23 Mya and a standard deviation of 3.78 Mya (labelled C3
in Figure 3); and the MRCA of Pseuduvaria, with a mean
age of 8 Mya and a standard deviation of 1.64 Mya
(labelled C4 in Figure 3). The xml input file based on
matrix B was edited manually for partitioned chloroplast
sequence data. A UCLD model with Yule speciation tree
prior was employed. Two independent MCMC runs of 30
million generations were performed, with sampling every

3000 generations. The two separate runs were then combined (following removal of 10% burn-in) using LogCombiner ver. 1.4.8 [24,37]. The runs were checked for
convergence using Tracer ver. 1.4 [40], and the ESS values
of all parameters shown to be greater than 500, which was
considered sufficient. The BEAST topology (Figure 3) was
summarized and visualized as described above.

genus Anaxgaorea; the lack of inner staminodes is therefore possibly synapomorphic for the rest of the Annonaceae (plesiomorphic in Anaxagorea). We set Futabanthus
as a minimum age constraint of 89 Mya for the split
between Anaxagorea and the combined ambavioid-LBCSBC clade (i.e., the crown age of the Annonaceae, labelled
as C2 in Figure 2A).

Fossil calibrations
The most commonly used calibration point in previous
studies of the Annonaceae has been the fossil Archaeanthus [7,8] which provides an age of 98 Mya for the stem of
the Magnoliaceae. Other calibration points previously
employed for the Annonaceae are 120 Mya for the node
of the core Magnoliales using the pollen fossil Lethomasites
[9], 112 Mya for the split between the Eupomatiaceae and
Annonaceae using the Endressinia fossil [15], and 68 Mya
for the common ancestor of the ambavioids and combined LBC-SBC clade using the Maastrichtian seed genus
Anonaspermum from Nigeria and Sierra Leone [14].

Previous dating studies furthermore utilized secondary
calibration points that were extracted from earlier estimates, viz.: the age of 82 Mya for the stem of the Annonaceae based on Wikström et al. [17] using the NPRS
method [7,10]; and the age of 90.93 Mya for the stem of
the Annonaceae based on unpublished estimations by
M.D. Pirie. Secondary calibration points generated by
these previous Annonaceae studies were avoided as a different molecular dating method and calibration points
were employed in this study.

Lethomasites was not used in the present study since its
placement within the Magnoliales is doubtful [5]. The
inclusion of Lethomasites would also require broader taxonomic sampling of other families within the Magnoliales
(including Degeneriaceae and Himantandraceae), and the
large resultant dataset would require considerably longer
computational time. The Endressinia fossil was not reliable
as its relationship with the Eupomatiaceae is doubtful
[11]. The Anonaspermum seeds were similarly avoided as
calibration points in the present study as the position of
this fossil within the Annonaceae is uncertain [44].
The inclusion of a greater number of fossil calibration
points can reduce bias and result in more accurate age estimates, assuming that the chosen points are mutually consistent [45]. The fossil record of the Annonaceae is very
limited, however, and only two fossils, Archaeanthus and
Futabanthus, were regarded as sufficiently reliable. The
phylogenetic position of Archaeanthus [12] appears to be
reliable as it shares several characters with the Magnoliaceae, including distinctive stipules, elongated receptacle and fruits with numerous follicles [5,11,12]. The
phylogenetic position of the recently discovered Late Cretaceous fossil flower, Futabanthus asamigawaensis [31], is
similarly reliable as it shares many morphological similarities with the Annonaceae, including hermaphroditic,
hypogynous flowers with six tepals in two whorls of three,
an androecium consisting of numerous stamens with flattened connectives that extend above the thecae, and a gynoecium of numerous free carpels. Takahashi et al. [[31]:
914] postulated that Futabanthus has "a position within
crown-group Annonaceae, perhaps as sister or near the
base of all extant taxa except Anaxagorea." Inner staminodes are absent in Futabanthus but are present in the basal

Historical biogeography
Ancestral biogeographical areas occupied by Pseuduvaria
were inferred using two methods: dispersal-vicariance
analysis (DIVA) [32] and weighted ancestral area analysis
(WAAA) [33]. Eight main biogeographical areas represented in the current distributions of Pseuduvaria species
were used for the ancestral area reconstructions (Figure 1):
(A) southern China, Indochina, Thailand, Burma, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra; (B) Java and Bali; (C) Borneo and Palawan (identified as a single biogeographical
unit following [46]); (D) Philippines (excluding Palawan); (E) Sulawesi; (F) New Guinea and the Moluccas;
(G) Australia; and also the outgroup distribution (H)
India and Sri Lanka (not shown in Figure 1). Species distribution data were derived from our monograph of
Pseuduvaria [27].

DIVA was implemented using ver. 1.2 of the program
[32], in which ancestral distributions are inferred by minimizing the number of dispersal and extinction events.
DIVA assumes vicariance is the default mode of speciation, thus it does not assign a cost for vicariance but
counts steps for dispersal and extinction events. The tree
topology resulting from the BEAST analyses based on
matrix B was used as DIVA requires a fully resolved tree.
The sister clade with four species (Neo-uvaria acuminatissima, Neo-uvaria parallelivenia, Polyalthia coffeoides and
Polyalthia longifolia) was also included in the biogeographical analysis. The geographical distributions estimated for
internal nodes were optimized by constraining the maximum number of unit areas to two, hence restricting the
number of unit areas in ancestral distributions.
WAAA estimates ancestral areas using reversible parsimony, and weights areas in plesiomorphic branches more
than apomorphic branches [33]. Probability indices (PI)

were calculated for each area at each node by counting the
number of weighted gain steps (GSW) and weighted loss
steps (LSW) on the cladogram resulting from the BEAST
analyses (also based on matrix B). The PI is the ratio of
LGW and LSW; biogeographical areas with a value of less
than 0.2 are not considered as part of the ancestral area.

geneity across the tree and that a relaxed clock model is
most appropriate [47].
The BEAST chronogram (Figure 2A) is composed of four
major clades: Anaxagorea (sister to all other members of
the Annonaceae); a clade consisting of Cananga, Cleistopholis, Cyathocalyx and Tetrameranthus; the long branch clade
(LBC); and the short branch clade (SBC). Each of these
clades received strong statistical support (Table 2: PP =
1.00). BEAST analyses based on matrix A gave an estimated tMRCA for Pseuduvaria of 8.0 Mya (95% HPD:
11.5-5.0 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 20). The MCMC
result of the posterior distribution for the tMRCA of
Pseuduvaria (Table 2: node 20) is shifted ca. 44 Mya later,
indicating that the sequence data strongly influences date
estimation.

Results
Phylogeny and age estimations
The BEAST analyses of matrix A resulted in a robust phylogeny of the Annonaceae (Figure 2A), which is largely
consistent with the topologies of previous phylogenetic
analyses [7] and unpublished phylogenies using MrBayes
(based on two and seven genes: L.W. Chatrou, pers.
comm.). The mean ages of major nodes, with 95% HPD
intervals and Bayesian PP values, are indicated in the
chronogram (Figure 2A) and Table 2. The mean rate of
evolution is 0.0006 substitutions per site per million years
(95% HPD: 5.23E-4-7.10E-4). The 'birth rate' (i.e., speciation rate) indicated by the Yule prior is 0.041 (95% HPD:
0.031–0.052). The coefficient of variation is 0.69 (95%
HPD: 0.56–0.84), indicating that substitution rate hetero-

The BEAST analyses of matrix B generated a well-resolved
phylogeny of Pseuduvaria. The mean ages, 95% HPD intervals and Bayesian PP values of all nodes within Pseuduvaria, are indicated in the chronogram (Figure 3) and

Pseuduvaria is segregated into five clades (Figure 3: clades

Pseuduvaria is largely consistent with those resulting from
earlier ML and Bayesian analyses [[25]: Figure 3].

Both DIVA and WAAA indicate that the most likely ancestral area for Pseuduvaria was Sundaland (Figure 4: node 4).
Diversification of Pseuduvaria within Sundaland gave rise
to clades I, II and III. The inferred ancestral area of the
combined clade IV-V was ambiguous, however (Figure 4:
node 20): DIVA indicated that the ancestral area was
either New Guinea, Borneo-New Guinea, or PhilippinesNew Guinea; whereas WAAA suggested that it was either
New Guinea (with the highest PI of 1.13; Table 3) or the

occurred from New Guinea to western Malesia, as evident
in one species (P. reticulata).

The inferred ancestral area for the common ancestor of
clade IV (Figure 4: node 21) is also ambiguous. DIVA indicated the inferred distribution was either the Philippines,
Borneo-Philippines, or Philippines-New Guinea; whereas
WAAA indicated that the Philippines was the most probable ancestral area, with the highest PI of 1.70 (Table 3).
Within clade IV, a series of dispersal events could have
occurred between Borneo and the Philippines, and also
possibly between the Philippines and New Guinea. Furthermore, reverse westwards movements of Pseuduvaria
from Borneo and/or the Philippines can also be inferred
(Figure 4: node 28), as shown by the distribution of two
species, P. latifolia and P. parvipetala, in Java and Sumatra.

Discussion
Historical biogeography of major Annonaceae clades
The divergence times within the Annonaceae differ
slightly from previous age estimates based on NPRS and
PL methods as implemented in r8s (see Table 2). Our
results are comparable, however, with previous BEAST
analyses: the Isolona-Monodora clade is dated at 13.9 Mya
(95% HPD: 24.3-4.4 Mya; Figure 2A: node 13) in this
study, consistent with estimates of ca. 14 Mya in a previous study using BEAST [11].

The DIVA and WAAA results were congruent regarding the
inferred ancestral distribution of clade V, both indicating

Previous studies have suggested that the Annonaceae are
likely to have originated in western Gondwana [7,9]. The
break-up of the Gondwanan supercontinent into western
Gondwana (Africa and South America) and eastern Gondwana (Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India) began
180-150 Mya [48,49], but it was not until 90-85 Mya that
the two became fully separated [50]. Biotic interchange
between South America and Africa had essentially ceased
by the latter half of the Late Cretaceous (80-65 Mya)
[48,49], although it has been suggested that limited connection between the two continents was possible for
sometime afterwards via the island chains of the Rio
Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge and Sierra Leone Rises [51]. The
earliest divergence in the Annonaceae appears to have
occurred between 98.0 Mya (95% HPD: 101.5-94.9 Mya;
Figure 2A: node 1) and 89.5 Mya (Figure 2A: calibrated
node C2 at a minimum age of 89 Mya for the oldest
known crown group fossil, Futabanthus), probably after
the separation of the two landmasses.
Anaxagorea is shown to be sister to all other members of
the Annonaceae. The age of the split between the CanangaCyathocalyx-Cleistopholis-Tetrameranthus clade and the
combined LBC-SBC clade is estimated at 74.7 Mya (95%
HPD: 84.4-63.6 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 2). In
previous studies this node has been used as a minimum
age constraint of 68 Mya. The split age estimated here may
correspond to the origin of seeds of the Anonaspermum
type, and our results furthermore indicate that the age of
this node could be older than 68 Mya. The tMRCA of the
Cananga-Cyathocalyx-Cleistopholis-Tetrameranthus clade is
estimated at 41.8 Mya (95% HPD: 62.4-22.3 Mya, PP =
1.00; Figure 2A: node 4). The genera in this clade are currently distributed in geographically disparate regions:
Cananga occurs in Southeast Asia and Australia [52]; Cyathocalyx in Southeast Asia, extending east to Fiji [53,54];
Cleistopholis in Africa [52]; and Tetrameranthus in South
America [55]. The ancestors of this clade may have dispersed between Africa, Asia and South America from 74.7
Mya (95% HPD: 84.4-63.6 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A:
node 2) to 41.8 Mya (95% HPD: 62.4-22.3 Mya, PP =
1.00; Figure 2A: node 4). This disjunct distribution may
have been the result of Eocene and early Oligocene cooling [7,56].
The LBC and SBC constitute over 90% of all Annonaceae
genera. The age of the split between the LBC and SBC lineages is estimated at 67.3 Mya (95% HPD: 78.1-55.2 Mya,
PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 3), and the mean tMRCA of the
LBC at 59.6 Mya (95% HPD: 70.5-48.1 Mya, PP = 1.00;
Figure 2A: node 6). The ancestors of the majority of LBC
genera (Guatteria-Asimina) appear to have evolved ca. 51.5
Mya (95% HPD: 62.8-40.3 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A:
node 8). These genera are mainly distributed in South
America and Africa, although several occur in Asia, includ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/153

ing Artabotrys, Goniothalamus, Uvaria and Xylopia; this suggests that the LBC originated in South America and/or
Africa-Madagascar [[5]: Figure 5]. The wide geographical
distribution of boreotropical taxa could be associated
with the combined effects of plate tectonics and global climatic changes. The warming period during the late Paleocene-early Eocene thermal maximum, which peaked
around the early Eocene Climatic Optimum (52-50 Mya)
[57], may have promoted the northward dispersal of tropical plants [51]. This coincides with the suggested date for
the clade consisting of all members (node 8) of the LBC
except the basal Mkilua-Trigynaea lineage in the early
Eocene. In a recent paleontological review, most modern
subgroups of mammalian orders were shown to have
appeared during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, suggesting that rapid environmental changes may
have evolutionary significance [58]. During this period
(ca. 56 Mya: [59]), a Greenland land bridge may have connected North America and Eurasia, enabling plant dispersals between the two continents [51]. Another possible
dispersal route was across the Tethys seaway between
Africa-Arabia and Asia, allowing tropical plant dispersal
until the late Eocene-early Oligocene [56].
The mean tMRCA of the SBC is estimated at 39.8 Mya
(95% HPD: 55.2-26.9 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 7).
The ancestral biogeographical origin of the SBC cannot be
postulated here without a more extensive sampling of
genera, although the inferred areas could be Africa-Madagascar as shown in the Annickia-Piptostigma-Greenwayodendron clade [[5]: Figure 5]. Most evolutionary
diversifications within the SBC seemed to have initiated
ca. 29.1 Mya (95% HPD: 39.2-20.2 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure
2A: node 15). The rate of molecular evolution during the
early divergence of the SBC (arrowed in Figure 2B, indicated by blue line) is about four times slower than that
during the early divergence of the LBC (arrowed in Figure
2B, shown as thick red line).
The SBC, as shown in Figure 2A, consists of small clades
from Africa (a clade consisting Annickia, Piptostigma, and
Greenwayodendron) and South to Central America (Onychopetalum-Cremastosperma), with all other members from
Asia. Diversification within the SBC ca. 29.1 Mya (Figure
2A: node 15) resulted in a South American clade consisting of Cremastosperma, Klarobelia, Malmea, Mosannona,
Onychopetalum, Oxandra, Pseudomalmea and Pseudoxandra.
The descendents of SBC genera could have dispersed from
South America into Asia (since Monocarpia euneura occurs
in Borneo [60]) via Africa and the Indian Plate; this presumably occurred between 29.1 (95% HPD: 39.2-20.2
Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 15) and 23.0 Mya (95%
HPD: 31.1-16.0 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 18). The
alternative dispersal scenario (from Africa into Asia via
Europe) is less likely because most Asian Annonaceae

Page 12 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:153

occur in warm and moist tropical rainforests. It is therefore more probable that the SBC genera dispersed from
Africa to Asia via India, and that the dispersal between
Africa and India occurred before the collision between
Asia and India. Many past biogeographical studies have
postulated that the collision between Asia and India
occurred 50–55 Mya [61-63]. More recent work [64],
however, suggests that this Early Eocene event marks the
collision of India's northern margin with a sub-equatorially located island arc (remnants of which are today preserved as the Dazhuqu arc terrain in southern Tibet), with
the main continent-continent collision taking place ca. 34
Mya. However, the passage of the subcontinent may have
taken the north-eastern corner of the block [65] close to
western South-east Asia, and thus faunal and floral
exchanges between the two geographical regions may
have been possible from the late Paleocene (ca. 57 Mya)
onwards [50].
Phylogeny and historical biogeography of Pseuduvaria
The BEAST topology of Pseuduvaria (Figure 3) is similar to
those resulting from previous ML and Bayesian analyses
(see Figure 3 in [25]). Although the phylogenetic positions of Pseuduvaria species in clades I, II and III remain
identical, there are nevertheless some minor topological
discrepancies between the trees. In the present study,
clade III is shown to be sister to all other representatives
of Pseuduvaria, whereas in previous analyses [25] this
position was occupied by clade I. This is unlikely to have
a significant impact on biogeographical interpretations,
however, because the species in clades I, II and III are all
distributed in geographical regions that were formerly
part of the Sunda landmass. Another difference between
the present and previous analyses relates to the phylogenetic position of two New Guinea species, P. becarrii and
P. costata. These species are shown to be sister to all other
members of clade V in the present study, but were basal
within clade IV in the previous analyses [25]; the position
of these two species is not statistically supported,
although we suggest that they are more likely to belong to
clade V as this clade is predominantly composed of New
Guinea species. Several species in clade V (P. oxycarpa, P.
filipes, P. coriacea, P. mindorensis, P. reticulata, and P. mollis)
are furthermore located in different positions in different
analyses, but their positions lack statistical support. Again,
this may have little effect on biogeographical interpretations as most species in the clade are from New Guinea
(except P. mindorensis from the Philippines, P. oxycarpa
from Sulawesi, and P. reticulata, which is widespread in
Malesia).
Late Miocene origin in Sundaland
Biogeographical reconstructions using DIVA and WAAA
both suggest that Pseuduvaria originated in Sundaland
(Figure 4: node 4). Initial BEAST analyses based on matrix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/153

A (with a broad taxonomic sampling) gave an estimated
tMRCA for the Pseuduvaria lineage of 8.0 Mya (95% HPD:
11.5-5.0 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 2A: node 20); this node
was subsequently selected as one of the two secondary
molecular calibration points for Pseuduvaria in analyses
based on matrix B (Figure 3: C4). These later analyses suggest a late Miocene origin, with a mean tMRCA of 8.3 Mya
(95% HPD: 11.0-5.8 Mya, PP = 1.00; Figure 3: node 4).
The former estimation from matrix A analyses, with a
mean age of 8.0 Mya, will be used in all subsequent discussions presented here since this age was assigned as a
calibration prior to the tMRCA of Pseuduvaria for matrix B
analyses.
Early divergence of Pseuduvaria could have occurred
between 14.9 Mya (95% HPD: 20.2-9.7 Mya, PP < 0.95;
Figure 2A: node 19) and 8.0 Mya (95% HPD: 11.5-5.0
Mya; Figure 2A: node 20) during the Miocene, possibly
associated with the 'mid-Miocene climatic optimum'. This
warming phase occurred ca. 17-15 Mya [[57]: Figure 2],
and led to the extensive growth of megathermal vegetation throughout most regions in Sundaland [66]. Subsequent global cooling during the middle Miocene climate
transition (14.2-13.8 Mya) gradually resulted in the
reduction of sea surface temperatures and the expansion
of the Antarctic ice-sheets [67], which continued until ca.
6 Mya, in the early Pliocene [57]. These cold global temperatures were associated with a decline in CO2 levels,
affecting the productivity of terrestrial vegetation [68],
and resulted in the contraction of moist megathermal vegetation to the tropics and the concomitant expansion of
grasslands [66]. This was followed by a warming phase
that continued until ca. 3.2 Mya [57]. This climatic change
was reflected by a steady increase in rainforest diversity in
Southeast Asia until the mid Pliocene [66,69]. Subsequent
diversifications of Pseuduvaria gave rise to clade III at ca.
6.6 Mya (95% HPD: 9.5-3.8 Mya; Figure 3: node 5) and
clades I-II collectively at ca. 5.6 Mya (95% HPD: 8.1-3.2
Mya; Figure 3: node 10); this might be linked to these global climatic oscillations, with evolutionary divergence
promoted by the significantly warmer and wetter climate.
Diversification in Sundaland
Biogeographical reconstructions of the ancestral distributions of clades I-III using DIVA and WAAA suggest that all
three clades originated in Sundaland (Figure 4: nodes 5,
11, 15). Clade III consists of five species, P. phuyensis, P.
glossopetala, P. gardneri, P. multiovulata, and P. fragrans; the
tMCRA is estimated at ca. 6.6 Mya (node 5 in Table 3 and
Figure 3). Clades I and II originated at a similar time, with
tMRCA estimates of 4.1 and 4.2 Mya, respectively (nodes
11 and 15 in Table 3 and Figure 3).

Species in clades I and II are mostly endemic to Peninsular
Malaysia or Thailand, with the exception of four compar-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:153

atively widespread species, viz.: P trimera (southern
China, Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand), P. setosa (Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia), P. rugosa (Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Java), and P.
macrophylla (Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra) [25].
Pseuduvaria rugosa is estimated to have diverged around
1.5 Mya (95% HPD: 2.8-0.4 Mya, PP < 0.95; Table 3: node
14), at a similar time to P. macrophylla at ca. 1.3 Mya (95%
HPD: 2.4-0.3 Mya, PP = 0.99; Table 3: node 18). In the
middle and late Miocene, land connected Sumatra-Java to
mainland Southeast Asia [70]. Further reduction of sea
levels during the Pleistocene (to a maximum depth of 120
m below the present level) exposed additional land area
that connected Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, and
Borneo [71]. Tropical forests also gradually expanded, as
shown by the arrival of orangutans in Java [72]. At that
time, P. macrophylla and P. rugosa were likely to have been
able to disperse unimpeded between Sumatra, Java and
Peninsular Malaysia; P. trimera would similarly have been
able to advance northwards into southern China. Seed
dispersal of P. rugosa is known to be facilitated by orangutans [27].
Dispersal out of Sundaland
DIVA and WAAA indicated several possible ancestral distributions for clades IV and V collectively (Figure 4: node
20). According to DIVA, New Guinea, Borneo-New
Guinea, or Philippines-New Guinea are potential ancestral areas, whereas WAAA highlighted New Guinea (PI =
1.13) and the Philippines (PI = 0.62). The age of node 9 is
estimated at ca. 7.7 Mya, although this node is not statistically supported (PP < 0.95; Table 3). This age estimate
(indicated by a dotted black line in Figure 3) could represent the earliest migration event for Pseuduvaria out of
Sundaland to the Philippines and/or New Guinea
(Figure 6).

The tMRCA of clade IV is estimated at ca. 5.9 Mya (95%
HPD: 8.5-3.5 Mya, PP < 0.95; Figure 3: node 21). WAAA
indicated that the Philippines is the most likely ancestral
area, with the highest PI value of 1.7 (Table 3 and Figure
4: node 21), although Borneo also returned a relatively
high PI of 0.6. Similar results were obtained using DIVA,
with the Philippines or Borneo-Philippines as the most
likely ancestral areas (the third suggested scenario, with
New Guinea-Philippines as the ancestral area, is improbable since the two areas are not contiguous). The timing
of dispersal events from Sundaland to the Philippines
may be associated with the docking of the Philippine Sea
Plate with the Sunda Block, which was initiated in the late
Miocene-Pliocene [73].
The WAAA and DIVA results are complex within clade IV,
but appear to show probable dispersals from Borneo and/
or the Philippines eastwards into New Guinea (dotted red

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/153

arrows in Figure 6) and westwards into continental Southeast Asia, Sumatra and/or Java (yellow arrows in Figure 6).
The eastward migration into New Guinea may have
occurred between node 22 (mean tMRCA: 5.3 Mya; without HPD, PP < 0.95; Table 3) and node 23 (mean tMRCA:
2.5 Mya; 95% HPD: 5.3-0.3 Mya, PP < 0.95; Table 3).
These dispersals from Sundaland to New Guinea may
have been achieved by three routes: island hopping after
the collision of the Australian Plate with the Philippine
Plate; stochastic dispersals across the Makassar Straits; or
dispersal of montane taxa via island-hopping following
the uplift of New Guinea and other islands [51]. The dispersal of Dacrycarpus (Podocarpaceae) is a suggested
example of the third route: Dacrycarpus dispersed to New
Guinea from Australia in the mid-Miocene and then dispersed to Borneo ca. 3.5 Mya in the mid-Pliocene [51].
Pseuduvaria species generally occur at low altitudes, suggesting that this third route is less likely to be important,
although P. lignocarpa can occur at altitudes over 1000 m
[27].
WAAA determined that the most probable ancestral areas
at node 24 (Figure 4) are either Borneo (with the highest
PI of 1.79; Table 3) or the Philippines (PI = 0.48; Table 3);
similar results were obtained using DIVA. The ancestral
distributions for node 25 (Figure 4) were the same as
those for node 24, although node 25 is not statistically
supported. A westward migration from Borneo-Philippines into mainland Southeast Asia, Sumatra and/or Java
may have occurred by nodes 26, 27 and/or 28 (yellow
arrows in Figure 6).
Colonization of New Guinea via long-distance dispersal
Clade V contains almost half of the genus, with most species currently distributed in New Guinea. The earliest suggested date for the colonization of New Guinea by
Pseuduvaria species is 7.7 Mya (95% HPD: 10.1-5.2 Mya,
PP < 0.95; Figure 4: node 9), although this clade lacks statistical support (Table 3). If colonization of New Guinea
by node 9 is accepted, it is necessary to invoke a subsequent reverse westward dispersal for clades I and II (Figure
4: node 10). A more conservative scenario involves a later
colonization of New Guinea after 7.4 Mya (Figure 4: node
20), although this node is also unsupported.

A recent plate tectonic modeling of New Guinea during
the Cenozoic [[74]: Figure 8] has shown major changes in
the motion of the Pacific Plate beginning around 43 Mya
(Eocene), with the initiation of two subduction systems,
generating the Inner and Outer Melanesian arcs. During
the Oligocene (ca. 35-30 Mya), the first significant collision event began and the northern part of the Australia
plate was subducted underneath the Inner Melanesian arc,
creating the 'Peninsular orogeny' and generating the
Papuan Peninsula [74]. As a result of a drop in sea level

(ca. 90 m) during the Oligocene, central and western New
Guinea became largely sub-aerial.
In the late Miocene (ca. 10 Mya), a second collision event
initiated in western New Guinea, creating the 'Central
Range orogeny' [74]. At that time, the Sunda and the
Sahul Shelves may have reached closest proximity,
although floristic migration may have been unlikely since
New Guinea was still largely submerged, and deep ocean
barriers existed with no land bridges [75,76]. The best
opportunity for biota to 'island hop' across Wallacea
appears to have been during the last 5 million years [75],
due to: (1) the formation of a substantial landmass in
Sulawesi from ca. 5 Mya [75]; (2) the connection between
New Guinea and Sundaland via the Banda and Sunda arcs
[[70], p. 122]; (3) the increasing number of volcanic
islands in East Indonesia [77]; (4) the exposure of the
Sunda and Sahul Shelves caused by falling sea level (up to
120 m lower than present levels) during the Pleistocene
glaciations [71]; and (5) the accretion of microcontinental

island arc fragments at the northern edge of the Australian
craton portion of New Guinea [75,77]. Migration of
Pseuduvaria from Sundaland to New Guinea may therefore have been facilitated by a series of stepping stones,
possibly via Borneo (dotted red arrow in Figure 7) or the
Lesser Sunda Islands (dotted orange arrow in Figure 7).
Pseuduvaria also occurs in the Aru islands (P. aurantiaca)
and New Britain (P. macrocarpa). Similar biogeographical
patterns are found in other plant groups such as the tribe
Aglaieae (Meliaceae) which originated in western Malesia
and subsequently dispersed eastwards to the Aru and Kai
islands, New Guinea, New Britain, Australia, Fiji and
other Pacific islands [78]; migration between the Sunda
and Sahul shelves was likely to have been achieved via
long-distance dispersal by birds [78].
Diversification patterns in New Guinea and Australia
Pseuduvaria may have begun to diversify in New Guinea
after node 34 from ca. 6.5 Mya (95% HPD: 9.0-4.3 Mya,
PP < 0.95; Figure 3), resulting in two main lineages with
Page 15 of 19

tMRCAs of ca. 5.8 Mya (Table 3: node 35) and ca. 4.5 Mya
(Table 3: node 45). Coincident with this timeframe, there
was a gradual transition between global cooling and
warming phases: the cooling phase lasted until ca. 6 Mya,
followed by a warming phase with moist climate until ca.
3.2 Mya [57]. A cooling period subsequently started again
with a drier climate in the late Pliocene [79], followed by
several cycles of glacial-interglacial episodes from ca. 1.8
Mya during the Pleistocene [80,81]. These climatic oscillations, combined with the changes in sea level, may have
promoted Pseuduvaria speciation in New Guinea.
Pseuduvaria exhibits a high level of endemism (95%) in
New Guinea [27]. This could be associated with the Central Range orogeny in New Guinea, which developed from
ca. 8 Mya; this collisional orogenesis led to the formation
of a ca. 1300 km-long mountainous backbone from the
Bird's Neck to the Papuan Peninsula [74] with some peaks
over 5000 m [82]. Speciation within New Guinea may
therefore have been promoted by mountain ranges over
4000 m acting as physical barriers and influencing temperatures, and a continuously hot and wet climate with
rainfalls of over 2500 mm per annum [83]. Pseuduvaria
species in New Guinea diversified morphologically in

response to these physical and climatic barriers, with evolutionary shifts from unisexual into bisexual flowers,
elongation of flowering and fruiting peduncles (favouring
fruit-bat frugivory), and the evolution of distinct pollination systems [25,27]. The New Guinea orogeny is analogous to the Miocene uplift of the Andean range, where
different elevations (lowland or highland habitats) have
impacted species diversification in the Neotropics [84].
There is also evidence of dispersal of Pseuduvaria species
from New Guinea to northern Australia (Figs 5, 7), as
shown in node 44 (P. froggattii and P. hylandii) and node
53 (P. villosa, P. mulgraveana and P. glabrescens). These
clades are estimated to have evolved after 2.6 Mya (Table
3: node 43) and 3.9 Mya (Table 3: node 52), respectively.
Pseuduvaria would have been able to disperse between
New Guinea and Australia during the Pleistocene (red
arrows in Figure 7): glaciations caused a lowering of
oceans to at least 120 m below the present level [85-87],
and as a result New Guinea and northern Australia formed
a continuous land mass [76,86] with open forest vegetation growing across the Torres Strait land bridge (between
eastern New Guinea and northern Australia) between
17,000 and 8,000 years ago [88].

Although clade V is largely composed of New Guinea and
Australian species, there are three significant exceptions.
Pseuduvaria reticulata is widespread in Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda islands and Borneo, indicating an apparent westwards recolonization of
Sundaland between 5.4 Mya (Table 3: node 37) and 4.1
Mya (Table 3: node 38). The most likely migration route
from the Sahul Shelf to Sundaland (Java) may have been
be achieved via Sulawesi [79] (yellow arrows in Figure 7);
dispersal across the wide Makassar Straits seems unlikely
since these straits have been shown to be an effective barrier between eastern and western Malesia [89].
A northward migration from New Guinea to the Philippines, possibly via Sulawesi (brown arrow in Figure 7), is
shown by P. mindorensis after ca. 4.1 Mya (Table 3: node
51), although this node lacks statistical support. Another
westwards reversal event is evident in P. oxycarpa, which
may have migrated from New Guinea to Sulawesi
between 3.9 (Table 3: node 52) and 3.7 Mya (Table 3:
node 55). A substantial landmass was present in the
Sulawesi region between ca. 10-5 Mya [75], but it was not
until the last 5 Ma that the three distinct fragments
(peninsular NE, mainland NE, and W Sulawesi) became
united [90], facilitating the migration of plants and animals across Wallacea [75].

Conclusion
The divergence times of the main clades within the
Annonaceae (derived here using BEAST) deviate slightly
from those previously determined using different calibration points and dating methods. In particular, our estimate for the SBC crown is 39.8 Mya (95% HPD: 55.2-26.9
Mya), which is much younger than previous estimates of
62.5-53.1 ± 3.6 Mya [7] and 58.76 Mya [8]. The present
study differs from previous research as it utilizes an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and is calibrated
using the recently described fossil, Futabanthus; these factors are likely to enable more precise divergence time estimates within the Annonaceae.

tistically supported. If such a scenario is correct, it is necessary to invoke long-distance dispersal events since the
geological data suggest that biotic migration between the
two landmasses would have been unlikely: New Guinea
was largely submerged during this period and the Sunda
and Sahul landmasses were separated by deep ocean barriers without land bridges [75,76]. It was only within the
past 5 Ma that significant opportunities may have existed
for biotic migration into New Guinea from Sundaland
[75], and significantly all the other postulated migrations
between New Guinea and Sundaland occurred within this
period: from Sundaland to New Guinea between nodes
22 and 23 in clade IV (i.e., after 5.3 Mya); from New
Guinea to Sundaland between nodes 37 and 38 in clade V
(i.e., after 5.4 Mya); and from New Guinea to Sulawesi
between nodes 52 and 55 in clade V (i.e., after 3.9 Mya).
Our previous study of morphological character evolution
within Pseuduvaria [25] indicated that the ancestors of
clade V were likely to have had fruits with large monocarps (individual fruit segments derived from the maturation of individual carpels within the flower); this
inference holds true irrespective of whether the New
Guinea species P. beccarii and P. costata are included in
clade IV (as indicated in our previous study [25]) or
included in clade V (present analysis). There is a dearth of
observational reports on frugivory and seed dispersal of
Pseuduvaria species [27], although it appears that seeds of
smaller-fruited species are bird-dispersed whereas those of
larger-fruited species are dispersed by primates or fruit
bats. It is probable that the long-distance dispersal events
hypothesised to explain the early colonization of New
Guinea by Pseuduvaria species may have been facilitated
by fruit bats. Significantly, the majority of New Guinea
species of Pseuduvaria possess elongate flowering peduncles and/or pedicels [25]: separation of fruits from the
foliage (thereby ensuring that the fruits are conspicuous)
is a common feature of plants adapted for fruit-bat frugivory [90].

Authors' contributions
Pseuduvaria is shown to have originated in Sundaland in
the late Miocene, ca. 8 Mya (95% HPD: 11.5-5.0 Mya).
Subsequent migration events were predominantly eastwards towards New Guinea and Australia, although several migratory reversals are also postulated. The suggested
dispersal episodes are broadly consistent with the available geological data.
The migration of Pseuduvaria species into New Guinea
from Sundaland and/or the Philippines is of particular
biogeographical interest. DIVA and WAAA reconstructions of the most probable ancestral areas at each node
suggest that the earliest migration of Pseuduvaria species
into New Guinea may have occurred as early as 7.7 Mya
(95% HPD: 10.1-5.2 Mya), although this node is not sta-

YCFS collected and analysed the molecular data. RMKS
conceived the study and obtained funding. Both authors
wrote the paper and have read and approved the final
manuscript.
