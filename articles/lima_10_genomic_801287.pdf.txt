Abstract
Background: The orderly progression through mitosis is regulated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a
large multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets key cell-cycle regulators for destruction by the 26 S proteasome.
The APC is composed of at least 11 subunits and associates with additional regulatory activators during mitosis
and interphase cycles. Despite extensive research on APC and activator functions in the cell cycle, only a few
components have been functionally characterized in plants.
Results: Here, we describe an in-depth search for APC subunits and activator genes in the Arabidopsis, rice and
poplar genomes. Also, searches in other genomes that are not completely sequenced were performed.
Phylogenetic analyses indicate that some APC subunits and activator genes have experienced gene duplication
events in plants, in contrast to animals. Expression patterns of paralog subunits and activators in rice could indicate
that this duplication, rather than complete redundancy, could reflect initial specialization steps. The absence of
subunit APC7 from the genome of some green algae species and as well as from early metazoan lineages, could
mean that APC7 is not required for APC function in unicellular organisms and it may be a result of duplication of
another tetratricopeptide (TPR) subunit. Analyses of TPR evolution suggest that duplications of subunits started
from the central domains.
Conclusions: The increased complexity of the APC gene structure, tied to the diversification of expression paths,
suggests that land plants developed sophisticated mechanisms of APC regulation to cope with the sedentary life
style and its associated environmental exposures.

Background
Cell proliferation is controlled by an universally conserved molecular machinery in which the key players
are cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins
(reviewed in [1]). Eukaryotes have therefore evolved elaborate mechanisms for CDK regulation. An irreversible
mechanism of CDK down-regulation is destruction of
cyclin subunits [2,3]. At the G1- to S-phase and metaphase to anaphase transitions, CDKs are irreversibly
inactivated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cognate
cyclins [4]. Degradation of protein substrates through
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involves the activity
of different E3 ligases, among them the anaphase* Correspondence: paulof@bioqmed.ufrj.br

promoting complex (APC). The APC was first identified
based on its role in facilitating the multiubiquitination
and targeting of A- and B-type cyclins for proteasomemediated destruction during mitosis [5-8]. APC is a
multiprotein complex conserved from plants to man
and contains at least 11 core subunits [9]. The APC is
regulated in part by two associated proteins, CDC20 and
CCS52/CDH1, that can both activate the APC with
proper timing and provide substrate specificity [10,11].
The APC is activated at metaphase/anaphase transition
by the CDC20 protein and later in telophase and G1 by
the CDH1 protein. Substrates that have a destruction
box (D-box), KEN-box or A-box motifs are recognized
and ubiquitinated by the APC [12-14].
The APC has important functions in mitosis, meiosis,
G 1 -S-phase and in post-mitotic differentiated cells

[15,16]. The mitosis-specific activator CDC20 is itself an
APC substrate. Other targets of APC/C degradation are:
Cyclins A and B; protein kinases Plk1, CDC5, Aurora A
and B; regulators of DNA replication Geminin, CDC6;
and the anaphase inhibitor Securin (reviewed in [17]).
The proteolytic events triggered by the APC are
required to release sister chromatides cohesion during
anaphase, to control the exit from mitosis and to prevent premature entry into S-phase [6,18,19].
Although the role of the APC in controlling cell-cycle
progression has been extensively investigated, has recent
work shown the unexpected presence of APC subunits
in differentiated tissues, in particular in the nervous system of vertebrates (reviewed in [20]). In plants, the
expression of several APC subunits has been detected in
differentiated tissues of Arabidopsis [21,22]. In addition,
while both CDC27a and CDC27b genes are essential
during gametogenesis, the CDC27b subunit has been
implicated also in post-embryogenic differentiation at
meristem levels [23]. Besides, it has been shown that
reduced levels of APC6 and APC10 subunits in Arabidopsis lead to plants with several defects in vascular
development [24]. These results indicate that, while the
overall structure of the APC is conserved among eukaryotes, this E3 ligase may have assumed specialized functions in the diverse kingdoms. Gene duplication and
retention in plants has been extensive and gene families
are generally larger in plants than in animals [25].
Nevertheless, almost all studies on the APC function in
plants have been carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Comparative genomic analyses can provide valuable insights into the organization of cell cycle
machinery and the evolution of these protein complexes.
In this article, we describe thorough searches for the
predicted sequences of the APC subunits and the activators CDC20/CCS52 in plant sequence databases. Our
results indicate that land plants and green algae orthologs have an ancient evolutionary origin. We present
phylogenetic analysis of TPR subunits and activators,
and their orthologs from other plants. An evolutionary
analysis of Arabidopsis TPR domain suggests that tandem regions could have been created from duplication
of internal sequence domains. Overall, our data support
the proposal that APC subunits and activators have
been conserved in the course of evolution. However,
while other eukaryotes like fungi and metazoans have
only one copy of each APC subunit and its regulators,
gene duplication of different subunits have occurred in
Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, and in other plant genomes as well. An attractive proposal is that gene duplication of APC subunits may result in the formation of
APC subcomplexes that evolved to assume restricted
specialized roles during plant development. Indeed, in
Arabidopsis, duplication of the CDC27 subunit led to

Page 2 of 18

substantial sequence divergence and specialization [23].
Here we show that the two copies of rice CDC23 and
APC11 subunits and the activators genes are differentially expressed in plant tissues or when grown under
either dark or light-mediated developmental programs,
suggesting the duplicated genes could be assuming new
functions in the plant.

Results and Discussion
Identification of APC subunits and activator genes

In order to carry out the cross-species comparison of
the APC and activators, we have searched for homologous sequences in the Genomic Research (TIGR) Rice
genome database and DOE Join Genome Institute (JGI)
Poplar genome database. The sequences of the Arabidopsis APC subunits have been published [21,26,27].
Even after exhaustive data mining, some rice and poplar
sequences were only found in the EST database Gene
Index DFCI. Subsequently, the SMART motif identification tool was used to identify predicted domains in all
candidate proteins [28]. Using this strategy, we report
the APC/activators in the dicotyledonous poplar and the
monocotyledon rice plants (Table 1 and Additional file
1). All APC subunits and activators were found, and
they contained the predicted conserved domains, providing one of many examples for the evolutionary conservation of the eukaryotic cell-cycle machinery [29,30].
Two CDC27 homologs have been identified in Arabidopsis AtCDC27a and AtCDC27b [31]. In poplar, two
homologs of CDC27 were also identified: PtCDC27_1
and PtCDC27_2. However, a careful inspection of the
PtCDC27_2 deposited sequence revealed a stop codon
TAG at nucleotide position 1471-1473. This fragment
was amplified and sequenced and the presence of the
stop codon was discarded. The expression of both genes
in leaves was confirmed by quantitative PCR (see Additional file 2). We also found two homologs of CDC27 in
the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens genome [32]. However, only one copy of CDC27 was found in the rice
genome as well as other monocot plants. On the other
hand, the rice genome has two OsCDC23 and OsAPC11
subunits [33]. We examined other complete genomes
and found two CDC23 (VvCDC23_1 and VvCDC23_2)
and APC11 (VvAPC11_1 and VvAPC11_2) genes in
grapevine [34]. Two homologs of PtAPC13 were found
in the poplar and grapevine genomes, a feature that has
not been reported in any other eukaryotic species so far.
The structures of many predicted genes were considerably misannotated. Comparing EST databases from
plant species and using bioinformatics tools, it was
possible to identify the correct gene sequences. The
genomic sequence of OsAPC1 was not found in the
TIGR database, but a partial CDS was identified in the
Gene Index database (see Additional file 3). Most likely,

the largest subunit of the APC had come apart by misannotation. Diverse exon-intron structures needed correction in the genomics sequences. OsAPC4 may
contain an intron in the genomic ORF and OsCDC23_2
may have a fragment of an exon involved in the formation of TPR domain erroneously annotated as an intron
(see Additional file 4). The 3’region of predicted PtAPC4
and the 5’-3’regions of PtAPC5 were incomplete. However, we found fragments from 3’regions of both genes
and fragments from the 5’region of PtAPC5 in the EST
database (see Additional file 4). Interestingly, OsAPC5,
OsCDC16 and OsAPC11_2 have a divergent 5’region
compared to Arabidopsis and poplar genes (see Additional files 4 and 5). The first methionine of OsCDC16
and OsAPC11_2 are upstream from a consensus start
codon in CDC16 and APC11 genes, but only for

CDC16 there is EST support. The opposite occurs with
OsAPC5, where the first methionine is downstream
from the consensus start codon. The APC genes
AtCDC26, OsCDC26, PtCDC26 and OsAPC13 were
identified in EST databases.
Arabidopsis contains three CCS52 genes, AtCCS52A1,
AtCCS52A2 and AtCCS52B; and five CDC20 genes [27].
In addition, we found another CDC20 homolog in the
Arabidopsis genome. This AtCDC20_6 (At5g27945)
showed major differences from conserved structures of
other CDC20; the CDS does not have the C-box
sequence element (consensus DR(F/Y)IPxR) that was
first identified in the N-terminal region of CDC20,
although it is conserved in all known APC/C co-activators (this was confirmed by re-sequencing - see Additional file 6), and therefore AtCDC20_6 could be a

pseudogene. The rice genome has three predicted
CDC20 genes compared to five in Poplar and Arabidopsis. Rice has two CCS52 genes compared to four and
three genes in Poplar and Arabidopsis, respectively
(Table 1). Exon-intron organization of activators was
analyzed and we found a number of annotation errors.
AtCDC20_5, PtCDC20_5, PtCCS52A1 and PtCCS52A1_2
have errors in the 5’ region. We found that only
PtCDC20_5 is without a C-box. OsCDC20_1,
AtCDC20_4, PtCDC20_2, PtCDC20_4 and PtCDC20_5
had mistakes in the 3’ region. This region contains the
IR-tail sequence element (consensus IR) that occupies
the C terminus of APC activators and the APC subunit
APC10. Comparing with EST databases, all sequences
were deduced and the IR-tail was identified (see Additional file 7). In PtCCS52A1_2 and OsCDC20_2 genes,
introns were incorrectly included. The opposite happened in the OsCDC20_1 gene, where one exon was
absent. Alternative splicing variants were found in the
Arabidopsis, rice and poplar APC/activator genes (data
not shown) and could represent another layer of complexity in the organization and function of the APC. We
selected only a single variant for further analysis.
Duplication of cell-cycle machinery components is rare
in metazoans but it is a widespread phenomenon in
plants [35-38].It has been proposed that duplication, followed by sequence divergence of promoter and/or coding
regions, leads to novel and specialized functions unique
to the plant kingdom [23,39]. Still, additional file 8 shows
that duplications of individual subunits of the APC are
not present in all plants; on the contrary, they may be
restricted to one or to a small group of phylogenetically
related plant species and may be involved in the organization of developmental events unique to this group.
Chromosomal location of genes for APC subunits and
activator

The close similarity and presence of putative subunits
and paralogs prompted us to investigate the genome distribution of plant APC/activators. APC genes were
found in the five Arabidopsis chromosomes, 10 of the
12 rice chromosomes and 10 of the 19 poplar chromosomes (and seven in scaffolds) (see Additional file 9).
Only one APC subunit is duplicated in the Arabidopsis genome, AtCDC27a and AtCDC27b, and they are
located on different chromosomes, 3 and 2 respectively;
they share 47% identity and 64% protein similarity. A
duplication event is predicted to have occurred in this
case according to the tool Paralogons in Arabidopsis
[40]. Arabidopsis CDC20 and CCS52 genes are located
on chromosomes 4 and 5. AtCCS52A1 and AtCCS52A2
appear to be the result of a recent duplication and
AtCDC20_1 and AtCDC20_2 are present in tandem on
chromosome 4 [27].

Page 4 of 18

The 19 rice APC and activator genes are distributed
among all chromosomes, except chromosomes 10 and
11. Based on the sequence consensus, rice genome, segmental duplication information from the TIGR database
was used to identify paralog genes. Each pair of paralogs
located in the corresponding segmental duplication
regions share high sequence similarity. Two subunits CDC23 and APC11 - are duplicated. OsCDC23_1 and
OsCDC23_2 are located on chromosomes 2 and 6,
respectively and share 92% identity. OsAPC11_1 and
OsAPC11_2 are located on chromosome 3 and 7,
respectively and share 97% identify. No evidences for
recent duplication events in rice activators were found.
In-silico chromosome mapping revealed that poplar
APC/activators are scattered throughout the genome.
Paralogs are also located on different chromosomes or
scaffolds. It is possible, however, that some of the apparently closely related genes are in fact alleles from unassembled haplotypes, which are potential artifacts from
shotgun assembly of this highly heterozygous genome.
However, the apparent co-orthologs are divergent at the
nucleotide level, as well as in the flanking gene order,
and they are identified in the syntenic blocks which
argue against the classification of the scaffold as a haplotype. Duplications of two APC subunits were identified;
CDC27 and APC13. PtCDC27_1 is located on linkage
group VIII and PtCDC27_2 on scaffold_211. Both are
very similar to each other - 88% identity and 85% similarity in their amino-acid sequences, respectively.
PtAPC13_1 is 95% identical to PtAPC13_2 and they are
located on linkage groups IV and XI, respectively.
Poplar CCS52 genes are closely related, suggesting a
recent genomic duplication event. Linkage groups III
and I and VIII and X share large megabase-blocks in
complete colinearity. PtCDC20_1 and PtCDC20_3 are
located in chromosomal regions that might represent
paralog segments - linkage groups XIII and XIX. Other
CDC20 genes are located on linkage group XVI and
scaffold_1538. The scattered distribution of APC/activators is in good agreement with previous studies that
described large-scale duplication events in poplar [41].
Phylogenetic analysis of APC TPRs subunits and activators
proteins

An important question is why the APC is composed of
many different subunits, while most E3 ligases are composed of one to three subunits. Most of the APC subunits are conserved in all eukaryotes and remain tightly
associated throughout the cell cycle [42,43]. It seems
probable that the complexity of multiprotein domains is
related to the intricate topology of APC [44,45]. One
important domain in the APC subunits is TPR, which
consists of 3-16 tandem repeats of 34 amino-acid residues. However, individual TPR domains can be

Lima et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/254

dispersed in the protein sequence [46]. TPRs appear to
act as versatile protein-protein interaction domains and
it has been hypothesized that the TPR-containing proteins in the APC form a scaffold on which the other
subunits assemble [47]. Five APC subunits contain TPR
domains: CDC27, APC5, CDC16, APC7 and CDC23.
TPR-containing sequences of primitive red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae; green algae Volvox carteri, Chlorella
sp., Micromonas sp and Ostreococcus sp; the bryophyte
Physcomitrella patens; the licophyte Selaginella moellendorffii; the land plants Vitis vinifera and Sorghum bicolor; and the poplar, rice and Arabidopsis sequences were
used to gain insight into the evolutionary relationship
between land plants and algae. A phylogenetic tree was
constructed with the MEGA4 neighbor-joining method,
employing multiple alignments of 15 CDC27, 11 APC5,
12 CDC16, 9 APC7 and 14 CDC23 genes, with bootstrap analysis of 2,000 replicates to ensure statistical
reliability (Figure 1 and Additional file 10). Subsequently, the 61 APC subunits were divided into five
phylogenetic groups of ortholog genes. The cladogram
obtained shows the OsCDC23 genes in the same branch,
located in the same group as S. bicolor. Grapevine
CDC23 genes are in the same group as poplar. The cladogram also shows that the poplar and grapevine genes
are in the same branches in every group, and this could
reveal slow evolutionary rates in woody when compared
to herbaceous plants. On the other hand, while Arabidopsis CDC27a is in the same group of CDC27b, it is in
a separate branch, and sequence divergence and evolution may reflect the accelerated life cycle of this plant.
Interestingly, the APC5 and CDC16 clades do not contain duplicated genes. We have not identified an APC5
sequence in red algae C. merolae; however, this subunit
sequence is not so well conserved among different
organisms, and it is possible that the similarity is too
low to be identified by BLAST comparison.
The APC7 gene is absent in green algae Chlorella sp
and V. carteri, as well as in the red algae C. merolae,
but it is present in green algae Ostreococcus sp and
Micromonas sp. Chlorophytes (e.g., V. carteri) and Trebouxiophytes (e.g., Chlorella sp) have apparently lost the
APC7 gene, but the Prasinophytes (e.g., Ostreococcus sp,
Micromonas sp) and land plants retained this TPR subunit. These data also suggest that the primitive ancestor
of Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae classes lost
APC7 gene during green algae evolution (see Additional
file 11). The APC7 gene is also not found in the yeasts,
and it could mean that it is not required for APC function in unicellular organisms and it could be a recent
duplication of another TPR subunit.
The Arabidopsis genome codes for six CDC20 genes
and three CCS52 genes. In addition, CCS52 genes have
been divided into two types (A and B) on the basis of

functional and sequence analysis [27]. To gain an understanding of the evolutionary relationship between activators from land plants and algae, phylogenetic analysis
was performed for activators from plants and algae genomes (Figure 2 and Additional file 10). We used EST
sequences from Zea mays, Medicago truncatula and
Saccharum officinarum to better estimate divergence
between monocot and dicot sequences. The obtained
phylogenetic tree reveals three major class groups.
Three genes, CmCDC20, CmCCS52 and SmCDC20_3,
are isolated from the others and thus need to be treated
as nonconserved sequences. One clade groups all
CDC20 sequences (except CmCDC20 and SmCDC20_3),
while two other clades included the CCS52A and
CCS52B sequences (except CmCCS52). The CDC20
clade is divided into two subfamilies: one with S. moellendorffii and P. patens and another with algae and land
plants. The number of CDC20 copies varies according
to species. Arabidopsis has six copies, rice three, poplar
five, grapevine four, sorghum three, S. moellendorffii
three and P. patens four. The CCS52A clade contains
more duplications than the CCS52B clade. All algae
CCS52 genes, two copies of PtCCS52A, AtCCS52A and
SmCCS52, and three copies of PpCCS52 genes are
grouped into the CCS52A branch.
Curiously, only one copy of the CDC20 and CCS52
(possibly a primitive A-type) genes was found in algae
genomes. The absence of CCS52B type genes in algae,
P. patens and S. moellendorffii is interesting because
these species are at the base of plant evolution where
divergence into A-type and B-type has not occurred yet.
Like Arabidopsis, poplar has two copies of CCS52A;
however poplar has an additional copy of CCS52B. Analyses of poplar gene evolution must take into account
the most significant event in the recent evolution of the
genus: a genome-wide duplication event at approximately 65Mya and is still detectable over approximately
92% of the genome [41]. Based on the age estimates of
duplicate genes and homology microsynteny analyses,
CDC20 and CCS52 gene pairs are represented within
segmental duplication regions associated with the recent
salicoid duplication event.
Comparison of Arabidopsis, rice and poplar TPRs proteins
and determination of orthologous relationships

Progress in comparative genomics allows assessing the
impact of gene and genome evolution on the appearance
of novel biological functions and their effect on organismal complexity [48]. The importance of gene duplication in supplying raw genetic material for biological
evolution has been recognized for decades and is still
extensively studied. Gene duplication generates functional redundancy, which allows two identical genes
resulting from the duplication to accumulate mutations

with relaxed selection pressure [49,50]. Differentiated or
novel function may be achieved after a period of evolution. Segmental duplication (tandem duplication of a
genomic segment) is the most prevalent way to generate
redundant genes [51]. Segmental duplication can also
happen on a smaller scale, resulting in duplicated exons,
rather than an entire gene [52]. These segmental duplication blocks can create protein fragments (referred to
as domain) that have structure and function [53].

The TPR domain consists of a 34-residue repeat that
adopts a helix-turn-helix conformation, which is associated with protein-protein interactions [54]. The subunits CDC27, APC5, CDC16, APC7 and CDC23 have
TPR domains, but the total number of TPR repeats and
the position in each sequence is variable. Exon shuffling
may be responsible for internal duplications in repeats
and we decided to investigate the exon-intron organization of TPR genes in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar

(Figure 3A) [55]. The number and position of exons and
introns in the genomic sequences are remarkably conserved in some of the APC subunit genes. The CDC27
gene has two homologs in Arabidopsis and poplar, and
only one in rice. Interestingly, the CDC27 gene maintains 16 exons in monocot and dicots. The APC5 and
APC7 genes have one copy in all genomes and also
maintain 20 and 18 exons respectively, in the three

genomes. On the other hand, the CDC23 gene has two
homologs in rice and only one in Arabidopsis and
poplar, but the most significant information is the lower
number of exons when compared with other TPR-containing genes. The OsCDC23_2 has 5 exons (exonintron annotation in Additional file 12) and AtCDC23,
PtCDC23 and OsCDC23_1 have 4 exons. Examining the
CDC16 gene we identified 15 exons in poplar, 16 exons

in Arabidopsis and 17 exons in rice. We next compared
the exon organization of all TPR genes from Arabidopsis using domain prediction. Nine TPR repeat sequences
were identified in AtCDC27a and AtCDC16 sequences,
two in AtAPC5 and ten in the AtAPC7 and AtCDC23
sequences (Figure 3B). AtCDC27b has the same number
of TPR domains as AtCDC27a. Tandem arrangement of
TPR domains occurs predominantly at the C-terminal of
AtCDC27a, AtCDC27b, AtCDC16, AtAPC7 and
AtCDC23 sequences. AtAPC5 has only two TPR
domains, one in the middle of the sequence and another
at the C-terminal. The results show that TPR tandem
repeat topology on protein sequences is at least partially
related with the exon organization of TPR subunit
genes.
In the APC subunits, the tandem arrangement of TPR
domains suggests that the elements evolved by duplication followed by primary sequence divergence. Because
TPR are conserved structure repeat elements which are
often divergent at the primary sequence level, TPR
domain sequences can diverge a great deal over time
and have poor consensus motifs. An approach to investigate the evolution of TPR domains in the subunits is
to identify patterns of TPR duplication from the alignments. Distinct patterns of repetition can often be distinguished, and we tested whether the Arabidopsis TPR
proteins have defined internal repetition blocks. The
sequences of TPR proteins were aligned to each other
or in pairs using the methodology described in [56]. The
pairwise sequence similarities between all repeating
domains in a protein were examined using the SmithWaterman algorithm to identify patterns of duplication
from the alignments [57]. The alignment scores between
the domains were displayed in a matrix (Figure 3C and
in Additional file 13). Comparing the proteins to themselves, there are similarities among domains 4-6 in
AtCDC27; and among domains 5-9 in AtCDC16.
AtAPC7 has a pattern for domains 1-2, AtCDC23 has
patterns of similarities for domains 6-8; and no pattern
was found to for AtAPC5. Comparing the proteins in
pairs, we can observe a diagonal match between
AtCDC27 domains 2-6 and AtCDC23 domains 3-7.
There are also indications of similarities for the pairs
AtCDC27 and AtCDC16, AtCDC16 and AtCDC23.
Although there are no unambiguous duplication patterns for any of the proteins, the results suggest that
TPR domains in the APC genes have evolved by duplication of the central elements, or that higher constraints
are imposed to changes in the primary sequence of
these repeats.
Expression analysis of APC subunits and activators genes

Gene duplication can be a source of innovation for the
increased developmental complexity of plants.

Page 9 of 18

Expression patterns can provide important clues for
gene function under specific conditions. We examined
the expression of the APC subunit and activators genes
in 5-day old rice roots and shoots, and in sheath and
blade of mature tissues (Figure 4A). As expected, there
are higher levels of gene expression in tissues with high
proliferation rates, although there is more mRNA in
shoots than in roots. However, a complex pattern is
observed when their expression is examined in mature
blade. In general, there is a general decrease in expression for several genes, as expected. However, the degree
of reduction is variable. The mRNA levels of OsAPC1,
OsAPC2, OsAPC4, OsAPC5, OsCDC16, OsCDC23_2,
OsAPC10, OsAPC11_2, OsCDC26, and OsAPC13 are
reduced in both sheath and blade compared to aerial
part. On the other hand, OsAPC11_2 and OsCDC27
mRNA levels are reduced only in the sheath, but not in
the blade. Finally, there is no reduction of OsAPC7
mRNA levels in both sheath and blade. In contrast,
expression levels of activator genes are markedly
reduced in mature leaves. However, although CCS52A
mRNA levels are lower in both sheath and blade, the
reduction is less pronounced. In Medicago, the CCS52A
gene has been implicated in control of endoreduplication in nodules [58]. Recently, it has been shown that
the CCS52A gene is important for maintenance of meristem activity in roots of Arabidopsis [59]. Therefore, it
is possible that the CCS52A could form a specialized
complex with some of the APC subunits and assume a
unique function in mature leaves.
Growth response to dark is part of an integrated
developmental change throughout all the plant organs
[60]. In Arabidopsis, hypocotyl cells undergo up to two
rounds of endoreduplication in light-grown seedlings,
whereas an additional round can be observed specifically
during dark-grown development [61,62]. The endoreduplication regulatory mechanism is thought to be common to the G1-S transition of the mitotic cell cycle [63].
G 1 -S transition is important for CDK inactivation by
cyclin proteolysis, mediated by APC CDH1 , which then
maintains cyclin instability in G 1 and enables a new
round of DNA replication by allowing the assembly of
pre-replication complex (pre-RCs) [64]. Almost all rice
APC subunits have similar expression patterns, both in
roots and shoots (Figure 4B). However, OsAPC11_1 and
OsCDC26 mRNA levels increased in darkness. Interestingly, the two OsCDC23 genes are differentially
expressed in etiolated roots. While OsCDC23_1 mRNA
levels did not change in roots grown in the dark or
light, OsCDC23_2 mRNA levels in roots were much
lower when rice plants were grown in the dark. Similarly, in etiolated roots OsAPC11_1 mRNA levels
increased while OsAPC11_2 levels decreased. These
results could indicate that, following gene duplication,

the APC11 and CDC23 genes are assuming new functions in rice.
The activators OsCCS52A and OsCCS52B exhibited
high levels of mRNA in darkness and OsCDC20_3
showed a lower level. One hypothesis for the high mRNA
levels of CCS52 genes is that the APC CCS52 acts as a
negative regulator of CYCA2;3/CDKA;1 complex in Arabidopsis [65]. The CYCA2;3/CDKA;1complex acts as a
negative regulator of endocycle and the APC activation
by CCS52 may increase CYCA2;3 degradation and consequently the progression of endocycle in darkness [65].
To investigate the expression of the APC genes and
activators during rice seed development, we examined
the expression of the APC subunits and activators in
endosperm, pericarp and inflorescence tissues (Figure
5A). Expression levels were measured in the inflorescence at reproductive stage 3 (before anthesis, 70 days
after emergency), pericarp and endosperm at reproductive stage 6 (milk stage, 90 days after emergency). Levels
of mRNA from all APC subunits were higher in the
endosperm, except OsAPC1 and OsAPC5, which were
present in higher amounts in the inflorescence. The
duplicated OsCDC23 genes displayed similar expression
profiles in the seed tissues examined. However, the
OsAPC11 gene seems to be differentially expressed;
OsAPC11_2 showed reduced amounts of mRNA in the
inflorescence when compared to the pericarp and endosperm. Using the Genevestigator Analysis tool, we compared the expression levels of the APC genes with qRTPCR results (see Additional file 14) [66]. Although only
the genes OsAPC2, OsAPC7, OsAPC10 and OsAPC13
are present in the microarray slides, their expression is
similar to what we observed in this work.
The expression patterns of the various APC activator
genes were analyzed. The OsCCS52B transcript was
expressed at low levels in the inflorescence and
OsCDC20_1 was barely detected in the same tissue.
Interestingly, transcripts for OsCDC20_2 and
OsCDC20_3 were detected in inflorescence, a tissue
with a high rate of proliferation, suggesting their involvement in mitotic activities [67]. The OsCCS52A had
high levels in the endosperm and this may be explained
by the fact that the transition from a mitotic to an
endocycle in endosperm cells involves a spike in activity
of the master cell cycle regulators belonging to the CDK
family and APC complex, which subsequently decreases
as endocycle progresses [68]. These contrasting expression patterns for OsCCS52 and OsCDC20 could suggest
distinct functions for these APC activators during seed
development.
Based on the direct relationship between the increase
of auxin and cellular proliferation we treated rice seedlings with naphthaleneacetic acid (Figure 5B). After
treatment for 2 and 8 hours, all APC and activator

Page 11 of 18

genes increased their expression. This result indicates
that the rice APC subunits and activators might be
involved in the regulation of the cell division events triggered by auxin in the seedlings.
We analyzed the expression in leaves of PtAPC10,
PtCDC27_1, PtCDC20_1, PtCCS52A1_1 and PtCCS52B
genes by qRT-PCR (see Additional file 2). Interestingly,
PtCCS52B exhibited lower mRNA levels when compared
to PtCCS52A1_1. Recent data suggest that the
MtCCS52B may have specific roles in M-phase progression, alternative or complementary to those of
MtCCS52A [69]. Thus, CCS52A might have major roles
in post-mitotic, differentiating cells, in which degradation of specific APC targets could contribute to differentiation of given cell types, tissues, or organs [70].

Conclusions
Through genome-wide bioinformatics analyses of the
complete genomes of Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, we
identified ortholog genes of APC subunits and activators. In addition, their occurrence was demonstrated in
algae, bryophyte and other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species as well. A distinctive feature of these
genomes is the presence of characteristic duplication
patterns (see Additional file 8). In Arabidopsis, only the
CDC27 gene is duplicated. Rice and poplar have two
duplicated subunits, CDC23-APC11 and CDC27-APC13
respectively. Among other plant genomes, grape and P.
patens have two copies of the CDC23 and CDC27
genes, respectively, and grape has two copies of the
APC13 gene. The two isoforms of CDC23 and APC11
genes in rice are differentially expressed in light-dark
grown plants and one of APC11 subunits is also more
expressed in the inflorescence than the other. In Arabidopsis, the duplicated copies of the CDC27 gene exhibit
significant sequence differences, and seem to have
assumed specialized functions, indicative of the occurrence of APC subcomplexes [23]. While the coding
sequences of the rice genes are quite conserved, it is
possible that their controlling elements have diverged
and that they are assuming new functions in the APC
during plant development. Paralogs usually display different functions, whereas orthologs may retain the same
function [71]. We tested the frequency of Ka/Ks for
CDC27, CDC23, APC11 and activators orthologous
genes and found interesting values (see Additional file
15). The CDC23 and CDC27 TPR genes had the highest
values (greater evolutionary pressure) and the activators
and APC11 subunit lower. These results reveal the
importance of maintenance of the amino acids conserved in RING finger proteins and the adapters. Analyses of the promoters of the rice subunit genes revealed
different regulatory sites for duplicated genes, suggesting
different regulation of their expression (see Additional

file 16). As expected, the most common cis-acting elements in all genes analyzed have functions related to
cell division. Strikingly, OsCDC23 and OsCDC23_1 and
OsCDC23_2 do not show any cis element in common
and only two cis-regulatory elements are found in both
OsAPC11_1 and OsAPC11_2. However, the OsAPC11
and OsCDC23 gene sequences present very little variation across taxa, possibly due to strong purifying
selection.
As in yeasts, APC7 is not present in the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, V. carteri and Chlorella
spp. The absence of this subunit at the root of animal
and land-plant evolution suggests that this subunit may
have appeared after a gene duplication event of a TPRcontaining subunit gene, and it may not be essential for
APC activity in unicellular organisms. Curiously, it
might be the case also in later metazoans, once Drosophila APC7 knockout mutant flies and null mutants are
viable and fertile [72].
The activators CDC20 and CCS52 have many copies
in plants. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in
metazoans, where only one copy of each regulator is
present per genome. Due to the duplications, Arabidopsis contains three CCS52 activators; CCS52A, CCS52A1
and CCS52B. In addition, six CDC20 genes were found,
but AtCDC20_6 is probably a pseudogene because the
important motif KEN-box is absent [12,73,74]. In poplar,
the CCS52A and CCS52B genes are also duplicated. Five
CDC20 genes are present in poplar, the same number
found in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, rice contains one
copy of the CCS52A and CCS52B genes; and three
copies of CDC20 genes. This suggests that the duplication of the CCS52 genes occurred in dicotyledonous
plants after the separation from monocotyledons. Recent
duplication of the CDC20 genes has occurred also in
Arabidopsis and poplar.
Plants can adopt dramatically different alternative
developmental pathways and must integrate cell-cycle
progression, growth and development in response to
environmental cues. It is believed that multiple members
of a specific gene family of a particular organism are the
natural products generated from the long evolutionary
history that the organism experienced [75]. The number
of members of a gene family reflects a succession of
genomic rearrangements and expansions due to extensive duplication and diversification that occurred in the
course of evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of the APC
subunits and activator proteins is very illuminating. The
fact that all subunit types except APC7, were found in
all plant genomes analyzed, including red algae, green
algae and other primitive organisms, suggests that the
complete set of genes encoding the APC subunits was
already present in the common ancestor of plants and
animals. The activators descend from a common

Page 13 of 18

ancestor and correspond to well-conserved structures.
In all algae species analyzed, there is only one copy of
CDC20 and CCS52 genes. Land plants have amplified
the number of activators and this fact may be associated
with substrate specificity and or with the complexity of
their developmental programs.
By comparing the similarity between different TPR
domains within one protein it might be possible to trace
the evolutionary history of the internal duplications. The
alignment scores between domains showed limited similarities among TPR subunits of AtCDC27, AtCDC16,
AtAPC7, AtCDC23 and AtAPC5. The sequence of TPR
subunits can diverge a great deal over time, limiting
their consensus motifs and making it difficult to detect
unambiguous duplication patterns for any of the proteins. Nevertheless, pairwise comparisons indicated
greater similarity for the central domains, especially
between CDC27 and CDC23, CDC27 and CDC16, and
CDC23 and CDC16. In all cases, higher similarity scores
between TPR subunits 4 in CDC16 and CDC27, and
TPR subunit 5 in CDC23 were detected, suggesting that
the TPR tandem evolution most likely started from the
middle domains. Because the primary amino acid
sequence of TPR subunits tends to diverge, the higher
degree of similarity among the central subunits may also
indicate that stronger evolutionary constraints are
applied to these regions.
Previously, we have shown that the Arabidopsis subunit genes are differentially expressed according to
whether the plants are grown in the dark or under light.
When Arabidopsis plants were grown in the dark, only
AtAPC1, AtAPC2 and AtCDC16 increased mRNA levels
[21]. However, qRT-PCR expression profiles of rice APC
and activator genes showed spatial modulation of gene
expression of the duplicated subunit genes in different
tissues (root and aerial parts) of plants grown under different light treatment. OsAPC11_1 mRNA accumulates
to higher levels in etiolated roots when compared with
OsAPC11_2 mRNA, and OsCDC23_1 mRNA is present
in etiolated roots at almost twice the levels of
OsCDC23_2. Likewise, the rice OsAPC11 genes are differentially expressed in the inflorescence, with activators
that have very complex expression patterns. Altogether,
these data suggest that the duplicated rice APC subunits
and activators could participate in different APC subcomplexes and that they may have assumed new specialized functions as they diverged during evolution.
Most E3 ligases are composed by one or two polypeptides [76]. In contrast, the cell cycle regulators SCF and
APC are formed by a larger number of subunits. However, for both complexes, biochemical activity can be
achieved by only two subunits, a Cullin related protein
together with a RING finger protein. In both cases, substrate specificity is defined by the adaptor subunit. The

Lima et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/254

human genome contains 69 F-Box proteins - the SCF
activator - and two APC activators, CDH1 and CDC20
[77,78]. In plants, SCF-related complexes are involved in
many physiological processes and approximately 700
F-box proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis [79].
The number of APC activators have also suffered an
expansion in the higher plant lineages, though a more
modest one, the number varying from nine in poplar
and Arabidopsis to six in rice. We and others have
shown that differential expression of APC subunits
could be a source of complexity in regulation of the
APC [21,23]. The results presented here suggest that
gene duplication, followed by sequence divergence and
differential expression, could be another tier of regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis mediated by specific APC complexes composed by particular subunit
isoforms. Future studies employing functional genomics
approaches will be required to define the impact of
duplications or splicing variants on cell-cycle progression at the cellular level and the associated plant developmental processes at the whole-organism level.

using the BLASTP and TBLASTN programs. In addition, Arabidopsis APC and activator sequences were
used to search against Zea mays, Medicago truncatula
and Saccharum officinarum EST databases at Gene
Index DFCI http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/
tgi/Blast/index.cgi. Sequences with significant similarity
to Arabidopsis proteins were downloaded into our database and annotated accordingly. Sequence conservation
analysis of APC and activators genes was conducted
using the BLAST tool with default curve calculation
parameters; amino acids sequence “conservation similarity” of 50%. Chromosomal locations of APC subunits
and CDC20/CCS52 genes were obtained using the
BLAST server and additional physical localization tools
of each genomic browser.
Identification of Protein Domains

The SMART database http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de
was used to confirm whether each predicted proteins
sequence maintains conserved domains and motifs. The
TPRpred http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tprpred search
program was used to confirm the TPR domain in specific sequences [81].

Gene Identification and Chromosomal Location

Searching of multiple databases was performed to find
members of APC, CDC20 and CCS52 in Arabidopsis,
rice and polar. The strategy to obtain each gene in a
genome was the following; Arabidopsis sequences have
been published [80], but additional searches were carried out against the TAIR8 database http://www.arabidopsis.org. The sequences obtained were then used as
queries to search against the following databases: Oryza

Phylogenetic Analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of TPR subunits and activators
CDC20 and CCS52 was carried out using the NeighborJoining method in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis software package - MEGA4 [82]. Alignment for
tree construction was done using ClustalW with the
Gonnet scoring matrix. Reliability of the obtained trees
was tested using bootstrapping with 2,000 replicates.
Exon-intron and TPR Domain

Exon-intron information was obtained from TAIR,
TIGR and JGI databases. The sequences of the repeating
domains were extract and aligned to each other using
the Smith-Waterman alignment tool in the EMBOSS
package and default parameters [56,57]. This gave pairwise alignment scores between all individual domains in
a repeat.
Plant Materials

Rice seeds (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were disinfected with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min and
thoroughly washed with water. For darkness treatment,
seedlings were grown hydroponically (0.5X Hoagland’s
solution) in a greenhouse at 25-28°C for 2 weeks. The
control group was grown with a photoperiod of 12 h
light/12 h dark and the etiolated group was grown in
darkness. For auxin treatment, seedlings were grown in
Petri dishes (0.5X Hoagland’s solution agar) in the
greenhouse at 25-28°C for 2 weeks. Seedlings were
transferred to new Petri dishes and incubated for 2 and

Lima et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:254

8 h in either water or 2 μM NAA solution. Harvested
seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
and store at -70°C until RNA isolation. Leaf poplar RNA
was provided by Rodrigo T. Lourenço (Forest Biotechnology Group, North Carolina State University).
Promoter analysis and significance calculations

To identify promoter regions of APC subunits, 1000 bp
of sequence preceding each annotated gene from RAPDB database were extracted manually. These putative
promoter sequences begin immediately upstream of the
5’ UTR for transcription units with an annotated 5’
UTR. To identify overrepresented promoter elements,
the putative promoter regions upstream of APC subunits were analyzed. Known plant promoter elements and
their annotation were downloaded from PLACE (A
Database of Plant Cis-acting Regulatory DNA Elements)
http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/[83]. For each promoter, the null distribution for each PLACE motif was
modeled by counting the number of occurrences for
each word within each of all rice gene promoters (1,000
surrogates) according to [84]. This approach provided
an opportunity to determine the level of consistency
between the observed frequencies in a single promoter
motif with that across all other sequenced gene promoters. A one-tailed p value was estimated for each motif
based on the Z score of the difference of the actual
word count for each promoter (Ctrue) minus the mean
count from the 1,000 surrogates (Csurr) relative to standard deviation (SD) from the 1,000 surrogates (SDsurr)
[i.e., Z = (Ctrue_Csurr)/SDsurr]. For each motif the p
value calculated was the probability to the right of the
observed count calculated on the null distribution from
all promoters from the genome. If this probability was
less than 5%, the motif was considered significantly
overrepresented. These calculations were implemented
using Delphi scripts.
Data Analysis for Ka/Ks

The ratio of nonsynonimous to synonymous nucleotide
substitution rates (Ka/Ks) was calculated as described by
Siltberg and Liberles [85]
Gene Expression Analysis

Oryza sativa japonica subspecies was used to prepare all
generic material. Total RNA was extract from materials
according to [86]. After treatment with RNAse-free
DNase I (0.5 u/μg RNA), total RNA (2.5 μg) was transcribed using random hexamer primers according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). The
cDNA was amplified using Taqman® Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem) on
the GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems)
under standard conditions. Transcript levels were
