Mychonastes afer HSO-3-1 as a potential new
source of biodiesel
Cheng Yuan1,2, Junhan Liu1, Yong Fan1, Xiaohui Ren2, Guangrong Hu1 and Fuli Li1*

Abstract
Background: Biodiesel is considered to be a promising future substitute for fossil fuels, and microalgae are one
source of biodiesel. The ratios of lipid, carbohydrates and proteins are different in different microalgal species, and
finding a good strain for oil production remains a difficult prospect. Strains producing valuable co-products would
improve the viability of biofuel production.
Results: In this study, we performed sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
of an algal strain designated HSO-3-1, and found that it was closely related to the Mychonastes afer strain CCAP
260/6. Morphology and cellular structure observation also supported the identification of strain HSO-3-1 as M. afer.
We also investigated the effects of nitrogen on the growth and lipid accumulation of the naturally occurring M.
afer HSO-3-1, and its potential for biodiesel production. In total, 17 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified
in M. afer HSO-3-1, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The total lipid content of M. afer HSO-3-1 was
53.9% of the dry cell weight, and we also detected nervonic acid (C24:1), which has biomedical applications,
making up 3.8% of total fatty acids. The highest biomass and lipid yields achieved were 3.29 g/l and 1.62 g/l,
respectively, under optimized conditions.
Conclusion: The presence of octadecenoic and hexadecanoic acids as major components, with the presence of a
high-value component, nervonic acid, renders M. afer HSO-3-1 biomass an economic feedstock for biodiesel
production.

Background
To meet the rising demand for energy resources and the
need to protect the environment, renewable biofuels are
needed to replace petroleum-derived transport fuels.
Biodiesel, from sources such as microalgae, has received
extensive attention in recent years, owing to its biodegradability, renewability, and lack of toxicity, among
other advantages. However, technical and economic barriers must be overcome to realize the potential of this
energy source [1-3].
Despite decades of development, the technology
remains in its infancy. For example, problems remain
with algal culture methods, inefficient harvesting of and
bioenergy extraction from microalgae cells, and poor
light penetration in dense microalgal cultures [1,4,5]. In

order for microalgae to become an economically viable
biofuel feedstock, the cost of producing biodiesel from
microalgae needs to be reduced [6]. Identifying a good
strain for oil production, which should feature high lipid
content, high biomass and tolerance to extreme environments, remains a difficult prospect [6].
It has been suggested that strains producing valuable
co-products, such as feed, fertilizers or pharmaceuticals,
would further improve the viability of biofuel production
[1,7,8]. To date, omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentanoic
acid, decosahexaenoic acid and chlorophyll have been
shown to be potentially valuable co-products of microalgal biodiesel production [9-11].
The ratios of lipid, carbohydrates and proteins are different in different microalgal species. In some species,
lipids can be up to 60% of the algal dry weight [12,13].
In one exceptional case, a lipid content of 86% dry
weight was reported for the brown resting state colonies
of Botryococcus braunii [14]. Factors such as temperature, irradiation, and most markedly, nutrient

availability, have been shown to be crucial to microalgal
metabolism, and high lipid productivity can therefore be
achieved by optimization of these factors [15,16].
The aims of this work were to discover new microalgae species with high lipid content, yield and suitable
fatty acids for biodiesel production. In our previous
work, we analyzed the biomass, lipid content and fatty
acid (FA) composition of 77 microalgae strains isolated
from Shandong province and Beijing, China. Strain
HSO-3-1 produced lipids up to 53.9% of its dry weight.
Meanwhile, fatty acid analysis of strain HSO-3-1 by GCMS indicated the presence of C24:1 (nervonic acid, 14.7
mg/g of total lipid, 3.8% of the total fatty acid content),
which has been shown to have potential in biomedical
applications. So we carried out further investigations on
strain HSO-3-1.

Results and Discussion
Molecular identification

The 18S rRNA gene and ITS sequences obtained for
strain HSO-3-1 were submitted to the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under accession
numbers JF930340 and JF930341, respectively. The
amplified 18S rRNA gene sequence was found to have >
99% identity with that of previously sequenced Mychonastes sp. and Pseudodictyosphaerium sp. strains in the
NCBI database. The 18S rRNA gene analyses of 26

Page 2 of 8

strains belonging to the genus Mychonastes clade
allowed the recognition of lineages attributable to 10
different species (Figure 1). On the 18S rRNA gene tree,
HSO-3-1 was found to be most similar to the M. afer
strain CCAP 260/6 (GQ477044.1). To confirm the
results of the 18S rRNA gene analyses, the ITS1-5.8SITS2 sequence of 26 strains belonging to the genus
Mychonastes clade was studied, and allowed the recognition of lineages attributable to eight different species
(Figure 2). Strain HSO-3-1 was again found to have a
close relationship with M. afer strain CCAP 260/6
(GQ477044.1) using this analysis.
Morphology and cellular structure

Cells of M. afer HSO-3-1 are unicellular, solitary and
spheroidal, and the cell size is very homogeneous, varying from 2 to 3 μm in diameter. The cell wall is smooth,
and has a layer of along the central axis when examined
under scanning electron microscopy (Figure 3, left). The
cell wall consists of a double layer (Figure 3, right). The
outer layer, which is 50 to 200 nm wide, was found to
be a trilaminar sheath, consistent with a previous report
[17]. Each cell has a single chloroplast that is crescentshaped and anchorage-dependent (Figure 4A-D). The
chloroplast consists of thylakoid lamellae arranged in six
almost parallel rows with pyrenoids (Figure 4A-D).
Reproduction takes place by the formation of two

autospores (Figure 4E-F). Lipid bodies are often present
in the cytoplast after cultivation for a significant period
(Figure 4G-H).
Cells of strain HSO-3-1 are single (seldom found in
colonies) and planktonic. The adult cells are spherical, 2
to 5 μm in diameter, with a thin mucilaginous envelope.
The shape of HSO-3-1 was found to be similar to that
reported for M. afer [18].
Morphological features of strain HSO-3-1, including
the shape of the cells, the composition of the cell wall,
and the shape and composition of the chloroplast, are
identical to those reported for the genus Mychonastes

[18] and the species Mychonastes homosphaera [19].
However, the autospore formation of HSO-3-1 involves
binary fission, and is different to that of M. h20omosphaera. The size of the cells is more homogeneous,
and the cell wall is thicker than M. homosphaera. In
contrast to the genus Pseudodictyosphaerium, which is
characterized as having a parietal, cup-shaped or girdle-shaped chloroplast without pyrenoids, the chloroplast of HSO-3-1 consists of thylakoid lamellae with
pyrenoids. Based on these molecular and morphology
characteristics, strain HSO-3-1 was therefore identified
as M. afer.

Fatty acid identification

The doubling time of M. afer HSO-3-1 was found to be
about 12.9 hours during the exponential growth phase.
After cultivation for 13 days, the microalgae were harvested and lyophilized. The lipids were extracted using a
chloroform-methanol-water solvent system, and then
converted into their methyl esters. The total lipid content of the strain was about 53.9% dry cell weight
(DCW) in BG-11 medium (1.5 g/L NaNO 3 ). The FA
composition of M. afer HSO-3-1 was determined using
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and
17 individual FAMEs were detected (Table 1).
The major FA component was C18:1, which
accounted for more than half of the total FAME content
in M. afer HSO-3-1. Biodiesel quality is determined by
FA composition [17]. It has been suggested that highquality biodiesel is usually composed of 18 carbon acids,
including oleic acid methyl ester and octadecenoic acid
methyl ester [20]. The major FAMEs contained in M.
afer HSO-3-1 were shown to be hexadecanoic acid
methyl ester, octadecenoic acid methyl ester and octadecenoic acid methyl ester, which accounted for over
57.6% of the total lipid content.
The second major FA was C16:0. The analysis also
revealed the presence of C24:1 (nervonic acid, 14.7 mg/
g of total lipid, 3.8% of total FAs), which has been
shown to have biomedical applications [21,22]. The production of nervonic acid by M. afer HSO-3-1 increases
the value of this microalgal strain for biodiesel production. Nervonic acid is a long-chain monounsaturated
FA, which is found in the seed oils of Lunaria annua

(honesty), Borago officinalis (borage), hemp, Acer truncatum (Purpleblow maple) and Tropaeolum speciosum
(Flame flower). Only Lunaria annua L. has been studied
and grown sparingly for future development as a niche
crop [21,22]. Therefore, the discovery of C24:1 in microalgae expands the variety of natural sources of C24:1,
and thus improves the potential value of this microalgal
strain in biodiesel production, as it can also be used for
pharmaceutical production [17].

The effect of nitrogen concentration on the growth and
lipid accumulation of M. afer HSO-3-1 was investigated.
HSO-3-1 was grown at different NaNO3 concentrations.
When the concentration of NaNO3 was in the range 0.15
to 3.15 g/l, the lipid content of the algae was between
41.7 and 51.9% DCW after cultivation for 14 days, with
the highest biomass (3.29 g/l) and lipid yield (1.62 g/l)
achieved when the concentration of NaNO3 was 3.15 g/l
(Figure 5). The highest lipid content (51.9% DCW) was
achieved at a NaNO3 concentration of 1.65 g/l.
The FA composition of M. afer HSO-3-1 cultivated at
different nitrogen concentrations was also analyzed
(Table 2). The major components were octadecenoic
acid and hexadecanoic acid. Octadecenoic acid content
ranged from 44.7% to 35.8% and decreased at higher
concentrations of NaNO3. Hexadecanoic acid increased
from 17.8% to 22.6% with increased NaNO3 concentration. Hexadecadienoic acid and octadecadienoic acid
both increased with increased NaNO3 concentrations,
whereas other unsaturated FAs displayed the opposite
trend. The ultralong FAs obtained from HSO-3-1 were
lignoceric acid, nervonic acid and cerotinic acid. Ultralong-chain FA content decreased at increased NaNO3
concentrations. Varying the concentration of NaNO 3
changed the lipid content of the algae and the composition of the major components of FAs.
The total content of lipids in microalgae may vary
from about 1 to 85% of dry weight [21,23]. Hu et al.
summarized the lipid contents of oleaginous green algae
reported in the literature, and found that oleaginous
green algae had an average total lipid content of 25.5%
DCW [17,24]. Nitrogen limitation/depletion has been
shown to affect both lipid composition and lipid content
of many algae [25]. The promotion of FA synthesis seen
during the decay phase was probably due to triglycerideFA accumulation [15,26]. Rodolfi reported that the lipid
content of Nannochloropsis sp. increased from 32% to
60% when it was transferred from ‘nitrogen-sufficient’ to

Conclusions
The naturally occurring microalgal strain M. afer HSO3-1 was found to be a good candidate for biodiesel production, because of its high lipid content, yield, and
content of suitable FAs and the valuable co-product nervonic acid. The effect of nitrogen concentration on the
lipid yield of M. afer HSO-3-1 was investigated in
photoautotrophic culture systems. Strain HSO-3-1 produced the highest biomass (3.29 g/l) and lipid yield
(1.62 g/l) when the sodium nitrate concentration was
3.0 g/l in BG-11 medium. Further research should study
the effect of other elements such as phosphorus and
iron on biomass, lipid yield and the cell-wall structure,
and also investigate how the nervonic acid content of
this strain might be improved.

‘nitrogen-deficient’ culture conditions. Usually microalgae accumulate lipids under nitrogen-limiting conditions, when energy and carbon sources are available
[27]. However, limitation or depletion of nitrogen did
not seem to induce lipid accumulation in strain HSO-31. Interestingly, using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), we found that the cell wall became thicker when
the size and number of lipid bodies dramatically
increased in M. afer HSO-3-1 (Figure 3, Figure 6). It is
unclear whether there is any correlation between the
cell-wall structure and lipid body formulation. Thus, the
metabolism of lipid accumulation in M. afer HSO-3-1
under different nutrient conditions should be investigated further. The lipid content of the new species, M.
afer HSO-3-1 was up to 51.9% DCW when the alga was
grown in BG-11 medium, indicating that the strain
could be used as a suitable feedstock for biodiesel
production.

our laboratory. The strain was grown in BG-11 medium
[28], and maintained at 25 ± 1°C under continuous illumination provided by daylight fluorescent tubes at 70 to
80 μmol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
photons per m2 per second.
Electron microscopy

For TEM, cells were fixed with 1% glutaric dialdehyde
for 1 hour, separated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at
903×g, then washed three times with phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2 to 7.4). The processed materials were fixed with
1% chenic acid for 1 hour and then washed three times
with phosphate buffer (pH 7.2 to 7.4). The cells were
dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol up
to 100% and anhydrous acetone. They were then soaked
in an anhydrous acetone:Epon812 resin (7:3) mixture for
5 hours, followed by an epoxy propane:Epon812 resin
(3:7) mixture for 6 hours, then Epon812 for 5 hours,
after which they were finally embedded in Epon812
resin. Photographs were taken under the microscope

(H-7650; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were
carried out at room temperature.
For scanning electron microscopy, the cells fixed with
glutaric dialdehyde were embedded using the GTGO
(glutaraldehyde, tannic acid, guanidine hydrochloride,
osmium tetroxide) technique [29], coated with gold, and
examined under a microscope (S-4800; Hitachi, Japan).
Genomic DNA preparation

Samples (3 ml) of cell cultures were harvested in the
mid-late exponential phase, and pelleted by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of
Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The mixture was mixed by
vortexing, and the genomic DNA was then extracted
(Fast-Prep 24 DNA purification; M.P. Biomedicals, USA)
[30]. The purified genomic DNA was used for PCR analysis. The 18S rRNA and ITS region was amplified using
universal green algal primers (Table 3), as described previously [31]. The distances within the phylogenetic tree
were constructed with the neighbor-joining method

was dried under vacuum (Lantian DZF-6050, Hangzhou,

computer program [32].
Induction of lipid production at different NaNO3
concentrations

Microalgae were cultivated in Erlenmeyer flasks to the
exponential phase of growth, then transferred to 500 ml
glass bubble columns (41 mm in diameter) containing
250 ml of BG-11 medium with different concentrations
of NaNO3 at a 1:6 (v/v) dilution, to maintain the OD750
value at around 0.2. The nitrogen concentration was
monitored during growth by measuring OD 220 and
OD275 after adding 0.02 mol/l HCl and 1.65 × 10-4 mol/
l sulfamic acid according to Feng’s method [33,34].
The columns were maintained at 25 ± 1°C, and
bubbled with sterile gas composed of air supplemented
with 2% (V/V) CO2. Continuous artificial illumination at
270 ± 20 μmol PAR photons/m 2 /s 1 was provided by
daylight fluorescent tubes on one side. All experiments
were performed in duplicate.
Growth was estimated by measuring the dry cell weight
(DCW). A 5 ml sample was taken every 12 hours and filtered through pre-weighed 0.8 μm microporous filter
paper. The filter paper was oven-dried overnight at 105°C.
The difference between the final weight and the weight of
the paper before filtration was taken as the DCW.
Lipid extraction

The microalgal cells were harvested after 13 days by
centrifugation at 4722×g for 10 min. Cell pellets were
lyophilized using a freeze drier (Alpha1-2LD Plus; Martin Christ GmBH, Osterode, Germany). The total lipids
contained in the algal cells were extracted with a modified chloroform-methanol-water solvent system [35]. In
a 10 ml tube (tube 1), 30to 40 mg dry algal powder, 4
ml chloroform and 2 ml methanol were mixed, and shaken for 10 seconds to disperse the powder. The tube
was then incubated for 12 hours at 30°C while shaking
at 200 r/min and separated by centrifugation for 10
minutes at 903×g, then 6 ml of the supernatant was collected and transferred to tube 2. Into this, 2 ml methanol and 3.6 ml deionized water were added to give a
final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 10:10:9. The
contents were separated by centrifugation at 903×g for 5
minutes, then the chloroform layer was removed, transferred into a pre-weighed tube (tube 3; weight 1) and

Methyl esters were generated from the microalgae lipids
by heating them in a 2% H2 SO4 -methanol solution at
85°C for 2.5 hours. Analysis of the FAMEs was then
performed using GC-MS (7890A-5975C, Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) with a fused column (30 m × 0.25 mm; HP-INNOWAX; Agilent
Technologies Inc.). The carrier gas was helium, and 1 μl
of the methyl ester sample solution was injected for
each analysis. The split ratio was 1:20. The temperature
program was as follows: the column temperature was
maintained at 50°C for 1 minute, increased to 200°C at
a rate of 25°C/min, then increased to 240°C at a rate of
3°C/min, and finally maintained at this temperature for
a further 15 minutes. The injector temperature was set
at 260°C. The identification of FAs was performed by
comparing the mass spectra obtained with Wiley
libraries. http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/
