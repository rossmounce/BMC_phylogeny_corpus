Abstract
Background: A key problem in the sequence-based reconstruction of regulatory networks in
bacteria is the lack of specificity in operator predictions. The problem is especially prominent in the
identification of transcription factor (TF) specific binding sites. More in particular, homologous TFs
are abundant and, as they are structurally very similar, it proves difficult to distinguish the related
operators by automated means. This also holds for the LacI-family, a family of TFs that is wellstudied and has many members that fulfill crucial roles in the control of carbohydrate catabolism
in bacteria including catabolite repression. To overcome the specificity problem, a comprehensive
footprinting approach was formulated to identify TF-specific operator motifs and was applied to
the LacI-family of TFs in the model gram positive organism, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. The
main premise behind the approach is that only orthologous sequences that share orthologous
genomic context will share equivalent regulatory sites.
Results: When the approach was applied to the 12 LacI-family TFs of the model species, a specific
operator motif was identified for each of them. With the TF-specific operator motifs, potential
binding sites were found on the genome and putative minimal regulons could be defined. Moreover,
specific inducers could in most cases be linked to the TFs through phylogeny, thereby unveiling the
biological role of these regulons. The operator predictions indicated that the LacI-family TFs can
be separated into two subfamilies with clearly distinct operator motifs. They also established that
the operator related to the 'global' regulator CcpA is not inherently distinct from that of other
LacI-family members, only more degenerate. Analysis of the chromosomal position of the identified
putative binding sites confirmed that the LacI-family TFs are mostly auto-regulatory and relate
mainly to carbohydrate uptake and catabolism.
Conclusion: Our approach to identify specific operator motifs for different TF-family members is
specific and in essence generic. The data infer that, although the specific operator motifs can be
used to identify minimal regulons, experimental knowledge on TF activity especially is essential to
determine complete regulons as well as to estimate the overlap between TF affinities.

Background
Numerous studies have been devoted to the identification
of Transcription Factor (TF)-binding sites or other regulatory elements in bacterial genomes. So far, most largescale approaches relied heavily on statistics and the input
of known binding motifs [1-7]. Unfortunately, purely statistical approaches are seriously hampered by the trade-off
that exists between a high true-positive rate and a low
false-negative rate of the prediction. Nonetheless, both
rates can be considerably improved by taking advantage
of additional data [2,8] like, for instance, sequence data
from related species [9-11], structural information [12] or
transcriptome data [13,14]. Another way to enhance the
accuracy is phylogenetic footprinting which takes both
'phylogeny' and 'synteny' into account[8,14-16].
We have recently developed a large-scale automated regulatory motif prediction method for prokaryotic genomes
[17]. It was applied with success in the identification of a
relatively large number of regulatory motifs in genomes of
the Firmicutes, a phylum that comprises many well-studied families like the Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. The
identified motifs included several new motifs besides
known ones. Nevertheless, in many cases the method
appeared less suited to couple a specific TF or signal to the
regulatory motif in a straightforward manner. For example, although the characteristic T-box motif was easily
identified – the T-box is a regulatory element that
responds to uncharged t-RNA [18] and is found in all Firmicutes – the amino acid specificity of that element was
not retrieved for the individual instances automatically
(Wels et al. unpublished results). Likewise, the 'CRE-like'
motif that was retrieved is very similar to known operator
motifs of various TFs of the LacI-family, suggesting that
the recovered motif is not specific.

tose [34]. This raises the question how these bacteria coordinate 'local' (def: control of the expression of one or a
few genes/operons) and 'global' (def: control of the
expression of many genes/operons) regulatory effects
using homologous TFs.
Thus, the lack in specificity of the current prediction methods is a key issue in case one wants to disentangle complex
regulatory relationships, like between those of the TFs of
the LacI-family and the operons involved in carbohydrate
catabolism. Therefore, we have formulated a comprehensive sequence-based comparative approach for the prediction of TF-specific operators in bacteria. Specificity is
ensured by building upon a proper phylogenetic classification of each family of TFs (whose members can for
instance be found in reference databases [35-37]) and
very strict criteria to define synteny.
The value of the approach was put to the test on the welldescribed LacI-family of TFs, and more specifically, to
uncover the regulatory connections of the 12 LacI-family
TFs in L. plantarum WCFS1. This species was chosen as a
representative of the phylum Firmicutes, as it is an industrially and medically relevant model organism that is
encountered in very different environmental niches, i.e. in
association with plants, fermenting food and feed, and in
the animal and human gastrointestinal tract [38,39]. The
approach proved successful and each LacI-family TF of L.
plantarum was linked to a putative operator motif and
thereby to a putative regulon. In addition, several principles that should govern LacI-family TF mediated 'local'
and 'global' transcription regulation could be inferred
from the results. Ample experimental and structural information was used to evaluate and support the predictions
and inferences.

Results
The LacI-family of TFs plays a crucial role in many bacterial species, and certainly in those of the phylum Firmicutes, as these TFs mediate preferences in the utilization of
certain carbohydrates over others. The prioritization
involves both repression (or activation) of catabolic genes
(i) in the absence (or presence) of a related substrate and
(ii) in the presence (or absence) of a preferred substrate
[19-21]. The latter process is referred to as carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and its main mediator in Firmicutes
species is CcpA [21-25]. CcpA operators were called CREs
(CcpA-responsive elements [26]) and a CRE consensus
motif was defined on basis of experiments in various Firmicutes species [21-23,25,27-30]. The consensus motif is
very similar to, and sometimes coincides with, operators
related to other TFs of the LacI-family [30-33]. Most family members, however, interact with only a few operators
on the genome, like LacI of Escherichia coli, which
represses specifically the lac-operon in the absence of lac-

I) A comprehensive approach to identify TF-specific
operators
It has been observed consistently that orthologous protein
sequences [40] are very likely to have molecular properties
that are alike [41]. Similarly, synteny – conserved gene
order – was found to be a strong indicator of functional
equivalency [42]. Thus, genes that are orthologous and
share 'gene context' can be assumed to be functionally
more equivalent than orthologous genes that are not syntenous. Based on this premise we formulated a generic
phylogenetic footprinting [43]/shadowing [44] approach
for the identification of TF-specific operator sequences in
bacteria (description in Methods). High specificity in the
motif prediction was achieved by properly classifying
orthologous TFs into groups that share gene context to
yield putative Groups of Orthologous Functional Equivalents or GOOFEs. To develop the approach, we chose the
well-described LacI-family of transcriptional regulators

(PFAM PF00356), limiting the analysis to Firmicutes and
focusing specifically on the model organism Lactobacillus
plantarum WCFS1, which has a high number of LacI-family TFs for which we have ample experimental and transcriptome data for validation.

using the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm (for relevant
data see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4). The resulting NJ-tree
indicated a clear separation between two subfamilies of
LacI-family TF homologs (top of Figure 1 and see Additional file 5). One subfamily represented the vast majority
of LacI-family TF homologs including CcpA, whereas the
other represented only 1 to 3 homologs per species. The
latter subfamily contained one well-studied TF from E.
coli, the evolved beta-galactosidase repressor or EbgR [45].
Henceforth, the two LacI-family TF subfamilies will be
referred to as 'CcpA-like' and 'EbgR-like'. The number of

The number of LacI-family TF homologs and the presence of Lactobacillus plantarum orthologs in different Firmicutes
Figure 1
The number of LacI-family TF homologs and the presence of Lactobacillus plantarum orthologs in different Firmicutes. The organisms are organized on basis of their phylogeny (left; inferred from phosphoglycerate kinase amino acid sequence data [98]) and
the TFs on basis of the NJ-tree of the L. plantarum LacI-family TFs (top). The presence of an ortholog to the L. plantarum proteins is indicated by open (different cluster in the NJ-tree) and closed circles (same cluster in the NJ-tree). The members of the
various L. plantarum GOOFEs are colored. Some orthologs have been experimentally characterized and are indicated by '+'.
remark: Although the PFAM HMM that is used to identify the LacI-domain represents only a small part of the DNA-binding
domain, in most instances there was complete correspondence between the number of LacI-family TFs identified by us and the
number listed by PFAM [96]. However, there were a few exceptions and in these cases the number given by PFAM appeared
erroneous [see Additional file 1]. In some cases the PFAM database was just incomplete (e.g. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides). In other cases sequences were counted twice as a result of double Uniprot entries (e.g. for CcpA in L.
plantarum). Other proteins were missing in the PFAM database because of mistakes in the ORF definition.

LacI-family TF homologs ranged from 2 to 17 and the
homolog composition was found highly variable between
different species and also variable between strains (see
Figure 1 and Additional file 1) and correlated roughly
with genome size. For example, although all 6 LacI-family
TFs of Pediococcus pentosaceus [46] were orthologous to a
LacI-family TF in L. plantarum WCFS1, only 5 out of 9
where orthologous in Lactobacillus brevis [46], another
close relative. Moreover, when the LacI-family TF content
of various strains of L. plantarum was analyzed – the data
were derived from a strain diversity analysis [47] – it
appeared that apart from ccpA none of the individual LacIfamily genes was present in all other strains. In fact, the
master regulator CcpA was the only LacI-family member
present in all sequenced Firmicutes genomes.
Determine synteny: Identification of TF-specific binding motifs
Inspection of the gene-neighborhood of the genes encoding LacI-family TF homologs in L. plantarum indicated
that most of them are associated with genes encoding proteins that catabolize carbohydrates. Although the gene
association appeared conserved in other genomes, it was
mostly only true for a limited number of species. A TF-specific GOOFE was defined for each L. plantarum LacI-family
TF on basis of context conservation and then the upstream
regions preceding the conserved operons/genes were
selected (see Methods for the precise procedure). Multiple
sequence alignments, motif-finding methods, as well as
visual inspection, were then used to identify potential
GOOFE-specific LacI-family TF operator motifs for all 12
LacI-family TFs (see Additional file 6). A first comparison
of the motifs, depicted in Figure 2, showed that the 'CcpAlike' and 'EbgR-like' LacI-family TF operators had characteristic yet distinct subfamily traits. The 'CcpA-like' operators carry a central CG nucleotide pair, whereas the 'EbgRlike' operators have only a single central C or G nucleotide. Moreover, within the subfamilies, the motifs
appeared to be discretely different in at least one position.
Validation: Comparison of the predicted motifs with experimental
functional data from literature
Compelling evidence that the recovered motifs were genuine and the approach was effective came from a comparison of the motif predictions with experimentally
characterized operators. In all cases that could be checked,
the prediction was in full agreement with the experimental findings. This was true for CcpA in Lactobacilli [48,49],
for the Lp_3470 ortholog LacR in Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subsp. lactis [50], for the Lp_3479 ortholog GalR in Streptococcus thermophilus [51] and in Streptococcus mutans [52],
as well as for MalR in Stretococcus pneumoniae [53], for
MalI in E. coli [31] and for ExuR in Bacillus subtilis [54] (see
Tables 1, 2 and 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/145

Validation: Comparison of the predicted with 3-D structure
information from literature
It also proved possible to use structural information on
the binding of several LacI-family members to their
respective operator [55-57] to validate predicted motifs.
Differences in the conservation of certain amino acid residues in the DNA-binding domain of the TF were compared to the composition of the connected operator. Two
clear correlations between protein sequence and operator
sequence were found (see also the legend to Figure 2):

- Firstly, the structural data suggest that, in the case of
CcpA and LacI, the conserved arginine located at position
24 is one of the few residues that hydrogen bonds directly
with one of the nucleotide bases, a guanine at position -6
of the operator [56,57]. In Lp_3661 (RbsR) and its
orthologs, the arginine is replaced by a glutamine (or leucine) and correspondingly the otherwise 'conserved' guanine is replaced by a thymidine. In fact, such a
replacement was observed for all other studied LacI-family TFs deviant at position 24 (see Additional file 7). These
anomalous TFs include MalI from E. coli which was
proven experimentally to indeed bind an operator with a
thymidine at position -6 [31] (Table 2).
- Secondly, the 'EbgR-like' TFs (i.e. Lp_3470 (LacR),
Lp_3479 (GalR) and Lp_3488 (RafR)) are expected to
have distinct DNA-binding features. Members of this subfamily lack the conserved leucine residue (position 60 in
Figure 2) that according to the 3D-structure of operatorbound CcpA [57] intercalates between the central CG base
pairs that are characteristic for 'CcpA-like' operators [22].
Concordantly, the predicted 'EbgR-like' LacI-family TF
operators lack the central CG nucleotide pair. Possibly,
the conserved arginine at position 24 interacts with the
conserved single C or G nucleotide in the operator (Table
3).
II) Identification of the biological role of a TF through
comparative genomics
The biological role of a transcription factor is to activate or
repress the transcription of certain genes in response to
the presence of a signal (e.g. a nutrient or metabolite). In
principle, once the sequence of a TF-specific operator is
known, a genome-wide search for the related motif could
be used to find putative TF-binding sites on the genome
and to establish the regulated functionalities (regulon).
The signal that triggers the transcriptional response can be
obtained by linking the specific TF to an ortholog that has
experimentally verified 'inducer' specificities. Finally, the
transcriptional effect (i.e. activation or repression) of the
binding of the TF can be deduced from the relative position of the putative binding site with respect to the promoter [25,58].

Figure 2
Left panel: Sequence motifs of predicted LacI-family TF specific operators in L. plantarum
Left panel: Sequence motifs of predicted LacI-family TF specific operators in L. plantarum. Right panel: The protein sequence
motif of the DNA-binding region of the LacI-family TFs per GOOFE. The numbering of the protein residues deviates slightly
from that in the various crystal structures. This relates to the fact that the alignment includes some gaps that are necessary to
accommodate all the LacI protein sequences that have been compared by us. The visualization of the sequences was created
using Weblogo [99]. remark: NMR studies have shown that the hinge helix plays an important role in kinking the DNA whilst
forming an alpha-helix (helix 4) and thereby stabilizing the induced fit of the recognition helix within the major groove of the
operator [33,81]. In fact, the 3D-structures of operator-bound CcpA and LacI implicate many residues of helix 3 and 4 in the
contact of the TF with the operator [56,57]. Moreover, the 3D-structures indicate that in both CcpA and LacI the same residues are involved. The DNA-protein contacts are indicated with triangles. The blue triangles mark the residues interacting
with the phosphate backbone and the red triangles mark the residues interacting directly with a nucleotide (the position of the
nucleotide is indicated in a box). In the case of Lp_0188 (SacR), a well-conserved guanine and corresponding cytidine are found
at positions -7 and 7 of the operator, respectively. This suggests that the operator recognized by Lp_0188 (SacR) and its
orthologs, is two nucleotides wider than that recognized by other 'CcpA-like' LacI-TFs. The 'EbgR-like' LacI-family TFs carry a
conserved insertion before helix 3 and seem to lack the characteristic conserved alanine and leucine (or methionine in the case
of RbsR) at position 60 of the hinge helix in the 'CcpA-like' LacI-family TFs. The absence of these residues coincides perfectly
with the absence of the central CG nucleotide pair in the predicted Lp_3470 (LacR), Lp_3479 (GalR) and Lp_3488 (RafR) operators.
Regulon predictions for the LacI-family TF homologs in L. plantarum
WCFS1
The 12 predicted specific operator motifs were used to
search the genome for potential TF-binding sites. For each
of the identified specific motifs an initial list of 30 to 100
putative binding sites was retrieved and the list was

reduced by application of a distance and similarity criterion to yield a few putative highly specific binding sites
per TF (visualized in Figure 3; data in Additional file 8).
Not surprisingly, the 'best hits' included those sites that
were used to create the search motif in the first place.
However, they also included multiple sites that were not

(b) This consensus is based on the experimentally verified operators listed in this reference

used as input. For instance in L. plantarum, new Lp_0172
(MalR) operators were detected upstream of the operon
comprising the gene lp_0172 (malR) and upstream of the
neighboring operon. Furthermore, the notion that autoregulation is an important feature connected to LacI-family TF mediated regulation [27,49-51,54] was confirmed
within L. plantarum, by the identification of a specific
binding site upstream of all LacI-family TFs with the
exception of Lp_0173, Lp_3488 (RafR) and Lp_3661
(RbsR). It is generally accepted that auto-regulation provides stability to a transcriptional network [59-61].
As expected, most potential binding sites were identified
upstream of operons that encoded functionalities related
to the catabolism of particular carbohydrates. In L.
plantarum WCFS1, 11 out of 12 LacI-family TFs were
found to be associated with active carbohydrate transport
systems (driven by protons: GPH family; ATP: ABC transport systems; or phosphoenolpyruvate: PhosphoTransferaseSystems). Furthermore, the size of the putative
regulons varied slightly. For instance, the putative regulon
of Lp_3625 encompassed only one operon, whereas that
of Lp_0172 encompassed five operons (Figure 3).
Although the putative regulon of CcpA was the largest, it
was still limited in size, which is slightly in contrast with
the global role of CcpA [21,24,25]. The precise composition and functionality of most of the predicted regulons is
discussed in some detail in Additional file 9.

The molecular function of LacI-family TFs and the connection with
the predicted biological role
The functional similarity between homologs can be
derived from a proper phylogeny of all homologous
sequences [41,62]. However, the low bootstrap support
for the 'early' branches in the NJ-tree of all LacI homologs
made it impossible to deduce functional similarities
between the members of different clusters of orthologous
sequences (Methods and see Additional file 4). It was
observed by us (Francke et al. unpublished results) and
others [63] that generating a NJ-tree of intra-species
homologs of specific functional domains is extremely
helpful to overcome this problem. To obtain putative
links with experimental functional data, orthologous
sequences linked with experimentally verified 'inducer'
specificities can be added. The branching pattern within
such a NJ-tree for the LacI-family TFs of L. plantarum (Figure 4 and see Additional file 5) and the bootstrap support
for that pattern, suggested clear similarities in the encoded
affinity for certain inducer substrates. It must be noted
here that 'inducer' does not necessarily mean that the
binding of the TF to the DNA is promoted by the particular molecule. In fact, in many cases the interaction with
the 'inducer' causes a release of the LacI-family TF from
the DNA and thereby a relief from repression (as shown
experimentally for MalR of E. faecalis [64]; SacR in L.
plantarum [65]; GalR in S. thermophilus [51]; and RbsR in
L. sakei [66]).

The identification of various additional sites whose presence should be expected (i.e. related to autoregulation or
regulation of genomically associated operons) supported
the view that the approach yielded genuine TF-specific
binding sites. Other support for the validity of the identified sites and regulons was provided by a comparison of
the functionalities encoded by the regulons and the molecules that induced the activity (or better: the in-activity)
of the related TFs. Figures 3 and 4 show that in almost all
cases a straightforward metabolic link existed between the
predicted regulated functionality and the assigned
'inducer' of the TF. For example in L. plantarum, Lp_0188
(SacR) is predicted to respond to sucrose or oligofructose,
a prediction that was derived from experimental evidence
obtained for orthologous TFs [67-69]. Concordantly, its
putative operators are found upstream of two operons
that harbor the genes encoding an active oligofructose/
sucrose uptake system [65] and enzymes that catalyze the
conversion of the phosphorylated oligosaccharide into
phosphorylated disaccharide and the phosphorylated disaccharide into glucose-6-P and fructose.
Some of the predicted regulatory connections could be
substantiated directly by published transcription data for
L. plantarum or related species. On the other hand, the predictions also could often not be extrapolated in a straightforward way. For instance, similar to the prediction for L.
plantarum, the expression of the ribose utilization operon
(rbsUDK) in L. sakei was shown to be controlled by RbsR
and induced by ribose [66]. Unfortunately, the induction
of other operons was not studied. Another example is provided by transcriptome data for L. plantarum grown on
short-chain fructooligosaccharides compared to glucose.

As predicted, expression of the divergon associated with
lp_0188 was induced under these conditions [65]. Nevertheless, the maltase/sucrase encoding gene lp_0174 that
was predicted to be controlled by Lp_0188 (SacR) was not
induced. This observation could very well relate to additional factors that are involved in the regulation of the
particular gene. An example of the subtle differences
between species is found for the regulation of the gal
operon (galK, galT and galE) and lac operon (lacS and
lacZ). In S. mutans [52], S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 [51]
and S. salivarius [70] expression of the gal operon, as well
as that of galM and the lac operon in S. thermophilus and
S. salivarius was shown to be controlled by GalR and
induced by galactose. Our predictions suggest that in L.
plantarum the gal operon is similarly controlled by the
GalR ortholog Lp_3479. The lac-operon in L. plantarum
however, was predicted to be controlled by a paralogous
LacI-family TF, Lp_3470 (LacR), that is absent from the
Streptococci, but which is present in L. acidophilus where it
was shown to regulate an integrated lac-gal operon [71].
At the same time, in some strains of another Lactobacillus
species (L. delbrueckii [50]) the lac-operon was shown
again to be controlled by an ortholog of Lp_3479 (GalR).
The mode of action: repression or activation
Although, the nomenclature of most LacI-family TFs hints
that their main mode of operation is repression (hence:
Repressor), for CcpA it has been shown that it can also act
as activator [21,23]. In Lactococcus lactis, activation by
CcpA was observed when the central nucleotide of the
CRE was located at position -31 or -21 with respect to the
-35-sequence of the promoter and repression by CcpA,
when it was located around positions -9, -4, +9, +19, +40,

A reduced NJ-tree of the inducer-binding domain for the LacI-family TF homologs of L. plantarum. The sequences of LacI-family
TF homologs with known inducer from other organisms were added for comparison [21, 34, 45, 50-53, 64, 67-69, 84, 100109]. Orthology is indicated by color-coding. The numbers accompanying the clusters in the NJ-tree represent the bootstrap

+50 and further downstream [25]. The characteristic intervals of 5 or 10.5 bases were ascribed to a helix-face
dependence of the regulatory activity. A similar dependence had been observed before in the activation of ackA
transcription in B. subtilis [72]. The footprints accumulated in Figure 5, indicated that most LacI-family TFs in L.
plantarum are indeed expected to act as repressor. Moreover, in all cases the predicted operators are found at the
expected characteristic positions with respect to the promoter.
Regulatory overlap between LacI-TFs
Another interesting aspect of the predicted regulatory connections that became apparent from inspection of the
footprints in Figure 5 was that many operons appear to be
preceded by multiple LacI-specific putative operators. For

example, the two neighboring operons involved in
sucrose/oligofructose transport and catabolism are preceded by two putative Lp_0188 (SacR) operators. It was
shown that transcription of these operons is indeed
induced simultaneously [65]. This observation fits the
assumption that one of the operators controls the transcription in one direction and the other in the opposite
direction. Conversely, two divergently transcribed genes
can in principle also be controlled by a single operator.
The latter was shown to be the case in the transcriptional
control of the gene levR and the operon levABCDX in
Lactobacillus casei [73] and in the transcriptional control of
the genes pepQ and ccpA in L. delbrueckii [74] and L. lactis
[25]. The genes pepQ and ccpA are similarly organized in
L. plantarum. Furthermore, upstream of the ccpA gene

Operators present in the neighborhood of the genes encoding the LacI-family TFs of the 'CcpA-like' subfamily
Figure 5
Operators present in the neighborhood of the genes encoding the LacI-family TFs of the 'CcpA-like' subfamily. For most TFs an
alignment of the upstream region is shown for the sequences related to one GOOFE. In the case of CcpA, CcpB and Lp_0172
(MalR), no proper alignment could be made with regions from other organisms. Potential CREs are indicated by orange bordered boxes and the LacI-family TF specific operators are indicated by differently colored boxes. The -35/-10 regions of the
putative promoters are underlined in purple and pink, respectively. The translation start is positioned at the right end and is
indicated in green, as is the putative ribosome binding site.
guished and every promoter seems to be connected to its
own CcpA operator. This finding is in line with the experimental evidence provided by [49]. Nevertheless, based
on the relative positions of the putative CREs, the effect of
CcpA on its own expression is extremely difficult to predict of hand. CcpA seems to act as activator as well as
repressor depending on the actual promoter.
The role of TF concentration
The molecular nature of the interaction between TF and
operator dictates that the actual binding of the two will be
dependent upon the activity (in the thermodynamic
sense) of both. Consequently, the occupancy of any binding site by a certain TF can be raised by raising TF concentration. In fact, a relatively high TF concentration is
anticipated for CcpA [21]. To get some idea of the relative

concentrations of the LacI-family TFs in L. plantarum, transcript levels obtained under different growth conditions
were inspected (see Figure 6). The observed transcript levels suggested that except for Lp_3625, all LacI-family TFs
are under some conditions expressed to relatively intermediate levels and Lp_0172 (MalR), Lp_0188 (SacR),
Lp_3531, and CcpB even to levels as high as, or even
higher than CcpA.

Discussion
A generic method to identify TF-specific operators
Every line of evidence sustains the validity of the approach
we have formulated to identify LacI-family TF specific
operator motifs. In all cases where a LacI-family TF operator has been characterized experimentally, our prediction
is in full agreement (see Tables 1, 2 and 3). And likewise,

Figure 6 absolute levels of LacI-family TF related mRNAs in various microarray experiments with L. plantarum
The relative
The relative absolute levels of LacI-family TF related mRNAs in various microarray experiments with L. plantarum. The related
array data were used before by [17]. Information on the determination of these levels can be found in the Materials and methods.

several correlations between the TF sequence (protein)
and operator sequence (DNA) that are anticipated on
basis of structural information [56,57] were retrieved perfectly. Moreover, the fact that a specific operator motif
could be identified for every LacI-family TF and that relatively few proper hits for these operator motifs were found
on the complete genome, is proof by itself. More non-specific methods inevitably would have yielded more degenerate motifs and more false-positive identifications.
In lactic acid bacteria many operons involved in carbohydrate catabolism are associated on the genome by the
gene encoding the respective regulator [75]. In fact, this
observation may be generalized for all TFs that are considered 'local' regulators. Our results indicate that especially
for these TFs, a distribution into Groups of Orthologous
Functional Equivalents will reduce the noise in the motif
prediction significantly. In contrast, as current automated
methods generate more degenerate motifs [17] these
methods are better suited for the recovery of binding sites
for 'global' regulators.
Characteristic motifs and the implications of degeneracy
As the interaction between TF and DNA allows for a certain structural freedom, a TF-specific operator is not necessarily a unique sequence but merely a collection of
sequences which can be represented as a motif or consensus sequence. The molecular nature of the interactions
dictates a distinct relationship between the affinity of the
TF protein for the operator DNA and their respective
sequence. As a consequence, a more degenerate operator

motif relates to reduced affinity. For example, the LacIfamily TF CytR in E. coli exhibits a more versatile binding
of operator sequences than LacI (i.e. has a higher motif
degeneracy). At the same time it was observed that its
affinity for the operator is much reduced when compared
to LacI [76,77]. Likewise, the affinity of the TF for the
operator was shown to be affected significantly by subtle
changes in the protein sequence [78] as well as in the
nucleotide sequence of the operator (for LacI: [79-81]; for
CcpA: [29]). Lehming et al. therefore [78] assumed explicitly that the interaction between TF and operator should
be concentration dependent. Ultimately, it is the relation
between the concentration (or better: activity) of active TF
and the rate of expression that determines key features of
the dynamics of the cellular response to internal and
external signals [82].
The predicted specific operator motifs of the LacI-family
TFs in L. plantarum exhibit relatively little degeneracy (>8
nucleotides fully conserved for the 'CcpA-like' subfamily;
see Figure 2) with one exception: the operator motif of
CcpA itself. Considering the above, and based on the fact
that in the 3D-structures of CcpA and LacI bound to their
respective operators the same residues are involved in the
interaction of TF with DNA [56,57], the degeneracy of the
CcpA operator motif indicates it should act at relatively
higher concentrations with respect to LacI and other relatives. Concomitantly, variable regulation of ccpA expression would represent a way to control the differential
binding of CcpA to CREs [21].

'Local' versus 'global' regulation
The identified CcpA operator motif (CRE) of L. plantarum
is very similar to the consensus CRE that was initially
defined for B. subtilis on basis of a site-directed mutagenesis study [29] and later refined on basis of the experimental identification of additional CREs [22,30] (CRE
consensus sequences are summarized in Table 1).
Remarkably, the DNA-binding domain of CcpA on the
protein level is considerably more conserved compared to
that of the other LacI-family TFs (see Figure 2 right panel),
whereas in contrast, the operator motif is the most degenerate. Both facts reflect and emphasize the 'global' role of
CcpA. We observed that the CcpA regulon that was
defined on basis of a genome wide search with the specific
operator motif was relatively small. The same observation
was made by [22] when the genome of B. subtilis was
searched for potential CREs for the first time. The authors
concluded that this related to the lack of degeneracy in the
search motif and they proved experimentally that this was
indeed the case.

It is generally assumed that transcription and translation
are connected processes in bacteria [83] and as a consequence proteins should be produced in the physical vicinity of where they are encoded. A major implication of an
intended local role of a TF would then be that the number
of TF molecules necessary to effectively control expression
can be minimized in case the affinity for the operator is
relatively high (signified by a less degenerate motif). As
mentioned in the previous section, all but one of the predicted operators indeed show a relatively high degree of
conservation over different, sometimes even distantly
related, species. A low TF concentration will keep in check
non-local interactions as the TF will be virtually absent in
the rest of the cell and, as a result, even operators that are
very similar will not be affected. In fact, it was shown for
carbohydrate utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus that
induction of catabolic operons is highly specific for distinct sugars [71]. Vice versa, a higher TF concentration,
like anticipated for CcpA [21], would relax the sensitivity
towards the composition of the operator and thus enable
binding to sites for which the TF has less affinity. However, transcript levels that are observed in L. plantarum
under different growth conditions are not completely
conclusive (see Figure 6). Nevertheless, based on the
observed transcript levels one should expect that Lp_0172
(MalR), Lp_0188 (SacR), Lp_3221, Lp_3531, Lp_3661
(RbsR), CcpB and CcpA in principle could regulate multiple and also distant operons.
Regulon boundaries and induced response
Searching the genome of L. plantarum with the identified
specific operator motifs yielded a list of potential bindingsites for every LacI-family TF. To avoid many false predictions, we have used two conservative criteria to reduce the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/145

list of putative TF-specific binding sites. They related to
the position of the site with respect to the translation start,
as there is experimental data showing certain boundaries
for that distance [21,23], and to a maximum number of 2
deviating nucleotides. The genes/operons preceded by the
putative binding sites thus should constitute putative
minimal regulons. In principle, more degenerate motifs
should lead to a longer list of compliant sites, as was
indeed observed. This observation, which was earlier
made by others [22], reveals a key point in regulon predictions based on operator motifs, namely motif degeneracy
complicates a straightforward decision about the authenticity of the recovered sites. Moreover, as described in the
above sections, binding will by necessity be influenced by
TF concentration (activity). Therefore, experimental data
on gene expression and TF concentration (activity) will be
essential to refine the predictions. At the same time, in
most cases, a proper interpretation of experimental transcription data will require motif and regulon predictions
because of the fact that the activity of many TFs is intertwined and the number of conditions tested or testable
too limited to untwine these. Although the extrapolation
of the predictions to experimental data is non-trivial, several of the predicted associations could be confirmed on
basis of data obtained in L. plantarum and related species
(see Results). Moreover, a comparison of the predicted
regulons depicted in Figure 3 with the environmental signals that are expected to govern the specific LacI-family TF
activities (see Figure 4) shows that the recovered connection make perfect biological sense. This finding strongly
supports the assertion that the predictions provide a valid
coupling between the LacI-family TFs and functionalities
encoded by the putative regulons.

Conclusion
We have formulated a sequence-based approach that enables the identification of TF-specific binding motifs. One
of the major advantages of the approach is that it is
generic and thus, in principle, can be applied to any TF
family without prior knowledge of the actual composition
of the binding motif. In fact, we are in the process of performing similar analyses for various TF-families, including two component systems, and the preliminary results
confirm the assertion. The method appears perfectly
suited to identify binding sites on the genome connected
to local regulators in contrast to current automated procedures that yield mostly sites connected to global regulators.
The presented data substantiate the successful identification of specific operator motifs related to the LacI-family
TFs in the model organism L. plantarum. The recovered
motifs differ in at least one position but at the same time
their similarity is considerable. As the composition of the
operator motif is tightly related to the affinity of the TF for

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:145

the DNA this finding implicates that some of the LacIfamily TFs could potentially bind to the operators of
another. In fact, the observed competition in B. subtilis TF
knock outs, between CcpA and CcpB in the repression of
the gnt and xyl operon [84], exemplifies this phenomenon. Simultaneously, higher TF (or binding site) concentration (activity) will result in regulation at degenerate
sites (i.e. lower affinity) (see [1]), a conclusion that correlates well with the mechanism of control of TF-activity
itself as this involves a change in affinity of the TF for the
operator upon induction [34,85]. An important corollary
is that regulons, and especially those related to global regulators, will vary in size depending on the environmental
conditions.
Finally, potential binding sites can be identified based on
the operator motif predictions and from those the functionalities that are regulated in response to a given stimulus can be reconstructed. In principle, the coupling of
putative regulons with potential TF inducers thus provides
insight in the prioritization of the functionalities within a
certain organism. Nevertheless, our data on LacI-family
TFs in L. plantarum makes perfectly clear that in order to
arrive at a complete reconstruction of the encoded transcriptional response to environmental stimuli, experimental data on transcription as well as TF and inducer
concentration under different environmental conditions
is adamant.

Methods
Resources and tools
All genomic information was obtained from the ERGO
genome analysis and discovery system [86] and updated
until the 1st of July 2007. Nevertheless, the presented
results do not depend on the use of this particular
resource and the methods described in this paper can as
well be applied using publicly accessible resources (like
those at NCBI [87]). The genome sequence of L. plantarum
WCFS1 and the functional annotation of its genes was
taken from our in-house annotation database [38]. Potentially homologous sequences were collected from the
database using the BLAST algorithm [88], with a typical
cut-off between 10-2 and 10-10. Multiple sequence alignments were made with MUSCLE [89] (default settings).
Alignments were visually inspected and aberrant
sequences were removed (characterized by many gaps and
a distinctly different conservation pattern). BioEdit [90]
and Jalview [91] were used to edit sequences, and ClustalW [92] was used to create (domain-) specific bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees (with 'correction for
multiple substitutions' [93]). The resulting trees were analyzed using LOFT, a tool that automatically divides the
sequences into orthologous groups based on the hierarchy of the tree and the duplication and speciation events
implied by that hierarchy [62]. Overrepresented DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/145

sequences in a selected set of upstream regions (300
bases) were identified automatically using MEME [94]
and MAST [95] was used to detect other potential TF-binding sites on the genome (default cut-off p-value < 10-5).
Identification of TF-specific operator motifs
A generic phylogenetic footprinting/shadowing approach
was formulated to improve the identification of TF-specific operator motifs. Compared to other methods the specificity of the motif prediction is increased by the
identification of orthologs proper and by taking into
account the modular organization of the bacterial
genome. The approach was applied to a model family of
TFs (LacI) in the model organism L. plantarum WCFS1.
The related flow scheme is depicted in Figure 7 and
described in detail below:
- Selection of a TF family, the collection of homologs and the
derivation of orthology (Figure 7 1–4)
Intra-species and inter-species homologs were collected
from the database using BLAST and the search was iterated
until no additional sequences were found. This search was
not only performed on the level of the complete sequence
but also with individual functional domains. The
sequences were aligned, aberrant sequences were
removed, a bootstrapped NJ-tree was generated, and the
hierarchy of the branching together with the bootstrap
support were considered to identify orthologs. In the case
of LacI-family members, the complete sequence of CcpA
from L. plantarum was used as a starting sequence, as well
as the N-terminal (first 90 residues; DNA binding
domain) and C-terminal (other residues; inducer binding
domain) sequence. To restrict the size of the final collection, only Firmicutes genomes were analyzed. The examined species included well-studied organisms such as B.
subtilis, L. lactis and S. thermophilus (see Additional file 1
for a complete list of analyzed genomes). To improve the
potential for functional identification the genome
sequences of several E. coli strains and Salmonella species
were also included. A striking feature of the NJ tree of the
Firmicutes LacI-family TF homologs was that the representation of the 'early' branching events came out very unreliable, as signified by the extremely low bootstrap support
(several values were as low as 1). In contrast, most
branches related to supposed more recent evolutionary
events had high bootstrap values in the NJ-tree and, as a
result, the LacI-family TF homologs could be separated
reliably into groups of orthologous sequences (see Additional files 4 and 5). The set of homologs identified by us
was compared to the entries in the PFAM database [96].
- Definition of functional equivalents (Figure 7 4,5)
Orthologous clusters can often be further subdivided to
obtain putative Groups of Orthologous Functional Equivalent s or GOOFEs. The homogeneity of the sequence

The TF-specific operator motif identification workflow
The TF-specific operator motif identification workflow. 1) First a particular TF-family was selected and 2) a prominent representative of that family was chosen. 3) The related sequence was used to search the genome of a particular species for intraspecies homologs. This search was iterated until no new sequences are recovered. A high e-value cut-off was employed to
ensure the recovery of all homologs. The sequences were aligned and a NJ-tree was generated. Both the alignment and the NJtree were used to determine the family or sub-family boundaries. 4) The procedure was repeated to retrieve all inter-species
homologs and the general features of the intra-species homologs were used to determine the sequences that were taken into
consideration. Orthologous relations between sequences were established on basis of clustering in the NJ-tree and a sufficient
bootstrap support (in green) for the clustering. In the case of Lp_0172 and Lp_0173 the orthologous clusters are color-coded
in brown and orange, respectively, and the other TFs of L. plantarum are indicated in red. 5) The genomic context of the various orthologs was inspected (legend bottom left) and in case clear differences existed, the orthologous groups were subdivided into different Groups of orthologous functional equivalents (GOOFEs), as illustrated. Then, upstream regions of the
conserved gene(s) in context were selected and inspected for potential regulatory sequences (the selected regions are indicated by colored triangles). The potential regulatory sequences were compared and those that showed similar features were
selected. In fact, only those sequences that showed the highest conservation were selected to determine a specific operator
motif. In the case of Lp_0172 and Lp_0173, a 'CcpA-like' operator motif was found up to 3 times in the upstream regions. The
sequences that were selected to determine the Lp_0172 and Lp_0173 specific operator motifs are displayed (Px indicates the
relative position of the selected sequence with respect to other similar sequences and relative to the translation start). 6) The
selected sequences were used to create a GOOFE specific operator motif. The thus identified specific motifs related to the
orthologous groups containing Lp_0172 and Lp_0173 demonstrate that the division into GOOFEs was essential to arrive at
highly specific operator motifs. Although the motifs within both orthologous groups are highly similar, they differ distinctly in
one position depending on the GOOFE. In the case of the TFs orthologous to Lp_0172, the motifs are strikingly different at
position +5, with a fully conserved guanine in the GOOFE containing Lp_0172 and a fully conserved thymidine in the other.
And in the case of the TFs orthologous to Lp_0173 the motifs are strikingly different at position -5, with a fully conserved thymidine in the GOOFE containing Lp_0173 and a fully conserved adenine in the other. remark: The gene/protein identifiers in
the figure are derived from the ERGO resource [86]. A conversion to other identifiers can be found in [Additional file 2]. The
functional annotation of the depicted genes were taken from the in-house annotation database of L. plantarum WCFS1 ([38]
and C. Francke unpublished results) and the ERGO resource. See [Additional file 9] for a detailed description of the functional
annotation in L. plantarum.

alignment (as indicated by conserved stretches of residues
and the absence of large gaps or inserts), a high bootstrapvalue at the branching point that separates the orthologous cluster from the other sequences (Figure 7 4), and
most importantly, a clear difference in conserved genecontext within the group were used to evaluate the necessity of such sub-division (Figure 7 5). In the case of many
of the LacI-family TFs of L. plantarum, the subdivision into
GOOFEs resulted in clearly distinct operator motifs even
within an orthologous group (as illustrated in Figure 7).
The protein sequences, alignments and trees can be found
in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Selection of upstream regions containing putative operators (Figure
7 5)
The observation that most genes encoding TFs seem to be
associated on the genome with the genes whose transcription they control may guide the selection of upstream
regions. The upstream regions of the conserved operons
within a GOOFE were used to search putative operator
sites (selected regions (see Additional file 6)). Only, in
case the TF encoding gene lay solitary on the genome the
upstream regions of the TFs from one GOOFE were used,
based on the notion that autoregulation is a common feature of many TFs.
- Motif definition (Figure 7 6)
Potential TF binding regions on the DNA (i.e. operators)
were searched automatically in the selected set of
upstream regions (300 bases) using MEME. As motif prediction tools often produce multiple motifs including
many false positives, an alignment of the regions was
made and the observed conservations were compared to
the automatically recovered motifs to remove most false
positives. The final collection of motifs was then compared within the complete TF-family and the TF-specific
motifs were defined based on conserved features, like
characteristic residues, spacing and motif length. The LacIfamily TFs are known to form functional dimers and as a
consequence the reported binding sequence motifs for
these proteins are palindromes of lengths varying between
10 and 16 basepairs [55,57,81]. Therefore MEME was
tuned to find inverted repeats (-pal option) with a maximum width of 20 bases and the detection of 4 different
motifs with zero or one occurrence per sequence (-ZOOPS
option). The resulting motifs were compared and for each
set of upstream regions (related to a certain TF) an operator region of 16 ('CcpA-like') or 17 ('EbgR-like') bases was
defined.
- Identification of putative TF binding sites
A specific operator and a position-specific scoring matrix
were created for each TF by application of MEME to the
defined operator regions. To avoid base preferences in the
scoring, a background file in which the probability of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/145

finding an A, T, C or G at a certain position at random was
set at 0.25. The final position-specific scoring matrices
were used as input for an automated genome-wide motif
search using MAST. Two additional criteria were used to
filter out potential false positives. Firstly, the vast majority
of LacI operators that have been identified to date can be
found in the range of -250 to +50 nucleotides from the
translation start, with no instances further upstream
[21,23]. Therefore, identified sites located more than 250
nucleotides upstream and more than 50 nucleotides
downstream of the translation start site were not considered. Secondly, all sites that deviated at more than two
positions in the central 14 nucleotides with respect to the
operators in the vicinity of the LacI-family TFs, were not
considered. The tables that resulted from the MAST search
have been deposited in Additional file 8.
Prediction of the inducer of TF activity
A bootstrapped NJ-tree was generated on basis of a multiple sequence alignment of all LacI-family TF homologs of
L. plantarum, together with orthologous sequences for
which experimental confirmation about the nature of the
inducer could be retrieved. TFs were considered equivalent in case they were clearly orthologous (strong bootstrap support), were syntenous and provided the
alignment was homogeneous (i.e. the absence of gaps and
several clear conservations).
Reconstruction of the mode of regulation
In principle, TFs can act both as transcriptional activator
and as repressor depending on the position of the operator relative to the promoter, upstream or inside/downstream, respectively [18,25,58,97]. To resolve whether the
TF acts as an activator or repressor, phylogenetic footprints were made for various upstream regions containing
an operator and its position relative to that of the potential promoter was determined. In case the alignment was
not clear, the predicted operators were used as an anchor
to realign the flanking regions for promoter detection.
Determination of relative mRNA levels for the LacI-family
TFs
Absolute expression data was obtained from 35 independent micro-array experiments with custom Agilent oligobased arrays of L. plantarum WCFS1 (this yielded 70 semiindependent datasets). The experimental conditions
tested varied from stress to over-expression of certain metabolic genes to growth on different oligosaccharides (D.
Molenaar, unpublished data; see also [17]). The raw data
were adapted as follows. The absolute signals of the spots
related to individual proteins were averaged and then the
signals were ranked independently for the two individual
channels. Per experiment and per channel, the 50 lowest
signals were discarded and the signals of the 200 proteins
ranked lowest in the remaining list were averaged. The

average was interpreted as basal signal and subtracted
from the signals related to the LacI-family TFs. Finally, the
resulting signals were made relative by dividing all signals
by the highest signal displayed by a LacI-family TF representative.
