Abstract
Background: The heads of annelids (earthworms, polychaetes, and others) and arthropods (insects, myriapods,
spiders, and others) and the arthropod-related onychophorans (velvet worms) show similar brain architecture and for
this reason have long been considered homologous. However, this view is challenged by the ‘new phylogeny’
placing arthropods and annelids into distinct superphyla, Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa, together with many other
phyla lacking elaborate heads or brains. To compare the organisation of annelid and arthropod heads and brains at
the molecular level, we investigated head regionalisation genes in various groups. Regionalisation genes subdivide
developing animals into molecular regions and can be used to align head regions between remote animal phyla.
Results: We find that in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, expression of the homeobox gene six3 defines the
apical region of the larval body, peripherally overlapping the equatorial otx+ expression. The six3+ and otx+
regions thus define the developing head in anterior-to-posterior sequence. In another annelid, the earthworm
Pristina, as well as in the onychophoran Euperipatoides, the centipede Strigamia and the insects Tribolium and
Drosophila, a six3/optix+ region likewise demarcates the tip of the developing animal, followed by a more posterior
otx/otd+ region. Identification of six3+ head neuroectoderm in Drosophila reveals that this region gives rise to
median neurosecretory brain parts, as is also the case in annelids. In insects, onychophorans and Platynereis, the otx
+ region instead harbours the eye anlagen, which thus occupy a more posterior position.
Conclusions: These observations indicate that the annelid, onychophoran and arthropod head develops from a
conserved anterior-posterior sequence of six3+ and otx+ regions. The six3+ anterior pole of the arthropod head
and brain accordingly lies in an anterior-median embryonic region and, in consequence, the optic lobes do not
represent the tip of the neuraxis. These results support the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of annelids
and arthropods already possessed neurosecretory centres in the most anterior region of the brain. In light of its
broad evolutionary conservation in protostomes and, as previously shown, in deuterostomes, the six3-otx head
patterning system may be universal to bilaterian animals.

Background
The brains of annelids and arthropods are similarly
composed of cerebral ganglia located above the foregut
and a variable number of associated segmental ganglia,

annelids, the cerebral ganglia develop, at least in their
largest part, from the neuroectoderm of the prostomium, the most anterior part of the annelid body. In
polychaete annelids with indirect development, the prostomium forms from the larval episphere, the upper half
of the trochophora larva (the apical “cap” anterior to the
primary trochoblasts forming the prototroch ciliary ring)
(Figure 1b). A smaller subset of cerebral neurons forms
from the peristomium, the more posterior part of the
developing head that contains the mouth and lies anterior to the first metameric segment. The peristomium
forms from the equatorial larval regions including the

larval foregut (stomodaeum), the prototroch and metatroch ciliary bands if present (Figure 1b) [3,4].
In arthropods, the cerebral ganglia are composed of
the protocerebrum and two segmental neuromeres, the
deuto- and tritocerebrum. The most anterior part, the
protocerebrum, can be further subdivided into a more
lateral region bearing, for example, the optic lobes
(archicerebrum) and a median region that includes, for
example, the pars intercerebralis (prosocerebrum). Most
authors think that the archicerebrum represents the tip
of the neuraxis [1,5-8] but this has been disputed [9-11].
So far, it is unclear how the arthropod and annelid
brain parts are related, if at all, and how they would
align along the anterior-posterior axis [7,8,12,13]. In
order to molecularly reassess this long-standing question, we have compared the expression of the anterior
regionalisation genes six3 and otx during the development of annelid, arthropod and onychophoran brains.

Results and discussion
To elucidate head regionalisation in annelids (Figure 1b),
we screened candidate genes for broad regional expression in the larval episphere and, at later developmental
stages, in the prostomium. Previous studies identified
molecular markers for sub-regions of the episphere and
prostomium (for example, Pdu-rx, Pdu-nk2.1, Pdu-pax6)
[14], for the equatorial ciliary girdle and mouth region
giving rise to the non-metameric peristomium (Pdu-otx)
[15,16], and for the posteriorly adjacent larval segment
giving rise to the segmented trunk neuroectoderm
(gbx [15] and hox [17]; Figure 1b). In order to identify a

broad regionalisation marker for the anterior-most prostomium, we tested six3, because in vertebrates the spatially restricted expression of this gene demarcates the
most anterior neural plate region [18] and is required
for the formation of anterior structures [19]. six3 also
demarcates the anterior body section of the enteropneust Saccoglossus [20] (Figure 1c) and of the sea urchin
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larvae [21], consistent
with a conserved role in the specification of the front
end of the body. In the marine annelid Platynereis
dumerilii (Polychaeta, Phyllodocida), Pdu-six3 (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1a) indeed proved to
be a specific marker for almost the entire episphere,
expressed at early (Figure 2a, c, d) and late larval stages
(Figure 2e and Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure
2a, c). None of more than 100 other transcription factors tested showed a similarly broad and contiguous
episphere-specific expression ([22] and data not shown).
The broad apical domain of Pdu-six3 expression (Figure
2a, c, d) includes the anlagen of the antennae and palpae and is surrounded by the ring-like peristomial
expression of Pdu-otx [16] (Figure 2b-d, Additional file
1: Supplementary Figure 2b, l), which covers equatorial/
peristomial larval regions and overlaps with six3 in the
periphery of the episphere (Figure 2d-f). The developing
prostomium thus includes six3+ and six3+/otx+ coexpressing parts, while the peristomium expresses otx
only (Figure 1b). Both six3+ and otx+ cells include
neural progenitors and differentiating neurons as evidenced by co-expression with differentiation markers at
48 hpf (data not shown). As the positions of the mouth

and eyes have often been used as landmarks to align the
annelid and arthropod body regions, we also tried to
affiliate the origin of these structures to the six3+ or otx+
regions. In Platynereis, Pdu-six3 is expressed in the stomodaeal roof (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure 2 a,
c), while the stomodaeal Pdu-otx expression starts
broadly and becomes more restricted to single cells during later stages (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure
2b, d). Thus, the stomodaeum is of mixed quality, but
has its opening clearly surrounded by the otx+ peristomial region (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2a,
b, yellow arrowheads). At 24 hpf, the Pdu-tryptophane2,3-dioxygenase-expressing rhabdomeric larval eyes
express Pdu-otx (Additional file 1: Supplementary
Figure 2l) but not Pdu-six3 (not shown). While the early
Pdu-six3+ region is almost devoid of Pdu-otx expression,
both genes overlap more broadly at later larval stages
(Figure 2a-d, Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2c, d
and data not shown) in brain regions that include the
Pdu-r-opsin+ adult eyes [23] (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2 l, m and data not shown). Thus, otx
expression is shared by all eyes in Platynereis (as it is
in Drosophila), while only a subset expresses additional
six3, for example the Platynereis adult eyes (similar to
the Drosophila compound eyes that express and
require six3/optix [24]).
To obtain independent evidence that six3 plays a conserved role in outlining the most anterior head region in
annelids, we cloned and investigated the expression of
otx and six3 orthologs (Additional file 1: Supplementary
Figure 1) in the oligochaete annelid Pristina longiseta
that asexually reproduces by fission into chains of individuals that each regenerate a full anterior-posterior axis
[25]. During early fission, both genes are expressed in
stripes at the putative anterior part of the newly forming
head in the middle of a segment (Figure 2g, h). At this
stage, we were technically not able to resolve whether
Plo-six3 lies anterior of Plo-otx. However, in later stages,
using the developing antennae for spatial reference, we
indeed observed a single patch of Plo-six3 expressing
cells at the tip of a newly forming individual (Figure 2i),
in front of otx expressing cells [26] (Figure 2k).
We next tested whether a similar sequence of six3+
and otx+ regions also hallmarks the anterior end of the
arthropod body (Figure 3). In the fly Drosophila, we
found that optix/six3 indeed lies anterior of, and partly
overlaps with, orthodenticle/otx expression at stage 6
(late blastoderm) and stage 11 (elongated germ band)
(Figure 3a-c). However, since anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila is known as being evolutionarily modified, we studied the beetle Tribolium castaneum where
an otx gene ortholog forms part of a more ancestral
anterior patterning system [27]. The expression of Tcsix3 (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1a)

demarcates a region at the tip of the germ rudiment
[28], anteriorly adjacent to the expression region of Tcotd1 (Figure 3d), which is the only beetle otx paralog
expressed at early stages [29]. At the elongated germband stage, the Tc-six3 (Figure 3e) and Drosophila six3
(Figure 3b, c) expression regions are very similar and
remain located at the anterior-median edge of the

germband, including the labrum (Figure 3b, e), anterior
brain neuroectoderm (Figure 3b, e) and corresponding
neuroblasts (Figure 3c) [28] and is later also found in
the developing stomodaeal roof (not shown). This result
suggests that the role of six3 as a regional specification
gene for the formation of the most anterior head and
brain region, as shown in Drosophila and vertebrates, is

Steinmetz et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:14

conserved throughout Bilateria [19,30]. To validate evolutionary conservation of the anterior six3 region in
other panarthropods, we isolated the six3 and otx orthologues (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1) from
the centipede Strigamia maritima (Stm-six3, Stm-otx)
and from the velvet worm Euperipatoides kanangrensis
(Eka-six3, Eka-otx) and for both species found six3
expressed in an anterior-median region at the tip of the
germband and at later stages (Figure 3f, h and Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2e, g, i), while otx is
mostly confined to more posterior and lateral coordinates (Figure 3g,i and Additional file 1: Supplementary
Figure 2f, h, k). In Euperipatoides, the Eka-six3 domain
includes the antennal anlagen, while the eye anlagen,
as in other panarthropods, lie within the more lateral
Eka-otx+ domain (Figure 3h-i’, Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2i, k) [31,32]. As in Platynereis and
Drosophila (Figure 3b), the mouth opening lies within a
ventral patch of otx expressing cells (Figure 3i, i’, yellow
arrowheads). At late Strigamia stages, the mouth opening is broadly surrounded by six3 expression, but also
expresses otx at the posterior border (Additional file 1:
Supplementary Figure 2g, h). For Euperipatoides and
Strigamia, the embryonic origin of the cells giving rise
to the mouth is unclear.
What is the fate of the six3+ region in the diverse
groups? In vertebrates, one prominent site of six3
activity is the developing hypothalamus [18,33]. Since
in Platynereis, Pdu-six3 expression broadly covers the
medial brain anlagen, it includes a large part of the
early differentiating neurosecretory cells recently identified in the 48 hpf Platynereis brain anlage [14] (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 2c and data not
shown). In insects, the neurosecretory pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis also originate from an anteriormedian head position suggesting their origin from a
six3-expressing region [34,35]. To validate this, we
mapped six3/optix expression in the Drosophila head
ectoderm and in brain neuroblasts (Figure 3b, c and
Figure 4) [36]. We indeed found that the Six3+ dorsal
brain region includes the developing Dchx1+ pars
intercerebralis (Figure 4a-a’’, d) and the Fas2+ pars
lateralis (Figure 4b-b’’, d), both also positive for the
invaginating placode marker Crumbs (Figure 4c, c’, d)
[35]. Thus, the anlagen for the neurosecretory pars
intercerebralis and pars lateralis lie within the six3+
region (Figure 3).

Conclusions
Our comparative expression data shows that the developing annelid, arthropod and onychophoran heads comprise an anterior-most six3+ region and a more
posterior otx+ region. Both regions are overlapping to a
variable degree but show a clear anterior-to-posterior

Page 5 of 9

sequence, allowing cross-phylum alignment of head
regions. In arthropods, the six3+ and otx+ head regions
give rise to the protocerebrum and to the eyes (Figure
1a). In annelids, the six3+and otx+ regions cover the
developing prostomium and the peristomium, from
which the cerebral ganglia and eyes (and chemosensory
appendages) develop (Figure 1b), but the six3/otx-based
molecular subdivision does not fully match the morphological partition. While neuroectodermal six3 is
restricted to the larval episphere and thus to the prostomium, the more posterior/equatorial otx expression covers the peristomium but also part of the prostomium
where it overlaps with six3. Our data thus align annelid
cerebral ganglia with arthropod protocerebrum (that is,
the most anterior part of the arthropod cerebral ganglia,
see “Background”).
Many authors have argued that the most anterior
structures in the arthropod brain are the anterior-lateral
regions mainly consisting of the optic lobe [1,5-8].
These ocular regions largely coincide with the otx+
region (Figure 1a). Yet, the clear anterior location of the
six3+ region in the early embryos of diverse arthropods,
together with the role of six3 in defining the most anterior structures in other phyla, strongly suggest that it is
this median six3+ region, giving rise to the neurosecretory pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis that represents the most anterior extreme of the arthropod brain
(arrow in Figure 1a) and corresponds to the neurosecretory brain parts in annelids. This has hitherto been a
minority view [9-11]. As the terms “archicerebrum” and
“prosocerebrum” are tightly connected with the Articulata theory - unsupported by almost all molecular phylogenies - and have been inconsistently used to include
different brain regions, we suggest abandoning these
terms. Instead, our comparative studies reveal the existence of a conserved, ancient neurosecretory brain part
at the tip of the neuraxis (Figure 1). It is followed by a
more posterior part of the head (and brain) anlage
expressing otx that often exhibits an early ring or arclike pattern [29,37,38], consistent with the radial head
hypothesis [39], and includes the eye anlagen (Figure 1).
In the animals investigated, the position of the mouth
opening is not reliably connected to the six3 or otx
region: while it comes to lie within the otx region of
Platynereis and onychophorans, its origin in arthropods
is unclear. The fact that the annelid and onychophoran
antennae develop from the six3+ region, in contrast to
the arthropod antennae that develop posterior to the otx
+ protocerebrum, is consistent with the previous
assumption of homology between annelid and onychophoran antennae, but not with arthropod antennae [13].

region in front of otx+ and hox+ regions in protostomes

series may be universal to bilaterian animals.

Methods
Animal culture and collecting

Platynereis larvae obtained from an established breeding
culture at EMBL, Heidelberg. Strigamia maritima eggs
collected at Brora, Scotland (June 2006). Fly strains:
Oregon R (wildtype). Female Euperipatoides kanangrensis Reid, 1996 were collected from decomposing logs of
Eucalyptus trees in Kanangra Boyd National Park, NSW,
Australia (33° 59’S 150° 08’E). Females were kept in containers with dampened sphagnum moss at 13°C and
were fed crickets once every second week. Gravid
females were relaxed and killed with ethyl acetate
vapour from October to December in order to acquire
embryos of correct stages. Embryos were dissected from
the females in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and, after
removal of the egg membranes, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C. Fixed embryos were dehydrated in a graded series of methanol (25, 50, 75% in
PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 minutes each) and
stored in 100% methanol at -20°C.
Cloning of six3, otx and tryptophane-2,3-dioxygenase
genes

All primers, PCR programs and template DNA source
are given in Additional file 2. Tc-six3 gene was identified
by in silico analysis of the Tribolium genome and amplified from a mixed stages (0 to 24h) cDNA library. Full
length Pdu-six3 was isolated by screening a 48 h l-ZAP
phage library (provided by C. Heimann, Mainz). Pdutryptophane-2,3-dioxygenase gene was identified during
a sequencing screen of a 48 h Platynereis EST library.
Gene orthology was confirmed by using NCBI Protein
BLAST, MUSCLE [40] multiple sequence alignments
and CLUSTALX v.2 neighbour-joining phylogenetic
analysis [41] for complete proteins.
