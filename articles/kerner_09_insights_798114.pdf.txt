Abstract
Background: An important issue concerning the evolution of duplicated genes is to understand
why paralogous genes are retained in a genome even though the most likely fate for a redundant
duplicated gene is nonfunctionalization and thereby its elimination. Here we study a complex
superfamily generated by gene duplications, the snail related genes that play key roles during animal
development. We investigate the evolutionary history of these genes by genomic, phylogenetic, and
expression data studies.
Results: We systematically retrieved the full complement of snail related genes in several
sequenced genomes. Through phylogenetic analysis, we found that the snail superfamily is
composed of three ancestral families, snail, scratchA and scratchB. Analyses of the organization of
the encoded proteins point out specific molecular signatures, indicative of functional specificities
for Snail, ScratchA and ScratchB proteins. We also report the presence of two snail genes in the
annelid Platynereis dumerilii, which have distinct expression patterns in the developing mesoderm,
nervous system, and foregut. The combined expression of these two genes is identical to that of
two independently duplicated snail genes in another annelid, Capitella spI, but different aspects of
the expression patterns are differentially shared among paralogs of Platynereis and Capitella.
Conclusion: Our study indicates that the snail and scratchB families have expanded through
multiple independent gene duplications in the different bilaterian lineages, and highlights potential
functional diversifications of Snail and ScratchB proteins following duplications, as, in several
instances, paralogous proteins in a given species show different domain organizations. Comparisons
of the expression pattern domains of the two Platynereis and Capitella snail paralogs provide
evidence for independent subfunctionalization events which have occurred in these two species.
We propose that the snail related genes may be especially prone to subfunctionalization, and this
would explain why the snail superfamily underwent so many independent duplications leading to
maintenance of functional paralogs.

Background
When dealing with the evolution of large gene families, an
ideal framework is to use resolved and comprehensive
phylogenies both of the species concerned and of the different genes involved. This is even more necessary when
one wants to assess the ancestral function of the first representatives of a gene family. Indeed, involvement of
some gene families in conserved developmental processes
can highlight the evolutionary history of particular structures, but incautious established phylogenies can lead to
dubious conclusions especially when paralogous relationships between gene representatives in one species are
overlooked. Besides, careful phylogenies of gene families
with multiple representatives in many species can yield
interesting results concerning the molecular evolution of
genes, in particular with regard to gene duplication events.
An interesting example of a large and complex gene family
is represented by the snail genes encoding C2H2 zinc fingers transcription factors [1,2]. Since the cloning in Drosophila melanogaster of the snail gene [3] – the founding
member of the family – numerous snail related genes were
isolated in many metazoan species belonging to Arthropods (e.g. [4-7]), Nematodes [4], Vertebrates (e.g. [1,815]), non-vertebrate Deuterostomes (e.g. [16-19]), Cnidarians (e.g. [20-22]), and Lophotrochozoans [23-25]. In
many species, more than one snail related gene was found,
indicating the occurrence of gene duplication events. In
Drosophila for example, in addition to snail, five paralogs
were found, two with important sequence similarity to
snail, escargot and worniu [26,27], and three more, scratch
[28], scratch-like 1 and scratch-like 2 [1] that are more distantly related to snail paralogs than to each other. Similarly, in vertebrate species, multiple snail-like and scratchlike genes were identified, e.g. the three mouse snail-like
and two scratch-like genes (reviewed in [1,2]). Based on
molecular phylogenetic analyses as well as careful examination of the exon/intron organization of the genes and
domain organization of the proteins, it has been suggested that snail related genes form a superfamily consisting of two independent families, snail (stricto sensu) and
scratch, established early during bilaterian evolution and
accompanied by increased complexity through duplication events in several bilaterian lineages [1,2].
The complexity of the snail superfamily is exemplified
when assessing the different functions of these genes. snail
genes seem to play numerous and seemingly unrelated
roles during development. In Drosophila, for example,
snail is expressed from the early syncitial blastoderm to
late stages of development, and is involved in the formation of numerous structures and tissues, such as the
invaginating mesoderm[3,29], the anterior and posterior
midgut [29,30], the wing, haltere and genital imaginal
discs [31], as well as the Central and Peripheral Nervous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/94

System (CNS and PNS) in which snail acts in both neural
precursors, such as Neuroblasts (NBs) and Ganglion
Mother Cells (GMCs), and postmitotic neurons
[26,32,33]. In several of these tissues, snail has redundant
roles with its paralogs, for example with escargot in the
wing and haltere discs [31] and with both escargot and
worniu in the CNS and PNS [26,32,33]. In agreement with
their involvement in the formation of very diverse structures, Drosophila snail/escargot/worniu genes function in
several cellular processes, such as the control of cell shape
changes, cell movements, asymmetric cell divisions, cell
fate specification and cell differentiation (e.g.
[29,31,32,34-36]). scratch is mainly expressed in the
developing nervous system formation and has been
shown to promote neuronal development in the CNS
[28].
snail genes (but not scratch genes) have been studied in a
few other protostome species and their expression patterns, while showing some similarities, are not easily comparable with those of Drosophila snail genes. In the short
germ-band insect Tribolium castaneum, a snail ortholog
expression has been shown in the early invaginating mesoderm, like in Drosophila, but no other expression sites
have been reported [5]. In the spiders Cupiennius salei and
Achaearanea tepidariorum, a single snail gene has been isolated and its expression and function seem to be restricted
to the formation of the nervous system [6,7]. In the mollusk Patella vulgata, the two isolated snail genes seem to be
only expressed in unknown ectodermal derivatives [25],
while in the annelids Helobdella robusta and Capitella sp.I,
snail genes are expressed in the developing nervous system, parts of the gut, and the differentiating mesoderm
[23,24]. Much more is known about vertebrate snail genes
that have been shown to have multiple roles during development [1,2,37]. This includes control of neural crest
specification and delamination, mesoderm specification,
left-right asymmetry, the triggering of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), and the development of limbs,
lens and some mesodermal derivatives (e.g.
[1,2,9,11,37,38]). In most of these processes, snail genes
are involved in the control of cell movements and behaviors which has been proposed as the unifying theme of
snail genes functions, not only in vertebrates, but also
more generally in all bilaterians, as in many instances snail
genes are expressed in migrating, invaginating or delaminating cells and are responsible for these specific cell
behaviors (reviewed in [2,37]). Strikingly, expressions
consistent with this type of functions have been described
in cnidarians where snail genes are expressed in the invaginating endoderm of a sea anemone [20,21] and in internalized mesenchymal-like cells of a jellyfish [22],
suggesting a possible ancestral role of snail genes in the
regulation of cell motility among metazoans.

Several previously published studies addressed the evolution of the snail superfamily in metazoans [1,2,12,19,37].
In this article, we significantly extend these analyses by
systematically retrieving the full complement of snail
related genes in several newly-sequenced genomes as well
as many previously cloned genes from this superfamily.
We also cloned two snail related genes from the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Pdu-snail1 and Pdusnail2). We conducted multiple phylogenetic analyses on
this large dataset and thoroughly analyzed the protein
domain organization of the Snail related proteins. Our
study allowed us to conclude that (i) the snail superfamily
can be subdivided into three distinct families, snail,
scratchA and scratchB, the latter two forming the larger
scratch family; (ii) many independent duplications
occurred throughout the evolutionary history of the snail
superfamily and changes in the domain organization of
the proteins are associated with some duplications. We
also studied the expression patterns of Pdu-snail1 and Pdusnail2 and found that these genes are expressed in distinct
patterns in the developing mesoderm and nervous system,
suggesting bilaterian-wide conservation of snail functions
in these tissues. In addition, the comparison of Platynereis
snail genes expression patterns with those of their
orthologs in another annelid,Capitella sp.I, highlights a
striking example of expression patterns swapping among
paralogs, suggestive of the occurrence of subfunctionalization events.

Results and discussion
The snail superfamily in metazoans
As the starting point of this study, we cloned two putative
snail genes in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii by PCR
using degenerated primers and RACE protocols (see Methods). We then used these sequences, as well as known
snail and scratch genes from arthropods and vertebrates, as
seeds in systematic BLAST searches to retrieve snail superfamily representatives in several metazoan species, in particular species for which fully-sequenced genomes are
available. This led to the identification of 89 snail related
sequences (snail and scratch families altogether) from various species covering the main animal lineages, 10 ecdysozoan species (1 nematode and 9 arthropods – 7 insects,
1 crustacean and 1 chelicerate); 11 deuterostomes (5 vertebrates, 2 urochordates, 2 echinoderms, 1 cephalochordate and 1 hemichordate); 4 lophotrochozoans (2
mollusks and 2 annelids); 2 cnidarians; and 1 placozoan.
A summary of the studied species with the number of
identified snail related genes is shown in Table 1. A list of
all the identified sequences can be found in Additional
file 1.

Strikingly, in every animal species (except one – Ciona
intestinalis) whose genome is completely sequenced, we
found at least one snail-like and one scratch-like gene, con-

firming the ancestry of these two gene families and their
strong conservation during animal evolution. An interesting exception is the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica in
whose genome we were unable to find any gene with significant sequence similarity to snail and/or scratch genes.
Extensive blast searches against several other publicly
available databases (such as EST databases) also failed to
identify snail related genes from sponges (not shown).
Sponges are widely considered as the sister group of all
other animals (which constitute the so-called eumetazoans) [39] and therefore the absence of snail related genes
in Amphimedon may suggest that the snail superfamily
evolved after the divergence between sponges and
eumetazoans and may therefore constitute a molecular
synapomorphy of the latter. Alternatively, snail related
genes may have been secondarily lost in the Amphimedon
lineage. This second alternative should be considered as
the most plausible if we take in consideration some
recently obtained metazoan phylogenies that suggest that
sponges may not be the most basal animals [40,41]. We
also failed to detect any snail related gene in the fully
sequenced genome of species outside metazoans, including the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, a close relative of animals (not shown).
Therefore, we conclude that the snail superfamily originated early in the metazoan lineage and has been strongly
conserved during metazoan evolution. The presence of
several snail related genes in most species prompted us to
further study the evolution of the family by phylogenetic
and protein domain organization analyses.
The snail superfamily consists of 3 evolutionary conserved
families (snail, scratchA and scratchB) and its evolution
has been shaped by numerous gene duplication events
We constructed a multiple alignment of conserved
domains from 89 identified Snail related proteins (Additional file 2) and used this alignment to construct phylogenetic trees using different phylogenetic methods (see
Methods). The trees obtained with the different methods
were broadly congruent and a representative tree is shown
in Figure 1. A similar tree topology was obtained using an
alignment including whole sequences (not shown). In
order to test the monophyly of the snail superfamily and
to root our phylogenetic trees, we used as outgroup a family of uncharacterized Zinc finger proteins which are only
present in the genomes of insects (known as CG15269 in
Drosophila) and which show sequence similarity to the
Snail related proteins. As expected, we found that all the
Snail related proteins form a strongly supported monophyletic group which is separated into two well supported
families, snail and scratch (Figure 1). Interestingly, the
scratch family is separated further into two subgroups that
we named scratchA and scratchB. Both subfamilies regroup
scratch representatives belonging to the three main bilate-

rian lineages (deuterostomes, lophotrochozoans and
ecdysozoans), suggesting an early duplication of a single
scratch gene before the divergence of these three lineages.
The presence of a single scratch gene in the non bilaterian
species Nematostella vectensis and Trichoplax adhaerens
(Table 1) suggests that this duplication event occurred
during early bilaterian evolution, after the divergence with
cnidarians and placozoans. However, as the single Nematostella and Trichoplax Scratch sequences have a weak tendency to group with the bilaterian ScratchB proteins
(Figure 1), we cannot rule out the possibility that the
Nematostella and Trichoplax genes are bona fide scratchB
genes and therefore that the scratchA representatives were
lost in these two species.
We also defined the genomic position of the snail and
scratch genes of every species whose genome is completely
sequenced (Additional file 3). While in most species snail
and scratch genes are dispersed to different chromosomes,
genomic scaffolds, or contigs, we found a few cases of
genomic linkages (colored gene names in Additional file
3). Most of these associations concern either two or more
snail genes (in Capitella, Drosophila, and Lottia), or two or
more scratchB genes (in Anopheles, Apis, Daphnia, Drosophila, and Tribolium), and likely correspond to relatively
recent tandem duplications that occurred in some ancestors of these species (see the phylogenetic analysis
reported in the two next paragraphs of this section). We
also found that the single scratchA and scratchB genes of
Lottia are on a same genomic scaffold, but are not adjacent
on this scaffold. As such an association is not found in any
other species, its meaning remains elusive. Finally, we
found that a snail and a scratch gene are adjacent on a same
scaffold in the placozoan Trichoplax. A recent study indicated that Trichoplax has a particularly low rate of local
rearrangement in its genome, as compared to other animals such as arthropods, and suggested that the Trichoplax
genome may thus have retained some ancestral features in
its organization [42]. The linkage of snail and scratch in
Trichoplax may therefore correspond to the ancestral situation and point out that the snail and scratch genes have
been produced by a tandem duplication during the early
evolution of animals. A consequence of the low rate of
local rearrangement in Trichoplax is that syntenic regions
are observed relative to chordates [42]. Interestingly, we
found that, while not adjacent, a snail and a scratch gene
are found on the same scaffold in the cephalochordate
Branchiostoma. Furthermore, in both mouse and human,
one of the snail and one of the scratch genes are located on

the same chromosome (but on different arms, in human,
20q13.1 and 20p12.3-13, respectively). We tried to define
whether snail and scratch may be included in syntenic
regions in Trichoplax, Nematostella, and Branchiostoma, but
we failed to detect conserved genes close to snail and
scratch in these species (Additional file 4).
We then analyzed in more detail the evolution of the snail
and scratch families. For this purpose, we constructed separate phylogenetic trees for these two families (Figure 2).
In the case of the snail family, the phylogenetic tree is not
well resolved as we found only a few statistically well supported monophyletic groups (Figure 2A). The tree topology was similar to that obtained using the whole dataset
of Snail related proteins (Figure 1). Resolution was not
increased by analyzing whole sequences or just the Zn-fingers (not shown). Strikingly, almost all statistically supported groups in Figure 2A include sequences only from
closely-related species (such as mouse and human or the
two gastropods Patella and Lottia) or sequences from the
same species (for example in the case of Platynereis and
Capitella). Three groups reflecting deep kinships were nevertheless observed and comprise all vertebrates (pink
branches in Figure 2A), all non-bilaterians (green
branches), or all protostomes (blue branches) sequences,
respectively. The existence of these separated groups,
while barely statistically supported, suggest that the last
common ancestors of eumetazoans and bilaterians possessed a single snail gene and that increased complexity in
the family occurred by independent duplication events in
the different eumetazoan lineages. From our phylogenetic
analyses and applying the parsimony principle, we
deduced that at least 10 independent duplications
occurred in the snail family. Some of these duplications
much probably correspond to whole genome duplications (WGD), two rounds of WGD during early vertebrate
evolution explain the origin of the three paralogs found in
the different vertebrate groups, one additional round of
WGD in teleost fishes produced the snail1a/snail1b pair in
Danio rerio, and still one more WGD in Xenopus laevis led
to the presence of the snail2α and snail2β paralogs in this
species [43,44]. Other duplications, in Nematostella, Drosophilids, Platynereis, Capitella, and Gastropods, likely correspond to single-gene (small-scale) duplications. Finally,
Homo sapiens SNAIL1-like is an intron-less copy of SNAIL1
and therefore probably derives from a retrotransposition
event.
The two scratch families show contrasting evolutions (Figure 2B). In the scratchA family, no further duplication
event was detected as there is at most one such gene in the
different studied species (Figure 2B; Table 1). Strikingly,
while a scratchA gene is found in both protostomes (ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans) and deuterostomes (in an
echinoderm and a cephalochordate) and therefore is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/94

ancestral to bilaterians, this gene is absent in vertebrates
and urochordates, indicating its loss after the divergence
between the urochordate/vertebrate and cephalochordate
lineages. As discussed previously, the absence of scratchA
sequences in the non bilaterians Nematostella and Trichoplax could be due to the loss of this gene in these species
or indicate that the duplication that gave rise to the two
scratch families occurred only in bilaterians after their
divergence with cnidarians and placozoans. The scratchB
family is more complex: genes of this family are found in
all bilaterian lineages and paralogs are observed in most
species (Figure 2B; Table 1). As in the case of the snail family, our phylogenetic trees suggest occurrence of several (at
least 7) independent duplications in the scratchB family:
in insects (two genes were already present in the last common ancestor of dipterans, coleopterans and hymenopterans), Daphnia, Capitella (2 duplications), Danio rerio (2
duplications, one of which probably corresponding to the
teleost-specific WGD), and Mammals.
We conclude that the snail superfamily is composed of
three families which are ancestral at least to bilaterians
and maybe to eumetazoans. Two of these families (snail
and scratchB) have been broadly conserved in bilaterians
and expanded through multiple independent gene duplications in the different bilaterian lineages. The third family (scratchA), in contrast, did not undergo gene
duplication events and has been lost in the urochordate/
vertebrate lineage. We next studied the evolution of the
domain organization of the Snail and Scratch proteins.
Evolution of domain organization of Snail related proteins
Snail related proteins bear, in addition to C2H2 Zn fingers, more or less conserved domains found in similar
positions inside the protein [1,2,13,37]. From amino to
carboxyl extremity, one can find (i) a Snail/Gfi1 repressor
domain (SNAG domain) supposedly represented in all
Snail related proteins (Figure 3A); (ii) binding domains
for the Carboxy-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) corepressor (CtBP domain, present only in some Snail
sequences; Figure 3B); (iii) two highly conserved aminoacid stretches considered specific to Scratch and to vertebrate Snail3 (formerly known as Slug) proteins which are
the so-called SCRATCH (Figure 3C) and SLUG (Figure
3D) domains, respectively; and (iv) C2H2 Zn fingers (Figure 3E–G). We used our extensive dataset of Snail related
proteins to further study the organization and presence/
absence of these domains in the different Snail related
proteins. We then examined the evolution of the different
domains by representing their presence/absence on the
phylogenetic tree of the snail superfamily (Figure 1).

The SNAG domain, though initially described as the 20
first amino acids at the N-terminal end of the Snail protein [45], were often restricted in subsequent studies to

only the first 8 or 9 residues due to poor conservation of
the other residues. Thanks to our large dataset covering
many species, we found that the SNAG domain is in fact
subdivided into two domains (referred to here as SNAG-1
and SNAG-2; Figure 3A). These two domains are rarely
simultaneously present in Snail and Scratch proteins
(such occurrence can be observed with Daphnia pulex
Snail), and more often, only one of the domains is present
(for instance SNAG-1 in Homo sapiens SCRATCH2 or
SNAG-2 in Drosophila melanogaster Snail), or the two
domains are absent (for example in Platynereis dumerilii

Snail2 and Drosophila melanogaster Scratch3). As the SNAG
domain is found in proteins belonging to the snail,
scratchA and scratchB families (Figure 1), this amino-acid
stretch is most likely to have been present in the protein
encoded by the unique ancestor gene that gave rise to the
whole superfamily. This suggests that many convergent
secondary losses occurred, either of the entire SNAG
domain or of the SNAG-1 or SNAG-2 domains. In our
most parsimonious scenario, SNAG-1 loss occurred 11
times to explain its actual repartition in our dataset (this
domain is absent in 24 sequences). SNAG-2 seems to be

even more labile than SNAG-1 and appears to have been
lost 18 times independently. Interestingly, variations in
the presence of SNAG-1 or SNAG-2 seem to be linked to
duplication events, as in several instances SNAG domains
are lost in some but not all of the paralogs (Figure 1; for
example, snail paralogs in Gastropods and Platynereis, and
scratch paralogs in insects, Danio rerio, Mammals and
Capitella). The absence or presence of full or partial SNAG
domains is likely to have consequences on the activity of
the proteins. Indeed, the SNAG domains which are not
only present in Snail proteins but also in other Zn-finger
transcription factors, may be involved in the transcriptional activity of the protein, as this domain has been
shown, in some conditions, to interact with Ajuba LIM
Domain Protein to elicit transcriptional repression
[46,47].
CtBP domains contain the PXD/LSX motif required for
the recruitment of the co-repressor CtBP by Snail proteins,
an important event for the function of these proteins as
transcriptional repressors (Figure 3B) [48,49]. We found
this domain to be present only in Snail proteins, but neither in ScratchA nor ScratchB proteins (Figure 1). In both
vertebrates and arthropods, we often found a CtBP
domain in the N-terminal part of the protein close to the
SNAG domain and we suggest that this may represent the
ancestral situation for bilaterian Snail proteins. In arthropods, duplications of the motif have occurred, as we often
observed two or three CtBP domains, one of which can be
found in the C-terminal part of the proteins (Figure 1). As
this domain is encoded by a single exon and found in
many different proteins, exon shuffling may be responsible for these duplications. Finally, the CtBP domain is
absent in all Snail proteins from non bilaterians and
lophotrochozoans as well as those from some deuterostomes and insects. This suggests that losses of this domain
have occurred and that, contrary to what has been proposed [50], the recruitment of CtBP may not be a conserved modality for the function of Snail proteins in
animals. However, the CtBP domain is small and may
have some plasticity: we found that in two vertebrates
Snail proteins (Anolis and Xenopus Snail1) that lack bona
fide CtBP domains, a partially similar motif (PXDLTX) can
be found in a similar context (same part of the proteins
and conserved amino-acid stretches surrounding the
motif) than the CtBP domain in other proteins. It is therefore conceivable that these (and maybe other) Snail proteins lacking bona fide CtBP domains may nevertheless
interact with CtBP through altered motifs – functional
characterizations of some of these proteins will be
required to explore this possibility.
The SCRATCH domain has been described as a conserved
amino-acid stretch (of unknown function) found in
Scratch but not Snail proteins and therefore as being of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/94

diagnostic relevance for the Scratch proteins (Figure 3C)
[1]. Despite extensive efforts, we did not find this
SCRATCH domain in all Scratch sequences. Strikingly,
while this domain is found in most (but not all) ScratchB
proteins, we never found it in ScratchA sequences (Figure
1). The SCRATCH domain should thus be considered as a
diagnostic domain of scratchB family members (though
absent from Daphnia scratch 2, Tribolium scratch 2, Capitella
scratch 4 and Trichoplax scratch sequences – Figure 2), but
not of the entire scratch family.
A diagnostic stretch of 29 amino-acids was characterized
in proteins formerly known as Slug (Snail 2) and was
therefore named SLUG domain (Figure 3D) [13]. While
the full domain is only found in vertebrate Snail2 proteins
(Figure 1), amino acid stretches similar to part of this
domain are found in the single echinoderm Snail protein,
as well as in some vertebrate Snail1 and Snail3 proteins
(Figure 3D). This suggests that the SLUG domain may
have been present in the ancestral deuterostome Snail
protein and only well conserved in Snail2 paralogs in vertebrates, as well as to a lesser extent in the echinoderm
Snail protein.
Finally, we analyzed the C2H2 Zn fingers sequences (Figure 3E–G). C2H2 Zn fingers bear a conserved #-X-C-X(15)-C-X3-#-X5-#-X2-H-X(3-6)-[H/C] residues pattern
where X represent any amino acid, and numbers in brackets indicate the number of residues. Positions marked #
are those that are important for stable folding of the zinc
finger [51]. Alignment of the Zn-fingers allowed efficient
sorting of snail, scratchA, and scratchB family members,
with the first and last two Zn-fingers being the most
informative (Figure 3E–G). All Scratch and most Snail
proteins contain 5 Zn-fingers (Figure 1), suggesting that
this organization represents the ancestral situation for the
snail superfamily. In the snail family, the first Zn-finger has
been lost in a few cases (in vertebrates and non bilaterians) and duplicated in Drosophila worniu genes (Figure 1
and Figure 3E), suggesting some plasticity for the presence
of this first Zn-finger.
Our careful analysis of the organization of the Snail
related proteins allows the identification of diagnostic
amino acid stretches, such as the sequence of the first and
fifth Zn-fingers and the presence/absence of some
domains (for example the SCRATCH domain), specific of
either of the three families and which suggest that Snail,
ScratchA and ScratchB proteins have different functional
specificities. Our analysis also points to potential functional diversifications of the Snail related proteins following gene duplications, as in several instances, paralogs in
a given species show different domain organizations (Figure 1).

Expression patterns of Pdu-sna1 & Pdu-sna2 during
Platynereis development
It is widely believed that paralogs may avoid non-functionalization (and therefore be maintained as active
genes) over long evolutionary times only if they evolve at
least partially different functions (e.g. [52-54]). This could
be achieved for example by evolving different or complementary expression patterns. Our phylogenetic analysis of
the snail family indicates the occurrence of two independent gene duplications in two polychaete annelids, Platynereis dumerilii and Capitella spI (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
We thought that this may represent a good model to study
how genes may evolve, at the expression level, following
gene duplication. As the expression during development
of the two Capitella snail genes have been thoroughly
described [23], we studied the developmental expression
of the two Platynereis genes (that we named Pdu-sna1 and
Pdu-sna2) using whole-mount in situ hybridization
(WMISH) with RNA antisense probes. Platynereis displays
an indirect development life cycle with a short embryonic
development which gives rise to a ciliated trochophore
larva that subsequently metamorphoses into a juvenile
worm [55]. Throughout the rest of its life, the worm adds
segments sequentially from a sub-terminal posterior
growth zone. Due to technical difficulty of assessing gene
expression in early developmental stages, we focused our
studies on Pdu-sna1 and Pdu-sna2 expression from trochophore (24 hours post fertilization, hpf) to adult stage.

In 24 hpf larvae, Pdu-sna1 is expressed in several bilaterally-organized ectodermal cells (Figure 4A, B; blue
arrows) whose distribution is similar to that of the cells
expressing neural markers, such as Pdu-elav and Pdu-neurogenin [56,57], suggesting that Pdu-sna1 is expressed in
cells of the larval nervous system. In addition, the gene is
expressed in internal cells (Figure 4A, B; red arrows)
whose organization and position suggest that they belong
to the so-called mesodermal bands that will form all the
trunk somatic mesoderm derivatives. In 34 hpf larvae, the
expression of Pdu-sna1 in the ectoderm is similar to the
previous stage (not shown), but its mesodermal expression has dramatically expanded, as the gene is now
expressed in a large number of trunk mesodermal cells
(Figure 4D; red arrows). This mesodermal expression is
still found in 48 hpf larvae (not shown) in which three
additional expression sites can be observed: Pdu-sna1 is
expressed in cells that belong to the developing ventral
nerve cord (VNC; Figure 4E; filled blue arrows), i.e. the
CNS of the worm, in lateral ectodermal cells that probably
belong to the developing PNS (Figure 4E; open blue
arrows), and in a sheath of cells surrounding the invaginating foregut, i.e. most likely visceral mesodermal cells
(Figure 4F; red arrows). All these expression patterns are
maintained in subsequent stages, as shown in 72 hpf juvenile worm (Figure 4I, J). At this stage, it is clear that Pdu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/94

sna1 is expressed in the differentiating lateral striated muscles (Figure 4J; red arrows). During adult posterior
growth, Pdu-sna1 displays a salt and pepper expression
pattern in the growing VNC, as well as in putative PNS
cells in more lateral positions (Figure 4M; blue arrows),
patterns that are reminiscent to those observed during larval stages. As in 72 hpf larvae, strong expression is also
detected in the differentiated lateral striated muscles (Figure 4N; red arrows).
In 24 hpf larvae, Pdu-sna2 is expressed in a pattern very
similar to that of Pdu-sna1, suggesting co-expression of the
two paralogs in putative larval neural cells (Figure 4C;
blue arrows). Pdu-sna2 expression is also found in some
ectodermal cells in the episphere of the larva, the future
head region (not shown) – no such expression was found
for Pdu-sna1. No mesodermal expression is observed for
Pdu-sna2 in 24 hpf larvae or subsequent developmental
stages. In 48 hpf larvae, Pdu-sna2 is expressed in numerous cells belonging to the prospective VNC, as well as in
lateral putative PNS cells (Figure 4G; filled and open blue
arrows, respectively). While these expression patterns are
reminiscent to those of Pdu-sna1 at the same stage, Pdusna2 is clearly expressed in many more cells, in particular
in the VNC. In addition, while Pdu-sna1 is mainly
expressed in the ventralmost cells of the VNC, Pdu-sna2 is
mainly expressed in more lateral VNC cells (compare Figure 4E and 4G), indicating that the two genes have distinct
expression patterns in the VNC with little or no overlap.
The 48 hpf larval developing VNC region is complex and
composed of at least three layers of cells formed by the
superficial proliferating neuroectodermal cells, the
slightly more internal undifferentiated neural precursors,
and the internal differentiated neural cells [56,57]. Using
confocal scanning laser microscopy, we determined that
Pdu-sna2 is mainly expressed in the intermediate layer and
in a few superficial cells (Figure 5A, C), indicating an
expression in undifferentiated neural precursors. At 48
hpf, an expression of Pdu-sna2 is also observed in cells of
the invaginating foregut (Figure 4H and 5B; white arrows)
– once more this expression is clearly distinct from the
expression of Pdu-sna1 in the mesodermal sheath of the
foregut (compare Figure 4F and 4H). Pdu-sna2 is also
expressed in many cells in the head region, probably corresponding to brain and sense organ cells (not shown).
Expressions of Pdu-sna2, similar to those of the previous
stages, are observed in 72 hpf juvenile worms (Figure 4K,
L) and during adult posterior growth (Figure 4O). In a 72
hpf, a very large expression is found in the foregut, suggesting that most of its cells express Pdu-sna2 (Figure 4K,
L; white arrows).
In summary, we have found that both Pdu-sna1 and Pdusna2 are expressed in the developing nervous system, but
in at least partially distinct patterns. In addition, Pdu-sna1

(but not Pdu-sna2) is expressed in parts of the somatic and
visceral mesoderm, and Pdu-sna2 (but not Pdu-sna1) in
the developing foregut. The expression patterns can be
interpreted along two lines. First, if we compare these
expressions with those of snail genes in distantly-related
species, such as arthropods and chordates, we can highlight putative evolutionary conserved expressions of the
genes of this family. A prominent expression in the developing nervous system appears to be such a conserved feature, as it is found in ecdysozoans (for example in insects
and spiders; see introduction), in lophotrochozoans (at
least in annelids), and in deuterostomes. Indeed, while
snail neural functions in vertebrates have been mostly
described in the neural crest, a tissue considered to be vertebrate-specific, it has been shown that snail genes are also
broadly expressed in the developing neural tube, in a
cephalochordate, amphioxus [18], and in a sea lamprey
[12]. These data are therefore consistent with an ancestral
role of snail family in the formation of the nervous system,
both in the PNS and CNS, the expression in the latter having been lost for some vertebrates (gnathostomes). Simi-

larly, expression of snail genes in developing mesoderm
and mesodermal derivatives is a recurrent theme found in
many species belonging to both protostomes (insects)
and deuterostomes (vertebrates), suggesting that it may
represent a conserved ancestral feature of this gene family.
The expression patterns of Platynereis snail genes elicit
another interesting line of interpretations when these patterns are compared with those of another annelid,
Capitella spI [23]. In both annelid species, the two paralogs
(which have been produced by independent duplications,
see above) are expressed in largely distinct patterns. Taken
together, the combined expressions of the two snail genes
for both species are almost identical, as the genes are
broadly expressed in the CNS and the PNS, in the differentiating mesoderm as well as in the foregut, indicating
well conserved expressions and probably functions in
annelids. Interestingly, these expressions are differently
shared out between paralogs in Platynereis and Capitella.
Indeed, CapI-sna1 is expressed in the trunk mesoderm, in
many cells of the foregut, and in the CNS (including a

them are indicated by arrows).

strong expression in the brain and in the ventral part of
the VNC) whereas CapI-sna2 is mainly expressed in the
CNS (weakly in the brain and in rather lateral cells of the
VNC), as well as transiently in a few cells associated with
the foregut [23]. In Platynereis, Pdu-sna1 is expressed in the
mesoderm, but not in the foregut cells and only in a limited set of cells of the nervous system whereas Pdu-sna2 is
expressed in many neural cells (including in the brain), in
many foregut cells, but not in the mesoderm. We suggest
that the different expressions of the paralogs in both Platynereis and Capitella are due to subfunctionalization, a
process by which ancestral genetic functions (and often
expressions) are shared out between paralogs, following
gene duplication, and which is believed to be important
for the maintenance of paralogs over long evolutionary
times (e.g. [52,53]). The subfunctionalization events
occurred independently in the two annelid species, as the
duplications are themselves independent, leading to different subdivisions of the ancestral expression (nervous
system plus mesoderm plus foregut) in Platynereis and
Capitella and therefore different combinations of expressions for the two paralogs in these species. Interestingly,
evidence for subfunctionalization has also been reported
for vertebrate snail genes [12]. We propose that the
repeated occurrence of subfunctionalization events may
explain why the snail family has undergone so many independent duplications which lead to the maintenance of
functional paralogs. More precisely, the snail genes may be
especially prone to subfunctionalization, probably
because the ancestral snail genes had complex expression
patterns and therefore complex regulatory regions, a feature suitable for subfunctionalization [52], and this
would increase the retention of paralogs over long evolutionary times.

Snail, ScratchA and ScratchB proteins. In addition, analysis of the domains of these proteins highlights potential
functional diversification of the Snail and Scratch proteins
following gene duplications, as in several instances paralogs in a given species show different domain organizations. We also present the expression patterns of two snail
genes in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, which suggest
ancestral functions for bilaterian snail genes in nervous
system and mesoderm formation. Comparisons of the
expression domains of these two Platynereis snail paralogs
with the expression domains of the two independently
duplicated snail paralogs from another annelid, Capitella
spI, provide evidence for independent subfunctionalization events which have occurred in these two species. Subfunctionalization events may have been more generally
crucial for the evolution of the snail superfamily and may
explain the retention of active paralogs in many instances
of independent gene duplications.

Methods

Conclusion

Cloning and sequencing of Platynereis dumerilii snail
sequences
A small fragment corresponding to a sequence conserved
among protostome and deuterostome snail genes was isolated using degenerate primers on 24 hpf and 48 hpf
cDNA libraries and the complete coding sequences of the
two Platynereis snail genes were amplified using SMART™
RACE cDNA amplification procedures with gene-specific
primers. PCR products were TA cloned into the PCR2.1
vector (Invitrogen), sequenced on an ABI automated
sequencer, and used as template to produce labelled antisense RNA probes for whole mount in situ hybridizations
(WMISH). Primer sequences and detailed PCR conditions
are available upon request. Accession numbers of Pdusnail1 and Pdu-snail2 are EMBL:FN185991 and
EMBL:FN185992, respectively.

In this article, we present a large scale phylogenomic study
of the snail superfamily in metazoans. Thanks to the use
of an extended and comprehensive sequence dataset and
several phylogenetic methods, we show a new topology
for the snail superfamily, with three main families, snail,
scratchA and scratchB. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate
that these three families are ancestral at least to bilaterians
and maybe to eumetazoans. These families have been well
conserved in bilaterians as members of these families are
found in the main bilaterian branches. Two of these families (snail and scratchB) underwent multiple gene duplications while the third one (scratchA) did not and has been
lost in the urochordate/vertebrate lineage. A careful analysis of the organization of the Snail and Scratch proteins
encoded by the genome of diverse metazoan species indicates that these proteins, while well conserved overall,
show specific molecular signatures, such as particular
sequence of the Zn-fingers and the presence/absence of
some domains, indicative of functional specificities for

Retrieval of snail and scratch sequences
snail and scratch genes were retrieved using TBLASTN and
BLASTP algorithms [58] on the current assembly and the
predicted proteins (if available) of the genomes of the species indicated in Table 1, using the BLAST servers dedicated to these species (Doe Joint Genome Institute, Baylor
College of Medicine, Flybase, Genome Sequencing
Center, and Ensembl) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST server (Genomic
BLAST databases) [59-64]. Additional BLAST searches
were also performed against the NCBI protein TRACE and
EST databases in order to identify snail and scratch genes in
additional species whose genome is not completely
sequenced. Amino acid sequences were subsequently predicted using Geneid, Genscan, and TBLASTN against the
NCBI nr protein database [58,65,66] or by manual alignment. All the sequences we have identified are available
upon request.

Phylogenetic analyses
Multiple alignments were performed with Muscle 3.6 software [67] and were subsequently manually improved.
Handling of the multiple alignments was done using
BioEdit sequence alignment editor [68]. Unweighted
maximum-parsimony (MP) and neighbour-joining (NJ)
reconstructions were performed with the PAUP 4.0 program [69]. NJ analyses were done using the BioNJ algorithm [70] and 1000 bootstrap replicates. MP analyses
were performed with the following settings: heuristic
search of over 200 bootstrap replicates; MAXTREES set at
3000, and other parameters set at default values. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed with
PHYML [71]. PHYML analyses were performed using the
WAG amino-acid substitution model [72], the frequencies
of amino acids being estimated from the data set, and rate
heterogeneity across sites being modelled by two rate categories (one constant and eight γ-rates). Statistical support for the different internal branches was assessed by
bootstrap resampling (150 bootstrap replicates), as
implemented in PHYML [71]. Bayesian inference was performed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method as
implemented in the MRBAYES (version 3) package
[73,74]. We used the WAG substitution frequency matrix
[66] with among-sites rate variation modelled by means
of a discrete distribution with four equally probable categories. Two independent Markov chains were run, each
containing from 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 Monte Carlo
steps (depending on the number of steps required to get
chain convergence). One out of every 250 trees was saved.
The trees obtained in the two runs were meshed and the
first 25% of the trees were discarded as 'burnin'. Marginal
probabilities at each internal branch were taken as a measure of statistical support. All the alignments and the trees
are available upon request.
Breeding culture, embryo collection, whole mount in situ
hybridization (WMISH), microscopy, and image processing
Animals were obtained from a breeding culture established in Gif-sur-Yvette according to the protocol of Fisher
and Dorresteijn [55]. Larvae and regenerated posterior
parts collection and fixation, as well as WMISH, were
done as previously described [75-77]. In some cases, the
NBT/BCIP staining was visualized by reflection confocal
laser scanning microscopy [75]. Labeled embryos picture
Z-stacks were manually taken on a Leica bright-field
microscope and Z-projection images were made using
ImageJ 1.36b. Confocal pictures were taken on a Leica Sp2
confocal microscope and images were 3D reconstructed
with Metamorph.
