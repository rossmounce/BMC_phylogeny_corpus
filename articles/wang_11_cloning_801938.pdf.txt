Abstract
Background: The very low density lipoprotein receptor gene (VLDLR), a member of the low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR) gene family, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of yolk protein precursors in oviparous species.
Differential splicing of this gene has been reported in human, rabbit and rat. In chicken, studies showed that the
VLDLR protein on the oocyte surface mediates the uptake of yolk protein precursors into growing oocytes.
However, information on the VLDLR gene in duck is still scarce.
Methods: Full-length duck VLDLR cDNA was obtained by comparative cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE). Tissue expression patterns were analysed by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Association between the different genotypes and egg performance traits was investigated with
the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the SAS® software package.
Results: In duck, two VLDLR transcripts were identified, one transcript (variant-a) containing an O-linked sugar
domain and the other (variant-b) not containing this sugar domain. These transcripts share ~70 to 90% identity
with their counterparts in other species. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences showed that duck
VLDLR proteins were closely related with those of chicken and zebra finch. The two duck VLDLR transcripts are
differentially expressed i.e. VLDLR-a is mainly expressed in muscle tissue and VLDLR-b in reproductive organs. We
have localized the duck VLDLR gene on chromosome Z. An association analysis using two completely linked SNP
sites (T/C at position 2025 bp of the ORF and G/A in intron 13) and records from two generations demonstrated
that the duck VLDLR gene was significantly associated with egg production (P < 0.01), age of first egg (P < 0.01)
and body weight of first egg (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: Duck and chicken VLDLR genes probably perform similar function in the development of growing
oocytes and deposition of yolk lipoprotein. Therefore, VLDLR could be a candidate gene for duck egg performance
and be used as a genetic marker to improve egg performance in ducks.

Background
The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), a
member of the LDL receptor family [1], is an important
multifunctional receptor. Apart from mediating the
metabolism of triglycerides, it is well documented that
VLDLR also takes part in a range of cellular processes
including cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, etc [2].

The VLDLR gene was firstly isolated from a rabbit
heart cDNA library and later cloned in chicken, human,
mouse, cattle and monkey and its structure in these different species was elucidated in great detail [3-8]. Similar to the LDLR gene, the VLDLR gene contains five
functional domains: (i) multiple cysteine-rich repeats
constituting the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain;
(ii) an epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homologous domain; (iii) an O-linked sugar domain; (iv) a
transmembrane domain; and (v) a cytoplasmic domain
with a FDNPVY sequence [9]. Although the structural
features of each domain of the VLDLR and LDLR proteins share some striking homologies, they differ in the

number of cysteine-rich repeat sequences present in the
ligand-binding domain i.e. VLDLR has eight cysteinerich repeats and LDLR, only has seven [10,11]. The Olinked sugar domain is a serine and threonine rich
domain that corresponds to exon 16 in the VLDLR gene
and its differential splicing has been described in
human, rat, rabbit and cattle [7,12-15].
Chicken VLDLR, also named oocyte vitellogenesis
receptor (OVR) or vitellogenin receptor (VTGR), mediates the absorption of yolk protein precursors from
plasma very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin.
Bujo et al. (1994) detected a point mutation (G/C) at
position 2177 bp of the chicken VLDLR cDNA (mutation named “restricted ovulation” or RO) and showed
that the mutant had a reduced egg production [16-18].
Subsequently, it was shown that VLDLR has a key role
on chicken reproduction, including the development of
oocytes and yolk lipoprotein deposition [19,20].
Recently, a study in zebra finch suggested that VLDLR
mRNA expression was pivotal for reproduction in oviparous species [21].
Duck is an important agricultural poultry species for
the production of eggs and meat. However, egg performance of some local duck breeds remains low and
could benefit from genetic improvement. Markerassisted selection is based on the association between
DNA variation and genes that control a trait of interest
and has become an important approach towards
improving production traits in animal breeding. In
chicken and zebra finch, the VLDLR gene has been
reported to play a key role in reproduction and could
represent a functional candidate gene for egg performance. Since little was known on its structure and role
in duck, we have cloned the full length duck VLDLR
gene, analysed its expression profile in twelve different
tissues and investigated its association with duck egg
performance using SNP located within the gene.

Materials and methods
Ducks, tissue and data collection

Three healthy female ducks (aged 20 weeks) were
selected from the second generation of the white Liancheng × white Kaiya cross, and all the ducks were
reared under normal management conditions. All animal procedures were performed according to protocols
approved by the Biological Studies Animal Care and Use
Committee of Hubei Province, PR China. Twelve different tissues were sampled from each duck, including
heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, brain, adipose
tissue, intestine, pituitary gland, ovary and oviduct,
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°
C until total RNA extraction.
Ducks of the second (n = 350) and third (n = 251)
generations of white Liancheng × white Kaiya cross

were provided by the Hankou Jingwu Industry Garden
Ltd.. The ducks were reared in cages in a semi-open
house and subjected to conventional management conditions. Recorded traits included age of the first egg,
body weight at age of first egg and egg production (during 210 days, 300 days and 360 days) of each individual
duck. Egg characteristics were measured at day 295 to
300, and included egg weight, Haugh unit, egg index,
percentage of yolk, percentage of albumen and shell
strength [22].
DNA isolation, RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform
method from blood samples [23]. DNA concentration
and quality were measured with the spectrophotometer
ND-1000 (Nano-Drop, USA), and the concentrations
were adjusted between 50 and 300 ng/μL. DNA samples
were stored at 4°C until use for PCR reactions.
Total RNA was isolated from different tissues with
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of total
RNA sample was evaluated by electrophoresis on 1.2%
agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and their
concentrations were measured with the spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nano-Drop, USA). cDNA was
obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 1 μg of DNase-treated (TOYOBO
CO., DNaseI) total RNA according to the M-MLV
reverse transcriptase kit (TOYOBO, Japan) at 42°C.
Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of duck VLDLR

Based on the conserved region between Gallus gallus
(GI: 45382562) and Anser anser (GI: 148733616) VLDLR
genes, a pair of primers (VLDLR-F/VLDLR-R) was
designed to obtain partial duck VLDLR gene sequence
(primers shown in Table 1). The PCR program included
denaturation during 5 min at 94°C, followed by 32
cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30s at 60°C, 30s at 72°C, and an
extension step of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products
were cloned into the PEASY-T1 vector (TransGen Biotech) and sequenced commercially.
Based on the partial cDNA sequence obtained from
the above RT-PCR reaction, duck gene specific primers
and cDNA-end RACE primers were designed to
amplify the full-length cDNA sequence of duck VLDLR
(primers shown in Table 1). 3’-RACE and 5’-RACE
PCR were conducted with 10 mg of RNA isolated from
ovary and the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification
kit (Clontech Laboratories, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR program
included a denaturation step of 4 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 35 s at 94°C, 35 s at annealing
temperature (Table 1), 30 s to 2 min at 72°C, and a
final extension of 5 min at 72°C.

Expression profile

Polymorphism

The 3’-RACE and 5’-RACE PCR products were gelpurified and cloned into the PEASY-T1 vector (TransGen Biotech), then commercially sequenced. The open
reading frame (ORF) and the amino acid sequences
were deduced using SeqMan (DNAstar). The phylograms were created by MEGA 4.0 Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
software [24]. The second structure prediction was performed using online tools on the ExPASy website
(http://cn.expasy.org/tools/).
Expression profiling

To determine the tissue expression of the two type
splice variants, semi-quantitative RT-PCR were carried
out using total RNA from various duck tissues and a
pair of primers (VLDLR-A/VLDLR-S) encompassing the
region corresponding to the O-linked sugar region
(Table 1). The PCR program included a denaturation
step of 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30s at 60°C, 30s at 72°C, and a final step of 5 min
at 72°C. As control, a pair of primers (b-actin-A/bactin-S) (Table 1) was used under the same conditions.
PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels
stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with
ultraviolet light.
SNP screening and genotyping

Two pairs of specific primers (VLDLR-F1/VLDLR-R1
and VLDLR-F2/VLDLR-R2, Table 1) were designed to
screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Twelve
DNA samples from the second generation ducks were
amplified and sequenced. The obtained sequences were
aligned by SeqMan (DNAStar software) to screen SNP
based on the differences between sequences. The restriction endonuclease sites that harboured an SNP were

detected with the primer premier 5.0 software to design
the genotyping protocols. Genotyping of other individuals of the second and third generations were carried
out by PCR-RFLP.
PCR for genotyping were performed in a volume of 15
μL consisting of 50-300 ng of genomic DNA, 1 × PCR
buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, 25 μM dNTP, 2.0 mM
MgCl2 and 0.2 units Taq DNA polymerase (TransGen,
Beijing, China), and ddH2O. PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°
C, 30 s at 56°C, 35 s at 72°C, and a final step of 5 min
at 72°C. Three μL of PCR product were digested overnight with 3 units of Acc1/Rsa1 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)
at 37°C, and then the digested products were visualized
on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized with ultraviolet light, to record the genotype
of each sample.
Association analysis

The general linear model (GLM) procedures of SAS ®
software package (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary NC, USA) was
used to determine associations between the different
genotypes with performance traits according to the following model, Y ij = μ+ S i +G j +ε ij , where Y ij is the
observed value of different egg traits, μ is the population
mean; Si and Gj are the fixed effects of each generation
and genotype, respectively, and εij is the random error.
Values are considered significant at P < 0.05 and are
presented as least square means ± standard error.

Results and discussion
Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of duck VLDLR

Using RACE and sequence matching techniques, a
cDNA sequence covering the whole coding sequence

Wang et al. Genetics Selection Evolution 2011, 43:29
http://www.gsejournal.org/content/43/1/29

was obtained from duck ovary. The cDNA consisted of
3450 nucleotides, containing an open reading frame
(ORF) of 2553 bp, a 5’-terminal untranslated region
(UTR) of 243 bp, and a 3’-terminal UTR of 654 bp
including a TGA termination codon (nucleotides
2797~2799 bp), one putative polyadenylation consensus
signal (AATAAA) and a poly (A) tail. The duck VLDLR
nucleotide sequence shares ~70 to 90% similarity with
its counterpart in other species including Gallus gallus
(GI: 45382562), Homo sapiens (GI: 409425), Macaca
mulatta (GI: 74136368), Mus musculus (GI: 609532),
Sus scrofa (GI: 315506984), Bos taurus (GI: 31341853),
Danio rerio (GI: 169646704), Oryctolagus cuniculus (GI:
126723672) and Taeniopygia guttata (GI: 224091307).
However, unexpectedly we found that the duck VLDLR
cDNA lacked approximately 90 nucleotides compared to
the rabbit VLDLR cDNA. Differential splicing of VLDLR
mRNA has been detected in rabbit, human, mouse and
cattle and results from the deletion of the same region
[7,12-15]. To confirm that a 90-bp deletion also
occurred in duck, RT-PCR was carried out with total
RNA from heart and a pair of primers flanking the deletion was designed. Two bands of 268 and 178 bp were
amplified and cloned into T-vector and sequenced,
which showed that the 268-bp fragment contained the
additional 90-bp sequence. Thus, in duck, two VLDLR
splice variants are present in heart, one (VLDLR-a) with
an O-linked sugar domain and the other (VLDLR-b)
without.
The prediction results from the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics software showed that the VLDLR-a (GenBank: JF950611) contained a 2643 bp ORF, and encoded
a protein of 881 amino acids (aa) with an isoelectric
point (pI) of 4.70 and calculated molecular mass (MW)
of 96.73 kDa. The VLDLR-b (GenBank: JF950612) contained a 2553 bp ORF and encoded a protein of 851 aa
with a pI of 4.69 and calculated MW of 93.74 kDa.
Similar to the LDLR transcript, the VLDLR-a consists of
five domains (Figure 1, 2): (i) six ligand binding motifs
(S-D-E) and eight cysteine-rich repeats within the ligand
binding domain; (ii) five YWXD motifs in the EGF precursor homology domain; (iii) an O-linked sugar domain
with clustered serine and threonine residues; (iv) a 23-aa
sequence in the putative transmembrane domain and (v)
a FDNPVY sequence in the cytoplasmic domain at the
C- terminus [3-7,9]. The VLDLR-b form lacks the Olinked sugar domain.
To investigate the evolutionary origin of duck VLDLR,
a phylogenetic tree showed in Figure 3 was constructed
based on aa sequences of duck and eleven other animal
species for which a complete aa sequence was available,
including Gallus gallus (GI: 45382563), Homo sapiens-a
(GI: 65301167), Homo sapiens-b (GI: 65301164), Macaca
mulatta (GI: 74136369), Sus scrofa (GI: 315139195),

Mus musculus-a (GI: 238637303), Mus musculus-b (GI:
238637305), Oryctolagus cuniculus (GI: 126723673) and
Bos taurus (GI: 27806193), Danio rerio (GI: 169646705)
and Taeniopygia guttata (GI: 224091308) [3,4,7,21,
25-28]. Based on this analysis, three branches were
obtained with duck, chicken and zebra finch belonging
to one group indicating that duck VLDLR proteins are
closer to chicken and zebra finch VLDLR than to those
of the other species. This suggests that duck, chicken
and zebra finch VLDLR probably perform similar
functions.
Expression profile

To determine the tissue expression of the two duck
splice variants, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried
out with total RNA from twelve duck tissues and a pair
of primers encompassing the region corresponding to
the O-linked sugar region. As shown in Figure 4, both
transcripts were expressed in nearly all the tissues tested
from adult female ducks. The VLDLR-a was highly
expressed in muscle tissue, while the VLDLR-b was predominantly expressed in ovary, oviduct, pituitary gland,
liver, spleen, lung, kidney and intestine. Both transcripts
are expressed at equivalent levels in heart, brain and
adipose tissues.
In rabbit, the VLDLR transcript with the O-linked
sugar region (type-1 VLDLR) is the major transcript in
heart and muscle, whereas the transcript for VLDLR
lacking the O-linked sugar region (type-2 VLDLR) is
preferentially expressed in non-muscle tissues, including
cerebrum, cerebellum, kidney, spleen, adrenal gland, testis, ovary and uterus [15]. In cattle, the variant with the
O-linked sugar domain is mainly expressed in heart,
brain and skeletal muscle, while the non-O-glycosylated
splice variant is found in all detected tissues [7]. In our
study, a differential representation of the two splice variants was also observed, VLDLR-a was predominantly
expressed in muscle tissue, and there was no obvious
differential expression in heart and brain tissues. Considering that the differential expression of both VLDLR
variants varies slightly among species and tissues, the
roles of each isoform may differ. In addition, the fact
that the transcript lacking the O-linked sugar region
(VLDLR-b) and expressed in ovary emphasizes its specific role in the development of growing oocytes.
SNP screening and genotyping

Alignment of the PCR sequences from different individuals detected two SNP in a fragment of 714 bp (compared to the reference chicken genome VLDLR
sequence, the fragment covers intron 12 to intron 13
and their flanking region sequences, GenBank:
HQ446851 and HQ446852). These two SNP were positioned at 231 bp for C/T and 633 bp for G/A. These

two mutations at 231 bp (i.e. at position 2025 bp of the

and 53 bp fragments (A allele) (Figure 5-B). Genotyping
data showed that these two sites are in complete

linkage, and only two homozygotes were detected in our
testing population.
Since a resource population was used and under the
hypothesis that the gene is located on an autosome, heterozygous individuals would be expected. Thus, the only
explanation is that in duck, the VLDLR gene is located
on the Z chromosome, which agrees with the location
of the chicken and zebra finch VLDLR genes also on the
Z chromosome. Human VLDLR gene is on chromosome
9, which has been shown to share extensive conserved
synteny with chicken Z [5,29]. Recently, Ellegren (2010)
reported that the chromosomal evolution of birds occurs
at an unusually slow rate and many chromosomes have

remained more or less intact during avian evolution
[30]. Thus, based on the genotype disequilibrium and
the fact that duck is closely related to chicken and zebra
finch, we conclude that the duck VLDLR gene is most
likely located on the Z chromosome.
Association analysis of the duck VLDLR gene with egg
performance

The association analysis demonstrated a significant
association between the two haplotypes and egg production, age at the first egg and body weight at the
first egg. Hens with haplotype AT had a higher egg
production (210-day egg production (P < 0.0001),

lane; M is marker1.

300-day egg production (P = 0.0003), 360-day egg
production (P = 0.0002)) and earlier age for starting
laying (P = 0.0001). Hens with haplotype CG had a
higher body weight at the first egg (P = 0.0277)
(Table 2).
In chicken, a naturally occurring point mutation (G/
C) at position 2177 bp in the OVR cDNA resulting in
an unpaired cysteine residue, prevents the normal yolk
protein precursors to be accumulated, and causes a
reduction or cessation of egg laying [17,31,32]. In
zebra finch, it has been reported that the expression of
VLDLR mRNA plays a key role in determining interindividual variation in reproductive phenotype (e.g. follicle or egg size) [21]. In duck, the detected polymorphism may affect VLDLR mRNA stability through
unknown mechanisms, influencing its expression in
ovary, and the development of the growing oocytes
and yolk lipoprotein deposition. The association analysis also confirmed the crucial role of VLDLR on the
development of yolk protein precursors in oviparous
species.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two variants of duck VLDLR transcripts
were identified and characterized, and their tissue
expression patterns were analysed. Two complete linked
SNP were screened and an association with egg performance was detected using a two generations population.
Our results suggest that duck VLDLR could be a candidate gene for duck egg performance and used as a
genetic marker to improve this trait.
