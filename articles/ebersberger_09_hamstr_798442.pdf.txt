Abstract
Background: EST sequencing is a versatile approach for rapidly gathering protein coding
sequences. They provide direct access to an organism's gene repertoire bypassing the still errorprone procedure of gene prediction from genomic data. Therefore, ESTs are often the only source
for biological sequence data from taxa outside mainstream interest. The widespread use of ESTs in
evolutionary studies and particularly in molecular systematics studies is still hindered by the lack of
efficient and reliable approaches for automated ortholog predictions in ESTs. Existing methods
either depend on a known species tree or cannot cope with redundancy in EST data.
Results: We present a novel approach (HaMStR) to mine EST data for the presence of orthologs
to a curated set of genes. HaMStR combines a profile Hidden Markov Model search and a
subsequent BLAST search to extend existing ortholog cluster with sequences from further taxa.
We show that the HaMStR results are consistent with those obtained with existing orthology
prediction methods that require completely sequenced genomes. A case study on the phylogeny
of 35 fungal taxa illustrates that HaMStR is well suited to compile informative data sets for
phylogenomic studies from ESTs and protein sequence data.
Conclusion: HaMStR extends in a standardized manner a pre-defined set of orthologs with ESTs
from further taxa. In the same fashion HaMStR can be applied to protein sequence data, and thus
provides a comprehensive approach to compile ortholog cluster from any protein coding data. The
resulting orthology predictions serve as the data basis for a variety of evolutionary studies. Here,
we have demonstrated the application of HaMStR in a molecular systematics study. However, we
envision that studies tracing the evolutionary fate of individual genes or functional complexes of
genes will greatly benefit from HaMStR orthology predictions as well.

Background
The amount of protein-coding DNA sequences in the public data bases is steadily increasing. This data is mainly
generated by the sequencing and annotation of entire
genomes and by numerous EST sequencing projects.

Approaches to resolve the evolutionary relationships of
eukaryotes on a molecular basis -frequently referred to as
molecular systematics- particularly benefit from this data.
Recent studies on the evolution of metazoans and fungi
present trees with 40 to 77 taxa, reconstructed from more

than 140 genes [1-6]. Still, these studies consider only a
small fraction of the data available. For example, as of
May 2008 dbEST contains 714 eukaryotic taxa with more
than 2.000 ESTs each, and 394 taxa have more than
10,000
ESTs
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST.
Despite the potential value of ESTs especially for molecular systematics [7] this data has rarely been used in phylogenetic studies so far. This is due to the fact that ESTs are
redundant, short and of low sequence quality. Plenty of
solutions exist to improve data quality by cleaning and
clustering of ESTs sequences prior to analysis [8-10].
However, annotating ESTs and more importantly inferring their relationships to known genes in other taxa is
still problematic.
For most molecular systematics approaches only
sequences are admissible for which the orthology [11] or
co-orthology [12] to the other sequences in the dataset is
known, or at least reasonable to assume [6] (but see [13]).
A variety of tools exist to define groups of orthologous
proteins. Among these, phylogeny-based programs, such
as RIO [14], reveal the lowest fraction of false positives in
a comparison of 10 programs for orthology/homology
inference [15]. It is obvious that methods depending on a
known species tree are not applicable if the aim is to infer
the phylogenetic relationships of taxa. However, more
recent approaches have found solutions to overcome this
strict dependence on a known species tree, e.g., [16]. The
reciprocal best BLAST hit criterion (RBH) between pairs of
sequences from two taxa, is frequently used to infer
orthology when the species tree is unknown. Orthology
predictions from the RBH method have a very low false
positive rate [15]. However, ortholog groups are ultimately confined to two sequences. Thus, co-orthologs
resulting from gene duplications after the separation of
the compared taxa are missed. Several variations exist to
extend RBH ortholog groups to allow for the addition of
co-orthologs [12] and/or to extend the prediction to more
than two taxa [17-19].
Orthology prediction methods based on the RBH criterion have been designed for, and successfully applied to,
inference of ortholog groups for taxa for which the entire
genome has been sequenced. Their application to EST
based data sets, however, is not straightforward. Incomplete representation of a species' gene set, especially in
small EST projects, depreciates a reciprocal best BLAST hit
as an indicator of orthology. Moreover, the coding
sequence of a gene can be tagged by two or more nonoverlapping ESTs. Methods such as InParanoid [12] or
orthoMCL [18] will in most cases add only one of the ESTs
to the ortholog cluster. Both programs allow for more
than one sequence per species in an ortholog cluster, only
when the intra-specific similarity for the sequences in the
cluster is higher than the sequence similarity between species. However, the intra-specific similarity between non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/157

overlapping ESTs derived from the same gene is approximately that of two randomly chosen and unrelated
sequences.
To use EST data in molecular systematics, sequences have
been initially BLASTed against a protein sequence database, e.g., the non-redundant protein database at NCBI,
and the highest scoring hits are taken to tentatively annotate the EST sequences [20]. Post-processing of the BLAST
results to infer the orthology status of the query-hit pair
ranged then from the application of simple e-value cutoffs, e.g., [21], to more complex procedures including
Markov Clustering and visual inspection of individual
sequence trees [2]. Problematic to these approaches is that
they unduly substitute e-values of a BLAST result with evolutionary relationships, involve too many human interactions to be routinely applied, or suffer from the
conceptual problem of Markov Clustering when applied
to non-overlapping sequence fragments representing the
same protein.
Here we present a novel approach, HaMStR, to extend predefined groups of orthologous genes derived from taxa,
whose genomes have been fully sequenced with data from
further taxa. We show that the joint application of a profile Hidden Markov Model (pHMM) based similarity
search and a subsequent re-BLAST of the hit sequences
against a reference proteome identifies candidate
orthologs. HaMStR exhibits a very low false positive rate
and good sensitivity. The resulting collection of orthologous sequences provides an excellent basis for phylogeny
reconstruction.

Results
Algorithm
Step 1 Defining a Gene Set for the Ortholog Search
1.1 Generation of core-orthologs
As input we introduce the primer-taxa (set) where each
taxon is completely sequenced and where the phylogeny
of the primer-taxa is undisputed. Standard orthology prediction tools such as InParanoid [12] or orthoMCL [18]
can be applied to identify genes with orthologs present in
all primer taxa, the so called core-ortholog groups. For
this study we compute orthologs for each pair of taxa with
InParanoid [12]. The pair-wise orthology predictions are
subsequently extended to include all primer taxa by using
a criterion of transitive closure (InParanoid-TC). We end
up with a collection of core-orthologs where in each individual core-ortholog every primer taxon is represented
exactly once. Details about this procedure are provided
online (see Additional file 1).
1.2 Generation of profile Hidden Markov Models
For each sequence cluster in the core-orthologs, the
sequences are aligned using MAFFT [22] with the options
--maxiterate 1000 and --localpair. The resulting multiple
Page 2 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:157

sequence alignments, comprising the n sequences from
the primer-taxa are then converted into a profile Hidden
Markov Model (pHMM) [23]. The programs hmmbuild
and hmmcalibrate from the HMMER package http://
hmmer.janelia.org are used for building, training and calibrating the pHMMs. Each core-ortholog is now represented by a pHMM.
Step 2 Extension of core-orthologs
We now extend the core-orthologs with data from additional taxa, the query-taxa. As data may serve translated
ESTs, or protein sequences inferred from either complete
or partially sequenced genomes.
2.1 pHMM search
We use a fast implementation of the hmmsearch algorithm
http://www.clccell.com to search protein sequence data
from the query-taxon for matches to the individual
pHMMs. If ESTs are the data for the query taxa, the individual ESTs are translated in all six reading frames prior to
the search.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/157

2.2 Re-BLAST and orthology prediction
To determine the orthology status of the hmmsearch hits,
we use a reciprocity criterion (Figure 1). Each hit is compared by BLASTP [24] to the proteome of one of the
primer-taxa, the so-called reference-taxon (Proteome F in
Figure 1). Ideally, the reference-taxon should be the closest related primer-taxon to the query-taxon. If the protein
of the reference taxon that contributed to the pHMM provides the best BLASTP hit, then the hmmsearch hit is added
to the corresponding core-ortholog. Otherwise, it is discarded. Please note that the reciprocity criterion is also fulfilled when the reference protein is among the lower
ranking BLASTP hits, but has the same score as the top
listed hit in the BLASTP output.
2.3 Post-processing of ESTs
To account for possible frame shifts caused by sequencing
errors in ESTs we use genewise [25] to generate a codonalignment for the EST and the protein sequence of the reference-taxon. This alignment determines the coding part
together with the reading frame in the EST.

Figure 1
Workflow of the HaMStR approach
Workflow of the HaMStR approach. Standard orthology prediction tools are used to identify orthologous groups, the so
called core-orthologs, for a set of completely sequenced primer taxa (Proteome A - F). The sequences in a core-ortholog are
aligned and converted into a profile HMM (pHMM). A compilation of protein sequences or translated ESTs from a taxon not
included in the primer-taxa (Protein set G) is searched for hits with the pHMM. The resulting candidates display features that
are characteristic for the protein modelled by the pHMM. To determine the orthology status of the candidates, we introduce a
reciprocity criterion. Each candidate is compared by BLASTP with the proteome of one of the primer-taxa, the so-called reference-taxon (Proteome F). If the best BLASTP hit sequence from the reference taxon corresponds to the protein that contributed to the pHMM, the candidate is called candidate-ortholog, else it is discarded.

primer-taxa set consists of opossum (Monodelphis domestica), sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis), fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), and a fungus
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The corresponding coreortholog set (PoP) represents 994 genes.
In the first scenario, we carried out step 1 of HaMStR and
extracted the opossum proteins from the 994 coreorthologs. Then we used InParanoid to infer the corresponding orthologs in the human proteome. InParanoid
identified 979 human-opossum ortholog clusters. For 15
opossum genes InParanoid did not find a human
ortholog.
In the second scenario, we applied step 2 of HaMStR with
the opossum as reference-taxon instead of using InParanoid. If HaMStR predicts more than one ortholog, we use
ClustalW [26] to align all candidates individually to the
opossum protein in the corresponding core-ortholog. The
human proteins are then ranked according to their alignment score. HaMStR predicted 976 human orthologs. For
the remaining 18 core-orthologs no human counterpart
was found.
For 972 core-orthologs the top ranking HaMStR ortholog
is the same as those found with InParanoid (Table 2).
Four human genes that have been found with InParanoid
were not detected in step 2 of HaMStR. In all instances,
InParanoid identified several proteins as co-orthologs to
the human gene. However, only one of these opossum
sequences was used to train the corresponding pHMMs.
During the re-BLAST (c.f. 2.2), a different co-ortholog
from the same InParanoid-ortholog cluster was obtained
as the best BLASTP hit. Thus, the reciprocity criterion was
not fulfilled and HaMStR did not make an orthology prediction.
One human gene was found with HaMStR but not with
InParanoid.

For three core-orthologs InParanoid and HaMStR suggested different human proteins. For the core-ortholog
represented by the opossum protein ENSMOD
P00000017416 InParanoid and HaMStR suggest as
orthologs the proteins ENSP00000363169 and
ENSP00000371363, respectively. Both proteins are InParanoid co-orthologs with respect to Ciona and with respect
to fishes. It appears plausible, that the gene duplication
giving rise to the protein pair ENSP00000363169/
ENSP00000371363 occurred recently, and presumably
around the same time as the split of the human and opossum lineages. This view is supported by the observation
that the BLAST score (InParanoid) of ENSM
ODP0000017416/ENSP00000363169 exceeds the score
of ENSMODP0000017416/ENSP00000371363, whereas
the scores of the global alignment (HaMStR) produce the
opposite result. Moreover, orthoMCL [18] groups both
human proteins together with the opossum protein in the
same ortholog cluster. A similar scenario applies to the
second case where InParanoid and HaMStR disagree
(Table 2). In the third case, ENSP00000222402 is according to HaMStR ortholog to the M. domestica protein
ENSMODP00000011077 whereas it is ortholog to
ENSMODP00000017386 according to InParanoid. The
latter protein, however, is present only as a truncated
sequence in our set of opossum proteins, lacking 8 amino
acids. This truncation results in the same BLASTP score in
the re-BLAST (c.f. 2.2) between ENSP00000222402 and
both opossum proteins. Again, orthoMCL groups these
proteins into the same ortholog cluster.
In summary, the HaMStR strategy is suitable for identifying orthologs for a pre-defined gene set. The results are
consistent with those obtained with one of the most efficient existing orthology prediction programs. For 168
core-orthologs, more than 1 human protein was assigned
as a putative ortholog. A detailed description of these
lower ranking hits is given in the online supplementary
material (see Additional file 2).
The HaMStR approach is efficient in identifying orthologs
when the entire sequence of the query protein is known.
In scenario 3, we assess the performance of HaMStR when
using translated ESTs. In many molecular systematics
studies, EST projects are typically small [21,27,7]. To
assess the performance of HaMStR in such cases, we did
not cluster the ESTs. Each single EST is now an input for
HaMStR.
As a typical example we selected 32,647 ESTs derived from
human chromosome 2 http://www.genome.ucsc.edu
according to the following criteria: A Blat search [28] with
each EST against the human genome sequence must
obtain a best hit on chromosome 2 covering at least 90%
of the EST. Moreover, the best Blat hit must be located
between the annotated start, and the end of the transcript

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/157

of an annotated gene (Ensembl database; http://
www.ensembl.org), and must overlap with a coding exon.
The 32,647 ESTs (hchr2-ESTs) map to 1,106 genes. From
the analyses in scenario 1 and 2 we know that only 81 of
these are represented by core-orthologs in the PoP primertaxa set. This set of 81 human chromosome 2 genes is
tagged by 6,288 ESTs (19%).
From the 32,647 hchr2-ESTs that served as HaMStR input,
29,293 were not assigned to any of the 994 core-orthologs
(Table 3). The remaining 3,354 ESTs are highly enriched
(97%) with ESTs tagging the 81 genes that are represented
in the PoP set. More precisely, 3,243 ESTs were assigned
correctly to 72 core-orthologs. The remaining 3% were
assigned to two core-orthologs for which the human gene
is not located on chromosome 2.
In summary, only 2 out of 74 core-orthologs were
wrongly extended with EST sequences. Also, on the EST
level only 111 ESTs were assigned to the wrong ortholog
cluster. Thus, the false positive rate was in both cases very
low (~3%).
The sensitivity for detecting an ortholog was also good.
From the 81 orthologs present on human chromosome 2
and represented by at least 1 hchr2-EST, HaMStR identified 72 (89%). On the level of individual EST sequences,
however, the sensitivity was substantially reduced. The 72
genes for which HaMStR predicted orthologs correctly are
represented by 5,899 hchr2-ESTs. HaMStR detected only
3,243 (55%) of these. The ESTs, that HaMStR failed to
assign, covered on average less than 13% of the coding
sequence of the corresponding gene. Thus, the encoded
protein fragment is too short to result in a significant hit
in the HaMStR search. Figure 2 displays the dependency of
the search result on the fraction of the coding sequence
(CDS) covered by an EST. The length distribution of the

missed ESTs explains why 9 core-orthologs represented by
389 hchr2-ESTs have been missed entirely. For these ESTs
the average coding sequence coverage was in the range of
13%.
Some ESTs, however, have not been assigned even though
the encoded protein fragment should be of sufficient
length (Figure 2). A visual inspection of a subset of these
ESTs indicates that most of them comprise splice variants
lacking one or several exons (data not shown).
In summary, the false positive rate of HaMStR is convincingly small and the sensitivity depends strongly on the
fraction of the CDS covered by an EST.
To increase the sensitivity of HaMStR, we re-designed the
pHMMs such that local alignments between sequence and
pHMM are generated during the search (options to the
hmmbuild command). Using HaMStR with the modified
pHMMs, it assigned 5,796 ESTs correctly to all 81 coreorthologs. Compared to the search with the default
pHMM structures, this indeed results in a substantially
higher sensitivity both on the level of detected genes and
ESTs (100% and 92%, respectively). However, 256 ESTs
were incorrectly assigned to 11 core-orthologs for which
the human ortholog is not located on human chromosome 2. Thus, the gain in sensitivity leads to a pronounced
increase of false positive predictions (12%).
Proof of principle: An EST based phylogeny of Fungi
We have shown that HaMStR efficiently extends coreorthologs with protein or translated EST sequences from

further taxa. Now we explore the applicability of the HaMStR approach for large-scale phylogenomic analyses. To
this end we analyzed the proteome from 16 completely
sequenced fungi and EST data from further 18 fungi (c.f.
Table 1). For taxa where ESTs and an annotated proteome
are available, we use the ESTs. The collection of 35 taxa,
including yeast, is a subset of the taxon set in Fitzpatrick
et al. (2006) [3].
HaMStR with H. sapiens, C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster, C.
elegans, and S. cerevisiae as primer taxa was used to compile the sets of orthologs. S. cerevisiae was used as the reference-taxon. Please note that we replaced M. domestica
that was used in the PoP set with H. sapiens, since the
human genome sequence is considered finished. After
running HaMStR with 1,031 core-orthologs and the data
from 34 fungi, we obtained a set of extended coreorthologs. For completely sequenced taxa orthologs to
almost all genes in the core-ortholog set were found (min:
933 (Y. lipolytica), max: 999 (K. lactis), mean: 973). For
taxa represented by only a few ESTs, the number of
detected orthologs ranges from 112 (T. asperellum) to 953
(A. nidulans) with a mean of 453. Thus, we have an incomplete taxa-gene matrix.
For the subsequent maximum likelihood tree reconstruction we used 178 genes. Each gene represents at least 40%
of the taxa and at the same time each taxon is represented
by at least 60% of these genes. The resulting tree has excellent branch support (Figure 3) and is by and large congruent to the phylogeny of these taxa, that was inferred from
an analysis of their entire genomes [3]. Only two taxa are
differently placed. Staganospora nodorum, a dothideomycete, is placed as a sister taxon to the Eurotiomycetes,
whereas it is sister to the Sordariomycetes/Leothiomycetes
clade in Fitzpatrick et al. (2006) [3]. Aspergillus nidulans is
positioned basal to the other Aspergillus species instead of
grouping together with A. fumigatus. We cannot rule out
the possibility that the differences might be due to erroneous orthology predictions by HaMStR. However, the following explanations argue against a wrong prediction.

For S. nodorum, the entire annotated proteome was used.
As exemplified in our validation of HaMStR (c.f. Table 2),
errors in the orthology prediction are unlikely for entire
proteomes. The discrepancy between both trees may be
caused by the fact that S. nodorum is the only representative of the Dothideomycetes. Together with the short
internal branches in this region of the trees an accurate
placement of this single taxon is difficult [29]. Moreover,
as of today, the Fungi section of the ITOL-project http://
tolweb.org/fungi considers the placement of Dothideomycetes as still unresolved.

Discussion
ESTs constitute a paradigm of a random sample of fragments from a species' gene set. We show that HaMStR is
capable of automatically predicting orthologs for a predefined set of genes (core-orthologs) in such data. The
results are consistent with orthology predictions obtained
with reciprocal BLAST based orthology prediction tools,
which however require completely sequenced and annotated genomes. HaMStR performs a targeted search to
extend predefined ortholog clusters derived from the analysis of complete genome sequences. This approach has
three major advantages.

derived from ESTs. No quality information was available
for these sequences, indicating that sequencing errors
could interfere with the correct placement of A. nidulans in
our phylogenetic tree. However, our A. nidulans placement agrees with other results [30].
Our example clearly shows that HaMStR is well suited to
compile phylogenomic datasets, including incomplete
sequence data like ESTs or unfinished whole genome
sequencing projects.
Implementation
We offer the HaMStR tool online and for download at
http://www.deep-phylogeny.org/hamstr. Currently, the
users can search EST data for orthologs to core-orthologs
derived from six predefined sets of primer-taxa, covering
different regions of the metazoan tree. The referencetaxon for the re-BLAST can be selected from the taxa that
constitute the primer-taxa. To increase EST data quality,

First, we search for orthologs only to genes for which
whole genome comparisons provide prior evidence that
orthologs can be identified. For example, core-orthologs
including sequences from fungi and animals represent
evolutionary old genes that were already present in the
last common ancestor of both groups. Thus, an ortholog
search for these genes in incomplete and fragmentary
data, such as ESTs, from fungi or animals has a good
chance of success. In the other extreme, genes with predicted orthologs confined to e.g. vertebrates are presumably of evolutionary recent origin or have diverged beyond
recognition in taxa outside the vertebrates. Thus, a search
for orthologs in ESTs from non-vertebrates will probably
fail.
Second, the pHMMs constructed from the core-orthologs
allow for a more refined ortholog search compared to a
conventional BLAST. In our case example with the human
ESTs HaMStR has a very low fraction of false positives
(3%, c.f. Table 3). The low fraction of false positive orthology predictions by HaMStR comes at the price of low sensitivity. This is due to the fact that we try to match the
pHMM over its entire length to the individual query
sequences. ESTs, however, are generally short and cover in
most cases only a fraction of the coding sequence. Our
search may, therefore, be too stringent. Clustering ESTs
prior to the HaMStR search is an obvious strategy to
address this problem. However, especially in small EST
projects many genes will have only a small fraction of
their CDS covered by ESTs, even after clustering. Performing local alignments between sequence and pHMM substantially increases the sensitivity both on the level of

detected genes and ESTs (100% and 92%, respectively).
Thus, the gain in sensitivity leads to a pronounced
increase of false positive predictions (12%). Still, this false
positive rate is substantially smaller compared to that of
other orthology prediction programs based on a reciprocal best BLAST hit when used with ESTs (data not shown).
However, this emphasizes that short local similarities
between sequences make orthology inference hard. Most
studies -particularly in molecular systematics- rely on an
accurate orthology prediction and results can be severely
compromised by false positives in the data set. It is a
major advance of HaMStR that it automatically filters
sequences for which the orthology prediction is unreliable
and we suggest using the global pHMM search as default.

tion method, e.g., orthoMCL [18]. By that HaMStR can be
adapted to the particular evolutionary problem one is
interested in. If the HaMStR output serves as a data basis
for a standard phylogenomics study, many approaches
require that each taxon should be represented only by one
sequence per gene. In such cases core-orthologs determined with InParanoid-TC or the recently developed
OMA-algorithm [32] are a good starting point for HaMStR. On the other hand, if one is interested in the evolution of a gene family, it may be desirable that the ortholog
cluster used by HaMStR also contains co-orthologs. In
such cases ortholog groups from more inclusive orthology
prediction programs can be used as core-orthologs.

Conclusion
Third, HaMStR is computationally efficient. The use of
core-orthologs limits the search to only those genes where
we expect to find orthologs. Moreover, also targeted
ortholog searches are possible.
The performance of HaMStR depends on the choice of the
primer-taxa and on the method to determine the coreorthologs. Primer-taxa should cover the diversity of the
taxa of interest and thus constitute a scaffold of the corresponding phylogenetic tree. To address the evolutionary
relationships of 35 fungal taxa we have used H. sapiens, C.
intestinalis, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae as
primer-taxa. In principle, a primer taxon set including several fungi is more appropriate. It would minimize the evolutionary distance to the taxon in which the HaMStR
search will be performed. It would also allow searching
for orthologs to genes that emerged on the fungal lineage
or got lost in metazoa. However, we deliberately did not
adapt the primer-taxa. By doing so, we addressed the question of how phylogenomic datasets compiled with HaMStR perform, when no or only a single completely
sequenced genome exists for a taxon group of interest. The
reconstructed tree for the 35 fungi is entirely resolved,
highly supported and compatible to other published phylogenies [3,30]. This indicates that HaMStR, together with
this primer-taxon set serves in general as a good starting
point for any phylogenomic study within fungi and animals.
For building and training of the pHMMs, a large number
of diverse primer-taxa is favorable. However, this holds
only if the annotation of genes in the individual genomes
is comprehensive. Despite the small set of primer-taxa,
each core-ortholog was extended by at least one fungal
sequence. Thus, the considerably small set of sequences
used to train the pHMMs appears not to impair the sensitivity of the ortholog search in this particular case.
We determined the core-orthologs with InParanoid-TC
(see Additional file 1). However, HaMStR allows the use
of core-orthologs determined with any orthology predic-

HaMStR extends in a standardized manner a pre-defined
set of orthologs with proteins or ESTs from further taxa. A
profile Hidden Markov Model that captures the essential
features of the known orthologs is used in the ortholog
search. The introduction of a reciprocity criterion into the
ortholog search makes the orthology predictions symmetric, as is the case when complete proteomes are compared.
Variation of the pHMM structure allows searches at different stringency. One may either carry out an alignment of
part of the EST- or protein sequence against the entire profile (stringent), or a local alignment of the sequence
against part of the profile (relaxed). Profile HMMs used in
the HaMStR search can be based on arbitrary primer-taxa
and any source of initial orthology predictions. Thus, our
procedure is applicable regardless of the molecular systematics problem one is interested in. Testing the performance of HaMStR on a test set of human EST
sequences revealed a remarkably low false positive rate of
the orthology predictions with good sensitivity. The
reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree for 35 fungal taxa
based on 178 genes shows that HaMStR can compile
informative data sets for contemporary phylogenomic
studies. Our procedure may help to standardize data
acquisition for studies in molecular systematics, allowing
for a better comparability between individual results.

Methods
For phylogeny reconstruction we aligned the ortholog
cluster individually with MAFFT --maxiterate 1000 --localpair [22]. The alignments were concatenated using the perl
script concatenate_alignments.pl. Alignment columns containing more than 50% undetermined amino acid positions or gaps were removed with the perl script degapper.pl.
Both scripts are available upon request. Maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstruction was performed with
RAxML [33]. The consensus tree from 100 bootstrap replicates was computed with TREE-PUZZLE [34] and the
percentages of bootstrap trees supporting a split in the
consensus tree were used as branch support values. All
datasets compiled in this study are available upon request.
