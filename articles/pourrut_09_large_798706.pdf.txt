Abstract
Background: Ebola and Marburg viruses cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans.
Recently, bats of multiple species have been identified as possible natural hosts of Zaire ebolavirus
(ZEBOV) in Gabon and Republic of Congo, and also of marburgvirus (MARV) in Gabon and
Democratic Republic of Congo.
Methods: We tested 2147 bats belonging to at least nine species sampled between 2003 and 2008
in three regions of Gabon and in the Ebola epidemic region of north Congo for IgG antibodies
specific for ZEBOV and MARV.
Results: Overall, IgG antibodies to ZEBOV and MARV were found in 4% and 1% of bats,
respectively. ZEBOV-specific antibodies were found in six bat species (Epomops franqueti,
Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Micropteropus pusillus, Mops condylurus and Rousettus
aegyptiacus), while MARV-specific antibodies were only found in Rousettus aegyptiacus and
Hypsignathus monstrosus. The prevalence of MARV-specific IgG was significantly higher in R.
aegyptiacus members captured inside caves than elsewhere. No significant difference in prevalence
was found according to age or gender. A higher prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG was found in
pregnant females than in non pregnant females.
Conclusion: These findings confirm that ZEBOV and MARV co-circulate in Gabon, the only
country where bats infected by each virus have been found. IgG antibodies to both viruses were
detected only in Rousettus aegyptiacus, suggesting that this bat species may be involved in the natural
cycle of both Marburg and Ebola viruses. The presence of MARV in Gabon indicates a potential risk
for a first human outbreak. Disease surveillance should be enhanced in areas near caves.

Background
Filoviridae, a family of single-stranded non segmented
RNA viruses, comprises two genera, marburgvirus (MARV)
and ebolavirus (EBOV), the latter comprising Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) and
Bundibungyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) [1,2]. Filoviruses cause
hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in humans, with high case
fatality rates (except for REBOV). Seventeen outbreaks
and two isolated cases of human EBOV infection have
been reported, in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
(1976, 1977, 1995, 2007, 2008), Sudan (1976, 1979,
2004), Gabon (1994, 1996, 1997, 2001), Republic of
Congo (RC) (2001, 2003, 2005), Ivory Coast (1995) and
Uganda (2000, 2007) [2-4]. Three outbreaks and four isolated cases of human MARV infection have been reported,
in Germany and the former Yugoslavia (1967), Zimbabwe
(1975), Kenya (1980, 1987), DRC (1998-1999), Angola
(2005) and Uganda (2007) [5]. Consistent with this epidemiological pattern, ecologic niche modeling of outbreaks and isolated cases has suggested that Ebola
hemorrhagic fever occurs in the rain forests of central and
western Africa, and Marburg in more open areas of central
and western Africa [6,7]. In Gabon and RC, most human
ZEBOV outbreaks have occurred through contact with
infected animal carcasses, especially great apes and duikers [8]. Bats were recently identified as potential reservoir
species of these filoviruses [3,9,10]. During the ZEBOV
outbreaks that occurred between 2001 and 2003 in
Gabon and RC, numerous animals were captured in the
search for reservoir species. Of the 1024 small mammals
sampled, including 679 bats, ZEBOV-specific antibodies
were detected in the serum of 16 (8%) of 192 fruit bats
belonging to three species, namely Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata; ZEBOV
RNA was detected in pooled liver and spleen samples
from 13 (5%) of 279 such bats [11]. Sequence analysis
indicated that bats of these species might serve as a
ZEBOV natural host. A large-scale serological survey of
bats belonging to these three species was then conducted,
with 1390 specimens captured between 2003 and 2006 in
three regions of Gabon and in the epidemic border region
with RC. The prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG was about
5% in bats from all four regions, and fell to about 1% at
all four sites a year after the most recent Ebola outbreak,
which occurred in 2005 in RC [12]. These results indicate
that ZEBOV-specific antibodies are widely distributed in
these bats in Gabon and RC, supporting their potential
reservoir status. As a Marburg outbreak occurred in 2005
in Angola, 800 km from the Gabon border, we also tested
bats for signs of MARV infection. Of 438 bats collected in
Gabon and RC, MARV-specific IgG was detected in the
serum of 29 of 242 specimens of Rousettus aegyptiacus, and
MARV nucleotide sequences were detected in four members of 283 bats of the same species, suggesting that R.
aegyptiacus bats may be a MARV reservoir [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/159

In the present study, we documented the distribution of
ZEBOV- and MARV-specific antibodies in bat communities living in forest areas of Gabon and northern RC. We
report detailed serologic results for 2147 bats belonging to
at least nine species sampled between 2003 and 2008.

Methods
Collection sites and periods
Samples were collected in the Republic of Congo and
Gabon (Figure 1).

In the Republic of Congo, two sites were sampled near
Mbomo (0°25' O; 14°41' E) and Odzala National Park.
The vegetation includes dense semi-deciduous and evergreen forest with open and closed canopies. The climate is
equatorial, with two dry seasons (December-February and
June-August) and two wet seasons (March-May and September-November). In Gabon, bats were collected in
three different regions. The first was situated in HautOgooué province in the south-east of the country (near
Franceville 1°37' S; 13°36' E). Four sites comprising forested areas, savannas and a cave were sampled. The vegetation forms a savanna-forest mosaic. The climate is
tropical-transitional, with one clear dry season (JuneAugust) and one long wet season (September-May), with
lower rainfall in December and January. The second
region was located in Moyen-Ogooué province in west
Gabon (near Lambaréné 0°41' S; 11°01' E). Bats were collected from three different biotopes. The climate is tropical-transitional and humid. The forest vegetation is semideciduous with lakes, rivers and swamps. The third region
was in Nyanga province, in south-west Gabon (near Tchibanga 2°51' S; 11°01' E). The vegetation is composed of
an evergreen forest with savanna areas and caves. The climate is tropical with a long dry season (May-September)
and a long wet season (October-April).
Collection periods
In RC, bats were collected both during ZEBOV outbreaks
in June 2003 and May 2005 and also one year after the last
outbreak in May 2006. In Gabon, bats were collected in
Haut-Ogooué in February 2005, October 2006 and March
2008, in Moyen Ogooué in April 2005, and in Nyanga in
February 2006.
Bat trapping and blood sampling
Bats were trapped with mist nets. The nets were set in the
early evening, and captured animals were removed each
morning. The captured bats were transported to a field
laboratory specially designed for this study, a few kilometers from the capture sites, where they were euthanized.
Weight and body measurements, sexing and species determination were performed as previously described [12].
Blood was collected in EDTA tubes by cardiac puncture
and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm
for 10 min, then placed in Cryovials (VWR Prolabo, FonPage 2 of 10

tenay-sous-Bois, France) and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Fragments of liver and spleen were obtained by necropsy
and immediately frozen. At the end of each capture period
the samples were transported to Franceville for analysis at
the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de
Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon. For ethical aspects, a special
authorization was delivered for this study by the Ministry
of Health of Gabon (Pr Kombila Kouma Pierre, n°104/
MSPP/SG/DGS, on 17 February 2005).
Serological studies
Sera were tested with a standard IgG ELISA as previously
described [12]. Briefly, ZEBOV antigens diluted 1:1000 in
phosphate buffered saline were passively adsorbed overnight at +4°C onto ELISA Maxisorp plates (VWR Prolabo,
Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). The protocol was the same
for MARV antigens. Control wells were coated with unin-

fected cultured Vero cell antigens (mock antigens). The
plates were washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween 20.
One hundred microliters of each serum sample diluted
1:100 in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free milk
powder (Becton Dickinson, Temse, Belgium) was added
to each well and incubated overnight at +4°C. After three
washes, 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of peroxidase-labeled protein A (1 mg/ml) (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) and peroxidase-labeled protein G (1 mg/ml) (Sigma,
Taufkirchen, Germany) diluted 1:1000 in PBS-0.1%
Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free milk was added to each
well. The plates were incubated for one hour at room temperature and washed. TMB substrate (Thermo Electron
Corporation, Saint Herblain, France) was used for detection. Optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm with
a PR 5100 ELISA plate reader (Biorad, Marnes-laCoquette, France). All samples were also tested by using

BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:159

HPR-conjugated goat anti-bat IgG (1 mg/ml) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, USA) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-0.1%
Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free milk. Samples from bats
with corrected OD values > 0.31 (see below) were additionally tested at 1:400 and 1:1600 dilutions.
Cut-off determination
The specific activity of each serum at each dilution (corrected OD) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific
background OD (wells with mock antigen) from the OD
of wells with virus antigens. The cut-off value was calculated assuming a negative exponential distribution of positive OD values for negative bats. The parameters of the
exponential distribution were derived from the distribution of the collected OD values and a risk of error in order
to discard false-positives. With a 0.001 risk of error, the
cut-off was 0.31 for both Ebola and Marburg viruses (Figure 2).
Virological studies
Specific ZEBOV and MARV RNAs were detected in liver
and spleen by means of real-time and nested PCR amplification as previously described [12,13]. For each bat,
approximately 100 mg of tissue was incubated overnight
at 4°C in 450 μl of cold 2× cellular lysis buffer (Applied
Biosystems International, France) to inactivate viruses.
Each tissue was then diluted to 1× and homogenized for 2
minutes, at 1500 strokes/min using a ball-mill tissue
grinder (Geno/grinder 2000, BTC and OPS Diagnostics,
Bridgewater, USA). Total RNA was extracted from ~150 μl
of the homogenate and tested for ZEBOV or MARV using
real-time or nested RT-PCR assays as previously described
[12,13]. High-fidelity RT-PCR reagents (Biological Diagnostic Supplies Limited, Dreghorn, United Kingdom)
were used for all conventional RT-PCR assays. ZEBOV
nucleotide sequences [Genbank:DQ205409-DQ205415]
and MARV nucleotide sequences [Genbank:EU068108EU068113] of some bats tested in this study have previously been described [11,13].
Statistical Analysis
Access software (Microsoft 2007) was used for data analysis. Seroprevalence rates were compared with the Chisquare test and Fisher's test, implemented with Epi Info
software (6.04, Epiconcept, France). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05.

Results
Bat collections
We collected 2147 bats belonging to at least nine species
(Figure 1): 1235 specimens (58%) in Ogooué-Ivindo/
Mbomo (8 species), 440 (20%) in Haut-Ogooué (8 species), 272 (13%) in Moyen Ogooué (7 species) and 200
(9%) in Nyanga (7 species). Most bats belonged to the
species Epomops franqueti and Myonycteris torquata in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/159

Ogooué-Ivindo, E. franqueti in Haut-Ogooué, Roussetus
aegyptiacus in Moyen-Ogooué and R. aegyptiacus and M.
torquata in Nyanga. Bats of six species were present at all
the sites, namely E. franqueti (8-64% of captured bats of
this species by site), Hypsignathus monstrosus (1-8%), Megaloglossus woermanni (1-10%), Micropteropus pusillus (113%), R. aegyptiacus (1-66%) and M. torquata (1-36%)
(Figure 1). Twenty-four members of the Microchiroptera
were captured but they were not all identified to the species level, owing to a lack of expertise in the field and
because voucher specimens were not preserved.
Prevalence of ZEBOV- and MARV-specific IgG
Overall seroprevalence
Among the bats captured in Gabon and RC, 2147 were
tested for ZEBOV-specific IgG and 1876 (87%) for MARVspecific IgG. The respective prevalence rates were 4% (n =
95) and 1% (n = 25) (Table 1). Sera from 15 of the 95
ZEBOV-positive bats had OD values > 0.31 when diluted
1:400, and one when diluted 1:1600 (Figure 3A). Sera
from four of the 25 MARV-positive bats had OD values >
0.31 when diluted 1:400 (Figure 3B).
Prevalence by species
ZEBOV-specific IgG was found in 4 (2%) of 197 Micropteropus pusillus, 19 (3%) of 573 Myonycteris torquata, 36 (4%)
of 805 Epomops franqueti, 9 (7%) of 125 Hypsignathus monstrosus, 24 (8%) of 307 Rousettus aegyptiacus and 3 (12%)
of 24 Microchiroptera (Table 1). The prevalence of
ZEBOV-specific IgG was significantly higher (p = 0.005) in
R. aegyptiacus specimens than in the bats of other species,
with the exception of H. monstrosus (p = 0.82). The Microchiroptera group comprises several bat species and could
not meaningfully compared with the bats of other species
because of the small sample size. MARV-specific IgG was
found in 21 (7%) of 299 R. aegyptiacus, 1 (1%) of 103 H.
monstrosus, 1 (0.6%) of 177 M. pusillus and 2 (0.3%) of
679 E. franqueti (Table 1). Five R. aegyptiacus (3 from
Haut-Ogooué, 1 each from Ogooué-Ivindo/RC and
Moyen-Ogooué) were positive for both ZEBOV and
MARV.
Prevalence by site and year
There were no significant differences (p = 0.7) in the prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG across the sites: 23 of 440
bats (5%) in Haut-Ogooué, 12 of 272 (4%) in Moyen
Ogooué, 10 of 200 (5%) in Nyanga and 50 of 1235 (4%)
in Ogooué-Ivindo/Mbomo (Figure 1). There was a temporal variation in the ZEBOV-specific IgG prevalence rates:
in Mbomo (a region of documented Ebola outbreaks) the
ZEBOV-specific IgG prevalence rate was 8 of 168 (5%) in
2003, 26 of 314 (8%) in 2005 and 10 of 494 (2%) in
2006. In Haut-Ogooué the ZEBOV-specific IgG prevalence
rate was 10 of 154 (7%) in 2005, 3 of 130 (2%) in 2006
and 3 of 73 (4%) in 2008 (Table 2).

rate was higher (p = 0.004) in pregnant females (21 (8%)
of 268) than in non-pregnant females (22 (3%) of 648).
The prevalence of MARV-specific IgG was not different

Data are numbers of ZEBOV IgG-positive bats versus numbers of captured bats, and (row) percentages. Only data for the three bat species
suspected of being EBOV reservoirs are reported.

(in 16 of 192 bats) and ZEBOV RNA (in 13 of 279 bats)
in E. franqueti, H. monstrosus and M. torquata specimens
captured in the Ebola outbreak zone of northern Gabon
and Congo between 2001 and 2003, and deduced that
these three bat species might represent a ZEBOV reservoir
[11]. Phylogenetic analyses of the seven sequences
obtained from the 13 ZEBOV RNA positive bats showed
very few differences relative to known human sequences
(approximately 1% of nucleotide positions in the L gene),
confirming that Ebola virus detected in bats corresponded
to the ZEBOV species. We subsequently detected MARVspecific IgG (in 29 of 242 bats) and MARV RNA (in 4 of
283 bats) in specimens of R. aegyptiacus captured in southern and southwestern Gabon in 2005 and deduced that
this species might represent a MARV reservoir. Phylogenetic analysis of the MARV sequences obtained from the
bats, in the N and VP 35 genes, showed approximately 5%
nucleotide divergence relative to the other western African
Marburg virus lineage, Angola, a difference far smaller
than the 15% diversity previously observed among East
African Marburg virus isolates. This pointed to the existence of a geographic cluster including Angolan human
MARV strains and Gabonese bat strains [13]. No blood
samples were available from ZEBOV PCR-positive bats
identified during our previous studies. However, all
MARV PCR-positive bats were also positive for anti-MARV
IgG [13].

Here we report the results of a large serological survey of
ZEBOV and MARV in bats living in three regions of Gabon
and northwest RC. In addition to the bats studied before,
we examined additional specimens for ZEBOV infection
(238 for IgG, 1468 for RNA) and for MARV (1438 for both
IgG and RNA). We detected both ZEBOV-specific IgG
(4%) and MARV-specific IgG (1%) in all four regions,
confirming that the two viruses cocirculate in Gabon.
This is the first study to provide evidence of simultaneous
ZEBOV and MARV circulation in bat populations in the
same country. Several human ZEBOV outbreaks have
occurred in Gabon, but no MARV outbreaks have been
reported.
Interestingly, of the nine species reported here, specimens
of six species (E. franqueti, H. monstrosus, M. torquata, M.
pusillus, R. aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus) had ZEBOVspecific IgG and specimens of four species (R. aegyptiacus,
H. monstrosus, E. franqueti, and M. pusillus) had MARV-specific IgG (Table 1). ZEBOV seroprevalence rates were high
in four species, while a high MARV seroprevalence rate
was found in only one species (R. aegyptiacus). Together
with the elevated antibody titers (at least 1:400) found in

these bats, these finding indicate that these bats have frequent contacts with ZEBOV and MARV.
In an earlier study in DRC, members of three bat species
were found to be seropositive for MARV (R. aegyptiacus
and two members of the Microchiroptera group: Rhinolophus eloquens and Miniopterus inflatus) [14], possibly
because they roosted in close proximity at the capture
sites. In Gabon, no specimens belonging to these last two
species were captured during our field studies. Surprisingly, ZEBOV-specific IgG was also frequent in R. aegyptiacus (8%). No specimens of this species were sampled
between 2001 and 2003 in northern Gabon/Congo
[11,15]. ZEBOV seropositivity in R. aegyptiacus bats likely
reflects true viral infection, although passive antigenic
stimulation cannot be ruled out. In Gabon, Megachiroptera members, including R. aegyptiacus, E. franqueti, M.
torquata and H. monstrosus bats, consume the same fruits
(especially Ficus spp). Bats of different species tend to visit
the same trees, and interspecies virus transmission (or
simple antigenic stimulation) could occur via infected

saliva deposited on fruits. Hendra virus and Nipah virus
transmission has been suggested to occur in this way
between bats belonging to Asian Pteropus species [16].
Among IgG-positive R. aegyptiacus specimens, 21 (42%)
were positive for MARV, 24 (48%) were positive for
ZEBOV, and 6 (10%) were positive for both viruses.
Although dual infection and/or antigenic stimulation
could explain the concomitant presence of ZEBOV- and
MARV-specific IgG in individual bats, serological crossreactions between Ebola and Marburg antigens cannot be
ruled out.
The ZEBOV seroprevalence rates were very similar (4% to
5%) in the four sampling regions (Figure 1). By contrast,
the MARV seroprevalence rate was higher (about 2%) in
the three regions where R. aegyptiacus was abundantly captured. Although some groups of R. aegyptiacus may occasionally roost outside in the trees, the bats of this species
usually roost in natural or man-made cavities (caves,
mines, tombs, etc.) and search for food at night. The daily

flight distances are unknown. Among the 299 R. aegyptiacus specimens sampled in Gabon, the MARV-specific IgG
prevalence rate was significantly higher in the animals
captured in caves (14%) than in those captured elsewhere
(4%) (Table 3). This difference could be due to a higher
circulation of MARV between the bats living in the caves.
Similarly, a high MARV-specific IgG prevalence rate
(about 20%) has been reported in DRC in a cave-captured
population of R. aegyptiacus [14]. Together, these findings
point to the existence of two different ecological biotopes
for Marburg and Ebola viruses: one linked to bats roosting
in caves (Rousettus or Microchiroptera species) and the
other linked to bats roosting in trees in the open forest.
The ecology of H. monstrosus depends on water supplies,
and these bats are known to migrate locally, especially
along rivers [17]. Thus, the geographic distribution of
ZEBOV in its reservoir species may be very broad, encompassing the forested areas of Africa, especially close to rivers, as previously reported [6,7]. In contrast, the
distribution of Marburg virus would be determined by the
ecology (horizontal and vertical distribution) of R. aegyptiacus bats and the presence of caves. Our serological
results strongly suggest that ZEBOV and MARV overlap in
all four regions we sampled in Gabon and RC.
The prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG fell from about 5%
in 2003 and 8% in 2005 in Mbomo and 7% in HautOgooué (during ZEBOV outbreaks) to 2% at both sites in
2006 (one year after the last outbreak), before rising again
to 4% in Haut-Ogooué in 2008 (Table 2). Similar seasonal variations in the IgG prevalence of other viral pathogens (European Bat Lyssavirus-1, Hendra virus, etc.)
have also been described in bats [18,19]. These fluctuations could be due to factors such as changes in bat numbers (due to mortality, migration, influx of young
animals, etc.), immunological parameters (antibody persistence) and environmental changes (fructification, etc.).
Long-term studies of seasonal variations in the ZEBOVspecific IgG prevalence in bat populations might help to
understand the dynamics of human Ebola outbreaks.
The higher prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG in pregnant
females (8%) than in non pregnant females (3%) (Table
5) suggests that EBOV transmission between males and
females could occur by contact with infected saliva (bites,
licking) or by mating. Pregnant female Pteropus scapulatus
bats in Australia were recently shown to be more susceptible than their non pregnant counterparts to Hendra virus
infection, and it has been suggested that Hendra virus
transmission may occur by contact with the infected placenta [19].

Conclusion
We confirm the cocirculation of Ebola and Marburg
viruses in Gabon. To date, Gabon is the only country

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/159

where bat reservoirs of both viruses have also been identified. Of all the bats sampled in significant numbers in this
survey, only specimens of Rousettus aegyptiacus were found
to harbor both MARV- and ZEBOV-specific IgG, suggesting that this species may be a natural host of both viruses.
The presence of MARV in Gabon, where no human Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreaks have been reported,
represents a potential and previously unrecognized threat
to humans. As the MARV seroprevalence was significantly
higher in R. aegyptiacus bats captured inside caves than
elsewhere, caves and their surroundings should be considered as high-risk areas.
