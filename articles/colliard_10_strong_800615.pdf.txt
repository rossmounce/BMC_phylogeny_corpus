Strong reproductive barriers in a narrow hybrid
zone of West-Mediterranean green toads (Bufo
viridis subgroup) with Plio-Pleistocene divergence

Abstract
Background: One key question in evolutionary biology deals with the mode and rate at which reproductive
isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation. Little is known about secondary contacts of recently diverged
anuran species. Here we conduct a multi-locus field study to investigate a contact zone between two lineages of
green toads with an estimated divergence time of 2.7 My, and report results from preliminary experimental crosses.
Results: The Sicilian endemic Bufo siculus and the Italian mainland-origin B. balearicus form a narrow hybrid zone
east of Mt. Etna. Despite bidirectional mtDNA introgression over a ca. 40 km North-South cline, no F1 hybrids could
be found, and nuclear genomes display almost no admixture. Populations from each side of the contact zone
showed depressed genetic diversity and very strong differentiation (FST = 0.52). Preliminary experimental crosses
point to a slightly reduced fitness in F1 hybrids, a strong hybrid breakdown in backcrossed offspring (F1 x parental,
with very few reaching metamorphosis) and a complete and early mortality in F2 (F1 x F1).
Conclusion: Genetic patterns at the contact zone are molded by drift and selection. Local effective sizes are
reduced by the geography and history of the contact zone, B. balearicus populations being at the front wave of a
recent expansion (late Pleistocene). Selection against hybrids likely results from intrinsic genomic causes (disruption
of coadapted sets of genes in backcrosses and F2-hybrids), possibly reinforced by local adaptation (the ranges of
the two taxa roughly coincide with the borders of semiarid and arid climates). The absence of F1 in the field might
be due to premating isolation mechanisms. Our results, show that these lineages have evolved almost complete
reproductive isolation after some 2.7 My of divergence, contrasting sharply with evidence from laboratory
experiments that some anuran species may still produce viable F1 offspring after > 20 My of divergence.

Background
One key question in evolutionary biology deals with the
mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation [for overview: [1]].
Johns and Avise [2] estimated the average mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA)-based genetic distance between congeneric species in amphibians to be > 7.0 My, suggesting
absence of natural hybridization in taxa of that age. A
few major results on intrinsic reproductive isolation in
anurans come from artificial hybridization experiments.
Sasa et al. [3] reported hybrid sterility or inviability in
46 frog species to be positively correlated with Nei’s
genetic distance (allozymes). Measuring albumin

distances among 50 species pairs, Wilson et al. [4]
showed that frogs could still produce viable hybrids with
an average immunological distance of 7.4% (= ca. 21
My). Using Blair’s [5] crossing experiments in Bufo,
Malone & Fontenot [6] showed the hatching success,
the number of larvae produced, and the percentage of
tadpoles reaching metamorphosis to be inversely related
with genetic divergence, some metamorphosing offspring being still produced with a distance of 8%
(mtDNA). All of these laboratory data suggest that
reproductive isolation increases gradually with phylogenetic distance, presumably driven by complex genomic
processes rather than by a few speciation genes, and
that very large time scales (in the order of tens of millions of years) are required to achieve hybrid infertility
or inviability.

Under natural conditions, however, reproductive isolation could arise much earlier than detected in the
laboratory. In frogs, as in many other taxa, “surveys of
natural hybrid zones (...) in the field are needed to complement laboratory-based studies to establish the significance and strength of specific barriers in nature” [7].
Little is known about secondary contact in allopatrically
diverged lineages of anurans, where reproductive isolation may quickly arise as a result of reinforcement [8],
in addition to genetic drift and local adaptation. Extant
studies of contact zones in anurans have mostly focused
on hybrid fitness [9,10] or on mechanisms of pre- or
post-mating isolation [9-15]. Such studies classically
relied on allozymes [e.g. [9,11-13]] or (more recently)
nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers [e.g.
[10,14,15]], but often lack any molecular-based estimates
of divergence times, which are at best inferred from
geological information. Some phylogeographic studies
include molecular-based estimates of divergence time [e.
g. [16-20]], but very few have combined such estimates
with multi-locus transect approaches to infer the time
required to reach reproductive isolation in natural contexts [e.g. [8,21,22]].
The current study focuses on Palearctic green toads
[Bufo viridis subgroup, [18]]. After range-wide phylogeographic analyses, secondary contact zones of clades were
predicted [18,23], in which possible hybridization can be
examined using fast evolving molecular markers. To do
this, we recently developed microsatellites for two WestMediterranean species [24]: B. balearicus (Boettger 1880;
Peninsular Italy, north-eastern Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia,
Balearic Islands), and B. siculus [[23]; endemic to Sicily,
Figure 1]. Using a Bayesian-coalescence approach
(mtDNA control region and 16 S rRNA), divergence time
for the two species was estimated to late Pliocene (2.7
My), with a range from the early Pliocene (4.9 My) to
Pleistocene (1.1 My) [23]. A single record of Italian mainland-origin B. balearicus in north-eastern Sicily [18] suggests their recent (late Pleistocene) invasion into Sicily,
where they may secondarily meet the endemic B. siculus.
In this work, we combined mitochondrial and nuclear
intronic sequences with multilocus microsatellite markers to examine (i) whether B. siculus and B. balearicus
meet each other in north-eastern Sicily, (ii) if so,
whether these two closely related species hybridize, and
(iii) in such a case, what are the patterns of hybridization. In parallel, we conducted limited and preliminary
experimental crosses to help interpreting field data.

(D-loop) and nuclear (Tropomyosine intron) DNA

sequences show two highly homogeneous and strongly
distinct clades (Figure 2), corresponding to B. balearicus
and B. siculus. The tropomyosine tree displays a clear
geographic pattern: the balearicus clade includes all
individuals from mainland Italy (populations 1 to 8, Figure 1, Table 1) and north-eastern Sicily, southwards to
population 14 (east coast), while the siculus clade
includes individuals from western and southern Sicilian
populations, from population 15 (East coast) south-westwards. This pattern points to a very narrow contact
zone separating populations 14 and 15, between the
Mount Etna and the Ionian coast (Figure 1b).
The mtDNA clades also show a clear geographic signal, with however, some overlap. Populations from
mainland Italy (pop. 1 to 8) and north-eastern Sicily
(pop. 9 to 12) present only balearicus haplotypes, and
populations from western and southern Sicily (pop. 16
to 24) only siculus, but haplotypes from both clades are
found in populations 13 to 15, around the contact zone
identified with tropomyosine.
These phylogenetic trees also provide evidence for
past hybridization, as revealed by cytonuclear disequilibria (see highlighted individuals in Figure 2): one individual from pop. 14 possesses balearicus tropomyosine
alleles but a siculus mtDNA-haplotype, while three individuals from pop. 15 present siculus tropomyosine
alleles but balearicus mtDNA haplotypes.
These patterns of mitochondrial distribution were
widely confirmed by larger-scale mitotyping (Figure 1).
All populations on the Apennine Peninsula (pop. 1 to 8)
and four populations (pop. 9 to 12) from the North-East
of Sicily presented only B. balearicus haplotypes. All
populations from western and southern Sicily (pop. 16
to 22) and the two islands off the coast of western Sicily
(pop. 23, 24) presented only B. siculus haplotypes. In the
three populations east of Mount Etna (pop. 13 to 15),
both B. balearicus and B. siculus haplotypes were present, with a marked north-south cline (Table 2): The
frequency of balearicus haplotypes declined from
93.75% in Calatabiano (pop. 13) to 68% in Giarre (pop.
14) and 50% in Gravina (pop. 15), down to 0% in Misterbianco (pop. 16).
Autosomal microsatellites and population-genetics
analyses

There was no evidence for allelic dropout from any
locus in any population. Null alleles at low frequencies
were detected (and corrections performed) in one population each for loci C203 (pop. 14) and D105 (pop. 13),
and in two populations each for loci C218 (pop. 6, 22),
C223 (pop. 18, 21) and D5 (pop. 17, 18). Tests for linkage disequilibrium between loci (after sequential Bonferroni corrections) revealed four significant combinations
(Bcal μ10 × C203 for pop. 9, D5 × Bcal μ10 for pop. 15,

C223 × Bcal μ10 for pop. 18, D105 × C205 for pop. 23).
A few B. siculus populations showed some heterozygote
deficit (Additional file 1), presumably due to sampling
design (substructures may arise when pooling tadpoles
or adults from several nearby ponds).
Bayesian clustering assignment using STRUCTURE
[25] largely confirmed the nuclear information from
Tropomyosine. All populations from Sicily were clearly
grouped into two clusters [K = 2; [26]] corresponding to
B. balearicus and B. siculus gene pools respectively (Figure 3). All individuals from populations 9 to 14 were
assigned to B. balearicus, while all individuals from
populations 15 to 24 were assigned to B. siculus. Ten
F1-hybrids from an experimental cross between a female
balearicus (pop. 11) and a male siculus (pop. 22) were
correctly assigned a 50% probability of belonging to
either balearicus or siculus (pop. 25). Surprisingly, the
two populations north and south of the contact zone
(pop. 14 and 15) did not show any sign of hybridization
or gene flow, despite harboring mtDNA from both

clades. All individuals from population 14 were assigned
with a 100% probability to balearicus, and all individuals
from the population 15 with 100% probability to siculus.
As a matter of fact, potential hybrids appear very few
(altogether four individuals with assignment probabilities
lower than 90% to either parental species), and largely
backcrossed (assignment probabilities to the alternative
parental species lower than 25%).
This pattern was confirmed by NEWHYBRIDS [27],
which, when including all Sicilian populations, correctly
assigned all experimental crosses as F 1 -hybrids, and
identified four wild-caught individuals as possible F 2hybrids (two each from pop. 13 and 18, details in Additional file 2). When focusing on populations where
hybrids occurred or were likely to do so (pop. 12 to 16
and 18), while pre-assigning pop. 9 to 11 and 17 as pure
B. balearicus and B. siculus, respectively, no nuclear
hybrids were detected. Finally, diagnostic alleles also
suggested faint signs of past hybridizations (Additional
file 3). We found B. siculus alleles in three individuals

assigned as B. balearicus using STRUCTURE (one from
pop. 13 and two from pop. 14), and B. balearicus alleles
in six individuals assigned as B. siculus (four in pop. 15
and two in pop. 18). All of these analyses concur to suggest limited events of nuclear introgression.
In order to fine-tune our analysis of potential gene
flow, we performed separate STRUCTURE analyses for
B. balearicus and B. siculus populations. Substructure
within B. balearicus was best explained with K = 3 (Figure 1b). Cluster b1 contained individuals from mainland
Italy, cluster b2 individuals from north-eastern Sicilian
populations, and cluster b3 individuals from populations
close to the contact zone. Interestingly population 8 (tip
of Calabria) showed admixture of mainland Italy and
Sicilian genotypes. Substructure within B. siculus was
similarly best explained with K = 3 (Figure 1b). Cluster
s2 contained individuals from the vast majority of populations (including off coast islands, pop. 23 and 24),
except for populations 21 and 22 (north-western coast
of Sicily, cluster s1) and population 15 at the contact
zone (cluster s3).
Hence, in both species, the populations close to the
hybrid zone (showing coexistence of mtDNA

haplotypes) form a cluster of their own. However, this
pattern is clearly not generated by nuclear gene flow
between the two species. Indeed, from pair-wise F ST
values, the strongest differentiation (FST = 0.52, Additional file 4) actually occurs between the two populations (pop. 14 and 15) from each side of the contact
zone, as compared to an average value of 0.32 between
allospecific populations (and 0.18 between conspecific
populations). This unexpected result was confirmed by a
principal component analysis [PCAGEN; [28]] aimed at
extracting factors maximizing genetic differentiation
among populations (Figure 4). Two factors turn out to
be significant, explaining respectively 40.4 and 13.1% of
the total differentiation (FST). The first one accounts for
the contrast between B. siculus (left) and B. balearicus
(right). The three B. balearicus clusters identified with
STRUCTURE differentiate along this axis, with lowest
values for b1 (mainland Italy, pop. 1 to 7), and highest
values for b3 (pop. 12 to 14, close to the contact zone).
The three B. siculus clusters differentiate mostly on the
second factor, with lowest values for s1 (north-western
coast, pop. 21 and 22) and highest values for s3 (pop.
15, close to the contact zone).

The spread of clusters correlates with geography,
which translates into some isolation by distance. The
relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distance is strong and significant in both species
when dropping the three populations (pop. 13 to 15) at
the contact zone (r = 0.81, R 2 = 66%, p = 0.0026 for
B. balearicus, and r = 0.41, R 2 = 17%, p = 0.035 for
B. siculus), but drastically reduced when including these
three populations, due to strong differentiation over
short geographic distances (r = 0.23, R 2 = 8.72%, p =
0.25 for B. balearicus, and r = 0.21, R 2 = 4.65%, p =
0.47 for B. siculus).
This enhanced differentiation between populations
close to the contact zone correlates with increased
genetic drift and loss of diversity. Genetic diversity in B.
balearicus populations decreases from Hs = 0.74 in
mainland Italy (pop. 5 and 6) to 0.54 in Calabria and

1.00

B. balearicus

Northern Sicily, down to 0.38 at the contact zone (pop.
14). Similarly (though to a lesser extent), genetic diversity in B. siculus populations decreases from Hs = 0.75
South and West of the Mount Etna (pop. 17 and 18) to
0.62 in populations closer to the contact zone (pop. 15
and 16; Additional file 1, see also [24] for representative
populations).
Crossing experiments

From an F1-cross B. balearicus x B. siculus obtained in
spring 2007, about 80% offspring were viable and developed normally (Table 3). The remaining 20% did not
hatch or produced malformed, dwarfed and/or leucistic
larvae (Figure 5c-f). Most of these died at early stages or
during metamorphosis (four-legged stage), and a few
ones survived as never-metamorphosing “giant” tadpoles
(Figure 5f). The reciprocal cross (B. siculus x

B. balearicus) showed much lower survival after metamorphosis (Table 3).
We raised about 160 F1-metamorphs from the 2007
cross to a snout-vent-length of ca. 2 cm, and kept 50
of them until secondary sexual characters became visible (paler coloration and nuptial pads of males).
Though sex ratio was approximately even, we noticed
about 30% of dwarfed F 1 -males that reached only
about two-thirds the size of normal individuals. Ten
males and ten females were further raised until maturity (Figures 5g-h). In spring 2009, we used one F 1 of
each sex to produce F2-hybrids (F1 × F1) and reciprocal backcrosses with either B. siculus or B. balearicus
(one new, wild-caught male and one female each, Figure 6). F 2 -hybrids turned out to be unviable, with all
tadpoles dying a few days after hatching. While 200
out of 328 tadpoles from the backcrosses were still
alive two months after spawning, they presented, a
number of developmental abnormalities, including
greenish individuals and a bimodal size distribution
within the same cross (Figure 7), and suffered from
dramatic mortality at later stages, with two individuals
only surviving after metamorphosis.

Discussion
Our study shows that two distinct lineages of green
toads (Bufo viridis subgroup) occur parapatrically in
Sicily. These lineages have diverged some 2.7 My ago
[23], a time frame long enough to allow significant differentiation on both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences (Figure 2). As our study further shows, this

divergence was also sufficient to bring the speciation
process close to completion.
On the one hand, the endemic B. siculus, of NorthAfrican origin [home of its sister clade B. boulengeri;
[23]], occupies the western and southern parts of Sicily,
plus two small islands off the north-western coasts
(Ustica and Favignana) [23]. On the other hand,
B. balearicus occupies the north-eastern part of Sicily.
Based on their geographical localization and patterns of
genetic similarity with mainland Italy, we infer that
these Sicilian B. balearicus populations recently originated from close-by Calabrian populations. Faunal
exchange across the Strait of Messina [including amphibians [29]] are well documented for the Upper Pleistocene [30]. From our genetic analyses, these two species
nowadays meet at the eastern coast of Sicily, between
the Mount Etna and the Ionian Sea. We cannot exclude
that another contact exists along the North coast
(north-west of Mount Etna), but could not find any currently occupied site in this area despite thorough
examination.
Though very restricted, the documented contact zone
shows signs of past hybridization, with differential introgression patterns depending on markers. Mitochondrial
alleles show a clear North-South cline, where the frequency of balearicus haplotypes progressively decreases
from 94% (pop. 13, Calatabiano) to 0% (pop. 16, Misterbianco) over a distance of ca 40 km. Cytonuclear disequilibrium occurred in individuals from both species,
pointing to a two-way introgression. This presumably
involved symmetric events of hybridization, followed by

backcrossing of fertile F 1 -females with their paternal
species. Though no F 1 -hybrids were detected in the
field, the occurrence of rare and symmetric events of
hybridization was confirmed by a few backcrosses (F2 or
more) identified via STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS
in both B. siculus and B. balearicus populations, as well
as a two-way leak of diagnostic nuclear alleles.
However, nuclear introgression was surprisingly low
overall. The transition between tropomyosine alleles
from the two clades was abrupt, occurring at some
point between populations 14 (Giarre) and 15 (Gravina),
separated by just 16 km. The same holds for autosomal
microsatellites in general, since STRUCTURE assigned
(with 100% probability) all individuals from pop. 14 to
balearicus, and all individuals from pop. 15 to siculus
(Figure 3). The sharpness of this transition is underlined

by the patterns of genetic differentiation: The two populations each side of the contact zone (pop. 14 and 15),
though harboring a mix of mitochondrial haplotypes
from both lineages, display the highest differentiation
value observed in the study area (pairwise FST = 0.52).
Populations at the contact zone (clusters b3 and s3) are
actually the ones most differentiated on the first PCAGEN factors (Figure 4).
Genetic drift certainly plays a role in this strong local
differentiation. The B. balearicus populations at the contact zone represent the front wave of a recent expansion, as evidenced by the drastic decrease in genetic
diversity from mainland Italy (Hs = 0.74) to the southernmost populations (Hs = 0.38 in population 14). Drift
is certainly further amplified by the geographic localization of the contact zone: The geographical bottleneck

between Mount Etna and the Ionian Sea creates a
peninsular situation, largely isolating populations at the
contact zone from conspecifics. This induces a strong
differentiation over a small geographic scale, which
somewhat blurs the overall clear pattern of isolation by
distance observed in both species.

Drift might also partly account for the marked contrast between mitochondrial and nuclear introgression.
Mitochondrial markers have low effective sizes (about
one quarter of nuclear markers), and are therefore more
prone to introgression. In small hybridizing populations,
mtDNA might sometimes get fixed into foreign taxa via

drift or founder effects, even with little or no gene flow
at nuclear loci [31]. This contrast should be further
amplified if females display lower effective size than
males, which occurs when dispersal is male biased [as
expected in polygynous mating system such as found in

bufonids; [32-36]]. Effective population sizes at the front
wave of expansions (or in any poorly connected population) largely depend on gene flow from incoming immigrants, and thus on the mode of inheritance of markers
when dispersal is sex biased [37,38].

Colliard et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/232

In addition to drift and dispersal, selection often contributes crucially to the maintenance of narrow hybrid
zones [39]. We think that the one under study is no
exception, and that selection against nuclear introgression is very likely to also play a role. First, F1-hybrids
from our experimental crosses showed reduced fitness
(Table 3). Outcomes from reciprocal crosses were asymmetric, which often occurs in interspecific crosses (as
documented e.g. in hybrids between green toads and
Bufo calamita [40] or B. bufo [41,42]. If the small size
and altered coloration observed in males from the B.
balearicus × B. siculus cross translate into lower survival
or fertility in the field, then nuclear markers are indeed
expected to show less introgression than mtDNA. Second, survival was drastically affected both in backcrosses
and in F 2 -hybrids (F 1 × F 1 ), which should strongly
reduce introgression. Third, the currently known ranges
of both taxa in Sicily roughly coincide with the borders
of semiarid (B. balearicus) and arid (B. siculus) climates
[43]. Adaptation of these two genomes to different climates may select against hybrids, and potentially stabilize the contact zone.
The sex-specific phenotypic effects in the F1 as well as
the dramatic hybrid breakdown observed both in backcrosses and in the F2 generation (F1 × F1) were expected
from the classical Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation [44], arising from the confrontation of incompatible
genes and the disruption of co-adapted sets of genes.
Except for sex chromosomes in the heterogametic sex,
F1-hybrids inherit complete sets of genes from both parental species and should thus suffer little from co-adaptation losses. We do not know, however, whether sexspecific differences in F 1 phenotypes (dwarfed males)
conform to Haldane’s rule [45], because sex-determination mechanisms are unknown for Sicilian green toads
(as for most amphibians). Results from related species
suggest a XX/XY-system for B. variabilis (as “B. viridis“)
from Asia Minor [46,47], but a ZZ/ZW-system for taxonomically undefined green toads from Moldavia [B. viridis/B. variabilis contact zone?, [48]]. Contrasting with
F 1 , backcrosses and F 2 (F 1 × F 1 ) inherit imbalanced
numbers of genes from both parental species due to
recombination in F1, and may thus lack crucial alleles at
complementary loci. Inbreeding presumably also played
a role in our F2 crosses, which may partially explain the
additional mortality relative to the breakdown observed
in backcrosses (Table 3). However, inbreeding is also
expected to affect F1 × F1 crosses in the field, given the
scarcity of hybridization events. It is also worth noting
that a few backcrossed tadpoles survived metamorphosis. Among such rare individuals, females are most likely
responsible for the mitochondrial introgression and
signs of nuclear allele leakage observed in the field.

Page 12 of 16

Important caveats obviously apply to our crossing
experiments, mainly due to the practical difficulties in
obtaining reproducing individuals from the field.
Absence of replicates limits the power of our inferences,
and we lack the exact controls for intraspecific matings
(although the latter is compensated by our long experience of breeding green toads in the lab, which allowed
us to provide intraspecific controls from other Western
Palearctic lineages; Table 3). Results from these preliminary crosses must be clearly considered as provisional, but are worth reporting here as a support for our
main conclusions gathered from field population-genetics data.
Though many hybrid zones have been documented in
amphibians (see Background), few provide the data
required to calibrate the speciation process, in terms of
reliable time of divergence and patterns of introgression
in the field. A notable exception is provided by fire- and
yellow-bellied toads, which constitute one of the beststudied anuran hybrid zones. Bombina bombina and B.
variegata, thought to have diverged during Upper Miocene or Lower Pliocene [3.5 Mya; [49-51]] hybridize in
narrow, stable zones maintained by selection and dispersal [51]. Strong selection against hybrids is generated
both by hybrid breakdown [21,52], and by environmentdependent selection against toads in mismatched habitats [53].
However, mitochondrial introgression in Bombina
seems more limited than in Sicilian green toads, with
mtDNA clines similar to or even steeper than those of
nuclear loci [allozymes; [54]]. The divergence between
B. siculus and B. balearicus is slightly more recent (PlioPleistocene, ca 2.7 Mya), but, despite higher mitochondrial DNA introgression, we found almost no admixture
at supposedly neutrally evolving nuclear microsatellite
loci, suggesting stronger selection to keep gene pools
apart.

Conclusions
While anuran species that diverged > 8 Mya may exhibit
partial or complete hybrid inviability in the laboratory,
as recently shown for instance by a combination of
experimental crosses and molecular divergence time
estimates for the Fejevarya limnocharis group [55], there
is accumulating evidence that anurans with Plio-(Pleisto)
cene divergence tend to be reproductively isolated under
natural conditions. Secondary contacts between Australian hylids of Plio-Pleistocene divergence have provided
evidence for allopatric speciation driven by reinforcement mechanisms, characterized by highly asymmetric
F1-viability in experimental crosses [8]. Neither F1 and
F2-hybrids nor backcrosses could be identified at a contact zone between two Hyla species with an estimated

Colliard et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/232

Pliocene divergence (3.6 Mya) [20], indicating a lack of
current gene exchange. By contrast, phylogeographic
studies [e.g. [16,17]] have shown that clades of more
recent divergence [1.33 Mya; [17]] form “wide hybrid
zone(s) with a considerable genetic exchange between
the two gene pools” [16], suggesting that reproductive
barriers are still low or inexistent.
The observed post-mating barriers (hybrid breakdown)
in Sicilian green toads certainly induce selection to act
against hybridization. Therefore, we expect some premating mechanisms to have evolved since the first contact of these allopatrically evolved lineages, which might
also explain the absence of F1-hybrids. These two species have already been shown to differ in breeding phenology [23]. Pre-mating isolation between closely related
species (through mating calls and female choice) is
widespread in anurans, sometimes even in absence of
post-mating isolation [56]. The nature of barriers might
also affect the structure of hybrid zones, since, due to
female choice, mtDNA is expected to introgress more
readily than nuclear DNA under pre-zygotic isolation
mechanisms (and even more so when the invading species is relatively rare compared to residents) [57].
Further insights on the evolutionary interactions
between B. siculus and B. balearicus populations might
be gained by collecting bio-acoustic and mate-choice
data, together with additional crossing experiments.
Whatever the exact causes, our data clearly show a
virtual absence of gene flow at the present contact zone
(corroborated with a hybrid breakdown in backcrosses
and F 2 ), meaning that the speciation process can be
considered as close to have reached complete reproductive isolation after some 2.7 My of divergence. These
field data contrast sharply with the results from experimental hybridization in anurans, which show that some
lineages may still produce viable F1 offspring after ca. 20
My of divergence (see Background). Information on F1hybridizability or viability gained under laboratory conditions may thus grossly overestimate the time required
for genetic isolation and speciation to occur in anurans.

Methods
Sampling

Samples from 323 specimens of green toads were collected during intense fieldwork between 2004 and 2007
at 24 localities across the Italian Peninsula and Sicily
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Italian Peninsula was added to
the sampling to allow us to understand the context of
the B. balearicus invasion in Sicily and to compare Sicilian B. balearicus genotypes with those of mainland origin. A few samples came from scientific collections
(MVZ, NME, ZFMK) or were collected throughout the
years (e.g. road-kills). Tissue samples consisted of finger
tips and muscles (road kill) from sub adult and adult

Page 13 of 16

toads, and tail tips from tadpoles. Most adults were
released at the sampling sites, some vouchers were
deposited in institutional collections [MVZ, NME,
ZFMK, details Appendix 1 in 23], and tissues were
stored in 98% ethanol and/or at -20°C.
Crossing experiments

Toad crosses were performed with mature adult males
and females in a naturally reproductive state during the
breeding period in spring. Females were stimulated to
spawn by injection of 0.1 ml of a 0.9% NaCl-solution
containing 500-1000 IU of human choriogonadotropin
(Sigma).
A first crossing experiment was made in the laboratory
in 2007 between a female B. balearicus (Si 41, pop. 11)
and a male B. siculus (Si 11, pop. 22), from which 200 F1hybrid tadpoles were raised. Ten randomly chosen offspring were genotyped and added to our sampling
("population 25”). Seven others crossing experiments
were made in the laboratory in 2009 using two B. balearicus individuals (male: Si 336; female: Si337; Sicily, Marina S. Biagio, pop. 9), two B. siculus individuals (male: Si
334; female: Si 335; Sicily, Pergusa Lake, province of
Enna, 37°31’00.29” N, 14°18’04.34"E, W of pop. 18 and
19) and two F1-hybrid individuals coming from the first
crossing experiment (male: Cross 13; female: Cross 11).
As no proper control for intraspecific crosses could be
performed (due to lack of available females), we provide
results from intraspecific matings of other green toad
lineages (Table 3: Control 1: B. turanensis, Control2: B.
pewzowi), which were raised under identical conditions.
Crossing pairs from 2009 were observed during
amplexus every hour. When 10-15 cm of clutch strings
had been deposited, couples were removed from the
tank and separated, animals were rinsed to avoid sperm
contamination and arranged in new cross combinations
in another tank (see Table 3 for cross combinations).
Clutch was left untouched until hatching or until visible signs of dying eggs/embryos were found that had to
be removed to avoid a chain-reaction of embryo suffocation. After one month, 100 tadpoles were randomly chosen among the surviving (if so) offspring, raised in
shallow oxygenated aquaria and fed with Elodea plants
and fish food (Tetramin) under identical conditions.
After the second month of development, percentage of
surviving tadpoles was determined by individual counts.
All of these tadpoles were further raised until metamorphosis or death. Toadlets were fed with Drosophila and
juvenile crickets, and mealworms with weekly additions
of calcium and vitamins. Illumination of terrariums
included sun-light spectrum fluorescent lamps including
a natural-like UV fraction. Clutch, embryonic, tadpole
and juvenile development were documented photographically (Figures 5 to 7).

DNA extraction and microsatellite data generation

DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy™kit.
Microsatellite primer (Bcal μ10) described by Rowe
et al. [58] and six pairs of microsatellites (BaturaC203,
C205, C218, C223, D105, D5) developed by Colliard et
al. [24] were selected for analysis, due to their level of
polymorphism and applicability in both species. PCRamplification, electrophoresis and allele scoring were
performed as described in [24]. Multiplexing of PCR
products was performed. For D105 and D5 we used a
mixture in a 1:3 ratio; Bcal μ10 was 5% diluted and
mixed with C223 and C203 products in a 1:2:2 ratio.
The third multiplexing involved products of C218 and
C205 in a ratio of 1:2.
Mitotyping, sequencing and analyses of mitochondrial
DNA and nuclear DNA

We used a mitotyping approach described in Colliard
et al. [24] to detect the mtDNA haplotype group for all
individuals. We also sequenced 577 bp of the mitochondrial control region (D-loop) [as described in [18]] in
162 individuals from across the study area (Figure 2).
An intron of alpha-Tropomyosine, situated between
exons 5 and 6 was amplified, cloned and sequenced as
described by Stöck et al. [23]. We used homologous
sequences from 21 individuals from throughout the sampling area plus one individual from a museum collection
coming from a locality near pop. 12. Four of these 22
green toads came from the contact zone with assignment
values varying from 68% to 92% to either parental species.
All mitochondrial and nuclear sequences were submitted to GenBank (Acc.-Numbers HM852594HM852744, in part from [23]). Maximum likelihood
(ML) phylogenies of mitochondrial and nuclear
sequence alignment were generated using PhyML version 2.4.5 [59] and using HKY models according to
MrModeltest [60]. In each case, we choose a BioNJ as a
starting tree, and optimized topology, branch length and
rate parameters. Other parameters were used as defaults
of the program. We generated bootstrap values based
on 1000 resampled data sets.
Genotype data analyses

To exclude genotyping errors due to null alleles, stuttering and allelic drop-out, Micro-Checker v.2.2.3 [61] was
used. Genotypic linkage disequilibrium between each
pair of loci per population was tested using ARLEQUIN
v. 3.0 [62]. Significance was adjusted for multiple tests
using Bonferroni corrections. Estimation of heterozygote
deficits and its significance was assessed using FSTAT v.
2.9.4 [63]. For each microsatellite marker and species,
we estimated genetic diversity by calculating number of
alleles (Na), and within-sample expected heterozygosity
(Hs) (Additional file 1).

Page 14 of 16

Isolation by distance was investigated with Mantel
tests (FSTAT) by regressing pairwise FST/(1-FST) against
the natural logarithm-transformed Euclidean geographic
distances [64], for B. balearicus and B. siculus independently, selecting localities with ten or more samples.
Two sets of analyses were performed, including or not
the three populations at the contact zone which showed
mitochondrial introgression. A principal component
analysis was conducted with PCAGEN [28] to visualize
pairwise differentiation among populations (FST), with
1000 randomizations of genotypes to test for significance of axes.
In order to better determine potential signs of introgression between the two species, we used the Bayesian
clustering algorithm of STRUCTURE v. 2.2 [25]. We
used the admixture model and allowed for correlated
allele frequencies between populations, as recommended
by the authors for cases of subtle population structure.
We tested a range of cluster numbers (K) from 1 to the
number of localities per analysis, plus an additional
three to enable us to potentially infer subtle structure.
Each run, replicated 10 times, consisted of 10 5 iterations, after a “burn-in” of 104. To infer which K best fits
our data, we applied the ad hoc ΔK statistic developed
by Evanno et al. [26]. We performed three analyses: (1)
all Sicilian localities plus the lab-cross individuals; (2) all
B. siculus localities, and (3) all B. balearicus localities.
Identification of hybrids

Four alternative approaches were used to identify
hybrids. First, we used the cluster assignment value
(STRUCTURE, parameters as above, K = 2), considering
as hybrids all individuals with assignment values below
90%. Second, we performed two analyses using NEWHYBRIDS v.1.1 Beta3 [27] to assign Sicilian toads to
genotypic classes (parental, F 1 , F 2 , backcrosses). The
method computes Bayesian posterior probability that an
individual belongs to each of these different hybrid
classes while simultaneously estimating allelic frequencies for parental species. Runs were repeated several
times with varying lengths of the “burn-in” and number
of sweeps, as recommended in the program manual.
The first analysis was based on all Sicilian individuals.
The second focused on populations where hybrids were
shown to occur or were likely to do so (pop. 12 to 16
and 18), with addition of few pre-assigned non-hybrid
individuals from “pure” populations (pop. 9 to 11 and
17), using the z option as recommended by the authors
[27]. Third, we identified individuals as hybrids if they
were assigned by STRUCTURE to one clade but contained mtDNA from the other (= cyto-nuclear disequilibrium). Finally, we compared the microsatellite allele
composition of Sicilian B. siculus and B. balearicus
populations far apart from the contact zone (i.e.,

Colliard et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/232

presumably pure) with those closer to the contact zone
(potentially admixed). Alleles found in presumably pure
populations that were exclusively present in one species
were considered as “diagnostic”. Finding diagnostic
alleles of one clade in individuals assigned to the other
clade by STRUCTURE was considered a sign of past
hybridization (Additional file 3).
