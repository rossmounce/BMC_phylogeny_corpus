Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive description of gene expression in developing C.
elegans embryonic muscle cells. The finding that more than half of these muscle enriched transcripts
encode proteins with human homologs suggests that mutant analysis of these genes in C. elegans
could reveal evolutionarily conserved models of muscle gene function, with ready application to
human muscle pathologies.

Results: We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate myo-3::green fluorescent protein
(GFP) positive muscle cells, and their cultured derivatives, from dissociated early C. elegans
embryos. Microarray analysis identified 7,070 expressed genes, 1,312 of which are enriched in the
myo-3::GFP positive cell population relative to the average embryonic cell. The muscle enriched
gene set was validated by comparisons with known muscle markers, independently derived
expression data, and GFP reporters in transgenic strains. These results confirm the utility of
MAPCeL for cell type specific expression profiling and reveal that 60% of these transcripts have
human homologs.

Background: The force generating mechanism of muscle is evolutionarily ancient; the fundamental
structural and functional components of the sarcomere are common to motile animals throughout
phylogeny. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factors that regulate muscle
development are also conserved. Thus, a comprehensive description of muscle gene expression in
a simple model organism should define a basic muscle transcriptome that is also found in animals
with more complex body plans. To this end, we applied microarray profiling of Caenorhabtidis
elegans cells (MAPCeL) to muscle cell populations extracted from developing C. elegans embryos.

Fox et al.

Background

The basic architecture of the muscle contractile unit, the sarcomere, and regulatory processes that control muscle activity
are remarkably similar in motile animals. For example, sarcomeres are universally assembled from interdigitating
myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments; this complex
is activated by intracellular calcium to drive muscle contraction [1-3]. In addition to these important functional and
structural elements, transcription factors that direct muscle
differentiation are also conserved. In mammals, a group of
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors or myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) define a transcriptional cascade that
directs skeletal muscle differentiation [4]. A similar pathway
functions in the nematode, Caenorhabtidis elegans, in which
a single MRF-related factor, HLH-1 (helix-loop-helix), is
highly expressed in all embryonic body wall muscle cells
[5,6]. A determinative role of HLH-1 in embryonic muscle differentiation is suggested by the finding that ectopic HLH-1 is
sufficient to convert other embryonic cell types to a body wall
muscle fate. Interestingly, body wall muscle differentiation in
C. elegans also depends on two other transcription factors,
namely UNC-120 (serum response factor) and HND-1
(HAND family of basic helix-loop-helix factors), conserved
homologs of which are selectively required for vertebrate
smooth muscle and cardiac muscle differentiation, respectively. This finding suggests that vertebrate muscles may have
arisen from a common primordial invertebrate muscle cell
[7]. It follows that pathways that define C. elegans body wall
muscle differentiation and function may be encoded by genes
that contribute to all three major classes of vertebrate
muscles.
In C. elegans, 81 body wall muscle cells are generated before
hatching to comprise the predominant embryonic muscle cell
type. Minor embryonic muscles include two anal muscles and
two myoepithelial cells that envelope the posterior intestine
[1,3]. All of these muscles express the myosin heavy chain
gene myo-3 (myosin heavy chain 3) [8]. A distinct group of 20
muscle cells in the feeding organ or pharynx are also generated in the embryo but they do not express myo-3.
Extensive genetic screens have identified large numbers of
mutations that disrupt the structure and organization of body
wall muscle cells [9-12]. Although this approach has revealed
key molecules (for instance, myo-3) with important roles in
muscle function and development, the complexity of these
processes suggests that many additional C. elegans genes are
also likely to contribute to the myogenic program [13]. Here
we describe the application of a recently developed technique,
microarray profiling of C. elegans cells (MAPCeL), to generate a comprehensive catalog of C. elegans genes expressed in
embryonic body wall muscle cells. In this method, cells
marked with a specific green fluorescent protein (GFP)
reporter gene are isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for microarray profiling experiments [14]. The
sorted cells can be obtained either from freshly dissociated

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R188

embryos, in which early developmental genes are expressed,
or from mature cells after differentiation in culture (Figure 1).
Thus, this approach can potentially identify distinct sets of
genes that may respond to extrinsic signals that influence cell
fate and differentiation in the early embryo as well as transcripts that are expressed later in development as the sarcomere apparatus begins to function. We have used the myo3::GFP reporter gene to mark nonpharyngeal embryonic
muscle cells in C. elegans [15]. This robust reporter initiates
expression during early embryonic myogenesis and also perdures in mature embryonic muscle cells. We have exploited
the continuous embryonic expression of myo-3::GFP to profile C. elegans body wall muscle cells at these two developmental stages. In addition to revealing genes that are
differentially expressed in these distinct myogenic populations, this approach has also identified transcripts, such as
myo-3, that are enriched in muscle cells throughout embryonic development. A common group of about 600 genes in
these datasets are also upregulated in an independent microarray profile of HLH-1 induced transcripts in the C. elegans
embryonic cells [7]. This overlapping set of MRF-regulated
mRNAs defines a core group of candidate genes with potentially key roles in muscle development and function. In the
future, analysis of these gene sets with the facile genetic tools
available in this model organism should lead to a detailed
understanding of the logic of the muscle transcriptome and
its role in myofilament assembly and function.

Results
Strategy to profile C. elegans embryonic body wall
muscle cells
We used MAPCeL [14] to assess mRNA expression in embryonic muscle cells. This technique involves the dissociation of
blastomeres from embryos expressing a cell-type restricted
GFP reporter gene, thus allowing FACS-enrichment of specific cell types (Figure 1). To mark embryonic muscle cells, we
used an integrated myo-3::GFP transgene [15]. myo-3::GFP
expression begins early, in the 'pre-comma' stage embryo that
is readily dissociated into individual blastomeres. This
reporter is expressed in all 81 embryonic body wall muscle
cells (Figure 2), the anal depressor, and sphincter muscles.
We used MAPCeL to profile muscle cells from two cell populations (Figure 2) [16]: myo-3::GFP labeled blastomeres
sorted directly from freshly dissociated embryos; and myo3::GFP expressing muscle cells from dissociated embryos cultured for 24 hours before sorting.
The microarray profile of freshly dissociated muscle cells is
labeled 'M0' to denote direct isolation from embryos at '0'
hours (normalized intensity values are listed in Additional
data file 1). The M0 profile is expected to include transcripts
that are highly expressed in nascent muscle cells. The embryonic myo-3::GFP positive body wall muscle cells comprise
about 15% of the total cell population (81/550 total cells),
which is consistent with the frequency at which myo-3::GFP

The coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated for each
set of microarray replicates. An average R2 of 0.94 (n = 3) was
obtained for the reference dataset (R0) obtained from freshly
dissociated embryonic cells. The reproducibility of these data
is illustrated graphically in the representative scatter plot
shown in Figure 3. A similar high value of R2 (0.96; n = 4) was
previously determined for the reference data (R24) obtained

We initially identified all transcripts that are reliably detected
in the muscle datasets. These lists of 'present' genes for the
experimental M0 and M24 datasets were adjusted to remove
transcripts that could easily be attributed to contamination
by non-GFP cells (about 10%) in FACS-derived myo-3::GFP
cell populations (see Materials and methods, below) [14]. The
resultant list of 'expressed genes' includes 7,070 unique
mRNAs from the M0 and M24 populations of C. elegans body
wall muscle cells (Figure 4a and Additional data file 2). A total
of 10,455 unique expressed genes are included in the sum (R0
+ R24) of the reference datasets; overall, 10,939 transcripts
were detected in these experiments. A substantial number of
expressed genes (6,586) are expressed in both muscle cells
and in the reference dataset (Figure 4b and Additional data
file 3). These transcripts are likely to include 'housekeeping'
genes that play universal roles in cell differentiation and
homeostasis; for example, transcripts for 75 ribosomal proteins are included in this group (Additional data file 3).
Expressed genes that are selectively detected in the M0 and

myo-3::GFP expression persists in fully differentiated muscle
cells after the comma stage, when embryos become resistant
to dissociation. We have previously shown that C. elegans
neurons and muscle cells can differentiate in vitro from early
embryonic blastomeres [16,17]. Therefore, to obtain a profile
of mature embryonic muscle cells, dissociated myo-3::GFP
embryos were cultured for 24 hours before sorting; the microarray dataset from these myo-3::GFP cells is labeled 'M24'
(Additional data file 1). mRNAs in the M24 profile are
expected to represent transcripts expressed in differentiated
body wall muscle cells. Although myo-3::GFP is also
expressed in post-embryonically derived muscle cells (for
instance, vulval), larval cells apparently do not differentiate
under these culture conditions and therefore should not be
directly profiled in these experiments [17].

Microarray profiles detect muscle-enriched transcripts
A scatter plot comparing the M0 muscle dataset with the R0
reference reveals significant differences in gene expression
levels (Figure 3b). Enrichment for known muscle genes is evident, because transcripts for the abundant muscle structural
proteins MYO-3 (myosin heavy chain), UNC-54 (myosin
heavy chain), and UNC-15 (paramyosin) [18-20] are highly
elevated (red) relative to reference data obtained from all
embryonic cells. Other transcripts, including those encoding

Consistent with the low false discovery rate calculated for
these datasets, we detected limited overlap with microarray
profiles generated from other cell types. For example, only
100 out of 1,685 intestine or germline-enriched transcripts
[23] are also listed in our enriched muscle dataset (Additional
data file 8). These intestine and germline genes are thus
under-represented in the embryonic muscle profile (representation factor = 0.8, P < 0.036). (Hypergeometric calculations were performed as described by Von Stetina and
coworkers [24].) In contrast, a similar comparison of the
embryonic muscle enriched genes detected significant overlap with transcripts that are also elevated in a MAPCeL dataset obtained from embryonic A-class motor neurons [14]. In
this case 159 of the approximately 1,000 embryonic A class
motor neuron enriched transcripts are detected in the muscle
profile (representation factor = 2.3, P < 1.5 × e-24; Additional
data file 9). The significantly higher fraction of shared transcripts between neurons and muscles could be indicative of
the common functions of excitable cells. For example, transcripts for the acetylcholine receptors (unc-38 and unc-63),
ryanodine calcium receptor (unc-68), and innexin gap junction protein (unc-9) are detected in both the muscle and Aclass motor neuron datasets. This view is consistent with the
finding that the embryonic muscle dataset also shows

[25], although the 249 transcripts shared by both datasets are
indicative of significant similarity (representation factor =
2.8, P < 1.8 × e-54; Additional data file 6). It is unclear whether
this disparity is due to the different profiling strategies used
to generate these data or to developmentally regulated differences in gene expression between embryonic and larval
muscles.
The finding that a majority of known muscle genes is detected
in our microarray profiles, and that these datasets exhibit
substantial overlap with an independent profile of embryonic
myogenesis [7] suggested that other uncharacterized transcripts in these datasets are also likely to be expressed in body
wall muscle cells. To test this idea, we generated promoterGFP reporter genes for representative transcripts in the M0

and M24 datasets and scored expression in embryonic and
post-embryonic muscle cell types. A 'promoter' was defined
as the region upstream of the ATG start codon for a distance
of 4 kilobases or the distance to the end/beginning of the 5'
flanking gene, whichever was less. In some cases, the promoter region tested was quite small (as little as 450 base
pairs) and therefore may not have included necessary regulatory elements for expression of the transgene (Additional
data file 11).
We found that about 70% (36/52) of transgenic lines generated from these reporter genes exhibited GFP-positive muscle
cells in vivo (Additional data file 11). This finding is comparable to the finding that 61% (238/393) of genes in the total
muscle enriched dataset for which expression patterns are
listed in WormBase are annotated as expressed in muscle. In
contrast, only 28% (1,003/3,544) of all genes with expression
patterns in WormBase are identified as muscle expressed
(Additional data files 6 and 7). The majority of muscle positive promoters (20/36) drove expression in both embryonic
and post-embryonic muscle, although 16 had no detectable
embryonic expression. We saw no correlation between the
rank order of transcripts identified by MAPCeL and the likelihood of muscle expression of the corresponding GFP reporters, suggesting that these microarray datasets are robust
(Additional data file 11).
Figure 7a depicts expression of representative GFP reporters
in three myo-3::GFP positive muscle cell types (body wall,
vulval, and defecation) and pharyngeal muscle as scored in
late larvae and adults. Given that body wall cells are the predominant muscle cell type, it is not surprising that most (35/
36) of the muscle positive reporters showed expression in this
tissue. The one exception, zig-6::GFP, is detected in embryonic anal muscles, a finding that underscores the sensitivity
of our methods to transcripts that may be selectively

Twenty-two GFP reporters were also expressed in the vulval

differentiated in culture for 24 hours. A comparison of
transcripts enriched in both datasets reveals 401 common
genes (Figure 5). Interestingly, of 38 transcripts encoding
muscle structural proteins, 74% (28/38) are common to both
datasets (Additional data file 12). This finding indicates that
other genes in this list of 395 transcripts may also fulfill key
roles in both nascent and fully differentiated muscle cells, and
may therefore constitute a class of fundamental muscle function genes.
In addition to transcripts that are elevated in both datasets,
we also detected genes that are selectively enriched in either
the M0 or M24 profiles. Overall, 375 genes show elevated
expression in the M0 dataset only whereas a separate group
of 542 transcripts are exclusively enriched relative to all other
cells in the M24 dataset (Figure 5). Of genes that are differentially detected in these datasets, we note that pat-3 and pat-6,
which are required for initial muscle assembly [11,26,27], are
selectively enriched in the M0 profile. Conversely, unc-70 is
detected as an expressed gene in the M0 dataset but it is
exclusively elevated in the M24 profile, a result that is consistent with the finding that UNC-70 (β-spectrin) is expressed in
all embryonic cells early in development but is localized to
muscles and neurons at hatching [28]. It is also possible that
some of these differences could be induced by differences in
the cellular environments of the M0 (intact embryo) and M24
(in vitro culture) muscle cells. For example, 24 genes encoding proteosome subunits show elevated expression in the
M24 dataset whereas none of these transcripts are enriched
in the M0 profile. This finding could be indicative of the general lack of innervation of muscle cells in culture because the
removal of motor neuron activity in vivo results in increased
muscle protein degradation via a proteosome dependent
mechanism [29]. Despite this caveat, these MAPCeL data
appear to reveal differences in gene expression that correlate
with the developmental 'age' of the M0 and M24 muscle cell
populations, suggesting that this technique may be generally
useful for detecting temporal changes in gene expression during development.

Gene families enriched in muscle cells
Genetic studies in C. elegans have identified a large number
of genes that are required for muscle structure, development,
and function [2,3]. To assess the potential utility of our microarray data for expanding this catalog of muscle genes, we
organized transcripts in these profiles according to functional
categories. A sampling of these findings is presented below.
Genes exhibiting enriched transcript levels are highlighted in
bold when they are first identified in the text. All genes discussed in this section are listed in Table 1.

tate with actin-containing thin filaments (I-band). The nematode sarcomere resembles vertebrate striated muscle,
although it is obliquely striated with myosin and actin-containing filaments oriented at an angle of 6° with respect to
sarcomere end plates [1,2,30]. The sarcomere maintains
functional alignment through attachment of thin filaments to
dense bodies, which link thin filaments to the basement
membrane of the cell. Thick filaments are stabilized within
the sarcomere by the M-line, a specialized region in the Aband that links adjacent thick filaments. The dense bodies
and the M-line are the primary mediators of tension generated during muscle contraction [10]. Hemidesmosomes that
connect each muscle cell to the overlying cuticle transmit this
force to deform the exoskeleton and thereby propel locomotion [30,31] (Figure 9).
Thick filaments are largely comprised of two myosin heavy
chain (MHC) proteins, MHC A and MHC B, encoded by the
myo-3 and unc-54 genes, respectively [1,8,20]. Interestingly, myo-3 is enriched in both the M0 and M24 datasets
whereas unc-54 is selectively elevated in the M24 profile but
detected as an expressed gene in M0 muscle cells. The elevation of myo-3 transcript levels before unc-54 mRNA during
body wall muscle development is consistent with the
observation that MHC A protein is also more abundant than
UNC-54 in early embryonic muscle cells [32]. The apparent
sequential expression of myo-3 and unc-54 parallels their distinct roles in thick filament assembly; MHC A establishes a
bipolar nucleation complex to which UNC-54 is added as the
filament elongates [8,33,34]. Differential roles in muscle
development are also underscored by the findings that myo3 null mutants are nonviable as embryos whereas genetic
ablation of unc-54 disrupts muscle structure and impairs
movement but does not result in lethality [3,13,35]. Two additional transcripts, F45G2.2 and Y11D7A.14, with sequence
similarity to the myosin heavy chain genes, are elevated in the
M24 dataset. On the basis of strong similarity to the aminoterminal actin-binding and ATPase domain, F45G2.2 is a
member of the myosin II class of striated muscle MHCs that
includes myo-3 and unc-54. However, the carboxyl-terminal
sequence of F45G2.2 is unusually short, with only about 100
amino acids, as opposed to the extended α-helical domain of
about 1,000 amino acids in the MYO-3 and UNC-54 proteins.
Because this so-called 'rod' domain drives thick filament
assembly, it will be interesting to determine whether the foreshortened carboxyl-terminal region of F45G2.2 contributes
to this structure. Y11D7A.14 encodes an unconventional
myosin that is more distantly related to other structural
myosins expressed in muscle. Potential functions for these
additional myosin molecules in muscle can now be explored
by genetic or RNA interference methods.

Muscle structure and function
The overall organization of C. elegans body wall muscle cells
is similar to that of vertebrate skeletal muscle. The primary
functional component is the sarcomere, a structure composed
of myosin-containing thick filaments (A-band) that interdigi-

The myosin light chain proteins regulate the ATPase activity
of the MHCs. Three myosin light chain genes (mlc-1, mlc-2,
and mlc-3) are enriched in both datasets. Genetic data indicate that mlc-3 is an essential muscle component, whereas

Muscle contraction is triggered by the release of intracellular
calcium stores in response to neurotransmitters secreted
from adjacent motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction.
Cytoplasmic calcium initiates myofibril contraction and is
rapidly pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via an
ATP-dependent calcium channel [46]. As expected, calcium
channel and calcium ion binding proteins are detected as
enriched transcripts in our datasets (Table 1). For example,
the ryanodine receptor, UNC-68, mediates the release stored
calcium [47,48] and sca-1 encodes the nematode sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), which
returns cytoplasmic calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum
[46]. We also find three genes that are predicted to function
as calcium sensors (C54E10.2, F21A10.1, and ncs-3), as
well as other components of calcium signaling including
calsequestrin and calmodulin (Table 1).

refereed research

In humans, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies arise
from mutations in a single gene encoding the large membrane-associated protein, dystrophin; these diseases are
characterized by severe muscle weakening and degeneration
[49]. Dystrophin is localized beneath the sarcolemma and is
attached to actin filaments as well as to the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) [50]. This protein complex stabilizes
the sarcolemma and prevents damage to muscle fibers
induced by long-term contraction. Mutations in the C. elegans homolog of dystrophin (dys-1) lead to hyperactivity,
but muscle degeneration has not been observed [51,52]. However, in C. elegans, as in mouse, mild MyoD (hlh-1)
mutations in conjunction with dystrophin deficiencies act
synergistically to induce muscle disassembly [50,53]; this
finding suggests that C. elegans may be a useful model for
studying these degenerative diseases. Most of the major DGC
components [52], (dys-1 [dystrophin], dyc-1 [CAPON], stn1 [syntrophin], and sgn-1 [sarcoglycan]) are enriched in our
C. elegans body wall muscle profiles; the one exception is
dyb-1 (dystrobrevin), which is not detected. Other enriched
transcripts with potentially related functions include the sarcoglycan-like genes sgcb-1 and H22K11.4. A GFP reporter
for H22K11.4 confirms expression in body wall, anal, and vulval muscles (Figure 7b). Additionally, the M0 profile detects

Troponin and tropomyosin form a complex that regulates
actin-myosin interactions in response to calcium [1,3]. In C.
elegans, tropomyosin is encoded by lev-11, which is enriched
in both datasets. Troponin is comprised of three subunits,
TnI, TnT, and TnC. There are four TnI genes in the nematode,
of which three (tni-1, unc-27, and tni-3) are expressed in
body wall muscle [43] and each is enriched in our datasets.
Similarly, all three body wall muscle expressed TnT

The sarcomere is attached to the cell membrane by both
dense bodies and M-lines. Many components of the dense
bodies are known, including the enriched genes encoding vinculin (deb-1), talin (Y71G12B.11a,b), afadin (W03F11.6a)
and β-1 integrin (pat-3). Previous studies have also identified
unc-112 and dim-1 as components required for dense body
assembly and maintenance, respectively [44,45]. Other
enriched actin-binding proteins with potential roles in body
muscle assembly include tag-138, a Huntingtin-interacting
protein, and cor-1, which is a homolog of coronin (Table 1).

reports

Thin filaments are primarily composed of actin, troponin,
and tropomyosin (Figure 9). Although actin transcripts are
not enriched in the muscle datasets because of high expression in nonmuscle cells, actin genes (act-2, act-3, act-4, and
act-5) are detected as expressed genes (Additional data file 2).
We do see elevated expression of several actin-binding and
regulatory proteins. Among these are members of the profilin (for example, pfn-3) and gelsolin (for example,
K06A4.3) families, which are proposed to regulate thin filament assembly (Table 1) [1,3]. Sarcomeres are initially assembled during embryonic development. Muscle cells add new
sarcomere repeats and expand in size as the animal grows
[42]. The continuous growth of the contractile apparatus during development could account for the expression of key
structural components (for example, tni-1 and troponin) in
both of the datasets. On the other hand, as noted above, genes
identified in the M0 dataset may play important roles in the
initial formation or organization of the sarcomere, whereas
transcripts that are uniquely enriched in the M24 profile are
required for sarcomere maintenance during expansion of the
body wall muscle cells.

transcripts, mup-2, tnt-2, and tnt-3, and the TnC transcript
pat-10 are enriched in both datasets (Table 1 and Figure 8).

reviews

Muscle structure and function also depend on a family of very
large cytoplasmic proteins, which contain multiple fibronectin and immunoglobulin domains [38,39]. The founding
member of this gene family, unc-22, encodes 'twitchin',
which when mutated causes constant twitching movements
[3,10]. unc-22 is enriched in both datasets. A second member
of this family, titin, adopts an elongated structure that spans
half of the mammalian muscle sarcomere (from Z line to M
line) and functions in myofibril assembly and elasticity [40].
C. elegans titin is somewhat smaller and largely localized to
the thin filament or I band region of the body wall muscle sarcomere. Previous work identified a 90 kilobase gene that
encodes three distinct titin isoforms in C. elegans [38]. We
find that one of the identified titin transcripts (ttn-1) [39] is
enriched in both M0 and M24 datasets (Table 1). Additionally, we identify ketn-1, an invertebrate-specific titin-like
protein [41].

comment

mlc-1 and mlc-2 appear to have redundant functions [3].
Paramyosin (UNC-15), a core component of thick filaments
that interacts with MHC A (MYO-3) and MHC B (UNC-54)
[32,36], shows elevated transcript levels in both M0 and M24
profiles. UNC-45, a highly conserved myosin binding protein
and chaperone that directs assembly of these components, is
enriched (Figure 9) [37].

Key sarcomere components are enriched in microarray profiles of embryonic muscle cells. Schematic diagram of a sarcomere showing thin filament links
to dense bodies (db) and thick filament attachments to the M-line. Molecular identities of indicated genes (for example, deb-1, W03F11.6a, and so on) are

tropic receptors are clustered at the synapse and open transiently in response to neurotransmitter binding. Consistent
with the importance of these molecules in facilitating synaptic
signals, we find a large number of ligand-gated ion channels
to be enriched in body wall muscle cells. All of the subunits of
the levamisole-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR; namely lev-1, lev-8, unc-29, unc-38, and unc63) are enriched [54-56]. Two additional uncharacterized
nAChR genes, acr-8 and acr-16, were also detected. We
recently confirmed that acr-16 is an essential component of
the levamisole-insensitive nAChR, thereby substantiating the
utility of these data for identifying new muscle genes [16,57].
The neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibits
muscle activation and thus works in opposition to acetylcholine receptors. The GABA receptor gene unc-49 that mediates this response is enriched in our datasets [55]. In addition
to the expected acetylcholine and GABA receptors, we also
detected ionotropic receptors for other classes of
neurotransmitters that have not previously been shown to
regulate muscle activity directly in C. elegans. Prominent
among these is mod-1, which encodes a serotonin-gated
chloride channel required for 5-hydroxytryptamine dependent inhibition of C. elegans locomotion [58]. Additional
amine responsive ionotropic receptors include T24D8.1 and
Y113G7A.5, which are activated by 5-hydroxytryptamine
and tyramine, respectively, when they are expressed in Xenopus ooctyes (Abe N, Ringstad N, Horvitz B, personal communication). Other candidate ionotropic anion channel receptor

genes include glc-4 (glutamate-gated chlorine channel) and
T27A1.4 (similar to GABA-A receptor). Excitatory responses
to glutamate could be mediated by glr-8 (glutamate-gated
kainite-type ion channels).

Transcription factors
Mammalian myogenesis is initiated by a family of HLH transcription factors that includes MyoD, myogenin, MRF-4/herculin/Myf-6, and Myf-5 [6]. In C. elegans, hlh-1 encodes
CeMyoD and is detected in all embryogenic lineages (MS, C,
D, and AB) that give rise to the body wall muscle cells [5].
Consistent with the important role of HLH-1 in early myogenesis, the hlh-1 transcript is enriched in both muscle datasets.
Also enriched is the MADS transcription factor UNC-120.
unc-120 is expressed early in embryonic development in muscle precursor cells and appears to cooperate with HLH-1 to
drive muscle gene expression [59]. Additionally, we detect
ceh-13, a member of the HOX family of transcription factors
that regulate cellular differentiation in specific body regions.
ceh-13 expression in the embryo is limited to the anterior
body wall muscles and other cell types in the head region
[60].
In addition to these characterized transcription factors, we
detect eight putative nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs;
Table 1). In C. elegans, the NHR family consists of about 280
receptors that are presumptively regulated by lipophilic hormones to control a variety of processes from sex determination to lifespan [61]. Functions for the NHR transcripts

The evolutionary conservation of sarcomere structure and
function from C. elegans to mammals has made the nematode an attractive model for studies of muscle development
[1-3]. Past work in the worm has been useful for understanding general concepts of myosin filament assembly [8,32,37],
the molecular mechanisms that underlie the transduction of
sarcomere contractile force to connected tissues [2,39] and
the evolution of striated muscle specification [7]. Our gene
expression profiles should similarly shed light on myogenesis
in other species, including humans. Approximately 60% of
transcripts enriched in at least one of the embryonic body
wall muscle datasets (787/1,312) are conserved in the human
genome (BLAST = e-10; Additional data file 13). Although
many of the transcripts in this list encode proteins with well
established roles in mammalian muscle (for example, myosin
heavy chain), potential muscle functions for a substantial
number of additional proteins have not been defined. Of particular interest are 32 transcripts encoding proteins with no
known function in any organism ('uncharacterized conserved
protein'; Additional data file 13). Our data strongly suggest
that many of these novel proteins play important roles in

deposited research

Our application of MAPCeL to C. elegans embryonic body
wall muscle has generated a high-quality gene expression
profile that defines the embryonic muscle transcriptome. We
base this conclusion on five observations. First, we have successfully isolated myo-3::GFP labeled muscle cells directly
from embryos and determined that transcriptional profiles
obtained from these cells are reproducible. Second, sorting of
cultured muscle cell populations yields similarly reproducible
data and a transcriptional profile consistent with more fully
differentiated muscle cells. Third, our muscle-enriched gene
lists are largely distinct from profiles of other nonmuscle cell
types from C. elegans (Additional data file 6). Conversely
(fourth), the MAPCeL datasets show substantial overlap with
an independent experiment in which most embryonic blastomeres were converted to body wall muscle-like cell fates in
vivo and profiled on the Affymetrix array (Additional data file
10) [7]. Fifth, transgenic GFP reporters generated in this
study confirmed that a majority of muscle-enriched genes
were expressed in muscle in vivo. Based on these observations, we suggest that our results provide a comprehensive
profile of gene expression in developing C. elegans body wall
muscle cells. Moreover, the common group of 592 genes in
these microarray profiles that are also specifically upregulated with the induction of embryonic muscle differentation
are likely to comprise a core group of genes with fundamental
roles in myogenesis. An additional 719 genes are identified
that may also contribute substantially to the myogenic program (Figure 6). These lists can now be exploited in future

The strong concurrence of our data with known or predicted
muscle proteins (Table 1) underscores the potential utility of
these MAPCeL profiles for identifying candidate muscle
genes that can now be tested by genetic methods in this model
organism. Examples include F45G2.2, an atypical member of
the myosin II family that shows strong homology to the head
region of known C. elegans body wall muscle myosin heavy
chain genes (for instance, myo-3) but for which a muscle
function has not previously been described. Muscle enrichment of tag-138 is intriguing because its vertebrate homolog
HIP1 (Huntingtin interacting protein 1) mediates receptor
endocytosis, is highly expressed in a variety of human tumors,
and may function as an oncogene [63]. Mutations affecting
components of the DGC result in human muscular dystrophies, and similar genetic defects in C. elegans also disrupt
body wall muscle structure and function [49-51]. Our muscle
datasets have detected potential additional members of the
DGC, namely the sarcoglycan-like genes sgcb-1 and H22K11.4
and a syntrophin-like gene, stn-2, which can now be experimentally tested for related functions. In addition to confirming muscle enrichment of known neurotransmitter-gated ion
channels, these data have also identified several new possible
receptors for modulating muscle activity. Indeed, enrichment
of the nAChR subunit gene acr-16 in the M24 dataset led to
physiological experiments that confirmed a key role for the
ACR-16 receptor in acetylcholine-evoked muscle excitation
[16,57]. These positive results, which are based on a limited
survey of the muscle genes in our datasets, suggest that a
more detailed analysis of these gene lists should reveal a substantial number of additional muscle functional genes.

Discussion

work for studies of muscle development, myofibril assembly,
and muscle function (Additional data file 8).

reviews

A total of 38 transcription factors are enriched in muscle cells
in these experiments (Table 1). The functions of a majority of
these transcription factors in muscle development have not
been explored. It is also interesting that most of these transcription factors are selectively enriched in either the M0 (13)
or M24 (18) dataset (Table 1). This finding could mean that
muscle development is orchestrated by a diverse array of
transcription factors with functions that are specifically
required in either early muscle precursor cells or later to regulate expression of terminal muscle differentiation.

Fox et al. R188.15

comment

showing enriched expression in our muscle datasets have not
been characterized. However, recent studies of an NHR gene,
nhr-40, which is detected as an expressed gene in both datasets, have identified a key role in muscle development; mutations in nhr-40 result in late embryonic/early larval arrest
with irregular development of body wall muscle cells and
uncoordinated locomotion [62]. The significance of this class
of transcription factors to vertebrate muscle development is
uncertain because the majority of nematode NHR sequences
are not well conserved. On the other hand, the absence of
clear mammalian homologs offers the possibility of developing phylum-specific nematocides that target these diverged
NHR proteins.

myogenesis or muscle function and serve as ripe targets for
future studies, both in C. elegans and in other animals.
We view this study as a starting point for determining how the
C. elegans muscle cell transcriptome regulates myogenesis.
Our approach provides a temporal component by profiling
both nascent and differentiated muscle cells, and we have
examples from our data in which transcript appearance
mimics the known order of protein assembly within the sarcomere (for example, UNC-54). It may be possible to enhance
the temporal resolution of MAPCeL by profiling embryos
expressing a series of muscle reporters that come on at successive developmental time points. These data could potentially provide clues as to how the transcriptome temporally
orchestrates myogenesis to assemble myofibrils into functional sarcomeres. Profiling data collected from subsets of
embryonic muscle (anal and pharyngeal muscles) could also
reveal gene sets with specialized functions in these different
muscle types.
The embryonic muscle profiles described in this paper show
substantial overlap (about 600 genes) with an independent
microarray dataset obtained from embryonic muscle cells
induced by ectopic expression of the MRF related transcription factor HLH-1 (Figure 6 and Additional data file 10) [7].
Our MAPCeL datasets show less similarity, however (about
250 common genes), with a profile of larval muscles obtained
using the mRNA tagging strategy (Additional data file 8). In
this approach, an epitope-tagged poly-A binding protein was
used to specifically pull down body wall muscle transcripts
from L1 stage larvae [25]. It seems unlikely that this result can
be fully attributed to differences in developmental age
(embryonic versus larval) because reporter gene constructs
for genes in our MAPCeL datasets showed post-embryonic
expression in one or more muscle types (Figure 7). One
potential explanation for this disparity is the relative sensitivity of the two profiling approaches used to generate these
data.
A recent modification of the mRNA tagging strategy that
reduces background RNA could yield a deeper dataset of larval muscle enriched transcripts [24]. The use of the mRNA
tagging method to profile larval muscles is necessary because
post-embryonic cells are not readily accessible to MAPCeL
analysis [14,17]. mRNA tagging affords the additional benefit
of providing sharply defined temporal profiles of gene expression that could potentially identify transcriptional cascades of
genes that control muscle differentiation and growth during
this period. Finally, mRNA tagging profiles of aging body wall
muscle cells could reveal transcriptionally regulated genes
associated with sarcopenia, an evolutionarily conserved process in which body wall muscles in C. elegans exhibit morphological disorganization and functional decline that resembles
the progressive age-related muscle atrophy that occurs in
mammals [64]. In this context, it will be interesting to
compare these gene expression data with MAPCeL profiles of

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R188

embryonic muscle cells maintained in culture for prolonged
periods to potentially distinguish between autonomous versus environmentally induced aging processes.

Conclusion

We used MAPCeL to generate comprehensive descriptions of
gene expression in developing C. elegans embryonic body
wall muscle cells. In addition to detecting known muscle
genes, our MAPCeL dataset has also identified a large number
of previously uncharacterized transcripts with potentially
important roles in muscle development or structure. Therefore, this work defines a basic muscle transcriptome that can
lead to new discoveries into how these genes are deployed to
drive myofibril assembly and function.

Materials and methods
Nematode strains
Nematode strains were maintained at 20°C to 25°C using
standard culture methods [9]. Strains used for microarray
experiments were the N2 wild-type isolate and PD4251
(ccIs4251 and myo-3::GFP) [65]. Transgenic GFP reporter
lines generated from muscle-enriched genes are listed in
Additional data file 11.

Generating transgenic promoter::GFP strains to
validate microarray data
Promoter regions for GFP reporter constructs were either
cloned into the BamHI site of pPD95.67 (Fire Lab Vector Kit
1995, Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) or fused to GFP in
this same vector using the sequence overlap extension (SOE)
method [66]. Transgenic animals were created by microinjection of a mixture including 23 µl (5 to 10 ng/µl) of SOE reaction with 3 µl (60 ng/µl) pRF4 [rol-6(d)] as a co-injectable
marker. There were two exceptions to this method
(H22K11.4::GFP and E02H4.3::GFP), which were generated
using biolistic transformation. For these two reporters, promoter regions were cloned into HindIII (H22K11.4)/PstI
(E02H4.3) and XmaI sites of pPD95.75 GFP plasmid (1995
Fire Vector Kit) along with the unc-119 minigene. Microparticle bombardment was conducted as previously described
[14]. At least two stable extrachromosomal transgenic lines
were generated for each construct and examined multiple
times at all developmental stages for muscle expression.
Lines that gave reproducible expression in at least one myo3::GFP expressed muscle cell type (body wall, defecation, and
vulval) were scored as positive; the exact GFP pattern
description for each transgenic strain is indicated in Additional data file 11.

Cell culture
C. elegans embryos were dissociated for FACS isolation of
freshly dissociated myo-3::GFP muscle cells (M0; see below).
Embryonic cells were also cultured for 24 hours, as described

previously [14], to generate the M24 myo-3::GFP muscle cells
for FACS isolation [17].

FACS experiments were conducted on a FACStar Plus flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped
with a 488 nm argon laser. Emission filters were 530 ± 30 nm
for GFP and 585 ± 22 nm for propidium iodide (PI). The
machine was flushed with egg buffer [17] and light scattering
parameters calibrated with 2 µm beads. The rate of sorting
was 4,000 to 5,000 cells per second through a 70 µm nozzle.

The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in
the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Gene
Expression Omnibus [69,70] and are accessible through Gene
Expression Omnibus series accession numbers GSE8462
(M0 and M24) and GSE8231 (HLH-1).

RNA was extracted from FACS isolated GFP positive muscle
cells for comparison with reference RNA obtained from a
sorted population containing all viable embryonic cells. RNA
was isolated using a Micro-RNA isolation kit (Strategene, La

a modification of the Affymetrix GeneChip Eukaryotic Small
Sample Labeling Protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA,

For the M0 and M24 datasets, the list of present calls as
defined above was modified to exclude transcripts that can be
attributed to the small fraction (about 10%) of non-GFP cells
in the sorted preparations. Transcripts from these contaminating cells were identified as genes showing relative enrichment in the reference datasets obtained from all embryonic
cells (978 for M0 muscle and 961 for M24 muscle). A limited
number of transcripts (54 in M0 muscle and 190 in M24
muscle) initially flagged as 'absent' by MAS 5.0 on the basis of
perfect match versus mismatch signals were restored to the
expressed gene files because significance analysis of microarray analysis scores these genes as enriched in the muscle samples relative to reference. These considerations identified
5,170 expressed genes in the M0 muscle dataset and 6,088
expressed genes in the M24 muscle dataset (Additional data
file 2).

RNA isolation, amplification, and hybridization

All experiments were performed in triplicate with the exception of the cultured cell reference dataset (R24), which was
generated from four independent experiments [14]. Raw signal intensities were scaled for interchip comparisons using
Affymetrix MAS 5.0. Transcripts were deemed 'present' if
assigned a 'present' call by Affymetrix MAS 5.0 in a majority
of replicates for a given sample (two-thirds for M0 muscle,
two-thirds for M24 muscle, two-thirds for reference R0, and
three-quarters for reference R24). Intensity values were normalized using robust multiarray analysis (Additional data file
1), available through GeneTraffic (Iobion), and statistical
analysis was performed with significance analysis of microarray software [68]. A two-class unpaired analysis was performed to identify genes that are elevated 1.7-fold or greater
when compared with the reference for each dataset, at a false
discovery rate of 1.8% or less for M0 and 1.2% or less for the
M24 datasets. For the M0 muscle dataset, 770 genes were
considered significantly enriched whereas 937 genes were
enriched in the M24 muscle dataset (Additional data file 4).

Data analysis

reports

Cultured myo-3::GFP muscle cells were isolated as previously
described [14,16]. Reference datasets were generated from all
viable embryonic cells sorted either immediately after dissociation (R0) or after 24 hours in culture (R24).

during the second round of amplification using the BioArray
High Yield RNA transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo, New York, NY,
USA). Fifteen micrograms of biotinylated aRNA was fragmented for hybridization to the Affymetrix C. elegans array.
RNA quality was assessed after fragmentation with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

reviews

myo-3::GFP labeled cells were isolated from freshly dissociated embryos as follows. Chitinase-treated embryos were dissociated by gentle re-suspension in egg buffer and passed
through a 5 µm durapore filter to remove intact embryos and
debris. Cells were counted on a hemocytometer and diluted to
a concentration of about 10 million cells/ml. PI was added to
a final concentration of 5 µg/ml. FACS parameters for setting
the GFP positive gate were established as follows. First, wildtype non-GFP embryonic cells (from N2) were used to identify a population of autofluorescent cells. These gut cells fluoresce in both the red (PI) and green (GFP) channels and can
be visualized along the diagonal axis of the scatter plot in Figure 2c. Next, gating criteria for non-viable cells were determined by sorting wildtype cells stained with PI. These scatter
plots were compared with a profile of myo-3::GFP embryonic
cells to define the GFP sorting window (Figure 2d). Viable
GFP positive muscle cells were then gated according to light
scattering parameters (Size, x-axis; and granularity, y-axis;
Figure 2e) to isolate a subpopulation of cells that excludes
large clumps and small debris. Direct visual inspection of
myo-3::GFP cells isolated according to these criteria confirmed that GFP positive cells comprise about 90% of the total
population for an overall sixfold enrichment (90%/15%) of
myo-3::GFP cells after FACS in comparison to the intact
embryo (Figure 2f). A typical sort yielded about 300,000
myo-3::GFP cells.
