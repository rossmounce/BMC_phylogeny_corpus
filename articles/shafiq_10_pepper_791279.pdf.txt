Pepper leaf curl Lahore virus requires the DNA B
component of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus
to cause leaf curl symptoms
Muhammad Shafiq, Shaheen Asad, Yusuf Zafar, Rob W Briddon, Shahid Mansoor*

Abstract
Background: Begomoviruses are whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses with genomes that consist of either two
components (known as DNA A and DNA B) or a single component (homologous to the DNA A component of
bipartite begomoviruses). Monopartite begomoviruses are often associated with a symptom-modulating DNA
satellite (collectively known as betasatellites). Both bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses with associated
satellites have previously been identified in chillies showing leaf curl symptoms in Pakistan.
Results: A chilli plant (Capsicum annum) with chilli leaf curl disease symptoms was found to contain a
begomovirus, a betasatellite and the DNA B component of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV). The
begomovirus consisted of 2747 nucleotides and had the highest sequence identity (99%) with Pepper leaf curl
Lahore virus (PepLCLV-[PK: Lah:04], acc. no. AM404179). Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of the clone to
Nicotiana benthamiana, induced very mild symptoms and low levels of viral DNA, detected in systemically infected
leaves by PCR. No symptoms were induced in Nicotiana tabacum or chillies either in the presence or absence of a
betasatellite. However, inoculation of PepLCLV with the DNA B component of ToLCNDV induced leaf curl
symptoms in N. benthamiana, N. tabacum and chillies and viral DNA accumulated to higher levels in comparison
to plants infected with just PepLCLV.
Conclusions: Based on our previous efforts aimed at understanding of diversity of begomoviruses associated with
chillies, we propose that PepLCLV was recently mobilized into chillies upon its interaction with DNA B of ToLCNDV.
Interestingly, the putative rep-binding iterons found on PepLCLV (GGGGAC) differ at two base positions from those
of ToLCNDV (GGTGTC). This is the first experimental demonstration of the infectivity for a bipartite begomovirus
causing chilli leaf curl disease in chillies from Pakistan and suggests that component capture is contributing to the
emerging complexity of begomovirus diseases in the region.

Background
Viruses of the family Geminiviridae have circular, singlestranded (ss) DNA genomes and are divided into four
genera based upon genome arrangement, host range and
insect vectors. The most numerous, and economically
the most destructive, are the whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses that are included in the genus Begomovirus
[1,2]. Begomoviruses are transmitted by the whitefly
Bemisia tabaci and exclusively infect dicotyledonous
plants. They have emerged everywhere in the world
where environmental conditions support large whitefly

populations, and have become a major constraint in the
production of food and fiber crops such as cassava,
tomato, cucurbits, pepper, beans and cotton [3-5].
Chilli leaf curl disease (ChLCD) is an important factor
limiting chilli production on the Indian subcontinent
and is caused by begomoviruses [6-8]. Symptoms of the
disease are severe leaf curl with cup-shaped, upward
curling leaves, yellowing, and stunted plant growth. Previously chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) has been
identified in a large collection of chilli samples with leaf
curl symptoms from all over the Pakistan [9]. A single
species of betasatellite (ChLCB) was found associated
with isolates showing geographical segregation and are
similar to that reported earlier [6]. Chilli peppers often

show symptoms similar to tomato leaf curl disease, such
as yellowing, leaf curling, a reduction in leaf size and
stunting. Since chilli and tomato crops overlap in the
field, it is likely that chilli peppers may become infected
with tomato begomoviruses. The disease was experimentally transmitted from infected to healthy chilli and
tomato seedlings by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci [10,11].
Inoculated chilli plants developed typical symptoms of
the disease. However, the inoculated tomato plants
developed severe leaf curl symptoms similar to those of
leaf curl disease of tomato caused by Tomato leaf curl
New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) [11,12]. Analysis of a large
collection of chilli samples from Pakistan showed that
diverse begomoviruses may infect chillies [7]. Recently
another distinct begomovirus, Pepper leaf curl Lahore
(PepLCLV), has been identified in chilli in Pakistan
although the infectivity of the virus to chillies was not
established experimentally [13].
Here we have characterised a further isolate of
PepLCLV from chilli and have investigated its interaction with betasatellites and the DNA B component of
ToLCNDV. We show that the virus requires the DNA B
of ToLCNDV to infect plants and induce disease symptoms but its interaction with ChLCB is poor.

Materials and methods
Collection of virus infected plant samples

A chilli plant showing typical symptoms of begomovirus
infection was observed in a field near Faisalabad,
Pakistan, in 2004. A leaf sample with leaf curl symptoms
and a leaf from an asymptomatic plant were collected.
Samples were brought to the laboratory and stored at
-80°C before extraction of DNA. This isolate was previously shown to harbour ChLCB ([PK:Fai69:04]; acc.
no. AM279673) [9].
Isolation, cloning and sequencing

Total DNA was extracted from symptomatic and asymptomatic chilli samples using the CTAB method [14]. Universal primers were used in PCR to amplify full-length
begomovirus, betasatellite and alphasatellite molecules
[15-17]. Two primer pairs, BC1F/BC1R [10], were used
for the detection of DNA B of ToLCNDV. PCR amplified
products of the expected sizes resulting from DNA
extracted from the symptomatic leaf sample were cloned
into the pTZ57R/T vector (Fermentas, Arlington,
Canada) and a single clone, containing a potentially fulllength begomovirus clone (~2800 nt), designated PGL1,
was selected for further analysis. PGL1 was sequenced in
both orientations with no ambiguities remaining (Macrogen, Korea). DNA sequences were assembled and analyzed with the aid of the Lasergene package of sequence
analysis software (DNA Star Inc., Madison, WI, USA),
and multiple sequence alignments were performed using

Clustal X [18]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using
Clustal X (neighbor-joining method), displayed, manipulated and printed using Treeview [19]. Specific pairwise
comparisons of all available sequences in the databases
used the Pairwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) tool
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc.
Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of plants

Standard methods were used to produce partial direct
and tandem repeat constructs for Agrobacteriummediated inoculation in the binary vector pGreen0092
[20]. After sequence confirmation of PGL1, a 1498 nt
fragment encompassing the intergenic region was excised
from with XbaI and EcoRI and subcloned into the XbaIEcoRI sites of pGreen0092 to produce the clone pGPeA.
The full-length insert of PGL1 was excised with XbaI and
inserted into pGPeA at its unique XbaI site to yield clone
icPGL1. Insert integrity and orientation were confirmed
by digestion with EcoRI. This partial direct repeat of
PGL1 was mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain GV3103 by electroporation.
The infectivity of PGL1 was performed alone or in combination with the DNA B component of ToLCNDV [21],
chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB-[PK:MC:97]; acc. no
AJ316032; [6]) and cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite
(CLCuMB-[PK:Fai1:96]; AJ298903; [22]) in Nicotiana
benthamiana, N. tabacum cv Samsun, and Capsicum
annum cv Loungi by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation.
A total of 10 plants were inoculated for each plant species.
Plants were kept at 25°C with 70% relative humidity and
16 h/day light in an insect-free greenhouse. Plants were
examined daily for the appearance of symptoms.

Results
Detection of begomovirus components in chilli samples
showing leaf curl symptoms

We have previously shown that chillies with leaf curl
symptoms are associated with both monopartite begomoviruses along with a betasatellite as well as ToLCNDV
[12]. Initially, to confirm the presence of a begomovirus
in the symptomatic sample collected, diagnostic primer
pairs were used in PCR amplifications with total nucleic
acids extracted from the plant. Universal primers that
amplify begomovirus DNA A, BegomoF and BegomoR,
were used in PCR [17]. A PCR product of the expected
size (approximately 2.8 kb) was amplified from the symptomatic chilli plant, and no amplification products of the
expected size were obtained from healthy or asymptomatic chilli plants, confirming the association of a begomovirus with the disease. The DNA B of ToLCNDV was
detected using primer pair BC1F/BC1R [10]. These primers are specific for the movement protein (MP) gene of
ToLCNDV and gave an amplification product of approximately 850 nt, confirming the presence of ToLCNDV

DNA B in the symptomatic plant. The presence of a
betasatellite in samples was detected using the universal
primer pair Beta01/Beta02 [16]. These primers produced
a fragment of approximately 1350 nt and confirmed the
presence of a betasatellite in the sample. The betasatellite
was characterized earlier and shown to be an isolate of
ChLCB [9].
Analysis of the sequence of PGL1

The sequence of the begomovirus clone PGL1 was
determined to be 2747 nt in length and this sequence is
available in the databases under accession number
AM691745. Sequence comparisons revealed that the
genome had the highest sequence identity (99%) with
PepLCLV-[PK:Lah:04](AM404179) followed by 89% with
PepLCuBDV-PK[PK:Kha:04](DQ116881). This indicates
that PGL1 is an isolate of PepLCLV for which we propose the isolate descriptor PepLCLV-[PK:Fai:04] [23].

This conclusion is supported by a phylogenetic analysis
which shows PGL1 to group with the only other isolate
of PepLCLV for which a full-length sequence is available
in the databases (PepLCLV-[PK:Lah:04]) and to be closely related to PepLCBDV (Figure 1).
The clone shows the typical genome organization of
begomoviruses with two open reading frames (ORFs) in
the virion-sense (V2 and V1) and four in the complementary-sense (C1, C2, C3 and C4) [2]. The main
genetic features of this begomovirus sequence are given
in Table 1. Among the six ORFs, a small difference was
noted in the gene encoding the replication-associated
protein (Rep). The sequence of the PepLCLV isolate
determined here has the capacity to encode a Rep that
is larger than that of the only other isolates of this virus
characterised to date [13], as well as those of other
begomoviruses. The Rep protein has a potential 14
amino acid leader sequence at the N-terminal end that

is not present in closely related begomoviruses infecting
pepper (Figure 2). The intergenic region (IR) consists of
approximately 241 nucleotides and is similar to those of
ToLCNDV isolates (Figure 3 Table 2). The IR contains
a predicted stem-loop sequence with conserved nonanucleotide sequence (TAATATTAC) in the loop which
can be found in the majority of geminiviruses characterized to date and marks the origin of virion-strand DNA
replication [24]. Within the intergenic region, incomplete direct repeats of an iteron (GGGGAC) were
detected adjacent to the TATA box of the Rep promoter. These sequences are species specific Rep binding
motifs [25,26].

ChLCB clone is infectious and capable of enhancing
helper virus symptoms. However, when inoculated in
the presence of ChLCB, PepLCLV also only induced
very mild symptoms in N. benthamiana (Figure 4) and
the virus levels in plants were below the detection
threshold of Southern blot hybridisation (Figure 5).
Inoculation of PepLCLV to N. tabacum, either alone or
with ChLCB did not result in infection. In order to
further study the interaction of PepLCLV with betasatellites, the clone was inoculated with another distinct
betasatellite, CLCuMB [6]. However, inoculation with
these betasatellites did not result in infection. Both
CLCuMB and ChLCB were infectious to N. benthamiana with the helper virus CLCuMV (Table 3).

Infectivity and symptoms of PepLCLV

The infectivity of PepLCLV clone PGL1 was investigated
in N. benthamiana, N. tabacum Samsun, and C. annum
by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation (Table 3).
Inoculation of N. benthamiana with PepLCLV resulted
in low infectivity (2/10) and infected plants exhibited
very mild leaf curl symptoms (Figure 4). The virus was
detected in systemic leaves by PCR with specific primers
but was not detected by Southern blot hybridisation
(Figure 5), indicating that only very low levels of virus
DNA accumulated in infected plants. ChLCB was infectious to N. benthamiana with the helper virus Cotton
leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV) and induced very
severe leaf curl symptoms (Table 3), indicating that the

Agroinoculation with partial repeats of PepLCLV along
with the DNA B of ToLCNDV [21] induced leaf curl
symptoms in N. tabacum Samsun, N. benthamiana, and
C. annum. The symptoms in N. benthamiana consisted
of severe upward leaf curling and severe stunting.
Southern hybridization using PepLCLV as probe
detected typical begomovirus replication intermediates
(Figure 5). Virus levels accumulating in plants inoculated with PepLCLV alone were not detectable by
Southern hybridization (Figure 5 lane 2). Inoculation of

Discussion
The geminiviruses are a rapidly emerging group of plant
viruses, which can be attributed to various factors,
including increased insect vector populations and the
presence of alternative hosts. Though it was speculated
that geminiviruses had the capacity to evolve rapidly in
response to changes in their environment (such as alterations in cropping systems and/or population dynamics of
the insect vector), there are few studies documenting
geminivirus evolution. The success in the Old World of
begomoviruses that associate with betasatellites appears
to be due to the ability of betasatellites to be replicated

by several distinct begomoviruses [27]. Thus, the ability
of begomoviruses to interact with diverse betasatellites,
the mobilization of begomovirus components from alternate hosts and recombination among begomoviruses or
associated satellites has been documented as the major
driving force in rapid emergence and resistance breakdown by begomovirus-betasatellite complexes [5]. There
are numerous reports documenting mixed infection of
geminiviruses. For example, in cassava, infection by two
distinct begomovirus species resulted in a severe disease
due to synergism [28]. Interestingly, ToLCNDV, a bipartite begomovirus has been consistently detected in several hosts in the Indian subcontinent and suggest that
the virus has flexibility in its interaction with other begomovirus components that may help virus to expand host
range. We have previously shown that ToLCNDV interacts with ChLCB under field conditions that result in
severe symptoms [12]. Another study showed that

Tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus captured the DNA B
component of ToLCNDV, resulting in a virus capable of
inducing more severe disease symptoms [29,30]. Our
recent analysis has shown that ToLCGV may exist without a DNA B in some weeds (M. Mubin, manuscript in
preparation) which suggests that ToLCGV was mobilized
from a weed into tomato upon its interaction with the
DNA B of ToLCNDV. Thus, it appears that component
capture during mixed infection, probably in weed hosts,
may result in viruses with enhanced virulence to crop
plants.
Geminivirus genomes replicate by a rolling circle
mechanism which is initiated by the virus-encoded replication-associated protein (Rep) [31]. Rep is a sequence

specific DNA binding protein which recognises and
binds to repeated sequences, known as iterons, in the
intergenic region immediately upstream of a hairpin
structure that contains the ubiquitous (for geminiviruses) nonanucleotide sequence (TAATATTAC).
Rep then initiates replication by nicking in the nonanucleotide sequence. The DNA A and DNA B components
of bipartite begomoviruses have the same iteron
sequences, thereby ensuring that the DNA A-encoded
Rep may initiate replication of both components; maintaining the integrity of the split genome. However,
mutational analyses and sequencing of field isolates suggests that begomoviruses may tolerate some sequence

total DNA was loaded per sample. A photograph of the genomic DNA

variation in iteron sequences without deleterious effects
on Rep recognition. Here we show that the predicted
iteron sequence of PepLCLV (GGGGAC) differs at two
base positions from the iteron sequence of ToLCNDV
(GGTGTC; Figure 5). Thus, it appears that the first two
or three bases may be more important in iteron recognition by Rep. An interesting finding of the study is that
PepLCLV isolate examined here has no, or at least only
limited, ability to trans-replicate betasatellites. This contrasts with the results of Tahir et al. [13], who showed
the association of ChLCB with another isolate of
PepLCLV from Pakistan. Our analysis suggests that the
putative Rep protein of the virus has an N-terminal leader sequence (Figure 2) which may be important in the
inability of the virus to trans-replicate betasatellites.
However, in the absence of any evidence this remains a
hypothesis that requires confirmation by mutagenesis.
The other possibility may be that there are natural variants of PepLCLV that lack leader peptide in the Rep
protein that may be able interact with betasatellites.
Since our efforts to characterize begomoviruses in
recent samples is not exhaustive, it will not be surprising if another begomovirus capable of interaction with
betasatellite is present in naturally infected chillies.
Chilli leaf curl disease (ChLCD) is an important factor
limiting chilli production across Pakistan and India. The
genomes of begomoviruses are either bipartite (with two
genomic components known as DNA A and DNA B)
monopartite (with a genome consisting of only a homolog
of the DNA A component) or monopartite associated with
a symptom determining satellite (collectively known as
betasatellites). All three types have been previously identified in chillies [9,10,12]. The full-length genome of a begomovirus associated with ChLCD originating from the
Punjab (Pakistan), PGL1 was cloned and shown to consist
of 2747 nucleotides. Sequence comparisons showed that
the genome had the highest sequence identity (99%) with
Pepper leaf curl Lahore virus (PepLCLV-[PK:Lah:04]) indicating that it represents an isolate of PepLCLV based on
the 89% species demarcation threshold for begomoviruses
[23]. Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of the clone to
N. benthamiana induced only very mild symptoms. Inoculation of the clone with a betasatellite previously isolated
from a ChLCD affected plant gave similarly mild symptoms and virus levels were not detectable by Southern
hybridization. However, inoculation with the DNA B component of ToLCNDV induced symptoms typical of
ChLCD in N. benthamiana, N. tabacum and C. annum.
These results suggest that the virus characterised here
may be bipartite. A surprising finding is that the levels of
viral DNA were lower in plants inoculated with
PepLCBDV, ToLCNDV DNA B and ChLCB in comparison to plants inoculated in the absence of ChLCB (Figure

Page 7 of 8

5). This is the first experimental demonstration of infectivity for a bipartite begomovirus causing ChLCD.
These results presented here demonstrate that ChLCD
in Pakistan may be caused by a bipartite variant of
PepLCLV, which is associated with a DNA B component related to ToLCNDV DNA B, in addition to a
monopartite variant of PepLCLV which associates with
a betasatellite (ChLCB) [13]. The difference in the ability
of the two PepLCLV isolates to interact with ChLCB
may be due to the presence, in the isolate characterised
here, of additional N-terminal amino acid sequences of
Rep. However, since we as yet do not fully understand
the mechanism of interaction of begomovirus-encoded
Rep with betasatellites to initiate satellite replication
(betasatellites lack the iteron sequences encoded by
their helper viruses [27]), this will require experimental
confirmation. Despite the differences in the predicted
iteron sequences of PepLCLV and ToLCNDV, PepLCLV
has the ability to trans-replicate ToLCNDV DNA B and
induce ChLCD in experimental hosts and chilli. This is
the first experimental demonstration of Koch’s postulates using cloned viral DNA components for a bipartite
begomovirus causing ChLCD. The bipartite PepLCV has
some residual ability to interact with betasatellites
although the presence in plants of both a DNA B and a
betasatellites appears to reduce virus titre and symptom
severity, suggestive of interference. The nature of this
interference will be the focus of our future studies since
this may provide a novel mechanism of obtaining resistance to the viruses causing ChLCD. The complex nature of ChLCD across the Indian sub-continent, which
has been shown to be caused by several bipartite and
monopartite, betasatellite-associated begomoviruses will
be a challenge for the development of resistant varieties
either by conventional or non-conventional means. The
high yield losses resulting from ChLCD are threatening
chilli cultivation and are forcing farmers in some areas
to grow other crops.
