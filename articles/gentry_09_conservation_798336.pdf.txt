Abstract
Background: Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. A
hallmark of LD is cytoplasmic accumulation of insoluble glucans, called Lafora bodies (LBs).
Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphatase laforin account for ~50% of LD cases, and this gene
is conserved in all vertebrates. We recently demonstrated that laforin is the founding member of
a unique class of phosphatases that dephosphorylate glucans.
Results: Herein, we identify laforin orthologs in a protist and two invertebrate genomes, and
report that laforin is absent in the vast majority of protozoan genomes and it is lacking in all other
invertebrate genomes sequenced to date. We biochemically characterized recombinant proteins
from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae to
demonstrate that they are laforin orthologs. We demonstrate that the laforin gene has a unique
evolutionary lineage; it is conserved in all vertebrates, a subclass of protists that metabolize
insoluble glucans resembling LBs, and two invertebrates. We analyzed the intron-exon boundaries
of the laforin genes in each organism and determine, based on recently published reports describing
rates of molecular evolution in Branchiostoma and Nematostella, that the conservation of laforin is
linked to the molecular rate of evolution and the glucan metabolism of an organism.
Conclusion: Our results alter the existing view of glucan phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and
strongly suggest that glucan phosphorylation is a multi-Kingdom regulatory mechanism,
encompassing at least some invertebrates. These results establish boundaries concerning which
organisms contain laforin. Laforin is conserved in all vertebrates, it has been lost in the vast majority
of lower organisms, and yet it is an ancient gene that is conserved in a subset of protists and
invertebrates that have undergone slower rates of molecular evolution and/or metabolize a
carbohydrate similar to LBs. Thus, the laforin gene holds a unique place in evolutionary biology and
has yielded insights into glucan metabolism and the molecular etiology of Lafora disease.

Background
Lafora disease (LD; OMIM 254780) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is one of five major
progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) [1]. LD com-

monly presents as a single seizure in the second decade of
the patient's life, followed by progressive central nervous
system degeneration, intellectual decline, and death
within ten years of the first seizure [2-4]. LD is unique

among the PMEs because of the patient's rapid neurological deterioration and the accumulation of insoluble glucans/carbohydrates called Lafora bodies (LB) [5,6].

number of seizures, and LB accumulation as they age;
thus, it is hypothesized that LBs trigger these symptoms
and ultimately the death of the patient [6].

While animals normally store glucans as soluble glycogen,
LBs are accumulations of poorly branched, hyperphosphorylated, insoluble glucans and are not glycogen. Forty
years ago, Sakai and co-workers biochemically characterized LBs and found that they more closely resemble plant
starch than glycogen [6-8]. Although LBs are found in the
cytoplasm of most cells, cell death only occurs in neurons
[3]. LD patients exhibit increased neuronal cell death,

EPM2A (epilepsy of progressive myoclonus type 2) is
mutated in ~50% LD cases [9,10]. EPM2A encodes a protein named laforin that contains a carbohydrate binding
module (CBM) followed by the canonical dual specificity
phosphatase (DSP) active site motif, HCXXGXXRS/T
(Cx5R) [9,11] (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, recombinant laforin
binds glucans, in vitro and in vivo, and it possesses phosphatase activity in vitro [12,13]. Out of ~130 human phos-

phatases laforin is the only phosphatase with a CBM.
While data placed laforin in the context of being intimately, if not directly, involved in glycogen metabolism,
the molecular etiology of LD was unknown for almost
100 years.
We recently demonstrated that laforin is not restricted to
vertebrate genomes, as originally thought [14], but that
laforin orthologs are present in five protists (i.e. single-cell
eukaryotes) [15]. Each of these five protists undergoes
hibernation during their life cycle and when they hibernate they generate an insoluble glucan as an energy source
[16-18]. We recognized that the glucan produced by these
protists are biochemically similar to Lafora bodies and
proposed that laforin functions to convert insoluble glucans into energy, and in vertebrates it functions to inhibit
insoluble glucan accumulation (i.e. LBs) [15].
To test this hypothesis, we utilized a recently characterized
gene in Arabidopsis called starch excess 4 (SEX4) [19,20].
SEX4 encodes a protein with similar domains as laforin
but in the opposite orientation (Fig. 1B). Disruption of
SEX4 leads to increased accumulation of insoluble glucans (i.e. starch), a cellular phenotype reminiscent of LD
patients [19]. We found that when laforin was targeted to
the chloroplast of sex4-deficient plants that it rescued the
sex4 mutant phenotype. Demonstrating that laforin and
SEX4 are functional equivalents and that a laforin-like
activity is required to regulate the metabolism of insoluble glucans in multiple Kingdoms [15].
We also demonstrated the nature of this activity; we
showed that laforin and SEX4 dephosphorylate the glucan
itself [15,21,22]. Thus, we proposed that when laforin is
absent, phosphates accumulate in glycogen precursors,
branching is inhibited, and Lafora bodies form. This prediction was supported by work published 40 years ago
showing LBs from human patients are poorly branched
and contain 4–5 fold more phosphate than glycogen, and
further corroborated by data from the Roach lab confirming these results in a LD mouse model [23,24]. Therefore,
laforin regulates an overlooked aspect of glycogen metabolism in vertebrates by removing phosphate from glycans
during glycogen synthesis.
Herein, we establish definitive boundaries concerning the
evolutionary conservation of laforin by probing more
than 210 eukaryotic genomes. We utilized criteria that we
previously defined to correctly predict a laforin ortholog
in the genome of the protozoan Neospora caninum. In
addition, we extend our previous results by uncovering
putative laforin orthologs in two invertebrates, Nematostella vectensis and Branchiostoma floridae. We cloned the
respective genes and biochemically verified that they are
laforin orthologs. Furthermore, we present evidence and
hypothesize why laforin is conserved in these two inverte-

brates and is absent in all others sequenced to date.
Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that the glucan
phosphatase laforin is conserved in a subset of eukaryotic
organisms from an array of evolutionary niches, vertebrates, invertebrates, and protists, and highlights the fundamental importance of glucan phosphorylation/
dephosphorylation.

Results and discussion
Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) are domains typically found in glucosylhydrolases and glucotransferases
in bacterial, fungal, or plant genomes [25-27]. The vast
majority of enzymes containing CBMs utilize the domain
to bind a specific glucan and enzymatically act on the
sugar, as in the case of α-amylase [25]. Accordingly, we
recently demonstrated, and others confirmed, that laforin
and SEX4 bind and dephosphorylate glucans, glycogen
and starch, respectively [15,21,23,24]. While laforin and
SEX4 bind similar types of glucans, they utilize evolutionarily distinct CBMs [25]. CBMs are classified into fiftythree evolutionarily distinct families, based on primary
sequence, secondary and tertiary predictions, and crystal
structures [25]. Laforin contains an amino-terminal
CBM20 and SEX4 a carboxy-terminal CBM21 type CBM
(Fig. 1A &1B). Although laforin and SEX4 have evolutionarily distinct CBMs, multiple groups have proposed that
CBM20 and CBM21 may share a common evolutionary
origin and suggest keeping distinct families grouped into
a common CBM clan [28-31].
Confirmation of laforin predictions
Previously we reported that out of 170 eukaryotic
genomes (including 94 protozoan) and 670 bacterial
genomes that the laforin gene is only conserved in vertebrate genomes and in five protozoan genomes, Toxoplasma gondii, Eimeria tenella, Tetrahymena thermophila,
Paramecium tetraurelia, and Cyanidioschyzon merolae [15]
(Fig. 1C). In addition, we demonstrated that SEX4 is conserved in green algae and land plants (collectively known
as Archaeplastida/Kingdom Plantae) and showed that
while laforin and SEX4 are not orthologous proteins that
they are functional equivalents [15] (Fig. 1C). Our phylogenetic analyses and examination of the biology and evolution of the five protists that have laforin led us to
propose three criteria to predict if a protozoan genome
would contain laforin: the organism must 1) be of red
algal descent, 2) possess a true mitochondrion, and 3)
produce an insoluble glucan (e.g. floridean starch, amylopectin granules, etc.) [15]. Out of the 170 organisms that
we probed, we found that if an organism lacked one of
these qualities then it lacked laforin and if it possessed all
of these qualities then it possessed laforin [15]. Therefore,
Plasmodium species lack laforin because they do not
metabolize insoluble glucans, Cryptosporidium species lack
laforin because they lack true mitochondria, and
Chlamydomonas lack laforin because they are not of redPage 3 of 14

algal descent (and instead have SEX4) [15]. Some of the
genomes that we originally probed were incomplete at the
time. However, based on the above three criteria, we postulated that the following four organisms currently being
sequenced would contain laforin, Galdieria sulphuraria,
Guillardia theta, Neospora caninum, and Sarcocystis neurona
[15].
In light of the relatedness between CBM20 and CBM21
CBMs, we probed 122 protozoan genomes (28 more than
previously) searching for a protein containing a CBM20 or
CBM21 domain followed by a phosphatase domain. In
order to enhance our likelihood of uncovering a laforin
ortholog, we performed BLASTp and tBLASTn searches of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/138

multiple databases (Additional File 1) using human (Hs) and C. merolae (Cm-) laforin, as C. merolae is likely the
most evolutionarily ancient organism with laforin and
Cm-laforin was the least identical (25%) to Hs-laforin of
all the protozoan laforin orthologs previously identified
[15]. To ensure that we did not miss a laforin-like protein
in these genomes, we also searched the same databases
using the same search methods for proteins with a DSP
domain followed by a CBM20 or CBM21, i.e. SEX4
orthologs.
The only novel putative laforin ortholog that we uncovered was in the genome of Neospora caninum, a genome we
predicted would contain laforin [15] (Fig. 2A). N. caninum

laforin (Nc-laforin) was only16% and 23% similar to Cmand Hs-laforin, respectively (Fig. 2B). As we predicted, N.
caninum fulfils our three criteria in that it is of red algal
descent, possesses true mitochondria, and generates insoluble starch in the form of amylopectin granules [32-35].
N. caninum is classified as an alveolate and is a parasite of
canines [36]. N. caninum structurally resembles T. gondii
to such a degree that it was not properly identified until
1988 [37]. Therefore, we aligned the putative Nc-laforin
with T. gondii (Tg)-laforin and found that these proteins
are 82% identical (Fig. 2). In addition, all of the residues
known to be necessary for glucan binding and phosphatase activity in Tg-laforin are conserved in Nc-laforin
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the predicted secondary structure
of Nc-laforin and Tg-laforin are identical and both are
very similar to Hs-laforin (Fig. 2A). Given the degree of
similarity between Nc- and Tg-laforin at the primary and
secondary amino acid level and the fact that we previously
cloned and characterized Tg-laforin [15], Nc-laforin is a
laforin ortholog. This finding confirms the predictive
power of our three criteria in predicting the absence or
presence of laforin in protozoan genomes. We did not
uncover a laforin ortholog in the genomes of G. sulphuraria, G. theta, or S. neurona, but their nuclear genomes
are not complete and we still predict that they do contain
laforin.
Discovery of putative laforin orthologs in invertebrate
genomes
Metazoans are defined as all living animals that contain
tissues and are descended from the last common ancestor
of Bilateria, Cnidaria (jellyfish, sea anemones, corals,
hydra, etc.), Ctenophora (comb jellies), Placozoa (Trichoplax sp.), and Porifera (sponges) [38]. Bilateralians are
subdivided as either protostomes (including arthropods,
nematodes, annelids, and mollusks) or deuterostomes.
The three major deuterstome phyla, chordates, echinoderms (sea urchins, sea stars, etc.), and hemichordates
(acorn worm), arose from a common ancestor more than
600 million years ago, followed by subsequent divergence
of the chordates into three subphyla: cephalochordates,
urochordates (also called tunicates), and vertebrates
(summarized in Additional File 2) [39,40].

The gene encoding laforin is an evolutionarily ancient
gene, originating in a primitive red alga, or its ancestor,
long before the emergence of metazoans [15]. While
laforin is an ancient gene, it has a unique evolutionary lineage. Although we previously identified laforin orthologs
in five protozoan genomes, we did not find it in any nonvertebrate model organism genomes (yeast, fly, or
worms), nor did we find it in the genome of any invertebrates [15]. We postulated that invertebrates lack laforin
because they do not synthesize an insoluble glucan as an
energy source (as do the protozoans that contain laforin)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/138

and they do not inhibit insoluble glucan accumulation
(as seen with vertebrates inhibiting LBs). However, over
the course of the last two years multiple basal position
metazoan genomes have been sequenced or improved
and a surplus of information has been gleaned by the evodevo community from the genomes of Branchiostoma floridae (commonly known as amphioxus, subphylum
cephalochordata), Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt belonging
to urochordates), Monosiga brevicollis (choanoflagellate
and closest known unicellular relative to metazoans),
Nematostella vectensis (sea anemone belonging to the
ancient metazoan Phylum Cnidaria), and Trichoplax
adhaerens (arguably the simplest free-living metazoan,
Phylum Placozoa) [41-45]. While definitive conclusions
concerning the origin and early radiation of these organisms in the metazoan tree of life remain unsettled, these
reports have elucidated multiple aspects of metazoan evolution and the genomes of primitive metazoans regarding
genome complexity, exon-intron structure, gene repertoire, and rates of molecular evolution.
Given these recent advances we performed searches as
described above searching multiple databases (Additional
File 1) for putative laforin orthologs in the genome of 212
eukaryotes (including the 122 protozoan). We identified
putative laforin orthologs in the genome of two invertebrates, the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
and the small worm-like urochordate Branchiostoma floridae (Fig. 3A). The putative N. vectensis laforin (Nv-laforin)
is 44% identical to Hs-laforin and contains all but one of
the known residues conferring glucan binding and phosphatase activity (Fig. 3A &3B). In the B. floridae genome
we discovered three open reading frames that each
encoded a putative laforin ortholog (Fig. 3A). The putative B. floridae laforin (Bf-laforin) orthologs are 29–41%
identical to Hs-laforin and share the majority of residues
important for glucan binding and phosphatase activity
(Fig. 3A &3B). In addition, all four genes encode proteins
that have very similar predicted secondary structure to Hslaforin (Fig. 3A). The predicted secondary structure of the
CBM of Nv-laforin and the Bf-laforins are nearly identical
with Hs-laforin, but have a predicted helix in place of a
coil-coil (Fig. 3A). All four proteins contain the predicted
five β-sheets and six α-helices typical of a dual specificity
phosphatase domain and are identical with Hs-laforin
(Fig. 3A).
To gain insight into the evolution of these putative laforin
orthologs, we analyzed the gene structure and intron-exon
boundaries of each and compared them with the gene
encoding Hs-laforin, EPM2A. EPM2A is comprised of four
exons and three introns (Fig. 3C) [9,10]. Similarly, Bflaforin-264244 has the same arrangement and the intronexon boundaries are at similar locations (Fig. 3C). The
other two putative Bf-laforin orthologs each contain three

exons and two introns. Additionally, exon 1 from these
two Bf-laforins is similar in size to exon 1 and exon 2 of
both Hs-laforin and Bf-laforin-264244, suggesting possible intron loss (Fig. 3C). Finally, Nv-laforin has no
introns, suggesting intron loss and potentially an
increased rate of evolution at this locus in Nematostella.
Accelerated rates of evolution occur in echinoderms, fruit
flies, nematodes, and the sea squirt C. intestinalis [40,4648]. These accelerated rates of evolution result in amino
acid substitution, intron loss, gene loss, and genome rearrangement. Surprisingly, recent studies show that the
genomes of Nematostella and Branchiostoma have evolved
at a rate comparable to or slower than vertebrates [42-44].
These studies generated phylogenies derived from 104
[43], 337 [44], and 1090 [42] single-copy nuclear

encoded genes to estimate rates of molecular evolution.
Their phylogenies showed long branch lengths, indicating
increased sequence divergence, for the genomes of all
organisms investigated except vertebrates, Nematostella,
and Branchiostoma [42-44]. Thus, they concluded that the
genomes of the fly, hydra, nematode, yeast, sea squirt,
sponge, snail, and the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis have
evolved at a more rapid rate (summarized in Table 1). In
addition to primary sequence comparison, these studies
also examined the conservation of introns in various species and found that in alignable regions the genomes of
Nematostella and Branchiostoma share >80% of human
introns [42,44]. Conversely, D. melanogaster, C. elegans,
and C. intestinalis have lost 50–90% of the inferred ancestral metazoan introns [42,44] (summarized in Table 1).
Thus, it is proposed that ancient metazoan genomes more

Rates of molecular evolution are defined in these studies as either substitutions per amino acid and/or position and phase of introns

closely resembled the complexity seen in the human
genome rather than that observed in yeast, flies, or worms
[42-45,49].
The laforin gene in H. sapiens, T. gondii, N. caninum, E. tenella, P. tetraurelia, and B. floridae all contain at least four
exons. Therefore, we propose that the laforin gene originally had four or more exons, and that the introns were
lost in C. merolae and Nematostella. These results suggest
that the laforin gene locus underwent a higher rate of
molecular evolution than genes in Nematostella that share
conserved introns with human genes. This increased
molecular evolution may explain the absence of laforin in
yeast, flies, worms, and the majority of invertebrates as we
discuss below.
Biochemical characterization of Nv- and Bf-laforin
To determine if we had identified true laforin orthologs in
invertebrates, we cloned the genes expressing Nv-laforin
and Bf-laforin-264244 from Nematostella and Branchiostoma, respectively. We previously cloned and characterized Tg-laforin and found that we could only obtain
soluble recombinant Tg-laforin when we added a GST tag
to the amino terminus of Tg-laforin [[20], and unpublished data]. Even with the addition of the GST tag, the
majority of GST-Tg-laforin is insoluble, suggesting that
the majority of the protein does not correctly fold in bacteria. Unlike Hs-laforin but similar to Tg-laforin, both Nvand Bf-laforin were largely insoluble with a HIS6 epitope.
Therefore, we generated bacterial constructs expressing
GST-Nv-laforin-HIS6 and GST-Bf-laforin-HIS6, purified
the recombinant proteins (Additional File 3), and biochemically characterized them.

Characteristic of all dual specificity phosphatases, human
DSP VH1-related (VHR) and Hs-laforin exhibit phosphatase activity against the artificial substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP; Fig. 4A) [12,50]. Both Bf- and
Nv-laforin also utilized p-NPP as an artificial substrate

(Fig. 4A). Bf-laforin exhibited a similar specific activity as
Hs-laforin and SEX4, while the activity of Nv-laforin was
lower and similar to Tg-laforin. The decreased activity of
Nv-laforin is likely due to our difficulty in generating soluble Nv-laforin and suggests that some of the soluble Nv-

laforin may be misfolded, similar to Tg-laforin. Even
though the activity of Nv-laforin is substantially
decreased, it does exhibit phosphatase activity and therefore it is a phosphatase. DSPs act by forming a phosphoenzyme intermediate after nuleophilic attack of the
phosphorus atom of the substrate by a cysteine residue
that is conserved in all DSPs in their signature motif,
HCxxGxxRS (CX5R) [51]. Mutation of this cysteine
renders DSPs catalytically inactive. Therefore, we generated cys/ser (C/S) mutations in Bf- and Nv-laforin to test
if their activity was dependent on this cysteine. As predicted, the Bf- and Nv-laforin C/S mutants displayed no
activity against p-NPP (Fig. 4A). Enzymes generally have a
preferred pH within to act, and DSPs are no different. We
tested the phosphatase activity of Bf- and Nv-laforin at 0.5
unit increments from pH 5–8. While Hs-laforin has a
maximal activity against p-NPP at pH 5, Bf-laforin had a
maximal activity at pH 7 and Nv-laforin at pH 7.5 (Fig.
4B).

Some DSPs dephosphorylate non-proteinaceous substrates, such as phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN), the myotubularin family, and Sac domain phosphatases that all dephosphorylate the inositol head group
of phospholipids [52-56]. We recently discovered that
laforin belongs to a unique class of enzymes that dephosphorylates glucans, namely glycogen and starch, and that
other classes of phosphatases lack this activity [15,21].
Amylopectin is the major component of plant starch and
contains detectable amounts of phosphate [57,58]. Therefore, we tested if Bf- and Nv-laforin could liberate phosphate from amylopectin. Similar to SEX4 and Hs-laforin,
Bf- and Nv-laforin liberated phosphate from amylopectin,
whereas VHR did not hydrolyze phosphate from amylopectin (Fig. 6A). The activity of Bf-laforin was comparable
to the activity of SEX4, and the activity of Nv- and Tglaforin were comparable. Similar to the p-NPP data, the
activity of Bf- and Nv-laforin against amylopectin was also
pH dependent (Fig. 6B).

Since laforin is the only phosphatase in any Kingdom Animalia genome with a CBM, it is predicted to be the only
phosphatase that binds carbohydrates. Bf- and Nv-laforin
bound amylopectin to the same extent as Hs-laforin (Fig.
5). Conversely, VHR, which lacks a CBM, did not bind
amylopectin (Fig. 5). Dixon and colleagues previously
demonstrated that conserved tryptophan and lysine residues (marked with asterisks in Fig. 3) that participate in
binding to the sugar are necessary for Hs-laforin to bind
amylopectin (Fig. 5) [13]. Accordingly, mutation of these
corresponding residues in Bf-laforin (W29 and K69) and
Nv-laforin (W31 and K76) also abolished their ability to
bind amylopectin (Fig. 5).

Bf- and Nv-laforin possess the same three in vitro biochemical properties as Hs-laforin: both utilize p-NPP as

an artificial substrate, bind amylopectin, and liberate
phosphate from amylopectin. Additionally, the invertebrate laforin orthologs contain the critical signature primary amino acids of both a CBM20 and DSP, and they
possess the same predicted secondary structure as Hslaforin. Thus, our bioinformatics searches for a protein
containing a CBM and DSP correctly predicted the proteins biochemical properties and we identified novel
laforin orthologs. Our finding of laforin orthologs in two
invertebrate genomes reinforces the global function of
this protein and yields insights into the evolution of this
gene family.
Evolutionary lineage of glucan phosphatases
As discussed above, we previously reported that laforin is
not confined to vertebrate genomes, but it is also conserved in five protozoan genomes [15]. The gene encoding
laforin is conserved in species as divergent as humans and
red algae, but it is absent in the vast majority of protozoan
and invertebrate genomes. SEX4 is conserved in diverse
members of Archaeplastida/Kingdom Plantae and is necessary for proper starch metabolism in Arabidopsis
[15,19,20]. These findings suggest that laforin and SEX4
are ancient proteins that regulate an aspect of energy
metabolism conserved in multiple kingdoms, namely the
dephosphorylation of glycogen and starch.

We previously postulated that throughout evolution
organisms maintained or lost laforin depending on their
"need" to manage insoluble glucans [15]. We suggested
that protists with laforin maintained it to manage insoluble glucans as an energy source [15]. Similarly, vertebrates
maintained laforin because of their "need" to combat
Lafora body accumulation and used this reasoning to
explain why the genome of most metazoans (i.e. animals)
lack laforin [20]. However, it is also possible that vertebrate genomes have laforin as a result of horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) from a protist.
To further investigate the evolutionary heritage of laforin
and SEX4 we generated a phylogeny of all laforin and
SEX4 orthologs. We identified full-length laforin
orthologs in fifteen vertebrate genomes (encompassing all
five classes), two invertebrate genomes, and six protozoan
genomes (Fig. 7A). Additionally, we found multiple
laforin paralogs in the genomes of B. floridae, T. thermophila, and P. tetraurelia. The laforin paralogs have an
array of intron-exon numbers and boundaries, from a single exon to similar numbers (4 exons) and boundaries as
Hs-laforin to as many as eight exons (Fig. 3C & Additional
File 4). Gene duplication and intron gain and loss are all
indicative of increased molecular evolution, suggesting
that the laforin locus in these organisms has experienced
increased evolutionary pressures. Among the protists, the
Apicomplexa laforin orthologs rooted much closer to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/138

invertebrates and vertebrates than did the Ciliate laforin
orthologs (Fig. 7A). The Apicomplexa genomes all contain a single ortholog, while the two Ciliates both contain
three. Both of these results argue for an increased rate of
evolutionary drift in the Ciliates at the laforin locus. The
alveolates that have laforin (see Fig. 1C) all contain at
least four exons and three introns, thus agreeing with
reports from the Koonin laboratory demonstrating
increased intron-rich genes in alveolates [59].
In searching for SEX4 orthologs, we identified full-length
orthologs in fourteen genomes, encompassing trees, land
plants, a moss (Physcomitrella patens), and a single-cell
green alga (Fig. 7B). In addition, we identified several partial cDNA or protein hits of SEX4 orthologs in other
Archaeplastida (data not shown). These results demonstrate that SEX4 is conserved in all branches of Archaeplastida/Kingdom Plantae and highlight the importance
of this glucan phosphatase throughout Archaeplastida.
Our finding of laforin in two invertebrate genomes raises
questions regarding the evolutionary lineage of laforin in
metazoans/animals. It is possible that the unique evolutionary lineage of laforin was a result of HGT from a protozoan or its ancestor. If so, this event occurred earlier
than the radiation of metazoans because laforin is conserved in two invertebrate genomes, including the Cnidarian Nematostella.
An alternative hypothesis, and one that we favour, postulates that in non-protozoan genomes the absence or presence of laforin was determined by rates of molecular
evolution and the need to combat insoluble glucans,
while in protists conservation of laforin is determined by
the three criteria previously presented and discussed [15].
This hypothesis seems likely given recent reports showing
the rate of molecular evolution in Branchiostoma and
Nematostella is similar to that of vertebrates and the rate is
much higher in other invertebrates, as discussed above
(Table 1).
This hypothesis calls into question why laforin has been
conserved. Invertebrates may not need laforin because
they have significantly shorter lifespans than vertebrates.
In support of this thought, the only cellular pathology
observed in LD patients is neuronal apoptosis [3]. Since
neurons live longer than most all other cell types, it seems
plausible that invertebrates may be more like skin cells (or
other cell types with shorter lifespans); they accumulate
LBs but not to a detrimental state. Thus, laforin may represent a vestigial gene or perhaps a pseudogene in Nematostella and Branchiostoma.
Alternatively, Nematostella and Branchiostoma may have
laforin for a purpose. Vertebrates do not utilize insoluble

glucans as an energy source, but they do "combat" the
accumulation of insoluble glucans, in the form of detrimental LBs. We know that many, if not all, vertebrate species suffer from LD (including, canines, felines, cattle, and
birds) [60-64]. It is possible that Nematostella and Branchiostoma also have laforin in order to combat LBs.
Lastly, Nematostella and Branchiostoma may have laforin
because their genomes have not evolved as rapidly as
other invertebrates, as has been recently demonstrated,
and thus still have/need laforin [42,44]. If this is the case,
other invertebrates (e.g flies and worms) may not need

laforin because they have evolved a separate means to deal
with LB-like accumulations.

Conclusion
Regardless of what has driven the evolutionary lineage of
laforin, these results define the boundaries of glucan
phosphatase conservation. These findings coupled with
our previous work establish the conservation of laforin
and SEX4 in evolutionary niches from protozoans to
plants to algae to vertebrates and now invertebrates. Notably, laforin and SEX4 are absent in bacteria and archaea.
While these groups do contain each domain that is found
in glucan phosphatases (i.e. a phosphatase domain and

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:138

carbohydrate binding domain), no protein in their
genomes contains both. Given the completeness of bacterial genomes, it is unlikely that a glucan phosphatase
exists in bacteria. Therefore, we suspect that we have identified the complete evolutionary lineage of the glucan
phosphatases laforin and SEX4. The conservation of
laforin across evolutionary niches, coupled with what
appears to be complete conservation of SEX4 throughout
all Archaeplastida/Kingdom Plantae demonstrate that
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of glucans is pervasive throughout nature.

Methods
Plasmids and Proteins
Wild type and C/S Hs-laforin in pET21a (Novagen, San
Diego, CA) for use in bacterial expression were described
previously [13,65]. Recombinant HIS-tagged VHR cloning
and purification have been previously described [21]. The
complete open reading frame of Bf-laforin-264224 was
amplified from cDNA provided by the Branchiostoma floridea Gene Collection [66]. The complete open reading
frame of Nv-laforin was amplified from Nematostella DNA
provided by Dr. Mark Q. Martindale. Bf- and Nv-laforin
were cloned into pET-GSTX and pET21a, respectively [67].
Mutations were introduced using QuickChange (Stratagene). Recombinant GST- and His-tagged proteins were
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL
cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using Ni2+agarose (Qiagen, Germany) and/or glutathione-agarose
affinity chromatography steps as described previously
[68].
Phosphatase Activity Assays
Hydrolysis of para-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) was
performed in 50 μl reactions containing 1X phosphate
buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.05 M bis-Tris, 0.05 M TrisHCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, at the appropriate pH), 50 mM
pNPP, and 100–500 ng of enzyme at 37°C for 5–30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200
μl of 0.25 M NaOH and absorbance was measured at 410
nm. We tested the specific activity of each enzyme at pH
5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Malachite green assays
were performed as described [69] with the following
modifications: 1X phosphate buffer, 100–500 ng of
enzyme, and ≈45 μg of amylopectin in a final volume of
20 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl
of 0.1 M N-ethylmaleimide and 80 μl of malachite green
reagent. Absorbance was measured after 30 minutes at
620 nm. We tested the specific activity of each enzyme at
the same pH units as above.
Carbohydrate binding Assay
Carbohydrate binding assays were done similarly as
described previously [13]. Briefly, 50 mg of amylopectin
was dissolved in 400 μl of ethanol, followed by the addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/138

tion of 1 ml of water and 1 ml of 2 M NaOH, 2 ml of water
was added, pH was adjusted to 6.5, and the total volume
was brought to 10 ml. 1 ml of 5 mg/ml amylopectin was
centrifuged at 50 K for 1.5 hours, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) with protease inhibitors,
0.5 μg of recombinant protein was added, the tube was
rotated at 4°C for 1 hour, a second centrifugation was preformed at 50 K for 1.5 hours, the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with acetone, and the pellet was
resuspended in Western loading dye. Potato amylopectin
was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant
proteins were detected with α-HIS-horeseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Santa Cruz) and SuperSignal West
Pico (Pierce).
Search strategy, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic
analyses
The sequences of laforin and SEX4 orthologs were
obtained by performing tBLASTn searches using the GenBank "dbEST" database or BLASTp and PSI-BLAST [70]
searches using GenBank "eukaryote genome" and "nonredundant" (nr) databases, the Cyanidioschyzon merolae
genome project, Department of Energy Joint Genome
Institute Resource, The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR), ToxoDB, GeneDB, Genoscope, UCSC Genome
Browser, Tetrahymena Genome Database, and multiple
organism specific databases. Accession numbers for small
subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA), SEX4 orthologs,
and laforin orthologs are listed in Additional File 5, 6, and
8, respectively. The web address for each database is listed
in Additional File 4. A list of each genome that we investigated and a reason why an organism's genome lacks
laforin is listed in Additional File 7. Amino-acid
sequences of laforin orthologs were aligned by ClustalW
[71] and refined manually using MacVector. SSU rRNA
sequences were obtained by performing BLASTn using
GenBank from "all organisms" and "nr" databases and
accession numbers are listed in Additional File 5. Phylogenetic trees were generated from a ClustalW [71] multiple sequence alignment using PROTDIST and FITCH from
the PHYLIP 3.65 software package and displayed utilizing
HYPERTREE 1.0.0 [72].
