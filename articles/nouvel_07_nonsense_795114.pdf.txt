Abstract
Background: Previous studies have suggested that variations in DNA repair genes of W-Beijing
strains may have led to transient mutator phenotypes which in turn may have contributed to host
adaptation of this strain family. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DNA repair gene
mutT1 was identified in MDR-prone strains from the Central African Republic. A
Mycobacteriumtuberculosis H37Rv mutant inactivated in two DNA repair genes, namely ada/alkA and
ogt, was shown to display a hypermutator phenotype. We then looked for polymorphisms in these
genes in Central African Republic strains (CAR).
Results: In this study, 55 MDR and 194 non-MDR strains were analyzed. Variations in DNA repair
genes ada/alkA and ogt were identified. Among them, by comparison to M. tuberculosis published
sequences, we found a non-sense variation in ada/alkA gene which was also observed in M. bovis
AF2122 strain. SNPs that are present in the adjacent regions to the amber variation are different
in M. bovis and in M. tuberculosis strain.
Conclusion: An Amber codon was found in the ada/alkA locus of clustered M. tuberculosis isolates
and in M. bovis strain AF2122. This is likely due to convergent evolution because SNP differences
between strains are incompatible with horizontal transfer of an entire gene. This suggests that such
a variation may confer a selective advantage and be implicated in hypermutator phenotype
expression, which in turn contributes to adaptation to environmental changes.

Background
With more than 2 million deaths a year, tuberculosis (TB)
remains a major public health problem. As one-third of
the world's population is infected, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is probably the most widespread human pathogen
and the number of TB cases is growing at a rate of 2% per

year [1]. This bacterium is remarkably well-adapted to its
host, in which it can persist for years without inducing
symptoms. Despite its worldwide dissemination and presence in diverse host populations, the genetic variability of
M. tuberculosis appears to be very low with the exception

of hot spot regions in the genome that are associated with
mobile elements [2-5].

other strains and considered to be characteristic of Haarlem strains [6,12].

Previous studies on W-Beijing family strains have identified variations in putative DNA repair genes (mutT2,
mutT4 and ogt). These variations are found only in the WBeijing family; they can therefore be considered to be specific markers of this family and suggest that a mutator
phenotype, at least transient, may have contributed to the
host adaptation of this family of strains [6].

Nine strains carry an ACT→AAT (Thr337→Asn) variation,
and five of these strains also display a TGG→TAG
(Trp79→AMBER) variation. This is the first report of a variant involving a nonsense codon in M. tuberculosis. This
raised the question of whether such variations also
occurred in non-MDR strains.

Durbach et al. [7] co-inactivated DNA repair genes,
namely ada/alkA and ogt, in strain H37Rv and showed that
the resulting mutant displayed a mutator phenotype
under nitrosative stress.
While studying the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates in the Central African Republic (CAR), we described
an MDR-prone family characterized by a T family spoligotype and a synonymous variation in the DNA repair gene
mutT1 [8]. This prompted us to screen our set of welldefined isolates from CAR [8,9] by sequencing putative
anti-mutator genes including ada/alkA to identify other
variations that could be markers of relevant clinical
strains.
Comparisons of CAR strain sequences with published "M.
tuberculosis complex" genome sequences revealed an SNP
common to these strains and M. bovis strain AF2122. This
suggests either horizontal DNA transfer between M. bovis
and M. tuberculosis CAR strains or convergent evolution.
Medigue et al. and Denamur et al. [10,11] demonstrated
horizontal transfer of DNA repair genes in E. coli. To determine whether there has been transfer between M. bovis
and M. tuberculosis strains, we looked at polymorphism in
the regions upstream and downstream from this common
SNP by PCR sequencing. We provide evidence that this
SNP may have occurred twice independently and might
therefore be an example of convergent evolution.

Results
Variations in the ada/alkA and ogt genes in a series of
MDR isolates
Variations in ada/alkA and ogt genes were assessed in fiftyfive MDR strains collected between 1993 and 2001 in
CAR. PCR products corresponding to ada/alkA and those
corresponding to ogt were obtained for each MDR CAR
strain in our collection. Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed four variations in DNA repair genes: one in
ogt and three in ada/alkA (table 1).

The ogt variant is a C to G substitution causing the replacement of a Threonine by a Serine at position 15 in Ogt,
noted A CC→A GC (Thr15→Ser). This variation is carried
by three CAR isolates. It has been previously observed in

Polymorphism of ada/alkA in a series of non-MDR strains
(Table 1)
Using the same sequencing approach, we searched for the
presence of the nonsense variation TGG→TAG
(Trp79→AMBER) and other ada/alkA or ogt polymorphisms in a set of 194 well-defined non-MDR strains isolated in CAR between April 15th and August 15th 1998
from the cohort studied by Espinal et al. [9]: 138 of these
isolates were found to carry sequence variations (Table 1).
Twenty-four of the strains carry the ACT→AAT
(Thr337→Asn) variation, including three that also carry
the TGG→TAG (Trp79→AMBER).

We searched ada/alkA sequences in available "M. tuberculosis complex" genome sequences and found the
TGG→TAG (Trp79→AMBER) variation in M. bovis strain
AF2122. The spoligotypes of the CAR isolates with the
TGG→TAG (Trp79→AMBER) variation indicate that they
are Haarlem M. tuberculosis strains. This suggests that this
Amber mutation has occurred independently in at least
two different species of the "M. tuberculosis complex" or
that it has been acquired by horizontal DNA transfer. To
test these possibilities, we studied the polymorphisms of
chromosomal regions flanking the TGG→TAG
(Trp79→AMBER) ada/alkA SNP.
We compared regions flanking the Amber variation in M.
tuberculosis strains including (I) CAR isolates carrying the
Thr337→Asn variation with or without the Amber variant, (II) H37Rv, (III) CDC1551 and (IV) W-Beijing 210
and in M. bovis strains including (V) RCA isolates, (VI)
strain AF2122 and (VII) BCG Pasteur. In addition to the
ada/alkA gene variations previously found in MDR CAR
strains, we identified two further SNPs affecting the ada/
alkA coding sequence: GCG→ACG (Ala11→Thr) only
found in W-Beijing210 and CTG→CTA (Leu269→Leu)
harboured by M. bovis AF2122 and BCG Pasteur. We also
found six SNPs outside of the ada/alkA coding sequence:
SNP1, SNP2 and SNP3 downstream from ada/alkA, and
SNP4, SNP5 and SNP6 upstream from the gene (table 2).
SNPs 2, 4, 5 and 6 were found in all strains except in
H37Rv. SNP1 and the ATC→GTC (Ile12→Val) variation
were found in all M. bovis strains but not in any CAR isolates of M. tuberculosis. The CTG→CTA (Leu269→Leu)
variation is present only in M. bovis AF2122 and BCG Pas-

teur and SNP3 only in M. bovis AF2122. In contrast, CAR
M. tuberculosis Amber variants also harbour the ACT→AAT
(Thr337→Asn) variation and do not carry SNP1 or SNP3,
or codon 12 and 269 modifications. Therefore, DNA polymorphisms identified in CAR M. tuberculosis Amber variant isolates differ from those observed in M. bovis strain
AF2122 (Table 2). This is not compatible with the occurrence of the Amber variation in both groups being a consequence of horizontal transfer and allelic replacement of
the entire ada/alkA gene. It is therefore more likely that
independent events are responsible for the appearance of
this variation in the two species, thus suggesting convergent evolution.
Spoligotypes of M. tuberculosis strains and relatedness
Spoligotyping of all these CAR isolates has been reported
in Nouvel et al. [8]. Spoligotype clusters were named by
their Shared Type number according to the spoligotype
database SpolDB3 [13]. We considered the distribution of
CAR Amber variant isolates among the clusters. They were
found in three different clusters: (I) "ST047" (composed
of 50 strains of which only one carries the Amber variation), "ST316 minus spacer 13" (five strains, all carrying
the Amber variant, four of them being MDR) and "ST316"
(22 strains, two carrying the Amber variation). The
ACT→AAT (Thr337→Asn) variation alone (not associated
with the Amber variant) is present in strains of clusters
"ST047", "ST316", "ST312" and "ST312 minus spacers
42–43". These clusters share 93.47 to 98.4% spoligotype
identity (Figure 1) and could reasonably be considered as
a single family.

Discussion
In our collection of CAR isolates, the ada/alkA gene variant
ACT→AAT (Thr337→Asn) was found in 16 isolates, eight of
which also carry the TGG→TAG (Trp79→AMBER) variation.
This suggests that the ACT→AAT (Thr337→Asn) mutation
appeared before the TGG→TAG (Trp79→AMBER) mutation.
Moreover, strains carrying only the ACT→AAT
(Thr337→Asn) variation show spoligopatterns "ST047",
"ST312", "ST314", "ST316", "ST312 without spacers 42–
43", or "ST314 without spacers 39". Strains carrying both
(Thr337→Asn)
and
TGG→TAG
ACT→AAT
(Trp79→AMBER) belong to "ST047", "ST316" or "ST316
without spacer 13". All these Shared Types are similar and
differ by a small number of spacers. The spoligopatterns
of these 16 strains classify them into the Haarlem family
(similar to ST047). However, the strains with ACT→AAT
(Thr337→Asn) variation with or without the TGG→TAG
(Trp79→AMBER) variation do not carry variations in ogt:
this suggests they are all derived from an ancient Haarlem
family strain before the appearance of the ogt variants. We
propose a genealogy of strains showing a Haarlem spoligotype and carrying the Amber variation in the ada/alkA
gene (Figure 2). Further studies will be necessary to assess
whether these strains are an emerging cluster in CAR.
The Amber variation in ada/alka is also found in M. bovis
strain AF2122. This Amber variation is absent from the
two M. bovis strains isolated in CAR analysed in this study
(identified as M. bovis by biochemical tests and confirmed

by spoligotyping). It is also absent from the M. bovis BCG
Pasteur strain. Denamur et al. [11] demonstrated horizontal transfer of DNA repair genes between E. coli strains and
showed that this led to the appearance of mutator phenotypes. Our SNP analysis of the ada/alkA DNA region
excludes this possibility for the Amber variation. All M.
tuberculosis strains carrying the Amber variant in our study
population harbour the same SNPs; these SNPs are different from those found in M. bovisAF2122. This argues
strongly against horizontal transfer of a region comprising
the entire ada/alka gene. Therefore, the Amber variation
probably occurred more than once independently and
thus constitutes a case of convergent evolution. The acquisition of this variation may confer a selective advantage on
the strain.
In several bacteria, the Ada and AlkA proteins are encoded
by two distinct genes. The putative ada/alkA gene of M.
tuberculosis is similar to the ada and alkA genes of E. coli,
and is likely to be a fusion of the two genes [14]. Interestingly, the non-sense mutation we described in CAR isolates and in M. bovis AF2122 affects the Ada part of the
gene. Presumably, the Amber mutation inactivates the

ada/alkA fused gene and results in a mutator phenotype.
Indeed, inactivation of this gene results in an increased
mutation frequency in M. tuberculosis without any growth
impairment in vivo [7]. Thus, the naturally occurring ada/
alkA mutants we report here may have the advantage of a
high mutation rate without any associated cost in vivo.
Alternatively, the production of a truncated Ada protein
may constitutively activate adaptive responses, as has
been demonstrated in E. coli [15]. In particular, it may
provide an improved response to stress in vivo, for
instance in the phagosome of activated macrophages [16].

Conclusion
An Amber stop-codon in ada/alkA was detected in some
M. tuberculosis Haarlem isolates from CAR and also in M.
bovis strain AF2122. This Amber variation appears not to
have spread by horizontal gene transfer; this could be a
case of convergent evolution between M. tuberculosis and
M. bovis. This suggested that acquisition of the variation
may confer a selective advantage. The ada/alkA genetic
locus of M. tuberculosis has been implicated in mutator
phenotype expression [7]. The variant we report may
therefore contribute to adaptation to environmental

from the cohort studied by Espinal et al. [9] for which a
subculture was obtained (192 M. tuberculosis and 2 M.
bovis strains). Spoligotyping, a method for typing strains
of M. tuberculosis complex, was performed as previously
described [2,17]. Spoligopatterns are identified by Shared
Type number (ST) according to spolDB3 nomenclature
[13].
Sequences of ada/alkA and ogt
Primers were designed to amplify putative mut genes: ogt
(5'-CAGCGCTCGCTGGCGCC
-3',
5'-GACTCAGCCGCTCGCGA-3'), and ada/alkA (5'-AGCCGCGTAGGTAACCT-3', 5'-TGCTCGAGCATCCGCAG-3') and
(5'-CGCATGCAGACCGCCCG-3',
5'-CACTGCACGTTGCCGAC-3').

DNA sequences of the amplified fragments were determined directly by using the dideoxy chain-termination
method with the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf,
France) on a GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
system9600 (Perkin Elmer) and run on a DNA analysis
system model3100 (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences of genes from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, MT210
and CDC1551, and M. bovis AF2122 were obtained from
published sequences [14,18,19] available on the TIGR
web site [20].
Computer-assisted analysis of dendrograms
Autoradiographs were scanned, and the resulting spoligotype data for each mycobacterial isolate was analysed
using the Windows version of the computer-assisted
BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Kortrijik, Belgium). Each positive spot was defined as a band. The software then clustered strains with the same spoligotyping
patterns. Dendrograms were constructed for the spoligotypes according to degree of similitude (Dice's coefficient)
and comparison with known spoligotypes [13,21,22].

Comparison of regions flanking ada/alkA
A 20 kb DNA region comprising the ada/alkA coding
sequence in M. tuberculosis H37Rv was aligned with the
corresponding regions in M. bovis AF2122 [19], M. tuberculosis CDC1551, and M. tuberculosis MT210 to identify
variations: 9 SNPs were found. Primers were designed to
correspond to these sequences (as described above). M.
tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis BCG Pasteur and 16 strains
from Bangui (including 2 M. bovis strains according to
biochemical and spoligotyping markers) were sequenced
for these SNPs. A DNA parsimony analysis was used to
generate a phylogenetic tree.
