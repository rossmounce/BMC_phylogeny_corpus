Abstract
Background: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a human pathogen that is a common cause of communityacquired pneumonia. It harbours a large number of lipoprotein genes, most of which are of
unknown function. Because of their location on the cell surface, these proteins are likely to be
involved in the bacterial response to environmental changes, or in the initial stages of infection. The
aim of this study was to determine if genes encoding surface lipoproteins are differentially
expressed after contact with a human cell line, or after exposure to oxidative or acidic stress.
Results: Using qRT-PCR assays, we observed that the expression of a number of lipoprotein genes
was up-regulated when M. pneumoniae was placed in contact with human cells. In contrast,
lipoprotein expression was generally down-regulated or unchanged when exposed to either
hydrogen peroxide or low pH (5.5). When exposed to low pH, the mRNA levels of four
polycistronically transcribed genes in Lipoprotein Multigene Family 6 formed a gradient of
decreasing quantity with increasing distance from a predicted promoter.
Conclusion: The demonstrated transcriptional changes provide evidence for the functionality of
these mostly unassigned genes and indicate that they are regulated in response to changes in
environmental conditions. In addition we have shown that the members of Lipoprotein Gene
Family 6 may be expressed polycistronically.

Background
Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common
causes of community acquired pneumonia [1]. It is
thought to be an extracellular pathogen that colonizes the
surface of epithelial cells, although there are reports suggesting that it is capable of invading host cells [2,3]. Mycoplasmas lack a cell wall, and, hence, their membranebound proteins are exposed to the external environment

and to their host's immune response. In spite of their
apparent vulnerability to immune responses, they establish chronic infections.
The M. pneumoniae genome has a high proportion of
genes predicted to encode lipoproteins (6.68% of all
genes) and 67 of these are members of six lipoprotein
gene families [4,5]. A full description of these gene fami-

lies, including their genomic locations, has been published previously [5]. The functionality of these genes is
unknown, but because their products are cell surface proteins they could potentially play a role in adhesion and/or
the initial stages of infection. The members of Lipoprotein
Gene Family 2 are homologs of an M. hyopneumoniae lipoprotein located immediately upstream of a conserved ABC
transport operon containing an exonuclease [6]. Little is
known about general stress responses in M. pneumoniae,
with only one study exploring the effects of heat shock [7],
and another reporting changes in the global protein synthesis pattern in response to the presence of glycerol [8].
It has been suggested that the genome lacks many of the
transcriptional regulators found in other bacteria. For
example, no two-component regulatory system and only
one sigma factor has been identified [4,9]. Hence, the
extent of transcriptional regulation and the mechanisms
involved remain largely unknown in this organism.
Understanding the changes in lipoprotein gene expression in response to different environmental conditions is
an important first step in elucidating the possible functions of these genes and their transcriptional regulation in
M. pneumoniae. Genes that are regulated after contact with
host cells or under oxidative stress may play an important
role in pathogenesis. In this study we used quantitative
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays
(qRT-PCR) and a cell culture model employing the
human lung carcinoma epithelial cell line A549 to examine changes in lipoprotein gene expression in M. pneumoniae in response to association with host cells. The A549
cell line has been used in previous studies of adhesion,
infection or internalization by M. pneumoniae [3,10-12].
We also investigated changes in lipoprotein gene expression after oxidative stress or exposure to low pH, mimicking host defence mechanisms the bacteria may encounter
upon infection. In total, 28 genes were chosen as representative of all lipoprotein genes and their response to
changes in environmental conditions was investigated
(Table 1). These 28 genes were selected to include at least
one full-length ORF from each phylogenic group within
the lipoprotein gene families [5].

Methods
Bacterial strain and culture conditions
M. pneumoniae strain M129 was cultured in 150 cm2 tissue
culture flasks (Falcon, Becton Dickinson) in Modified
Hayflick Medium [15] supplemented with 20% horse
serum (Sigma H-1138) at 37°C until a colour change was
seen in the medium (1–2 days).
The human cell line and culture conditions
The human lung cell line A549 was initially grown in
flasks at 37°C in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 mM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/124

sodium hydrogen carbonate, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and
ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The cells were subsequently cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates at 37°C in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
5% FCS, 44 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) in 5% CO2/air, or in Leibovitz's L15
medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 10 mM HEPES (pH
7.4) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) in air.
Infection model
M. pneumoniae M129 cultured in a 150 cm2 cell culture
flask were scraped from the plastic into MEM supplemented with 100 U penicillin/ml. The suspension was
passed through a 27-gauge needle to separate the cells.

Two millilitres of fresh MEM containing 5% FCS was
added to the wells containing confluent cultures of A549
cells and 250 μl of the mycoplasma suspension was added
to each well (an approximate multiplicity of infection of
100). As a control, the mycoplasma suspension was added
to a well containing MEM supplemented with 5% FCS but
not cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 15 min,
30 min, 1 h or 2 h. All time points were chosen to be less
than the doubling time for M. pneumoniae to ensure that
replication did not affect interpretation of the assay. Following incubation the medium was removed and the
wells were washed twice with 2 ml of PBS at 37°C to
remove non-adherent mycoplasmas. A 600 μl volume of
RLT buffer (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) was added to each well
and the cells were collected using a cell scraper. The cell
lysate was passed through a 20-gauge needle at least 5
times and RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit as
per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was eluted in 50
μl of DEPC-treated water and stored at -70°C. Three independent experiments were carried out, each containing
three biological replicates.
H2O2 stress test
M. pneumoniae M129 was cultured in 25 cm2 cell culture
flasks. The cells were then incubated for 10 min in Modified Hayflick Medium at 37°C supplemented with 1 mM
or 20 mM H2O2. No H2O2 was added to the negative control. The medium was discarded and RNA was isolated as
described above. This experiment was repeated four times.
Low pH stress test
M. pneumoniae M129 was cultured in 25 cm2 cell culture
flasks. The cells were then incubated for 10 min in Modified Hayflick Medium, with the pH adjusted to 5.5 or 7.4
(control) at 37°C. The medium was discarded and RNA
was isolated as described above. This experiment was
repeated three times.

DNase treatment of RNA
RNA was treated with DNase prior to RT-PCR. A 15 μl
aliquot of RNA was treated with 2 U of RNase-free DNase
I (Novagen) in a final volume of 25 μl at 37°C for 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mM
EDTA to a final concentration of 4.5 mM, followed by
incubation at 70°C for 5 minutes.

42°C, and then 2 min at 94°C. The cDNA was diluted
1:10 with distilled water and used as template for qPCR.
As a control for detecting possible DNA contamination in
samples, a duplicate reverse transcription reaction for
each sample was performed without the addition of AMVRT. The control reactions were treated identically to samples in the subsequent dilution step and in qPCR.

Reverse transcription
Reverse transcription was carried out by incubating 0.5 μl
random primers (3 μg/μl, Invitrogen), 1 μl dNTPs (10 nM
each) and 10 μl DNase-treated RNA at 65°C for 10 minutes, and then adding 2.5 μl 10× reaction buffer (F-570B,
Finnzymes), 0.5 μl RNase inhibitor (RNAguard, Amersham Biosciences), 0.5 μl AMV-RT (F-570S, Finnzymes)
and DEPC-treated water to a final volume of 25 μl. The
reaction was incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C, 30 min at

Quantitative PCR
The qPCR reactions were carried out using a Stratagene
MX3000P® System and Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) chemistry. Expression ratios
were calculated using REST 2005 [16]. Reactions consisted
of 1× Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG containing the ROX reference dye at a final concentration of
50 nM, 0.75 μM forward primer, 0.75 μM reverse primer,
5 μl of template and distilled water to a final volume of 20

μl. The reactions were incubated at 50°C for 2 min, then
95°C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 60°C
for 30 s. Melting curve analysis was performed at the end
of the amplification.
The qPCR efficiency for each primer pair was determined
by running a tenfold dilution series in triplicate using
M129 genomic DNA as template, at concentrations ranging from 0.5 pg to 5 ng per reaction, covering a cycle
threshold (CT) range from approximately 15 to 30. The
specificity of each primer pair was confirmed by melting
curve analysis and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis
of qPCR products. All primer pairs produced a PCR product with a single peak in melting curve analyses and a single band after gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide primer
sequences used in this study are provided in Table 1.
Three housekeeping genes, for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap, also known as MPN430),
elongation factor Tu (tuf, also known as MPN665) and
DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB, also known as MPN003),
were validated in an adhesion assay by ensuring that the
relative expression of each gene remained constant before
and after contact of M. pneumoniae M129 cells with A549
cells. Two housekeeping genes were used for normalisation when analysing H2O2-treated samples, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap or MPN430) and
elongation factor Tu (tuf or MPN665). The expression of
gyrB was not stable after exposure to H2O2. The expression
of all three housekeeping genes was stable after exposure
to low pH, so all three genes were used for normalisation
of low pH stress samples.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of qPCR data was carried out using the
randomisation test included in REST 2005 [16]. A P value
of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Several lipoprotein genes were up-regulated after
mycoplasma contact with human A549 cells
In total, six different genes in four distinct lipoprotein
gene families were significantly up-regulated in M. pneumoniae after binding to A549 cells for 2 hours: MPN588 in
lipoprotein Family 1; MPN199 and MPN200 in Family 2;
MPN456 in Family 4; and MPN011 and MPN411 in Family 5 (Table 2). Of these genes, only MPN456 has
sequence similarity to a gene of known function. BlastX
analysis detected 61% identity with a homolog of a predicted component of a predicted oligopeptide ABC transport system (COG4166) in M. genitalium G-37 [5]. All of
these genes appeared to be up-regulated after 15 min, 30
min and 1 h of incubation (see Additional file 1: Change
in lipoprotein gene expression in M. pneumoniae after

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/124

binding to A549 cells), although these results were not
statistically significant.
Two lipoprotein genes were down-regulated in response to
hydrogen peroxide
Two lipoprotein genes, MPN489 in Family 3 and
MPN639 in Family 6, were down-regulated when mycoplasma cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with 20 mM H2O2 (Table 2). In addition, several
genes in Family 2, MPN408, MPN200 and MPN152,
MPN436 in Family 3, MPN012 and MPN505 in Family 5,
and MPN646, MPN647 and MPN641 in Family 6
appeared to be down-regulated, although the results were
not statistically significant. The lower concentration of
H2O2 (1 mM) had no significant effect on lipoprotein
gene expression (see Additional file 2: Change in lipoprotein gene expression in M. pneumoniae after exposure to 1
mM H2O2 for 10 minutes).
Three lipoprotein genes were down-regulated after acid
stress
Three genes in Family 2, MPN408, MPN200 and
MPN152, were significantly down-regulated after the cells
were exposed to pH 5.5 for ten minutes (Table 2). Interestingly, after low pH stress, the relative mRNA concentrations of four consecutive genes in Family 6, MPN647,
MPN646, MPN645 and MPN644, formed a decreasing
gradient (R2 = 0.997). By employing oligonucleotides
bridging adjacent ORFs in RT-PCR, these genes were
shown to be polycistronically expressed (see Additional
file 3: Four consecutive genes in Family 6, MPN647,
MPN646, MPN645 and MPN644 are polycistronically
expressed as shown by RT-PCR).
Family 2 had the most diverse expression profiles under
different environmental conditions
MPN200 in Family 2 was the only gene affected by more
than one of the environmental conditions tested. This
gene was up-regulated after contact with A549 cells and
down-regulated after exposure to low pH.

Discussion
In this study we report transcriptional changes in the
expression of M. pneumoniae lipoprotein genes in
response to contact with human epithelial cells in vitro,
and provide further evidence of transcriptional regulation
in mycoplasmas in response to environmental conditions
[7,17-19]. We chose qRT-PCR as the method to study
changes in gene expression. Although microarray and
qRT-PCR results generally correlate well, both oligonucleotide and cDNA arrays have a tendency to underestimate
the fold-change ratios of the underlying mRNAs compared to qRT-PCR [14]. Thus, qRT-PCR is more sensitive
in detecting smaller changes in gene expression [13].

The hydrogen peroxide concentrations used in this study
were chosen to have a minimal impact on cell viability,
based on unpublished studies by Zimmermann and Herrmann [20]. A pH of 5.5 was used in the acidic stress test
and was chosen to be below the pH of exhaled breath concentrate (pH 6.4) [21] but above the pH of 4.8 found in
lysosomes. In this study mycoplasma cells were exposed
to low pH or hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes before
changes in gene expression were measured. Similar hydrogen peroxide treatment times have been used previously
in gene expression studies of M. pneumoniae [7,20] and
Haemophilus influenzae [22]. In our cell culture infection
model we allowed the mycoplasma cells to be in contact

with eukaryotic cells for 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. This
timeframe was chosen to investigate changes in gene
expression during the initial stages of infection, but prior
to any replication.
Global transcriptional changes in M. pneumoniae after
heat shock have been studied using microarray technology [7]. Forty-seven genes were up-regulated after heat
shock at 43°C, while 30 genes were down-regulated in the
same conditions. Of the genes analysed in our study, only
three genes showed differential expression in response to
heat shock; MPN199 and MPN200 in Family 2 were upregulated, whereas MPN591 in Family 1 was down-regu-

lated. This is in agreement with our observation that Family 2 genes appear to be regulated in response to a variety
of environmental conditions. Recently, in a microarray
study of transcriptional regulation in M. gallisepticum
associated with eukaryotic cells, 58 genes were found to
be either up- or down-regulated [17]. The expression of M.
gallisepticum genes homologous to M. pneumoniae lipoproteins in multigene Families 1, 2, 3, and 4 was not
affected by contact with eukaryotic cells as detected by
microarray.
All genes, apart from MPN456, that were differentially
expressed in this study are hypothetical genes with no
assigned function. The results from this study imply that
these genes could be functional and that their gene products may play a role in adaptation to different environmental conditions. Two genes that belong to a gene family
unique to M. pneumoniae, MPN011 and MPN411, were
up-regulated when the cells were in contact with A549
cells, suggesting that the genes in this family could be
involved in adhesion or in the initial stages of infection.
MPN456, a homolog of a predicted component of a predicted oligopeptide ABC transport system (COG4166),
was also up-regulated after adhesion to A549 cells. This
could indicate regulation in response to a requirement for
transport of substrates from the host cell or involvement
in adhesion, as in M. hominis, in which a substrate-binding domain of a peptide transport system (OppA) mediates cytadherence [23,24]. However, further studies are
needed to understand the role of these genes in vivo and
whether the changes observed in gene expression of M.
pneumoniae during association with human cells are due
to adhesion, invasion or other interactions with the cell,
although some recent reports of the ability of M. pneumoniae to invade human cells have been contradictory
[2,3,25].
After acidic stress the mRNA of four genes in Family 6
formed a decreasing concentration gradient, in correlation with their distance from a predicted promoter [26].
By employing RT-PCR and oligonucleotides bridging the
adjacent coding sequences, these genes were shown to be
expressed polycistronically, contrary to our previous findings [5]. A positive correlation between mRNA levels and
proximity to a promoter was also observed by Benders et
al. [27] when they measured mRNA levels of the ftsZ gene
cluster in M. pneumoniae. Groups of functionally related
genes in M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium are often preceded by promoters. However no transcriptional terminators are located downstream of these genes to prevent
follow-through of transcription to subsequent ORFs [27].
It has been proposed that there are only a few transcriptional terminators in the mycoplasma genomes [28,29]
and, therefore, that the transcription of many genes may
be initiated from upstream promoters located in front of

other genes, not all of which are necessarily functionally
related to those downstream.

Conclusion
In summary, we have assessed transcriptional responses
of M. pneumoniae after association with host cells and after
exposure to hydrogen peroxide or low pH. A 20 mM concentration of H2O2 induced a trend towards general
down-regulation of lipoprotein genes, whereas low pH
had a more diverse effect on lipoprotein gene expression.
Adhesion of mycoplasma cells to A549 cells resulted in
up-regulation of selected genes, but the expression of
most genes remained unaffected. These observations of
transcriptional changes provide evidence for the functionality of these mostly unassigned genes and indicate that
they may have a role in responses by M. pneumoniae to
environmental changes.

Authors' contributions
