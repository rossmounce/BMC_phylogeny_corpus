Results: Here we identify 1,356 CNC sequences that appear to have undergone dramatic humanspecific changes in selective pressures, at least 15% of which have substitution rates significantly
above that expected under neutrality. The 1,356 'accelerated CNC' (ANC) sequences are enriched
in recent segmental duplications, suggesting a recent change in selective constraint following
duplication. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms within ANC sequences have a significant
excess of high frequency derived alleles and high FSTvalues relative to controls, indicating that
acceleration and positive selection are recent in human populations. Finally, a significant number of
single nucleotide polymorphisms within ANC sequences are associated with changes in gene
expression. The probability of variation in an ANC sequence being associated with a gene
expression phenotype is fivefold higher than variation in a control CNC sequence.

Background: Gene regulation is considered one of the driving forces of evolution. Although
protein-coding DNA sequences and RNA genes have been subject to recent evolutionary events
in the human lineage, it has been hypothesized that the large phenotypic divergence between
humans and chimpanzees has been driven mainly by changes in gene regulation rather than altered
protein-coding gene sequences. Comparative analysis of vertebrate genomes has revealed an
abundance of evolutionarily conserved but noncoding sequences. These conserved noncoding
(CNC) sequences may well harbor critical regulatory variants that have driven recent human
evolution.

particular, it was proposed a few decades ago that the phenotypic divergence between human and chimpanzees is largely
due to changes in gene regulation rather than changes in the
protein-coding sequences of genes [2]. Although it has been
long recognized that regulatory sequences play an important
role in genome function, the fine structure and evolutionary
patterns of such sequences are not well understood [3],
mainly because such sequences have a much more complex
functional code and appear not to be restricted to particular
sequence motifs. One of the most powerful approaches with
which to identify regulatory sequences has been to use multiple species comparative sequence analysis to look for conserved noncoding (CNC) sequences [4], but these sequences
represent only a subset of regulatory elements in the genome
and only a subset of them are regulatory elements [5].
CNC sequences are distributed throughout the genome in a
manner independent of gene density [6,7]. Studies of nucleotide variation have revealed strong selective constraints on
CNC sequences in human populations [8], and so there is little doubt that a large number of them have a functional role.
The abundance and genomic distribution of CNC sequences
has raised intriguing questions about the functions of such
sequences in the genome. Although a small fraction of the
CNC sequences can be associated with transcriptional regulation (most of the most highly conserved examples of CNC
sequences appear to be enhancers of early development genes
[5,9]), there remains a large number of CNC sequences with
unexplained function.
Although the identification of CNC sequences relies on
sequence conservation, it is conceivable that some of the most
interesting functional noncoding elements are also evolving
under positive (directional) selection in particular lineages.
Studies in Drosophila have suggested that such a pattern
exists in untranslated regions and in some introns and intergenic DNA [10]. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations as well
as mutations that lead to gain of novel functions are also likely
to contribute to evolutionary change [11,12]. A relatively
recent model for the evolution of novel gene function following gene duplication proposes that the reciprocal degeneration of regulatory elements after duplication (duplicationdegeneration-complementation) [13] could drive gene subfunctionalization, and an older model of gene duplication
proposed an important role for positive selection after duplication [14-16]. All of the above evolutionary processes could
contribute to phenotypic evolution in the human lineage, and
would result in a lineage-specific acceleration of the substitution rate of associated functional noncoding DNA.
In the present study we conducted an analysis of lineage-specific acceleration of previously identified CNC sequences in
vertebrates. By comparing the CNC sequences of three
genomes - human, chimpanzee and macaque - we identify
1,356 CNC sequences that have an excess of human-specific
substitutions relative to the chimpanzee lineage. By analyzing

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R118

the genomic distribution and nucleotide variation of these
fast-evolving (accelerated) CNC sequences, we find that significant numbers of them are found in the most recent
(mostly human-specific) segmental duplications, and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within them are associated with changes in gene expression. We also find a strong
signal of recent directional selection in the human lineage.

Results
Searching for fast-evolving (accelerated) conserved
noncoding sequences
We have selected 304,291 of the most conserved noncoding
sequences of at least 100 base pairs (bp) in length to look for
evidence of accelerated substitution rate in the human lineage
(see Materials and methods, below), by comparing the orthologous sequences of CNC sequences between human and
chimpanzee. We used a χ2-based test to detect regions of CNC
sequence that are diverging at an accelerated rate in either the
human or chimpanzee lineage [17]. The test requires at least
four substitutions between human and chimpanzee. Of the
304,291 CNC sequences, only 26,475 have at least four
human-chimpanzee substitutions. For those 26,475 CNC
sequences, we generated human-chimpanzee-macaque
three-way alignments to infer the direction of substitutions,
and performed Tajima's one-tailed χ2 test to detect humanspecific or chimpanzee-specific substitution rate acceleration,
applying the Yate's correction for continuity to correct for
small substitution counts [17]. The chosen P value threshold
was P = 0.08, because it was the P value with the minimum
false discovery rate (FDR; see Materials and methods, below)
in the range of P values between 0.05 and 0.15 (FDR = 75%).
At this threshold we detected a total of 2,794 (10.6%) accelerated CNC sequences (hereafter referred to as accelerated noncoding [ANC] sequences) in either the human (1,356 ANC
sequences [5.1%]) or the chimpanzee (1,438 ANC sequences
[5.3%]) lineage (Figure 1a) with P ≤ 0.08, whereas we
expected only 2,118 in total by chance. The FDR of 75% is
likely to be an overestimate because the Yate's correction is
generally considered conservative.
Comparison of the human and chimpanzee chromosomes in
the alignments reveals that only 20 out of 1,356 are not on the
expected syntenic chromosome (Additional data file 1). We
also conducted visual and manual examination of a random
sample of 5% of the ANC sequences across the whole spectrum of significance (Additional data file 1) to confirm that
the signals we detect are not a result of misalignments, and we
have concluded that this is very rare (only two out of 72 cases
are potentially problematic). Some of the ANC sequences
overlap with features that could potentially create such patterns (segmental duplications, retroposed genes, and pseudogenes), but in all of the cases that we tested the result cannot
be explained by misalignment. In fact, if we exclude
sequences that could generate potential alignment artefacts
(segmental duplications, retroposed genes, and pseudogenes

The analysis above allows us to identify CNC sequences that
have accelerated rates of substitutions in humans relative to
chimpanzees. This acceleration can be due either to loss of
selective constraint or to positive selection, and the biological
interpretation of the two is different. Loss of selective constraint should result in sequences adopting the neutral rate of
evolution, whereas sequences under positive selection might
be expected to be evolving more rapidly than under neutral
evolution. In order to obtain a minimum estimate of the fraction of the 1,356 ANC sequences that are undergoing positive
selection, we compared the human lineage-specific substitution rate of ANC sequences with that of 50,846 and 50,627
regions of the same size distribution as the CNC sequences
that are 10 kilobases (kb) away and 500 kb from a CNC
sequence, respectively, and with at least four substitutions
between human and chimpanzee. As a threshold to determine
whether an ANC sequence has a substitution rate higher than
neutral, we defined the 5% tail of the distributions of human
lineage-specific divergence of the two sets. These thresholds
are d0.05 at 10 kb = 0.0267 and d0.05 at 500 kb = 0.0268. A total of
260 (19%) and 259 (19%) ANC sequences have rates higher
than these thresholds, respectively, whereas only 5% (68 ANC
sequences) are expected by chance. This suggests that at least
191 ANC sequences have undergone sequence divergence
consistent with positive selection. If we exclude potentially

deposited research

Throughout this analysis we use the following sets of DNA
sequences as genomic controls, against which we compare the
human ANC sequences: the 23,681 nonaccelerated CNC
sequences with at least four substitutions sufficient to detect
significant acceleration (excluding human and chimpanzee
ANC sequences, hereafter referred to as 'power CNC
sequences'); and all remaining 277,814 nonaccelerated CNC
sequences (excluding power CNC sequences).

reports

[see below]), we then detect 1,145 human ANC sequences
(Figure 1b) relative to 18,289 power CNC sequences. The FDR
is estimated at 40% (P < 0.05), which suggests that 688
(60%) of ANC sequences are true positives, which is a larger
proportion than estimated above. We discuss below the relevance of such overlaps to real biological signals and hence
their inclusion. However, we also perform all of the analysis
(see below) excluding the ANC sequences in the above features to confirm the validity of the obtained results.

Two recent studies [18,19] have also described ANC
sequences in the human genome. A total of 37 of the 202
human accelerated regions (HARs; 18%) in the Pollard study
[18] and 159 of the 992 accelerated conserved noncoding
sequences (CNSs; 16%) in the Prabhakar study [19] overlap
our set of ANC sequences. The overlap between these sets is
also low; 51 of the 202 HARs (25%) in the Pollard study [18]
overlap the CNSs in the Prabhakar study [19]. The overlap
between studies (Figure 2) is highly significant, and all three
studies are capturing similar signals but clearly the overlap is
incomplete. One explanation for the limited overlap between
the three studies is that there are many ANC sequences, most
of which cannot be detected because of a lack of power. However, it is difficult to distinguish this possibility from the differences expected as a result of use of three methods that rely
on different assumptions. In particular, our study uses a
methodology that specifically detects human lineage-specific
acceleration relative to the chimpanzee, and the identification
of ANC sequences is mutually exclusive in the two species,
which is not the case in the two other studies.

confounding ANC sequences, then we observe that 200 of the
1,145 ANC sequences (17.5%) have a human lineage-specific
rate above the neutral threshold and that this accounts for at
least 143 ANC sequences presumably under positive
selection.
In an alternative approach, we compared the human lineagespecific rate with the synonymous substitution rate estimated
from human and chimpanzee [20], which in some cases may
serve as a neutral proxy. The average synonymous substitution rate was computed as Ks = 0.0141 ± 0.0132 (mean ±
standard deviation [SD]), and an estimate of the expected
human Ks rate is taken as half that. We consider two upper
bounds of neutral rate as Ks2 SD = mean + 2 SD = 0.0203 and
Ks3 SD = mean + 3 SD = 0.0270. With Ks2 SD and Ks3 SD, 515
ANC sequences (38%) and 253 ANC sequences (18%), respectively, are estimated to have undergone positive selection.
Similar results are obtained if we consider the observed distribution of Ks values to determine the 95% (P < 0.05) and
99% (P < 0.01) upper confidence limits. We conclude that at
least 15% and potentially more than one-third of the ANC
sequences are evolving faster than the neutral substitution
rate. Synonymous sites can be constrained but the fact that all
three methods give similar results suggests that 15% to 19% of
ANC sequences have substitutions rates above what is
expected by neutral evolution.

Genomic location of accelerated noncoding sequences
We investigated the possibility that ANC sequences are
degenerate regulatory elements associated with subfunctionalized genes or elements that have decayed in function following duplication in a manner similar to pseudogenes. We
explored the distribution of ANC sequences, power CNC
sequences, and nonaccelerated CNC sequences in recent segmental duplications of the human genome, as defined in
recent studies [21,22]. Approximately 5% to 6% of the
genome is included in segmental duplications, but we find 8%
of the ANC sequences, 10% of the power CNC sequences, and
only 5% of nonaccelerated CNC sequences (Table 1) within
segmental duplications. This suggests an enrichment of ANC
sequences and power CNC sequences in segmental duplications, and this is significantly different from the density of
nonaccelerated CNC sequences in segmental duplications (χ2
test, P < 10-4).

We subsequently considered the age of the segmental duplications containing ANC sequences, power CNC sequences,
and nonaccelerated CNC sequences, by comparing the distribution of percentage identity between paralogs of segmental
duplications overlapping each of the three sets above. The
distribution for segmental duplications containing ANC
sequences reveals that ANC sequences are highly enriched
within recent segmental duplications of low divergence (<2%;
Figure 3). The distributions of the two controls are both significantly skewed toward an excess of old and highly diverged
segmental duplications (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 10-4).
This strongly suggests that some ANC sequences have undergone modification of their selective pressures (either loss of
selective constraint or positive selection) after very recent
duplication.
To test for enrichment of ANC sequences in variable genomic
duplications segregating in human populations, we intersected ANC sequences, power CNC sequences, and nonaccelerated CNC sequences with human copy number variants
(CNVs) from a public database (Database of Genomic Variants in Toronto [23]). The enrichment we observed was
entirely due to high overlap between CNVs and segmental
duplications, suggesting no enrichment of ANC sequences in
CNVs per se.
We further explored the overlap of ANC sequences, power
CNC sequences, and the nonaccelerated CNC sequences with
retroposed genes and pseudogenes. Only 8% of ANC
sequences overlap these elements, as compared with an overlap of 15% for the power CNC sequences (χ2 test, P < 10-4;
Table 1). This supports the concept that the detection of acceleration in ANC sequences is not due to misalignments,
because one of our control sets - the power CNC sequences are more enriched for retroposed genes and pseudogenes.
Normally, most studies exclude such sequences from the
analysis because they are considered noise, but in light of
recent studies that associated function with repetitive
elements [24,25], we retained all ANC sequences and CNC
sequences overlapping such elements for subsequent analysis. However, in most cases we also perform the analysis without them to control for any biases that they might introduce.

Segmental duplication divergence in ANC and CNC sequences
Segmental duplication divergence in ANC and CNC sequences. The figure shows that the divergence of paralogs in segmental duplications (SDs) where
conserved noncoding (CNC) sequences (red) and power CNC sequences (purple) are found is skewed to high divergence values, whereas the accelerated
noncoding (ANC) sequences (yellow) have a strong enrichment in recent segmental duplications, as expected if the acceleration is due to a recent change
in selective forces (positive selection or loss of selective constraint).

Because SNPs in segmental duplications and CNVs can
exhibit odd patterns of variation, such as those caused by genotyping errors, we have also performed the analysis excluding
any SNPs in ANC sequences that map to segmental duplications, CNVs, or pseudogenes of retroposed genes (n = 610),
and we observed that the pattern of excess of high-frequency
derived alleles remains strong and significant (Figure 4a).
This overall analysis suggests that recent, possibly positive
selection in ANC sequences has shaped the pattern of
nucleotide variation in ways similar to the pattern of fixed
nucleotide changes between species.

information

We defined five sets of SNPs from the Yoruba (YRI) population of the HapMap [26] project: SNPs within ANC sequences
(n = 682), power CNC sequences (n = 28,722), nonaccelerated CNC sequences (n = 48,811), and two new control sets of
SNPs (n = 28,408 and 28,722) from 1,356 20-kb windows
located 500 kb 5' and 3' of the ANC sequences. The DAF spectrum of the ANC sequences has a significant excess of high-

frequency derived alleles relative to the DAF spectrum of all
control sets (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 10-4; Figure 4a). The
DAF spectrum of the power CNC sequences is more similar to
the neutral controls than to that of the nonaccelerated CNC
sequences, possibly suggesting that power CNC sequences are
a mix of ANC sequences and nonaccelerated CNC sequences.
The other HapMap populations exhibit very similar patterns
(data not shown).

interactions

We further explored the patterns and levels of nucleotide variation in ANC sequences in human populations to determine
whether the processes that shape the evolution of ANC
sequences are historical (predating human coalescent time)
or recent in human populations. We used the derived allele
frequency (DAF) spectrum of SNPs from the phase II HapMap [26,27]. The state of the allele (either derived or ancestral) was inferred by aligning the SNP position to the
chimpanzee genome and using parsimonious assumptions
(see Materials and methods, below). Regions with an excess
of SNPs with high DAF relative to the expectations of a neutral equilibrium model are likely to be evolving under positive
selection [28].

Analysis of accelerated noncoding sequences
associated with differential gene expression

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R118

information

To assess the functional impact of nucleotide variation in
ANC sequences on phenotypic variation, we looked for associations between SNPs from the phase II HapMap [26,27]
within ANC sequences or power CNC sequences and gene
expression levels from the 210 unrelated HapMap individuals
using recently generated gene expression data [30,31] (see
Materials and methods, below). We performed a linear
regression between quantitative gene expression values for
14,925 probes and numerically coded genotypes of each SNP
within a 10 megabase (Mb) window centered on the midpoint
of each transcript probe. The statistical significance was evaluated through the use of 10,000 permutations performed
separately for each gene to give adjusted significance thresholds of 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01 (Table 2). At these thresholds
we find three, 58, and 458 SNP to gene expression associations for ANC sequences and 43, 135, and 960 SNP to gene
expression associations for power CNC sequences, respectively, across all populations. At the 0.01 threshold 16% of the
tested ANC sequences (59/366) contain SNPs that are significantly associated with the expression of a gene, contrasting
with only 3% of the tested power CNC sequences (165/5968;

interactions

In order to further characterize the recent evolutionary pressures on ANC sequences and to detect recent population-specific patterns of selection, we calculated FST, which is a
common measure of population differentiation [29], for SNPs
in ANC sequences and nonaccelerated CNC sequences, and
compared the two distributions of FST values. We excluded all
SNPs on the X chromosome, which tend to have higher FST
values because of its lower effective population size [26]. We
find that FST values in ANC sequences are higher than those
for nonaccelerated CNC sequences, but at marginal statistical
significance (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.0504; Figure 4b).
The signal of higher FST values in ANC sequence SNPs
becomes significant if we then exclude the SNPs in retroposed
genes, pseudogenes, segmental duplications, or CNVs

(Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.0363). SNPs from the studies
by Pollard [18] and Prabhakar [19] and their colleagues do not
demonstrate a skew in FST values to any statistically significant degree (Additional data file 2).

refereed research

We then compared the DAF spectrum of SNPs in ANC
sequences with those of SNPs within HARs [18] (n = 84) and
accelerated CNSs [19] (n = 328). We observe that SNPs in
HARs exhibit an excess of high derived allele frequency,
similar to SNPs in ANC sequences, which is consistent with
recent positive selection, whereas SNPs in the accelerated
CNSs of Prabhakar and coworkers [19] exhibit a pattern more
similar to those neutrally evolving (Additional data file 2),
indicating once again the heterogeneity of these three sets of
accelerated sequences.

seven times more likely to be associated with variation in gene
expression levels than is a SNP within a power CNC sequence,
and that nucleotide variation within ANC sequences is five
times more likely to be associated with gene expression levels
than variation in a power CNC sequence. At the most stringent threshold three genes are associated with ANC
sequences: C13orf7, which is of unknown function; SLC35B3,
a probable sugar transporter; and RBPSUH (Recombining
Binding Protein SUppressor of Hairless), which is a J kapparecombination signal-binding protein.
We further explored the biological properties of the associated genes at the significance threshold of 0.01 by counting
the occurrences of each of the Gene Ontology (GO) slim terms
associated with these genes. We compared the proportions of
genes with and without a GO slim term for ANC sequence
associated genes versus those tested with the same counts for
power CNC sequences (Fisher's exact test). Genes associated
with ANC sequence variation are deficient for the GO slim
term 'binding' and enriched for the GO slim term 'physiologic
process' relative to power CNC sequences. Overall, this
suggests that ANC sequence nucleotide variation affects
expression of different types of genes to a greater degree than
does nucleotide variation within power CNC sequences (after
controlling for the types of genes that were included in the
analysis), but that the counts are too small to draw specific
conclusions about the nature of the effect.

Discussion

We have detected 1,356 CNC sequences that have an accelerated substitution rate in the human relative to the chimpanzee lineage (human ANC sequences). Misalignment of
paralogous sequences is unlikely to explain the overall signal,
and manual curation confirms that this only potentially
occurs in fewer than 3% of cases. The lower quality of the
other two genomes has minimal effect on the human ANC
sequence analysis, because for a substitution to be classified

as human specific both the chimpanzee and the macaque
sequences must have the same nucleotide and differ from the
human nucleotide. We therefore expect this test to be conservative because many chimpanzee-specific substitutions
could be sequencing errors, leading to an overestimate of
these. The comparison of the human substitution rate in control regions 10 kb or 500 kb from power CNC sequences or the
expected human synonymous substitution rate (Ks) with that
of the ANC sequences suggests that 15% to 19% of the ANC
sequences have not simply diverged from the sequence of the
common ancestor because of loss of constraint, but that the
rate of divergence has increased twofold to fourfold above
that expected under neutrality, indicating that they have
undergone positive selection.
An interesting possibility is that some ANC sequences are
degenerate regulatory elements associated with subfunctionalized duplicate genes, as described in the duplication-degeneration-complementation model [13], or elements that have
decayed in function in a similar way to pseudogenes. We
found an enrichment of the ANC sequences within the most
recent segmental duplications (<2% divergence) relative to
both power CNC sequences and nonaccelerated CNC
sequences. The general enrichment in segmental duplications
is not surprising, because it has been observed that sequence
divergence is elevated in duplicated sequences [32,33]. The
most recent segmental duplications in the human genome
occurred after the human-chimpanzee split, and differential
evolution between these copies would explain the humanspecific acceleration caused by loss of selective constraint due
to redundancy or positive selection due to gain of a new function. The DAF analysis suggests that many newly derived alleles within ANC sequences are undergoing positive selection,
there are unfortunately insufficient genotyped SNPs to test
those only within segmental duplications.
If the signal of ANC sequences were due to misalignments,
then we would have observed an excess of ANC sequences in

The presence of ANC sequences in the human genome suggests that the evolution of noncoding DNA contributes substantially to species differentiation. Our analysis relies on the
identification of these ANC sequences by initially requiring
conservation across multiple vertebrate species, and so it is
conservative with respect to the contribution of functional
noncoding elements to species differentiation. Previous studies have shown that the proportion of functional noncoding
sequences can be large and not necessarily conserved above
neutral expectation [3]. When additional genomes become
available, increasingly rigorous analyses and detection methodologies can be developed to elucidate the degree of noncoding and regulatory evolution and the birth-and-death process
of regulatory elements. Nevertheless, the ANC sequences
identified in this study can serve as a baseline for the elucidation of biological processes in noncoding DNA that contribute
to species differentiation.

A three-way alignment of human, chimp, and rhesus was
computed using the multiz program [39] and searched for
intervals of interest (for example, at least four mismatches)
using software written specifically for that purpose.

interactions

CNC sequences were detected using a phylogenetic hidden
Markov model (phyloHMM) [35] in the top 5% of the conserved genome (PhastCons conserved elements, 17-way vertebrate MULTIZ alignment), as available at the University of
California, Santa Cruz Genome browser [36]. The top 5% represents the minimal selectively constrained genome, as
inferred from the Mouse genome analysis [37]. We selected
elements of at least 100 bases to increase our power to detect
acceleration and intersected those elements with Ensembl
gene predictions (v40, August 2006) [38] to obtain the set of
elements that did not overlap any part of the processed transcript. CNC sequences with more than four substitutions
between human and chimpanzee were aligned among
human, chimpanzee, and macaque, and lineage-specific substitutions were inferred assuming parsimony. Alignments of
these elements were obtained from a three-way MULTIZ
alignment [39] of human finished sequence (hg18), chimpanzee assembly (panTro2), and macaque (draft assembly). The
human and chimp genome sequences were aligned with the
blastz program [40] with the substitution scores presented in
Table 3 and penalizing a gap of length k by 600 + 150 k. The
substitution scores for human-rhesus alignments are also
summarized in Table 3, and a gap of length k was penalized by
600 + 130 k.

refereed research

We observed that SNPs within ANC sequences are significantly associated with gene expression phenotypes, and the
probability that SNP variation within an ANC sequence being
associated is fivefold higher than for a power CNC sequence.
The pattern of enrichment in gene expression associations
provides our strongest evidence that ANC sequences contain
functionally evolving sequence that is associated with
changes in gene expression. There is a tendency for the
derived alleles within ANC sequences to be associated with
low gene expression levels, although this is not statistically
significant. Because the derived allele is high in frequency in
SNPs within ANC sequences this could indicate that low

Materials and methods

Regions with an excess of SNPs with high DAF relative to the
expectations of a neutral equilibrium model are likely to be
evolving under positive selection [28]. The DAF spectrum of
the ANC sequences exhibits an excess of high-frequency
derived alleles relative to the DAF spectrum of all control sets.
In addition, the observation of higher population
differentiation (higher FST values) in ANC sequence SNPs
suggests not only that ANC sequences have contributed to
evolutionary change along the human lineage since the time
of the human-chimpanzee common ancestor, but also that
some have contributed to recent differentiation between
human populations. The power CNC sequence set is expected
to contain regions that have high substitution rates and also
regions with human lineage-specific acceleration that failed
to meet the significance threshold for inclusion in the ANC
sequence category, or previously fast-evolving regions that
have switched selective pressures before the human-chimpanzee split that therefore have similar rates in both human
and chimpanzee. This hypothesis is strengthened by the
recent study conducted by Pollard and coworkers [18],
because 112 out of the 202 HARs overlap the power CNC
sequences of the present study. The overlap of 112 HARs with
power CNC sequences is not due to low power in our study but
mainly due to the fact that our analysis makes the explicit
assumption that the human lineage is significantly faster than
that of the chimpanzee, which is not the case in the study conducted by Pollard and coworkers. Interestingly, the most significant ANC sequence in our analysis completely overlaps
with the most significant element in the Pollard study (HAR1)
[34].

reports

The overlap of ANC sequences with elements such as retroposed genes and pseudogenes is not surprising because these
elements are thought to undergo degradation or change when
they are released from the selective constraint placed on
active genes. They are, however, more enriched in the power
CNC sequences than in the ANC sequences. By parallel analysis we demonstrate that our observations are generally
robust to inclusion of ANC sequences in the above elements.

comment

older and more divergent segmental duplications. We therefore conclude that the recent change in selective forces of
some ANC sequences may be a result of duplication.

For the following analysis the human coordinates were
mapped from NCBI 36 (hg18) to NCBI 35 (hg17) using the liftOver program [41].
Because we are testing for differences in the relative rates of
substitution along the lineages, paralogous alignments of
duplicates after the (macaque [chimpanzee, human]) split
will not generate a signal because the length of the branches
are the same. The only scenario that can generate a false signal is if the duplication occurred before the (macaque [chimpanzee, human]) split, giving rise to copies X and Y, and the
alignment is between the chimpanzee and macaque copy X
and the human copy Y. This scenario requires that the human
copy X has been lost and that the macaque and chimpanzee
copies of Y are either not included in the assembly or have
also both been lost. The fact that this requires three losses/
misses makes the scenario unlikely, and inspection of the data
does not suggest that it is occurring.
We applied the χ2-based relative rate test [17] to detect
sequences that are accelerated in either the human or chimpanzee lineage. Because this method could potentially be
affected by small counts of substitutions, we applied the
Yates' correction for continuity, which is conservative in estimating the P value of the test. We then selected the threshold
that had the lowest FDR in the range of P values between 0.05
and 0.15. This threshold was P = 0.08, with estimated FDR of
75%; we therefore subsequently analyzed all human ANC
sequences that have P ≤ 0.08. Note that the Yate's correction
generally over-corrects, and so our FDR is likely to be an
overestimate.
As a control for our ability to detect human accelerated
regions, we compared the relative enrichment of our ANC
sequences and power CNC sequences in those detected as
accelerated in humans using alternative methods [18,19].
Although the tests differ in their approaches (ours, for
example, conditions on human lineage acceleration versus
the chimpanzee lineage only), we find a sixfold enrichment of
previously detected accelerated regions (HARs and accelerated CNSs) in our ANC sequence set relative to the power
CNC sequences control set.
Because of the lower quality of the chimpanzee and macaque
genome sequences relative to the human genome sequence,
we only considered sequences accelerated in the human lineage. As a control, we also performed alignments of humanchimpanzee-macaque at coordinates 10 and 500 kb away
from the initial CNC sequence coordinates to use as controls
for the neutral substitution rate.

Segmental duplications
A set of genomic coordinates corresponding to segmental
duplications, defined elsewhere [21,22], were used as points
of reference in the genome. Accelerated, nonaccelerated, and
power CNC sequences were then mapped to those segmental

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R118

duplications, and the abundance of ANC sequences was compared with the observed abundance of nonaccelerated or
power CNC sequences in segmental duplications as well as
the estimated coverage of the genome by segmental duplications (5% to 6%). CNV genomic coordinates were obtained
from the Database of Genomic Variants in Toronto [23].

Pseudogenes and retroposed genes
Genomic coordinates for retroposed genes and two set of
pseudogenes (Yale and Vega annotations available at the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome browser [36]) were
used. Accelerated, nonaccelerated, and power CNC sequences
were then mapped to those coordinates, and an overlap was
defined whenever at least a single base was common between
the two sets of features under comparison.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms and FSTvalues

SNPs from phase I and phase II from release 19 of the HapMap project [26,27] were mapped from NCBI 34 (hg16) to
NCBI 35 (hg17) using the liftOver program [41]. SNPs that did
not map to hg17 were ignored and derived alleles were
inferred based on the chimpanzee alignment to the hg17 version of the human genome. For those SNPs that did not have
a reliable chimpanzee alignment, the alignment to the rhesus
macaque was used. Inference of the derived allele was based
on parsimony, and the common allelic state between the
human and the chimpanzee (or macaque in few cases) was
considered the ancestral allele. The DAF was estimated and
DAF spectra were compared using the nonparametric MannWhitney U-test. One potential caveat of this analysis is that,
because we required the reference human sequence to be
quite divergent from the chimpanzee, we have selected a large
number of CNC sequences with an excess of derived alleles by
chance, which specifically enriches for SNPs with high DAFs.
We find this unlikely because only 4.2% of the fixed differences (281/6,660) that produced the signal of acceleration
can be explained by the derived alleles of HapMap SNPs in
the reference sequence, and this can only increase to approximately 8% if ungenotyped SNPs are accounted for. Therefore, the bulk of the signal for acceleration was independent
of the DAFs of the SNPs within the ANC sequences. The SNP
ascertainment does not affect the analysis because we are
using both phase I and II SNPs of the HapMap, which
together provide a relatively unbiased view of SNP density
and allele frequencies. In addition, any potential bias toward
genic regions would not create a bias in our analysis because
all of the frequency spectra we compare are independent of
genes.
The phase II HapMap is estimated to contain more than half
of the common SNPs in the tested Yoruban (YRI) Hap Map
population, as has been estimated by the resequenced
ENCODE regions [26]. Therefore, the contribution of SNPs to
divergence is not expected to be more than 8%. This, together
with the comparison with the accelerated sequences at 10 kb
and 500 kb, suggests that small confounding effects of

We used gene expression data on 47,294 transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines of all 210 HapMap [26] unrelated individuals from the four populations, in four technical replicates.
The gene expression values of 47,294 transcripts interrogated
using the array were then normalized and averages taken for
each probe across replicates. We downloaded the HapMap
[26,27] genotypes (release 21) for each population of all of the
phase II SNPs (with a minor allele frequency >5%) within
ANC sequences and power CNC sequences. A linear regression was then performed (separately within each population)
between quantitative gene expression values for 14,925
probes (a subset chosen on the basis of sufficient measurable
expression levels and variability) and numerically coded genotypes (0, 1, 2) of each SNP within a 10 Mb window centered
on the midpoint of each transcript probe. The statistical significance was evaluated through the use of 10,000 permutations performed separately for each gene. In each
permutation of a single gene, the most significant P value was
retained, and so that there were 10,000 P values for each
gene. From these distributions, for each gene, we determined
significance thresholds of 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01. For each
gene tested for association with SNPs in ANC sequences or
power CNC sequences, the GO slim terms were tabulated in a
nonredundant list (multiple transcripts were removed). For
each GO slim term the counts of genes with and without the
GO slim term in significantly associated genes (at threshold
0.01) and the total genes tested were compared using 2 × 2
contingency tables tested by the Fisher's exact test for genes
associated with SNPs in accelerated and the power CNC
sequences.
