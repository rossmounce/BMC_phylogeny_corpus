Abstract
Background: Frogs primitively have a biphasic life history with an aquatic larva (tadpole) and a
usually terrestrial adult. However, direct developing frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus have lost
a free living larval stage. Many larval structures never form during development of Eleutherodactylus,
while limbs, spinal cord, and an adult-like cranial musculoskeletal system develop precociously.
Results: Here, I compare growth and differentiation of the retina and tectum and development of
early axon tracts in the brain between Eleutherodactylus coqui and the biphasically developing frogs
Discoglossus pictus, Physalaemus pustulosus, and Xenopus laevis using morphometry,
immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and acetylated tubulin,
biocytin tracing, and in situ hybridization for NeuroD. Findings of the present study indicate that
retinotectal development was greatly altered during evolution of Eleutherodactlyus mostly due to
acceleration of cell proliferation and growth in retina and tectum. However, differentiation of
retina, tectum, and fiber tracts in the embryonic brain proceed along a conserved slower schedule
and remain temporally coordinated with each other in E. coqui.
Conclusion: These findings reveal a mosaic pattern of changes in the development of the central
nervous system (CNS) during evolution of the direct developing genus Eleutherodactylus. Whereas
differentiation events in directly interconnected parts of the CNS such as retina, tectum, and brain
tracts remained coordinated presumably due to their interdependent development, they were
dissociated from proliferation control and from differentiation events in other parts of the CNS
such as the spinal cord. This suggests that mosaic evolutionary changes reflect the modular
character of CNS development.

Background
Most frogs have a characteristic biphasic life history, with
a specialized aquatic larval stage and a typically terrestrial
adult. Transformation of the larva into the adult takes
place during metamorphosis, a period of dramatic reorganization of the body plan at the end of larval life, which
involves the loss of many larval tissues, the establishment
of novel adult tissues as well as complex spatial tissue rearrangements under the control of thyroid hormones [1,2].

The phylogenetic distribution of this biphasic life history
indicates that it is the ancestral developmental pattern of
extant anurans [3-7]. However, in several anuran lineages,
the free-living larval stage has been secondarily reduced or
lost resulting in direct development [8-12]. While some
larval features are recapitulated within the egg in direct
developers, other larval features are lost and ontogenetic
trajectories are modified and abbreviated. The degree to
which larval development is recapitulated or abolished

differs between different lineages of direct developing
frogs with frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus (Leptodactylidae) showing the most radical deviations from the
ancestral pattern.
In Eleutherodactylus, including the particularly well studied
Puerto Rican species E. coqui, many larval structures of the
epidermis, the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, and the inner organs never develop, while an adultlike cranial skeleton together with its associated muscles
and nerves develops precociously [9,11,13-21]. Limb
buds, which develop in larval stages of biphasically developing frogs, form already in early embryonic stages of E.
coqui and this is paralleled by accelerated growth of the
spinal cord and precocious development of dorsal root
ganglia and lateral motor columns in the spinal cord,
which provide the sensory and motor innervation of
limbs, respectively [18,19,22-28]. Interestingly, another
region of the central nervous system (CNS), the neural retina, also displays accelerated embryonic growth in E. coqui
even though this is not accompanied by precocious differentiation of retinal cell layers [29]. As a consequence of
these changes in timing (heterochronies) of various developmental events, embryos of E. coqui at any given stage
present a complex mosaic of traits, some corresponding to
embryonic stages of development of biphasically developing frogs, others corresponding to larval, metamorphic or
adult stages (Fig. 1, Tables 1, 2).
Despite these ontogenetic modifications, E. coqui retains
some sort of cryptic metamorphosis [11,30]. During the
last third of development prior to hatching (stages TS 12
– TS 15), its musculoskeletal system and several other tissues are remodeled in a way resembling metamorphic
reorganization in biphasic developers. Moreover, these
events are thyroid hormone dependent: they occur immediately after the thyroid axis becomes functional in E.
coqui (as indicated by maturation of the thyroid gland
and upregulation of thyroid hormone receptors TRβ) and
can be arrested when thyroid hormone synthesis is
blocked [11,30,31].
In both limb and cranial muscle development, precocious
development of target structures in E. coqui is accompanied by a correspondingly precocious development of
their innervation. The present paper addresses the question, whether the differentiation of the retina in E. coqui
also remains closely temporally coordinated with the differentiation of the major central target of retinofugally
projecting fibers in frogs, the optic tectum, and how this
relates to the differentiation of other parts of the brain.
Furthermore, it explores, whether growth of the optic tectum is accelerated like growth of the retina in E. coqui
compared to the ancestral pattern of biphasically developing frogs.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/9

In order to address these questions, development of retina
and tectum is compared between E. coqui and the biphasically developing frogs Discoglossus pictus (Discoglossidae) and Physalaemus pustulosus (Leptodactylidae). While
retinotectal projections have been studied in adult D. pictus [32], its embryonic development has not been previously reported. D. pictus was chosen as a representative of
a basal anuran family with biphasic development. P. pustulosus was chosen, because it is relatively closely related to
E. coqui (both frogs belong to the Leptodactylidae) but
retains biphasic development. Comparison between the
biphasic pattern of development in D. pictus, P. pustulosus,
and other previously studied biphasically developing
anurans (e.g. Xenopus) allows to identify shared features,
which likely reflect the ancestral pattern of anuran development, from which direct development in Eleutherodactylus was derived. In addition, the expression of the
neuronal differentiation gene NeuroD [33,34] in retina
and tectum was compared between E. coqui and Xenopus
laevis (Pipidae), since this gene has not been cloned from
D. pictus or P. pustulosus.
The present study shows that in E. coqui embryonic
growth of the optic tectum is accelerated paralleling rapid
growth of the retina, while differentiation of tectal layers
and development of the retinotectal projection proceeds
according to a much slower schedule in coordination with
retinal differentiation and the differentiation of fiber
tracts in the brain. Thus, E. coqui hatchlings resemble postmetamorphic froglets of biphasically developing frog species with respect to differentiation of cranial muscles,
limbs and spinal cord, and the size of their brains, but
resemble tadpoles with respect to differentiation of their
retinotectal system. These findings suggest that the schedule of differentiation of directly interconnected parts of
the CNS such as retina and tectum remains coordinated
during evolution, but can evolve largely decoupled from
growth control and from the differentiation of other parts
of the CNS (e.g. spinal cord).

Results
In the following, I will frequently refer to E. coqui hatchlings (at stage TS 15) and compare them with various
developmental stages in biphasically developing frogs. As
a note of clarification, I should point out that this is done
without intending to attach any particular significance to
the time of hatching itself. The latter is highly variable
between species and has little developmental significance.
E. coqui hatchlings are rather singled out for comparison
because with respect to many characters (e.g., musculoskeletal system, tail regression, limbs, brain size) they
have reached a developmental stage, which corresponds
to biphasically frogs at the completion of metamorphosis.

D. pictus [86,87] with stages of X. laevis [88]) are also indicated. The duration of the larval period (dashed part of Y axis) in D.
pictus and X. laevis is variable and is represented here in a very telescoped fashion. All symbols in the plot except the asterisks
represent developmental events (e.g., outgrowth of retinofugal fibers), whose timing in E. coqui is plotted against timing in D.
pictus (for detailed list see below). The asterisks compare timing of NeuroD expression between X. laevis and E. coqui. Timing of
events is based on data reported in this paper as well as [18,19,21,28,29]; a few data on limb development are taken from [9]
and from [93] on D. sardus. For a detailed list of developmental events see Tables 1 and 2 (colored symbols) and references
[21,28] (black and grey symbols). Whereas suites of developmental events conserved between two species compared in a heterochrony plot are expected to plot along a diagonal line, temporal dissociations (heterochronic shifts) are indicated by deviations from such a pattern [21]. The distribution of events in this heterochrony plot reveals multiple heterochronic shifts of
developmental events between E. coqui and D. pictus. While retinotectal differentiation (blue triangles; suite II) remains temporally coordinated with early development of the CNS (pink triangles; suite I), early differentiation of the spinal cord (grey
squares; suite V), and early embryonic development of many cranial structures (black symbols; suite IX) in E. coqui, the formation of lateral motor columns and innervation of the limbs (grey triangles; suite VII) is predisplaced into early embryonic stages
paralleling precocious onset of limb development (black symbols; suite X) in E. coqui. The formation of dorsal root ganglia also
occurs earlier in E. coqui (grey triangles; suite VI). Growth of the retina (red circles; suite III), the tectum (green circles; suite
IV), and the spinal cord (grey circles; suite VIII) all occur relatively early in E. coqui. Metamorphic remodeling of cranial structures (black symbols; suites XI and XII) occurs immediately after embryonic cranial development (black symbols; suite IX) in E.
coqui.

Development of retina and tectum were analyzed and
their size was measured in paraffine sections of various
developmental stages of E. coqui, D. pictus, and P. pustulosus ranging from neural tube closure to postmetamorphic
(posthatching in E. coqui) stages. Because the size of retina
and tectum reaches a plateau at the beginning of metamorphic climax in D. pictus (stage Go 40) and P. pustulosus
(stage Go 41) and around the time of hatching (stage TS
15) in E. coqui (Figs. 2, 3), these plateau values are taken

as reference size for each species. Retinal and tectal size at
each stage are expressed as fraction of reference size (size/
reference size), which facilitates comparison of retinal and
tectal growth between species (Fig. 1, Table 1).
The development of the retina in E. coqui and D. pictus has
been previously described [29]. Briefly, in E. coqui, outgrowth of the first retinofugal fibers and differentiation of
the various cell and fiber layers of the retina during
embryonic development is accompanied by rapid retinal

growth (Fig. 2A, C). In contrast, in D. pictus, retinofugal
fibers grow out and retinal layers form during embryonic
development, preceding a period of prolonged growth of
the retina during subsequent larval development (Fig. 2B,
C). Similar to D. pictus, the formation of different retinal
layers in P. pustulosus (data not shown) is also completed
during embryonic development (with formation of a layer
of photoreceptor outer segments at Go 27) prior to retinal
growth during larval stages. At the stage when retinal layer
formation is completed, the retinae of D. pictus and P. pustulosus have reached only about one third of their size at
metamorphic climax, whereas the retina of E. coqui has
reached more than 90 % of its size at hatching.
The development of the optic tectum shows similar differences between species. In the mature anuran tectum, 9
layers can be distinguished, numbered from 1 on the ventricle to 9 on the surface [35]. During early development
of E. coqui the optic tectum consists of a single cellular
layer, which increases rapidly in size (Fig. 3A, C, 4A–C). A
superficial fiber layer, which will subsequently develop
into layers 7–9 (two fiber layers with an interspersed layer
of scattered cell bodies), is first evident at stage TS 11. At
stage TS 13, when the tectum has reached more than 90 %

of its size at hatching, a second fiber layer (layer 5)
appears within the cellular layer, dividing the latter in a
peripheral (layer 6) and ventricular part. Subdivision of
this ventricular layer into distinct layers 1–4 (an ependymal layer and two cellular layers with a fiber layer sandwiched in between) becomes, however, only evident six
days after hatching.
In contrast, the optic tectum remains small throughout
embryonic development of D. pictus (Fig. 3B, C, 4D–F))
and P. pustulosus (data not shown). The superficial (layers
7–9) and deep (layer 5) fiber layers appear at early larval
stages (Go 29 in D. pictus, Go 27 in P. pustulosus), when
the tectum has reached only a small fraction (about one
third in D. pictus, less than one fourth in P. pustulosus) of
its size at the end of metamorphic climax. Subdivision of
the ventricular cell layer into layers 1–4 becomes first
apparent during metamorphic climax (Go 41–42) in both
species. Thus, at hatching the tectum of E. coqui (Fig. 4C)
resembles the tectum of D. pictus at early to mid larval
stages (Fig. 4F) with respect to the differentiation of tectal
layers.

Cross-sectional area of the central retina (light blue) or of its cellular layer (dark blue) is plotted against developmental age. In
addition, a proliferative index indicating the PCNA positive proportion of the cellular layer is shown in green. Each symbol represents a measurement from a single individual (there are less data points for the proliferative index than for area measurements because PCNA staining was not apparent in each individual). Curves are drawn through mean values in case more than
one individual per stage was analyzed. For each species, timing of first outgrowth of axons from retinal ganglion cells (RGC),
the first retinofugal fibers in the optic chiasm, the formation of inner and outer plexiform layers (IPL and OPL, respectively) and
of a distinct layer of photoreceptor (PR) outer segments in the retina are indicated in red. For D. pictus the approximate duration of larval and metamorphic phases are emphasized, while for E. coqui, which lacks a free-living larva, the time of hatching is
shown (at hatching, E. coqui corresponds to frogs at the end of metamorphosis with respect to many characters). In each graph,
one scale unit of the abscissa represents 1 day of development at 24°C, except for larval stages of D. pictus, which are of variable duration and are represented here in an extremely telescoped way. TS 15+6, TS 15+10 and Go 45+8 refer to stages at 6

The time course of PCNA immunostaining in the retina of
E. coqui and D. pictus has been previously described [29].
Briefly, in E. coqui PCNA immunopositive cells occur
throughout the outer part of the inner nuclear layer of the
retina until the latter has almost reached its size at hatching and only then become restricted to the ciliary margin
(Fig. 2A, C). In contrast, in D. pictus (Fig. 2B, C) and P. pustulosus (data not shown), PCNA positive cells become
restricted to the ciliary margin already at midembryonic
stages (GH 23–27 in both species), preceding the period
of larval retinal growth.
In the optic tectum of early embryos of E. coqui (Figs. 3A,
C, 4A), D. pictus (Figs. 3B, C, 4D), and P. pustulosus (data
not shown), PCNA immunopositive cells occupy the
entire cellular layer. The first PCNA immunonegative and
presumably postmitotic cells are seen in the lateral part of
the cellular layer at stages TS 9 in E. coqui (Fig. 4B) and at
stages GH 23–27 in D. pictus (Fig. 4E) and P. pustulosus.
PCNA immunostaining is maintained along the entire
ventricle (Fig. 4C, F) at least until 6 days after hatching in
E. coqui and until the end of metamorphic climax (Go 45)
in D. pictus and P. pustulosus.

Tectal layers are identified by numbers in panels C and F. At
early embryonic stages of both species (A, D), the optic tectum is very small and all tectal cells are PCNA immunoreactive (orange or brown nuclei). At later embryonic stages (B,
E), the tectum of E. coqui has enormously grown in size,
while the tectum of D. pictus is still small (note different magnification). While the entire ventricular layer remains PCNA
immunoreactive, the first non-proliferating cells are evident
(arrows). At hatching, the tectum of E. coqui (C) resembles

surface. Bar: 100 μm in all panels.

Cell proliferation in retina and optic tectum
Proliferating cells were visualized in paraffine sections of
E. coqui, D. pictus and P. pustulosus by immunostaining for
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is transiently expressed in the S phase of the cell cycle [36]. Representative stages are depicted in Figure 2, 3, 4, while the
proliferative index, which measures the proportion of
PCNA positive cells in the cellular layer, is plotted in Figures 2 and 3.

NeuroD expression in retina and optic tectum
In order to compare the time course of neuronal differentiation in retina and tectum between E. coqui and a frog
species with biphasic development, expression of the neuronal differentiation gene NeuroD was analyzed in E. coqui
and X. laevis by in situ hybridization on paraffine sections
of various developmental stages (Fig. 5). In E. coqui, NeuroD begins to be expressed in scattered retinal cells at stage
TS 5, when the retina has already formed an optic cup and
the lens vesicle has detached (Fig. 5A). At subsequent
stages, NeuroD expression extends throughout the retina.
From stage TS 9 on, when the inner plexiform layer
becomes apparent, NeuroD continues to be expressed at
the ciliary margin, the outer part of the inner nuclear layer,
the outer nuclear layer and in scattered cells of the retinal
ganglion cell layer, but is downregulated in the inner central part of the retina (Fig. 5B, C). In X. laevis, onset of NeuroD expression in scattered cells is already observed at
stage NF 23, when the retina has not yet invaginated and
no lens vesicle has formed (Fig. 5D). Subsequently, NeuroD expression extends throughout the retina until the
gene is downregulated in the inner central parts of the retina at stage NF 35/36 (Fig. 5E) simultaneous with the
appearance of the inner plexiform layer. In larval stages,
NeuroD expression is maintained at the ciliary margin, the
outer part of the inner nuclear layer and the outer nuclear
layer, but not in the retinal ganglion cell layer (Fig. 5F)
confirming a previous study [37].

In the optic tectum of E. coqui, NeuroD was never strongly
expressed at any stage of development, although expres-

Neurogenesis in the retina and tectum of E. coqui (A-C, G-I) and X. laevis (D-F, J-L) as revealed by in situ hybridization for NeuroD in
transverse paraffine sections. A-F: At early embryonic stages, NeuroD begins to be expressed in scattered cells throughout the retina in both species
(A, D). Subsequently, most retinal cells express NeuroD, until NeuroD is downregulated in the central, inner part of the retina (asterisks) at midembryonic
stages of both species (B, E). The retina of E. coqui has grown to much larger size at this stage than the retina of X. laevis (note different magnification). At
later stages, NeuroD expression is restricted to the ciliary margin (arrowheads), the outer part of the inner nuclear layer and the outer nuclear layer in
both species (C,F) and to scattered cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer in E. coqui. The inner and outer plexiform layers (black and red arrows, respectively) are much thinner in E. coqui than in X. laevis. G-L: In contrast to X. laevis (J-L), in which the tectum (arrows) expresses NeuroD from stage NF 46
on, the tectum of E. coqui never shows strong NeuroD expression at any stage (G-I) although expression is evident in other parts of the midbrain similar to
X. laevis (asterisks). Abbreviations: INL: inner nuclear layer; IPL: inner plexiform layer; ONL: outer nuclear layer; OPL: outer plexiform layer; PR: layer of

sion was evident in other regions of the midbrain and
elsewhere in the brain (Fig. 5G–I). In contrast, while the
embryonic tectum of X. laevis also does not express NeuroD, tectal NeuroD expression is upregulated from early
tadpole stages (NF 46) on (Fig. 5J–L).
Development of optic projections
The development of the retinofugal projection in E. coqui
and D. pictus (Fig. 6, Table 1) was analyzed in serial sections after unilateral application of biocytin to the optic
nerve at various developmental stages as well as in wholemount brains immunostained for acetylated tubulin to

visualize neurites. The optic projection of both species
conforms to the pattern observed in other frogs and develops in a similar fashion. Therefore, a detailed anatomical
description of its development will not be provided and
only the timing of various events in both species will be
noted.
In E. coqui, the first neurites of retinal ganglion cells grow
out at stage TS 6. These fibers cross to the contralateral side
of the diencephalon in the optic chiasm at stage TS 7. The
majority of labeled fibers there form the marginal optic
tract, which courses dorsad. The first fibers reach the con-

geniculatum thalamicum) and pretectum (uncinate field)
develop from stage TS 13 on. A much smaller number of
fibers courses caudad in the contralateral basal optic tract
from stage TS 11 on and terminates in the basal optic
neuropil in the tegmentum. In addition to the contralateral projections, a few retinofugal fibers are evident in the
ipsilateral marginal optic tract from stage TS 9 on, but no
prominent ipsilateral retinothalamic projections have
developed even at 12 days after hatching.
In D. pictus, outgrowth of the first neurites of retinal ganglion cells occurs at stage GH 22 and these fibers cross in
the optic chiasm, reach the contralateral marginal optic
tract and extend towards the optic tectum by stage GH 23.
At early larval stages (Go 30), the surface of the lateral part
of the rostral half of the tectum is densely covered by retinofugal fibers (Fig. 6E, F). Retinofugal fibers reach the caudal limit of the tectum at stage Go 40 and extend towards
the midline along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the tectum at the end of metamorphic climax (Go 45) (Fig. 6G).
Terminal fields in the contralateral thalamus and pretectum and a small basal optic tract are evident from early
larval stages (stage Go 30, possibly already GH 30) on. A
few fibers in the ipsilateral marginal optic tract are also
observed from stage Go 30 on.
Applications of biocytin to the optic tectum of various
stages of E. coqui and D. pictus allowed to determine that
the first tectofugal fibers develop at stage GH 22 in D. pictus and at stage TS 5 in E. coqui (data not shown), prior to
the ingrowth of retinofugal fibers into the tectum.

Contralateral retinotectal projections in E. coqui (A-C) and D.
pictus (D-F) as revealed by biocytin tracing. At two days before
hatching, the optic projections of E. coqui (A, B) resemble early larvae of
D. pictus (E, F). After crossing in the optic chiasm (OC) the majority of
retinofugal fibers forms the marginal optic tract, which courses dorsally in
the thalamus and forms a first terminal field in the rostral visual nucleus
(RVN; this probably corresponds to the nucleus lateralis of [32]) (A, E).
Retinofugal fibers extend further until the optic tectum and cover approximately its rostral half (B, F). In E. coqui, the density of optic fibers on the
tectal surface (see arrows in magnified inset of B) is much sparser than in
D. pictus. At 12 days after hatching, optic fibers have reached the caudal
end of the tectum in E. coqui, but do not yet extend towards its midline

retinofugal fibers are sparsely distributed over the lateral
part of approximately the rostral half of the tectal surface

12 days after hatching. However, even 12 days after hatching the medial part of the tectum is still free of retinofugal
fibers (Fig. 6C). Terminal fields in the contralateral thalamus (rostral visual nucleus, neuropil of Bellonci, corpus

Development of fiber tracts in the brain
To relate the timing of retinotectal development to the
timing of other differentiation events in the brain, the formation of fiber tracts was studied at various developmental stages of E. coqui, D. pictus, and P. pustulosus in
wholemount brains immunostained for acetylated tubulin. Embryonic brain tracts develop similar to zebrafish
[38,39] and Xenopus embryos [40-42] and were identified
using the nomenclature first established in zebrafish
embryos. The schedule of development of brain tracts and
commissures is given in Table 2 and selected stages are
depicted in Fig. 7.

In E. coqui and D. pictus, three phases of fiber tract development can be recognized (commissures often form
slightly later than the associated fiber tracts). In P. pustulosus, fiber tract development follows a similar time course,
but the earliest phase of brain tract development could
not be observed, because no embryos earlier than stage
GH 20 were investigated. In the first phase of development (TS 4–5 in E. coqui; GH 18 in D. pictus; ≤GH 20 in P.
pustulosus), the tract of the postoptic commissure (TPOC)
develops in the forebrain and continues caudad as the

ventral longitudinal tract (VLT) (Fig. 7A, B). In the hindbrain, the descending tracts of the trigeminal and vestibulocochlear nerves develop. In the second phase of
development (TS 6–7 in E. coqui; GH 20–22 in D. pictus
and P. pustulosus), several additional fiber tracts develop in
the forebrain and midbrain (tract of anterior commissure,
supraoptic tract, tract of posterior commissure, tract of
commissure of posterior tuberculum, tract of ventral tegmental commissure, tract of cerebellar commissure) and

join the pioneering fibers of the TPOC and VLT. In addition, a discrete dorsoventral diencephalic tract (DVDT)
emanating from the epiphysis as a well defined bundle of
fibers forms in D. pictus and P. pustulosus at these stages. In
E. coqui, no such distinct bundle of fibers was observed,
but fibers running ventrad throughout the thalamus
appeared at stage TS 6, a subset of which may correspond
to the DVDT. In the third phase of development (≥ TS 8 in
E. coqui; ≥GH 23–24 in D. pictus and P. pustulosus), the

tract of the habenular commissure joins the axonal scaffold and the intertectal commissure develops. However, at
stage TS 9 in E. coqui and GH 22 in D. pictus only single
fibers crossing between the two tectal hemispheres could
be observed, indicating that the bulk of the intertectal
commissure develops later.

Discussion
Derived mode of retinotectal development in E. coqui
Direct developing frogs are known from 12 different
anuran families [43]. Although phylogenetic relationships among anurans continue to be debated [44-47], the
distribution of direct development on any of the proposed anuran phylogenetic trees indicates that it has
evolved many times independently from an ancestral
biphasic pattern of development.

The development of the retina and tectum in D. pictus and
P. pustulosus as documented here has many similarities
with retinotectal development in other biphasically developing frogs including Rana [48-51]), Limnodynastes
[52,53], and Xenopus, which is particularly well studied
[40,54-68]. Since this pattern of retinotectal development
is shared between neobatrachian frogs (Rana, Limnodynastes, Physalaemus), including the leptodactylid frog
Physalaemus and more basal "archaeobatrachian" lineages
such as discoglossids (Discoglossus) and pipids (Xenopus),
it probably represents the primitive condition for extant
anurans. Thus, the differences in retinotectal development
observed in Eleutherodactylus are derived within this direct
developing clade of leptodactylid frogs.
In the various biphasically developing species, the different retinal layers develop during embryonic development,
when the retina is still small and has reached only a fraction (about one third) of its cross-sectional area at the
completion of metamorphosis. The first retinotectal connections are established during early embryonic development, shortly after the major axon tracts have developed
in the brain (Tables 1, 2). The expression of NeuroD (only
described for Xenopus), which plays a role in regulating
neuronal differentiation and the formation of particular
neuronal subtypes such as photoreceptors and amacrine
cells in the retina [33,34,37,69-75] becomes restricted to
the ciliary margin, the outer part of the inner nuclear layer,
and the outer nuclear layer as soon as the different retinal
layers develop. Proliferation becomes largely restricted to
the ciliary margin at the end of embryonic development,
from which the retina then grows during larval stages by
addition of cells to all cellular layers.
When the first retinofugal fibers reach the contralateral
tectum at late embryonic stages, the latter is still very small
and consists predominantly of proliferating cells. Retinal
fibers cover the tectum in a rostrocaudal direction during

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/9

larval stages, as the optic tectum continues to grow by proliferation from the ventricular layer, which is most pronounced caudomedially. At early larval stages, the first
tectal layers (layer 7–9 and layer 5) differentiate and retinal fibers cover approximately half of the lateral part of
the tectum leaving its midline free of fibers. At this stage
the tectum has reached only a fraction (about one third)
of its size at the completion of metamorphosis. At the end
of metamorphic climax, the entire surface of the tectum is
covered by retinofugal fibers. In addition to the main,
contralateral projection to thalamus, pretectum, and tectum, an ipsilateral projection to thalamus and pretectum,
which subserves important functions for binocular vision
in postmetamorphic frogs, begins to develop at late larval
stages in Xenopus [66,76]. In D. pictus, a sparse ipsilateral
projection develops already at early larval stages.
Retinotectal development in E. coqui has been modified in
a number of respects from this ancestral anuran pattern.
While the spatiotemporal order of differentiation of retinal and tectal layers and the formation of the retinotectal
projection in E. coqui have been conserved, patterns of
growth and proliferation of retina and tectum have been
modified. Both retina and optic tectum grow rapidly during initial formation of the retinotectal projection in
embryonic stages so that at a stage when formation of retinal layers and tectal layers 5–9 are completed, they have
already reached around 90 % of their size at hatching.
While retinal growth in biphasically developing frogs is
mostly due to addition of cells from the proliferative ciliary margin, the retina of E. coqui grows by proliferation of
cells throughout the outer part of the inner nuclear layer
of the retina until it has almost reached its size at hatching
[29]. Thus, although NeuroD expression in the ciliary margin, the outer part of the inner nuclear layer, and the outer
nuclear layer resembles the condition in Xenopus, many
NeuroD expressing cells in the inner nuclear layer of E.
coqui retinae are probably proliferating progenitor cells in
contrast to Xenopus. NeuroD expression in some retinal
ganglion cells and absence of NeuroD expression in the
tectum of E. coqui also differ from X. laevis, suggesting that
some of the functions of NeuroD have changed during
evolution of E. coqui. A sparse ipsilateral retinothalamic
projection develops already at embryonic stage TS 9, prior
to completion of retinal layer formation and, thus, significantly earlier than in biphasically developing frogs. This
may represent an adaptive heterochronic shift related to
precocious adoption of postmetamorphic head shape and
eye position in E. coqui, allowing onset of binocular vision
already at hatching stages when the optic tectum is still in
a relatively immature, larval-like state (note dissociation
between suites XI/XII indicating cranial remodeling and
suite II indicating retinotectal differentiation in Fig. 1).

Dissociation of growth and differentiation during E. coqui
retinotectal development
The modified pattern of retinotectal development in E.
coqui indicates that the regulation of growth and differentiation have been dissociated during evolution of Eleutherodactylus as discussed in [21] (compare suites III/IV
with suite II in Fig. 1). Growth has been greatly accelerated
by increased cell proliferation, while the timing of early
retinotectal differentiation events has been conserved and
remains temporally coordinated with early cranial and
spinal development (compare suites IX, V, and II in Fig.
1).

In biphasically developing anurans such as Xenopus, thyroid hormones have been implicated in promoting
increased proliferation in the retina during mid-larval
stages after the thyroid gland develops and thyroid hormone levels rise [77,78]. However, the precocious growth
of retina and tectum in E. coqui is unlikely to be due to the
precocious action of thyroid hormones, because acceleration of retinal and tectal growth is observed from early
embryonic stages on, long before the thyroid gland
matures and the thyroid axis becomes functional around
stage TS 10 in E. coqui [30,31]. Although the mechanisms
underlying the increase in proliferation in E. coqui remain
at present obscure, the conserved schedule of retinotectal
differentiation implies that increased proliferation is not
simply due to a general delay in neural differentiation.
Changes in the probability of cell cycle exit or the length
of cell cycles are better compatible with the pattern
observed.
As a consequence of the rapid growth of retina and tectum
during the development of the retinotectal projection,
retinofugal fibers in E. coqui encounter a much larger target territory as they enter and distribute over the tectum
than in biphasically developing frogs. This raises the question, whether the formation of a topographic map of retinal fibers on the tectal surface, as known from other
vertebrates, may be compromised in E. coqui. However,
the formation of retinotopic maps, which is now known
to involve gradients of Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands in retina and tectum, is very plastic and can expand
or contract in response to drastic experimental reductions
of retinal or tectal size, respectively [79,80]. In many
fishes and amphibians plastic mechanisms of map formation are important to maintain an ordered retinotopic
map throughout development, because their tectum
grows in a rostrocaudal direction, while new retinal neurons are added in a radial direction [57,65,81]. This plasticity probably permitted the drastic acceleration of
retinotectal growth in Eleutherodactylus without compromising the ability to form a well ordered retinotopic map.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/9

Increased proliferation and accelerated growth in E. coqui
is not confined to the retina and tectum, but is also evident in other parts of the CNS such as the spinal cord [28]
and the brain stem (Schlosser, unpublished observation)
(compare suites III, IV, and VIII in Fig. 1). This suggests
that altered growth patterns in E. coqui may be due to systemic regulatory changes affecting proliferation of neural
progenitors throughout the CNS, although independent
regulatory changes in different parts of the CNS cannot be
ruled out.
Mosaic evolution of CNS development in E. coqui
Despite altered growth patterns, the schedules of retinal
and tectal differentiation and of the formation of retinotectal projections are conserved and remain coordinated
with each other and with the formation of early axon
tracts in the brain in E. coqui (compare suites II and I in
Fig. 1) probaby reflecting their interdependent development for example due to coordinated axon outgrowth. For
example, fibers in the tract of the postoptic commissure
(TPOC), which is the earliest tract to develop in the
embryonic brain, later fasciculate with fibers from multiple other brain tracts as well as with retinofugal fibers.
This has led to suggestions that fibers of the TPOC may
serve as pioneer axons, on which other brain tracts and
retinofugal fibers depend for proper axonal pathfinding
[38-41,67,82,83]. However, other studies have shown
that retinofugal fibers can properly navigate towards the
tectum independent of the TPOC [84,85] suggesting that
both TPOC and other fiber tracts including retinofugal
fibers may instead follow common pathway cues and,
thus, may form in a temporally coordinated fashion once
their pathways become established.

Although schedules of retinotectal differentiation and the
formation of early brain tracts remain tightly coordinated
with each other in E. coqui, they have become dissociated
from differentiation in other parts of the central and
peripheral nervous system. For example, the lateral motor
columns (LMCs) in the spinal cord develop precociously
in E. coqui paralleling precocious development of the
limbs, which they innervate [22-25,27,28]. As a consequence, in E. coqui LMCs develop simultaneous with the
retinotectal system, while in biphasically developing frogs
they develop in larval stages after differentiation of most
retinal and tectal layers is completed (compare suites VII
and II in Fig. 1). Similarly, adult-like cranial skeletal structures and muscles together with their motor innervation
precociously differentiate in E. coqui in stages
[9,13,16,18,19,21], when the retinotectal system is still in
an immature, larva-like condition (compare suites XI/XII
and II in Fig. 1).
Taken together, this indicates that during evolution of
Eleutherodactylus, the schedule of differentiation in CNS

Frontiers in Zoology 2008, 5:9

areas remained coordinated with the schedule of differentiation of those regions in the CNS or in the periphery,
with which they are directly connected (retina-tectumbrain tracts, LMC-limbs, cranial motor neurons-cranial
muscles), whereas profound temporal dissociations have
taken place between structures that are not or only indirectly connected.

labels all neurites, followed by a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and incubation in diaminobenzidine
(DAB) as previously described [89,90]. For PCNA immunostaining on sections, embryos and larvae of D. pictus, P.
pustulosus, and E. coqui were fixed in Bouin's fixative, dehydrated, paraffin embedded, and serially sectioned (10–15
μm). PCNA immunostaining was performed as previously
described [28].

Conclusion
Previous studies have shown that limbs, spinal cord, and
the cranial musculoskeletal system develop precociously
in direct developing frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus.
The present study indicates that retinotectal development
was also modified during evolution of Eleutherodactlyus.
Cell proliferation and growth in retina and tectum have
been greatly accelerated in Eleutherodactylus, while differentiation of retina, tectum, and fiber tracts in the embryonic brain, which remain temporally coordinated with
each other, proceed along a much slower schedule. Consequently, Eleutherodactylus hatchlings appear like postmetamorphic froglets with respect to limb, spinal cord,
and cranial development and have a correspondingly
large brain, while their retinotectal system is still immature and tadpole-like. This suggests that differentiation
events in directly interconnected parts of the CNS such as
retina and tectum remain coordinated during evolution,
while they may be dissociated from proliferation control
and from differentiation events in other parts of the CNS
probably reflecting the modular character of CNS development.

Methods
Animals
Different developmental stages of Eleutherodactylus coqui
and Discoglossus pictus were obtained by natural matings in
breeding colonies maintained at the institute. E. coqui
embryos were staged after Townsend and Stewart (1985)
(TS). D. pictus embryos were staged after Gallien and
Houillon (GH) [86] for embryonic stages and Gosner
(Go) [87] for larval and metamorphic stages. Different
developmental stages of Physalaemus pustulosus were collected at various localities in Costa Rica and staged after
[86] for embryonic stages and [87] for more advanced
stages. Embryos of Xenopus laevis were obtained by in vitro
fertilization using standard methods and staged according
to Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) [88]. Larvae and metamorphic stages were anesthesized in tricaine methane-sulfonate (MS 222; Sigma) prior to fixation.
Immunohistochemistry
For wholemount immunostaining, embryos of D. pictus,
P. pustulosus, and E. coqui were fixed in Dent's fixative
(80% methanol, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide) and brains
were dissected out. Brain tracts were visualized by an antiacetylated tubulin antibody (6–11B-1; Sigma), which

In situ hybridization
After overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embryos and larvae of E. coqui and X. laevis were dehydrated, paraffin embedded and serially sectioned (10
μm). In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled
probes against E. coqui NeuroD (EcNeuroD, [20]) and X.
laevis NeuroD (XNeuroD, [91]) were performed on paraffin
sections following standard procedures [20,92]. The
hybridization step was carried out overnight at 55°C and
the color reaction was allowed to proceed for 15–30 h.
Some sections were counterstained with 1% neutral red.
Morphometry
The volume of the optic tectum was calculated from measurements of its cross-sectional area in regularly spaced sections through the optic tectum. Cross-sectional area was
determined with a graphic table in camera lucida drawings of PCNA-labeled transverse paraffin sections (see
above). The entire cross-sectional area (excluding the ventricle), the area of the entire cellular layers (additionally
excluding tectal layers 7–9, which are dominated by fibers) as well as the area of the PCNA positive part of the cellular layer were measured in 1–3 individuals per stage. A
proliferative index was calculated by dividing the PCNA
positive volume by the volume of the entire cellular layer.
Tracing of retinofugal and tectofugal projections
Tracing studies were performed at different developmental stages of D. pictus and E. coqui. For tracing of retinofugal projections, the eye was unilaterally extirpated and a
biocytin (Sigma) crystal was then applied to the site of
lesion. For tracing of tectofugal projections, a biocytin
crystal was inserted rostrally into one half of the optic tectum. Larvae and metamorphic stages were anesthesized in
tricaine methane-sulfonate (MS 222; Sigma) prior to surgery. After a survival time of approximately 5 hours, animals
were
fixed
in
2%
glutaraldehyde/2%
paraformaldehyde. After embedding in 4% agar, 50 μm
vibratome sections were cut and the tracer was revealed as
previously described [19]. Sections were counterstained
with nuclear fast red, dehydrated and coverslipped.
