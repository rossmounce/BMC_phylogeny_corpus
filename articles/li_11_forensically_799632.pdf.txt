Forensically informative nucleotide sequencing
(FINS) for the authentication of Chinese medicinal
materials
Ming Li1, Kalin Yan-Bo Zhang2, Paul Pui-Hay But3 and Pang-Chui Shaw1,3*

Abstract
Chinese medicinal materials may be authenticated by molecular identification. As a definitive approach to
molecular identification of medicinal materials, forensically informative nucleotide sequencing (FINS) comprises four
steps, namely (1) DNA extraction from biological samples, (2) selection and amplification of a specific DNA
fragment, (3) determination of the sequence of the amplified DNA fragment and (4) cladistic analysis of the sample
DNA sequence against a DNA database. Success of the FINS identification depends on the selection of DNA region
and reference species. This article describes the techniques and applications of FINS for authenticating Chinese
medicinal materials.
Background
World Health Organization estimates that 70-80% of the
population in the developed countries have used some
forms of alternative or complementary medicine [1].
Adulteration and misuse of Chinese medicinal products
may be due to (a) accidental substitution due to the
similarity of organoleptic characters, (b) inconsistent
naming in local areas, (c) intentional substitution of
expensive materials by less expensive items and (d) different use of substitutes in local areas. Conventional
authentication methods based on organoleptic features
and chemical constituents are influenced by various factors such as growing stages, environmental factors and
post-harvest processing.
Molecular techniques have been employed to authenticate medicinal materials since the mid 1990s [2].
Molecular techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting,
DNA sequencing and DNA microarray, have been
applied extensively to authenticate Chinese medicinal
materials with a number of these applications having
been patented and commercialized [3]. DNA sequencing
can retrieve the maximum molecular information from
a particular DNA region. Polymorphism of nucleotide

sequences provides information to distinguish closely
related species from distantly related species and
between genuine medicinal materials and adulterants.
Forensically informative nucleotide sequencing (FINS),
a technique that combines DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, is used to identify samples based on
informative nucleotide sequences. The concept of FINS
was first proposed by Bartlett and Davidson in 1992 to
identify the origin of animal food products and has
since been extensively applied in forensic investigations
[4,5]. In the past decade, FINS has been applied to identify and authenticate the Chinese medicinal materials
with species-specific DNA regions [6-8].
This article describes the techniques and applications
of FINS in authenticating Chinese medicinal materials.

Performing FINS
A defined DNA sequence from examined specimen is
obtained and compared with suitable reference
sequences from a reliable database using a phylogenetic
analysis to identify the tested material [4]. Four basic
steps are involved in FINS, namely (1) DNA extraction
from biological samples, (2) selection and amplification
of a specific DNA fragment, (3) determination of
nucleotide sequences and (4) identification using a phylogenetic analysis against a sequence database. Materials
used to construct the reference database should be
properly identified fresh materials or authentic preserved

specimens. The total DNA can be isolated by either
DNA extraction or DNA release [9]. A general workflow
of FINS is given in Figure 1.
DNA extraction from biological samples

DNA extraction refers to an invasive method that
extracts DNA from tissues and cells via physical disruption and/or chemical fractionation. Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and phenol/chloroform
extraction [10] was employed by a number of commercial kits for DNA extraction. For example, DNA from

Page 2 of 6

highly processed Chinese medicinal materials, such as
the mule skin extract Asini Corii Colla (Ejiao) [11].
DNA release, a non-invasive method that allows DNA
to release from a sample into a solution without
destruction, is particularly useful for obtaining DNA
from important voucher specimens. DNA release is also
used to investigate samples by analyzing the environmental DNA or the preservative, as demonstrated by
recent studies of DNA detection from the water in
which frogs (Rana catesbeiana) live and from worms
(Hypopta agavis) preserved in 95% ethanol [12,13]. The
quantity and quality of the obtained DNA is a major
concern with this method. While purification may be
achieved by commercially available kits, the yield of
DNA is quite minute and should be stored in safe conditions (freezing, cyanide and ethanol), certain chemicals
that can damage DNA, such as ethyl acetate or formaldehyde, should be avoided [14].
Selection and amplification of a specific DNA fragment

Figure 1 Schematic diagram showing the workflow of the
construction of reference database and FINS identification.

Usually, only a small amount of DNA can be extracted
or released from highly processed or improperly stored
Chinese medicinal materials. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) can produce a sufficient amount of a specific
DNA fragment obtained from a tiny amount of DNA
extract. The selection of a DNA region for amplification
is one of the crucial factors for FINS because the resolution of FINS depends heavily on the variability and the
number of informative sites of the DNA sequences of
the tested samples and reference materials. As the evolutionary rates of different DNA regions vary, DNA
regions with sufficient variability are essential for providing a high resolution result. Rapidly evolving regions
among taxonomic groups can be used for the identification at the genus or species level. Slowly evolving
regions among groups can be used to differentiate at the
section or family level. An ideal DNA region for identifying Chinese medicinal materials should have high
inter-specific variation but low intra-specific variation
and have sufficient informative polymorphic sites to
allow differential sequence alignment among the samples and the reference species. The evolutionary rate of
the same DNA region may vary among animals, plants
and fungi. For example, mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 1 (COI) is suitable for the identification
of specific animal species [15]; however, it is not suitable
for most plants as few polymorphic sites are found
across the 1.4 kb COI sequences [16], probably due to
the slow mutation rate [17]. Thus, prior knowledge of
the evolutionary rates of various DNA regions facilitates
the selection of an appropriate DNA region. In the past
few years, short DNA sequences for global barcoding of
species have been proposed [15]. For example, the DNA
barcodes for animals is COI and for fungi is ITS; the

Li et al. Chinese Medicine 2011, 6:42

core DNA barcodes for plants are chloroplast large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene (rbcL)
and chloroplast maturase K coding region (matK), while
chloroplast trnH-psbA intergenic spacer (trnH-psbA)
and nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) are supplementary DNA barcodes for plants [15,18,19]. Recent
studies suggested that ITS should be incorporated into
the core DNA barcode for seed plants [20-22]. These
DNA barcodes have also been commonly applied to
identify medicinal materials and should be considered as
the primary DNA target region for FINS [23]. Chinese
medicinal materials are often dried or processed, which
may affect the quality and quantity of the extractable
DNA. A shorter DNA region should be considered for
samples with degraded DNA. The universal primers for
PCR amplification of some commonly used regions in
FINS are listed in Table 1.
Determination of nucleotide sequences

DNA sequencing is the most direct approach to obtaining maximum genetic information of the amplified DNA
regions. With significantly lowered costs and time, DNA

sequencing is now routinely used to identify medicinal
materials. The amplified and purified DNA fragments
may be sequenced directly; however, molecular cloning
may be applied in some cases. Cloning is required if (1)
some DNA regions (e.g. ITS and 5S rRNA gene spacer)
have non-homogenous multiple copies or secondary
structures [24,25]; (2) non-specific PCR amplification
generates multiple amplicons of similar size; (3) there is
simultaneous amplification of DNA from samples and
fungal contaminants (e.g. due to improper storage) and
(4) there is poly-A/T structure (e.g. in trnH-psbA) interfering with the DNA sequencing [26].
Phylogenetic analysis with reference to a sequence
database

A sequence database is necessary because a successful
application of FINS relies on the comparison of DNA
sequences among the samples and reference species.
Phylogenetic analyses of many taxa using various DNA
regions have been performed, providing useful reference
for FINS. Our group has recently constructed an online

www.cuhk.edu.hk/icm/mmdbd.htm, which contains over
20,000 DNA sequences of 1,300 medicinal species found
in the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China
and the United States Pharmacopoeia [27]. DNA
sequences can also be found in the open access NCBI
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank, EMBL
Nucleotide Sequence Database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
embl as well as the Chloroplast Genome Database
http://chloroplast.cbio.psu.edu. With the vast amount of
sequence data, it is possible to roughly identify any
unknown sample even if the sequence of its source species is not yet available. However, the quality of publicly
available DNA sequences could sometimes be incorrect
or derived from wrongly identified species [6,28,29].
Generation of tailor-made reference sequences is essential if the concerned reference sequences do not exist
and high resolution identification is required.
The original idea of FINS is to perform phylogenetic
analysis of unknown samples together with the reference
species to trace their source origin [4], which is different
from molecular identification based solely on multiple
sequence alignment and comparison of polymorphic
sites. FINS emphasizes the use of phylogenetic analysis
to identify species via phylograms [4]. In general, phylogenetic analysis carefully selects sequence alignment to
find the informative homologous sites for subsequent
analysis. Phylogenetic trees are then constructed using
tree construction methods, such as maximum parsimony
(MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analysis,
to reflect the evolutionary history of the concerned taxa.
Available computer programs for constructing multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis are AlignM, ClustalW, BioEdit, PAUP and MEGA [30].
To identify medicinal materials, FINS users would
rather identify a sample than its phylogenetic relationship with the reference species. The topology of the
phylogram is the major concern and the phylogenetic
relationship among the reference species is less focused
in FINS identification. It was suggested that DNA distance-based methods are preferred to phylogeny-based
methods in the application of FINS for identification
[31]. The DNA distance-based method provides similarities between the reference and the unknown species
whereas the phylogeny-based method explores the evolutionary history of the species. The major difference
between these two methods lies in the way that the
DNA sequences are analyzed. Phylogenetic relationship
analysis, such as maximum parsimony and maximum
likelihood, uses a matrix of discrete phylogenetic informative characters or statistical models to infer the optimal phylogenetic trees of selected taxa. Distance-matrix
methods, such as unweighed pair-group mean analysis
(UPGMA) and neighbor-joining (NJ), calculate the
genetic distance from multiple sequence alignments to

Page 4 of 6

determine the similarities among reference sequences. A
cladogram is then constructed based on the pair-wise
distance values to build up the relationship of similarity.
The distance-matrix methods are simple to implement
and do not invoke any evolutionary indications because
similar looking species may not necessarily be phylogenetically related (i.e. convergent evolution).
Applications of FINS in Chinese medicinal materials

Over 800 medicinal species are officially recorded in the
Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China [32].
Some of these Chinese medicinal materials are economically important and ecologically valuable, such as Dendrobii Caulis (Shihu), while some others are highly toxic,
such as Aristolochiae Fructus (Madouling) and Radix
Tripterygii Wilfordii (Leigongteng). FINS is one of the
most definitive methods to ensure they are used safely
and to protect consumers from adulteration. Over the
years, FINS has been used to identify economically
important materials and ecologically valuable species, as
well as toxic and commonly used Chinese medicinal
materials. Examples of the identification of these Chinese
medicinal materials using FINS are given in Table 2.

Requirements for FINS used to authenticate
Chinese medicinal materials
FINS has four major requirements on its application in
identifying Chinese medicinal materials. Firstly, the success of FINS identification is highly dependent on the
quality and amount of the reference sequences [6,28,29].
Confirmation of the authenticity of the reference
sequences or generation of tailor-made sequences may
be costly and time-consuming. Secondly, FINS requires
a reference database to identify any single Chinese medicinal material. Therefore, it is important to select and/
or construct various databases with different reference
species and different DNA regions to identify a mixture
of Chinese medicinal materials. Thirdly, similar to other
molecular identification techniques, FINS requires sufficient amount of good quality DNA. Some Chinese medicinal materials are derived from various plant parts
with low DNA content and that were highly processed
(e.g. by heat, boil or sun-dry). As a result, DNA can be
damaged to the point where only very short fragments
(< 200 base pair) are left [11,33]. These short DNA fragments may not possess sufficient informative characters
for high resolution FINS identification. ITS2 may be a
good region for FINS because of its small size (200-300
base pair) and its high variability in plants and animals
[20], although molecular cloning is needed to overcome
the problem of multiple copies and secondary structure
[24,25]. Fourthly, contamination of fungal species is
common in Chinese medicinal materials. Specific primers are required for the materials without the
