Abstract
Background: The syndecans are the major family of transmembrane proteoglycans in animals and are
known for multiple roles in cell interactions and growth factor signalling during development, inflammatory
response, wound-repair and tumorigenesis. Although syndecans have been cloned from several
invertebrate and vertebrate species, the extent of conservation of the family across the animal kingdom is
unknown and there are gaps in our knowledge of chordate syndecans. Here, we develop a new level of
knowledge for the whole syndecan family, by combining molecular phylogeny of syndecan protein
sequences with analysis of the genomic contexts of syndecan genes in multiple vertebrate organisms.
Results: We identified syndecan-encoding sequences in representative Cnidaria and throughout the
Bilateria. The C1 and C2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain are highly conserved throughout the animal
kingdom. We identified in the variable region a universally-conserved leucine residue and a tyrosine
residue that is conserved throughout the Bilateria. Of all the genomes examined, only tetrapod and fish
genomes encode multiple syndecans. No syndecan-1 was identified in fish. The genomic context of each
vertebrate syndecan gene is syntenic between human, mouse and chicken, and this conservation clearly
extends to syndecan-2 and -3 in T. nigroviridis. In addition, tetrapod syndecans were found to be encoded
from paralogous chromosomal regions that also contain the four members of the matrilin family. Whereas
the matrilin-3 and syndecan-1 genes are adjacent in tetrapods, this chromosomal region appears to have
undergone extensive lineage-specific rearrangements in fish.
Conclusion: Throughout the animal kingdom, syndecan extracellular domains have undergone rapid
change and elements of the cytoplasmic domains have been very conserved. The four syndecan genes of
vertebrates are syntenic across tetrapods, and synteny of the syndecan-2 and -3 genes is apparent between
tetrapods and fish. In vertebrates, each of the four family members are encoded from paralogous genomic
regions in which members of the matrilin family are also syntenic between tetrapods and fish. This genomic
organization appears to have been set up after the divergence of urochordates (Ciona) and vertebrates.
The syndecan-1 gene appears to have been lost relatively early in the fish lineage. These conclusions
provide the basis for a new model of syndecan evolution in vertebrates and a new perspective for analyzing
the roles of syndecans in cells and whole organisms.

Background
Proteoglycans are important and ancient mediators of cell
interactions in metazoan organisms. In the simplest multicellular animals, sponges, extracellular proteoglycans
contribute to adhesion between cells and processes of selfrecognition and host defence [1,2]. The syndecans are the
only major family of transmembrane proteoglycans and
are conserved in metazoa from nematode worms to man.
The genomes of invertebrates such as C. elegans and D.
melanogaster contain a single syndecan gene, whereas
mammalian genomes contain four syndecan genes [3,4].
In all the organisms in which they have been studied, syndecans have important roles in cell interactions, adhesion,
migration and receptor signaling. The single syndecans of
C. elegans and D. melanogaster are required for proper axon
guidance during development of the nervous system [58]. C. elegans syndecan also functions in vulval development [9]. The vertebrate syndecans each have distinct tissue expression patterns and distinct functional attributes.
For example, syndecan-1 is expressed in epithelia and certain mesenchymal cells. Syndecan-1 null mice show deficits in cell migration behaviors associated with
inflammatory response and wound-healing [10,11]. In
single cells, syndecan-1 activates formation of filopodia
and lamellipodia that mediate cell motility [12,13]. Syndecan-2 is expressed by mesenchymal, liver and neuronal
cells. It participates in the development of the left/right
body axis during Xenopus development [14], has been
identified to function in the assembly of neuronal dendritic spines and in ECM assembly in mammalian systems, and is essential for angiogenesis in zebrafish [1517]. Syndecan-3 is mostly expressed in the nervous system
and is important in hippocampal function, particularly in
controlling feeding behavior and hippocampus-dependent memory [18,19]. Syndecan-4 is broadly expressed by
many tissues and cell types and has specific signaling roles
as an integrin co-receptor in the assembly of focal adhesions. It also contributes to angiogenesis and wound-healing in mice [4,20,21].
In mammals, syndecans have significant clinical relevance
in the pathologies of infection, cancer and wound repair.
Syndecan-1 is a receptor for human immunodeficiency
virus in cell culture [22] and contributes to the pathology
of infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
aureus [23-25]. Syndecan-1 deficient mice have increased
resistance to wingless-1-mediated tumorigenesis [26].
Altered expression of syndecan-1 has been documented in
many human carcinomas, lymphomas and in multiple
myeloma; in multiple myeloma syndecan-1 has been proposed for clinical use as a prognostic marker [27-34].
Other studies have implicated syndecans in tissue repair.
Thus, the lack of syndecan-1 or -4 in mice results in
impaired inflammatory responses, wound-healing, and
angiogenesis [10,21,35]. Studies in animal models have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/83

demonstrated increased expression of syndecan-1, -3 and
-4 after cardiac injury, indicating possible roles in cardiac
remodeling [36-38].
In structure, all syndecans consist of an extracellular
domain with sites for attachment of glycosaminoglycan
(GAG) sidechains, a single transmembrane domain and a
short cytoplasmic domain. Through their GAG chains,
syndecans act as co-receptors for the cell-surface binding
of heparin-binding growth factors such as bFGFs (basis
fibroblast growth factor) and Wnt (wingless) [3,4,26,39].
The activity of invertebrate syndecans in axon guidance
depends on co-receptor activity in the slit/Robo pathway
[5,8]. Direct protein-protein interactions of the extracellular domain have also been implied for syndecan-1 and -4
[40]. Based on comparisons of mammalian, C. elegans
and D. melanogaster syndecans, the cytoplasmic domains
are recognized to contain two conserved regions, designated C1 and C2, that are present in all these syndecans,
and a central variable, (V), region that is unique to each
form of syndecan. The V regions themselves are very
highly conserved between species orthologues of syndecans -1 to -4, suggestive of important specific functions
[3,4]. In general, the cytoplasmic domains participate in
the assembly of juxtamembrane complexes that regulate
cell signaling and the organizational state of the actin
cytoskeleton. The C2 region binds PDZ-containing proteins that form multiprotein scaffolds by oligomerization
and which also mediate syndecan recycling [41]. Cask, src
tyrosine kinase and synectin are known binding partners
of the C1 region. The V regions have been most intensively studied in syndecan-2 and syndecan-4, and have
specific binding partners that contribute to cell signaling
that regulates cytoskeletal structures [3,4,15]. On the basis
of their protein sequences, the four mammalian syndecans group into two pairs: syndecan-1 and -3 have higher
sequence identity with each other, as do syndecan-2 and
syndecan-4 [3,4].
To date, the relationships of invertebrate and vertebrate
syndecans have been considered only at the level of their
protein sequences. With regard to these analyzes, there are
gaps in our knowledge of chordate syndecans, as the most
intensive studies have focused on mammalian and
amphibian syndecans [e.g., [3,4,10,11,14,18,20,21]].
Invertebrate syndecans have been experimentally studied
in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, but little is known about
other invertebrate syndecans. It is now recognized that the
genomes of D. melanogaster and C. elegans have evolved
rapidly with extensive gene loss [42,43]. Thus, one purpose of our study was to capitalize on the recent sequencing of the genomes of the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis,
the chicken and three species of fish, along with the
expanded knowledge from the genomes of the sea urchin

toma floridae, multiple representatives of the Cnidaria, and
the many expressed sequence tag projects directed to
invertebrate species, to obtain a comprehensive view of
this important proteoglycan family at protein sequence
level. A second purpose has been to develop a new level of
knowledge for the whole syndecan family, by analyzing
the genomic contexts of syndecan genes in multiple
organisms. The comparative genomics of gene families is
a powerful approach to understanding the relationships
between the members of multigene families, either within
a single genome or through comparison of the conservation of genomic context across the genomes of multiple

organisms. In addition, ideas about the origins of gene
families can be clarified through the study of the genomes
of modern animals from different phyla. The insights
obtained from comparative genomics are relevant to making choices of model organisms for experimental purposes and may advance understanding of the roles of gene
families at systems level [44].

Amino acid sequences of human syndecans were used to conduct BlastP searches against the Uniprot database. Conservation scores of relevant
retrieved hits (representative of invertebrate, urochordate, fish and amphibian) were then calculated [92]. Dashes indicate searches for which no hit
with syndecan-3 was retrieved.

Molecular phylogeny of syndecans across the animal
kingdom
Our searches of recently completed genome sequences
and the database of expressed sequence tags produced an
expanded dataset of syndecans that demonstrates remarkable conservation of this proteoglycan family across the
animal kingdom. Syndecans were identified in multiple
species of Cnidaria as well as throughout the Bilateria. The
genomes of Ciona intestinalis, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus
and amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) encode single
syndecans and multiple syndecans are encoded in fish
and other vertebrate genomes (Table 1). However, no syndecan-1 sequence was identified in fish, nonwithstanding
extensive searches of three fish genomes and the large
database of expressed sequence tags from many teleost
fish species.

The sequence relationships of selected invertebrate and
fish syndecans to human syndecans were examined by
calculating WU-BLASTP conservation scores [45]. X. laevis
syndecans were included for comparison. Whereas each of
the X. laevis and T. nigroviridis syndecans was clearly most
closely related to one of the human syndecans (e.g., T.
nigroviridis syndecan-3 has the highest score with human
syndecan-3, etc), each of the invertebrate syndecans had
similar low conservation scores with all the human syndecans and in some cases no hit was obtained (Table 2). This
suggests that the sequences of invertebrate syndecans are
similarly related to all four of the vertebrate syndecans.
The cytoplasmic domains have been recognized as the
most conserved region of syndecan protein sequences
[3,4]. To examine the conservation of cytoplasmic
domains across the new dataset, we aligned the sequences
by the CLUSTALW progressive local alignment method
[46]. The alignment demonstrated near complete conservation of the C1 region in all syndecans, with some variation at the second and third positions in the vertebrate
syndecan-2 group, D. rerio syndecan-4, and many of the
invertebrate syndecans (Figure 1). The C2 region is almost
universally conserved in Bilateria as EFYA, with the exception of Ciona syndecans that contain EYYA and fish syndecan-4s that contain EIYA. Greater variability of the C2
motif is evident in the Cnidaria (Figure 1). All of these variants are predicted to be functional PDZ-binding motifs
[47].
The alignment also demonstrated that the invertebrate
syndecans from different phyla contain distinctive V
regions, all of which are different from those of syndecan1, -2, -3 and -4. In vertebrate syndecans, the syndecan-4 V
region is well-conserved between fish and tetrapods. In
the syndecan-2 group, the V region of D. rerio syndecan-2
is very similar to that of tetrapod syndecan-2s, whereas in

T. nigroviridis the central hypervariable region is distinct at
3 residues. The V regions of syndecan-3s are well-conserved between fish, chicken, mouse and human, yet the
V region of the Xenopus syndecan-3s have unique features
that result in a separate clustering in the sequence alignment (Figure 1). Most strikingly, the alignment highlighted the universal conservation of the first leucine
residue in the V regions of all animals. A single tyrosine
residue is also very well-conserved across the Bilateria but
is not present in any of the V regions from the Cnidaria
(asterisks in Figure 1).
To compare all the full-length sequences in the dataset, we
used the TCOFFEE alignment algorithm that combines
pairwise/global and local alignment methods into a single
model and is more accurate than CLUSTALW for
sequences of lower identity [48]. The Phylip distance
matrix output was used to prepare an unrooted tree. This
analysis confirmed the absence of syndecan-1 from the
fish species. Fish and amphibian syndecan-2, -3 and -4 all
grouped clearly with their tetrapod counterparts. Each set
of syndecan-1, -2, 3- and -4 sequences formed a distinct
group within the phylogenetic diagram, and the syndecan-2 and -4 groups appeared more closely related to each
other than to other syndecans. X. laevis syndecan-1 has
unusual histidine-rich sequence features [49] and therefore forms an deep-branching node with tetrapod syndecan-1s; nevertheless the syndecan-1 grouping was clear
(Figure 2; the sequence of X. tropicalis syndecan-1 is similar to that of X. laevis; X. tropicalis syndecan-1 is present on
scaffold 100 in genome assembly 4.1) [50].
To evaluate the robustness of these groupings, further
analyses of the full-length sequences and the cytoplasmic
domains were conducted using the program PHYML, that
estimates phylogenies based on the maximum-likelihood
principle [51], with inclusion of bootstrap analysis [52].
The unrooted tree derived from the full-length sequences
confirmed the distinct groupings of the sets of syndecan1, -2, -3 and -4 and also demonstrated the syndecan-1/
syndecan-3 and syndecan-2/syndecan-4 pairings. These
topologies were supported by robust bootstrap values (at

least 67%, with the exception of the G. gallus /X. laevis syndecan-1 node) (Figure 3A). However, the positioning of
invertebrate syndecans relative to vertebrate syndecans
was not well supported, likely due to the extent of divergence of their extracellular domain sequences (Figure 3A).
Most of the subgroupings within the invertebrates
appeared biologically meaningful and were well-supported by the bootstrap analysis, with the exception of the
placements of the amphioxus sequence at a node with
Cnidarian syndecans and C. elegans at a node with echinoderm syndecans (Figure 3A). It is likely that these anomalies are an artifact of long branch attraction. At present,
there are no additional cephalochordate or nematode syndecan sequences to include in the dataset. The same general topologies for the vertebrate syndecans were
supported in the tree prepared from the cytoplasmic
domains. Again, not all nodes within the invertebrate syndecan group were biologically meaningful -M. japonicus
syndecan was placed as a outgroup of the Cnidaria â and
the central nodes between vertebrate and invertebrate syndecans were not robust (Figure 3B). In summary, the multiple molecular phylogenetic methods of analysis of
syndecan protein sequences support the pairings of syndecan-1 with syndecan-3, and syndecan-2 with syndecan-4,
and indicate that the invertebrate syndecans are distantly
and equivalently related to the four vertebrate syndecans.
Vertebrate syndecan genes show extensive conservation of
synteny
To obtain a clearer perspective on the relationships of the
four vertebrate syndecans, we evaluated the vertebrate
syndecan gene family at genomic level by comparing the
conservation of the gene neighbors of each syndecan gene
between the mapped genomes of human, mouse, chicken
and, where available, fish. In each genome, each syndecan
gene is located on a different chromosome. For each family member, a set of conserved gene neighbors could be
identified. For the syndecan-1 gene, six local neighboring
genes (HS1BP, RHOB, PUM2, LAPTM4A, MATN3 and
WDR35) and, more remotely, KCNS3, were conserved in
all three species (Figure 4A).

For the syndecan-2 gene, STK3 and PGCP were conserved
as neighbouring genes in human, chicken and mouse.
TSPYL5, LAPTM4B, MATN2 and KCNS2 genes were also
conserved between human and mouse and PTDSS1,
GDF16 and TP53INP were also conserved between
human and chicken (Figure 4B). In comparing the locus
of the syndecan-2 gene in T. nigroviridis, PGCP was also
conserved as a neighboring gene (Figure 4B). MATN2 was
not present in this region, but additional searches identified that it is indeed encoded on chromosome 8 (discussed further below). In D. rerio, the syndecan-2 gene on
chromosome 5 has no gene neighbors in common with
those of tetrapods or T. nigroviridis, and we infer that this
gene underwent a lineage-specific transposition (data not
shown).
PUM1 and MATN1 were conserved gene neighbors of the
syndecan-3 gene in human, mouse, chicken and T. nigroviridis, and MATN1 also mapped adjacent to D. rerio SDC3
(Figure 4C). The most extensive local synteny was
between human and mouse: TDE2l, FABP3, LAPTM5 and
PTPRU were all conserved as local gene neighbors (Figure
4C). Of these genes, FABP3 was also identified to be syntenic with SDC3 in T. nigroviridis. The gene encoding the
tyrosine kinase Lck was also local to SDC3 in human and
mouse. In the two fish genomes, genes encoding tyrosine
kinases were also adjacent to SDC3, however the gene
products were most similar to other members of the tyrosine kinase family (Figure 4C).
For the syndecan-4 gene, strong conservation of the
genomic regions was apparent between human, mouse
and chicken: KCNS1, MATN4 and RBPSUHL were conserved between all three species and additional local genes
were conserved between human and mouse (Figure 4D).
SDC4 is not yet mapped to a chromosome in either the T.
nigroviridis or D. rerio genomes.
The high conservation of the genomic context of vertebrate syndecan genes prompted us to examine whether
this synteny extends to the urochordate, Ciona intestinalis.
The urochordate group are basal in the chordate lineage
and have not undergone whole genome duplications
[53]. The single syndecan gene of C. intestinalis is encoded
on chromosome 2, scaffold 125 [54]. The C. intestinalis
genome encodes a single matrilin (Gene Cluster 14563),
however, this is located on scaffold 259 on chromosome
1. (This gene product has highest identity to matrilin-3.
The Gene Cluster 00035/06628 that is assigned as "matrilin-2" at the Ghost website has highest identity to fibrillin). Of the other gene families consistently represented
on the same chromosomes as tetrapod syndecan genes,
only Gdf16 was identified on C. intestinalis chromosome 2
(scaffolds 213 and 58). Ten local gene neighbours of the
syndecan gene of C. intestinalis are not syntenic with any

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/83

human or chicken syndecan gene (data not shown). Thus,
there are many differences in the genomic context of C.
intestinalis syndecan.
Paralogous locations of syndecan and matrilin genes in the
human genome
Overall, the data on the genomic contexts of vertebrate
syndecan genes demonstrated two striking points. First, in
considering the individual family members, there is clear
conservation of synteny between fish and tetrapods for
each of the syndecan-2, -3 and -4 genes. This indicates that
these loci must each have been present in the last common ancestor of fish and tetrapods. Secondly, a deeper
level of homology is apparent, in that the syndecan-1, -2,
-3 and -4 genes in the organisms we examined all have
conserved gene neighbours that are paralogous members
of the same gene families. The clearest example of this are
the matrilins, that are components of extracellular matrix
and which in tetrapods also comprise a gene family of
four members [55,56]. With the exception of chicken syndecan-2, a matrilin gene is located near to every examined
tetrapod syndecan gene. The same trend was apparent for
the fish syndecan-3 genes (Figure 4). Members of the
LAPTM4 and KCNS gene families were also present in the
local genomic region of most of the tetrapod syndecan
genes. The two members of the pumilo gene family were
conserved adjacent to the syndecan-1 and -3 genes (Figure
4).

These findings strongly suggest that, in each genome, the
four syndecan genes are located in paralogous genomic
regions that have been conserved throughout the evolution of vertebrates. The existence of such regions in vertebrate genomes provides evidence of whole genome
duplication events that took place early in chordate evolution [57-60]. In the lineage of each of the organisms
examined, subsequent gene loss or localized rearrangements have blurred the initial four-fold replication of the
region in distinct ways over time [61]. In the human
genome, the rate of DNA rearrangement is slower than in
rodents [61] and paralogous regions have been identified
globally by BLASTP-based searches of the genome against
itself [57,58]. To substantiate the view obtained from our
analysis of local genes on an individual basis, we examined whether the human genome contains evidence of
chromosomal paralogies in the regions of the four syndecan genes according to this unbiased independent
method. Searches were made through the database of paralogons in the human genome, v5.28 [57]. Strikingly, the
genomic region of each human syndecan gene was found
to be related to the genomic region of all the other family
members. Members of the matrilin family were included
in all blocks, and other gene families identified in our
local searches were represented in individual paired
blocks along with genes that are more distant on each

texts of matrilin genes in T. nigroviridis and D. rerio. In T.
nigroviridis, all four matrilins, including MATN3, are
encoded within genomic regions syntenic to those of
tetrapod matrilins (Figure 6A). MATN2 is encoded at a
distinct point on chromosome 8 from SDC2, yet the adjacent genes include LAPTM4B and KCNS2, that are conserved neighbours in tetrapods. Similarly, KCNS2 is
adjacent to MATN4 (Figure 6A). We hypothesized that
fish matrilin-3s should be encoded within a genomic
region similar to that of tetrapod matrilin-3 and syndecan-1. Importantly, the order of genes adjacent to T. nigroviridis MATN3 matched closely with those adjacent to
tetrapod MATN3: however, in T. nigroviridis, PUM2 and
LAPTM4A are adjacent to each other, suggesting a specific
loss of SDC1. Although WDR35 is not present on chromosome 14, we found that this gene is located on chromosome 10 adjacent to the T. nigroviridis paralogue of
MATN3a (Figure 6A).

chromosome (Figure 5). Together, these findings provide
strong evidence that the four vertebrate syndecan genes
have evolved as a consequence of rounds of duplication of
a single ancestral chromosomal region.
The absence of syndecan-1 in fish: analysis of the genomic
contexts of matrilin genes in T. nigroviridis and D. rerio
Because synteny of syndecan-2 and -3 genes is conserved
between tetrapods and pufferfish, and because all four
syndecan gene loci show evidence of paralogy in tetrapods, we inferred that the absence of syndecan-1 from fish
is a derived characteristic. This raised the question of
whether other parts of the conserved chromosomal region
are present in fish, even though the syndecan-1 gene itself
is missing. We addressed this question through the proximity of syndecan and matrilin genes. In all tetrapods
examined, MATN3 is close to SDC1 (Figure 4). All four
forms of matrilin are present in T. nigroviridis (Table 3)
and both T. nigroviridis and D. rerio matrilins include two
matrilin-3 paralogues (Table 3) [62]. The existence of such
paralogous pairs is consistent with the strong evidence for
an additional whole genome duplication early in the evolution of teleost fish [63]. We examined the genomic con-

The genomic contexts of D. rerio matrilin genes, (some of
which were previously mapped by the radiation hybrid
method [62] and all of which are now physically mapped
in Zebrafish genome assembly Zv5), demonstrated the
same points, although the conservation of local neighboring genes was not as extensive for MATN1 as in T. nigroviridis (Figure 6B). In the case of MATN4, the local
neighboring genes did not match those of tetrapod
MATN4, but RBPSUHL is conserved as a neighboring gene
between D. rerio and T. nigroviridis (Figure 6B). As in T.
nigroviridis, MATN3a and MATN3b both have gene neighbors that match those of tetrapod MATN3. However, the
neighbors of each MATN3 paralogue represent the opposite sides of the conserved genomic region of tetrapods,
indicating a break of the chromosome after the additional
genome duplication [62]. We did not identify PUM2 in
the D. rerio genome (assembly Zv5). We examined the
genomic regions of fish matrilin-3s, as shown in Figure 6,
more closely for evidence of syndecan-1 coding sequence.
BLAT search of the Tetraodon genome with the mRNA
nucleotide sequences of human, chicken, or X. laevis syndecan-1 did not yield significant findings: in each case,
only short, 10â20 nucleotide regions on many different
chromosomes were identified as homologous. Syndecan1 protein sequence searches identified only the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 on chromosome 21. Pairwise
BLAST searches of syndecan-1 coding sequences against
the Tetraodon or Danio genomic sequence regions did not
identify significant matches. Thus, the syndecan-1 coding
sequence is not represented in this genome. In conclusion, our findings provide further evidence for partial synteny of the genomic contexts of syndecan and matrilin
genes between fish and tetrapods. Most importantly, the
fish genomes provide evidence of complex genomic rearrangements in the region of the matrilin-3 gene that have
involved the loss of the syndecan-1 encoding sequence.

Discussion
We report here the results of molecular phylogenetic and
comparative genomic analyses of members of the syndecan family of proteoglycans. The presence of syndecans in
organisms from Cnidaria to mammals establishes firmly
that the syndecan family is ancient in the animal lineage.
The Cnidaria, comprising corals, jellyfish, sea anemones
and hydroids, are typified by diploblasty, ability for sexual
and asexual reproduction and relatively simple body
plans. The divergence of the Cnidaria and Bilateria is
thought to have taken place between 650â1000 million
years ago (MYA) [43]. Nevertheless, genome and EST
project have revealed a high level of conservation of Cnidarian genes and their coding sequences with those of vertebrates, including integrins and components of the
extracellular matrix [42,64]. The identification of syndecan-encoding sequences in multiple species of Cnidaria
provides a strong indication that syndecans, like integrins,
have participated as mediators of extracellular interactions throughout animal evolution. The data also establish firmly that the encoding of mutiple syndecans in a
single genome is a vertebrate-specific attribute: the
genomes of two basal chordates, Ciona intestinalis and
Ciona savignyi, were each found to encode a single syndecan, and single syndecans were identified from the draft
genome of the sea urchin S. purpuratus, the Cnidarian species, and the amphioxus B. floridae EST dataset (Table 1).
The molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrated that
syndecan extracellular domains have diverged rapidly in
sequence â e.g., each of the invertebrate syndecans has an
extracellular domain that is distinct from other species
and from all the vertebrate syndecans â whereas the cytoplasmic domains contain highly conserved elements.
Identification of syndecans across phyla thus relies heavily on recognition of the cytoplasmic domains in database
searches. Within all cytoplasmic domains, the C1 and C2
regions are extremely well-conserved. With regard to the
distinctive V regions, our study identified two residues
that are extremely highly conserved: the first leucine residue, (corresponding to L289 of mouse syndecan-1) that is
universally conserved and the tyrosine residue (corresponding to Y300 of mouse syndecan-1) that is conserved
throughout the Bilateria but not in Cnidaria (Figure 1).
Current knowledge of vertebrate syndecans suggests that
these residues could serve either structural or functional
roles. The syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain forms a
homodimer in which L186 is important for the stability of
the structure because it makes three contacts with the C1
and V regions of the partner cytoplasmic domain [65].
Although other syndecan cytoplasmic domains are not
known to form dimers, it is conceivable that the corresponding leucines could make similar contacts with heterologous binding proteins. Y192 in syndecan-4 also makes
three contacts within the homodimer [65]. Thus, in syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/83

decan-4 the most critical roles of L186 and Y192 are structural. In contrast, Y300 in syndecan-1 has been implicated
in several signaling roles: it appears necessary for the
alignment of syndecan-1 with actin stress fibres [66] and
a phosphomimetic Y300E mutant inhibits the assembly
of lamellipodia and actin-and-fascin bundles by activated
syndecan-1 [13]. It is possible that the presence of this
additional tyrosine conferred additional signaling properties on syndecans in the Bilateria. The perspective provided by the new syndecan protein sequence dataset will
help guide further experimental analysis of syndecan cytoplasmic domains.
To understand the relationships between the four tetrapod syndecans and gain more insight into the origins of
fish syndecans, we turned to a comparative genomic analysis of the vertebrate syndecans. The conservation of synteny is a powerful way to resolve the relationships
between paralogous and orthologous members of multigene families in different species [67]. Previous phylogenetic coding sequence analyses have provided indications
of paralogy within the family, but the data were not conclusive [68,69]. The loci of the syndecan-1, -2, -3 and -4
genes each showed striking synteny in human, mouse and
chicken. With reference to the syndecan genes alone, only
partial synteny was detected in fish: whereas in T. nigroviridis and D. rerio the context of SDC3 was clearly syntenic, synteny of SDC2 was partial in T. nigroviridis
andabsent in D. rerio. Synteny in fish could not be
addressed for the absent syndecan-1 and the unmapped
syndecan-4. As discussed below, we achieved resolution
of this question by the combined analysis of syndecan
and matrilin genes in fish.
The identification of conserved neighboring genes in multiple genomes also revealed a deeper level of homology
between all four loci within a single genome, in that most
of the conserved neighboring genes also corresponded to
paralogous members of gene families. This indication that
the four syndecan genes are located in paralogous chromosomal regions was confirmed on the basis of an independent, computationally-based method of analysis of
the human genome [57]. When the loci of the four mouse
syndecan genes were identified by inter-species backcross
mapping, it was noted that the syndecan-1, -2 and -3
genes were syntenic with three members of the myc gene
family [70]. There is now strong evidence that paralogous
regions exist in vertebrate genomes as a result of whole
genome duplications that took place in a vertebrate ancestor after the divergence of the amphioxus lineage [53,5759]. It appears that the genomic regions of tetrapod syndecan genes have been very well-conserved subsequent to
these duplication events. At protein sequence level, there
is evidence of pairing within the syndecan family, such
that syndecan-1 and -3 are more closely related, as are syn-

decan-2 and -4 [3,4]. These pairings are also evident at
genomic level: the members of a two gene family, PUM1
and PUM2, are encoded adjacent SDC3 and SDC1, respectively, and STK3 and STK4 are encoded adjacent SDC2
and SDC4 (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Furthermore, the matrilin family also contains pairs: matrilin-1 and -3 are more
closely related, as are matrilin-2 and -4 [55,56]. Collectively, these findings are incorporated into a model for the
expansion of the syndecan family from a single syndecan
in an ancestral chordate to the current multigene status in
modern tetrapods and fish (Figure 7).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/83

(D. rerio, T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes). No syndecan-1like sequences were identified in the three fish genomes,
using either amphibian, chicken, or human syndecan-1 as
the query sequences. Searches of dbEST, which includes
ESTs from additional bony fish species, also did not provide any evidence for a fish syndecan-1. However, all four
matrilins are represented in fish (Fig. 6) [62]. Through
analysis of the genomic contexts of fish matrilin genes, we
were able to strengthen the evidence for conservation of
the respective genomic regions between fish and tetrapods. The fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) that is
estimated to have taken place around 320 MYA [63,71] is
assumed to have given rise to the paralogous MATN3a
and MATN3b genes. We examined in detail the genomic
region around the MATN3 genes, as the expected locus of
the syndecan-1 gene. The comparison of the loci of
MATN3 genes in T. nigroviridis and D. rerio revealed that
the genomic region appears to have become split after the
genome duplication. An alternative possibility that cannot be excluded on current data is that different sets of
genes have been retained alongside MATN3a and
MATN3b in each chromosome after the FSGD. Other gene
losses or rearrangements (e.g. loss of PUM2 from the D.
rerio genome, relocation of WDR35 to a different chromosome in T. nigroviridis; Figure 6) appear lineage-specific
and therefore, we infer, were of more recent occurence.
From the fossil record, the zebrafish and pufferfish lineages are estimated to have diverged around 284â296 MYA
[71]. Thus the loss of SDC1 appears, in evolutionary
terms, to have occurred relatively soon after FSGD. It is
possible that SDC1 was lost before, or at the time of,
FSGD, however, the available genomes only sample a portion of the fish lineage. Information on the genomes of
more basally diverging species of bony fish and a cartilagenous fish would be required to distinguish between
these possibilities. Our working model for the current status of fish syndecan genes incorporates the notion of
extensive gene loss after FSGD (Figure 7).
Our findings have several practical implications for future
studies of syndecan function. While the zebrafish is an
excellent vertebrate model organism for most developmental and disease processes [72], it would not be the
model of choice for physiological in vivo studies of syndecan-1. There is evidence from human, flies and C. elegans
that adjacent genes can show correlated expression and, in
some instances, function in the same pathway [73,74].
The possibility of co-expression or functional association
between syndecans and matrilins has not been considered, yet it is intriguing that both are ECM-associated proteins with roles in cell interactions during development
and in disease.

A surprising and important outcome of the molecular
phylogenetic and genomic analyses was the absence of
syndecan-1 from the genomes of multiple species of fish

The syndecans are an ancient family of cell adhesion and
signaling proteins in animals. The cytoplasmic domains
contain very highly conserved sequences and the extracellular domains have undergone rapid change. The four
syndecan genes of vertebrates are syntenic across tetrapods, and synteny of the syndecan-2 and -3 genes is also
apparent between fish and tetrapods. Each of the four
family members are encoded with paralogous genomic
regions in which members of the matrilin family are also
syntenic between tetrapods and fish. This genomic organization appears to have been set up after the divergence of
urochordates (Ciona) and vertebrates. The syndecan-1

[54,76]. The complete datasets are listed in Table 1 and 3.
Syndecans from additional species were identified by
TBLASTN searches of dbEST: the species included in Table
1 were selected as representatives of additional phyla and
sub-phyla for our dataset.
B. BLAST searches
The full-length amino acid sequences of syndecan family
members from either mouse or human were used to
search for syndecans in other species using BLASTP or
TBLASTN alignment algorithms at GenBank, their
genome databases, and dbEST. The following genome
assemblies were searched: H. sapiens (NCBI build 35.1)
[77,78], M. musculus (NCBI build 34 of May 2005) [79],
G. gallus (NCBI build 1.1, March 2004) [80], T. rubripes
[81] and D. melanogaster (build 4.1, February 2005) [82]
at NCBI Blast 2.2.12. D. rerio (Zv5 assembly of August
2005) was searched at EBI. The C. elegans genome [83]
was searched at Sanger worm informatics website
(WS149; assembly of Sept, 2005). The T. nigroviridis
genome [75] (assembly of April, 2004), X. tropicalis
genome assembly v4.1 [50] and C. intestinalis genome and
EST database [54,76] were also accessed. Sequences
including the cytoplasmic domains of representatives of

Model for the evolution of syndecans in fish and tetrapods
Model for the evolution of syndecans in fish and
tetrapods. The upper panel of the model shows the hypothesized ancestral genomic context of a single syndecan gene,
originating in an ancestral chordate (chordate 2) subsequent
to the divergence of the Urochordate lineage. The model
assumes that four-fold paralogy was then set up in an ancestral vertebrate as a result of two rounds of whole-genome
duplication. This process also sets up pairing within each set
of paralogues. The lower right hand panel represents how
the initial complete paralogy has degenerated through gene
rearrangements in modern tetrapods. Fish underwent an
additional round of genome duplication that would have generated additional paralogous pairs [58]. The lower left-hand
panel represents the situation in two modern fish, in which
only the two matrilin-3 paralogues have been retained from
FSGD. The syndecan-1 locus appears to have been lost early
in the fish lineage. Other gene rearrangements or losses
appear specific to the zebrafish or pufferfish lineages.

N. Expressed genes in Branchiostoma floridae project]. Cnidarian syndecan sequences, from Acropora tenuis [86],
Acropora palmata (Schwarz, J.A., Brokstein, P., Manohar,
C., Coffroth, M.A., Szmant, A. and Medina, M, Coral-Symbiodinium EST Project), Hydra magnipapillata [Bode et al.,
WashU Hydra EST project], and Nematostella vectensis
[43], were identified first by TBLASTN search of Stellabase
[87] and Cnidbase [88] with known invertebrate syndecans and then confirmed and extended by BLASTN and
TBLASTN searches of dbEST.
C. multiple alignment
Predicted amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic
domains of syndecans from organisms representing different phyla were aligned in CLUSTALW [46] and are presented in Boxshade 3.2. Predicted amino acid sequences
of full-length syndecans were aligned in TCOFFEE
(version_2.11) with default parameters using pairwise
methods [48].
D. tree building
Several parallel methods were used to assess molecular
phylogenetic relationship of syndecans, using either the
full-length sequences or the cytoplasmic domains. An
unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed from the
Phylip distance matrix output of a TCOFFEE alignment
[48] in DRAWTREE, and is presented in Phylodendron
(D.G. Gilbert, version 0.8d) with the choice of intermediate node positions and node lengths for tree growth [89].
Aligned amino acid sequences of the full-length and cytoplasmic domains of syndecans were analyzed using
PHYML, a maximum likelihood reconstruction method,
with the WAG substitution model [51]. Bootstrap proportion was used to assess the strength of the topologies for
this method [52]. The output data was used to obtain a
consensus tree based upon majority extended rule. The
consensus outree file (in newick format) was used to prepare an unrooted tree in Phylodendron.
E. WU-BLAST
The newly-identified syndecans from representative invertebrates, urochordate, amphibian and fish were compared
with the well-characterized human syndecans using WUBlast 2.0 against the Uniprot dataset [90,91]. The conservation scores were calculated by dividing the bit score of
each hit by the maximum bit score value obtained from
the sequence used to conduct the WU-BLAST search [92].

side of the target syndecan gene, (25 on each side, total
50), on the same contig were identified and compared
between organisms. In the case of different gene nomenclatures in different organisms, the encoded protein
sequences were used in BLASTP or TBLASTN searches
against the human genome assembly, to identify the corresponding human gene and its locus. The HUGO gene
names are given in the figures.

Assessment of paralogy
To identify whether the syndecan and matrilin genes are
present in paralogous regions of the human genome, the
"dataset of paralogons in the human genome, v5.28" was
searched [57]. These blocks were defined by McLysaught
et al., using a coding sequence cutoff value of e = 10-7.
Because of the low sequence identity of syndecan extracellular domains, syndecan-1 and -3 were not reproducibly
recognized by these criteria. All syndecan genes are
included in all blocks in Figure 5.
