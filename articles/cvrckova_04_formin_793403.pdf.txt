Abstract
Background: Involvement of conservative molecular modules and cellular mechanisms in the
widely diversified processes of eukaryotic cell morphogenesis leads to the intriguing question: how
do similar proteins contribute to dissimilar morphogenetic outputs. Formins (FH2 proteins) play a
central part in the control of actin organization and dynamics, providing a good example of
evolutionarily versatile use of a conserved protein domain in the context of a variety of lineagespecific structural and signalling interactions.
Results: In order to identify possible plant-specific sequence features within the FH2 protein
family, we performed a detailed analysis of angiosperm formin-related sequences available in public
databases, with particular focus on the complete Arabidopsis genome and the nearly finished rice
genome sequence. This has led to revision of the current annotation of half of the 22 Arabidopsis
formin-related genes. Comparative analysis of the two plant genomes revealed a good conservation
of the previously described two subfamilies of plant formins (Class I and Class II), as well as several
subfamilies within them that appear to predate the separation of monocot and dicot plants.
Moreover, a number of plant Class II formins share an additional conserved domain, related to the
protein phosphatase/tensin/auxilin fold. However, considerable inter-species variability sets limits
to generalization of any functional conclusions reached on a single species such as Arabidopsis.
Conclusions: The plant-specific domain context of the conserved FH2 domain, as well as plantspecific features of the domain itself, may reflect distinct functional requirements in plant cells. The
variability of formin structures found in plants far exceeds that known from both fungi and
metazoans, suggesting a possible contribution of FH2 proteins in the evolution of the plant type of
multicellularity.

Background
Proteins of the formin family (FH2 proteins) have an
important role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in organisms as diverse as fungi, slime molds, meta-

zoa and plants (reviewed in [1-3]). Formins have been
implicated in processes such as budding of yeast cells,
cytokinesis in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis, and formation of fruiting bodies in Dictyostelium (see e.g. [4-9]).

Known mutations affecting formin function in vertebrates
cause limb deformity and deafness [10,11], again suggesting a role in morphogenetic processes.
Formins are defined by the presence of a hallmark
domain, FH2, accompanied by a proline-rich FH1
domain and often also by other conserved sequence
motifs shared only by a subset of FH2 proteins, such as the
FH3 domain, a GTPase-binding domain (GBD), or coiledcoil regions [4,12,13]. The FH2 domain, whose structure
has been recently determined [14,15], acts as a dimer,
nucleating new actin filaments by a novel Arp2/3 independent mechanism, which has been well documented in
both yeast and metazoans [16-19]. This provides a mechanistic basis for the observed morphogenetic role of formins. The proline-rich FH1 motif binds profilin and
contributes to the actin-nucleating activity and its regulation [20,21]. Domains outside FH1 and FH2 provide a
variety of "interfaces" for integration of the actin nucleating module into cellular regulatory networks (reviewed in
[1,2,22]. For instance, a subfamily of Diaphanous-related
formins may be mediating the effects of Rho class small
GTPases on actin assembly and dynamics via a specific
conserved domain [23,24]. Other formins communicate
with universal "adaptor" domains such as SH3 or WW
(see e.g. [25-28], and at least indirectly even with the
microtubule cytoskeleton [29-31].
Members of the formin family have been found also in
higher plants, both experimentally [32] and by a bioinformatic approach [2,33]. Formin-related sequences
encoded by the complete Arabidopsis genome can be
divided into two distinct subfamilies. One of them (Class
I) contains mostly proteins with putative membrane
insertion signals, and often with extensin-like proline-rich
stretches in the predicted extracytoplasmic domain. This
suggests a possible plant-specific mechanism of cytoskeleton-membrane connection, or even transmembrane
anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the cell wall in case of
plasmalemma-localized formins [33], which is now supported also by experimental data [32,34]. No such motifs
– and no conserved domains whatsoever besides FH1 and
FH2 – were described in Class II formins so far. However,
detailed analysis of the N-termini of Arabidopsis formins
could not have been performed on the basis of a genome
annotation where the majority of Class II formin genes
appeared to be N-terminally truncated [2].
Here we report the results of a detailed structural and phylogenetic analysis of a collection of angiosperm forminrelated sequences currently available in public databases,
including the nearly complete rice genome. Using a comparative approach, we were able to refine the current
annotation of the Arabidopsis formin-related genes, and to
identify a novel N-terminal conserved domain shared by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

the majority of plant Class II formins. Moreover, the structure of this domain, which is related to the conserved and
well-characterized protein phosphatase/tensin/auxilin
fold, suggests a second possible plant-specific mechanism
for integrating the formin-associated actin nucleation
complexes into the cellular context.

Results and discussion
An inventory of Arabidopsis formins
An exhaustive in silicio search of the Arabidopsis genome
has identified 22 occurrences of the FH2 domain in total
of 21 annotated loci, described previously as AtFH1 to
AtFH21 [2] see Table 1); the AtFH15 locus appears to
encode two FH2 domains. Most of the formin-related
genes reside at positions interspersed throughout the Arabidopsis genome. However, 5 loci (AtFH15, AtFH16,
AtFH19, AtFH20 and AtFH21) form a tight cluster on
chromosome 5.

At least partial cDNA sequences are available for 17 of the
21 loci. Expression data from the NASC microarray collection [35] suggest that the remaining genes are significantly
expressed at least under some circumstances, although for
AtFH12 and AtFH21 only very low transcript levels have
been detected. Complete cDNAs have been sequenced
only for AtFH1, AtFH5, AtFH9 and AtFH10, while the current genome annotation of the remaining genes is based
mainly on automated splicing prediction. Such predictions are known to be error-prone, and inclusion of cDNA
data can improve the annotation considerably [36,37].
Homology among members of a large gene family can be
used as an additional guide for identification of mispredicted intron-exon boundaries (see e.g. [38]). Taking into
account both cDNA data and homology, we have found
that the current annotation of 10 of the remaining 17 loci
appears to be incorrect, and suggested modifications,
although we still could not reliably identify the N-terminal exons of AtFH3 and AtFH12 (see Table 1 and Additional file 1).
Most of the suggested modifications represent extension
of exons, or inclusion of extra exons that restore missing
portions of the conserved FH2 domain, or of N-terminal
regions of homology shared by multiple family members
and revealed in TBLASTN searches (see Methods). This is
the case of AtFH12, AtFH13, AtFH14, AtFH17, AtFH18
and AtFH20. In the case of AtFH20, the N-terminal portion of FH2, which was missing in the original prediction,
was found in a neighboring gene (At5g07750), which
therefore probably represents a part of the AtFH20 locus
erroneously annotated as a separate gene.
In three loci (AtFH3, AtFH4 and AtFH16) attempts to
restore a missing exon within FH2 revealed probable
frameshift errors in the genome sequence. For AtFH3, we

have included an internal exon exhibiting homology to
the very closely related sequenced AtFH5 cDNA and a 3'
extension of the ORF that was suggested by an alternative
GenScan prediction (see Methods) as a new exon preceded by an unusually short (11 bp) intron. Since the
smallest (protozoan) introns reported so far are 13 bp
short and the majority of short introns in plants exceed
the length of 30 bp [39], we suspect that the presumed

"intron", which would contain a stop codon, may in fact
be a part of a contiguous exon disrupted by omission of 1
base. Also in the internal exon, an extra base must be
introduced in order to maintain the reading frame. Since
both suspect areas are extremely GC-rich (and therefore
notoriously difficult to sequence), we believe that an error
in the genomic data is a likely explanation in both cases.
For AtFH4, the original annotation predicts an intron dis-

rupted by an in-frame stop codon at the position of the
conserved G-N-X-M-N motif. However, this intron is
poorly supported by WebGene and GenScan predictions
and apparently not spliced in a sequenced cDNA, which
contains an extra base in this area and restores the reading
frame within a highly conserved portion of FH2. For
AtFH16, the splicing pattern could have been inferred
with a reasonable confidence, since most of the locus is
covered by cDNAs. However, a contiguous reading frame
throughout the conserved FH2 domain can be maintained only by inserting an extra base in a GC-rich area not
covered by cDNA, again suggesting a sequencing error.
In case of AtFH15, the locus with two FH2 domains, a
sequenced cDNA ends by a stretch corresponding to a presumed intron, which contains multiple stop-codons. We
believe that the locus either represents two related neighboring genes (further referred to as AtFH15a and
AtFH15b), or produces multiple gene products by alternative splicing. Evidence for cDNA-supported alternative
splicing, documented in metazoan formins [40], has been
found also for AtFH13 and AtFH20, as well as for two rice
formin homologues (see below and Additional file 2). In
the following structural analysis only the longest predicted proteins have been taken into account.
Nine of the eleven mispredicted loci code for formins previously classified as Class II, while most Class I formins
appear to be predicted correctly. The complex structure of
Class II formin genes, which possess substantially more
intron-exon boundaries than their Class I relatives, may
be sufficient to explain the difference [36]. Moreover,
both mispredicted Class I loci appear to contain sequencing errors, and one of them, AtFH3, is expressed almost
exclusively in pollen according to the results of a recent
microarray analysis [35,41]. This narrow tissue specificity
might be associated with a modification of the "housekeeping" splicing apparatus, whose function has been so
far characterized mainly on the basis of data from vegetative tissues. We therefore believe that the difficulties in
predicting AtFH3 structure (including the lack of a reliable
N-terminus) may partly reflect the particular expression
pattern of this gene.
Phylogeny of the plant FH2 proteins
Previous phylogenetic analyses of plant formins [2,33]
included only Arabidopsis data. We have used the re-annotated Arabidopsis formin sequences as a query for
identifying genes encoding FH2 proteins from available
angiosperm sequences in the public databases, including
the nearly complete rice genome and a recently published
large collection of rice cDNAs [42]. At least partial cDNA
or genomic sequences corresponding to 79 putative
formin-related genes from cotton, soybean, barley,
tomato, trefoil, alfalfa, tobacco, rice, pea, sorghum,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

potato, wheat, grapevine and maize have been found
(Additional files 2 to 4).
Complete FH2 domain sequence could have been reconstructed for 29 of the non-arabidopsis sequences. This
subset, together with 22 Arabidopsis FH2 domains and a
selection of fungal, slime mold and metazoan formins,
has been used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 1) using the NJ method [43]. For the remaining
sequences, closest neighbors have been determined using
the BLAST algorithm (Table 2). All of the plant FH2
domains studied so far, including the incomplete ones,
can be unequivocally assigned to one of the two previously proposed classes [2]; Table 2). Also the overall
domain composition and domain order of available complete plant formins – i.e. sequences outside FH2 – reflects
rather well the dichotomy between Class I and Class II
formins (see below).
The presence of two classes of formins appears to be a general feature of plants. However, although several subclasses containing representatives of more than one
species can be distinguished within the two classes (see
Fig. 1 – branches Ia to Ie, IIa and IIb, Table 1, Table 2),
only occasionally true orthology between genes from different species was established. A similar pattern has been
previously observed for another large plant gene family
encoding the plethora of phospholipase D isoforms [38].
Very closely related proteins that might represent true
orthologues (Table 2, sequences in bold) were found
mostly within limited taxonomical groups such as the
grasses (barley, rice, sorghum, wheat), the legumes (soybean, alfalfa), or Solanaceae (tobacco, potato and tomato).
The observed pattern of paralog distribution may suggest
that a number of gene duplications or polyploidization
events occurred relatively recently compared to the separation of the angiosperm lineages included in the analysis.
An extreme example of such a recent gene multiplication
is presented by the well-defined subgroup of Class II genes
corresponding to the clustered loci on the Arabidopsis
chromosome V (marked by asterisk in Fig. 1).
Structural diversity of the plant FH2 domains
Surprisingly, major differences between Class I and Class
II formins have been found within the relatively well-conserved FH2 domain. Hallmark features for both classes of
plant formins can be identified already at the level of
amino acid sequence in the C-terminal portion of the FH2
domain, which is less conserved than the central area
around the G-N-X-M-N motif (see Additional file 5).
While Class I formins contain a consensus V/I-R-D-F-L
motif about 170–190 aa from the conserved core, Class II
proteins possess a signature M-H-Y-L/Y-C-K, located usually 31 aa downstream of the central motif.

As "closest relatives", sequences with best match altogether and best Arabidopsis match are shown (defined as identity at least 80 % across at least
100 amino acids, if available, or best BLAST score). Numbers denote fraction of identical amino acids throughout the length of sequence analysed
(putative orthologues with more than 80 % identity in bold). Sequences marked by an asterisk are included in Fig. 1. The partial sequences MtFH4,
MtFH5 and MtFH6 might correspond to different parts of the same gene. For database references and protein sequence predictions see Additional
files 2 to 4.

Data on 3-dimensional structure of the FH2 domain have
been published recently for the yeast Bni1p formin [14],
see also Fig. 2). Its FH2 domain folds into a structure consisting from N-terminal "lasso", connected by a predominantly helical linker to the globular "knob" region, which
is followed by a coiled-coil assembly of three α-helices
and a "post" domain, again predominantly α-helical. The
protein can dimerize through interaction of the lasso and
post domains, producing flexible ring-like "head to tail"
dimers with putative actin-binding sites on the part of the
inner surface of the ring, provided by the knob. Residues
directly participating in the actin-binding site have been
identified by site-directed mutagenesis of selected positions conserved among Bni1p and metazoan formins of
the Diaphanous type. Mutants unable to form dimers do
not nucleate actin in vitro, and proteolytically cleaved
"hemidimers" have been shown to block barbed end
elongation, acting as capping proteins rather than nucleators [14,15]. Apparently, dimerization can add another
dimension to the diversity of plant formins, since, in theory, the 22 Arabidopsis FH2 domains could produce up to
484 different homo- and heterodimers. However, the
actual number will be lower, since formins do exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, as documented by analysis of available expression data [35]. Moreover, structural
differences may prevent heterodimerization of some protein pairs.
Comparison of Arabidopsis FH2 domain sequences with
the sequence of Bni1p (see Additional file 5) revealed surprising plant-specific features in Class I formins (Fig. 2).
All Class I formins except AtFH9 and AtFH10 have a small
or non-polar amino acid at the position corresponding to

K1639 of Bni1p, a conserved Lys residue contributing to
the actin binding site and required for efficient nucleation
[14]. However, all Class I proteins have a relatively large
insertion (12–54 aa) in the vicinity (position 1620 of
Bni1p), suggesting an alternative construction of the
actin-binding site. It is worth noting that the shortest
insertions were found in AtFH9 and AtFH10, i. e. the only
Class I formins that have kept – or, more likely, restored –
the consensus Lys residue. On the other hand, AtFH9 and
AtFH10, which are mutually closely related (see Fig. 1),
exhibit deviations from the Bni1p/Diaphanous consensus
in portions of the molecule that are involved in dimerization (a deletion in the lasso of AtFH9, altered structure of
the post in AtFH10). It is tempting to speculate that these
alterations might result in a restriction of
(hetero)dimerizing capability of AtFH9 and AtFH10,
although we cannot, at present, predict which dimers will
be preferred or excluded.
On the other hand, the overall structure of most Class II
formins basically corresponds to the Bni1p/Diaphanous
consensus, with several notable exceptions. AtFH20 contains two insertions in different strands of the coiled-coil
part of the molecule. Insertions of 15–43 aa have been
found also in the post region of AtFH13, AtFH15a and
AtFH16, close to the site of the common insertion in Class
I formins. AtFH13 has also an insertion in the lasso
region, with possible effect on dimerization.
The case of AtFH15a and its neighbour or splicing variant
AtFH15b is rather enigmatic, since both proteins miss
substantial portions of the FH2 domain (part of post and
coiled-coil in AtFH15a, lasso in AtFH15b) and, moreover,

Summary of structural variation in plant FH2 domains
Summary of structural variation in plant FH2 domains. Structure of the yeast Bni1p FH2 domain (PDB 1UX5), with
marked positions of major insertions (arrows), deletions (flags pointing towards the missing portion of sequence) and conserved site mutations (colored balls) found in Arabidopsis formins. Grey balls denote positions of insertions found in multiple
proteins, numbers correspond to conserved amino acid positions in Bni1p.

each of them lacks one of two residues important for actin
nucleation – an essential isoleucine (I1431 of Bni1) in
AtFH15a and a lysine (K1601 of Bni1) in AtFH15b. We
suspect that AtFH15a and AtFH15b may present two out
of many possible splicing alternatives of the complex
AtFH15 locus, which may be encoding multiple proteins,

including perhaps both a "complete" active formin and
regulatory variants without nucleation and/or dimerization activity.
Two more proteins have mutations in the conserved positions required for actin nucleation. In AtFH21, the K1601

mutation is accompanied by a large insertion in the flexible linker. This appears to be a result of a partial gene
duplication involving also the lasso-linker area of FH2,
which has been subsequently lost from the posterior copy.
Most dramatic deviation from the conserved structure has
been found in AtFH12, which lacks both I1431 and
K1601 and the whole lasso-linker assembly, while the presumed dimerization region of the post is altered. Such a
protein may perhaps present a naturally occurring
"hemidimer" variant, acting as a barbed end cap rather
than a nucleating centre.
Plant formins exhibit variable domain composition
Following the phylogenetic analysis, we have examined
the overall domain composition of plant FH2-containing
proteins, searching for known sequence or structure
motifs. Several patterns of conserved domain order can be
distinguished in the complete plant formin sequences
(Fig. 3). We further refer to these patterns as structural
types A through F. Besides of the conserved domains,
some formins contain long stretches of sequence (55–870
amino acids) lacking any conserved motifs, located either
between FH1 and FH2 (AtFH6, AtFH21) or C-terminally
(AtFH16, OsFH14).

Most plant formins contain proline-rich sequences, often
called FH1 in the formin context. However, neither the
FH3 domain nor additional motifs common in FH proteins, such as the DBD motif shared by diaphanousrelated formins, or the coiled coil, were found in plant FH
proteins (a single coiled-coil domain, located between
FH1and FH2, has been found in AtFH21).
It has been noted previously [33] that most Arabidopsis
Class I formins contain putative secretion or membrane
insertion signals and transmembrane segments, indicating that they may be integral membrane proteins. A second proline-rich domain, reminiscent of some cell wall
proteins such as the extensins, is often located in the
presumed extracytoplasmic portion of the protein (Fig. 3,
structure A). Indeed, association with insoluble cellular
fractions has been reported for one of the presumed transmembrane formins [32], providing support for the hypothesis that this type of formins may mediate anchorage of
actin nucleation sites to the cell wall across the plasmalemma. We found similar sequences also in the majority of
complete non-arabidopsis Class I sequences (see color
coding in Fig. 1), although transmembrane segments
appeared to be on the edge of significance for the rice
sequences OsFH10 and OsFH11. We believe that also
AtFH3 may be a type A (transmembrane) formin, since its
current predicted sequence appears to be 5'-truncated, and
its closest relative, AtFH5, exhibits type A structure. The
only non-membrane Class I formin in Arabidopsis is
AtFH7, which resembles "standard" animal formins with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

FH1 and FH2 motifs but possesses a unique repetitive
structure in its N-terminal half. No other Class I proteins
of this structure have been found so far, and it remains to
be clarified whether this is a representative of a common,
though less abundant, Class I formin type, or a relatively
recent modification, present perhaps only in one or a
handful of species. The same can be said about the
remaining non-membrane Class I formin from rice,
OsFH14, which has an extremely long C-terminal extension unparalleled elsewhere. However, until complete
cDNA sequence becomes available, we cannot exclude the
possibility of artifacts resulting from wrong splicing prediction in the weakly conserved parts of these loci.
While examining the predicted protein structures of Class
II formins, we have noticed an area of mutual similarity in
the N-terminal half of a subset of these proteins. This area
exhibits also considerable similarity to the structurally
well-characterized PTEN domain known from metazoans
(see below; Fig. 4). Subsequently, we have found this
motif, located N-terminally from the conventional FH1
and FH2 domains, in a majority of Class II formins (type
D). The only exceptions are the rather diverged AtFH12
protein, AtFH17 and a group of mutually related formins
encoded by genes of the cluster on the Arabidopsis chromosome V that apparently arose by a relatively recent
series of gene duplication events. A clear distinction
between Class I and Class II formins is therefore not
restricted to the structural features of the FH2 domain
itself, but extends also to features outside FH1 and FH2;
presence of the PTEN-related domain can be considered a
hallmark feature of a subset of Class II plant formins.
Aberrations from the characteristic domain composition
of Class I and Class II formins (types A and D, respectively) appear to be mostly Arabidopsis-specific, and often
associated with relatively recent gene duplications (a partial internal duplication involving a segment of the FH2
domain has been identified in AtFH21). Although an Arabidopsis-specific tendency to duplicate formin-related
sequences cannot be excluded a priori, we believe that a
more likely explanation is that duplicated sequences are
notoriously difficult to analyse, and therefore tend to be
the last ones to make their way into genome databases.
A phosphatase/tensin/PTEN-related domain in most Class
II formins
While screening for known domains in plant formins
using the SMART package [44], we found a significant
match to the undefined specifity protein phosphatase
domain (PTPc_DSPc, SM0012, BLAST E = 9. 10-6) in the
N-terminal part of AtFH18. Position-specific iterated
BLAST [45] revealed a conserved domain (KOG2283 –
clathrin coat dissociation kinase GAK/PTEN/auxilin) in
the same region. The conserved domain falls into an area

Figure 4
The PTEN domain of selected plant formins
The PTEN domain of selected plant formins. For terminology of the plant proteins see Tables 1 and 2; the remaining
sequence in the alignment is human PTEN (HsPTEN, AAD13528.1). Amino acids conserved between at least one of the plant
sequences and PTEN are shown in yellow for the protein phosphatase-related domain and in light blue for the C2 domain; residues conserved between at least six plant formins are inverted, and marked by asterisks if found also in PTEN. The lipid/protein phosphatase signature is in red, the putative regulatory phosphorylation site (T383) in dark blue. Note that only OsFH3
can be phosphorylated at the corresponding position. Secondary structure prediction for AtFH13 is shown above the alignment (a – α-helix, b – β-sheet); results for other Arabidopsis formins were analogous.

exhibiting high degree of conservation between AtFH18
and three other Arabidopsis family members (AtFH13, 14
and 20), and a related motif has been found also in several non-Arabidopsis Class II plant formins (OsFH3, 5, 6,
7 and 12, MtFH6; see Fig. 4).
Search of the 3D-PSSM protein fold library [46] with the
multiple alignment of AtFH13, 14, 18 and 20 as a probe
predicted significant structural similarity to a well-defined
three-dimensional structure element, the c1d5ra_ fold.
The prototype of this fold, the PTEN tumor suppressor
(PDB 1d5r), is a member of a wider superfamily that
includes, among others, also protein phosphatases, tensin
and the tensin/auxilin domain of the cyclin G associated
protein kinase (GAK) – i.e. sequences that have defined
the KOG2283 domain. The presence of a PTEN-related
structural motif has been independently confirmed by
another sequence-structure threading method – FUGUE
[47], while a third algorithm – SAM-T99 [48] – failed to
recognize any conserved elements in this area. However, a
secondary structure similar to that established for PTEN
has been independently predicted from the sequences of
AtFH13, 14 and 18 by PSIPRED [49]. Taken together,
these results indicate the presence of a conserved sequence
and structure motif in multiple Class II plant formins. We
will further refer to this sequence/structure element as the
PTEN domain.
The prototype of the PTEN domain is the human PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin-related) antioncogene, whose
mutation results in rapid development of multi-organ
tumors in humans [50,51]. The conserved part of human
PTEN protein consists of two structural units. First unit
(corresponding to positions 7–185 of the human protein)
has the structural similarity to dual specificity protein
phosphates, contains the active site signature of protein
phosphatases, HCXXGXXR, and possesses both a lipid
phosphatase activity with a strong affinity to
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and a weak protein tyrosine phosphatase
activity [52,53]. The second structural unit, related to a
class of domains collectively referred to as C2, will be discussed in more detail below.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

exhibiting a complex cytoskeletal pattern. Tensin is associated with actin in focal adhesions, acting both as a
barbed-end cap and a cross-linking protein [56]. Overexpression of PTEN results in alteration of the structure of
the actin cytoskeleton [57]. Moreover, although PTEN
does not exhibit a specific intracellular localization, it
binds to proteins localized to tight junctions in epithelia,
and appears to be essential for embryonic development in
mice. Together with its apparent participation in the control of cell growth, adhesion, migration, invasion and
apoptosis, this suggests a possible role in the building of
the cell surface and in cellular processes that involve a
substantial contribution of the actin cytoskeleton [53]. In
plants, homologous proteins may be therefore expected to
participate in the construction of the cytoplasmic portion
of the cell wall – membrane – cytoskeleton continuum.
The PTEN-related domain may have a structural rather
than catalytic role
To our surprise, PTEN domains in plant formin sequences
bear mutations that make both protein and lipid phosphatase activity very unlikely (Fig. 4). The last arginine residue in the phosphatase active site, which has been shown
to be crucial for catalysis [58,59], is replaced by hydrophobic or small polar residues in the plant proteins.
Another residue essential for catalysis, Asp 92, that act as
a general acid to faciliate protonation of the phenolic oxygen atom of the tyrosyl group [60] was in the plant formins substituted by glycine. We therefore believe that the
function of plant PTEN domains is rather structural than
catalytic.

A portion of the PTEN molecule, including the phosphatase-like domain, exhibits significant similarity to the
N-terminal domain of tensin, a multifunctional component of integrin-mediated focal adhesions known to participate in cell motility and cell adhesion [50,54]. A
related domain was found also in some metazoan auxilins
(proteins involved in uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles), and in the cyclin G-associated protein kinase (GAK),
which has an auxilin-like domain [50,55].

Such a structural role could perhaps be attributed mainly
to the second portion of the conserved PTEN motif. This
second conserved unit (corresponding to positions 186–
351 of human PTEN) is similar to the C2 domain that is
known from a variety of proteins with multiple functions
including membrane fusion, vesicular transport, GTPase
regulation, protein phosphorylation, and protein degradation. The C2 domain mediates protein-membrane or
protein-protein interactions, often dependent on the presence of Ca2+ ions. However, not all C2 domains exhibit
the same membrane-association mechanism. Some of
them, such as those of synaptotagmin or phospholipase
Cβ, bind to membrane surface, while others, such as the
C2 domain of phospholipase A2, invade the membrane
by insertion of variable C2 domain loops [61]. The C2
domain of PTEN cannot bind calcium ions. Instead, two
stretches of basic residues mediate peripheral binding to
the membrane by electrostatic interaction [62]. The PTEN
C2 domain therefore defines a specific class of calciumindependent C2 domains [61].

Some of the metazoan proteins sharing the PTEN domain
are involved in the structural organization of cell regions

We were unable to detect C2 domains in plant formins by
any of the software used to find PTEN similarity (see

Page 12 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:44

above and Methods). This can be due to a huge sequence
divergence within the C2 domains family, reflecting the
diversity of functions they participate in. However, upon
visual inspection of sequence alignment, we found obvious sequence similarity to the C2 domain of human PTEN
protein, including the regions that make PTEN Ca2+ independent (Fig. 4).
Using the human PTEN C2 domain as a template, we were
able to produce 3D models of three representative plant
formin C2 domains, AtFH13, AtFH14 and AtFH15, further strengthening the notion that plant Class II formins
do possess a C2 domain. Surface charge distributions of
all three formin C2 domains resemble those of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) rather than PTEN (Fig. 5). Membrane
association of the PLA2 C2 domain is Ca2+-dependent
and occurs via hydrophobic interactions with zwitterionic
phospholipids and insertion of C2 loops into the membrane. However, since the formin C2 domains appear to
be unable to bind Ca2+ (at least not in the same manner as
PLA2), although they perhaps could be neutralised by
other means, it remains to be decided experimentally
whether plant Class II formins interact with membranes
via their C2 domains.
Phosphorylation of a threonine residue downstream from
the C2 domain (at position 383 of human PTEN) was
recently found to modulate the ability of PTEN to modify
cell migration in culure [63]. However, the phosphorylated motif, including the crucial threonine, is not conserved in plant sequences, suggesting that this regulation
may be specific for the metazoan lineage (Fig. 4).
It is therefore tempting to speculate that the widespread
occurrence of the PTEN domain among plant Class II
formins may suggest a function analogous to that proposed for the transmembrane segments in their Class I
counterparts. A variant PTEN domain that has lost its catalytic activity by mutation but retained its intracellular
localisation may act as an anchor positioning the actinnucleating sites (FH2) to some intracellular (and possibly
cell surface/plasmalemma-associated) structures.

Conclusions
One of the most intriguing questions of contemporary
molecular biology is how can vastly dissimilar organisms
develop utilizing a limited repertoire of basically similar
molecules derived from a relatively small set of conserved
protein domains? Processes of eukaryotic cell morphogenesis, such as shaping of the actin cytoskeleton, provide
a good example of such a versatile usage of conserved
molecular mechanisms. Well-conserved protein domains,
such as the FH1/FH2 motifs shared by formins and participating in actin nucleation, are being used for a broad
range of cellular tasks in various eukaryotic lineages. It is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

plausible to assume that the diversity of cellular functions
may to a large extent stem from the context those domains
assume within the framework of larger, multidomain protein molecules.
We have examined the phylogeny and molecular context
of the FH2 domain in available angiosperm formin
homologues. Besides of confirming the existence of two
classes of plant formins, suggested previously solely on
the basis of Arabidopsis data, we could identify a novel
domain shared by a significant portion of Class II formins
and possibly involved in the association between forminbased actin nucleation modules and other cellular
structures.
Another interesting aspect is the extremely dynamic evolution of the angiosperm formin family, with ample
evidence for multiple gene duplication events (sometimes
accompanied by major domain rearrangements) not seen
in other species studied so far. At the moment, we can
only speculate whether this is a feature specific for a small
selection of plant taxa, or a general characteristic of plant
formins. However, we hope that publication of more
complete plant genomes can help to resolve this question
in a not so distant future.
The enormous variety of formins within a single plant
organism far exceeds that found in fungi and metazoans,
where only a handful of formin genes exist, although their
diversity can be enhanced by alternative splicing [13] and
heterodimerization [14]. However, even the relatively
small Arabidopsis genome contains no less than 21 FH2
domain-encoding loci, while possibilities for alternative
splicing and dimerization remain open, resulting in literally hundreds of possible species of the functional formin
dimer. It is tempting to speculate that this diversity may be
related to the demands of actin-nucleation site positioning with respect to precisely defined cellular surfaces in
the context of a multicellular body consisting of cells
endowed with rather rigid surface structures. Consequently, a major increase in formin diversity could be
expected at the transition between unicellular green algae
and multicellular plants. However, testing of this hypothesis would have to wait until more complete data from
algal and gymnosperm genome projects become
available.

Methods
Identification of FH2-containing plant genes
Arabidopsis loci encoding putative formin homologues
have been identified by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches
[64] of both predicted protein and complete genome
sequence databases (at TAIR and NCBI) using previously
characterized members of the family [33] as the query.
The same loci have been found by both approaches.

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:44

Analogous searches have been performed with the most
diverged sequences from the first round as the query, until
no new significant matches appeared. Presence of FH2
domains in predicted candidate open reading frames has
been confirmed by a SMART search [44] for all genes.
Sequences from other plant species coding for related proteins have been identified in analogous searches of Entrez
nr, est and htgs databases.
Detection of gene expression
For Arabidopsis genes with no available cDNA sequence,
microarray slides with highest transcript levels within the
NASCArrays data set [35] have been detected using the
Spot History tool. Visual inspection of the Detection
parameter in full slide data has been used to confirm that
detected expression levels were significantly above zero.
Gene structure predictions
For every Arabidopsis formin-related gene, exhaustive
TBLASTN searches of the Entrez nr and est databases have
been performed in order to identify all cDNAs derived
from the chromosomal locus. Resulting cDNA sequences
were aligned to the genomic and predicted ORF sequences
with the aid of the MACAW program [65]. Conflicts
between the genomic and cDNA sequence have been
resolved in favor of the genomic version unless strong evidence suggested genomic sequence errors (see Results and
Discussion). In cases of either a complex splicing pattern
without experimental support or apparent deletions in the
FH2 portion of the sequence, an alternative splicing prediction has been obtained using GenScan [66,67]. GenScan usually agreed reasonably well with the original
genome annotation, although it did miss exons occasionally. WebGene [68] or MZEF [69] have been used as well
in some cases, however these programs appeared to be
inferior with respect to both performance (agreement
with cDNA or the FH2 consensus) and output readability.
The original splicing predictions have been modified for
some genes, taking into account alternative predictions
and the structure of closest homologues (see Results,
Table 1 and Additional file 1). Programs of the Sequence
manipulation suite [70] version 2 [71] have been used for
general sequence manipulation, assembly and translation
tasks.

For non-arabidopsis genomic sequences, gene models
have been produced in an analogous manner, based on
combination of existing genome annotation (if available), GenScan and WebGene predictions and alignment
to the closest Arabidopsis relatives.
Protein sequence alignments and phylogeny
reconstruction
To produce an alignment of FH2 domain sequences,
selected representative members of divergent branches of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/44

the family have been aligned using ClustalW [72] configured to run as a helper application under the BioEdit
package [73], using the BLOSUM matrix series. The resulting core alignment has been modified manually using
BioEdit, taking into account independently produced
alignments of selected subsets of sequences, made with
the aid of the MACAW software [65] as described previously [33]. Sequences closely related to those already
present in the core alignment have been merged to the
alignment manually in the BioEdit environment. Alignments of the PTEN domain have been produced in an
analogous manner, taking into account 3D structure data
(see below).
All positions containing gaps in at least one sequence
have been removed prior to the construction of the phylogenetic tree. An unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the
resulting alignment has been produced with the aid of the
Treecon package [74] using the neighbor-joining (NJ)
algorithm [43] with Poisson correction for distance
estimation.
Protein domain recognition
The SMART program package [44,75] version 4 has been
used for identification of known domains, secretory signals (by the SignalP method – [76]), transmembrane segments (by the TMHMM algorithm – [77]) and repetitive
sequence motifs within predicted formin sequences.
Unless stated otherwise, only signals above the default significance threshold have been taken into account.

Additional series of domain searches has been performed
using reverse position-specific BLAST [45] against the
CDD database (version 1.65), which contains a larger
selection of domains than the SMART collection (including FH3 and DBD), with the same results.
3D structure searches and alignments
The 3D-PSSM threading algorithm [46] has been used to
find possible known protein folds in the shared N-terminal domain of AtFH13, 14, 18 and 20, using a multiple
alignment of the four sequences as a probe. The result
appeared to be highly significant (over 95 % confidence,
PSSM E = 0.00179 for the 1d5ra_ fold). For independent
confirmation, a FUGUE version v2.s.07 [47,78] search
against the HOMSTRAD fold library has been performed
for two selected sequences (AtFH13 and AtFH14), resulting in identification of the same fold in both cases as "certain". A third algorithm, SAM-T99 [48,79] produced no
significant results. However, this program is known to
have a very powerful filter against false negatives that loses
some positives, especially those with predominantly helical structures (see manuals at the program website).
