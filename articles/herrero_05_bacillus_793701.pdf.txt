Abstract
Background: Insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis bind to receptors on midgut epithelial
cells of susceptible insect larvae. Aminopeptidases N (APNs) from several insect species have been
shown to be putative receptors for these toxins. Here we report the cloning and expression
analysis of four APN cDNAs from Spodoptera exigua.
Results: Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) was used to construct cDNA libraries of
genes that are up-and down-regulated in the midgut of last instar larvae of beet armyworm, S. exigua
exposed to B. thuringiensis Cry1Ca toxin. Among the clones from the SSH libraries, cDNA
fragments coding for two different APNs were obtained (APN2 and APN4). A similar procedure
was employed to compare mRNA differences between susceptible and Cry1Ca resistant S. exigua.
Among the clones from this last comparison, cDNA fragments belonging to a third APN (APN1)
were detected. Using sequences obtained from the three APN cDNA fragments and degenerate
primers for a fourth APN (APN3), the full length sequences of four S. exigua APN cDNAs were
obtained. Northern blot analysis of expression of the four APNs showed complete absence of
APN1 expression in the resistant insects, while the other three APNs showed similar expression
levels in the resistant and susceptible insects.
Conclusion: We have cloned and characterized four different midgut APN cDNAs from S. exigua.
Expression analysis revealed the lack of expression of one of these APNs in the larvae of a Cry1Caresistant colony. Combined with previous evidence that shows the importance of APN in the mode
of action of B. thuringiensis toxins, these results suggest that the lack of APN1 expression plays a
role in the resistance to Cry1Ca in this S. exigua colony.

Background
During sporulation, B. thuringiensis (Bt) produces a crystal
composed of one or more Cry proteins with toxicity
against insects. The mode of action of the largest group of

Cry proteins has been extensively studied and can be
divided into four main steps: (i) Solubilization of the
inclusion body to release the Cry proteins in their protoxin form, (ii) gut protease processing of these protoxins

to an active toxin, (iii) binding of the active form to specific receptors in the midgut of the insect, (iv) membrane
insertion, pore formation, and cellular lysis [1]. Any alteration in one of these steps could result in the development
of resistance to one or several Cry proteins in a given
insect population.
Development of insect resistance to insecticides is one of
the most important problems of agriculture because it
increases the costs of crop protection and reduces its productivity. More than 500 insect and mite species have
been reported to develop resistance to one or more pesticides [2]. Although less in number, several cases of resistance have been also reported for B. thuringiensis
insecticides in field populations as well as in laboratory
selection experiments [3]. With the commercialization of
transgenic crops expressing B. thuringiensis toxins (Btcrops) the selection pressure has increased, with the consequent increased risk of resistance development. A highdose/refuge strategy has been proposed and implemented
in some cases to delay the development of insect resistance to Bt-crops. The effectiveness of this strategy mainly
depends on the mode of inheritance of resistance and the
initial frequency of Bt resistance alleles. Knowledge of the
genes involved in Bt resistance will allow fast molecular
screening for resistance gene frequencies in the field
before or during use of a Bt crop. Furthermore, to determine if refuges or any other resistance management strategy are working, one should keep track of the frequency of
resistance in field [4].
So far, the best-characterized mechanism of Bt resistance
is the alteration of Cry protein binding to its receptors in
the midgut of the target insect. This alteration has been
reported in different populations of Plutella xylostella, Plodia interpunctella, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua
and also for several Cry proteins (Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab,
Cry1Ac, and Cry1Ca) [3]. Aminopeptidase N (APN) and
cadherin-like proteins have been characterized as candidates for Cry1 toxin receptors [1]. Gahan et. al, 2001 [5]
studying the H. virescens (YHD2) resistant strain showed
that the major gene for resistance to Cry1Ac in this strain
was highly linked to the locus coding for a cadherin-like
protein, and that this gene was disrupted in the resistant
strain by the insertion of a retrotransposon. In 1994,
Knight et al. [6] identified an APN as an insect receptor of
the Cry1Ac protein. Since 1994 to today, more than 60
different APNs from different Lepidoptera have been
sequenced and registered in databases showing the high
diversity in isoforms. Other putative receptors for Cry toxins are proteins [7], glycoconjugates [8], and glycolipids
[9].
Previous selection studies in the beet armyworm, S. exigua
showed the ability of this insect to develop high levels of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/96

resistance (>75-fold at generation 35) to the Cry1Ca activated toxin [10]. Binding of this protein to brush border
membrane vesicles (BBMV) from the midgut of the resistant insects was decreased 5-fold in affinity compared with
the susceptible insects [10].
In our study, using Suppression Subtractive Hybridization
(SSH), we compared S. exigua midgut gene expression
between Cry1Ca-exposed and non-exposed susceptible
insects and between resistant and susceptible nonexposed insects in order to identify genes that may be differentially expressed and therefore putatively involved in
the insect response to toxin action or in resistance. Based
on the SSH results, full cDNA sequences of four APNs
were obtained. Northern blot analysis showed the lack of
expression of one of the APNs in the insects from the
resistant colony.

Results
Isolation of APN encoding cDNAs
In order to study genes that might be involved in the
insect's response to intoxication by an active Cry toxin
and/or in the mechanism of resistance to such a toxin, we
took the approach of selection of cDNAs representing
genes, which are differentially expressed in these different
conditions. Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)
was performed, in the first experiment with midgut cDNA
from Cry1Ca-sensitive 5th instar S. exigua larvae that had
been raised on either control diet or on diet containing a
sublethal dose of Cry1Ca protein during the entire larval
life stage. Thus two pools of subtracted cDNAs were
obtained and cloned, one presumably containing cDNAs
representing genes with increased expression (library 1)
and one representing genes with decreased expression
(library 2) in response to toxin exposure, respectively.

In a second experiment, SSH was performed with midgut
cDNA pools from Cry1Ca-sensitive and Cry1Ca-resistant
5th instar larvae, both raised on diet without toxin. Thus
two more pools of subtracted cDNAs were obtained and
cloned, one representing genes with comparatively higher
expression in sensitive larva (library 3) and one with
lower expression in sensitive larva (library 4) as compared
to resistant larva.
From each of the four libraries 96 clones were randomly
picked and sequenced. Sequences were analyzed and
overlapping or identical sequences were assembled into
contigs. An in-depth analysis of the characterized
sequences and the studies on the expression of the corresponding genes by microarray analysis will be published
elsewhere. Homology searches with contig sequences
resulted in the identification of a number of contigs
encoding peptides with high homology to known

lepidopteran Aminopeptidase N sequences and were
selected for further studies.
In library 1 (higher expression in toxin-exposed larvae) we
identified two single sequences of 375 and 436 base pairs,
respectively. The first, designated contig 13 (APN2, following the classification of Nakanishi et al. [11]),
encoded a peptide with high homology with Lymantria
dispar APN2 [GenBank: AAD31184] amino acids 265 to
389 and almost equally high homology to a Bombyx mori
APN [GenBank: BAA32140]. The second, contig 31
(APN4) showed highest homology to Spodoptera litura
APN [GenBank: AAK69605] amino acids 173 to 296 and
to a lesser extent to a second B. mori APN [GenBank:
BAA33715]. The fact that the two encoded peptides were
overlapping but not entirely identical in the overlap
region, and were homologous to two different B. mori
APNs, indicated that they might be fragments of two different APN cDNAs.
In library 3 (higher expression in sensitive larvae compared to resistant larvae) we identified 3 contigs with
homology to APNs. Contig 82 (APN1) consisted of 6
identical copies of a 309 base pair fragment, while contigs
101 and 128 consisted of single fragments of 142 and 144
bp, respectively. All three sequences encoded peptides
with high homology to different parts of Helicoverpa
armigera APN1 [Genbank: AAK85538] (amino acids 19 to
123, 388 to 430, and 666 to 709 for contigs 82, 101, and
128, respectively) and to a lesser extent to a third B. mori
APN [Genbank: AAC33301]. Although the three peptides
were not overlapping, the high homology to single respresentatives of the APNs of H. armigera and B. mori indicated
that they might be derived from one single S. exigua
cDNA, different from the two cDNAs derived from library
1.
Overall results from SSH experiments provided the partial
sequence of 3 different APNs (APN1, 2 and 4). Since previous work [11,12] suggested the presence of at least four
different classes of APNs in Lepidoptera, a degenerate

primer (Table 1) based on the known sequences of APN
class 3 of other Lepidoptera was designed for the specific
amplification of the S. exigua APN corresponding to class
3 in 3'RACE experiments. Sequences obtained from
3'RACE were employed for the design of a primer for the
5' end fragment amplification (Table 1).
Aminopeptidase sequence analysis
Using the primers described in Table 1, overlapping fragments from the 5'-and 3'-ends of the four APNs were
amplified by RACE, cloned in pGEM-T Easy and
sequenced. Open reading frames (ORF) of 3063, 2880,
3015, and 2853 bp were obtained for APN1 [GenBank:
AY218842], APN2 [GenBank: AY218843], APN3 [GenBank: AY218844], and APN4 [GenBank: AY218845],
respectively (Fig. 1). Protein products of 1021, 960, 1005,
and 951 amino acids were predicted from the APN1,
APN2, APN3, and APN4 cDNA sequences, respectively.

The predicted proteins were aligned using ClustalX as
described in material and methods (Figure 2). Percentage
of identity among the different APNs ranged from 36.7
between APN1 and APN3 to 23.3 between APN2 and
APN3. Analysis of the N-terminal region of the predicted
proteins using the SignalP program [13] indicated the
presence of a signal peptide sequence in all four APNs
(residues enclosed by dashed lines in Figure 2). All four
APNs showed the presence of a zinc binding motif (residues enclosed by a solid line in Figure 2) and the GAMEN
motif (underlined) characteristic of the gluzincin aminopeptidases and involved in their aminopeptidase activity [14]. Analysis of the amino acid sequences using the
GPI Predictor Server [15] revealed the presence of a putative Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor site in
the C-terminal end of all four aminopeptidases. The predicted GPI-modification sites were localized in the amino
acid positions 1000 (APN1), 938 (APN2), 983 (APN3),
and 931 (APN4).
One allele each from all of the lepidopteran APNs deposited in GenBank so far (see methods section) were aligned

together with these four S. exigua APN's using the ClustalX
program. Phylogenetic tree construction showed that lepidopteran APNs group in five subfamilies (Figure 3).
Alignment also shows that the four S. exigua APNs
reported here each represent one of the larger four groups.
Our APN3 is highly homologous to a S. exigua APN protein sequence deposited in GenBank during the course of
our studies [GenBank: AAT99437]. Compared with the
APN3 from the susceptible colony employed in this study,
this APN showed 27 amino acid differences. Although
degenerate primers were designed for the RACE of a S. exigua cDNA representative of the putative class 5, we were
not able to obtain an amplification product corresponding to such an APN5. Bootstrapping analysis was performed in order to test the robustness of the generated
tree. Bootstrap values of 1000 were obtained for all the
main branches except for the one corresponding to the
Class 3 APN. For this branch a bootstrap value of 720 was
obtained, likely caused by the presence of the P. interpunctella APN [GenBank: AAC36148]. When this sequence was
omitted from the alignment, bootstrap values of 1000
were obtained for all the five branches.
APN expression analysis
The cDNA fragments of APN2 and APN4 originated each
as a single fragment from a library putatively representing
genes that were up-regulated in response to toxin exposure. However, when we compared expression of these
genes as well as of APN1 and APN3 between guts of larvae
exposed or not exposed to Cry1Ca toxin, by Northern

blotting, we found no evidence for regulation of their
expression by toxin exposure (Figure 4A).
The three cDNA contigs of APN1 were all derived from
library 3, putatively representing genes that are expressed
at a higher level in sensitive larvae compared to in resistant larvae. This suggested that APN1 was not, or at a lower
level, expressed in the resistant line. In order to determine
differences in expression levels of the APNs between the
susceptible and resistant larvae, Northern blot analysis
was performed with total RNA extracted from midguts of
5th instar larvae of both colonies. Northern blot analysis
showed that all four APNs are expressed in susceptible larvae (Figure 4B, "S" lanes). In agreement with the SSH
results, no expression of APN1 was detected in batches of
RNA from resistant larvae (around 10 larvae/batch), while
the other three APNs were expressed at levels similar to
that in susceptible larvae (Figure 4B, "R" lanes). Similar
results were obtained with different batches of RNA (at
least three) from the resistant insects and employing
higher concentrations of RNA or in RT-PCR experiments
specific for APN1 (data not shown), indicating that lack of
APN1 expression is virtually complete in the resistant colony. Since most bioassays and selections for resistance are
performed with the more toxin-sensitive neonate larvae in
stead of the 5th instar larvae used here, we also tested
APN1 expression in (whole) neonate larvae from the sensitive and resistant colonies. Also here, APN1 expression
was detectable in sensitive larvae, but not in resistant larvae (Fig. 4B, right panel).

Discussion
Based on the results from SSH experiments and in one
case by using degenerate primers (APN3), sequences of
four different APN cDNAs from S. exigua have been determined. Sequence analysis of the predicted proteins
showed the common structural characteristics that other
lepidopteran APNs have, such as signal peptides, zinc
binding sites, GAMEN motifs, and GPI-anchor sites.
Oltean et al. [12] suggested the distribution of the different lepidopteran APNs in at least 4 homology groups following phylogenetic analysis of the sequences. Nakanishi
et al. [11] called these groups class 1 to 4. Currently, with
the addition of new sequences to GenBank, a new analysis
clearly reveals the presence of at least five different classes
of APNs in Lepidoptera. Definition of the fifth class is not
only supported by the phylogenetic analysis of the
sequences but also by the presence of a sequence from
Helicoverpa armigera in all 5 branches [GenBank:

AAK85538, AAW72993, AAN04900, AAM44056, and
AAK85539]. Amplification of a S. exigua cDNA representing class 5 was attempted without success. Possible
explanations could be that the degenerate primers used
for the amplification of this APN were designed based on
the consensus of only two sequences, and the selected
primer sequences may not be conserved in a S. exigua
APN5. Alternatively, S. exigua may not have a gene for the
class 5 APN, or its expression in the midgut is too low to
be picked up as cDNA.
SSH comparison between the susceptible and the resistant
colonies suggested a lower expression of APN1 in the
resistant insects compared with the susceptible insects.
This difference in the expression was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4B), showing clearly the absence of
expression of this APN in the resistant insects, both in 5th
instar larvae as well as in neonate larvae. APN has been

described, together with cadherin-like proteins, as one of
the proteins involved in the binding of Cry1A toxins to
the midgut of several lepidopteran species [6,12,16-21].
Recently new evidence of the importance of APNs in the
mode of action of Bt toxins was obtained by transformation of Drosophila melanogaster with the M. sexta class 1
APN [Genbank: CCA61452]. Expression of this APN in
the midgut of the D. melanogaster larvae increased the susceptibility of these insects to Cry1Ac toxin [22].

In the case of Cry1Ca toxin, Luo et al. [23] using toxin
affinity chromatography, detected and isolated a 106 kDa
APN from M. sexta that bound to Cry1Ca. Although the
entire sequence of this 106 kDa APN has not been published, its N-terminal sequence is nearly identical (9 out of
10 amino acids) to the sequence of the published M. sexta
class 1 APN [GenBank: CAA61452] [24] and [GenBank:
AAF07223] [25], and much more different from the M.
sexta class 2, 3, and 4 APNs. This strongly suggests that at
least one of the M. sexta Cry1Ca-binding proteins is a class
1 APN.

Agrawal et al. [26] cloned a Spodoptera litura class 4 APN
cDNA, slapn [GenBank: AAK69605], and expressed it in
insect cells, detecting binding of Cry1Ca toxin to the surface of the cells expressing this APN. More recent results
showed that silencing of the expression of the slapn in S.
litura by RNA interference (RNAi) through injection of a
756 bp dsRNA fragment, reduced the susceptibility of
these insects to Cry1Ca [27].

porting the binding of Cry1Ca toxins to APN either in M.
sexta or S. litura, strongly support the notion that lack of
APN1 in S. exigua is responsible, at least in part, for resistance to Cry1Ca in this resistant line. Future work on the
possible role of the APN in toxin binding, including heterologous expression or down-regulation by RNA interference strategies may further support this role.

Conclusion
So far, only one fully characterized gene has been associated with the development of resistance to Bt toxins in
Lepidoptera. Gahan et al. [5] studied the Heliothis virescens
YHD2 resistant strain and detected a strong linkage
between the resistance to Cry1Ac toxin and the disruption
of a cadherin gene. Unfortunately, since our S. exigua
resistant line was lost during the development of this
research, analysis of linkage between the resistance to
Cry1Ca and the lack of APN1 expression could not be
performed.

We have cloned and characterized four different midgut
cDNAs from S. exigua, representing 4 out of 5 putative
classes of lepidopteran APNs and have shown that one of
these was not expressed in the larvae of a Cry1Ca-resistant
colony. Combined with other evidence of the importance
of APN in the mode of action of B. thuringiensis toxins
these results suggest that the lack of APN1 expression
plays a role in the resistance to Cry1Ca in this S. exigua
colony.

Methods
Data from SSH with resistant vs susceptible insects, support a possible role of the APNs in the mode of action of
Bt toxins in Lepidoptera. Previous binding studies with
the resistant line employed here, showed a 5-fold decrease
in the binding affinity of Cry1Ca toxin to brush border
membrane vesicles prepared with midguts from the resistant line. All these data together with previous work sup-

Insects and tissue isolation
Cry1Ca-sensitive (parental strain of the Cry1Ca-resistant
colony) and Cry1Ca resistant S. exigua larvae were
obtained from laboratory colonies maintained at Auburn
University [10]. The Cry1Ca-resistant population was
selected with trypsinized Cry1Ca at 320 µg/gram diet
most generations, including the generation preceding that

from which eggs were obtained for gene expression studies [10]. Eggs were hatched and larvae reared on artificial
diet at 28°C. Midguts were pulled from early 5th instar larvae after cutting off the hindbody between the last two
pairs of prolegs. Next, midguts were cut longitudinally
and washed in phosphate-buffered physiological saline to
remove gut contents. Midguts were stored at -80°C until
further use.
Toxin isolation
Escherichia coli expressing Cry1Ca was grown for protoxin
production and protoxin was extracted, solubilized and
trypsin-treated as described before [28]. Trypsinized (activated) toxin was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM
sodium hydrogencarbonate pH9, 150 mM sodium chloride and quantified by SDS-PAGE. For feeding studies
toxin solutions were diluted with PBS (Phosphate Buffered-Saline) to 250 ng Cry1Ca per gram diet and mixed
with autoclaved artificial agar-based diet, which had been
cooled to 55°C. Control diets merely contained equal
amounts of PBS.
mRNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted from whole 5th instar midguts
using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Almere) according to the protocols provided by the supplier.
mRNA was purified from total RNA using GenoPrep
oligo-dT beads (GenoVision, Oslo). Concentration of
mRNA was calculated from OD260 and mRNA quality
checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Subtracted cDNA-fragment library construction
In order to isolate cDNA fragments representing mRNAs
more abundant in midgut tissue of toxin-exposed or control diet-fed larvae, we used Suppression Subtractive
Hybridization (SSH) [29] with the Clontech PCR-Select
cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto), according to
the protocols provided by the supplier. Briefly, pools of
mRNA were isolated as described above from 10 5th instar
beet armyworm midguts (exposed or unexposed to
Cry1Ca toxin). cDNA was synthesized with AMV reverse
transcriptase (first strand) and DNA polymerase I, and E.
coli DNA ligase in the presence of RNase H followed by T4
DNA polymerase (second strand). cDNAs were digested
with RsaI, and appropriate linkers were ligated to the
resulting cDNA fragments of the "tester" pool using T4
DNA ligase. cDNA fragment pools resulting from subtractive hybridization representing toxin-induced mRNAs
("exposed" pool as tester and "control" cDNA as driver) or
for toxin-repressed mRNAs (reciprocal experiment) were
further enriched with a "suppression PCR" step. Thus
enriched cDNA pools were ligated into the vector pGEMT Easy (Promega Benelux B.V., Leiden) and used for transformation of E. coli strain JM109.

In a second subtraction library construction experiment,
cDNAs from 5th instar larval guts of the Cry1Ca-sensitive
line and of the Cry1Ca-selected line (both grown on diet
without toxin), were used for subtractive hybridization.
Pools containing cDNAs representing genes that were
putatively expressed at a higher level (when cDNA of
resistant insects was used as "tester") or at lower level
(when cDNA of sensitive insects was used as "tester") in
the resistant line compared to the sensitive line were separately ligated into pGEM-T Easy and used for transformation of E. coli strain JM109.
Ampiflication of cDNA-5' and 3' fragments
For selected cDNA-fragments, both 3' as well as 5' cDNA
fragments were amplified using the SMART RACE-kit
from Clontech. For all cDNA-ends 5'-ready and 3'-ready
cDNA pools were produced from reverse transcribed
mRNA (using PowerScript reverse transcriptase) isolated
from midguts of 5th instar susceptible S. exigua exposed to
toxin as described above. cDNA specific primers used for
the 5' and 3' cDNA amplifications are listed in Table 1.
Amplified cDNA-end fragments were purified using a
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Benelux B.V.,
Venlo) and ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Benelux
B.V., Leiden).
DNA sequencing and sequence analysis
DNA sequencing was performed by the dye-termination
method using Bigdye terminator sequence mix (PE
Applied Biosystems Benelux; Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel) in an
ABI 3700 automatic DNA sequencer. All oligonucleotides
were obtained from Eurogentec (Brussels). DNA sequence
homology searches were performed using the BlastX algorithm [30].

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences corresponding to the cloned APNs and phylogenetic reconstruction were performed using the ClustalX program
[31]. A preliminary alignment was performed with the 61
different complete APNs protein sequences in the database. Based on the first alignment, redundant sequences,
probably representing alleles from the same APN in the
same insect species (identity higher than 95 %) were
screened and a representative member for each class-species combination was selected for further analysis. A second phylogenetic reconstruction was performed with the
31 selected APNs and the four APNs isolated in current
work. Phylogenetic reconstruction was obtained by the
neighbor-joining method [32] together with bootstrap
analysis using 1000 replicates. Kimura correction for multiple substitutions was applied [33].
Northern blot expression analyses
Total RNA (1 µg) extracted from midgut tissue or whole
neonate larvae was heat-denatured and applied to a 1%

agarose gel in 2.2 M formaldehyde-MOPS buffer. After
electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred overnight onto
nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics, Almere) and then
UV crosslinked for 60 seconds. The labeled probe was prepared as follows. cDNA fragments cloned in pGEM-T Easy
were amplified by PCR using M13 primers. The PCR products were purified and used as template for in vitro transcription using the SP6 polymerase in the presence of
Digoxigenin-UTP, following the procedure described in
the DIG RNA labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Almere).
Probe fragments of the APNs corresponded to the 5' end
of the cDNA of each gene. As a control for equal loading
of the Northern blots a probe corresponding to a cDNA
fragment with homology to an ATP synthase obtained
from the first subtraction library was used, for which
microarray experiments showed no differential expression
over a wide range of conditions (results not shown). The
sizes of the probes were approximately 1300 bases
(APN1), 1000 bases (APN2), 850 bases (APN4), and 700
bases (APN3, and ATP synthase) (Fig. 1). Hybridization
and detection was performed following the instructions of
the Dig Northern Starter Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Almere).
