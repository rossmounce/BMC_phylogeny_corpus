Scaling properties of protein family phylogenies
Alejandro Herrada1*, Víctor M Eguíluz1, Emilio Hernández-García1 and Carlos M Duarte2,3

Abstract
Background: One of the classical questions in evolutionary biology is how evolutionary processes are coupled at
the gene and species level. With this motivation, we compare the topological properties (mainly the depth scaling,
as a characterization of balance) of a large set of protein phylogenies with those of a set of species phylogenies.
Results: The comparative analysis between protein and species phylogenies shows that both sets of phylogenies
share a remarkably similar scaling behavior, suggesting the universality of branching rules and of the evolutionary
processes that drive biological diversification from gene to species level. In order to explain such generality, we
propose a simple model which allows us to estimate the proportion of evolvability/robustness needed to
approximate the scaling behavior observed in the phylogenies, highlighting the relevance of the robustness of a
biological system (species or protein) in the scaling properties of the phylogenetic trees.
Conclusions: The invariance of the scaling properties at levels spanning from genes to species suggests that rules that
govern the incapability of a biological system to diversify are equally relevant both at the gene and at the species level.

Background
During the last century, an important effort has been
devoted to the understanding of diversification patterns
and processes in terms of branching evolutionary trees
[1-7]. Tempo and mode of genetic change, and their
connections with tempo and mode of speciation is an
important issue in this context. In that sense, we address
the question of whether similar forces act across the
gene level and species-level evolution [8-10], through a
comparative analysis of the topological behavior of protein and species phylogenies.
Previous analyses of the topological properties of phylogenies have revealed universal patterns of phylogenetic differentiation [3,6,7,11,12]. This means that the impact of
evolutionary forces shaping the diversity of life on Earth
on the shape of phylogenetic trees is, at least to the level
of detail captured by the descriptors used, similar across a
broad range of scales, from macro-evolution to speciation
and population differentiation, and across diverse organisms such as eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaea or viruses,
thereby. This together with the fact that evolutionary
forces work at molecular level motivates the study of the
topology of evolutionary relationships among molecular

entities, looking for patterns of differentiation at such
molecular level, thereby extending the examination of the
universality of the scaling of branching laws in phylogenies
all the way from molecular- to macro-evolution.
The term “protein family” was coined by Dayhoff in
the 1960’s to comprise similar proteins in structure and/
or function, which are presumed to have evolved from a
common ancestor protein [13]. Our analysis is based on
a thorough data set of 7,738 protein families downloaded from the PANDIT database http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/goldman-srv/pandit/[14] on May 27th 2008. It contains families with a broad range of sizes (see Figure 1).
Taking into account that protein family diversification is
driven by alternative evolutionary processes beyond speciation (orthology), such as gene duplication (paralogy),
these data were used to test if the universal patterns
found previously in species, subspecies, and higher taxonomic levels, also apply at the molecular evolutionary
level. In particular we use tools derived from modern
network theory [7,15-18] to examine the scaling of the
branching in the protein family phylogenies.
A protein family phylogeny is represented as a tree, i.e.,
as an acyclic graph of nodes connected by branches
(links), where each node represents a diversification
event. For each node in a phylogeny, a subtree (or subfamily) S is made of the root at the selected node and all
of its descendant nodes. The subtree size A is the total

number of subfamily members that diversify from the
root (including itself). The characterization of how protein diversity is arranged through the phylogenies can be
achieved in a variety of ways [19-26]. We focus here on
the mean depth, d, of the subtree S (see Methods)
[6,27,28] defined as: d = j droot,j /A, where, for a given
node j, droot,j is its topological distance to the root of the
subtree S, that is, the number of nodes one has to go
through so as to go from that node to the root (including
the root in the counting), and the sum is over all nodes
in the subtree S. Note that we use here the mean depth
over all subtree nodes and not just the leaves, which
gives a different but related measure [4,29,30]. In the
remainder, when no subindex is indicated, we understand
that mean depth and other quantities refer to a whole
tree or a subtree depending on the context.
How the shape of a phylogenetic tree, i.e., the distribution of protein diversification, changes with tree size, i.e.,
with the number of proteins it contains, can be analyzed

by examining the dependence of the mean depth on subfamily size d = d(A). This gives information on the balance characteristics of the tree. To be clearer, in the
additional file 1 we show the analysis of A and d for a
fully balanced and a fully imbalanced 15-tip tree, as well
as for a 15-tip subtree of a real phylogenetic tree. For a
given tree size, the smallest value of the mean depth corresponds to the fully polytomic tree. The mean depth d
as a function of tree size A is given in this case by
dmin = 1 −

For large sizes the leading contribution is d min ~ 1.

by the fully imbalanced, or asymmetric, binary tree with

which for large sizes A leads to the scaling behavior
dmax ~ A. The fully balanced, or symmetric, binary tree
is inside these extremes, with a mean depth given by
d=

((A + 1) ln2 (A + 1) − 2A)
.

The leading contribution at large sizes is logarithmic:
d ~ ln A. This logarithmic scaling is not exclusive of
fully balanced trees, it is also the behavior of the EqualRates Markov (ERM) model [28,31,32], the natural null
model for stochastic tree construction, in which, at each
time step, one of the existing leaves of the tree is chosen
at random and bifurcated into two new leaves.
We report here the patterns of mean depth for protein
families, and compare the branching patterns derived for
protein families, from the PANDIT database with those
of species phylogenies, reported previously from the
TreeBASE database [7]. This comparison shows that
branching patterns are mostly preserved across evolutionary scales spanning from genes to species.

Results
Protein phylogenies depth scaling

The analysis of the 7,738 protein phylogenies of PANDIT database shows (Figure 2) that the scaling of the
mean depth with tree size lies between the two extreme
topologies for binary trees (fully imbalanced and fully

8

balanced trees), with the exception of a few polytomic
subtrees, which display mean depth values lower that
the one expected for the same size fully balanced binary
tree. The data for independent protein trees are not
scattered between the extreme cases but instead cluster
in a space intermediate between these extremes depending on the size of the trees. Figure 2 displays depth,
averaged within logarithmic bins of values of tree size A,
as a function of A. The axes of this and other plots in
the following have been chosen so that a depth behavior
of the form d ~ (ln A) 2 will appear as a straight line.
This is the behavior suggested by the models in [33,34]
and for organisms phylogenies in [6], which seems to
correspond rather well to our data. The fully imbalanced
tree shows a linear dependence d ~ A, and the fully
balanced tree shows a logarithmic dependence of the
form d ~ ln A (lines also shown in Figure 2).
We analyzed the scaling of the mean depth as function of the tree size for different protein functions (e.g.
nuclear, structural, metabolic) to assess whether different protein functions show scaling laws departing from
the average mean depth scaling described for the whole
PANDIT database. The results obtained show that the
depth of different protein functions shows the same
scaling with tree size as that described for the whole
PANDIT dataset independently of function (Figure 3).
This result supports the existence of universal scaling
laws in the depth of protein phylogenies.
The universality observed in the depth scaling of protein phylogenies is even more remarkable when protein
phylogenies are compared with the species phylogenies
[7] obtained from the TreeBASE database (Figure 4).

TreeBASE shows a similar scaling of the mean depth
with the tree size for both datasets. Although in a previous work with organism phylogenies the depth scaling
was fitted to a power law [7], we find here that the
squared logarithmic scaling d ~ (ln A)2 of [6,33,34] provides also a reasonable fit for the protein families. Discriminating between these two scaling laws requires the
comparison of larger trees, which are not available at
the moment. Further discussion on this point is provided in the additional file 2. The important point, however, is that the analysis of protein phylogenies shows
that the trees follow a scaling law as they speciate,
which is universal across protein functions, and similar
to that associated with the speciation at the species
level.
There is some dispersion of the mean depth for the
whole PANDIT dataset observed in Figure 2, which is
attributable to imbalanced bifurcations in some specific
trees. This increase in the presence of imbalanced bifurcations is reflected as a fast increase, characteristic of
fully imbalanced trees. These regions with a high number of imbalanced bifurcations are most of the times
close to the root, which can be related to a lack of resolution in the reconstruction process. In Figure 5 we
show a detailed example of a phylogenetic tree with a
region with a high presence of imbalance in the bifurcations close to the root, that leads to a dispersion from
the mean depth scaling in the range A Î (2 × 102, 3 ×
102), preserving the previously described universal mean
depth scaling behavior in most of the size range, from 1
to 2 × 102. The fact that the deviation from the mean is
restricted only to certain regions of the phylogenetic
trees, and that they do not affect significatively the

The depth scaling behavior shared by protein and species phylogenies can be explained by different branching
mechanisms. In this direction, during the last decade,
several models have been published proposing different
mechanisms to capture the topology of phylogenetic
trees [6,27,28,33,35,36]. Most of the models proposed
yield a logarithmic scaling of the mean depth, i.e., ERMtype for large sizes [31,32,37], which is not a good
description of our data (see Figure 2 and additional file
2), at least at the tree sizes available; the AB model proposed in Ref. [33] is one of the few models that deviate
from the ERM-like scaling leading to a squared logarithmic d ~ (ln A) 2 (see also [6]); models with power law
scaling of the mean depth d ~ A h have also been
defined in terms of statistical rules assigning probabilities to different splittings or types of trees [33] or in
terms of (simplified) evolutionary events (in the sense
specified in Ref. [35]) occurring in time [27,28].
An alternative explanation of the scaling properties of
the phylogenetic trees [36] suggests that the non-ERM
behavior is a small-size transient behavior, which would
cross-over to the ERM scaling d ~ ln A as larger tree
sizes become available.
The process conducive to trees that deviate from ERM
behavior is the presence of temporal correlations, which
leads to asymptotic or just finite-size deviations with
respect to the ERM behavior depending on whether these
correlations are permanent or restricted to finite but large
times. We, thus, explored the role of such correlations
through a simple model based on the inheritability of the
evolvability, i.e., the ability to evolve [38,39], as a biological
characteristic which is itself inherited by sister species in
speciation events. The process starts with the root, which
we consider capable to speciate. At each time step, all present species capable to speciate branch simultaneously.
Each branching event yields two new daughter species, for
which we allow two possible outcomes:
• with probability p, the new species inherit the evolvability of the mother species, i.e., they have the
same capacity as the mother species to speciate
again;
• with probability 1- p, one of the daughter species is
unable to speciate again, that is, only one of the two
daughter species preserves the ability to evolve. Stemming from the definition of robustness as the property
of a system to remain invariant in the presence of

The first case gives rise to a symmetric speciation
event, in which the two species emerging from the
speciation event are similar, while the second one giving rise to asymmetries in the tree. If p = 1, we recover
the completely balanced binary tree, while the topology
obtained in the other extreme, p = 0, is the completely
imbalanced binary tree (Figure 6). Thus the model
combines symmetric with asymmetric branching introducing correlations (since one occurrence of the asymmetric event precludes further speciation on that
branch), with the proportion determined by the parameter p.
The trees generated with this algorithm yield a scaling very close to those observed for phylogenetic trees
in both PANDIT and TreeBASE for p = 0.24 (see Figure 6, and additional file 3). This result identifies the
prevalence of imbalanced branching events (occurring
with frequency 1- p = 0.76) relative to balanced ones
(p = 0.24), which is consistent with earlier reports
[5,6,33].
The correlations introduced by our model are not,
however, permanent and ultimately a crossover to the
random behavior appears for long sizes. To evaluate
this, we calculated the analytical expression of the average depth, d. Taking into account that the expected
number of o springs of a pair of sister nodes is 2z = 4p
+ 2(1 - p) = 2(1 + p), starting with the root, the
expected number of nodes after n branching events is

At large n, the leading contributions are A ~ zn and C
~ nzn (we do not write explicitly prefactors which may
depend on z but not on n). Taking into account Eq. (7)
in Methods (i.e. d = (C/A) - 1) and inverting the relationship between A and n (n ~ ln A), we obtain that for
large sizes the leading order of the mean depth is d ~ ln
A, which indicates that what we observe in the simulations is a long transient behavior. This transient behavior leads to the fact that our model ts the proper
behavior of the data at the sizes in the databases, but
the asymptotic scaling at the larger sizes will finally be d
~ ln A, as in the ERM.

Discussion
The development of high-throughput “-omics” has provided the data required to address the traditional debate
on how gene-level evolution shapes the species-level
evolution [8-10]. This debate connects with that on the
(dis)continuity between micro- and macro-evolution,
and gradualism versus saltationism [41-43]. In the context of these debates, the universal scaling of phylogenetic trees at intra and inter-specific levels shown earlier
[7] suggested the conservation of the evolutionary processes that drive biological diversification across the
entire history of life. Here we extend this observation
further to demonstrate that the universality of the scaling properties can also be extrapolated to the gene-level.
The results presented here show that the branching and
scaling patterns in protein families do not differ significantly from the patterns observed in species phylogenies, at least for the topological properties we have
calculated. We do not observe any discrepancy between
the shape of protein phylogenies and species phylogenies. Moreover, the results presented here shows no evidence for possible differences in phylogenetic trees
among protein families with different biological functions, further providing evidence of universal, conserved
evolutionary processes from genes to species.
In 2006, Cotton and Page published a comparative
analysis between human gene phylogenies and species
phylogenies [24]. They found quantitative differences

Herrada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:155
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/155

between human paralogous gene and orthologous gene
phylogenies. Their research focused on the comparison
between (small) paralogous and orthologous gene
families, while here we have analyzed complete protein
families, which included both paralogous and orthologous protein members, focusing on the comparison
between protein and species phylogenies. Our approach
is based on a scaling analysis, examining how variables
change with tree size, whereas the Cotton-Page’s
approach is based on a quantitative analysis of small
sizes. This implies that despite their finding of quantitative differences between paralogous and orthologous
gene phylogenies, we expect that both phylogenies
would display scaling behavior similar to that we
described here for complete protein phylogenies and
organism phylogenies [7].
Different evolutionary models and mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the branching patterns arising
in evolution [6,27,28,33,36,37]. Here we have introduced
a simple model accounting for differences in the degree
of evolvability, which is emerging as a key trait constraint
as important as robustness in evolution [44-47]. The
model we proposed can be interpreted in the framework
of the balance between evolvability as the potential of a
biological system for future adaptive mutation and evolution [39], and robustness as the property of a system to
produce relatively invariant output in the presence of a
perturbation [40]. Indeed, the symmetric diversification
event should correspond to the biological context in
which the biological system is evolvable, while the asymmetric diversification process should correspond to a biological context where the new biological system, which
has just appeared from the diversification process, is
robust and unable of unlimited diversification.
The asymptotic behavior of our model at long tree
sizes recovers the logarithmic behavior of the ERM scaling, so that, as in the models by [36], the non-ERM
behavior occurs as a transient for the relatively small
tree sizes present in the databases. Despite this, the
local (i.e. present for finite sizes) imbalance in real trees
can be interpreted in terms of the evolvability concept.
The prevalence of the unbalanced branching found is
consistent with previous works [6,33,48-51], and has
been traditionally explained by the presence of variations in the speciation and/or extinction rates throughout the Tree of Life [4,5].
Different biological explanations for these variations in
the speciation and/or extinction rates have been proposed, such as: refractory period [52], mass extinctions
[53], specialization [4] or environment effects [54]. The
consideration of an evolutionary scenario based on the
evolvability/robustness interplay has led us to postulate
the presence of asymmetric diversification events over

Page 7 of 9

the depth scaling during evolutionary processes giving
rise to a new biological system which is unable to
undergo a new diversification event. An incapability to
diversify may occur at different levels of evolution, and
can be found at the macroevolutionary level with taxa
that require very long refractory periods or with random
massive extinctions of taxa, as well as at the microevolutionary or gene level, where the elements unable to
diversify are individuals from a population or genetic
variants from a cell, embryo or individual.

Conclusions
In summary, the finding of universal scaling properties
at gene and species level, characterized by the similar
scaling laws, strongly suggest the universality of branching rules, and hence of the evolutionary processes that
drive biological diversification across the entire history
of life, from genes to species. The topological characterization of phylogenetic trees has proven helpful to analyze the relevance of the robustness of a biological
system (species or protein) in the scaling properties of
the phylogenetic trees. Thus, the invariance of the scaling properties at levels spanning from genes to species
suggests that the mechanisms leading to the incapability
of a biological system to diversify for a very long period
of time act at both the gene- and species-level.
Methods
0.1 Protein phylogenies database

We analyzed the 7,738 protein families available in the
PANDIT database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/
pandit/ accession date May 27, 2008) [14]. PANDIT is
based upon Pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[55], and constitutes a large collection of protein family phylogenies
from different signalling pathways, cellular organelles
and biological functions, reconstructed with five different methods: NJ [56], BioNJ [57], Weighbor [58], FastME [59] and Phyml [60]. The size of each of the
protein phylogenies, T, ranges from 2 to more than
2000 tips (i.e. proteins within families) and, in agreement with previous reports [20,61-64], shows a power
law distribution P(T) ~T-g (see Figure 1). Most of the
bifurcations in these phylogenies are binary, with only
22% of polytomic bifurcations.
0.2 Mean depth

The definition of the mean depth d used here is directly
related to the cumulative branch size [7,16-18,65]
defined as C = j Aj. The sum runs over all nodes j in a
tree and A j corresponds to the size of the subtree S j .
The relationship between C and the mean depth can be
obtained taking into account that the cumulative branch
size can also be written as

Herrada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:155

C=

(droot,j + 1) = dA + A,
j

Page 8 of 9

(6)

where d root,j is the distance of node j to the root.
Thus, the mean depth of a tree is obtained as
d=

C
− 1.
A

(7)

The depth of a tree can also be characterized by taking
into account only the distance from the tips to the root.
This is the case of the Sackin’s index, S, which is defined
as the sum of the depths of all the leaves of the tree
S = j droot,j[29]. Taking into account that a binary tree
can be obtained as a growing tree adding at each time a
speciation event we can calculate the change ΔC and ΔS
at each speciation. If the distance of the node that speciates (leading to two new nodes) to the root is d’ then
C = 2(d + 2) = 2d + 4,

(8)

while
S = −d + 2(d + 1) = d + 2.

(9)

Accounting for the initial condition, that is, the root,
with C = 1 and S = 0, yields C = 2S + 1 for binary trees.
Thus, at large sizes, both quantities, C and S, become
proportional and scale in the same way with size.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Branch size and mean depth examples. The values
of the branch size, A and of the mean depth, d, are shown (in brackets,
as (A,d)) at each node of a fully balanced 15-tip phylogenetic tree (a), a
fully imbalanced 15-tip phylogenetic tree (b), a 15-tip subtree of a real
phylogenetic tree.
Additional file 2: Power-law vs. logarithmic scaling of the depth with
tree size. We compare the local exponents of the possible scaling laws of
the depth with tree size for PANDIT. For sizes larger than 300 fluctuations
make estimations unreliable. Filled squares: For the power-law scaling d ~
Ah the local exponent at bin i is calculated as hi = Δi ln d/Δi ln A, where Δi
indicates the difference between two consecutive bins, for instance Δi ln d
= ln d(i + 1) ln d(i). Empty diamonds: For the log scaling d ~ (ln A)b the
local exponent at bin i is calculated as bi = Δi ln d/Δi ln ln A. Constant
values of the local exponents, or values approaching a given value as sizes
increase, indicate appropriateness of the corresponding scaling laws to
describe the data. For the power-law scaling, the exponent is around h ≃
0.5 and slightly decays for larger trees. For the logarithmic scaling, the
exponent approaches 2 as larger trees are considered, indicating d ~ (ln A)
2
. The results indicate comparable quality of fit for both laws at the reliable
range. Note that the simpler logarithmic law, b = 1, is not supported by
the available data.
