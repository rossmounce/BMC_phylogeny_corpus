Abstract
Background: Thousands of parthenogenetic animal species have been described and cytogenetic
manifestations of this reproductive mode are well known. However, little is understood about the
molecular determinants of parthenogenesis. The Daphnia pulex genome must contain the molecular
machinery for different reproductive modes: sexual (both male and female meiosis) and
parthenogenetic (which is either cyclical or obligate). This feature makes D. pulex an ideal model to
investigate the genetic basis of parthenogenesis and its consequences for gene and genome
evolution. Here we describe the inventory of meiotic genes and their expression patterns during
meiotic and parthenogenetic reproduction to help address whether parthenogenesis uses existing
meiotic and mitotic machinery, or whether novel processes may be involved.
Results: We report an inventory of 130 homologs representing over 40 genes encoding proteins
with diverse roles in meiotic processes in the genome of D. pulex. Many genes involved in cell cycle
regulation and sister chromatid cohesion are characterized by expansions in copy number. In
contrast, most genes involved in DNA replication and homologous recombination are present as
single copies. Notably, RECQ2 (which suppresses homologous recombination) is present in multiple
copies while DMC1 is the only gene in our inventory that is absent in the Daphnia genome.
Expression patterns for 44 gene copies were similar during meiosis versus parthenogenesis,
although several genes displayed marked differences in expression level in germline and somatic
tissues.
Conclusion: We propose that expansions in meiotic gene families in D. pulex may be associated
with parthenogenesis. Taking into account our findings, we provide a mechanistic model of
parthenogenesis, highlighting steps that must differ from meiosis including sister chromatid
cohesion and kinetochore attachment.

Background
Sexual reproduction (i.e. meiosis and syngamy) is the predominant reproductive mode in eukaryotes, yet parthenogenesis (i.e. asexual reproduction) is present in all major
lineages. Among animals, cyclical parthenogenesis, which

alternates bouts of clonal and sexual reproduction, is
restricted to monogonont rotifers, digenean trematodes,
and several arthropod lineages [1]. Obligate parthenogenesis is much more common but is predicted ultimately to
drive lineages to extinction due to the accumulation of

deleterious mutations or inability to adapt to environmental changes [2]. The origins of obligate parthenogens
are often attributed to the loss of meiosis via interspecific
hybridization [3,4] or irreversible changes in ploidy [5,6],
yet other mechanisms must also exist. Among animals,
thousands of parthenogenetic species have been
described, and volumes have been written describing the
cytogenetic manifestations of many different types of parthenogenesis (e.g. [7-9]), but little is understood about
molecular determinants of these processes.
The microcrustacean Daphnia pulex reproduces by cyclical
parthenogenesis. Direct-developing eggs (also called subitaneous or summer eggs) are produced parthenogenetically and immediately develop in the female's brood
chamber prior to hatching. During the sexual cycle, haploid resting eggs (also called ephippial, diapause, or winter eggs) are produced by meiosis and require fertilization
and a period of extended dormancy for development to
complete. Because sex determination in Daphnia is environmentally induced [10,11], males are genetic clones of
their mothers. In addition, genetic and phenotypic evidence has revealed D. pulex lineages that reproduce by
obligate parthenogenesis. These obligate parthenogenetic
lineages produce direct-developing eggs by parthenogenesis, which is indistinguishable from parthenogenesis in
cyclical lineages. However, obligate parthenogens have
lost the requirement for meiosis and fertilization to produce viable resting eggs [12]; unfertilized resting eggs
undergo a period of diapause and develop parthenogenetically to eventually hatch and produce a juvenile. Importantly, the resting egg parthenogenesis exhibited by these
obligate asexual lineages is cytologically distinct from
direct-developing egg parthenogenesis in both obligate
and cyclical parthenogenetic lineages and from meiosis.
Hence, although the terms "cyclical parthenogenesis" and
"obligate parthenogenesis" may also refer to breeding systems, herein we use these terms to distinguish parthenogenetic oogenesis that takes place during directdeveloping (in cyclical and obligate asexuals) and resting
egg development (in obligate asexuals only), respectively.
Therefore, the D. pulex genome must contain the molecular machinery to accommodate various types of reproductive modes: meiosis (male and female) and
parthenogenetic oogenesis in both cyclical and obligate
parthenogenetic lineages. This feature makes D. pulex an
ideal model to investigate the genetic basis of parthenogenesis, and its consequences for gene and genome evolution.
Resting egg parthenogenesis in Daphnia is cytologically
distinct compared to direct-developing egg parthenogenesis (e.g. with respect to chromosome morphology and egg
size [13]). However, while obligate parthenogenesis
apparently involves initial meiotic pairing (but without

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

homologous recombination) followed by a mitotic or
mitotic-like division ([13,14]; Tsuchiya and Zolan, pers.
comm), neither obligate nor cyclical parthenogenesis
seems to be strictly mitotic since a polar body is extruded
during cell division, indicative of meiosis [15]. In both
cases, heterozygosity is maintained, except in rare
instances of loss of heterozygosity presumably caused by
mitotic crossing over [16]. Obligate parthenogenesis in
Daphnia is limited to the D. pulex complex (D. pulex, D.
pulicaria and D. middendorffiana, D. tenebrosa) [17] and to
the D. carinata complex (D. thomsoni, D. cephalata) [17],
and at least in some cases, the trait is passed by male offspring of obligate asexuals into sexual backgrounds,
implying a sex-limited meiosis suppressor [12]. In D.
pulex, obligate asexuality has been migrating from northeastern to central North America, and most clonal lineages are estimated to be no more than 12,000 – 120,000
yr [18,19]. Recent association mapping of obligate asexuality in Daphnia has found markers on four different chromosomes exhibiting significant association with
parthenogenetic production of resting eggs in obligate
asexuals [19]. This suggests that obligate asexuality and
(by implication) the mechanistic transition from meiosis
to parthenogenesis could be influenced by at least four
epistatically interacting loci.
Specifically, we are interested in genes that encode components essential for meiosis in D. pulex. A cyclically parthenogenetic D. pulex lineage possesses genes required for
both meiosis and parthenogenesis. To ultimately establish whether modifications to the meiotic machinery are
associated with parthenogenesis, we must first determine
which meiotic genes are present and expressed in cyclically parthenogenetic lineages. Then, we can compare the
inventory and expression patterns of these same genes in
obligate parthenogens. If obligate parthenogens have
truly abandoned canonical meiosis altogether, genes
required specifically for meiosis should be under reduced
selective constraint and become non-functional over
time. However, certain meiotic processes, perhaps in a
modified form, may still be required for parthenogenesis
and, thus, genes required for such processes may still be
intact and expressed. Differences in the inventory, evolutionary rates and expression of meiotic genes in cyclical
and obligate parthenogens may provide insight into the
importance of meiotic genes for the evolution of parthenogenesis.
During a typical animal meiosis (Fig. 1), a germline stemcell (GSC) divides asymmetrically producing a daughter
GSC and either a cystoblast (females) or gonialblast
(males) [9]. During both meiosis and parthenogenesis in
Daphnia females, incomplete mitoses create a 4-cell cystoblast which matures into an oocyte cluster of three nurse
cells and the presumptive oocyte [15]. Only later in vitel-

Meiotic genes annotated in the D. pulex genome (shown in boxes) and a schematic of a possible model for parthenogenesis
Meiotic genes annotated in the D. pulex genome (shown in boxes) and a schematic of a possible model for parthenogenesis. Arrows indicate their roles in meiosis, and potentially in parthenogenesis. Proteins in bold are encoded by multiple gene copies in D. pulex (some non-annotated genes are italicized; see text for details). A timeline (top) for three stages of
meiosis (meiosis entry, recombination, and segregation) is indicated at the top. Meiosis I events from germline stem cell (GSC)
division (1) through DSB formation, synapsis and recombination (2–9), kinetochore attachment (10) and anaphase (11) occur
during canonical meiosis I. Meiosis II follows (12), with the loss of centromeric cohesion and segregation of sister chromatids
resulting in the final haploid gamete. In our model for parthenogenesis (bottom), sister chromatid cohesion somehow differs
from meiosis while altered heterochromatin and centromere formation may be important for homolog pairing and segregation.
Reciprocal recombination is suppressed and syntelic rather than amphitelic kinetochore attachment is also posited (grey ovals).
Our model for parthenogenesis predicts the expulsion of a single diploid polar body after a mitotic cell division accompanies
production of the diploid "gamete" which gives rise to the next generation. See text for a more detailed description of the
stages of meiosis and explanation of our model for parthenogenesis.
logenesis can parthenogenetically-produced oocytes be
distinguished visually from meiotically-produced oocytes
[15]. As the oocyte cluster matures, pre-meiotic S-phase
DNA replication occurs in the oocyte, followed by heterochromatin and centromere specification and, in most animals, appearance of the synaptonemal complex (SC) [20].
In most organisms studied, cohesin complexes are
recruited during S-phase to promote cohesion between
sister chromatids [21]. Several mechanisms have been
reported to initiate chiasmata formation and recombination between homologous chromosomes, including double-strand break (DSB) formation and DSB-independent
pathways [22]. As recombination progresses, syntelic
attachment of sister kinetochores (i.e. both attached to the
same spindle pole) generates monopolar tension towards
the spindle poles, leading to segregation of homologous

chromosome pairs at anaphase and cytokinesis resulting
in two diploid cells [23]. In the second meiotic division,
amphitelic attachment of kinetochores (i.e. associated
with microtubules from opposite spindle poles) and the
complete removal of cohesin allow sister chromatids to
segregate to opposite poles [23]. As a result, one haploid
cell is formed; it becomes the ovum while two polar bodies are produced and eventually degenerate.
While parthenogenesis in Daphnia shares some features
with meiosis (e.g. oocyte cluster formation, extrusion of
polar bodies), there are important differences. First, during parthenogenesis sister chromatids segregate in a mitosis-like fashion, suggesting that sister chromatid cohesion
must be different. This could be a result of parthenogenesis-specific cohesin complexes or altered timing of

cohesin removal. Second, parthenogenetic kinetochore
orientation should be amphitelic (bi-oriented, as in mitosis and meiosis II), again to allow pairs of sister chromatids to segregate towards opposite poles. Lastly,
recombination likely differs compared to meiosis because
heterozygosity is maintained during parthenogenetic
reproduction and chiasmata are not observed [15,16].
These changes likely involve a modification of recombination bias away from reciprocal and homologous exchange
to between sisters or to no recombination at all [16].
The major stages of meiosis and the genes which are the
targets of our inventory in D. pulex are indicated in Fig. 1.
The genes were chosen with a focus on female meiosis and
their potential role(s) in parthenogenesis. In this study,
we report an inventory of genes in the genome of a cyclically parthenogenetic strain of D. pulex (strain TCO) that
encode proteins with roles throughout meiosis. This represents an initial step in identifying and characterizing the
genes that are central to reproduction in D. pulex. We have
divided these meiotic genes intro two broad categories.
First, we investigate "meiosis-related genes": these are
genes that encode proteins involved in meiosis but whose
functions and expression are not specific to meiosis. These
include genes encoding Argonaute proteins (PIWI and
AGO subfamilies), cell cycle regulation proteins (cyclins,
cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and polo kinases) and
several proteins involved in DNA replication, cohesion
and meiotic recombination (minichromosome maintenance (MCM), TIMELESS (TIM) and RecQ proteins). Second, we investigate several meiosis-specific genes in our
inventory: these are genes for which homologs in most
model organisms function are expressed only during meiosis and mutants containing null alleles are defective only
in meiosis. These genes include SPO11, MND1, HOP2,
DMC1, REC8, MSH4, and MSH5, which encode proteins
that together generally affect the initiation and progression of meiotic recombination and sister chromatid cohesion. We also examine gene families that are closely
involved in the above processes: these include structural
maintenance of chromosome (SMC) and stromal antigen
(SA) gene families, RAD54 and RAD54B paralogs, and
eukaryotic homologs of bacterial mutL and mutS genes.
Database homology searches and rigorous phylogenetic
analyses are employed to identify orthologs and distinguish paralogs. For 42 gene copies, we use RT-PCR to compare expression levels in ovaries of females undergoing
meiosis or obligate (resting egg) parthenogenesis, in
males (i.e. undergoing meiosis) and in female somatic tissue. We interpret our results from these experiments in
light of a model of the genetic underpinnings of parthenogenesis we have developed for D. pulex.
The gene inventory and the expression patterns of these
genes during meiosis and parthenogenesis will help us

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

address whether parthenogenesis uses existing meiotic
and mitotic machinery, or whether novel processes may
be involved. While thelytokous parthenogenesis may
occur via various cytological mechanisms [9], parthenogenesis in Daphnia appears to be apomictic and does not
involve gametic fusion as would be observed with
automictic reproduction [15]. The transition from meiosis
to parthenogenesis in Daphnia requires at least three modifications: altered spindle attachment of the kinetochore,
modified sister chromatid cohesion and abrogation of
homologous recombination (cf. [24]). It is not clear
whether any one of these changes is necessary or sufficient
for the origin of thelytokous parthenogenesis in D. pulex,
or whether they are pertinent for other types of parthenogenesis such as arrhenotoky. However, these modifications must involve characterized pathways in mitosis and
meiosis, for which mutant phenotypes closely resemble
the cytogenetic manifestations characteristic of parthenogenotes [20,21,23,25]. Therefore, our inventory
includes genes required for these and other meiotic processes.

Results and discussion
Our primary goal is to determine whether features of the
D. pulex genome could account for differences between
parthenogenesis and meiosis. The presence/absence, copy
number and expression pattern of each meiotic gene will
influence our model for parthenogenesis. We have annotated several gene families in D. pulex with known functions in the meiotic pathways above. Here we describe
duplications of genes relating to several relevant processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, centromere
orientation, and crossover suppression during homologous recombination. We also describe the maintenance of
single gene copies for many proteins involved in homologous recombination, specifically in DSB formation,
recombination initiation, strand invasion and Holliday
junction resolution.
Daphnia homologs of Drosophila meiotic genes
Initially, we searched for genes in D. pulex that have
known meiotic roles in Drosophila melanogaster (the closest relative to Daphnia for which there is extensive genetic
and functional data for meiosis) and determined whether
these genes are expressed during cyclical parthenogenesis
and if gross differences in expression levels were evident
when comparing direct-developing (parthenogenetic)
and resting (meiotic) egg production. Gene expression
was empirically determined by agarose gel electrophoresis
of RT-PCR products; amplicons were evidence for gene
expression while negative results indicated a lack of
expression (Additional File 1). Oogenesis during cyclical
parthenogenesis in Daphnia does not appear to be mitotic
(since a polar body is extruded). Therefore, expression of
a meiotic gene during direct-developing egg production

could suggest that parthenogenesis requires components
of the meiotic machinery. Alternatively, absence of expression could provide insight into which processes in meiosis are absent or modified in parthenogenesis.
In D. pulex, we determined the presence or absence of 25
homologs of Drosophila meiotic genes from Flybase [26]
(Table 1) based on BLAST search results because initially
we were interested in whether parthenogenetic reproduction is associated with lack of expression of meiosis-associated genes. RT-PCR from 12 distinct genotypes of
pooled whole females revealed that 22 out of 25 of these
genes are expressed during D. pulex oogenesis (only for
CHK2, MNS1/MUS301 and NEBBISH was expression not
detected) (Table 1). Cyclically parthenogenetic females
producing either direct-developing or resting eggs demonstrated indistinguishable expression patterns (Table 1).
Therefore, gross discrepancies in expression levels of these
genes during parthenogenetic and meiotic reproduction
in cyclical parthenogens are unlikely to be responsible for
the mechanistic differences between these reproductive
modes.
In the course of cataloging these genes in D. pulex, we
found gene copy number expansions for many additional
meiotic genes and gene families. We have divided these
genes into two categories: I) Meiosis-related genes and II)
Meiosis-specific genes (see Table 2). These genes were subject to rigorous phylogenetic analyses and, in many cases,
expression studies which are discussed in the following
sections.
I) Meiosis-related genes
A) Argonaute Proteins (PIWI and AGO subfamilies)
The Argonaute protein family is comprised of the PIWI
and AGO subfamilies. These proteins bind distinct subsets
of small (24–31 nt) repeat-associated RNAs (also called
rasiRNAs or piRNAs) [27] and constitute core elements of
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (reviewed in
[28]). A central function of Piwi subfamily proteins is
transposon control in the germ line mediated via binding
piRNAs, which has been shown to be important for normal meiosis and germ cell development, but other roles in
chromatin formation and (indirectly) kinetochore specification are likely. The production of pachytene piRNAs in
mouse, which are depleted of transposon sequences, also
indicates roles for Piwi subfamily proteins beyond transposon control [28]. In Drosophila, the PIWI subfamily protein aubergine (AUB) has demonstrated roles in piRNA
binding and DNA damage signaling, and this family is
implicated in a range of other processes as well [29]. Independent experiments using microarrays to monitor gene
expression during resting egg production in sexual and
obligate asexual D. pulex (Eads and J. Andrews, unpub.)
also revealed some copies of this family to be differen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

tially expressed, prompting us to conduct a more thorough phylogenetic analysis of these proteins.
For D. pulex, the Argonaute protein family phylogeny distinguishes seven PIWI and two AGO subfamily proteins,
each of which is encoded by individual genes (Fig. 2).
Among the PIWI subfamily proteins, six (AUB-A to AUBF) form a clade within the larger AUB/PIWI clade, indicating multiple gene duplications have occurred in the Daphnia lineage. Duplications are also present in other
arthropod lineages and Caenorhabditis. The seventh protein (442510) is present among arthropod AGO3
homologs. D. pulex also has single AGO1 and AGO2
homologs (protein IDs 305002 and 311791, respectively)
closely related to arthropod orthologs of these genes. The
three D. pulex proteins not included in the initial analysis
(442513, 130069 and 317739) are truncated copies
which are difficult to align and likely represent pseudogenes; a subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed strong
support for 442513 and 130069 within the arthropod
AGO1 clade, and a long branch for 317739 within the
Daphnia AUB/PIWI clade (tree not shown).
B) Cell cycle proteins: Cyclins, CDKs, Polo kinases
The cyclins and their regulatory counterparts, cyclindependent kinases (CDKs), have important roles in the
mitotic cell cycle and in meiotic cell division (for reviews,
see [30,31]). There are four cyclin families (cyclins A, B, D
and E) for which mutants exhibit meiotic defects in mammals [20], and we searched the D. pulex genome for
homologs of these proteins. Cyclins A and B are involved
in M-phase progression and regulation. For example, in
Drosophila, cyclin A stability controls progression of cystoblast divisions and oocyte cell fate [32]. Cyclins D and E
are part of the G1 complex. Cyclin D has important roles
in cell proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle, transcription, histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling
[33]. In mammals, data from null mutants reveal important roles for cyclin D in follicle cell maturation and spermatogenesis [20]. Cyclin E is involved in G1 to S phase
progression by its regulatory association with CDK2 and
also has a CDK-independent role in DNA replication by
regulating activity of the replicative MCM helicase [34].

There are a total of ten homologs encoding cyclins A, B, D,
and E in D. pulex (Table 2). In the phylogenetic analysis of
animal cyclin proteins (Fig. 3A), cyclins A, B, D, and E
each form strongly supported clades and earlier duplications gave rise to the cyclin A/B and D/E lineages. The single D. pulex cyclin A (216737) is related to arthropod
sequences within the cyclin A clade, and its gene model is
supported by both cDNA and tiling path evidence (data
available at wFleabase; see Additional File 2). The cyclin B
family is larger, containing one cyclin B3 homolog
(210441) and five additional gene copies encoding cyclin

See Figures 2 to 7 for phylogenetic positions of all gene copies. Protein IDs, genomic coordinates and expression data for each gene copy is available
in Additional File 2. Partial gene sequences and putative pseudogenes are not included below, but are discussed in the text and also provided in
Additional File 2.

B (Fig. 3A). Among these five copies, proteins 222925 and
299508 form a strongly supported clade, but their long
branch lengths indicate rapid evolution, suggesting a possible long branch attraction artifact. When 299508 is
removed from the analysis, 222925 appears as a long
branch within the vertebrate cyclin B2 clade (tree not
shown). However, when 222925 is omitted, 229508 does
not show strong affinity for any cyclin classes (tree not
shown). This is consistent with the difficulty we had in
aligning 299508, and this protein is the only cyclin B copy
without expression data (Additional File 2), and for which
we were unable to validate expression using primers
derived from the gene model (for primer data see Additional File 3). Thus, while the gene encoding 299508 possibly represents a pseudogene, the divergent cyclin B
homolog 222925 presents an interesting case for further
study.

progression and interacts with A-and B-type cyclins.
Defects in meiosis I spindle assembly have been demonstrated for CDK1 mutants [31]. CDK2 mainly interacts
with A and E-type cyclins (and cyclin B1 and some D-type
cyclins in mammals) to regulate G1 to S progression.
Chromosome pairing is defective and meiosis is incomplete when CDK2 is absent in mammalian cells [35].
CDK4 and CDK6 regulate progression through G1 to S
phase and interact with D-type cyclins [36]. CDK10 regulates the G2-M phase and inhibits transactivation of the
Ets2 transcription factor which regulates CDK1 expression
[37]. We characterized homologs encoding four CDK
family members in D. pulex: CDK1 and CDK2 (the cell
cycle-related kinases), CDK4/6 and CDK10.

For cyclin D, arthropod homologs are distinguished from
clades formed by vertebrate cyclins D1, D2 and D3 (Fig.
3A). D. pulex has two copies encoding cyclin D proteins
(299604 and 46610) which are related to other arthropod
homologs. Most other arthropods in the analysis (except
Tribolium) have only one cyclin D copy (Fig. 3A). While
vertebrates typically have two distinct cyclin E homologs,
E1 and E2, invertebrates usually contain only one. The
single cyclin E copy in D. pulex (299520) is related to
invertebrate homologs, although its position among
arthropods is not strongly supported.

In D. pulex, there are single gene copies of each CDK family member (Table 2). In the phylogeny (Fig. 3B), each
CDK protein forms a strongly supported clade. D. pulex
proteins 299546 and 299469 cluster with arthropod
CDK1 and CDK2 proteins, respectively. The tree topology
suggests a vertebrate-specific CDK4/CDK6 gene duplication, and the relationship of the D. pulex CDK4 homolog
(318234) with either vertebrate or arthropod homologs is
unresolved. Invertebrate CDK10 protein sequences,
including D. pulex CDK10 (230543), have long branch
lengths compared to vertebrates (Fig. 3B). The CDK gene
family is not markedly expanded in D. pulex (in contrast
to cyclin genes with which they interact for their roles in
cell cycle regulation).

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), the regulatory binding
partners of cyclins, have roles in cell-cycle progression
through meiosis and are synthesized and degraded in a
cell cycle-dependent manner (reviewed in [31]). CDK1
(called CDC2 or CDC28 in fungi) regulates G2-M phase

Polo kinases (PLKs) have well-characterized roles in regulating mitotic cell-cycle progression and spindle attachment to kinetochores during meiosis [23]. Polo-like
kinase 1 (PLK1) is present in many eukaryotes and is the
best studied of the group. In yeast, the PLK1 homolog

CDC5 promotes spindle co-orientation, chiasmata resolution and meiosis I exit (reviewed in [31,38]). In addition,
phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 by PLK1 is
critical for cohesin removal during prophase [23]. While
evidence suggests that PLK2, PLK3 and PLK4 are also
involved in cell cycle progression, their functions are less
well-understood.
We found eleven PLK homologs in D. pulex (Additional
File 2); however, six homologs (POLO-F to POLO-K) were
removed from the phylogenetic analysis because they
were either too short and/or were difficult to align (see
below). The phylogeny (Fig. 3C) shows that D. pulex has
at least three gene copies encoding PLK1 and single copies
each for PLK2/3 and PLK4 (Table 2). For PLK1, multiple
independent gene duplications are evident in D. pulex and
C. elegans lineages. D. pulex proteins POLO-A, B and C
form a clade but their relationship relative to other animals is unresolved. POLO-A and POLO-C are separated by
almost 1 Mb on scaffold 9. For PLK2 and PLK3, vertebrate
gene copies evolved via an ancient gene duplication (Fig.
3C); the D. pulex (POLO-D) and Nematostella proteins
(designated PLK2/3) are basal to the vertebrate PLK2/3
clade and PLK2/PLK3 orthologs were lost in the other
insects examined. D. pulex POLO-E is present among other
arthropod sequences in the PLK4 clade.
Six putative PLK homologs initially removed from the
alignment (POLO-F to POLO-K; Additional File 2) were
included in a separate PLK1, PLK2 and PLK3 phylogenetic
analysis (not shown). POLO-F to POLO-K were present
within the PLK1 clade with strong support, however these
proteins apparently do not represent complete and intact
genes (which tend to encode ~550–600 aa proteins in animals). However, these copies evidently contain stop
codons (POLO-G) or re-arrangements (POLO-F and
POLO-H). Therefore, these partial PLK copies appear to be
pseudogenes, or remnants of partial gene duplications,
based on: i) lack of expression evidence, ii) apparent gene
chimerism or rearrangements, iii) truncated length, and/
or
iv)
premature
stop
codons.
C) Replication factors: MCM, Tim, RecQ
Sister chromatid cohesion is normally established early in
DNA replication (reviewed by [39]) and because cohesion
is likely more dynamic and highly regulated than most
models would indicate [40], a wide variety of replication
factors may influence cohesin loading. The establishment
and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion plays a critical role in our model for parthenogenesis in D. pulex (Fig.
1). In this section, we focus on proteins involved in regulating DNA replication and establishing and maintaining
sister chromatid cohesion. Specifically, we search for
homologs within the minichromosome maintenance
(MCM) family of replication factors, the TIMELESS family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

(TIMELESS/TIM-1 and TIMEOUT/TIM-2) and the RECQ
family of DNA helicases.
Within the MCM family of DNA helicases (reviewed in
[41]), six members (MCM2-7, the replicative MCMs) are
structurally related and function together as a hexameric
helicase in DNA replication. Additionally, the MCM2-7
complex has been implicated in DNA damage response,
chromatin structure and transcription [42]. In vertebrates,
MCM8 (which does not associate with MCM2-7) may
function in elongation during DNA replication [43], but
in Drosophila, MCM8 (called REC) facilitates crossovers
during meiosis [44]. A function for MCM9 has not been
determined.
Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that the D. pulex
genome contains single copies for each of the eight MCM
genes (MCM2 to MCM9, Fig. 4A and Table 2); D. pulex
sequences usually cluster with respective arthropod
sequences with strong support. The replicative MCMs
(MCM2-7) share a common ancestor, consistent with the
hypothesis that they arose early in eukaryotic evolution
[44]. The relationships of MCM8 and MCM9 (which have
apparently been lost in fungi) are unresolved. Within the
MCM8 clade, the Drosophila REC branch is much longer
compared to those for other animals. This is consistent
with the novel meiotic recombination role for REC in Drosophila, compared to the ancestral DNA helicase function
in vertebrates [43]. MCM9 has been reported to be vertebrate-specific [45]; however, we found MCM9 orthologs
in arthropods (except Drosophila) including a single copy
in D. pulex. For MCM9, arthropod branch lengths are very
long compared to those for vertebrates. This could suggest
that the invertebrate lineage of MCM9-like proteins has
evolved a new function (similar to REC in Drosophila), or
simply that MCM9 proteins are more widespread in
eukaryotes than originally suggested.
TIMELESS (TIM-1) is a circadian rhythm protein in insects
[46,47], while the function of the TIM-related protein
TIMEOUT (TIM-2) has not been clearly defined [47]. In
mammals, TIM and its binding partner, TIPIN, maintain
replication fork integrity during both challenged (e.g.
across damaged sites) and normal DNA synthesis [47]. In
C. elegans, TIM physically interacts with SMC1 of the
cohesin complex and directly regulates the loading of
cohesin during S-phase [48]. Genetic screens have also
implicated TIM and TIPIN orthologs in meiotic chromosome segregation, although their exact roles are unclear
[49].
Our phylogeny (Fig. 4B) clearly distinguishes insect TIMELESS/TIM-1 and TIMEOUT/TIM-2 lineages and shows
non-insect animal TIM proteins are homologs of insect
TIMEOUT/TIM-2, consistent with previous results [47].

File 2.
The relationships of the fungal and plant clades of TIMlike sequences relative to the animal clades are unclear. It
is possible that genes encoding TIM-1 and TIM-2 repre-

sent an animal-specific duplication in the TIMELESS family. In D. pulex, we found 13 genes (TIM-A to TIM-M,
Additional File 2) with homology to TIM-related proteins;

Page 12 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

among these there are two (TIM-A and TIM-B) TIMEOUT/
TIM-2 and nine (TIM-C to TIM-M) TIMELESS/TIM-1
homologs (Table 2); TIM-F and TIM-G were omitted
because they encode very short sequences and were difficult to align. The nine TIMELESS protein homologs (TIMC to TIM-M) form a strongly-supported clade among the
arthropod copies, indicating that multiple TIMELESS/
TIM-1 gene duplications have occurred in the Daphnia lineage. This is the first evidence that the TIMELESS/TIM-1
gene family is present in arthropods other than insects
(blue shading in Fig. 4B). The D. pulex TIMEOUT/TIM-2
protein homologs (TIM-A and TIM-B) are closely related
to each other and to insect TIMEOUT homologs; however,
TIM-B (310 aa) is much shorter than TIM-A (1097 aa).
The RECQ gene family of DNA helicases has conserved
roles in DNA replication and recombination (reviewed in
[50,51]). Unicellular eukaryotes tend to have one RECQ
homolog (e.g. SGS1 in S. cerevisiae) while multicellular
organisms possess several copies [51]. This gene family
receives particular attention for its association with
human diseases characterized by premature aging, cancer
and genomic instability. These syndromes are caused by
mutations to RECQ2 (Bloom's syndrome), RECQ3
(Werner's syndrome) and RECQ4 (Rothmund-Thomson
syndrome) [52,53]. RECQ2 is the best-studied member of
the RECQ gene family. RECQ2 proteins (BLM in humans,
MUS309 in Drosophila, SGS1 in yeast) suppress crossingover during meiotic prophase I and resolve double Holliday junctions (dHJs) without reciprocal recombination
[51,54,55]. The timing and localization of RECQ2 with
other proteins involved in meiotic recombination resolution (i.e. RAD51, DMC1, RPA, MLH1) are consistent with
its role in crossover and recombination regulation [56]. In
D. pulex, we searched for homologs of these five RECQ
gene family members.
The phylogeny of animal and fungal RECQ protein
homologs (Fig. 4C) shows that D. pulex has single gene
copies of RECQ1, RECQ4 and RECQ5 and several RECQ2
gene homologs (RECQ2-A to RECQ2-G) (Table 2 and
Additional File 2). RECQ3 is absent in D. pulex and may
also be absent in other insects. Within the RECQ1 lineage,
there are two fungal clades, one corresponding to SGS1
(the fungal RECQ2 homolog) and another which a basidiomycete-specific clade of RECQ1 homologs. The unresolved relationships among RecQ paralogs may require
additional sampling of other lineages to determine the
order of divergence.
For RECQ2, D. pulex RECQ2-A is present within the
arthropod RECQ2 clade. The remaining six D. pulex proteins (RECQ2-B to RECQ2-G) form a Daphnia-specific
clade that is sister to other RECQ2 homologs; these proteins are much shorter than RECQ2-A, and many likely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

represent pseudogenes (see below). RECQ2-A contains
DEXDc, Helicase C, RQC and HRDC domains (the last
two domains are mutated in Bloom's syndrome patients).
This, together with expression data (see below) and its
phylogenetic position, indicates that RECQ2-A is likely
the functional RECQ2 homolog. The six shorter RECQ2
proteins (RECQ2-B to RECQ2-G) only contain the
DEXDc and Helicase C terminal domains, suggestive of
roles in RNA metabolism. However, the RECQ2-B gene
model (NCBI_GNO_1400199) predicts an uncharacteristically large 1.9 kb GC/AG intron near the 5'-end and
much of the translation is unalignable and contains multiple stop codons. EST sequences match the region well
but continuous ORFs are absent, suggesting RECQ2-B is a
pseudogene. RECQ2-F (258939) is also unusual: this protein has a very long branch in the phylogeny and BLAST
searches suggest strong bacterial homology, although
there are apparently numerous introns within the gene.
RECQ2-F is likely a pseudogene, perhaps the result of a
prokaryotic horizontal transfer accompanied by intron
gain.
D) Expression patterns among meiosis-related gene copies
Among PIWI subfamily members, expression of all D.
pulex gene copies is well-supported by cDNA and/or tiling
path expression data except for protein 130069, which is
likely encoded by a pseudogene (Additional File 2). Our
RT-PCR expression studies (Additional File 1) demonstrate that D. pulex AUB-B, AUB-C, AUB-D and AGO3 are
expressed in males and in ovaries of cyclical and obligate
parthenogens while AUB-E and AUB-F exhibited expression only in ovaries. AUB-B, AUB-C and AGO3 were
expressed in female soma (Additional File 2), in contrast
to the situation in most other eukaryotes, in which PIWI
subfamily gene expression is restricted to germ cells [57].
Clear roles for this family of proteins in animal meiosis
have not been demonstrated (as they have in plants; see
[58]).

Among the cell cycle proteins, tiling path and/or EST evidence showed all cyclin A, B, D and E gene copies are
expressed except 299508 (cyclin B) which is consistent
with the idea that this copy is a pseudogene (see above).
There is also EST and tiling path expression data for all
four CDK genes in D. pulex (Additional File 2). For PLK
genes, EST and tiling array data show POLO-A and POLOB expression in males and in ovaries during meiosis and
parthenogenesis (Additional File 2). However, only
POLO-A is expressed in somatic tissue and may therefore
represent a "mitotic" copy. For POLO-D and POLO-E,
there is EST and tiling expression data and our RT-PCR
results show that these genes are expressed in males and
in ovaries of obligate and cyclical parthenogens (Additional File 2). Among the more divergent and truncated
PLK sequences removed from the phylogenetic analysis

Page 13 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

(POLO-F To K), there is EST and/or tiling expression evidence for only POLO-F, POLO-G and POLO-H.
Among the replication factor genes, expression of all
MCM copies is supported by EST and tiling path data,
except MCM8 which only has EST data (Additional File
2). Among the D. pulex TIMELESS/TIM-1 homologs, there
are ESTs and/or tiling array data for TIM-C, TIM-I, TIM-J
and TIM-K while only TIM-A has tiling path data for the
TIMEOUT/TIM-2 homologs. Our RT-PCR experiments
showed tissue-specific expression patterns for TIM-C,
TIM-D and TIM-E; TIM-C is expressed in female gonads
and soma and in males, TIM-D only in female gonads and
TIM-E in males and female gonads but not soma (Additional File 2). Such patterns could be consistent with subfunctionalization. The lack of expression for TIM-F and
TIM-G, together with their truncated protein sequences,
suggests that these copies are pseudogenes and perhaps
remnant duplications of nearby full-length TIMELESS/
TIM-1 genes. EST expression evidence for TIM-L (also
encoding a truncated protein) indicates this partial gene
sequence may retain residual function. There is EST and/
or tiling expression data for RECQ1, RECQ4 and RECQ5
in D. pulex. Dramatic differences in gene expression of
RECQ1, RECQ4 and RECQ5 in D. pulex were not
observed; RT-PCR showed these genes were expressed in
parthenogenetic (cyclical and obligate) females, males
and female soma. For RECQ2 copies, EST and/or tiling
array data shows that RECQ2-A, REC2Q-B and REC2Q-C
are expressed (Additional File 2). However, RT-PCR shows
that RECQ2-A is expressed in soma and during obligate
parthenogenesis and meiosis, while RECQ2-B and
RECQ2-Care only expressed in female gonads (Additional
File 2).
II) Meiosis-specific genes
Genes that are meiosis-specific have been experimentally
shown to be indispensable for and generally expressed
only during meiosis in model organisms [59], but otherwise not to affect organismal viability. Determining the
presence and absence of genes that encode proteins functioning only in meiosis will help us to understand the
mechanisms of meiosis in D. pulex. We have divided the
meiosis-specific genes in this study into three broad categories based on their roles in i) sister chromatid cohesion
(REC8), ii) meiotic interhomolog recombination (SPO11,
MND1, HOP2, DMC1) and iii) crossover control/resolution (MSH4, MSH5). In addition, we search for genes
encoding RAD54/RAD54B, stromal antigens and eukaryotic MutL homologs (MLH1, MLH2, MLH3, PMS1),
which, while not meiosis-specific, are initially involved in
meiotic processes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

A) Cohesin gene families: SMCs, RAD21/REC8 and stromal antigens
Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that maintains sister
chromatid cohesion until the onset of anaphase in mitosis
and meiosis. Cohesin complexes consist of SMC1 and
SMC3 (structural maintenance of chromosome proteins),
RAD21 (SCC1 or MCD1 in some fungi) or its meiosis-specific paralog REC8, and the stromal antigen protein (SA or
STAG in animals, SCC3 or PSC3/REC11 in fungi)
(reviewed by [39]). In one well-supported model, RAD21/
REC8 binds the globular ATPase ends of SMC1 and SMC3,
joining them together in a ring-like structure [60]. The
specific roles of SA proteins are less well understood
[61,62].

Cohesin is normally loaded onto chromosomes during Sphase [39], although it can also bind to chromosomes
independently of DNA replication in response to DSBinduced damage after S-phase [63,64]. Removal of
cohesin is generally a two-step process. During vertebrate
mitosis, dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms
depends on phosphorylation by the protein kinases PLK1
[65] and Aurora-B [66]. Centromeric cohesin is removed
by separase cleavage of RAD21 in a securin-dependent
manner which allows anaphase to proceed [31]. During
meiosis, RAD21 is largely replaced by its meiosis-specific
paralog REC8 [25]; the majority of cohesin along chromosome arms is removed by separase during meiosis I, but
centromeric cohesin is protected from cleavage by Shugoshin [67,68]. This protection disappears during meiosis
II when separase cleaves centromeric REC8 and cohesin is
released, allowing sister chromatids to segregate to opposite poles. For D. pulex, we searched for genes encoding
SMC1, SMC3, RAD21, REC8 and SA proteins. Sequences
for cohesin accessory factors PDS5 [69], separase, securin
and Shugoshin are generally poorly conserved in eukaryotes and were not included (although we did identify a
putative separase homolog in D. pulex; see Table 1).
In eukaryotes, the SMC family of proteins contains six
members (SMC1-6) that combine to form heterodimeric
complexes. SMC proteins are characterized by two nucleotide binding Walker motifs (A and B) within globular N
and C-termini which are separated by a pair of acidic
coiled-coil regions joined at the non-helical "hinge"
region. Cohesin proteins contain SMC1 and SMC3, while
SMC5 and SMC6 (along with several non-SMC components) are part of a DNA repair complex with checkpoint
function [70,71]. Condensin complexes contain SMC2
and SMC4, and are involved in chromosome condensation and segregation [72] and in sister kinetochore orientation [23]. In animals and plants, two different
condensin complexes (condensin I and II) possess the
same core subunits but are distinguished by their regulatory subunits [73].

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

The phylogeny of animal and fungal SMC homologs
reveals that each SMC protein forms a strongly-supported
clade (Fig. 5A and Table 2). There is strong support for a
duplication that gave rise to the SMC1/4 lineage, but
weaker support for the SMC2/3 duplication. SMC5 and
SMC6 form a separate group and longer branch lengths
compared to other SMCs, suggesting a rapid rate of evolution, which could be related to their unique roles in DNA
repair and cell cycle checkpoints. Indeed, SMC5 and
SMC6 in Drosophila may be under relaxed selection, since
they experience higher amino acid substitution rates compared to other SMCs [74].
In D. pulex, there are single copies of genes encoding
SMC2, SMC4 and SMC5 proteins. SMC2 and SMC4 are
closely related to arthropod copies, but SMC5 (226104) is
quite divergent and appears as the basal branch among
animal SMC5 homologs (Fig. 5A). There are also duplications of genes for SMC1 (SMC1A and SMC1B), SMC3
(SMC3A and SMCB) and SMC6 (SMC6A and SMC6B) in
D. pulex. The SMC1 duplication in D. pulex is independent
of the vertebrate SMC1 duplication that gave rise to meiosis-specific SMC1 [75]. SMC1A and SMC1B are on different scaffolds (scaffolds 25 and 20, respectively) while
SMC6A and SMC6B are 165 Kb apart on scaffold 20
(Additional File 2), perhaps the result of an ancient tandem duplication. SMC3A and SMC3B are distantly related
to one another; SMC3B has a longer branch and is present
outside of the metazoan/fungal SMC3 clade along with a
duplicated SMC3 from Anopheles. Genes for SMC3A and
SMC3B differ dramatically in exon composition (21 exons
in SMC3A and 14 exons in SMC3B) but both copies contain a central hinge domain flanked by conserved N- and
C-terminal ATPases. These divergent SMC3 copies in D.
pulex and Anopheles may represent paralogs that have
gained unique cellular function(s); further taxon sampling across all eukaryotes can address this question. We
also found nine short protein sequences in D. pulex
(SMC1C to SMC1K; Additional File 4) ranging from 50 to
306 aa which, based on BLAST search results, represent
short domains within SMC1 that have been copied and
dispersed throughout the genome. These short coding
regions are not generally transcribed, although some loci
are imperfect matches for ESTs from the sequenced libraries. Further comparative sequencing and examination of
their expression patterns may reveal potential regulatory
or functional roles for these small genes.
In the RAD21 and REC8 phylogeny, homologs for each
protein form strongly supported clades (Fig. 5B). For D.
pulex, there is one RAD21 homolog and three genes copies
encoding meiosis-specific REC8 (REC8A, REC8B and
REC8C; Fig. 5B and Table 2), which are closely related to
other arthropod sequences. In animals, RAD21 and REC8
are typically present as single copies although there are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

exceptions (e.g. C. elegans has multiple copies of both
RAD21 and REC8). For D. pulex, REC8A is on scaffold 7
while REC8B and REC8C are found in a head-to-head orientation on scaffold 77 separated by about 12 kb and
likely represent a very recent tandem duplication (>98%
identical at the DNA level, including introns). REC8 copies on scaffolds 7 and 77 are also very similar (about 90%
at the DNA and protein level). We cloned and sequenced
REC8 from cDNA and corrected inaccurate gene models
308284 and 308285 on scaffold 77, and model 221983
on scaffold 7. Our cDNA sequence indicates a protein
containing 15 exons comprising 2,016 nucleotides and
671 amino acids. In addition, we found two different
regions, one downstream of REC8A and one in between
REC8B and REC8C, that each contains distinct sequences
found many times within the D. pulex genome. Neither
region has expression evidence or encodes ORFs, but
appear to correspond to repetitive DNAs found at dozens
of locations throughout the genome (Additional File 5).
For the SA gene family, there have been multiple independent duplications during eukaryotic evolution. In vertebrates, at least two duplications gave rise to STAG-1,
STAG-2 and meiosis-specific STAG-3 paralogs [76] and an
independent duplication in Drosophila resulted in SA and
meiosis-specific SNM paralogs [62]. In fungi, only S.
pombe shows evidence of an SCC3 duplication (giving rise
to PSC3 and meiosis-specific REC11 [61]). In the SA protein phylogeny (Fig. 5C), animal, fungal and plant SA
homologs form independent clades and the gene duplications specific to vertebrates (STAG1-3), Drosophila (SA/
SNM) and S. pombe (PSC3/REC11) are evident. In D.
pulex, there are five SA homologs (Fig. 5C and Table 2)
that form a clade closely related to arthropods. Two pairs
of the Daphnia SA genes (SA-C/SA-D and SA-A/SA-E) are
in a tandem duplication on scaffold 3, while the fifth copy
(SA-B) is on scaffold 5. This SA gene expansion in Daphnia
is the largest example characterized in eukaryotes; thus, an
obvious question is whether one of the copies has a meiosis- or parthenogenesis-specific role (like STAG3 in vertebrates, REC11 in fungi or SNM in D. melanogaster).
B) Interhomolog recombination genes
Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes begins with the creation of double strand breaks
(DSBs) to initiate chromosomal synapsis and subsequent
interhomolog crossing-over. SPO11, the eukaryotic
homolog of an archaeal topoisomerase VI subunit [77], is
a trans-esterase that creates these DSBs [22,78]. SPO11
appears to be indispensable for meiosis since homologs
have been found in all eukaryotes examined to date
[59,79]. D. pulex has one SPO11 homolog which is
present between the arthropod and vertebrate SPO11
clades in the phylogeny (Fig. 6A).

Following DSB formation, several meiosis-specific proteins act in concert to promote chromosomal synapsis
and recombination. Genes encoding meiosis-specific proteins in our inventory are DMC1 (meiosis-specific paralog
of RAD51), MND1 (also called GAJ) and HOP2; we also
include RAD54 and its meiotic paralog RAD54B (Table 2).
RAD51 and DMC1 are the two major eukaryotic
homologs of eubacterial recA [80,81]. RAD51 is required
for mitotic recombination, DNA damage repair and meiotic recombination, while DMC1 is meiosis-specific,
required only for meiotic recombination and for normal
synaptonemal complex (SC) formation [82,83]. RAD51
and DMC1 co-localize during meiosis and work together
during meiotic recombination [84,85]. MND1 and HOP2
form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with RAD51

and DMC1 to promote interhomolog meiotic recombination and to reduce synapsis and recombination of nonhomologous chromosomes [86,87]. RAD54B (also called
RDH54 or TID1 in fungi) interacts with RAD54 during
meiosis to stimulate D-loop formation by RAD51 [88,89]
and helps to stabilize the DMC1-ssDNA complex in
humans [90,91]. While these proteins are meiosis-specific, non-meiotic expression has been detected for
MND1, HOP2 and RAD54B, but only in some mammals
[90-93].
There are single copies of genes for MND1 and HOP2 in
D. pulex (Additional File 2). The phylogenies (Fig. 6B, C)
show D. pulex MND1 and HOP2 proteins are closely
related to their respective homologs in arthropods. Single

Page 17 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

copies of genes for RAD54 and RAD54B are present in D.
pulex (Fig. 6D). In the phylogeny, D. pulex RAD54
(306273) is present among animal orthologs but does not
show a strong relationship to arthropods. RAD54B
(207797) appears to have been lost in insects, so the presence of this gene in D. pulex suggests the loss might not be
widespread in arthropods.
With genes encoding MND1, HOP2, RAD54, and
RAD54B present in D. pulex, genes for RAD51 and DMC1
are expected to also be present due to the important interactions among these proteins in meiosis. While a single
RAD51 homolog is present in D. pulex, meiosis-specific
DMC1 appears to be absent (Fig. 6E). To address the possibility that the Daphnia DMC1 homolog was simply overlooked in the D. pulex genome database, we searched D.
pulex ESTs at wFleabase [94] but did not find DMC1 transcripts. Attempts to amplify DMC1 from D. pulex using
degenerate PCR with primers that amplify DMC1 (and
RAD51) in a wide diversity of eukaryotes ([95]; Logsdon
et al. unpublished) were also unsuccessful. Lastly, we
searched for other eukaryotic RAD51-like family members
(RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2 and XRCC3) that
are more distantly related than DMC1 to RAD51 [96]. If
we could identify these more distantly related and divergent protein sequences, then we should be able to find the
gene for DMC1 if it is indeed present. Single copies of
genes for XRCC2, RAD51C and RAD51D were found in D.
pulex (Fig. 6E), although RAD51B (which, among animals, is only found in vertebrates) and XRCC3 appear to
be absent. This strengthens the validity of the DMC1
absence in D. pulex and it is unlikely that a cryptic unsequenced or unassembled copy remains to be found.
The absence of DMC1 is scattered, but not widespread
throughout arthropods; DMC1 homologs are absent in
Drosophila and Anopheles [59], but present in the insects
Bombyx, Tribolium and Rhipicephalus (Fig. 6E). Determining the ubiquity of the DMC1 loss within Branchiopods,
Crustacea and Arthropods will shed light on the evolution
of the machinery for homologous recombination in meiosis and possibly cyclical parthenogenesis. Among taxa
with sequenced genomes, the only other case where
DMC1 is absent while RAD51, MND1 and HOP2 are
present is the microsporidian fungus Encephalitozoon [59].
However, little is known about microsporidian meiosis so
the implications of the DMC1 loss are unclear. Similarly,
meiosis and parthenogenesis in D. pulex are not fully
understood so this result certainly merits further investigation.
C) Mismatch repair genes: MutS and MutL homologs
The eukaryotic homologs of bacterial MutS and MutL proteins form heterodimers that are involved in chromosomal synapsis, recombination and mismatch repair

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

(MMR). In eukaryotes, there are up to seven MutS
homologs (MSH1-7); we did not search for MSH1
(required for mitochondrial DNA stability in yeast) and
MSH7 (specific to plants) in D. pulex (Table 2). MSH2
forms heterodimers with MSH3 and MSH6. MSH2/MSH6
(MutS) tends to be the most abundant MutS heterodimer and is involved in the repair of short base-base
mismatches and indels while MSH2/MSH3 (MutS)
repairs longer mismatches (reviewed by [97]). The MSH4/
MSH5 heteroduplex is meiosis-specific and has a unique
function among eukaryotic mutS homologs in recognizing Holliday junctions and stabilizing heteroduplex formation during meiotic crossing-over and recombination
[98]. MSH4 has also been shown to interact with RAD51
and DMC1 in mammalian meiosis [99].
The phylogeny of animal and fungal MutS homologs
reveals five strongly-supported clades specific for each
MSH gene (Fig. 7A). The topology is consistent with other
phylogenies that group these five MSH genes together
[100]. Our phylogeny supports the idea that separate
duplications yielded the MSH3/6 and MSH2/4/5 lineages
[101], although the exact branching order of the MSH2,
MSH4 and MSH5 clades is not resolved. Single copies of
genes for each MutS homolog are present in D. pulex,
including the meiosis-specific MSH4 and MSH5 (Fig. 7A;
Additional File 2). This shows the MSH4 and MSH5 loss
in Drosophila is not widespread in arthropods since
orthologs are present in D. pulex and in other insects
(Aedes, Anopheles and Apis). The presence of MSH3 in D.
pulex and the basal metazoan Nematostella indicates that
MSH3 may have been lost in insects but retained in other
arthropods and animals. Further taxon sampling in
arthropods and other invertebrates is necessary to understand the extent of this gene loss. Although two additional
partial "copies" of MSH3 on scaffold 1273 can be identified by BLAST, these most likely are mis-assemblies
because they are truncated proteins flanked by repeats and
they are 100% identical to protein 327819.
There are four eukaryotic homologs of bacterial mutL
genes: MLH1, MLH2, MLH3 and PMS1 (here, we use the
fungal designations for MLH2 and PMS1, which are confusingly referred to as PMS1 and PMS2, respectively, in
animals; Table 2). MutL homologs form three heterodimers in which MLH1 is the common subunit [102]. MLH1/
PMS1 (MutL-) is the most abundant heterodimer in
human mitotic cells [103] and functions in MMR [104],
but also has a role in meiotic recombination [105]. The
role of MLH1/MLH2 (MutL-) in MMR is not well understood, while MLH1/MLH3 (MutL-) is involved in meiotic recombination [106,107] and MMR in vitro
[108,109].

are in Additional File 2.

In the animal and fungal MLH phylogeny (Fig. 7B), four
clades are resolved, one for each MLH gene. Three clades
(MLH1, PMS1 and MLH3) are strongly supported but the
overall branching order for MLH1, MLH2, MLH3 and
PMS1 is unresolved. Weaker support for the MLH2 animal/fungal clade is likely due to rapidly evolving fungal
sequences; when they are removed all four MLH clades are
strongly supported (not shown). In D. pulex, there are single copies of each MLH homolog (Fig. 7B). The MLH1
copy (for protein 308451) is present within the MLH1
clade but does not show a strong relationship to other animals; however, neither do the other arthropod MLH1
sequences. MLH2 and MLH3 have been lost from the

insects examined but are present in D. pulex and Nematostella, suggesting independent losses of these genes in
insects. Thus, while insects are unable to form MutL- or
MutL- heterodimers, they can presumably still produce
MutL-, which is the most abundant and may have a
minor role in meiotic recombination.
D) Expression patterns for meiosis-specific genes
Among the cohesin genes in D. pulex, EST and/or tiling
array data provide evidence for expression of SMC1 and
SMC3 copies (and the other non-cohesins SMC genes),
for RAD21 and the three REC8 copies and for all five SA
copies. Our RT-PCR results show the three REC8 copies

Page 19 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

are expressed in ovaries of both parthenogenetic cultures
and in males, but not in female soma (Additional File 2).
For the SA genes, we also found expression evidence for
SA-A, SA-B and SA-C by RT-PCR in female gonads and
soma and in males (Additional File 2) but no expression
for SA-D or SA-E.
Among the interhomolog recombination genes, tiling
array expression data validates the gene model for SPO11
in D. pulex. We also detected SPO11 transcription in males
and in ovaries of both cyclical and obligate asexuals, but
not in female soma (Additional File 2). There is also
expression evidence for MND1 and HOP2 from EST and/
or tiling arrays (Additional File 2). Our RT-PCR experiments also show MND1 and HOP2 expression in cyclical
and obligate parthenogens, but MND1 was also expressed
in males and in female soma. This result, together with
non-meiotic expression of MND1 and HOP2 in some
mammals [92,93], could suggest these genes are constitutively expressed in some species, either because they have
an uncharacterized non-meiotic role or they are nonspecifically expressed at low levels. There is tiling array and/
or EST expression data in D. pulex for all five MSH genes,
for each MLH homolog, and for RAD54 and RAD54B
(Additional File 2). RT-PCR for MSH4 and MSH5 show
that these genes are expressed during cyclical and obligate
parthenogenesis and also in males; only MSH4 expression
was detected in female soma.

Conclusion
A Role for Meiotic Genes in Parthenogenesis?
The main objective of our meiotic gene inventory is to
determine which genes necessary for meiosis are present
in D. pulex. This information, along with gene expression
patterns, can then be used to illuminate mechanistic differences between meiosis and both cyclical and obligate
parthenogenesis in D. pulex. We emphasize that differences between parthenogenesis and meiosis are likely to
relate to changes in: i) kinetochore orientation, ii) recombination bias and iii) sister chromatid cohesion [24,31].
From our gene inventory, the majority of meiotic genes
are present in multiple copies in D. pulex (Table 2 and
Additional File 2), which is also consistent with the high
tandem gene content characteristic of the D. pulex
genome. We speculate that these extra gene copies may be
partly responsible for changes to these meiotic processes,
as suggested by our model for parthenogenesis (Fig. 1).
We suggest that some of these duplicated genes have the
potential to serve parthenogenesis-specific functions,
although it is possible that some duplicate gene copies
have maintained their ancestral meiotic function. Below,
we discuss implications that our meiotic gene inventory
and expression data may have on understanding the
mechanisms of parthenogenesis in D. pulex. We also
incorporate these findings into a model highlighting the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

stages in meiosis where these genes could play important
roles in the transition from meiosis to parthenogenesis.
According to our model (Fig. 1), stem cell division and
maintenance are similar in meiosis and parthenogenesis.
However, we invoke important changes in heterochromatin formation (especially at centromeres) and kinetochore
attachment during parthenogenesis. PIWI subfamily proteins affect heterochromatin assembly and in D. pulex
there are six PIWI subfamily gene copies (AUB-A to AUBF), including two copies (AUB-E and AUB-F) expressed in
ovaries but not in males or soma. Comparisons of expression patterns for these gene copies during meiosis and
parthenogenesis may indicate potentially important roles
for this protein family in both meiosis and parthenogenetic reproduction.
Polo kinases (PLKs) have diverse roles in meiosis and also
in regulating the cell cycle, kinetochore formation and
cohesin attachment and removal. D. pulex has at least
three copies of PLK1 and several partial PLK1-like
sequences. PLK1 is involved in orienting kinetochores
during mitosis and meiosis. In D. pulex some PLK1 copies
may be involved in altering microtubule attachment during parthenogenesis to allow amphitelic (like in mitosis
and meiosis II) rather than syntelic (as in meiosis I)
attachment of kinetochores (Fig. 1). Genes encoding
some proteins that PLK1 interacts with are also present in
multiple copies in D. pulex: PLK1 together with cyclin B
(up to six gene copies in D. pulex) affects cell cycle regulation [31]. Since parthenogenesis in D. pulex is distinct
from mitosis and meiosis, parthenogenetic cell cycle regulation may require interactions between specific cell cycle
proteins (such as multiple gene copies for PLK1 and cyclin
B) for successful cytokinesis.
According to our model, parthenogenetic sister chromatid
cohesion must differ from cohesion during regular meiosis. The stepwise removal of cohesin in mitosis requires
PLK1 to phosphorylate the SA subunit (which has five
gene copies in D. pulex); changes in the timing of cohesin
removal during parthenogenesis could be achieved by the
activity of a "parthenogenetic" PLK1 copy that phosphorylates SA (perhaps also present as a parthenogenesis-specific copy) in a mitotic rather than meiotic fashion.
Parthenogenetic-specific copies of TIMELESS/TIM-1 and
TIMEOUT/TIM-2 may also be involved in the initial loading of cohesin during meiosis and parthenogenesis, as
demonstrated in C. elegans for TIM-1 [48]. Distinct parthenogenetic cohesin complexes might also be present in D.
pulex. If so, we would expect to find multiple copies of
genes encoding cohesin complex proteins and those that
are involved in its loading, targeting, and removal from
chromosomes. In D. pulex, there are two gene copies each
for SMC1 and SMC3 proteins which could represent the

Page 20 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

gain of a parthenogenesis-specific function in one copy
(similar to the SMC1 and meiosis-specific SMC1 duplication in vertebrates [75]). There are also three copies of
meiosis-specific REC8 and only one copy of its paralog
RAD21. Some REC8 copies may be involved in differential
regulation of cohesin removal (e.g. by separase cleavage)
in parthenogenesis compared to meiosis. However, such
divergent roles for REC8 are unknown; for example, three
REC8 copies are also present in C. elegans, but their functional differences have not been extensively characterized
[110].
The richness of cohesin complex genes in D. pulex is
unique among eukaryotes. We speculate that the extra
gene copies encode proteins that are involved in altering
sister chromatid cohesion during parthenogenesis. Combinations of the various SMC1, SMC3, REC8 and SA copies could plausibly comprise different cohesin complexes
with specific roles in meiosis and parthenogenesis. For
example, our model for parthenogenesis posits meiosislike cohesion during prophase (which allows homolog
synapsis and SC formation) followed by a shift in favor of
the function of the "parthenogenetic" cohesin (Fig. 1). At
this point, centromeric cohesin would be released and sister chromatids, instead of homologs, would segregate,
recapitulating the maternal genotype in the daughter cells
in a mitosis-like division. This intriguing prospect will
require detailed genetic screening to determine the functions of these genes. Alternatively, a parthenogenetic-specific cohesin might not replace RAD21 with REC8; during
meiosis in rec8 yeast, RAD21 cohesin can establish
amphitelic kinetochore attachment and loss of centromeric cohesin during anaphase I [111]. In essence, this
resembles a mitotic division during meiosis I as suggested
in our model for parthenogenesis. However, all three copies of REC8 are expressed during parthenogenesis (Table
1), so while some, or all, copies are likely involved in this
process, RAD21 may also play an important role.
Our model also suggests that during parthenogenesis
there is a change in recombination bias from between
homologs to either between sister chromatids, or to no
homologous recombination at all. This idea is supported
by a study of mutation-accumulation lines in D. pulex
showing that the loss of heterozygosity by ameiotic
recombination was orders of magnitude greater than
nucleotide mutation rates [16]; this clearly indicates that
some degree of non-reciprocal recombination normally
occurs during parthenogenetic reproduction. In our survey, the majority of genes involved in DSB formation,
recombination initiation, promoting strand invasion and
resolving Holliday junctions (SPO11, MND1, HOP2,
RAD54, RAD54B and RAD51, along with MSH and MLH
homologs) are present as single copies. This pattern
implies that a parthenogenesis-specific function for these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

proteins is unlikely, or alternatively that the proteins do
not function during parthenogenesis at all. The lack of
variation in copy number of genes involved in HR and
MMR may also reflect the importance of these pathways
for the survival of D. pulex. Conversely, there are seven
gene copies homologous to RECQ2 (BLM) which encodes
a protein that limits crossing over and promotes Holliday
junction resolution without reciprocal exchange. This
contrast is striking: genes encoding proteins that promote
meiotic recombination are present as single copies while
a protein that suppresses crossing-over has seven gene
copies. This may help to explain how meiotic recombination could be suppressed or altered during parthenogenesis. For example, if the single-copy genes maintain their
function in meiosis (and mitosis, where applicable) while
others such as RECQ2 copies have evolved novel roles
unique to parthenogenesis, the result could be decreased
levels or the absence of reciprocal recombination during
parthenogenesis as predicted in our model.
The absence of meiosis-specific DMC1 could also have
implications regarding innovations for recombination in
meiosis and parthenogenesis in D. pulex. Increased frequency of interhomolog over intersister recombination is
a defining characteristic of meiosis, a bias which is
strongly enforced by DMC1 [80]. Thus, D. pulex has the
machinery for synapsis but is missing the recombinase
(and associated homolog bias) typically associated with
this system. However, other meiotically competent animals missing DMC1, in addition to MND1 and HOP2
(e.g. D. melanogaster and C. elegans), have presumably
evolved unique innovations (not yet understood) to compensate for the absence of these genes. Another possibility
for D. pulex is the promotion of homolog bias during meiosis by the SC. Although well-conserved structurally, the
rapid evolution of SC proteins (such as HOP1, which we
were unable to find in D. pulex) make them difficult to
identify. Further study of synapsis and recombination
control in Daphnia provides an interesting comparative
system to better understand these processes in animals.
Our RT-PCR with D. pulex cultures detected expression for
44 meiotic gene copies during oogenesis in cyclical parthenogenetic cultures and also during both sexual and
obligate asexual reproduction and in female soma (Table
1, Additional File 2). Initially, we found that presence and
absence of 25 meiotic genes during meiosis (resting egg
production) and parthenogenesis (direct-developing egg
production) in a cyclically parthenogenetic culture were
indistinguishable. That is, gene expression specific to
either meiosis or direct developing egg production (i.e.
ovaries from cyclically parthenogenetic cultures) was not
observed for these genes (Table 1). In addition, our RTPCR experiments in cyclical and obligate parthenogenetic
cultures for the >40 genes that we subjected to more

Page 21 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:78

detailed phylogenetic analyses (Additional File 2) did not
detect expression specific to sexual tissues (meiotic ovaries) or obligate asexual tissues (ovaries from obligate parthenogenetic cultures). Several genes were found to have
expression restricted to the germline or soma.
However, transcript levels may not be an accurate measure
of protein function during parthenogenesis, and although
meiosis genes are expressed during parthenogenesis, it is
possible that their function is altered or absent. Expression patterns were also not determined for all gene copies
in this study, so perhaps some of these may exhibit parthenogenesis-specific expression patterns when examined
more closely. In addition, mature and immature oocyte
clusters can exist within the same ovary, yet be undergoing
two different reproductive modes (e.g. meiosis and parthenogenesis; [15]). Thus, a technique with increased spatial resolution, such as in situ hybridization, may be
required to detect qualitatively important differences in
expression. Yet, many gene copies were expressed in ovaries undergoing either obligate parthenogenesis or meiosis, indicating that these genes could function during both
processes. There were also several genes expressed in
female soma. Interestingly, expression of MND1 and
MSH4 in female soma could indicate that these genes are
not meiosis-specific and may have uncharacterized nonmeiotic (i.e. non-reproductive) role(s). This could also
represent low level constitutive expression, as non-meiotic gene expression has been detected for MND1 (and
HOP2) in mammals [92,93]. Among genes not expressed,
POLO-J, POLO-K, RECQ2-B, TIM-F and TIM-G are likely
pseudogenes based on both lack of expression and other
characteristics in gene architecture (e.g. stop codons). EST
and/or tiling array expression evidence for RECQ2-B,
RECQ2-C, POLO-F, SA-D and SA-E contradicts the
absence of expression from our RT-PCR results, although
the causes of these discrepancies are unclear.
Comparative data from other Daphnia species and parthenogenetic taxa will help to clarify the deeper history of
reproductive gene duplications in this genus. Apis mellifera
(honeybee) is the only other animal in our phylogenetic
analyses that regularly undergoes parthenogenesis and
that also has an assembled genome. The genome of the
pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum is currently being
sequenced, and it will be most interesting to compare the
meiotic gene inventory of this cyclical parthenogen to that
of D. pulex. Reproduction in Apis (as in many hymenopterans) is arrhenotokous, meaning haploid males are parthenogenetically produced while fertilized eggs turn into
diploid females. This differs from cyclical parthenogenesis
(or heterogony) in Daphnia which alternates between parthenogenesis (where both females and males are produced by parthenogenesis) and sexual reproduction. We
did not find any striking expansions in gene copy number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/78

or conspicuous gene absences in our survey of meiotic
genes in Apis. Thus, while both taxa have parthenogenetic
phases of their life cycles, the meiotic gene catalog in D.
pulex is markedly enriched for gene duplications compared to Apis. Whether this is mechanistically or causally
related to differences between cyclical parthenogenesis
and arrhenotoky is unclear.
Our meiotic gene inventory has identified expansions in
particular meiotic genes and gene families that we speculate are related to the mechanism of parthenogenesis in D.
pulex. From our analysis, we cannot make substantial conclusions on parthenogenetic-specific functions for these
gene copies without extensive expression and functional
assays in D. pulex. However, considering the multi-functional roles of many of the proteins in our inventory (e.g.
PLK-1), the acquisition of an additional yet-to-be characterized parthenogenetic-specific function would not be
unreasonable to consider. It is clear that tandem duplications are widespread in the D. pulex genome and to a
much greater extent than other sequenced invertebrates.
However, at this point we cannot distinguish whether tandem duplications are the consequence or cause of parthenogenesis. For example, if cyclical parthenogenesis has a
higher rate of unequal crossing over or slip-strand mispairing than does meiosis, the consequence could be a
higher frequency of tandem duplications during parthenogenesis; thus, a large proportion of duplicate genes
would be expected to have arisen since the origin of parthenogenesis in this species. Alternatively, duplicated
meiotic genes might be the cause of parthenogenesis by
driving the genetic sub-functionalization of different biochemical activities associated with parthenogenetic production of either direct-developing (cyclical) or diapause
(obligate) oocytes.
One approach to resolving the issue of cause or effect
would be to date the duplications by comparing the relative ages of tandem gene pairs in Daphnia associated with
meiosis to the ages of tandem duplicate genes not associated with meiosis. If gene families associated with meiosis
have a significantly older distribution than gene families
that are not, this would indicate that meiotic gene duplications preceded the origin of parthenogenesis, while a
younger age would suggest that duplications of meiotic
genes have been a consequence of parthenogenesis. One
way to accomplish this is to complete a phylogenetic survey of duplicated meiotic genes throughout the
Cladocera, all of which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis, and in the clam shrimp Cyclestheria which may
represent the closest extant representative of the lineage
from which cladocerans arose [112]. If multiple meiotic
gene copies are also present throughout Cladocera and in
Cyclestheria then this would suggest meiotic gene duplications might have coincided with the origin of cyclical par-

thenogenesis and indicate the minimum complement of
duplicated meiotic genes that are required for cyclical parthenogenesis. A sporadic distribution of duplicated genes
could suggest ancestral duplications and multiple losses
or independent origins of duplicated gene. Such studies
require an in-depth analysis of the age distribution of gene
duplications, tandem and otherwise, which is outside the
scope of this report.

Methods
Phylogenetic Analysis
To find homologs for each gene of interest in Daphnia,
protein sequences from Drosophila and other metazoans
were used as queries in BLASTP and TBLASTN searches
against the D. pulex genome at JGI [113] and wFleabase
[94] and putative protein homologs were retrieved. For
each gene, amino acid alignments that included putative
homologs from D. pulex and from a diverse sampling of
metazoans (and, in some cases, fungi and plants) were
constructed using Clustal X [114] and edited manually
using MACCLADE 4.08 [115]. Phylogenetic analyses were
done using MrBayes 3.1.2 [116] with the WAG + I + 8G
substitution model [117]. Four Markov chains were used
(one heated and three cold) and the analysis was run for
one million generations with trees sampled every 1000
generations. From a plot of likelihood scores versus generation, the burnin value was determined for each analysis
and only trees from that point on with the best posterior
probabilities were retained for constructing the consensus
tree which was edited with TREETOOL.
Gene Expression analysis
Daphnia cultures were collected between 2001–2004 and
genotyped using allozymes and mtDNA (see [19] for
details). For gene expression studies, D. pulex were reared
in filtered pond water at 18°C on a 12:12 cycle of
light:dark and fed Scenedesmus algae (0.5 mg/ml) every
two days. Prior to sacrifice, animals were inspected by
microscopy to verify sex and reproductive status of
females. Females were scored as obligate asexuals according to whether they could produce viable resting eggs in
the absence of males. Whole males were used, and fully
vitellogenic ovaries were dissected from 10 cyclical and 10
obligate parthenogenetic females making resting eggs by
fixing and dissecting in 80% ethanol. Somatic tissues
from the same animals were segregated from the gonads,
and total RNA was isolated by removing the ethanol, incubating in 100 l of lysis buffer (PicoPure kit; Arcturus,
Inc.) at 42°C for 30 min, and adding 100 l of 70% ethanol. This mixture was then column purified according to
the manufacturer's protocol, including a DNase digestion
step.

(Agilent), showing intact ribosomal RNA bands that indicate minimal RNA degradation in each case. Total RNA
(less than 1 g each) was added to 100 ng oligo-dT and
0.4 mM dNTPs, incubated at 65°C for 5 min and quick
chilled. The reactions were added to 1× (final concentration) first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mM DTT, 1 l of
RNasin (Ambion) and 5 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen), and incubated at 48°C for 60 min and 70°C for 15
min. Reactions were brought to 50 l total with 10 mM
Tris, pH 8.0. Negative controls were performed by adding
water instead of reverse transcriptase, and failed to
amplify control primers in all cases, indicating undetectable genomic DNA contamination.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was conducted using Taq polymerase (BioLine) or Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) with cycling parameters
specific for each primer pair tested (see Supplementary
Table 1 for primer sequences and theoretical melting temperatures). Products were visualized on 1.4% TBE agarose
gels stained with 10 g/ml ethidium bromide. For cloning
of PCR products, Vent-amplified reactions were incubated
with exo-Taq and 1 mM dATP prior to incubation with
Topo pCR-II TA-vector (Invitrogen). Cloning was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions using
chemically competent DH5a cells. Plasmid DNA was
recovered from transformed colonies using PureLink miniprep kits (Invitrogen). Sequencing of PCR products (200
ng) or purified plasmid (50 ng) was done with BigDye v.3
(Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3730 sequencer at the
Indiana Molecular Biology Institute (Indiana University).
