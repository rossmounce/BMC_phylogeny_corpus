Abstract
Background: The molecular mechanisms leading to a fully differentiated thyrocite are still object of intense study even
if it is well known that thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, NIS and TSHr are the marker genes of thyroid differentiation. It is
also well known that Pax8, TTF-1, Foxe1 and Hhex are the thyroid-enriched transcription factors responsible for the
expression of the above genes, thus are responsible for the differentiated thyroid phenotype. In particular, the role of
Pax8 in the fully developed thyroid gland was studied in depth and it was established that it plays a key role in thyroid
development and differentiation. However, to date the bases for the thyroid-enriched expression of this transcription
factor have not been unraveled yet. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a functional thyroidspecific enhancer element located far upstream of the Pax8 gene.
Results: We hypothesized that regulatory cis-acting elements are conserved among mammalian genes. Comparison
of a genomic region extending for about 100 kb at the 5'-flanking region of the mouse and human Pax8 gene revealed
several conserved regions that were tested for enhancer activity in thyroid and non-thyroid cells. Using this approach
we identified one putative thyroid-specific regulatory element located 84.6 kb upstream of the Pax8 transcription start
site. The in silico data were verified by promoter-reporter assays in thyroid and non-thyroid cells. Interestingly, the
identified far upstream element manifested a very high transcriptional activity in the thyroid cell line PC Cl3, but
showed no activity in HeLa cells. In addition, the data here reported indicate that the thyroid-enriched transcription
factor TTF-1 is able to bind in vitro and in vivo the Pax8 far upstream element, and is capable to activate transcription
from it.
Conclusions: Results of this study reveal the presence of a thyroid-specific regulatory element in the 5' upstream
region of the Pax8 gene. The identification of this regulatory element represents the first step in the investigation of
upstream regulatory mechanisms that control Pax8 transcription during thyroid differentiation and are relevant to
further studies on Pax8 as a candidate gene for thyroid dysgenesis.
Background
The thyroid gland is a very important organ for the development of vertebrates as it synthesizes hormones that are
essential for growth, development and survival such as
tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T4) and triodothyro* Correspondence: s.zannini@ieos.cnr.it, dilauro@szn.it

nine (T3). Thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (TPO),
sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), and TSH receptor
(TSHr) are genes necessary for the synthesis of such hormones which takes place in the fully differentiated thyroid cell, called the thyrocite [1,2]. Indeed, some of these
genes mark a differentiated thyroid cell; in particular, thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase are genes exclusively
expressed in thyroid cells. The promoters of these two
genes have been extensively studied and three transcription factors, namely TTF-1 (also named Titf1/Nkx2-1),
Foxe1 and Pax8, have been demonstrated to be involved

in the activation of these genes [3,4]. During development
and in the adult life, these factors are also present in other
tissues, but the three of them are co-expressed only in the
thyroid. It has been shown that their expression is
required for the early stages of thyroid morphogenesis
and is crucial for normal thyroid function. Indeed, for all
its life a thyroid cell will be hallmarked by the simultaneous presence of TTF-1, Foxe1 and Pax8. Interestingly,
these thyroid-enriched transcription factors are likely
linked in a regulatory network such that each of them can
be involved in the initiation or maintenance of the others
[5].
During the past years, the role of Pax8 in the fully
developed thyroid gland was studied in depth and it was
established that Pax8 plays a key role in thyroid development and differentiation [6]. The first evidence of a role
for Pax8 in the fully developed thyroid gland was provided by Mansouri et al. [7] by the generation of a Pax8
knockout mouse. Interestingly, Pax8+/- mice had no phenotype, while homozygous Pax8-/- mice showed growth
retardation and died within 2-3 weeks. The cause of the
death of the mutated animals was hypothyroidism, and
the administration of thyroxine to Pax8-/- mice allowed
the animals to survive. In fact, these mice did not display
any apparent defects in Pax8 territories of expression
except for the thyroid gland that appeared smaller and no
follicles were detectable, demonstrating that Pax8 is necessary for the survival of follicular thyroid cells. Furthermore, it was shown that in the thyroid anlage of Pax8-/mice the expression of Foxe1 is strongly down-regulated
[5]. These observations demonstrated that Pax8 not only
is required for the survival of thyroid precursor cells, but
also holds a specific upper role in the genetic regulatory
cascade, which controls thyroid development and its
functional differentiation.
Indeed, the reintroduction in vitro of an exogenous
Pax8 in the PCPy transformed thyroid cell line, in which
Pax8 is absent as well as all the differentiation markers,
was sufficient to re-activate transcription of the endogenous genes encoding thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase and
sodium/iodide symporter [8]. Furthermore, it has been
reported that Pax8, together and synergistically with
another thyroid-enriched transcription factor TTF-1, is
able to activate transcription from the thyroglobulin gene
promoter [9].
Although the function as well as the downstream targets of Pax8 are well studied, very little is known about its
transcriptional regulation. Actually, an exhaustive knowledge of such a regulation is essential for a comprehensive
view of thyroid gland development and differentiation
pathways. Understanding those pathways is important
not only to develop new treatments for thyroid gland diseases but also to add new dowels in the understanding of
gene deregulation-dependent syndromes.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to shed light on the
transcriptional regulation of Pax8 gene expression. The
identification of distant acting gene regulatory sequences
that direct precise spatial and temporal patterns of
expression has been limited, despite their established
roles in development, phenotypic diversity and human
disease. Comparative genomic-based approaches have
proved to be useful in identifying gene regulatory
sequences, primarily on a gene-by-gene basis. These
studies involved sequence comparisons of human (or
other vertebrate) genomic intervals to orthologous
regions from organisms separated by varying evolutionary distances, ranging from primates to fish [10].
We decided to use the bioinformatics approach to
search for putative enhancer elements located in the 5'flanking region of Pax8. We utilized a common interspecies sequence comparison and we analyzed 275 kb of
orthologous regions of the human and mouse Pax8 gene.
The rationale for using cross-species sequence comparisons to identify biologically active regions of a genome is
based on the observation that sequences with important
functions are frequently conserved among phylogenetically distant species, distinguishing them from non-functional surrounding sequences. We searched for noncoding genomic sequences (CNS), conserved between
human and mouse, located in the 5'-flanking region of the
Pax8 chromosomic locus, and we identified one sequence
with a high thyroid-specific transcriptional activity. We
demonstrated that this sequence is the first discovered
enhancer of the Pax8 gene.

Results
Genomic comparison and identification of conserved noncoding sequences

Using the program VISTA, we compared 275 kb of
orthologous regions of the human and mouse Pax8 gene
searching for conserved non-coding sequences (CNS).
The first known gene at the 3'-end and the first known
gene at 5'-end of the Pax8 gene were taken as border limits of the genomic fragment selected. We considered
sequences as conserved if they aligned without a gap for
≥100 bp and have ≥70% nucleotide identity. In Figure 1,
the percentages of identical nucleotides are visualized as
a peak along the sequence of the base organism (mouse; x
axis). All peaks that cover pieces of sequences sharing
more than 50% of similarity are drawn, and those corresponding to the settings described above are highlighted
in pink. As confirmation, we used in parallel to the global
comparison program VISTA, the local comparison program PIPMaker. The results of these two programs were
completely overlapping, retrieving the same conserved
sequences (data not shown).
91 CNS fitting the above-cited criteria were identified.
We discarded 11 of them because of their overlap with

coding sequences inside the Pax8 gene (exons and UTR)
and the remaining 80 were defined as non-coding conserved elements. We decided to focus our attention on 32
segments in the 5'-flanking region of the Pax8 gene
extending for 116 kb upstream the start of transcription
and located more than 30 kb away from any known gene.
To investigate the potential biological activity of these
conserved regions, promoter-reporter assays were performed. To this end, each CNS was amplified by PCR on
mouse genomic DNA and chimeric constructs were generated inserting each fragment in the pGL3-basic
reporter vector containing the E1b minimal promoter
upstream of the firefly luciferase. We then analyzed the
ability of the 32 selected CNS to act as enhancer in the
immortalized thyroid cell line PC Cl3. Cells were transiently transfected with the CNS-constructs together
with an internal control plasmid (Renilla luciferase) to
normalize for transfection efficiency. Figure 2A summarizes the transcriptional activity of each construct as fold
induction over the transcription obtained with the E1bpGL3-basic vector. First we noticed that, out of 32 CNS
tested, only 7 showed transcriptional activity. Among
these, the CNS14 and CNS87 showed the highest activity,

with 45 and 250 fold increase respectively, over the basal
level of the empty vector containing only the E1b basal
promoter. Based on its position, coincident with the start
of transcription, we hypothesized that the CNS14 could
be a putative promoter and its analysis was conducted
separately. For the continuation of the study we decided
to characterize in better depth only the most active, 343
bp long CNS87, located 84.6 kb upstream of the Pax8
5'UTR (Figure 1).
Interestingly, the CNS87 manifested a very high transcriptional activity in the thyroid cell line PC Cl3, but it
showed no activity in HeLa cells (Figure 2B). Similar
results were obtained if the CNS87 was inserted in a
reporter vector containing the minimal promoter of the
thymidine-kinase gene (TK-pGL3basic). We conclude
that the CNS87 is an enhancer with thyroid-specific transcriptional activity.
The thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-1 binds to the
CNS87

We performed Dnase-I footprinting analysis using
nuclear extracts prepared from PC Cl3 with 32P-5'endlabeled CNS87 and we observed six protected regions

the minimal promoter E1b into the E1b-pGL3basic vector and transiently transfected in the rat thyroid cell line PC Cl3 (note: the CNS are not numbered
in consecutive order). At 48 h post-transfection, transcriptional activity was determined as the firefly over renilla luciferase activity. Data are expressed
as fold induction over the transcription obtained with E1b-pGL3basic, whose value was set at 1.0. Data are means from 3-4 independent experiments,
each performed in duplicate; B) CNS87 was subcloned into the TK-pGL3basic vector (CNS87-TK) and its activity was compared with that of the CNS87E1b vector in two different cell types. At 48 h post-transfection, transcriptional activity was determined as the firefly over renilla luciferase activity. Data
are expressed as fold induction over the transcription obtained with the E1b-pGL3basic or the TK-pGL3basic vectors. Data are means from 3-4 independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

(here denominated FT) (Figure 3A). To further characterize proteins binding on each FT, we performed electromobility shift assays (EMSA) using 25 nt long
oligonucleotides designed on each of the six FTs that
were incubated with either thyroid (PC Cl3) or non-thyroid (HeLa) protein extracts (Figure 3B). While oligonucleotides derived from FT-2 and FT-4 showed similar
retarded bands with both extracts, we noticed that the
retarded bands corresponding to FT-1, FT-3, FT-5 and
FT-6 oligo probes displayed completely different patterns
when challenged with the two extracts. These results
prompted us to investigate the possibility that on the
CNS87 were present consensus sequences for thyroidspecific transcription factors. We then used the TRANSFAC analysis software (TRANSFAC pro®9.3 from the
BIOBASE Company) to search for transcription factors
binding sites and intriguingly, we found that FT-1 and
FT-6 were predicted to have binding sites for the thyroidenriched transcription factor TTF-1. Consequently, the
remaining of our study was focused on these two footprints.
To further characterize and verify the predictions
obtained with the TRANSFAC analysis on FT-1 and FT6, we proceeded with more exhaustive EMSA assays. Initially, we incubated the same FT-1 and FT-6 32P-labelled
oligo probes both with PC Cl3 total protein extract or
with bacterially produced and purified TTF-1 protein
(bTTF1) (Figure 3C). As control of the binding, we used
the 32P-labelled oligo C described before [11], which is
proved to bind the TTF-1 protein. As expected, bTTF1
binds to the oligo C and produces a retarded band similar
to that observed with the total protein extract. Interestingly, the incubation of bTTF-1 with the FT-1 and the FT-

6 oligos produced a retarded band identical to the one
observed in the binding of bTTF-1 with the oligo C, suggesting that TTF-1 is indeed the protein binding to the
FT-1 and FT-6 probes. In addition, the retarded band
observed when the PC Cl3 protein extract was incubated
with the FT-1 and FT-6 oligo probes is the result of a specific interaction, as demonstrated by competition assays
(Figure 4A). Cross-competition further strengthened the
data that indeed the FT-1, FT-6 and oligo C sequences
bind the same protein (Figure 4A). To further consolidate
our data, we performed supershift assays with an antiTTF1 specific antibody. Also in this case, as shown in Figure 4B, we observed that to the supershifted band produced after the incubation of the oligo C with PC Cl3
protein extract and the anti-TTF1 antibody, exactly corresponds an identical supershifted band in the lanes corresponding to the FT-1 and FT-6 oligo probes. The
specificity of these three supershifted bands is confirmed
by the reduction of the expected retarded bands corresponding to TTF-1-oligo complex and by the absence of a
supershift when the HeLa protein extract or the antitubulin antibody is used.
To demonstrate the ability of TTF-1 to interact with the
CNS87 also in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments on PC Cl3 cells. The
crosslinked chromatin was immunoprecipitated using the
antibody against TTF-1. As control, to rule out unspecific
background of the ChIP assay, we performed one reaction using an unrelated antibody. The enrichment of the
endogenous CNS87 region was monitored by PCR amplification using specific primers. Indeed, we demonstrate
that, in agreement with the in vitro data, TTF-1 antibody
is able to immunoprecipitate the chromatin containing

in vitro binding data presented in this paper, and clearly
demonstrate that the thyroid-enriched transcription factor TTF-1 is able to bind in vivo the Pax8 far upstream
element CNS87.
FT1 and FT6 are key regions for the transcriptional activity
of the CNS87

To better understand the functional role of the FT-1 and
FT-6 regions in the transcriptional activity of the CNS87,
we decided to mutagenize them by generating site-specific point mutations in both TTF-1 binding sites, separately or in combination. We chose the mutations with
the help of the bioinformatics predictions of the TTF-1
binding consensus sequence such that on the CNS87 element TTF-1 binding was totally abrogated in the FT-1

and FT-6 regions and no other TTF-1 binding site was
generated within the entire element. In this way, we prepared three new CNS87-TK vectors that were named
CNS87-FT1m, CNS87-FT6m and CNS87-FT1-6m (Figure 5A). We used each of these three vectors in transient
transfection experiments in PC Cl3 cells as described
before, and we compared the results obtained transfecting these mutated vectors with the wild-type CNS87-TK.
In Figure 5B, we show that the transcriptional activity of
the CNS87-WT transfected in PC Cl3 cells is significantly
higher then the transcriptional activities corresponding
to each of the three mutants, indicating that both FT-1
and FT-6 are involved in the transcriptional activity of the
CNS87. In particular, mutation in FT-6 gives the highest
level of reduction in the transcriptional activity while the
combination of mutations in both FT1/6 does not poten-

CNS87 mutants were transiently transfected in PC Cl3 thyroid cells. At

tiate this reduction. These results led us to recognize as
most critical the role of FT-6 among the other footprints
present on the CNS87.
TTF-1 activates transcription from the CNS87 and is
involved in Pax8 expression in thyroid cells

Since TTF-1 was the only confirmed binding factor on
the CNS87, and to better understand its role in the transcriptional activity of this element, we decided to perform
transactivation experiments in a heterologous recipient.

Hence, we transfected HeLa cells with the wild-type
CNS87 vector alone or in co-transfection with an expression vector encoding TTF-1. The results showed in Figure 5C demonstrated that the co-transfection of the
transcription factor TTF-1 is capable to strongly activate
transcription from the CNS87, and in particular the fold
activity of luciferase expression obtained in co-transfection experiments clearly resembles the levels obtained
transfecting the CNS87 in the physiological PC Cl3 cell
recipient.
To better elucidate and confirm the role of TTF-1 in the
regulation of Pax8 expression, we used the experimental
model described by Dentice et al. [12] in which TTF-1
gene expression is stably knocked down. This cell model
consists of a thyroid-specific cell line FRTL-5 stable
transfected with an shRNA vector driven against TTF-1
mRNA. Among the selected clones, Cl-3 and Cl-5
showed a significantly reduced TTF-1 expression. We
performed Q-PCR analysis on total RNA prepared from
these two clones and from control untransfected FRTL-5
cells. We confirmed that in both clones TTF-1 expression
was reduced and we showed that to the reduction of
TTF-1 expression clearly corresponds a significant
reduction of Pax8 expression (Figure 6), indicating that
the level of expression of the two transcription factors is
indeed correlated. To further demonstrate that the cell
model used reflects the physiology of the thyroid cell, we
analyzed by Q-PCR the expression in Cl-3 and Cl-5 also
of one important thyroid differentiation marker, i.e. the
thyroglobulin (Tg) gene that is a well known target of
both TTF-1 and Pax8 [8,13]. As expected, Tg gene
expression was significantly reduced in both Cl-3 and Cl5 (Figure 6). The fact that Tg decreases more than the two
transcription factors could be the consequence of the
synergic action of TTF-1 and Pax8 on the Tg promoter,
demonstrated both in vitro [9] and in vivo [14].
All together these data confirm that TTF-1 is responsible for the full expression of the Pax8 gene and fit perfectly with our previous data in which we demonstrated
the transcriptional activity of TTF-1 on the Pax8 far
upstream enhancer CNS87.
CNS87 is a distant regulatory element that controls Pax8
expression

To verify whether Pax8 expression could be regulated by
a distant cis-acting sequence like the CNS87 element that
we had identified, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors. The Pax8 genomic locus is located
on chromosome 2 with a length of about 60 kb. As previously described, the CNS87 element is located about 90
kb upstream the Pax8 5'UTR so both the Pax8 gene and
the CNS87 sequence largely fit into a BAC vector. We
obtained several BACs from the BAC PAC Resources of
the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute

Figure 6 TTF-1 plays a role in the regulation of Pax8 expression in differentiated thyroid cells. Q-PCR analysis was performed on total RNA prepared from FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells and two clones, Cl-3 and Cl-5, stable transfected with an shRNA driven against TTF-1. The expression of TTF-1, Pax8
and Tg genes was measured. For each gene, values are means ± SD of seven independent experiments in duplicate, normalized by the expression of
β-actin, and expressed as percentage of the value measured in parental FRTL-5 cells. Statistical analysis uses t test.

BAC vectors, with the exception of the CNS87 deletion,
led us to the conclusion that the CNS87 is a distant regulatory element that controls the expression level of the
Pax8 gene.

with respect to the whole region upstream the Pax8 gene,
that is the region containing the CNS87 and the putative
promoter. To unravel the role of the CNS87 in its physiological genomic context, we further modified the
wtCNS87BAC-LUC vector, again by means of recombineering, to eliminate the entire CNS87 region that was
replaced
by
an
ampicillin-resistance
cassette
(delCNS87BAC-LUC). We then used these two BAC vectors in stable transfections assays in PC Cl3 cells. Cells
were transfected with wtCNS87BAC-LUC or with
delCNS87BAC-LUC and after a 2-weeks G418 selection
two different pools of stable clones were generated for
each of the transfected vector. Protein extracts were prepared and the luciferase activity was measured. The
results, reported in Figure 7, showed a strong transcriptional activity of the wtCNS87BAC-LUC as it was
expected since, as mentioned above, Pax8 putative promoter and every other transcriptional element are preserved in this BAC vector. On the other hand, the level of
luciferase
expression
corresponding
to
the
delCNS87BAC-LUC vector is significantly reduced compared to the wtCNS87BAC-LUC luciferase expression.

Figure 7 A BAC-based Pax8 transcriptional reporter construct reveals the role of the CNS87 element in the control of Pax8 expression levels. PC Cl3 cells were stable transfected with two reporter
constructs derived from a BAC containing the entire Pax8 gene as well
as the 5'-flanking region engineered as described in Materials and
Methods. Pools of colonies for each construct were analyzed. Protein
extracts were prepared and the luciferase activity was measured. Data
are expressed as fold change with respect to the transcriptional activity
obtained with wtCNS87BAC-LUC, whose value was set at 1.0. Data are
means ± SD from 3-4 independent experiments, each performed in
duplicate. Statistical analysis uses t test (p < 0.05).

Discussion
Comparative analysis of non-coding sequences between
evolutionary correlated species is one of the new tools of
the genomic era widely used when researchers want to
look for regulatory mechanisms that are conserved
throughout evolution. Such an approach in fact leads to
the identification of highly conserved sequences that may
be functionally relevant and to the discovery of new transcription factors binding sites and mechanisms that were
to be known yet. Inter-genomic comparisons indeed, are
rapidly evolving for investigations of regulatory regions
involved in promoter activity [15-19].
Pax8, a thyroid-enriched transcription factor, plays a
key role in thyroid development and differentiation [8].
Despite its essential function, the transcriptional regulation of the Pax8 gene remains poorly characterized. In
this paper, we describe the identification of the first transcriptional regulatory element of the PAX8/Pax8 gene.
We achieved our results by coupling modern computational studies with experimental EMSA analysis and promoter/reporter assays.
We performed comparative studies on human and
mouse genomic sequences flanking the Pax8 gene looking for conserved sequences to explore the possibility that
such conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) may be
instrumental in guiding the thyroid-specific expression of
Pax8. By globally aligning a large fragment of the human
and mouse Pax8 genomic locus, we found about 80 CNS
that fitted our search criteria. However, we decided to
focus our attention only on 32 of those sequences located
in the 5'-flanking region of the Pax8 gene extending for
about 110 kb upstream the start of transcription. Using
promoter/reporter assays, we identified one conserved
and functional sequence with a typical enhancer behavior
specifically acting in thyroid cells and we named this
sequence CNS87 (conserved non-coding sequence 87). In
particular, this conserved sequence is a far upstream element, conserved between human and mouse, that turned
out to be a target of the action of another thyroidenriched transcription factor, i.e. TTF-1/NKX2.1.
Using several mutant mouse lines, Parlato et al. have
established that in thyroid cell precursors the transcription factor TTF-1 and Pax8 are linked in a complex network of reciprocal regulatory interaction [5]. Our data
strongly support this scenario indicating that TTF-1,
through the CNS87 element, is involved in the regulation
of Pax8 gene expression in the environment of the thyroid
cell. In fact, the CNS87 has all the features typical of an
enhancer since it can stimulates the transcription of a
reporter gene in a very strong and tissue-specific manner.
A peculiar feature of the CNS87 element is its location
about 90 kb upstream from the 5'UTR of the mouse/
human Pax8 gene. It is noteworthy that a sequence
located so far from a gene could be related with its

Page 9 of 13

expression. However, many examples exist in the literature on regulatory elements located very far from both
the 5'end and the 3'end or even inside other genes. The
most representative example came from Sonic Hedgehog
gene (Shh), where its regulatory element is located 1 Mb
upstream of Shh, embedded in a gene that resides in a
cluster of unrelated genes [20-23]. In addition, many
model of action have been developed for long distance
acting regulatory elements. Such models imply the existence of factors that have the ability to bring and stimulate genes in active compartment of the chromatin.
Therefore regulatory elements get closer to the proximal
regulatory region of a gene allowing the start of the transcription [24].
The notion that the CNS87 could indeed serve as a regulatory element of Pax8 gene expression was further reinforced by the experimental observation with the BAC
transfection assays. Those data clearly confirm that the
CNS87 fragment is required for the full expression of the
Pax8 gene.
The bioinformatics predictions of the transcription factors binding sites in this CNS element further highlight
the physical experimental data. The TRANSFAC program predicted two binding sites for the thyroid-enriched
transcription factor TTF-1 within footprints 1 and 6.
Indeed, when the sequences corresponding to the FT-1
and FT-6 are mutated the CNS87 activity is severely
reduced respect to that of the wild-type fragment confirming that TTF-1 is leading the activity of this element.

Conclusion
Taken together, our data suggest that the transcription
factor TTF-1 participates to Pax8 gene expression
directly binding to its 5'-flanking region and activating
transcription from the CNS87 regulatory element that we
have identified and characterized. In conclusion, this
paper puts a milestone in the understanding of the regulation of the expression of the transcription factor Pax8
and will contribute to the establishment of a fine intergenic network between thyroid enriched transcription
factors and their roles during development and adult life.
Methods
Sequence Analysis

Mouse and human DNA sequences were obtained from
the University California Santa Cruz Genome Browser
(mouse genome, release Feb 2007; human genome,
release June 2007). From this database, a region was
selected spanning 275 kb of the entire Pax8 genomic
locus in Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. The first
known gene at the 3' and the first known gene at 5' of the
Pax8 gene were taken as border limits of the genomic
fragment selected. The genomic fragment was first chosen from the mouse genome. Then, the corresponding

Nitsch et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:306
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/306

genomic fragment from the human genome containing
the same size of DNA at the 5' and 3' flanking sides of the
PAX8 gene (77.653 bp at the 3' and 140.982 at the 5') was
taken. Comparative genomic analysis was carried out
using the PipMaker http://bio.cse.psu.edu/pipmaker 51
and VISTA http://www.gsd.lbl.gov/vista/ 50 programs.
The conserved sequences identified in this way were analyzed and compared with the TRANSFAC 4.0 database
using Mat Inspector vertebrate matrix database to search
for potential transcription factor binding sites. Sum of
both minimized false positive and false negative errors
were considered to ensure proper interpretation of the
survey results.
PCR Amplification and subcloning of the Conserved
Sequences

32 CNS positioned at the 5' of the Pax8 transcription
start site or immediately downstream of it were selected
for experimental test. These fragments were amplified by
PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity
(Invitrogen) and the PCR products were separated on a
2% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide.
The conserved DNA sequences amplified by PCR were
cloned in the pGL3basic vector (Promega) containing an
E1b TATA box upstream the Luciferase reporter gene
(pGL3-LUC), or into pGL3-TK vector containing the thymidine-kinase promoter [25].
The constructs CNS87-FT1m, CNS87-FT6m and
CNS87-FT1-6m containing the mutated sequences of the
CNS87 were generated by recombinant PCR.
Preparation of Cell Nuclear Extract and DNaseI Footprinting
Assay

Total cell extracts were prepared from PC Cl3 cells grown
in one hundred plates (diameter, 150 mm) as previously
described [26]. The footprinting probes were generated
by digestion of the p87-E1b-LUC plasmid. The plasmid
was linearized with the restriction enzyme XhoI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase
(Roche Diagnostics) and extracted from agarose gel using
the Qiaquick gel extraction Kit (Qiagen). 1.24 μg of linearized and purified plasmid DNA were end-labelled
with γ-ATP-32P using T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase
(BioLabs). The reverse strand probe was prepared in a
similar way using as restriction enzyme Mlu1. The endlabelled probes were released from the plasmid with a
second digestion and purified on a 5% acrylamide gel. 7
kcpm of the eluted probes were digested for 1 min at 20°C
with 1:5000 and 1:2000 serial dilutions of a 3 mg/ml DNaseI (Roche Diagnostics) stock solution. The eluted probes
were incubated with 30 μg of PC Cl3 nuclear extract and
digested for 1 min at 20°C with 1:100, 1:50 and 1:25 serial
dilutions of a 3 mg/ml DNaseI (Roche) stock solution.

Cells and Transient Transfection Assay

PC Cl3 and FRTL-5 cells were grown in Coon's modified
F-12 medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 5% v/v calf
serum and a six-hormone mixture (6H), as described
[27].
HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal
calf serum (Hyclone). For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue
culture dish 5 to 8 h prior to transfection, whereas PC
Cl3 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm
tissue culture dish 18 h prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out with the FuGENE6 reagent
(Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's
directions. The DNA/FuGENE ratio was 1:2 in all the
experiments. The plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was used
as internal control in the transfection assays. Cells
extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection to determine the levels of the firefly and renilla luciferase with
the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Transfection experiments were done in duplicate and
repeated at least three times.
Protein extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assay

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM
Hepes pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA pH 7.8, 5%
v/v glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
TTF-1 purified protein (bTTF1) was produced as previously described [28]. For EMSA assays, double-stranded
oligonucleotides were labeled with γ-32P ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and used
as probes. The binding reactions were carried out in a
buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol,
0.1 mM EDTA, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15
μg/ml of poly (dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature.
DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.
The antibodies, αTTF-1 [29] and αtubulin (sc5286,
Santa Cruz), used in the supershift experiments were
incubated with the protein extract for 20 min before adding the probe.
Oligonucleotides were derived from the protected
sequences in the footprinting assays on the CNS87 and
were as follows: FT-1: CGCACAAGAGCCCTTCTCAAGGGAT; FT-2: CTGGCTAAAGCCCAACGACACAGGT;
FT-3: AACACTTGGGTGATCTACGTGAAGC; FT-4:
GGGGGCAGGTTGGACAAAAGCCCCA; FT-5: CCTCAACAGCTTCTGACCTTCCTCT; FT-6: GAGAACGTTTATAAGTGTCTGGCTG.

RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real time-PCR

Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's directions. Total RNA (1
μg) was retrotranscribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR analysis was performed
using an iCycler-iQ real-time detection system and SYBR
green chemistry (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Reactions were
carried out in duplicate in four independent experiments.
The specific primers sets used for this analysis were for
amplification of β-actin (Fwd: GGCAATGAGCGGTTCCGATG; Rev: ATGGTGGTGCCACCAGACAG), of
Pax8 (Fwd: CAGCTATGCCTCTTCCGCTATT; Rev:
TGTGGCTGTAGGCATTGCC), for TTF-1 (Fwd:
AGGACACCATGCGGAACAGC; Rev: GGCCGCCCATGCCGCTCATA) and thyroglobulin (Fwd: TGTGGAATCTAATGCCAAGAACTG; Rev: TCCCTGAGAG
CTTTTGGAATG).
For each gene, values are means ± SD of four independent experiments, normalized by the expression of βactin, and expressed as a percentage of the value measured in parental FRTL-5 cells.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

The cross-linking solution, containing 1% formaldehyde,
was added directly to cell culture media. The fixation
proceeded for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of
glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. PC Cl3 cells
were rinsed twice with cold PBS plus 1 mM PMSF, and
then scraped. Cells were collected by centrifugation at
800 × g for 5 min at 4 C. Cells were swelled in cold cell
lysis buffer containing 5 mM piperazine-N, N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 8.0), 85 mM KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mM PMSF, and inhibitors cocktail (Sigma) and
incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were spun down by
microcentrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 C, resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 1 mM PMSF and inhibitors cocktail (Sigma), and
then incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were broken by
sonication into chromatin fragments of an average length
of 500/1000 bp and then microcentrifuged at 16,000 × g.
The sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 8-fold in ChIP
Dilution Buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100,
1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 167 mM
NaCl, and precleared by adding Salmon Sperm DNA/
Protein A Agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake
Placid, NY) for 30 min at 4 C. Precleared chromatin from
1 × 106 cells was incubated with 1 μg of affinity-purified
rabbit polyclonal antibody, αTTF-1 [29] and an unrelated
one, rotated at 4 C for 16 h. Immunoprecipitates were
washed five times with RIPA buffer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nadeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF;
twice with LiCl buffer containing 0.25 M LiCl, 1% Non-

Page 11 of 13

idet P-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and then three times with TE (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8; 1 mM EDTA). Before the first wash, the
supernatant from the reaction lacking primary antibody
was saved as total input of chromatin and was processed
with the eluted immunoprecipitates beginning at the
cross-link reversal step. Immunoprecipitates were eluted
by adding 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and reverse crosslinked by addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 200
mM and by heating at 65 C for 16 h. Recovered material
was treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated.
The pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of TE and analyzed
by PCR using specific primers for the CNS87. The input
sample was resuspended in 30 μl of TE and diluted 1:10
before PCR.
BAC

Mouse BAC clone bMQ-241M1 was obtained for the
bMQ mouse BAC library made at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute constructed from the 129SvEv/AB2.2
mouse strain. Engineered versions were produced via
recombinogenic targeting in Escherichia coli by the
method of Lee et al. [30], also know as recombineering.
Briefly, a luciferase expression cassette with a neo resistance cassette was inserted in the exon 2 of Pax8 into the
ATG start codon. To obtain this construct luciferase
cDNA form PGL3 was cloned upstream PGK-EM7-Neo
cassette from pl452.
The recombination cassette was constructed by subcloning a 50-bp 5' recombination arm overlapping part of
pax8 intron 1 and part of exon 2 upstream ATG start
codon and a 50-bp 3'arm recombination arm containing
part of exon 2 and intron 2 downstream ATG start codon
such that the recombination arms flanked the Luc-PGKEM7-Neo cassette. The forward strand sequences of the
50-bp homology arms were as follows, for the 5'arm:
TGCGTAGGAAAGCTGCGAGTGTCCCTCAGTCTGTGAGCGACTCCCCGGCG; for the 3' arm: ATGCCTC
ACAACTCGATAGATCCGGTAAGGACCGCGGAGGGGCCAGGAC.
The final cassette with recombination arms was
digested from the vector, gel purified and then recombined with pax8 BACs as described previously. Successful
recombinants BAC Luc-Neo were selected by plating the
electroporated cells on LB plates containing 20 μg/ml
Kanamycin, 20 μg/ml chloroamphenicol. Correct modified BACs were verified by PCR analysis. For BAC 87(lacking 87 region) the BAC luc-Neo was modified by
insertion of Amp-resistance cassette into the 87
sequence. Amp-resistance cassette was amplified from
pBS vector using primer 5' flanked by recombination arm
overlapping the sequence upstream 87 region and using

Nitsch et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:306

3' primer flanked by recombination arm overlapping
sequence downstream 87 region.
The forward strand sequences of the 50-bp Homology arms were as follows, for the 5'arm: AAAGA
GAGGCAAAGAAAGCTAGGGGTCTGCAGTCTCCAAACCTGCAGGGCTGGCTAAAG; for the 3'arm:
TTTCTGAATCTAAATCCAAAACTTTACCCTCTTCTGATTGGTAATGAGTC.
The PCR product was purified and recombined with
BAC Luc-Neo. Recombinants were selected by plating
the electroporated cells on LB plates containing 20 μg/ml
Kanamycin, 20 μg/ml chloroamphenicol and 50 μg/ml
ampicillin and the correct modified BACs were verified
by PCR analysis.
BAC transfection

BAC DNA for transfection was prepared with Qiagen
Large-Construct kit.
Stable transfection were carried out with PEI22 (MBI
Fermentas, St.Leon-Rot, Germany) as described previously [31]. PC Cl3 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes (2 ×
105) the day before transfection. For each construct 1 μg
of BAC DNA and 2 μg of BAC DNA were transfected
with an amount of PEI giving an N/P ratio of 7.5. The
medium was replaced on day 3 with fresh medium containing 150 μg/ml G418. Stably transfected cell pools
were grown to confluence. Cells were then washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline and incubate for 30 min
at room temperature with passive lysis buffer (Promega)
with vigorous shaking. Firefly luciferase activity was
determined using "Luciferase assay System" (Promega).
Luciferase activity was then normalized with protein concentration of cleared lysates.
