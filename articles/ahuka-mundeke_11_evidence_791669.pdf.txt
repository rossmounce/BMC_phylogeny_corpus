From 15th International Conference on Human Retroviruses: HTLV and Related Viruses
Leuven and Gembloux, Belgium. 5-8 June 2011
Background
Among the four types of HTLV (1 to 4), only three have
their simian counterparts (STLV-1, 2 and 3). STLV-1
and 3 have been found in a large number of captive and
wild-living monkeys and great apes from Africa and
Asia. STLV-2 was reported only in a limited number of
captive bonobos (P. paniscus) from Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) and despite its genetic distance with
HTLV-2, STLV-2 is considered as a simian counterpart
of HTLV-2. To date, no evidence of STLV-2 or any
other known STLVs have been documented yet in wildliving bonobos. Given that bonobos are an endangered
species, investigation of pathogens in this species in the
wild is only possible by non-invasive sampling. Here we
report a survey aimed at characterising simian retroviruses from wild-living bonobos in DRC.
Methods
Between March and July 2010, fecal samples from wildliving bonobos (P.paniscus) were collected at Malebo
forest in the Bandundu province located in the western
part of DRC. Samples were collected in RNA-later. Species confirmation was done by mtDNA analyses. All faecal samples were screened for STLV infection using a
generic PCR allowing amplification of partial fragment
in tax (220bp). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis was
done to confirm the STLV infection and identify STLV
types. Attempts to amplfy other gene fragments were
done to futher characterize the new STLV viruses.

Results
A total of 268 fecal samples were collected in 2010 and
mitochondrial DNA analyses confirmed that all the
samples were from bonobos (P. paniscus). Overall, 3
(1.1%) out of 268 samples yielded positive amplification of tax fragment. Among them , one (Pp5538) was
identified as STLV-2 and two (Pp5489 and Pp5560) as
STLV-3 by phylogenetic analysis of tax fragment. Phylogenetic analyses of tax and LTR fragments showed
that the new STLV-2 from Pp5538 clustered with
STLV-2 strains previously described in captive
bonobos.
All PCR attempts to amplify the LTR fragment of
Pp5489 and 5560 samples were unsuccessfull.
Conclusion
Our study shows that faecal samples can be used to
screen for STLV infection in endangered apes, although
most likely with lower sensitivities. We confirmed
STLV-2 infection in wild-living bonobos and showed for
the first time that bonobos are also infected with STLV3 Additional work is warranted to fully characterize the
new STLV-2 and 3 strainsa nd to document the STLV
diversity on a larger number of wild bonobos from differnt geographic régions.
