Abstract
Background: While all codons that specify amino acids are universally recognized by tRNA molecules, codons signaling
termination of translation are recognized by proteins known as class-I release factors (RF). In most eukaryotes and archaea a
single RF accomplishes termination at all three stop codons. In most bacteria, there are two RFs with overlapping specificity,
RF1 recognizes UA(A/G) and RF2 recognizes U(A/G)A.
The hypothesis: First, we hypothesize that orthologues of the E. coli K12 pseudogene prfH encode a third class-I RF that we
designate RFH. Second, it is likely that RFH responds to signals other than conventional stop codons. Supporting evidence comes
from the following facts: (i) A number of bacterial genomes contain prfH orthologues with no discernable interruptions in their
ORFs. (ii) RFH shares strong sequence similarity with other class-I bacterial RFs. (iii) RFH contains a highly conserved GGQ
motif associated with peptidyl hydrolysis activity (iv) residues located in the areas supposedly interacting with mRNA and the
ribosomal decoding center are highly conserved in RFH, but different from other RFs. RFH lacks the functional, but non-essential
domain 1. Yet, RFH-encoding genes are invariably accompanied by a highly conserved gene of unknown function, which is absent
in genomes that lack a gene for RFH. The accompanying gene is always located upstream of the RFH gene and with the same
orientation. The proximity of the 3' end of the former with the 5' end of the RFH gene makes it likely that their expression is
co-regulated via translational coupling. In summary, RFH has the characteristics expected for a class-I RF, but likely with different
specificity than RF1 and RF2.
Testing the hypothesis: The most puzzling question is which signals RFH recognizes to trigger its release function. Genetic
swapping of RFH mRNA recognition components with its RF1 or RF2 counterparts may reveal the nature of RFH signals.
Implications of the hypothesis: The hypothesis implies a greater versatility of release-factor like activity in the ribosomal Asite than previously appreciated. A closer study of RFH may provide insight into the evolution of the genetic code and of the
translational machinery responsible for termination of translation.

Background
The synthesis of all mRNA-encoded proteins is performed
by the ribosome. To decode mRNA, ribosomes use mediator molecules to link codon identity and meaning. For
codons specifying amino acids, tRNA molecules serve as
the mediators. Specific matching of codons and tRNAs is
accomplished on ribosomes which select cognate tRNAs
based on features of the geometry of the corresponding
codon:anticodon duplexes [1]. In contrast, for codons
that are signals for termination of translation, protein
molecules serve the role as the mediators. These proteins
recognize the three stop codons in mRNA and are termed
class-I release factors (RFs) [2]. In most eukaryotes and
archaea (except for special cases described below) there is
a single RF responsible for termination at all three stop
codons [3]. In most bacteria, there are two RFs with overlapping selectivity to stop codons [4,5]; RF1 recognizes
UA(A/G) stop codons, and RF2 recognizes U(A/G)A stop
codons.
RF1 and RF2 share significant sequence and structural
similarity [6-8]. The proteins are organized in four protein
domains that play different functional roles [9]. Domain
3 contains a GGQ motif that is believed to be responsible
for hydrolysis of the peptidyl bond during termination.
The GGQ motif is the sole universally conserved motif in
class-I RFs from all kingdoms of life [3,10]. Domains 2
and 4 together form a superdomain that is responsible for
stop codon recognition in mRNA. This superdomain
shares significant structural and sequence similarity
between RF1 and RF2. Two Gly residues in the tip of the
alpha 5 helix (boxed in Fig 1A) are thought to be in contact with the uridine in the first position of the stop codon
exposed in the ribosomal A-site [9]. These two Gly residues are universally conserved in all bacterial RF1 and RF2
sequences [11]. There are specific conserved differences
between RF1 and RF2 associated with different stop
codon selectivity of these factors. Genetic studies demonstrated that these differences involve the PXT motif in RF1
and the SP(F/Y) motif situated in the corresponding position in RF2 [12,13]. Since these motifs can be compared
to tRNA anticodons, they are sometimes referred to as the
"RF anticodons". We will use this term further for simplicity. Biochemical data [14,15] followed by structural studies revealed that such "RF anticodons" are in close
proximity (if not in direct contact) to positions 2 and 3 of
stop codons [9,16-18]. Domain 1 is thought to bind to the
class-II release factor RF3 (GTPase that promotes activity

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

and recycling of class-I RFs [19]). This is the least conserved domain in RFs and it is differently oriented in RFs
upon binding to the ribosome [9,16-18]. This domain is
not essential for the function of RFs in stop codon recognition and peptidyl hydrolysis [13].
In 1992, Pel et al [20] identified an E. coli K12 genomic
element encoding a protein sequence that shares significant similarity with RF1 and RF2 and named it prfH (protein release factor homologue). Here we analyzed the
numerous bacterial genome sequences that have since
become available and revealed that many bacteria encode
prfH orthologs, which contain no discernable ORF interruptions. It has also become evident that the original E.
coli K12 prfH gene was N-terminally truncated. To our
knowledge, expression of the prfH gene in any bacteria has
never been shown. Detailed analysis of protein sequences
encoded by these genes and modeling a corresponding
three-dimensional structure led us to the hypothesis that
these genes encode a class-I RF that terminates protein
synthesis at unknown signals. In this article, we describe
supportive evidence for this hypothesis, its implication for
a basic understanding of translation termination in bacteria and suggest experiments that will help to elucidate the
particular function of the prfH-encoded protein that we
further call RFH.

The hypothesis
We have analyzed 311 completed bacterial genomes available at NCBI [21] on 20th of May 2006 for the presence of
Class-I RFs using ARFA program [22] Our analysis
revealed that 23 of them contain either intact or disrupted
ORFs encoding RFH. Figure 1 shows an alignment of RF1,
RF2 and RFH sequences from representative bacteria that
encode all three factors (Fig. 1A) and a structural model of
RFH (Fig.1B) highlighting the differential conservation
pattern between RFH, RF1 and RF2 (see figure legend for
details). We provide an alignment of all release factors
from analyzed bacteria in the nexus format [see Additional file 1]. Nucleotide sequences were extracted using
custom designed perl scripts and ARFA program [22]. Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW [23], then
protein alignment was backtranslated to obtain codon
alignment.
First, it is clear that all three factors share significant similarity in the area of the peptidyl hydrolysis domain including the GGQ motif (Fig. 1A). Due to the presence of this
motif in RFH it is placed in the same cluster of orthologous groups (COG1186J) with RF1, RF2 and yaeJ (function is unknown) [24]. RFH shares similarity with other
RFs throughout its entire sequence (in some genomes it is
mistakenly annotated as RF2 [22]). yaeJ similarity is limited to GGQ motif and it is highly distinct from RFs in
other areas of its sequence. More strikingly, RFH

sequences from different bacteria have their most conserved residues in the areas corresponding to those known
to have functional importance in class-I RFs. Most interestingly, the putative RFH "anticodon" is SXY which is
somewhat similar to the RF2 anticodon SP(F/Y). In addition, the alignment contains a conserved gap of three
amino acids corresponding to the RFH anticodon loop
(shown in yellow on Fig. 1). In the area of contact of RFs
with the first position of the stop codon (boxed in the
alignment), RFH has a conserved GP sequence instead of
the strictly conserved GG in RF1 and RF2. Finally, in RFH
there is one additional amino acid in the loop around
position 172 (E. coli RF2 numbering, purple in Fig. 1B).
All together, these combined differences suggest different
codon specificity for RFH. In addition, a substitution of
negative Glu residues with positive residues in the area of
the mRNA recognition domain changes specificity of RFs
[25,26]. At least one such change is obvious at the position adjacent to the RF2 "anticodon" from the C-terminus. In RFH there is a universal positive Arg residue
instead of the usually negative residue in RF1 and RF2.
The most dramatic difference between RFH and the other
two factors is the lack of the N-terminal coiled coil
domain 1 (Fig. 1B and 1C). This domain is the least conserved of the RF domains and it is in a different orientation in RF1 and in RF2 bound to ribosomes [9,18].
Studies of the in vivo and in vitro effect of swapping or
deleting the N-terminal domain show that this domain
has no effect on codon specificity, but is necessary to stimulate nucleotide exchange on the Class-II RF, RF3 [13]. It
is noteworthy that the N-terminal domain is not necessary
for in vitro peptide release, and that truncated RF1 functions in vivo, and has a similar conformation in solution
[6]. It has been suggested by small-angle X-ray scattering
analysis that domain 1 is flexible in solution [6]. This further adds to the impression that domain 1 is not an integrated part of the essential RF activity, but could have
been added in the course of evolution for optimizing the
process of peptide release, when RF3-mediated recycling,
via the contact with domain 1, speed up the overall termination process. Moreover, the RF3 encoding gene, prfC is
not essential in E. coli [27,28] and its orthologs have not
been identified in bacteria with small genomes. Thus,
despite the lack of domain 1, RFH could be a fully active
class-I RF, capable of promoting peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis
and polypeptide chain release.
RFH resembles the shape of a tRNA molecule more closely
than RF1 or RF2 (Fig. 1C), mostly due to the lack of
domain 1. The close resemblance to the shape of a tRNA
molecule further supports our hypothesis, that RFH has its
natural active site in the ribosomal A-site, as other RFs.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

In summary, RFH is very similar to other RFs in the area
of the peptidyl hydrolysis domain that accomplishes the
basic function in all class-I RFs. Additionally it shares significant similarity in the areas responsible for mRNA recognition, but contains a number of conserved changes
specific to RFH, suggesting that its recognition properties
differ from those of RF1 and RF2. The overall pattern of
conservation within RFH is nearly the same as in RF1 and
RF2 strongly suggesting that RFH functions as a class-I RF.
Analysis of the sequence surrounding the RFH gene in different bacteria shows that in each observed case there is a
specific gene 5' of the RFH gene (Fig. 2). These upstream
genes share significant sequence similarity. Genes that
share the same level of sequence similarity are absent in
those bacteria that lack RFH. The putative proteins
encoded by these upstream genes belong to a larger superfamily of RtcB-like proteins. Members of this superfamily
are present in all kingdoms of life, but their functions are
unknown [29], although it has been suggested that they
are associated with tRNA or rRNA processing [30]. The
crystal structure of archaeal RtcB was recently solved [31].
Unfortunately, its structure does not offer even faint inklings regarding RtcB function, though it revealed a novel
protein fold. Translation of the RFH gene and its accompanying upstream gene is likely coupled, e.g. the stop
codon of the 5' gene and the start codon for the RFH
encoding sequence are always in very close proximity and
their ORFs often overlap. Conserved co-regulation of
translation suggests a relation between functions and conserved co-localization in bacteria [32,33] and points to
physical interactions between the encoded products [34].
Perhaps the most obvious suggestion for the potential
function of the product of the upstream gene is that it substitutes the missing domain 1. However, there is no
detectable sequence similarity between RF domain 1 and
the translation product of the upstream gene, nor any
structural similarity to the protein fold of rtcB, and thus
there is no apparent reason to believe that the upstream
gene product has a function corresponding to the function of domain 1. Another speculative idea links a suggested function of the upstream gene with tRNA/mRNA
processing to RF activity [30]. It is possible that a (specific)
tRNA modifying enzyme would cause a codon specific
translational stop, which could then be terminated by
RFH action. Another option is that RFH releases stalled
ribosomes, assisted by mRNA or perhaps even rRNA modifications by the upstream gene.
Hints regarding the RFH functional role potentially could
be obtained from its evolutionary history. For example, if
RFH were a progenitor of RF1 and RF2, it would be reasonable to expect that it was responsible for termination
of protein synthesis at all stop codons. This would imply
that the versions of RFH that we see in less than 10% of

bacteria are remnants of a decaying gene that is being substituted with more efficient specialized RF1 and RF2. On
the contrary, if RFH gene is a product of a recent duplication of one of the modern variants of RF1 or RF2 genes, it
could be expected that its function is specific for certain
bacterial lineages that share either specific environmental
conditions or certain aspects of metabolism (similarly to
distribution of Pyl-insertion machinery among methanogenic organisms [35]). In such a scenario, the existence of
a significant proportion of bacteria with prfH pseudogenes would be an indicator of unsuccessful horizontal
gene transfer events, rather than an indicator of lineage
specific gene loss.
To attempt to discriminate between different potential
evolutionary scenarios for prfH, we attempted to perform
phylogenetic reconstruction of all bacterial RF genes. For
this purpose, sequences of all release factor genes were
extracted from completed genomes using ARFA program
[22], and an alignment of the corresponding proteins was
built using the ClustalW program [23]. The alignment was
also backtranslated to produce the corresponding nucleotide sequences [see Additional file 1] (note that one
nucleotide in RF2 genes whose expression utilizes ribosomal frameshifting, was removed to make backtranslation possible). To reconstruct phylogenetic trees we used
neighbor-joining method and the minimal evolution
method implemented in the MEGA3 program [36]. The
topologies of trees obtained vary in terms of the location
of a node corresponding to RFH origin and depends on
the evolution models used and the manner of treating
alignment gaps. Both the bootstrap and the interior
branch tests indicated a very low level of confidence for
the corresponding branches. Therefore, our phylogenetic
analysis related to the origin of RFH is inconclusive. However, in the majority of the phylogenetic reconstructions,
the node corresponding to RFH divergence is either more
close to branches corresponding to RF2 genes or is located
within the RF2 sub-tree, suggesting that RFH is evolutionarily closer related to RF2 than to RF1. A consensus tree
obtained by the neighbor-joining method and Dayhoff
matrix as a substitution model, is illustrated in Figure 3A.
Detailed information on a tree shown in Figure 3A can be
found in the additional file that can be viewed with MEGA
[see Additional file 2].
It is hard to estimate the contribution of horizontal gene
transfer to the evolution of RFH. Fig. 3B shows the distribution of RFH genes in the bacterial phylogenetic tree
(based on sequences of small ribosomal subunit rDNAs)
obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project 2 [37].
Branches corresponding to bacteria where RFH genes were
found are indicated by red circles. Note, that the absence
of red circles does not indicate the absence of RFH genes
in the corresponding bacteria, since the complete genome

sequences of many bacteria represented on this tree are
not available. It is clear that RFH occurs in distantly
related bacteria. It is possible that horizontal gene transfer
contributed to the expansion of RFH across lineages, since
most of the bacteria where we found RFH genes are either
animal or plant pathogens and therefore can share a common habitat in human guts. In addition, we found one
RFH member in marine bacteria and we found a number
of RFH encoding sequences (data not shown) in environmental samples obtained from the Sargasso Sea [38].
Again, this does not preclude a possibility of horizontal
gene transfer, given human preferences for the sources of
nutritional supplements and waste management.

We also believe that a more extensive analysis of RFH origin is necessary to obtain the most likely evolutionary scenario of RFH, but it is outside the scope of the current
study. Reconstruction of true phylogeny for release factors
is a complex problem, since it is likely that homologous
recombination between paralogs has contributed to the
evolution of corresponding RF genes due to the high level
of their sequence similarity at certain conserved sites. A
likely example of such homologous recombination can be
seen in the alignment in Fig. 1A for the insertion common
to both RF1 and RF2 sequences from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.

Testing the hypothesis
The essential step towards testing our hypothesis is the
reconstitution of an active RFH (if none of the present
prfH genes encodes an active variant). There is a high
degree of conservation of particular features in RFH,
which suggests that an active form can be restored. Yet, in
E. coli K12 and many other bacteria, the RFH gene is
present as a pseudogene. Disruptions in the corresponding ORFs are illustrated in Fig. 2A. It is also possible that
some genes contain inactivating sense mutations. It is particularly hard to reconstitute an active form of the protein
and assay its activity when its function is not fully understood. It is unclear what kinds of signals are recognized by
RFH. Thus, the first step needs to be the identification of
the mRNA signal that it recognizes. In this regard, the
present knowledge of the medium resolution in situ cryoEM and crystal structures [9,16-18] and high resolution
isolated crystal structures, of RF1 and RF2 [7,8] are very
helpful. We suggest that residues in the anticodon loop
and in the tip of the alpha 5 helix in RF1 and RF2 should
be substituted with those from RFH, or perhaps more significant swapping of larger parts of domains should be
pursued, and then selectivity towards mRNA should be
assayed in the absence and in the presence of the co-conserved upstream gene product. For example, a change of G
(in RF1 and RF2) in position 138 (boxed in Fig 1A) to P
(in RFH) should not change the selectivity of the RFs
towards positions 2 and three of the stop codon, but may
change the selectivity towards the first position. A set of
such experiments with partial and complete swaps of residues in RFs interacting with mRNA may reveal an alternative signal recognized by RFH. Mora et al [13] changed
specificity between RF1 and RF2 by swapping 16 residues
in the mRNA recognition domain using such a strategy.
Despite the seeming simplicity of such experiments, the
elucidation of RFH signal may not be straightforward.
Possibly the design of a chimeric RF, like the one used in
the Ito et al study [12] would be needed. After a potential
RFH signal is found, it will become possible to test naturally encoded RFH for activity as class-I RFs, and subsequently screen for a function of the co-conserved
upstream gene.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

Alternatively, elucidation of the function of the upstream
gene product may point towards potential RFH signals.

Implications of the hypothesis
The evolution of known well established class-I RFs itself
holds several unsolved puzzles. Since there is no strong
evidence for an evolutionary relationship between bacterial class-I RFs and their counterparts from archaea and
eukaryotes, it is unknown how termination was mediated
in the last common ancestor. If there was an RNA-based
factor similar to tRNAs, was it independently substituted
with convergently evolved protein analogs after the kingdoms of life split? It is unknown why there are two class-I
RFs in bacteria, while for most organisms from the other
kingdoms one factor serves the purpose well. Even among
bacteria themselves, there is a small group of Mycoplasma
and Ureplasma species which have lost their RF2 genes
(UGA was reassigned to encode Trp). These bacteria rely
on a sole RF1 for recognition of their remaining stop
codons. Yet these are obligatory pathogens with highly
reduced genomes, and no free-living bacterium is known
to lack either RF1 or RF2. Presumably, strong selective
pressure preserves two class-I RFs in bacteria, although the
benefits of having two factors with overlapping specificity
are not apparent.
The hypothesis presented here of a third class-I RF does
not simplify the situation. On the contrary, it makes it
seem even more complicated. Nevertheless, even though
experimental investigation of RFH may not give simple
answers to above questions, it will help to recreate a more
accurate picture of RF evolution. The most provocative
aspect of the RFH story is the lack of an apparent need for
yet another class-I RF. It is unclear what kind of signals
RFH might recognize in mRNA.
Specific and conserved alterations (compared to RF1 and
RF2) in those parts of RFH that interact with mRNA suggest that RFH recognizes something different from normal
stop codons. Several speculative suggestions can be made
regarding what might be a potential RFH signal. We will
mention a few of them. If RFH recognizes a combination
of standard nucleotides in mRNA other than stop codons
(specifically or non-specifically), it will compete with
tRNAs. This will result in ambiguous translation of sense
codons as stop codons. Under normal conditions, such
ambiguous translation is unlikely to be beneficial. However, during starvation for certain amino acids, premature
termination on their corresponding codons will release
stalled ribosomes. Hence, such a situation might be beneficial if RFH is expressed under starvation conditions for
one or more amino acids. This would be useful in dealing
with the ribosomes whose A-site is unoccupied in contrast
to the RelA mediated stringent response triggered by
stalled ribosomes occupied with deacylated tRNAs [39].

Biology Direct 2006, 1:28

Since equilibrium between such ribosomal states is likely,
RFH may act with RelA in parallel. If correct the function
of RFH would partially overlap with that of tmRNA, but it
would not have the tmRNA feature of ensuring the addition of a C-terminal tag, which is the substrate for a specific protease that rapidly degrades the product.
The co-occurrence of RFH and the upstream gene, may
also represent a toxin/antidote balance. Unwanted premature termination (performed by RFH) would be toxic, and
should be closely controlled by another protein, here suggested to be the upstream gene product.
Another potential role for RFH could be in recognition of
mRNA containing nucleotides that are modified because
of damage or for other reasons. The list of potential signals could be continued. Whatever the RFH function is,
RFH is dispensable in most modern bacteria, meaning
that either its function is also dispensable or it is accomplished by a different parallel system.
We know other examples of organisms with additional
RFs. In A. thaliana, there are three highly similar isogenic
eRF1s [40]. In some ciliates, e. g. Euplotes and in certain
methanogenic archaea, there are two class-I RFs instead of
only one [41,42]. Interestingly, in the genetic codes of ciliates and methanogenic archaea, stop codons have been
reassigned to sense codons. In many Euplotes UGA is reassigned to tryptothan [41], while in methagenic archaea
UAG is translated as pyrrolysine [43]. The corresponding
RF1s in these species have multiple substitutions in the
area of the NIKS motif that is responsible for stop codon
discrimination [42]. Whether the emergence of RFH was a
result of a similar codon reassignment event is another
interesting question to be answered.

Reviewers' comments
Authors' note: The original version of the manuscript
(prior to the revision) referred to the product of prfH as to
RF0. In the revised version we substituted RF0 with RFH
as two referees suggested. Nevertheless, some of reviewers'
reports use the term RF0 and we have left it as is for clarity.
We would like to advice readers that both terms, RF0 and
RFH, refer to the same protein product.

Molecular Biology, Berlin, Germany (nominated by Eugene
Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information,

Bethesda, MD USA)

The manuscript of Baranov et al. hypothesizes that in
addition to the usual two class-I release factors RF1 and
RF2, there are some bacteria that contain a third class-I
release factor, termed here RF0. The manuscript expands
on the observation of Pel and coworkers that the E. coli
strain K12 had a gene that exhibited high similarity to the
canonical release factors RF1 and RF2 and therefore
termed the protein factor RF-H (release factor homologue) and the gene prfH. In light of the many fully and
partially sequenced bacterial genomes, Baranov et al.
reveal that the prfH gene is found in only 10% and that the
bacteria are phylogenetically distinct and from different
environments. In many cases the prfH gene is not intact,
containing deletions or truncations, suggesting it is a
pseudogene, at least in these organisms. Interestingly, an
ORF directly 5' to the prfH gene is found to be conserved
in all cases, whereas an ORF with similar conservation is
not found in prfH lacking organisms, and the stop codon
of the upstream ORF overlaps with the start codon of prfH
suggesting translational coupling. The expected protein
product from the prfH gene, if expressed, would be a minimal RF in that it lacked domain I. The conservation of the
GGQ motif suggests that this factor would be able to
hydrolyze the polypeptide from the tRNA, whereas slight
deviations from RF1 and RF2 in the regions approaching
the mRNA codon, leading to the suggestion that specificity of the RF0 would be distinct from the canonical termination factors.
Clearly, the fact that in some cases the prfH is a pseudogene suggests that it is not an essential factor (at least in
these organisms), however the appearance of this gene in
unrelated bacteria, the possibility of translational coupling with a mysterious upstream gene and the altered but
conserved codon recognition elements, combine to produce an intriguing situation that warrants further investi-

gation. Publication of this hypothesis in Biology Direct
should bring this mystery to the attention of the relevant
researchers capable of pursing this problem.
Some minor points to consider for revision:
1. In the Background section, the E. coli K12 prfH gene is
referred to as a pseudogene. This may well be the case,
especially considering that compared to the intact prfH
genes it has a rather large deletion. But to my knowledge
the expression from this gene has not been checked and it
may not require the upstream gene. Therefore "likely or
probably pseudogene" may be a more cautious term? Furthermore, the way this paragraph is currently written, it
implies that Pel et al. 1992 have termed it a pseudogene
but Pel et al. actually suggest that RF-H may be expressed
and identify a 141 codon ORF starting with AUG and ending with UAA. However, this said, it should be pointed
out that in support of the pseudogene idea is the peculiarities of this strain. Namely, that it has been suggested to
have undergone heavy mutagensis, which was used as a
possible explanation why RF2 in K12 strains contain
Thr246 (making it inactive upon overexpression), instead
of canonical Ala like other E. coli strains (see Dincbas-Renqvist et al., (2000) EMBO J and references therein).
Authors' response: This is correct. Pel et al identified E. coli
K12 sequence homologues to release factors. Correspondingly,
we changed "pseudogene" to "genomic element encoding a protein sequence" in the revised version of the manuscript. The
notion that E. coli K12 prfH is a pseudogene was made during
our study. Our conclusion on E. coli K12 prfH as a pseudogene
is not based on expression data, but on comparison of the prfH
sequence from E. coli K12 with other prfH sequences. For
example when prfH and its upstream gene from E. coli K12 are
compared with E. coli CFT073, there is a deletion of about
1,000 nucleotides (see Figure 2A), but other than that, their
sequences are nearly identical. This thousand nucleotides deletion encompasses the stop codon for the upstream gene and the
start codon for prfH, plus large bulks of both protein sequences.
Even if the corresponding region of E. coli K12 genome is transcribed under certain conditions, its translation would be significantly impaired. Even if some protein products would result
from such translation, they cannot have the same function as
proteins encoded by intact genes. The translation product would
lack one of the central Î²-strands of the Î²-sheet in domain 2,
thus the domain structure would be heavily altered, if at all
folded. Therefore, prfH and its upstream gene in E. coli K12
may be referred as pseudogenes according to the pseudogene.org
definition: "Pseudogenes are genomic DNA sequences similar
to normal genes but non-functional; they are regarded as
defunct relatives of functional genes." Though, clearly this definition can be interpreted differently, since the terms 'function'
and 'gene' are not entirely unambiguous. Besides this definition

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

seems to be imprecise at least because pseudogenes are not necessarily limited to DNA entities.
2. Background section, para 2: while it is true that "Structural studies revealed that such RF anticodons are in close
proximity (if not in direct contact) to positions 2 and 3 of
stop codons", it might be appropriate to cite some of the
biochemical data that first revealed this, for example, the
crosslinking data from the Tate lab (Brown and Tate, JBC
1994; Poole et al.,RNA 1997).
Authors' response: We agree. We included corresponding references and appropriate text in the revised version of the manuscript.
3. In the Hypothesis section, it would be nice to have the
exact number of RF0 containing genomes, with the division of those that are intact and disabled, as well as perhaps what sort of deletions there are. If Figure 2A shows
all the RF0 genes that have deletions then this should be
stated.
Authors' response: While this manuscript was under review,
we have developed a computer program ARFA (Automated
Release Factor Annotation) which is available at [46]. A manuscript describing ARFA was recently published in Bioinformatics, see [22]. While the primary goal of ARFA is annotation of
programmed ribosomal frameshifting in genes encoding bacterial RF2, it also discriminates between RF1, RF2 and RFH.
Analysis of 311 completed bacterial genomes available at RefSeq on 20th of May revealed 23 genomes containing prfH genes
or pseudogenes. We have updated the revised version of the
manuscript with this information. Obvious inactivating mutations (large deletions, frame shifts and nonsense mutations) are
illustrated on Figure 2A and described in the corresponding
text. We cannot exclude the possibility that certain amino acid
substitutions can result in deactivation of these genes and,
therefore cannot give a precise prediction of how many genes
are disabled.
4. Hypothesis section, para 2. Since the yaeJ gene is mentioned here, I think it should be briefly described, otherwise the reader is left feeling ignorant.
Authors' response: yaeJ is another bacterial gene with a conserved GGQ motif. Since other parts of yaeJ do not share significant sequence similarity with RFs, it is unlikely that yaeJ
functions as an RF. We gave an appropriate brief description in
the text.
5. Hypothesis section, para 2: "All together, these combined differences suggest different codon specificity for
RFH." Either that or they suggest non-functionality!! Similarly in the 'Implications of the hypothesis' section, para
3: "Specific and conserved alterations (compared to RF1

Page 9 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:28

and RF2) in those parts of RF0 that interact with mRNA
suggest that RF0 recognizes something different than normal stop codons." May also simply reflect inactivity!!
Authors' response: There are usually many ways to break or
inactivate something. We see this also with the example of the
prfH gene here, where different obviously disabling alterations
can be found. However, the RFH "tripeptide anticodon" is conserved among all prfH genes and their alignment points to evolutionary selection of corresponding residues. Therefore, we
believe that corresponding alterations in RFH have a functional
meaning. This notion is a foundation of our hypothesis that the
prfH product evolved to recognize a specific mRNA signal,
which is different from those recognized by RF1 and RF2. If the
RFH "peptide anticodon" were non-functional, we would
expect many more variants of it than just SXY.
Nevertheless, without experimental evidence we cannot exclude
a possibility that a conservation of this motif in RFH is due to
other constrains than specificity in mRNA recognition.
6. Background, para 2: domain I of RF0 is missing. As
mentioned, this domain is not essential and is probably
involved in recycling through interaction with RF3. I think
the fact that RF3 itself is not essential and even missing in
some organisms should also be mentioned here since this
is in line with the dispensability of domain I.
Authors' response: This is a very good point. We added this
information and relevant references to the revised manuscript.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

would be needed for the different purposes (ribosome rescue vs.
stringent response) and may occur at different conditions. To
our knowledge, it is not known precisely what proportion of the
stalled ribosomes is occupied with deacylated tRNAs compared
to stalled ribosomes with empty A-sites. Likely, there is an equilibrium between these two states, since deacylated tRNAs are
bound to the ribosome reversibly. We made minimal changes to
the text to expand discussion of this particular hypothetical prfH
function in relation to RelA-mediated stringent response.
9. The appearance of the prfH gene in unrelated bacteria is
not thoroughly discussed in evolutionary terms i.e. horizontal transfer versus gene loss etc. The "anticodon" motif
of RFH (SXY) is similar to RF2 (SP(F/Y)). Can it be said if
RF0 is more closely related to RF2 than RF1? i.e. did it
arise from duplication of the RF1 gene or are they equally
related such that RF0 may be progenitor to both RF1 and
RF2 genes and simply has been lost in some organisms.
Authors' response: This comment is similar to the second comment of reviewer 4 (Eugene Koonin) We performed additional
phylogenetic analysis of RFs encoded by completed sequenced
bacterial genomes. We discuss possible RFH evolutionary scenarios in the text of the revised manuscript in detail. Based on
the analysis we think that the similarity between RFH and RF2
"anticodon" motifs in part can be explained by closer relationship of RFH to RF2 than to RF1. This does not necessarily mean
that RFH selectivity to mRNA is more similar to the one of RF2
than the one of RF1.
Also, see our response to reviewer 4.

7. 'Implications of the hypothesis' section, para 2. Perhaps
"truer" should be replaced with "more complete"?
Authors' response: Corrected, it is now "more accurate".
8. 'Implications of the hypothesis' section, para 3. One
scenario that the authors raise for the function of RF0 is
releasing of stalled ribosomes during conditions of amino
acid starvation. Although not mutually exclusive, it
should be recognized that under such conditions the
uncharged tRNA binds at the A site and would prevent
RF0 binding. It is the binding of the deacylated tRNA that
triggers the RelA-mediated ppGpp synthesis that characterizes the stringent response (see Wendrich et al (2002)
Mol Cell and references therein).
Authors' response: We agree with this point. If prfH plays a
role during starvation, its role will be relevant to RelA-mediated
stringent response. However, prfH function is not necessarily
similar to the one of RelA. RelA is responsible for global changes
in the gene expression at the transcriptional level and it binds
to ribosomes whose A-site is occupied by deacylated tRNAs. The
prfH product would be responsible only for the release of the
stalled ribosomes whose A-sites are empty. These two activities

10. Lastly, I am not sure that RF-H warrants renaming just
yet. I think if it is demonstrated to have release factor
activity, then RF0 may be an appropriate name, depending on what its function turns out to be. However, at the
moment I think RF-H, release factor homologue, is perhaps a more careful description.
Authors' response: This comment is parallel to the one by
Reviewer 3 (Warren Tate). We believe that a consistency
among referees is an indicator of the virtue of this suggestion.
We have removed the naming RF0 in the revised version and
substituted it with RFH.

Page 10 of 17

RF0 sequence was first reported some fifteen years ago by
Pell and colleagues in E. coli K12 genome as a pseudogene
that shares significant sequence conservation with two
functional release factors RF1 and RF2. Since then, regardless of having attracted strong interest in this field, no significant progress has been made. To my knowledge, this is
the first most comprehensive characterization of RF0
based on the available sequence database coupled with
the 3D structural modeling. Based on the highly conservative nature of RF0, they propose that RF0 should possess,
or should have possessed, the decoding function in translation. This prediction immediately generates several
interesting questions. Why RF0 is pseudogene and silent?
Does it potentially recognize a specific codon or not? Is
there any circumstance to activate or express RF0? etc. etc.
The authors elaborate their prediction and working
hypothesis in a theoretical way. I found this manuscript is
quite interesting and deserves publication in Biology
Direct. I trust that the following comments might be useful to revise the paper.
1. I am not clear if RF0 is not expressed in ANY organisms
or not. This point must be clarified from available information in the literature or "data not shown" information
if available.
Authors' response: We have not found any published evidence
of RFH expression in any bacteria. Therefore, we can state that
it is currently not known whether RFH is expressed in any bacteria under any conditions. Such a statement is added to the
revised version of the manuscript.
2. The putative RFH anticodon "SXY" seems to be a SPF
(RF2) type. Nevertheless, "Y" has never been appeared in
our previous extensive selection (Nakamura and Ito, FEBS
Letter 514: 30â33, 2002). Hence, I feel it may not be a RF2
or omnipotent type â something different. This might be
useful to your argument.
Authors' response: Yes, indeed, in previous studies phenylalanine was always found in the third position of RF2 "peptide
anticodon". However, in this and in our other recent study [22]
we found a small number of RF2s with tyrosine at this position.
It is not possible without experiments to determine whether this
amino acid substitution will alter the specificity of the RFs in
question. However, both amino acids are bulky aromatics, thus
it is likely that the specificity of such RF2s is unaltered. Therefore, we referred to the RF2 peptide anticodon as to SP(F/Y).
On the other hand, phenylalanine is clearly predominant at
this position among all RF2s, while tyrosine is almost universal
(with one exception where tyrosine has been substituted by a
tryptophan) at the corresponding position in RFH. Similarly,
while proline is predominant in the second position of RFH
"peptide anticodon", it is universal in RF2 at the same position.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

We agree that this can be interpreted as an indicator of different specificity, but we cannot estimate the depth of this difference.
3. Although the above possibility of RF0 reading some
sense codon(s) is fascinating, they might take another
possibility into consideration as well. That is, loss of specificity of reading. It is known that charge-flip variant RF2
proteins, altered at conserved Glu residues adjacent to the
SPF motif, trigger polypeptide release at non-cognate stop,
and even sense, codons (Ito et al., 1998; Uno et al., 2002).
These Glu residues are exposed on one side of the surface
of domain 2/4 of RF2, suggesting that electrostatic interactions between a class 1 RF and the ribosome are important
for the accurate docking in the ribosome (Nakamura and
Ito, 2003). Therefore, given some circumstance allows to
express RF0 in urgent conditions, it is likely that RF0 functions to stop translation at any codons. It is interesting to
speculate this as a novel rescue system.
Authors' response: Indeed the residue attached to the "peptide
anticodon" is usually negative (with a few exceptions). On the
contrary, in RFH there is a conserved positive arginine. We
agree that it is very likely that this change contributes to mRNA
specificity of RFH and indicates that this specificity is different
from RF1 and RF2 and now mention this fact in the revised
manuscript.
Although we believe that the high conservation of the amino
acid motif in the area of the "peptide anticodon" indicates specificity, we cannot exclude that there might be other reasons
behind such conservation and RFH binds to mRNA nonspecifically. It is also possible that RFH will function to rescue stalled
ribosomes.
4. Finally, I am not so confident that simple transplantation of RF0 anticodon "SXY" into the RF2 sequence does
work. Rather, as shown in our paper (Ito et al. Nature
2000), a chimeric RF1/RF2 construct might be useful for
the anticodon swap experiment.
Authors' response: We absolutely agree and these were our
original intentions. One example would be to also make a
shorter 'peptide anticodon' loop. We now describe this part in
greater detail for clarity.

Summary: This manuscript highlights an interesting and
intriguing question about the role of a prokaryotic release

Page 11 of 17

Biology Direct 2006, 1:28

factor (RF) orthologue (RFH) that has the key tripeptide
motifs for codon recognition, and for peptide release but
lacks domain 1 of the classical class-I RFs and has no
known function. This means it has the potential to recognize signals in mRNA and contact the peptidyl transferase
centre of the ribosome but may form a different kind of
interaction with the ribosome. The potential function of
these proteins is intriguing: on the one hand, the gene
appears to be non functional in some species by appearing as a pseudo gene, whereas it appears to be complete in
others. The fact that it sits beside remnants of an ancestral
gene cluster encoding a novel flagellar system in E. coli
K12 (Ren et al., J Bacteriol 2005) is intriguing since it
invokes the thought RFH could have been associated with
a specific case of termination in the past (rather like SELB
vs EFTu in elongation). It is also intriguing that the initiation factor, IF1, family has the decoding domain of the
RFs and the tripeptide motif of RFH is more similar to this
although IF1s lack a GGQ. These proteins have the OB
fold (IF1) (or partial OB fold in the case of the RFs), and
presumably RFH has it also.
Authors' response: We highly appreciate these comments,
which are rich in information potentially relevant to the topic
of the manuscript. We have decided to use reviewer's pointers
and investigate their relation to RFH in more detail.
1. Flagellar system, Flag-1 and Flag-2.
The Ren et al. article describes a novel enetrobacterial flagellar
system that is located in a close proximity to prfH (approximately separated by four-five protein-encoding genes). We
investigated whether there is a correlation between occurrences
of this flagellar system and prfH.
Our brief investigation indicates that there is no direct correlation. These flagellar system clusters is limited to E. coli 042 and
other genes associated with this system occur only in certain
enterobacteria, while prfH can be found in very distant bacteria. On the other hand, there are enterobacteria containing
such flagellar systems but lacking prfH, e. g. Y. pestis. Hence,
the connection is not apparent.
2. Parallel between selB and prfH.
We find this parallel interesting. Let us assume that at some
point during evolution, an amino acid containing a rare chemical element was used and this amino acid was incorporated at
a specific codon. In this, case, termination of translation at such
codon will be beneficial when bacteria are placed in a habitat
lacking this specific element. Hence, a special termination factor that is expressed under certain conditions would be needed.
3. Decoding domain of IF1.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

We understand that by decoding domain in IF1, the referee
means the site of IF1 that binds to the ribosome close to the
mRNA location. Indeed, IF1 and RFs have somewhat a similar
fold and there is a tripeptide (TPY in E. coli and SPY in some
other bacteria) which may interact with mRNA. This, said, it
is unlikely that IF1 recognizes mRNA in a manner similar to
RFs and to RFH in particular. At least there is no reason to
believe that IF1 recognizes mRNA in a specific manner. The
existence of TPY in IF1 and SXY in RFH in the loops assumingly interacting with mRNA is intriguing. This may reflect the
observation that also the 'peptide anticodon' of RFs seemingly
interacts with both rRNA and mRNA, thus the rRNA binding
site of the motif could be similar for IF1. Yet, we believe that
making speculations based on this observation would be too farreaching. Hence, we did not modify our manuscript, a curious
mind will be able to read referees comments and will find it
here.
The manuscript provides some provocative ideas as to
what RFH might be doing and some suggestions for experiments to test whether it recognizes a different stop signal,
perhaps differing the first base. This are readily assessable
although our ideas of recognition might still be too simplistic, despite the compelling modeling of the X ray
derived densities of the decoding RFs loops in a termination complex at the decoding site (Petry et al.,Cell 2005).
GG (or GP) motifs in both RF domains indicate sharp
turns in the structure marking the extremities of the loops
that may relate to the functions but may not be an integral
part of them-this is still to be determined but is an important question to resolve.
Authors' response: We agree that GG/GP conservation may
not be directly related to selectivity of the first position in stop
codons and mention this in the manuscript now. Yet, we
believe, that GG/GP are the best candidates as residues that are
responsible for the first stop codon position discrimination, since
there is no other universally conserved residues in this area.
My own view of the proposed name RF0 is that locking
the nomenclature of this group of genes too closely to the
existing families of RFs (RF1 and RF2) at this stage might
be premature when we do not know whether they function to recognise stop signals or have a release function in
termination. Hence, I would prefer a name like RF-like, or
even oRF (orthologue of RF) that can be later modified if
a closer association with classic RFs emerges with functional data. Nevertheless, the hypotheses are stimulating
for those of us involved in experimental testing of the
importance of residues and motifs in the RF families. This
is a very worthy contribution to the discussion and intellectual argument about this group of interesting proteins.
Authors' response: We changed RF0 to RFH, see our response
to a similar suggestion by reviewer 1.

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:28

Some specific comments:
1. The hypothesis is a good one for experimental testing:
that is there is another class of RFs that recognise non-conventional signals perhaps in a small number of specific
instances.
2. The retention of the two tripeptide motifs that specify
codon recognition, and peptide release (the only motif
conserved through all RFs) in RFH is compelling although
the consequences of the lack of domain 1 are still not
totally clear for ribosome function. Domain 1 seems more
important for RF2 function than for RF1 (independent of
RF3). (This is interesting given that on L11 lacking ribosomes (domain 1 interaction site) RF1 is totally inactive
whereas RF2 has several fold higher activity â Tate et al.,J
Biol Chem 1984). Domain 1 is called inessential in the
manuscript (Background, second paragraph, last line);
perhaps the Mora reference could be given with this statement because they were able to show this specifically with
in vitro assays. This is consistent with our original proposal
of the tRNA analogue hypothesis of two essential but conformationally coupled domains, one for codon recognition, and one for release (Moffat and Tate, J Biol Chem
1994).
Authors' response: We gave a corrected reference to Mora et al.
3. The gaps, GP, and additional amino acid (172) in the
anticodon loops of RFH suggest it will be important to
determine what flexibility there is in this region before
losing codon recognition capacity.
4. It is interesting that the RFHs have the IF1-like SPY
(203â206), and lack RF type sheet structures around that
feature ie following the conserved G (195) and following
(~210+). IF1, RFH, and the conventional RFs look like a
family of proteins with loops that have specific base interactions.
Authors' response: Yes, changes in the vicinity of the SXY
motif strongly suggest that its mRNA specificity is different
from RF2, despite some similarity to its "RF anticodon" SP(F/
Y). However, we can predict neither exact folding of the corresponding loop, nor its precise effect on mRNA recognition.
5. The discussion of the implications for the evolution of
a protein decoding mechanism for stop codons is particularly interesting. If this were originally non-specific or
RNA mediated then an existing protein might have been
captured for this purpose. Did a protein like RFH carry out
a specific function (accelerated release of a protein from
the ribosome?) that was generalised with the development of the RF1 and RF2 families and the acquisition of
domain 1 and RF3 functions? As asked by the authors,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

why have three families of decoding factors, or even the
well documented two families. Relevant to this is that the
RF2 family has the conserved frameshifting mechanism
associated with its expression whereas the RF1 family does
not. There are a number of unresolved questions.
Authors' response: We agree with the referee and believe that
this comment does not require any changes in the manuscript.
6. We have expressed the K12 version, while realizing it
had a shortened N terminus â it expressed well so was not
toxic but all ended up in an inclusion body (perhaps the
reason for lack of toxicity). Our next attempt is to use the
sequence in E. coli 042 (Ren et al.,J Bacteriol. 187
(Feb2005) p1430 where the ancestral 44 gene cluster
(Flag2) abuts prfH (are they connected?).
Authors' response: The completed genome of E. coli strain 042
was not available at NCBI when we made the most recent analysis and in fact it is still not available (referred as in progress at
the moment when these words are written â July 7th, 2006).
Hence, it is not included in our analysis.
However, the sequence of E. coli 042 genome is available at the
Sanger center.
Just for the purpose of this comment, we performed BLAST
analysis of prfH and its upstream gene from E. coli strain
CFT073 against E. coli strain 042. Nucleotide sequences. of
prfH and upstream gene from E. coli 042 are 96% identical
with no indels in the produced alignment.
On the contrary, the 44 gene cluster described in Ren et al article is unique to E. coli 042.
According to our diminutive analysis, E. coli strains CFT073,
042 and UTI89 contain active (at least uninterrupted prfH
and upstream genes). E. coli strains K12 MG1655, O157:H7
str. Sakai, O157:H7 EDL933 and W3110 contain ~1000 nts
deletion in the area covering C-terminal part of upstream gene
product and N-terminal part of RFH.
7. The lack of a domain 1 is interesting â does that suggest
it has a more transitory association with the ribosome as
well as the lack of an RF3 interaction site, or perhaps a
blocking role like IF1 in the A site during initiation? If
there are two binding states (as we believe) the first
dependent upon domain 1 and then, on correct codon
recognition a second state perhaps involving correct positioning of the GGQ (completing unfolding of domain
III)-then can RFH go into the second state without a docking at L7/L12/L11. There are the reports now suggesting
the RFs can function without their domain 1 (RF-1 in particular in vitro and both in vivo but with slow growth).

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:28

These are intriguing question thrown up by the ideas
expressed in this manuscript.
Authors' response: We agree that the lack of a domain 1 is
intriguing, and may also be significant in suggesting a potential
role of RFH.
a) It is possible that domain 1 did not exist in the common progenitor of bacterial RFs. The class II RF RF3 enhances class 1
RF function on the ribosome due to recycling, which assumingly
happens via domain 1. But as the reviewer mentions, domain
1 is not essential for function. Domain 1 is also the least conserved domain in RFs. It has further been shown that domain
1 is flexible in solution, which further adds to the appearance
as an 'added' domain.
b) Indeed the lack of an efficient RF3 mediated recycling of
RFH must be a consequence of the lacking domain 1. However,
spontaneous dissociation of RFs from the ribosome does happen
(as proven in vitro and in vivo) thus RFH would perhaps not
block ribosomes, but cause slow recycling. However, given the
further differences in RFH sequence, the RFH binding to the
ribosome may also be either strengthened or weakened. In our
opinion, it is difficult to judge the effect of the absence of
domain 1 on the speed of dissociation, since that also depends
on the affinity of RFH towards ribosomal binding site, but it
will preclude interaction of RFH with RF3.
Reviewer's report 4
Eugene Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institute of
Health, Bethesda, MD USA

This paper presents a simple and straightforward hypothesis regarding the function of the bacterial PrfH proteins,
a homolog of class 1 release factors. It is proposed that
PrfH is RF0, a novel release factor with a distinct specificity. Of course, it is hard to disagree with this prediction â
given the high level of similarity between PrfH and experimentally characterized release factors. I may note that, in
the COG database that is used in this paper, and in other
databases, PrfH proteins are annotated as putative release
factors, so realistically, the novelty of the hypothesis is not
so dramatic. Of course, a detailed discussion of potential
functions of these uncharacterized proteins is useful.
Herein, however, lie some problems with the current version. Again, given the rather obvious nature of the main
idea, the value of the paper is expected to be in detailed
analysis, and this seems to be somewhat underdeveloped.
Specifically, I see three rather substantial issues:
1. Unfortunately, the manuscript includes no prediction
of the signal recognized by RFH. This is understandable as
there is, apparently, not enough data for making such a
prediction. This being the case, however, I feel that the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/28

title of the paper is somewhat misleading because "...atypical mRNA signals, other than normal stop codons" seems
to imply a specific prediction (the discussion of some possibilities at the end of the paper is really vague). For that
matter, I am not convinced that this aspect of the hypothesis holds once the experiments are done: it is quite a possibility that RF0 does recognize one or more of the
standard stop codons but under some specific conditions.
Authors' response: Our hypothesis has two components:
1. RFH is a class-I release factor.
2. RFH mRNA recognition is different from RF1 and RF2.
The novelty of the first component indeed is not dramatic. In
their original work, Pel and colleagues also hypothesized that
prfH gene encodes a release factor homolog. Because of a very
high sequence similarity, it is not surprising that databases refer
to corresponding genes as encoding putative release factors.
Moreover, in several cases prfH genes are annotated as putative
RF2 genes in the RefSeq database (see ref. 22).
The need of an article about prfH is easy to illustrate. If someone will query Medline for the term prfH, no results will be
returned. Based on our analysis, this gene certainly deserves
more attention. Further, it is an important point, that the original finding by Pel et al [20] concerned a gene that probably
does not have a functional protein product. The deletion of
amino acids encoding a central Î²-strand in the Î²-sheet in
domain 2 is so dramatic that the protein unlikely folds. Thus,
the report of potentially folded and perhaps functional gene
products in evolutionarily distant bacteria, still represents novelty. However, the major critical point of the referee seems to be
not a lack of novelty, rather a lack of sufficient detail. Therefore, we significantly extended our manuscript with additional
material.
We disagree with the referee's comment regarding the second
component of our hypothesis. Although our hypothetical predictions regarding the exact mRNA signals recognized by RFH
indeed lack certainty, we do predict (with high confidence) that
this signal is different from RF1 and RF2. Although we still do
not fully understand how protein-assisted mRNA decoding
occurs, we now have a good sense of what protein components
of RF are responsible for mRNA recognition. This became possible due to recent progress in genetics and structural studies of
release factors. Based on our comparative analysis of the RF
areas interacting with mRNA, it is clear that the difference
between RFH and other RFs is higher than between RF1 and
RF2. The referee believes that RFH is very likely a class-I RF,
while he doubts that its mRNA signal recognition is different
from RF1 or RF2. In our opinion, both statements are equally
hypothetical unless experimentally proven. High sequence similarity points to a common origin, but it does not prove a com-

mon specificity or even a common function. Hence, there is a
small possibility that RFH is not a class-I release factor, despite
very high sequence similarity in the area corresponding to peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis domain. On the contrary high sequence
divergence in the area of mRNA binding domain, strongly suggest functional divergence. Certain comments of the other three
referees indicate that they also believe that it is very likely that
if RFH is a class I RF, it has a different specificity towards
mRNA. Hence, it encourages us to make no change to our original hypothesis regarding RFH mRNA signal.
2. A phylogenetic tree for Class 1 release factors is presented but potential evolutionary scenarios for RF0 are
not discussed. Why is this gene found in only ~10% of the
sequenced bacterial genomes? Is it a result of a relatively
recent duplication? What was the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the evolution of this gene and what
was the role of lineage-specific gene loss (the importance
of the latter is implied by the fact that many bacteria
seems to have prfH pseudogenes)? I believe all of this
deserves explicit and reasonably detailed discussion. Further, it is strange that the tree is mentioned (not really discussed) in the beginning of the section on possible tests of
the hypothesis. Does it have anything to do with those
tests?
Authors' response: This comment is parallel to one of the comments by referee 1. We are thankful to both referees for the
encouragement to perform detailed phylogenetic analysis. We
reconstructed possible evolutionary scenarios for RFH, which
are now described in the text of the revised manuscript. According to this analysis, there are two most likely scenarios. 1. RFH
originated because of a duplication of a common ancestor of
RF2 and RFH. 2. RFH is a result of a duplication of one of RF2
genes after their speciation. Irrelative of what scenario is correct
it seems that RFH did exist in the bacterial world for a long
time and is not a result of a recent duplication. Given the presence of many prfH pseudogenes in modern bacteria (as pointed
out by the referee), it seems reasonable to speculate that prfH
had a wider distribution among bacteria in the past and its
existence in only 10% of modern bacteria is contributed by lineage specific gene loss. Alternatively, prfH genes spread across
lineages through horizontal gene transfer and a large number
of pseudogenes is evidence of a failure of these genes to find a
niche in the metabolism of corresponding bacteria.
We agree with the referee that the description of RFH phylogeny does not belong to the "Testing hypothesis" section and we
changed its location in the revised version. However, indeed
RFH phylogeny is relevant to the "Testing hypothesis" section
and we describe the relationship of our evolutionary analysis to
potential functional roles of RFH.

a supportive material for the revised manuscript to ease such a
future study.
3. I am surprised that the authors do not make a bigger
deal of (and, essentially, draw no conclusions from) the
juxtaposition of the prfH gene with rtcB and their (reasonably) proposed translational coupling. It is true that the
function of RtcB has not been characterized experimentally but it is not an utter mystery. Indeed, the adjacency
of the rtcB gene to RNA cyclase in a great number of
genomes strongly suggest that RtcB is an enzyme of tRNA
and/or rRNA processing as briefly discussed in Koonin et
al. Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R7 (see Table 1 in that paper).
The probable coexpression of prfH with these genes is
quite intriguing and might hold the key to the actual function of RF0. I am sure this is worth some serious discussion in this paper.
Authors' response:
We agree that indeed the upstream genes that belong to the
family of RtcB-like proteins may hold the secret of RFH function. It deserves more attention and we describe it in more
detail in the revised version of the manuscript and provide certain additional speculations regarding this gene and its relation
to potential function in RNA processing/modification.
Moreover, we modified the title of the manuscript to emphasize
this point.

ClustalW alignment of RF codon sequences in the nexus format. The
names of the sequences are given in the following format:
RF2_MC_003919.fna â where RF2 â is the name of the factor (either
RF1, RF2 or RFH), MC_003919 indicates an accession number (substitute M with N to get an accession number), it also indicates a name of a
fasta file from NCBI ftp site which was used in this study, e.g.
NC_003919.fna. Note that sequences corresponding to RF2 genes
expressed via ribosomal frameshift were modified by deletion of one nucleotide in the frameshift site to correct for ORF disruption.
