Divergence of imprinted genes during mammalian
evolution

Abstract
Background: In contrast to the majority of mammalian genes, imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed with the
choice of the active allele depending on its parental origin. Due to their special inheritance patterns, maternally and
paternally expressed genes might be under different evolutionary pressure. Here, we aimed at assessing the
evolutionary history of imprinted genes.
Results: In this study, we investigated the conservation of imprinted genes in vertebrate genomes and their exposition
to natural selection. In a genome-wide comparison, orthologs of imprinted genes show a stronger divergence on
cDNA and protein level in mammals. This pattern is most pronounced for maternally expressed genes in rodents in
comparison to their non-rodent orthologs. The divergence is not attributable to increased mutation of CpG positions.
It is contrasted by strong conservation of paternally expressed genes in mouse and rat. Interestingly, we found that the
early divergence of imprinted genes was accompanied by an unusually strict conservation of their paralogs.
Conclusions: The apparent degeneration of maternally expressed genes may reflect a relaxation of selective pressure
due to counteracting effects on maternal and embryonic fitness. Functional redundancy provided by the presence of
highly conserved (non-imprinted) paralogs may have facilitated the divergence. Moreover, intensification of imprinting
in modern rodents seems to have shifted the evolutionary fate of imprinted genes towards strong purifying selection.
Background
Deciphering the evolution of eukaryotic genes is a key to
understanding their function in different species. As
nearly all mammals are diploid organisms, most of their
genes are expressed from both parental alleles. Nevertheless, a number of genes do not obey this rule, notably socalled imprinted genes. They acquire specific epigenetic
marks in the parental germ lines which are the cause of
monoallelic expression after fertilization. Consequently,
it depends on the parental origin which allele of an
imprinted gene gets inactivated. Genomic imprinting has
been observed in the endosperm of flowering plants and
in the animal kingdom. In the latter, imprinted genes have
so far only been discovered in therian species [1,2].
Monoallelic expression may thus be evolutionary advantageous for particular functions. Based on the finding
that genomic imprinting is a specific feature of species in
which embryo and mother are in direct contact to each

other, imprinted genes were hypothesized to regulate
maternal nutrient supply during embryonic development.
The kinship theory names the different interests of the
parents in the wellbeing of the embryo as a possible evolutionary origin of imprinting [3]. According to this
model, the mother aims at saving resources for subsequent pregnancies that are possibly fathered by different
males, whereas the father is interested in the maximal
exploitation of maternal resources in favor of his own offspring. This would result in a selective pressure towards
silencing of growth promoting genes in the female germ
line, and of growth suppressing genes in the male germ
line. In both cases the result would be monoallelic expression of the respective genes after fertilization.
Due to their monoallelic silencing, imprinted genes
might react differently on natural selection than biallelically expressed genes. In fact, their functional haploidy is
reminiscent of the scenario for genes on the X chromosome, on which both positive and negative selection act
more efficiently than on the autosomes (reviewed in [4]).
Deleterious mutations affecting the expressed allele will

ones would provide immediate advantages. On the other
hand, the inactive allele may accumulate mutations that
remain unexposed as long as the sex of the transmitting
parent does not switch [5]. Imprinted genes have been
supposed to play key roles in the mammalian embryo and
placenta. Hence, evolution of imprinting and speciation
of placental mammals might be linked. Evolution of
imprinting might have subjected the affected genes to
strong purifying selection, or might have triggered a
strong positive selection towards species-specific functions. Fitting into the second scenario it has been
reported that the evolution of imprinting of the MEDEA
gene in Arabidopsis species might have been initiated by
a duplication event and that the evolution of the
imprinted duplicate was accompanied by strong positive
selection [6]. Interestingly, also the evolution of mammalian imprinted genes was suggested to be influenced or
even triggered by duplication events [7,8].
Studies on a limited number of imprinted genes in
mouse and rat did not provide evidence for conspicuous
mutation rates or positive selection in the rodent lineage
[9,10]. Due to their functions as growth regulators, special attention has been paid to the imprinted genes Igf2
and Igf2r. Whereas DNA sequences that encode the
interface region of the IGF2R and IGF2 proteins are
highly conserved, the signal sequence of IGF2R that
determines the protein's location in the cell is strikingly
divergent between mouse and rat as well as between
human and cow [9,10]. Indication of positive selection on
IGF2 in viviparous fish species that developed placentalike structures suggests that evolutionary adaptations of
growth factor encoding genes might predate their
imprinting [11].
To date, about 90 imprinted genes have been identified
in human and mouse [12,13]. In order to assess their evolutionary history in placental mammals, we analyzed
sequence conservation of maternally and paternally
expressed genes and their paralogs in a genome-wide

comparison. We show that the evolution of imprinted
genes is characterized by an accelerated divergence at
DNA and protein level in rodent ancestors. Moreover, the
existence of paralogous genes seems to have facilitated
divergence of imprinted genes.

Results
Maternally expressed genes show reduced conservation

In order to assess the evolutionary conservation of
imprinted genes, we selected 58 pairs of orthologous protein encoding human and mouse genes for which
imprinting has been reported in at least one of the two
species in the Otago Catalogue of Imprinted Genes
[12,13] and in the literature (see additional file 1). These
imprinted genes were compared on a genome-wide scale
to all genes annotated in the HomoloGene database [14].
This database provides information derived from alignments of orthologous RefSeq cDNA and protein
sequences. We extracted identity values for the alignments of human cDNA and amino acid sequences,
respectively, to their orthologs of mouse, rat, chimpanzee, dog, cow, and chicken.
Compared to genome-wide data, human and mouse
ortholog pairs of maternally expressed genes are less conserved in terms of cDNA identity (p < 0.05) and the
encoded proteins show a trend towards reduced identity
(p < 0.06; Table 1, data for individual imprinted genes are
given in additional file 1). Additionally, a prominent feature was the increased number of gaps - corresponding to
insertions or deletions of amino acids - in the sequence
alignments of proteins encoded by maternally expressed
genes (p < 0.05). This might hint at an increase of exon
insertions or deletions, respectively.
Comparing the human to dog, cow, and chimpanzee,
maternally expressed genes exhibit the lowest identities
on DNA and protein levels, thereby supporting an
increased divergence of maternally expressed genes
(additional file 2). However, the reduced conservation

between human and non-rodent species is not statistically significant (p > 0.1). Paternally expressed genes have
a similar level of sequence conservation as the genomic
background in all pairwise comparisons of the human to
other mammalian species.
As imprinted genes are associated with particular,
allele-specific DNA methylation patterns, the observed
divergence of their protein-encoding sequences might be
due to an increased rate of CpG to TpG transitions.
Addressing this issue we investigated the frequencies of
silent CpG to TpG transitions at positions in the cDNA
where these mutations would not change the encoded
amino acid [10,15]. We found that both maternally
expressed genes and the whole imprinted group exhibit
insignificantly lower levels of silent CpG-TpG mismatches in the cDNA alignments compared to genomewide data (p > 0.3). Hence, the increased divergence is not
caused by increased deamination of methylated CpGs.
Divergence of imprinted genes between rodents and other
mammals

The low sequence identity of maternally expressed
orthologs results apparently from an accelerated divergence in mouse or rodents. Further evidence for the latter
hypothesis is provided by comparison of human and rat
genes. The obtained data are consistent with those from
mouse (additional file 3). Here, the reduced conservation
of maternally expressed genes is even more significant (p
< 0.04), which can be attributed to a higher number of
substitutions in the rat [16]. Also between mouse and
cow the conservation of all imprinted and the maternally
expressed genes is lower than that of non-imprinted
genes on the protein and cDNA levels (additional file 2).
Comparisons with other species, for which fewer
sequences of imprinted genes are available, show a tendency towards increased divergence of murine imprinted
genes as well (additional file 2). Interestingly, comparing
mammalian genes to their orthologs in chicken, a species
without imprinting effects, did not reveal any changes in
the conservation of imprinted genes that might be associated with the evolution of imprinting in early mammals.
Increased divergence of maternally expressed genes
might have its cause in increased mutation rates, reduced
purifying selection, or positive selection. Increased mutation rates are indicated by an elevated rate of synonymous
substitutions (Ks) [9,10]. For human-mouse (Table 1) and
mouse-cow (additional file 2) gene pairs, Ks rates are
essentially similar in all groups, thereby contradicting a
major influence of mutation rates. A commonly used
method for estimating selection is determining the ratio
of synonymous substitutions (Ks) and non-synonymous
substitutions (Ka) per site in pairwise alignments of coding DNA [17]. In general, Ka/Ks ratios of below 0.25 indi-

cate purifying selection [16] whereas Ka/Ks values larger
than 1 are indicative of positive selection.
The genome-wide median of the Ka/Ks ratio is 0.100
for mouse-human gene pairs. Ka/Ks tends to be elevated
for the group of 26 maternally expressed genes (median
0.124; p < 0.08) but this is not the case for the 27 paternally expressed ones (median 0.110; p > 0.7). The
imprinted genes with the most elevated Ka/Ks values are
the maternally expressed genes Cdkn1c (Ka/Ks = 0.465)
and Phlda2 (Ka/Ks = 0.390), and the paternally expressed
Usp29 (Ka/Ks = 0.384). As indicated by very low Ka/Ks
values, the strongest purifying selection appears to act on
the paternally expressed genes Snrpn, Mest, Wt1, and
Copg2 (see also additional file 1). The Ka/Ks ratios of the
38 imprinted orthologs available for mouse and cow are
tentatively elevated as well (additional file 2). In summary, the set of imprinted genes studied here does not
contain genes with exceptionally high Ka/Ks ratios that
indicate recent positive selection.
Strong conservation of imprinted genes in modern rodents

Next, we wanted to know whether the reduced conservation of imprinted genes is due to divergence in a common
ancestor of mouse and rat, or whether this evolutionary
process is still ongoing in modern rodents. Intriguingly,
comparison of mouse and rat orthologs (Table 2) shows
that the conservation levels of imprinted genes are similar
to those of all genes on the protein level (p > 0.6), and
even higher on DNA level (p < 0.02). The latter fact is
mostly caused by the paternally expressed genes whereas
maternally expressed genes are similarly conserved as the
genomic background. The Ka/Ks ratio of imprinted genes
(median 0.12) is not significantly higher than genomewide (median 0.10). Murine imprinted genes contain a
median of 2.4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
per 1 kb of coding sequence whereas the genome-wide
median is 3.6 (p < 0.04). This depletion, which is not seen
for human imprinted genes (medians 3.9 and 3.2, respectively; p > 0.4) strongly argues for ongoing purifying
selection on the protein-coding regions of murine
imprinted genes.
Contrary to the pattern observed for mouse-human
gene pairs, mouse-rat imprinted orthologs have a
decreased rate of synonymous substitutions (p < 0.008)
whereas the rate of nonsynonymous changes is not significantly elevated (p > 0.15). This finding holds for both
paternally and maternally expressed genes and is in
agreement with the results of Smith and Hurst [10].
Reduced Ks rates may hint at selection on silent sites
related to alternative splicing and RNA secondary structure requirements [18]. Alternatively, a special chromatin
structure of imprinted genes might reduce overall mutation rates in the germ lines, thereby leading to the
observed lower synonymous substitution rates. A similar

point at a rodent-specific evolutionary pattern.
Reconstructing patterns of ancient evolution

time

The elevated conservation of imprinted genes between
the two rodent species is in contrast to their divergence
from their orthologs in other mammals. Hence, most of
the discerning DNA changes must have taken place
before the split of rat and mouse. Afterwards, imprinted
genes were possibly subjected to strict purifying selection
in mouse and rat (Figure 1). Since both mechanisms
counteract and thus obscure the pattern in the sequences
of extant species, we aimed at estimating conservation
and evolutionary rates before the split of mouse and rat.

divergence

Figure 1 Different patterns of divergence for imprinted and biallelically expressed genes. Imprinted genes (black) supposedly
evolved faster than biallelically expressed genes (gray) in the common
ancestors of rodents. After the split of rat and mouse (dots), imprinted
genes seem to have been subject to stricter purifying selection than biallelically expressed genes. The present conservation pattern reflects a
high divergence of imprinted human-rodent orthologs as opposed to
high conservation between mouse and rat.

From pairwise alignment data on human-mouse
(hs_mm), human-rat (hs_rn) and mouse-rat (mm_rn), we
estimated protein and cDNA identity as well as Ka and Ks
rates between human and a common ancestor of mouse
and rat (hs_rodent) using formula (1) for protein or cDNA
identity given in percent and formula (2) for Ka or Ks
rates.

hs _ rodent = min(hs _ mm, hs _ rn) −

2

(mm _ rn − hs _ mm − hs _ rn )

Formula (1) can be applied for sequences where mm_rn
>hs_mm and mm_rn >hs_rn, which applies to the vast
majority of all genes that are present for all three species
in HomoloGene. In fact, we detected only 21 genes where
the identity of alignments between human and rodent
proteins was higher than that between mouse and rat.
This can be due to differences in the alignments caused
by events such as changes in exon usage during murine
evolution. Likewise, formula (2) is not applicable for 40
cases in which the Ka or Ks rates are higher between the
two rodent species than between human and rodent
sequences.
With regard to the reconstructed rodent ancestor,
sequence identities become higher but more discriminative between imprinted and all genes. Comparisons of the
obtained values of 46 imprinted genes to 14,517 genomewide reconstructions gave results consistent with the
observations described above. Increased divergence of
DNA and protein sequences (p < 0.03) and elevation of
Ka (p < 0.03) of maternally expressed genes became

Hutter et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:116

slightly more significant. In addition we observed trends
toward higher Ka values in the whole imprinted set (p <
0.06), and higher Ks and Ka/Ks rates of maternally
expressed genes (p < 0.09).
An alternative option to trace different evolutionary
constraints in the mammalian lineages is provided by the
PAML package [19]. We constructed branch models
including the cow as fourth mammalian species. In the
imprinted group, the lineage leading to the rodent ancestor has similar Ka/Ks ratios as other lineages for 23 out of
34 genes. For the remaining eleven genes, the two-ratios
model assuming a different Ka/Ks ratio is significantly
more likely than the one-ratio model assuming the same
Ka/Ks ratio for all branches (p < 0.05). For four of these
genes (Cdkn1c, Igf2r, Magel2, and Ndn), the Ka/Ks ratio
calculated by the two-ratios model is elevated in the lineage leading to the rodent ancestor. All four genes were
found to have Ka/Ks rates above the median values for
human-mouse (additional file 1) indicating that these
genes - interestingly members of prominent imprinted
regions - have been subject to species-specific shifts in
evolutionary patterns. Since the PAML estimations of Ka/
Ks are always lower than 1 for all lineages, the imprinted
genes studied here apparently did not experience strong
positive selection but rather relaxation of purifying constraints.
Interacting evolution of imprinted genes and their
paralogs

Identification of general evolutionary principles on the
basis of simple sequence features crucially depends on
the careful construction of suitable control groups. Having originated from the same ancestral gene, paralogs are
supposed to fulfill similar (yet not identical) functions
[20]. Therefore, comparing imprinted genes to their paralogs seemed an attractive opportunity to reveal differences in evolution that are not related to the biochemical
functions of these genes per se but rather to their particular, monoallelic expression pattern. First, we analyzed
whether there is an enrichment of paralogs in the
imprinted gene group according to the Ensembl release
52 [21] annotations for 19,950 human autosomal proteincoding genes. To avoid a bias of genes with many paralogs, we chose for each gene the one that is listed first as
its representative paralog. This paralog is the evolutionary most recent and in most cases also the one with the
highest identity. For some imprinted genes (Dlk1, Inpp5f,
MAGEL2, NAP1L5, NDN, and Peg10) the approach used
here gave different results than previously reported in the
literature [7,8,22,23] (additional file 1). This includes
duplicates that were reported to originate from retrotransposition events from the X chromosome [8]. Nevertheless, 60.71% of the genes in the imprinted group
possess a paralog, a slightly higher percentage than for all

Page 5 of 10

genes on human autosomes (48.22%, χ2 test, p < 0.1).
Interestingly, most duplication events predate the origin
of mammals, also in the imprinted group. With the
exception of Ins1 and Ins2, the imprinted genes studied
here were not involved in duplication events after the
split of the human and rodent lineages.
Several imprinted genes have been linked to paralogs
on the X chromosome [7,8,24] and it has been speculated
that imprinting and X chromosome inactivation may
have co-evolved since they require similar mechanisms of
gene regulation [8,25-27]. We found that the first paralogs of three imprinted genes (DCN, HTR2A, USP29) are
located on the X chromosome. Additional three
(L3MBTL, SLC38A4, UBE3A) have an X-linked paralog
that is not the highest scoring one. The resulting 10.71%
is no significant enrichment compared to the autosomal
ratio of 5.19% (Table 3, χ2 test, p > 0.1). Also in the mouse
there is no significant enrichment of X-linked paralogs of
imprinted genes.
Compared to genome-wide data, human imprinted
genes show less identity with their most recent paralogs
on protein level (p < 0.06, Table 3). In the mouse this
relaxation in paralog conservation is more pronounced (p
< 0.007), and is probably caused by the stronger divergence of imprinted genes in the rodent ancestor as
described above. Taking the average identity of all paralogs per gene as a measure yields lower identity values
without affecting the significance of the differences.
To investigate whether the existence of paralogs might
influence the evolution of protein-coding imprinted
genes, we investigated the conservation of gene orthologs
in presence or absence of paralogs. In the entire genome
and also in the case of imprinted genes, orthologs that
possess paralogs are significantly more conserved
between human and mouse, or mouse and rat than those
without a paralog and have lower Ka/Ks ratios (p < 0.001,
Table 4). Comparing imprinted genes with or without
paralogs, respectively, to the corresponding groups of
autosomal genes, reveals that imprinted genes with paralogs are subject to decreased conservation between
human and rodents (p < 0.04) and tend towards a higher
Ka/Ks ratio (p < 0.09) whereas there is no significant difference between genes without paralogs in both groups (p
> 0.3). Between mouse and rat, genes with paralogs
behave similarly in both groups (p > 0.2) but imprinted
ones without paralogs show increased conservation on
DNA level and a lower Ks ratio (p < 0.002). In all comparisons maternally and paternally expressed genes behaved
similarly. Overall, genes with high numbers of paralogs
did not behave differently from genes with only one or
few paralogs.
Interestingly, the paralogs show a higher conservation
than their imprinted counterparts and all genes in
HomoloGene and remarkably lower Ka/Ks ratios

and paternally expressed genes. Purifying selection thus
seems to act far more strictly on the paralogs of rodent
imprinted genes than on the imprinted genes themselves.

Discussion
Divergence of imprinted genes in early eutherian evolution

Detailed genome-wide analyses on cDNA and protein
level revealed an intriguing evolutionary pattern of
imprinted genes. Compared to their (non-imprinted)
chicken orthologs, imprinted genes show similar
sequence identities and Ka/Ks distributions as all genes in
the HomoloGene database. This suggests that in early
mammals there was no specific evolutionary pressure on
the protein-coding sequences of imprinted genes. In contrast, imprinted genes of mouse and rat show an elevated
divergence of coding DNA sequences and proteins in
comparison to their orthologs in other mammalian species, especially in the human, suggesting that there has
been an increased divergence of imprinted genes in a
common ancestor of mouse and rat. Although the
reduced conservation was only significant for the rodent
lineage, we cannot exclude that imprinted genes underwent a relaxation of selective constraints also in other
species. The observed differences might be more pronounced in rodents due to their shorter generation times
and effects of their larger population sizes [16]. One also
has to keep in mind that the analysis of genes in species
such as dog, cow, and chicken that have not been studied
as long as human and mouse is hampered by a still low
number and quality of available sequences.

In extant rodents, evolutionary processes seem to have
shifted towards purifying selection. At present, murine
imprinted genes are apparently under strong purifying
selection as suggested by the reduction of SNPs. This pattern of evolution, i.e. an initial divergence followed by fixation, is believed to be typical for the evolution of new
functions, for example of duplicated gene copies [28-30]
or for the evolution of new species. Remarkably, the
increased conservation in modern rodents coincides with
a stricter conservation of typical DNA elements in
imprinted genes in the mouse than in the human, such as
intronic CpG islands [31].
Antagonistic feedback effects of maternally expressed
genes

Interestingly, the increased divergence of imprinted genes
affects mostly maternally expressed genes. Especially for
rodents, the reduction of embryonic growth by genes
expressed from the maternal alleles may have provided
evolutionary advantages along with changes in placentation [32,33]. Indeed, the maternally expressed genes
Cdkn1c and Phlda2 that fulfill important functions in the
mouse placenta have the highest Ka/Ks ratios of all
imprinted genes. Thus, a possible explanation for the low
conservation of maternally expressed genes might be the
evolution of new functions in different lineages. However,
the rather modest elevation of the Ka/Ks ratios argues
rather for relaxed constraints than for positive selection.
An alternative scenario is the degeneration of (maternally expressed) growth repressors. These are likely to
have different, counteracting effects on maternal and
embryonic fitness: On the one hand a growth repressor
might reduce the fitness of the embryo, on the other hand

small embryos might increase the number of offspring.
The counteracting effects on embryonic and maternal fitness should result in a reduced selective pressure on
maternally expressed growth regulators, resulting in the
observed relaxed conservation among mammalian species. Since there is no physical interaction between the
embryo and the father, a similar effect of paternally
expressed genes on paternal fitness is hardly conceivable.

In support of this we found that the set of paternally
expressed genes shows a similar or even higher level of
conservation as the genome-wide background.
Paralogs may facilitate divergence of rodent imprinted
genes

We did not find evidence that gene duplication events
originating on the X chromosomes are a key factor in the
evolution of imprinted genes as it has been suggested

previously [8]. However, we cannot exclude that the
duplication of a few genes on the X chromosome and
their translocation to the autosomes might have initiated
the evolution of imprinted genomic regions. Elements
that initially regulated only imprinting of the duplicated
genes may have strengthened and started to influence
also the expression of neighboring genes. Interestingly,
the six genes in our study that possess X-chromosomal
paralogs are distributed over different imprinting
domains, thus representing potential originators.
Although duplication events might not be directly
linked to evolution of imprinted gene regulation, the existence of paralogs may have enabled a greater divergence
of imprinted genes by relaxation of purifying selection.
Genes that possess paralogs show evolutionary patterns
that differ from those of singleton genes [28-30,34]. Notably, there is complementary divergence between pairs of
paralogs, where imprinted genes seem to be concentrated
in the group of the faster evolving duplicates (Figure 2).
The strong conservation of their non-imprinted paralogs
suggests that these genes may have compensated for the
divergence by maintaining the original functions of the
ancestral genes.

Conclusions
The evolutionary fate of maternally expressed genes
appears to be influenced by antagonistic effects on maternal and embryonic fitness, resulting in a relaxation of
selective pressure compared to biallelically expressed
genes. The observed divergence of imprinted genes might
have been compensated by a restrictive conservation of
their paralogs. In most cases the duplication events predated the split of the fish and mammalian lineages and
thus the evolution of imprinting. Long-lasting functional
redundancy may have allowed genes that later became
imprinted to specialize in functions related to placental
and embryonic development. Apparent purifying selection on paternally expressed genes in modern rodents
might be linked with the intensification of imprinting in
species with a pronounced conflict over maternal
resources.
Methods
Gene selection

From the Otago Catalogue of Imprinted Genes [12,13]
and the literature we selected 58 orthologous pairs of
protein-coding genes in human and mouse. For these
pairs, imprinting effects had been observed at least in one
of the two species and the gene sequences could be localized with the UCSC Genome Browser [35] for human
(March 2006 assembly hg18, NCBI build 36.1) and mouse
(February 2006 assembly mm8, NCBI build 36.1). The
genes are listed according to their parental expression in
additional file 1.

genes (s) are more diverged than the orthologs of genes that possess
paralogs. Regarding paralogous pairs of biallelically expressed genes
(b1, b2), one is usually more diverged than the other. If an imprinted
gene (a1i) has a paralog (a2), the imprinted gene itself is in most cases
the more divergent one.

Analysis of orthologous and paralogous sequences

Genome-wide data on orthologous sequences were
retrieved from HomoloGene release 62 [14]. We analyzed
identities of nucleotide and protein sequences, rates of
synonymous substitutions (Ks), rates of nonsynonymous
substitutions (Ka), and their ratios for pairwise sequence
alignments. In case there was more than one homolog
per species, we chose the one with the highest protein
sequence identity. Ka and Ks rates given in the database
are calculated using the method of Nei and Gojobori [36].
Entries with Ks reported as -1 were discarded from Ks
and Ka/Ks analyses.
Information on human and mouse paralogs was taken
from Ensembl Release 52 [21] with the BioMart tool. Paralogs in this database are annotated for the longest transcript of a gene and sorted by taxonomy level: The first
paralog is the evolutionary most recent one. Usually it
corresponds to the best one in terms of identity of both
the query and the target sequence. Thus we chose the
first paralog listed for further analyses. The given
sequences identities refer to the protein sequences.
Alignment generation and identification of SNPs

For 12,143 genes, orthologous sequences of human,
mouse, rat, and cow could be obtained via their identifiers in HomoloGene using the Entrez Programming Utilities [37]. We inferred the cDNAs of their longest open
reading frames and aligned them with transAlign [38].
This program translates the cDNAs into the correspond-

ing amino acid sequences and generates an alignment
using ClustalW [39,40]. The resulting protein alignment
is back-translated into a DNA alignment. Thus, frameshifts due to gaps that are not multiples of three are
avoided. Silent CpG mutability was assessed by calculating the ratio of CpG-CpG pairs and CpG-TpG pairs with
C at the third codon position in pairwise alignments of
human-mouse cDNAs [10,15]. Single nucleotide
exchanges and indels based on dbSNP version 129 [41]
were assigned to the coding exons of all RefSeq genes
using a local installation of the University of California
Genome Browser and the associated tool kit [35] and
analyzed with custom Perl scripts.
Phylogenetic analysis

We used the program codeml from the PAML package
[19] to construct branch models for each four-species
alignment using the unrooted tree (human,(mouse, rat)
#1, cow). The one-ratio model assigns the same Ka/Ks
ratio to each branch, the alternative two-ratios model
estimates a different ratio for the rodent ancestor branch
marked by #1. Ks and Ka rates are calculated separately
by codeml to fulfill the respective Ka/Ks. Genes with Ks =
0 and Ks > 2.5, which is a result of saturation, were omitted from further analyses because these data are unreliable. According to a χ2 distribution with one degree of
freedom, the two-ratios model provides a better fit than
the one-ratio model on a significance level of p < 0.05 if
twice the difference of the two reported log likelihood
ratios is at least 2.71.
