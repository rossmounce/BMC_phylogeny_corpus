Abstract
Background: P-type ATPases in subfamily IV are exclusively eukaryotic transmembrane proteins that have been
proposed to directly translocate the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from
the exofacial to the cytofacial monolayer of the plasma membrane. Eukaryotic genomes contain many genes
encoding members of this subfamily. At present it is unclear why there are so many genes of this kind per organism
or what individual roles these genes perform in organism development.
Results: We have systematically investigated expression and developmental function of the six, tat-1 through 6,
subfamily IV P-type ATPase genes encoded in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. tat-5 is the only ubiquitouslyexpressed essential gene in the group. tat-6 is a poorly-transcribed recent duplicate of tat-5. tat-2 through 4 exhibit
tissue-specific developmentally-regulated expression patterns. Strong expression of both tat-2 and tat-4 occurs in
the intestine and certain other cells of the alimentary system. The two are also expressed in the uterus, during
spermatogenesis and in the fully-formed spermatheca. tat-2 alone is expressed in the pharyngeal gland cells, the
excretory system and a few cells of the developing vulva. The expression pattern of tat-3 is almost completely
different from those of tat-2 and tat-4. tat-3 expression is detectable in the steroidogenic tissues: the hypodermis
and the XXX cells, as well as in most cells of the pharynx (except gland), various tissues of the reproductive
system (except uterus and spermatheca) and seam cells. Deletion of tat-1 through 4 individually interferes little
or not at all with the regular progression of organism growth and development under normal conditions.
However, tat-2 through 4 become essential for reproductive growth during sterol starvation.
Conclusion: tat-5 likely encodes a housekeeping protein that performs the proposed aminophospholipid
translocase function routinely. Although individually dispensable, tat-1 through 4 seem to be at most only partly
redundant. Expression patterns and the sterol deprivation hypersensitivity deletion phenotype of tat-2 through 4
suggest that these genes carry out subtle metabolic functions, such as fine-tuning sterol metabolism in digestive
or steroidogenic tissues. These findings uncover an unexpectedly high degree of specialization and a widespread
involvement in sterol metabolism among the genes encoding the putative aminophospholipid translocases.

Background
Subfamily IV of the P-type ATPase superfamily is a group
of exclusively eukaryotic large multipass transmembrane
proteins that appear to function as inward – from the exofacial to the cytofacial monolayer – translocases of the
aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and of the choline lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) [1,2]. PS, PE and PC are rather
unexpected substrates for these proteins because the "classical" P-type ATPases in subfamilies I, II and III pump
metal cations and protons [3]. Two lines of evidence suggest that members of subfamily IV translocate aminophospholipids. First, biochemical investigations have
determined that heterologously expressed and purified
subfamily IV P-type ATPases progress through the catalytic
cycle and hydrolyze ATP in the presence of specifically PS
and PE [4,5]. And second, genetic studies have consistently found that deletion of genes encoding subfamily IV
members increases exposure on the cell surface of endogenous PS and PE, which are normally mostly concealed,
and diminishes translocation to the cytofacial leaflet of
exogenously-introduced labeled PS and PE, which are
normally quickly internalized [6-10]. Evidence for PC as a
transported substrate is much less extensive, consisting of
observations of labeled PC internalization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [10]. There is still some skepticism that subfamily IV P-type ATPases directly translocate the three
phospholipids (as opposed to pumping some other substance whose concentration gradient drives phospholipid
flip by the actual translocase) [11] or that they are directly
responsible for internalization of PS, PE and PC (as
opposed to facilitating vesicular traffic required for proper
working of the actual translocase) [12]. However, neither
an alternative candidate transported substrate for these
ATPases nor strong evidence for altered vesicular traffic as
the cause of PS, PE and PC exposure on the cell surface in
subfamily IV P-type ATPase mutants has thus far emerged.
Eukaryotic genomes contain many genes encoding P-type
ATPases in subfamily IV (14 in mice and humans) [13].
This brings up the questions: why do eukaryotes require
so many putative aminophospholipid translocases, what
are the individual functions of these genes, and how
should these genes be divided into subgroups in order to
study them? Investigations in the single-cell fungus S. cerevisiae offer some answers. The S. cerevisiae genome
includes five subfamily IV P-type ATPase genes. One of
these, NEO1, is essential [14]. The remaining four – DRS2,
DNF1, DNF2 and DNF3 – are individually dispensable
but together comprise an essential subgroup [15].
Although Drs2p resides predominantly in the Golgi apparatus [16] and Dnf1p and Dnf2p reside predominantly in
the plasma membrane [10], all three must be deleted for
the highest levels of PS and PE exposure on the cell surface
[10,12]. These findings imply that a number of subfamily

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/96

IV P-type ATPases must work in concert to efficiently
sequester the two aminophospholipids in the cytofacial
leaflet [17]. When extrapolated to multicellular organisms, in which loss of aminophospholipid transmembrane asymmetry and PS appearance on the cell surface
are fatal [18], the yeast paradigm predicts that each
somatic cell must express at least two individually nonessential but ubiquitous P-type ATPases in subfamily IV:
one for the Golgi apparatus and one for the plasma membrane.
We have systematically investigated the six, tat-1 through
6, P-type ATPase subfamily IV genes expressed in the multicellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans and found that
expression patterns and deletion phenotypes of these
genes are inconsistent with the predictions of the yeast
paradigm. This does not mean that C. elegans P-type
ATPases in subfamily IV do not translocate PS and PE. In
fact, a recent report shows that loss of tat-1 leads to the
appearance of PS on the surface of germline and certain
somatic cells [6]. Rather, our findings suggest that individually nonessential subfamily IV members, tat-1 through 4,
could not accomplish the bulk of aminophospholipid
internalization even together as a group and, instead, are
specialized to particular tissues, where three of these genes
subtly regulate sterol metabolism by, perhaps, adjusting
transbilayer lipid distribution. The housekeeping aminophospholipid translocase seems to be encoded by tat-5, a
homolog of NEO1.

Results
C. elegans animals express six subfamily IV P-type
ATPases
The C. elegans genome encodes six predicted members of
the P-type ATPase subfamily IV. The genes are named
transbilayer amphipath transporter (tat) 1 through 6 (Additional file 1). The four detected splice isoforms of tat-1 differ with respect to the final five exons (Figure 1A). Each
isoform has a distinct stop codon and is predicted to generate a product with a divergent C terminus (Additional
file 2). The five detected splice isoforms of tat-2 differ with
respect to the first two and the penultimate exons and are
predicted to generate four products with some sequence
variability at the very N and C termini (Figure 1B). Only
two slightly different isoforms of tat-3 were identified
(Figure 1C). The product of the longer isoform contains a
few extra C-terminal amino acids, which are absent in the
shorter version. The tat-4 locus includes two open reading
frames (ORFs), tat-4 and T24H7.6, which appear to form
an operon (Figure 1D). T24H7.6, but not tat-4, cDNA
could be amplified using a splice leader 2 (SL2) primer. In
C. elegans, trans-splicing to SL2 usually indicates that a
gene occupies a subordinate position in an operon [19].
The tat-4 stop codon resides in the same exon as at least
three weak polyadenylation signals (Additional file 2).

clones [20] and low cDNA amplification yield (data not
shown), suggests that this gene is a recent poorlyexpressed duplicate of the very strongly expressed tat-5.
For these reasons, tat-6 was not characterized in detail.

Figure 1 transcripts of tat-1 through 4
Detected
Detected transcripts of tat-1 through 4. While tat-1 (A)
and tat-2 (B) consist of generally shorter exons and undergo
significant alternative splicing, tat-3 (C) and tat-4 (D) include
somewhat longer exons and encode essentially only one version of the product.

Bicistronic tat-4 and T24H7.6 messages were detected that
terminate with the sole T24H7.6 polyadenilation signal
and likely arise when the three tat-4 polyadenylation signals fail to induce poly(A) tail addition. The choice of
polyadenylation site affects translation of neither tat-4 nor
T24H7.6.
Three alternative transcripts of tat-5 were detected. tat-5b
begins with the sequence from the two short exons
located in a close proximity to the upstream ORF and
undergoes trans-splicing to SL2 (Figure 3A). tat-5a and tat5c are almost identical to each other, start with the third
exon located over 3 kilobases downstream from the first
two tat-5b exons and are spliced to SL1 and SL2. In addition to trans-splicing to SL2, subordinate cistrons in an
operon also usually reside close to the previous ORF [19].
By these two criteria, tat-5b is a subordinate cistron in an
operon. The status of tat-5a/c is less certain. The long
sequence from the end of the previous ORF to the start of
tat-5a/c transcripts could conceivably hold another (in
addition to the operon promoter) cis-acting regulatory
element that drives transcription of these two isoforms.
tat-6 is 73% identical with tat-5. A tat-6 deletion mutant
(ok1984, a large middle portion of the protein product
removed; see the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium)
is reportedly viable. Comparatively weak expression of tat6, evidenced by the paucity of the publicly available cDNA

P-type ATPases in subfamily IV are customarily divided
into six classes [13]. A phylogenetic analysis of these
ATPases expressed in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and humans
reveals a substantial evolutionary dissimilarity between
class 2 and the other classes (Figure 2). After the early split
between the branch leading to class 2 and the branch leading to the rest of the classes, class 2 genes have not duplicated significantly. Thus, yeast express a single gene in this
class (NEO1), while C. elegans and humans express two
class 2 genes each (tat-5 and tat-6 in the nematode). The
other branch of the subfamily, in contrast, has quickly
undergone multiplication and diversification. This difference in the extent of evolutionary expansion may indicate
that the strictly preserved class 2 proteins perform some
essential function conserved throughout evolution in all
eukaryotes, while the frequently duplicating ATPases in
the other classes rapidly evolve to fill new roles.
tat-5 is a housekeeping gene
Two tat-5 expression cassettes were constructed (Figure
3A). In the tat-5b::nls::gfp cassette, a region of the operon
promoter drives transcription of a sequence encoding a
nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged green fluorescent
protein (NLS-GFP). In tat-5a/c::nls::gfp, NLS-GFP is under
the control of a fragment spanning the second tat-5
intron. The cassettes were introduced into the nematode
genome via particle bombardment. Two transgenic lines –
one integrated (lcIs481.4) and one extrachromosomal
(lcEx481.2) – carrying tat-5b::nls::gfp transgenes were isolated (Figure 3A). In both lines GFP fluorescence emanates broadly from all inspected tissues at all
developmental stages, except very early embryos and the
germline (Figure 3B–F). One integrated line (lcIs461.3)
carrying tat-5a/c::nls::gfp transgenes was identified. GFP
signal could not be detected in lcIs461.3 embryos or hermaphrodites. These findings suggest that the operon promoter alone controls tat-5 transcription. The ubiquitous
pattern of tat-5 expression revealed using the reporter is
fully supported by in situ staining data from the nematode
expression pattern database (NEXTDB [20]). Thus, tat-5 is
a ubiquitously expressed gene.

N2 (wild-type) animals fed tat-5 double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) in order to suppress TAT-5 via RNA interference
(RNAi) bore dead embryos showing signs of extensive
necrosis (Figure 3G). Some eggs still in the uterus of tat5(RNAi) hermaphrodites also seemed to disintegrate
(data not shown). Similar tat-5(RNAi) phenotypes (hermaphrodite sterility and embryonic lethality) have been
detected in systematic RNAi screens for genes whose sup-

pression causes clear morphological and developmental
abnormalities [21,22]. The three deletion mutants of tat-5
(tm1823, tm1772 and tm1741) are also reportedly
homozygous lethal (see National Bioresource Project for
the Nematode, Tokyo, Japan). Being ubiquitously
expressed and essential for survival, tat-5 has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene.
tat-2 through 4 exhibit developmentally-regulated tissuespecific expression patterns
Two integrated and three extrachromosomal transgenic
lines carrying tat-2::nls::gfp expression cassettes were made
by particle bombardment (Figure 4A). With the exception
of a few instances of ectopic transcription in the extrachromosomal lines, all five generally exhibit nearly identical
patterns of reporter expression. Curiously, GFP fluorescence in the tat-2::nls::gfp transgenic nematodes emanates
not from the nucleus, as would be expected with an NLStagged reporter, but mostly from the plasma membrane
region (Figure 4B–H). Apparently, the short TAT-2-coding
fragment that is retained in the tat-2 expression cassette
"overpowers" the NLS and directs the chimeric reporter
peptide to the plasma membrane compartment.

tat-2 reporter is first clearly detectable in 2-fold stage
embryos in two sets of pharyngeal cells, the developing
pharyngeal-intestinal valve and a set of cells in the posterior (Figure 4B). By the first larval (L1) stage, GFP fluorescence also appears in the intestine (Figure 4C). L4 and
adult animals exhibit reporter signals in unidentified cells
of the pharyngeal procorpus, the gland cells located in the
posterior bulb of the pharynx, the pharyngeal-intestinal
valve, rectal gland cells, the intestine and all cells of the
excretory system (Figure 4D and 4E, and data not shown).
tat-2 reporter signals are also seen in L4 larvae in the primary vulval lineage vulE and vulF cells and in the proximal gonad (Figure 4F and 4G). The vulval fluorescence
vanishes and a moderately strong uterine signal appears
after the uterine-vulval connection is complete in adults
(data not shown). The gonadal signal, emanating from
spermatids, migrates to the spermatheca around the time
of the first ovulation (Figure 4G and 4H).
Three integrated and ten extrachromosomal transgenic
lines carrying tat-3::nls::gfp cassettes were derived (Figure
5A). Four of these (all of the integrated and one extrachromosomal) were investigated in detail and found to exhibit
nearly identical expression patterns. tat-3 reporter signal
first appears in embryos in the developing pharynx (data

not shown). In the fully formed alimentary system, very
strong GFP fluorescence is observed in the muscle, marginal and buccal epithelial cells of the pharynx, the pharyngeal-intestinal valve and, with lesser intensity, the
rectal epithelial cells (Figure 5B–D). Seam cells display
very strong fluorescence as soon as this lineage becomes
established during embryonic development (Figure 5E).
In adults, moderate to weak fluorescence seems to arise
from the XXX cells, some unidentified cells in the head
and tail regions and the hypodermis (Figure 5C and 5E).
In the reproductive system, tat-3 reporter expression
begins in the distal tip cells (DTC) in L1 and in the anchor
cell (AC) in early L3 (Figure 5F and 5G). GFP signal is later
visible in the dividing progeny of the vulval precursor cells
(VPCs). In late L4, the anchor cell fuses with the uterine
seam cell (utse), which does not express the reporter (Figure 5H). The vulval cells continue exhibiting moderate
fluorescence into the adulthood (Figure 5H and 5I).
Four integrated and six extrachromosomal tat-4::nls::gfp
transgenic lines were derived (Figure 6A). Five of these
lines (2 integrated and 3 extrachromosomal) were investigated in detail. Notable tat-4 reporter expression begins in
2–3 fold embryos in the developing pharyngeal-intestinal
valve and unidentified cells at the posterior (Figure 6B). In
the fully formed alimentary system, GFP fluorescence
emanates strongly from the pharyngeal-intestinal valve,
rectal gland cells and the intestine (Figure 6C and 6D). tat4 reporter is also expressed in the uterus, during spermatogenesis in the proximal gonad and in the spermatheca
of previously ovulated adults (Figure 6E–6G).
The available from NEXTDB [20] in situ staining images
corroborate expression of tat-3 in the pharynx and vulva,
of tat-4 in the spermatheca, intestine, pharyngeal-intestinal valve and uterus and of tat-2 in the intestine. tat-1
expression pattern could not be obtained because three
near perfect inverted repeats located in the 5' end of the
tat-1 locus destabilized expression cassette vectors (data
not shown). However, images from NEXTDB show that
tat-1 is also expressed tissue-specifically. Thus, tat-2, tat-3,
tat-4 and, likely, tat-1 all appear to be expressed in developmentally regulated tissues-specific patterns (Table 1).
tat-1 through 4 are nonessential under regular growth
conditions
TAT-2 through 4 expression patterns show that these proteins are present in critical tissues during key periods of
the nematode development. To determine whether curtailing expression of tat-1, tat-2, tat-3 or tat-4 would lead
to gross morphological and developmental abnormalities, N2 animals were fed dsRNA against the four genes.
tat-1(RNAi), tat-2(RNAi), tat-3(RNAi) and tat-4(RNAi)
animals did not exhibit a notable developmental or morphological defect (data not shown). However, staining of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/96

germ line apoptotic cells with annexin V-GFP, a peptide
that binds specifically PS, was altered in tat-1(RNAi) hermaphrodites [23], suggesting that RNAi against tat-1 did
suppress its target.
While the RNAi studies were being conducted, deletion
mutants of tat-2 through 4 became available. tat2(tm1773) (frame shift, splicing acceptor deleted), tat3(tm1275) (frame shift) and tat-4(tm1801) (a basal promoter region and a large portion of the coding sequence
deleted) are very likely null (Figure 4A, Figure 5A and Figure 6A). tat-2(tm1634) lacks an N-terminal exon encoding
44 amino acids present in all isoforms, but may still be
partly functional (Figure 4A). tat-2(tm1773), tat2(tm1634), tat-3(tm1275) and tat-4(tm1801) single and
tat-4(tm1801); tat-3(tm1275) double mutants are all viable.
To determine whether deletion of tat-2 through 4 exerts a
negative effect on nematode growth and reproduction,
synchronized mutant and N2 larvae were followed
through developmental stages, and the viable progeny of
the adult hermaphrodites were counted. Wild-type, tat3(tm1275), tat-4(tm1801) and tat-4(tm1801); tat3(tm1275) animals were essentially indistinguishable
from one another in both the timing of progression
through the developmental stages and the number of viable progeny produced by hermaphrodites (Figure 7). tat2(tm1634) mutants passed through development slightly
slower than un-mutated larvae. This is evident in the
lower and higher number of tat-2(tm1634) offspring produced during, respectively, the first and the last sampling
period, in comparison with the numbers of N2 progeny.
Around 20% (n = 10) of tat-2(tm1773) hermaphrodites
had notably fewer progeny than the rest of animals of the
same genotype. This is reflected in the large standard deviation value for this mutant. However, pair-wise statistical
analysis (ANOVA) shows that the total number of viable
hatchlings for neither tat-2(tm1634) nor tat-2(tm1773)
mutants was significantly different from the corresponding number for N2 animals (P = 0.22 and P = 0.30, respectively). Overall, deletion of tat-1, tat-2, tat-3 or tat-4
individually and tat-3 and tat-4 together does not seem to
impair nematode development or reproduction to a significant degree under regular growth conditions.
tat-2 and tat-4 mutant animals are hypersensitive to sterol
deprivation
C. elegans is a sterol heterotroph that uptakes various
exogenous sterols and converts these compounds to 7dehydrocholesterol [24-26]. The latter metabolite is a precursor of dafachronic acids, a hormone that promotes
reproductive growth [27]. Sterol uptake and conversion to
7-dehydrocholesterol occurs in the intestine [28-30],
while dafachronic acids are synthesized primarily in the

hypodermis [31]. If subfamily IV P-type ATPases TAT-2
through 4 facilitated a step somewhere along the sterol
transport pathway – from the site of exogenous sterol
uptake to the site of 7-dehydrocholesterol conversion to
dafachronic acids, then tat-2 through 4 mutants would
exhibit sterol deprivation hypersensitivity evident in
decreased reproductive growth.

The solid support medium for routine nematode growth
contains sterols from the substances used in its preparation and is also supplemented with cholesterol to the final
concentration of 5000 ng/ml [32]. The combined amount
of sterol in the medium is more than sufficient for optimal nematode growth: N2 animals can grow just as well
on plates enriched with cholesterol to 1000 ng/ml [30].

Expression pattern of tat-1 could not be determined by our method
of choice, and tat-6 was excluded because this gene appears to be a
recent poorly expressed duplicate of tat-5.

sensitive to cholesterol deprivation, test plates were specially prepared to eliminate all exogenous sources of sterol
and then supplemented with cholesterol to the final concentrations of 1000 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml or 1 ng/
ml. OP50 strain Escherichia coli cultures were grown in a
synthetic defined medium without sterol, then supplemented with cholesterol to the same concentrations as the
plates. Test plates were spotted with a bacterial culture of
the same cholesterol concentration. The resultant food
lawns on the test plates were almost identical in size. Eggs
from gravid hermaphrodites grown on regular full-sterol
plates were collected using the alkaline hypochlorite
method, hatched overnight on no-sterol plates, and then
the hatchlings were transferred to test plates, 30 per plate
(on day one). The first generation larvae on the test plates
grew to maturity and reproduced because these animals
contained reserve sterol deposited into oocytes by the
mothers maintained on the regular high supply of the

nutrient [29]. The second generation lacked sterol reserves
and exhibited notable effects of sterol deprivation.
Growth of N2 animals on the test plates was proportional
to the amount of cholesterol in the medium (Figure 8). By
the fifth day, N2 populations on 1000 ng/ml and 100 ng/
ml cholesterol plates cleared all bacterial food and began
starving. This indicates that the first generation animals
produced plenty of viable progeny and that the second
generation grew quickly without significant mortality. N2
populations on 10 ng/ml cholesterol plates cleared food
on day 7. By this same time, N2 1 ng/ml cholesterol plates
still contained plenty of food and fewer and much smaller
second-generation animals.
tat-3(tm1275) populations grew on the test plates at the
same pace as the wild-type populations. In contrast, tat2(tm1634) and tat-4(tm1801) populations exhibited a
much more dramatic retardation of growth (Figure 8).
Food on tat-2(tm1634) and tat-4(tm1801) 1000 ng/ml
cholesterol plates was cleared on day 7: two days later
than on the same cholesterol concentration N2 and tat3(tm1275) plates. Significantly, on 100 ng/ml and lower
cholesterol concentration plates, growth of the second
generation tat-2(tm1634) and tat-4(tm1801) larvae progressed minimally. This is evident in slight, if any, changes
in the size of tat-2(tm1634) and tat-4(tm1801) populations and individual animals from day 5 to 7 (Figure 8).
tat-2(tm1634) and tat-4(tm1801) mutants did not appear

to suffer from a particular developmental or morphological defect but rather respond to sterol limitation more dramatically than N2 and tat-3 animals. Furthermore, the
developmental delay exhibited by tat-2(tm1634) animals
on the sterol-limited test plates was much more severe
than the mild lag in development these mutants showed
on regular plates. tat-2(tm1773) populations also exhibited severe growth retardation on sterol-limited test plates
(data not shown). Since it is unlikely that three independently derived deletion alleles in two related genes would
contain secondary mutations that cause an identical phenotype, mutagenesis of specifically tat-2 and tat-4 seems
to induce hypersensitivity to sterol deprivation.
tat-4(tm1801); tat-3(tm1275) double mutants are more
sensitive to sterol availability than tat-4(tm1801) single
mutants
The above data suggest that tat-3 is not a major player in
sterol metabolism; however, the gene is expressed in the
hypodermis, a major steroidogenic tissue [28], and in the
pharynx, a potential sterol storage organ [32]. To test
whether tat-3 contributes marginally to sterol metabolism, tat-3(tm1275) mutants were crossed with tat4(tm1801) mutants to derive a double mutant of the two
genes. tat-3 and tat-4 expression patterns overlap only in
the pharyngeal-intestinal valve (Table 1), and in terms of
development and reproduction under regular conditions,
tat-4(tm1801); tat-3(tm1275) animals are indistinguishable from N2 nematodes (Figure 7). On sterol-deprivation
test plates, double mutants of the two genes performed
worse than tat-4(tm1801) nematodes (Figure 9). tat4(tm1801) populations were noticeably larger than tat4(tm1801); tat-3(tm1275) populations by day 7 on 1000
ng/ml cholesterol concentration plates. By day 8 on the
same plates, tat-4(tm1801) animals cleared all food, while
there were still plenty of bacteria to consume for the double mutants. Growth was minimal on 100 ng/ml and
lower cholesterol concentration plates for both tat4(tm1801); tat-3(tm1275) and tat-4(tm1801) animals
during the 9-day observation period. Thus, it seems deletion of tat-3 exacerbates sterol-deprivation hypersensitivity of tat-4 mutants.

Discussion
Specialization and redundancy among the C. elegans
putative aminophospholipid translocases
Eukaryotic genomes contain many genes encoding subfamily IV P-type ATPases [13]. The need for such an abundance of these genes per organism and their individual
functions are presently poorly understood. Closely related
genes may be at least partly redundant or they may be
functionally highly specialized. The C. elegans genome
includes six, tat-1 through 6, genes whose protein products are P-type ATPases in subfamily IV. The data pre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/96

sented here indicate that tat-5 encodes the sole
ubiquitously expressed and essential subfamily IV P-type
ATPase. tat-5(RNAi) phenotype is dramatic: sterility and
embryonic lethality; furthermore, tissues of tat-5(RNAi)
embryos exhibit extensive necrotic cell death. These observations suggest that TAT-5 performs a very critical housekeeping function. Together with the yeast Neo1p [14],
which is also essential, TAT-5 segregates in class 2, the
most ancient class of P-type ATPases in subfamily IV.
Thus, it seems that class 2 genes encode highly specialized
subfamily IV P-type ATPases that execute a critically
important housekeeping function.
Individual deletion of the remaining C. elegans subfamily
IV P-type ATPase genes, tat-1 through 4, (excluding tat-6,
a recent poorly expressed duplication of tat-5) does not
grossly impair C. elegans growth and development. This
would be consistent with a high degree of redundancy
among these genes. However, an analysis of expression
and involvement in sterol metabolism exhibited by tat-2
through 4 suggests a different explanation. While tat-4 is
expressed in the same tissues as tat-2, tat-3 expression
occurs in almost completely different tissues than those
expressing either tat-2 and tat-4 or tat-2 alone (Table 1).
Furthermore, tat-4; tat-3 double mutants are just as viable
as tat-4 and tat-3 single mutants and wild-type animals.
These observations indicate that although closely related
(both in class 5), tat-3 and tat-4 are not redundant.
Although the less closely related tat-2 (class 1b) and tat-4
are expressed in the same tissues, deletion of either one
confers hypersensitivity to sterol deprivation to the same
extent, which suggests that the two at most only partly
redundant. tat-2 is the only gene of the three expressed in
the excretory system. Curiously, while tat-3 expression
occurs in all VPC progeny during vulval development and
then continues on in the adult vulva, tat-2 expression
takes place specifically in the vulE and vulF cells during
vulval development only. This suggests that the two genes
perform different roles in the development of the vulva.
Expression pattern of tat-1 (class 1a) could not be
obtained with our method of choice (transcriptional
reporters stably introduced into the genome using particle
bombardment). However, the data presented by DarlandRansom et al. [6] indicate that this gene is expressed in the
gonad and body-wall muscle cells – tissues in which tat-2
through 4 are not expressed. Overall, the lack of gross
growth and development impairment in tat-1 through 4
mutants does not seem to stem from a high level of redundancy among these genes.
While the individually dispensable S. cerevisiae subfamily
IV P-type ATPase genes (DRS2, DNF1, DNF2 and DNF3)
are essential as a group [17], the individually dispensable
C. elegans subfamily IV P-type ATPase genes may also be
dispensable as a group. tat-1 seems to be the only dispen-

sable subfamily IV P-type ATPase expressed in the bodywall muscle cells [6]. tat-1 null animals lose a few extra
muscle cells, but this does not translate into a notable
growth defect [6]. This suggests that together the four class
1 and 5 subfamily IV P-type ATPases are nonessential for
routine growth and development of C. elegans cells.
Investigations in S. cerevisiae suggest that individually dispensable subfamily IV P-type ATPases are redundant,
especially with respect to internalization of PS and PE
[17]. However, this does not seem to be the case for individually dispensable C. elegans subfamily IV P-type
ATPases. Considering that C. elegans germline and
somatic cells normally conceal PS [23] and that loss of tat1 leads to PS appearance on the surface of germline and
certain somatic cells [6], the contradiction between the
yeast and the nematode paradigms does not imply that
subfamily IV P-type ATPases of the latter organism do not
translocate aminophospholipids. Rather, considering that
class 2 subfamily IV members may execute the same biochemical functions as subfamily IV members in other
classes [14] and that loss of asymmetric PS and PE distribution across the plasma membrane is incompatible with
survival [33], our findings suggest that, in the nematode,
TAT-5 carries out the bulk of aminophospholipids internalization, while TAT-1 through 4 adjust cross-bilayer
lipid distribution in particular tissues.
C. elegans subfamily IV P-type ATPases fine-tune sterol
metabolism
C. elegans is a sterol heterotroph that employs a steroidmediated developmental program. The nematode takes
up exogenous sterols in the intestine and then converts
them to 7-dehydrocholesterol [28]. The latter metabolite
is used for synthesis of the reproductive development-promoting hormone, dafachronic acids, in the hypodermis
[27,28]. In unfavorable growth conditions, production of
the hormone stops and nematode larvae embark on the
dauer (dispersal) developmental pathway. Complete
sterol deprivation mimics cessation of the hormone synthesis in an otherwise favorable growth environment [34].
At sterol supplies below optimal, nematode development
and reproduction are proportional to sterol concentration
in the medium [30]. As a result, C. elegans reproductive
growth is a sensitive indicator of the sterol level in the
hypodermis after this lipid was taken up in the intestine
and then traveled through the animal body.

Our data show that tat-2 and tat-4 are required for growth
during sterol starvation and that deletion of tat-3 exacerbates sterol hypersensitivity of tat-4 mutants. From the
late stages of embryonic development through the rest of
the nematode life cycle, tat-2 and tat-4 are strongly
expressed in the intestine and other cells of the alimentary
system; it is likely that the protein products of these genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/96

fine-tune some aspects of sterol processing in these sterolmetabolizing tissues. tat-2 is a homolog of the mammalian Atp8b1/ATP8B1, which encodes subfamily IV P-type
ATPase that localizes to the apical membrane of hepatocytes, enterocytes and other polarized cells of the mammalian digestive system [35,36]. Future investigations
should determine whether TAT-2 also localizes to the apical membrane and whether TAT-4 resides in the same
membrane as TAT-2. tat-3 is expressed in the hypodermis
and the XXX cells, both steroidogenic tissues where 7dehydrocholesterol is converted to dafachromic acids
[28]. Thus, it is likely that the product of this gene mediates, at least partly, turnover of 7-dehydrocholesterol after
the release of this metabolite from the intestine. Future
research should test this hypothesis, as well as determine
the membrane compartment in which TAT-3 resides.
Overall, the lack of a notable phenotype in tat-1(RNAi)
and tat-2 through 4 null mutants during growth under
normal conditions and the inability of tat-2 and tat-4
mutants to grow under sterol limiting conditions indicate
that one critical function of the dispensable subfamily IV
P-type ATPases may be to fine tune metabolism of sterol
and, perhaps, other lipids.
Recent reports indicate that the yeast DRS2 is also
involved in sterol (ergosterol) metabolism [37-39].
DRS2Δ mutants exhibit reduced ability to uptake exogenous sterol. Atp8b1/ATP8B1 mediates sterol (cholesterol)
metabolism in mammals [40,41]. Mutants of Atp8b1
secrete more cholesterol with bile [40]. And homozygous
individuals with compromised ATP8B1 exhibit reduced
levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and
greatly increased levels of oxidized cholesterol [41].
Together with these previous findings in yeast and mammals, involvement of tat-2 through 4 in sterol metabolism
in C. elegans suggests that the role performed by the subfamily IV P-type ATPases in this process may be conserved
among eukaryotes and far greater than currently recognized.

Conclusion
The presented study shows that individually dispensable
C. elegans putative aminophospholipid translocase genes
exhibit a high degree of specialization. This finding contradicts the expectation derived from investigations in
yeast that these genes should be broadly redundant and
answers the question of why there are so many genes of
this kind per organism. Our study also partly answers the
question of individual roles performed by putative aminophospholipid translocases by uncovering widespread
involvement of members of this group in sterol metabolism.

Methods
C. elegans culture and genetics
The following strains and mutants of C. elegans were used:
var. Bristol strain N2 (wild type), unc-119(-), tat2(tm1634) IV, tat-2(1773) IV, tat-3(tm1275) III, tat4(tm1801) II and tat-4(tm1801) II; tat-3(tm1275) III. The
4 tat mutants were isolated in the var. Bristol strain N2
background by the National Bioresource Project for the
Experimental Animal Nematode [42]. The mutants were
out-crossed 2 to 8 times to N2 animals. Except where
noted, C. elegans animals were maintained on standard
nematode growth medium plates spotted with E. coli
OP50 at 20°C [32].
Gene transcription analysis
Mixed-stage N2 animals were grown on enriched peptone
plates. Populations approaching starvation were collected, combined, re-suspended in Trizol® (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), freeze-thawed three times and treated to
20 strokes of the A pestle in a 40 ml Dounce homogenizer.
Total RNA was then isolated as recommended by the Trizol manufacturer. mRNA was purified from the total RNA
with a Poly(A)Pure kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was
synthesized using either the dT(18) or the adaptor-dT(18)
primers (see Additional file 4). For 5' RACE, a splice
leader-specific primer and a gene-specific primer (GSP)
were employed; for 3' RACE, a GSP and the adaptordT(18) primer were used. Products of cDNA amplification
were resolved on aragose gels, purified and cloned into a
TA helper vector. A number of clones for each distinct
band on the agarose gels were sequenced (see Additional
file 4). The following ESTs kindly provided by Dr. Kohara
were sequenced: yk1228h06, yk34c11, yk1496c06,
yk209d5, yk36b8, yk214f10 and yk126b10.
Gene expression analysis
Nucleus-targeted transcriptional reporters were used to
visualize tat-2 through 5 expression. This approach was
chosen because tats are very long genes; a tag often destabilizes P-type ATPases in subfamily IV ([14] and Lyssenko,
unpublished observations); in yeast and mammals, members of the subfamily exit the Golgi apparatus only as a
heterodimer with proteins in the Cdc50p/Lam3p group
[7,12], over-expression of the tats may lead to accumulation of un-paired peptide in the Golgi apparatus and
potentially induction of the unfolded protein response,
which could then trigger apoptosis of the reporterexpressing cells; and finally, concentrating reporters in the
nucleus facilitates cell identification [43]. Note also that
when long portions (long enough to code for over 65
amino acids) of tat-2 and tat-4 translated sequences were
included into expression cassettes, these cassettes did not
assemble into extrachromosomal arrays and did not integrate into the genome (Additional file 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/96

Chromosomal fragments that contain promoter regions
of tat-2 through 5 were cloned from the YAC Y17G9 and
cosmids T24H7, W09D10 and F36H2 into pPD95.69, a
promoter-less NLS-GFP expression vector from the Fire
vector kit, using standard cloning methods (see Additional file 4). DNA of an expression vector was co-precipitated with DNA of a vector carrying unc-119(+)
(pDP#MM016B [44]) onto gold particles as described by
Tucker et al. [45], and then the coated particles were bombarded into the gonad of unc-119(-) nematodes as
described by Praitis et al. [46] with some modifications
(see Additional file 4). After bombardment, nematodes
were washed off the plate and transferred to 2 or 3 fresh
plates. Following an incubation period, stably transgenic
lines (not exhibiting the Unc phenotype) were selected
from the plates: only one hermaphrodite from each plate
with non-Unc animals. Integrated lines were identified by
whether animals homozygous for the trangene could be
derived.
RNA interference
500 to 900 bp-long 5' fragments of tat-1 through 5 cDNA
clones were sub-cloned into pPD129.36 (inverted-T7-promoter vector from the Fire vector kit). dsRNA production
and nematode feeding were conducted as described in
Kamath et al. [47] (see Additional file 4).
Growth and reproduction under regular conditions
Gravid N2 and mutant hermaphrodites were allowed to
lay eggs on fresh plates for 2 h. The animals were then
removed, and the eggs left to hatch overnight. The next
day, 10–12 larvae per genotype were transferred to individual plates: one larva per plate. 94 and 118 h later, the
now adult nematodes were transferred to new plates. The
old plates were incubated overnight to permit all viable
eggs to hatch, chilled on ice to halt nematode movement,
and then the larvae were counted. 0–94 h, 94–118 h and
118–154 h are sampling periods one, two and three,
respectively.
Sterol deprivation assay
A mixture of agarose (8 g/l) and ether-extracted peptone
in water was autoclaved for 30 min, cooled to 65°C in a
water bath and enriched to the desired concentrations
with 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol. An OP50 strain E.
coli culture was grown in a minimal medium (20 mM
NH4Cl, 0.2% w/v D-glucose, 2 mg/ml uracil in M9 buffer)
overnight at 37°C. The culture was divided into 4 aliquots, which were centrifuged to remove the supernatant,
re-suspended in the same volume of peptone solution
(0.5% w/v peptone in M9 buffer) and enriched with cholesterol to the same 4 final concentrations as the plates.
The suspensions were then pipetted carefully onto the corresponding concentration plates to produce uniform
spots. Nematodes were synchronized at L1 by hatching

eggs on no-sterol plates. L1 larvae were then transferred to
spotted plates, exactly 30 animals per plate. 3 replica
plates were seeded per cholesterol concentration per genotype. The populations were allowed to grow at 20°C for
1.5–2 weeks with periodic observations.
