Expression of connexin genes in the human retina
Goran Söhl1,3*, Antonia Joussen2,4, Norbert Kociok2,5, Klaus Willecke1,6

Abstract
Background: Gap junction channels allow direct metabolically and electrical coupling between adjacent cells in
various mammalian tissues. Each channel is composed of 12 protein subunits, termed connexins (Cx). In the mouse
retina, Cx43 could be localized mostly between astroglial cells whereas expression of Cx36, Cx45 and Cx57 genes
has been detected in different neuronal subtypes. In the human retina, however, the expression pattern of
connexin genes is largely unknown.
Methods: Northern blot hybridizations, RT-PCR as well as immunofluorescence analyses helped to explore at least
partially the expression pattern of the following human connexin genes GJD2 (hCx36), GJC1 (hCx45), GJA9 (hCx59)
and GJA10 (hCx62) in the human retina.
Results: Here we report that Northern blot hybridization signals of the orthologuous hCx36 and hCx45 were found
in human retinal RNA. Immunofluorescence signals for both connexins could be located in both inner and outer
plexiform layer (IPL, OPL). Expression of a third connexin gene denoted as GJA10 (Cx62) was also detected after
Northern blot hybridization in the human retina. Interestingly, its gene structure is similar to that of Gja10 (mCx57)
being expressed in mouse horizontal cells. RT-PCR analysis suggested that an additional exon of about 25 kb
further downstream, coding for 12 amino acid residues, is spliced to the nearly complete reading frame on exon2
of GJA10 (Cx62). Cx59 mRNA, however, with high sequence identity to zebrafish Cx55.5 was only weakly detectable
by RT-PCR in cDNA of human retina.
Conclusion: In contrast to the neuron-expressed connexin genes Gjd2 coding for mCx36, Gjc1 coding for mCx45
and Gja10 coding for mCx57 in the mouse, a subset of 4 connexin genes, including the unique GJA9 (Cx59) and
GJA10 (Cx62), could be detected at least as transcript isoforms in the human retina. First immunofluorescence
analyses revealed a staining pattern of hCx36 and hCx45 expression both in the IPL and OPL, partially reminiscent
to that in the mouse, although additional post-mortem material is needed to further explore their sublaminaspecific distribution. Appropriate antibodies against Cx59 and Cx62 protein will clarify expression of these proteins
in future studies.

Methods
Gap junction channels allow direct metabolic and electrical communication between neighboring cells. They are
composed of two hemi-channels also denoted as connexons, each constisting of six connexin protein subunits [1].
Gap Junctions are widely distributed among mammals
and known to be expressed in a spatio-temporal fashion
[2] i.e. in both the retina as well as in the CNS [3-5].
In the vertebrate retina, gap junctions are found between
nearly all cell types [6]. Cone pedicles are coupled to each
other as well as to rod spherules [7]. Only the same

subtypes of horizontal cells are coupled between their dendrites, somata and axons [8-11]. Gap junctional coupling
of bipolar cells is present between axons or dendrites of
either the same or different subtypes [12]. Amacrine cell
coupling is still largely unexplored but their homologous
dendro-dendritic gap junctions (mostly between AII-AII
cells, see [13]) can be readily distinguished from the heterologous junctions connecting them to ON-cone bipolar
cells [14-16]. Finally, both homologuous as well as heterologuous coupling is known for ganglion and amacrine
cells [17-19].
To study the cell-type specific expression profile of
different connexins in the retina, transgenic mouse
models have been generated [5]. Among the nearly 20
different connexin genes discovered in the mouse and

human genome [20], Cx36 protein expression could be
localized between AII-amacrine cells [21], in cone pedicles and OFF-cone bipolar cells [22] and between dendrites of the a-type ganglion cells [23,24]. Cx45 protein
detected in the IPL and OPL [25], was later localized
adjacent to Cx36 in ON-cone bipolar cells, presumably
contributing to heterologuous gap junctions connecting
AII-amacrine cells to ON-cone bipolar cells [26].
Furthermore, Cx45 was demonstrated between bistratified ganglion cells [27]. Targeted deletion of Cx36 in the
mouse retina subsequently led to visual transmission
defects including a reduction of the b-wave [28] and the
elimination of rod-mediated, ON-center responses at
the ganglion cell level [29]. Subsequently, the ablation of
the Cx45 coding region also resulted in a reduction of
the b-wave similar to what was observed after ablation
of the Cx36 protein [28]. Expression of the Cx57 gene
was discovered in mouse retinal horizontal cells after
replacing the Cx57 coding region by the lacZ reporter
gene [30]. To date, other connexin isoforms (Cx31,
Cx32 and Cx40) can be largely excluded from retinal
neurons [31] or are known to occur in astrocytes of the
mouse retina [25].
However, expression of connexin isoforms in the primate or human retina is still largely unexplored. Primate
cones were apparently interconnected by gap junctions
that might cause a modest decrease in human color discrimination coinciding with an increase in luminance
discrimination [32]. Is the expression pattern of connexin genes in the human retina similar to the connexin
expression pattern in mouse retina?
Three years ago the nomenclature of the mouse
(http://www.informatics.jax.org search on “connexin” to
go the complete list) and human (http://genenames.org/
genefamily/gj.php) connexin genes has been extended in
parallel. According to this nomenclature the human
genes coding for hCx36 and hCx45 are abbreviated as
GJD2 and GJC1, respectively, whereas hCx59 and hCx62
are abbreviated as GJA9 and GJA10, respectively.
Here we have investigated the expression profile of
hCx36 and hCx45, known as the putative human orthologs to mCx36 and mCx45, in human retina. Their transcripts were detected after Northern blot hybridization as
well as immunopositive signals suggesting the presence of
hCx36 and hCx45 proteins in both the inner and outer
plexiform layers. Additionally, mRNA of hCx62, the putative human ortholog of mCx57 (Gja10), was found after
Northern blot hybridization. HCx59 (GJA9), having no
ortholog in the mouse genome [20,33], shows a high phylogenetic sequence relationship to zebrafish Cx52.6 [34],
zebrafish Cx55.5 [35] but much less to mCx57 and porcine
Cx60 [55]. However, in contrast the hCx62, hCx59 transcripts could not be detected after Northern blot hybridization, presumably due to their very low abundance.

Therefore, we also tested expression of hCx59 and hCx62
by RT-PCR and found specific amplicons in cDNA
synthesized from total human retinal RNA. Consequently,
hCx62 is likely to be spliced in accordance with its mouse
ortholog mCx57 [30], i.e. splicing of a third exon to the
C-terminal leads to replacement of the last 63 amino acid
residues by the same 12 amino acid residues [NMLLELSSIMKK] discovered in the spliced mouse Cx57 cDNA.
The future availability of specific antibodies against hCx59
and hCx62 proteins should elucidate the presence of these
proteins in human retina.

Methods
Sequence analysis

We have used the “ClustralW” protein sequence alignment program of the HUSAR/EMBL/Heidelberg platform to establish a multiple sequence alignment file
[.msf] of the connexins zebrafish Cx52.6 (acc. no.
AAM46775), zebrafish Cx55.5 (acc. no. AAG24878),
mCx57 (acc. no. CAB40358), porcine Cx60 [55], hCx59
(acc. no. AAG09406), hCx62 (acc. no. CAC93847).
Using this file, the program “Phylip2Tree” calculated the
phylogenetic relations between these connexins.
Alignments of mouse the Cx57 sequence to the
human Cx59 and Cx62 sequences were done by using
the Human-Mouse alignment browser with the
“BLASTZ” algorithms. The tracks obtained display
blastz alignments of the Feb. 2003 mouse draft assembly
to the human genome filters to show only the best
alignment for any given region of the human genome.
The tracks indicate a graphical score of the alignment.
These alignments were contributed by Scott Schwartz
from the Penn State Bioinformatics Group. The best in
genome filtering is done by UCSC’s axtBest program.
The methods and the filter implementation were
described in detail [36].
Tissue preparation

Adult 3- month- old male mice (C57BL/6) were deeply
anesthetized with 2 ml Forene® airway application for 5
min according to the instructions. Then the mice were
decapitated and tissues were quickly frozen in liquid
nitrogen. All animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines of the German law for the
welfare of animals.
Human eyes were obtained from a female patient who
died at an age of 93 years of colon cancer. Her relatives
agreed to the organ donation after death and the dissection was performed in compliance with the Helsinki
declaration.
Tissues from a human eye were prepared after 16 h
from a post-mortem biopsy cooled at 4°C. Retina, lens,
iris diaphragm and optical nerve stump was prepared
and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen or Tissue Tek®.

Northern blot analysis

Total RNA from the different mouse and human tissues
was prepared with TRIzol®-reagent (GibcoBRL) according
to the manufacturer. RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed
and transferred to HybondN nylon membrane (Amersham International, Amersham, Bucks, UK) by capillary
diffusion in 20 × SSC [37]. Northern membrane was
probed by using corresponding hybridization fragments
of mouse Cx36, mouse Cx45 [38] and human Cx59
(1.5 kb) as well as human Cx62 (1.6 kb) genomic DNA
(this study). Subsequently, the amounts of total RNA on
the Northern blot were standardized by hybridization of
to a probe of glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) [39]. Probes were 32P-labelled, using the random primed labelling method (Amersham, Amersham,
Bucks, UK) to a specific activity of 0.5 to 1.0 × 109 cpm/
μg DNA and added to fresh QuikHyb® hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 1.4 × 106 cpm/ml.
Hybridization at high stringency was carried out for 1 h
at 68°C. The filters were finally washed for 30 min in 0.1
× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60°C and exposed to XAR X-ray film
(Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) with intensifying
screen at -70°C for three weeks. The amounts of total
RNA on the Northern blot were roughly standardized by
determination of the intensities of the ethidium bromide
stained 18S- and 28S rRNA.
RT-PCR analysis

Reverse transcription of total RNA from mouse and
human tissues was performed according to [40]. Aliquots of the transcribed cDNA (1/25 from tissue and
cells [approximately 0.1 ng]) were amplified using corresponding primer combinations listed in Table 1. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.4), 250 μM dNTPs, 1.25 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM KCl, 2
μM of each primer and 1 unit Taq DNA-polymerase
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PCR was carried
out for 40 cycles using a PTC-200 Thermal Cycler (MJ
Research, Watertown, MA, USA) with the following
program: first denaturing step at 94°C for 3 min, denaturing at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min,
elongation at 72°C for 2 min and final elongation for
7 min. After gel electrophoresis in an 1% agarose gel the
ethidium bromide stained fragments were documented
in [37]. Fragments of interest were excised from the gel,
purified by using the QiaQuick® purification procedure
for PCR-fragments (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
finally subcloned into the pGEM-T easy ® vector system
suited for cloning PCR-fragments (Promega) which were
commercially sequenced by AGOWA, Berlin, Germany.
Immunofluorescence analysis

Cryosections (12 μm) of retinae and control tissues from
the human eye were fixed in absolute ethanol (-20°C)

for 10 min, washed in PBS for 5 min and preincubated
for 30 min in blocking reagent (PBS containing 4% BSA
and 0.1% Triton X-100). For detection of Cx36 and
Cx45, slides were incubated for 1 hour with appropriate
dillutions of affinity purified connexin antibodies: polyclonal rabbit-anti mouse Cx36 [Zymed 36-4600; lot-no.
30979684-0905] and polyclonal goat-anti mouse Cx45
[Chemicon AB1748; lot-no. 19070139]. After 3 washes
in PBS, samples were stained for 1 hour with the corresponding Cy3- or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies: Cy3-goat anti-rabbit IgG [Dianova; lot-no.
111-165-114] and Alexa488-donkey anti-goat [MoBiTec;
lot-no. A-11055]. As negative control, specimen was
incubated in blocking solution only. After incubation,
slides were washed in PBS and incubated with DAPI
(1:1000) in PBS for 5 min. After a short wash step in
demineralized water, slides were mounted with Permaflour. Fluorescence signals were recorded by using either
a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with a 63×
objective and appropriate filters or a Leica TCS confocal
microscope. Images were analyzed and prepared for
publication by using Adobe Photoshop 6.0.
The above mentioned antibodies against Cx36 and
Cx45 proteins have been applied to cyosections of Cx36
and Cx45 wild type versus knock-out mice [25,31]. The
punctated immunofluorescence staining pattern typical
for connexin proteins was not detectable in retinal sections of the corresponding knock-out mice, whereas the
large and bright dots remained and thus were regarded
as unspecific staining artifacts.

Results
Phylogenetic relationship between mCx57 (Gja10), hCx59
(GJA9) and hCx62 (GJA10)

Deduced from comparisons of connexin gene pairs,
human Cx62 (GJA10) is most likely the orthologuous
connexin gene to mouse Cx57 (Gja10) (82% nucleotide
identity; 78% amino acid identity; see [20]. A direct
comparison between mouse Cx57 (Gja10) and human
Cx59 (GJA9) instead yielded much lower sequence identities, suggesting that the Cx59 (GJA9) gene has no
mouse ortholog. Results from a phylogenetic alignment,
however, indicated that hCx59 (GJA9) might belong to a
group of connexin open reading frames (ORFs) of relatively high molecular weight having its closest sequence
relationship to zebrafish Cx55.5, with which it was
tightly clustered. Both connexin genes are further
aligned to a subgroup containing mCx57 (Gja10), porcine Cx60 [55] and hCx62 (GJA10) (dendrogram in
Figure 1; accession numbers in Methods).
Closer examination unraveled sequence peculiarities
between mCx57 (Gja10), hCx59 (GJA9) and hCx62
(GJA10). A schematic drawing in figure 1 illustrates an
uninterrupted sequence of high similarity (yellow) between
mCx57 (Gja10) and hCx62 (GJA10) that underscores their
direct phylogenetic relationship. Most interestingly, some
“islets” of similarity between mCx57 (Gja10) and hCx59
(GJA9) (green and red) indicate also their at least partial
relationship. In detail: a mouse sequence of about 2479 bp
on Chr. 4 position contig. [from 32.418.233 to
32.420.711]was readily aligned with 75.8% sequence

identity to a human sequence of about 2529 bp on Chr. 6
position contig. [from 90.553.469 to 90.555.997]. However, an internal segment of 799 bp in that mouse
sequence also aligned with 65.4% sequence identity to a
human sequence of 810 bp on Chr. 1 position contig.
[from 38.804.554 to 38.805.363]. Moreover, a small
sequence of 198 bp approx. 90 Mb upstream of the mentioned mouse sequence Chr. 4 position contig. [from
121.921.142 to 121.921.339]was aligned with 68.5%
sequence identity to a human sequence of 235 bp Chr. 1
position contig. [38.804.122 to 38.804.356],that is
located adjacent to the 810 bp sequence. The Ensembl
gene report of human Cx59 (Gene ID: ENSG000
00131233) predicts its reading frame on Chr. 1 position
contig. [38.803.761 to 38.805.308]comprising 1548 bp or
515 aa’s. As a rough estimation, about 1186 bp coding for
395 amino acid residues aa’s (~55%) of the predicted
hCx59 N-terminal coding region can be regarded as similar to mouse Cx57 (Gja10).
Sequence similarities between mCx57 and hCx62
transcript isoforms

In a previous study, the C-terminal end of mCx57 (12aa)
was demonstrated to be encoded on a putative third
exon approx. 9 kb further downstream of the major
coding region (480 amino acid residues) that is functionally spliced after transcription [30]. RT-PCR primer
combinations between upstream primer (USP) 1 to 4
and downstream primer (DSP) 1 to 2 confirmed the
uninterrupted transcription of the major part of the

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree deduced from a multiple protein sequence alignment revealed the phylogenetical relationship of mouse
Cx57, porcine Cx60 and human Cx62. Instead, human Cx59 (GJA9) seems much more related to both zebrafish connexins Cx55.5 and Cx52.6.
Hypothetical shuffling of genomic fragments could occur between mCx57, hCx59 and hCx62. Human-mouse alignments with BLASTZ indicate
that human Cx62 (GJA10) (Chr. 6) might be the orthologuous connexin gene to mouse Cx57 (Gja10) (Chr. 4). N; N-terminus, C*; C-terminus

mCx57 coding region on exon2 (data not shown). However, after application of downstream primer DSP3, -4,
-5 and -6, the corresponding RT-PCR amplicons failed
to emerge in each case (data not shown), thus indicating
that neither the C-terminus (25 amino acid residues) is
encoded on exon2 (as predicted by [41]), nor that the
hypothetical transcript isoforms, deduced from data
base predictions, are transcribed in figure 2. Only downstream primer DSP7 yielded an amplicon that was
cloned and sequenced [30]. The position of primer
DSP7 further downstream of a fourth predicted small
reading frame and splice acceptor site concomitantly
excluded their usage but instead confirmed the transcription of a small reading frame (36 nucleotides; 12
amino acid residues) and its upstream located splice
acceptor site (figure 2).
In order to access the splice pattern of hCx62 transcript isoforms, results obtained from the Gja10 gene
structure coding for mCx57 have been extrapolated to
the GJA10 gene coding for hCx62. Although a bio-

Page 5 of 11

informatical sequences analyses predicted an uninterrupted hCx62 reading frame of about 1629 base pairs
(543 amino acid residues) on exon2, a putative splice
donor-site, similar to that of mCx57 (figure 2) was
found in the C-terminal part of the hCx62 reading
frame, thus implying that 63 amino acid residues of the
following downstream sequence might remain untranslated. Moreover, a second putative splice-donor site was
found upstream only in the hCx62 reading frame but
not in the hCx59 and zebrafish Cx55.5 coding region.
An alignment of the small mCx57 exon3 sequence to
the human genomic sequence of hCx62 resulted in a
nearly perfect match approx. 25 kb further downstream
of hCx62 exon2. At this position, the same 12 amino
acid residues [NMLLELSSIMKK] expressed in mCx57
are encoded, coinciding with a proper splice acceptor
site (figure 2). Therefore, different primer combinations
for RT-PCR analyses have been selected for detection of
putatively unspliced hCx62 transcript isoforms (USP1 to
3 applied with DSP1 or DSP2) or putatively spliced

boxes represent the coding region of hCx62 which is linked by the roof-like black line. The first exon contains 1440 nucleotides coding for 480
amino acid residues and the second exon comprises at least the 36 nucleotides coding for the C-terminal amino acid residues. Both exons are

hCx62 transcript isoforms (USP1 to 3 applied with
DSP3 or DSP4; see table 1 and figure 2).
RT-PCR analyses revealed the presence of hCx62 as
well as hCx59 transcripts only in cDNA from human
retina RNA but not in cDNA from human lens, iris diaphragm, and nerve stump RNA (figure 3). In human retinal cDNA, the unspliced form and the spliced hCx62
transcript isoform, containing exon3 approx. 25 kb
downstream of exon2, were detected. However, no
amplicon corresponding to the expression of a putative
hCx62 transcript isoform containing a third exon about
32 kb downstream of exon 2 (figure 3) was found. A
very weak amplicon reflecting hCx59 (GJA9) expression
in human lens cDNA is likely due to RNA contamination during tissue preparation (figure 3).
Thus, selective RT-PCR reactions were repeated after
digestion of total RNA from human retina with DNAse
I, in order to exclude even residual traces of genomic
DNA (see in figure 4). Interestingly, only primer combinations USP1-DSP1 generated a short amplicon of
hCx62 exon2 and primer combination USP1-DSP3 confirmed again the presence of the spliced hCx62 isoform

Page 6 of 11

containing exon2 and 3. Amplification of the extended
exon2 (primer USP1-DSP2), however, failed after
DNAse I digestion (figure 4), suggesting the previous
amplification product (figure 3) was likely due to contamination with genomic DNA. Thus, expression of the
hCx62 as an uninterrupted coding region on exon2
(also including 63 amino acid residues downstream of
the splice donor site) in human retinal cDNA could not
be confirmed. Expression of human Cx59, however, was
still detected after DNAse I digestion and application of
two different primer combinations (USP1-DSP2 and
USP2-DSP1), underscored that hCx59 is transcribed, at
least in traces, in human retina.
Abundance of connexin transcription in the human retina

Among the different connexins shown to be transcribed
and translated in the mouse and rat retina are Cx36,
Cx43, Cx45 and Cx57 [25,30,31]. Several studies indicate
that mCx43 is functionally expressed in retinal astrocytes [31], while mCx36, mCx45 and mCx57 protein
establish functional gap junction channels between various neuronal subclasses of the mouse [5]. Here we have

Figure 3 RT-PCR analyses of hCx59 and hCx62 RNAs in different tissues of the human eye. Both the hCx62-specific primer combination
USP2 - DSP2 (within the first exon) and the primer combination USP2 - DSP3 (intron spanning) yielded amplicons of about 1.3 kb and 1.1 kb,
respectively, only with cDNA from retina. The intron-spanning primer combination USP2-DSP4 even failed to yield a signal with retina cDNA. The
amplicon of 550 bp implies that hCx59 seemed to be expressed in retina and also very faintly in lens.

detected even after three weeks of exposure, whereas rehybridization to a probe coding for the human glyceraldehydephosphate
dehydrogenase [GAPDH] [39] led to a specific hybridization signal of about 1.4 kb. Hybridization signals for hCx62 were detected in retina and
the optical nerve, whereas hybridization signals specific for hCx45 were seen also in retina and the iris diaphragm after two weeks of exposure.

human genomic DNA. No signals after beta-actin RT-PCR and the empty water control indicate the absence of genomic DNA from the probes.

neuronal mouse connexin genes are also expressed in
human retina. Hybridization signals of appropriate sizes
for hCx36, hCx45, hCx62, but not for hCx59 transcripts
could be readily detected after Northern blot hybridization of human retina RNA (figure 4). Additionally, a signal for hCx36 emerged in the RNA sample extracted
from human optical nerve and a signal for hCx45 was
seen in iris diaphragm (figure 4). Even after longer x-ray
exposure time no hybridization signal indicating expression of hCx59 could be detected. Furthermore, none of
the four connexins tested was found to be expressed in
human lens RNA.
Immunofluorescence analyses of hCx36 and hCx45
protein expression in the human retina

Due to high protein sequence identities between mouse
Cx36 and Cx45 protein and their human counterparts
(both at about 98%; [20]), we used antibodies directed

against mouse Cx36 and Cx45 protein on cryosections of
the human retina. After application of antibodies to
Cx36, a punctated staining pattern in the inner plexiform
layer (IPL) and to some lower extent in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was detected (figure 5A). Due to the
limited quality of the post-mortem human retinal tissue
it was not possible to analyze the sublaminar distribution
of Cx36-specific signals in both plexiform layers. The
staining pattern obtained after application of antibodies
to Cx45 was less intense in the inner plexiform layer
(IPL) but more prominent in the outer plexiform layer
(OPL) (figure 5C). These also punctate signals were smaller and more faint, at least in the IPL, compared to the
corresponding Cx36-immuno signals (figure 5A). At first
glance, the overall abundance and distribution of the
punctate immunopositive staining patterns representing
Cx36 and Cx45 protein in the human retina are reminiscent to the corresponding immunofluorescence signals
detected in the mouse retina [25,28].

Figure 5 Immunofluorescence study of Cx36 and Cx45 expression in the human retina. A) An array of red Cx36-immunosignals was
detected in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) extending to the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and also in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). B) Retinal
cryosections after application of only the secondary Cy3-antibodies served as control for the specificity of the Cx36 antibodies used. C) The Cx45
immunostaining (green) was very faint and the punctate pattern was prominently seen in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) but less obvious in the
IPL and GCL. D) Retinal cryosections after application of only the secondary Alexa488-antibodies served as control for the specificity of the Cx36antibodies used. All nuclei were stained blue with DAPI. Unusual large staining signals, exemplarily marked by asterisks, were considered as
unspecific staining (see Methods). Scale bar: 20 μm.

Conclusion
In former years research on gap junction mediated signal transmission and its modulation in the mammalian
retina focused on three aspects: (i) Coupling of photoreceptor cells and the improvement of signal-to-noise
ratio under various light conditions. (ii) Horizontal cell
coupling with respect to lateral inhibition and (iii) AIION-cone bipolar cell coupling transferring rod-mediated
signals into the cone pathway under mesopic light conditions [42,43].
Most experiments were done in lower vertebrates like
fish, frog, turtle or mudpuppy [6,31] but also results
from higher vertebrates like cat, rabbit, mouse and rat
contributed to the identification of either homologuous
or heterologuous gap junction coupling between various
retinal neurons [16,23,44].

In the recent years, research was focused on gap junction-mediated coupling between retinal neurons in mice,
since the targeted deletion of connexin coding sequences
after replacement with an appropriate reporter gene did
not only help to unequivocally confirm cell-type specific
expression of a distinct connexin in the mouse retina but
also the physiological consequences after loss of this connexin [45]. Independent deletion of both the Cx36 coding
region [28] and the Cx45 coding region [26] resulted in a
reduction of the b-wave, thus implying that electrical
synapses occurring between AII-amacrine and ON-cone
bipolar cells are assembled by connexons heterotypically
composed of Cx36 and Cx45 [5].
However, much less is known concerning the identity
and distribution of connexin genes in the primate retina.
It was shown that neighboring red and green cones in

Söhl et al. BMC Ophthalmology 2010, 10:27
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2415/10/27

retinae of macaque monkeys are homogenously as well
as heterogenously coupled by non rectifying gap junctions. Apart from these, blue cones seem to be electrically isolated, although they are homogenously coupled
[32]. This indiscriminate coupling might cause a modest
decrease in color discrimination that likely leads to the
benefit of an increased luminance detection. Using a
measured average junctional conductance of 650 pS, the
authors further estimated 43 hypothetically open Cx36channels per cone-cone junction assuming that the single-channel conductance of Cx36 does not exceed 15pS
[32]. Until now it is not clear, if the same connexins
that have been identified in the mouse retina are also
expressed in the human or at least primate retina.
Therefore, we have started to investigate expression of
those connexin genes known to be expressed in mouse
retina in human retina. Human connexin36 transcripts
were detected in total RNA prepared from human retina
and the optical nerve after Northern blot hybridization.
Furthermore, after application of Cx36-specific antibodies [25], Cx36 immunoreactivity was found from the
inner plexiform layer (IPL) up to the ganglion cell layer
(GCL) and also separately in the outer plexiform layer
(OPL). Despite the limited quality of the post-mortem
human retinal tissue, the staining pattern is partially
reminiscent to that one detected in mouse retina,
although intensity and the belt-like array pattern of
punctate signals were different [25]. It seems likely that
hCx36 protein mainly occurs in the IPL, similar to
rodent nocturnal species [22]. A better quality of human
retinal biopsy is needed to address the following question in further studies: Is there any accumulation of
Cx36 protein in the inner part (ON sublamina) of the
IPL, which participates in the rod pathway [46], the specialized circuit for night (scotopic) vision or in the outer
part (OFF sublamina), like in the chick cone-dominated
retina [47], that might suggests the independence of
phylogenetic proximity and functional micro-wiring in
retinal circuits.
Human Cx45 transcripts instead were identified in
total human RNA from retina and iris diaphragm but
not, as expected, in lens and optical nerve after Northern blot hybridization. Immunofluorescence analyses
using Cx45-specific antibodies [25] yielded large and
clear punctate signals in the OPL that were hardly
detectable in the IPL and GCL. This is different from
results observed in both rodent [25,31,56] and avian
retina [48], where Cx45 was detected in different cell
types, but mainly in the inner retina (IPL and GCL). In
future studies a better morphological quality of postmortem human retinal tissue might not only allow to
verify these results but also to characterize, in combination with cell-type specific markers, the cellular distribution of hCx36 and hCx45 and other gap junction

proteins, such as hCx43 [49] and pannexins [50] in the
human retina.
Cx59 (GJA9) is restricted to human, since no orthologous connexin gene was found in the mouse genome
[20]. A closer examination revealed the strongest phylogenetic relation to zebrafish Cx55.5 and a weaker relation
to a group of connexins including mouse Cx57 (Gja10),
porcine Cx60 and human Cx62 (GJA10). Sequence analysis of the chromosomal loci indicated that the mouse
Cx57 gene (Gja10) on chromosome 4 and its surrounding
is in perfect synteny to the human Cx62 gene (GJA10) on
chromosome 6 coinciding with the high amino acid
sequence identity (78%) of both genes [51]. Although
partial sequences of mCx57 (Gja10) and hCx59 (GJA9)
also represent relatively high sequence identities, their
chromosomal location on human chromosome 1 and
mouse chromosome 4 show no synteny. We therefore
hypothesize that hCx59 (GJA9) might either be generated
in the human genome by a gene duplication [52] and
shuffling of genomic fragments related to hCx62 (GJA10)
or that the orthologuous counterpart of hCx59 (GJA9)
may have been lost through chromosomal breakage in
the mouse genome. Most interestingly, transcription of
hCx59 could only be detected in RNA from human testes
after Northern blot hybridization [51], whereas RT-PCR
amplicons confirmed at least weak expression of hCx59
in human retina.
Human connexin62 (GJA10) is apparently the true
ortholog to mouse Cx57 (Gja10), since the genomes of
both species have been completely sequenced and no
other orthologuous gene pair shows higher sequence
similarity [51]. Therefore it was interesting to explore if
both connexin genes also share similar gene structures.
We aligned the short coding sequence of mouse connexion57 exon 3 [30] to the genomic fragment containing
the human connexin62 gene (GJA10) and identified the
same 12 amino acid residues coding for mouse exon3.
Although the intron between exon 2 and exon 3 of
human Cx62 is about 25 kb long and thus much more
extended than the corresponding intron (4 kb) of mouse
connexin57 [30], it is functionally spliced in human
retina. Additionally, transcription of the human Cx62
gene (GJA10) could also be detected after Northern blot
hybridization only in human retina. Regarding the corresponding gene structure and the retina-restricted transcription, it is tempting to speculate that human Cx62
(GJA10) may be expressed in human horizontal cells
similar to the expression of mouse connexin57 (Gja10) in
mouse horizontal cells [30]. Expression of Cx57 could
also be demonstrated in A-type horizontal cells of the
rabbit retina [53]. Therefore, human Cx62 protein may
contribute to connexin hemichannels at the tips of horizontal cell dendrites, which have been suggested to

mediate negative feedback from human horizontal cells
to cones [54].
In further investigations, the characterization of specific antibodies directed against human Cx59 and Cx62
proteins would help to clarify their cell-type specific
expression.
