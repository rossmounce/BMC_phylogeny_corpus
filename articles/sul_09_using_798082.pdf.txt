Abstract
Background: Evolutionary trees are family trees that represent the relationships between a group
of organisms. Phylogenetic heuristics are used to search stochastically for the best-scoring trees in
tree space. Given that better tree scores are believed to be better approximations of the true
phylogeny, traditional evaluation techniques have used tree scores to determine the heuristics that
find the best scores in the fastest time. We develop new techniques to evaluate phylogenetic
heuristics based on both tree scores and topologies to compare Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3, two
popular Maximum Parsimony search algorithms.
Results: Our results show that although Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 find the trees with the same
best scores, topologically these trees are quite different. Furthermore, the Rec-I-DCM3 trees
cluster distinctly from the Pauprat trees. In addition to our heatmap visualizations of using
parsimony scores and the Robinson-Foulds distance to compare best-scoring trees found by the
two heuristics, we also develop entropy-based methods to show the diversity of the trees found.
Overall, Pauprat identifies more diverse trees than Rec-I-DCM3.
Conclusion: Overall, our work shows that there is value to comparing heuristics beyond the
parsimony scores that they find. Pauprat is a slower heuristic than Rec-I-DCM3. However, our
work shows that there is tremendous value in using Pauprat to reconstruct trees—especially since
it finds identical scoring but topologically distinct trees. Hence, instead of discounting Pauprat,
effort should go in improving its implementation. Ultimately, improved performance measures lead
to better phylogenetic heuristics and will result in better approximations of the true evolutionary
history of the organisms of interest.

Background
Phylogenetics is concerned with inferring the genealogical
relationships between a group of organisms (or taxa).
These evolutionary relationships are typically depicted in
a binary tree, where leaves represent the organisms of
interest and edges represent the evolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic trees have been used successfully in

designing more effective drugs, tracing the transmission of
deadly viruses, and guiding conservation and biodiversity
efforts [1,2]. The grand challenge problem in phylogenetics is reconstructing the Tree of Life, the evolutionary history of the 10 to 100 million estimated organisms on
earth. However, inferring evolutionary trees is not a trivial
task. Since the true evolutionary history for a set of

organisms is unknown, the problem is often reformulated
as an NP-hard optimization problem. Trees are given a
score, where trees with better scores are believed to be better approximations of the true evolutionary history. For n
taxa, there are an exponential number of evolutionary
hypotheses: (2n - 3)!! possible solutions to be exact. As a
result, an exhaustive exploration of the space of possible
solutions (or "tree space") is infeasible. Thus, the most
popular techniques in the field use heuristics to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
In this paper, we develop new techniques to compare the
performance of phylogenetic heuristics. While phylogenetic heuristics are used to search stochastically for the
best trees in tree space, their results often vary across each
run of the heuristic. As a result, it is difficult to compare
performance among heuristics that produce different
solutions. Our work evaluates phylogenetic heuristics
based on both the score and topology of the trees found.
More specifically, our work centers around the following
two questions.
1. What value (if any) do slower heuristics provide?
2. How effective are parsimony scores in distinguishing
between different tree topologies?
Traditional techniques for comparing phylogenetic heuristics use convergence plots to show how the best score
improves over time, as best scores are thought to symbolize more accurate trees. Under this measure, the heuristic
that obtains the best score in the fastest time is desired.
Given that different tree topologies may have identical
tree scores, preference of good-scoring trees found by fast
heuristics may result in overlooking potentially more
accurate evolutionary histories that were found by slower
approaches.

We consider the performance of two well-known Maximum Parsimony (MP) search heuristics, Parsimony
Ratchet [3] and Recursive-Iterative DCM3 (Rec-I-DCM3)
[4] on four molecular datasets of 60, 174, 500 and 567
taxa. The parsimony ratchet algorithm used in this paper
is called Pauprat since we used a Perl script by BinindaEmonds [5] to generate a PAUP* [6] batch file to run the
parsimony ratchet heuristic. Our first observation is that
there are benefits to considering different speed heuristic
implementations of a MP phylogenetic analysis. In general, Pauprat is a slower heuristic than Rec-I-DCM3. Since
we were curious of the merits of a heuristic, time constraints were removed from consideration in this study.
However, both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 find different
trees with the same best parsimony scores. These diverse
best-scoring trees denote that the heuristics are visiting
different areas of the exponentially-sized tree space. We
note that although TNT [7] has a faster implementation of
parsimony ratchet than PAUP*, TNT does not have the
capability to return to the user the set of trees found during each iterative step of the parsimony ratchet algorithm.
The Pauprat implementation of parsimony ratchet provides this capability. Moreover, the Rec-I-DCM3 implementation also provides users with the trees found during
each step of the algorithm.
Secondly, although different trees are found with the
same parsimony score, it's interesting to consider whether
maximum parsimony is effectively distinguishing
between the trees, which has significant implications for
understanding evolution. By using a measure called relative entropy, we show that for a given collection of trees,
parsimony scores have less information content than topological distance measures such as Robinson-Foulds (RF)
distance [8]. In other words, for a collection of trees, parsimony scores identify fewer unique trees—which
increases the potential of being stuck in a local optimum
and producing less accurate phylogenies—than topological distance measures. Thus, more powerful search strate-

The table shows the number of top-scoring trees found by each algorithm. stepi refers to trees that are i steps away from the best score. Hence,
step0 represents the number best-scoring trees, step1 are trees one step away from the best, and step2 are trees with parsimony scores two steps
greater than the best score. Each algorithm found 5,000 total trees. For Pauprat (Rec-I-DCM3), the step0, step1, and step2 trees make up 67.6%
(10.7%) of the 5,000 total trees in the collection for the 60 taxa dataset. For the 567 taxa dataset, the top-scoring trees represent 22.5% and 77.5%
of the 5,000 trees found by Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3, respectively.

gies could be designed by using a combination of score
and topological distance to guide the search into fruitful
areas of the exponentially-sized tree space.

Results and discussion
Frequency of the top-scoring trees
Table 1 shows the number of trees found by the Pauprat
and Rec-I-DCM3 heuristics in terms of the number of
steps they are from the best score, b, we found across the
algorithms. For each dataset, both Pauprat and Rec-IDCM3 find trees with the best score, b. Let x represent the
parsimony score of a tree T . Then, tree T is x - b steps away
from the best score. In Table 1, step0, step1, and step2 represent trees that are 0, 1 and 2 steps away from the best
score, b, respectively. It is clear that the top-scoring trees
from Pauprat comprise a large proportion of the total collection of its 5,000 trees for the smaller datasets (60 and
174 taxa). On the other hand, the top trees for Rec-IDCM3 comprise the majority of its collection of trees for
the larger datasets (500 and 567 taxa).

Topological comparisons of top-scoring trees
Figure 1 shows the topological differences (measured by
the RF rate) between the top-scoring trees found by the
two phylogenetic search heuristics. We use a heatmap representation of the RF matrix, where each value (cell) in the
two-dimensional t × t RF matrix is represented as a color.
Darker (lighter) colors represent smaller (higher) RF rates.
Since the RF matrix is symmetric, our heatmap is symmetric as well. For each heatmap, the right values are x coordinates and the values on the top are y coordinates.
Consider the heatmap that represents the collection of 60
taxa trees. Cell (1, 1) represents the set of step0 trees from
the Pauprat heuristic. Each of the 1,508 step0 trees is compared to each other. Their resulting RF rates are 0%, which
is denoted by a black coloring of the 1,508 × 1,508 block
of cells. Hence, the best scoring trees found by the Pauprat
heuristic are identical. A similar conclusion can be made
concerning the 59 step0 trees found by Rec-I-DCM3 and
denoted by cell (2, 2) in the heatmap. If we look at the
step0 trees from both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3, represented by cells (x, y), where x, y ≤ 2, the entire block of cells
have a RF rate of 0%. Hence, for the 60 taxa dataset, the

heuristics found identical best-scoring trees. For the step2
trees, reflected in cells (3, 3) and (4, 4), there is more variation among the 60 taxa trees. Neither heuristic found
step1 trees. The heatmap also compares trees with different number of steps to the best. For example, cell (1, 4)
compares step0 Pauprat trees with step2 Rec-I-DCM3 trees
and denotes that they have a wider range of topological
differences between them.
Although the best trees are identical in the 60 taxa dataset,
the heatmaps in Figure 1 show that the Pauprat and RecI-DCM3 algorithms find topologically different trees that
have the same parsimony score. Furthermore, as the parsimony score increases, there is more variety in the topological structure of the step1 and step2 trees. The topscoring trees found by Rec-I-DCM3 algorithm are more
similar to each other than their Pauprat counterparts.
Finally, the heatmaps show that Pauprat finds more topologically dissimilar trees than Rec-I-DCM3. Thus, the Rec-

Next, consider the heatmaps in Figure 2 which reflect strict
consensus resolution rates for a collection of t trees. The
heatmaps in this figure are read similarly to those in Figure 1. The difference is the interpretation of the cell (i, j).
For example, on the 60 taxa dataset, cell (1, 1) represents
the strict consensus resolution of the 1,508 step0 trees
from Pauprat. Cell (2, 3) is the strict resolution rate of the
step0 Rec-I-DCM3 trees with step2 Pauprat trees. High resolution rates reflect high similarity among the trees of
interest. Overall, the consensus resolution rate is the highest for the step0 trees. This corroborates the results shown
in Figure 1 that step0 trees are more topologically similar
to each other than higher scoring trees. Furthermore, the
strict resolution rate is greater among Pauprat trees than
its Rec-I-DCM3 counterparts. For both Pauprat and Rec-IDCM3, the majority resolution of comparing the top trees
always resulted in a rate greater than 90% (see Figure 3).

Comparing the majority resolution rates of the top-scoring trees
Comparing the majority resolution rates of the top-scoring trees. Each 6 × 6 heatmap represents the strict resolution rate between the step0, step1, and step2 trees found by the Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 heuristics.
There is little variation among the stepi trees when computing the majority tree. In fact, the results indicate that
all of the top-scoring trees could be used to create the
majority consensus tree with minimal impact on the consensus resolution rate. While it could be argued that the
heatmaps in Figure 1 and Figure 2 essentially agree, Figure
1 gives greater insight into the differences found by individual trees. The consensus heatmaps, in contrast, summarize the information, and give a "bird's eye" view of
bipartition sharing between trees found between the two
approaches. By evaluating both types of heatmaps, the
reader can fully appreciate the intricate similarities and
differences of the two heuristics at hand, while still keeping sight of the overall picture.

simony score are distinct topologically. Now, we broaden
our analysis to incorporate all trees found by a heuristic
over a defined time period. Here, time is measured by the
number of iterations (which is CPU time independent)
and not on wall-clock time (e.g., number of hours
required). Although number of iterations is an architecture-independent measure, it may not be completely adequate as each algorithm may do more work than the other
per iteration. We are comparing heuristics based on their
input/output behavior, which is the collection of trees
returned after 5 runs of a heuristic, where each run consists of 1,000 iterations. Thus, we believe that using iterations as a basis of time is adequate for the purposes of this
paper.

Comparisons over time
Next, we focus on the performance of Pauprat and Rec-IDCM3 in terms of time using all of the trees returned by
each search heuristic. The purpose of this experiment is to
determine the information content of parsimony scores
and RF rates among the set of trees found by the heuristics.
Previous figures have shown that trees with the same par-

Figures 4 and 5 use relative entropy as a measure for uniformly quantifying the information content of parsimony
scores and RF rates. Relative entropy is shown as a percentage of the maximum possible entropy. Higher relative
entropy means that there is more diversity (heterogeneity)
among the values of interest, and hence higher information content. Lower relative entropy values denote homoPage 5 of 9

geneous values and lower information content. One
implication of low entropy values is that the search has
reached a local optimum. Higher entropy values signify
that more diverse trees are found by a phylogenetic heuristic, which lessen its probability of being trapped in local
optima.
In Figure 4, Pauprat has a higher relative entropy than RecI-DCM3 when comparing parsimony scores and RF distances for the 174 and 500 taxa datasets. That is, Pauprat
trees have a more diverse range of parsimony scores and
RF values than Rec-I-DCM3 trees. For the 60 taxa curves,
Rec-I-DCM3 has a much higher relative entropy than Pauprat. Moreover, for Rec-I-DCM3, parsimony score entropy
values are much higher than RF rate values for 60 taxa.
Such a result implies that the parsimony scores of trees are

more diverse than their topologies. In other words, trees
with different scores when compared topologically are
similar. For Pauprat, the relative entropy values vary more
than for Rec-I-DCM3, which has relative entropy values
that are fairly constant across iterations. Essentially, such
behavior denotes that the Rec-I-DCM3 search has converged as there is not much change in the parsimony or RF
rates among the trees found.

Conclusion
In this paper, we used novel methods to assess the quality
of two maximum parsimony heuristics, Pauprat and RecI-DCM3. The goal of this work was to both ascertain the
value of slower heuristics and determine if parsimony
score is effective in distinguishing between different tree
topologies. We designed a new entropy-based measure,

or RNA. These sequences are put into a multiple alignment, so that they all have the same length. Maximum
parsimony then seeks a tree, along with inferred ancestral
sequences, so as to minimize the total number of evolutionary events by counting only point mutations.

Our results show that parsimony score masks tree diversity in large populations of equally parsimonious trees. By
using relative entropy, there is more information content
in topological distance measures (such as the RF distance)
than in parsimony scores. Furthermore, when considering
three groups of top-scoring (step0, step1, and step2) trees,
there is a wide-range of topological differences among
these trees. In some cases, by using our relative entropy
measure, parsimony scores are more diverse than the tree
topologies found. This suggests that our topology-based
methods may be more reliable in quantifying fine-grain
differences between different heuristics, especially in
larger datasets.

Parsimony ratchet
Parsimony ratchet is a particular kind of phylogenetic
search performed with alternating cycles of reweighting
and Tree Bisection Recombination (TBR). The approach
works as follows: starting with an initial tree, a few of the
characters (between 5 – 25%) are sampled, and
reweighted. It suffices to say here that reweighting of characters involves duplicating the characters so that each
shows up twice (or more) in the resulting dataset. Then,
using these reweighted characters, TBR search is performed until a new starting tree is reached using this subset of data. This new starting tree is then used with the
original data set to repeat the phylogenetic search. Parsimony ratchet tries to refine the search by generating a tree
from a small subset of the data and using it as a new starting point. If the new tree is better than the old one, then
the new one is used as the new starting tree. Otherwise,
the old one is kept.

Our experiments with the two heuristics, show that Pauprat searches through tree space more slowly than Rec-IDCM3. However, both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 find
trees with the best score. Pauprat's trees tended to be more
diverse, especially on larger datasets. Pauprat's diverse collection of trees suggests its ability to escape local optima.
Given that both heuristics find different classes of equally
parsimonious trees, they are both useful in reconstructing
phylogenies. Typical performance studies based on convergence speed of phylogenetic heuristics to the best score
would discount heuristics that had a slower convergence
rate. While speed is certainly important, ultimately the
goal of phylogenetics is to obtain an accurate evolutionary
tree for a group of taxa. Given that accuracy is typically
based on a score given to a tree, we would like to be able
to obtain all best-scoring trees. For the datasets studied
here, our results show that both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3
are necessary to obtain a diverse collection of best-scoring
trees. Depending on the value of these different hypotheses, our study shows that it may be worthy to improve an
implementation of slower algorithms if they search a different aspect of tree space than their counterparts. In the
future, we plan to create additional metrics for ascertaining levels of diversity in populations of trees. This work
will also be extended to include maximum likelihood
heuristics. Finally, we plan to use our results to develop
new heuristics that improve the accuracy of reconstructing
evolutionary trees.

Rec-I-DCM3
Recursive-Iteration DCM3 (Rec-I-DCM3) [4] implements
a disk-covering method (DCM) [9-11] to improve the
score of the trees it finds. A DCM is a divide-and-conquer
technique that consists of four stages: divide, solve, merge,
and refine. At a high level, these stages follow directly
from DCM being a divide-and-conquer technique.

Rec-I-DCM3, involves all of the above DCM stages, but in
addition, is both recursive and iterative. The recursive part
concerns the divide stage of the DCM, where overlapping
subsets of the input tree's leaf nodes may be further
divided into yet smaller subsets (or subproblems). This is
an important enhancement to the DCM approach since
for very large datasets, the subproblems remain too large
for an immediate solution. Thanks to the recursion, the
subproblems are eventually small enough to be solved
directly using some chosen base method. At this point,
Rec-I-DCM3 uses strict consensus merger to do the work
of recombining the overlapping subtrees to form a single
tree solution. The iterative part of Rec-I-DCM3 refers to
the repetition of the entire process just described. That is,
the resulting tree solution becomes the input tree for a
subsequent iteration of Rec-I-DCM3.

Methods
Maximum parsimony heuristics
We study heuristics that use the maximum parsimony
(MP) optimization criterion for inferring the evolutionary
history between a collection of taxa. Each of the taxa in the
input is represented by a molecular sequence such as DNA

Comparing collections of trees
RF distance matrix
Given a collection of t evolutionary trees, we would like to
quantify the topological differences that exist between
them. We compute the t × t Robinson-Foulds (RF) matrix,

Page 7 of 9

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 4):S3

which represents the dissimilarity between each pair of
trees. Cell (i, j) in the t × t RF matrix represents the RF distance between the two trees labeled Ti and Tj. The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance computes the number of
bipartitions (or evolutionary relationships) that differ
between them. A bipartition is an internal edge e of a phylogenetic tree that separates the taxa on one side from the
taxa on the other. The division of the taxa into two subsets
is the bipartition Bi associated with edge ei. Let Σ (T) be the
set of bipartitions defined by all edges in tree T . The RF
distance between trees T1 and T2 is defined as

d RF (T1 , T2 ) =

|Σ(T1)− Σ(T2 )|+|Σ(T2 )− Σ(T1)|
.
2

Our figures plot the RF rate, which is obtained by normalizing the RF distance by the number of internal edges and
multiplying by 100. Assuming n is the number of taxa,
there are n - 3 internal edges in a binary tree. Hence the
maximum RF distance between two trees is n - 3, which
results in an RF rate of 100%. The RF rate allows us to
compare topological differences when the number of taxa
is different. Thus, the RF rate varies between 0% and 100%
signify that trees T1 and T2 are identical and maximally different, respectively.
Relative entropy
Entropy represents the amount of chaos in the system. We
use entropy to quantitatively capture the distribution of
parsimony scores and RF rates among the collection of
trees of interest. In our plots, we show relative entropy,
which is a normalization of entropy, to allow the comparison of entropy values across different population sizes.
Relative entropy ranges from 0% to 100%. Higher entropy
values indicated more diversity (heterogeneity) among
the population of trees. Lower entropy values indicate less
diversity (homogeneity) in the population.

Let λ represent the total number of objects (parsimony
scores or RF rates) in the population of trees. For example,
suppose we want to partition a population of 10 trees
based on their parsimony scores. Then, λ = 10. However,
if we are interested in partitioning the 10 trees based on
the upper triangle of the corresponding 10 × 10 RF matrix,
then λ =

10(9)
2

or 45 since the RF matrix is symmetric.

Next, we group the λ objects into P total partitions. Each
partition i contains ni individuals with identical values.
For RF, each individual in partition i will have the same RF
value. An individual in the RF matrix refers to a cell location (p, q).
We can compute the entropy (ET) of the collection of parsimony scores as:

ET = −

∑ p log p ,

where pi = λi . The highest entropy value (Emax) is log λ .
Relative entropy (Erel) is defined as the quotient between
the entropy ET and the maximum entropy Emax and multiplying by 100 to obtain a percentage. Thus,

E rel =

ET
× 100.
E max

Resolution rate
For n taxa, a resolved, unrooted binary tree will have n - 3
bipartitions (or internal edges). Trees with less than n - 3
bipartitions are considered to have unresolved relationships among the n taxa. In general, binary (or 100%
resolved) trees are preferred by life scientists. The resolution rate of a tree is the percentage of bipartitions that are
resolved. One common use of this measure is related to
evaluating consensus trees, which are used to summarize
the information from a set of t trees. The strict consensus
method returns a tree such that the bipartitions of the tree
are only those bipartitions that occur in all of the t trees.
The majority consensus tree incorporates those bipartitions that occur in at least 50% of the t trees of interest.
Highly resolved consensus trees denote that a high degree
of similarity was found among the collection of trees.
Experimental methodology
Datasets
We used the following biological datasets as input to
study the behavior of the maximum parsimony heuristics.

1. A 60 taxa dataset (2,000 sites) of ensign wasps composed of three genes (28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 16S
rRNA, and cytochrome oxidase I (COI)) [12]. The bestknown parsimony score is 8,698, which was established
by both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3.
2. A 174 taxa dataset (1,867 sites) of insects and their close
relatives for the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA
(SSU rRNA) gene (18S). The sequences were manually
aligned according to the secondary structure of the molecule [13]. The best-known parsimony score is 7,440,
which was established by both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3.
3. A set of 500 aligned rbcL DNA sequences (759 parsimony-informative sites) [14] of seed plants. The bestknown parsimony is 16,218, which both Pauprat and RecI-DCM3 found.
4. A set of 567 "three-gene" (rbcL, atpB, and 18s) aligned
DNA sequences (2,153 sites) of angiosperms [15]. The

best-known parsimony score is 44,165, which both Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 found.
Starting trees
All methods used PAUP*'s random sequence addition
module to generate the starting trees. First, the ordering of
the sequences in the dataset is randomized. Afterwards,
the first three taxa are used to create an unrooted binary
tree, T . The fourth taxon is added to the internal edge of
T that results in the best MP score. This process continues
until all taxa are added to the tree. The resulting tree is
then used as the starting tree for a phylogenetic analysis.
Implementation and platform
We set the parameters of the Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3
algorithms according to the recommended settings in the
literature. We use PAUP* [6] to analyze our four datasets
using the parsimony ratchet heuristic. The implementation of the parsimony ratchet was implemented using
PAUP* [6]. For our analysis, we randomly selected 25% of
the sites and doubled their weight; initially, all sites are
equally weighted. On each dataset, we ran 5 independent
runs of the parsimony ratchet, each time running the heuristic for 1,000 iterations. For Rec-I-DCM3, it is recommended that the maximum subproblem size is 50% of the
number of sequences for datasets with 1,000 or less
sequences and 25% of then number of sequences for
larger datasets not containing over 10,000 sequences. We
used the recommended settings established by Roshan et.
al [4] for using TNT as a base method within the Rec-IDCM3 algorithm.

We used the HashRF algorithm [16,17] to compute the RF
distances between trees. Each heuristic was run five times
on each of the biological datasets. All experiments were
run on a Linux Beowulf cluster, which consists of four, 64bit, quad-core processor nodes (16 total CPUs with gigabit-switched interconnects). Each node contains four, 2
GHz AMD Opteron processors and they share 4 GB of
memory. We note that both Rec-I-DCM3 and parsimony
ratchet are sequential algorithms. The parallel computing
environment was used as a way to execute multiple, independent batch runs concurrently.
