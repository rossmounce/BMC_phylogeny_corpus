countries, with description of L. meridensis n. sp.
(Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae)

Abstract
Background: Livestock fascioliasis is a problem throughout Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, mainly in Andean
areas where the disease also appears to affect humans. Transmission patterns and epidemiological scenarios of
liver fluke infection have shown to differ according to the lymnaeid vector snail species involved. These Andean
countries present the vectors Lymnaea cousini, L. bogotensis and L. ubaquensis, unknown in the rest of Latin
America. An exhaustive combined haplotype study of these species is performed by means of DNA sequencing of
the nuclear ribosomal 18S RNA gene, ITS-2 and ITS-1, and mitochondrial DNA cox1 gene.
Results: The conserved 5.8S rDNA sequence corroborated that no pseudogenes are involved in the numerous
non-microsatellite/minisatellite-related indels appearing between the ITS-2 and ITS-1 sequences when comparing
different L. cousini - L. bogotensis populations. Sequence analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction methods
including other lymnaeid vector species show that (i) L. bogotensis is a synonym of L. cousini, (ii) L. ubaquensis is a
synonym of Pseudosuccinea columella, and (iii) populations of L. cousini hitherto known from Venezuelan highlands
indeed belong to a new species for which the name L. meridensis n. sp. is proposed. This new species is described
and a complete phenotypic differentiation provided.
Conclusions: ITS-2, ITS-1 and cox1 prove to be good markers for specimen classification and haplotype
characterisation of these morphologically similar lymnaeids in endemic areas. Analysis of the 18S gene and
phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. cluster in an evolutionary line different
from the one of P. columella, despite their external resemblance. This suggests an evolutionary phenotypic
convergence related to similar environments and which has given rise to frequent specimen misclassification. Body
size and phylogenetic relationships of L. meridensis n. sp. with well-known vectors as Lymnaea cousini and
P. columella, as well as with Galba/Fossaria species, suggest that the new species may participate in disease
transmission to both animals and humans in altitude areas during the yearly window in which temperatures are
higher than the F. hepatica minimum development threshold. The involvement of L. cousini and P. columella in the
transmission and geographical/altitudinal distribution of fascioliasis in these Andean countries is analysed.

Background
The two liver fluke species Fasciola hepatica and
F. gigantica (Trematoda: Fasciolidae) cause fascioliasis, a
highly pathogenic disease which appears to emerge in
many countries of Latin America, Europe, Africa and
Asia at present [1]. This parasitic disease has been
recognised as a very important veterinary problem in
livestock since long ago [2]. Its public health impact at
the human level has, however, only been ascertained
from the 1990s [3-5].
In the two host life cycle of fasciolids, livestock species
play an important reservoir role. Transmission studies
have shown that different species, such as sheep, cattle,
pig and donkey, represent similar infection sources when
considering the infectivity of the metacercarial infective
stage from their respective origins [6,7]. On the contrary,
the specificity of fasciolid species regarding freshwater
snail species of the family Lymnaeidae (Gastropoda) [8],
represents a crucial factor in establishing not only the
geographical distribution of the disease in both animals
and humans, but also prevalences and intensities due to
more or less appropriate ecological characteristics (population dynamics, anthropophilic characteristics, type of
water bodies, etc.) of the different lymnaeid intermediate
host or vector species. That is why different lymnaeid
species appear linked to the different transmission patterns and epidemiological scenarios of this very heterogeneous disease in humans [1,4]. Additionally, both
lymnaeid snails and the larval stages of fasciolids have
been shown to be highly dependent on climatic and
environmental characteristics [9-11]. This explains the
relationships of fascioliasis with climate change effects
recently observed in different areas [12,13].
In the Americas, fascioliasis is only caused by F. hepatica,
due to the absence of lymnaeids of the genus Radix which
act as transmitters of F. gigantica [8]. In South America,
human fascioliasis endemic areas appear mainly related to
high altitude areas of Andean countries, where the transmission of F. hepatica has been shown to be increased
[14]. Two different patterns are included [4]: (i) the Altiplano pattern with transmission throughout the year due
to lymnaeid vectors linked to permanent water bodies [15]
as in the human hyperendemic areas of Bolivia [15,16] and
Peru [17], and (ii) the valley pattern with seasonal transmission due to lymnaeid vectors more linked to temporary
water bodies, including situations as those in Chile [18]
and Peru [19-21].
Human and animal fascioliasis is also known to be a
great problem in northern Andean countries such as Ecuador [22-24], Colombia [25-32] and Venezuela [33,34]. In
all these areas, epidemiological and transmission characteristics should a priori fit the valley pattern. Among the
lymnaeid species acting as vectors of fascioliasis in these

Page 2 of 22

countries, Lymnaea cousini Jousseaume, 1887 is one of the
species mainly involved in the transmission in high altitude areas in Ecuador [24,35], Colombia [25,36] and Venezuela [37,38]. Shell morphology, ecological characteristics
and seasonal population dynamics of this species
[25,39-41] explain why it may be confused, when dealing
with young specimens, with other lymnaeids, mainly vector species of the so-called Galba/Fossaria group [42].
These facts are also related to the different lymnaeid
species having been proposed to be synonyms of L. cousini: L. raphaelis Jousseaume, 1887 described from Azuay,
South of Cuenca, Ecuador; L. selli Preston, 1907 and
L. bogotensis Pilsbry, 1935, both originally described from
Bogota, Colombia; and L. ubaquensis Piaget, 1914 only
known from Laguna Ubaque, Cundinamarca, Colombia
[37,39,43,44].
The problems in specimen classification and species
distinction in the aforementioned vector groups is a good
example of the wide confusion in which the family Lymnaeidae is immersed, due to the large intraspecific variability and the insufficiency of efficient classification
characteristics in shell and morphoanatomy on which to
rely [8]. Fortunately, in recent years, genetic studies by
means of DNA marker sequences have proved to be very
useful in assessing not only the classification of lymneid
snail specimens, but also the validity of the species and
its phylogenetic relationships with other taxa of the
family in the way for a natural systematic and taxonomic
classification of the family. Additionally, these molecular
tools have shown to be appropriate tools to analyse the
fasciolid species/lymnaeid species specificity, by providing deep distinction capacity of populations and geographic strains by combined haplotyping when using
different markers of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) together [45]. Therefore, a worldwide initiative to clarify vector species within
Lymnaeidae by molecular tools was launched in parallel
to multidisciplinary studies to assess human fascioliasis
in the different continents [1]. Markers used so far and
having shown their usefulness at different levels are: (i)
within the rDNA operon, the 18S gene [42,46,47], ITS-2
[8,14,42,48-50] and ITS-1 [14,48,51]; (ii) within the
mtDNA genome, the 16S [50,52,53], and cox1 [42,54].
The purpose of the present study is to characterise the
vector species L. cousini, L. bogotensis and L. ubaquensis
from Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela by means of
DNA sequences of 18S, ITS-2, ITS-1 and cox1, compare
their different populations, reconstruct their phylogenetic
relationships with other close vector species of the family
Lymnaeidae in the Americas, and analyse its geographical
distribution and transmission role regarding human and
animal fascioliasis. The results of the molecular analyses,
made by using specimens of the type localities of each

Latin American lymnaeid species in order to be systematically conclusive, indicate that a new species is present
in Venezuela. For this species the name Lymnaea meridensis n. sp. is proposed and a diagnostic description is
provided.

Methods
Lymnaeid snail materials

The snail specimens studied were from the following
lymnaeid species and geographical origins (Figure 1):
1.- Lymnaea cousini Jousseaume, 1887 from the type
locality of Chanchu-Yacu, Chillogallo, Quito, Ecuador
[55] (0°18’54.9’’ S, 78°34’2.3’’ W - 3,036 m a.s.l.) and
from Laguna Mucubaji, Merida State, Venezuela (8°
47’51.8’’ N, 70°49’32.4’’ W - 3,550 m a.s.l.).
2.- L. bogotensis Pilsbry, 1935 from the type locality
of the savannah of Bogota, Cundinamarca, Colombia
[56] (snails collected in the locality of Zipaquira; 4°
59’46.4’’ N, 74°0’6.6’’ W - 2,567 m a.s.l.); L. selli Preston, 1907 indeed corresponds to the same species
and identical type locality [39].
3.- L. ubaquensis Piaget, 1914 from the type locality
of Laguna de Ubaque, Cundinamarca, Colombia [57]
(4°29’11.3’’ N, 73°56’11.0’’ W - 1,884 m a.s.l.).

4.- Pseudosuccinea columella (Say, 1817) from Rio
Piedras, Puerto Rico (18°23’45.5’’ N, 66°3’24.5’’ W - 9
m a.s.l.), used for comparison purposes; a Caribbean
origin was selected due to the core distribution of
this species in that area [58].
DNA was extracted from more than one specimen of
a given population when this was deemed necessary for
sequence verification. Only snails that appeared free of
helminth infection were used in the molecular analyses.
To reduce further the risk of contamination of DNA
from helminths (which are more likely to be localized in
other tissues), DNA was only isolated from the foot of
each snail.
Molecular techniques
DNA extraction

Snail feet fixed in 70% ethanol were used for DNA
extraction procedures. After dissection under a microscope, half of the foot was suspended in 400 μl of lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, 100
mM NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS) containing
500 μg/ml Proteinase K (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and digested for 2 hr at 55°C with alternate shaking
each 15 min. The procedure steps were performed

according to methods outlined previously [8,42,46].
Total DNA was isolated according to the phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation method [59].
The pellet was dried and resuspended in 30 μl sterile
TE buffer (pH 8.0). This suspension was stored at -20°C
until use.
DNA sequence amplification

DNA sequences were amplified by PCR using 4-6 μl of
genomic DNA for each 50 μl PCR reaction, according to
methods outlined previously [8,14,42,46]. Each one of the
five DNA markers were PCR amplified independently for
each lymnaeid specimen and each PCR product was
sequenced for a bona-fide haplotype characterisation. A
set of 8 conserved oligonucleotide primers was used for
the amplification of five superimposed fragments of the
18S ribosomal RNA gene using specific primers and a
standard protocol [42,47] to amplify specific 18S rDNA
regions. The rDNA spacers ITS-2 and ITS-1 were amplified using primers designed in conserved positions of
5.8S and 28S rRNA genes and 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes
of several eukaryote Metazoa species, respectively
[8,42,51]. A mitochondrial DNA cox1 gene fragment was
amplified using universal primers [60]. Amplifications
were generated in a Mastercycle epgradient (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany), by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C,
30 sec at 50°C and 1 min at 72°C, preceded by 30 sec at
94°C and followed by 7 min at 72°C for ITS-2 and ITS-1,
and by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 90°C, 1 min at 48°C and 1
min at 72°C, preceded by 2.5 min at 94°C and followed
by 10 min at 72°C for cox1. Ten μl of each PCR product
was checked by staining with ethidium bromide on 1%
Nusieve® GTG agarose (FMC) gel electrophoresis, using
the Molecular Weight Marker VI (Boehringer Mannheim) at 0.1 μg DNA/μl as control.
Purification and quantification of PCR products

Primers and nucleotides were removed from PCR products by purification on Wizard™ PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol and resuspended in 50 μl of
10 mM TE buffer (pH 7.6). The final DNA concentration
was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and
280 nm.
DNA sequencing

The sequencing of the entire 18S rRNA gene, the complete rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and, and the fragment of
the mtDNA cox1 gene was performed on both strands by
the dideoxy chain-termination method [61]. It was carried out with the Taq dye-terminator chemistry kit for
ABI 373A and ABI 3700 capillary system (Perkin Elmer,
Foster City, CA, USA), using PCR primers.
Pseudogene absence verification

To assure that no pseudogenes were involved in the
sequences of the intergenic region of the different lymnaeid populations analysed, the 5.8S rRNA gene was

Page 4 of 22

amplified independently using primers designed in
conserved regions of the 18S and ITS-2 rDNA of several
lymnaeid species [8,42,51,62]. To further assure accurateness of the sequences obtained in the way to discriminate
between lymnaeid populations, additional amplifications
were carried out using population-specific primers
designed in the sequences of the ITS-2 region previously
obtained. Amplifications were generated in a Mastercycle
epgradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), by 35 cycles
of 30 sec at 94°C, 40 sec at 55°C and 2 min at 72°C, preceded by 3 min at 94°C and followed by 3 min at 72°C for
the 5.8S rDNA region.
DNA haplotype nomenclature

The codes for the sequences obtained follow the standard nomenclature proposed for lymnaeid snails previously [1,45,51]. It shall be noted that haplotype codes
are only definitive in the case of complete sequences.
When dealing with fragments or incomplete sequences,
haplotype codes are provisional.
Software programs
Sequence alignments

Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL-W version 1.8
[63] and MEGA 4.0 [64], and assembly was made with
the Staden Package [65]. Subsequently, minor corrections were manually introduced for a better fit of
nucleotide correspondences in microsatellite sequence
regions. Homologies were performed using the BLASTN
programme from the National Center for Biotechnology
information web site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST. Genetic distances were measured using parameters provided by PAUP v.4.0b10 [66].

[GenBank: AY186751] [69].

implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [77] with four chains during
1,000,000 generations and trees were sampled every 100
generations. The first 1000 trees sampled were discarded
("burn-in”) and clade posterior probabilities (PP) were
computed from the remaining trees. Alternative methods
of phylogenetic reconstruction allowing an evaluation of
the support for each node were also applied. A distancebased phylogeny using the NJ algorithm with LogDet distances was obtained. Statistical support for the nodes was
evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Due to the several limitations recently shown by
mtDNA coding genes for interspecific sequence analyses
in invertebrates [78-80], phylogenetic reconstruction was
only made from combined sequences of ITS-2 and ITS-1
as the markers considered to be best for the analysis of
relationships between species belonging to different genera, as has already been verified in Lymnaeidae [45].
Phylogenetic analyses were performed after adding
reference sequences of ITS-2 and ITS-1 of lymnaeid
rDNA stored in the GenBank database (see species and
Acc. Nos. used in list noted above in chapter of sequence
comparisons). The intergenic region sequence (Genbank:
AY030361) [81] including both ITSs of a planorbid species, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, was used as outgroup.

Representation of the 18S rRNA secondary structure

Shells of lymnaeids were measured, according to traditional malacological methods [82,83], using a computerized image-analysis system [84]. This system was based
on a DXC-930P colour video camera (Sony, Tokyo) fitted
to a stereomicroscope, and connected to a computer running image analysis software (ImageProH Plus 4.5; Media
Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD).
For anatomical studies, adult lymnaeids were collected
in the field and allowed to relax overnight in water containing menthol. They were then immersed for 40 s in hot
water (70°C) before transfer to water at room temperature.
The soft parts were drawn from the shells with forceps
applied to the cephalopedal mass, and fixed in slightly
modified Railliet-Henry’s fluid (930 ml distilled water, 6 g
NaCl, 50 ml 40% formalin, and 20 ml glacial acetic acid).
The fixed snails were then dissected under a stereomicroscope, so that drawings of the reproductive system could
be made using a camera lucida [85].

The previously published secondary structure prediction
for Limicolaria kambeul 18S rRNA [71] based on the general eukaryote 18S rRNA secondary structure [72] was
used and extended to encompass lymnaeid sequences.
Phylogenetic inference

Phylogenies were inferred from DNA sequences using
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates with PAUP. ML
parameters such as model, base frequencies, transition/
transversion ratio (ts/tv), the shape parameter for the
gamma distribution, and the proportion of invariant sites,
were optimised using the hierarchical likelihood ratio test
(hLRT) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
[73,74], implemented in Modeltest 3.7 [75]. Starting
branch lengths were obtained using the least-squares
method with ML distances.
To provide an assessment of the reliability of the nodes
in the ML tree, three methods were used. First, a bootstrap
analysis using 1000 replicates was made with fast-heuristic
search in PAUP. Second, a distance-based phylogeny using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm [76] with the ML pairwise distances was obtained and statistical support for the
nodes was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates, with
and without removal of gapped positions. Third, a Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction procedure was applied to
obtain posterior probabilities (BPP) for the nodes in the
ML tree, by using the same evolutionary model as above,

Phenotypic study

Results
18S rRNA Gene

The 18S rDNA sequence of L. cousini from ChanchuYacu (Ecuador) and Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela) and
the one from L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah
(Colombia) are identical base to base, with a length of
1848 bp, GC content of 51.70%, and base frequencies of:
A = 0.239, G = 0.282, C = 0.235, and T = 0.244. This 18S
sequence has been deposited in GenBank under the

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:132
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/132

Accession No. FN598151. The 18S rDNA sequence of L.
ubaquensis from Laguna Ubaque (Colombia) showed a
sequence different to the aforementioned one, but identical to that of P. columella from Puerto Rico, with a 1850
bp length and a 51.70% GC content (0.238 A, 0.282 G,
0.235 C, 0.245 T), and which has been deposited under
Acc. No. FN598152. When comparing both 18S
sequences, a total of 16 nucleotide differences appear,
including 11 mutations and 5 insertions/deletions
(indels) (see Figure 2).
When comparing the 18S sequence shared by
L. ubaquensis and P. columella with the only P. columella 18S from Argentina [EU241866] previously available in GenBank, a total of 22 nucleotide differences
unexpectedly appeared (6 ts, 4 tv and 12 indels in a
1856 bp-long pairwise alingment), most differences
representing singleton polymorphic sites in conserved
areas of the secondary structure of this gene.
The multiple sequence alignment, including the ten
different 18S sequences of (a) L. cousini and L. bogotensis,
(b) P. columella from Puerto Rico and L. ubaquensis, the
stagnicoline species (c) L. (L.) stagnalis, (d) L. (S.) palustris and (e) O. glabra, the fossarine species (f) G. truncatula, (g) L. cubensis and (h) L. viatrix (identical sequence
as in L. neotropica), and the radicine species (i) R. auricularia and (j) R. balthica, was 1867 bp long, showing a

total of 62 variable nucleotide positions (3.32% divergence) (Figure 2). A total of 31 of these 62 polymorphic
sites appears grouped between positions 233 and 266,
which corresponds to the helix E10-1 of the variable area
V2 of the secondary structure. The other modified positions appear isolated in variable areas V1, V2, V4, V5 and
V9 and scattered throughout the rest of the 18S sequence
(Figure 2).
rDNA ITS-2

The populations of L. cousini from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia)
show an identical ITS-2 sequence, which is different from
the one showed by L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji
(Venezuela). These sequences have been deposited in
GenBank with the Acc. Nos. FN598153 and FN598154,
respectively. Their length and slightly GC biased average
nucleotide composition were 506 bp and 57.70% in Ecuador and Colombia, and 457 bp and 58.85% in Venezuela.
The pairwise comparison of these two ITS-2 sequences
shows 64 polymorphic sites, including 12 ts, 3 tv and 49
indels and representing a 12.65% divergence (Table 1).
Worth mentioning is that the high number of indels is not
due to the presence or absence of microsatellites and differences in corresponding repeats. Only 17 indels appear
related to microsatellite repeats, all of them located in the

3’ sequence end: GGTC (2 times in Ecuador and Colombia, 1 time in Venezuela), GCAG (2 and 1 times respectively), GT (7 and 3), and CGT) (2 and 1).
The ITS-2 sequence of L. ubaquensis from Ubaque
(Colombia) differs pronouncedly from that of L. cousini
from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from
Bogota savannah (Colombia) and also from the one of
L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela). On the
contrary, when compared to P. columella from Puerto
Rico, L. ubaquensis only shows one mutation, with C or
T in the position 6 of the ITS-2 alignment, respectively.
These two sequences have been deposited in the GenBank with the Acc. Nos. FN598155 for the population
of Puerto Rico and FN598156 for that of Ubaque. When
compared to the ITS-2 of P. columella from Cuba available in the GenBank (AY186751), a total of 2 mutations
and 9 indels appear.
For an analysis of species relationships, a comparison
between these four ITS-2 sequences (L. cousini =
L. bogotensis, L. cousini from Venezuela, P. columella
from Puerto Rico, and L. ubaquensis = P. columella
from Colombia) and those of stagnicolines and fossarines of GenBank was made with a pairwise ITS-2 distance matrix (Figure 3).

L. cousini HB = L.

rDNA ITS-1

Each one of the lymnaeid populations studied presented a
different ITS-1 sequence. Their length and slightly GC
biased average nucleotide composition were: 592 bp and
57.06% in L. cousini from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador); 587
bp and 56.82% in L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah
(Colombia); 530 bp long and 58.67%GC in L. ubaquensis
from Laguna Ubaque (Colombia); and 570 bp and 58.41%
in L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela). The four
sequences have been deposited under the Acc. Nos.
FN598157, FN598158, FN598160 and FN598159,
respectively.
The most similar sequences were those of L. cousini
from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from
Bogota savannah (Colombia), with only 24 polymorphic
sites (11 ts, 5 tv and 8 indels) representing a 4.05% divergence. When the aforementioned two sequences are pairwise compared with L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji
(Venezuela), the number of nucleotide differences
increases notably (Table 1). None of the numerous indels
corresponds to microsatellite repeat differences.
As in the case of ITS-2, the ITS-1 sequence of L. ubaquensis is very different from the three aforementioned
sequences, but identical to the one of P. columella from

In a multiple 672-bp-long sequence alignment including the five aforementioned sequences, a total of 565
positions were conserved, 107 variable, 18 parsimony
informative and 89 singleton sites. The sequence of
L. cousini from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and the two of
L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia) differ in
only 3 mutations. The number of nucleotide differences
increases considerably to 37 (5.5% divergence) when
these three sequences are compared to that of L. cousini
from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela) and to very numerous when with the one shared by L. ubaquensis and
P. columella (Figure 5).
Species relationships were analysed by comparing
these five cox1 sequences with other proximal lymnaeid
species available in GenBank, whose cox1 fragment
sequences were similar in lenght to those obtained in
the present paper, in a pairwise cox1 distance matrix
(Figure 6).
For each of the lymnaeid taxa studied, the amino-acid
sequence of the COX1 gene fragment obtained was 224 aa
long. A pairwise comparison of the COX1 amino-acid
sequences showed a 100% identity between the two
L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia), and only
one amino-acid difference (asparagine/isoleucine, respectively) in position 215 between them and L. cousini from
Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador). When comparing L. cousini
from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from
Bogota savannah (Colombia) with L. cousini from Laguna
Mucubaji (Venezuela), two differences appear: valine/isoleucine respectively in position 8, and isoleucine in lymnaeids from both Ecuador and Venezuela and asparagine
in those from Colombia in position 215. The COX1
amino-acid sequence of P. columella is characterised by
the presence of a methionine and threonine in positions
32 and 204, whereas all others show threonine and serine,
respectively. Worth mentioning is that L. cousini from
Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela) shows a COX1 amino-acid
sequence identical to that of L. viatrix from Argentina
(AM494010) (Figure 7).

Puerto Rico. In a pairwise alignment comparison with
P. columella ITS-1 from Cuba available in the GenBank
(AY186751: 527 bp long and 58.44% GC), three indels
appear in positions 262, 270 and 276. Worth noting is
the presence of A in position 510, in which whether A
or G were found in Cuba depending to the susceptibility
or resistance characteristics of the population,
respectively.
For an analysis of species relationships, a comparison
between these four ITS-1 sequences (L. cousini, L. bogotensis, L. cousini from Venezuela, and L. ubaquensis =
P. columella from Puerto Rico) and those of stagnicolines and fossarines of GenBank was made with a pairwise ITS-1 distance matrix (Figure 4).
Putative Intergenic Region Pseudogene Analysis

Only functional 5.8S rDNA sequences were obtained in
all individuals and populations analysed of L. cousini
from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador), L. bogotensis from Bogota
savannah (Colombia), L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji
(Venezuela), L. ubaquensis from Ubaque (Colombia) and
P. columella from Puerto Rico. These sequences were all
identical in length and nucleotide composition and have
been deposited in GenBank with the Acc. Nos.
HM560968, HM560969 and HM560970. Their length
and slightly GC biased average composition were 154 bp
and 55.84%. No methylation-related substitutions (C-T,
G-A) were detected. Thus, no degree of polymorphism
was observed for the 5.8S rDNA.
mtDNA cox1

Five different cox1 sequences were obtained, all of 672
bp and highly AT-biased. Respective AT contents and
GenBank Accession Nos. are: L. cousini from ChanchuYacu (Ecuador): 69.5% (FN598161); L. cousini from
Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela): 69.2% (FN598164);
L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia): two different sequences with 69.6% (FN598162) and 69.8%
(FN598163); L. ubaquensis from Laguna Ubaque
(Colombia) and P. columella from Puerto Rico: both
share the same sequence, with 69.1% (FN598165).

Phylogenetic Analysis

The combination of the two internal transcribed spacers
in a single data-set generated a robust tree, indicating
phylogenetic accordance between the two spacers. The
ML model best fitting this data-set was HKY85+G,
using a ts/tv ratio of 1.062 (kappa = 2.08626), base frequencies for A, C, G and T of 0.2094, 0.2696, 0.2405
and 0.2806, respectively, a proportion of invariable sites
= 0, and a gamma-distribution shape parameter of 0.53.
To assess the reliability of the nodes in the ML tree
(Figure 8), a bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates was
made using fast step-wise addition and the neighborjoining (NJ) algorithm with the ML pairwise distances in
PAUP. Finally, a Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction procedure was applied to obtain posterior probabilities
(BPP) for the nodes in the ML tree with MrBayes.
In the ML tree obtained (Figure 8), L. cousini from
Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from Bogota
savannah (Colombia) cluster together with L. cousini
from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela), within a well supported clade (87/98/100 in NJ/ML/BBP). This clade
appears basal to the Galba/Fossaria species and the European stagnicoline species groups. However, this basal
position does not seem to be clearly resolved, given the

relatively low supports. Lymnaea ubaquensis from Ubaque (Colombia) clusters in the same branch with P.
columella from Puerto Rico with the highest support,
but the relationship of this branch with the main node
including all other lymnaeid species is not well resolved.
A similar, low-supported link appears between the European Lymnaea (Stagnicola) species and the basally
appearing Palaearctic C. occulta, contrary to the relationships between the different Galba/Fossaria species
which are well supported.
The topology obtained with the NJ algorithm using
LogDet distances (Figure 9) is somewhat different to that
shown by the ML tree (Figure 8). Here again, L. cousini
from Ecuador, L. bogotensis from Colombia and L. cousini from Venezuela cluster together with a 100% bootstrap support, but this branch now appears as a sister
group of the Galba/Fossaria species clade, a 97% of bootstrap value supporting this relationship. As in the ML
phylogeny, L. ubaquensis from Ubaque (Colombia) clusters with P. columella from Puerto Rico in a 100% supported branch which appears basal to the rest of
lymnaeids. The position of the Palaearctic C. occulta in
this topology becomes interestingly different, changing to
appear separated from the rest of European stagnicolines

Diagnostic Description of Lymnaea meridensis n. sp.

Type locality A permanent pond in Mucubaji, Merida
State, located at an altitude of 3,550 m (8°47’51.8’’ N,
70°49’32.4’’ W).
Other locality A small ditch in the Paso del Condor
area, Merida State, at an altitude of 4,040 m (8°50’38.2.’’
N, 70°49’33.9’’ W).
Type specimens Voucher specimens are deposited in the
parasite and vector collection of the Department of
Parasitology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain,
including a haplotype (Figure 10; 8.5 mm long by 5.4
mm wide; DPUV No. 00.03.20.1.MV) and four paratypes
(DPUV No. 00.03.20.2 - 5.MV). In accordance with section 8.6 of the ICZN’s International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature, copies of this article are deposited at the
following five publicly accessible libraries: Natural History Museum, London, UK; American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA; Museum National
d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France; Russian Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, Russia; Academia Sinica, Taipei,
Taiwan.
Shell The shell is light brown, thin-walled, with relatively short spire, obtuse apex and fine growth lines,
and has only 3 whorls. The body whorl dominates the
shell, is inflated and separated by a deep, well-marked
suture. The aperture is large, oblique, oval and wide at
the base. The form of the shell is illustrated in Figure
10. Measurements and calculated ratios are noted in

Table 2. The shell tends to be one and a half times as
long as it is wide, and its aperture tends to be two
thirds as long as the shell or more than twice as long
as the spire.
Anatomy The morphoanatomical features are shown in
Figure 11. The renal tube extends straightly from the
pericardial region toward the mantle collar, diagonally
across the roof of the pallial cavity. In its distal part,
behind the osphradium, it shows two distinct flexures,
coming back upon itself and, after a short course, bending sharply cephalad and rightward forming a ureter
which tapers to a subterminal meatus behind the pneumostome (Figure 11A).
The ovotestis appears composed by pressed acini
around a collecting canal which continues into an ovispermiduct presenting a very short smooth-walled proximal segment followed by a bosselated swelling seminal
vesicle and finally a relatively short distal segment
which ends in the carrefour. The albumen gland covers
the carrefour and the origin of a bosselated, transverse
tubular oviduct which follows a somewhat convolute
course continuing into a striated nidamental gland.
The nidamental gland narrows into a smooth-walled
uterus, which bends and continues into a short bulbous vagina showing a sphincter-like thickening. The
spherical spermatheca gives rise to an uniformly thin
spermathecal duct which extends diagonally between
the nidamental gland and the prostate until joining the
vagina (Figure 11B).
The distal portion of the spermiduct and the proximal
portion of the prostate run on the ventral surface of the

nidamental gland. The spermiduct, of granular outer
surface, emerges from the carrefour, runs distalward
and finally narrows to merge into a similarly granular
prostate (Figure 11B). The prostate increases in width
to its distal end, shows ventrally a lengthwise fissure,
formed by the folding of its left margin, and finally two
rounded protuberances, from whose convergence the
vas deferens arises (Figure 11C). The vas deferens
appears as a long, more or less uniformly thin duct
which merges into a penis which is included within the
penial sheath (Figure 11D).
The penis sheath is regularly cylindrical, with a somewhat thicker proximal part. The penis sheath is a little
longer than the prepuce (ratio range of 0.93-1.38; mean

1.18 ± 0.18). The prepuce is thicker, around twice as
wide as the penis sheath at the point of insertion of the
penial sheath and gradually narrowing to terminate in
the male genital pore (Figure 11D).
DNA sequence markers Specific classification can be
based on the sequences of rDNA ITS-2 (GenBank Accession No. FN598154; haplotype H1), rDNA ITS-1
(FN598159; haplotype HA) and mtDNA cox1 (FN598164;
provisional haplotype code Ha). For supraspecific classification, the nucleotide sequence of the 18S rRNA gene
(FN598151) can be employed. The amino-acid sequence
corresponding to the mtDNA COX1 protein (FN598164;
provisional haplotype code HI) does not appear to be
helpful for species discrimination.

Discussion
Genetic characterisation

The sequences of such a conserved gene as the 18S rRNA
[45,46] indicate that L. cousini from Chanchu-Yacu
(Ecuador), L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia) and L. meridensis n. sp. from Laguna Mucubaji
(Venezuela) belong to the same evolutionary lineage and
which is different of the one of L. ubaquensis from
Laguna Ubaque (Colombia) and P. columella from
Puerto Rico. The surprisingly high number of nucleotide
differences in conserved positions of the 18S between our
P. columella from Puerto Rico and the same species in
Argentina [67] indicate that possibly another unknown
lymnaeid species was involved in that study carried out
in Argentina or, most probably, the Argentinean
sequence was not sufficiently “clean”. In one or another
case, results showing a real-time, 18S-based PCR strategy
to be useful for rapid discrimination among main lymnaeid species from Argentina [67] should be reassessed,
even if the target used was the sequence fragment

corresponding to the helix E10-1 of the variable area V2
highlighted by Bargues and Mas-Coma [46] and not the
entire gene. Moreover, this gene has recently proved to
be useless for the discrimination of other lymnaeid species present in this country, as L. viatrix and L. neotropica which present identical 18S sequence [62].
The analyses of both ITS-2 and ITS-1 offer conclusive
results. The identical ITS-2 sequence and scarcely different ITS-1 sequences indicate that the lymnaeid populations from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and Bogota
savannah (Colombia) are indeed different combined
haplotypes belonging to the same species. Consequently,
the systematic name L. cousini shall be retained and L.
bogotensis is molecularly confirmed to be its synonym.
This conclusion agrees with the same synonymy based
on shell morphology and soft part anatomy already proposed by Hubendick [39] and later accepted by several
authors [37,43,44], but different from the proposal of
Malek [86] who included L. bogotensis as a synonym of
P. columella. Thus, the population of the type locality

Figure 11 Anatomy of Lymnaea meridensis n. sp. Aspects of soft part anatomy of Lymnaea meridensis n. sp. from Laguna Mucubaji,
Venezuela: A) renal tube and ureter in renal region extending between pericardium and mantle collar; B) reproductive system; C) detail of
spermiduct and prostate in dorsal view; D) preputium and penis sheath. Scale bars: A = 1 mm; B,D = 1.5 mm; C = 0.75 mm.

Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) corresponds to the combined
haplotype L. cousini ITS-2 H1 and ITS-1 HA, and that
of Bogota savannah (Colombia) to L. cousini ITS-2 H1
and ITS-1 HB. The total of 16 nucleotide substitutions
in ITS-1 (Table 1), despite the lack of differences in
ITS-2, suggests that these two populations begin to follow divergent evolutionary lineages, owing to the evolutionary rate of ITS-1 faster than the one of ITS-2 in
lymnaeids [45].
However, ITS-2 and ITS-1 sequences do not support
the synonymy of L. ubaquensis with L. cousini proposed
by Hubendick [39] and Malek [86]. In fact, the insufficient description of L. ubaquensis by both Piaget [57]
and Hubendick [39] does not allow to draw clear conclusions on the true identity of this species, and its quotation by Hubendick [39] in such a southern locality as
Valdivia, in Chile, has posed acceptance problems [37].
The sequences of the two spacers demonstrate that the
population of Laguna Ubaque (Colombia) is only a haplotype of P. columella. Therefore, L. ubaquensis becomes
a synonym of P. columella with the following haplotype
correspondences: the population of Puerto Rico

corresponds to the combined haplotype P. columella
ITS-2 H1 and ITS-1 HA, and that of Laguna Ubaque
(Colombia) to P. columella ITS-2 H2 and ITS-1 HA.
The sequence of the intergenic ITS-1, 5.8S, ITS-2 region
of P. columella from Cuba ((AY186751)) [69] should be
verified with regard to the 12 indels (9 in ITS-2 and 3
in ITS-1) appearing in the comparison, previously to a
definitive haplotype code ascription. Interestingly, these
authors were able to find a correlation between two
mutations, one in each one of the spacers, and the susceptibility or resistance of P. columella populations to F.
hepatica miracidial infection. With regard to this aspect,
P. columella from Puerto Rico presents C (susceptible)
and that of Laguna Ubaque shows T (resistant) in position 6 of the ITS-2, and both present A (susceptible,
instead of G in the resistant populations) in position
510 of the ITS-1.
Additionally, ITS-2 and ITS-1 sequences from Venezuelan lymnaeids are sufficiently different from those of
L. cousini (= L. bogotensis) and P. columella (= L. ubaquensis) as to indicate that the population of Laguna
Mucubaji (Venezuela) merits species status. Although

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:132
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/132

close to L. cousini, the 12.65% divergence at ITS-2 level
and 11.29-11.73% divergence at ITS-1 level fit within
ITS divergences known between different species and
are higher than those known between different populations of the same species in Lymnaeidae [8,14,42,48-51].
Thus, these results agree with the phenotypic differences
shown by the shell and soft part anatomy (see below)
and support the erection of L. meridensis n. sp.
The mtDNA cox1 sequence fully supports the results
obtained with rDNA ITSs (haplotype codes only provisional due to incomplete sequences of the gene - see
Figures 5, 6 and 7). The very few nucleotide differences
between L. cousini from Chanchu-Yacu (Ecuador) and
the two of L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah (Colombia) indicate their belonging to the same species. The
higher differences of the aforementioned with that from
L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela) support
species status for the latter. The identical cox1 sequence
of L. ubaquensis from Laguna Ubaque (Colombia) and
P. columella from Puerto Rico also indicates that these
lymnaeids belong in fact to the same species. Finally, the
great cox1 differences between the lymnaeids from
Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, on one side, and
those of Laguna Ubaque and Puerto Rico, on the other
side, indicate that two well separated groups are
involved.
Differences in the COX1 amino-acid sequence do not
appear to be helpful (haplotype codes only provisional due
to incomplete sequences of the gene - see Figure 7). The
two amino-acid positions discriminating L. ubaquensis
from Laguna Ubaque (Colombia) and P. columella from
Puerto Rico from the rest of lymnaeid species seem to be
the only exception. Amino-acids in these two positions
agree with the incomplete sequence of P. columella from
Australia [54] (Figure 7). The lack of amino-acid differences between two species as distant one another as
L. cousini from Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela) and
L. viatrix from Argentina [42] suggests that nucleotide
saturation in codon positions occurs in the evolution of
the mtDNA cox1 coding gene.
Intergenic region pseudogene exclusion

The numerous, non-microsatellite/minisatellite-related
indels found in both ITS-2 and ITS-1 sequences when
comparing the populations of L. cousini from ChanchuYacu (Ecuador) and L. bogotensis from Bogota savannah
(Colombia), on one side, with those of L. cousini from
Laguna Mucubaji (Venezuela), on the other side, offered
a situation never detected in lymnaeids before. This
posed a question mark on the accuracy of the ITS-2 and
ITS-1 sequences obtained, even more when considering
that these sequences came from different populations of
the a priori same species.
Although the so-called intergenic region, including the
short-length 5.8S rRNA gene separating the two internal

Page 15 of 22

transcribed spacers ITS-1 and ITS-2, has been assumed
to evolve in concert, the number of investigations
revealing high degrees of intra-individual polymorphism
has risen in recent years. Such an intra-individual polymorphism is the consequence of an incomplete concerted or non-concerted evolution caused by i.e.
hybridization, disadventageous loci or polyploidy [87,88].
In the studies on eukaryotes in which polymorphic
intergenic regions have been identified, polymorphic ITS
copies have often shown to contain potential pseudogenes in addition to functional copies [89]. Pseudogenes
are DNA sequences that (i) were derived from functional genes but have been rendered nonfunctional by
mutations that prevent their proper expression and (ii)
evolve at a high rate because they are subject to no
functional constraints. The influence of pseudogenes is
one of the most important issues recently arisen in the
debates on phylogenetic hypotheses [80].
When dealing with the intergenic region of the
nuclear rDNA, one way to rule out the possibility of
pseudogenes being related to a priori unexpected
sequences of the ITSs is through the 5.8S rDNA
sequence. Putative pseudogenes can be identified by the
detection of mutations at highly conserved sites such as
within the 5.8S [90]. Hence, this gene has become the
most valuable indicator of the functionality of ITS
copies [91]. The 5.8S is assumed to be highly conserved
because its secondary structure is required for proper
function of the ribosomal complex [92]. Thus, 5.8S
rDNA copies which have lost the ability to build up this
conserved secondary structure represent pseudogenes.
They are expected to mutate freely, even in conserved
positions. Therefore, pseudogenes are characterised by
accelerated substitution rates, length variation, methylation-related substitutions causing reduced GC content,
and reduced stability of the secondary structure [93-96].
In the present study, sequencing results obtained from
the 5.8S rRNA gene of the three aforementioned lymnaeid populations yielded three 154-bp-long sequences
which proved to be identical one another. The 5.8S
rDNA proved to be a conserved sequence, with no difference in length, total absence of mutations and no low
GC content. All these features corroborate that no pseudogenes are involved in the numerous indels appearing
between the ITS-2 and ITS-1 sequences. Hence, there is
no reason against the presence of that high non-microsatellite/minisatellite-related indel polymorphism in
functional ITS sequences of the three lymnaeid populations in question.
Phenotypic differentiation

Lymnaea cousini (= L. bogotensis; = L. selli), L. meridensis n. sp. (= L. cousini sensu Pointier et al., 2004, 2009)
and P. columella (= L. ubaquensis) present a similar
general type of shell, with an aperture of about 2/3 of

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:132
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/132

the total shell height, which explains the repeated confusion in specimen classifications. However, a detailed
morphometric comparison allows the differentiation of
L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. by three shell characteristics (Table 2; Figure 10): (i) the shell in L. cousini is
of greater size, of up to 14/10 mm, 13.7/8.6 mm and
11.7/7.0 mm length/width according to different studies
[43,55,56], than in L. meridensis n. sp. (up to 9.3/6.0
mm length/width), (ii) it has 4 whorls in L. cousini at a
shell length in which there are only 3 whorls in L. meridensis n. sp., and (iii) the spire is relatively shorter in L.
meridensis n. sp. than in L. cousini (which is shown by a
greater AL/SpL ratio in the new species). In its turn,
both L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. differ from P.
columella by the characteristic raised spiral threads of
the periostracum, which are absent in the former two
lymnaeid species but present in P. columella [86]. Additionally, the shell of L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. is
more broadly conic, its aperture wider and the body
whorl more convex than in P. columella.
With regard to the inner anatomy, four characteristics
may help in distinguishing L. meridensis n. sp. from L.
cousini: a) the distal segment of the ovispermiduct or
hermaphroditic duct appears to be shorter in L. meridensis n. sp. than in L. cousini [40,43]; b) the spermiduct
is only somewhat thinner than the prostate in L. meridensis n. sp. whereas clearly slender in L. cousini
[40,43]; c) the external forms at the beginning of the
penis sheath, described as a circlet of minute knobs by
Paraense [40] and as a ring of papillae by Velasquez
[43], were not observed in L. meridensis n. sp.; d) the
penis sheath length/prepuce length ratio in L. meridensis
n. sp. (range of 0.93-1.38; mean 1.18 ± 0.18) is smaller
than in L. cousini (penis sheath is 1.5 times as long as
the prepuce according to Paraense [40]; range of 1.301.96; mean 1.5 ± 0.24 according to Velasquez [43]).
Moreover, L. cousini shares several crucial anatomic
features with L. meridensis n. sp. but which allow them
to be distinguished from P. columella and other important authochthonous lymnaeid vector species in South
America [40,42,97-100): A) Kidney: it distally presents
two distinct flexures in the ureter, similarly as in P.
columella but differently than in L. viatrix, L. neotropica
and L. diaphana in which this distal part is straight; B)
Vagina: with a bulbous swelling, which is absent in P.
columella, L. viatrix, L. neotropica and L. diaphana; C)
Spermiduct: thinner than the prostate, as in L. viatrix, L.
neotropica and L. diaphana, whereas of about the same
width in P. columella; D) Prostate: with distal oblique or
lengthwise fissure, as in L. viatrix, L. neotropica and L.
diaphana, whereas such a fissure is absent in P. columella; E) Penis sheath: from as long to longer than the
prepuce, while much shorter in P. columella, shorter in

Page 16 of 22

L. viatrix and L. neotropica, and from as long to shorter
in L. diaphana.
Species relationships

DNA sequences, phenotypic characteristics and the phylogenetic reconstruction show the close relationships
between Lymnaea cousini (= L. bogotensis; = L. selli)
and L. meridensis n. sp., as well as their distance regarding P. columella (= L. ubaquensis). This means that the
assignment of both L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. to
the genus Pseudosuccinea does not appear to be the correct option, despite their pronounced external resemblance which suggests an evolutionary phenotypic
convergence probably related to the inhabitance of similar environments and which has given rise to frequent
specimen misclassification as shown in the present
study.
Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships between the
different great lineages, including the groups of the stagnicolines, the Galba/Fossaria and Pseudosuccinea, and
the L. cousini-L. meridensis group do not appear to be
well resolved (see Figures 8 and 9). Consequently, prudence suggests to better keep L. cousini and L. meridensis n. sp. within the genus Lymnaea sensu lato for the
time being, awaiting a general review of Lymnaeidae
from Latin America which will include the appropriate
systematic-taxonomic analysis of the taxa which have
been recognised as valid after accurate DNA sequence
study. At any rate, according to the value of the information furnished by 18S rDNA sequences [45,46], the
results here obtained suggest that the L. cousini-L. meridensis group is following a lineage different from those
of the other lymnaeids hightherto analysed. The ML and
NJ-LogDet phylogenetic reconstructions obtained indicate in the same sense.
The present results show that ITS-2, ITS-1 and cox1
are good markers not only for identifying L. cousini, L.
meridensis n. sp. and P. columella in fascioliasis endemic
areas in northern Andean countries, but also for the
classification of samples of these species to haplotype
level. This usefulness becomes crucial when considering
that these three species may be easily confused and specimen classification be a hard task. Numerous exhaustive studies on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
have already proved the value of these three markers for
the distinction and identification of lymnaeids. Moreover, they can be helpful in assessing the fascioliasis vector role of different populations, according to recent
studies having shown different susceptibility to F. hepatica infection, as proved in P. columella [69].
Distributional outline

Although L. cousini appears to be widespread where
present [25], it has been the objective of studies published in the literature only sporadically. The southern-

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:132
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/132

most report of this species, under the name of L. ubaquensis, in Valdivia, Chile [39] poses a problem already
highlighted [37,40]. The brief description of the shell
and the male copulatory organ made by Hubendick [39]
is insufficient to draw clear conclusions on the correct
classification of the Chilean specimen. Although the climate of the lowland of Valdivia is of temperate type and
thus not so different from the environmental characteristics of the high altitude in the Andean areas of Ecuador and Colombia, such a southern isolated location
becomes surprising and should be verified. The confusion of L. ubaquensis with P. columella demonstrated in
our molecular study suggests that another species may
be involved.
Thus, the aforementioned report excluded, the following southernmost report of L. cousini concerns Ecuador,
namely quoted as L. raphaelis Jousseaume, 1887, in the
area of Azuay, South of Cuenca (2550 m a.s.l.) [55] and
which has also been synonymized with L. cousini [39].
Although this finding still needs appropriate confirmation, the distance from and Andean plateau characteristics similar to the more northern Machachi, Pichincha
province, Ecuador (78°30’W, 00°30’S, 3100 m a.s.l.) [24]
suggests, together with the type locality about 10 km
southwest of Quito (2650 m a.s.l.) [40,41,55], that L.
cousini may be widespread from the south to the north
throughout the Andean flatlands in that country. This
species has been noted to be also found in Lake San
Pablo (0°13’ N, 78°14’ W, 2660 m a.s.l.), close to Otavalo
[41], where it coexists with P. columella [101] with
which it may be easily confused when only basing on
shell characteristics.
In Colombia, Laguna de Ubaque [57] excluded due to
the proved confusion of L. ubaquensis with P. columella,
L. cousini has been reported, under the name L. bogotensis, from the neighbourhood of Bogota city (4°35’56’’
N, 74°04’51’’ W; 2650 m a.s.l.) [25,27,39,44,56,86] up to
the 90 km north from the capital, in the surroundings
of Utabe, and also 180 km more northward in Quebrada
and Vereda la Toibita in Paipa, Boyaca (5°47’04’’ N, 73°
06’47’’ W; 2525 m a.s.l.) [36,43].
Thus, the distribution of L. cousini appears restricted
to Andean highland areas of an altitude between 2,500
and 3,100 m (Figure 1). This lymnaeid species appears
to prefer wet flatlands, where it is typically found among
watercress and other aquatic and semiaquatic vegetation
in slowly flowing waters of swamped areas from subsoil
effluences, as in Chanchu-Yacu [40] (Figure 12A, B), on
mud around small watercourses, on the very small water
bodies originated in cattle footprints, and on natural and
man-made, little deep drainage canals in culture fields
and livestock pasturelands in both the savannah of
Bogota and Utabe surroundings ([25] and personal
observations) (Figure 12C), and more rarely at the

Page 17 of 22

water’s edges of lakes, lagoons or ponds, as in Lake San
Pablo [41].
Lymnaea meridensis n. sp. appears, on the contrary, to
be a geographically more restricted species according to
present knowledge which suggests this species to have
evolved isolatedly in permanent ponds and small ditches
in more northern, very high altitude areas (3,550-4,040
m) of the Andean mountains, as those of Merida State,
in Venezuela [38,41] (Figure 12F, G).
Involvement in fascioliasis transmission

Lymnaea cousini is known to be a vector of F. hepatica
since early last century, when it was proved to be the
lymnaeid responsible for the usual livestock infection in
the Cundinamarca-Boyaca plateau, where it follows an
apparent seasonal population dynamics which still need
an accurate follow-up analysis. In that area, natural liver
fluke infection rates in the snails seem to be low, of
0.07-1.64% [25-27]. This lymnaeid was noted to be a
mollusc of low parasitic efficacy for F. hepatica, due to
its very low fasciolid infection percentages and its additional role of intermediate host for other trematode species [25]. The very low experimental infection rate of
0.6% obtained in L. cousini by Muñoz Rivas [27] supported that assumption. However, in an area of the
same Bogota savannah presenting a serious animal
infection problem, a higher 12% natural infection rate in
lymnaeids was found [102]. Although these snails were
not classified at specific level, they all presumably
belonged to L. cousini given their geographical origin.
Specimens of the same lymnaeid species were also
found infected in Paipa [43].
A surprisingly high natural infection rate of 31.43%
was found in L. cousini from Machachi, in Ecuador [24],
the classification of the fluke larval stages being confirmed by experimental infection of mice with metacercariae [103]. The environmental conditions favouring
the development of snail populations and the transmission of the parasite in that Andean area were highlighted to explain such a high transmission rate. The
relatively high infection rates of 34.0% and of 39-60%
recently obtained in the laboratory with a Colombian
isolate of the same lymnaeid species from Vereda la
Toibita in Paipa, Boyaca [36], indicate that L. cousini
may develop an important transmission role in concrete
areas.
A recent comparison of experimental infection in
L. cousini and P. columella has furnished interesting
results [36]: A) Infectivity: the infection rate in L. cousini
(34.0%) is pronuncedly lower than that obtained in
P. columella (82.8% in that study; even higher rates have
been obtained in other places [104]). B) Survival: in
L. cousini, a statistically significant, pronounced decline
from 13 weeks post-exposure onwards was detected,
whereas numbers of the controls fell drastically only

after 25 weeks post-exposure. The mean lifespan of
L. cousini is long (mean 20-23 weeks) and allows the
parasite to remain and produce a great number of
rediae. On the contrary, the infection did not affect the

survival of P. columella, whose lifespan is shorter (mean
9-11 weeks) with regard to the occurrence of cercarial
shedding (7 weeks post-exposure). C) Fecundity: parasitisation showed a greater effect on L. cousini than on

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:132
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/132

P. columella. In L. cousini, egg number and mainly egg
clusters per snail decreased, egg cluster production ceasing almost completely in infected snails. Influences were
also seen in P. columella, including a significant reduction in the number of eggs per cluster, mainly egg clusters per snail, and also eggs per snail, many clusters
lacking eggs, a phenomenon not observed in L. cousini.
D) Growth: whereas no effect was observed in L. cousini,
a reduced growth rate was shown by P. columella
throughout snail’s life. E) Life table: differences appeared
smaller in L. cousini than in P. columella, with a net
reproductive rate (Ro) in the control group of almost
double in the first species and nearly four times greater
in the second. Thus, the main conclusion is that,
although both L. cousini and P. columella are affected
by F. hepatica infection, in L. cousini the prevalences
are low but cercarial shedding is more prolonged since
its lifespan is greater, while in P. columella infection
rates are high but cercarial shedding time is brief due to
its short lifespan [36].
The aforementioned compensatory development strategy followed by the liver fluke in L. cousini may explain
how it is able to maintain high livestock prevalences by
its own, as is the case of the 90% prevalence in cattle of
Machachi, Ecuador [103] and the high prevalences
known in cattle in the Cundinamarca-Boyaca plateau,
Colombia [25]. However, this lymnaeid species does not
appear to be a vector facilitating human infection, contrary to the case of the species of the Galba/Fossaria
group [4,42]. Indeed, human infection cases reported in
areas inhabited by L. cousini in both Ecuador [22,23]
and Colombia [26,28,29,31] only seem to concern sporadic patients.
With regard to L. meridensis n. sp., its phylogenetic relationships and body size suggest that it may most probably
be susceptible for F. hepatica infection. Its isolated populations on very high altitude areas of Andean Venezuela
(3,550-4,040 m) may be involved in disease transmission
in such altitude areas during the yearly window in which
temperatures are higher than the F. hepatica development
threshold of 10°C [11]. This is the case of the human
hyperendemic area of the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, at
3800-4100 m a.s.l., where disease transmission is increased
due to the very high altitude conditions [14] and the highest human prevalences and intensities are known [15,105].
An experimental F. hepatica infection assay in the laboratory is needed, and field studies should be carried out to
assess its possibly wider distributional outline and potential role to participate in fascioliasis transmission to both
animals and humans.
Conclusion

DNA sequences confirm the originality of the lymnaeid
fauna in the northern Andean countries of Ecuador,

Page 19 of 22

Colombia and Venezuela. However, results obtained
change the species spectrum previously known. Lymnaea cousini proved to be a valid species, but L. bogotensis and L. ubaquensis showed to in fact only be
synonyms of L. cousini and P. columella, respectively.
Additionally, a new species apparently endemic to very
high altitudes, L. meridensis n. sp., should be included
in this northern fauna.
The importance of the two original faunistic members
lies on their capacity to participate in fascioliasis transmission. Lymnaea cousini is involved as vector in highlands of
Ecuador and Colombia, where it appears mainly related to
animal fascioliasis and only sporadically with isolated
human infection cases. Phylogenetic results indicating a
close relationship between L. cousini and L. meridensis
n. sp. and their relationship with the Galba/Fossaria
vector group clade, suggest the new species to also be a
disease transmitter.
