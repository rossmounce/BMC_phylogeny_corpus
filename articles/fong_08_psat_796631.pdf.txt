Abstract
Background: The conservation of gene order among prokaryotic genomes can provide valuable
insight into gene function, protein interactions, or events by which genomes have evolved.
Although some tools are available for visualizing and comparing the order of genes between
genomes of study, few support an efficient and organized analysis between large numbers of
genomes. The Prokaryotic Sequence homology Analysis Tool (PSAT) is a web tool for comparing
gene neighborhoods among multiple prokaryotic genomes.
Results: PSAT utilizes a database that is preloaded with gene annotation, BLAST hit results, and
gene-clustering scores designed to help identify regions of conserved gene order. Researchers use
the PSAT web interface to find a gene of interest in a reference genome and efficiently retrieve the
sequence homologs found in other bacterial genomes. The tool generates a graphic of the genomic
neighborhood surrounding the selected gene and the corresponding regions for its homologs in
each comparison genome. Homologs in each region are color coded to assist users with analyzing
gene order among various genomes. In contrast to common comparative analysis methods that
filter sequence homolog data based on alignment score cutoffs, PSAT leverages gene context
information for homologs, including those with weak alignment scores, enabling a more sensitive
analysis. Features for constraining or ordering results are designed to help researchers browse
results from large numbers of comparison genomes in an organized manner. PSAT has been
demonstrated to be useful for helping to identify gene orthologs and potential functional gene
clusters, and detecting genome modifications that may result in loss of function.
Conclusion: PSAT allows researchers to investigate the order of genes within local genomic
neighborhoods of multiple genomes. A PSAT web server for public use is available for performing
analyses on a growing set of reference genomes through any web browser with no client side
software setup or installation required. Source code is freely available to researchers interested in
setting up a local version of PSAT for analysis of genomes not available through the public server.
Access to the public web server and instructions for obtaining source code can be found at http:/

Background
An analysis of gene order conservation is commonly performed in genomic comparison studies of microbial
genomes. Several tools for visualizing and comparing
gene order on a whole genome scale have been developed
for identifying genomic rearrangements and to infer phylogenetic relationships between genomes [1-3]. Gene
order analyses on a local genomic neighborhood level,
however, can also be very useful for helping to predict
gene function, identify proteins that potentially interact
physically, or infer evolutionary relationships between
genomes [4,5]. For example, clusters of genes conserved
among several species, including distantly related species,
suggest a positive selection for a particular local arrangement of genes that may indicate the existence of an
operon or groups of genes that are functionally related [69].
Researchers frequently perform comparative genomics
studies between a selected set of closely related genomes
to investigate genomic differences responsible for distinct
characteristics. Several tools that have been developed
with features to assist researchers with comparing
genomic neighborhoods between genomes therefore
focus on comparisons among only a small set of genomes
[10-14]. Many of these tools are also designed for local
installation that requires researchers to setup software on
their own workstations, and then provide sequence input
files to be processed locally [10,12,14,15]. These tools are
often limited in the number of genomes supported for
comparison because analyses among a large number of
genomes can result in long computing times and present
challenges in the display of massive amount of results.
The research community therefore needs tools that facilitate more efficient and manageable comparisons of
genomic neighborhoods among larger sets of genomes.
We have developed the Prokaryotic Sequence homology
Analysis Tool (PSAT), a web based tool that utilizes a large
database of pre-calculated sequence homologs for analysis of genomic neighborhoods among large numbers of
bacterial genomes. A PSAT web server is publicly available
to provide researchers around the world with access to the
tool's comparative analysis utilities immediately, without
any software installation or setup. Several other websites
have been developed with similar designs, utilizing custom databases populated with gene and homology data
from multiple bacterial genomes and providing a set of
analysis tools through a web interface. Some examples
include MicrobesOnline, Prolinks, STRING and the TIGR
Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR), each with its
own set of comparative genomics features [16-19]. A common feature these systems all share is a graphical browser
for comparing the genomic region surrounding a gene of
interest with other genomes. We recognize the utility of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/170

visualization methods for studying gene context and have
developed PSAT with a focus on this aspect of comparative analysis. PSAT uses an original visualization method
for a sensitive gene order analysis and provides features
specifically designed to facilitate comparison of genomic
neighborhoods among large numbers of genomes.

Implementation
We describe here how we generate the data to populate
the database utilized by the PSAT web server. We then provide an overview of the source code developed for generating the web interface for query and display of results.
Researchers interested in running a local version of PSAT
can download the freely available source code and follow
similar methods to create and populate their own database for studying unpublished genomes or genomes not
yet added to our public PSAT tool.
Protein and sequence files for published bacterial
genomes are downloaded from NCBI [20]. The protein
files are parsed to populate a PostgreSQL [21] database
with details about the genes including location, strand,
product, and a gene index indicating positional order
within the genome. Protein BLAST databases are created
using sequence files for all genomes added to the database. Each genome is designated to be a reference genome
or a comparison genome (or both a reference and comparison genome) and protein BLAST [22] is run for the
genes of the reference genomes against the genes of each
comparison genome. The top three hits for each reference
gene against each comparison genome are stored in the
database including details such as a gene identifier, alignment start and end, and BLAST scores such as e-value, percent identity and bit score. The tool can be extended to
include any number of reference genomes, and new comparison genomes can be added as they are released to
NCBI. Perl [23] scripts query the database for BLAST hits
along with gene indices to determine the number of
sequence homolog pairs that occur in consecutive order.
This method is used to assign each BLAST hit pair a
homolog cluster score that is utilized by the tool to help
infer which genomes have the greatest number of genes in
conserved order surrounding a given homolog pair. The
homolog cluster scores are stored in the database for quick
access by the tool.
Several freely available Perl modules (available from
CPAN [24]) are used to generate the PSAT web interface.
A web form created using the Perl CGI module collects
user input for selecting genomes to compare, finding specific genes, setting homolog filters such as BLAST score
thresholds, or specifying a particular type of query. The
Perl DBD module is used to query the database for genes
and their BLAST hits that meet the input criteria. The CGI
scripts process and display the results taking into account

options, such as criteria for filtering or sorting results,
specified by the user. Homolog details and homolog cluster scores are formatted into an html table and by default
are grouped by bacterial genus. The Perl ImageMagick
module [25] is used to draw the graphic visualizing the
genomic neighborhood surrounding a given gene, and the
genomic neighborhoods surrounding homologs found in
other genomes. Javascript is used to display gene and
alignment details in popup boxes that are activated when
users hover the mouse over each gene in the graphic. PSAT
runs on an Apache web server [26] such that users can easily access the tool from any web browser without needing
to install any additional software.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/170

PSAT users use the tool's web interface to select a single
reference genome to perform comparisons with over five
hundred bacterial genomes publicly available through
NCBI. Because protein sequence homologs have been precomputed and stored in an optimized database, retrieval
of homologs among such large numbers of genomes
using various querying options is quick. For the selected
gene of interest and each of its homologs in the result set,
PSAT generates and aligns a visualization graphic of the
genomic neighborhood. Each gene in the reference
genome is assigned a color, and any homolog found in
the displayed region of a comparison genome is color
coded to correspond with the appropriate reference gene.
The coloring of homologs is designed to help researchers
easily identify regions of conserved gene order across several genomes, providing support for gene orthology or
functional gene clusters. To facilitate examination of gene
neighborhoods, popups activated when hovering the
mouse over each drawn gene provide users with gene
details such as gene name, locus tag, and description, as
well as any relevant BLAST hit details. A zoom tool is also
available for comparing genomic regions of different
sizes, ranging from 1 to 100 kb. To assist researchers with
exploration of large amounts of results, features are available for scrolling through the images generated for each
comparison genome to align with the reference genome,
selecting to remove genomes from the visualization, or
reordering the results based on BLAST hit scores or using
PSAT's homolog cluster scoring system.

ties such as a similar lifestyle. The scoring method utilized
in PSAT was designed such that scores comparing large
numbers of genomes can be calculated efficiently with
minimal bias and preloaded within the tool for immediate access by users. The user adjustable query constraints
enable researchers with varying interests to perform analyses with a range of sensitivities. Tolerant alignment score
thresholds increase sensitivity in the search for gene clusters by allowing for cases where protein similarity across
distantly related genomes may be relatively low. The gene
context (contiguous sequence) requirement acts as a filter
that significantly reduces false gene cluster predictions.
This combination of factors, tolerant alignment score
thresholds and contiguous genes in similar order, was
found in practice to be a powerful and computationally
efficient method of discovering conserved gene clusters.
Among other factors that have been previously considered
such as phylogenetic profile, co-occurrence in a metabolic
pathway and co-occurrence in published text, conserved
gene order was found to be the most determining factor
for identifying conserved gene clusters [17,27]. Innovative
algorithms have also been developed to identify clusters
of genes whose close proximity to one another has been
conserved but not necessarily the ordering of genes [8,2831]. These approaches to modeling more complex clusters
however require increased computational overhead, and
adding more stringent requirements to increase accuracy
can actually limit the ability to detect some conserved
clusters (see for example Fulton et al. 2006 [32]). For
PSAT the minimal overhead of determining the homolog
cluster score enables efficient and rapid searches in a database that is not limited in size, has user adjustable alignment score thresholds, and can easily be modified to
reflect alignments for updated or new genome sequences
as they become available. For clusters that are interleaved
with pseudogenes, local gene rearrangements, insertions,
deletions or inversions the homolog cluster score will be
smaller. Consequently, gene neighborhoods in closely
related species that have been disrupted, and are therefore
loci of potential loss of function, can easily be detected
(see the second example below). Where gene rearrangements have occurred the conserved clusters of genes can
be readily identified by the homolog coloring display
method.

The PSAT homolog cluster score for a selected gene is
defined as the number of contiguous homolog neighbors
found in conserved order surrounding the homolog
match for this gene in another genome. Homologous protein sequences are determined by BLAST alignment [22]
with a user adjustable minimum alignment score threshold. Higher cluster scores suggest the existence of larger
conserved gene clusters and might reflect closer phylogenetic distances between genomes, or selective pressure for
gene clusters among genomes that share common proper-

The PSAT display draws all genomic features to scale,
including intergenic distances, and uses color to represent
homologous genes in the compared genomes to facilitate
identification of conserved gene clusters, rearrangements,
insertions, deletions and sequence inversion. In the
graphical display of each genome, which is aligned with
the 5' end of the query gene, PSAT distinguishes the
homologs with a common color (the rest of the genes are
grey). For the purpose of identifying conserved gene clusters, this method of display presents some advantage over

coloring genes based on role categories (see for example
the Comprehensive Microbial Resource [33]) or other
ontologies that represent broader concepts than sequence
homologs. The genomes in PSAT are ordered by decreasing homolog cluster scores and grouped by genus. This
hybrid method acknowledges the usefulness of phylogenetic information in some comparative genomic research
efforts as exemplified by the MicrobesOnline "Gene Tree"
display [34]. Conservation of gene clusters generally
reflects conservation of function and conserved gene
order suggests that the homologs in these sometimes distantly related clusters also share a similar function, and
thus may be orthologs. The "mouse over" feature in PSAT
provides annotation information and BLAST scores for
each of the homologous sequences to enable the user to
assess the evidence that might support orthology. Groups
of homologs that appear in a conserved order (and to a
lesser extent in the same location) across multiple
genomes provide additional evidence for gene orthology.
In particular, conserved gene order can strengthen very
weak evidence for gene orthology, especially where these
same clusters occur across several distantly related
genomes. In conclusion, PSAT's unique implementation
enables a sensitive analysis that can help discover
orthologs through conserved gene clusters that may be
missed by methods employing more stringent criteria.
Our experiences performing and assisting other researchers with comparative genomics studies inspired the devel-

opment of PSAT. We were therefore able to identify
multiple scenarios that we had encountered in such studies in which PSAT was or would have been helpful. Using
these scenarios as examples, we demonstrate here some of
the uses of PSAT and evaluate the tool's utility in assisting
with particular tasks. We also discuss some of our plans
for developing the tool further.
Identification of orthologs based on conserved gene order
among distant species
PSAT enables analyses that combine sequence homolog
and gene context data to provide evidence of gene orthology. Researchers often use gene orthologs to assist with
assigning genes a functional annotation. A genomic comparison study between closely related genomes can often
identify putative orthologs for the majority of genes to be
annotated. However, some genomes may not have a
closely related genome that has already been annotated,
or certain genes may not have an ortholog in a closely
related genome. A study of the genome of Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida U112, for example, revealed that
the gene FTN_0453 does not have any BLAST hits in the
other Francisella genomes. PSAT results indicated, however, that the gene is homologous to genes of other bacterial genera including Shewanella and Vibrio. Although the
sequence identity between FTN_0453 and these
homologs is modest, the PSAT visualization graphic also
indicated the gene may be involved in a potential gene
cluster (Figure 1). Further investigation of the literature

subspecies novicida U112 gene FTN_0453 does not have any homologous genes in other Francisella strains. The PSAT genomic
neighborhood browser, however, highlighted a gene cluster between F t novicida U112 and genomes from genera such as
Shewanella and Vibrio. The conserved order of the homologs provided secondary evidence that the genes in this cluster are
orthologs.

actually revealed experimental evidence suggesting the
involvement of the gene cluster in Shewanella oneidensis
with biofilm attachment and detachment [35]. This information may provide additional clues about the function
of the corresponding genes in F t novicida U112 and the
capabilities of the organism. Tools performing an analysis
among a more selective set of genomes or with less sensitivity may not have discovered the potential relationship.
Detection of a loss of function in a genome under study
Researchers can use PSAT to help detect a loss of function
within particular bacterial organisms or to investigate the
genetic basis of a known loss of function. When a cluster
of genes is known to be involved with a specific function,
an incomplete or disrupted cluster in certain genomes
may suggest a loss of function. An examination of such a
disruption can also provide clues to particular events
which may have led to the loss. For example, a comparative study of Francisella genomes involved investigation of
the conservation of the leu operon. This operon, which
includes the genes ilvE, leuA, leuC, leuD, and leuB, is
known to be involved with leucine biosynthesis in Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida U112. Performing a
PSAT analysis for these genes indicated that this cluster is
incomplete in the Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis SchuS4 strain, with an absence of leuC, leuD, and leuB,
suggesting that leucine biosynthesis is impaired in this
strain of the bacteria (Figure 2) [36]. Further investigation
into this interesting observation suggested specific IS element insertion events involved in the inactivation and
provided critical clues into the evolutionary history of various strains of the bacteria [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/170

Investigation of biological association between genes
An analysis of gene context across multiple genomes,
including those of distantly related species, can be useful
for an investigation of biological association between
genes. For example, PSAT enabled an exploration of the
genomic neighborhood of a putative sensor kinaseresponse regulator (SK-RR) pair in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coded by genes gltR and gltS. SK-RR gene pairs are
typically located next to each other and are also sometimes located next to genes for which they modulate transcription. PSAT revealed how the SK-RR pair is conserved
across genomes, including those from distantly related
species. In addition, the results show how the SK-RR pair
appears in a cluster of genes related to glucose metabolism
in many of these genomes (Figure 3). The observation that
these glucose transport and metabolism related genes are
frequently located in the neighborhood of gltR-gltS suggests that their regulation is controlled by the SK-RR.
These results effectively reflect past research showing that
gltR is needed to activate some of the genes related to glucose transport and metabolism [37].
Future Development
The PSAT web server's database of gene annotations and
sequence homologs enables the tool's efficient genomic
neighborhood comparative analysis and visualization features. The public server is currently loaded with a selected
set of reference bacterial genomes published through
NCBI. We plan to continue to load additional published
genomes into the tool in order to more broadly support
researchers studying different bacterial organisms. We
also recognize the importance of keeping the genome data
used by the public server up to date. We are therefore also
implementing an automated system for updating the

genes in this operon are missing in Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis SchuS4 suggesting that leucine biosynthesis may be
impaired in this strain of the bacteria.

database as new or modified genome annotations become
available through NCBI.
PSAT was originally designed for exploring homologs
within genomic neighborhoods to analyze gene order and
identify potential gene clusters among several genomes.
We recognize, however, that the database of genes and
protein sequence homologs that was built for this purpose
could be utilized for several other types of genomic analyses. We plan to, for example, leverage the database to add
a query interface to retrieve homology statistics from various genomes. Enabling researchers to determine the proportion of genes in a reference genome that have
homologs in several other genomes can provide a rough
comparison of genomic similarity and phylogenetic distances. Another feature we plan to implement is a querying method utilizing homology data for determining a
putative set of genes that are unique to a particular set of
genomes. This kind of analysis can help researchers identify a list of potential genes that appear, for example, in a
set of genomes belonging to virulent strains of a bacterium, yet not in a set of genomes belonging to avirulent
strains of the same bacterium.

Conclusion
As the number of bacterial genomes being sequenced,
annotated, and published quickly increases, so does the

potential for researchers to perform interesting comparative studies based on the available genomic data. The
PSAT web tool can be helpful for such comparative
genomics studies by providing researchers with an original interface to explore and compare the genomic neighborhoods of multiple prokaryotic genomes. Essential
features of the tool include efficient retrieval of homologs
between large numbers of genomes, a graphical visualization of homologs within genomic neighborhoods for analyzing gene order conservation, and options for ordering
and filtering results based on various properties to facilitate exploration of large result sets. We have demonstrated
how PSAT can be used to help identify gene orthologs,
detect a loss of function in a genome under study, and discover potential biological associations between genes.
Our publicly available PSAT web server currently supports
analysis of reference genomes from a subset of published
bacterial genomes, including selected genomes from the
Burkholderia, Escherichia, Francisella, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Yersinia genera, against over five hundred
other bacterial genomes available on NCBI. The PSAT
source code is also freely available for researchers to easily
set up local versions of PSAT to perform analyses of other
genomes, including those not yet released to the public.
