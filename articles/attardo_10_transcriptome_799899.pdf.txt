Transcriptome analysis of reproductive tissue and
intrauterine developmental stages of the tsetse
fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans)

Abstract
Background: Tsetse flies, vectors of African trypanosomes, undergo viviparous reproduction (the deposition of live
offspring). This reproductive strategy results in a large maternal investment and the deposition of a small number
of progeny during a female’s lifespan. The reproductive biology of tsetse has been studied on a physiological level;
however the molecular analysis of tsetse reproduction requires deeper investigation. To build a foundation from
which to base molecular studies of tsetse reproduction, a cDNA library was generated from female tsetse (Glossina
morsitans morsitans) reproductive tissues and the intrauterine developmental stages. 3438 expressed sequence tags
were sequenced and analyzed.
Results: Analysis of a nonredundant catalogue of 1391 contigs resulted in 520 predicted proteins. 475 of these
proteins were full length. We predict that 412 of these represent cytoplasmic proteins while 57 are secreted.
Comparison of these proteins with other tissue specific tsetse cDNA libraries (salivary gland, fat body/milk gland,
and midgut) identified 51 that are unique to the reproductive/immature cDNA library. 11 unique proteins were
homologus to uncharacterized putative proteins within the NR database suggesting the identification of novel
genes associated with reproductive functions in other insects (hypothetical conserved). The analysis also yielded
seven putative proteins without significant homology to sequences present in the public database (unknown
genes). These proteins may represent unique functions associated with tsetse’s viviparous reproductive cycle. RTPCR analysis of hypothetical conserved and unknown contigs was performed to determine basic tissue and stage
specificity of the expression of these genes.
Conclusion: This paper identifies 51 putative proteins specific to a tsetse reproductive/immature EST library. 11 of
these proteins correspond to hypothetical conserved genes and 7 proteins are tsetse specific.

Background
Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are important agricultural and medical vectors responsible for the transmission of African trypanosomes, the agents of sleeping
sickness disease in humans and nagana in animals.
Human sleeping sickness has resurged in Africa necessitating the development and reevaluation of control strategies [1]. In the past, vector population control has
been a successful strategy in reduction of trypanosome
transmission. In particular, the success of population
reduction based control strategies has resulted from the
low reproductive potential of tsetse flies. The knowledge

gained from molecular aspects of tsetse reproductive
biology has the potential to yield new insights important
for increasing the efficiency and decreasing the cost and
complexity of the currently available tool set.
Tsetse has a unique reproductive physiology and
developmental cycle. They undergo viviparous reproduction (intrauterine development and parturition of live
offspring). Viviparous reproduction has arisen independently in other flies and in other orders of insects [2].
This process is specialized in tsetse. In tsetse the entire
larval developmental cycle is intrauterine and the
mother supplies nutrients to her offspring in the form
of a milk secretion from a specialized gland (milk gland)
[3]. Female flies develop a single larva at a time. As a
result a single female has the capacity to generate ~8

offspring in her lifecycle. This is significantly less than
most other Diptera, such as mosquitoes, that are capable
of generating hundreds of offspring in the span of a single life cycle. The low reproductive rate in tsetse represents a potential target for vector control as disruption
of this process could have dramatic effects on population density.
Previous gene discovery projects for tsetse have
focused on the adult fat body/milk gland [4], midgut [5]
and salivary gland [6] organs in the tsetse species Glossina morsitans morsitans. Multiple genes with potential
importance for the reproductive cycle were identified in
the fat body/milk gland library analysis. In particular
four cDNAs have been characterized in more detail and
identified as proteins synthesized by the milk gland for
larval nourishment. These proteins include the major
milk protein (gmmmgp1) [7], transferrin (gmmtsf) [8],
milk gland protein 2 (gmmmgp2) and milk gland protein
3 (gmmmgp3) [9].
In order to perform an in depth study of reproduction
associated genes, a new cDNA library was generated
with a pool of mRNA from reproductive tissues (uterus,
ovaries and spermathica) and intrauterine larvae at all
stages of development (embryo 1 st , 2nd and 3rd instar
larvae). cDNAs from this library were randomly
sequenced and resulting sequences were manually annotated. Many of the annotated sequences were orthologous to genes associated with oogenesis, embryogenesis
and larvigenesis in other insects. Comparison of this
library with other tsetse tissue specific libraries was
informative in the identification of reproductive specific
transcripts with uncharacterized orthologs in other
insects, as well as transcripts of putative genes that
show no homology to any genes in the NCBI nonredundant database.

Results and discussion
General description of the reproductive/immature cDNA
library

A total of 3438 ESTs were sequenced from the reproductive library of which 3048 were used for contig generation after quality control screening. Following
assembly, the total number of unique contigs derived
from the ESTs was 1391. Average length of the contigs
was 1125 bp with a maximum of 5302 bp and a minimum of 88 bp.
The contigs from this library were combined with EST
sequence data from the other tissue specific tsetse
cDNA libraries. The combined library consists of 16509
contigs derived from published cDNA libraries including
adult fat body/milk gland [4], midgut [5], salivary gland
(in press) and the reproductive/immature ESTs
described here. After assembly, reproductive/immature
library specific contigs were identified and annotated.

Analysis and categorization of proteins extrapolated
from reproductive/immature EST sequences was performed (Figure 1). There were a total of 520 unique
putative proteins identified in the reproductive/immature cDNA library; 475 transcripts represented fulllength cDNAs, 41 were truncated and 4 were fragments.
Identification of signal peptides and anchoring motifs
associated with the putative proteins predicted that 412
are cytoplasmic proteins, 57 have signal peptides suggesting secretion and 18 are anchored to the cell membrane. Results for the 33 remaining sequences were
difficult to interpret due to the fact that they were either
fragments or the results were ambiguous.
The profile of this library shows that hypothetical conserved proteins constitute 13% of the entire library, followed by proteins associated with metabolism and
protein synthesis at 10% and 11%, respectively. The
categories that had the highest number of transcripts
differed from the ones that had the highest number of
actual genes. Factors associated with protein synthesis
were the most highly expressed in the library with 416
transcripts, followed by cytoskeletal genes at 206 transcripts and then reproductive proteins at 188 transcripts.
These results are logical as reproductive tissues and
immature stages synthesize a large amount of protein
for oogenesis, embryogenesis and nutrient storage. High
levels of expression of cytoskeletal genes such as tubulin
and actin are required for the cellular changes undergone during oogenesis, embryogenesis and larvigenesis.
Genes classified as reproductive encode proteins associated with processes such as vitellogenesis, embryonic
development and larvigenesis. The reproductive classification was determined by homology to previously identified tsetse genes or to orthologs associated with these
processes in other insects.
Predicted proteins unique to the Reproductive/immature library were categorized and EST abundance for
the categories was calculated (Figure 2). After filtration
of nonspecific sequences, 51 library specific predicted
proteins remained. Within this subgroup, reproduction
associated genes contributed to 33% of the ESTs. This
group of genes also had the highest number of transcripts among reproductive tract/immature exclusive
genes with 169 transcripts. The second and third most
abundant EST categories were hypothetical conserved
(11) and unknown genes (7) with the second and third
highest number of transcripts, 51 and 17, respectively.
The hypothetical conserved genes are of interest, as
these genes are likely associated with reproduction in
not only tsetse but in other insects as well. Characterization of these genes could provide new insights into processes associated with reproduction and development in
insects. There were seven unknown genes, which
returned no significant homologues from the NCBI

database and thus appear to be unique to tsetse. Analysis of these genes and their products has the potential
to reveal novel functions and processes associated with
viviparous reproduction. These gene products may constitute potential targets for population control strategies.
As these genes may be unique to tsetse, they may pose
very specific targets for control mechanisms interrupting
the viviparous reproductive cycle of tsetse.
Protein orthologs expressed exclusively in the
reproductive/immature library: Table 1 (Additional file 1)

With the exception of cDNAs encoding unknown proteins, the rest of the library was orthologous to putative
proteins identfied in the NCBI non-redundant database.
The majority of the genes were most closely related to
orthologs from Drosophila species (81%). This is not
unexpected as Drosophila is well characterized and is
closely related to tsetse (both are on the suborder

Brachycera/Muscomorpha) relative to other flies such as
mosquitoes (which are Nematocera) [10]. We focused
our analysis on tsetse cDNAs expressed exclusively in
this library to identify putative proteins associated with
tsetse’s unique reproductive and developmental biology.
Nuclear regulation: Reproductive specific histones

We identified two putative histones limited to the reproductive library. Histone composition of nucleosomes has
been shown to change in different tissues and at different developmental stages in Drosophila [11]. One of the
histones (EZ421930) appears to be homologous to Histone H1. This particular orthologue of H1 could be
associated with regulation of genomic DNA structure
during specific developmental events in the developing
oocyte or the developing embryo.
The second histone is homologous to histone H3
(EZ421945). A reproduction specific H3 variant (H3.3)
appears to play a role in oocyte and embryonic

development in mice. This variant is a maternal factor
provided to the oocyte and is localized to active regions
of the genome. It is thought to be associated with epigenetic reprogramming [12].
Protein export: gamma-SNAP

An important process that occurs during oogenesis in
insects is vitellogenesis, the secretion of yolk proteins
from either fat body cells or ovarian follicle cells and
the uptake of those yolk proteins into the oocyte for use
as raw materials during embryonic development. This
process requires the transport of protein(s) across the
membrane of the cell producing the protein (in the case
of tsetse the ovarian follicle cells) and the membrane of
the developing oocyte. A reproductive specific protein
homologus to the SNAP family of proteins was identified in the library (EZ421968). In vertebrates, the SNAP

proteins are required for formation of the SNARE complex which promotes the fusion of membrane lipid
bilayers [13-15]. As the primary function of this protein
is to mediate exocytosis and is specific to this library, it
is a logical assumption that it may be a component in
the machinery necessary for vitellogenesis. Further study
of this gene could yield insights into the mechanisms
yolk protein secretion and vitellogenesis.
Lipid metabolism/hormone synthesis: 17-betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3

Two of the library exclusive cDNAs identified
(EZ421953 and EZ421957) appear to be orthologues of
a 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Drosophila
melanogaster. These enzymes are associated with the
biosynthesis and inactivation of steroid hormones [16].
Although the two cDNAs code for similar proteins, they

Attardo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:160
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/160

appear to represent unique genes. Steroid hormones are
associated with regulation of egg development in other
insects. The role of steroid hormone function in tsetse
reproduction is unknown. Analysis of these genes is a
potential starting point for this area of research.
Yolk proteins

Vitellogenesis is a major process associated with egg
development. It is the synthesis and deposition of yolk
proteins into a developing oocyte. Characterization of
vitellogenesis was previously performed in Glossina [7],
where a yolk protein gene identified from a fat body/
milk gland tissue library was characterized and found to
be predominantly expressed in the reproductive tract. In
nematoceran flies such as mosquitoes, yolk proteins are
generated by the fat body. In contrast, Cyclorrhaphan
flies such as D. melanogaster and Sarcophaga bullata
express their yolk proteins from both the fat body and
the follicle cells of the ovary. In Glossina yolk proteins
appear to be predominantly expressed in the ovary and
are likely expressed from the follicle cells. This particular gene is one of a few that has a large number of
representative ESTs present in this library (16) relative
to other library specific genes. This observation supports
our previous characterization as well as observations by
[17] that GmmYP is an ovary specific gene and is the
only yolk protein identified in Glossina. Multiple yolk
proteins have been identified and compared in D. melanogaster, Musca domestica and Sarcophaga bullata
[18-20].
Gonadal proteases

Other important constituents of oocyte yolk are proteases required for the metabolism of yolk proteins and
activation of other proteases during embryogenesis. One
of the library specific genes appears to be homologous
to a trypsin type protease (EZ421932). This trypsin
could either be a component of the yolk or a larval midgut specific trypsin as the library does contain transcripts from immature stages. Other trypsin like
transcripts were also identified (EZ421964 and
EZ421960), however these transcripts were truncated
making it difficult to perform a complete analysis. Phylogenetic comparison of trypsin EZ421932 with a previously identified midgut specific trypsin from Glossina
suggests that these genes developed independently from
each other (Figure 3a). Orthologs of the library specific
trypsin were identified in other fly species. None of the
homologues had been previously characterized. Alignment of this trypsin with its homologues and with midgut specific trypsins reveals structural conservation of
key residues associated with the trypsin active site, substrate binding site and proteolytic cleavage site (Figure
3b). The two protein clades differ significantly in the Nterminal region of the protein. This region may be associated with secretion and/or activation of these trypsins.

Chorion proteins

Two putative chorion proteins (EZ421949 and
EZ421934) were identified as library specific and are
orthologus to chorion proteins from Drosophila. The
protein encoded by EZ421949 is closely related to chorion protein 38 and is likely a component of the endochorion as it undergoes transcriptional activation in
Drosophila oocytes late in oocyte development [21].
RNA localization

Correct localization of nurse cell generated maternal
RNA within the developing oocyte is required for dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior patterning and positioning of primordial germ cells in the developing
embryo. A cDNA that is strongly orthologous to the
Drosophila gene tsunagi was identified in the database
(EZ421943). Tsunagi is a RNA binding protein that
forms a complex with another protein called Mago
Nashi. In Drosophila Tsunagi knockout phenotypes
show failure of the oocyte nucleus to migrate, the
maternal mRNA oskar does not localize to the posterior
pole and dorsal/ventral patterning abnormalities occur
[22].
Apterous

There are many transcription factors associated with
embryonic development in insects. The ortholog for one
of these factors (encoded by a gene called apterous (ap)
in Drosophila) was identified as a library specific transcript (EZ421958). The effects of the knockout of this
gene in Drosophila are an absence of wing and haltere
development, absence of development of a group of
embryonic muscles and juvenile hormone deficiency due
to defects in secretory cells in the corpora allata. Indirect effects due to the absence of juvenile hormone
include female sterility due to arrest of oogenesis,
abnormal larval fat body breakdown, aberrant sexual
behavior and premature death in adults [23].
Study of this factor and its effects on the development
of the tsetse endocrine system (specifically the corpora
allata) could yield important information on how juvenile hormone regulates oogenesis and pregnancy in
tsetse.
Doublecortin

An essential factor for the development of the embryonic brain and nervous system is a protein called Doublecortin (dcx). Mutations in this gene in mammalian
systems result in disruption of cortical neuronal migration [24]. An orthologous cDNA to dcx was identified
as a library specific gene. A thorough investigation of
how this gene functions in invertebrates has yet to be
performed.
Cuticular proteins

A group of proteins associated with larval development
that were exclusive to this library were cuticular proteins. Three putative proteins were identified

followed by manual adjustments. Phylogenetic tree construction and bootstrap analysis were performed with MEGA 3.1.

(EZ421946, EZ421965 and EZ421951), two of which
(EZ421946 and EZ421951) are orthologous to ecdysone
dependant pupal cuticle proteins. Previous work has
been performed on tsetse cuticle proteins expressed during the different developmental stages [25]. It was
observed that a large number of proteins are synthesized
by the late third instar larvae relative to first and second
instar larvae. This is logical as the intrauterine environment is hydrated and protective thereby not requiring
the larva to protect itself from a hostile environment.
The burst of expression of third instar cuticle proteins
could be associated with larvae that are preparing for
the stresses of parturition, wandering and pupation.
Fat body protein 2

Another transcript identified in the analysis of the
library is an ortholog to the fat body Protein 2 (FBP2)
gene (EZ421940) which is homologous to an alcohol
dehydrogenase protein (ADH). This protein is thought
to assist in the degradation of the fat body during metamorphosis [26].
Hexamerins

Hexamerins (Arylphorins) are larva specific storage proteins. Two hexamerin/arylphorin type proteins were
identified as library specific (EZ421969/EZ421959 and
EZ421955). These cDNAs were very abundant relative to
other unique genes with representative EST abundance
of 23 and 4 transcripts respectively. Phylogenetic analysis
of EZ421969/EZ421959 was performed with hexamerins
from other insect species and a hemocyanin from crabs
as an outgroup (Figure 4). Tsetse hexamerin forms a
group with the other cyclorrhaphan flies (Drosophila and
Musca domestica) and then on a larger scale with the
nematoceran diptera (mosquitoes). The next closest
group is the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) followed
by the Coleoptera (beetles). This is followed by the more
primitive hemimetabolus insects, Plecoptera (stoneflies),
Dictyoptera (cockroaches and termites) and Orthoptera
(grasshoppers). The relationship between these proteins
follows that predicted by current morphological and
molecular systematic analysis of insects at the “Tree of
Life “http://tolweb.org/tree/“ [27]. Phylogenetic analysis
of these genes shows them to be informative from a taxonomic viewpoint as there are many hexamerin proteins
present in the NCBI database. They are also of biological
interest as they are developmentally and tissue specifically regulated [28] and are essential for the transition
from immature to the adult stages of development.
Tissue and developmental specificity analysis of unknown
and hypothetical conserved genes: Table 2 (Additional
file 2)

The search for library specific sequences revealed 18
hypothetical conserved and unknown genes. Of these
genes 11 hypothetical conserved and 7 unknown gene

Page 7 of 10

sequences were identified. To verify the specificity of
these transcripts RT-PCR analysis was performed using
cDNAs from pupa, larva, reproductive tract (ovaries,
uterus, spermathica) and the remaining carcass mRNA
from 10 adult flies at varying ages (Table 2). The
cDNAs used in this assay were generated from tissue
samples independent of the ones used to generate the
library. None of the genes were expressed in the carcass,
confirming their library specific nature. A total of seven
genes, five hypothetical conserved (EZ421939,
EZ421950, EZ421936, EZ421937 and EZ421938) and
two unknowns (EZ421944 and EZ421929) were found
to be exclusive to the reproductive tract. These proteins
could be associated with functions in adult tissues such
as the ovaries (oogenesis), uterus or spermatheca. Identification of signal peptides and transmembrane domains
in these proteins offer clues for their localization and
function. EZ421939 and EZ421950 both have predicted
secretion signals suggesting that these proteins are
secreted from the reproductive tract. Neither EZ421936
nor EZ421937 have signal peptides; however they both
have one transmembrane domain, with 76% of the protein predicted to be extracellular.
Three hypothetical conserved genes (EZ421923,
EZ421935 and EZ421956) were identified as larva specific. All three putative proteins contain signal peptides
suggesting secretion. A hypothetical conserved gene was
found to be pupa specific (EZ421925) and has a predicted signal peptide and two transmembrane domains
with 50% of the protein predicted to be extracellular.
EZ421954 was detectable in both reproductive tract and
larva and has a secretion signal.
Finally, three unknown genes were expressed in both
larva and pupa specific cDNAs (EZ421961, EZ422129 and
EZ421927). The localization of EZ421961 and EZ422129
could not be determined as they are partial cDNAs.
Hypothetical and unknown genes are of particular
interest as they encode proteins either present in other
systems with yet unknown functions, or proteins completely novel to the tsetse system. The evolutionary biology of the unknown genes is of particular interest.
Determination of the origins and functions of these proteins will be important to understanding the evolutionary process by which tsetse developed viviparous
reproduction. This line of research can also yield the
identification of tsetse specific target genes, which could
be blocked to disrupt reproduction with minimal environmental effects.

Conclusions
Determining tsetse’s transcriptome from the reproductive/immature cDNA library has yielded new information on putative proteins expressed in the reproductive
tract and immature intrauterine developmental stages of

tsetse. Information associated with similar proteins characterized in other organisms can now be placed into the
context of tsetse’s reproductive and developmental biology to elucidate its reproductive physiology. This will be
important to understand how these genes have been
adapted to perform in a viviparous system. Also of
importance is the identification of genes orthologous in
other organisms that remain uncharacterized, as well as
the identification of genes entirely novel to tsetse. Analysis and characterization of these genes will reveal
information fundamental to insect reproduction and
development. Given the low reproductive capacity of
tsetse, molecular data on reproduction specific processes
has the potential to reveal novel mechanisms which
could be exploited to control tsetse population levels
and trypanosomiasis transmission.

Methods
Tsetse

The Glossina morsitans morsitans colony maintained in
the insectary at Yale University was originally established from puparia from fly populations in Zimbabwe.
Flies are maintained at 24 ± 1°C with 50-55% relative
humidity, and receive defibrinated bovine blood every
48 h using an artificial membrane system [29].

Tissue collection and RNA extraction

Reproductive tissues and immature developmental
stages were dissected from female flies at various
stages of pregnancy. Dissections were performed in
PBS and tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C. Reproductive tissues included
ovaries, uterus and spermathica. Immature stages
included embryo, first, second and third instar larvae.
Total RNA was isolated from samples using TRIzol ®
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA library construction, sequencing, EST clustering and
data analysis

The library was commercially constructed in Express 1
vector from 1 mg of total RNA derived from reproductive tissues and immature developmental stages (OPEN
biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Each clone was sequenced
using a T3 or T7 primer using ABI Big Dye terminator
kits on an ABI 3730 sequencing machine. ESTs were
trimmed of primer and vector sequences, clustered and
compared with other databases as has been described
previously [30]. The entire database can be downloaded
from the Aksoy lab website http://aksoylab.yale.edu/
Links.html.

Attardo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:160
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/160

Functional annotation of the transcripts were performed using BLASTX to compare nucleotide sequences
to the NR protein database at NCBI [31] as well as to
KOG [32] and GO [33] databases. Detection of conserved protein domains was performed using rpsBLAST
[34] and Pfam [35]. The predicted protein translations
were submitted to the SignalP server to help identify
those products that could be secreted [36]. We compared these transcripts to several proteomes obtained
from Flybase [37] (D. melanogaster) and ENSEMBL [38]
(An. gambiae).
A subsequent tsetse EST assembly of the combined
EST data dated 12/17/2008 has been produced by the
International Glossina Genomics Initiative (IGGI) consortium and is available at http://www.genedb.org. The
contig sequences in this paper reference the identifiers
assigned in the initial clustering. The tables included in
this manuscript and supplementary spreadsheets include
the analogous GeneDB identifiers and hyperlinks to the
appropriate data pages for each sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the library specific hexamerin
and trypsin genes was performed via multiple steps.
Putative orthologues were identified by PSI-BLAST [34]
search of the NCBI NR database and compiled within a
FASTA file. Sequences were aligned using standalone
ClustalX software [39]. Alignments were hand edited in
BioEdit [40]. Incomplete and poorly aligned sequences
were removed. Phylogenetic tree construction and bootstrap analysis were performed in MEGA 3.1 [41].
RT-PCR expression analysis

cDNA pools used for RT-PCR analysis were generated
from total RNA isolated from reproductive tract (uterus,
spermathica and ovaries), 1st - 3 rd instar larvae, pupa
and the remaining carcass after removal of reproductive
tract and intrauterine offspring. Total RNA was isolated
from samples using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. One
μg of total RNA from each sample was used to synthesize each pool of cDNA using the Superscript Double
Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Tubulin
levels were used to determine the dilution factor and
final amount of cDNA from each pool used in the PCR
reactions. After equilibration with tubulin, PCR analysis
was performed with primers specific to each of the
hypothetical conserved and unknown proteins identified
within the library. Primer sequences used for the RTPCR analysis are listed in Additional File 3. PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 3 minutes (1×), 95°C for
30 secs, 60°C for 45 secs, 72°C for 1 min (25×) and 72°C
for 5 min (1×). PCR products were run on a 1% agarose
gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Presence or

absence of transcript was determined by visual examination of gel staining. Primer sequences are included in
the primer list supplementary file.
