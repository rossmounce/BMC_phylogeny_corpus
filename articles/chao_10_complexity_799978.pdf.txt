Complexity of cis-regulatory organization of six3a
during forebrain and eye development in
zebrafish
Chung-Hao Chao1,2, Horng-Dar Wang2, Chiou-Hwa Yuh1,3,4*

Abstract
Background: Six3a belongs to the SIX family of homeodomain proteins and is expressed in the most anterior
neural plate at the beginning of neurogenesis in various species. Though the function of Six3a as a crucial
regulator of eye and forebrain development has been thoroughly investigated, the transcriptional regulation of
six3a is not well understood.
Results: To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of six3a, we performed an in vivo reporter assay. Alignment of
the 21-kb region surrounding the zebrafish six3a gene with the analogous region from different species identified
several conserved non-coding modules. Transgenesis in zebrafish identified two enhancer elements and one
suppressor. The D module drives the GFP reporter in the forebrain and eyes at an early stage, while the A module
is responsible for the later expression. The A module also works as a repressor suppressing ectopic expression from
the D module. Mutational analysis further minimized the A module to four highly conserved elements and the D
module to three elements. Using electrophoresis mobility shift assays, we also provided evidence for the presence
of DNA-binding proteins in embryonic nuclear extracts. The transcription factors that may occupy those highly
conserved elements were also predicted.
Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive view of six3a transcription regulation during brain and eye
development and offers an opportunity to establish the gene regulatory networks underlying neurogenesis in
zebrafish.

Background
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has long been an excellent vertebrate model organism for developmental biology [1-3]
and is used to study the mechanisms of axis formation
[4], endoderm differentiation [3,5] and muscle development [6]. It was also recently suggested to be an excellent model system for eye genetics [7]. Development is
controlled by the hierarchical regulation between signaling pathways and transcription factors. The basic operating principle for specifying a territory or regulatory
state is controlled coordinately by transcription factors
and signal transduction machinery in the cis-regulatory
code. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for early embryogenesis have been established in sea urchin mesendoderm [8], Xenopus endoderm [9], Drosophila dorsal/

ventral polarity [10] and zebrafish mesendoderm [11]. It
is essential to decode the cis-regulatory operation for
the key transcription regulators contributing to the
GRNs to elucidate the development of tissues and
organs.
The Sine Oculis Homeobox (SIX) proteins share two
evolutionarily conserved functional motifs in which the
115 amino acid SIX protein-protein interaction domain
is located just upstream of the homeobox DNA binding
domain [12,13]. Disrupting the SIX domain or the
homeodomain abolishes the ability of Six3a to induce
rostral forebrain enlargement in zebrafish, implying that
these domains are essential for six3 gene function [14].
However, it also has been suggested that part of the biochemical and functional specificity between members of
the SIX protein family is due to their non-conserved
C-terminal segments [15].

Six3 is a member of the SIX family and is expressed in
the most rostral portion of the brain in many animals.
The first member of the SIX family, sine oculis (so), was
identified in Drosophila [16], and later, six3 was discovered in many other species, including mouse [16], chick
[17], zebrafish [14], medaka [18] and Xenopus [19].
Together with the products of other homeobox genes,
such as Otx [20] and Emx [21], Six3 plays a central role
in the patterning of forebrain and eye development
[22-25]. The function of Six3a in the development of
the forebrain and eyes has been demonstrated in many
species. Overexpression of six3 induces rostral forebrain
enlargement in zebrafish and promotes ectopic lens formation [14] and ectopic retinal primordia formation in
medaka [26] and Xenopus [27]. The telencephalon of
six3a and six3b double morphant embryos is markedly
reduced in size, owing to impaired cell proliferation
[28]. In humans, study of severe malformation of the
brain identified that mutations in the homeodomain of
the Six3 gene may relate to holoprosencephaly [29-31].
Therefore, previous studies suggest a conserved function
for Six3 in eye and forebrain development in metazoans.
The transcriptional regulation of six3a has been investigated previously (e.g., olSix3.2 in the developing
medaka forebrain [32] and six3.1 in zebrafish retina and
forebrain [33]). However, the minimal binding elements
and the transcription factors were not identified in
those studies. The negative regulator for forebrain specification, LOM4b, has also been found [25], but how it
regulates six3a in terms of binding sites is not known.
Several eye-field transcription factors (EFTFs) are
expressed in a dynamic, overlapping pattern in the presumptive eye and forebrain. A genetic network regulating vertebrate eye field specification has been proposed
in Xenopus using a combination of subsets of (EFTFs)
and functional (inductive) analysis [34].
To delineate the network of trans-acting factors that
control the evolutionarily conserved activity of six3a
during forebrain development, we studied the function
of the conserved non-coding regions in zebrafish six3a.
Functionally important regions in the genome usually
evolve more slowly than non-functional regions due to
selective pressure. Alignment of conserved non-coding
DNA sequences among different species using bioinformatics tools (e.g., the UCSC genome browser) provides
a useful method for identifying the important regulatory
elements of a gene (Chen and Blanchette, 2007; Werner
et al., 2007). To facilitate the identification of functionally important elements in six3a, we applied the same
strategy as for conserved non-coding regions. We took
advantage of the power of computational analysis, the
availability of the zebrafish genome sequence, and the
efficiency of embryo transgenesis to analyze the regulatory control of one of the two six3 homologs in

zebrafish, six3a. Elucidating the regulation of six3a and
identifying the transcription factors responsible for correct expression of six3a helps to show how the gene is
regulated and reveals the comprehensive gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) for forebrain and eye specification
across all vertebrates.

Results
Identification of the cis-regulatory modules for six3a
expression in zebrafish

Both medaka and zebrafish have Six3 duplications. We
aligned 14 protein sequences for the Six3 homologs
(Additional file 1) and performed phylogenetic analysis
(Additional file 2). From the protein sequence comparison, we found that zebrafish Six3a is more similar to
medaka Six3.2 (85% identity) than to Six3.1 (75% identity). From the phylogenetic analysis, medaka Six3.2 and
zebrafish Six3a were the closest homologs, while medaka
Six3.1 was more closely related to zebrafish Six3b.
To identify the cis-regulatory modules responsible for
zebrafish six3a expression, we first aligned 21 kb of
DNA (spanning from -12 kb to +9 kb of the zebrafish
six3a transcription initiation site) with the corresponding sequences from Tetraodon, Xenopus tropicalis, opossum, mouse and human. We used the 2006 version of
the UCSC genome browser to identify conserved
regions. If conservation appeared in more than four species, it was regarded as highly conserved, and if conservation was seen in less than two species, it was regarded
as less conserved. Excluding the six3a coding region
(two exons labeled E1 and E2 in red boxes), ten conserved non-coding modules (blue boxes) and the basal
promoter (orange box) were identified (Fig. 1A). The
transcriptional regulation of the six3a homolog in
medaka (olSix3.2) was investigated previously by Conte
and Bovolenta [32], who analyzed the 4.5-kb upstream
sequence from olsix3.2 [32]. For ease and consistency,
we used the same nomenclature for the modules that
have equivalent positions as olsix3.2. Therefore, we have
modules A through D, which were similar to Box A
through D in the work of Conte et al. We have included
the medaka sequence for comparison in Fig. 1B. The
basal promoter (Bp) actually overlapped with Box I and
L of olsix3.2. Box E and G of olsix3.2 matched to the
sequence of zsix3a, but were not among our conserved
modules; Box C and H of olsix3.2 did not match the
zsix3a sequence. We illustrated the relationship of the
genomic sequence of medaka olsix3.2 verses zebrafish
zsix3a in Fig. 1B. To avoid confusion, we used different
nomenclature for the modules identified through the
UCSC genome browser cross-species comparison. Modules 1, 2, and 3 are located upstream from module A;
module 4 is located in the intronic region; and modules
5 and 6 are in the downstream area. Modules B and C

and 6. Bp represents the basal promoter, shown by an orange block. Modules 1, A and 5 are conserved among all species, modules 2 and 3
show minor conservation and the remaining modules have low sequence similarity among species. The 4.5-kb upstream sequence from medaka

were not highly conserved. However, we tested their
function because of a previous study by Anders Fjoseâs
lab that demonstrated that a possible Pax6.1 binding site
on module F and a putative Brn3b binding site on module E are important for regulating six3a [33].
Brn3 and Pax6.1 binding sites on modules B and C
contain no enhancer function in the forebrain or eyes up
to 24 hpf

To determine if the expression of zebrafish six3a is
regulated by these conserved modules, a zebrafish
six3a BAC clone (DKEY-254J21) was purchased from
the BACPAC Resource Center (BPRC) and used as a
template for PCR. Each module was PCR amplified
from six3a BAC DNA using specific forward and
reverse primers, and cloned into the pEGFPN1 vector
to generate different GFP reporter constructs (Fig. 2-I,
Fig. 3-I, Fig. 4-I and Fig. 5-I). The primers for amplifying those modules are listed in Additional file 3, and
the sequence of each module is shown in Additional
file 4. The GFP expression reporter constructs were
individually injected into one-cell stage zebrafish

embryos, and GFP expression patterns and images
were captured at 8, 11 and 24 hpf. We report GFP
expression in transiently transgenic embryos by two
different criteria. The number of cells that express GFP
per embryo is indicated by plus (+) and minus (-) signs
(Fig. 2-I, Fig. 3-I, Fig. 4-I and Fig. 5-I). The percentages
of embryos that expressed GFP are shown in bar
graphs (Fig. 2-II, Fig. 3-II, Fig. 4-II and Fig. 5-II).
Representative images are shown for each construct
(Fig. 2-III, Fig. 3-III, Fig. 4-III and Fig. 5-III).
We first performed deletion analysis to search for the
important elements. The genomic sequence spanning
from -3782 to +110, containing modules A-D and Bp,
was fused with GFP (Fig. 2-I). Transgenesis analysis
showed that this 4-kb fragment (3087-Bp) expressed
GFP accurately at all stages (Fig. 2-II-A). This is similar
to the results by Bovolenta in medaka six3.2, in which
the 4.5-kb fragment was responsible for six3.2 expression. Serial deletion mutants demonstrated that the
genomic sequence that started from module D (1060Bp, Fig. 3-II-C) exhibited a strong expression pattern
similar to the 4-kb fragment (3087-Bp, Fig. 3-II-A).

However, the sequence containing modules B and C (B:
C-Bp) had no enhancer function in the forebrain or eyes
up to 24 hpf (Fig. 2). The six3a promoter analysis by
Wargelius et al. indicates that the retinal enhancer at 48
hpf is located in the 1.2-kb fragment between -3302 and
-1409, which contains both Brn3 and Pax6.1 binding
sites. Our B:C module (-2932 to ~ -1692) overlapped
with this 1.2-kb fragment. It is possible that module B:
C-Bp functions late only in the retina.
The 1060â³42-Bp and 1060-Bp constructs (Fig. 3-II-C)
displayed the same activity, indicating that the 42 bp in
module D can be excised without change of function
(the sequence is shown in Fig. 5 black box). Although
1060â³42-Bp exhibits very strong activity, 898-bp shows
much lower expression both early and late (Fig. 2), indicating that the sequence differences between these constructs (-1755 to -1594) contributed dramatically to the
transcription of six3a. This sequence contains two DNA
fragments that were shown to have no enhancement
function in other constructs, part of the B:C module
(-1755 to -1693) and the 42 bp in module D (-1646 to
-1605). Thus, the most important elements in module D
were minimized to the 46-bp region (-1692 to -1647).
From electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we
also found that the 46-bp region interacted with proteins present in the 24 hpf nuclear extracts (data shown
in the EMSA section).
From our serial deletion mutants, the sequence
between 681-Bp (Fig. 3-II-F) and 448-Bp (Fig. 3-II-G)
seemed to contribute, to some degree, to GFP expression at 24 hpf. Half of the embryos bearing the 681-Bp
construct expressed GFP at 24 hpf in the forebrain, but
448-Bp is very similar to Bp, and only 4% of embryos
expressed GFP. This region actually contains the Box E
discovered by Bovolentaâs lab, which is a late neural and
retinal enhancer in medaka six3.2 [32]. Consistent with
their discovery, our results suggested that a booster
enhancer is located between 681-Bp and 448-Bp.
Identification of modules D and A, together with the
basal promoter, as early and late enhancers

From our cross-species comparison, we identified ten
conserved non-coding modules. We then tested the
function of individual modules by transgenesis. First, we
tried to identify the basal promoter. From our transgenesis results, we found that the sequence from -694
to +110 drove weak GFP expression restricted to 1-3
cells in the forebrain, which was only observed at
24 hpf. The expression rate of the Bp was about 10%
(Fig. 3-III-A), suggesting that this region only has weak
promoter activity. Thus, we named it âbasal promoterâ,
which contains the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3-I,
black arrow). Wargelius et al. found that the zebrafish
six3a sequence between 805 and 236 bp upstream of

Page 8 of 18

the ATG is required for early expression. Our results
showed that a similar sequence located in the basal promoter (695 bp from the first exon) has a basal level of
transcription activation up to 24 hpf, consistent with
Wargeliusâs discovery. Conte et al. found that the
sequence upstream of the translation start site in
medaka six3.2 (Boxes I and L) is responsible for brain
expression at later stages (stages 24 to 40) [32]. Because
the stages of our study were early compared to Wargeliusâs [33], we cannot conclude that the basal promoter
does not have an enhancer function at later stages as
discovered in medaka.
Embryos injected with modules 1, 3, B, C, 4, 5 or 6
individually showed expression patterns similar to that
of the basal promoter. Only 5-22% of embryos carrying
these constructs expressed low levels of GFP, as shown
in Fig. 3-III-B for module 1. In spite of the sequence
conservation, modules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 did not appear to
contribute to the spatio-temporal control of six3a in
zebrafish, at least up to 24 hpf. Interestingly, neither
module B nor C was functional. Previously, a possible
Pax6.1 binding site in module B and a putative Brn3b
binding site in module C were shown to be important
for regulating six3a in zebrafish, but this was not found
in our study. Again, these results were consistent with
the deletion analysis described earlier.
Module 2 of six3a increased the expression of GFP in
embryos to 53% compared to 5% with Bp alone (Fig. 2III-C); however, the results from eight batches of
embryos were inconsistent (Additional file 5). Module A
and D enhanced Bp expression dramatically, and the
results from eight batches of experiments were consistent (Additional file 5). Fig. 3-III-B shows the strongest
expression pattern of module 2. Half of the time, module 2 resulted in no expression. On the other hand, the
expression pattern from modules A and D were always
âstrongly expressed in a large number of cellsâ, but the
expression from modules 1, 3, B, C, 4, 5 and 6 were
always âexpressed in only a few cellsâ. Embryos injected
with module A showed GFP expression in the forebrain
and eyes from 14 hpf (data not shown). At 24 hpf, GFP
was strongly expressed in the forebrain and retina (Fig.
3-III-D).
Because zebrafish six3a is expressed from 6 hpf and
constitutively expressed in the neuroectoderm
throughout anterior neuroectoderm formation [14], Bp,
module 2 and A were not sufficient to control six3a
expression. This suggests that an extra module is
responsible for zebrafish six3a expression during early
stages. Bovolenta and coworkers showed that a 4.5-kb
region upstream of the medaka olsix3.2 transcription
initiation site is responsible for olsix3.2 expression.
They identified an early neural enhancer, Box D. We
aligned the medaka and zebrafish genomes and found

Chao et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/35

that Box D of Conte et al. was similar to the six3a
genomic sequence -1754 to -1571 bp in zebrafish; we
named it module D. Module D significantly activated
transcription (Fig. 3-III-E, F), and it was the only module that drove expression in early stages (Fig. 3-III-G
for 8 hpf, 3III-H for 11 hpf). Our result showed that
the early neural enhancer in medaka olsix3.2 also
appears in a similar position and exhibits an enhancer
function for six3a expression in the early zebrafish
neuroectoderm. At 24 hpf, modules D and A displayed
an enhancer effect when linked to the basal promoter,
except the expression domain from D-Bp (Fig. 3-III- F,
I), which seemed to extend to a more ventral region
than A-Bp (Fig. 3-III-D, L). This suggests that a suppressor function is missing from D-Bp. More related
data is shown in the âsilencer function of module A on
the suppression of the ectopic expression from module
Dâ section.
Deletion analysis of module A identified several activator
binding sites

To understand the transcriptional regulation of six3a in
detail, we dissected module A by using deletions and
mutations to identify the minimal sequence and the
bound transcription factors required for enhancer function. Comparison of module A sequences among zebrafish, Xenopus, opossum, Tetraodon, human and mouse
revealed four highly conserved elements with 100% similarity among those species (Fig. 4, bottom). We first
generated five deletion constructs by PCR (Fig. 4-I). The
A462-Bp construct was 462 bp long and lacked 311 bp
from the 5â-end of module A. In the A433-Bp construct,
29 bp were deleted, including the first highly conserved
element âTCATTAAâ. In the A415-Bp construct, the
second highly conserved element âCGCTAACAAâ was
deleted. Both of the âAAATGCâ and âCAGCTâ elements
were deleted in the D392-Bp construct. A 22-bp, highly
conserved element was deleted in the A315-Bp construct. These constructs were separately microinjected
into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage, and the
zebrafish were analyzed for GFP expression. A462-Bp
mutants showed GFP expression in the forebrain and
retina at 24 hpf (Fig. 4-III-A). Furthermore, deletion of
the first element (A433-Bp) slightly decreased GFP
expression in the forebrain (Fig. 4-III-B). The deletion
of the second highly conserved element (A415-Bp)
caused decreased GFP expression in the eye and forebrain (Fig. 4-III-C). A construct containing none of the
highly conserved elements (A392) showed very low
expression in both the forebrain and eye, suggesting the
importance of those elements (Fig. 4-III-D).
We further deleted the 3â-end of module A to find the
minimal active elements. The 3â deletion mutant Aâ³
372-Bp, which contained all four highly conserved

Page 9 of 18

elements, had very low GFP expression and was
expressed in only 30% of embryos. It was similar to the
5â deletion mutant A392-Bp. Although A392-Bp and
Aâ³372-Bp each contained half of module A, neither
could drive GFP expression, indicating the possibility of
cooperation of the transcriptional factors bound to each
of these two DNA fragments. We therefore examined
the functions of the four highly conserved elements plus
the downstream sequences up to Aâ³298 (Fig. 4).
The importance of the four highly conserved elements
was demonstrated by the serial deletion mutants, in
which we successively removed more sequence from the
Aâ³298-Bp construct. Comparison of the results between
A462â³298-Bp and A433â³298-Bp (Fig. 4-III-E, F) confirmed the importance of the enhancer function in the
âTCATTAAâ sequence. Analysis of the results between
A462â³298-Bp and A462â³298-Bp-M (Fig. 4-III-F, G) corroborated the importance of âCGCTAACAAâ for forebrain and eye development. The GFP expression pattern
between A462â³298-Bp-M and A392â³298-Bp (Fig. 4-IIIG, H) supported the activation function of two highly
conserved elements âAAATGCâ and âCAGCTâ. Duplication of the 22-bp, highly conserved element showed no
activation function at all. This again indicated that multiple elements must work together, and implied that
transcription factor occupancy of these cis-elements has
a synergistic effect.
Deletion analysis in module D elucidated multiple
activator binding elements

As mentioned previously, module D is the only module
that drives expression in early stages of zebrafish development. Therefore, we next dissected module D to find
the minimal regulatory elements. Alignment of this
module among Tetraodon, fugu and medaka revealed
clusters of conserved regions (Fig. 5-I). The comparison
of the results between D141-Bp and D105-Bp showed
decreased GFP expression in the eyes and forebrain in
D105-Bp-injected embryos (Fig. 5-III-B, C). Further
removal of nucleotides between D105-Bp and D69-Bp
decreased GFP expression at both 11 and 24 hpf (Fig. 5III-C, D). The deletion to a shorter construct, D30-Bp,
which contained a highly conserved 28-bp region,
showed GFP expression in the eyes and forebrain (Fig.
5-III-E). When we duplicated this element (D28(2)-Bp),
it drove GFP not only at 24 hpf (Fig. 5-III-F) but also at
8 and 11 hpf. Our results indicated that the highly conserved 28-bp sequence might be bound by some early
transcription factor(s). Mutation of six nucleotides in
this 28-bp element from âctaattâ to âAGCCGGâ abolished the enhancer activity, indicating that the occupancy of transcription factor(s) at this core sequence
was responsible for activation. We then used the ctaatt
sequence to search the transcription factor binding site

Chao et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:35

database PROMO http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3 and found
that POU1F1a binds to âCTAATâ and âATTACâ in the
28-bp highly conserved element. Both sequences were
destroyed in our D28M(2)-Bp construct.
In contrast to module A, the multiple elements in
module D seem to function independently. Constructs
D184â³74-Bp (Fig. 5-III-G) and D69 (Fig. 5-III-E) represent the 5â and 3â halves of module D; both drove
expression in the neuroectoderm, although at a lower
level compared to the full-length construct. However,
comparing the three deletion mutants D184â³30-Bp (Fig.
5-III-H), D105â³30-Bp (Fig. 5-III-K) and D69â³30-Bp
(Fig. 5-III-O), we found that in the absence of the 28-bp
region (removed in â³30), the sequence between D184
and D105 was essential for expression. Previous deletion
mutants indicated that the most important elements in
module D included the 46-bp region between -1692 and
~ -1647, which co-localizes exactly with the sequence
between D184 and D105.
Silencer function of module A for the suppression of the
ectopic expression of module D

We previously discovered that the six3a module D exhibited a strong enhancer function, although ectopically to
the more ventral region. Similarly, the construct D184 42Bp expressed GFP not only at an early stage (Fig. 5-III-N)
but also strongly at a later stage (Fig. 5-III-I) and ectopically in the notochord. Conte et al [32] also found ectopic
expression of Box D (six3a module D). Further, they
found that Box A (six3a module A) has a silencer effect
that eliminates ectopic expression. We performed statistical analyses on the percentage of trunk expression for two
constructs: 3087-Bp (containing modules A and D) and
1060-Bp (containing only module D). We found 65% ectopic expression in 102 embryos injected with 1060-Bp but
only 26% ectopic expression and fewer GFP-expressing
cells per embryo that were injected with 3087-Bp (N =
144) (Fig. 6). Our results supported the idea that module
A contains a silencer function. Additional images that
depict the silencer function of module A plus module D
(3087-Bp) verses module D alone (1060-Bp) are provided
in Additional File 6.
EMSA for modules D and A

Next, we searched for the transcription factors that bind
to the important elements identified in the previous
functional study. For module D, we first used the entire
module sequence as a probe and found that the band
was strongly retarded in the well because the DNA-protein complex was too big to migrate (Fig. 7-I, lane 1, 2).
We then used the 5â and 3â halves of module D as
probes and again found the complexes too big to resolve
on the gel (Fig. 7-I, lane 4 ~ 6). We designed five

Page 10 of 18

additional probes covering the 5â half of module D (Fig.
7-I, lane 7 ~ 16). Probes #4 and #5 formed weak complexes (Fig. 7-I, lane 14, 16), but no binding protein
could be detected using the other three probes. These
results were consistent with the functional data showing
that the region between D141 and D69 has an enhancer
function. The 3â half of module D also showed strong
binding activity. When we used a smaller probe containing 28 bp of the functional element in module D, there
was significant binding (Fig. 7-I, lane 17, 18), indicating
that the 24 hpf zebrafish nuclear extract contained transcription factors that bind to this functional element.
We found multiple elements in module A during our
functional study. However, synergy between those elements is required for activation, and this may be due to
cooperativity in DNA binding. We used EMSAs to test
transcription factor binding to module A (Fig. 7-II) and
found that a large complex was formed with the probe
A462 298 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7-II). The
complex was reduced during competition with unlabelled DNA (Fig. 7-II). However, no band shift was
detected when we used smaller probes (data not
shown). It is likely that those elements bind transcription factors in the 24 h nuclear extract with low affinity.
Thus, multiple elements are required to achieve a higher
level of occupancy on the DNA and to activate six3a
transcription.
To identify the module D-binding proteins, we
searched the transcription factor binding sites and
recognized one Pax6.1 binding site in the #4 probe (Fig.
8-I), and one FOX binding site in the #5 probe (Fig. 8II). To investigate if those sites were responsible for the
binding, competition experiments with either wild-type
or mutant unlabelled DNA were performed. As shown
in Fig. 8-I, the specific complex on the module D-probe
#4 was in competition with wild-type but not with
Pax6.1 mutant DNA. In addition, the binding activity of
the module D-probe #5 was in competition with wildtype but not with FOX site mutant DNA (Fig. 8-II).
These data indicated that sites for Pax6.1 and FOX were
indeed responsible for the binding activity.
Further experiments are necessary to demonstrate the
identity of other transcription factors that regulate
six3a. From predictions for module A, we discovered
the Pax6.1 binding sites on the 2nd and 3rd conserved
elements. The POU domain transcription factor binding
site was predicted in the 1st conserved element of module D (Fig. 9-I). We also found homeobox protein binding sites on both module D (#5 probe) and module A
(4th conserved element). LMO4b is a homeobox protein
that is a repressor for six3a [25]. Further experiments
evaluating the binding of LMO4b to module D and A
will be necessary to provide direct evidence for this
interaction. However, from our functional assay and

and labeled as probes for EMSA. The 28-bp region (blue box) was generated as double strand oligonucleotide for EMSA. The gel image was
obtained with probe only (lane 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17), and with nuclear extract (lane 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18) to detect the

EMSA analysis, we strongly proposed the importance of
multiple elements in modules D and A, and demonstrated the binding proteins present in zebrafish embryo
nuclear extracts. The EMSAs also revealed synergism
between the multiple elements in modules D and A.
Our results suggested that the functional response of
the six3a transcription unit to positive inputs from
POU, Pax6.1 and Gbx1 and to negative inputs from
zFoxl1 and LMO4b is encoded in the six3a cis-regulatory elements, i.e., modules A and D. This study provides a comprehensive view of the regulation of brain
and eye and may establish the GRNs underlying neurogenesis in the zebrafish.

Discussion
Two evolutionarily conserved modules and many minimal
functional elements work together to achieve correct
six3a expression

Six3a is an important transcription factor expressed in
the presumptive brain and eye territory and continuously expressed in the forebrain and retina. Forebrain
development is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates and so is the underlying mechanism that operates
the GRNs. By analyzing the transcriptional regulation of
six3a, we not only uncovered the evolutionary cis-regulatory code responsible for the expression of six3a, but
also drew a preliminary picture of how those transcription factors specify forebrain development.
We found that the early enhancer module D activated
six3a expression as early as 8 hpf. However, expression
extended to the ventral area. Module A was necessary
to restrict this expression. Bovolentaâs lab found that
Box D (similar to our module D) is an early enhancer,
and Box A (similar to our module A) is a silencer [32].
The interactions between these two Boxes are necessary
for correct six3.2 expression in medaka. They also found
that Box E is a late neural and retinal enhancer of
medaka six3.2. Our results are consistent with their
findings and suggest that a booster enhancer is located
between 681-Bp and 448-Bp (similar to Box E). However, it is a very weak enhancer compared to modules A
and D.
There are also some inconsistencies between our data
and previous reports on six3a. We found that module A
acted as an enhancer at 24 hpf, and the basal promoter
had no enhancer function, as suggested by the Bovolenta [32] and Fjose [33] groups. Because the developmental stages of our study are early compared to the
aforementioned studies, we cannot conclude that the
basal promoter does not have an enhancer function at
later stages, as they discovered. However, we have
injected the Bp-GFP construct and observed expression
at later stages (48 and 72 hpf), but we still do not detect
GFP expression (data not shown). This preliminary

Figure 9 Cartoon figure of zebrafish six3a regulation by modules A and D. The black line represents the six3a genomic DNA, and the blue
boxes represent the functional and evolutionarily conserved elements identified in this study. There are four elements in module A and three in
module D. Each module is occupied by predictive transcription factors, some of which are activators (circles), and others are repressors
(triangles). The 28-bp element in module D is bound by the POU and Gbx1 transcription factors, enhancing expression by interacting with the
basal promoter. Elements #4 and #5 in module D, presumptively occupied by Pax6.1 and Foxa2, also enhance six3a expression by interacting
with the basal promoter. There are four elements in module A, none of which can function independently. Through the interaction between
POU and Pax6.1 and the 1st to 3rd elements, module A enhances six3a expression by interacting with the basal promoter. To inhibit the ectopic
expression of six3a, zfoxl1 binds to module A through the 2nd element and module D through the #5 element, possibly eliminating the Foxa2
interaction with the same DNA. Alternatively, LMO4b may bind to the 4th element in module A and simultaneously to the 28-bp element in
module D, perhaps eliminating Gbx1 binding to the same DNA. The repression effect can be achieved by module A alone or with both
modules together.

result indicated that this region (the basal promoter of
zsix3a and Box I and L of olsix3.2) does not have
enhancer activity. Also, module B:C had no enhancer
function, as proposed by Wargelius et al. However, we
suggest that POU and Pax6.1 activate six3a expression
by binding to modules A and D.
We not only demonstrated the functionality of these
evolutionarily conserved elements using transgenesis in
zebrafish, but we also made many deletion and mutation
constructs to identify the minimal elements necessary
for regulation in order to predict the transcription factors responsible for six3a regulation. EMSAs, using
nuclear extracts from zebrafish embryos, revealed binding proteins that occupied these functional elements.
The predictions of transcription factors are given in
Fig. 9-I, and the working model for six3a regulation is
shown in Fig. 9-II.
The POU domain transcription factor is important for
activating six3a expression

We searched for transcription factor binding sites on
the evolutionarily conserved and functional minimal elements that we identified. The 28-bp, conserved element
has two HNF1Bs (GCTAATTA and TAATTACT), two
POU domain transcription factor (CTAAT and
ATTAC), one C/EBP beta (TTGCTTA) and one PRalpha (AGAACACAA) binding sites. Mutational analysis
showed that the POU domain transcription factor binding site was responsible for the enhancer function;
mutation of the six-nucleotide sequence containing this
site eliminated the enhancer function. In module A,
four highly conserved elements work synergistically as
an enhancer. The first element (TCATTAA) has a binding site for the POU domain transcription factor
(ATTAA).
Two POU domain transcription factors are expressed
in zebrafish brain and eyes: pou3f3a (POU class 3
homeobox 3a; previous names:zp12, wu:fc33a11, pou12
and brn1.1), which is predominantly expressed in the
central nervous system [35]; and pou3f3b (POU class 3
homeobox 3b; previous names:zp23pou, wu:fb92g06(1),
zp23, fb92g06, zfpou1(1), pou1 and pou23), which is
expressed in developing neural tissues [36]. They are
expressed at the right time and place for the activator
to bind to six3a modules A and D. It is likely that
Pou3f3a and Pou3f3b are important in regulating six3a
expression by binding to modules A and D. Although
we did not find that the proposed Brn3 (which is a
POU domain transcription factor) binding site on
module B had any activation function, as described
previously [33], we suggest that Pou3f3a and Pou3f3b
activate six3a by binding to the 28-bp element in
module D and the first highly conserved element in
module A.

Page 15 of 18

Pax6a binds to six3a module A to activate expression in
the eyes and brain

In module A, the second element (GCGTAACAA) has a
binding site for a paired box protein (GCGTAAC), and
the third (AAATGC) also has a binding site for a paired
box protein (AAATGC). In module D, in addition to
the 28-bp element, two highly conserved elements
show enhancer function and are bound by proteins
in the 24 h nuclear extract. The EMSA probe #4
(CGCTCCCTGCTGATT) has a binding site for a
paired box protein (CGCTCCC).
Many paired box proteins in zebrafish are likely
important in regulating six3a expression. Among these,
pax6a (paired box gene 6a), which is expressed in the
anterior neural plate at the bud stage [37] and in the
brain and immature eye at the prim5 stage, is the most
likely activator of module D expression. The regulatory
mechanisms governed by pax6 are evolutionarily conserved among teleosts and mammals [38]. Although we
did not find that the proposed Pax6 binding site on
module C had any activation function, as proposed previously [33], we suggest that Pax6a activates six3a by
binding to the 2nd and 3rd highly conserved elements in
module A.
Other possible transcription factors regulating six3a
expression

The 28-bp conserved element of module D has two
homeobox protein binding sites (TAATTA), and the
fourth element of module A (GACAGCT) has a binding
site for HoxA3 (GACAG). It is possible that a homeobox protein, Gbx1 (gastrulation brain homeobox 1), activates six3a expression as early as 5 hpf. Our
unpublished real-time RT-PCR data indicated that
knockdown of Gbx1 expression by morpholino injection
decreased six3a expression at 5 hpf. Gbx1 is expressed
in the presumptive brain at the 75% epiboly stage [39].
However, if Gbx1 expression extends to the hindbrain
neural plate, neural plate and ventral mesoderm [40],
early expression will result in an ectopic pattern unless
there is a repression system. Another homeobox transcription factor candidate for regulating six3 expression
is the LIM homeobox gene, LMO4b, which has been
proposed as a negative regulator of forebrain growth
acting via the restriction of six3 expression during early
segmentation stages [25]. It is possible that LMO4b
negatively regulates six3a by binding to modules A and
D together.
We found that the second conserved element
(CGTAACA) of module A shows similarity to the forkhead transcription factor binding site. The fifth EMSA
probe of module D (CATAGAACAGAGCAGTGAAAGCTAG) has a binding site for the forkhead transcription factor (TAGAACA). Thus, the forkhead

Chao et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/35

transcription factor may also activate module D expression in the presumptive brain. Foxa2, also called hepatocyte nuclear factor 3b (hnf-3b), is a member of the
forkhead box transcription factor protein family. In situ
hybridization shows that Foxa2 is first expressed on the
dorsal side of the hypoblast just before gastrulation [41].
Later, at 8 hpf, it is expressed in the endoderm and
axial mesoderm. In adult fish, Foxa2 is expressed in
multiple territories, including the gut, liver and pancreas
of the endoderm and the floor plate of the ectoderm
[42]. Thus, during zebrafish development, Foxa2 is
expressed in all three germ layers. Its role in the ventral
central nervous system was proposed by Norton et al.
Nodal signaling from the notochord induces Foxa2
expression in the medial floor plate (MFP), and Foxa2
activates downstream genes (e.g., Ntn1b, Shha and
Shhb) that are required for MFP maintenance and
differentiation.
One of the forkhead transcription factors, zfoxl1, is
strongly expressed in neural tissues, such as the midbrain,
hindbrain and the otic vesicle at the early embryonic stage.
It is a novel regulator of neural development that acts by
suppressing shh expression [43]. Our results and previous
data from Conte et al. [32] indicated that the suppressor
function mediated by module A eliminates the ectopic
expression carried by module D. It is possible that zfoxl1
binds to module A via the 2nd conserved element and to
module G through the 28-bp element to execute its
repressor function over module D.

Conclusions
In this study, we identified two enhancers in the regulation of zebrafish six3a. Those modules are evolutionarily
conserved across all vertebrates. Module D was also
identified as an enhancer in medaka. Module A not only
exhibited an enhancer function but also had a suppressor effect, eliminating the ectopic expression driven by
module D. Further analysis of the minimal binding elements in both modules demonstrated that the multiple
elements in module A work synergistically in binding to
DNA, while the 45-bp and 28-bp elements in module D
have strong DNA-protein interaction activity and are
functionally important. Possible activators that bind to
modules D and A are Pou3f3a, Pou3f3b, Pax6a, Gbx1
and Foxa2. Possible repressors binding to module D and
A are LMO4 and zfoxl1. The discovery of these elements and transcription factor binding sites provides a
new insightful view of the entire interplay of transcription factors in the GRNs for forebrain development.
Methods
Zebrafish husbandry, experimentation and care/welfare

AB strain D. rerio fish were purchased from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC), Oregon. Fish

Page 16 of 18

were maintained at 28Â°C in our zebrafish facility, a continuous flow-through system, with a 14 h light/10 h
dark cycle. The developmental stages were as described
previously [44]. Embryos from naturally spawning AB
strain zebrafish were used in this study. To generate
embryos for injection, male and female fish were placed
in a 1 L fish tank with inner mesh and a divider the
night before injection. Zebrafish embryos were obtained
from naturally spawning adults stimulated by light and
by removing the divider. The embryos were stored at
28.5 before and after microinjection.
Ethical approval

All experiments involving zebrafish were conducted
according to the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Health
Research Institutes (NHRI). The animal protocol involving zebrafish was approved by IACUC of NHRI; the
approved protocol numbers are NHRI-IACUC-095050A, 096037-A, 098017-A and 098087 under the name of
Dr. Yuh, Chiou-Hwa, who is the corresponding author.
DNA constructs and site-directed mutagenesis

The zebrafish six3a DNA was obtained from zebrafish
genomic DNA or a six3a BAC clone (DKEY-254J21)
purchased from the BACPAC Resource Center (BPRC)
at the Childrenâs Hospital, Oakland Research Institute,
Oakland, CA. The genomic sequence was obtained from
the Ensembl Genome Browser Database http://www.
ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/index.html. Cis-regulatory elements in the zebrafish six3a genome, which are conserved among several species, were identified using the
UCSC Genome Browser Database http://genome.ucsc.
edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway. In order to obtain the cis-regulatory elements for our constructs, we used PCR to
amplify the BAC DNA by specific forward and reverse
primers containing restriction enzyme sites for ligation
into the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). After digesting with restriction enzymes and purifying from the gel, the DNA was inserted into an EGFPN1 vector. The primer sequences used to amplify the
DNA are shown in [additional data 1], and the restriction enzyme sites are underlined.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a
QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
This method utilizes PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, which
replicates both plasmid strands with high fidelity and
without displacing the mutant oligonucleotide primers.
A 50-ng sample of template DNA was used in each
reaction. After temperature cycling (95Â°C for 30 s, then
18 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 s, 55Â°C for 1 min and 68Â°C for
12 min), the product was treated with DpnI. The nicked
vector DNA containing the desired mutations was then
transformed into XL2-Blue ultracompetent cells.

The oligonucleotides used to generate the mutations are
given in Additional file 3. The underlined sequences are
the 5â and 3â parts of the primer sequences. The internal
sequences were deleted after site-directed mutagenesis.
Microinjection and microscopic photography

Embryos were injected using either DNA from the construct, which was PCR-amplified with the specific forward and reverse primers (EGFP-N1-r-poly(A)
containing the SV40 poly(A) signal), or the linearlized
constructs formed by digestion with XhoI. For microinjection, the morpholinos or DNAs were prepared in PBS
with 0.05% (w/v) phenol red. Embryos were injected at
the one-cell stage with 2.3 nl of 25 ng/Î¼l six3a-green
fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs by Nanoject
(Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). Embryos
were collected at different stages for GFP visualization
and photography using a Nikon Optiphot-2 upright
microscope with the episcopic-fluorescence attachment
EFD-3 (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) coupled with a
DXM1200 Nikon Digital Camera.
EMSA

Radioactively labeled DNA probes were designed based
on the functional assay results. The G184 EMSA probe
was generated by PCR using the D184-F and D184-R
primers and was digested with XhoI to produce 5â protruding ends for labeling. The D184â³74 probe was generated by PCR using the D184-F and D184â³74-R and
was digested with XhoI to produce 5â protruding ends
for labeling. The D69 probe was generated by PCR
using the D69-F and D184-R primers and was digested
with XhoI and SacI to produce 5â protruding ends for
labeling. The #1-#5 and D28 probes in module D were
synthesized oligonucleotides and annealed to form double strands using the method described below. The
module A EMSA probe was generated by PCR using the
A462-F and AÎ298-R primers and was digested with
XhoI and KpnI to produce 5â protruding ends for
labeling.
The oligonucleotides used for EMSA and PCR primers
for generating the DNA fragments for EMSA are listed
in Additional file 1. The 5â protruding sequence on the
annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide probes,
5âATCG, that generated by restriction enzyme digestion,
was used for Klenow labeling by filling in with [a32P]
dCTP. The double-stranded DNA was annealed in 0.1
M NaCl buffered with 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) at a 100
Î¼M final concentration. The double-stranded DNA was
labeled with Klenow polymerase, and the free un-incorporated nucleotides were removed with a G-25 Sephadex spin column. Reactions were prepared per tube as

follows: to 2 Î¼l nuclear extract or buffer C [45], 1 Î¼l
specific competitor (100 ng/Al) or H2O was added, plus
1 Î¼l labeled probe (1 Ã 105cpm/Î¼l), 16 Î¼l pre-mix binding buffer (containing nonspecific competitors [polyd(I)d(C)/polyd(I)/d(C), 10 Î¼g]), and 1Ã binding buffer [20
mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 75 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT].
The tubes were incubated on ice for 15 min before loading onto a 6% native polyacrylamide/TBE gel. The gel
was run at 150 V for 2.5 h, placed on 3 MM paper,
wrapped with plastic wrap, dried for 60 min at 80Â°C in a
vacuum gel dryer and subjected to phosphoimager
exposure.
Additional file 1: Six3 protein sequence alignment. Fourteen Six3
proteins from 12 different species were used for the alignment analysis.
Additional file 2: Phylogenetic tree of 14 Six3 proteins from 12
different species. The tree was built using CLC Main Workbench 5
software with the Neighbor Joining method. The neighbor joining
algorithm is generally considered to be fairly good and is widely used.
The number indicates the bootstrap score, which shows that the
corresponding branch occurs in all 100 trees made from re-sampled
alignments. Thus, a high bootstrap score is a sign of greater reliability.
Additional file 3: Primers used in this study. All of the primers used
for generating PCR products for microinjection and site-direct
mutagenesis are listed.
Additional file 4: Conserved non-coding regions or regulatory
modules identified in this study. All of the conserved non-coding
regions or regulatory elements identified in this study are shown.
Additional file 5: Raw data for microinjection experiment. All of the
microinjection data in this study are shown.
Additional file 6: Additional images for 3087-Bp and 1060-Bp. More
GFP images for 3087-Bp and 1060-Bp are shown in this file.
