Abstract
Background: Exposure of cells to environmental stress conditions can lead to the interruption of
several intracellular processes, in particular those performed by macromolecular complexes such
as the spliceosome.
Results: During nucleotide sequencing of cDNA libraries constructed using RNA isolated from B.
emersonii cells submitted to heat shock and cadmium stress, a large number of ESTs with retained
introns was observed. Among the 6,350 ESTs obtained through sequencing of stress cDNA
libraries, 181 ESTs presented putative introns (2.9%), while sequencing of cDNA libraries from
unstressed B. emersonii cells revealed only 0.2% of ESTs containing introns. These data indicate an
enrichment of ESTs with introns in B. emersonii stress cDNA libraries. Among the 85 genes
corresponding to the ESTs that retained introns, 19 showed more than one intron and three
showed three introns, with intron length ranging from 55 to 333 nucleotides. Canonical splicing
junctions were observed in most of these introns, junction sequences being very similar to those
found in introns from genes previously characterized in B. emersonii, suggesting that inhibition of
splicing during stress is apparently a random process. Confirming our observations, analyses of gpx3
and hsp70 mRNAs by Northern blot and S1 protection assays revealed a strong inhibition of intron
splicing in cells submitted to cadmium stress.
Conclusion: In conclusion, data indicate that environmental stresses, particularly cadmium
treatment, inhibit intron processing in B. emersonii, revealing a new adaptive response to cellular
exposure to this heavy metal.

Background
Exposure to environmental stresses leads to the disruption
of many intracellular processes, in particular those carried
out by macromolecular complexes, which are extremely
sensitive to perturbation by stress conditions [1]. An
example of a macromolecular complex that could be
affected by environmental stresses is the spliceosome,

which is responsible for intron excision, an important cellular process. The spliceosome is a multicomponent complex formed by hundreds of proteins and five small
nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs) assembled on the newly synthesized precursor messenger RNA
(pre-mRNA) [2,3]. This complex catalyzes a two-step
transesterification reaction required to remove the introns

and connect the exons [4,5]. Intron splicing is a precisely
regulated process, where only four intron sequences guide
spliceosome machinery. They are: the exon-intron junction at the 5' and 3' end of the introns (5'ss - GT, 3'ss AG); the branch site sequence located upstream of the
3'ss; and the polypyrimidine tract located between the 3'ss
and the branch site [6].
The aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii belongs to the
Chytridiomycete class, which is at the base of the fungal
phylogenetic tree [7,8]. Throughout its life cycle this fungus suffers dramatic biochemical and morphological
changes, especially during two distinct stages of cell differentiation: germination and sporulation [9]. Both stages
can be induced with a high degree of synchrony, and drastic changes in the patterns of RNA and protein syntheses
are observed throughout the fungus life cycle. In nature, B.
emersonii can be exposed to distinct environmental conditions, as temperature fluctuations and presence of heavy
metals, as cadmium, that could lead to the disruption of
some cellular functions.
It was previously shown that the splicing machinery is
sensitive to thermal stress, as exposure of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cells to heat shock at 42°C leads to the accumulation of pre-mRNA species containing unspliced introns
[10]. This splicing inhibition was also observed in a variety of species from yeast to humans, including B. emersonii
[10-14]. However, the splicing machinery seems to be
more thermoresistant in B. emersonii because at the lethal
temperature of 42°C, when cell viability falls to less than
1% and protein synthesis is decreased by more than 95%
[15], splicing is only partially inhibited in this fungus
(30% inhibition) [13]. In yeast and Drosophila melanogaster at extreme temperatures splicing is inhibited
more than 70% [10,11].
Although the effects of heat shock in the splicing machinery have been known for more than two decades [11],
there is little information in the literature about how cadmium affects this complex. Cadmium (Cd2+) is a divalent
cation present in polluted environments, which causes
oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and mutagenesis in the
cells [16,17]. However, the molecular mechanisms by
which cadmium leads to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress are largely unknown and are
probably indirect. The mechanism usually proposed for
cadmium toxicity is its binding to cellular proteins, resulting in the inhibition of some essential enzymes. As cadmium has high affinity for thiol groups, it is thought to
bind accessible cysteine residues in proteins [16]. Another
possible effect of cadmium exposure is the displacement
of zinc and calcium from metalloproteins, leading to inhibition of these important proteins [16-18]. In this way,
the presence of cadmium in the cells could affect, in the-

ory, any biological process including the spliceosome
machinery.
In this study, we demonstrate that environmental stresses,
in particular, cadmium treatment inhibits splicing in the
aquatic fungus B. emersonii. This inhibition is dosedependent since we observed more unspliced mRNAs
when higher cadmium concentrations were used. Thus,
this work shows a new deleterious effect in RNA processing machinery when cells are exposed to cadmium.

Methods
Construction of cDNA libraries from stressed cells
ESTs analyzed in this work were obtained through the
sequencing of three different cDNA libraries constructed
from cells of B. emersonii submitted to heat shock and cadmium stress. The description of RNA extraction, cDNA
library construction and EST sequencing is shown in [19].
Briefly, cDNA libraries were constructed from RNA samples isolated from sporulating cells exposed to heat shock
at 38°C from 30 to 60 min after starvation (HSR library)
or to 50 μM CdCl2 during the same period (CDM library)
and from sporulating cells exposed to 100 μM CdCl2 from
60 to 90 min after starvation (CDC library).
Identification of putative introns in B. emersonii ESTs
To identify putative introns, all ESTs obtained from the
sequencing of the HSR, CDM and CDC cDNA libraries
were grouped using Cap3 program [20]. The unigenes
obtained (contigs plus singlets) (BeSAS - B. emersonii
Stress Assembled Sequences) were compared with B. emersonii EST databank (BeAS - B. emersonii Assembled
Sequences) using BlastN tool [21]. BeAS databank was
generated from the sequencing of cDNA libraries constructed using RNA samples obtained from cells at different B. emersonii life cycle stages and that were not
submitted to stress conditions [22,23]. BeSAS unigenes
that presented extended regions of nucleotide identity
with BeAS unigenes separated by regions that do not presented any nucleotide identity were pre-selected to be analyzed. We performed a search for canonical splicing
junctions in these pre-selected BeSAS unigenes as well as
for sequences corresponding to the putative branch site.
Identification of putative genes encoding mRNA
processing proteins in B. emersonii
We grouped all ESTs sequenced in B. emersonii transcriptome project (ESTs from stress and non-stress cDNA
libraries) by using Cap3 program (BeSCAS - B. emersonii
Stress and Cycle Assembled Sequences) and annotated the
putative genes according to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
For more details, see references [19,23]. All BeSCAS genes
that were annotated to the GO term "mRNA processing"
(GO:0006397) were selected to be manually analyzed.

Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was isolated from synchronized B. emersonii
cells during sporulation, maintained at their physiological
temperature (27°C) or exposed to heat shock (38°C during 30 min) and cadmium (50 μM CdCl2 and 100 μM
CdCl2 during 30 min) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Gel electrophoresis and blotting were performed as described in
[24].
S1 protection assays of hsp70-1 RNA
The 5' end-labeled probe was prepared by labeling an 18nt primer with [γ-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase,
which was then annealed to a single-stranded DNA from
M13mpl8 containing a 2.3 kb BamHl-Sacl fragment of
hsp70-1 genomic clone (coding strand) [13], and
extended using the PolIk. The extending reaction was carried out in 12.5 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing
6.25 mM MgC12/25 μM dATP, dCTP, dTTP and dGTP and
5 units of PolIk. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature the enzyme was inactivated at 65°C for 10 min.
The probe (4 × 105 cpm) was ethanol precipitated with 50
μg of total RNA isolated from cells at different stages of the
life cycle and from cells submitted to different concentrations of CdCl2. The pellet was then suspended in 28 μl of
formamide and 7 μl of 40 mM Pipes buffer, pH 6.4, containing 400 mM NaC1/1 mM EDTA. After boiling the
samples for 10 min, the annealing was carried out for 3 h
at 52°C. The samples were then diluted with 350 μl of 30
mM Na-acetate buffer pH 4.6/250 mM NaCl/1 mM
ZnSO4/20 μg per ml calf thymus DNA, and digested at
37°C for 30 min with 50 units of S1 nuclease (GE Healthcare). The nucleic acids were ethanol precipitated, suspended in 4 μl of formamide sample buffer, and analyzed
in 7 M urea-6% PAGE followed by autoradiography. The
fragments were sized by comparison with Mspl digest 32Plabeled pBR322 DNA.

Results
B. emersonii stress cDNA libraries are enriched in ESTs
with introns
The sequencing of ESTs from cDNA libraries constructed
from B. emersonii cells submitted to heat shock and cadmium stress suggested that introns have been retained in
several of them. Therefore, we speculated that the stress

conditions used to construct these libraries could be
affecting mRNA splicing in B. emersonii. To test this
hypothesis, we initially identified all the ESTs sequenced
from stress cDNA libraries that contained putative introns
(iESTs).
Among the 6,350 ESTs sequenced from the stress libraries,
181 ESTs (corresponding to 105 introns retained from 85
distinct genes - Additional file 1) presented putative
introns (2.9%), while in the sequencing of cDNA libraries
from cells not submitted to stresses it was verified that
only 0.2% of the ESTs contained putative introns (Table
1). These data are consistent with our hypothesis and indicate that there is an enrichment of ESTs with introns in B.
emersonii stress cDNA libraries. Interestingly, if we consider the cDNA libraries separately, we observe a more
pronounced enrichment of iESTs (4.9%) in the cDNA
library constructed from cells submitted to the higher concentration of cadmium (100 μM) (Table 1).
Among the 85 genes corresponding to the ESTs that
retained introns, 19 showed more than one intron and
three showed three introns. The intron length ranged
from 55 to 333 nucleotides (Figure 1), most of the introns
being between 60-79 nt long. To further characterize these
putative introns we performed a search for the canonical
splicing sites in the regions adjacent to intron sequences
and also for the conserved sequence of the putative
branch site, which is involved in lariat formation and
intron splicing [25]. We detected the conserved dinucleotides at each end of the introns (GT at the 5' end and AG
at the 3' end) in 102 of the 105 putative introns (Figure
2A, Additional file 1). All introns analyzed also presented
a sequence similar to the conserved sequence (CTAAC) of
the branch site. We performed the same search for the
putative introns detected in ESTs from non-stress cDNA
libraries and the result was very similar (Figure 2B). In
addition, all nine previously characterized genes of B.
emersonii containing introns showed the canonical splicing sites and a conserved branch site sequence [13,26-33].
These data show that canonical splicing junctions
observed in most of the iESTs obtained through the
sequencing of stress libraries are not different from other
splicing junctions present in introns of genes previously

characterized in B. emersonii, and also not different from
introns retained in ESTs from non-stress libraries. This
suggests that the mRNAs that had their splicing inhibited
by stress were probably randomly affected or at least if
there is a selection for some mRNAs, it is not based in differences in their splicing sites.

If we consider that selective inhibition of splicing could be
a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism to respond
to stressful conditions, we would expect that a group of
genes should have their mRNA processing inhibited to
enhance the mRNA processing of other genes that could
be more important for the response of B. emersonii to
stress. However, when we analyzed the genes corresponding to the ESTs with introns retained, we did not observe
a pattern among them (Additional file 1). On the contrary, some important genes as those encoding HSPs
(Heat Shock Proteins), Glutathione-S-transferases and
Thioredoxins that are induced in response to stress conditions [19], also presented iESTs sequenced from stress
cDNA libraries.
Further evidence that is consistent with this idea is the fact
that for 30% of the iESTs, at least one EST sequenced from
stress libraries corresponding to the same gene did not
retain the intronic sequences, i.e., the corresponding
mRNA was correctly processed (Additional file 1).
The spliceosome genes are not repressed under heat shock
and cadmium stress
The inhibition of mRNA splicing caused by heat shock
and cadmium treatment could be due to a decrease in the
expression of genes encoding proteins of the spliceosome
complex, leading to a reduction in the levels of the proteins forming the spliceosome. To test this hypothesis we

identified all genes coding for spliceosome proteins that
were present in B. emersonii EST database [19,22,23]. We
observed 41 distinct genes (corresponding to 91 ESTs)
encoding proteins involved in mRNA processing in this
fungus (Additional file 2). To verify if these genes were upor down-regulated during stress, we used the expression
profile data of microarray assays of B. emersonii cells submitted to cadmium and heat shock, previously published
by our group [19]. Among the 41 genes of B. emersonii
related to mRNA processing, 29 were present on the
microarray slide and only two of them were shown to be
differentially expressed in response to cadmium or heat
shock. One was induced by heat shock (BeE60H22E01 snRNP core protein SMX5d) and the other
(BeE60N15H01 - putative small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm-D1) was repressed by cadmium treatment
[19,23].
The 41 genes observed through our search certainly do not
correspond to all genes involved in mRNA processing in
B. emersonii, since it has been shown that the spliceosome
machinery is formed by hundreds of proteins in eukaryotes [2]. However, we believe that our set of genes is a significant part of those that encode proteins of the mRNA
processing complex in B. emersonii. Nevertheless, we
observed that only one gene was repressed under stress
conditions. Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of
mRNA splicing after cadmium and heat stress in this fungus is not due to a global repression of the genes involved
in the splicing process under these conditions.
One of the possible effects of cadmium that lead to toxicity in cells is its capacity of displace zinc (Zn2+) and calcium (Ca2+) from proteins that need these cations to
perform their functions [16,34,35]. So, the inhibition of
splicing by cadmium in B. emersonii could be due to the
substitution of zinc in proteins involved in mRNA
processing, which could lead to impairment or even to
loss of their function. Considering this hypothesis, we
evaluated if among B. emersonii spliceosome proteins
there were some that possessed zinc-binding domains, as
zinc finger or zinc-related motifs, which could be affected
by the presence of cadmium inside the cells.
Comparing the deduced amino acid sequences from the
41 mRNA processing-related genes from B. emersonii with
a protein family database (PFAM) [36], we observed two
proteins with putative zinc-related domains. They encode
the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 5
(BeCSAS2344) and the pre-mRNA splicing factor Cwc2
(BeE30N19E11) [22]. The former protein has a THAP
domain, a putative DNA-binding domain that probably
also binds a zinc ion, and the second protein has a zincfinger domain. The presence of proteins that possess zincrelated domains has also been reported in the spliceo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/231

some of other organisms [37-40], indicating that this type
of protein is a common component of the splicing
machinery and could be the target of zinc displacement by
cadmium.
Splicing of hsp70-1 intron is inhibited by cadmium
treatment but not by hydrogen peroxide
Previous studies showed that the processing of B. emersonii hsp70-1 intron is partially inhibited (30%) after heat
treatment of the cells at the lethal temperature of 42°C
[13]. The hsp70-1 gene was one of the genes that presented
an iEST sequenced from libraries from cells exposed to
cadmium stress (Additional file 1). However, we detected
no hsp70-1 iEST in the heat shock cDNA library (HSR).
This is probably due to the fact that in the construction of
the heat shock cDNA library fungal cells were incubated at
38°C instead of the restrictive temperature of 42°C. To
confirm the inhibition of B. emersonii hsp70-1 intron splicing by cadmium treatment, we performed S1 nuclease
protection assays using a 5'end-labeled probe prepared as
described in Materials and Methods. The probe was
hybridized to total RNA isolated from cells submitted to
cadmium treatment (250 μM). As a control of splicing
inhibition, we also used total RNA isolated from cells submitted to heat shock at 38°C and 42°C.

As depicted in Figure 3, a partial block in hsp70-1 intron
splicing occurs after cadmium treatment suggesting that
the presence of this heavy metal in cells impairs spliceosome function. The hsp70-1 intron was efficiently processed at 38°C but its splicing was partially inhibited when
B. emersonii cells were incubated at 42°C, as previously
shown by Stefani and Gomes [13] (Figure 3). To further
test if the effect of cadmium on mRNA processing could
be due to oxidative stress caused by the presence of the
metal in the cells, we also analyzed the effect of hydrogen
peroxide treatment on B. emersonii hsp70-1 intron splicing. We did not detect any inhibition of hsp70-1 intron
processing when we performed the S1 nuclease protection
assays using total RNA isolated from cells exposed to 0.5
mM hydrogen peroxide (Figure 3). These results suggest
that splicing inhibition by cadmium treatment of B. emersonii cells is probably not due to oxidative stress caused by
this heavy metal.
As S1 nuclease protection assays were performed using
total RNA isolated from cells submitted to a higher concentration of cadmium (250 μM) than those used in the
construction of the stress libraries (50 and 100 μM), we
also performed these assays with RNA isolated from cells
submitted to 25, 50 and 100 μM CdCl2 to verify the effect
of different cadmium concentrations on hsp70-1 intron
splicing. We observed a more pronounced block in the
processing of hsp70-1 intron when B. emersonii cells were
treated with 100 μM CdCl2 than with 50 μM CdCl2, while

Splicing of hsp70 mRNA is inhibited in B. emersonii
cells exposed to cadmium. Nuclease Sl protection assays
were performed using the 5' end-labeled probe, depicted
above the autoradiogram, and 50 μg of yeast tRNA in the
presence or absence of nuclease S1 (lanes 1 and 2) as control, 50 μg of total RNA isolated from 60 min sporulating
cells (lane 3), cells submitted to heat shock at 38°C and 42°C
for 30 min (lanes 4 and 5, respectively), cells submitted to
250 μM CdCl2 for 30 min and 60 min (lanes 6 and 7, respectively), cells submitted to 500 μM H2O2 for 30 min and 60
min (lanes 8 and 9, respectively).

with 25 μM CdCl2 no inhibition of splicing was detected
(Additional file 3). These results indicate that inhibition
of splicing by cadmium treatment can be dose-dependent,
consistent with our observation that a larger number of
iESTs is found in the cDNA library constructed from cells
submitted to 100 μM CdCl2 (CDC) than from cells
exposed to 50 μM CdCl2 (CDM) (Additional file 1).

Induction of thermotolerance by incubation at moderate
temperatures restores splicing
To test whether a pretreatment at moderate heat shock
temperatures could exert some effect on mRNA processing
in B. emersonii cells, S1 nuclease protection assays were
performed using RNA samples from cells incubated at
38°C for 30 min prior to exposure to extreme heat shock
temperature (42°C) or cadmium treatment. In these
experiments, it was possible to observe that splicing inhibition occurring at 42°C could be completely reversed if
pre-incubation at 38°C was associated with incubation at
27°C for 30 min after exposure to the extreme heat shock
temperature (Figure 4A), which could be considered a
recovery period. Furthermore, protein synthesis was necessary during the entire experiment, as addition of
cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) at any time during cell incubation at the various temperatures prevented complete
recovery of the cells' capacity to carry out splicing of
hsp70-1 intron (not shown). In particular, addition of
cycloheximide before the pre-incubation step at 38°C,
revealed that this treatment is essential for reversing splicing inhibition, as no spliced mRNA is detected under this
condition (not shown). In the case of splicing inhibition
due to exposure to cadmium, pre-incubation at 38°C
prior to heavy metal treatment was also capable of reversing inhibition (Figure 4B), but complete recovery of the
splicing capacity was observed only if exposure to cadmium was followed by incubation at 27°C in the absence
of the metal (Figure 4B).
Processing of gpx3 intron is inhibited by cadmium
treatment
To further verify the splicing inhibition by cadmium and
its dose-dependent effect, we selected another gene to
evaluate intron processing. The gpx3 gene encodes a Glutathione peroxidase and was chosen because its intron is
334-nt length, so unspliced mRNA could be easily differentiated from spliced mRNA in the Northern blot assays.
The experiment was carried out using total RNA from B.
emersonii cells submitted to heat shock (38°C), and cadmium (50 and 100 μM CdCl2). The unspliced form of
gpx3 mRNA was detected only when cells were treated
with cadmium, indicating a partial block in mRNA splicing (Figure 5). Inhibition of splicing was confirmed to be
dose-dependent as a more pronounced inhibition was
observed when B. emersonii cells were treated with the
highest concentration of cadmium (100 μM). The
unspliced form of gpx3 mRNA was not detected when cells
were submitted to heat shock at 38°C, indicating that heat
stress at this temperature produces no visible effect in gpx3
mRNA splicing. Interestingly, we observed that the gpx3
gene is induced both in response to cadmium and heat
shock, an indication that this gene probably plays an
important role in the response of B. emersonii to these two
environmental stresses.

Discussion
A constant challenge for unicellular organisms in nature is
to maintain internal homeostasis despite abrupt and dramatic fluctuations in the external conditions. Sudden
changes in the external environment can perturb the internal system of the cells, disrupting cellular functions. How
organisms respond to these environmental changes to
adapt to their surroundings and avoid cellular damages
has been the subject of various research groups [19,4144]. Nevertheless, most of those studies evaluated the
effects of these environmental oscillations on gene expression, protein synthesis and cell phenotype [19,41-44],
with only a few reporting the effects of stresses on the
mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing [1,45].
This work describes for the first time, to the best of our
knowledge, inhibition of splicing in vivo as an effect of
cadmium treatment. The first evidence indicating this new
effect of cadmium in B. emersonii cells was the observation
of an enrichment of iESTs in the sequencing of the stress
cDNA libraries. From 6,350 ESTs obtained through the
sequencing of stress libraries, 2.9% correspond to iESTs,
while in the sequencing of B. emersonii cDNA libraries, not

submitted to environmental stresses, the percentage of
iESTs was only 0.2%.
Two cDNA libraries were constructed from cells submitted
to different cadmium concentrations and we observed
that the higher the cadmium concentration the more
iESTs were observed (4.3% of all ESTs sequenced from
CDC library (100 μM CdCl2) corresponded to iESTs while
in CDM library (50 μM CdCl2) this percentage was only
2.7%. Besides cadmium libraries, one cDNA library was
constructed from cells submitted to heat shock in a moderate temperature (38°C) and even in this library we
detected an enrichment of iESTs (1.1%). This observation
is quite interesting since inhibition of splicing by thermal
stress was already observed in B. emersonii, but only at
lethal temperatures (42°C) [13]. These data indicate that
intron splicing is affected in B. emersonii cells maintained
at 38°C, but the effect observed in the splicing process is
not so severe as the one detected in cells exposed to heat
shock at 42°C [13] or cadmium treatment.
Sequencing of iESTs reported here provides considerable
new information about B. emersonii intron structure and
sequence, as only nine genes with their introns sequenced

and deposited in GenBank database have been previously
described in B. emersonii [13,26-33]. Thus, the present
study contributes significantly to the knowledge about
gene organization in this fungus.
Among the 85 genes whose corresponding mRNAs
retained introns in the stress cDNA libraries, a total of
22% of them presented two or three introns. Fungal genes
are commonly interrupted by few and small introns in
comparison with metazoan genes. Intron density ranges
from five to six per gene in basidiomycetes as Cryptococcus
neoformans [46], from one to two per gene in recently
sequenced ascomycetes as Neurospora crassa and Magnaporthe grisea [47,48], and less than 300 introns present
in the entire S. cerevisiae genome [49], while human genes
are interrupted in average by eight introns [50]. Thus, considering the number of introns reported here, B. emersonii's gene structure appears to be more similar to that
observed in ascomycetes. Further evidence suggesting that

B. emersonii gene structure is more similar to ascomycetes
is the average intron length observed in this aquatic fungus. We detected introns ranging from 55 to 333 nucleotides, an intron length more similar to that observed in
the ascomycete species [49-51]. However, it is relevant to
notice that even fungi belonging to the same class present
different gene structures, as the case of Ustilago maydis, a
basidiomycete that possesses an average number of
introns per gene smaller than one [52,53].
To further characterize the intron structure of B. emersonii
genes, we have identified the splicing junctions present in
the introns sequenced from iESTs. We observed that most
of the introns showed the canonical splicing sites and the
consensus branch site sequence similar to those detected
in introns from genes previously characterized in B. emersonii. These observations suggest that inhibition of splicing by stress in B. emersonii is probably a random process
opposite to a selective inhibition of some specific premRNAs based on different intron-recognition sequences.
The fact that B. emersonii possesses proteins involved in
pre-mRNA processing containing zinc-related domains
indicates that one possible mechanism by which cadmium inhibits splicing in this fungus could be the displacement of zinc ions from these proteins. This
hypothesis is consistent with the fact that we did not
observe a global repression in the transcription of genes
encoding spliceosome proteins under these stress conditions. Additionally, the hsp70-1 gene intron was not found
to be retained when B. emersonii cells were treated with
hydrogen peroxide. These data suggest that splicing blockage is not due to an indirect effect of oxidative stress
caused by cadmium. Furthermore, Shomron and collaborators [54] demonstrated that zinc is an essential factor for
the second step of the splicing reaction, suggesting that
putative zinc-dependent metalloproteins are required for
this step of RNA splicing process. Interestingly, a recent
report demonstrated that cadmium, a metal that presents
many chemical similarities to zinc, in low quantities can
restore in vitro mRNA splicing inhibited by zinc-depletion
[55]. These results indicated that cadmium could effectively substitute zinc in metalloproteins, including those
present in the spliceosome machinery [55]. Nevertheless,
at higher concentrations the authors observed that cadmium caused the opposite effect, inhibiting splicing in
vitro [55]. In fact, cadmium should exert a direct effect in
the spliceosome complex, by displacing zinc, since at high
concentrations of zinc, no splicing inhibition was
observed, a higher cadmium concentration treatment
being necessary to detect intron retention [55].
The mechanism of zinc displacement is not applicable to
splicing inhibition by thermal stress. In this case, most
probably inhibition is due to the unfolding of spliceo-

some proteins as a consequence of high temperature.
Consistent with this hypothesis, it was observed that heat
shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in the protection of
the spliceosome complex at higher temperatures [56].
Yeast cells made thermotolerant by preincubation at 37°C
completely protect spliceosome snRNPs complexes from
disruption when subsequently exposed to a more severe
stress at 42°C [56].
Interestingly, we also observed that in B. emersonii cells
made thermotolerant by pretreatment at 38°C and later
exposed to cadmium, mRNA processing is less affected
than in cells not previously treated. One possible explanation of this thermoprotection effect in mRNA processing
machinery is that during heat shock cells could be inducing the expression of proteins that are important to the
response to temperature stress but that are also important
in the response to cadmium treatment. In fact, during the
response to heat shock, B. emersonii cells induce not only
the expression of heat shock protein genes but also genes
encoding several antioxidant proteins [19], which could
be exerting a protective effect in cells subsequently
exposed to cadmium. Indeed, we observed here that B.
emersonii gpx3 gene, which encodes a Glutathione peroxidase, is highly induced in response to both heat shock and
cadmium treatment.
Another possible explanation for splicing inhibition by
cadmium and heat shock could be that under these conditions introns are retained in some genes just because
they are alternatively spliced. However, this hypothesis
does not hold as only 30% of the iESTs maintain their
reading frames, and at least for the hsp70-1 gene the protein originated from this putative alternative splicing was
not detected in western blots [13], indicating that the
unspliced mRNA is not efficiently translated. It is important to notice that another process that could be affected
by cadmium treatment resulting in intron retention is the
machinery of nonsense-mediated decay, since this complex is responsible for the degradation of unspliced
mRNAs in the cell [57].
In yeast, transcript-specific changes in splicing were
observed in response to environmental stresses. For
instance, it was shown that in response to amino acid starvation splicing of most ribosomal protein-encoding genes
was inhibited, splicing being an important opportunity
for regulation of gene expression in response to stress
[45]. This kind of post-transcriptional regulation does not
seem to be the case during splicing inhibition by heat and
cadmium stresses in B. emersonii, as we did not observe a
pattern among the genes whose pre-mRNA splicing was
inhibited, indicating that there was no preference for transcripts that are involved in specific biological processes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/231

To confirm the inhibitory effect of cadmium in the spliceosome machinery we performed S1 nuclease protection
and Northern blot assays to analyze the splicing of two
different mRNAs (hsp70-1 and gpx3) under this stress condition. Inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing of both genes was
observed when B. emersonii cells were submitted to cadmium, validating our sequencing data. Although intron
retention could be a B. emersonii response to stress treatment, it is still unclear to us what kind of benefits this
response could bring to the cell. In fact, the results do not
seem to indicate that intron retention might be a regulatory mechanism under stress conditions. On the contrary,
it is most probable that this event occurs randomly, being
the most abundant mRNAs more affected, as those corresponding to genes induced in response to stresses.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates that environmental stresses,
mainly cadmium exposure, inhibit splicing in B. emersonii. The cellular effects of cadmium, which lead to its toxicity, have been investigated in recent years. These effects
include generation of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation,
mutagenesis and others. However, until now no description of an effect of cadmium on the spliceosome machinery was reported. Thus, this study contributes to the
elucidation of a new mechanism promoting cadmium
toxicity to the cells.
