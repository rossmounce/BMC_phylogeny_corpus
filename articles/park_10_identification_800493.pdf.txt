Identification of the family of aquaporin genes
and their expression in upland cotton (Gossypium
hirsutum L.)
Wonkeun Park1, Brian E Scheffler2, Philip J Bauer1, B Todd Campbell1*

Abstract
Background: Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is produced in over 30 countries and represents the most important natural
fiber in the world. One of the primary factors affecting both the quantity and quality of cotton production is water.
A major facilitator of water movement through cell membranes of cotton and other plants are the aquaporin
proteins. Aquaporin proteins are present as diverse forms in plants, where they function as transport systems for
water and other small molecules. The plant aquaporins belong to the large major intrinsic protein (MIP) family. In
higher plants, they consist of five subfamilies including plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP), tonoplast intrinsic
proteins (TIP), NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIP), small basic intrinsic proteins (SIP), and the recently discovered X
intrinsic proteins (XIP). Although a great deal is known about aquaporins in plants, very little is known in cotton.
Results: From a molecular cloning effort, together with a bioinformatic homology search, 71 upland cotton (G.
hirsutum) aquaporin genes were identified. The cotton aquaporins consist of 28 PIP and 23 TIP members with high
sequence similarity. We also identified 12 NIP and 7 SIP members that showed more divergence. In addition, one
XIP member was identified that formed a distinct 5th subfamily. To explore the physiological roles of these
aquaporin genes in cotton, expression analyses were performed for a select set of aquaporin genes from each
subfamily using semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Our results suggest that many cotton aquaporin
genes have high sequence similarity and diverse roles as evidenced by analysis of sequences and their expression.
Conclusion: This study presents a comprehensive identification of 71 cotton aquaporin genes. Phylogenetic
analysis of amino acid sequences divided the large and highly similar multi-gene family into the known 5
aquaporin subfamilies. Together with expression and bioinformatic analyses, our results support the idea that the
genes identified in this study represent an important genetic resource providing potential targets to modify the
water use properties of cotton.

Background
Cotton is the most important naturally produced fiber in
the world and represents a significant global agricultural
commodity. Not taking into account additional economic
value captured through cotton processing and associated
byproducts, from 2005-2007, the average farm gate value
of cotton equaled US $28 billion (World Bank, http://web.
worldbank.org). Although the majority of cotton’s value
resides in the lint fiber used by textile manufacturers, additional benefits are obtained from cottonseed products that
include animal feeds and various oil-derived products.

Similar to many other economically important crops,
one of the major factors affecting both the quantity and
quality of cotton production is water. Waddle [1] estimated that a successful cotton production system generally requires a minimum of 50 cm of water during the
growing season. Hence, in planta efforts to decrease the
quantity of water used and to improve cotton water use
efficiency are highly desirable. At the molecular level, a
potential target for manipulating water use efficiency is
represented by the aquaporin proteins.
Aquaporin proteins represent a large family of the
major intrinsic protein (MIP) superfamily and are
known to facilitate transport of diverse small molecules
including water and other small nutrients through

biological membranes. Plant growth and development
require water and nutrient uptake by transport mechanisms including a process mediated by aquaporins.
Although the first plant aquaporin gene was cloned in
soybean root nodules [2], it is now well known that
plant aquaporins are ubiquitously distributed across
plant tissue types. In higher plants, aquaporins consist
of five subfamilies that include; 1) plasma membrane
intrinsic proteins (PIP), 2) tonoplast intrinsic proteins
(TIP), 3) NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIP), 4) small
basic intrinsic proteins (SIP), and 5) the recently identified X (or unrecognized) intrinsic proteins (XIP) [3].
Aquaporin gene identification studies in plants have
primarily relied on in silico methods. By using whole
genome sequences, 35 aquaporin genes were identified
in Arabidopsis [4], 33 from Oryza sativa L. [5], 28 from
Vitis vinifera L. [6] and 23 from a moss, Physcomitrella
patens [3]. Recently, 55 full-length aquaporins have been
analyzed from Populus trichocarpa genome sequence
data [7]. Expression sequence tag (EST) data analysis
also identified the presence of at least 33 aquaporin
genes from Zea mays L. [8]. In addition, many aquaporin isoforms have also been isolated from various
plants including Triticum aestivum L. [9], Nicotiana
tabacum L. [10], and Pisum sativum L. [11].
Although PIP, TIP, NIP and SIP subfamilies are conserved in plants, homology comparisons demonstrate
that plant aquaporins have divergent sequence and function. For example, as a result of sequence divergence,
the PIP subfamily has been classified further into two
subgroups, PIP1 and PIP2. Aquaporins from each PIP
subgroup can act individually in a different manner [12]
or may interact together as a heterodimer to facilitate
subcellular trafficking toward the plasma membrane
[13,14]. In cotton, to date four PIP members have been
characterized [15,16]. TIPs are divided phylogenetically
into 5 different subgroups [4] and δ-TIP represented the
first identified aquaporin gene in cotton [17]. The NIP
proteins were initially thought to only be present in the
nodules of nitrogen fixing legumes such as soybean
[2,18]. However, NIP proteins have also been isolated
from many non-leguminous plants including Arabidopsis [19], rice [5], and maize [20] and are known to represent a less conserved plant-specific aquaporin subfamily.
Compared to PIP and TIP aquaporin subfamilies, the
SIP aquaporin subfamily is not as well characterized. In
Arabidopsis, SIP members appear to localize to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [21]. The XIP is a newly
discovered, phylogenetically distinct subfamily and has
been found widely in moss, fungi, and dicot plants [3].
To date, extensive functional characterization of the XIP
subfamily has not been reported [7].
The role of aquaporins in plant water relations has been
demonstrated structurally and physiologically [22,23]. As

established earlier in human erythrocytes and bovine lens
cells, the functional role of plant aquaporins is quite similar to that of animal aquaporins [24,25]. As a characteristic
transmembrane channel protein, aquaporins have 6 membrane-spanning domains with two cytoplasmic termini.
An additional important structural feature is the Asn-ProAla (NPA) motif that is conserved in loops B (LB) and E
(LE), in which two NPA motifs are placed in two short,
fold-back alpha helices following second and fifth transmembrane helices, respectively. Along with aromatic/Arginine (ar/R) selective filters, this conserved NPA motif is
known to provide substrate selectivity for molecular transport [26]. The expression of each aquaporin gene member
is regulated differentially. Some aquaporins are constitutively expressed while many others are controlled in a tissue specific and environmentally sensitive manner [27,28].
In addition, proper subcellular localization represents
another layer of mechanistic regulation of aquaporin activity that probably relies on its ability to form multimers
between members of different subgroups [14].
While a great deal is known about aquaporin proteins
and the genes that encode them in a wide variety of plant
genera and species, very little is known about the aquaporins in cotton. Although the allotetraploid chromosome
structure of upland cotton makes it an excellent model
system to study polyploidization and genome duplication
by mechanisms many crops have used to evolve from
diploid ancestors [29,30], the complicated genetic structure of upland cotton challenges efforts aimed to discover
gene families such as the aquaporins. Derived from two
diploid species (AA and DD), the allopolyploid composition of the cotton genome affects gene expression primarily due to different contributions of alloalleles combined
with allele-specific gene silencing [17,31]. In fact, several
alloalleles of aquaporin genes have been described in cotton [17] and maize [32,33], although no allele-specific
gene expression analysis has been described for aquaporins. Thus, it is interesting to reveal how the evolutionally
conserved, multigene aquaporin family behaves in polyploid species such as cotton. To our knowledge there have
only been seven aquaporin genes reported from allotetraploid cotton in the literature [15-17]. Therefore, a first
step in investigating the role of aquaporins in cotton water
relations is to identify the aquaporin gene family. With
that in mind, our objective in this study was to identify
cotton aquaporin genes and investigate both their structural properties and expression patterns.

Results
Isolation of the aquaporin gene family from upland
cotton

Using PCR cloning and EST data, we identified 71 candidate cotton aquaporin genes. Information including
gene names, accession numbers, identification methods,

the length of deduced polypeptides, and gene homology
is summarized in Table 1. Twenty-five genes were identified by both PCR and EST homology searches. Twenty
genes were detected by PCR cloning alone (See Additional file 1 for the sequence information of primers
used in PCR cloning) and 26 genes were identified using
only bioinformatic database search methods. Eighteen
out of 45 PCR-generated clones were isolated repeatedly
up to ten times while 27 PCR clones were identified
once. Among these 27 PCR clones, 11 were also found
using bioinformatic database search methods. RACE
PCR was also used to clone the full-length sequence of
PIP1;11, TIP1;7, TIP2;3, and XIP1;1.
By comparing amino acid sequences of cotton aquaporins with previously identified plant aquaporins, cotton aquaporin candidates were successfully classified as
28 PIPs (15 PIP1s and 13 PIP2s), 23 TIPs (14 TIP1s and
9 other TIPs), 12 NIPs, 7 SIPs and 1 XIP (Figure 1).
Eight of the deduced amino acid sequences (PIP1;13,
PIP1;14, PIP2;11, PIP2;12, PIP2;7, TIP1;3, TIP4;2 and
NIP6;6) encoded 100% identical sequences to other
members (Additional file 2), and 63 cotton aquaporin
protein sequences (encoded from 71 genes) were phylogenetically analyzed with members from other plants
(Figure 1). As a rule, in naming the identified cotton
aquaporin genes, we followed previous nomenclature of
other plants guided by sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis. To systematically classify cotton aquaporin genes and determine phylogenetic relationships
with aquaporin genes from other plants, full-length
aquaporin members from Arabidopsis, rice, grape and
Populus were included in phylogenetic analysis and the
result is presented in Figure 1. For XIP aquaporin
comparisons, several XIPs were also added from moss
(P. patens), tomato, tobacco, and common bean [3].
Overall, cotton aquaporin genes followed the phylogenetic clustering pattern as previously reported in other
plants [4,7]. PIP subfamily members were further
divided into PIP1 and PIP2 subgroups and TIPs were
partitioned into TIP1 and two other TIP subgroups
(TIP2 and TIP4). Similar to Populus aquaporins, many
cotton PIP and TIP members had a tendency to cluster
with other members in the same subfamily. Four and
one subgroups appeared for NIP (NIP1, NIP2, NIP5,
and NIP6) and SIP (SIP1), respectively. We did not
identify cotton members of several subgroups identified
in other plants; these subgroups included TIP3, NIP3,
and NIP4. In Table 2, sequence information is summarized to show conserved amino acid residues, the prediction of transmembrane domains, and subcellular
localization.
By analyzing 197 total aquaporin genes from cotton
and several different plant species, many aquaporin
members from allotetraploid cotton appeared

phylogenetically more close to members from Populus
and grape for PIP and TIP subfamilies. The close relationship between cotton and Populus aquaporins was
less apparent for NIP, SIP, and XIP subfamilies.
Cotton aquaporin gene family
PIP

PIP1 open reading frames (ORFs) of full-length clones
were predicted to encode polypeptides of 257 - 289
amino acids in length with 82 - 100% sequence identity
in cotton. It has been shown that in many crops including cotton, there are duplicated copies of genes resulting
from genome merger and/or genome doubling [34,35].
In the present study, we identified several aquaporin
genes with very high sequence similarity sharing
99-100% identity in predicted amino acid sequences.
These candidates include ‘PIP1;1, PIP1;11, and PIP1;14',
and ‘PIP1;3, PIP1;4, PIP1;13 and PIP1;15' (Additional file
2). More detailed information for these genes including
expression analysis is summarized in Table 3. The
length of the PIP2 ORF ranged from 261 to 286 amino
acids with 71 - 100% identity. PIP2;2, PIP2;4, and PIP2;5
are 100% identical to PIP2;12, PIP2;11, and PIP2;7,
respectively. In addition, PIP2;3 and PIP2;13 shared 99%
amino acid sequence identity. PIP1 and PIP2 groups
showed 63 - 81% identity with each other. Structurally,
PIP1 had a longer extension at the N-terminus, while
PIP2 had a longer C-terminal end (Additional file 3).
However, as shown in Table 1, the overall lengths of
estimated ORFs were quite similar between PIP1 and
PIP2. All of the PIP members contained conserved dual
NPA motifs in loops B and E, respectively; whereas the
aromatic/Arg (ar/R) selectivity filter harbored identical
residues, Phe (F), His (H), Thr (T), and Arg (R) in all of
the PIP members except PIP2;8 where Phe (F) was
replaced by Val (V). In addition, four out of five (P1 to
P5) Froger’s positions, recognized as differentially conserved residues between aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins and thereby providing functional specificities, were
conserved in all of the full-length PIP sequences. Only
the P1 site was less conserved, as one of three amino
acids Glu (E), Met (M), and Gln (Q) appeared in this
position (Table 2). In addition to dual NPA motifs, the
ar/R selectivity filter, and five Froger’s positions, it was
reported that Val (V) for PIP2 and Ile (I) for PIP1 residues near the second NPA motif have been identified as
key residues for water channel activity in radish [36].
The Val (V) and Ile (I) residues were also conserved in
cotton PIP1 and PIP2 members, respectively.
TIP

The predicted polypeptides of TIP1 subfamily members
ranged from 249 - 284 amino acids in length and
showed 77 - 100% identity. However, ‘TIP1;1, TIP1;3,
and TIP1;8' and ‘TIP1;5 and TIP1;14' shared 99 - 100%

members belonged to TIP2 and TIP4 with ORF lengths
ranging from 245 to 250 amino acids and 75 - 100%

TIP2;3 and TIP2;5', ‘TIP2;6 and TIP2;7', and ‘TIP4;1 and

TIP4;2' we also observed very high sequence similarity
(Additional file 2). The ar/R selectivity filter in TIP1 was

Ser (S), Tyr (Y), and Trp (W). Conservation in the ar/R
selectivity filter and five Froger’s positions provides evidence that TIP1 aquaporins likely perform similar biological functions. In other TIPs, these predicted functional
sites were perfectly conserved within each subgroup and
P1 - P5 were Thr (T), Ser (S), Ala (A), Tyr (Y), and Trp
(W) in all TIPs (Table 2). Two conserved NPA motifs
were also observed in this subfamily. Most of the fulllength TIP protein sequences were predicted to be localized to the tonoplast or plasma membrane (Table 2).
NIP

The current study represents the first description of NIP
aquaporins from allotetraploid cotton. Lengths of predicted NIP polypeptide sequences were 259 - 288 amino
acids. Twelve NIP gene members were present in four
subgroups with a minimum of approximately 40%

identity while showing sequence identities ranging from
96 to 100% within each subgroup. Characteristic residues
were less conserved in the NIP subfamily in which low
sequence identity was evident across whole sequences.
The NPA motifs for NIP members also showed divergence inconsistent with PIP and TIP subfamilies, with
amino acid conversions from Ala (A) to Ser (S), Thr (T)
or Val (V). In two NIP5 members, Ala (A) residues from
both NPA motifs were converted to Ser (S) and Val (V)
in the first and second NPA motifs, respectively. In the
case of NIP2;1, ar/R selectivity filters were very well conserved with Populus NIP2. Four amino acid residues,
which include Gly (G), Ser (S), Gly (G), and Arg (R),
show characteristics of the NIP2;1 group that have been
identified as silicon transporters [37]. Apart from cotton
NIP2;1 and homologues in other plants (Populus and

rice), AtNIP2;1 was phylogenetically not closely related to
the NIP2;1 as shown in Figure 1. Based on EST sequence
data and PCR sequences from cDNAs and genomic
DNA, two of the NIP6 subgroup members, NIP6;1 and
NIP6;2 showed very high sequence similarity to NIP6;6
(Table 1 and Table 3).

SIP

The current study represents the first description of SIP
aquaporins from allotetraploid cotton. Predicted SIP
polypeptides had relatively short ORFs ranging from 240
to 247 amino acids (Table 1). These proteins also shared
low sequence identity with a minimum 45% and all of

Park et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/142

the identified cotton SIPs were classified phylogenetically in a single SIP1 subgroup. Sites of characteristic
residues were quite divergent compared to other subfamilies, which provides evidence of different solute permeability. An Ala (A) residue present in the first NPA
motif was converted to Thr (T) in four SIPs (Table 2).
In addition, the Asn (N) residue present in the first
NPA motif of SIP1;1 was converted to Asp (D) acid.
This amino acid change (Asn (N) to other amino acids)
is the only case of the conversion of Asn (N) in the
NPA motif among all of the cotton aquaporins.
XIP

Overall, XIP aquaporins represent a recently discovered
subfamily and the current study represents the first
characterization of the specific XIP member from
upland cotton. We identified a single, full-length cotton
XIP gene coding for a 302 amino acid polypeptide. This
polypeptide contains a distinct ar/R selectivity filter, Ile
(I), Thr (T), Val (V), and Arg (R) (Table 2). In this gene,
the first NPA motif was converted to NPV. By conducting a homology search using a D-genome G. ramondii
GrXIP EST CO092422[3] that has 88% similarity to
GhXIP1;1 at the deduced amino acid level, two additional cotton XIP EST sequences (GaXIP1;1 BG443509
and GaXIP1;2 BQ411475) were identified. These ESTs
were derived from an A-genome species G. arboreum
with identity of 96% and 61% to GhXIP1;1, respectively.
The identification of an additional G. arboreum aquaporin provides evidence that at least one additional XIP
copy may be present in the tetraploid G. hirsutum
genome.
Gene structure

By comparing exon-intron tandem arrays predicted from
several genomic and cDNA clones of cotton aquaporin
genes, several structural features of interest were
observed. PIP1;1 and PIP1;11 showed very high
sequence homology (99%) with identical exon-intron
structures and lengths (Figure 2). This structural identity
was also conserved between PIP2;4 and PIP2;9, which
were 98% identical. Moreover, these two sets of pairs
from different subgroups, although having lower
sequence homology, appeared structurally very similar.
The gene structure exhibited three introns at similar
locations, and lengths of exons and introns were almost
identical as reported earlier [9,16]. Consistent with the
observation of Liu et. al. [20], two NPA motifs were
found in the beginning of the second exon and in the
middle of the third exon, respectively.
Exons were well conserved within each aquaporin subfamily (98 - 99% on average) compared to introns (94 95% on average). Meanwhile, in spite of highly similar
exon-intron structure, the average identity between
PIP1;11 and PIP2;4 was only 70% in four exons and 48%

Page 10 of 17

in three introns (Figure 2A). This structural and
sequence similarity was also found in the TIP subfamily.
Genomic sequences of two closely related genes, TIP1;1
and TIP1;3, showed these genes had at least one intron
separating two exons. One TIP2 genomic clone identified in this study (TIP2;3) also had a similar exon-intron
structure to TIP1 genes; however, their nucleotide
sequences shared less than 65% identity (Figure 2A).
This finding provides evidence that aquaporin genes
have diverged at the nucleotide sequence level, while
preserving structural characteristics such as the exonintron splicing junction. Because of the location of primers used for genomic DNA amplification in our study,
only one intron sequence was predicted in TIP1 and
TIP2. Previously, Ferguson et al. [21] and Liu et al. [20]
reported that GhgTIP1 (GhTIP1;2) and Ghδ-TIP
(GhTIP2;1) contained two introns in their genomic
sequences. Figure 2B also showed three additional genomic clones with complex gene structure. Particularly,
NIP1;1 and NIP 6;1 genes had long introns with 3 and 4
exons, respectively. NIP6;1 and NIP6;2 also shared very
high identity between partial intron sequences (data not
shown).
Expression analysis

Previous reports have suggested that aquaporins are present in all plant tissues and are regulated temporally and
spatially depending on developmental stage and environmental conditions [38,39]. Because the level of mRNA
transcript is an important factor of gene regulation, we
initially examined the expression of a set of aquaporin
genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
Six genes from PIP (PIP1;1, PIP1;14, PIP1;3, PIP1;6,
PIP2;1, and PIP2;9), 5 genes from TIP (TIP1;8, TIP1;11,
TIP2;3, TIP2;6, and TIP2;7), 3 each from NIP (NIP1;1,
NIP2;1, and NIP6;2) and SIP (SIP1;1, SIP1;3, and
SIP1;4), and XIP1;1 were analyzed to compare the abundance of mRNA transcripts in various tissues. The plant
tissues represented were harvested from two developmental stages of roots and leaves, young stems, and
fibers (Figure 3). Most of the PIP members were
expressed in all of the tissues tested, except PIP1;6,
which was not expressed in the mature root. PIP1;1,
PIP1;14 and PIP2;9 were abundant in all tissues and
constitutively expressed compared to other PIP members (Figure 3A). PIP1;6 and PIP2;1 showed higher
expression levels in young root and mature leaf. For the
TIP aquaporins, the levels of mRNA transcripts were
variable across tissues and some were expressed tissue
specifically. TIP1;8 was detected only in stem and fiber
while TIP2;3 and TIP2;6 (TIP2;7) were most abundant
in young root (Figure 3B). In general, NIP aquaporin
genes were less abundantly expressed. Among the NIPs,
NIP1;1 had relatively higher expression in young root

whereas SIP1;3 was abundant in young root and fiber.
Interestingly, although XIP1;1 was highly expressed in
mature leaf tissues, no transcript was detected in roots
(Figure 3C).
Analysis of cotton PUT contig sequences

Assembled EST data provides a useful resource for the
identification and analyses of nucleotide sequence information. This is especially true for many polyploid crops
such as cotton and wheat [40], when whole genomic
sequences are not available. It is also important to use
this information with care - especially when dealing
with multigene families. Because sequences with high
similarity are often assembled together into a single contig, it can result in inadvertent assembly-induced
sequence recombination [41]. After we initially identified
aquaporin candidate genes, each of those genes were
blasted against PlantGDB-assembled unique transcripts
(PUT) sequences in PlantGDB http://www.plantgdb.org/.
PlantGDB is a database of plant EST sequences that are

assembled into contigs representing tentative unique
genes [42].
Initially, PUT contigs corresponding to each aquaporin gene were identified. Then, to minimize potential
errors in contig assemblies, sequence alignments of each
PUT contig were visually inspected. This was accomplished, as suggested by Dong et. al. [42], by examining
and reconstituting all sets of EST populations. Two
interesting phenomena were uncovered from this analysis as follows. First, 10 PUT sequence contigs were identified as mixtures of two or three sub-contigs that could
be separated and matched to an individual aquaporin
gene (Table 3). Second, in seven out of ten PUTs analyzed, a subset of ESTs was differentiated from one
another according to their tissue origin. Accordingly, we
separated those PUT sequences into two or three individual aquaporin genes. For example, PUT41616 consisted
of 18 ESTs which were divided into two aquaporins,
PIP1;1 and PIP1;14. Ten of the 16 ESTs for PIP1;1 originated from fiber ESTs. The remaining two ESTs
belonged to PIP1;14 and originated from stem ESTs
(Additional file 4). A similar pattern was found for
TIP2;1 and TIP2;3. In fact, both genes were isolated

independently by PCR cloning and were matched to different ESTs. However, by comparing PUT contig data,
the EST sequences representing TIP2;1 and TIP2;3 were
shown to be a part of the same PUT contig, PUT3730.
As a result of visual analysis of PUT3730, it appeared
that 16 ESTs represented TIP2;1 while TIP2;3 was

reconstituted by 12 other ESTs isolated from stem (5
ESTs) and root (2 ESTs). RT-PCR analysis also showed
that TIP2;3 was highly abundant in young root, stem
and leaf tissues, which supported the result of TIP2;3
abundance from the PUT analysis. From this analysis, it
was possible to annotate cotton aquaporin genes more

precisely. Furthermore, comparable expression data
were obtained (Table 3) that supported RT-PCR data
(Figure 3).

Discussion
Highly similar and divergent cotton aquaporin genes

The significance of the multigene family of aquaporin
transmembrane proteins is emerging from studies aimed
at optimizing water and nutrient use efficiency. This
large gene family has been shown to be highly diversified in plants and thus likely harbors functionally multifaceted behaviors in plants under various growth
circumstances. Since the global importance of cotton as
a primary natural fiber source in production agriculture
is well established, our goal in this study was to identify
all the members of the aquaporin family in the cotton
genome. Toward this end, combined efforts were
required from bioinformatic homology search and the
cloning of cDNA and genomic DNA gene fragments.
Bioinformatic sequence data of cotton are limited in
both EST databases and an available genomic sequence;
the majority of cotton EST databases consist of
sequences known to be expressed in fiber tissues [41]
and thus are not sufficient in expressed sequences from
other plant tissues.
Our combined approach enabled us to identify a total
of 71 aquaporin genes in cotton. The number of aquaporin genes described in this study almost doubles previously reported numbers within most single species and
is greater than the largest number (55 members)
recently identified Populus aquaporin genes [7]. This
increase is likely the result from highly similar aquaporin members within each aquaporin subfamily, primarily in PIP (28 in cotton vs. 15 in Populus) and TIP
subfamilies (23 in cotton vs. 17 in Populus) (Figure 1
and Table 1). Meanwhile, the number of NIP and SIP
aquaporin genes identified here are similar to the number identified in other plant species; hence, it is possible
that more genes belonging to these subfamilies are yet
to be isolated in cotton. It is also plausible that the large
number of aquaporin genes identified in this study is
somewhat inflated due to gene duplication, which has
been reported in tetraploid cotton [35]. Accordingly,
determining the genome assignment (A or D) of each
identified candidate aquaporin gene will be important to
investigate the evolutionary history of cotton aquaporin
genes during allotetraploid formation. In the case of XIP
aquaporins, thus far only one member has been cloned
in tetraploid cotton, while 6 have been cloned in Populus. From the comparison mentioned above between
cotton and Populus aquaporins, it is plausible that genome merger/doubling during cotton domestication
affected the expansion of PIP and TIP subfamilies while
NIP, SIP, and XIP subfamilies were not affected or

Page 13 of 17

subsequently deleted after genome duplication. From
the presence of three additional XIP EST sequences in
A or D genome cotton species, it is also possible that
tetraploid cotton may have evolved to contain more
copies of aquaporin genes belonging to XIP subfamily.
Also, as shown in Table 3, when we analyzed our
sequence data along with PUT assembly contig
sequences, a set of aquaporin gene pairs existed with
several nucleotide substitutions while conserving their
amino acid sequence. In these cases, most of the amino
acid sites remained unchanged in spite of nucleotide
substitution. Because we cloned PCR fragments from
allotetraploid cotton, each cloned pair of genes with
high sequence homology might represent duplicated
copies present in the A and D genomes [43].
From the preliminary analysis, it appeared that several
PCR clones identified as individual sequences belonged
to the same PUT assembly contig. Those PCR sequences
were pairs of TIP1;1 and TIP 1;3 (for PUT295101081),
TIP2;1 and TIP2;3 (for PUT3730), and NIP6;1 and
NIP6;2 (for PUT83990). Interestingly, we compared the
partial aquaporin fragment previously isolated by Smart
et al. from cotton fiber [44], and found the fragment differed from TIP2;4 and TIP2;5 by a single amino acid.
Considering the polyploid nature of upland cotton, we
decided to compare all candidate aquaporin genes with
PUT contig sequences and subsequently inspected the
assembled data visually in each PUT. This analysis
allowed us to separate genes with high sequence similarity from a unique PUT transcript into individual aquaporin genes. In the case of the PIP1;1 contig from
PlantGDB, PUT-165a-Gossypium_hirsutum-41616 consisted of 18 ESTs. Two of the 18 ESTs [GI84144149 and
GI84144380] represented a different sequence which
had 4 nucleotide differences. Therefore, we were able to
differentiate PIP1;1 and PIP1;14 from the original contig,
PUT41616 (Additional file 4). Moreover, these two ESTs
[GI84144149 and GI84144380] were derived from the
same tissue (stem). This finding prompted us to differentiate EST sequences from one another in a PUT contig assembly sequence. Because of the highly conserved
sequence similarity, this type of combined assembling
event has been previously reported when analyzing ESTs
derived from allotetraploid cotton [41]. Likewise, a PUT
contig (PUT-165a-Gossypium_hirsutum-368101081)
assembled from 13 ESTs was separated into two individual aquaporin genes. One of the two genes was PIP2;3,
originally cloned as a PCR fragment, and the other was
PIP2;13 which differs at 9 nucleotide positions from
PIP2;3 (Table 3). When predicted proteins were aligned
together, six of nine predicted amino acid positions
remained unchanged. One of the conserved positions
was a P2 Froger’s position known as a residue of functional importance (data not shown) [45]. It is also

Park et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/142

interesting that all of the EST sequences for PIP2;3 are
derived from samples containing stems while PIP2;13
ESTs are from a mixture of tissues.
Although we detected an XIP gene in cotton, to date,
XIP genes have not been identified in monocots or Arabidopsis. Hence, it is plausible that functional characteristics of XIP aquaporins have not been evolutionarily
conserved to the extent of other aquaporin subfamilies
such as PIP and TIP. Our data indicates that GhXIP1;1
does not accumulate in root tissue. However, it is highly
expressed in mature leaf tissue, and moderately in other
aerial tissues (Figure 3C). This expression data, along
with the presence of a specialized ar/R filter in XIP,
implies that XIP may have different substrate specificity
or affect solute transport in different manners from
other aquaporin subfamilies.
Sequence-function relationship in cotton aquaporins

An obvious question drawn from the existence of at
least 71 cotton aquaporin genes is why are so many
aquaporins necessary? Subcellular localization of all PIP
members is predicted to reside in the plasma membrane
(Table 2). Therefore, an abundant number of channel
proteins, PIP1 and PIP2 would be important for movement of water and other non-polar small molecules.
These PIP isoforms are known to form multimeric tetramers in vivo and in vitro. For example, PIP1 isoforms in
maize and rice are not functionally expressed alone in
oocytes. This defect is alleviated by the co-expression of
PIP2 isoforms causing the correct localization toward
the plasma membrane and/or formation of a heterotetramer [13,46,47]. Thus, the multigenic nature of aquaporins in plants might facilitate their ability to regulate
transport activities for water and other small molecules
by redundantly modulating the abundance or multiple
pairing of aquaporin water channels as demonstrated
earlier [19]. In addition, it was demonstrated that functionally distinct vacuoles were labeled with different
combinations of TIP antibodies in plant cells, supporting the diversification of the TIP subfamily in relation to
vacuolar differentiation [48]. It is important to note that
questions have been raised against the possible roles
that TIPs play as different vacuole markers [49].
Recently, using confocal microscopy, distinct subcellular
localization has been detected for ten Arabidopsis TIPs
that showed cell-type or tissue-specific expression [50].
Highly conserved residues have been shown to be
functionally important for substrate filtering and gating
of aquaporin channel proteins [51]. Considering the NIP
subfamily of aquaporins, it is noteworthy that the predicted Si transporters in the aquaporin channel protein
family belong to NIP2 aquaporin genes [52]. As demonstrated in Table 2, four amino acids (G, S, G, R) in

Page 14 of 17

NIP2;1 are very well conserved at the ar/R selectivity filter across plants including cotton [53]. However, Arabidopsis NIP2;1 is an exception, as it is impermeable to Si
and structurally less conserved compared to other
NIP2;1 members [54]. Hence, it appears that AtNIP2;1
is phylogenetically not closely related to cotton NIP2;1,
PtNIP2;1, and OsNIP2;1. Further investigations on the
role of NIP2;1/silicon transporters in cotton and other
dicot plants are needed since the Si transporter activity
of NIP2;1 has been studied predominantly in monocots.
In addition, by comparing 153 MIPs among plants and
animals, it has been demonstrated that five amino acid
residues were distinguishable between aquaporin and
glycerol channel proteins [55]. The importance of these
residues was partially confirmed by modifying two residues in P4 and P5 sites of an insect aquaporin [56].
Therefore, the ar/R selectivity filter and Froger’s position
mentioned in Table 2 will provide a basis to understand
a broad spectrum of aquaporin activities in cotton.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated that the cotton aquaporins consist of a large and highly similar multi-gene
family phylogenetically divided into 5 subfamilies. The
members of this gene family represent potential targets
to modify the water use properties of cotton and may
provide a target to manipulate water/nutrient uptake
and photosynthesis efficiency [57,58]. Despite recent
progress on the functional identification of aquaporins
[59-61], the contribution of each aquaporin protein on
substrate uptake and plant physiology remains to be elucidated. This will be achieved through sophisticated
approaches such as global expression studies, knock-out
experiments, and promoter analyses as well as substrate
specificities under various physiological conditions in
relation to water balance and nutrient uptake in cotton
and other plant systems.
Methods
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions

Young leaf, stem, and root tissues were harvested from 1
month old plants (G. hirsutum, cv. TM-1) grown in a
growth chamber (16 h light/8 h dark, 35°C/26°C). TM-1
was selected as it is considered the G. hirsutum genetic
standard and has been maintained by repeated self-pollination since its release in 1970 [62]. Mature leaf and
root tissues of TM-1 were harvested from field-grown
cotton plants at the flowering stage. Fiber tissues were
obtained 15-days post anthesis (DPA) from field grown
plants. Leaf, stem and root tissues were frozen with
liquid nitrogen and preserved at - 80°C before grinding.
Fibers were submerged in RNA-later solution (Ambion)
and stored at 4°C until RNA isolation.

RNA and DNA Isolation

All tissues were ground extensively in liquid nitrogen
using a mortar and pestle. Following the general procedure of Wan and Wilkins, RNA was isolated using the
XT buffer system with the addition of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extractions and LiCl precipitation steps
[63]. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was treated with
Turbo DNase (Ambion) followed by phenol extraction
and alcohol precipitation. For 5’- and 3'-RACE (Rapid
Amplification of cDNA Ends) PCR, mRNAs were purified using the OligoTex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen)
from each of 20 μg of total RNAs of mixed tissues
(young and mature roots and leaves, young stem). Purified mRNA was treated with Turbo DNase followed by
phenol extraction and alcohol precipitation.
Genomic DNA was also isolated from mature leaf tissue following a modification of the RNA isolation procedure. Briefly, 0.6 volume of isopropyl alcohol was mixed
with the supernatant obtained from the LiCl RNA precipitation step as above. After incubation at - 20°C for 1
hour, the precipitated pellet was dissolved in 0.9 ml of
water and then 1/3 volume of 5 M potassium acetate
solution was added followed by 30 min incubation at
-20°C. After centrifugation, DNA was precipitated by
adding 2/3 volume of isopropyl alcohol to the supernatant and incubating for 1 hour at - 20°C. After washing
with 70% alcohol, the dried pellet was resuspended in 1
ml TE buffer and DNA concentration was measured
with a UV-spectrophotometer (DU 730, Beckman
Coulter).
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

Using sequence alignment analysis of known aquaporin
genes from cotton and several other plants, conserved
sequence regions were selected for use in designing
degenerate primers in the forward and reverse direction
(Additional file 1). A suitable reaction condition for each
primer set was determined using genomic DNA prior to
the actual reaction. Amplification of aquaporin genes was
performed by RT-PCR and genomic DNA PCR using
a DNA thermocycler (DNA Engine Dyad, Bio-Rad).
RT - PCR reactions were performed with M-MuLV
Reverse Transcriptase and oligo d(T) primer. High fidelity Pfusion hot start DNA polymerase was used to
amplify desired fragments with degenerate primers following the manufacturer’s instruction (NEB). For each
primer set, a touch-down PCR condition was employed
with various annealing temperatures. Twenty ng of genomic DNA or 1/20 volume of 1st-strand cDNA product
was added as a template in a 20 μl PCR reaction volume.
PCR products were electrophoresed and size separated in
EtBr-containing agarose gels (0.8% - 1.2%) and desired
bands were recovered under UV light using an Alpha
Imager 3400 (Alpha Innotech).

Gene-cleaned PCR fragments were ligated to pCR4
Blunt-TOPO vectors followed by subsequent transformation into TOP10 E. coli competent cells. After colony
PCR and the selection of positive clones, plasmids were
isolated from bacterial clones grown in 96-well plates
and bi-directional sequencing was performed using M13
forward and M13 reverse primers. For the 5' and 3'
RACE PCR, an RNA adaptor was ligated to the 5' end
of purified and decapped full-length messenger RNA
(200 ng). Following, the ligation product was used for
first strand cDNA synthesis. After initial and nested
PCR amplification reactions (GeneRacer Kit, Invitrogen),
amplified RACE PCR products were cloned and
sequenced as above for the identification of cDNA ends.
Three to eleven recombinant plasmids per PCR fragment were subjected to bi-directional sequencing allowing for repeated isolation of identical clones from
different sources of PCR fragments corresponding to
about 660 sequencing reactions (Table 1). For the
expression study, RT-PCR was performed similarly as
mentioned above using a set of gene-specific primers.
Primers used for the expression study and RACE-PCR
are available upon request.
Homology search and sequence analysis

Sequence information from NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/) was used for various BLAST searches, including
BLASTN, BLASTX, BLASTP, and TBLASTN. Using
combinations of these blast homology searches, several
known cotton aquaporin genes were queried against the
cotton EST database to identify expressed cotton (G.
hursutum) aquaporin sequences. Sequences obtained
were analyzed by 6-frame translation to distinguish fulllength, intact ORFs from partial or pseudogene-like
incomplete sequences. To identify additional cotton
aquaporin genes, several Arabidopsis aquaporin genes
including members belonging to NIP and SIP subfamilies were also blasted by repeating homology searches.
The top three to five intact EST sequences were chosen
as candidate aquaporin genes from each homology comparison (E value below e-50 for the BLASTN). Genomic
DNA and cDNA sequences obtained from sequencing
of amplified clones were subjected to BLAST analyses
and only clones identified as aquaporins with intact coding sequences were considered further. Genomic DNA
clones were compared with ESTs, known aquaporin
genes, and cDNA clones obtained in this study to determine intron-exon linearity by positioning.
We also used PlantGDB-assembled unique transcripts
(PUT) data which provided sequence contigs assembled
by multiple alignment using EST sequences from NCBI.
All predicted amino acid sequences from cotton aquaporin genes (ESTs, cloned cDNAs and exon contigs

from cloned genomic DNA) were used for phylogenetic
analysis along with other plant aquaporin genes using
CLUSTAL W2 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/
index.html and TreeView program. The reliability of
branches in resulting trees was supported with 1,000
bootstrap resamplings.
