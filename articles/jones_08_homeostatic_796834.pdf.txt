Abstract
Background: Sleep is regulated by both a circadian and a homeostatic process. The homeostatic
process reflects the duration of prior wakefulness: the longer one stays awake, the longer and/or
more intense is subsequent sleep. In mammals, the best marker of the homeostatic sleep drive is
slow wave activity (SWA), the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum in the 0.5–4 Hz
frequency range during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In mammals, NREM sleep SWA is
high at sleep onset, when sleep pressure is high, and decreases progressively to reach low levels in
late sleep. Moreover, SWA increases further with sleep deprivation, when sleep also becomes less
fragmented (the duration of sleep episodes increases, and the number of brief awakenings
decreases). Although avian and mammalian sleep share several features, the evidence of a clear
homeostatic response to sleep loss has been conflicting in the few avian species studied so far. The
aim of the current study was therefore to ascertain whether established markers of sleep
homeostasis in mammals are also present in the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys
gambelii), a migratory songbird of the order Passeriformes. To accomplish this goal, we investigated
amount of sleep, sleep time course, and measures of sleep intensity in 6 birds during baseline sleep
and during recovery sleep following 6 hours of sleep deprivation.
Results: Continuous (24 hours) EEG and video recordings were used to measure baseline sleep
and recovery sleep following short-term sleep deprivation. Sleep stages were scored visually based
on 4-sec epochs. EEG power spectra (0.5–25 Hz) were calculated on consecutive 4-sec epochs.
Four vigilance states were reliably distinguished based on behavior, visual inspection of the EEG,
and spectral EEG analysis: Wakefulness (W), Drowsiness (D), slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapideye movement (REM) sleep. During baseline, SWA during D, SWS, and NREM sleep (defined as D
and SWS combined) was highest at the beginning of the major sleep period and declined thereafter.
Moreover, peak SWA in both SWS and NREM sleep increased significantly immediately following
sleep deprivation relative to baseline.
Conclusion: As in mammals, sleep deprivation in the white-crowned sparrow increases the
intensity of sleep as measured by SWA.

Background
Sleep is regulated by both a circadian and a homeostatic
process. The circadian process is the reflection of an
endogenously generated rhythm that serves to constrain
sleep to the appropriate time throughout the 24-hour
period. The homeostatic process is a reflection of the duration of prior wakefulness: extending the duration of wakefulness results in a compensatory increase in the intensity
and/or duration of subsequent sleep, suggesting that sleep
has some important, and yet unknown, functions [1]. A
vast amount of data indicates that the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the low frequency range (0.5–4
Hz) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, referred
to as slow wave activity (SWA, or delta activity), is currently the best marker of the homeostatic sleep drive in
mammals. NREM SWA (from now on SWA) declines during normal sleep, with SWA lowest toward the end of a
sleep period when sleep need is minimal. Sleep deprivation results in increases in SWA during recovery sleep relative to normal physiological sleep; this phenomenon has
been demonstrated in a variety of mammalian species
including humans, squirrels, rats, mice and hamsters [28]. Further evidence for SWA as a marker of sleep need and
intensity is provided by the fact that SWA increases in a
regional, use-dependent manner; those brain regions that
undergo the greatest waking-associated activity also show
the highest regional increases in SWA during subsequent
sleep [9-14]. Recent data also suggests that SWA increases
specifically in those brain regions that during waking have
presumably undergone synaptic potentiation. For
instance, SWA increases locally after a learning task and is
positively correlated with post-sleep performance
improvement [15], suggesting that SWA may represent
more than a measure of sleep need and intensity, but may
in fact mediate the restorative function of NREM sleep
[15-17].
Avian and mammalian sleep share several important features. Notably, birds are the only non-mammalian class to
show both rapid eye movement (REM) and NREM sleep
[18]. Although little data are available on sleep regulatory
mechanisms in birds, the few published studies suggest
that both the neural and neurochemical control of REM
and NREM sleep likely overlap between the two classes
[19,20]. Moreover, as in mammals, sleep amounts in
birds are higher during early developmental periods, and
sleep quality and quantity decline with age [21,22]. Furthermore, sleep loss has shown to negatively impact performance and vigilance in both birds and mammals,
whereas sleep itself has been implicated in learning processes in both classes [15,23-25]. Despite the considerable
differences in morphology and cytology of the mammalian neocortex and the avian telencephalon, recent gene
expression profiling of the avian telencephalon during
sleep and wakefulness have also identified a remarkable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/47

degree of overlap between vigilance state-related gene
expression in these two vertebrate classes, suggesting that
the cellular consequences of sleep and waking are phylogenetically conserved [26-28].
Notwithstanding these similarities, however, the available
evidence for homeostatic sleep regulation in birds is conflicting. A declining trend in SWA across the night, a pattern similar to that observed in mammals, has been
observed in the domestic hen [29], the European blackbird [30], and the white-crowned sparrow [25]. However,
24 hours of sleep deprivation in another avian species, the
pigeon, resulted in small increases in the duration of total
NREM and REM sleep in the subsequent sleep period, but
no compensatory increase in SWA was reported [31].
Moreover, in the white-crowned sparrow during the
migratory season, despite an average reduction in nocturnal sleep of 60%, no evidence of a compensatory increase
in SWA was observed in the small amount of nocturnal
sleep that was obtained [25]. Thus, whether birds have
specialized mechanisms for dispensing with NREM sleep
need remains unclear. The aim of the current study was
therefore to ascertain whether sleep loss in the whitecrowned sparrow leads to compensatory increases in SWA
during the subsequent sleep period. To accomplish this
goal, we investigated SWA dynamics in 6 wild-caught
white-crowned sparrows, in baseline sleep relative to
recovery sleep following 6 hours of sleep deprivation.

Results
Electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of baseline
vigilance states
Four behavioral states could be reliably distinguished
based on visual inspection of the EEG and behavioral
analysis: wakefulness, drowsiness, slow wave sleep (SWS)
and REM sleep. Representative examples of EEG records of
each vigilance state are shown in Figure 1A. Although
movement artifacts were frequent during feeding and
wing flapping, EEG recordings immediately before and
after such behaviors showed a low-amplitude, high-frequency EEG in both hemispheres. As in other studies of
songbirds [25,32], the EEG activity during drowsiness was
intermediate between that of wakefulness and SWS, with
increased amplitude in the low-frequency range relative to
wakefulness. Behaviorally, birds in the drowsy state were
readily distinguishable from wakeful birds or birds in SWS
or REM sleep: they typically stood facing the center of the
room with their head held close to the body and often
moving from side to side. The position of the eyelids fluctuated between open, partially open, and completely
closed. This behavior was intermittently interrupted by
the birds opening their eyes completely, apparently in
response to environmental stimuli. High-amplitude, lowfrequency EEG activity reached its peak during SWS, when
the birds were motionless, with eyes always closed and

head either positioned beneath the wing, hanging forward
or tucked in tightly toward the body. Sleep spindles, a
characteristic feature of NREM sleep in mammals, were
not visually detected, a finding consistent with other studies in birds [18]. Interhemispheric asymmetries in EEG
during SWS were also not visually detected. REM sleep
was characterized by low-amplitude high-frequency EEG
activity similar to that occurring during wakefulness. REM
sleep never occurred after an epoch of drowsiness, but
only following an episode of unequivocal SWS. Since
birds do not become atonic during REM sleep, activity
recorded from the nuchal muscles is not always a reliable
measure of this state in birds [18]. As a result, muscle
recordings were not used in this study to distinguish

behavioral states. However, behavioral signs of reduced
muscle tone made REM sleep readily distinguishable from
brief periods of awakening. Specifically, during REM sleep
the eyes were closed and the head either rolled to one side
or fell forward. Evidence of hypotonia was often indicated
by drooping of the wing. In some cases, birds would sway
and lose their balance on the perch. Figure 1B shows the
24-hour hypnograms during baseline for each of the 6
birds used in this study. The hypnograms on the bottom
of this figure are representative examples of 1-hour recordings during the first and the last part of the dark phase,
and show the rapid transition from one behavioral state to
the other characteristic of sleep in these sparrows.

As previously described, white-crowned sparrows show a
clear preference for diurnal waking and nocturnal sleep
[25]. Specifically, as seen in Figure 1B and 2, SWS and
REM sleep never occurred during the light phase, and
while periods of drowsiness could be seen, their frequency
varied across birds. Waking occupied 85.3 ± 4.3% of the
light period and 17.0 ± 1.8% of the dark period, declining
sharply following lights-off and reaching its minimum
approximately 3 hours before lights-on (Fig. 2A–B). As
described previously in other passerines [25,32], the per-

centage of drowsiness remained fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, comprising 14.6 ± 4.3% of the
light period and 22.0 ± 2.3% of the dark period. However,
drowsiness showed a sharp increase in the first hour after
lights-off, followed by a steady decline each hour until rising again in the hour before lights-on. SWS occupied most
of the dark phase (59.5% ± 2.8). The first episode of SWS
occurred approximately 1 hour after lights-off, and time
spent in SWS rose steadily throughout the nocturnal
period. State transitions during the nocturnal period were

frequent, however, and SWS episodes were short, lasting
on average only 5 minutes, interrupted by brief periods of
drowsiness and wakefulness. REM occupied 1.5 ± 0.1% of
the dark period (representing 1.8 ± 0.15% of total sleep
time), a finding consistent with a number of published
reports in both domestic and wild birds [21,29,31,33-36].
Although episodes of REM were short (mean ± SEM, 5.2 ±
0.2 sec), clusters of REM separated by a few seconds of
SWS occurred frequently throughout the night. In a pattern similar to humans and other mammals [4,8] the proportion of time spent in REM sleep increased across the
night, reaching a maximum 4 hours before lights-on (Fig.
2B, inset).
Spectral analysis of baseline EEG
Figure 3A shows the EEG power spectrum (0.5–25 Hz)
during drowsiness, SWS and REM sleep expressed as percentage of the waking EEG spectrum. Relative to waking,
both drowsiness and SWS showed significantly higher
EEG power in the 0.5–15 Hz range, while REM sleep
showed significant decreases for most frequencies > 13 Hz
(Fig. 3A). The EEG power in the SWA range was significantly higher in SWS compared to waking, drowsiness,
and REM sleep (Fig. 3B). SWA was also significantly
higher in drowsiness relative to waking (Fig. 3B). As
shown in Figure 3C, SWA declined across the dark period,
being highest in the first 2-hour interval following lightsoff. A similar trend of declining SWA was also evident for
drowsiness, and when SWA was calculated for all of
NREM sleep (Fig. 3C, right panel). Thus, SWA changes
during baseline sleep mimic those seen in rodents and
other mammals, i.e. SWA is highest at the beginning of
the major sleep period and declines thereafter.
Sleep deprivation and recovery
Sparrows were subjected to total sleep deprivation during
the first 6 hours of the dark period. The sleep deprivation
procedure was effective at maintaining levels of wakefulness near 100% (96.1% ± 2.8). SWS and REM sleep were
completely eliminated, although a small percentage of
drowsiness did occur during the deprivation. The time
course of vigilance states for the 6-hour sleep deprivation
period followed by the 8-hour of recovery period is shown
in Figure 4A. The amount and distribution of SWS and
drowsiness did not differ during recovery relative to baseline, but the percentage of REM sleep decreased significantly during the first 2 hours of recovery. The latency to
drowsiness decreased significantly after sleep deprivation,
and the latency to SWS showed a trend toward a decrease
(Fig. 4B).

Figure 5A shows the changes for each 0.25 Hz frequency
bin in the entire (0.5–25 Hz) EEG power spectrum for
drowsiness, SWS, and the 2 states combined (NREM
sleep) for the first three 2-hour intervals following sleep

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/47

deprivation. During the first 2 hours of recovery, both
drowsiness and SWS showed widespread increase in EEG
power across most frequencies. These changes declined in
the second 2-hour period, and disappeared almost completely by the sixth hour of recovery. Figure 5B shows
changes for the SWA band (0.5–4.0 Hz) during the first 8
hours after sleep deprivation. Mean SWA during drowsiness was increased, relative to the same time of day in
baseline, during the first 2 hours after sleep deprivation,
but its levels in recovery were never higher than those
reached at sleep onset during baseline. SWA during SWS
was also higher, during the first 4 hours after sleep deprivation, relative to SWA at the same circadian time in baseline. Moreover, mean SWA during the first 2 hours of
recovery was higher than the highest values reached in
baseline after light offset, although the change did not
reached statistical significance (p = 0.08). When SWA was
calculated for drowsiness and SWS together, the mean 2h value during recovery was increased at almost significance level (p = 0.05; Fig 5B). The relatively high variability in SWA changes after recovery was due to one single
animal, which did not show appreciable SWA rebound
after sleep deprivation.
Figure 5C shows the build-up of SWA during the first 2
hours after sleep onset at higher temporal resolution, i.e.
by plotting SWA values in 10-min intervals. Relative to
baseline, the SWA increase during recovery sleep was
faster and reached significantly higher values in NREM
sleep in the first hour after sleep onset. SWA in drowsiness
also significantly increased in the first 20 to 40 minutes of
recovery sleep relative to baseline. Finally, peak SWA in
both SWS and NREM sleep during the first 2 hours after
sleep onset reached significantly higher levels during
recovery relative to baseline (p < 0.05).
In mammals, other markers of increased sleep intensity
after sleep loss include an increase in the duration of sleep
episodes, and a decrease in the number of brief awakenings [37-39]. Figure 6A shows the changes in sleep episode duration after sleep deprivation relative to baseline.
During the first hour of recovery sleep, the episode duration for NREM sleep and total sleep (NREM + REM)
increased significantly relative to the first hour of baseline
sleep (p < 0.05), but not relative to the same time of day
during baseline. The duration of REM sleep episodes did
not differ at sleep onset after sleep deprivation relative to
baseline, but it significantly decreased at hour 9 relative to
the same time of day during baseline. Across the entire 8hour recovery period (from the end of sleep deprivation
until light onset) neither the mean duration of REM sleep
episodes nor their number changed after sleep deprivation relative to baseline (mean ± SEM, baseline vs recovery, duration in seconds = 5.2 ± 0.2 vs 5.1 ± 0.2; number
= 125.8 ± 4.0 vs 111.2 ± 17.5). Figure 6B shows that the

number of brief awakenings showed a tendency to
decrease (p < 0.07) during the first hour of recovery sleep
relative to the first hour of baseline sleep. By contrast, the
number of brief awakenings increased significantly at
hour 7 and 11 in recovery sleep when compared to the
same circadian time in baseline sleep.

Discussion
The electrophysiological correlates of wakefulness and
sleep we found in the white-crowned sparrow are similar

to those described in other avian species [8]. The amount
of REM sleep we report here, however, is lower than previously reported in the white-crowned sparrow [25]. One
possible explanation for this discrepancy is the different
criteria used to score REM sleep in the 2 studies. In the previous report vigilance state was sampled across the 24hour period by scoring the first 4 seconds of each minute,
whereas in the current study every 4-sec epoch was scored
consecutively across the 24-hour period.

Changes in sleep episodes duration and brief awakenings after sleep deprivation. A. Duration of episodes of drowsiness, SWS, NREM, REM and total (NREM + REM) sleep during baseline (BSL) and recovery (Rec) sleep, plotted in 1-hour
intervals beginning at sleep onset. Values (in minutes or seconds) are expressed as mean (± SEM, n = 6). For drowsiness, SWS
and NREM an episode was defined as a period of continuous drowsiness or SWS lasting > 16 seconds and occurring without
any waking interruption lasting > 16 seconds. A REM episode was defined as any occurrence of one or more consecutive
epochs of REM sleep preceded and followed by any other behavioral state (no interruptions allowed). B. Number of brief
awakenings during baseline (BSL) and recovery (Rec) sleep plotted in 1-hour intervals beginning at sleep onset. Values are
expressed as mean (± SEM, n = 6) number of brief awakenings per hour of sleep. A brief awakening was defined as a brief waking period (<16 seconds) preceded and followed by at least one 4-sec epoch of SWS or drowsiness. Triangles depict significant
difference between recovery sleep relative to the same circadian time during baseline sleep. Note that the number of brief
awakenings at the beginning of recovery sleep shows a trend to be lower (p < 0.07, paired t-test) than at the beginning of baseline sleep.
Interhemispheric EEG asymmetries have been described
in a number of avian species [40], but we were unable to
detect them in the white-crowned sparrow. This may
reflect a genuine species difference, or may be due to technical limitations in our experimental setup. There are relatively small differences in the amplitude of the EEG
signal between wakefulness and SWS in the bird, and visual scoring may fail to detect all but the most extreme

examples of interhemispheric asymmetries. Another possible explanation is that unihemispheric sleep occurs
mainly in some environmental conditions, for instance
when birds are under the risk of predation [41,42], and
may have little immediate adaptive value under standard
housing conditions such as those used in our experiments.

The analysis of the relative power spectra in baseline sleep
revealed that the EEG power in the SWA range (0.5–4 Hz)
was significantly higher in NREM sleep relative to all other
behavioral states, as expected. We also observed a marked
decline in SWA over the course of the night, with EEG
power in the 0.5–4 Hz range being highest in the first 2-h
interval after sleep onset and declining steadily afterwards. During drowsiness, the EEG power in the SWA
range was significantly higher relative to waking, and significantly lower relative to SWS, thus providing additional
evidence that drowsiness can be considered a distinct
state. Moreover, SWA in drowsiness also showed a declining trend across the nocturnal period similar to that seen
in SWS, suggesting that in both states SWA is homeostatically regulated.
Following 6 hours of sleep deprivation, neither the
amount nor the temporal distribution of SWS or drowsiness changed during the 12-hour recovery sleep period
relative to baseline sleep. This result is consistent with the
effects observed following short-term sleep deprivation in
mammals, where often only markers of sleep intensity
such as SWA change during recovery sleep, while NREM
sleep duration may not increase. REM sleep duration also
did not change during recovery sleep, but we observed a
significant decrease in the latency to REM sleep in the first
2-hour interval of recovery sleep. In the rat, sleep deprivation of 3, 6 or 12 hours resulted in a small REM rebound
[43,44], and in the mouse a prominent REM rebound was
evident after deprivations as short as 6 hours [7]. In the
pigeon, both 24 hours and long-term sleep deprivation
(several days) resulted in a pronounced REM rebound,
suggesting that REM is homeostatically regulated in the
bird [31,45]. Thus, the lack of REM rebound in our study
is likely a consequence of the short duration of the deprivation period, rather than a reflection of a lack of homeostatic regulation of REM sleep in this species.
The latency to the first episode of drowsiness decreased
significantly during the recovery sleep period, and a trend
toward a decrease in the latency to SWS was also observed.
The decreased latency to drowsiness is perhaps not surprising given that drowsiness appears to represent a form
of vigilant sleep and undoubtedly fulfills some of the
requirements of sleep. Although sleep pressure may have
been higher following the deprivation, the stress of having
a predator (human) in the room for six hours may have
induced a conflict between the need for continued vigilance and the need for sleep, and led to an immediate
attempt to reduce sleep pressure through means other
than frank sleep. Indeed, a previous report of migratory
sleeplessness in the white-crowned sparrow indicated that
although NREM sleep was reduced considerably during
the migratory period, drowsiness was increased signifi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/47

cantly, suggesting that drowsiness is capable of dissipating
at least some level of sleep need [25].
Spectral analysis of the EEG following sleep deprivation
also revealed changes in the SWA consistent with results
described in mammals. Specifically, relative to baseline,
SWA during recovery sleep reached significantly higher
values in both SWS and NREM sleep in the first hour after
sleep onset. SWA in drowsiness also significantly
increased in the first 20 to 40 minutes after sleep onset.
Finally, peak SWA in both SWS and NREM sleep during
the first 2 hours after sleep onset reached significantly
higher levels during recovery relative to baseline, indicating that at the beginning of baseline night SWA values
were still below saturation. Interestingly, as in mammals,
the first 2 hours of recovery sleep in sparrows were characterized by large increases in EEG power not only in the
low frequency range, but also across most frequencies in
the 10 to 20 Hz range. These changes in the high frequency range declined in the second 2-hour interval and
disappeared entirely by the sixth hour of recovery sleep,
and their origin and physiological significance remain
unclear. It has recently been suggested, however, that prolonged wakefulness results in stronger cortico-cortical
connections, which in turn would drive greater neuronal
synchronization during sleep, leading to increased EEG
power across all frequencies [17]. In sparrows, the
increase in EEG power in the spindle frequency range
(12–16 Hz) is especially intriguing, because spindles were
not detected by visual scoring. In mammals, spindles and
SWA reflect different but related aspects of cortical bistability, because they are thought to reflect the up states and
the down states of the slow oscillation, respectively
[46,47]. It is currently unknown whether this is also true
in sparrows.
In mammals, sleep deprivation is followed not only by an
increase in SWA, but also by an increase in the duration of
sleep episodes and a decrease in the number of brief awakenings [37-39]. Human studies show that SWA during
NREM sleep is mainly determined by the prior history of
sleep and wakefulness and not by circadian mechanisms
[48,49]. The evidence for the other markers of sleep consolidation is more limited, but suggests instead that both
homeostatic and circadian factors are important [50]. As
shown in Figure 6, when the first hour of recovery sleep
was compared to the first hour of baseline sleep we found
trends similar to those described in the mammalian literature (longer sleep episodes, fewer brief awakenings after
sleep deprivation). However, when these behavioral
measures were compared at the same time of day, changes
were either no longer present (duration of NREM sleep
episodes), or in the opposite direction (the number of
brief awakenings increased after sleep deprivation). Thus,
the current data show clear evidence for a post-sleep dep-

BMC Neuroscience 2008, 9:47

rivation increase in sleep intensity as measured by SWA,
while the evidence using other markers of sleep consolidation is mixed.
A previous report in the pigeon failed to identify increases
in SWA following 24 hours of sleep deprivation [31],
although a significant decline in waking duration following sleep deprivation was reported, suggesting that sleep
pressure was indeed higher after the deprivation. As mentioned before, increased sleep pressure following deprivation may be discharged as an increase in sleep duration
and/or intensity, and the duration of the deprivation may
affect one parameter more than another. Thus, it is possible that the lack of a SWA rebound in the pigeon was due
to the relatively long sleep deprivation procedure used in
that study (24 hours). In rats, if wakefulness is enforced
more than 12–24 hours, a significant amount of NREM
may "leak" into the sleep deprivation period [51]. This
raises the possibility that the pigeon was able to obtain
significant amounts of SWA during the 24-hour deprivation, either through drowsiness or through local sleep
within select neuronal populations. Furthermore, is worth
noting that in our study the most significant effects of
sleep loss on SWA were seen when we looked specifically
at peak SWA or using high temporal resolution (10-min
bins), which was not done in the pigeon study [31]. Further support for the idea of SWA leakage during prolonged
sleep loss is provided by an early study of sleep deprivation using constant light in the pigeon [52]. The authors
reported a near elimination of sleep for more than 10
days, with no subsequent increases in either total sleep
time or SWA during recovery sleep. Based on these data,
they concluded that pigeons do not show a mammalianlike compensatory rebound in SWA following sleep deprivation. However, the overall SWA was actually preserved
across the entire sleep deprivation period in constant
light, which may provide a reasonable explanation of why
no rebound in SWA occurred during recovery sleep. Sleep
restriction paradigms that preserve the overall 24-hour
SWA amount are similarly not followed by SWA rebound
[53]. Thus, SWA rebound is observed during recovery
sleep after short but not after long sleep deprivation most
likely because only the latter forces SWA to intrude into
waking during the sleep deprivation period. In agreement
with this interpretation, a recent report of recovery sleep
in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation (8
hours) shows that, like in sparrows, SWA does increase
during recovery sleep relative to baseline sleep [54].
During the migratory season, captive white-crowned sparrows reduced nocturnal sleep by ~60%, with no evidence
of increased SWA in the small amount of nocturnal sleep
they do obtain [25]. Remarkably, despite this sleep loss,
migrating birds remained capable of engaging in adaptive
waking behaviors [25]. The preservation of performance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/47

and motivation during the migratory period suggests that
migrants may have evolved adaptations to combat the
negative consequences of sleep loss, or that natural selection may have promoted alternative mechanisms for
sleep-loss compensation. Interestingly, during the migratory period, a significant increase in daytime drowsiness,
as well as a trend toward an increase in nocturnal drowsiness was reported [25]. Although spectral analysis of nocturnal sleep was performed, no quantitative analysis of
drowsiness was possible. The present findings suggest that
short episodes of drowsiness are associated with a significant amount of EEG activity in the SWA range. Thus, it is
possible that daytime drowsiness offers sufficient recuperative opportunities for the migratory white-crowned sparrow, while at the same time only marginally increasing the
risk of predation. Interestingly, mammals that exhibit
large amounts of drowsiness, such as ungulates, typically
show reduced quantities of SWS, lending support to the
idea that drowsiness can partially compensate for SWS
[55]. A quantitative analysis of the EEG during migration
will help address this issue definitively.

Conclusion
The current study shows that in the white-crowned sparrow, as in all mammals studied to date, extending the
period of wakefulness leads to compensatory increases in
sleep intensity as measured by SWA during the subsequent sleep period. Since SWA homeostasis is thought to
reflect sleep need and thus is a window on sleep function,
these data may suggest that at least one fundamental function of sleep is conserved across species.

Methods
Animals
White-crowned sparrows were captured in their wintering
grounds in the Sacramento valley in California (lat 39°00'
N, long 122°00' E) in March 2005. All birds were collected using mist nets under the authority of a United
States Fish and Wildlife Service permit. Birds were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where
they were individually housed in galvanized wire cages (L:
35 cm × W: 25 cm × H: 32 cm) in environmentally controlled rooms (40% relative humidity). Each bird was in
visual and auditory contact with other birds in the room.
The colony was exposed to photoperiodic conditions
designed to simulate seasonal lighting changes. As a result
of the fluctuating photoperiod, in the 14 days following
surgery, birds were exposed to photoperiods ranging from
10:25; 13:75 light: dark (LD) to 10:00;14:00 LD. On the
deprivation and recovery days light onset was at 07:30
and light offset at 17:30. Illuminance during the light
phase was 560–640 lux measured at the level of the cage
floor. Illuminance during the dark phase was less than 0.5
lux. Birds were fed a mixed-seed and provided water ad
libitum, and their diet was supplemented daily with let-

tuce, dried insects, live mealworms, and grit. Six adult
white-crowned sparrows were randomly selected from our
captive population and surgically instrumented for
chronic EEG recording. Since male and female whitecrowned sparrows are not morphologically distinct, gender matching was not possible. Gender determination was
made after death and shown to consist of 4 males and 2
females.
EEG surgery
Surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane
anesthesia (1.0%–3.5% isoflurane with 500 ml/min O2).
The bird's head was stabilized in a stereotaxic device (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, California, United States), cranial
feathers were removed and an incision was made along
the midline of the head to expose the cranium. Six small
holes were drilled through the cranium to the dura: four
holes for EEG electrodes, one for a reference electrode,
and one for the ground electrode. Two holes were drilled
on each hemisphere of the anterior forebrain 2 mm lateral
to the midline over the hyperpallium (Wulst). Two additional holes were drilled 2 mm posterior to the anterior
holes so that signal was recorded from both the anterior
and posterior hyperpallium. Two holes were positioned
over the midline of the cerebellum to accommodate the
common reference electrode and the ground. Teflon insulated stainless steel electrodes (#791400, A-M Systems
Sequim, Washington, United States) were inserted
through the holes to the level of the dura and held in place
with surgical glue. Each electrode was connected to a lightweight, flexible, and electrically shielded recording cable
(Dragonfly, Ridgeley, West Virginia, United States). The
cable was attached to the skull using dental acrylic (Justi
Products, Oxnard, California, United States), and the incision was closed around the acrylic with surgical adhesive
(Tissuemend II, Veterinary Products Laboratories, Phoenix, Arizona, United States). Following surgery, each bird
was placed in the recording cage (L: 35 cm × W: 25 cm ×
H: 32 cm) for at least 14 days of postoperative recovery
and adaptation to the recording cable. The recording cable
was attached to a low-torque, six-channel mercury commutator (Dragonfly) designed for use with small birds.
Under these conditions birds were able to move unimpeded throughout the cage.
Sleep deprivation
Six birds were sleep deprived for six hours starting at dark
onset. Throughout the sleep deprivation period, birds
were never handled; walking quietly past the cages was
sufficient to maintain vigilant wakefulness for the 6-hour
period. To diminish the effects of stress, birds were acclimated to this procedure for 30 minutes every day during
the week preceding the experimental day. In addition to
electrophysiological recordings, behavior was also continuously recorded using 16 infrared-sensitive cameras (two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/47

per bird) connected to a digital video storage system (Salient Systems, Austin, Texas, United States). Infrared illuminators provided lighting for the cameras during the dark
phase. Animal protocols followed the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were in accordance with institutional guidelines.
EEG acquisition and power spectrum analysis
EEG signals were obtained from two anterior and two posterior EEG channels for each bird during a 24-hour baseline day, a 6-hour sleep deprivation period starting at dark
onset, and an 8-hour recovery period. Of the 4 available
EEG derivations for each animal, the one with the smallest
number of artifacts was selected for spectral analysis (left
anterior n = 4, right anterior n = 1, left posterior n = 1).
EEG signals were amplified, and band-pass filtered (0.1to 30 Hz, additional notch filter was set at 60 Hz), using
Grass-Telefactor amplifiers (model 12 Neurodata and
7P511, Grass-Telefactor, West Warwick, Rhode Island,
United States), digitized at 1000 Hz, decimated to 100 Hz,
and visualized using Somnologica 3 software (Medcare,
Reykjavik, Iceland). EEG power spectra were computed
for 4-sec epochs by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) routine
(Hanning window, 0.25 Hz resolution) within the frequency range of 0.5–25.0 Hz. Differences were tested with
ANOVA for repeated measures and two-tailed paired ttests. For data and signal analysis the software package
MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was
used. Epochs that were scored but contained EEG artifacts
were marked and omitted from further analysis of the
spectra (number of artifacts during baseline, expressed as
percentage of total 24-hour recording time: 46.5 ± 3.8% of
recording time; more than 93% were waking artifacts).
Differences in EEG spectra between baseline and recovery
periods were tested with two-way ANOVA's for repeated
measures. Contrasts were tested by post hoc two-tailed ttests (for equal variances)
Vigilance state scoring
Vigilance states were scored in 4-sec epochs using both
EEG and behavioral recordings, and categorized as either
wakefulness, drowsiness, SWS, or REM sleep. Because in
birds nuchal muscle activity does not show a consistent or
appreciable reduction in amplitude during REM sleep
[29,31,32], we chose to rely on video monitoring of
behavioral state to aid in the differentiation between REM
and waking. Initial assessments of vigilance state were
made based on visual inspection of the EEG as well as by
analysis of recorded behavior using the following criteria.
Wakefulness was characterized by a high-frequency lowamplitude EEG in both hemispheres. Behavior during
wakefulness included hopping and flying around the
cage, feeding, drinking, feather preening, and actively
scanning the room. During drowsiness EEG activity was
intermediate between that of wakefulness and SWS sleep

(i.e., increased amplitude in the low-frequency range relative to wakefulness). During the drowsy state, birds held
their heads close to their bodies, and the position of the
eyelids fluctuated between open, partially closed, and
completely closed states. During SWS sleep, EEG activity
was dominated by slow waves of the highest amplitude.
Behaviorally birds were motionless, with closed eyes; the
head was either pulled in toward the body and facing forward or resting on the bird's back. A 4-sec epoch was
scored as REM sleep if for > 2 sec the EEG amplitude was
reduced by at least one-half the amplitude seen in the previous SWS episode and this amplitude reduction was
accompanied by behavioral signs of REM including muscle hypotonia (feather or head drooping) or, rarely, eye
movements.
