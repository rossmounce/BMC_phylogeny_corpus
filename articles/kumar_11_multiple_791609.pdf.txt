Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to describe a novel trimethoprim resistance gene cassette, designated
dfrA30, within a class 1 integron in a facultatively oligotrophic, multiple antibiotic and human serum resistant test
strain, MB45, in a population of oligotrophic bacteria isolated from the river Mahananda; and to test the efficiency
of surface bound acetate on zinc oxide quantum dots (ZnO QDs) as bactericidal agent on MB45.
Methods: Diluted Luria broth/Agar (10-3) media was used to cultivate the oligotrophic bacteria from water sample.
Multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria were selected by employing replica plate method. A rapid assay was
performed to determine the sensitivity/resistance of the test strain to human serum. Variable region of class 1
integron was cloned, sequenced and the expression of gene coding for antibiotic resistance was done in
Escherichia coli JM 109. Identity of culture was determined by biochemical phenotyping and 16S rRNA gene
sequence analyses. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on representative trimethoprim resistancemediating DfrA proteins retrieved from GenBank. Growth kinetic studies for the strain MB45 were performed in
presence of varied concentrations of ZnO QDs.
Results and conclusions: The facultatively oligotrophic strain, MB45, resistant to human serum and ten antibiotics
trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, gentamycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime,
kanamycin and streptomycin, has been identified as a new strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. A novel dfr gene,
designated as dfrA30, found integrated in class 1 integron was responsible for resistance to trimethoprim in
Klebsiella pneumoniae strain MB45. The growth of wild strain MB45 was 100% arrested at 500 mg/L concentration
of ZnO QDs. To our knowledge this is the first report on application of ZnO quantum dots to kill multiple
antibiotics and serum resistant K. pneumoniae strain.

Background
Klebsiellae are ubiquitously present in nature and have
been isolated from wide variety of habitats like-human
body parts, animals, sewage, soils, vegetation, lakes, salt
water, brackish water, fresh water and sachet water
[1-3]. Generally, they are opportunistic pathogen for
humans and other animals [1]. At present, nine validly
published species have been reported for Klebsiella
[4,5]. The genus comprises of non-motile, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria having a prominent polysaccharide capsule which encloses the total cell surface and

renders resistance against several host defense mechanisms [6-8]. Strains of K. pneumoniae conferring resistance to an extended spectrum b-lactams, carbapenems,
cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, flouroquinolones
together with the trimethoprim (TMP) and cotrimoxazole and other antibiotics, have been isolated from different clinical setup [9-13]. Trimethoprim is used as
primary drug in the prophylaxis and treatment of both
urinary and respiratory tract infections [14]. Resistance
to trimethoprim is caused by modifications in the target
enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, encoded by dfr genes
located either on plasmid or chromosome [15-20]. Different dfrA genes (> 25) conferring resistance to trimethoprim have been reported and 15 of them were
integron-borne [15,21-23]. Integrons are genetic

elements that contain determinants of a site-specific
recombination system by which they can excise or integrate gene cassettes (mobile element), usually antibiotic
resistance genes encoding antimicrobial resistance
[24,25]. Presence of class 1 integrons is documented in
both eutrophic and oligotrophic bacteria isolated from
Indian rivers of northern West Bengal [23,26]. There
were number of attempts to cultivate oligotrophic bacteria using different diluted media [27,28] including R2A
media [29]. Recently, diluted Luria broth (LB) was used
to cultivate oligotrophic bacteria from environmental
sample [23,30]. There are reports on oligotrophic bacteria isolated from clinical materials [28] and quite a
good number of oligotrophic bacteria in river waters
exhibit antibiotic resistance [23,30]. Hence, oligotrophs
could be a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance
genes that can be acquired by pathogens through
diverse gene transfer mechanisms. Due to their potential
clinical importance, oligotrophic bacteria merit attention. The prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria among pathogens and by-standers (normally not
pathogenic but becomes virulent under immunosuppressive conditions) poses a severe threat to public health
worldwide. It is difficult to eradicate antibiotic resistant
pathogenic bacteria which can survive in low nutrient
condition for a long period of time (oligotrophs). As
mortality and morbidity rate due to infection by multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacteria is on rise, novel therapeutic strategies are being devised to combat this
problem. Metal oxide nanoparticles have shown antimicrobial property (31). Among different metal oxide
nanoparticles, ZnO being non-toxic is popular due to its
biocompatibility. Testing of ZnO Quantum dots as antimicrobials is mainly done on gram-negative antibioticsensitive strain of E. coli [31,32].
In this study, we have demonstrated the efficacy of ZnO
Quantum dots to inhibit growth of an oligotrophic, multiple antibiotic and serum resistant strain of K. pneumoniae
MB45 isolated from river Mahananda of Siliguri, West
Bengal, India. We have also characterized and expressed a
novel class 1 integron borne trimethoprim resistant dfrA
gene, designated dfrA30 from the said strain.

Methods
Sampling, Isolation and selection of the Test strain, and
preparation of Antibiogram

The strain was isolated from river water sample. Sampling, isolation and identification of oligotrophic bacteria
were done according to the methods described earlier
[23]. Replica plating method was employed for determining the antibiogram of the isolate designated as
MB45 [23]. Strain, MB45, resisting high level of trimethoprim (>1500 mg/L) was selected for this study.
The susceptibility of MB45 tested as described

Page 2 of 11

previously [23]. Criteria for susceptibility followed the
EUCAST guidelines http://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/. Susceptibility to the antibiotics absent in
EUCAST breakpoints table (v 1.1 2010-04-27), were
interpreted according to previously described criteria
[23]. Strain was maintained by bi-weekly transfer to
R2A agar slants (HiMedia, India) and stored at -20°C in
R2A broth amended with glycerol (20% v/v).
Phenotypic and Phylogenetic characterization of MB45

All phenotypic and biochemical test were performed following methodology described earlier [23] at 37°C.
Growths at different temperatures were tested in LB at
7, 10, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45 ± 1°C. DNA for amplification of 16S rRNA gene was extracted from cells (grown
in LB for 4 hr at 37°C) by boiling lysis method. A loop
full bacterial culture (24 h old) was inoculated in 100
mL flask containing 10 mL LB and incubated for 4 hr at
37°C without agitation. The cells (0.5 mL) were harvested by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 10 minute at 4°
C. The pellet was suspended in 200 μL sterile distilled
water and put in a microwave oven for 1.5 min at 800
watt (LG model No MS-194W). Lysate was cooled at
room temperature and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2
min to remove cell debris. 2 μL of the resulting supernatant was used as template DNA in 25 μL of PCR mix.
Amplification, cloning and sequencing were done
according to the previously described method [23].
Viability and Growth of MB45 in diluted (10-3) Luria-broth

Inoculum was prepared by transferring a single colony
of 24 h old culture of MB45 into 10 mL sterile LB (pH
7.0) in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The inoculated medium was incubated at 37°C for 4 h without agitation.
The culture was harvested by centrifuging at 8 000 rpm
for 5 min at 4°C and washed twice with sterile saline
(0.5% NaCl) water to remove traces of media. The
washed pellet was finally suspended in 3 mL sterile saline water. Aliquots of 1.0 mL of concentrated (1 × 108
cells/mL) cell suspension (s) were added to 25 mL of
diluted (10-3) LB in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The flask
was kept at 37°C (without shaking) throughout the period of investigation. Survivability of MB45 cells in 10-3
LB was assessed through dilution-plating of pure culture
aliquots at different time intervals on fresh LA plates.
Serum bactericidal assay

Serum bactericidal assay was basically performed by the
methods described by Sharma et al. [33].
Growth kinetics of MB45 in presence of varied
concentrations of ZnO QDs

ZnO QDs with surface adsorbed acetate ions (particle
size 3-5 nm) was synthesized and characterized by

Kumar et al. Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2011, 10:19
http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/10/1/19

methods described earlier [31]. Inoculum, for testing
ZnO QDs efficacy, was prepared as described above. Aliquots of 10 μL of concentrated (9 × 107 cells) cell suspension(s) were added to 3.0 mL volume(s) of LB in 10
mL glass test tube(s) amended with different concentrations of ZnO QDs. The tube containing all the ingredients except ZnO QDs was taken as positive control. LB
containing ZnO QDs but lacking cells were taken as
negative control. The tubes were kept at 37°C with continuous agitation at 200 rpm throughout the period of
investigation. Each test was performed in triplicate. The
optical density was measured in spectrophotometer
(Model-302, Electronic India) at 600 nm at different
time intervals. Growth rate constant (μ) and mean generation time (g) of MB45 in absence and presence of
different concentrations of ZnO QDs were calculated.
Phylogenetic affiliation of MB45

Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences
of MB45 and all the known species of genus Klebsiella
were conducted in the software package MEGA4 [34].
Multiple alignments of sequences were done with
CLUSTAL W [35]. Distances were calculated according
to the Jukes-Cantor. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using two tree-making algorithms: the NJ
(neighbor-joining) [36] and MP (maximum parsimony)
[37] methods to ensure consistency of the clusters
formed (data not shown). Tree topology was evaluated
by the bootstrap re-sampling method of Felsenstein [38]
based on 1000 replication.
Detection of class 1 integron, cloning, sequencing, and
expression of variable region

Whole cell DNA was extracted as described above. Variable region of the class 1 integron was amplified using
two sets of primer pair, 5” CS and 3” CS; and Int2F and
3” CS described previously [39,40]. Cloning and sequencing were done according to the method described previously [23]. For determination of resistance coded by
dfrA30 gene, the amplicon was cloned in pGEM-T easy
vector system-II (Promega, Madison, USA) and then
transformed into E. coli JM109. Clones containing insert
(CS-PCR product) in proper orientation were selected
on LA plates containing IPTG and X-gal (for BlueWhite screening) and trimethoprim (5 mg/L). One of
the clones (pAK45) appeared on trimethoprim amended
LA plate was purified, stored and used for testing the
maximum tolerance of trimethoprim. Plasmidless E. coli
JM109 was used as control.
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic position of the
dfrA30 gene

Each DfrA protein sequences were obtained from GenBank database (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

Page 3 of 11

The phylogenetic analysis at the amino acid level of the
DfrA30 (translated dfrA30 gene) was done by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on one representative for
each trimethoprim-resistance-mediating DfrA proteins.
The multiple alignments were made using the program
CLUSTAL W [35]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using NJ tree-making algorithm. The consistency of the clusters formed was also validated by
methods MP [37] and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic mean) [41] (data not shown).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the Dfr
protein sequences were accomplished in MEGA4 [34].
Sequence alignment and the effect of mutation in DfrA30

To identify the residues responsible for trimethoprimresistance in the DfrA30, multiple sequence alignment
of DfrA proteins [DfrA30, Ac. No. AM997279; DfrA5,
Ac. No. AJ419169; and wild type (WT, trimethoprimsensitive) Dfr, Ac. No. J01609 ] was carried out using
CLUSTAL W [35]. Due to the non availability of the trimethoprim-bound structure from E. coli in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) [42], sequence alignment was also performed between different trimethoprim-bound Dfr available in PDB. The protein from the Mycobacterium
avium (PDB ID: 2W3V) gave the highest score and was
used for the analysis of ligand binding. Pymol http://
www.pymol.org was used for molecular visualization.
Nucleotide accession number

The EMBL accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene
and dfrA30 gene are respectively FR677021 and
AM997279.

Results
Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of MB45

Cells of the strain MB45 were rod shaped, capsulated,
gram negative, aerobic (facultative anaerobic) and nonmotile. On Luria agar, colonies were circular, convex,
translucent, mucoid, sticky and off-white in colour with
diameters of 2.0-3.0 mm after 3 days at 37°C. Differential phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the
strain MB45 and nearest strains are given in Table 1.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (recommended by
EUCAST for Enterobacteriaceae) showed that the strain
MB45 was resistant to trimethoprim (S≤/R >, 2/4 mg/
L), cotrimoxazole (S≤/R > 2/4 mg/L), ampicillin (R > 8
mg/L), gentamycin (S≤/R > 2/4 mg/L), netilmicin (S≤/R
> 2/4 mg/L), tobramycin (S≤/R > 2/4 mg/L), chloramphenicol (S≤/R > 8/8 mg/L) and cefotaxime (S≤/R > 1/4
mg/L) and antibiotics, absent in EUCAST- kanamycin
(R≥ 5 mg/L) and streptomycin (R≥ 2.5 mg/L). Nearly
complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1503 bp) was
amplified, cloned and sequenced. The 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarities with phylogenetic neighbours were

The serum reactivity against the strain MB45 was determined by the rapid assay. MB45 could change the colour in NHS and HIS tubes at 5 h and therefore inferred
as serum-resistant. The control isolate, E. coli K12 could
not change the colour of NHS tube even at 8 h, but
turned HIS tube yellow at 5 h, was regarded as serumsensitive.

in the range 97.5-99.6%. The closest species to the strain
MB45 was K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis
ATCC 13884 T (99.6% sequence similarity). In the NJ
tree constructed with 16S rRNA gene sequence of K.
pneumoniae MB45 formed a tight clade with a bootstrap
support of 83% with the cluster comprising the four
Klebsiella strains named as K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, K. granulomatis, K. singaporensis and K. alba
(Figure 1). Similar output was obtained from MP clustering (data not shown).
Growth of the strain MB45 in diluted (10-3) Luria broth

The growth of MB45 cells were observed in diluted (103
) LB lacking any extra supplementation of growth factor (Figure 2). An increase of 4.6 times of the initial cell
number was noted in 2 days. The ability of MB45 to

Effect of ZnO QDs on the growth of MB45

The growth curves of MB45 in presence of different
concentrations of ZnO QDs were shown in Figure 3.
The bacterial growth rate (in comparison to the control,
without QDs) was found to get slower with increasing
concentrations of ZnO QDs. The growth rate constant
and mean generation time in LB without ZnO QDs (μ =
0.019 min-1, g = 36.5 min) was significantly affected on
addition of ZnO QDs (μ = 0.013 min-1; g = 53.3 min; at
400 mg/L). Growth was completely arrested at 500 mg/
L QDs.
Description of class 1 integron and phylogenetic position
of dfrA30

The Int2F and 3” CS primer pair yielded ~1.3 kb amplicon from the strain MB45, comprising a single gene cassette. The gene cassette contained a 471 bp long ORF
with 93% identity at the amino acid level to the DfrA5
(Ac. No. AJ419169) of E. coli. The deduced DfrA30

DfrA23 of S. typhimurium (Ac. No. AJ746361). The
DfrA30 was 33.1% identical to the chromosomal Dfr
protein (encoded by folA) of E. coli K12 (Ac No.
J01609). The 5” conserved sequence which terminates at
the attI1 core site G/TTA, which marks the point of
insertion and beginning of first gene cassette (EMBL
nucleotide sequence position, 686; Ac. No. AM997279)
was identical to those of class 1 integrons. The core site
for the site-specific insertion, GTTAACC, was located at
position 685-691. The ORF began with the initiation
codon GTG at positions 705 to 707 and terminated
with the stop codon TAA (within the inverse core site)
at positions 1176 to 1178. Downstream to the 3” end of
the dfrA30 gene, an 81 bp long structure, recognized as
an attC site (59 base element) began with the sequence
GGTTAAC (1L, inverse core site at position 1173-1179)
and terminated with the core sequence GTTAGAT
(EMBL nucleotide sequence position, 1253). Integrase
binding domains 2L (TATGCAAT; position, 1185-1192)
and 2R (ATTGATA; position, 1241-1247) within the 59
base element were also identified (Figure 4). Novel DfrA
(DfrA30) from MB45 branched deeply with DfrA5 of E
coli in the NJ phylogenetic tree (Figure 5).
The clone, pAK45, conferred resistance to trimethoprim (MIC, 1000 mg/L) and ampicillin (selection marker). The level of trimethoprim-resistance of the wild
strain MB45 was noted >1500 mg/L. The MIC of the
control strain (plasmidless JM109) was restricted to 5
mg/L for trimethoprim.
Since the identity of translated dfrA gene of MB45 was
93% with its nearest variant dfrA5 gene (and this particular sequence deposited in the GenBank was annotated
with the most similar features from the Feature database
(FDB) as dfrA30 [43]), this gene was predicted to be a
new dfrA gene and was named dfrA30 following guidelines for naming new trimethoprim resistance genes
[15,44].

Discussion
Recent studies have shown that the frequency of antibiotic resistance has been the second highest in the
genus Klebsiella especially in K. pneumoniae (next to E.
coli) within the family Enterobacteriaceae; and the rate
of occurrence has been noted to be higher in isolates
from developing countries than the developed countries
[12,47-49]. The incidence rates of trimethoprim resistance in Klebsiella spp. and E. coli in particular have
been alarming [12,50-52] in the context of an earlier
surveillance study (1987-88) on community isolates
revealing an increase in trimethoprim resistance from
15.2% to 24% in Klebsiella/Enterobacter spp [17]. The
most frequent mechanism of bacterial trimethoprimresistance is the production of an additional trimethoprim-resistant Dfr, regularly found on mobile genetic
elements (plasmids, transposons, gene cassettes) [14,17].
Other mechanisms of bacterial resistance to trimethoprim that have been described are impermeability
(found in isolates of Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella,
Pseudomonas, and Clostridium) and mutational changes
in the thymidylate synthase gene [14,17,53]. Besides
antibiotic resistance, incidence of serum resistance in
clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria is an additional
threat. There appears to be a strong correlation between
serum resistance and the ability of a variety of gramnegative bacteria to invade and survive in the human
blood stream [54]. Earlier authors have developed a simple and rapid assay for determination of serum bactericidal activity using more than hundred clinical isolates
of K. pneumoniae and have found that 50% were resistant to 20% normal human serum [33]. Nosocomial

septicemia due to extended spectrum b-lactamase producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli are a therapeutic challenge due to resistance [9]. Recently, it was shown that
treatment without resistance selection at the infection
site with fluoroquinolone treatment can be linked to
colonization of the digestive tract by K. pneumoniae
(targeted pulmonary bacteria), followed by the emergence of resistance [8]. Complete sequence of K. pneumoniae multidrug resistance plasmid pKP048 has
revealed the presence of several important resistance
genes, such as bla (KPC-2), bla (DHA-1), qnrB4, and
armA, which confer resistance to carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides,
respectively [10]. In the present study, the test strain,
MB45, isolated from river Mahananda at Siliguri, India,
is resistant to serum as well as to antibiotics trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, gentamycin, netilmicin,
tobramycin, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, kanamycin
and streptomycin and could survive in low nutrient condition (oligotrophic).
Characterization of integron-borne cassette arrays in
K. pneumonia strains from China revealed a predominance of dfr and aadA cassettes that confer resistance
to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides respectively [55].
However, the distribution of dfr genes in K. pneumoniae
was not known until recently a study on trimethoprim
resistance in 54 trimethoprim resistant K. pneumoniae
isolates have revealed the presence of dfrA1, dfrA5,
dfrA7, dfrA8, dfrA12, dfrA14, dfrA17 and class 1 and 2
integrons; dfrA1 and dfrA17 being most prevalent and
rarest respectively [48]. More than 25 different TMPresistance-mediating dfr genes isolated from different

(referred as dfrA and dfrB), have been observed till date
[56,57]. A novel trimethoprim resistance gene is claimed
when the translated Dfr encoded by the gene has <95%
identity at the amino acid level compared with known
Dfr proteins [15]. Since the degrees of identity between
the DfrA30 and the protein sequences of other Dfr(s)
ranged between 15.1 and 93%, thus placing DfrA5 and
DfrA30 in an indisputable monophyletic group in the
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 5).
The strain MB45 showed high level of resistance to
TMP (>1500 mg/L). Generally, a single mutation in the

Page 7 of 11

active site is enough for TMP-resistance in Dfr, though
multiple mutations are common in clinically isolated
species. The mutations in the active site residues reduce
the binding affinity of the enzyme for the drug. Matthews and co-workers have identified the residues that
constitute the TMP-binding site in E. coli Dfr (Figure 6)
[45]. Additionally, the mutations in the active site that
lead to TMP resistance in E. coli have been enunciated
[46]. The mutations in DfrA30 are of the same type as
those in DfrA5. In particular, two changes, glutamine
for leucine at residue 28 and isoleucine to serine at 94,
would change the hydrophobic/polar nature at the two

opposite sides of the TMP site (Figure 7), thus possibly
weakening the binding. Other mutations (V10, W30 and
I94) beyond the active site have also been identified in
clinically isolated TMP-resistant genes [46]. Some of
these are also found in DfrA30 (mutations V10K and
W31L) (Figure 6).
The percent occurrence of integron-positive isolates
from clinical samples was much higher compared to
environmental samples including fish farms [58-62], irrigation water sources [63] and other aquatic environments [23,26,64-66]. Except one recent study [23], in all

other studies the incidence of class 1 integrons was
observed for copiotrophic isolates that grow on rich
nutrient medium. The test strain, MB45, is a multipleantibiotic resistant oligotrophic bacteria recovered on
0.001X LA from river Mahananda. The facultatively oligotrophic strain used in this study was characterized as
K. pneumoniae MB45 (ascertained from phenotype as
well as from 16S rRNA phylogeny) (Figure 1). Viability
assay and growth assessment of K. pneumoniae MB45
cell concentrate in 0.001X Luria broth for more than 72
h by taking viable cell count of the cell suspension on
1X LA at different times (Figure 2) demonstrated its
ability to adapt both oligotrophic (ability to survive and
grow in extremely poor nutrient conditions) as well as
copiotrophic (ability to form colonies in a rich medium)
conditions of growth. Such facultative nature of oligotrophy, as shown by the K. pneumoniae MB45, may
contribute to the reported adaptation of remaining
viable in hospital environment [28] for several days and
cause nosocomial infection. Microbial contamination of
working surfaces, clinical materials, and surgical devices
poses a major threat in hospitals and intensive care
units. With increasing threat because of greater incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens there is
increased demand for novel disinfectants and disinfection methods. Due to exceptional physical and chemical
properties of nanostructured materials there have been
several attempts to improve the bactericidal activity of
metal nanoparticles [31,67,68]. Most of these studies
were confined to testing the nanoparticles on therapeutically sensitive test strains of E. coli (gram negative
representative), Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus

Kumar et al. Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2011, 10:19

aureus (gram positive representatives). In an earlier
study investigating the role of surface bound anionic
species on zinc oxide quantum dots for the antibacterial
activity against E. coli, it was shown that ZnO QDs having acetate ions had superior bactericidal activity than
those described earlier [31]. In this study, the antibacterial potency of ZnO QDs was tested against the multiple
antibiotic and serum resistant K. pneumoniae MB45.
The bacterial growth rate was found to be inhibited
with the increase in concentration of ZnO QDs under
standard cultural conditions (Figure 3). Complete inhibition of growth of MB45 is observed at concentration of
500 mg/L ZnO QDs in the medium. Hence, in future
ZnO QDs could be a good nanobiotic candidate for the
control of multi-drug resistant pathogens as well as in
disinfecting hospital environments, external wounds,
medical and surgical devices; and also in suitable format
may find application in drinking water treatment plants.

Conclusion
The present work showed a new dihydrofolate reductase
gene, dfrA30 responsible for high level of trimethoprimresistance (>1500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L in K. pneumoniae MB45 and E. coli JM109 expressing dfrA30 gene
cassette in pAK45 respectively). The strain MB45, isolated from river Mahananda was also resistant to nine
more antibiotics as well as human serum; and was able
to grow in very low nutrient condition for more than
two days. Here we have suggested one of the possible
ways to eradicate these pathogens by use of Zinc quantum dots (a nano-biotic) however other improved nanobiotics (experiments with ZnO-QDs having other capping agents are in progress) can also be used.
