Abstract
Background: Lateral gene transfer is the major mechanism for acquisition of new virulence genes
in pathogens. Recent whole genome analyses have suggested massive gene transfer between widely
divergent organisms.
Presentation of the hypothesis: Archeal-like genes acting as virulence genes are present in
several pathogens and genomes contain a number of archaeal-like genes of unknown function.
Archaea, by virtue of their very different evolutionary history and different environment, provide
a pool of potential virulence genes to bacterial pathogens.
Testing the hypothesis: We can test this hypothesis by 1)identifying genes likely to have been
transferred (directly or indirectly) to E. coli O157:H7 from archaea; 2)investigating the distribution
of similar genes in pathogens and non-pathogens and 3)performing rigorous phylogenetic analyses
on putative transfers.
Implications of the hypothesis: Although this hypothesis focuses on archaea and E. coli, it will
serve as a model having broad applicability to a number of pathogenic systems. Since no archaea
are known vertebrate pathogens, archaeal-like transferred genes that are associated with virulence
in bacteria represent a clear model for the emergence of virulence genes.

Background
The fact and process of lateral gene transfer (LGT) has
been integral to the study of infectious disease since Griffith [1]. Most investigations have, however, centered on
transfer of known virulence genes and genes involved in
establishing infections (antibiotic resistance, toxins, capsule, etc.) between close relatives who are both pathogens.
The explosion of gene sequence information and complete genomes in the last 5 years has reinforced and
extended our view of virulence evolution. To quote a
review [2]: "lateral transfers have effectively changed the
ecological and pathogenic character of bacterial species."
Analysis of gene sequence and complete genome informa-

tion[3–11] have led to the realization that LGT is not a
rare exception to classical Darwinian evolution, but may
be the predominant mode of evolutionary change in
prokaryotes[2,12–15].
Given the common perception of archaea as extremophiles, one might expect the opportunity for transfer
between archaeal organisms and bacterial pathogens to be
a rare event. However, many archaea are present in more
"normal" environments. Methanogenic archaea are very
common in vertebrate and invertebrate digestive systems.
In fact, in diary cattle, methanogenic archaea make up a
substantial fraction of the micro biota [16] and E coli

O157 is also very common, being cultured from 75% of
herds [17]. Furthermore, there are similarities among bacterial and archaeal phages, plasmids, and other vectors for
mediating transfer (IS elements; transposable elements)[18]. Transfer of DNA in natural environments has
been extensively described for a number of different
organisms: Bushman (Table 5.5,[19]) lists more than 30
studies. Many different functions – proteases, metabolic
genes, oxygen protection genes, secretion systems, transporter genes, iron acquisition systems – can, under the
right circumstances, contribute to virulence in an emerging pathogen.
E. coli O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
uremic syndrome. It is widely recognized as a worldwide
public health danger. However, it has only been associated with human disease since 1982. There is a complete
genome sequence available for E. coli K-12[20], as well as
much genetic information on many other well-studied
non-pathogenic E. coli. There are two published complete
genomes for E. coli O157:H7 enteropathogenic strains
[8,21], as well as seven E. coli genomes in progress [22]
(GOLD database [23]). Virulence also depends on many
different genes in enterohemorrhagic E. coli [8]. For the
purposes of testing the contribution of archaea to virulence genes,E. coli O157:H7 serves as an ideal model.
Testing the hypothesis
We can test this hypothesis by:

1) Identifying genes likely to have been transferred
(directly or indirectly) to E. coli O157:H7 from archaea.
2) Investigating the distribution of similar genes in pathogens and non-pathogens and performing rigorous phylogenetic analyses on putative transfers.
Have any transfers been described between archaea and
E. coli O157?
I have demonstrated that a gene coding for a bifunctional
catalase-peroxidase is likely a transfer from archaea to a
variety of pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli
O157:H7[9]. Although not yet directly implicated in
O157:H7 as a virulence factor, this enzyme has been
implicated as a virulence factor in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis [24,26], and in Legionella pneumophila [25].
Furthermore, this E. coli O157:H7 catalase-peroxidase has
been associated with enterohaemorrhagic hemolysin in a
variety of shiga-like toxin-producing (verotoxin-producing) E. coli [30,31]. This correlation of the presence of the
catalase-peroxidase in many virulent but not in avirulent
strains suggests a direct role in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic E. coli.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/13

How can we identify other genes likely to have been
transferred (directly or indirectly) to E. coli O157:H7 from
archaea?
We can use the three complete E. coli genomes available[8,20,21] to identify a subset of genes present in one
(or both) of the O157 strains but not in K-12. This subset
of genes – although most have not been directly identified
as virulence genes – are more likely to be virulence-associated. This subset will be the focus of our search for genes
likely to have laterally transferred from archaea. Perna et
al [8] identified 1,387 genes in the EDL933 O157 strain
they sequenced that are O157-specific; This number does
not include the O157-specific plasmids that were previously sequenced[32] from which some of the preliminary
work[9] described below was derived.

As a preliminary step to testing this hypothesis I have
searched the E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933[8] genome
for open reading frames (ORFs) meeting the following
criteria:
1) present in O157 strain EDL933 but not in E. coli K-12
2) highly similar (having a BLASTP similarity bit score >
95) to ORFs found in at least two archaeal genomes
3) having few or no highly similar proteins (BLASTP score
< 85) in other bacterial genomes
This search was facilitated by the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COG) database at NCBI [33,34]. This preliminary, non-systematic search produced 6 ORFS worth considering as LGTs from archaea to pathogenic bacteria.
Table 1 shows these ORFs with their location and, if any
information was available, a possible function.
Although the putative functions in Table 1 are not generally associated with virulence, many genes, under the right
circumstances, can facilitate infection or contribute to
pathogenicity. There are examples in the literature where
both ABC transporters (in Streptococcus gordonii:[35]) and
helicase genes (in Legionella pneumophila :[36]) have been
directly implicated in virulence.
Further testing of this hypothesis will require rigorous
phylogenetic analyses of each suspected transfer. The procedure of comparing similarity scores to identify potential
lateral transfers (used above) although commonly
employed[6,7,37] it is fraught with potential errors
[15,38–42,34,35] and must serve only as an initial screen.
Ragan[15] recently wrote:
This study demonstrates the need for a systematic, comprehensive approach to the study of LGT based on first principles, i.e.
rigorous inference and statistically based comparison of

Z0509 do not have archaeal genes as the most similar BLAST hit, they are included because in general they are absent from almost all
bacterial genomes.

molecular phylogenetic trees. As more genomic sequences
appear, a tree-based approach will become both more challenging and more rewarding.
Implications of the hypothesis
Although this hypothesis focuses on archaea and E. coli,
the model of distant gene transfer as a major contributor
of "new" virulence genes to pathogens or potential pathogens has broad applicability to a large number of pathogenic systems. Archaea represent both the most distant
source and, in many ways, the most unlikely source for
virulence genes. If E. coli can acquire virulence genes from
archaea, then potentially any organism is a reservoir of
virulence genes for pathogens. [43]

The implications, should this hypothesis be proven, are
myriad. Our understanding of potential sources of virulence genes will be expanded to include virtually all life on
earth – at first glance a frightening prospect. At the same
time, however, it would allow us to move from a descriptive, reactionary view of infectious disease towards a predictive science of infectious disease. It would be dramatic
evidence of what some microbiologists suspect: that lateral gene transfer is the predominant engine of variation
in prokaryotes and the catalyst for the emergence of new
bacterial pathogens.
