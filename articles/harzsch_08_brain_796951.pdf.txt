Abstract
Background: During the evolutionary radiation of Crustacea, several lineages in this taxon
convergently succeeded in meeting the physiological challenges connected to establishing a fully
terrestrial life style. These physiological adaptations include the need for sensory organs of
terrestrial species to function in air rather than in water. Previous behavioral and neuroethological
studies have provided solid evidence that the land hermit crabs (Coenobitidae, Anomura) are a
group of crustaceans that have evolved a good sense of aerial olfaction during the conquest of land.
We wanted to study the central olfactory processing areas in the brains of these organisms and to
that end analyzed the brain of Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst, 1791; Anomura, Coenobitidae), a fully
terrestrial tropical hermit crab, by immunohistochemistry against synaptic proteins, serotonin,
FMRFamide-related peptides, and glutamine synthetase.
Results: The primary olfactory centers in this species dominate the brain and are composed of
many elongate olfactory glomeruli. The secondary olfactory centers that receive an input from
olfactory projection neurons are almost equally large as the olfactory lobes and are organized into
parallel neuropil lamellae. The architecture of the optic neuropils and those areas associated with
antenna two suggest that C. clypeatus has visual and mechanosensory skills that are comparable to
those of marine Crustacea.
Conclusion: In parallel to previous behavioral findings of a good sense of aerial olfaction in C.
clypeatus, our results indicate that in fact their central olfactory pathway is most prominent,
indicating that olfaction is a major sensory modality that these brains process. Interestingly, the
secondary olfactory neuropils of insects, the mushroom bodies, also display a layered structure
(vertical and medial lobes), superficially similar to the lamellae in the secondary olfactory centers
of C. clypeatus. More detailed analyses with additional markers will be necessary to explore the
question if these similarities have evolved convergently with the establishment of superb aerial
olfactory abilities or if this design goes back to a shared principle in the common ancestor of
Crustacea and Hexapoda.

Background
Within Crustacea, at least five major lineages have succeeded in the transition from an aquatic to a fully terrestrial life style (reviews [1-4]). These include
representatives of the Isopoda [5,6], of the Amphipoda [79], of the Astacida [10], of the Anomura [3,11], and of the
Brachyura [3]. Within the Anomura, the Coenobitidae are
a member of the Paguroidea (Fig. 1), a taxon the members
of which have evolved the potential to protect the pleon
with gastropod shells. The Coenobitidae comprise two
genera that display a fully terrestrial life style [12]. They
include 15 species of shell-carrying land hermit crabs (the
genus Coenobita) and the robber or coconut crab Birgus
latro (genus Birgus), the largest living land arthropod
[11,13,14]. The early juvenile stages of this impressive
creature, which as an adult can attain weights in excess of
5 kg, carry a shell, but with subsequent growth suitable
shells are not available anymore so that the thorax and
pleon harden for protection, as in other Crustacea
[13,15]. Several other taxa within the Anomura, such as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

members of the Diogenidae and Porcellanidae (Fig. 1),
also show terrestrial tendencies and occupy intertidal and
mangrove habitats. However, only the Coenobitidae have
developed terrestrial adaptations [16-18] that, apart from
larval stages, allow them to permanently inhabit the
supralitoral areas and small islands of tropical and subtropical maritime regions and to penetrate long distances
inland [11,19].
The successful transition from marine to terrestrial life
requires a number of physiological adaptations which are
important for survival out of water. These are related e. g.
to gas exchange, salt and water balance, nitrogenous
excretion, thermoregulation, molting, and reproduction
[1,2,4,11,16-18]. Concerning the nervous system, the sensory organs of terrestrial species must be able to function
in the air rather than in the water. There is evidence that
Coenobitidae have evolved good aerial visual abilities
[11]. In olfaction, a transition from sea to land means that
the stimulus changes from hydrophilic molecules in aque-

debate. We decided to follow the hypothesis proposed by McLaughlin and co-workers [12]. The terrestrial Coenobitidae are a
subtaxon of the Paguroidea, a group the members of which have evolved the potential to use molluscan shells as protection for
their pleon. Images from [136].

ous solution to mainly hydrophobic in the gaseous phase
(discussed in [20]). Behavioral studies have provided evidence that these animals are very effective in detecting
food from a distance and in responding to airborne odors,
in short, that they have evolved a sense of distance olfaction that is behaviorally highly relevant for the animals
[20-22]. The olfactory receptor neurons of crustaceans are
associated with specialized structures on the first pair of
antennae, the aesthetascs (reviews [23-25]). The aesthetascs of Coenobitidae are short and blunt and more
similar to those of insects than to those of marine hermit
crabs [20,26,27]. In robber crabs, they are confined to the
ventral side of the primary flagella and arranged in
ordered rows along a central groove. Contrary to marine
crustaceans, they have an asymmetric profile with the protected side lined with a thick cuticle. The exposed side is
covered with a thinner cuticle, a feature that most likely is
necessary to enable the passage of odors [20]. Another
clear distinction to marine crustaceans is that in the robber crab, the basal bodies and cilia segments are housed
well inside the flagellum and are surrounded by a lymph
space. Stensmyr et al. [20] interpreted these morphological features of the aesthetascs as adaptations to terrestrial
conditions, more specifically, as mechanisms to minimize
water evaporation while maintaining the ability to detect
volatile odors from the gaseous phase. Terrestrial hermit
crabs show flicking movements of their first antennae to
maximize odor sampling, a strategy that is also applied by
aquatic crustaceans [28,29]. In addition, Coenobitidae
use their first antennae to touch and sample the ground
[11], which suggests the presence of taste receptors.
The crustacean taxon that was undoubtedly most successful in the colonization of land is the Oniscoidea ("wood
lice"), a subgroup of the Isopoda [2,6]. Within the Oniscoidea, the first pair of antennae is strongly reduced in size
and instead the second pair of antennae seems to function
as major sensory organs [6,30]. The tip of the second
antennae bears a characteristic apical sensory cone that
perceives mechanical and gustatory stimuli [30-33]. So far
there is not any evidence that isopods use their second
antennae for distance olfaction but for the desert isopod
Hemilepistus reaumuri it was shown that contact chemosensors in their apical organs can detect polar, mainly
non-volatile cuticle compounds of conspecifics and that
this ability serves as the basis for a highly developed system of kin recognition (review [34]). The animals probe
each other with the apical organs that react to carbonic
acid, amines, sugar, fatty acids, amino acids and other
substances [32,35]. It has previously been noted that,
coinciding with the minute size of their first pair of antennae, in Oniscoidea the primary olfactory centres in the
deutocerebrum, the olfactory lobes, are reduced in size
[36-38]. We carried out a set of immunohistochemical
studies on the brain architecture of several marine and ter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

restrial Isopoda (Harzsch and Hansson, unpublished
data). Our study provided supportive evidence that the
Oniscoidea have completely abandoned their olfactory
lobes in response to the colonization of land. This suggests that, contrary to the Coenobitidae, the deutocerebral
olfactory pathway does not play a significant role for aerial olfaction in the terrestrial isopods. It would appear that
it is not trivial for any crustacean to establish an aerial
sense of olfaction during the transition from sea to land.
Along these lines of arguments, the present study sets out
to explore the architecture of the central olfactory processing areas in representatives of the Coenobitidae, for which
the sense of smell has been proven to play an important
role.
The architecture of the brain in land hermit crabs is poorly
understood as is the nervous system architecture of
Anomura in general [39]. So far, concerted studies on the
brain morphology in this group have not been conducted,
yet more or less incidental reports are available for representatives of the aquatic anomuran genera Pagurus
(Paguroidea; see Fig. 1), and Petrolisthes (Porcellanidae) as
well as Munida quadrispina (Galatheidae), and the fully
terrestrial Coenobitidae [40-43]. The Thalassinida and
Brachyura are the closest relatives to the Anomura (Fig. 1;
[44]). The brains of Calocaris and the semi aquatic Callianassa, both members of the Thalassinida, and of several
representatives of the brachyuran crabs have been analyzed in greater depths than those of the Anomura
[40,43,45-47], including developmental studies on the
larval brachyuran brain [48-51]. Concerning the terrestrial Anomura, a study by Sandeman and co-workers [40]
on the robber crab Birgus latro had provided preliminary
evidence for the presence of extremely large olfactory
lobes in this species. Beltz and coworkers [42] conducted
a numerical analysis on the olfactory glomeruli in 17 species of reptantian crustaceans including Coenobita clypeatus. With 800 glomeruli this species ranked second to the
Achelata (clawless lobsters) as far as glomerular numbers
were concerned. Furthermore, this terrestrial hermit crab
ranked third concerning olfactory lobe volume and
glomerular volume [42]. Taken together, these previous
neuroanatomical studies in concert with the available
behavioral reports indicate the presence of sophisticated
olfactory systems in members of the Coenobitidae so that
we decided to explore brain morphology in this group
more closely. Specifically, we wanted to know if, other
than aspects related glomerular numbers, their brains
show any modifications such as deletions or addition of
neuropil structures that compared to other aquatic Crustacea may be interpreted as adaptations to the terrestrial
life style. Are the general brain layout of the Coenobitidae
and the relative proportion of brain neuropils similar to
that of other malacostracan Crustacea? Or have additional

structures and different neuropil architectures evolved? To
answer these questions, we analyzed the brain of Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst, 1791; Anomura, Coenobitidae), a
fully terrestrial tropical species that penetrates long distances inland [11] by immunohistochemistry against synaptic proteins, serotonin, FMRFamide-related peptides,
and glutamine synthetase. These markers were chosen to
provide both, a general overview over the brain layout and
a more detailed insight into the branching patterns of certain classes of neurons. Our results indicate that in fact
their central olfactory pathway is most prominent, indicating that olfaction is a major sensory modality that these
brains process.

Results
The data reported here stem from three sets of triple labeling experiments i.e. combinations of markers (see material and methods):
1: synapsin + actin + nuclei;
2: RFamide + synapsin + nuclei;
3: glutamine synthetase + serotonin + nuclei.
In the figures, we use color-coded abbreviations to identify the markers:
SYN: synapsin immunoreactivity
RF: RFamide-like immunoreactivity
GS: glutamine synthetase-like immunoreactivity
5HT: serotonin-immunolocalization
ACT: phalloidin histochemistry to label actin
NUC: nuclear counter stain with bisbenzimide
The experiments provided a consistent picture of the gross
brain anatomy so that we were able to compile a schematic drawing of the C. clypeatus brain (Fig. 2). We will
first give an overview about the labeling pattern with these
three marker sets (Figs. 3, 4, 5) and then will describe specific brain structures in more detail, from the protocerebrum across the deuto- and tritocerebrum to end with the
eyestalk neuropils. We determined the sex of the specimens that were studied according to their pleopod morphology, but did not encounter any sex-specific
differences of their brains. Most of the brain structures
(except for example the central body) are bilaterally
paired. For simplicity we will describe only one brain
hemisphere (mostly the right side) in the understanding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

that mirror symmetrical structures are present in the contralateral hemisphere.
Overview over the C. clypeatus brain
Fig. 3 shows a ventral to dorsal section series featuring
anti-synapsin immunohistochemistry (green) with actin
(red) and nuclear (blue) counter stains. In the two most
ventral slices (Fig. 3A, B; the left hemisphere is shown),
tangential sections of the olfactory neuropil or olfactory
lobe (ON) can be seen. In Crustacea the ON receives afferent chemosensory input from olfactory receptor neurons
on the paired first antennae. The olfactory neuropil is
composed of numerous column-like structures with
strong synapsin-immunoreactivity (SYNir), the "olfactory" glomeruli. Despite their columnar shape we will
refer to these neuropil elements as glomeruli since this
term is well introduced in the literature. In cross sections
(Fig. 3A), these structures appear as round profiles
whereas in the following sections it becomes apparent
that the glomeruli are arranged parallel to each other
around the periphery of the lobe. The centre of the lobe is
devoid of SYNir, yet actin labeling shows that this core is
filled with bundles of fibrous material (Fig. 3C, D). Histochemical labeling of cell nuclei reveals a densely packed
cluster with hundreds if not thousands of neuronal
somata to be associated with the olfactory lobe. This cluster most probably corresponds to cluster (10), which is
known to house olfactory projection neurons in other
malacostracan Crustacea [52]. In C. clypeatus, cluster (10)
is located medially and posteriorly to the ON in the most
ventral aspect but also extends more dorsally, where it
wraps around the posterior part of the ON (Fig. 3C). In
subsequent sections, a side lobe of the olfactory neuropil
(xON) becomes visible that in the more ventral sections
seems to be separate from the main ON (Fig. 3B). Proceeding further dorsally, however, it becomes apparent
that this side lobe is connected to the main ON (Fig.
3C–F). Medial to the ON, SYNir reveals a horizontal column of loose, unstructured neuropil that extends in an
anterior-posterior direction, the ventral neuropil column
(VC; Fig. 3D). Further dorsally (Fig. 3E–H), two compact,
medially situated neuropils become visible displaying
strong SYNir: the lateral antenna 1 neuropil (LAN), and
the antenna 2 neuropil (AnN). At this level, in the protocerebrum (PC), unstructured immunolabelled neuropil
is visible. Between the protocerebrum and the anterior
part of the ON, a second compact cell cluster with densely
packed nuclei is visible. This is most likely cell cluster (9)
that houses local olfactory interneurons [52]. This cell
cluster extends through at least five 80 μm sections and
once again houses hundreds or thousands of neurons
(Fig. 3F–J). In other sections, nuclear labeling shows that
the brain is surrounded by a thick layer of cell nuclei, but
we could not differentiate which of these belong to the
perineurium and which may be neurons. The accessory

lobe (AcN) is an assemblage of small SYNir glomeruli and
is located medially to the olfactory lobe close to the point
where the olfactory globular tract (OGT) emerges from
the latter (Fig. 3H). The ON clearly is the dominating
structure of the C. clypeatus brain and dorso-ventrally
stretches through the entire section series. In the most dorsal section, once again cross sections of the radially
arranged olfactory glomeruli are visible (Fig. 3J).
Fig. 4 shows ventral to dorsal section series of another
specimen that was processed for anti-synapsin immunohistochemistry (red), RFamide-like immunohistochemistry (green) and a nuclear counter stain (blue). This series
reveals a few additional structures compared to Fig. 3 but
the general arrangement and size of the main neuropils is
similar in this and several other specimens that we examined. The orange color of the olfactory lobes indicates that
in the olfactory glomeruli, SYNir and RFamide-like immunoreactivity (RFir) are mostly co-localized (Fig. 4A, B). In
the middle of the brain, however, where the glomeruli are
sectioned longitudinally, it becomes clear that the cap
region of the glomeruli shows only SYNir (red) but not
RFir (green). In the ventral neuropil column, RFir fibers
are embedded and RFir somata are located between this
column and the ONs (Fig. 4B, C). The protocerebrum is
filled with a loose network of RFir fibers. In this section
series, the subdivision of the protocerebral neuropil in an
anterior and a posterior component, that is so typical of
decapod crustaceans [52], is visible. These are the anterior
(AMPN) and posterior medial protocerebral neuropils
(PMPN; Fig. 4D–F). The central body (CB) is a transverse,
unpaired protocerebral neuropil that extends across the
midline, is embedded between the two aforementioned
protocerebral compartments, and displays strong RFir
(Fig. 4E). A thick, paired fiber bundle, the olfactory globular tract, leaves the olfactory lobes in a medial direction
and surprisingly seems to display both RFir and SYNir
(Fig. 4F). The left and right portions of this tract touch
each other at the midline, slightly above the central body,
where they form a characteristic chiasm. The two bundles
then separate again to veer antero-laterally and exit the
medial brain by joining the protocerebral tract to target
the lateral protocerebrum in the eyestalks (see below).
Cell cluster (6) is situated anteriorly between the two arms
of the protocerebral tract. The accessory lobe, being situated close to the origin of the olfactory globular tract displays both RFir and SYNir. Medially, a block of diffuse
neuropil, the median antenna 1 neuropil (MAN) is
embedded between the two arms of the olfactory globular
tract (Fig. 4F). In the most dorsal section (Fig. 4G) it
becomes apparent that many cell somata in cluster (9)
display strong RFir.
Fig. 5 shows two horizontal sections of another specimen

istry (green), glutamine synthetase-like immunohistochemistry (red) and a nuclear counter stain (blue). Cell
somata with strong glutamine synthetase-like immunoreactivity (GSir) surround all brain neuropils with the
exception of the ONs. Within the ON, there is a very faint
and diffuse labeling. We were unable to decide if it represents a specific signal or just unspecific background labeling. A tissue layer displaying weak GSir, presumably the
perineurium [53], surrounds the entire brain (Fig. 5B).
Within the cell clusters known to comprise neuronal cell
bodies such as cluster (9), typically very few or no GSir
somata were present (Fig. 5B1, 6A). Those neuropils surrounded by GSir cells also display strong immunolabelling in the neuropil core (Fig. 5A, B1, 6A). At higher
magnification, the GSir cells at the periphery of the
neuropil can be seen to extend processes into the neuropil
(Fig. 5B1 inset). These cells are typically bi- or tripolar
(Fig. 6B, C). Comparing the labeling pattern observed
here to other studies on crustacean glia cells [54-56] suggests that GSir in C. clypeatus is strongly localized in a certain type of glia cells, the ensheathing glia [53] but not in
neurons. Serotonin-immunoreactivity (5HTir) is widespread throughout the C. clypeatus brain. The protocerebrum, the lateral antenna 1 neuropil, as well as the
antenna 2 neuropil display strong 5HTir (Fig. 5B2, 6A). A
population of serotonergic olfactory interneurons with
somata within cell cluster (9) gives rise to a strong innervation of the ON.
Protocerebrum
The protocerebrum can be subdivided into an anterior
and a posterior component, the anterior (AMPN) and
posterior medial protocerebral neuropils (PMPN; Fig.
6D1, 7A1, 7B1). This subdivision is most obvious in the
middle of the section series (Fig. 4D–F), at the level of the
olfactory globular tract chiasm (see below), whereas more
ventrally (Fig. 4C) and more dorsally (Fig. 4G, 5B1, B2,
6A) such a distinction is not possible. In the protocerebral
tract that links the anterior median protocerebral neuropil
to the lateral protocerebrum, RFir fibers are present (Fig.
6D1). Anteriorly, the protocerebral neuropil is adjoined
by the cell cluster (6) in which neuronal somata with both
RFir (arrowheads in Fig. 6D1, E, 7A1) and 5HTir (arrowheads in Fig. 6F) are located. At the interface between the
anterior (AMPN) and posterior medial protocerebral
neuropils, a transverse, unpaired neuropil extends across
the midline, the central body (CB; Fig. 6D1, D2). The central body is innervated by a dense plexus of fine RFir (Fig.
6D2) and 5HTir fibers (data not shown). Several thick
RFir commissural fiber bundles accompany the central
body posteriorly (Fig. 6D1, D2) and dorsally (Fig. 7A1).
Behind these commissural fibers, the cerebral artery
pierces the brain in a dorso-ventral direction (arrowheads
in Fig. 4C–F, asterisk in Fig. 6D1, D2). The protocerebral
bridge is located anteriorly and slightly dorsal to the cen-

olfactory glomeruli. In specimens processed for 5HTir, a
large anterior (aB) and posterior bundle (pB) of cluster
(9) neurites can be distinguished, where fibers spread out
towards the bases of glomeruli (arrows in Fig. 9C).

The olfactory globular tract
The olfactory globular tract links the olfactory and accessory neuropils to the lateral protocerebrum. In Decapoda,
this tract is formed by the axons of the projection neurons
with their somata in cell cluster (10) and this tract represents the major output pathway of the olfactory system
(reviews [52,57,58]). In the brain of C. clypeatus, actin
labeling revealed the course of this tract (Fig. 7B1, C,
13A). After emerging from the olfactory lobes it courses
antero-medially to meet its contralateral counterpart in a
chiasm slightly dorsal to the central body (the chiasm is
identified by the X in Fig. 6E, 7A–C). Its two arms then
separate again to proceed antero-laterally to leave the
brain via the protocerebral tract and to target the lateral
protocerebrum (see below). Surprisingly, synapsin labeling provided evidence for synaptic material to be associated with two regions of the olfactory globular tract,
namely a region within the chiasm (Fig. 6E), and a long
section between the olfactory lobe and the chiasm (Fig.
3H, 7A2, B2, C; see also Fig. 13A). This section of the
olfactory globular tract also displays strong RFir (Fig.
7A1). At a higher magnification it becomes clear that the
regions of SYNir and RFir in this stretch of the olfactory
globular tract almost completely overlap (Fig. 8) suggesting the presence of synapses with RFamide-like neuropeptides to be associated with the tract. This synaptic region
may correspond to the olfactory globular tract neuropil as
found in other Decapoda [52]. The olfactory globular tract
is laterally accompanied by a small, spherical neuropil,
the accessory olfactory globular tract neuropil (OGTNa)
that displays SYNir but not RFir (Fig. 8, 13A).

As noted above, the ON is composed of numerous
glomeruli that display strong SYNir and are arranged parallel to each other around the periphery of the lobe (Fig.
10, 11). Examining single optical sections from a z stack
gives an idea of the dense packing of these glomeruli (Fig.
10A1, A2). They are elongate, cylindrical structures and
their distal part is slightly larger than the proximal part.
The glomeruli have a length of around 150 μm. A 3D
reconstruction (Fig. 10B) confirmed that, as seen in tangential sections (Fig. 3A, 11A), the cross-sectional profile
of these structures is more or less round. The diameter of
the glomeruli in cross sections is around 20 μm. The
periphery of the ONs is entirely packed with glomeruli
with the exception of two spared spaces, the foramina,
where fiber bundles enter or exit the lobes. These are the
median foramen (mF; Fig. 3E, F, 4D, 8, 9A, C, 11B),
through which the neurites from cluster (9) interneurons
pass into the lobe and through which the olfactory globular tracts exits is, and the posterior foramen (pF), through
which the axons of cluster (10) neurons enter the lobe
(Fig. 3C, D, 4C; see also Fig. 1B). Double labeling for
SYNir and RFir revealed a regionalization of the glomeruli. Whereas SYNir is present throughout the entire
glomeruli, the cap region is devoid of RFir (terminology
according to [59]). However, RFir is present in the base
region and is particularly strong in the subcap region (Fig.
11B, C1, C2, D, E).

Deutocerebrum: the olfactory neuropils
Two large clusters of olfactory interneurons are associated
with the olfactory neuropils, cell cluster (10) with projection neuron somata, and cluster (9) that houses local
olfactory interneurons (Fig. 3, 4). None of the projection
neurons in cluster (10) displays 5HTir or RFir. Yet, in cluster (9) large populations of local interneurons are present
that display strong 5HTir (Fig. 5B2, 9A, C) or RFir (Fig.
6D1, D2, 7A1, A2, 8) and the neurites of which extend
into the core of the ON. We did not analyze if some cluster
(9) neurons co-localize serotonin and RFamide. Between
the ON and the lateral antenna 1 neuropil, the soma of at
least one large serotonergic neuron is located (arrowheads
in Fig. 6A, 9B, C) but the axonal projection could not be
traced. Bundles of fine neurites of the cluster (9) interneurons enter the ONs from the medial side in a thick bundle
that then branches out into finer bundles (Fig. 8, 9, 11B,
C1, C2), in which fibers approach the proximal part of the

Apart from the glomeruli, a second type of neuropil in the
ONs, the non-columnar olfactory neuropil (ncON), displays strong SYNir, 5HTir and RFir. Six patches of this diffusely structured neuropil can be reproducibly identified
in different specimens and will be denoted with capital
letters A-F in the following (see summary diagram Fig.
1B). Patch A of the ncON (Fig. 3B, 4B, 11A) is seen in ventrally located tangential sections of the ON in a medioposterior position to the main ON. It stretches further
dorsally towards the point where the extra olfactory lobe
joins the main lobe (Fig. 4B). Patch B is located anteriorly
to the median foramen (Fig. 3G, 8, 9A, C). In sections dorsal to the median foramen, it merges with patch F that is
located posterior to this foramen. The merged patches B
and F thus line the dorsal part of the median foramen (Fig.
3H, 5B2, 8, 9A, C, 10A1, A2, 11, 13A). Hence, it appears
that the thick bundles of cluster (9) interneurons on passing into the olfactory lobe are surrounded by ncON. Patch
C of the ncON is closely linked to patch D by a broad
neuropil bridge. Both patches are located antero-laterally
in the ONs and are flanked by the columnar neuropil (Fig.
3C–H, 4C, D, 7B2, 9C, 10A1, A2, C, 11B–E). Patch E of

profiles (putative peptidergic release sites) are embedded whereas in the posterior median protocerebral neuropil (PMPN)
finer profiles are present. The glomeruli in the accessory neuropil (AcN) show both, synapsin- and RFamide-like immunoreactivity. Within the olfactory globular tract (OGT), a synaptic neuropil region is embedded that also shows RFamide-like immunoreactivity. The accessory olfactory globular tract neuropil (OGTNa) that is associated with the olfactory globular tract,
shows synapsin immunoreactivity but not any peptidergic labeling.

The thick neurite bundles from cluster (9) interneurons, after entering the olfactory lobe, split into a large anterior (aB) and posterior bundle (pB). These bundles then branch out into finer bundles the fibers in which approach the
proximal part of the olfactory glomeruli (arrows in C). Between the olfactory neuropil (ON) and the lateral antenna 1 neuropil (LAN), the soma of at least
one large serotonergic neuron is located (arrowheads in B, C) but the axonal projection could not be traced. The dotted line in C encircles a blood vessel
(BV).

tions failed to show a co-localization of both labels (Fig.
12) suggesting that, if RFamide-like peptides are released
into the ncON, synapsins are not associated with these
release sites (at least as far as detectable with our methods).
Deutocerebrum: other neuropils
The median antenna 1 neuropil (MAN) extends across the
brain posterior to the protocerebrum behind the cerebral
artery and is on both sides flanked by the arms of the
olfactory globular tract (Fig. 6D1, D2, 7A1, A2, 8). Anteriorly, it seems to be continuous with the protocerebral
neuropils. It displays both, strong SYNir and Rfir, the latter being distributed in rather coarse profiles (Fig. 6D2, 8).
The lateral antenna 1 neuropil (LAN) in decapod crustaceans is known to receive afferents from the mechanoreceptors of the antenna 1 (Sandeman et al. 1992, 1993). In
C. clypeatus, it caudally adjoins the median antenna 1
neuropil (Fig. 3F–H, 4D–F, 5A, B, 6A, 7A1, 7, 9A–C, 13A)
and in some sections seems to be connected to this
neuropil (Fig. 3F, 4F, 5A, 7A2). Similar to the non-columnar olfactory neuropil, large, round RFir profiles are
embedded in the SYNir neuropil of this structure (Fig. 8).

The accessory neuropil (AcN) or accessory lobe is another
conspicuous feature of the C. clypeatus deutocerebrum. It
is located medially to the ON, close to where the olfactory
globular tract exits the latter (Fig. 3G, H, 4E, F, 6D1, D2,
7, 8, 13A). The accessory lobe is composed of about
50–80 small, spherical glomeruli, all of which have a
diameter of around 10–15 μm (Fig. 13B–D). In specimens

processed for SYNir, the synaptic areas of the glomeruli
appear well separated from each other and the glomeruli
do not show any recognizable substructures (Fig. 13C–E).
Actin labeling reveals a bundle of fibers extending anteriorly from the accessory lobe towards the olfactory globular tract (Fig. 13B). However, we were not able to
determine if this fiber bundle connects to the latter tract.
Fig. 13F shows a specimen processed for GSir. The arrow
identifies the soma of a glia cell, the processes of which
branch and associat with several glomeruli in the accessory lobe.
Tritocerebrum
The antenna 2 neuropil (AnN) receives afferent input
from the second antenna but also provides motor innervation for the muscles that move this antenna [52]. It is
located posteriorly to the lateral antenna 1 neuropil and is
visible in the middle of the section stacks (Fig. 4E, F, 5D,
6B1, B2, 7A, 10C, 14). With neither SYNir nor RFir could
we recognize any compartmentalization or substructures
in this neuropil (Fig. 14). Yet, once again we observed
large and very prominent RFir swellings in the neuropil
suggesting the presence of peptide release sites (Fig. 14
inset).

duced at the same scale to make the point that specifically
one of the eyestalk neuropils, the hemiellipsoid body,
almost matches the size of the olfactory lobes (ON). The
medial protocerebrum is connected to the eyestalk
neuropils via the protocerebral tract (PT; Fig. 15B), which
includes the olfactory globular tract that ascends from the
deutocerebrum. The eyestalks contain the lateral protocerebrum which is composed of the medulla terminalis (MT)
and the hemiellipsoid body (HE). Furthermore, the four
optic neuropils lamina (La), medulla (Me), lobula (Lo)
and a small proximal lobula neuropil (LoP) are enclosed
in the eyestalks (Fig. 15A–D, 18A). Because the spatial
arrangement of the eyestalk neuropils is rather complicated, Fig. 15 presents low power views of four different
specimens to demonstrate these relationships and also to
provide an idea of the level of structural variation between
individuals.
This paragraph will focus on the neuropils that constitute
the lateral protocerebrum, the closely associated hemiellipsoid body (enclosed by dots in Fig. 15B) and the
medulla terminalis (MT). The lobula ontogenetically
derives from the medulla terminalis and hence is part of
the lateral protocerebrum [60]. Nevertheless, in the
present account it will be described together with the
other two visual neuropils. The demarcation between the
medulla terminalis and the hemiellipsoid body is difficult
to draw and we will here use the RFir as a somewhat arbi-

trary landmark. The opposed arrows in Fig. 15B–E mark
the border between the medulla terminalis which is filled
by a loose network of peptidergic fibers and the hemiellipsoid body that displays strong SYNir. A cluster of RFir cell
bodies flanks the medulla terminalis laterally and probably gives rise to at least some of the RFir innervation of
this neuropil (inset in Fig. 16A2). In low power views,
strongly RFir fibers in the protocerebral tract (Fig. 15B)
seem to spread out and give rise to an intense peptidergic
innervation of the medulla terminalis. At a higher magnification, the protocerebral tract carries only few distinct
RFir fibers (Fig. 6D1, arrows in Fig. 16A2). Yet, even
higher magnifications of the protocerebral tract close to
the medulla terminalis (see frame in Fig. 16A2) reveals an
extensive network of very fine RFir fibers within this tract
(Fig. 16E). We could not determine if this network represents efferent fibers from the median brain to the lateral
protocerebrum or if they originate from the local RFir neurons associated with the medulla terminalis.
The hemiellipsoid body is a large (ca. 300 μm in diameter), spherical neuropil that is associated with a compact,
laterally situated cluster of densely packed neurons, the
lateral protocerebral interneurons (LPI; Fig. 15A–E, 16A1,
B, 17A–C). With the synapsin label, several neuropil compartments are visible within the hemiellipsoid body. The
peripheral cap neuropil is separated by the unlabelled
intermediate layer 1 (IL 1) from the strongly SYNir core

Furthermore, the four optic neuropils lamina (La), medulla (Me), lobula (Lo) and lobula plate are enclosed in the eyestalks. The low power views presented

large spherical neuropil that is associated with a compact, laterally situated cluster of densely packed neurons, the lateral protocerebral interneurons (LPI).
With the synapsin label, several neuropil compartments are visible within the hemiellipsoid body, the peripheral cap neuropil (Cap) which is separated by
the unlabelled intermediate layer 1 (IL 1) from the strongly synapsin immunoreactive core neuropil 1 (Co1). A second unlabeled intermediate layer (IL 2)
separates core neuropil 1 from the more proximally located core neuropil 2 (Co2). Asterisks in B-E2 and F mark the point where the two intermediate
layers meet. The boxed area in C1 is shown at a higher magnification in E. The demarcation between the medulla terminalis (MT) and the hemiellipsoid
body is difficult to draw. The opposed arrows in B-E tentatively mark the border between these two structures. From the medulla terminalis, strongly
labeled RFamide-like immunoreactive fibers invade the core neuropils 1 and 2 (Co1, Co2) of the hemielliposid body where they terminate in a circumscribed field with very fine varicosities (E, F). Intermediate layers IL1 and IL2 are unlabeled. The arrows in F identify patches of neuropil that seem to
extend across the intermediate layer 1.

neuropil 1 (Co1). A second unlabeled intermediate layer
(IL 2) separates core neuropil 1 from the more proximally
located core neuropil 2 (Co2; Figs. 15, 16, 17). We suggest
that the unlabelled intermediate layers 1 and 2, which
have a common origin (asterisks in Fig. 15B, C1, D, E1, F,
17B), may be the sites where the fibers of the lateral protocerebral interneurons penetrate into the hemiellipsoid
body. From the medulla terminalis, strongly labeled RFir
fibers invade the core neuropils 1 and 2 of the hemielliposid body, where they terminate in a circumscribed field
with very fine varicosities (Fig. 15E). This field is labeled
with a dotted line in figures 16A1, B, 17D4). Apart from
this strongly labeled field, high power views of the cap
and those regions of the core neuropils that in low power
views did not seem to display RFir, nevertheless demonstrate a weak but distinct peptidergic innervation. Fig.
16D demonstrates that both the cap and core 1 neuropils
are filled with numerous very small RFir profiles, some of
which are arranged in a string, suggesting an intense peptidergic innervation of these neuropils. This string-like
appearance is even more apparent in tangential sections
(Fig. 17; see below). Already at low magnification, in
preparations with SYNir, the core neuropils one and two
have a layered appearance (Fig. 15E1, 16A1). Higher
power views reveal that not only the core but also the cap
neuropils are clearly organized into parallel layers, or
lamellae (Fig. 16B, 17D2–D4). Fig. 17B shows a transverse section of the hemiellipsoid body, the position of
which is indicated in Fig. 17A. This section nicely demonstrates the arrangement of the intermediate layers 1 and 2
(the dotted lines delineates a damaged region of the tissue). Furthermore, the extensive cluster of lateral protocerebral interneurons is seen to stretch around both
sides of the hemiellipsoid body. Fig. 17D1–D4 shows a
series of tangential optical sections through the hemiellipsoid body, the positions of which are indicated in Fig.
17A. Section D1 is the most superficial and shows the cap
region as well as the intermediate layer 1. Section D2 is
slightly deeper and touches the upper part of core
neuropil 1. The insets in sections D1–D3 demonstrate the
string-like arrangement of tiny RFir profiles in the cap
neuropil, and the inset in D4 shows similar profiles in the
core neuropil 1. In sections D3 and D4 strands of lightly
SYNir material (arrows in D3) seem to span across the
intermediate layer 1 thus connecting the core neuropil 1
and the cap neuropil (see also arrows in Fig. 15F). This
hemiellipsoid body sector, which is strongly invaded by
RFir fibers, is identified by a dotted line in section D4. Sections with the nuclear counter stain reveal the presence of
cell nuclei that are interspersed in the core 1 neuropil (Fig.
16B, 17C). These nuclei presumably belong to endothelial cells of blood vessels. In addition the interface
between intermediate layer 1 and core neuropil 1 is lined
with cell nuclei (arrows in Fig. 17C).

The eyestalk neuropils: lamina, medulla, lobula (optic
neuropils)
In decapod crustaceans, the visual input from the compound eyes is processed in three columnar optic
neuropils, the lamina (lamina ganglionaris according to
the older terminology), the medulla (medulla externa)
and the lobula (medulla interna) all of which are enclosed
in the eyestalk (compare Fig. 15, 18). Recent studies provide evidence for a fourth neuropil in crabs associated
with the lobula, the lobula plate [61]. All neuropils can be
identified by SYNir in C. clypeatus (Fig. 18A) but without
any additional markers that would allow the visualization
of the fiber composition it is not possible at the moment
to decide if the additional proximal lobula neuropil in C.
clypeatus corresponds to the lobula plate of brachyuran
crabs. As in Drosophila, the labeling in the lamina is
much weaker with the SYNORF antibody than in the
other neuropils (Fig. 18A, B). SYNir identifies the plexiform layer of the lamina. In the projection of a confocal
image stack the geometrical layout of the lamina is visible
reflecting the arrangement of optic cartridges (Fig. 18B).
Furthermore, a regular pattern of small RFir profiles is
present in the plexiform layer of the lamina (Fig. 18C).
The optic neuropils are surrounded by a layer of visual
interneurons that we did not chart in any detail (inset in
Fig. 18A). Many cell bodies are also present between the
lamina and the medulla (Fig. 18C, D, 19), and the
medulla and lobula (Fig. 19). The arrangement of cell
nuclei between the lamina and the medulla, in a kind of
negative image, reveals the course of fiber bundles that
connect the lamina and the medulla (arrows in Fig. 18C,
19D1, D2).

In synapsin labeled preparations, it becomes clear that the
medulla and lobula are composed of several parallel layers (Fig. 15, 18a). Darker, irregularly arranged areas in the
medulla and lobula neuropil presumable show the course
of blood vessels (Fig. 18a). A small but distinct additional
neuropil is proximally associated with the lobula (LoP;
Fig. 18A and inset). In tangential sections of medulla
labelled for SYNir and RFir, a regular arrangement of the
labeled profiles signifies the ordered, retinotopic organization of the medulla (Fig. 18D). In cross sections of the
medulla, RFir is clearly localized in three distinct parallel
layers (Fig. 19B1, B2). This neuropil is also strongly innervated by a cluster of serotonergic visual neurons located at
the side of it (double arrow in Fig. 19D2). Additionally,
serotonergic somata are located in the cell group between
the lamina and the medulla (arrows in Fig. 19D2). Within
the medulla neuropil, 5HTir is also arranged in parallel
layers although less distinct than RFir (Fig. 19C2, C3).
Cell somata with strong GSir, presumably ensheathing
glia cells, surround the medulla laterally and distally and
give rise to a strong glutamine synthetase signal within the
neuropil (Fig. 19C1, D1). In an image with SYNir, in

29 optical sections of 0.76 μm thickness covering z = 21.2 μm. The four single images are projections of 3 optical sections covering z = 0 – 1.5 μm (D1; the
most superficial section), z = 3.8 – 5.3 μm (D2), z = 9.1 – 10.6 μm (D3), and z = 18.2 – 19.7 μm (D4). The Cap (Cap) and core 1 (Co1) neuropils are visible
as well as the intermediate layer 1 (IL1). The insets in sections D1–D3 demonstrate the string-like arrangement of tiny RFir profiles in the cap neuropil
which are arranged parallel to the lamellae, and the inset in D4 shows similar profiles in the core neuropil 1. In sections D3 and D4, strands of lightly synapsin immunoreactive material seem to span across the intermediate layer 1 (arrows in D3). The dotted line in D4 identifies that sector of the core 1
neuropil that is strongly invaded by RFir fibers.

which the contrast and brightness levels were artificially
elevated, unspecific background staining reveals the presence of the inner optic chiasm, a cross-over of the fibers
that connect the medulla and the lobula (enclosed
between the arrows in Fig. 18E). GSir is also strong in the
third optic neuropil, the lobula. Within the neuropil, GSir
shows the layered appearance of the lobula (Fig. 19C1,
C3) that is also apparent with RFir (Fig. 19A, B1, B2) and
5HTir (Fig. 19C2). At least fourteen layers could be identified with RFir and SYNir but we did not analyze the layering in more detail (Fig. 19A). With all three markers,
one conspicuous layer in the lobula is devoid of labeling
(arrowheads in Fig. 19A, B1, B2, C1–3). A population of
weakly labelled RFir cell somata is associated proximally
with the lobula (single arrows in Fig. 19B1). Strongly RFir
profiles line the most proximal neuropil layer of the lobula (double arrows in Fig. 19A, B1).

Discussion
The terrestrial hermit crab C. clypeatus has evolved a sense
of aerial olfaction. Previous behavioral studies have provided evidence that these animals are very effective in
detecting food from a distance and in responding to airborne odors. Here we confirm that these behavioral observations are paralleled by a significant elaboration of brain
areas taking part in olfactory processing, as has already
been noted by Beltz and co-workers [42] who reported
that C. clypeatus has a fairly high number of elongate olfactory glomeruli compared to other Crustacea (see below).
We show that the primary olfactory centers (olfactory
lobes) in this species dominate the brain and are
equipped with a side olfactory lobe and that the secondary olfactory centers (hemiellipsoid bodies) are also very
large. The hemiellipsoid bodies which receive a massif
input of olfactory projection neurons are organized into
parallel neuropil lamellae. Furthermore, our data suggest
that the organization of the visual centers and those areas
associated with antenna two suggest that the visual and
mechanosensory skills of C. clypeatus are similar to those
of their marine relatives.
The central olfactory pathway – deutocerebral neuropils
In malacostracan crustaceans, afferent chemosensory
input from the olfactory receptor neurons housed in the
aesthetascs on the paired first antennae is processed in
conspicuous deutocerebral neuropil centers, the bilaterally arranged olfactory lobes. These consist of cone-like
areas of dense synaptic neuropil, the glomeruli, which are
arranged around the periphery of the lobe with the apices
pointing to the centre of the lobe (overviews in
[52,57,62,58-66]). Mechanosensory and non-olfactory
chemosensory input from the first antennae is processed
in the lateral antenna 1 neuropil (LAN) and the medial
antenna 1 neuropil (MAN; [65,67,68]). Schachtner and
coworkers [43] have summarized cellular characteristics

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

of the various classes of interneurons that are associated
with the glomeruli of the olfactory lobes. A longitudinal
subdivision of the glomeruli into the cap, subcap, and
base regions has been well documented in crayfish,
clawed and clawless lobsters [59,62,66,69-71] and the
olfactory glomeruli of C. clypeatus conform to this design.
The known numbers of glomeruli varies considerably
across the Reptantia ranging from ca. 200 in crayfish to
more than 1000 in spiny lobsters [43]. It has been speculated that there is a relationship between the number of
glomeruli and the classes of different olfactory receptor
neurons on the antennae and hence the number of different odors that the animals can resolve (discussed in
[42,43]). Recently, Mellon suggested [25] that "the
number of glomeruli in the olfactory lobe should provide
a numerical value close to, if not identical with, the actual
number of expressed odorant receptors across the olfactory receptor neuron array". Beltz and co-workers [42]
counted the numbers of olfactory glomeruli in 17 species
of reptantian crustaceans and attempted to correlate these
numbers to life styles, habitat, phylogenetic affinities, and
numbers of olfactory sensilla. Although their study did
not reveal a clear-cut correlation of glomerular numbers
with any of these factors but instead suggested that problems of size, sensitivity and selectivity have all interacted
during evolution of crustacean olfactory systems, a closer
look at these author's data nevertheless seems warranted.
Glomerular numbers were highest – between 960 and
1330 – in three species of Achelata, clawless lobsters with
a large body size. Among the remaining 14 representatives
of Homarida, Astacida, Thalassinida, Anomura, and
Brachyura, Coenobita clypeatus had the highest number of
glomeruli (ca. 800) and ranked third concerning olfactory
lobe volume and glomerular volume [42] indicating the
presence of a quite sophisticated olfactory system in this
organism.
The neurochemistry of the olfactory interneurons that
synapse within the glomeruli is complex (review [43]).
The variety of neuroactive substances that has been localized in the olfactory system include histamine, serotonin
and GABA [54,70,72,73], and the neuropeptides Substance P, FMRFamide, small cardioactive peptideb
[51,59,70,74-77] as well as a tachykinin-related peptide
[78], SIFamide [79] and a novel member of the allatostatin family [80]. Despite this detailed knowledge about the
cellular composition of the glomeruli and although
numerical aspects concerning the glomeruli were analyzed in a comparative approach [42], comparative studies of the anatomy of the olfactory lobe and the shape of
its glomeruli are not available for the Malacostraca. Table
1 provides a list of histological studies in which the shape
of the olfactory glomeruli in various malacostracan crustaceans is visible. In most Malacostraca examined so far,
the olfactory glomeruli are roughly conical or cylindrical

BMC Neuroscience 2008, 9:58

columns (but compare to Stomatopoda which seem to
have spherical glomeruli; see [81]) arranged radially
around the periphery of the lobes. Yet, the shape and size
of these glomeruli display a considerable variability. The
tall, narrow, and elongate shape of the glomeruli reported
here for C. clypeatus seem to represent one extreme end of
this variability. Of particular importance for this comparison are of course members of the closest related taxa, the
Thalassinida and Brachyura. In a synapsin labeled specimen of Callianassa australiensis (Thalassinida) the glomeruli are shaped like a barrel [82] and the same seems to be
the case in brachyuran crabs ([47,51,52], and Fig. 2B in
[43]). Among the few anomuran crabs analyzed so far are
squat lobsters of the genus Munida [41,83], which as
members of the Galatheidae are not closely related to the
Coenobitidae (Fig. 1). In Munida sarsi, the olfactory
glomeruli are conical and are only twice as long as they are
wide (Fig. 2B in [83]). Furthermore, one image of the
olfactory neuropil in Pagurus bernhardus (Paguridae) is
available (Fig. 2C in [43]).
In order to broaden the taxonomic horizon for a comparative analysis of anomuran olfactory systems we set out to
analyze the olfactory neuropils in some additional
anomuran taxa of the subgroup Paguroidea which are
closely related to the Coenobitidae (Harzsch and Hansson, unpublished data): Clibanarius erythropus, Diogenes
pugilator, and Calcinus elegans as members of the Diogenidae (compare Fig. 1) and Pagurus bernhardus again, as a
member of the Paguridae. Furthermore, we have analyzed
the giant robber crab Birgus latro [84] which as a member
of the Coenobitidae is most closely related to Coenobita
clypeatus. From this preliminary study it would appear that
the elongate shape of the glomeruli in C. clypeatus (at least
five times as long as theay are wide) and also in B. latro
marks one end of the range, whereas D. pugilator with
glomeruli that are only twice as long as they are wide
marks the other end. C. erythropus, C. elegans, and P. bernhardus fall in between these two extremes (Harzsch and
Hansson, unpublished data). As mentioned above, C.
clypeatus has a relatively high number of glomeruli (ca.
800) compared to other Decapoda [42]. The need to pack
many glomeruli in a radial array and a restricted amount
of space may promote the evolution of these elongate
glomeruli. A comparison with the marine hermit crabs
that we analyzed and with the studies listed in table 1 also
reveals that the existence of an additional side olfactory
lobe as shown here for C. clypeatus is not a typical feature
of other malacostracan crustaceans. However, one of its
nearest relatives, B. latro, has an olfactory neuropil that is
even composed of three sublobes [84].
Clearly, these anatomical features in concert with the high
number of olfactory glomeruli [42] and the remarkable
neuroarchitecture of their secondary olfactory processing

[44].

areas (see next section) suggest the central olfactory system of C. clypeatus and also of B. latro [20,84] to be well
adapted for aerial olfaction. These neuroanatomical findings can explain those behavioral reports that have provided evidence that the Coenobitidae are very effective in
responding to volatile odors and possess an excellent
sense of distance olfaction [20-22].

The central olfactory pathway – lateral protocerebrum
The lateral protocerebrum (medulla terminalis, glomeruli
centrales, and hemiellipsoid body; [63]) receives a massive input from the olfactory globular tract that originates
from the cluster (10) of projection neurons associated
with the deutocerebral olfactory and accessory lobes as
the major output pathway of these two neuropils (reviews
[25,57,58]). In the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, the projection neurons may amount to at least 100,000 per hemi
brain [85]. The layout of this neural pathway as well as
physiological aspects have been thoroughly analyzed in
crayfish, lobsters, and spiny lobsters [58,69,71,73,79,8591] as well as a recent set of experiments applying focal
injections of lipophilic tracers by Sullivan and Beltz
[82,92-94]. The paired olfactory globular tracts emerge
medially from the olfactory lobes and approach the midline of the brain where they meet to form a chiasm
(located slightly dorsal to the central body) and finally
target the lateral protocerebrum.

Details of the projection neuron pathway are best understood in crayfish by far, in which the hemiellipsoid body
is divided into two distinct lobes, neuropil regions I and
II, which are composed of thousands of microglomeruli.
The terminal branches of the projection neuron tract from
their olfactory lobe extend bilaterally to the medulla terminalis (Procambarus clarkii; [58,85,93]) or to the medulla
terminalis and the hemiellipsoid body region I (Cherax
destructor; [94]). The projection neuron tract from the
accessory lobe bifurcates in the chiasm and targets the
hemiellipsoid body region II on both sides of the brain
[93,94]. Within the microglomeruli, projection neuron
axons terminate within endings termed rosettes, each of
which makes as many as 165 output synapses upon local
interneurons [85,86]. The thousands of local protocerebral interneurons associated with the crayfish hemiellipsoid body [86,88,89,95] respond to olfactory stimulation
of the antennae I, stimulation of tactile receptors innervating the antennae II, and photic stimulation of the eyes
[89-91]. Because the local interneurons associated with
the crayfish accessory lobe provide tactile and visual sensitivity as well as chemosensory input, the projection neuron pathway from the accessory lobe is thought to take a
central role in conveying some of these stimuli to the
hemielliposid body [94]. Thus, the lateral protocerebrum
is thought to be a higher integration center for chemosensory,
mechanosensory
and
visual
stimuli
[25,57,58,69,92,93,96,97].
In addition to several reptantian decapods including the
spiny lobster Panulirus argus [63], several crayfish species
(see above), and the American lobster Homarus americanus
[92,93], comprehensive information on the lateral protocerebrum architecture obtained with methods that are
comparable to ours is available for representatives of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

non-reptantian malacostracan taxa Stomatopoda, Dendrobranchiata, Caridea, and Stenopodidea [82]. As mentioned above, in lobsters and crayfish, the projection
neuron pathway associated with the accessory lobe
(multi-modal stimuli) projects exclusively to the hemiellipsoid body whereas the projection neuron pathway
associated with the olfactory lobe (chemosensory stimuli)
projects mostly to the medulla terminalis [92,93]. Accessory lobes are thought to have emerged as an apomorphy
of the Reptantia [40,98]. In non-reptantian crustaceans
(which lack accessory lobes) the olfactory globular tract is
the output pathway of the olfactory lobe alone and terminates both in the medulla terminalis and the hemielliposid body. Therefore, Sullivan and Beltz [82] wanted to
know if in non-Reptantia the hemiellipsoid body may
function primarily as second-order olfactory neuropil and
wanted to trace the changes in the relative importance of
the medulla terminalis versus hemiellipsoid body in the
olfactory pathway during evolution of the Malacostraca.
These authors found that although the specific targets of
the olfactory globular tract have been conserved, the relative extent to which this tract innervates the medulla terminalis versus the hemiellipsoid body can nevertheless
vary markedly between species so that the relative importance of these two neuropils within the olfactory pathway
has changed. More specifically, in the ground pattern of
the Eumalacostraca, the medulla terminalis was the most
important second order olfactory neuropil but this role
gradually shifted more towards the hemiellipsoid body in
the evolutionary trajectory towards the Eureptantia [82].
The evolutionary appearance of the accessory lobe in the
Reptantia then initiated new changes of the connectivity
between the lateral protocerebrum in that the input from
the olfactory lobe to the medulla terminalis was maintained but the hemiellipsoid body attained a new, dominant multi-modal input from the accessory lobe.
Anomura and Brachyura are considered to be among the
most highly derived decapod taxa [99], and the accessory
lobes have become largely reduced in these two groups
[40,52]. Sandeman and Scholtz [98] consider this reduction to be a synapomorphy of these two taxa. Not much
detailed information is available about the lateral protocerebrum in Anomura and Brachyura that may serve as
a comparison to the findings presented here [52]. However, from the former study it is clear that another representative of the Coenobitidae, the giant robber crab Birgus
latro, also has an extremely enlarged hemiellipsoid body
that matches the size of the olfactory lobe (Fig. 11 in
[52]), similar to the situation in Coenobita clypeatus. A
recent re-investigation of B. latro has confirmed this finding [84]. Both the genera Birgus and Coenobita have
evolved a sense of aerial olfaction that is highly relevant
for their behavior and display large olfactory lobes compared to other Crustacea. The members of these two taxa

may have compensated for their small accessory lobe by
enlarging the hemiellipsoid body in order to maintain
good analyzing capacities for olfactory stimuli.
As C. clypeatus, the B. latro hemielliposid body also displays a lamellar organization [52,84]. As elaborated
above, the hemiellipsoid neuropil in crayfish and lobsters
is not lamellar but organized into thousands of
microglomeruli. Nevertheless, in the American lobster
(Homarida; [92]) and the mantis shrimp Gonodactylus
bredini (Stomatopoda) the hemiellipsoid is composed of
a hemielliptical, concave sheet of neuropil, the "cap", that
surrounds an inner neuropil "core" from which it separated by an intermediate layer [82]. This architecture
resembles the situation in C. clypeatus with the exception
that here, a second core neuropil is present. The lateral
protocerebra of Dendrobranchiata, Caridea, and Stenopodidea, in contrast, display either poorly differentiated
hemiellipsoid bodies or architectures that are different
from the cap/core motif [82]. One explanation could be
that the cap/core arrangement characterizes the ground
pattern of Malacostraca, to become reduced or modified
in multiple ways during the evolution of this taxon. A
more common motif is the layering of the hemiellipsoid
body neuropil. Such layers, although very few in numbers
are present in representatives of the Stomatopoda, the
Caridea, and the Stenopodidea [82]. In a preliminary
study of the hemiellipsoid body in the marine hermit
Pagurus bernhardus, we also found a moderate number of
layers (Harzsch and Hansson, unpublished data). Therefore, we suggest that layers in the hemielliposid body may
characterize the malacostracan ground pattern whereas
the microglomeruli in Astacida and Homarida are
derived. In this view, the lamellar architecture in the
hemiellipsoid body of Coenobitidae may be an elaboration of the ancestral "layer motif" and mirror the enlarged
olfactory lobes and the massif input of olfactory projection neurons. Interestingly, the vertical and medial lobes
of insect secondary olfactory neuropils, the mushroom
bodies, also display a layered structure in some species
(reviews [100,101]). The architecture of these layers has
been thoroughly studies in the honey bee [102-104] and
in the cockroach [105-107] in which also the developmental emergence of the layers has been explored
[108,109]. Emerging evidence suggests that ancestral
insect mushroom bodies were composed only of the
pedunculus and the lobes but lacked a calyx [101,110],
but it is unclear if the lobes had a layered structure in the
insect ground pattern. More detailed analyses with additional markers will be necessary to explore the question if
the laminar structure in the hemiellipsoid bodies of Coenobitidae evolved convergently to that in the insects or if
this design goes back to a shared principle in the common
ancestor of Crustacea and Hexapoda.

Comparison to other Crustacea – the optic neuropils
In malacostracan crustaceans, the visual input from the
compound eyes is processed in three columnar optic
neuropils, the lamina, the medulla, and the lobula the
architecture of which is best understood in crayfish [111114]. For a comparison with brachyuran crabs, which are
the sister taxon to the Anomura [44], a recent paper by
Sztarker and co-workers [61] on Chasmagnatus granulatus
is most relevant as well as other recent papers that have
explored evolutionary aspects of crustacean optic
neuropils [60,106,115].

In Crustacea, the axons of the histaminergic retinal photoreceptors R1–R7 project the eye receptor mosaic retinotopically onto the lamina ([114]; R8 terminates in the
medulla). From the lamina, the retinotopic mosaic is projected onto the medulla which in crayfish is divided into
an outer and an inner neuropil [114]. The neurochemical
architecture of the medulla is diverse (discussed in [79]).
The processes of tachykinin-related peptide immunoreactive neurons are arranged in four horizontals layers within
the crayfish medulla [116]. Crustacean-SIFamide immunoreactivity is localized in many columnar elements
within the outer neuropil as well as the inner neuropil of
the crayfish medulla [79]. Serotonergic neurons are associated with the medulla of Mysidacea [117] and crayfish
and in the latter group the serotonin immunoreactive
neurites branch in three horizontal layers of the medulla
[72,118,119]. Overall, the arrangement of the serotonergic cell somata in a lateral group and a second group distal
to the medulla as well as the horizontal layering that we
observed in C. clypeatus is quite similar to that in these
other crustaceans. The three distinct layers of FaRP immunoreactive neurites in the C. clypeatus medulla have a close
parallel in the crayfish where three SIFamide immunoreactive horizontal strata are present [79].
The third optic neuropil of Malacostraca, the lobula, (traditionally called "medulla interna"; see e.g. [63]) is the
most proximal neuropil to show a clear-cut columnar and
stratified organization. In crayfish, afferents from the
medulla that target the lobula comprise bundles of retinotopic columnar relay neurons and columnar T-neurons
[114]. With histological techniques, seven main strata can
be recognized in the crayfish lobula, three of which
receive input from the medulla [114]. This complicated
system of horizontal layers is also apparent in immunohistochemical studies [79,116]. In the present report, we
could distinguish as many as fourteen different layers in a
double labeling experiment of synaptic proteins and FaRP
immunoreactive material. Sztarker and co-workers [61],
using Bodian's reduced silver method, observed four
strata of tangential processes in transverse sections of the
lobula in the brachyuran crab Chasmagnatus granulatus.
Some of these strata contain the dendritic trees of wide-

field motion-sensitive neurons. The strata are separated by
several layers that consist of terminal processes of columnar elements and by tangential elements that extend
orthogonally [61]. In Fig. 7A and 7C of their contribution,
at least twelve or more layers can be distinguished in
transverse sections of the lobula but due to the incompatible methodology it is not possible to relate these layers to
our own findings. In summary, we conclude that, at the
coarse level of comparison with other studies that is possible at this time, the visual system in C. clypeatus in many
aspects is similar to that of other Malacostraca considering
its architecture and neurochemistry.

Conclusion
The primary olfactory centers are the dominating
neuropils of the medial brain in C. clypeatus, which parallels behavioral findings of an excellent sense of aerial
olfaction in these animals. The secondary olfactory centers (hemiellipsoid bodies) are also large and organized
into parallel neuropil lamellae. Future studies using backfill methods should analyze more details of the olfactory
pathway in these animals specifically with respect to comparing the hemiellipsoid body architecture in C. clypeatus
to the lamellate structure of the vertical and medial lobes
in insect mushroom bodies. The organization of the optic
neuropils and those neuropils associated with antenna 2
suggest that C. clypeatus has visual and mechanosensory
skills that are comparable to those of other Decapoda.
Preliminary studies on another highly terrestrial group of
Crustacea, the Oniscoidea ("wood lice"; members of the
Isopoda), suggest that, contrary to the Coenobitidae, the
deutocerebral olfactory pathway does not play a significant role for aerial olfaction in these animals [36-38].
Future studies on terrestrial Amphipoda, Astacida, and
Brachyura may shed light on how frequently the establishment of an aerial sense of olfaction evolved in Crustacea
during the transition from sea to land.

Methods
Immunohistochemistry
Adult specimens of Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst, 1791;
Anomura, Coenobitidae) were obtained from the "Zoologischer Großhandel Peter Hoch" (August Jeanmaire Str.
12, 79183 Waldkirch, Germany). The animals (ca. 5–8 cm
total length) were anaesthetized for at least one hour on
ice and then their brains were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). The isolated brains and
eyestalks were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS, ph
7.4 at 4°C. After fixation the tissues were washed for 4
hours in several changes of PBS and subsequently sectioned (80 μm) with a HM 650 V vibratome (Microm).
Overnight permeabilization in PBTx (0.3% Tx-100 in 0.1
M PBS, pH 7.4) at 4°C the specimens was followed by
incubation in the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
The antisera that we used were: polyclonal rabbit anti

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

FMRFamide (1:1000; DiaSorin, Cat. No. 20091, Lot No.
923602); polyclonal rabbit anti-serotonin (1:2000;
ImmunoStar Incorporated, Cat. No. 20080, Lot No.
541016); monoclonal mouse anti-synapsin „SYNORF1“
antibody (1:30 in PBS-TX, [120] antibody provided by E.
Buchner, Universität Würzburg, Germany); monoclonal
mouse anti-glutamine synthetase (1:100; BD Biosciences
Pharmingen, Cat. No. 610517). After incubation in the
primary antisera, tissues were washed in several changes
of PBS for 4 hours at room temperature and incubated in
secondary Alexa Fluor488 or Alexa Fluor 546 IgGs (1:50,
Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA) overnight at 4°C. All
sections were routinely counterstained with the nuclear
dye bisbenzimide (0.1%, Hoechst H 33258) for 15 min.
at room temperature. Some sections were processed with
a histochemical counter stain, a high-affinity probe for
actin, by adding Phallotoxins conjugated to Alexa Fluor
546 (Molecular Probes; concentration 200 units/ml) to
the secondary antibody in a dilution 1:50. Finally, the tissues were washed for at least 2 h in several changes of PBS
and mounted in GelMount (Sigma).
We carried out three sets of triple labeling experiments i.e.
combinations of markers:
1. synapsin immunolocalization with histochemical
counter stains of actin and cell nuclei.
2. RFamide-like immunoreactivity combined with synapsin immunolocalization and nuclear counter stain
3. glutamine synthetase-like immunoreactivity (GSir)
combined with serotonin immunolocalization (5-HTir)
and nuclear counter stain.
The localization of synapsin and actin as general markers
of neuropils structures was chosen to provide a good overview over the general brain architecture. Immunohistochemistry against RFamide-like peptides and against
serotonin labels subsets of neurons and allows the visualization of the neuronal processes. Furthermore, these two
markers have been applied in a wide range of crustaceans
thus allowing a good interspecific comparison. The antiglutamine synthetase is a glia marker and was chosen to
also include non-neuronal elements of the nervous system into this analysis. The nuclear marker HOECHST was
used to show the localization of the various cell clusters.
Thus, the chosen markers complement each other and the
whole set is well suited to visualize a broad range of different structures thus providing a detailed insight into the
crab's brain anatomy. Our analysis is based on more than
5 successfully processed brains per marker set, and the
labeling pattern was consistent between these specimens.
The specimens were viewed with a Zeiss AxioImager
equipped with the Zeiss Apotome structured illumination

device for optical sectioning ("grid projection"). Digital
images were processed with the Zeiss AxioVision software
package. In addition, specimens were analyzed with the
laser scanning microscope Zeiss LSM 510 Meta. Doublelabeled specimens were generally analyzed in the multitrack mode in which the two lasers operate sequentially,
and narrow band-pass filters were used to assure a clean
separation of the labels and to avoid any crosstalk
between the channels. All images were processed in
Adobe Photoshop using global picture enhancement features (brightness/contrast).
Specificity of the antisera
The tetrapeptide FMRFamide and FMRFamide-related
peptides (FaRPs) are widely distributed among invertebrates and vertebrates and form a large neuropeptide family with more than 50 members all of which share the
RFamide motif (reviews: [121-127]). In malacostracan
Crustacea, at least twelve FaRPs have been identified and
sequenced from crabs, shrimps, lobsters and crayfish
[128,129]. These peptides range from seven to twelve
amino acids in length and most of them share the carboxy
terminal sequence LRFamide. The antiserum we used was
generated in rabbit against synthetic FMRFamide (PheMet-Arg-Phe-NH2) conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin
(DiaSorin, Cat. No. 20091, Lot No. 923602). According to
the manufacturer, staining with this antiserum is completely eliminated by pretreatment of the diluted antibody with 100 μg/ml of FMRFamide. We repeated this
experiment and preincubated the antiserum with 100 μg/
ml FMRFamide (Sigma; 16 h, 4°C) and this preincubation abolished all staining. Because the crustacean FaRPs
know so far all share the carboxy terminal sequence LRFamide we conclude that the DiaSorin antiserum that we
used most likely labels any peptide terminating with the
sequence RFamide. Therefore, we will refer to the labeled
structures in our specimens as "RFamide-like immunoreactive (RFir) neurons" throughout the paper.

The antiserum against serotonin (ImmunoStar Incorporated; Cat. No. 20080, Lot No. 541016) is a polyclonal
rabbit antiserum raised against serotonin coupled to
bovine serum albumin (BSA) with paraformaldehyde.
The antiserum was quality control tested by the manufacturer using standard immunohistochemical methods.
According to the manufacturer, staining with the antiserum was completely eliminated by pretreatment of the
diluted antibody with 25 μg of serotonin coupled to BSA
per ml of the diluted antibody. We repeated this control
with the serotonin-BSA conjugate that was used for generation of the antiserum as provided by ImmunoStar (Cat.
No. 20081, Lot No. 750256; 50 μg of lyophilized serotonin creatinine sulfate coupled to BSA with paraformaldehyde). Preadsorption of the antibody in working dilution
with the serotonin-BSA conjugate at a final conjugate con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/58

centration of 10 μg/ml at 4°C for 24 h completely blocked
all immunolabelling. We performed an additional control
and preadsorbed the diluted antiserum with 10 mg/ml
BSA for 4 h at room temperature. This preadsorption did
not affect the staining, thus, providing evidence that the
antiserum does not recognize the carrier molecule alone.
The manufacturer also examined the cross reactivity of the
antiserum. According to the data sheet, with 5 μg, 10 μg,
and 25 μg amounts, the following substances did not react
with the antiserum diluted to 1:20,000 using the horse
radish peroxidase (HRP) labeling method: 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and dopamine.
The monoclonal mouse anti-Drosophila synapsin
„SYNORF1“ antibody (provided by E. Buchner, Universität Würzburg, Germany) was raised against a Drosophila
GST-synapsin fusion protein and recognizes at least four
synapsin isoforms (ca. 70, 74, 80, and 143 kDa) in western blots of Drosophila head homogenates [120]. In western blot analysis of crayfish homogenates, this antibody
stains a single band at ca. 75 kDa (see [130]). We conducted a western blot analysis comparing brain tissue of
Drosophila and Coenobita. The antibody provided identical
results for both species staining one strong band around
80–90 kDa and a second weaker band slightly above 148
kDa (Fig. 20). Our analysis strongly suggests that the
epitope which SYNORF 1 recognizes is strongly conserved
between the fruit fly and the hermit crab. Similar to Drosophila, the antibody consistently labels brain structures in
representatives of all major subgroups of the malacostracan crustaceans [42,131-134] in a pattern that is consistent with the assumption that this antibody does in fact
label synaptic neuropil in Crustacea. In the crustacean first
optic neuropil (the lamina), synapsin labeling is weak
compared to the other brain neuropils ([131]; and present
report). Similarly, in Drosophila labeling of the lamina is
weak because photoreceptors R1–R6 which have their
synapses in the lamina contain very little of the presently
known synapsin homolog isoforms [120]. The antibody
also labels neuromuscular synapses both in Drosophila
and in Crustacea [131]. These close parallels in the labeling pattern of SYNORF1 between Drosophila and various
Crustacea strengthens the claim that it also recognizes
crustacean synapsin homologs. This antibody even labels
synaptic neuropil in an ancestral clade of protostomes,
the Chaetognatha [135] suggesting that the epitope that
this antiserum recognizes is conserved over wide evolutionary distances.
The monoclonal mouse anti-glutamine synthetase antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Cat. No.
610517) was generated using sheep glutamine synthetase,
an octamer of identical 45 kDa subunits, as the immunogen. According to the manufacturer, this antibody labels a
single 45 kDa in Western blot analysis of rat brain

3D reconstruction
Image stacks obtained from z-series by the Zeiss LSM 510
Meta were directly loaded into the 3D reconstruction software Amira (Mercury Systems) operated on a Fujitsu Siemens
Celsius

workstation.
The
surface

Amira's "wrap" module for semiautomatic segmentation.
Neuroanatomical nomenclature
We describe our data in the context of crayfish brain anatomy as laid out in the studies of Blaustein and co-workers
[63], Sandeman et al. [40,52], Sandeman and Scholtz [98]
and Sandeman and Mellon [57]. Sandeman and co-workers [52] have compared the neuroanatomical nomenclature used during the past and have suggested a standard
nomenclature for the components of the brain of Decapoda which is adopted here with minor modifications that
concern the optic ganglia [114]. Sandeman and co-workers [52] have also recognized 17 different clusters of cell
bodies associated with the crayfish brain, which they
examined and numbered, 1–17, from anterior to posterior. We will adhere to this nomenclature and refer to cell
clusters by their given numbers in parentheses.

both species staining one strong band around 80–90 kDa and

homogenates. In Western blots of crayfish (Procambarus
clarkii) brain homogenates, the antibody labels a single
band at ca. 44 kDa (see [130]) which is in the same range
as the glutamine synthetase in the spiny lobster Panulirus
argus (42 kDa; [55]) suggesting that the antibody that we
used also binds to crustacean glutamine synthetase.
Because we did not conduct a western blot analysis in C.
clypeatus, we will refer to the labeled structures in our specimens as "glutamine synthetase-like immunoreactivity"
(GSir) throughout the paper.
In additional control experiments for possible nonspecific
binding of the secondary antiserum, we omitted the primary antiserum, replaced it with blocking solution, and
followed the labeling protocol as above. In these control
experiments, staining was absent.
