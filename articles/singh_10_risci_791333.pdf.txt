RISCI - Repeat Induced Sequence Changes
Identifier: a comprehensive, comparative
genomics-based, in silico subtractive hybridization
pipeline to identify repeat induced sequence
changes in closely related genomes
Vipin Singh*, Rakesh K Mishra

Abstract
Background -: The availability of multiple whole genome sequences has facilitated in silico identification of fixed
and polymorphic transposable elements (TE). Whereas polymorphic loci serve as makers for phylogenetic and
forensic analysis, fixed species-specific transposon insertions, when compared to orthologous loci in other closely
related species, may give insights into their evolutionary significance. Besides, TE insertions are not isolated events
and are frequently associated with subtle sequence changes concurrent with insertion or post insertion. These
include duplication of target site, 3’ and 5’ flank transduction, deletion of the target locus, 5’ truncation or partial
deletion and inversion of the transposon, and post insertion changes like inter or intra element recombination,
disruption etc. Although such changes have been studied independently, no automated platform to identify
differential transposon insertions and the associated array of sequence changes in genomes of the same or closely
related species is available till date. To this end, we have designed RISCI - ‘Repeat Induced Sequence Changes
Identifier’ - a comprehensive, comparative genomics-based, in silico subtractive hybridization pipeline to identify
differential transposon insertions and associated sequence changes using specific alignment signatures, which may
then be examined for their downstream effects.
Results -: We showcase the utility of RISCI by comparing full length and truncated L1HS and AluYa5
retrotransposons in the reference human genome with the chimpanzee genome and the alternate human
assemblies (Celera and HuRef). Comparison of the reference human genome with alternate human assemblies
using RISCI predicts 14 novel polymorphisms in full length L1HS, 24 in truncated L1HS and 140 novel
polymorphisms in AluYa5 insertions, besides several insertion and post insertion changes. We present comparison
with two previous studies to show that RISCI predictions are broadly in agreement with earlier reports. We also
demonstrate its versatility by comparing various strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for IS 6100 insertion
polymorphism.
Conclusions -: RISCI combines comparative genomics with subtractive hybridization, inferring changes only when
exclusive to one of the two genomes being compared. The pipeline is generic and may be applied to most
transposons and to any two or more genomes sharing high sequence similarity. Such comparisons, when
performed on a larger scale, may pull out a few critical events, which may have seeded the divergence between
the two species under comparison.

Background
Mobile or transposable elements (TEs) are DNA
sequences that have the ability to hop (transpose) in the
genome, within their cell of origin. TEs constitute a
highly diverse class of repeat elements [1,2] and have
been reported in all genomes sequenced till date except
Plasmodium falciparum [[3], reviewed in [4]]. Based on
the mechanism of transposition [reviewed in [5]], TEs
are broadly divided into two classes - Class I or Retrotransposons and Class II or DNA transposons. Retrotransposons transpose via an RNA intermediate which
is reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome,
thereby duplicating the element (copy paste mechanism). DNA transposons, on the other hand, excise from
their source locus to reinsert at a new one without
the involvement of an RNA intermediate (cut paste
mechanism) [1].
TEs represent miniature genomes with a versatile
repertoire of cis regulatory elements and/or trans acting
factors. Long relegated as selfish DNA [6,7], they are
turning out to be a treasure trove of genomic novelties
as their impact on host genome evolution is beginning
to be understood [8-13]. Besides serving as an inexhaustible source of novel genes and exons [13-20], gene
functions [21-23], and regulatory motifs and signals
[24-27], the insertion of a transposon at a locus may
change its properties drastically with local and/or long
range or global consequences [10,28-31]. These changes
are more palpable when a transposon insertion results
in gene disruption and is manifested as a disease condition [32-34]. Such insertions may be subject to negative
selection and lost in due course [35].
Most transposon insertions that persist are, therefore,
either silent or result in subtle and/or adaptive changes.
The cumulative impact of these subtle changes may
account for the observed phenotypic, physiological and
behavioral differences between closely related genomes
that share a high degree of sequence similarity [36].
Notable examples include human-specific inactivation of
the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene via
Alu- mediated replacement resulting in widespread biochemical difference between human and non human
primates [37] and the loss of exon 34 of tropleolastin
gene in human via an Alu recombination-mediated
deletion [38].
The challenge, then, is to selectively identify these differential insertions and the consequent alteration of the
target locus. To this end, we have designed RISCI “Repeat Induced Sequence Changes Identifier”, a comprehensive comparative genomics based in silico
subtractive hybridization pipeline to identify such
changes, if exclusive to one of the two genomes being
compared. It is modeled on LINEs or Long Interspersed

Nuclear Elements (non Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons) [reviewed in [39]], since they display a wide
array of sequence changes upon insertion, such as target
site duplication, 3’and 5’ flank transduction, deletion of
target locus upon insertion, inversion and truncation of
repeat sequence during transposition besides post insertion modifications like disruption and recombination
[40]. In the test dataset of 302 full length L1HS
elements (LINE1- Human Specific) in the reference
human genome, RISCI predicted and confirmed 26
human-specific 3’ flank transduction events (in comparison with the chimpanzee genome), predicted 14 novel
insertion polymorphism (compared to alternate human
assemblies - Celera and HuRef), 1 inter element recombination in the human genome resulting in the loss of
13.4 kb of sequence and 4 inter element recombination
events in the chimpanzee genome. 42 Human specific 3’
flank transduction and at least 24 novel polymorphic
insertions, besides several recombination events were
inferred from analysis of truncated L1HS retrotransposons. RISCI also predicted 140 novel AluYa5 polymorphic insertions in the reference human genome (in
comparison with alternate human assemblies - Celera
and HuRef).

Results
RISCI is a comparative genomics-based pipeline which
sequentially picks the transposon loci in one genome
(’Reference ‘ or ‘Main’ genome), using one of the three
repeat mining options (see materials and methods), and
precisely zooms into the corresponding orthologous loci
in other genome(s) (’Comparative genome(s)’) using
user defined length of flanks (default 5000 bases)
extending 50 bases into the transposon (repeat overhangs) and Blastn [41]. It then infers the nature of
alteration either at the transposon locus in the reference
genome or the ortholog in the comparative genome(s),
based on event specific-alignment signatures (discussed
below). The genomic context (intergenic or genic, if
genic - exonic or intronic) of the transposon locus in
the reference genome and the ortholog in the comparative genome(s) is also integrated by parsing the annotation files, if available. For each transposon locus in the
reference genome, RISCI sequentially assesses whether
the orthologous locus in the comparative genome is
occupied (indicating shared ancestry), has undergone
post insertion changes, or is empty. If empty, RISCI
infers insertion-associated sequence changes based on
the location of target site duplication (TSD - discussed
later). If TSD is not found, the orthologous locus is
checked for insertion-mediated deletion or parallel independent insertions or insertion deletion at the orthologous locus (Figure 1).

Figure 1 RISCI flow chart depicting basic steps of the pipeline. Major inputs include the repeat name (as identified by Repeat Masker),
repeat mining option, filter inputs, flank length (default 5000 bases), merger threshold (default 50 bases), size of non-repeat tag (default 500
bases), maximum target site duplication (TSD) size (default 50 bases) and speed options. The genomic annotation of the repeat locus is parsed
from the gen bank file if made available. The upstream sequence is tagged with user defined length of non repeat sequence wherever possible
(default 500 bases). The upstream and downstream flanks, each carrying 50 base overhang into the repeat, are BLASTed separately against the
comparative genome(s) and the BLAST alignment files summarized. For each repeat locus in the main genome, all upstream blast hits are
compared against downstream blast hits in the same orientation and sequentially checked for shared ancestry (occupied), post insertion
changes (recombination-mediated deletions, disruptions etc.), target site duplication (orthologous locus empty) and classified as CAN, PAC or
PTS. If no matches for TSD are found both on the corresponding chromosomal homologue as well as on other chromosomes, the locus is
checked for miscellaneous events (INDELs) like insertion-mediated deletion or parallel insertion or insertion deletion on corresponding
chromosomal homolog, else the locus is reported as no match found (NMF). In the final results file, RISCI annotation for each locus, genomic
annotation of the repeat loci in the main or reference genome and of the orthologous locus in the comparative genome, percentage repeat
content of the flanks, Blastn coordinates (query and subject) for the flanks, size of TSD or INDEL or RMD are reported. In case of TSD, sequence
of 5’ and 3’ TSD in the reference genome and of the lone copy of TSD in the comparative genome are also reported.

RISCI was tested on full length (>6 Kb) (Table 1,
Additional files 1, 2 and 3) and truncated L1HS elements (Table 1, Additional files 2, 4, 5 and 6) and
AluYa5 (Table 1, Additional files 7, 8, 9 and 10) humanspecific retrotransposons with the reference human genome [42] as the reference or main genome and the
reference chimpanzee [43] and alternate human assemblies, Celera [44] and HuRef [45], as the comparative
genomes. RISCI predicted several polymorphic loci in
reference human genome comparison with the alternate

human assemblies (Additional files 11 and 12). To test
the efficacy of RISCI, we present a comparison with the
data of Mills et al (Additional file 13) and partially recapitulate a study published earlier by Sen et al [46]
(Additional files 14 and 15). Further, to demonstrate
that RISCI can handle other transposon classes in other
related genomes as well, we present a preliminary analysis checking for presence-absence of IS element (DNA
transposon) in various strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Additional file 16). We describe here in details

the findings of a study on full length and truncated
L1HS and AluYa5 retrotransposons.
1. Full length L1HS elements

302 full length (> = 6 kb) L1HS elements were identified using the RISCI_RM option for repeat mining (See
materials and methods). Among these, RISCI identified
100 insertions as genic (all intronic). Unless otherwise
stated, the inferences refer to the transposon locus in
the reference or main genome (Table 1, Additional
file 1).
Inferences based on the orthologous locus in the reference
chimpanzee genome

a. Shared ancestry Retrotransposons represent identity
by descent markers and are largely homoplasy free [[47]
and references therein, [48]]. Therefore, the orthologous
locus is considered to have shared ancestry and is annotated as “OCCUPIED” if the repeat overhangs align
completely and contiguously with their respective flanks
in the comparative genome and the separation between
the upstream and downstream flanks is approximately
equal (± 100) to the size of the transposon in the reference genome (Figure 2). It is in context to add that the

homoplasy free attribute of retrotransposon markers has
been questioned occasionally [49,50].
Only 1 locus, L1HS_4_31 (see materials and methods
for nomenclature of repeat locus), was found to be
occupied in chimpanzee, L1HS being human-specific.
b. Post insertion changes two major types of post insertion changes are possible viz. recombination and
disruption.
Homology-based recombination between two similarly
oriented repeats on a chromosome results in loss of the
intervening sequence and one copy of the homologous
sequence. The recombination event may be exclusive to
the main or reference genome - M_INTER_RMD (Main
genome INTER element Recombination Mediated Deletion) or to the comparative genome, C_INTER_RMD
(Comparative genome INTER element Recombination
Mediated Deletion). In M_INTER_RMD, the repeat

overhangs align completely and contiguously with their
respective flanks in the comparative genome (assuming
that the insertions are not specific to the reference genome), the separation between the flanks is greater than
the size of the repeat in the reference genome and the
transposon in the reference genome aligns completely
(full length) with one of the two transposon copies in
the comparative genome (Figure 3). A similar alignment
is obtained in case the transposon locus is disrupted in
the comparative genome (C_DISRUPTED). However, in
this case, the transposon in the main or reference genome does not show full length alignment with any of
the two repeats in the comparative genome (Figure 3).
Based on the alignment signatures, the locus is annotated as C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD and resolved
later by pair-wise blast between the transposon in
the main genome and the orthologous locus in the

consequential loss of one copy of homologous region (R2) and the intervening sequence. Note that the 5’ TSD of R12 comes from R1 (blue

comparative genome. L1HS_4_29c was annotated as
C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD, and was shown to be
a disruption due to Ns in chimpanzee.
Disruptions in main genome are resolved using specific alignment signatures by the RISCI defragmentation
module (discussed later). On the other hand, if the
repeat overhangs align completely and contiguously with
their respective flanks in the comparative genome,
but the separation between the flanks is less than the
transposon locus in the main genome, the locus is
annotated as C_INTRA_RMD (intra-element recombination mediated deletion in comparative genome). No
C_INTRA_RMD event was identified in chimpanzee.
C_INTER_RMD presents more complex signatures.
Given sufficient flank length (large enough to span

Page 6 of 25

beyond the two repeats in question in the reference genome), such events can also be identified by RISCI. For
one repeat in the main genome (R1), only one of the
repeat overhangs shows complete and contiguous alignment with the flank (non recombined end). The region
immediately flanking the repeat overhang and not
aligned in the other flank represents the sequence lost
during recombination (Figure 4). For the other repeat
(R2), an overlap between upstream and downstream
query in the repeat overhang is seen. Alternatively, overlap between upstream and downstream query in the 5’
repeat overhang for one repeat, and 3’ overhang for the
other repeat may also be identified (Figure 4). A disruption specific to the reference genome, the orthologous
locus in the comparative genome being occupied and

overhang, Q2R1 - 3’ flank of R1 with 50 bp repeat overhang, Q2R2 - 3’ flank of R2 with 50 bp repeat overhang. As can be seen from the figure,
the flank size should be sufficiently long to span the entire intervening region and other copy of the repeat to pick up such changes.

intact also gives a similar signature (Additional file 17,
Figure S1). Therefore, RISCI classifies such loci as
C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED.
Contrary to expectations of no C_INTER_RMD
events in chimpanzee, 4 such recombination events
(L1HS_ 2_14, 3_13, 5_3 and 12_10) were reported with
high RISCI scores (refer methods) and low N-scores
(%Ns in a sequence). For each of these loci, 5’ truncated L1 element was found in close proximity downstream of the transposon locus in the human genome.
All retrieved orthologous loci in chimpanzee aligned
with the L1HS sequence in the human genome except
L1HS_5_3. This sequence was, however, annotated as
L1MA9 by RepeatMasker suggesting homology with
L1HS sequence. 1586 bases of intervening sequence in
L1HS_3_13 were lost in recombination. In the other
three cases the recombining repeats were located next
to each other.
The fact that an orthologous locus each in chimpanzee was found to be occupied and disrupted and 4
orthologous loci showed recombination suggests that
though largely human specific, as evidenced by the large
number of empty alleles in chimpanzee, L1HS predate
human chimpanzee divergence, as has been reported
earlier [51]
c. Inferences based on empty allele at the orthologous
locus Target site duplication (TSD) upon transposon
insertion is almost universal [1]. Exceptions include
DIRS (Dictyostelium Interspersed Repeats) among retrotransposons [52] and Crypton [53] and Helitron [54]
super families of DNA transposons. Loci not found to
be occupied or altered post insertion in the comparative
genome(s) are then screened for the empty locus using
a novel TSD finding strategy.
The rationale behind this strategy is that since both
the upstream and downstream flanks of the transposon
carry the target site duplication sequence, of which
only one copy is present at the orthologous empty
locus in the comparative genome, when the upstream
and downstream flanks are separately blasted against
the comparative genome, the flanks would show an
overlap in the comparative genome in the region of
the TSD (Figures 5 and 6). The TSD sequence is thus
used as a clamp to accurately identify the empty orthologous locus in the comparative genome(s). A TSD size
of zero is allowed to accommodate endonuclease independent L1 insertions [55] and transposons which do
not duplicate target site. RISCI further classifies the
transposition event in the reference genome as canonical (excusive mobilization of the transposon sequence)
or non canonical (transposition with flank transduction), based on the position of the TSD in the downstream flank. TSDs were identified for 270 loci in
chimpanzee.

Canonical transposition
The 3’ end of non LTR retrotransposons are generally
under or overestimated by RepeatMasker since they end in
highly variable poly-A tails. To accommodate this anomaly,
even if the TSD is found 20 bases downstream of the
RepeatMasker annotated 3’ end, the retrotransposition event
is annotated as CAN (Canonical). 170 loci in the reference
human genome were annotated as CAN (Figure 5).
Additionally, the RNA transcription machinery occasionally skips the retrotransposon’s weak polyadenylation signal
resulting in a readthrough transcript. This transcript when
subsequently integrated at another locus effectively duplicates the original 3’ flank to the extent of the readthrough
[56-58]. This mechanism may lead to exon shuffling
[58,59] and gene duplication [60]. Therefore, in non-LTR
retrotransposons where the TSD is found beyond 20 base
pairs of the RepeatMasker annotated 3’ end, the unmatched
region beyond the repeat overhang till the beginning of the
TSD may either represent a grossly misannotated poly-A
tail or a true 3’ transduced flank (Figure 6).
If the A-score (∑A/length of unmatched downstream
sequence) > 0.65 or AT-score (∑(A+T)/length of
unmatched downstream sequence) is > 0.90, the transposition is annotated as PAC (Poly A Canonical-canonical transposition with a grossly misannotated poly A

tail). The score thresholds were fixed on the basis of
empirical observations and may be reset by the user. 68
Loci were annotated as PAC. It is important to restate
here that both CAN and PAC represent canonical insertions (exclusive mobilization of transposons sequence).
RISCI thus precisely defines transposition boundaries in
the reference genome if the orthologous locus is empty
in the comparative genome, providing an improvement
over RepeatMasker annotations (Additional file 17 Figures S2 and S3). The remaining 32 loci, for which TSDs
were identified, qualify as putative 3’ flank transduction
events and are annotated as PTS (loci with Putative
Transduced Sequence, Figure 6).
3’ flank transduction
RISCI has inbuilt confirmation module for 3’ flank
transductions. A putative transduced flank is confirmed
as a true transduction event when it has at least two nonredundant Blast high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) in the
reference genome - one from where the sequence is
picked - target or current locus (complete match), and
the other from where it has moved to the target locus source locus (partial - no match for the polyA tail), and/
or one hit (partial) in the comparative genome on the
chromosomal homolog corresponding to the source
locus in the reference or main genome (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Signatures of true 3’ flank transduction. The source locus in the main genome consists of an L1 element with TSDs (blue arrows)
which moves to the target or current locus along with a part of the 3’ flank (brown bold line) forming new TSDs (black arrows). In contrast, no
flank transduction takes place in the current locus in the comparative genome. As indicated, the query consists of one copy of the original TSD
(blue line), the transduced flank (brown bold line) and the second poly A tail (dotted brown line). When blasted on the main genome, at least
two hits are obtained - one complete match at the current locus and one almost complete match (barring the poly A tail) at the source locus.
In the comparative genome, no match is found at the orthologous current locus (since no transposition event has taken place for lack of L1
element at the source locus as shown here, or otherwise). The match at the source locus in the comparative genome is similar to the match at
the source locus in the main genome and on corresponding chromosomal homologue. RISCI has an inbuilt module for 3’ flank transduction
confirmation which enlists the putative transduced sequence, the number of blast hits obtained in the main and comparative genomes and the
most probable source locus in the two genomes in case multiple hits are obtained. From left to right - Pink line - 5’ flank at the source locus,

Of the 32 loci predicted as PTS, the source locus was
unambiguously identified for 23 both in the main genome and the comparative genome. For another 3
(L1HS_5_18c, 9_8 and 18_10), the source locus in
human was clear and the only hit in chimpanzee was
partial but on the chromosome corresponding to the
identified source locus in the main genome. The source
locus for L1HS_7_14 in chimpanzee is ambiguous. No
matches in chimpanzee were found for L1HS_1_24c.
The A-score or AT-score of L1HS_4_22, L1HS_18_7
and L1HS_X_9c were very close to the threshold and
actually represent misannotated poly-A tails. L1HS_8_6c
is falsely reported as PTS. The length of the confirmed
transduced flanks ranged from 50 bp to 1600 bp. (Additional file 2).
5’ flank transductions
5’ flank transductions occur when a strong upstream
promoter drives transcription into the L1 sequence. In
such cases the 5’ TSD is found slightly upstream of the
actual L1 5’ end. Template switching [61-63] may also
result in formation of 5’ TSD upstream of the transposon 5’ end. Of the 12 reported 5’ flank transductions by
RISCI, 4 (L1HS_ 7_11, 11_10c, 15_1c and X_19c) were
found to satisfy flank transduction criteria (mentioned
earlier) and represent confirmed 5’ flank transductions
(Additional file 3). In the remaining cases, the putative
transduced flank was a repeat sequence with multiple
hits and may have come to occupy the current locus
either as a consequence of 5’ flank transduction or
insertion into the 5’ end of L1. The possibility of template switching is minimal since L1 reverse transcriptase
is known to have low processivity.
c. Insertion-mediated deletion or parallel independent insertions or insertion-deletions Retrotransposons
like L1s and Alus have been reported to occasionally
cause deletions at the target site in cell culture assays as
well as by comparative genomics approaches [64-66].
Additionally, though rare, parallel independent insertion
at the same locus in the comparative genome is also
possible [67,68]. The orthologous locus may also
undergo independent changes (insertion, deletions or
gene conversions). In all cases the upstream and downstream flanks in the comparative genome are separated
from each other by the extent of deletion or parallel
insertion or other changes and the repeat overhangs do
not align contiguously with their respective flanks
(Figures 8 and 9) as opposed to recombination.
As in normal transposition, insertion-mediated deletions may result from a normal (CAN) or 3’ misannotated (PAC) or readthrough transcript (PTS). Hence
INDELs are sub annotated as INDEL_CAN (Figure 8),
INDEL_PAC and INDEL_PTS (Figure 9), depending on
how far from the annotated 3’ end of the repeat does
the match for the downstream flank starts. Most INDEL

with exclusive mobilization of the transposon. Insertionmediated deletion results in replacement of original sequence by
the transposon without the duplication of target site. On alignment
at the orthologous locus in the comparative genome, no match is
found for the repeat overhangs (represented by oblique green lines)
and the upstream and downstream flanks are separated by a
sequence stretch representing the original sequence lost upon
insertion of the repeat in the main genome. Ancestral locus - from

predictions by RISCI are a consequence of substitution
of actual sequence by an estimated number of Ns
(Figure 10). If the N-score is less than 10 and the locus
annotated as “INDEL_PTS”, the PTS is also retrieved
and confirmed as in normal 3’ flank transduction.
It is important to mention that though annotated only
after exclusion of all other possibilities and two rounds
of check, INDEL annotations per se have relatively
relaxed criteria of the flanks being separated by a maximum of 10000 bases and at least a 1000 base query coverage in case of INDEL_PTS. Given the high repeat
content of the flanks, random matches may not be ruled
out. User discretion is, therefore, advised while dealing
with INDELs and INDEL_PTS in particular.
18 INDELS were reported. Of these, 9 had N-scores
approximately greater than 10 (ranging from ~ 9.22 to
100) or N-stretch at the 3’ end (L1HS_9_1c) of
sequence, resulting in misannotation. TSDs were not
found in the reference genome (checked by blast2
between 500 bp of upstream flank and 2500 bp of
downstream flank) for L1HS_10_9c, 12_8c, 18_9c, 20_2
and 22_2c leaving only two possibilities. The indel
sequences either represent the sequences deleted during
L1 insertion in human or the intervening sequence

of the unmatched portion of the downstream flank, RISCI annotates
the locus as INDEL_PAC or INDEL_PTS.

between two L1s which recombine to form the present
L1 in the main genome. In comparison with Celera and
HuRef genomes, L1HS_18_9c was definitively identified
as M_INTER_RMD (recombined L1 in the main genome). The fact that the intervening sequence in Celera
and HuRef genomes showed high similarity with the
INDEL sequence in the chimpanzee genome unambiguously suggests that this sequence is ancestral to human
specific L1 insertions and the subsequent recombination.
The other four loci were either non differential (OCCUPIED) in Celera and HuRef genomes or had high Nscores and hence cannot be definitively classified as
insertion-mediated deletions.
TSDs were identified in the reference genome (checked
by blast2 as above) for L1HS4_3c, 4_19c, 7_7 and 10_1
immediately before and after the transposon. Intriguingly
though, both L1HS_4_19c and 7_7 were annotated as
INDEL_PTS by RISCI and the flank transductions were
confirmed (Table 2). This might just be coincidental.
However, the fact that the only blast hit in chimpanzee
corresponds to the source locus chromosome in the

certain amount of sequence information at the orthologous locus is
missing and substituted by approximate number of Ns, only partial

human genome and that the sequence carries a poly
A-stretch for which no match is found at the source
locus in both human and chimpanzee genomes unambiguously links the transposition of this sequence with
the preceding L1HS. This is suggestive of an insertionmediated deletion mechanism with duplication of the target site in the main genome. It is important to note here
that both L1HS4_19c and L1HS7_7 are insertions into
intronic region of genes HSD17B11 (alias DHRS8) and
AUTS2 respectively.
Inferences based on comparisons with Celera and HuRef
genomes

In contrast to the chimpanzee genome, 217 loci in the
Celera and 171 in the HuRef genome were annotated as
OCCUPIED. Among these, 149 loci were commonly
occupied in all 3 human genomes representing the more
ancestral or fixed loci. 57 Of these were insertions into
genes. Though not informative for phylogenetic studies,
some of these may have evolutionary significance. TSDs
were identified for 39 elements in Celera and 38 in
HuRef assembly comparisons (Table 1). These represent
recent and, therefore, polymorphic insertions in the
human genome, amenable to phylogenetic studies. Of
these, 27 in Celera and 25 in HuRef were canonical
insertions in the reference human genome, 9 in Celera
and 10 in HuRef had misannotated poly A tails (PAC)
and 3 each were annotated as PTS (3’ flank transduction). All the 3 PTS in Celera and 2 in HuRef were

RISCI confirmation of 3’ flank transduction concurrent with insertion mediated deletion (INDEL_PTS) by unambiguous identification of the source locus in main
and comparative genomes. As expected, no hit is found for the target locus in the comparative genome, and one to one chromosomal correspondence for the
source locus in main and comparative genome is noticed. Also the source locus hit both in the main genome and in the comparative genome is shorter than
the target hit since no match is found for the poly A tail at the source locus. CHR - chromosome, ORIENT - orientation, QFC - Query first coordinate, QLC - Query
last coordinate, SFC - Subject first coordinate, SLC - Subject last coordinate. Source loci found within genes (and within exons or introns if CDS coordinates are

confirmed by RISCI. As mentioned in comparison with
chimpanzee (Additional file 2), X_9c in HuRef has
A-score (0.61) close to the threshold (0.65). 5’ flank
transduction was predicted for L1HS _1_5c, 4_35 and
15_1c both in Celera and HuRef, and the source locus
was unambiguously identified for L1HS_15_1c both in
Celera and HuRef (Additional file 3). Multiple hits were
obtained for the other two, both in reference and comparative genomes.
7 C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD were reported
in comparison with the Celera genome, of which
L1HS_18_9c is M_INTER_RMD, with full length L1s at
the 5’ and 3’ end at the orthologous locus in both Celera
and HuRef resulting in loss of 13.8 kb of sequence (6 kb
L1HS and 7.8 kb of intervening sequence). Additional
L1 sequence was found at the 5’ end of L1HS_1_6
(N-score - 0.3) and 3’ end of L1HS_11_6 (N-score -0).
These may be true insertions into pre-existing
repeats. Others had very high N-scores. Of the 12
C_INTER_RMD reported, only 5 had N-score < 10, 3 of
which had Ns either at the 5’ or 3’ end of the sequence.
For the remaining 2 (L1HS_5_15 and 16_2C), Ns were
strategically located at the 3’ (L1HS_5_15) or 5’
(L1HS_16_2c) end of partial L1 sequence, followed by
partial duplication of the upstream (L1HS_5_15) or
downstream (L1HS_16_2c) sequence in the ortholog,
clearly suggesting errors in assembly. 15 C_INT
RA_RMD were reported in Celera genome. 4 had
N-score less than 10, and two of these (L1HS_2_16 and
L1HS_6_2) were less than 5000 bases (full length L1 is
6 kb) and may represent true intra element recombination. 8 INDELS are reported in comparison with Celera
genome. Only 1 had low N-score (0) and represents an
occupied locus misannotated as INDEL because of partial match for the 3’ repeat overhang.
43 C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD were reported by
RISCI in the HuRef assembly. L1HS_18_9c (N-score
1.1), as mentioned earlier, is a recombined L1 in the

human genome with clear full length L1s at either end.
All others, except L1HS_11_6, appear to be a consequence of assembly errors. Even when the N-scores
were lower than 0.5 (L1HS_ 1_3, 1_18c, 1_25c, 4_27,
5_18c, 5_23c, 6_7, 7_1, 13_7c, 16_2c, 16_4c and 17_1),
no non L1 sequence was reported by RepeatMasker and
there was a distinct overlap in the L1 sequence before
and after the N-stretch pointing to problems in assembly. L1HS_11_6 appears to have been disrupted by
insertion of a truncated L1 sequence in the opposite
orientation.
11 C_INTER_RMD are reported in HuRef. 8 Of these
had N-scores > 10 or N-stretch at the 5’ or 3’ end of
the retrieved sequence. As in the Celera assembly, the
N-stretch is placed next to the partial L1HS sequence,
followed by duplication of the upstream sequence in
L1HS_4_4, 5_15 and 10_1, indicating errors in assembly.
24 C_INTRA_RMD were reported in HuRef. Only three
(L1HS_3_13, 7_9 and 11_1) of these were less than 5000
bases, had low N-scores and may possibly be true intra
element recombinations.
13 INDELs were reported in the HuRef assembly. Of
these, 9 either had N-score >10 or had N-stretch at
the 5’ (L1HS_ 8_6c) or 3’ end (L1HS_ 8_5 and 12_9)
of the indel sequence. L1HS_1_2c, 1_11 and 13_8c
represent occupied loci but are classified as INDEL
because of partial or no match for the 3’ repeat overhang, possibly because of the decay of the poly-A tail
or the 3’ target site duplication. L1HS_11_11 presents
an interesting case. In the HuRef genome, it is annotated as 9 bp (N-score 0.0) INDEL with almost full
query coverage for upstream and downstream flanks.
However, in the chimpanzee genome the orthologous
locus is annotated as CAN with a TSD of 18 bp, which
suggests that L1 insertion-mediated deletion of the
ancestral locus did not take place and that the orthologous empty locus in the HuRef genome has undergone
independent changes.

2. Analysis of truncated repeats

Retrotransposons get truncated in several ways e.g. 5’
truncation because of low processivity of reverse transcriptase and competition by RNAse H in LINES, twin
priming [69] resulting in loss of intermediate sequence
and inversion of the 5’ end, looping of m RNA resulting
in loss of intermediate sequence without inversion of
the 5’ end [65] etc. Besides, false truncations may also
result from disruption of the full length insertions. True
truncations and disruptions pose stiff challenges to
repeat detection and annotation programs. The two
parts of a disrupted transposon may frequently get
annotated as different repeats and small truncated
repeats may escape detection or be misannotated [70].
RISCI has special modules for analysis of such repeats.

Page 12 of 25

to 5’ flank transduction (Figure 12). In the final result file
names of the elements of a twin priming event are concatenated and suffixed by “*”. 142, 17 and 24 twin priming
events were identified in the reference human genome
when compared to chimpanzee, Celera and HuRef genomes, respectively. As expected, no twin priming was
reported in AluYa5 comparisons since probability of a
twin priming event is directly proportional to the length
of the template.
It may be noted that since both disruptions and twin
priming events are identified in a secondary screening
based on the primary annotations by RISCI, misannotations are possible if one of the two constituents of a disruption or twin priming event is not annotated to the
same repeat class by RepeatMasker.

a. Defragmentation module

Defragmentation refers to the identification of the constituent parts of a disrupted or partially deleted repeat
in the genome. All disrupted or partially deleted parts of
a parent repeat would be in the same orientation, annotated as independent repeats by RepeatMasker, and the
target site duplication would be located at the first (5’
end) and the last fragment (3’ end) of the disrupted
repeat. If the orthologous locus in the comparative genome is empty, the upstream and downstream flanks for
each fragment would show an overlap in the region of
the single copy of the TSD in the comparative genome
(Figure 11). In case of a parent repeat fragmented into
two, the first half would be annotated as PTS (false
annotation) and the second half as CAN, PAC or PTS
(depending on mobilization of exclusive repeat sequence
or also of the 3’ flank) by RISCI and the two would
share the same TSD (Figure 11). In the final results file,
names of all fragments of a disrupted repeat are concatenated and marked by “!” suffix. As can be seen, the
flank length is crucial to read these signatures and only
small disruptions can be identified in this manner. To
identify large disruptions, blast HSPs of the upstream
flank of a repeat locus, for which no annotation is
assigned by RISCI, are compared with the blast HSPs of
the downstream flanks of all repeat loci in the same
orientation downstream of this locus to check for the
TSD in the comparative genome. RISCI identified 14
repeat disruptions in the reference genome (Additional
file 4) in the analysis of truncated L1HSs (< 6000 basesreference human genome Vs chimpanzee genome).
b. Identifying inversions using RISCI

Owing to twin priming [69], LINE insertion may result in
inversion of the 5’ end sequence and truncated insertions.
In such cases, the 5’ end is in opposite orientation to the
3’ end and each is annotated as a separate repeat by
RepeatMasker. The two repeats share the same TSD (in
opposite orientations) at the orthologous empty locus in
the comparative genome and show an alignment similar

2.1 Truncated L1HS analysis

A total of 1421 truncated L1HS elements (< 6 kb) were
mined by RISCI in the reference human genome by
using the RISCI_RM option (direct parsing of repeat
coordinates from pre-masked files). However, 1421 does
not represent the true number of truncated L1HS elements in the human genome. Twin primed L1HS elements are counted as two despite being the constituent
parts of a single parent. Likewise, disrupted L1HS elements are also counted twice. On the other hand, some
of the truncated L1HS elements may escape detection
or may be misannotated as L1HS. Unless otherwise stated, the inferences refer to the transposon locus in the
reference or main (reference human) genome (Table 1,
Additional files 4, 5 and 6).
Inferences based on the orthologous locus in the reference
chimpanzee genome

a) Shared ancestry 274 loci were found to be occupied
at the orthologous loci in chimpanzee. This partly
reflects the problem of truncated repeat misannotation,
as also the fact that L1 insertions may not be truly
human-specific. Most repeat annotation programs rely
on homology to consensus sequences and characteristic
nucleotides substitutions to classify a given repeat into a
particular class and subclass. However, in the case of
truncated repeats the quality of annotation is compromised for lack of sequence information, frequently leading to misannotation. This becomes strikingly evident in
the case of twin priming and repeat disruption events,
where constituent parts of the same repeat are assigned
to different subclasses.
b) Post insertion changes Both recombination and disruptions were reported by RISCI. The details may be
referred to in Additional files 1 and 2. 16 C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD events were inferred on the basis
of alignments obtained at the orthologous loci in
chimpanzee. Since the RepeatMasker files for both reference human and reference chimpanzee genomes were

Figure 11 Alignment signatures for defragmentation by RISCI. The original repeat is disrupted into R1 and R2 due to insertion of an
exogenous sequence (brown bold line). Blastn alignments for R1 and R2 at the orthologous empty locus in the comparative genome are
shown. Query 2 of R1 (Query2 R1), starting from R1 and downstream, consists of the 50 base overhang into the 3’ end of R1, the exogenous
sequence (brown line), R2, 3’ target site duplication and its downstream flank, of which, only the TSD and its downstream flank find a match at
the orthologous empty locus (parallel lines) resulting in PTS annotation for R1. For R2, starting from R2 upstream, Query 1 (Query1 R2) consists of
50 bp overhang into 5’ end of R2, the exogenous insertion, R1, 5’ TSD and its upstream flank, of which only the TSD and its upstream flank find
a match at the orthologous empty locus (parallel lines). RISCI annotation of R2 depends on the nature of the original transposition event and
RepeatMasker estimation of the 3’ end of repeat (CAN, PAC or PTS). The flank length is crucial in indentifying such events and must be long
enough to span the exogenous sequence, R1 or R2 and their respective flanks. From left to right - pink line - 5’ flank of the original repeat

available, we pulled out the repeat annotations for the
locus and its flank in the human genome and the identified ortholog and flanks in the chimpanzee genome to
confirm recombination (Additional file 1). For example,
Y_31c represents a perfect case of inter element recombination in the human (reference or main) genome
(M_INTER_RMD) and preservation of the ancestral
locus in chimpanzee. The orthologous locus in chimpanzee has no Ns and partially homologous sequences
at the 5’ and 3’ ends (Figure 13, Additional file 2). The

recombination between the two results in loss of 11,354
bases in the human genome.
N-scores ranging from 0.36 to 8.11 were found for
the remaining 11 loci. L1HS_1_28, 1_40, 8_35,
9_25, 11_17c, 14_35 and 18_38 also represent
M_INTER_RMD. In each of the above cases, stretches
homologous to the repeat locus in the reference genome
were present at 5’ and 3’ ends of the identified ortholog,
and recombination resulted in the loss of one copy
equivalent of the homologous sequence and the

Figure 12 Alignment signatures for twin priming. Twin priming results in inversion of the 5’ end of L1 (R1) as opposed to its 3’ end (R2), the
arrowheads indicating opposite orientations. Since Query1 R1 and Query2 R1 are in opposite orientation to Query1 R2 and Query2 R2, the
alignment of query sequences at the orthologous empty locus in the comparative genome is in opposite orientations (indicated by opposite
facing brown arrows). Also for Query1 R1, no match is found for 50 base overhang into R1, and the R2 sequence. Similarly, for Query1 R2, no
match is found for 50 base overhang into R2, and the R1 sequence. Since the alignments are in opposite orientations, the TSDs identified are
reverse complements of each other. From left to right - Pink line - 5’ flank of the repeat, blue arrows and lines - target site duplication sequence,

intervening sequence. However, in most of these cases
(except L1HS_9_25 and 18_38) Ns were strategically
located in between the two potential homologous
stretches of L1s in chimpanzee which recombine to
form the lone L1 in the human genome. L1HS 9_25 and
18_38 result from recombination between distant L1s
leading to loss of more than 5 kb of intervening
sequence.
L1HS_11_4 on the other hand represents minor disruption (C_DISRUPTED) of the orthologous locus in
the chimpanzee genome. L1HS_4_84c, 7_73 and 11_4
represent occupied loci in chimpanzee, but are annotated so because of overrepresentation of Ns and misannotation of boundaries by RepeatMasker. L1HS_17_2 is
doubtful. The remaining 4 (L1HS 2_72c, 5_46c, 7_29
and X_63c) had N-scores greater than 10 and were not
considered further.
32 C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED events were
identified in chimpanzee of which 9 (L1HS 1_61, 1_63,

3_17c, 6_19c, 6_41, 7_21, 8_19, 16_16c and 19_12c)
were found to be true inter element recombination
events in chimpanzee (C_INTER_RMD). On closer
inspection, another 14 loci were found to be disrupted
in the human (reference) genome (M_DISRUPTED),
with only one of the two fragments annotated as L1HS
(except 13_34c and 13_35c). These include L1HS 1_45,
3_7c, 3_57, 4_59, 4_114c, 4_130c, 4_134, 5_54c, 6_38,
6_71, 7_67, 12_31c, 13_34c and 13_35c. Alu element
insertion into the parent L1 was the most common
cause of disruption. Intriguingly, Alu showed preferential insertion around 300 bases starting from the 5’ end
of L1. L1HS_6_38 harbors an SVA insertion. Three
(L1HS 6_56, L1HS 7_52 and 8_32c) of the identified
orthologs had high N-scores. The orthologous loci for
16_11 and X_85 are actually occupied but were annotated so since no contiguous match is found for one of
the two repeat overhangs. The remaining 5 loci,
L1HS2_3c, 3_14c, 14_20 and 16_24 are difficult to

Figure 13 Repeat Masker annotations for the recombined
locus in the human genome and the original non-recombined
ortholog in chimpanzee - Please note that the ortholog in
chimpanzee was identified in the opposite orientation and
should therefore be read in reverse direction when comparing
with the human locus. Loci marked as R1 and R2 (in blue) in
chimpanzee annotation represent the loci that recombine in the
human genome to give rise to the Y_31c locus. The region marked
in red represents the intervening sequence lost in recombination.

explain. L1HS_2_3c may be a result of parallel independent insertions. L1HS_3_14c is annotated as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED in Celera and HuRef
comparisons as well and the separation between the
flanks is identical. There is homologous L1 sequence in
the opposite orientation immediately downstream where
recombination may have taken place in these genomes
to give rise to the present ortholog. The ortholog for
14_20 has N-stretch at its 3’ end, confounding the analysis and, 16_24 locus in the human genome has several
Alus inserted into an L1 cluster. The ortholog in chimpanzee is also similar.
10 orthologs were annotated as C_INRA_RMD.
L1HS_3_24c presents a picture perfect C_INTRA_RMD
event. The identified ortholog has no Ns in the chimpanzee genome. The L1 locus in the human genome is
annotated as

This clearly suggests intra element recombination
resulting in the loss of 3076 bases of L1 sequence in
chimpanzee. Orthologs for L1HS 2_15, 4_51, 10_30c,
14_31, 15_23 and X_45c had low N-scores but the
breakpoint was located in Ns. If the Ns are truly

Page 15 of 25

representative, these represent true intra element
recombination events. L1HS_3_10, X_96 and X_105 had
N-scores > 10 and were discarded.
Another 32 loci were annotated as M_INTRA_RMD
(Intra element recombination mediated deletion in the
reference or main genome). 6 of these had N-score
greater than 10 and were not considered. L1HS_4_5 (Nscore-0) presents a perfect M_INTRA_RMD event. The

human genome is 13409700-13411042 + L1HS LINE/L1 1 1334

This very clearly suggests that the ancestral full length
insertion in the human genome has undergone intra element recombination resulting in loss of intervening
sequence between regions of micro-homology and producing 2 truncated elements, only one of which is annotated as L1HS. Similarly, L1HS_3_118, 3_88c, 4_4c,
4_129, 7_19c, 8_5 and 13_18 have N-scores of 0 and
represent confirmed M_INTRA_RMD loci. L1HS_10_39
and 11_25 represent special cases where the recombined
locus has further undergone disruption in the human
genome, while full length L1 element is conserved in
chimpanzee. Ns were found at the breakpoint for
L1HS_1_13, 1_48, 3_54, 3_83, 9_44, 10_29c, 16_23 and
18_22, confounding the analysis. L1HS_3_20c, 4_52,
5_52, 5_93c, 8_50c and 12_11 are falsely reported as
M_INTRA_RMD and are probably parallel independent
insertions.
c) Inferences based on empty allele at the orthologous
locus TSDs were identified for 763 loci. Among these,
138 were annotated as twin priming events and 12 were
annotated as disruptions. Thus, effectively 613 empty
orthologous loci were found in chimpanzee. These were
further subdivided into three classes based on the position of the 3’ TSD and sequence composition of the
stretch between the annotated 3’ end of L1 and start of
the 3’ TSD.
Canonical transposition
426 (of 613) loci in the reference human genome were
annotated as CAN - exclusive mobilization of the transposon sequence (Figure 5). Another 109 loci were annotated as PAC (Canonical with a misannotated 3’end,
Figure 6).
Non-canonical transposition (3’ flank transduction)
The remaining 78 loci qualified as putative 3’ flank
transduction events and were annotated as PTS (loci
with Putative Transduced Sequence). The source locus
was unambiguously identified for 42 both in the human

Singh and Mishra BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/609

and chimpanzee genomes. The source locus was clearly
identified in the human genome for L1HS_3_80, 11_43
and 15_1 but no matches were found in the chimpanzee
genome. Another 13 loci, (L1HS_1_103, 2_43, 3_26, 5_3,
9_22, 11_11c, 11_34, 12_7, 14_28, 20_19, 21_12, X_50
and X_97), represent twin primed or disrupted L1s in
the human genome for which only one of the two constituents is annotated as L1HS by RepeatMasker, leading
to misannotation by RISCI. For another 4 (L1HS_2_51,
5_61, 8_40 and X_60) matches were not found for one
of the two constituent halves leading to misannotation
by RISCI. The A-score and/or AT-score of L1HS_1_58,
1_75, 1_79, 4_21, 4_93 and 9_45 were very close to the
threshold and represent marginally misannotated poly-A
tails. The PTS was very small for X_84 (20 bases). The
PTS for another 6 (L1HS_1_29, 2_32, 2_45, 4_33, 7_24c,
X_33) was repeat rich preventing identification of the
source locus. The remaining 2 (L1HS_3_39 and 5_22c)
are misannotated as PTS by RISCI. The length of the
confirmed transduced flanks ranged from 30 bp to 2100
bases (Additional file 2).
Insertion-mediated deletion or parallel independent
insertions or insertion-deletions 86 INDELS (43
INDEL_CAN, 14 INDEL_PAC and 28 INDEL_PTS)
were reported. Of the 44 loci annotated as INDEL_CAN, 4 had N-score above 10. Of the remaining 40, for
24 loci (L1HS_1_47, 1_84c, 3_2, 3_5, 4_58c, 5_5c,
5_51c, 5_65c, 7_7c, 7_10, 8_27, 8_41, 8_42c, 8_43c,
10_24, 12_14, 12_27, 15_18, 18_5c, 18_8, 20_3, X_13,
X_72 and X_114), the flanks were separated by less than
50 bases and probably represent insertion-mediated
deletions. Of these, 3, (L1HS_7_7c, 8_41, 8_42c), were
earlier reported by Han et al. L1HS_1_3 is a false positive. L1HS_1_69c is peculiar since the L1 insertion in
chimpanzee is slightly smaller than the insertion in
human suggesting parallel independent insertion post
divergence of human and chimpanzee genomes.
N-stretch at the beginning of the identified ortholog for
L1HS_1_86c confounds its analysis. L1HS_9_31 represents an occupied locus, but is annotated as INDEL_CAN for lack of complete matches for the repeat
overhangs. L1HS_2_55 and 3_53 insertions in the
human genome result in deletion of 385 and 69 bases of
non repeat sequence respectively. L1HS_11_41c actually
represents a recombination event in the human genome
(M_INTER_RMD) but is annotated as INDEL_CAN for
lack of complete match for the 3’ overhang.
L1HS_10_43c has been earlier reported as confirmed L1
insertion-mediated deletion. The identified orthologs for
L1HS_2_83, 3_108, 4_48, 16_25, 22_2c and Y_14c are
repeat rich and could either represent sequences deleted
upon L1 insertion in the human genome or parallel
independent insertions. L1HS_4_74 has very low query
coverage for the 5’ flank and may be a false positive.

Page 16 of 25

L1HS_7_11 also has very low query coverage for the 5’
flank and an N-score ~10 and therefore discarded.
14 orthologs were annotated as INDEL_PAC. Of
these, 2 had N-score > 10 and were not considered
further. Of the remaining 12, 8 (L1HS_2_18c, 3_48,
3_74, 4_37, 5_12, 7_45c, 12_38 and 18_18) had the
flanks separated by not more than 50 bases and most
likely
represent
insertion-mediated
deletion.
L1HS_11_62 and 16_1 (16_1 - also reported as insertion-mediated deletion earlier by Han et al.) have RISCI
score of 100 and almost full query coverage and represent insertion-mediated deletions. L1HS_7_47 and 8_21c
have low RISCI score and are doubtful.
28 loci were annotated as INDEL_PTS by RISCI. Of
these, 15 had N-scores lower than or equal to 10. Most
of the transduced sequence is repetitive in nature and
could not be traced to the source locus.
Inferences based on comparisons with Celera and HuRef
genome

In contrast to the chimpanzee genome, 1227 loci in the
Celera and 1174 in the HuRef genome were annotated
as OCCUPIED (Additional file 4). Among these, 1107
loci were commonly occupied in all 3 human genomes
representing the more ancestral or fixed loci. Of these,
382 were inserted in genes.
8 C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD were reported in
comparison with Celera genome. Of these, 4 have
N-score below 10, 3 of which (L1HS 4_117c, 8_26 and
11_41c) are true inter-element recombination in the
human genome. The recombining L1s were separated
by 437 and 1216 bases in L1HS_8_26 and 11_41c
respectively, and adjacent to each other in L1HS_
4_117c. L1HS_2_42 represents a minor disruption of the
parent repeat (C_DISRUPTED) in the Celera genome.
Of the 13 C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED reported, 9
had N-score below 10. Of these, 12_41 is a confirmed
inter-element recombination (C_INTER_RMD) in the
Celera genome. L1HS_4_8, 4_9, 18_2c and 18_3c represent disruption in one of the two halves of a twinprimed L1 in the human genome (M_DISRUPTED).
11_30c is actually OCCUPIED but misannotated due to
lack of match for the 3’ repeat overhang. L1HS_3_14c,
4_23c and 7_15c are annotated as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED, but the region of homology
where recombination may have taken place is not apparent. 3 C_INTRA_RMD events identified in Celera have
varying length N-stretch and are possibly assembly
errors. Of the 7 M_INTRA_RMD loci, only one had an
N-score <10 (N-score = 0) and represents true
M_INTRA_RMD event (Additional files 4, 5 and 6).
11 C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD were reported by
RISCI in the HuRef assembly 5 of which had N-scores
less than 10 (Additional files 1 and 2). Of these
L1HS_2_41, 9_49c, 14_20 and 18_5c represent inter

Singh and Mishra BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/609

element recombination in the human genome.
L1HS_11_57 is doubtful. 1 C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED are reported in HuRef assembly. Of these, 5
had N-score > 10. Of the remaining 16, 6 (L1HS_4_29,
5_80, 5_97, 18_12c, 20_16c and Y_19) had Ns at the 5’
or the 3’ end of the identified ortholog. These are most
likely to be OCCUPIED loci but annotated so for lack
of match to one of the repeat overhangs due to Ns.
L1HS_11_30c is also OCCUPIED but misannotated.
L1HS_1_63 represents inter element recombination in
the HuRef genome. L1HS_2_49c, 2_50c, 4_8, 4_9,
13_34c, 18_2c and 18_3c represent disruptions in the
main genome (M_DISRUPTED). L1HS_3_14, as mentioned earlier, is annotated as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED in all the three comparative genomes.
However, the region of homology where recombination
takes place is not apparent. 12 C_INTRA_RMDs were
reported in HuRef. 7 had low N-scores. Of these, the
orthologs for L1HS_10_25 and 13_20 have low N-scores
and differ considerably from reference human insertion
and may represent true intra element recombination in
HuRef. Of the 36 reported M_INTRA_RMD events,
only 6 had N-score less than 10. L1HS_2_51c, 5_93c
and 8_5 represent true M_INTRA_RMD events.
A longer length L1 was found at the orthologous locus
in HuRef for each of these and the L1 sequence from
the main genome matched perfectly either to the 5’ or
the 3’ end of ortholog.
TSDs were identified for 90 elements in Celera and
112 in comparison with HuRef assembly. These represent recent and, therefore, polymorphic insertions in the
human genome, amenable to phylogenetic studies. Of
these, 62 in Celera and 76 in HuRef comparisons were
canonical insertions in the reference human genome, 16
in Celera and 22 in HuRef had misannotated poly A
tails (PAC) and 12 loci in Celera and 14 in HuRef were
annotated as PTS (3’ flank transduction). The source
locus in the reference genome and comparative genomes
was unambiguously identified for 6 (L1HS_10_28,
18_12c, 4_92, 5_74, 7_32 and X_113) loci in Celera and
5 (L1HS_4_92, 5_74, 6_12c, 7_32 and 4_83) in HuRef
(Additional file 2). The PTS sequence for others was
repeat-rich, preventing identification of the source locus.
9 INDELS were reported in comparison with the Celera
genome. 5 had N-scores less than ten. Of the 3 loci annotated as INDEL_CAN or INDEL_PAC, L1HS_4_37
(annotated as INDEL_CAN in Chimpanzee and HuRef as
well) and X_72 represent insertion mediated deletions.
The ortholog identified for L1HS_5_93c has Ns at the
beginning of the sequence confounding the analysis. Of
the 6 loci annotated as INDEL_PTS, 2 had N-score < 10.
L1HS_6_12c was found to true and the source locus for
the PTS was also unambiguously identified. L1HS_12_42
may be false positive. 11 INDELS were reported in the

Page 17 of 25

HuRef assembly. Of these, 6 had N-score below 10.
Three of the remaining 5 loci (L1HS_9_31, X_45c and
Y_9) have Ns either in the beginning or end of the ortholog sequence. L1HS_4_37 represents insertion-mediated
deletion. Y_30c is a false positive.
17 twin-priming events and 1 disruption were identified in Celera comparisons since most loci are nondifferential. 24 twin priming events and 1 disruption were
identified in HuRef genome.
3. Analysis of AluYa5 retrotransposons

A total of 4056 (full length and truncated) AluYa5 elements were mined by RISCI in the reference human
genome by using the RISCI_RM (direct parsing of
repeat coordinates from pre-masked files) option. Using
an arbitrary threshold of 285 bases, 3418 qualified as
full length and 638 as truncated. 1594 of all Alus were
inserted into genes in the reference human genome (5’
UTR or intronic). Unless otherwise stated, the inferences refer to the transposon locus in the reference
(reference human) genome (Table 1, Additional files 7,
8, 9 and 10).
Inferences based on the orthologous locus in the reference
chimpanzee genome

a) Shared ancestry 314 loci were found to be occupied
at the orthologous loci in chimpanzee.
b) Post insertion changes 5 loci were annotated as
C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD. Of these, 2 (Alu_1_38
and X_18c) had N-scores > 10 and were not considered
further. Of the remaining 3, 2 (Alu_6_210 and 16_96c)
were confirmed as M_INTER_RMD, while Alu_17_2
represents a truncated insertion in human and full
length insertion in chimpanzee. A recombination
between Alu monomers may be responsible for this
situation. 90 C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED events
were identified in chimpanzee. Of these, 72 were found
to be true inter-element recombination (C_INTER
_RMD) events in chimpanzee (Additinal files 3, 4).
Another 8 (AluYa5_5_145c, 6_27c, 6_226c, 11_160c,
17_5, 20_69, 22_19, 22_31 were found to be OCCUPIED
but were annotated so for lack of almost perfect match
for the repeat overhangs. AluYa5_2_250 has Ns at the
beginning of the identified ortholog and hence misannotated. It too is likely to be occupied. The remaining 7
(7_95c, 15_89, 17_100, 17_105, 19_57, 20_26, 7_95) are
doubtful. As expected, no C_INTRA_RMD event was
identified. M_INTRA_RMD option was inactivated for
this run.
Inferences based on empty allele at the orthologous
locus TSDs were identified for 3209 loci, of which 3132
loci were annotated as CAN, 54 as PAC and 23 as PTS.
However, all 23 predicted transduced sequences were
either repeat rich or were too small to facilitate identification of source locus (Additional file 5).

Singh and Mishra BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/609

Insertion-mediated deletion or parallel independent
insertions or insertion-deletions 267 loci (164 INDEL_CAN, 7 INDEL_PAC and 96 INDEL_PTS) were annotated as INDELS. Of the 171 INDEL_CAN or
INDEL_PAC, 132 had N-score less than 10. At least 60
of these (marked in blue) appear to be insertionmediated deletions. Another 13 are recombinationmediated deletions, misannotated as INDEL_CAN for
lack of match for the repeat overhang (marked in red or
brown) (Additional files 7, 8 and 9). Of the 96 loci
annotated as INDEL_PTS, 34 had N-score less than 10.
As mentioned earlier, we advise user discretion while
dealing with INDEL_PTS. Most of these may result
from RISCI trudging into loci that are not truly orthologous for lack of sequence (substituted by Ns) at the
actual orthologous locus.
Inferences based on comparisons with Celera and HuRef
genomes

In contrast to the chimpanzee genome, 3530 and 3335
loci were found to be OCCUPIED in Celera and HuRef
genomes respectively (Additional file 7).
9 loci in Celera and 6 in HuRef were annotated as
C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD. All 8 orthologous loci
in Celera (N-score < 10) and 4 in HuRef (N-score < 10)
had homologous Alu sequences at the 5’ and the 3’ end,
confirming inter-element recombination in the human
genome. 22 in Celera and 74 in HuRef were annotated
as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED. Of these, 13 in
Celera had N-score < 10. Of these, 2 (AluYa5_3_94c
and 18_41c) had Ns at the beginning or end of the identified ortholog. Of the remaining 11, 7 were confirmed
as C_INTER_RMD. Other 3, AluYa5_2_181, 6_204 and
22_19, were found to be occupied. AluYa5_5_222c is
doubtful. Of the 74 loci in HuRef, 46 had N-scores <10.
Of these 46, 29 had Ns at the beginning or end of the
identified ortholog sequence and are likely to be occupied in HuRef. AluYa5_2_67c, 8_19, 9_172c, 16_26,
16_67, 17_48 and 19_28 are true inter Alu recombinations in the HuRef genome. The orthologous locus identified for AluYa5_16_26, 16_28c, 16_37 and 16_38 was
the same. 6 loci were found to be OCCUPIED but missannotaed as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED for lack
of match for one of the repeat overhangs.
330 (326 CAN, 2 PAC and 2 PTS) loci in Celera and
428 (420 CAN, 4 PAC and 4 PTS) in HuRef were found
to be empty. 59 INDELS (34 INDEL_CAN, 1 INDEL_PAC and 24 INDEL_PTS) were reported in Celera genome. 19 of these had N-scores less than 10. Of these, 4
(AluYa5 3_54, 4_120c, 11_26 and X_7) had Ns at either
the beginning or the end of the identified ortholog confounding the analysis. AluYa5 2_322c (10 bp), 4_245
(913 bp), 8_149 (3 bp), 15_74 (25 bp) and X_75 (1966
bp), represent insertion-mediated deletions. The orthologs for Alu_4_194c and 14_98c have full length Alu

Page 18 of 25

sequence at the 5’ end followed by non Alu sequence
suggesting gene conversion, while 6_52 represents parallel insertion of LTR sequence Alu_2_59 possibly results
from recombination between Alu monomers. 132 (79
INDEL_CAN and 53 INDEL_PTS) in HuRef were
reported. 33 of these had N-score less than 10. Of these,
AluYa5_2_59, 2_322c, 4_194c, 4_245, 6_52, 8_149,
14_98c and 15_74 are exactly similar to Celera orthologs
as described above. Another 7 (AluYa5_1_313, 5_10,
10_109c, 13_23, 14_100, 20_71c and X_4) had Ns either
in the beginning or end of the ortholog sequence leading to misannotation.
Novel polymorphism

A total of 45 polymorphic sites were identified in comparison with the Celera and HuRef assemblies. Of these
32 were common to both Celera and HuRef, while for
others the orthologous locus was empty either in Celera
or HuRef assembly. To ascertain how many of the 45
polymorphisms were novel, we cross checked with the
L1 insertion polymorphism data in dbRIP by using its
recently incorporated ‘Position mapping’ utility [71]. Of
the 45 polymorphic sites reported, 14 did not find a
match in the dbRIP recently updated data and are novel
(Table 3, Additional files 11 and 12). Of these, 9 had
RISCI score of 100 (unique ortholog identified). Likewise, for truncated L1HS, of the 113 empty orthologous
loci either in Celera or HuRef or in both, 47 were not
found in dbRIP. 24 of these had RISCI score of 100. Of
the 435 AluYa5 loci for which an empty ortholog was
identified in Celera or HuRef genomes or in both, 140
are not mentioned in dbRIP. All of these had RISCI
score of 100 suggesting unambiguity in identifying the
ortholog (Additional file 12). The polymorphic sites
essentially represent insertions in the reference human
genome but absent in Celera or HuRef or in both.

Discussion
Salient features of RISCI

RISCI offers both whole genome as well specific region
analyses. It runs on contig as well as on assembled chromosome sequence, allows multiple genome comparisons, offers three repeat mining utilities (RISCI_RM,
RISCI_NON_RM and RISCI_BLAST, and two filters
‘length’ and ‘gene’ (see materials and methods). Wherever possible, the upstream query sequence is tagged
with a user defined length of non repeat sequence
(default- 500 bp) to avoid spurious hits (see materials
and methods). In most cases this non repeat tag forms a
part of the upstream blast hit used in RISCI annotation
(Additional File 17 Figure S4). RISCI also uses improvised soft masking (see materials and methods) to arrive
at the orthologous locus in the comparative genome.
The blast databases of the genomes are made with the -

o option set to T to enable use of fastacmd so as to
speedily retrieve flank sequence from the reference genome and the ortholog sequence from the comparative
genome. A merger option is also provided so as to
merge BLAST hits in the comparative genome if the
gap between two similarly oriented Blast HSPs is not
greater than the user defined length (default 50 bp) both
in terms of the query and subject coordinates. A scoring
scheme has also been implemented to assign confidence
scores in cases where multiple orthologous loci are predicted (see materials and methods). As mentioned
above, specialized modules to take care of complications
involved in truncated repeat analysis are inbuilt. Confirmation module for flank transduction is also inbuilt in
RISCI. Besides, 3 speed options are inbuilt (Table 4).
Comparison with other tools

To the best of our knowledge, no in silico tool comparable to RISCI is available till date. However, several
experimental strategies to identify potential polymorphic
sites with respect to transposon insertion have been suggested in recent years. These include TGDA (Targeted

Genomic Difference Analysis) [72], diffIR [73], and a
new general approach to identify insertion deletion polymorphisms [74]. Whole genome in silico comparison
strategies have also been used earlier but have been
restricted to specific goals like identifying novel polymorphisms [75,76] or insertion-mediated deletions [65]
or recombination-mediated deletions [77,78]. Bennet et
al made an automated pipeline to identify indel and
transposon polymorphism from sequence traces [79].
Mills et al identified 11000 transposon copied that are
differentially present in the human and chimpanzee genomes [80] (Refer Additional file 13 for comparison of
RISCI data with that of Mills et al). Recently, Xing et al
combined computational and experimental analyses to
identify structural variations in the HuRef genome [81].
As has been mentioned earlier, RISCI is more comprehensive and provides a one-stop platform to identify a
wide array of sequence changes, besides polymorphism,
presenting a more holistic and comparative view of
sequence changes occurring as a consequence of transposon insertions, which may then be examined for their
downstream effects.

For each of the speed options (Fast, Medium and Slow), speed may be further enhanced by selecting for “STOP AT FIRST MATCH (SFM)” as opposed to “ALL
AGAINST ALL COMPARISONS”. SFM option stops further comparisons as soon as the first match conforming to any of the RISCI alignment signatures is found. To
avoid orientation bias, the control shifts between plus and minus hits every 15 hits. The scoring scheme becomes redundant since only one match is allowed,
and hence duplications cannot be identified with SFM option.
Medium speed option with SFM off and merger on is recommended.

RISCI validation

We estimated the accuracy of RISCI indirectly by comparing the TSDs obtained for the same locus in Celera or
HuRef genome with those obtained in chimpanzee for
full length L1HS. Of the 45 polymorphic loci identified in
the human genome (Additional files 11 and 12), TSDs
were predicted for 42 in the chimpanzee genome. Of
these, 33 loci had exactly identical TSDs in the human
and chimpanzee genomes. Of the remaining 9, 4 differed
by not more than 2 nucleotides either at the 5’ or the 3’
end (data available on request). Even when there were
large differences in the size of TSD (> 2 bases), the relative query coverage was almost similar. Given that the
human and chimpanzee diverged some 6 million years
ago and have undergone independent evolutionary pressures and consequent changes, the tendency of target site
duplications to decay, as also the possibilities of miniscule errors in the assembly, the accuracy still comes to
approximately 88.09% ((37/42)*100). A similar figure was
obtained for truncated L1HS and AluYa5 analyses. Also,
of the 32 predicted 3’ flank transduction events in the
chimpanzee genome for full length L1HS, the source
locus was unambiguously identified for 23 both in
human and chimpanzee genome and for 28 in the
human genome alone (87.5% accuracy).
We also estimated the accuracy of RISCI by partially
recapitulating the analysis done by Sen et al [46]. The
recombined Alu coordinates (hg16) were picked from this
study and converted to hg18 coordinates using the liftover
utility at the UCSC genome browser. 4 of the converted
coordinates did not harbor an Alu within ±50 bases and
were dropped from the analysis. Of the remaining 488,
Alu start and end coordinates coincided exactly with the
converted hg18 coordinates for 472 loci. Thus, a total of
488 loci were fed into RISCI using the RISCI_NON_RM
module (Repeat coordinates input directly by the user),
1000 base flanks retrieved, and the orthologous locus in
chimpanzee zoomed into using the pan Tro 2.1 assembly
as the blast database (Additional files 14 and 15).
9 identified orthologs were annotated as OCCUPIED of
which 7 were confirmed by comparing the RepeatMasker
annotations of the locus in the human genome and the
orthologous locus in chimpanzee (Additional file 6). These
include AluYa5_7_174c, 7_180, 10_224c, 10_239, 16_350,
19_407 and 20_458c. The match for 3’ flank of
Alu_20_458c is very small (200 bases) and may be a false
positive. Alu_17_353 is actually a recombination event falsely classified as OCCUPIED. No matches were found for
16 loci in the chimpanzee genome (it may be noted that
we have not included the random sequence files in our
blast database for chimpanzee). As expected, of the
remaining 463 loci, a major fraction (398 of 463 - 85.96%)
were annotated as C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD by
RISCI (actually M_INTER_RMD). Another 58 loci were

Page 20 of 25

annotated as INDEL_CAN. Of these 46 actually represent
M_INTER_RMD (Additional file 6), but were annotated as
INDEL_CAN for lack of near complete match for repeat
overhangs (at least 35 of 50 bases). For the remaining 12
INDEL_CAN, the putative regions of homology where
recombination in human takes place resulting in the current status are not apparent. All of the 6 loci annotated as
INDEL_PTS had N-scores > 5 (4 had N-scores > 10) and
were not considered further. 1 orthologous locus was falsely interpreted as C_INTER_RMD_M_DISRUPTED by
RISCI. Thus, a total of 445 (398 M_INTER_RMD,
Alu_17_353 and 46 INDEL_CAN) identified orthologous
loci represent inter Alu recombination in the human genome (445/463 = 96.1%).
To further demonstrate the versatility of RISCI, we
used it for a preliminary analysis of insertion polymorphism of IS element 6110 (DNA transposon) using
Mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv as the reference genome and related strains Mycobacterium tuberculosis
h37ra, cdc1551 and and F11 as comparative genomes.
2000 base of flanks with 50 base overhangs into the
repeat were used to zoom into the orthologous locus in
the comparative genomes (Additional file 16).
RISCI Limitations

Accuracy of RISCI predictions is a function of the
sequence quality of the genomes being compared, as
also of the quality of repeat annotation by RepeatMasker. In the absence of the true orthologous sequence in
the comparative genome, RISCI may trudge to other
loci, given the high repeat content (full length L1HS 52.4%, truncated L1HS - 60.2% and AluYa5 - 51.4% - 5
kb up and downstream) of the flanks. Lack of sequence
information substituted by an estimated number of Ns
is a major spoil sport resulting in misannotations (Figure
10). It may also be noted that results for some loci may
change depending on the speed options selected.
RISCI availability

RISCI may be downloaded from http://www.ccmb.res.in/
rakeshmishra/tools.html (RISCI.tar.gz). It is a collection of
several scripts written in perl v5.8.5 for ia64-linux-threadmulti and is compatible to LINUX OS. A sample of RISCI
run (L1HS.tar.gz) discussed in this paper, may also be
downloaded. RISCI requires a prior installation of the
EMBOSS module, RepeatMasker and BLAST for execution. A detailed help file is available with the package for
assistance of new users and can be accessed at http://
www.ccmb.res.in/rakeshmishra/tools/RISCI_Readme.htm.

Conclusion
The availability of multiple whole genome sequences of
the same and different species presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to compare and infer intra species

Singh and Mishra BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:609

and inter-species structural variations introduced by transposon. We present an automated pipeline to identify fixed
and differential transposon insertions and a wide array of
transposon induced sequence changes in closely related
genomes. We illustrate the utility of the pipeline by comparing the reference human genome with the reference
chimpanzee genome and alternate human assemblies (Celera and HuRef) taking L1HS and AluYa5 as representative
transposons. We also show that though modeled on
LINES, the pipeline is generic and may be applied to most
transposons and any two or more genomes which share
high sequence similarity. We believe that such comparisons, when done on a larger scale may pull out a few critical events which may have seeded the divergence between
the two species under comparison.

a) RISCI_RM

Mines out user defined transposon and the repeat annotation of the upstream and downstream flanks from premasked RepeatMasker files (.out files) of the main
genome.
b) RISCI_BLAST

In case of non availability of the RepeatMasker files of
the main genome, the transposon and its flanks are
mined using repeat specific tag sequences. The tag is
typically an oligonucleotide 18-22 bp long carrying the
repeat specific signatures, preferably towards the 3’
end. This sequence is then Blasted on to the reference
genome. Sufficiently long flanking sequence for exact
matches found in the main genome is retrieved and
RepeatMasked to precisely define the repeat coordinates. The repeat and user defined length of flanks are
then retrieved for blast against the comparative genome(s).
c) RISCI_NON_RM

The user may directly input the repeat coordinates in
the specified format (refer Readme file) using this
option.
Non repeat tagging of upstream flank

The repeat annotation of the upstream flank is parsed
so as to check for the nearest user defined length of
non repeat tag (NRT) starting from the 3’ end. If a non
repeat sequence greater than the NRT is found immediately upstream of the transposon, it is used to query the
comparative genome. Otherwise, the length of nonrepeat sequence between successive repeats is checked
till a non-repeat sequence greater than NRT is found.
This sequence consisting of the non-repeat tag at the 5’
end and the downstream repeat(s) serves as the
upstream query sequence. If the non repeat tag is not
found, the entire sequence is used as upstream query
for Blast against the comparative genome(s) (Additional
file 17 Figure S3).
Blastn database

Nomenclature of the Repeat locus

Each transposon locus in the reference or main genome
is named according to the chromosome on which it is
found as also the order in which it is found. Thus
L1HS_1_1 represents the first annotated L1HS on chromosome 1. A suffix “c’ is added if the transposon is on
the complementary strand.
Repeat Mining utilities

RISCI offers three modules to mine out user defined
transposon and its flanks from the reference or main
genome.

Blast database of main and comparative genomes were
made using the formatdb command -o option set to T.
This enables the use of fastacmd command by RISCI to
retrieve sequences directly from the blast database,
which is faster.
Improvised soft masking

Based on the RepeatMasker coordinates, the retrieved
sequence is soft masked. 50 bases at the 5’ and 3’ end of
each repeat and 500 bases immediately upstream and
downstream of the transposon locus are, however,
encrypted in upper case letters.

Singh and Mishra BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/609

Blastn

Upstream and downstream flanks with 50 base overhangs into the respective ends of the repeat are blasted
separately against the comparative genome and the blast
results summarized into the following heads - element,
contig, chromosome, orientation, query first coordinate
(QFC), query last coordinate (QLC), subject first coordinate (SFC) and subject last coordinate (SLC). If no
match is found in the first round of Blastn, a second
round of blast is done with the - U option activated.
This enforces masking of sequence in lower case letters
effectively reducing spurious hits. -v option and the
number of hits compared to zoom onto the orthologous
locus depend on the speed option chosen.
Blast HSP parser

For each repeat element, all upstream hits are compared to all downstream hits in the same orientation.
If the upstream and downstream hits are on the same
chromosome, same orientation and the same contig,
and
1. the repeat overhangs align completely and contiguously with the flanks on the comparative genome and
(1) the difference between the upstream SLC and the
downstream SFC is within 100 bp range of the repeat
length in the reference genome, the locus is annotated
as OCCUPIED; (2) the difference is greater than repeat
length +100 and less than 25000, the locus is annotated
as C_DISRUPTED_M_INTER_RMD; (3) the difference
is less than repeatlength-100, the locus is annotated as
C_INTRA_RMD; (4) only one of the repeat overhangs
aligns completely and contiguously with its flank or the
overlap between the hits is equal to or greater than the
length of the repeat overhangs, the locus is annotated as
C_INTER_RMD.
2. [upstream SLC - downstream SFC >-1] (for plus
orientation hits) or [downstream SFC-upstream SLC
>-1] (for minus orientation hits), and less than the maximum TSD size input, the locus is annotated as CAN,
PAC or PTS depending on the QFC of the downstream
flank and the A and AT content of the unmatched
region in the downstream flank. The orthologous locus
is first checked for in the corresponding chromosomal
homologue in the comparative genome. In case no
match is found, the orthologous locus is checked for
TSD on other chromosomes as well.
If no matches corresponding to shared ancestry, post
insertion changes and empty orthologous loci are found
in the first round of comparison, another round of comparison with Blast option - U activated, facilitating lower
case filtering of FASTA sequences, is performed before
checking for INDELS.
3. the difference between the upstream SLC and
downstream SFC is less than 10,000 bp, and the repeat

Page 22 of 25

overhangs are not contiguous with the flanks the locus
is annotated as “INDEL”. For each of the above RISCI
annotations, both upstream and downstream matches
should be greater than 99 bases and at least one of
them should be greater than 500 bases.
RISCI score (R-score)

If only one locus in the comparative genome satisfies
RISCI annotation conditions, it is allotted a default
score of 100. In case of multiple RISCI matches, the
default score for each match is 50 and is incremented
by 1/2 of the percentage of query match length/total
query length. Match with maximum score is then picked
up as final RISCI hit and displayed in the main result
file. Other hits with their respective scores are also written on to a log file for reference. Please note that the
scoring scheme becomes redundant if ‘SFM’ speed
option (refer Table 4) is selected.
Blast HSP merger module

As mentioned, hits not separated by a distance greater
than user defined threshold both in terms of query and
subject coordinates may be merged by selecting for the
merger option. The threshold is set at 50 but can also
be defined by the user.
Speed optimization

Several speed optimization strategies have been implemented so as make RISCI faster without compromising
significantly on the sensitivity. ‘fastacmd’ command
was used to directly retrieve sequences from reference
and comparative genomes from respective blast databases. Where ever possible, the upstream query
sequence is tagged with a non repeat tag effectively
making the upstream query sequence shorter and
reducing the number of spurious hits. Since a repeat
overhang of 50 bp is integral to both upstream and
downstream flanks, while summarizing the blast file,
only hits > 52 bases are picked up to void hits to the
repeat overhangs alone. In blastn, the -v option is varied according to the speed option selected. This
reduces the number of blast hits for comparison in
case of repeat-rich flanks.
