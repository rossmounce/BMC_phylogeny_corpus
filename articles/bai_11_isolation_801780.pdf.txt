Abstract
Background: Nodaviridae is a family of non-enveloped isometric viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA
genomes. The Nodaviridae family consists of two genera: alpha- and beta-nodavirus. Alphanodaviruses usually
infect insect cells. Some commercially available insect cell lines have been latently infected by Alphanodaviruses.
Results: A non-enveloped small virus of approximately 30 nm in diameter was discovered co-existing with a
recombinant Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) in Hz-AM1 cells. Genome sequencing and
phylogenetic assays indicate that this novel virus belongs to the genus of alphanodavirus in the family Nodaviridae
and was designated HzNV. HzNV possesses a RNA genome that contains two segments. RNA1 is 3038 nt long and
encodes a 110 kDa viral protein termed protein A. The 1404 nt long RNA2 encodes a 44 kDa protein, which
exhibits a high homology with coat protein precursors of other alphanodaviruses. HzNV virions were located in the
cytoplasm, in association with cytoplasmic membrane structures. The host susceptibility test demonstrated that
HzNV was able to infect various cell lines ranging from insect cells to mammalian cells. However, only Hz-AM1
appeared to be fully permissive for HzNV, as the mature viral coat protein essential for HzNV particle formation was
limited to Hz-AM1 cells.
Conclusion: A novel alphanodavirus, which is 30 nm in diameter and with a limited host range, was discovered in
Hz-AM1 cells.
Keywords: Alphanodavirus, HzNV, Hz-AM1, Host susceptibility

Background
Nodaviridae is a family of non-enveloped isometric
viruses with a bipartite positive-sense RNA genome [1].
The Nodaviridae family has two genera: alphanodavirus,
originally isolated from insects, and betanodavirus, one
of the causal agents of mortality in cultured marine fish
species worldwide [2,3]. In addition, an unclassified
nodavirus, Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus, has
been isolated from M. rosenbergii, which is a giant freshwater prawn [4].
Nodavirus particles range from 29 to 35 nm in diameter
and consist of two segments of single-stranded RNA that
are co-packaged into one virion [5]. RNA1, which is
approximately 3.1 kb, translates a protein termed protein
A that consists of multiple functional domains: a mitochondrial targeting domain, a transmembrane domain

[6,7], an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain
[8], a self-interaction domain [9], and an RNA capping
domain [10]. In addition, RNA1 encodes a subgenomic
RNA3 that translates protein B2, an RNA silencing inhibitor [11-14]. RNA2 encodes protein a, a viral capsid protein precursor, which is auto-cleaved into two mature
proteins, a 38 kDa b protein and a 5 kDa g protein, at a
conserved Asn/Ala site during virus assembly [15].
Alphanodavirus TNCL (Tn5 cell line virus) have been
shown previously to latently infect a commercially available Hi5 cell line, with the viral coat protein induced by
the presence of recombinant baculoviruses [16]. In this
report, an unidentified non-enveloped small virus of
about 30 nm in diameter was discovered in Hz-AM1
cells co-existing with the recombinant Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) [17]. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic assays indicate that
this unidentified virus belongs to the alphanodavirus
genus and has been designated HzNV (Hz-AM1 derived
nodavirus).

Methods
Cell culture and virus infection

Insect cell lines Hz-AM1 [18] and Sf9 [19] were maintained in Grace’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) at 27°C.
Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS at 37°C. Cotton Bollworm (H. armigera) larvae were grown and infected with
recombinant HearNPV as previously described [20].
Fresh cells grown in monolayer were infected with
either virus stock (including H. armigera hemolymph or
purified virus stock) or mock virus. The viral supernatant was removed after a 2 h incubation to allow virus
attachment and entry into host cells. The infected cells
were then rinsed twice with serum-free medium and
replenished with complete medium to support cell
growth and virus replication.
Virus purification

The hemolymph of recombinant HearNPV-infected H.
armigera larvae were used to infect fresh Hz-AM1 cells (1
× 108). At 7 dpi, the viral supernatant was harvested and
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris.
The pre-cleared supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 ×
g for 2.5 h at 4°C with a 20% (w/w) sucrose cushion, and
the subsequent precipitates were resuspended in 200 μl
0.1 M TE buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH =
7.6). The enriched virus stock was further purified using
either a continuous sucrose gradient or CsCl centrifugation. For sucrose-based purification, virus stock was laid
on top of a 10% to 50% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient
and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The banded
virus particles were collected and resuspended in 0.1 M
TE buffer. For CsCl gradient centrifugation, 2.1 g CsCl
was dissolved in 4.5 ml virus stock and centrifuged at
32,000 rpm for 24 h at 10°C with an SW55 rotor. The
banded virus was collected and enriched by 32,000 rpm
for 3 h at 4°C with an SW40 rotor. The resultant precipitates were dissolved in 0.1 M TE buffer.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

Fresh Hz-AM1 cells (1 × 106) were infected with either
hemolymph from H. armigera larvae bearing recombinant HearNPV or purified virus stock, and harvested at
72 hpi. The infected cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 3 h at 4°C, and further treated with 1% osmic
acid for 2 h. The samples were dehydrated and embedded
in Epon Ultra-thin sections, were taken and stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
For negative staining, purified virions were attached
onto a carbon-coated grid for 5 min at room temperature. The grid was rinsed with distilled water and stained
with 1% phosphotungstic acid for 3 min before air drying
on filter paper.

All the specimens were viewed using a Tecnai G2
transmission electron microscopy at 75 kV.
Western blot assay

Cell lysates containing 20 μg of total protein from virus
infected cells were separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) by electrophoresis and subjected to western blot assay. The proteins
were transferred to a membrane that was blocked in 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA, Merck) for 1 h at room
temperature and incubated with the anti-TNCL coat
protein IgG (Provided by Dr. Tian-Cheng Li, National
Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) or anti-ERK
(CST) overnight at 4°C, followed by extensively washing
with TBST (50 mM Tris.HCl, pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated
with the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature before
being developed with West Pico ECL reagent (Pierce).
Viral gene amplification and full-length genome cloning

The virus genome was extracted from the purified virus
stock using the TIANamp virus DNA/RNA Kit (Tiangen
Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
viral genome was reverse transcribed using 200 units of
M-MLV (Promega) in a 20 μl reaction volume with the
anchored random primer (5’-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTCNNNNNN-3’) at 37°C for 1 h to generate a
viral cDNA pool. Double-stranded DNA was synthesized
at 37°C for 30 min in the 20 μl reverse transcription
reaction by adding 3 μl Klenow fragment buffer, 10
pmol of universal primer-dN6 and 8 units of Klenow
fragment (Promega). Random PCR was conducted in a
50 μl volume containing 10 μl PCR buffer, 1 mM
MgSO4, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 20 pmol anchor primer
(5’-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTC-3’), 1 unit of KODplus DNA polymerase (Toyobo), and 2 μl doublestranded DNA. The reaction was performed for 40
cycles of 94°C/30 s, 54°C/30 s, 68°C/2 min followed by
incubation for 10 min at 68°C. The final PCR products
were extracted, cloned into pGEM-Teasy vectors (Promega), and submitted for sequencing.
The full-length viral genome was cloned by RACE,
using the sequenced viral gene fragments acquired from
the previous cloning step. The RACE experiment was
performed using the 3’ and 5’ RACE System (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Host susceptibility assay

Hz-AM1, Sf9, and BHK were infected with equal aliquots of either virus stock or mock-virus. The infected
cells were harvested at 6 dpi. Total RNAs were extracted
by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, and 2 μg of total RNA from

each sample were used as the template for reverse transcription with M-MLV (Promega) and random primers.
The subsequent cDNAs of each sample were amplified
by PCR with primer BH4-F (5’-GGAAAGTACCCATCCAGATGTCCAC-3’) and BH4-R (5’-CGTGGCGTTGG
GAGTGGGG-3’), which covered a 413-nt fragment of
the sequenced viral genome. The PCR products were
separated by gel electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel.
For the western blot assay, samples from the infected
cells were treated as described previously.
Bioinformatical analysis and sequence accession numbers

The viral nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences
obtained through ORF finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/gorf/) were submitted to BLAST analysis to
retrieve homologous sequences [21]. Based on the
predicted amino acid sequence of the virus coat protein
precursor, MEGA 4.0 software was employed to generate
a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method
with 1000 bootstrap replications [22-24].
The coding sequences of HzNV coat protein precursor
and protein A have been deposited in GenBank under
the accession numbers GU976286 and GU976287.

Results
Viral morphology and phenotype

When the hemolymph of H. armigera larvae, bearing
recombinant HearNPV, were used to infect fresh HzAM1 cells, an array of non-enveloped, small sized and
spherical viral particles were seen in addition to the
expected NPV pathology by electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 1A). These non-baculovirus virions
were predominantly located in the cytoplasm and were
arrayed in a crystal lattice pattern (Figure 1B). TEM
assay of the negatively stained purified viral particles
revealed that the non-enveloped virions exhibited a
mean diameter of 30 nm (Figure 1C). Detailed observation of the Hz-AM1 cells at the early infection stage (2
days post infection (dpi)) showed the virions were
located within membrane-bound spherules in the cytoplasm (Figure 1D).
These morphological features suggest that the unidentified virus possibly belongs to the group of positivestrand RNA viruses that are usually associated with host
cytoplasmic membranes (reviewed in [25]). A nuclease
digestion assay demonstrated that the purified viral genome was hydrolyzed by RNase A, but not by DNase I

(data not shown), suggesting that the unidentified virus
possesses an RNA genome.
Through CsCl gradient centrifugation, the unidentified
virus was enriched at a layer of approximately 1.346 g/
cm3 with respect to density. This finding is similar to
the CsCl buoyant density of the TNCL virus (approximately 1.350 g/cm3) [16].
Identification of HzNV by western blot and RT-PCR
analyses

The morphological and physical characteristics combined
with the knowledge that alphanodavirus can latently
infect insect cells [16] prompted us to perform a western
blot assay to determine whether this unidentified virus
could serologically cross-react with anti-TNCL, which is
an antibody that recognizes the TNCL virus coat protein
[16]. A major band of about 44 kDa, and a minor band of
approximately 40 kDa were detected by western-blot in
the cell lysate of Hz-AM1 cells infected with the purified
virus (Figure 2). In contrast, the mock-infected Hz-AM1
cells exhibited no serological cross-reaction with antiTNCL (Figure 2). This cross-reactivity indicates that the
virus encodes a viral protein that shares sequence homology with the coat protein of alphanodavirus.
To further characterize this virus at the nucleotide
level, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was used to identify the viral gene sequence
information. Random PCR from the viral cDNA pool
produced a smear of bands that were subsequently
extracted and cloned into pGEM-Teasy vectors for
sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed two homologous
fragments of nodavirus according to a BlastX search
[21]; a 447-bp fragment encoding a translated product
with 35% amino acid identity with the Pariacoto virus

Page 4 of 7

protein A (Genbank: NP_620109.1) (data not shown),
and a 454-bp fragment encoding a viral protein with
58% identity with protein a of flock house nodavirus
(FHV, Genbank: NP_689442.1) (data not shown). Therefore, the gene sequencing results and the viral protein
antigenic properties indicates that the unidentified virus
found in the Hz-AM1 cell is a new member of Nodaviridae. We have designated the virus HzNV.
Genomic organization and bioinformatical analysis of
HzNV

Because full-length genome information is essential for
the detailed classification and phylogenetic analysis of
HzNV, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was
performed with sequences identified by RT-PCR to
clone the two full-length HzNV RNA fragments. RNA1
of HzNV is 3038 nt long, contains a 71 nt 5’ Untranslated Region (UTR) and a 15 nt 3’UTR, and could be
computationally translated into a 983-aa protein that
exhibits homology (41%-55%) with protein A from a
variety of nodaviruses (data not shown).
The full-length HzNV RNA2 is 1404 nt and putatively
encodes a 408-aa capsid protein a. This protein shows
homology to various degrees with other members of the
Nodaviridae family, including Black beetle virus (BbV),
Boolarra virus (BoV), Nodamura virus (NoV), and Pariacoto virus (PaV) (Table 1). The predicted molecular
mass of the HzNV capsid protein is 44 kDa, which is
equivalent to the molecular mass of the major band
seen by western blot assay (Figure 2). Analysis of the
predicted amino acid sequence encoded by HzNV RNA
2 revealed conserved protein a cleavage sites located at
363
Asn and 364Ala. If cleavage occurs at these sites, the
resulting protein, protein b, would have a molecular
mass of 40 kDa, which corresponds to the minor band
seen by the western blot assay (Figure 2).
To determine the relationship between HzNV and
other nodaviruses, with respect to evolutionary distance,
a phylogenetic tree was generated by comparing protein
a of HzNV with other nodaviruses. The results indicate

that HzNV is more closely related to alphanodavirus
than to betanodavirus (Figure 3). Within the alphanodavirus clade, HzNV is the closest to the black beetle virus
in the alphanodavirus genera.
Maturation of HzNV coat protein and secretion dynamics
of virions

To characterize the time course of HzNV coat protein
maturation and virus propagation dynamics, a western
blot assay using anti-TNCL antibody was performed at
various time points after infection (Figure 4). The western
blot results demonstrate that the HzNV capsid protein
precursor (44 kDa) can be detected as early as 2 dpi and
was further cleaved into the mature form (40 kDa) from
3 dpi. This finding is consistent with the appearance of
secreted mature capsid protein in the supernatant (Figure
4). This also suggests that de novo synthesized HzNV
particles can be secreted into the medium and that HzAM1 cells are fully permissive for HzNV.
Examination of HzNV latent infection and range of hosts

Nodaviruses reportedly cause unapparent, latent infection
in their hosts and have a relatively wide host range
[16,26-28]. RT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to analyze HzNV latent infection and permissiveness in various cell lines. Using a HzNV-specific primer
set, a 413-bp fragment was found in all the HzNVinfected cell lines including Hz-AM1, Sf9, and BHK, but
it was absent from all un-infected cells. This finding indicates that HzNV is infectious to all the cell lines tested,
and no latent infection existed (Figure 5A). By western
blot assay, viral capsid protein precursor (44 kDa) and

mature form (40 kDa) were only detected in virusinfected Hz-AM1 cells (Figure 5B), indicating that HzNV
can only generate viral structural proteins in Hz-AM1;
no coat protein or de novo viral particles were synthesized in the other cell lines tested even though HzNV
was infectious to these cell lines.
To investigate whether HzNV pre-existed in a natural
host, the hemolymph of healthy H. armigera (baculovirus-free) was used for RT-PCR with HzNV-specific
primers and probed with anti-TNCL. Neither experiment displayed the presence of HzNV (Figure 5A and
5B), which indicates that the origin of HzNV may be
attributed to an accidental contamination of Hz-AM1
cells with HzNV when recombinant HearNPV bacmid
was transfected into Hz-AM1 cells. The HzNV was
further propagated when the contaminated HearNPV
was injected into H. armigera larvae.

Discussion
In this report, a non-enveloped isometric virus approximately 30 nm in diameter was discovered co-existing
with HearNPV in Hz-AM1 cells. The virions were associated with cytoplasmic membrane structures in a manner resembling the subcellular distribution pattern of
positive-stranded RNA viruses (reviewed in [25]). By
virus genome sequencing and bioinformatical analysis,
this novel virus was identified as a new member of
alphanodavirus, and it was designated HzNV.
Genome replication of positive-stranded RNA virus
depends on intracellular membrane structures, e.g.,
equine arteritis virus (EAV) induces endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles [29]; alphavirus
RNA replication factor is located on the cytoplasmic surface of endosomes and lysosomes [30]; and peripheral
vesicles are present in clusters near the surface of the
chloroplast surface in turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV)
infected Chinese cabbage leaves [31]. For nodavirus, FHV
RNA replication factor and de novo synthesized viral
RNA are distributed predominantly within infectioninduced membrane spherules inside the outer mitochondrial membrane with a necked channel connected to the
cytoplasm [32]. In addition to FHV, Atlantic halibut
nodavirus (AHNV), and carnation Italian ringspot virus
(CIRV) all possess a mitochondrial localization signal
(MLS) on protein A that relocates the viral RNA replication factor to mitochondria [33-35].

Page 6 of 7

In our study, HzNV was also associated with amorphous cytoplasmic membrane structures in the early
stage of infection. HzNV protein A was computationally
predicted to localize within mitochondria, suggesting
that the virus-induced membrane structures are possibly
derived from mitochondria. The mature virions formed
crystal arrays in the cytoplasm at the late stage of infection. This finding suggests that the HzNV maturation
process resembles that of Nodamura virus (NoV), which
is a member of the alphanodavirus genus, whose genome replication factor is associated with the mitochondrial membrane and whose virions also form crystal
arrays in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection [36,37].
Nodaviruses often cause unapparent, latent infections
in their hosts and have a relatively wide host range
[16,26-28]. A latent infection of TNCL virus in commercially available Hi5 cells was previously reported [16,26],
in which the TNCL viral genome was detected in fresh
cells, and baculovirus co-infection triggered viral coat
protein expression [16]. In the present study, HzNV is
infectious to Hz-AM1, Sf9, and BHK cells. However,
only Hz-AM1 appeared to be fully permissive to HzNV;
HzNV-infected Hz-AM1 cells harbored viral coat protein, which is the structural protein essential for production of de novo HzNV particles.
Insect cell lines are widely used in baculovirus expression vector systems (BEVS) for production of recombinant protein and virus-like particles frequently used in
vaccine development. Therefore, the latent infection or
accidental contamination of alphanodaviruses such as
the TNCL virus or HzNV should raise the safety concerns about the application of insect cell lines for medical purposes.

Conclusions
A novel alphanodavirus, HzNV, was isolated and characterized. The host susceptibility test indicates that HzAM1 cells are fully permissive for HzNV, although
HzNV is infectious to a variety of cell types ranging
from insect cells to mammalian cells.
