Abstract
Background: Human bocavirus 2(HBoV2) and other human bocavirus species (HBoV, HBoV3, and HBoV4) have
been discovered recently. But the precise phylogenetic relationships among these viruses are not clear yet.
Methods: We collected 632 diarrhea and 162 healthy children in Lanzhou, China. Using PCR, Human bocavirus
(HBoV), HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4 were screened. The partial genes of NS, NP1 and VP, and two nearly complete
sequences of HBoV2 were obtained.
Result: Phylogenetic analysis showed the different genes of HBoV2 strain were homogenous with different
reference strains. HBoV3 may be a recombinant derived from HBoV and HBoV4. We also observed that the VP1 and
VP2 region of HBoV3 is as similar to HBoV2 as to HBoV4.
Conclusions: A single genetic lineage of HBoV2 is circulating in children with and without gastroenteritis in
Lanzhou, China. Current evidence in this study was not enough to support recombination between HBoV2 strains,
and HBoV3 may be a recombinant between HBoV and the common ancestor of HBoV2 and HBoV4.

Background
Human bocavirus (HBoV), HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4
have been discovered recently [1-4]. These viruses
belong to the genus Bocavirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae of the family Parvoridae, among which the human
parvovirus B19 (B19V) is the only known human pathogen [5]. HBoV was detected in respiratory tract samples
in 2005 [1]. In 2009, Kapoor et al. [2] reported a new
bocavirus species, HBoV2, isolated from stool samples
in children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis, and
suggested that recombination between HBoV2 strains
may occurs. Almost simultaneously, Arthur et al. [3]
reported that HBoV3 was detected in stool samples
from children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). In addition, they proposed that HBoV3 is a hybrid of HBoV
and HBoV2. Subsequently these two new viruses were
detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples in

other regions [6-11]. Recently Kapoor et al reported the
discovery of HBoV4 and the detection of recombination
signals between and within bocavirus species [4].
Among these human bocaviruses, HBoV2 had higher
prevalence and genetic diversity in stool samples than
the others [3,8], but the precise phylogenetic relationships among these viruses were not clear yet. Furthermore, the prevalence and genetic feature of HBoV2
were not addressed at children with and without AGE.
In the present study we collected stool samples from
children with and without AGE in Lanzhou, China.
Samples were assayed for the presence of HBoV,
HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4. Partial nucleotide
sequences of the NS, NP1, VP1/2 genes, and two nearly
full-length genome sequences of HBoV2 were obtained.

Patients and methods

Table 1 Primers used in this study

From July 2006 to June 2008 in Lanzhou, China, we collected stool samples from 632 hospitalized children with
diarrhea and 162 asymptomatic children. 3-5 ml stool
was collected from every participant. All subjects were 5
or less years of age. Medical histories were provided by
parents/guardians. The case group included subjects hospitalized for gastroenteritis in the Department of Pediatrics in our institution. Diarrhea was defined as three or
more loose stools in the previous 24 h. Patients were
excluded from the study if stool sample volume was
insufficient for a complete evaluation of viral agents,
stools had blood streaks or pus, or due to the presence of
a co-morbidity. Subjects in the control group had presented to the First Hospital of Lanzhou University Pediatric Primary Care Center for a routine examination and
did not have fever, diarrhea, vomiting, or respiratory illness in the previous 3-week period [12]. Control subjects
received follow-up by telephone and those in whom any
of the aforementioned exclusion criteria were present
during the week after the initial examination were
excluded. A 10% suspension of stool sample was made by
mixing 0.5 g stool with 1.0 mL PBS (pH7.2). Viral RNA
and DNA were extracted from stool suspensions clarified
by centrifugation (1500 × g, 20 min) using a QIAamp®
Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA and DNA were
resuspended in 50 μL water and stored at -70°C.

Detection of HBoV, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4

HBoV was detected using a method described by us previously [13]. HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 were detected
by nested PCR as described by Kapoor et al., in which
primers HBoV2-sf1, HBoV2-sr1, HBoV2-sf2, and
HBoV2-sr2 were used to amplify a 495-nt region within
the ORF of NS1 [2]. PCR-positive samples were confirmed by sequencing.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

To analyze genetic variation in HBoV2, two sets of
nested primers were designed and used to amplify part
of the NP1 and VP1 genes in positive samples (Table 1),
using the NP1-F1 and NP1-R1, and VP1-F1 and VP1-R1
primers in the first round of PCR and the NP1-F2 and
NP1-R2, and VP1-F2 and VP1-R2 in the second. The
reaction mix contained 10 pmol each primer and 2.5
units ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio). After 5 min
at 94°C, 35 cycles of amplification (94°C for 45 s, 50°C
for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min) were performed, followed by a 7 min extension at 72°C. Complete HBoV2
sequences were amplified by using specific PCR and
Genome Walking Kit (TaKaRa code: D316). PCR products were cloned and the plasmid inserts were
sequenced. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid

sequences were compared to entries in the GenBank
database. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 4.1. All NS1, NP1, VP1 partial gene sequences and
nearly full-length genome sequences of HBoV2 except
the termini were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers GU301644-GU301683, HQ153797-HQ153804).
A total of 82 nearly full-length genome sequences of
HBoV, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 were obtained from
GenBank. These were aligned and manually adjusted
using ClustalW and BioEdit. Phylogenetic trees were
determined by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using
the MEGA 4.1 software package. Various nucleotide substitution models were examined and yielded phylogenetic
trees of similar topology; only the Kimura 2-parameter
model trees were described in this report. A bootstrap
resampling (1000 replications) was used to assess the
reliability of individual nodes in each phylogenetic tree.
Recombination Analyses

We detected recombination using the RDP3 package.
Sequences were selected based on their similarity and
then aligned and manually adjusted using ClustalW and
BioEdit. The alignments were scanned by various algorithms implemented in the RDP3 package, followed by
manual refinement. In addition, we performed similarity
plot and bootscanning analyses for potential recombination events using SimPlot 3.5. Genetic Algorithm
Recombination Detection (GARD) methods were also
used to detect recombination and estimate breakpoint
locations. Estimated breakpoints were verified by both
the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test and manually checking
phylogenetic trees for nonrecombinant segments.

Results
Detection of human bocaviruses

In subjects with gastroenteritis, the positive rates of HBoV,
HBoV2 and HBoV3 were 4.3%, 20.4% and 0.9%,

Cheng et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/50

respectively, whilst HBoV4 was not detected. In the control group, HBoV and HBoV2 were detected in 2.5% and
12.3% of subjects; HBoV3 and HBoV4 were not detected.
Phylogenetic analyses of HBoV2

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all of the partial
NS1 gene sequences of case group were closer with the
PK-2255 strain (from Pakistani children, GenBank:
FJ170279) than other strains, with 97.4-99% identity.
Consistently, those of control group had 98-99% identity
with the PK-2255 strain and were also closer with it
than others. The sequences in this study, including case
and control group, had a high identity of 98.5-100%
with each other. The Phylogenetic tree also indicated
that there was no difference in the topological characteristics of HBoV2 between case and control groups
(Figure 1).

Further study indicated that partial NP1 gene
sequences were also similar to those of strain PK-2255
(98-99%), except that four had a high identity to strain
FJ973558 (Figure 2), with >99% sequence identity. Interestingly, the ten HBoV2 partial VP1 gene sequences in
this study were more variable than those of NS1 and
NP1, being only 92.6-97.3% similar to those of strain
PK-2255. Six partial VP1 gene sequences (Figure 3)
were in the same cluster as strain PK-2255 (97.3-98.1%
identity) and the other four sequences clustered with
strain FJ973558 (96.9-97.4% identity). The nearly fulllength genome sequence of LZ53819 generated in this
study (GenBank number: GU301644) was more similar
to strain FJ973558 than to PK-2255 (similarity 97.5%),
but the NS1 gene sequence showed greater similarity to
that of strain PK-2255. Above results suggested that
recombination among HBoV2 genotypes may occur.
While we compared the trees of non-recombinant segments associated with the break points estimated by
GARD, Shimodaira-Hasegawa test showed the topologies of these trees were not significantly different.

Recombination analyses among HBoV, HBoV2, HBoV3,
and HBoV4

The phylogenetic relationships of a total of 82 nearly
full-length genome sequences obtained both from this
study and GenBank were inferred. Based on sequence
identity, we selected alignments of five nearly full-length
genome sequences. Recombinant signals were detected
in all of the HBoV, HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4 genome
sequences, but the signals in HBoV3 was far more significant than those in other bocaviruses. Using RDP3
and SimPlot3.5, it was found that HBoV3 (NC_012564)
was a potential recombinant of HBoV (FJ858259) and
HBoV4 (NC_012729) (Figure 4A, B). The breakpoint
was located near the VP1 start codon. GARD analyses
suggested six possible breakpoints with model average
support over 0.90, including one located 18 bp downstream of the VP1 start codon (Figure 4C). This breakpoint was further examined by constructing
phylogenetic trees of the two nonrecombinant segments
(Figure 4C). While NC_012564 grouped with FJ858259
in the 5’ segment (including NS1 and NP1), it grouped
with NC_012729 in the 3’ segment (consisting of VP1
and VP2), suggesting that HBoV3 is a hybrid of HBoV
and HBoV4. However, the VP1 and VP2 region of

recombination analysis. (A) recombination analysis was conducted
by Similarity plot, (B) recombination of HBoV3 was conducted by
bootscanning analysis, (C) recombination of HBoV3 was conducted
by GARD analysis.

HBoV3 was as similar to HBoV2 (identity 87.0% with
GQ200737 and 88.6% with FJ973560) as it was to
HBoV4 (88.3% to NC_012729).

Discussion
Although the primers used in this study were capable of
detecting HBoV4, no HBoV4 was detected. HBoV2 had
higher prevalence than HBoV and HBoV3 in both case
and control groups, indicating that HBoV2 should be
given more attention than other human bocaviruses.
Given the fact that children in the control group that
were free of symptoms were positive for HBoV and
HBoV2, perhaps bocaviruses are only “passers-by” in
intestinal tract than pathogens of gastroenteritis, or the
control participants had symptomless infection of bocaviruses. This issue is not clear yet and needs more studies to resolve [7,8,13,14]. All of the partial NS1 gene
sequences in this study were closer with the PK-2255
strain (from Pakistani children) than other strains.
There was a high sequence identity of 98.5-100%
between HBoV2 from case and control groups and the

Cheng et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/50

phylogenetic tree also confirmed that there was no difference in the phylogenetic characteristics of them, suggesting that a single genetic lineage of HBoV2 is
circulating in both the gastroenteritis and healthy children in Lanzhou, China. And it also indicated HBoV2
can cause asymptomatic infection in Children.
Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that partial NS1,
NP1, and VP1 gene sequences of HBoV2 were markedly
similar to those of a number of reference strains. This
variability was also reported by Kapoor [2], who postulated that it was due to recombination between HBoV2
strains, as has been reported for animal parvoviruses
[15]. However, when phylogenetic trees of non-recombinant segments associated with breakpoints estimated by
GARD were compared, Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
showed the topologies were not significantly different.
Considering that these sequences exhibit very high identity (more than 95%), this recombination phenomenon
may be mediated by other processes, for example, variation in spatial rate and/or heterotachy. More works are
required to elucidate fully the nature and extent of any
recombination that occurs between HBoV2 strains.
Arthur et al. identified two recombination sites
upstream of the NS1 and VP1/2 genes, using HBoV,
HBoV2, and HBoV3 sequence analyses, and hypothesized that HBoV3 may be a hybrid of HBoV and HBoV2
[3]. Our phylogenetic analyses of HBoV, HBoV2,
HBoV3 and HBoV4 strains confirmed that HBoV3 may
be a hybrid of HBoV and HBoV4. The estimated breakpoint was located at upstream of the VP1 gene.
Although bootscanning analyses and phylogenetic trees
suggested that HBoV3 was a hybrid of HBoV and
HBoV4, the parent strain of the VP1/VP2 region was
still hard to determine. The VP1/VP2 region of HBoV3
was as similar to that of HBoV2 as it was to that of
HBoV4, suggesting that HBoV3 may be a hybrid of
HBoV and the common ancestor of HBoV2 and HBoV4.
According to the ICTVb criteria http://www.ictvdb.org/
Ictv/fs_parvo.htm, isolates with non-structural gene
homologies of less than 95% are defined as a new species
in the bocavirus genus. NS1 sequence variation amongst
HBoV2 clusters was as high as 8%. However, NS1
sequence variation between one HBoV2 cluster and
HBoV4 was only 6%, suggesting that either more than
one HBoV2 cluster exists or that some of these clusters
should in fact be regarded as a separate species. The high
sequence identity, limited sequence data, and unclear
taxonomy rendered the precise phylogenetic relationships
among these human bocaviruses difficult to determine.
The data presented here suggested the potential phylogenetic relationships among the known human bocaviruses. However, many issues remain, including the
nature and extent of recombination between HBoV2
strains, and the precise evolutionary relationships of the

Page 5 of 6

various human bocaviruses. More studies including
more samples from different areas and years are needed
to address them.

Conclusions
In summary, our data suggested that HBoV2 had higher
prevalence than HBoV and HBoV3 in both case and
control groups. A single genetic lineage of HBoV2 is circulating in children with and without gastroenteritis in
Lanzhou, China. Recombination between HBoV2 strains
may occur and HBoV3 may be a hybrid virus, originating from HBoV and the common ancestor of HBoV2
and HBoV4.
