Abstract
Background: Results of phylogenetic analysis are often visualized as phylogenetic trees. Such a tree can typically
only include up to a few hundred sequences. When more than a few thousand sequences are to be included,
analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among them becomes a challenging task. The recent frequent outbreaks
of influenza A viruses have resulted in the rapid accumulation of corresponding genome sequences. Currently,
there are more than 7500 influenza A virus genomes in the database. There are no efficient ways of representing
this huge data set as a whole, thus preventing a further understanding of the diversity of the influenza A virus
genome.
Results: Here we present a new algorithm, “PhyloMap”, which combines ordination, vector quantization, and
phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant representation of a large sequence data set. The use of
PhyloMap on influenza A virus genome sequences reveals the phylogenetic relationships of the internal genes that
cannot be seen when only a subset of sequences are analyzed.
Conclusions: The application of PhyloMap to influenza A virus genome data shows that it is a robust algorithm for
analyzing large sequence data sets. It utilizes the entire data set, minimizes bias, and provides intuitive visualization.
PhyloMap is implemented in JAVA, and the source code is freely available at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/

Background
Phylogenetic trees are commonly used as a visualization
tool [1] to help reveal the relationships among homologous sequences. When the number of sequences is limited,
the relationships can be clearly observed from the tree;
however, when more than a few thousand sequences are
to be included, not only the accuracy of the inferred phylogenetic trees decreases, but it also becomes increasingly
difficult to study the resulting trees and find patterns [2],
and the computational demands of building a huge phylogenetic tree tend to be staggering. Researchers usually
build a tree by sampling a small amount of data rather
than constructing a complete tree using the entire dataset
[3-8]. However, the sampling is generally done according

to the experience of the researcher and is sometimes arbitrary. The conclusions drawn from such trees may be
biased.
Higgins used Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) [9]
to visualize large sequence data sets, which are difficult
to analyze using phylogenetic trees. He showed that
PCoA can be considered complementary to phylogenetic
tree analysis as it does not assume an underlying hierarchical structure in the data. A similar multidimensional
scaling method was used by Smith et al [10] to analyze
the antigenic and genetic evolution of influenza A virus.
Wong et al. [11] used correspondence analysis to show
the codon usage biases of influenza A virus. Ordination
(i.e. displaying a set of data points in two or three dimensions so as to make the relationships among the points in
higher dimensional space visible) has proved to be a
powerful tool to visualize large datasets with high dimensionalities; nevertheless, it only preserves the main trends

in the data but most of the information on detail gets
lost. When the intrinsic dimensions of the data set are
high, the results can sometimes be misleading.
Here, we present a new method - Phylogenetic Map
(PhyloMap) - that combines PCoA, vector quantization,
and phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant
visualization of a large sequence data set using all the
data while still trying to capture the accurate relationships among them. Compared to traditional phylogenetic tree analysis, which is practicable only with a
maximum of a few hundred sequences, PhyloMap can
handle thousands of sequences at one time. PhyloMap
first uses PCoA to help depict the main trends and then
uses the “Neural-Gas” approach [12] to obtain multiple
data centers which best represent the data set. The
resulting data centers will be used to build a phylogenetic tree. Finally, we map the tree onto the PCoA result
by preserving the tree topology and the distances. As the
two different visualizations are superimposed, the resulting plot can greatly reduce the risk of misinterpretation.
Influenza A viruses are commonly classified by serological differences in their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. The gene sequences between
different HAs or NAs are also significantly divergent and
can be easily classified by serological type. However, the
recent emergence of the 2009 H1N1 swine-origin human
influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) [13] demonstrates that
this classification has its limitations: “H1N1” is the designation for one of the two established seasonal subtypes
as well as for the highly pathogenic 1918 virus that
caused the “Spanish flu” pandemic [14-20], and for the
currently spreading new swine-origin virus [5]. While a
better classification is obviously needed [3,21], the cluster
patterns of the internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1,
M2, NS1, and NS2) of influenza A virus are less clear.
We applied PhyloMap to influenza A virus internal
genes, using all publicly available sequences. The results
reveal patterns in those genes that cannot be seen when
only a subset of sequences is analyzed, and can help us
better characterize the diversity of influenza A virus genomes by considering not only the serological type differences but also the internal genes.

Methods
The PhyloMap algorithm

The input to PhyloMap is a set of aligned sequences,
either amino acids or nucleotides. The algorithm
involves five steps as shown in Figure 1. First, a distance
matrix is calculated using the input alignment. This distance matrix will serve as the input to PCoA and
Neural-Gas to get the principal coordinates of each
sequence and k sequences as cluster centers, where k is
defined by the user. Subsequently, the k sequences
selected by the clustering algorithm will be used to

build a phylogenetic tree. Finally, we adopted a multidimensional scaling technique similar to “Sammon’s mapping” [22] to map the phylogenetic tree onto the first
two axes of the principal coordinates. The results can
then be plotted for inspection.
1. Distance Matrix

The idea of ordination is to map the input sequences
onto a low-dimensional space so that the distances and
relationships of the sequence set are preserved as much
as possible. In order to do that, one has to calculate a
distance matrix D which contains the distances between
each pair of sequences. The distance matrix is calculated
by the “Phylip” package [23] using a continuous-time
Markov process. Higgins [9] suggested several ways of
calculating distances that will be guaranteed to be Euclidean such as the simple P-distance and using the Smith
& Smith matrix [24]. However, none of these measurements can correct multiple substitutions, and they do
not follow any evolutionary model. The distances
inferred by the continuous-time Markov process [25]
are not Euclidean but are close to P-distance when the
sequence divergence is small. As the purpose of PCoA
is to find the main trends rather than accurately reconstruct the distances between sequences in the lower
dimensional space, the effect of non-Euclidean distances
can be neglected. For the influenza A internal protein

sequences analyzed here, the Jones-Taylor-Thornton
[26] model is used to infer the distances.
2. Principal coordinate analysis

PCoA was first described by Gower [27]. Starting by
converting the n × n distance matrix D, which has elements dij, to the similarity matrix E with elements
eij = −1 2 · d2 ,
ij

(1)

E is then centralized so that we have matrix F with
elements
¯
¯ ¯
fij = eij − ei − ej + e ,

(2)

¯
¯
where ei is the mean of row i, ej is the mean of column j, and e is the grand mean of the matrix E.
¯
The eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the matrix F
are calculated. Each eigenvector is normalized so that its
sum of squares equals the corresponding eigenvalue.
The eigenvectors are ranked according to the eigenvalue
in a decreasing order. The first two eigenvectors are
used as the two-dimensional coordinates of each
sequence. The information (variation) preserved by the
first two eigenvectors is the ratio of the sum of the first
two eigenvalues to the sum of all eigenvalues.
3. Vector quantization (Clustering)

The clustering algorithm we choose here is the “NeuralGas” [12]. The Neural-Gas proceeds similar to k-means
but has the nice feature of providing results which hardly
depend on the initialization. Therefore, performing only
one run is sufficient and the algorithm yields stable
results when run multiple times. The output of the clustering algorithm is a set of k cluster centers, where k is
defined by the user. The Neural-Gas provides cluster
centers each of which minimize the mean distance to the
sequences it represents. However, we are not really
searching for clusters. What we want is a set of sequences
that best represent the data set. Therefore, finally, we
substitute each cluster center by its closest sequence. The
Neural-Gas will also guarantee that the centers are evenly
distributed across the entire data set. In this application
of Neural-Gas, we consider the algorithm as a sampling
rather than as a clustering method. When using the
resulting center sequences to build a phylogenetic tree,
the tree will explore the variation of the data set without
bias. For details of the algorithm, please refer to Martinetz et al. [12]. The number of sampling sequences
might influence the accuracy of the inferred phylogenetic
tree (see Discussion). For visualization purposes, it
should not be too low, or else the sampling sequences
would not be sufficient to represent the variation of the
data. If chosen too high, the result of PhyloMap might be
difficult to inspect visually. In practice, we found a sampling tree with no more than 50 sequences can be shown
clearly in PhyloMap.

4. Phylogenetic tree construction

Subsequently, we use the sequences selected by the
Neural-Gas to build a phylogenetic tree. The Neighborjoining (NJ) tree is used in PhyloMap with the same distance measurement used for calculating the distance
matrix for PCoA. Other non-distance-based tree building
methods can also be used (see the discussion below). The
NJ tree is unrooted since we just want to find the major
lineages of the sequences rather than to portray the exact
evolutionary history.
5. Mapping the phylogenetic tree onto the PCoA result

The core algorithm of PhyloMap is to map the phylogenetic tree onto the two-dimensional coordinates calculated by PCoA. We adopted a multidimensional scaling
method (MDS) similar to “Sammon’s mapping” [22], but
a few changes have been made to fit our specific problem.
A phylogenetic tree has two types of nodes:
• Leaf nodes: nodes that do not have any children;
each node represents a sequence.
• Inner nodes: nodes have children nodes and a parent node. The root node of the tree can be considered a special inner node that has no parent node.
Each leaf node corresponds to one point in the twodimensional PCoA result. The positions of these points
are fixed, which means the coordinates of the leaf nodes
are predefined and cannot be changed when drawing
the tree. If we want to preserve the edge length between
nodes, only the inner nodes can be moved. Unlike other
MDS problems where the distances of one data point to
all other data points are known, in PhyloMap each inner
node is only constrained by three other nodes: one parent node and two children nodes.
We first define an error function Es similar to “Sammon’s mapping":

Es =
i<j

1
s · d∗
ij

N

i<j

s · d∗ − dij
ij
s · d∗
ij

2

(3)

where s is a scaling factor that compensates for the
distance difference between the tree space and the
PCoA space (if the same distance measurement is used
∗
both in PCoA and tree building, then s = 1), dij is the
edge length between node s and node j in the tree, and
dij is the distance between node i and node j in the 2D
PCoA result.
The algorithm will then employ gradient descent on
the inner nodes to minimize Es. The distance dij defined
between node i and j is the straight-line distance. However, in our problem, the straight-line distance can only
generate poor results, either large Es or a plot that is difficult to inspect visually. This is because the leaf nodes

Zhang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/248

Page 4 of 19

cannot move and, hence, all the distance constraints
have to be satisfied by the inner nodes. If the inner
nodes only explore a small space, which will provide
attractive visual results, Es might be too large to accurately preserve the tree distances. To solve this problem,
we use the Bezier curve [28] to compensate for the distances that are shorter than in the original tree. In this
case, if the distances are shorter, they can be exactly
preserved in the PhyloMap. Only the distances larger
than in the original tree will contribute to the error
(Figure 2C). So in the gradient descent procedures, we
use a strategy which tries to keep most of the straightline distances shorter than in the original by updating
the longer distances more frequently than the shorter
ones. The error function Eb after Bezier curve compensation is defined as:

Eb =
i<j

1
s · d∗
ij

N

i<j

s · d∗ − db
ij
ij
s · d∗
ij

2

(4)

where db is the length of the Bezier curve between
ij
node i and node j.
The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
Input: tree: T; leaf-node coordinates: Cleaf; scaling factor: s; max. number of iterations: maxiters; error e.
Output: all node coordinates C node , corresponding
Bezier curve control point C bezier and error E b after
Bezier curve compensation.
1: Du := calculate the desired distance matrix using all
nodes in T.
2: Cnode := randomly initializing the coordinates of the
inner nodes and attach Cleaf.
3: D s := calculate the actual distance matrix using
Cnode.
4: while maxiters is not reached or ei ≤ e
5: for each inner node
6: update the coordinate of the inner node using gradient decent once every five iters.
7: update the coordinates of the inner node using gradient decent only if
there exists at least one edge connected to this node
∗
with dij > s · dij four times every five iters.
8: update Ds using the new coordinates.
9: end for each
10: ei := calculate error using equation (3).
11: end while

12: for each dij < s · dij
13: Cbezier := calculate the Bezier curve control point
∗
so that dij = s · dij.
14: end for each

Influenza A virus genome data

We compiled a data set containing 74,309 sequences of
influenza A virus internal proteins as available from the
NCBI database [29] on 03-01-2010 (as summarized in
Table 1). We defined strict rules [30] for data validation
to ensure a high quality of our dataset. Each sequence
included in the data set is complete or nearly complete.
All eight gene products were aligned separately using
MUSCLE [31], and the alignment results were curated
manually to assure a high quality such that gaps were
minimal. For calculating the distance matrix (described
above), protein sequences were used. The reason to use
protein instead of nucleotide sequences is that while at
the nucleotide level, two sequences may vary greatly,
they may be very close at the amino-acid level due to
functional restraints [15,19]; thus, the distance between
two amino-acid sequences is more relevant for the
assessment of their functional differences. For most of
the internal genes, around half of the protein sequences
are redundant. Hence, only one of a set of identical
sequences was used to compose the data set as the
input of the PhyloMap.

Results
PhyloMap reduces the risk of misinterpretation

We have generated the PhyloMap for all influenza A
virus internal genes using their protein sequences, i.e.
PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2 (Figures 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11). Figure 2A illustrates the
results for the example of the influenza A virus NP
gene. The following major lineages can be easily identified: (i), seasonal human H1N1 (as shown by the data
points close to “12: A/Taiwan/5072/1999(H1N1)”), (ii),
seasonal human H3N2 (as shown by the data points
close to “2: A/Waikato/122/2003(H3N2)”), (iii), early
human (as shown by the data points close to “15: A/
United Kingdom/1/1933(H1N1)”), (iv), classical swine
[32] (as shown by the data points close to “26: A/Swine/
Wisconsin/163/97(H1N1)”, which includes S-OIV), (v),
equine (as shown by the data points close to “15:
A/United Kingdom/1/1933(H1N1)”), and (vi), avian
(as shown by the data points close to “20: A/gray teal/
Australia/2/1979(H4N4)”). PhyloMap has successfully
captured all major lineages of the influenza A virus NP
gene that were shown to exist in a previous study [3]
using sequences sampled manually.
It is obvious that PCoA alone can already identify
most of the major lineages; however, without the support of the mapping tree, it fails to portray the distances
between some strains. The straight-line distance
between “29: A/equine/Sao Paulo/4/1976(H7N7)” and
“33: A/smew/Sweden/V820/2006(H5N1)” is short, but if
we follow the tree, the distance is substantially longer.

The real distance may need another dimension in the
PCoA to be displayed. The tree here has served to add
more dimensions to the 2D PCoA plot.
While the topology of the tree is defined, different
tree-drawing algorithms can generate very different tree
representations. The subtrees can be arbitrarily placed
by the tree-drawing algorithms [33] and can be moved
up and down with a certain degree of freedom. The
relationships between taxas usually cannot be clearly
observed without further manually adjusting the tree.
PCoA here has defined the positions of the leaf nodes in
PhyloMap, which intuitively provide clustering information and the scale of their divergences. In a phylogenetic
tree, some intermediate sequences would be arbitrarily
placed into one of the major lineages [9]; however, with
the guiding of PCoA, the intermediate position of such
sequences becomes apparent. For example in Figure 2B,
we might interpret the phylogenetic tree by putting the
protein sequence of “9: A/Singapore/1-MA12B/1957
(H2N2)” into the human H3N2 lineage if only the tree
is present, but its obvious intermediate position can be
clearly seen in the PhyloMap (Figure 2A). The low bootstrap value of that subtree also suggests caution should
be applied when drawing conclusions from the phylogenetic tree.
The diversity of influenza A virus internal genes

Six distinct major lineages can be identified from the
PhyloMap for all genes, i.e. seasonal human H3N2, seasonal human H1N1, early human, classical swine, equine,
and avian viruses. The latter have been further separated
into two sublineages (western hemisphere avian lineage
and eastern hemisphere avian lineage) in a previous
study [3] that used nucleotide sequences, but this cannot
be unambiguously observed from the PhyloMap built
with protein sequences. For PB2, the triple reassortment
swine strains [34,35], which include the S-OIV, form a
visually separable lineage in PhyloMap (Figure 3).
The PhyloMap shows similar patterns for PB2, PA,
NP, M1, and M2 (Figures 3, 5, 2, 6 and 7). The NS1
and NS2 genes are different from other genes by having
a unique lineage called Group B. We can see from the
PhyloMap plot (Figures 8 and 10) that NS1 and NS2
Group B has a clear boundary and is far away from
other sequences, which are collectively called Group A
[36]. Because of Group B, the NS1 and NS2 PhyloMap
looks very different from other genes. However, if we
remove Group B sequences from the NS1 and NS2 data

NS2

set and recalculate the plot (Figures 9 and 11), we can
see a topology similar to other genes (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 and 7). NS1 and NS2 Group B is composed of a variety of subtypes that are mostly avian strains, with only a
few human and swine cases. The sample time spans the
years from 1949 to 2008. However, other internal genes
in the strains that contain Group B NS1 and NS2 genes
do not form a separate lineage and most of them fall
into the lineage of avian viruses.
PB1 also shows a pattern very different from other
genes. PB1 of human H3N2 was derived from avian
strains in 1968 through reassortment [3,37]. We can see
from the PhyloMap that the human H3N2 virus PB1
sequences are closer to avian strains than other H3N2
genes. Moreover, PB1 shows a more conservative evolution pattern, as the genetic distances between different
lineages are much smaller than for other internal genes.
Another recent study also suggested the conservation of
PB1 [19]. This is easy to explain, as PB1 is the catalytic
subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
and should have a stable function in any host. A single
amino-acid exchange in the functional site may abolish
protein function and interrupt the viral life cycle.
The swine influenza viruses spread throughout the
entire PhyloMap, further supporting the idea of swine
being a “mixing-vessel” [38,39]. We also observed from
the current sequenced samples that there are no avian
strains containing internal gene segments from seasonal
human strains. In contrast, there are many human
strains carrying some internal gene segments from avian
viruses. This observation combined with the seasonal
human strain internal gene segments can be clearly
separated from avian strains (except for PB1), suggesting
that once the internal gene segments were fully adapted
to man, they lost the ability to infect avian hosts.
By observing the first few dimensions of PCoA results,
one can tell what are the major forces causing the data to
variate from each other. We can see that the first dimension in our PCoA results on the internal genes generally
reflects the host differences, and the second dimension
reflects some of the subtype differences. The third
dimension (not shown in the figures) further separates
the swine and equine strains from others. The above
observations show that the diversities of influenza A
virus internal genes are mainly shaped by host differences
and virus subtypes. However, using only subtype and host
information is still not enough to distinguish major
lineages among internal genes. For instance, the human

H1N1 strains contain three major lineages: human seasonal H1N1, early human H1N1, and 2009 pandemic
H1N1. These are highlighted in additional files (Additional files 1, Figure S1, Additional files 2, Figure S2,
Additional files 3, Figure S3, Additional files 4, Figure S4,

and Additional files 9).
PhyloMap helps locating the origin of emerging influenza
A virus

As the main patterns of influenza A internal genes can be
clearly seen from the PhyloMap result, one can start to
investigate the more subtle relationships of the data by
zooming in onto certain clusters or adding sequences of
interest into the sampling tree. The sequences of the
sampling tree found by the Neural-Gas approach minimize the quadratic errors. As a result, they can well
represent the diversity of the data set. When it comes to
finding the origin of a new strain, the samplings can provide a good reference data set that would not miss
important lineages. We have mapped the genes of 1918
“Spanish flu” (”A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1)“) and
S-OIV (”A/California/04/2009(H1N1)“) into the PhyloMap in addition to the sampling sequences. In our sampling trees, the “Spanish flu” (internal genes) forms a
separate branch and cannot be put into any major
lineages. This orphan position of “Spanish flu” seems to
support the previous notion that these gene segments
may have been acquired from a reservoir of influenza
virus that has not yet been sampled [17,18]. One can also
easily identify the origin of every internal gene of S-OIV
from PhyloMap: PB2, PA, M1, and M2 from avian
strains; PB1 from human H3N2; NP, NS1, and NS2 from
classical swine.

Discussion
While phylogenetic tree inference methods are relatively
well developed, their interpretation relies heavily on
visual inspection [40]. The difficulties of analyzing a huge
tree have been mainly tackled by developing sophisticated tree visualization software. Visual data exploration
usually follows a three-step process [41]: overview, zoom
and filter, and details-on-demand. Despite advances in
the visualization software [42,43], it is very difficult to
comprehend the entire tree during the overview stage.
When the data set reaches a few thousand sequences,
this way of phylogeny analysis becomes almost impossible. PhyloMap was developed specifically for the overview
process by summarizing the main phylogeny information.
Both PCoA and “Neural-Gas” can be considered data
compression techniques suitable to preserve the most
important information in the data. Once the main trends
in the data set are identified, one can zoom in onto areas

Page 16 of 19

of interest, thus reducing the data set to a size that can
be well visualized by traditional phylogenetic trees.
Other means of adding more information to ordination such as superimposing a minimal spanning tree
and a relative neighborhood graph have been proposed
by Guiller [44]. However, all those methods require
using all the data points, thereby only generating unrecognizable results when the data set is large. Our proposed method can also serve as a general way of adding
another layer of information to any ordination analysis
of data relationships that can alternatively be described
by using a tree structure.
The PCoA used here is a linear dimensionality-reduction technique [45,46]. Despite the recent advances in
nonlinear dimensionality reduction, we find PCoA very
suitable for PhyloMap. First, PCoA finds the greatest variance in the data set; in other words, it preserves the global
pattern and this is one of the main purposes of PhyloMap.
Other methods such as Isomap [45] using geodesic distance might not make too much sense in phylogenetic
analysis. Methods such as LLE [46] are designed to preserve local properties which is obviously not suitable for
PhyloMap. Second, PCoA is robust in the sense that it
does not depend on the initiation and does not require
other parameters. The well-established algorithm for solving PCoA is both computationally efficient and numerically stable. Although the phylogenetic distances inferred
using some evolutionary models are not Euclidean, resulting in negative eigenvalues, in practice, those values are
usually very small compared to the first few eigenvalues.
Thus, they have only minor influence on the results and
will not distort the main trends in the data.
In PhyloMap, we use distance-based methods to build
the sampling tree. As the distances are measured in the
same way both in PCoA and in the phylogenetic tree,
when mapping the tree onto the PCoA result, the error
can be minimized. However, the sampling tree can also
be built with parsimony-based or maximum-likelihood
based methods. But in such cases, the edge lengths in the
tree and the 2D PCoA result might not be on the same
scale. We need to estimate the scaling factor s in equation (4). It is very difficult to exactly estimate s before the
mapping is made, so s can only be searched within a certain range (The ratio of the distance between the furthest
cluster centers in the PCoA result and the corresponding
length in the tree can be a good starting value). This problem does not exist in classical MDS, since all the data
points during the mapping can move freely, but in PhyloMap, the leaf nodes are fixed.
The accuracy of an inferred phylogenetic tree depends
on many factors such as the number of sequences, number of characters (number of aligned positions), and
substitution rate. In general, the accuracy of the inferred
phylogenetic tree increases while more characters are

Zhang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/248

used [47,48]. However, there are also many debates on
whether to increase the number of sequences or the
number of characters to improve the resolution of the
phylogenetic analysis. In the case that the number of
available characters to build the phylogenetic tree is
fixed such as for the internal genes of influenza A virus,
one might choose a small number of sequences to
derive the most reliable tree. There are two interesting
questions connected with this approach: how to choose
the sequences, i.e. which sampling methods to apply,
and how many sequences are needed given the number
of characters. As for the sampling, we believe that clustering methods such as Neural-Gas should be used in
order to avoid bias to arise from manual sampling,
although some criteria should be developed to further
test the influence of different clustering methods on the
accuracy of the inferred tree. But an objective way of
finding the optimal number of sequences is still lacking,
and further theoretical and empirical studies are needed.

Conclusions
PhyloMap is a robust algorithm for analyzing phylogenetic relationships in large sequence data sets. It can
utilize the entire data set and avoids the bias introduced
by manual samplings. PhyloMap introduces two data
compression techniques (dimensionality reduction and
vector quantization) into phylogenetic studies to reduce
the data without losing important information. The
visualizations generated summarize the main phylogeny
information and overcome the shortcomings of phylogenetic tree construction and ordination analysis when
used alone.
There have been only a few studies targeting the phylogenetic diversity of the internal genes of influenza A
virus [3,8,54]. However, the phylogenetic trees built in
some of these studies only sampled a small portion of
the data and therefore might not reflect the actual size
and composition of the lineages, and the representative
sequences might be biased [3]. PhyloMap gives a more
comprehensive overall picture of the evolution of influenza A viruses and may further help define a new
nomenclature system for influenza A viruses.
Research on influenza A viruses has suggested that they
are constantly undergoing frequent reassortment [55,56].
However, as the overall phylogenetic relationships of the
internal genes have been largely unknown so far, few studies have addressed the scale of reassortment and the
patterns of segment compatibility in cases where the
reassortment occurred between distant lineages [57].
Furthermore, a robust way of identifying reassorted
strains is lacking. When a new strain emerges, it is a
tedious job for researchers to compare different topologies of various phylogenetic trees to find the reassortment patterns. We are confident that PhyloMap can help

Page 17 of 19

develop new insights into the relationships between the
internal genes, in order to find new means of studying
reassortment.
PhyloMap is implemented in JAVA, and the source
code is freely available for download at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/public/software/phylomap.html To
