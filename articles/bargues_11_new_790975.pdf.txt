A new baseline for fascioliasis in Venezuela:
lymnaeid vectors ascertained by DNA sequencing
and analysis of their relationships with human
and animal infection
M Dolores Bargues1, L Carolina González1,2, Patricio Artigas1 and Santiago Mas-Coma1*

Abstract
Background: Human and animal fascioliasis poses serious public health problems in South America. In Venezuela,
livestock infection represents an important veterinary problem whereas there appear to be few human cases
reported, most of which are passively detected in health centres. However, results of recent surveys suggest that
the situation may be underestimated in particular areas. To obtain a baseline for future fascioliasis assessment,
studies were undertaken by means of rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and mtDNA cox1 sequencing to clarify the specific
status of Venezuelan lymnaeids, their geographical distribution and fascioliasis transmission capacity, by comparison
with other American countries and other continents.
Results: Results obtained completely change the lymnaeid scenario known so far. The relatively rich lymnaeid
fauna of Venezuela has been proven to include (i) Lymnaea meridensis and L. neotropica as the only native
members, (ii) L. cubensis and Pseudosuccinea columella introduced from the Caribbean area, and (iii) Galba
truncatula and L. schirazensis introduced from the Old World. The absence of representatives of the stagnicoline
and Radix groups is remarkable. Four species are fascioliasis vectors: G. truncatula, L. cubensis and L. neotropica,
which have the capacity to give rise to human endemic areas, and P. columella, which is a source of animal
infection and is responsible for the spread of disease. Vector capacity in the apparently highland endemic L.
meridensis is to be confimed, although may be expected given its phylogenetic relationships. Similarly as
elsewhere, the non-transmitting L. schirazensis has been confused with L. cubensis, also with G. truncatula and
possibly with L. neotropica.
Conclusions: The new scenario leads to the re-opening of many disease aspects. In Venezuela, altitude appears to
be the main factor influencing fascioliasis distribution. Human infection shows an altitude pattern similar to other
Andean countries, although a differing highland/lowland impact on animal infection does not appear evident. The
overlap of G. truncatula, L. cubensis and probably also L. neotropica in temperate and cold zones suggests a higher
risk for human infection in mid and high altitude areas. A lymnaeid species mapping by means of DNA markers
becomes a priority to determine human and animal fascioliasis distribution in Venezuela, owing to the importance
of lymnaeid vectors in defining transmission and epidemiological patterns.

Background
Fascioliasis is a pathogenic liver parasitosis caused by
fasciolid flukes which affects humans and livestock species almost everywhere [1,2]. In the last two decades,
this disease has emerged in many countries of Latin
America, Europe, Africa and Asia [1,3]. This emergence
phenomenon has partly been related to climate change
[4,5], given the high dependence of both fasciolid larval
stages and their freshwater lymnaeid snail vectors on climatic and environmental characteristics [6].
The infectivity of the metacercarial infective stage of
isolates from different livestock species isolates have been
shown to be similar [7,8], whereas the lymnaeid vector
species represent a crucial factor for the epidemiology of
the disease [9,10]. Geographical distribution, prevalences
and intensities of both human and animal infection pronouncedly depend on the ecological characteristics
(population dynamics, anthropophylic characteristics,
type of water bodies, etc.) of the lymnaeid species
involved in the transmission. Different lymnaeid species
appear, therefore, linked to the different transmission
patterns and epidemiological scenarios of this very heterogeneous disease in humans [2,11]. Thus, similarly as
in other vector-borne diseases, this relationship supports
the use of lymnaeids as disease biomarkers and becomes
useful for mathematical modelling and remote sensing geographical information system (RS-GIS) tools for the
control of fascioliasis [12,13].
South America stands out due to the human endemic
areas described in many Andean countries, including high
prevalence and intensity in humans caused by Fasciola
hepatica, such as in Chile [14], Bolivia [15-17], Peru
[18,19] and Ecuador [20]. In Argentina the human fascioliasis situation seems to be underestimated [21] and in
Colombia appropriate studies in risky rural areas are still
pending [22].
In Venezuela, livestock infection represents an important veterinary problem in many parts of the country
(Figure 1) [23]. On the contrary, human cases reported
appear to be relatively few, around 50. Most of these
cases have been passively detected in health centres.
However, results of recent surveys give cause for concern
and also indicate that the situation may be underestimated in certain areas [23]. All in all, the insufficient present fragmentary knowledge on fascioliasis suggests the
need to ascertain the lymnaeid vector species present in
the country, their geographical distribution, ecological
characteristics and population dynamics, in order to furnish the baseline on which to design and launch the adequate studies on the disease in both humans and animals.
Only two lymnaeid species have been traditionally
reported to be present in Venezuela: Lymnaea cubensis
and Pseudosuccinea columella [24-27]. The first is a

member of the Galba/Fossaria group, a well-known vector of fascioliasis originally described from Cuba and
distributed throughout southern North America and the
Caribbean [28]. Pseudosuccinea columella is a peculiar,
widely dispersed species, believed to be originally from
the region of southern North America, Central America
and the Caribbean, but which has successfully colonised
other continents (South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania) [29,30], and is also an efficient vector leading to
increased spread of the disease [31].
This reduced list of lymnaeid species reported in Venezuela changed as the consequence of the collection of
specimens of different populations of L. cubensis in Mérida State in March 2000. A preliminary DNA sequencing
process suggested that several of these populations
belonged to the morphologically very similar species
Galba truncatula, with which it may be easily confused,
similarly as it happens with other small lymnaeid species
[28,32]. However, subsequent extensive DNA marker
sequencing proved that indeed not only one but several
different, yet similar species had been confused under the
name of L. cubensis in Venezuela. Additionally, Lymnaea
cousini, hithterto only known from Ecuador and Colombia [29], has recently been described and reported in
Venezuela [33,34].
However, lymnaeids pose serious specimen classification
difficulties when only applying malacological methods
such as anatomical studies [9,10,28,35]. Moreover, intraspecific variation of shell shape is well marked in lymnaeids,
although a genetic component in shell shape has been
shown at least in some lymnaeid populations [36]. In the
Americas, specimen classification problems are mainly
related to the so-called “fossarine” or Galba/Fossaria
group of numerous, very similar, usually undifferentiable
lymnaeid vector species [28,32], as is the case of the aforementioned L. cubensis, G. truncatula and L. cousini.
The crucial implications of lymnaeid vectors for fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control urged the
development of new tools to facilitate specimen classification, genetic characterisation of natural populations and
laboratory strains, and to elucidate the systematics and
taxonomy of the Lymnaeidae. This is the purpose of the
worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterisation initiative
[2]. Nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) markers proved useful for this endeavour
in invertebrates in general, although disadvantages and
limitations depending on each marker should be taken
into account [37]. Their application also showed their usefulness in lymnaeids [10].
The internal transcribed spacers of the rDNA, mainly
ITS-2 and secondarily ITS-1, are the most useful
sequences for studies at both specific and supraspecific
levels [2,10,38]. Similarly as in planorbid vectors of

schistosomiasis [39], a fragment of the cytochrome c
oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) of the mtDNA has also
been used in lymnaeids [28]. However, its usefulness in
lymnaeids has been recommended to be restricted to
only population and close species analyses [2], due to
saturation of nucleotide positions and problems posed
by incomplete gene sequences [37].
The purpose of this present article is to report the
results of more than ten years work by means of ITS-2,
ITS-1 and cox1 sequencing, which are required to clarify
the number of lymnaeid species present in Venezuela and
to ascertain their systematic status by comparison with
lymnaeids not only of neighbouring or geographically near
countries but also of different continents. The final analysis offers a completely new spectrum of six lymnaeid species whose composition considerably differs from what has
been noted so far. This offers a new baseline on which to

design and launch appropriate studies on human and animal fascioliasis in Venezuela henceforth. The implications
of this new vector scenario on the disease are finally
discussed.

Methods
Lymnaeid snail materials

The snail specimens studied were collected in the field,
from lymnaeid populations present in geographical areas
with human infection and/or animal fascioliasis endemicity. Given the geographical distribution of fascioliasis concentrated in the western and north-western parts of the
country (Figure 1), studies focused mainly on lymnaeid
populations found in localities of selected endemic Venezuelan states and found at different altitudes, in order to
(i) increase probabilities to assure finding all lymnaeid species present and (ii) sequence the lymnaeids found in

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:200
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/200

areas where most human cases have been reported. No
mixed populations were found. Localities furnishing the
lymnaeid specimens sequenced are noted in Table 1.
Coordinates and altitudes, types of habitat, month of collection, and number of specimens collected are added for
each locality.
Living specimens were fixed in 70% ethanol immediately after collection in the field and stored in the same
fixative until analysis.
Preliminary classification of specimens (Table 1) was,
whenever possible, based on shell shape and size and
morpho-anatomical characteristics traditionally considered of systematic usefulness, mainly the sexual organs.
Unfortunately, sometimes snail softparts were too contracted due to fixation by alcohol 96% in cold conditions
or specimens available were too small to allow a clear
anatomical classification and consequently specimens
were classified on shell characteristics only. In given
cases, specimens were collected and preliminarily classified before 2006, when publications including phenotypic re-assessments of species were not yet available. In
other cases, the preliminary classification was only at
genus level, because collectors (vets, i.e., non-malacology
experts) already knew that there were many species
under the term of “cubensis“ together with the great difficulties or even sometimes impossibility to diferentiate
between species of Galba/Fossaria. Even in a species a
priori easily classifiable as P. columella [40], its unexpected finding at very high altitude led the collectors to
leave its classification open. With regard to Galba/Fossaria species, several recent articles have furnished new
complete phenotypic re-descriptions that may help henceforth [22,28,41-43].
Molecular techniques
DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from more than one specimen of a
given population when this was deemed necessary for
sequence verification. DNA was only isolated from the
foot of each snail [28,44]. Snail feet fixed in 70% ethanol
were used for DNA extraction procedures. After dissection under a microscope, half of the foot was suspended
in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100
mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate
SDS) containing 500 μg/ml Proteinase K (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and digested for 2 hr at 55°C with
alternate shaking each 15 min. The extraction was then
performed with chloroform and DNA was precipitated
with isopropyl alcohol. The procedure steps were performed according to methods outlined previously
[9,28,32,45]. The pellet was dried and resuspended in 30
μl sterile TE buffer (pH 8.0). This suspension was stored
at -20°C until use.

DNA sequence amplification

Each one of the three DNA markers was PCR amplified
independently for each lymnaeid specimen and each
PCR product was sequenced for a bona-fide haplotype
characterisation. The rDNA spacers ITS-2 and ITS-1
were amplified using primers previously described
[9,28,32,46,47]. A mitochondrial DNA cox1 gene fragment was amplified using universal primers [48]. Amplifications were generated in a Mastercycle epgradient
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using 4-6 μl of genomic DNA for each 50 μl PCR reaction. PCR conditions
were 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 50°C and 1
min at 72°C, preceded by 30 sec at 94°C and followed
by 7 min at 72°C for ITS-2 and ITS-1, and by 40 cycles
of 30 sec at 90°C, 1 min at 48°C and 1 min at 72°C, preceded by 2.5 min at 94°C and followed by 10 min at
72°C for cox1. Ten μl of each PCR product was checked
by staining with ethidium bromide on 1% Nusieve ®
GTG agarose (FMC) gel electrophoresis, using the
Molecular Weight Marker VI (Boehringer Mannheim)
at 0.1 μg DNA/μl as control.
Purification and quantification of PCR products

Primers and nucleotides were removed from PCR products by purification on Wizard™ PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol and resuspended in 50 μl of
10 mM TE buffer (pH 7.6). The final DNA concentration
was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and
280 nm.
DNA sequencing

The sequencing of the complete rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1
and the fragment of the mtDNA cox1 gene was performed
on both strands by the dideoxy chain-termination method
[49]. It was carried out with the Taq dye-terminator chemistry kit for ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), using PCR primers.
Sequence alignments

Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL-W version 1.8
[50] and MEGA 4.0 [51], and assembly was made with
the Staden Package [52]. Subsequently, minor corrections were manually introduced for a better fit of
nucleotide correspondences in microsatellite sequence
regions. Homologies were performed using the BLASTN
programme from the National Centre for Biotechnology
information web site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST.
DNA haplotype nomenclature

The codes for the sequences obtained follow the standard nomenclature proposed previously for lymnaeid
snails [2,10,46]. It shall be noted that haplotype codes
are only definitive in the case of complete sequences.
When dealing with fragments or incomplete sequences,
haplotype codes are provisional.

Phylogenetic inference

Phylogenetic analysis of ITS-2 and ITS-1 combined haplotypes was performed with a Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach using PAUP version 4.0b10. ML parameters and
the evolutionary model best fitting our dataset were determined using Akaike and Bayesian information criteria
(AIC and BIC) [57,58], implemented in jModeltest vesion
0.1.1 [59]. Starting branch lengths were obtained using the
least-squares method with ML distances.
To provide an assessment of the reliability of the nodes
in the ML tree, three methods were used. First, a bootstrap
analysis using 1000 replicates was made with fast-heuristic
search in PAUP. Second, a distance-based phylogeny using
the neighbour-joining (NJ) algorithm [60] with the ML

Page 7 of 18

pairwise distances was obtained and statistical support for
the nodes was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates,
with and without removal of gapped positions. Third, a
Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction procedure was applied
to obtain posterior probabilities (BPP) for the nodes in the
ML tree, by using the same evolutionary model as above,
implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [61] with four chains during
1,000,000 generations, trees being sampled every 100 generations. The first 1000 trees sampled were discarded
(“burn-in”) and clade posterior probabilities (PP) were
computed from the remaining trees.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed after adding the
following reference sequences of rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1
of lymnaeids stored in the databases: L. (Stagnicola)
palustris palustris [EMBL: AJ319620, EMBL: AJ626849];
L. (S.) fuscus [EMBL: AJ319621, EMBL: AJ626856] [9];
Catascopia catascopium [GenBank: AF013143, GenBank: AF013143]; Hinkleyia caperata [GenBank:
AF013139, GenBank: AF013139] [62]; Radix auricularia
ITS-2 halplotype 1 [EMBL: AJ319628]; R. balthica (= R.
peregra) ITS-2 haplotype 1 [EMBL: AJ319633] [9]. The
intergenic region sequence [GenBank: AY030361]
including both ITSs of the planorbid species Biomphalaria pfeifferi [63] was used as outgroup.

Results
Nuclear rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and mtDNA cox1
nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper are
available in the GenBank database under the accession
numbers noted in Table 1.
Lymnaea cubensis

Specimens from Magdaleno and Mucura (Aragua State),
Estanques Lagunillas and Jají (Mérida State), preliminarily classified as L. cubensis or Lymnaea sp. aff. cubensis,
proved to be L. cubensis by ribosomal and mitochondrial
DNA markers (Table 1).
rDNA ITS-2

Two haplotypes were found in the populations studied. All
specimens from Aragua and Estanques Lagunillas showed
identical ITS-2 sequences, of 466 bp and 56.65% GC content, which is different from the three haplotypes (H1, H2,
H3) available in EMBL, and is therefore here added as a
new haplotype, L.cub-H4 (Table 1). The great length difference between the haplotypes L.cub-H1, H2 and H3 is
related to a tetranucleotide microsatellite (CTTG) which
appears in positions 51-146 of the ITS-2 alignment and
which is consecutively repeated 25, 5 and 13 times in
L. cubensis H1, H2 and H3, respectively. The new haplotype H4 is characterised by the same microsatellite repeat
but appearing interruptedly (CTTG) 1 CATG(CTTG)
1CATG(CTTG)3. Nucleotide and microsatellite differences
in L. cubensis haplotypes (H1 to H4) are listed in Figure 2.
The specimens from Jají population showed an ITS-2

be identical to this haplotype also present in Peru and
Argentina [EMBL: AM412228].

rDNA ITS-1

Only one haplotype was detected in all specimens and
populations studied, with a length of 672 bp and an AT
content of 68,60%. This sequence fits exactly with the
previously described L.cub-cox1b from South Carolina,
USA [EMBL: FN182205], differing by only one mutation
(T/C) with regard to L.cub-cox1a in position 468 of the
respective alignment. In the amino acidic sequence
alignment (224 aa long), both cox1a and cox1b haplotypes are identical.

Two haplotypes were detected in the populations studied, both identical in length (672 bp) and AT content
(69,64%) but differing at two variable positions (Figure
3). When compared to the other two cox1 sequence
haplotypes of L. neotropica available in EMBL (cox1a
and cox1b), it proved to be different at 8 variable positions (Figure 3). Therefore, these two new haplotypes
have been deposited in GenBank under the provisional
codes L.neo-cox1c and L.neo-cox1d (Table 1). In the
amino acidic sequence alignment (224 aa long), both
cox1c and cox1d haplotypes appear to be identical.
Amino acidic changes detected between the four L. neotropica cox1 haplotypes only concern one amino acid
(G/S) in position 125 (Figure 3). Interestingly, when
translated to amino acids, these Venezuelan haplotypes
L.neo-cox1c and L.neo-cox1d give rise to the same
amino acid sequence than the one obtained from the
three L. cubensis haplotypes cox1a, cox1b and cox1c.

Lymnaea neotropica

Galba truncatula

Specimens from La Linda (Carabobo State) and Finca el
Arenal, Tucacas (Falcón State), preliminarily classified as
L. cubensis, proved to be L. neotropica by ribosomal and
mitochondrial DNA markers (Table 1).

Specimens from Iglesia Monterrey, two different populations in San Rafael de Mucuchíes, Apartaderos and Paso
del Cóndor (Mérida State), preliminarily classified as
Galba/Fossaria sp., L. viatrix or L. cubensis, proved to
be G. truncatula by ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA
markers (Table 1).

All the specimens from the four populations analysed
present the same ITS-1 sequence, of 520 bp and a
56.35% GC content. When compared with the three
ITS-1 haplotypes of L. cubensis available in EMBL (HA,
HB, HC), this ITS-1 proved to be identical to the haplotype L.cub-HB also present in Sullivan Island, South
Carolina, USA [EMBL: FN182202].
mtDNA cox1

rDNA ITS-2

All the specimens showed identical ITS-2 sequence, of
415 bp and a 56.87% GC content. When compared with
the ITS-2 haplotype of L. neotropica available in EMBL
(H1), the Venezuelan sequence proved to be different,
showing a shorter length due to the lack of one microsatellite repeat (AT) in positions 402-403 of the
sequence alignment of both ITS-2 haplotypes. This is
the first time that this haplotype has been found and
has consequently been deposited in GenBank under the
new code L.neo-H2 (Table 1).
rDNA ITS-1

All specimens studied presented the same ITS-1
sequence of 533 bp and a 56.66% GC content. This
sequence was compared with the ITS-1 haplotype of L.
neotropica available in EMBL (L.neo-HA) and proved to

mtDNA cox1

rDNA ITS-2

All the specimens showed an identical ITS-2 sequence,
of 401 bp and a 59.10% GC content. When compared
with the three ITS-2 haplotypes of G. truncatula available in EMBL (H1, H2, H3), this sequence proved to be
identical to the previously described ITS-2 haplotype 2
(H2) for G. truncatula [EMBL: AJ243017].
rDNA ITS-1

All specimens studied showed identical ITS-1 sequence,
of 504 bp and a 57.74% GC content. This sequence was
compared with the three ITS-1 haplotypes of G. truncatula available in EMBL (HA, HB, HC) and proved to be
different, with a specific mutation C instead of T in
position 449 of the ITS-1 haplotype sequence alignment.

This new haplotype has been deposited in GenBank
under the code G.tru-HD (Table 1).
mtDNA cox1

Only one haplotype was detected, being identical in all
specimens analysed and including 672 bp and a 68.16%
AT content. This haplotype proved to be different by
showing 27 specific mutations when compared to the
other cox1 sequence fragments of similar length of G.
truncatula available in EMBL (Figure 4). The new haplotype has therefore been deposited in GenBank under
the provisional code G.tru-cox1b (Table 1). However,
both cox1a and cox1b haplotypes were identical in the
224-aa-long amino acidic sequence alignment, which
means that the 27 mutations are all silent.
Lymnaea schirazensis

Snail specimens collected from Hotel Valle Grande,
Laguna Fe y Alegría and La Trampa (Mérida State), preliminarily classified as Galba/Fossaria sp., L. cubensis or G.
truncatula, proved to be L. schirazensis after ribosomal
and mitochondrial DNA marker sequencing (Table 1).
rDNA ITS-2

All the specimens analysed presented the same ITS-2
sequence, of 444 bp and a 53.82% GC content. When

compared to the two ITS-2 haplotypes of L. schirazensis
available in GenBank, it proved to be identical to the
previously described L.schi-H1 [GenBank: JF272601].
This haplotype differs from the other haplotype known
L.schi-H2 [GenBank: JF272602] in only 8 polymorphic
sites, corresponding to 8 indels caused by the microsatellite repeat (TGCT), being present twice in the haplotype 1 between positions 128 and 135 of the alignment
and absent in the haplotype 2.
rDNA ITS-1

All the lymnaeid individuals showed identical ITS-1
sequences, of 533 bp long and a 59.91% GC content.
This haplotype was compared with two ITS-1 haplotypes of L. schirazensis available in GenBank (HA, HB)
and proved to be the same as the previously described
L.schi-HA [GenBank: JF272605]. Differences between
this haplotype A and L.schi-HB [GenBank: JF272604]
are only 1 mutation and two indels.
mtDNA cox1

All of the specimens sequenced showed an identical
cox1 nucleotide sequence, of 672 bp and with a biased
AT content of 69.5%. This sequence was compared with
the four cox1 haplotypes of L. schirazensis known so far
and proved to be identical to the previously described

haplotype L.schi-cox1a [GenBank: JF272607]. Nucleotide
and amino acid differences between the four described
haplotypes for L. neotropica are listed in Figure 5.
Lymnaea meridensis

The specimens from Laguna Mucubaji (Mérida State),
previously identified as L. cousini, proved by ribosomal
and mitochondrial DNA marker sequences to be
another species to which the name L. meridensis has
been recently given (Table 1).
rDNA ITS-2

Sequence length and its slightly GC biased average nucleotide composition are 457 bp and 58.85%, respectively. This
sequence corresponds to the original haplotype L.mer-H1
of the recently described species L. meridensis [EMBL:
FN598154]. In the ITS-2 sequence alignment with the
haplotype H1 of L. cousini [EMBL: FN598157], a high
number (63) of variable positions appear (12.45%), of
which 14 are mutations and 49 indels.
rDNA ITS-1

ITS-1 length and its slightly GC biased average nucleotide
composition are 570 bp and 58.41%, respectively. This
sequence corresponds to the haplotype L.mer-HA of
L. meridensis [EMBL: FN598159]. In the ITS-1 sequence
alignment of L.mer-HA with haplotypes HA and HB of
L. cousini [EMBL: FN598157, EMBL: FN598158], a total of
47 variable positions appear (7.75%), of which 29 were
mutations and 18 indels.
mtDNA cox1

This fragment has a length of 672 bp and a highly ATbiased average nucleotide composition of 69.2%, and corresponds to the haplotype cox1a of L. meridensis [EMBL:
FN598164]. When compared with the three L. cousini cox1
provisional haplotypes available in EMBL (cox1a, cox1b
and cox1c), the differences between both species reach
5.80%. Details on nucleotide and amino acid differences
between L. meridensis and L. cousini are listed in Figure 6.

Pseudosuccinea columella

The specimens from La Linda (Carabobo State) and El
Valle (Mérida) previously identified as P. columella or
ascribed to an undetermined lymnaeid (Lymnaeidae gen.
sp.) respectively, proved to be P. columella also by ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA markers (Table 1).
rDNA ITS-2

Two haplotypes were found in the populations studied.
All specimens from La Linda, showed identical ITS-2
sequence, of 404 bp and a biased GC content of 60.64%.
This ITS-2 sequence is identical to P.col-H2 from
Colombia [EMBL: FN598156]. Specimens from El Valle
showed the same ITS-2 sequence of 470 bp and 57.02%
GC content, which is identical to P.col-H1 from Puerto
Rico [EMBL: FN598155]. Worth mentioning is the presence of T in the sequence position 6 in the La Linda
population, whereas it presents C in El Valle population.
When compared to the ITS-2 of P. columella from Cuba
available in the database [GenBank: AY186751], a total of
2 mutations and 9 indels appear.
rDNA ITS-1

The ITS-1 sequence of both populations was the same,
with a length of 536 bp and a slightly GC biased average
nucleotide composition of 58.02%. This sequence was
identical to that previously described for P.col-HA from
Puerto Rico [EMBL: FN598160]. In a pairwise alignment
comparison with P. columella ITS-1 from Cuba available
in the database [GenBank: AY186751: 527 bp long and
58.44% GC], three indels appear in positions 262, 270
and 276. Worth noting is the presence of A in position
510, in which whether A or G were found in Cuba
depending on the susceptibility or resistance characteristics of the population, respectively.
mtDNA cox1

Only one haplotype was detected in all specimens of the
populations studied. This fragment has a length of 672 bp
and a highly AT-biased average nucleotide composition of

69.2%. This sequence was compared with the other two P.
columella cox1 sequences of similar length already published and available in databases. Nucleotide and amino
acid compositions of P. columella from Venezuela are
identical to those of the haplotype cox1a from Puerto Rico
[EMBL: FN598165] and Australia [GenBank: AY227366].
Phylogenetic analysis

The ML model best fitting the ITS-1 an ITS-2 combined haplotype dataset was found to be GTR+G (-Ln
likelihood = 8346.73598) with a shape parameter (alpha)
of 0.6622, base frequencies for A, C, G, and T of
0.20677, 0.27935, 0.25969 and 0.25419, respectively, and
a proportion of invariable sites = 0. The new ITS-1
sequences obtained from the two Radix species R. auricularia and R. balthica used were adequately deposited
in the database [EMBL: AJ319628 and EMBL: AJ319633,
respectively].
The combination of the two internal transcribed
spacers in a single dataset generated a robust tree, indicating phylogenetic accordance between the two spacers
in the ML tree obtained (Figure 7).
The monophyly of the ITSs haplotypes of the five lymnaeid species of the Galba/Fossaria group found in Venezuela was strongly supported (92/99/99 in NJ/ML/BBP).
In this clade, G. truncatula does not appear clustering
with other morphologically similar lymnaeids such as the
New World L. cubensis and L. neotropica, nor to the phenotypically very close Old World L. schirazensis, but interestingly with L. meridensis, although supports are not
high. Lymnaea schirazensis appears in a basal position, as
a sister species, in this monophyletic group, although the
clustering of the other four Galba/Fossaria species does
not appear well supported.
Pseudosuccinea columella appears basal to the two
groupings of the stagnicolines, including both Palaearctic
and Nearctic species, and the Galba/Fossaria clade
which comprises the F. hepatica main vector species.
The branch of Pseudosuccinea, Galba/Fossaria and stagnicolines appears, moreover, well separated from the

Radix branch, with very high supports (98/96/100 in NJ/
ML/BBP).

Discussion
Lymnaeid species reported in Venezuela

The first report on lymnaeid snail morphology and their
habitat in Venezuela, as well as their possible involvement in F. hepatica transmission, appeared early in the
20th century [64]. The presence and involvement of
L. cubensis in the transmission of F. hepatica in different
parts of the country was described from the mid-last
century, mainly with regard to livestock infection
[65-68], but also from places where human infection
had been reported [69,70]. The presence of P. columella
was detected for the first time in Venezuela somewhat
later in a water canal of Maracay city, Aragua State [71].
Numerous multidisciplinary studies on L. cubensis, less
numerous on P. columella, were performed mainly during the 1980s and first part of the 1990s, including
research on distribution, biology, ecology, experimental
F. hepatica infection, epidemiology and control in western areas [25,27,72-80].
Publications on lymnaeid snails in Venezuela have been
more sporadic from the beginning of the 21st century. A
high 23.3% F. hepatica infection prevalence in L. cubensis
snails in endemic livestock farms of the Zulia State was
noted [81]. Surprisingly high prevalences of 39-43% were
also reported from non-classified lymnaeids in different
habitats in another farm of Mérida [82]. After the addition of L. cousini [33] and inclusion of G. truncatula, the
four aforementioned species were noted as the only lymnaeids found in Venezuela within the very recent country
wide malacological review [34].
A new lymnaeid species scenario obtained by DNA
sequencing

Results obtained by DNA sequencing completely change
the lymnaeid scenario in Venezuela. The new scenario of
six lymnaeid species contributed in the present paper
shows up to which level malacological methods may give

rise to misclassifications when dealing with Lymnaeidae,
mainly in problematic groups such as Galba/Fossaria
[28,43]. Except P. columella, a species with peculiar anatomo-morphological and shell shape characteristics,
which facilitate its classification mainly in the largest specimens, the remaining L. cubensis, L. neotropica, G. truncatula, L. schirazensis and L. meridensis may be included
in Galba/Fossaria (Figure 7). This may explain why the
latter four species had been overlooked under the binomium L. cubensis during so much time. These five

Galba/Fossaria species are very similar and almost indistinguishable when young and mid-sized.
This lymnaeid fauna thus appears to be markedly rich
when compared to that known in countries of the
regions of Central America, the Caribbean and South
America. The lymnaeid richness of Venezuela results
from the overlap of (i) species of Caribbean and/or Central American origin, such as L. cubensis and P. columella [22], (ii) elements which may be considered
typical or perhaps endemic of the Neotropical region,

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:200
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/200

such as L. neotropica and L. meridensis [22,28], and (iii)
lymnaeids indeed imported by human activities from
other continents, such as G. truncatula of European origin and L. schirazensis of Asian origin [9,28,43]. This
peculiar Venezuelan lymnaeid fauna is also characterised
by two remarkable absences, such as the lack of representatives from the very large Radix and stagnicoline
groups (Figure 7) [9,35]. With regard to Radix, Venezuela agrees with its absence in the New World,
although given Old World Radix species were imported
to the USA time ago [9]. Stagnicolines, widely spread
throughout the Palaearctic region [35], are also represented by several species in the Nearctic region [62] and
even by one endemic species in Mexico [83]. The
absence of stagnicolines in Venezuela supports their
inability to colonise warmer latitudes, which agrees with
their ecological preferences for cold-mild climates
throughout the Holarctic.
Characterisation of Venezuelan lymnaeids

In L. cubensis, the detection of two different ITS-2 haplotypes highlights two different aspects. The fact that the
combined haplotype L.cub-2B,cox1b of the two Aragua
populations is identical to that found in South Carolina,
USA, suggests a derivation from the same geographical
source. Hence, the presence of this combined haplotype in
lowlands as a consequence of human importation not very
long ago cannot be ruled out. On the contrary, the presence of another combined haplotype differing by only
two A/T transversions and a different repeat number of
an interrupted microsatellite at ITS-2 level (Figure 2) suggests potential adaptive mutations to the high altitude.
The present genetic confirmation of L. neotropica represents the first citation of this species in Venezuela, where
it could have been confused with L. cubensis in lowland
areas. The morphological similarity between these two
species is at such a level that the synonymy of L. cubensis
and L. viatrix was proposed [84] largely before the molecularly-based erection of the new species L. neotropica for
the old, northern variety B elongata of L. viatrix [28]. The
finding of L. neotropica in Venezuela expands the geographical distribution of this species, hithterto only described
from Peru [28] and Argentina [55], pronouncedly northward. Sequence differences, restricted to only the lack of a
dinucleotide microsatellite repeat in the ITS-2 and to 6-7
mutations in cox1 giving rise to only one different amino
acid (Figure 3), may be interpreted as peripheral populations adapted to warmer Venezuelan lowlands of a lymnaeid species apparently very widely distributed
throughout South America.
The present study reports the first published DNA
sequence confirmation of the presence of G. truncatula in
Venezuela, where it has been overlooked at high altitudes
but perhaps also confused with L. cubensis in mid altitudes

Page 13 of 18

around 1900-2000 m. Galba truncatula, of Palaearctic origin and probable man-made importation from a European
source [2], has already been described in highlands of
other South American countries such as Bolivia [45,47],
Peru [18] and Argentina [85,86]. Whereas the detection of
only one mutation in the ITS-1 may easily be assumed,
the high number of 27 mutations in a 672-bp-long cox1
fragment when compared to other G. truncatula populations from elsewhere is surprising, even being silent
(Figure 4).
Lymnaea schirazensis could have been confused in
Venezuela with L. cubensis over a long time period and
also with G. truncatula since the first detection of the
latter in Mérida State in March 2000. Such confusion,
however, does not differ from that which occurred in
Asia, Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, Central America
and South America. A recent large study has demonstrated that L. schirazensis and G. truncatula very pronouncedly differ at the level of rDNA and mtDNA,
despite its marked anatomical and shell similarity: 130139 nucleotide differences in ITS-2, 134-138 differences
in ITS-1, and 57-67 mutations in cox1 [43]. This multidisciplinary study also allowed us to distinguish several
phenotypic characteristics which help in the differentiation of both species [43]. The combined haplotype L.
schi-1A, cox1a found in Venezuela is the same also
detected in other countries such as Iran, Egypt, Spain
and the Dominican Republic (Figure 5). This suggests a
human importation way from its probable original area
in the Near East of Asia whether indirectly through the
Dominican Republic in the first decades of the Spanish
colonisation period or perhaps directly from the Iberian
Peninsula by way of commercial ship activities in subsequent periods [43].
Lymnaea meridensis has recently been described as a
new species after the DNA sequencing characterisation
of the lymnaeid population of Laguna Mucubaji, Mérida
State [22], initially classified as L. cousini by malacological techniques [33]. Polymorphic sites are sufficiently
numerous as to distinguish two species: 64 nucleotide
differences (12.65% divergence) in ITS-2, 68-71 differences in ITS-1 (11.29-11.73%), and 37 differences in
cox1 (5.5%) (Figure 6). Moreover, a detailed morphometric comparison allowed the differentiation of both
species by many anatomical characteristics [22]. The
finding of another lymnaeid population in the relatively
near locality of Paso del Cóndor, at an altitude of 4040
m, recently ascribed to L. cousini [34], may most probably also concern L. meridensis. Both 18S gene sequence
and the phylogenetic analysis based on ITS sequences
supported a close evolutionary relationship between L.
meridensis and L. cousini, suggesting an old common
origin and a probable endemic divergence of L. meridensis by isolation in Venezuelan highlands [22].

Venezuelan P. columella show two ITS-2 haplotypes,
H1 and H2, identical to those found in Puerto Rico and
Colombia, respectively. The ITS-1 appears to be the
same in these three countries. The cox1 fragment
sequence is identical to that in Puerto Rico and Colombia
[22] and also Autralia [56]. Pseudosuccinea columella is a
rapidly colonising, more aquatic, more heat-tolerant species, considered to originate from Central America, the
Caribbean and the southern part of North America. This
lymnaeid is widely distributed throughout the world,
including North, Central and South America and the
Caribbean [26,87], Europe [30], Africa [88], Australia,
New Zealand and even Tahiti [29,31]. Its typical presence
in botanical gardens suggests its introduction with aquatic plants [88], a phenomenon especially increased in the
last decades after the strong development of the trade of
aquarium plants [30]. Thus, the presence of P. columella
in Venezuela should most probably be considered the
result of a human introduction in recent times, similarly
as in whole South America and in the other continents.
Summing up, DNA sequencing results suggest that (i)
the original lymnaeid fauna of Venezuela was indeed only
composed by L. meridensis and perhaps also L. neotropica,
and that (ii) L. cubensis and P. columella were introduced
from the Caribbean area, and (iii) G. truncatula and
L. schirazensis from the Old World through human shipping activities in recent times (Figure 7).
Implications for human and animal fascioliasis
epidemiology

Among the six lymnaeid species confirmed to be present
in Venezuela, four of them are known to be good vectors
of fascioliasis: L. cubensis, L. neotropica, G. truncatula and
P. columella. This great diversity leads to the need of
reopening several epidemiological and distributional
aspects of the disease in both humans and animals.
Galba truncatula is considered the original and more
efficient F. hepatica vector known [2]. Moreover, it is the
only transmitter in the highest human fascioliasis hyperendemic situations known, namely in high altitude
Andean areas of Bolivia [89] and Peru [18]. Such high
fascioliasis transmission rates have been proved to be the
consequence of life cycle modifications in both F. hepatica and G. truncatula as an adaptation response to the
extreme conditions of the very high altitude [47]. In high
altitude areas, fascioliasis in children is usually detected
in the advanced chronic stage, which has proved to have
a great morbidity impact [90-92]. This poses a question
mark of concern with regard to Andean highlands in
Venezuela. The recent detection of liver fluke infection
in children when performing random surveys in altitude
areas of Mérida State [93] suggests that the human fascioliasis situation may be underestimated, mainly in high
altitude Andean areas where G. truncatula is present. It

Page 14 of 18

is well known that children do not usually attend hospitals or health centres in such rural areas, as proved by
the high fascioliasis prevalences and intensities detected
in schoolchildren in other Andean countries [16-18].
Besides Mérida State, G. truncatula has also been
recently reported from several high altitude areas ranging
2032-2511 m in Táchira State [34], where fascioliasis in
cattle is known from lowlands and mid altitudes [69,94]
but human infection has never been reported.
Lymnaea cubensis and L. neotropica have also been
found to be linked to human infection. Lymnaea cubensis
is related to the Caribbean insular epidemiological pattern
of human fascioliasis, typically represented by repeated
outbreaks in a human hypoendemic area such as in Cuba
[11]. In Venezuela, the presence of L. cubensis has been
described in several areas of Trujillo State [24,73,76,78]
and Portuguesa State [80], where or near to where human
infection cases have been sporadically reported, as in highlands of Trujillo State such as Carache, at 1210 m [95,96]
and Jajó, at 1796 m [97], although subsequent surveys did
not detect human infection despite the a priori adequate
characteristics of the place [98], and lowlands of Portuguesa State such as Guanare, at 183 m [99]. In the present
study, L. cubensis has also been molecularly confirmed to
be present in Mérida State up to almost 2000 m altitude,
close to the 2050 m of the locality of Timotes where
human infection was detected in a survey [93].
Lymnaea neotropica was originally described near Lima,
Peru [28], where human infection has repeatedly been
detected [100,101]. Peruvian L. viatrix (= L. neotropica
according to [28]) has been shown to transmit fascioliasis
both experimentally and in nature [102]. The transmission
capacity of L. neotropica has also been molecularly confirmed in Argentina [55]. In Venezuela, DNA sequencing
results have demonstrated the presence of L. neotropica in
lowlands of Carabobo and Falcon States. No human case
has so far been described from Falcon, but sporadic
human infection has been reported from Valle del Cabriales, at 479 m [64], where animal infection is endemic
[103], and Valencia city, at 430 m [104].
Pseudosuccinea columella plays a prominent role in F.
hepatica transmission to animals, as in the Caribbean
[105,106] and Brazil [107]. However, its aquatic ecology
and habitat preferences seem to explain why this vector
species has never been particularly involved in human
infection. Interestingly, one mutation at the level of the
ITS-1 and another at ITS-2 have proved useful in distinguishing between susceptible and resistant populations of
P. columella in Cuba [53], although nothing evidently suggests that these mutations are linked to resistance/susceptibility. The presence of A in position 510 of the pairwise
ITS-1 alignment comparison with P. columella from Cuba
suggests that this species presents F. hepatica-susceptible
populations in Venezuela, whereas a T in position 6 of the

Bargues et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:200
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/200

ITS-2 indicates that a resistance-linked mutation is also
there, at least in La Linda. In Venezuela, P. columella has
only been found isolatedly in the States of Aragua (Maracay city), Carabobo (southern part of Valencia Lake),
Guárico (Corozo Pando) and Mérida (El Valle) throughout
an altitude range of 63-1929 m [23,34]. This, together with
the failure in refinding the populations of Maracay and
Valencia in the 2006 survey [34], indicates that this exotic
species has apparently not yet been able to further colonise and expand in Venezuela. This may be interpreted as
the consequence of still insufficient time after a probable
very recent man-made introduction. All in all, there is no
evidence to support the idea that P. columella was the
source of any of the human cases reported in Venezuelan
lowlands. Lymnaea cubensis and the very similar L. neotropica were probably in the background of these sporadic
infections, almost all concerning adult and old patients,
passively detected in health centres in lowland areas.
Indeed, L. cubensis has been cited in many lowlands of
several States such as Aragua, Falcón, Lara, Portuguesa,
Yaracuy, Zulia, Barinas, Trujillo, Sucre and Monagas
[23,34].
Experimental infection assays of L. schirazensis have
proved that fasciolid larval stages are not able to fully
develop within this lymnaeid, which does, therefore, not
participate in disease transmission [43]. In Venezuela, the
presence of L. schirazensis poses a question mark on the
geographical distribution of G. truncatula and all other
Galba/Fossaria species with whose small and mid-sized
specimens it may be very easily confused. One wonders
whether unnoticed L. schirazensis specimens could be
related to the different fascioliasis transmission capacities
linked to different L. cubensis specimen size highlighted in
mid-altitude localities of Trujillo State [76,77]. Efforts are
needed henceforth in Venezuela to clarify the geographical
distribution of each Galba/Fossaria species, in order to
furnish the baseline on which to correctly analyse the epidemiological characteristics and geographical distribution
of both human and animal fascioliasis.
Nothing is known about the potential capacity of L. meridensis to transmit F. hepatica. However, both very close
molecular and phylogenetic relationships with the species
L. cousini suggest that it may most probably be involved in
fascioliasis transmission [22]. Studies, both in nature and
in the laboratory, are needed to assess whether L. meridensis plays a role in fascioliasis transmission.

Conclusions
Distribution, both in space (latitudinal, longitudinal and
altitudinal) and time (seasonal, yearly), of fascioliasis markedly depends on climate factors influencing (i) presence/
absence and population dynamics of the freshwater vector
species and (ii) fluke development of free larval stages in
freshwater and of parasitic larval stages inside the snail.

Page 15 of 18

Air temperature, rainfall and evapotranspiration are the
climate factors that more pronouncedly affect definitive
host infection incidence [5]. The only fasciolid present in
Venezuela is F. hepatica, a fluke species well known due
to its preference for temperate and cold climates [2]. This
broadly fits with animal fascioliasis reports in Venezuela,
which show a clear geographical trend for north-western
temperate and colder zones (Figure 1) [23].
Human infection has, however, only been reported
from the Capital District, Miranda, Carabobo, Portuguesa, Trujillo, Mérida and Bolívar (Figure 1) [23].
Although human reports are few when compared to
other South American countries, such as Chile [14],
Bolivia [15-17] and Peru [18,19], a similar altitude pattern appears. In Venezuela, human infection shows
more numerous patients, more child involvement and
case concentration (same locality, same school) in altitude areas of the western Andean States. Cases appear
to be isolated, sporadic and affecting adult and old subjects in the eastern lowland plains. Thus, the altitudinal
distribution of this lower human infection situation in
Venezuela appears to be similar to that in Ecuador [20]
and Argentina [21].
Hence, in Venezuela all evidence indicates that altitude
is the main factor influencing fascioliasis distribution,
and therefore highlights importance of accurately assessing the altitudinal distribution range of each of the lymnaeid vector species. Altitudinal data for each species
noted in Table 1 furnish a first approach. The new scenario provided here implies the need to completely reassess the distribution of each one of the six lymnaeid
species in space and time with the help of the DNA marker tools. Lymnaeid mapping becomes a priority to determine the distribution of human and animal fascioliasis
inside Venezuela. The overlap of G. truncatula, L. cubensis and probably also L. neotropica in temperate and cold
zones suggests that there is a higher risk for human
infection in mid and high altitude rural areas. Appropriate human surveys, mainly focusing on children, in such
areas are evidently needed to verify whether overlooked
fascioliasis prevalence may exist.
The overlap, in the same endemic area, of more than
one lymnaeid vector species with different ecological
requirements and population dynamics will unfortunately make the application of mathematical forecast
indexes [12] more complicated. Increased difficulties
may similarly be expected for remote sensing and geographical information system (RS-GIS) methods [13] to
obtain accurate results useful for fascioliasis risk assessment and monitoring.
