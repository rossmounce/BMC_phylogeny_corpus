Abstract
Background: The human genome carries a high load of proviral-like sequences, called Human
Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which are the genomic traces of ancient infections by active
retroviruses. These elements are in most cases defective, but open reading frames can still be found
for the retroviral envelope gene, with sixteen such genes identified so far. Several of them are
conserved during primate evolution, having possibly been co-opted by their host for a physiological
role.
Results: To characterize further their status, we presently sequenced 12 of these genes from a
panel of 91 Caucasian individuals. Genomic analyses reveal strong sequence conservation (only two
non synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms [SNPs]) for the two HERV-W and HERV-FRD
envelope genes, i.e. for the two genes specifically expressed in the placenta and possibly involved
in syncytiotrophoblast formation. We further show – using an ex vivo fusion assay for each allelic
form – that none of these SNPs impairs the fusogenic function. The other envelope proteins
disclose variable polymorphisms, with the occurrence of a stop codon and/or frameshift for most
– but not all – of them. Moreover, the sequence conservation analysis of the orthologous genes
that can be found in primates shows that three env genes have been maintained in a fully coding
state throughout evolution including envW and envFRD.
Conclusion: Altogether, the present study strongly suggests that some but not all envelope
encoding sequences are bona fide genes. It also provides new tools to elucidate the possible role of
endogenous envelope proteins as susceptibility factors in a number of pathologies where HERVs
have been suspected to be involved.

Background
A large fraction (8%) of the human genome contains elements of retroviral origin, with thousands of sequences

closely related to the integrated proviral form of infectious
retroviruses with the canonical gag, prt, pol and env genes
[1]. These elements, named human endogenous

retroviruses (HERV), are most probably the proviral remnants of ancestral germline infections by active retroviruses, which have thereafter been transmitted in a
Mendelian manner. HERVs have been grouped according
to sequence homologies into more than 80 distinct families, each containing a few to several hundreds elements
(reviewed in [2-4], see [5] for their classification). Most
HERV genes are non-coding, due to either terminating
mutations or deletions, but we have characterized 16
human endogenous env genes that have retained a coding
capacity among the 30,000 endogenous proviral elements
of the human genome [6]. The analysis of their transcriptome in healthy human tissues has revealed that three of
them are highly expressed in the placenta, namely the
erv3/HERV-R, the HERV-W and the HERV-FRD env genes
[6].
Phylogenetic as well as functional analyses have revealed
strong similarities between HERVs and the present-day
infectious retroviruses, suggesting a common history and
shared ancestors. Accordingly, it has been proposed that
HERVs may still possess some of the functions of infectious retroviruses and as such have pathogenic effects,
provided that they are transcriptionally active. Conversely, it is also plausible that HERV proteins may have
been co-opted by the host for its benefit. Along this line,
it has been proposed that the HERV envelope proteins
could play a role in several processes including i) protection against infection by present-day retroviruses through
receptor interference [7], ii) protection of the fetus against
the maternal immune system via an immunosuppressive
domain located in the envelope transmembrane (TM)
subunit [8,9], and iii) placenta morphogenesis through
fusogenic effects allowing differentiation of cytotrophoblastic cells into the syncytiotrophoblast [10-12]. In accordance with a symbiotic role for HERVs, it has recently been
shown that the HERV-W and HERV-FRD envelope gene
products are highly fusogenic glycoproteins that are specifically expressed in the placenta and can mediate cellcell fusion ex vivo [12,13]. Involvement of HERV proteins
in physiological processes, however, remains a debated
issue, and definite evidence is still lacking. Because selection pressure on a functional gene should result in a limited mutation rate, the survey of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) among the human population is
a way to evaluate functional constraints on these genes.
Using this approach, we had previously demonstrated
that one postulated candidate for a role in placentation,
namely the highly-expressed erv3/HERV-R envelope gene
carries a homozygous stop mutation resulting in a severe
protein truncation in 1% of individuals of caucasian origin, which strongly suggests that it is not necessary for any
fundamental placental function [14]. The unexpectedly
low number of still coding envelope genes present in the
human genome [6] now allows a comprehensive analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/117

of such genes to be performed, in order to assess their possible physiological and/or physiopathological role. Here,
we analysed the SNP level of the 12 coding env genes
present in the human genome that could be characterized
by this approach, together with their conservation among
the orthologous genes that can be identified in primates.
The two series of data are consistent with a role beneficial
to the host for some of the genes, whereas others are likely
to be subjected to progressive inactivation. In both cases,
the identified SNPs should be useful tools to evaluate the
possible role of these genes as "susceptibility genes" in
several human pathologies where HERVs have been suspected to be involved.

Results
Structure and PCR-amplification of the fully coding HERV
envelope genes
Retroviral envelope genes are 2 kb-long sequences with no
introns, that are located in the 3' domain of proviral elements (see Figure 1A for the genomic structure of a provirus and Figure 1B and 1C for the description of the
envelope gene and its product). Endogenous retroviruses
being in most cases highly reiterated elements (see Table
1), the 3' PCR primers for env gene amplification had to
be placed downstream of the provirus end to specifically
amplify the family member of interest, whereas the 5'
primer was placed upstream of the env MET initiation
codon (see Figure 1A). Among the 16 coding env genes
that we had previously identified [6], 12 could be subjected to a systematic search for SNPs, including 3 out of
the 6 HERV-K(HML-2) coding env genes (K1, K2, K4), 2
out of the 3 HERV-H coding env genes (H1 and H3), and
the coding env genes of the F(c)1, F(c)2, T, W, R, R(b) and
FRD families. Three HERV-K(HML-2) env genes could not
be PCR amplified: the first one (envK3) is located in the
centromeric region of chromosome 19, and its provirus is
surrounded by stretches of repeated sequences, thus precluding the use of specific primers; the other two (envK5
and envK6) belong to proviruses present only in a fraction
of the caucasian population [15], with a low allele frequency (0.19 and 0.04, respectively), thus precluding a
statistically significant SNP study to be performed (unless
a pre-selected population was used). It is noteworthy that
proviruses K1, K2 and K4 have also been recently demonstrated to be polymorphic, since they exist in some individuals as a solo Long Terminal Repeat (LTR), devoid of
internal sequences [16]. Yet, the allele frequencies of the
complete provirus forms are high (0.72, 0.97 and 0.89,
respectively), thus allowing an SNP study. Finally,
sequence data for one of the 3 HERV-H coding env genes
studied (i.e. envH2) yielded multiple sequence profiles
(possibly due to the parasitic amplification of another
member of the HERV-H family) and could not be analyzed further. The list of the 12 fully coding env genes that

SNP of the human coding envelope genes and haplotype
analysis
The 12 HERV coding env genes were PCR-amplified for 91
healthy Caucasian individuals, and each PCR product was
directly sequenced without cloning. The identified SNPs
are positioned on the protein sequences in Figure 2, and
the number and nature of the variations (synonymous
[i.e. silent] versus nonsynonymous [i.e. leading to an
amino acid change] substitutions, stop or insertion/deletion [indel] mutations) are given in Figure 3. The complete list and detailed features – including frequencies – of

the identified SNPs is available in additional data file 1. As
illustrated in Figure 2 and 3, the number of SNPs for the
12 env genes varies significantly depending on the gene,
but their distribution along the envelope sequences seems
to be random. The number of SNPs per kb varies from 1
(for envW) to 10 (for envT). Studies on SNPs in intragenic
regions of the human genome disclose average densities
varying from 0.8 to 5 SNPs per kb [17,18]. These studies
also provide an estimate of the average ratio of synonymous versus non-synonymous SNPs, which is close to 1
in coding regions, whereas it is close to 0.5 in pseudogenes [17,18]. For the env genes, provided that the SNP
number is high enough to validate this ratio (thus exclud-

ing envFRD, envW, envF(c)1, envH1 and envH3), it ranges
from 0.11 for envR(b) to 0.66 for envT, close to the pseudogene ratio.
Based on the number of nonsynonymous and indel mutations, a hierarchy among the endogenous coding env
genes can be established, with the envW, envFRD and
envF(c)1 genes being the most conserved (see also [19]),
and the envK1, envK2, envT, envR, envR(b), and envF(c)2
genes being affected by numerous mutations, including
mutations resulting in truncation of the protein due to
frameshifting or generation of stop codons. There is no
correlation between the number of SNPs and the "age" of
the corresponding gene in the primate lineage. This is
clearly illustrated in Figure 3, where the env genes have
been ordered according to the date of entry of each corresponding provirus into the host genome as previously
determined via an analysis of the orthologous loci
throughout evolution (reviewed in [4]). For instance, the
env genes of the HERV-K(HML-2) family are human-specific, i.e. are present in the genome of primate since less
than five million years (Myrs), whereas envR(b) and envFRD have entered the genome of the common ancestor of
Old World and New World monkeys more than 40 Myrs
ago. For the envFRD gene, which is among the "oldest" env
genes, only 4 SNPs are found, whereas for the "recent" env

genes of the HERV-K(HML-2) family, the SNP number
can be as high as 16. Although the lack of correlation
between the "age" of the genes in the primate lineage and
the numbers of SNPs is not unexpected taking into
account the occurrence of "bottlenecks" giving rise to
founder effects during the evolution of the human population, what remains surprising is the important variability of the number and "severity" of SNPs among the env
genes. This should be a strong indication for a differential
selection pressure exerted on these genes (see below).
A further characterization of the SNPs, including genotype
distribution, haplotype frequency, and linkage disequilibrium was performed (additional data files 1, 2 and 3). The
genotype distributions are compatible with a HardyWeinberg equilibrium, except for some positions on the
HERV-K1 (HERV-K1_44, HERV-K1_133, HERV-K1_403,
HERV-K1_482, HERV-K1_651, HERV-K1_673, HERVK1_2144), HERV-K4 (HERV-K4_292, HERV-K4_369,
HERV-K4_382, HERV-K4_586) and HERV-F(c)1 (HERVF(c)1_122, HERV-F(c)1_226, HERV-F(c)1_235) env
genes, consistent with recent integration of these elements
in the primate lineage (see Figure 3). Haplotype frequencies were estimated for each gene based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [20] for haplotypes
with frequency estimates >1%. The results are summa-

characterize further the consequences of the identified
SNPs on the fusogenic function of the encoded proteins.
To do so, we PCR-amplified the genomic DNAs of individuals carrying the corresponding SNP alleles, with primers allowing the cloning of the env genes in appropriate
expression vectors. The fusogenic function was then
assayed as in [12], using two different cell lines for fusion
(Figure 4). As illustrated in the figure, no difference can be
observed between the four haplotypes of each of the env
genes tested. This, together with the low SNP level for the
two genes, is a strong indication for selection of a "function" associated with the corresponding proteins.

rized in additional data file 2. The three most frequent
haplotypes for each env gene represent >80% of all the
haplotypes, suggesting that these regions have a low
recombination rate. A linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot
was generated (additional data file 3) with pairwise LDs
measured between each pair of polymorphisms using the
D and D' methods (see materials and methods). As
expected, the majority of high LD values occur within the
env genes, and the LDs calculated between SNPs of different HERV env genes is low. Low LDs were obtained as well
for env genes located on the same chromosome, i.e. for
HERV-F(c)2, HERV-K2, HERV-R, HERV-W (on chromosome 7) and for HERV-H1 and HERV-H3 (on chromosome 2; 10 Mb apart). These observations suggest an
independent evolution for each env gene.
Among all the coding env genes, envW and envFRD are the
only two genes with a clearly identified functional property, i.e. the capacity to generate cell-cell fusion [10,12].
This property – most probably associated with its role in
placentation, see the Background section – was used to

Interspecific sequence conservation
The data regarding the orthologous genes that can be
found in primates for each of the presently studied human
env genes are given in Figure 5. Some of the orthologous
primate env genes had been previously cloned and
sequenced ([19] for envW, [21] for envFRD, [22] for envR
and [23] for envF(c)1). Others have been PCR-amplified
and tested using a direct coupled in vitro transcription/
translation assay to determine their coding status ([24] for
the 3 envH and this study for envT, envF(c)2 and envR(b),
see Materials and Methods). As illustrated in the figure, a
first important outcome is that only three env genes have
been maintained in a fully coding state throughout evolution, i.e. envFRD (7/7 lineages), envW (5/5 lineages) and
envR (5/5 lineages) which, interestingly, correspond to the
three env genes highly expressed in the placenta. Secondly,
as observed for the human SNP analysis, there is no correlation between the "age" of the gene in the primate lineage and its coding status: the latter three env genes are
among the "oldest" ones, whereas three other env genes
(envH3, envT and envF(c)1) are fully coding in only one
non-human lineage, and the others are only coding in the
human lineage.

Discussion
The present investigation of the fully coding human env
genes, including the human SNP search and the analysis
of the coding status of the identified primate orthologs,
pinpoints two of these genes – namely envFRD and envW
– that disclose the characteristic features of a gene subjected to a functional constraint, i.e. low polymorphism
and maintenance of an open reading frame during evolution. Interestingly, these two genes are highly – and specifically – expressed in the placenta, and possess a wellcharacterized fusogenic function which led to the proposal that they are bona fide genes that have been co-opted
by the host for a physiological function related to placenta
physiology [10,12,13,19]. Among the other genes, envR is
of interest since as with the two former genes it is highly
expressed in the placenta and has maintained its fully coding status in all species since its entry into the primate lineage. Yet, the SNP analysis discloses a severe

polymorphism – including a premature stop codon –
indicating that the preservation of an open reading frame
during evolution should not be considered as a sufficient
criterion to assign a biological function. The other genes
are not conserved in a fully coding state in all the primate
branches where they are present and/or disclose a severe
polymorphism (with in several cases occurrence of a premature stop codon for some allelic forms).
Another hallmark of the presence of a functional constraint on a gene is a low nonsynonymous/synonymous
substitution ratio (Ka/Ks) for orthologous genes found in
other species. A bona fide gene with a cellular function

should be under purifying selection, which prevents deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions from being fixed
and usually does not affect synonymous substitutions,
leading to Ka/Ks ratios <1, whereas a gene under genetic
drift (e.g. a pseudogene) has a Ka/Ks ratio close to unity
(reviewed in [25]). Such an analysis has already been performed for the envFRD and the envW genes. The mean
ratio for all pairwise comparisons was 0.37 for envFRD
[21], demonstrating the existence of a selective pressure.
For envW, the corresponding ratio was 0.8 [19], precluding definite conclusions (yet, a subsequent study on envW
identified a region of the gene with a lower ratio compatible with a functional constraint specifically exerted on

that domain [26]). We have calculated the Ka/Ks ratios for
the other env genes, when nucleotide sequences of their
orthologs were available (data not shown). These ratios
were found to be heterogeneous for a given env gene, with
values ranging from 0.23 to 1.17, again precluding any
definite conclusion to be drawn.
According to the present analysis of intra- and interspecific variability of the env genes, one is led to conclude that
most probably only two among the twelve studied env
genes are likely to be involved in an essential human
physiological function, whereas the others would be on
their way to conversion into pseudogenes. The presence of
a reading frame still open in human for the latter genes
may appear intriguing, but one has to keep in mind that
they belong to multicopy HERV families, and as such one
of the element could have remained open just by chance,
without any purifying selection, since even under completely neutral drift it takes time for a sufficient number of
mutations to transform a gene into a pseudogene. Along
this line, it is of interest to mention the study by Zhang
and Webb on the primate V1R pheromone receptor genes,

for which there were approximately 140 copies in the
genome of the common ancestor of Old World monkeys
and hominoids, whereas the human genome has only five
V1R genes that retained an ORF. Examination of the
orthologous genes in primates showed that none of the
five genes kept an intact ORF in all of the apes. Furthermore, for the orthologous sequences with an intact ORF,
Ka/Ks ratios were close to unity. The intraspecific variation
of these five human genes was also assessed, and for two
of them an allelic form generating a premature stop codon
was found. Altogether, the authors concluded that there
were no functional constraints on these genes since before
the separation of hominoids and Old World Monkeys
(approximately 23 Myrs ago) and that they were in the
process of pseudogeneization in those primate species
[27]. Another possible explanation for the "neutral" conservation of an open reading frame for an HERV env gene
without any selection pressure from the host could be
related to the relatively autonomous status of these parasitic elements, and be associated with the persistence of
active retroviral elements responsible for the maintenance

– by a reiterated infection process – of some of the HERV
families (e.g. [23,28]).
In any case, it appears clearly that conservation of an env
gene with a coding status cannot be taken as the sole criterion for a possible function to the benefit of the host,
with only the envW and envFRD genes emerging from the
present study as possible bona fide genes. Yet, this does not
mean that the other env genes cannot have any effect in
humans. Indeed, the present analysis only indicates that
they are not under stringent purifying selection, in terms
of evolution, but they still could be involved in pathologies – such as tumors or auto-immune diseases – not deleterious to the species because they occur late in the life of
the individuals. One should keep in mind that endogenous retroviruses originate from bona fide retroviruses,
and as such might have conserved some of the pathological potency of their progenitors. In this respect, the identified SNPs should be essential tools to determine if this is
indeed the case, via an analysis of their distribution
among selected groups of individuals with a definite
pathology. Along this line, the present data on the envT
gene are of special interest. Indeed, this gene is the only
non-placental env gene found to be highly expressed in a
human tissue – the thyroid – of healthy individuals [6],
and the high level of polymorphism of the gene shown in
this report together with its lack of conservation in primates suggest that it is not involved in any essential physiological process and thus not subjected to purifying
selection. Thanks to the identified SNPs, it can now be
tested whether this expressed gene is involved in a pathological process in humans, among which thyroid tumors
could be select candidates for a systematic search.

Conclusion
The systematic SNP search on fully coding human endogenous envelope genes, combined with an analysis of the
sequence conservation among the orthologs that can be
identified among primates revealed that two genes (envW
and envFRD) can be considered as bona fide genes, and
identified polymorphisms – to a variable extent – in the
other genes. The data are consistent with a physiological
role for the former (also called syncytin-1 and syncytin-2
and likely to be involved in human placentation) and provide tools for the latter, to determine their potential role
in physiological processes and/or their association with
pathological processes in humans – which would be the
consequence of their original retroviral status.

Methods
DNA samples and genotyping
Ninety-one human samples of French Caucasians were
collected from the EGEA (Epidemiological study on the
Genetics and Environment of Asthma) study, among the
controls ascertained without disease. PCR was performed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/117

in mixture containing 25 ng of DNA, 0.3 pmol of each
primer, 6 nmol of each dNTP, 0.75 units of ExTaq and 1×
reaction buffer (Takara). Sequencing reactions were performed according to the Dye Terminator method using an
ABI PRISM® 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Alignment of sequences, SNP discovery and genotyping were performed with Genalys software [29]. The genomic sequences used for the alignment
are envFRD (GenBank accession no. AL136139), envR
(AC073210), envT (AC078899), envW (AC000064),
envFc(1) (AL354685), envFc(2) (AC01222), envH1
(AJ289709), envH2 (AJ289710), envH3 (AJ289711),
envR(b) (AC093488), envK1 (AC074261), envK2
(AC072054), envK4 (AF164615). The sources of the simian genomic DNAs are given in ref [24].
Statistical analysis
The haplotypes frequencies using all polymorphisms for
each gene were estimated with the EM Algorithm [20].
The linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates between pairs
of polymorphisms were obtained by estimating the two
polymorphisms haplotypes frequencies using this algorithm. Computation of D and D' (standard disequilibrium measure and standardized disequilibrium measure)
in additional data file 3 was performed as in ref [30].
Cloning of allelic forms of the W and FRD human env
genes in expression vectors
The FRD and W env genes were PCR-amplified from
human genomic DNAs. PCR was carried out for 25 cycles
(10 sec at 93°C, 30 sec at 56°C, 4 min at 68°C), in 50 µl,
using 100 ng of genomic DNA, 48 pmol of each primer,
350 µM of each dNTP, 0.75 µl Expand long template
enzyme mix and 1× reaction buffer (Roche Applied Science). For the FRD env gene, XhoI-containing primers were
ATCACCTCGAGCACCATGGGCCTGCTCCTGCTGGTTCTCATTC as forward primer and ATCACCTCGAGGCTTCAGTACAGGTGGATA as reverse primer. For the W env
gene, XhoI-containing primers were ATCACCTCGAGAACAACCAGGAGGAAAGTAA as forward primer and
ATCACCTCGAGCTGATCAAGTCGCAAAGC as reverse
primer. Each PCR product was then XhoI-cleaved and
cloned into the phCMV-G vector (described in [12])
opened with XhoI. Allelic forms of the cloned env genes
were assessed by enzymatic restriction. For envFRD, the
1075 G->A transition (aa 359) predicts the loss of a RsaI
site and the 1100 C->T transition (aa 367) predicts the
loss of a BstUI site, and for envW the 413 G->A transition
(aa 138) predicts the gain of a BstXI site and the 920 G->A
transition (aa 307) predicts the gain of a Tsp509I site. As
two allelic forms (FRD359T/367M and W138Q/307S)
were not available among the cloned envelope genes, we
constructed them by exchange of restriction fragments
(BsmI-NotI for FRD359T/367M and KpnI-XhoI for
W138Q/307S).

Cell-cell fusion assay
The human TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (ATCC
CRL8805) and 293T embryonal kidney cells (ATCC
CRL11268) were grown in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum. All cell culture media were supplemented with
streptomycin (100 µg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL).
Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (Invitrogen, 5 µg of DNA for 5 × 105 cells). Fusion
activity of envelope glycoproteins was measured 12 to 36
h after transfection of the cells with the corresponding
expression vectors. To visualize syncytia, cells were fixed
in methanol and stained by adding May-Grünwald and
Giemsa solutions (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion index, which represents
the percentage of fusion events in a cell population is
defined as [(N-S)/T] × 100, where N is the number of
nuclei in the syncytia, S is the number of syncytia, and T is
the total number of nuclei counted.

Characterization of the orthologous envT, envF(c)2 and
envR(b) env gene ORFs from simians
The size of the env gene open reading frame in the primate
loci was evaluated using a direct coupled in vitro transcription/translation assay based on T7 promoter-containing
PCR products as described in [24], which allows to determine the status of both alleles in the same assay.

For the amplification of envT from gorilla and orangutan,
the forward T7 promoter-containing primers were
GCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGTCCTGCTTGGATTCATCAC
and
GCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGTTGGATTCATCACTCCCA, respectively, and the common
reverse flanking primer was CTGAAGGGAGTTCCTCCTAGG. For the amplification of envR(b) from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, Rhesus macaque (Old
World Monkey) and Callithrix jacchus (New World Monkey) the forward T7 promoter-containing primer was
GCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGGATCCACTACACACGATTGA and the reverse flanking
primer was TGTTTTGGGACACCACGAAT. For the amplification of envF(c)2 from chimpanzee and gorilla, the forward
T7
promoter-containing
primer
was
GCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGAATTCTCCATGTGAC and the reverse flanking primer
was GACACTTAATAGTTGCGACA.
The simian env gene sequences were deposited in Genbank with accession numbers AJ862646-AJ862655.
