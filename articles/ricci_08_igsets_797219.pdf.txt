Abstract
Background: DNA encoding for ribosomal RNA (rDNA) is arranged in tandemly-repeated
subunits, each containing ribosomal genes and non-coding spacers. Because tandemly-repeated,
rDNA evolves under a balanced influence of selection and "concerted evolution", which
homogenizes rDNA variants over the genome (through genomic turnover mechanisms) and the
population (through sexuality).
Results: In this paper we analyzed the IGS-ETS of the automictic parthenogen Bacillus atticus and
the bisexual B. grandii, two closely related stick-insect species. Both species share the same IGSETS structure and sequence, including a peculiar head-to-tail array of putative transcription
enhancers, here named Bag530. Sequence variability of both IGS-ETS and Bag530 evidenced a neat
geographic and subspecific clustering in B. grandii, while B. atticus shows a little but evident
geographic structure. This was an unexpected result, since the parthenogen B. atticus should lack
sequence fixation through sexuality. In B. atticus a new variant might spread in a given geographic
area through colonization by an all-female clone, but we cannot discard the hypothesis that B. atticus
was actually a bisexual taxon in that area at the time the new variant appeared. Moreover, a gene
conversion event between two Bag530 variants of B. grandii benazzii and B. grandii maretimi
suggested that rRNA might evolve according to the so-called "library hypothesis" model, through
differential amplification of rDNA variants in different taxa.
Conclusion: On the whole, Bacillus rDNA evolution appears to be under a complex array of
interacting mechanisms: homogenization may be achieved through genomic turnover that stabilizes
DNA-binding protein interactions but, simultaneously, new sequence variants can be adopted,
either by direct appearance of newly mutated repeats, or by competition among repeats, so that
both DNA-binding proteins and repeat variants drive each other's evolution. All this, coupled with
chromosome reshuffling due to sexuality (when present), might drive a quick fixation of new rDNA
variants in the populations.

Background
Ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) encode the RNA scaffold of
the ribosome and thereby perform what likely is the most
basic of all housekeeping functions. Within the rDNA
cluster, each repeat contains one copy of the 18S, 5.8S and
28S rRNA genes, which are separated by several spacers:
two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 (between 18S and
5.8S) and ITS2 (between 5.8S and 28S), an external transcribed spacer (ETS, between promoter and 18S), and an
untranscribed intergenic spacer (IGS), separating each
adjacent rDNA unit. The rDNA unit is transcribed by the
RNA polymerase I (RNA-PolI) as a single 45S precursor
molecule, which is subsequently processed by an ordered
cleavage of the spacers. The rDNA units are organized in
large tandem arrays (rDNA loci), generally located within
one or a few chromosome pairs, where they constitute the
nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). During active synthesis, rDNA loci are associated to the nucleolus (for a review
see [1]).
While the core domain of the rDNA coding region is well
conserved, the IGS is rapidly evolving, so that it has been
used as a marker for identification of closely related species and for quantification of gene flow between populations ([2] and references therein). In eukaryotes, tandemly
repeated multigene families, like rDNA, undergo a peculiar pattern of evolution known as "concerted evolution"
[3]: as a consequence of this, the repeats show a higher
sequence homogeneity within a species (or population)
than between species (or populations). This pattern is
achieved through two independent mechanisms known
as homogenization (i.e. the spreading of a variation to the
whole repeat array) and fixation (i.e. the fixation of the
variant within a taxonomic unit). Homogenization is
achieved through several genomic turnover mechanisms,
such as unequal crossing-over and gene conversion, while
fixation is a by-product of the chromosome reshuffling
due to sexual reproduction [3].
Despite the presence of molecular mechanisms that
homogenize the ribosomal arrays, variations in rDNA
have been commonly observed both within and among
populations of several species. This variation is both
quantitative and qualitative, the former consisting in a
redundancy of rDNA copies and in the number of loci per
genome, the latter being typically due to the occurrence of
regulatory sub-repeats within the rDNA cluster [4]. Actually, the IGS contains the RNA-PolI promoter and other
important regulatory elements, such as terminators,
spacer promoters and enhancers. As a consequence, the
IGS region may show a marked variation in length, due to
the redundancy of those functional elements (repeats)
[5,6]. Moreover, a higher number of duplicated regulatory
elements has been related to an increased rate of rDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/278

transcription, which seems to play an adaptive role ([2]
and references therein).
While the overall structural organization of the RNA-PolI
machinery is comparable in all eukaryotes, the regulatory
repeats are quite variable within each species, and hardly
comparable between species, so that the region associated
with the rDNA transcription promoter is generally species-specific (i.e., the RNA-PolI complexes of one species
fail to transcribe the rRNA genes of another) ([7] and references therein). Consequently, IGS and RNA-PolI transcription factors seem to co-evolve in a species-specific
way; therefore, this appears as a good candidate system for
analyses on evolutionary co-adaptation of gene complexes [8]. As a matter of fact, selection must be taken into
account to understand rDNA dynamics, so that, on the
whole, the evolution of rDNA clusters is likely under a
balanced influence of selection and "concerted evolution". In more detail, selection likely acts differently, the
coding regions being more likely under purifying selection, whereas the IGS may experience more relaxed selective pressure [4].
Then, the repeated organization of rDNA would allow the
spreading of new variations trough the mechanisms of
genomic turnover, as well as the sexual reproduction
could allow to fix them in the reproductive units (i.e.
"concerted evolution"). In this scenario, any mutation in
the controlling region, which would produce a better
interaction to an essential transcription factor, should be
selected for and fixed by unequal crossing over and gene
conversion events during gametogenesis, as well as in
somatic cells trough mitotic recombination [9]. As a consequence of those mechanisms, the rDNA clusters, as well
as their dedicated transcription machinery, would experience rapid evolutionary changes, which could lead to a
rapid evolution of post-mating isolation mechanisms. All
that considered, the rDNA cluster represents a good candidate for studies on speciation. With this in mind, we
started a characterization of the rDNA cluster of the Mediterranean genus Bacillus, which comprises two bisexual
species (Bacillus grandii and Bacillus rossius), three unisexual parthenogenetic species (Bacillus atticus, Bacillus whitei
and Bacillus lynceorum), and two hybridogenetic strains
(Bacillus rossius-grandii benazzii and Bacillus rossius-grandii
grandii). On the whole, Bacillus taxa constitute a clear case
of reticulate evolution (i.e. the exploitation of a wide array
of reproductive modes leading to a net of phyletic links)
and provide a good experimental system to analyze the
multifaceted relationships among sexual and metasexual
taxa [10,11].
This paper deals with the description of the IGS-ETS in B.
atticus and B. grandii, two closely related species, as evidenced by mitochondrial and satellite DNA analyses

([10,11] and references therein). B. grandii – a strict bisexual taxon – shows a relic disjunct distribution in Sicily,
and is divided into three subspecies, B. grandii grandii, B.
grandii benazzi and B. grandii maretimi. Unlike B. grandii,
B. atticus – at present an all-female obligate parthenogen
– shows a much wider distribution in the western Mediterranean basin, and forms a complex of three different
karyological (2n = 32; 2n = 34; 3n = 48–51) and allozymic
races, without morphological diversification. Based on
this, B. atticus has been divided into three subspecies,
namely B. atticus atticus, B. atticus carius and B. atticus
cyprius [10,11].
The characterization of Bacillus IGS-ETS, the first known
for a phasmid insect, allowed us to infer about the variability and evolution of this peculiar tandemly-repeated
system, and to compare it to the additional IGS-ETSs
known to date in arthropods. Moreover, patterns of evolution of rDNA repeated sequences in Bacillus could be
easily comparable to what has been observed for Bacillus
pericentromeric satellite DNA. Actually, the Bacillus system represents an intriguing model to investigate how
"concerted evolution" works on repeated sequences,
because the existence of either apomictic and automictic
parthenogens provides a unique opportunity to study the
effects of meiosis and sex in multigene family evolution
[10,11]. In more detail, the automictic parthenogen B.
atticus, although maintaining meiosis and crossing over,
lacks chromosome reshuffling due to sexual reproduction: for this reason, and according to the "concerted evolution" rationale, new variants can easily spread within a
single B. atticus female and her progeny (i.e. a clone of parthenogens), but cannot spread in the whole taxonomic
unit. On the other hand, the bisexual B. grandii, being the
closest relative of B. atticus, represents the perfect counter-

part, since in this species the repeated sequences would
follow the "concerted evolution".

Methods
IGS characterization
Specimens of Bacillus atticus, B. grandii grandii, B. g. benazzi
and B. g. maretimi were collected at several Mediterranean
locations. Taxa, localities and sample acronyms are
reported in Table 1.

Field-collected specimens were stored at -80°C. Total
genomic DNA was isolated from somatic tissues with a
standard phenol-chloroform protocol.
Since we didn't have any specific PCR primer to amplify
the whole rDNA cluster, we decided to proceed with a
wide restriction enzyme screening using the following
enzymes: Taq, Alu, Sma, Ava, HpaI, HpaII, ClaI, SstI, StuI,
CfoI, HhaI, MspI, DraI, HincII, XbaI and PstI. Such exploratory restriction analysis was performed on specimens of
B. atticus from Castel di Tusa (Italy), Neraida (Greece) and
Israel. XbaI produced a ladder-like pattern (the shorter
fragment at about 350 bp, here referred to as XbaI350),
while PstI produced two main fragments, a small one of
530 bp and a high molecular weight one of 5.5 kb (here
referred to as, respectively, PstI530 and PstI5500). The ladder-like pattern of the XbaI fragments evidenced that this
sequence is tandemly repeated. Total genomic DNA from
B. atticus and B. grandii specimens (see Table 1) were then
digested using PstI in order to obtain PstI530 and PstI5500
fragments.
Fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis
and transferred into a nylon membrane by Southern blotting. Two probes were used for hybridization: the first was
the XbaI350 fragment, the latter was a PCR-obtained por-

tion of the 18S gene (5'-end), amplified with the following universal primers: 18S-s22(F) 5'-TAATGATCCTTCCG
CAGGTTCA-3'; 18S-A1984(R) 5'-TCCCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTA-3', using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase
according to manufacturer's instructions. The probes were
digoxigenine-labeled and hybridization was performed at
65°C accordingly to DIG DNA Labeling and Detection
Starter Kit I (Roche); filters were washed with low stringency buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS), corresponding to
~80% sequence similarity between probe and target.
The fragments XbaI350, PstI530 and PstI5500 from B. atticus
from Israel (AAT/Isr) were cloned into a pGem-7Zf(+)
plasmid (Promega) vector using the E. coli DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen). 64 PstI530 clones were also
obtained by restriction from B. grandii and B. atticus specimens (see Tab. 1). Recombinant clones were screened by
PCR using M13 universal primers. Some of the obtained
recombinant colonies were purified using SNAP Miniprep
kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Clones were sequenced using M13 universal primers by
Macrogen Inc. The portion upstream the 18S gene of the
PstI5500 fragment was sequenced using "primer walking"
method in B. atticus from Israel (AAT/Isr) (Table 1), and
this allowed us to determine the IGS structure in B. atticus.
The PstI530 fragment was also used as a probe for in situ
hybridization according to [12] on B. atticus chromosomes.
Given the observed structure of the IGS-ETS (see Results),
and to perform a large comparison of IGS-ETSs among
Bacillus species with a reasonable sequencing effort, we
decided not to sequence the whole PstI5500 fragment for all
B. grandii and B. atticus specimens, but to focus our attention on the 3' portion of the IGS and the ETS, from the last
PstI530 repeat and the 5' of the 18S gene (a region here
referred to as 3'IGS-ETS). To obtain these fragments, the
PCR was performed with Herculase (Stratagene) following
the manufacturer's instructions. A primer (Bag(F)-5'ACAGGCAAATGGGAGTTG-3') was designed on the
PstI530consensus sequences. This primer was then coupled
with the 18S universal primer by [13], modified as follows
18i(R)-5'-TTTCTCAGGCTCCCTCTCCGGAATCGAACCCT-3'. The PCR products were amplified and completely
sequenced using the "primer walking" method as
described above. Analyzed specimens and GenBank
Accession numbers are reported in Table 1.
Sequence analyses
All sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL algorithm
of the Sequence Navigator Software (Applera) and corrected by eye. Phylogenetic analyses on PstI530 and 3'IGS-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/278

ETS were performed using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
using PAUP* v.4.0b [14]. Likelihood scores for each DNA
substitution model were estimated using MODELTEST
and used for subsequent analyses [15]. The best-scored
model was JC+Γ for PstI530 and F81+Γ for IGS-ETS
sequences. Support for each node was obtained using
bootstrap (500 replicates) [16]. Jukes-Cantor nucleotide
distance values and nucleotide composition were calculated with MEGA 4.0 [17]. Nucleotide diversity (Pi) distribution across PstI530 clones and 3'IGS-ETS were calculated
with a 30 and 60 bp sliding window and step size of 15
and 10 bp respectively, using DnaSP program v.4.1 [18].
The conserved and variable regions were considered significant when Pi exceed 2 × SD (standard deviation) the
average Pi, as described in [19].
Secondary structures were analyzed with the MFOLD
server program [20]. To search for the presence of any
internal repeat, the 3'IGS-ETS sequences were analyzed
using the server program REPFIND [21]. The Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool [22] was used to identify
potential promoter sequences.

Results
Endonuclease restriction analysis of Bacillus atticus
showed restriction fragments for XbaI and PstI: XbaI produced a ladder-like pattern, with the shorter band at about
350 bp, (XbaI350), which indicates the presence of a tandemly repeated DNA. PstI produced two main fragments,
one of about 530 bp (PstI530), the other at about 5.5 kb
(PstI5500).
Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1) and sequencing unequivocally revealed that XbaI350 is part of the PstI530 sequence,
henceforth named Bag530.
Southern blot analysis also evidenced that the PstI5500
fragment is part of the ribosomal DNA, containing both
sequences of the 18S gene and Bag530 (i.e. both XbaI350/
PstI530 fragments)(Figure 1). Direct sequencing evidenced
that the PstI5500 fragment in B. atticus from Israel includes
part of the last Bag530 monomer at the 5' end, while at the
3'ends downstream the 18S gene, therefore including the
full ETS sequence (Figure 2). Moreover, in situ hybridization using PstI530 as a probe evidenced that it localizes in
the NOR of B. atticus (data not shown). Bag530 and 3'IGSETS fragments were then sequenced in B. atticus and B.
grandii subspecies, as reported in Table 1.
Structural organization of the IGS-ETS in Bacillus
In B. atticus and B. grandii, the average nucleotide content
of 3'IGS-ETS sequences is 52.9% A+T (range 52.5%–
53.8%), while the 374 bp belonging to the 5'-end of the
structural 18S gene show 53.1% A+T content. On the

IGS-ETS region showed the typical basic structure with
both repetitive arrays and non-repetitive sequences.
Repetitive regions are of two main types: a large cluster of
head-to-tail repeats, corresponding to the Bag530 array,
and a twofold 388 bp direct repeat (named Bag388a and
Bag388b respectively) spaced by a 191 bp unique
sequence. From the 3'IGS-ETS alignment (see additional
file 2 data) it is evident that the last monomer of the
Bag530 is differently truncated, namely at the position
280 in B. atticus and at the 260 in B. grandii. The first
unique sequence (590 bp long) characterizes the 5' of the
IGS-ETS, downstream the Bag530 cluster. The Bag388a
repeat is located in the position 871/1258, while the
Bag388b is between 1446/1835. The two Bag388a and
Bag388b repeats are separated by a sequence of 191 bp
and followed by a unique sequence (428 bp long)
upstream the 5' end of 18S.

Southern blot. Southern blot of the PstI restriction pattern
in B. atticus, using XbaI350 (A) and the PCR-obtained 5'-end of
the 18S gene (B) as hybridizing probes. Southern Blot analysis
revealed that: i) XbaI350and PstI530 cross-hybridize, with
XbaI350being part of the PstI530 fragment (also tested by subsequent sequencing); ii) PstI530 is a tandemly repeated
sequence (* = PstI530 dimer; ** = PstI530 trimer), as also supported by XbaI350restriction pattern (not shown); iii) 18S
PCR probe and XbaI350 hybridize with PstI5500, so they are
associated; iv) the PstI5500 band is the rDNA cluster, since it
hybridizes to the 18S probe (also checked by subsequent
sequencing).

whole the average length of the 3'IGS-ETS is 2583 bp,
including 347 bp of the 18S gene (see additional file 1
material for 3'IGS-ETS alignment and annotation).
Figure 2 summarizes the structure of the IGS-ETS region in
Bacillus, as determined by sequencing the PstI5500 and
3'IGS-ETS fragments. The exact position of 5' end of 18S
was established by aligning Bacillus sequence to the 18S
sequence of Blattella germanica [GenBank:AF005243]. The

Although the boundary between the IGS and ETS has not
being actually determined, we found a motif similar to the
transcription start point (tsp) sequence of other arthropods, downstream the Bag530 cluster. The observed motif
(5'-TATATTAGAGGGA-3') well matches to the promoter
consensus sequence (5'-TATA>TANGRRRR-3') of several
arthropods (see additional file 3 data; [23]), and it has
been also confirmed by using the Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool, which predicted the same sequence
(5'-TTTTGGGTATATTAGAGGGA-3') with a score of 0.93.
Assuming that we did find the real gene promoter, ETS is
therefore 1736 bp long in B. atticus and 1727 bp long in
B. grandii. This length is quite different from what typically found in other arthropods, where the ETS regions are
usually 500–1000 bp long [2], with few exceptions such
as Daphnia pulex (1280 bp) [23].
The Bag530 repeat
As evidenced by restriction analysis and sequencing, the
IGS region of Bacillus is characterized by an arrays of headto-tail tandemly-repeated Bag530 repeats. In this study we
sequenced 64 Bag530 repeats obtained from restriction
analysis from B. grandii and B. atticus (see Table 1 for
details). Bag530 consensus sequence of 531 bp was
obtained by aligning the 64 sequences; we observed a
total of 42 indels, 11 of which representing a large deletion in all B. grandii grandii clones (see additional file 3
data). Average sequence length is 516 bp, with variants
ranging from 505 bp (GG/Cag137-c2) to 520 bp (GB/
Tbe4-c4 and c5).

Closer sequence examination revealed that Bag530
repeats could be further divided into three shorter subunits of 119 bp (A), 276 bp (B) and 120 (A'), respectively:
A and A' subunits showed 73.2% of sequence similarity
between them. Due to the tandemly-arranged structure of
Bag530, and to the fact that repeat boundaries are usually

The IGS-ETS of Bacillus stick insects
The IGS-ETS of Bacillus stick insects. Schematic drawing of the IGS-ETS structure of Bacillus stick insects. The IGS region
is characterized by a large array of tandemly repeated head-to-tail sequences, here named Bag530, that are proposed to be
RNA-PolI enhancers. Downstream the last Bag530 sequence, the transcription start point (tsp) mark the IGS-ETS boundary.
Redundant tsp sequences are also found in each Bag530 enhancer. The ETS show a twofold 388 bp direct repeats (Bag388a and
Bag388b), with an unknown regulatory function. Sequenced fragments are reported in gray: fragments obtained by PstI restriction analysis (PstI530 and PstI5500) are marked with gray rhombs (᭜); 3'IGS-ETS fragment, obtained by PCR, is marked with gray
circles (●).

defined arbitrarily by the restriction site, we could argue
that the functional sequence of Bag530 subrepeats should
actually be B-A'-A, because the last Bag530 monomer of
the array appears to be truncated just downstream the A
subrepeat (see above). Moreover, a putative promoter
sequence (5'-TATATAGGGGGT-3') occurs in each of the
Bag530 repeats, suggesting that these sequences are actually spacer promoters. This hypothesis is also supported
by the presence of a palindromic motif of 28 bp in each
repeat (5'-CCCGGCGATCGAGGCCTCGATCGCCGGG3'), 88 bp upstream the putative spacer promoter
sequence. In fact, the local fold symmetry created by the
palindrome is thought to provide the binding site for
DNA-binding proteins that are often dimeric, like the UBF
factor involved in the machinery of the RNA-PolI [24].

Variability of 3'IGS-ETS and Bag530 sequences
In the automictic parthenogen B. atticus the overall mean
distances value of 3'IGS-ETS is 0.010 ± 0.002. The distance
values among the distinct allozymic and karyological
races (see Background) show the same order of magnitude
when comparing B. atticus cyprius vs.B. atticus carius (0.016
± 0.003) and B. atticus cyprius vs. B. atticus atticus (0.012 ±
0.002), while between B. atticus atticus and B. atticus carius
the value is lower (0.007 ± 0.001). On the other hand, the
bisexual B. grandii shows a nearly 6-fold higher overall
3'IGS-ETS distance value (0.058 ± 0.005) when compared
to the unisexual B. atticus. Comparing the different B.
grandii subspecies among themselves, the distance values

The pattern of overall variability of Bag530 evidenced in B.
atticus unisexuals is considerably lower to that of the sexual B. grandii (0.018 ± 0.003 and 0.045 ± 0.006, respectively). The values of variability between B. atticus
subspecies are: B. atticus cyprius vs.B. atticus carius (0.022 ±
0.005), B. atticus cyprius vs. B. atticus atticus (0.018 ±
0.003), B. atticus atticus and B. atticus carius (0.019 ±
0.003). Comparing the B. grandii subspecies, the distance
values are: B. grandii maretimi vs. B. grandii benazzi (0.021
± 0.005), B. grandii benazzi vs. B. grandii grandii (0.072 ±
0.011), and B. grandii grandii vs.B. grandii maretimi (0.078
± 0.012).

Variability is not evenly distributed along the 3'IGS-ETS
sequence: the sliding window analysis evidenced that
nucleotide diversity progressively drops when approaching the 18S gene, which is likely due to selective sweep
(Figure 3A). Moreover, where the putative tsp gene promoter was located, the only observed variation involves a
single substitution (G > A) in B. grandii benazzii sample
(5'-TATATTAGAAGG-3'). The observed high level of
sequence conservation in this region gives further evidence about its structural and functional role for transcription.

putative gene promoter and Bag388, respectively. B) Distribution of nucleotide variability along the Bag530 monomers using
sliding window analysis (window size, 30 bp; step size, 15). One (*) and two (**) stars mark the position of the putative promoter and the palindromic sequences, respectively, which occur in each of the Bag530 repeats. Above, the Bag530 monomer
structure has been represented. In both A and B sections, nucleotide positions (midpoint of sliding window) and nucleotide
diversity are reported on the X and Y axes, respectively; average variability of Pi is shown by a solid line, dashed lines represent
average variability ± 2 SD (standard deviation).

An homogeneous range of variability was found within
the populations of B. atticus atticus (Paleochora, 0.013 ±
0.004; Castel di Tusa, 0.012 ± 0.003 and Israel, 0.015 ±
0.003) and B. atticus carius (Neraida, 0.009 ± 0.003) and
B. atticus cyprius (Episkopi, 0.009 ± 0.002). Also within B.
grandii grandii and B. grandii benazzi,Bag530 has similar
levels of variability (0.010 ± 0.003 and 0.007 ± 0.002,
respectively), while B. grandii maretimi showed a distance

value equal to 0.015 ± 0.003, so that this subspecies seems
at the first glance to be more variable than the others.
However, it should be noted that such higher value is
mainly due to a single Bag530 clone, only GM/Mar1-c3
(see Discussion): excluding it from the analysis, the level
of variability falls to the value observed for B. grandii grandii and B. grandii benazzi (0.010 ± 0.003).

It is interesting to note that sequence variability is not uniformly distributed in Bag530: two minima fall within the
B subunit, one in the region including the palindromic
motif of 28 bp (see above), and the other in the region
including the RNA-PolI promoter (Figure. 3B). Actually,
the promoter-like sequence shows no variation among all
clones, as it has been observed in other organisms. It has
been supposed that this sequences have the potential to
form strong secondary structures suggesting that the
region may be under functional constraints.
Phylogenetic analysis
Neighbor Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum
Likelihood trees based either on Bag530 clones or 3'IGSETS sequences showed the same basic topology, with
clones/sequences of B. atticus and B. grandii falling into
two major distinct clades, well supported by bootstrap
values. Here, for brevity, we report only Maximum Likelihood trees.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/278

Trees based on Bag530 sequences (Figure 4A) showed two
major distinct clades: one is given by B. grandii sequences,
the other including B. atticus. Within B. atticus, clones
grouped into two well-supported clusters: the first
includes Bag530 clones of specimens collected in the western part of the species range (B. atticus carius and B. atticus
atticus from Italy and Greece), while the second includes
clones from specimens living in the Eastern Mediterranean (B. atticus cyprius from Cyprus and B. atticus atticus
from Israel). Within each of the two B. atticus clusters,
clones are completely intermingled, without any hint of
geographical or population trend.
The B. grandii clones fall into three distinct clades, one for
each subspecies, with B. grandii benazzi and B. grandii
maretimi being more related. A single clone obtained from
B. grandii maretimi (GM/Mar1C3) shows a peculiar clustering, being more similar to B. grandii benazzii variants
(Fig. 4A). By comparing clones from B. grandii benazzii
and B. grandii maretimi, 12 diagnostic positions were rec-

gene conversion.

for an exact recognition of the rRNA splicing site. The
stem-loop structure is formed by the conserved rRNA helices H9, H17 and H9' flanking the ETS region [26] (see
additional file 4 material).

The tree based on 3'IGS-ETS sequences (Fig. 4B) shows the
same basic topology as that based on Bag530 clones.

Pattern of evolution of the IGS-ETS repeats and the
"concerted evolution"
The pattern of variability of Bag530 is quite different in B.
atticus and B. grandii. In B. atticus some degree of geographic structure is observed, while B. grandii shows a
more strong geographic and subspecies-specific clustering. This is also confirmed by the whole 3'IGS-ETS
sequence analysis.

Discussion
Structure of the IGS in Bacillus
The molecular characterization of the IGS-ETS region
showed that Bacillus atticus and B. grandii share the same
basic structure and sequence (Fig. 2), with only minor variations; this result strongly supports the close phylogenetic relationship between the two species, as already
indicated by previous mitochondrial and allozyme analyses ([10] and references therein).

As already mentioned, IGS-ETS sequences are fast evolving, and sequence homologies can be quickly lost; however, the observed structure of Bacillus IGS-ETS maintains
several characteristics in common with other Metazoans.
In detail, several organisms, such as Xenopus, Daphnia,
mouse, rat, hamster, etc. ([5,6], and references therein)
show tandem repeated sequence arrays downstream the
28S gene: for those the role of RNA-PolI transcription
enhancers has been proposed [5]. Bacillus IGS shows
repetitive elements of two main types: a large cluster corresponding to the Bag530 sequences and the twofold
Bag388 direct repeat. Downstream the Bag530 cluster, a
conserved putative promoter sequence has been found,
which could represent the RNA-PolI promoter, and the
same promoter is also present in each Bag530 repeat.
Therefore we are quite confident in interpreting the
Bag530 repeats as RNA-PolI enhancers.
Although no real sequence similarity could be detected,
IGS enhancers must share the same mechanism of action,
which likely is in their secondary structure; for instance, it
has been observed that Xenopus enhancers work very well
in mammals and in plants. Because of this common
action, coupled with no obvious sequence similarity,
enhancers could function as the binding sites of a common transcriptional factor, which most likely is the UBF
(for a review see [5,6], and references therein).
The presence of the Bag383a and Bag383b repeats in the
ETS appears to be unique of Bacillus so, although they
might have some sort of regulatory significance, nothing
more precise can be stated at present.
Finally, the Bacillus rRNA at the junction between ETS and
18S show the ability to form stem-loop structures, as
observed in Drosophila melanogaster [25] and Apis mellifera
[25], thus suggesting that this feature is likely important

In more detail, a few Bag530 and 3'IGS-ETS variants are
present in B. atticus, although, in theory, the absence of
the homogenizing force of sexuality would permit the
maintenance of many divergent variants in unisexuals.
Moreover, Bag530 and 3'IGS-ETS sequences evidenced the
presence of two clusters in B. atticus, respectively including eastern (Cyprus and Israel) and western populations
(Italy and Greece), regardless of subspecies, allozymic race
or karyotype they belong to (see Table 1).
As a matter of fact, the presence of a slight geographic
structuring of B. atticus Bag530 might be considered as an
unexpected result, since, according to the "concerted evolution" rationale, the automictic B. atticus lacks chromosome reshuffling coupled with Mendelian reproduction,
and this should prevent "spreading" and "fixation" of variants in the taxonomic unit. In Bacillus Bag320 satellite
DNA the lack of either geographic or racial clustering was
explained this way [27].
How can we explain this result for Bag530? First of all, it is
relevant to remember that different kinds of selective pressures on tandemly repeated arrays produce different background in which molecular drive is fixing newly occurring
variants. Although "concerted evolution" applies to IGSETS too, a substantial proportion of newly arisen variants
may be eliminated by selection, because this region contains promoters and enhancers interacting with RNA-PolI
machinery [28]. This would likely turn in the low variability observed, even in the absence of the homogenizing
contribution of sexuality. Compared to rDNA, the satellite
Bag320 family of Bacillus likely undergoes a more relaxed
selection, so that unisexuals can maintain more variability
in satellite DNA.
All that considered, we may speculate that the slight geographic structuring of B. atticus IGS-ETS might be an outcome of geographically-based co-evolution of the IGS-ETS
RNA-PolI machinery. With this in mind, we still need to
explain how newly arisen IGS-ETS variants might spread
in a large geographical area, in absence of chromosome

reshuffling due to sexual reproduction. We can suggest
that populations carrying the new variant might have
spread from a founding clone of B. atticus females, in
which the new variant has been fixed by selection and
genomic turnover mechanisms allowed by automictic
parthenogenesis. However, another possibility must be
mentioned, i.e. that by the time the new variant appeared,
B. atticus was still a bisexual taxon. This hypothesis is not
unrealistic, since it has been proved that in Sicily, at the
time that the tri-hybrid B. lynceorum arose from B. rossius
females (about 1 Myr ago), B. atticus males had to be
present to form the hybrid [11]. At present, however, B.
atticus males have never been observed in nature,
although the species has been intensively collected.
In B. grandii, the pattern of variability of Bag530 and 3'IGSETS might be explained by bisexuality acting as a driving
force on repeated sequence homogenization/fixation in
the same genomic pool (molecular drive), coupled with
the co-evolution of the rDNA arrays within each gene
pool. The result is a clear racial clustering of the Bag530
repeats, which is fully in line with what has been observed
for the Bag320 Satellite DNA family [27]. Moreover, the
invention of a recombinant clone between two Bag530
variants of B. grandii benazzii and B. grandii maretimi must
be an outcome of the coexistence of both variants in the
same genome, either now in the genome of B. grandii
maretimi, or in a common ancestor of the subspecies,
which are nowadays no longer sympatric. A very similar
recombination event has been observed in the Bag320 satellite DNA of B. rossius [29].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/278

ETS itself, might experience the same "expansion-contraction" mechanism described for other repeated DNAs.

Conclusion
All that considered, rDNA might be constrained by a complex array of evolutionary mechanisms: repeats homogenization achieved through genomic turnover mechanism
may stabilize interactions with DNA-binding protein thus
eliminating or limiting the effects of deleterious mutations (stable complex) but, simultaneously, the whole
array could acquire new sequence variants, better fitting
the above mentioned interactions (flexible system). The
co-evolution can in turn be driven in a dual way, either by
direct acquisition of newly mutated repeats, or by competition among repeats that better fit to the above mentioned DNA-proteins interactions. In this way, both DNAbinding proteins and repeat variants would drive each
other's evolution leading to a new protein/DNA pair to
replace the old one [35]. All this, coupled with sexuality
might drive quick fixation of new rDNA variants in populations.

Additional material
Studies on satellite DNAs evidenced the occurrence of the
so-called "library hypothesis" based on the "expansioncontraction" model: related taxa could share low-copy
repetitive DNA sequences that can be specifically amplified in each evolutionary unit, thus becoming highly represented in one taxon while remaining at a low copy
number in the others [30,31]. In agreement with the
"library hypothesis", Mestrovic et al. [32] have recently
proposed that rapid changes in satellite DNA profiles
(within/between single family of satellite DNAs) could be
achieved through replacements of functionally equivalent
repeats of DNA, without affecting the DNA-proteins binding. The existence of specific profiles as a consequence of
copy number changes in a set of satellite DNAs shared by
related genomes was found in species of the insects Palorus
and Pimelia [33,34],Bacillus [29] and in root-knot nematodes [32].

Therefore, the Bag530 GM/Mar1C3 clone might be in line
with the "library hypothesis" of repeated DNA, since the
observed recombination event should have occurred
when both variants were present in the same genome; so
we can speculate that rDNA enhancers, and likely the IGS-
