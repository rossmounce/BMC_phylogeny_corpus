Expression and localization of forkhead
transcriptional factor 2 (Foxl2) in the gonads of
protogynous wrasse, Halichoeres trimaculatus

Abstract
Background: Three-spot wrasse, Halichoeres trimaculatus, is a marine protogynous hermaphrodite fish. Individuals
mature either as initial phase (IP) males or females. Appropriate social cues induce the sex change from IP female
to terminal phase (TP) male. However, the molecular mechanisms behind such a sex change remain largely
unknown. Recently, the forkhead transcription factor 2 (Foxl2) was identified as an essential regulator of vertebrate
ovarian development/function/phenotype. Inspired by this information, we characterized the expression patterns of
Foxl2 in the protogynous wrasse assuming Foxl2 as the female-specific marker in this species.
Methods: First, we clonedFoxl2 cDNA from ovary by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
followed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Next, we analysed expression pattern of Foxl2 messenger
RNA (mRNA) and protein in gonads of different sexual phases by real time quantitative PCR assay and flour
fluorescence immunohistochemical method, respectively. Additionally, we studied the changes in Foxl2 expression
pattern during aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced sex change.
Results: The amino acid sequence (306 AA) of wrasse Foxl2, especially the forkhead domain, shows high identity
with that of other reported teleost Foxl2s. Quite unexpectedly, no sexual dimorphism was observable between the
testes and ovary in the expression pattern of Foxl2. In female phase fish, signals for Foxl2 protein were detectable
in the granulosa cells, but not the theca cells. Transcript levels of Foxl2 in the testes of IP and TP males were
identical to that in the ovaries of females and, further, Foxl2 protein was found to be localized in the interstitial
cells including tubules and Leydig cells. Treatment with AI induced sex change in male gonads and an
up-regulation was seen in the expression of Foxl2 in these gonads.
Conclusions: Unlike in other vertebrates, including teleosts, Foxl2 may have a different role in the naturally sex
changing fishes.

Introduction
Similar to mammals, most of the teleosts are gonochorists;
individuals develop either as males or females and remain
the same sex throughout their lives [1]. However, there
are many hermaphroditic fishes that live in the tropical
and subtropical sea areas [2]. They change their sex from
female to male (protogynous) or vice versa (protandrous)
or both-directions (serial-sex change) [1,2]. Although
numerous studies have described the endocrinological
aspects of sex change in the recent past, knowledge of the

general mechanisms that mediate sex change is still
lacking.
Three-spot wrasse, H. trimaculatus, is one of the protogynous hermaphrodite species [3]. Individuals of this
species mature initially either as males or females. Under
the appropriate social conditions, the initial phase (IP)
males and females change to terminal phase (TP) males.
IP males change only their reproductive status, while IP
females change their sexuality and the gonadal phenotype. We used this species as an experimental animal
model in order to elucidate the physiological mechanism
behind the sex-change as they are abundantly available in
Okinawa, Japan, and they can easily be captured and
handled.

Studies have shown that estrogens (estradiol-17b: E2)
are the key factors in sex change [4]. In protogynous
saddleback wrasse, a rapid decline in the levels of serum
oestrogen was observed before the onset of gonadal sex
change [5]. In three-spot wrasse, blocking oestrogen
synthesis using aromatase inhibitor (AI) induced a complete female-to-male sex change [6,7] and E2 treatments
on IP male induced the sex change in the reverse direction (male-to-female) [8]. Similarly, in the protandrous
black porgy, E2 treatments induced male-to-female sex
change [9] and the use of AI blocked the process of sex
change in this species [10]. Cytochrome P450 aromatase
(P450arom) is the key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to oestrogen [11]. Therefore, in order
to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that
precede sex change it is necessary to examine the factors or genes involved in the regulation of aromatase
expression.
Forkhead transcriptional factor 2 (Foxl2, gene; Foxl2)
is a member of the winged helix/forkhead group of proteins [12]. Recently there have number of ontogenic
expression studies on Foxl2 have been carried out in
vertebrates [12,13]. These studies revealed that Foxl2 is
one of the earliest markers of ovarian differentiation in
vertebrates [14]. As in mammals, aromatase and Foxl2
were found to be co-localized in the adult ovaries of
medaka [15], tilapia [16] and flounder [17] and also in
the immature gonads of these species just after initiation
of ovarian differentiation [18,19]. In tilapia, Foxl2
directly binds to the promoter region of the cytochrome
P450 aromatase (P450arom) gene, resulting in the activation of P450arom transcription [20]. Although studies
on the roles of Foxl2 in sex determination and differentiation among gonochoristic teleosts are increasing,
there is only a limited amount of information available
for Foxl2 in hermaphrodite fishes.
In this study, in order to find clues to the role of
Foxl2 in protogynous hermaphrodite three-spot wrasse,
we cloned wrasse Foxl2 complimentary DNA (cDNA)
and analysed its expression patterns in gonads by real
time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rtq PCR)
assay and fluorescence immunohistochemistry. We also
examined the changes in Foxl2 expression in the gonads
undergoing sex-change in response to AI treatment.

Methods
Experimental fishes and sample collection

Adult three-spot wrasses were collected by roll net from
Sesoko Beach (Okinawa Prefecture, Japan) and then maintained in 500-L tanks with flow-through seawater at the
Sesoko Station (University of the Ryukyus). The sexes of
the fish were determined by applying light pressure on the
abdomen to elicit gamete release [7,8]. Fish which did not
release sperm were regarded as females. TP males were

distinguished from IP males on the basis of body colouration. All the fish were anesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol
(Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) before sampling. After
measuring the total length and body weight the fish were
decapitated. Brain, pituitary, eye, intestine, gill, muscle,
liver, spleen and pieces of the gonads (24.96 ± 4.23 mg)
were dissected out and stored in an RNAlater reagent
(Ambion, TX, USA) at -30°C until the RNA was extracted.
The remainder of the gonads were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for histological analysis. All animal
handling and experiments were conducted in accordance
with our Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(Doubutu-jikken-kisoku, 19.6.26) approved by the University of the Ryukyus.
RNA extraction and isolation of wrasse Foxl2 cDNA

The total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit
with RNase-free DNase kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop
spectrometer. RNA samples were used for cloning and
rtq PCR assay.
One microgram of total RNA from the ovary was
reverse-transcribed using an oligo (dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was
performed using degenerate primers (dn Foxl2-F1:
gagaagmgbctyacgctgtccgg, dn Foxl2-R1: cccartawgagcartgcatcat) designed from the conserved regions of known
Foxl2 sequences from other vertebrates. The amplicon
was T-A ligated into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega, WI,
USA) and sequenced. Based on the sequence information
of the partial complimentary DNA (cDNA) of Foxl2, rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedures were performed in order to isolate the 5’ and 3’ ends of the cDNA
(SMART cDNA library construction Kit; Takara, Shiga,
Japan). The initial PCR amplification in each RACE procedure was followed by a nested PCR. Gene-specific primer
(GSP) sets (5’ RACE: 5GSP1; accaggagttgttcatgaagctggact,
5GSP2; tagttccccttctcaaacatgtcctca, 3’RACE: 3GSP1; agtccagcttcatgaacaactcctggtcg, 3GSP2; atccccaccatgcccagcagctgagcccg) were used in combination with adaptor primers.
Finally, the open reading frame (ORF) of the wrasse Foxl2
was generated from ovarian RNA by RT-PCR with primers targeting the untranslated regions immediately
upstream (actagcatttggactggagttg) and downstream
(ttttgaaatcacaggaatcag) to the ORF. The final PCR product
was subcloned and sequenced in both directions. The PCR
cycle conditions were 30 cycles, with 94°C for 15 s, 50°C
for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s.
Alignment of the amino acid sequences of Foxl2 from
different species was performed using the ClustalW
sequence alignment program. Homology value (percentage of amino acid sequence identity) was calculated by

pair wise alignment. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining (NJ) method [21] and
viewed with TreeViewX (Version 0.5.0). Details of the
program settings are given in the legend for Figure 1.
Quantification of wrasse Foxl2 mRNA expression

Wrasse Foxl2 transcripts in gonads and other tissues
were determined by rtq PCR assay. Samples were
reverse transcribed from 500 ng of total RNA in a 20μL reaction volume using random primers and Ominiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). A 5 ng dose of
cDNA was used for rtq PCR. Assays (in triplicate) were
repeated at least twice. Primer pairs were designed using
Primer3 software [22]. rtq-PCR reactions were performed using SYBR Premix ExTaq (Takara) on the ABI
Prism® 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, PE Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The data of
rtq PCR were analysed using ABI prism 7000 SDS software (version 1.1). The standard copy number of Foxl2
gene was estimated based on molecular weight of plasmid ligated to wrasse Foxl2 ORF region. The copy number of wrasse Foxl2 transcripts per total RNA in gonads
was calibrated by gonad weight. Relative changes in
Foxl2 expression in extra-gonadal tissues were determined using 2-ΔΔCt method [23] with the constitutive
elongation factor 1 a (ef1a) as a normalizing control.
The following primers were applied for rtq PCR: Foxl2
forward, 5’-aagaggagccggtccaggagaa-3’; Foxl2 reverse, 5’gctctcccggatggccatgg-3’; ef1a forward, 5’-aagggagccgatcacttcaa-3; and ef1a reverse, 5’-aatccagcacaggtgcgtaa-3’.
Antibody production

The antigen of wrasse Foxl2 was two oligo-peptides corresponding to the wrasse Foxl2 amino acid sequences;
MMATYPNPEDDAMALMIC and YWEHETKHSALHTRIDI which are situated on N- and C-terminus respectively (Figure 1). After purification of the synthesized
oligo-peptides, Japanese white rabbit (specific pathogenfree) was immunized with these antigens (six times
weekly).
Localization of wrasse Foxl2 protein in gonads by
fluorescence immunohistochemistry

After removal of paraffin and dehydration, the sections
of gonads were washed with phosphate buffered saline.
The sections were treated with 10% normal goat serum
for 10 min to block non-specific binding. Sections were
then incubated with the antibody (1:2000 dilution) for
overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody was detected using
donkey anti-rabbit-IgG-Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) and
DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei of the cells. As a
control, sections were treated with antigen-absorbed primary antibody instead of primary antibody.

Aromatase inhibitor treatments

In order to obtain animals in a transitional phase of sex
change, we induced artificial sex change by AI in accordance with previously described methods [7]. Briefly, the
females were placed in the same aquarium with one
dominant TP male, which would inhibit natural sex
change. Fadrozole (nonsteroidal AI; Novartis Pharma Inc,
Tokyo, Japan) was used as AI in this study. It was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with the fish diet at the dose
of 200 μg/g. AI treatment group fishes were fed with this
diet twice daily for 2 weeks. The control group was fed a
normal diet. The AI treatment experiment was replicated
twice. After the AI treatment, gonads were removed and
fixed in 4% PFA. Sectioned gonads were examined under
a microscope and classified into one of six stages, the
details of which are given elsewhere [24,25].
Stage I: normal female ovary. The fish of this stage
had a gonad containing many mature vitellogenic
oocytes and previtellogenic oocytes. No testicular tissues
were present.
Stage II: degeneration of vitellogenic oocytes. This was
a typical regressed ovary possessing degenerating
oocytes (DO).
Stage III: degeneration of previtellogenic oocytes. Previtellogenic oocytes at the peri-nucleolus stage began to
degenerate following the degeneration of vitellogenic
oocytes.
Stage IV: proliferation of Leydig cells and presumptive
spermatogonia. At this stage, a few DO and cysts of
oocytes at the meiotic prophase still remained in the
lamellae. In contrast to the decreased numbers of oocytes,
there was an increase in number of cells presumed to be
spermatogonia on the periphery of the lamellae.
Stage V: onset of spermatogenesis. Numbers of spermatogonia increased rapidly in the lamellae.
Stage VI: testes just after sex change. Sex change from
female to male was completed by this stage.
Statistical analysis

One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean values,
followed by Turkey-Kramer Multiple comparison test
using PRISM 5.0b software (GraphPad, CA, USA). The
results are presented as means ± standard error of
mean.

Results
Isolation of wrasse Foxl2 and sequence analysis

encoded 306-amino acid proteins. The sequence of
wrasse Foxl2 was submitted to the GenBank (accession
No. AB547448). Figure 1A shows wrasse Foxl2 alignment with other reported Foxl2 of tilapia, flounder,
trout, chicken and mouse. Wrasse Foxl2 was more

In order to determine whether or not there was any sex
difference in Foxl2 expression, we first quantified the levels
of wrasse Foxl2 transcripts in the gonads of different sexual phases using rtq PCR assay (Figure 2). Foxl2 was
expressed not only in the ovary but also IP and TP testes.
The highest expression of Foxl2 was observed in the ovary
of the female. However, no significant difference could be
observed between ovary and testes of different reproductive phases. Transcripts of wrasse Foxl2 were found in the
brain, pituitary, eye, gill and liver and, among these, eye
and liver showed high levels of transcripts in addition to
the gonads. We could not detect Foxl2 transcripts in intestine, muscle and spleen (Figure 3). Expression levels in
these organs were approximately 10-fold lower than that
in the gonads (data not shown). Sexual dimorphism was
not detected in the expression levels of Foxl2 in tissues
other than the gonads.

known as ‘winged helix’ (the family of transcription factor domains), was highly conserved among vertebrates.
Phylogenetic tree of Foxl2 was constructed using zebrafish Foxl1 as outgroup (Figure 1B). Vertebrate Foxl2

In order to investigate changes in Foxl2 mRNA expression in the gonad during sex change, AI treatment was
carried out by feeding adult females (n = 28) with a diet
containing AI. Two weeks of AI treatment produced
gonads in various stages of sex-change (sample number
is mentioned in Figure 5). In contrast, all fishes in control
groups remained as stage I females. Analysis of Foxl2
expression pattern in the gonads during sex-change by
rtq PCR assay revealed that Foxl2 gradually increased
depending on the stage of sex change (Figure 5).

Granulosa cells got separated from DO and migrated
into the oocytes. However, we could not detect positive
signals in these granulosa cells (Figure 6A). Some of the
follicle cells around the oocytes showed signals for
Foxl2 protein at stage II and III (Figure 6B). Strong signals were observed in the inner cell layer of the ovarian
tunica (Figure 6B). At stage IV, positive signals were

around the cysts and interstitial cells in stage V gonad
(Figure 6D).

Discussion
It was previously reported that rainbow trout had two
Foxl2 genes (namely, Foxl2a and Foxl2b) [26], expressed
specifically in the ovary, but displaying different expression patterns during gonadal differentiation. However,
we could find only a single copy of the Foxl2 gene from
wrasse. We also examined the expression level of Foxl2
in the gonads belonging to different sexual phases. As
expected, Foxl2 mRNA was expressed in the ovary and
signals of Foxl2 protein were localized in granulosa
cells, but not in the theca cells. In other teleosts,
P450arom mRNA or protein is located in granulosa
cells and Foxl2 has been shown to regulate the expression of P450arom gene [27-30]. Similarly, wrasse Foxl2
also might be involved in the regulation of P450arom
expression in the ovary of the female, as in tilapia [20],
flounder [17] and other vertebrates [18,31].
A number of studies of several vertebrates have reported
a high expression of Foxl2 exclusively in the ovary [32].

Therefore, Foxl2 is, in general, considered to be a good
marker for ovarian differentiation. However, expression of
Foxl2 was reported in the adult testis of a few species such
as catfish [33], rainbow trout [26], frog [19] and chicken
[18] - although the levels of these expressions were significantly lower than that of the ovary. In stark contrast, no
sex differences were observed in Foxl2 expression in the
gonads of three-spot wrasse. Levels of Foxl2 expression in
the testes of IP and TP males were almost equal to that of
the ovaries in females and, furthermore, Foxl2 proteins
were localized in the interstitial cells including tubules and
Leydig cells in the testis. These results suggest that the
role of Foxl2 in sex-changing wrasse can be quite different
from other gonochoristic vertebrates and that Foxl2 is not
useful as a marker for the detection of ovarian tissue in
three-spot wrasse.
In addition, the tissue distribution analysis revealed
that the brain, pituitary, eye, gill and liver expressed
Foxl2 mRNA is similar to that seen in tilapia [16] and

catfish [33], but the expression levels were lower than
that of the gonads. Expressions of Foxl2 in the brain
and pituitary indicate that Foxl2 might be involved in
the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis. However, no information on the roles of Foxl2 in these tissues has so are
been gathered by any study.
Administration of AI to the females induced sexchange successfully which was a similar result to that
seen in our previous studies [6,7]. Inter-individual variation was high among the AI treatment group in terms of
their responses towards the treatment (judged from differences in the stages of sex-change). Such a high variability might have resulted from the differences between
the fish in their intake of the AI-mixed feed. Unexpectedly, we detected Foxl2 expression in gonads belonging
to all stages of sex-change and the levels increased in
accordance with the progression in testis development.
Foxl2 protein signals were observable in the sex-changing
gonads, similar to those observed in the localization of

steroid producing cells in the saddleback wrasse [34].
These observations indicate that Foxl2 controls the steroid production in the sex-changing gonads. In contrast
to our results, down-regulation of Foxl2 expression has
been reported in sex-changing gonads of trout [26] and
chicken [35] in response to AI treatment. Moreover,
Foxl2 over expression in tilapia has caused testis development in females [20]. A recent report showed that inducible deletion of Foxl2 in the ovarian follicles adult
mouse resulted in an immediate up-regulation of the testicular gene, Sox9, and trans-differentiation of granulosa
cells into Sertoli cells [36]. These studies suggest that
Foxl2 is essential for the maintenance of the ovarian phenotype. Nevertheless, these animals lack Foxl2 expression
in testis. Therefore, up-regulation of Foxl2 in AI-induced
gonads undergoing sex change in wrasse might indicate a
negative feedback - that is, in response to the AI treatment there could be an up-regulation in the levels of
Foxl2 expression to restore the levels of declining
estrogens.
Since AI treatment induced complete sex change,
endogenous oestrogen may not be required for normal
sex change and testis development in three-spot wrasse.
However, this study a high expression of Foxl2 was
observed in the testis, indicating that oestrogen may have
a more important role in the spermatogenesis of this species than previously thought. Further, no significant sexual dimorphism was seen in the expression of oestrogen
receptor in the adult gonads of this species in the different sexual phases [3]. Furthermore, in other wrasse species (Thalassoma duperrey), plasma oestrogen levels were
similar between stage II to VI [5,24]. Recent evidence
obtained from different vertebrates indicates that oestrogen regulates spermatogonial cell renewal by acting on
Sertoli cells in the testis [37]. When the results of our
study and those of previous reports are taken into consideration, it has to be assumed that the role of oestrogen
in spermatogenesis of this species may contradict all the
current understandings about the involvement of oetsrogen in the spermatogenesis of other species.
Our previous study reported that AI-induced and normal testes were similar [7] and the present study also
could not find any histological differences between the
stage VI gonads of AI-induced males and normal males
developed either by maturation of IP males or by sex
reversal of IP females. Therefore, further studies which
emphasise the subtle qualitative differences between the
AI-induced and normal testes are required in order to
justify the disparity seen by the present study in the
levels of Foxl2 between these two categories of gonads.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the expression
pattern of Foxl2 in protogynous wrasse. Foxl2 was

Page 8 of 9

expressed not only in the ovary, but also the testis.
These results suggest that, unlike in other teleosts and
vertebrates, Foxl2 might have a different role and function pertinent to natural sex changing fishes.
