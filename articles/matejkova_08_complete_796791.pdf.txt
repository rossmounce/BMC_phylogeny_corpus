Abstract
Background: Syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum remains the enigmatic
pathogen, since no virulence factors have been identified and the pathogenesis of the disease is
poorly understood. Increasing rates of new syphilis cases per year have been observed recently.
Results: The genome of the SS14 strain was sequenced to high accuracy by an oligonucleotide
array strategy requiring hybridization to only three arrays (Comparative Genome Sequencing,
CGS). Gaps in the resulting sequence were filled with targeted dideoxy-terminators (DDT)
sequencing and the sequence was confirmed by whole genome fingerprinting (WGF). When
compared to the Nichols strain, 327 single nucleotide substitutions (224 transitions, 103
transversions), 14 deletions, and 18 insertions were found. On the proteome level, the highest
frequency of amino acid-altering substitution polymorphisms was in novel genes, while the lowest
was in housekeeping genes, as expected by their evolutionary conservation. Evidence was also
found for hypervariable regions and multiple regions showing intrastrain heterogeneity in the T.
pallidum chromosome.
Conclusion: The observed genetic changes do not have influence on the ability of Treponema
pallidum to cause syphilitic infection, since both SS14 and Nichols are virulent in rabbit. However,
this is the first assessment of the degree of variation between the two syphilis pathogens and paves
the way for phylogenetic studies of this fascinating organism.

Background
Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA) is the causative agent of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease
affecting more than 12 million people worldwide each
year [1]. After a period of decline in the 1990s, the
number of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis has been raising annually since 2000 in the United
States [2]. Sequencing of the 1.14 Mbp genome of the
Nichols strain of TPA in 1998 [3] greatly stimulated study
of this unculturable pathogen. One important direction
not yet developed is use of the Nichols sequence for comparative studies to determine variation between different
syphilis isolates, how representative Nichols is of TPA,
and the genetic differences between closely related
treponemes causing different diseases (e.g. syphilis, yaws,
bejel, pinta). To sample strains on a sufficient scale, rapid,
inexpensive, and highly accurate sequencing methods are
needed. Traditional whole genome shotgun sequencing
methods using dideoxy-terminators (WGS-DDT) are relatively slow and costly to be applied to numerous samples.
Here we sequence a treponemal genome by Comparative
Genome Sequencing (CGS) [4], which provides an alternative to WGS-DDT sequencing of closely related
genomes. CGS was previously used for mutation discovery in viruses [5], in mutagenized laboratory bacterial and
fungal strains [4,6-9], in clinical isolates of bacteria
[10,11], and for whole genome scale comparative studies
[12-14].
The TPA isolate Street Strain 14 (SS14) was isolated in
1977 in Atlanta from a patient with secondary syphilis
[15] who did not respond to erythromycin therapy that
was used because of a penicillin allergy [16]. In vitro testing of SS14 revealed it to be less susceptible to a variety of
antibiotics when compared to Nichols [16]. Nichols strain
was isolated in 1912 in Washington, D.C. from cerebrospinal fluid of the patient with neurosyphilis [17]. Previous
studies (D. Šmajs, G. M. Weinstock, unpublished results)
showed SS14 had all genes of the Nichols genome as
judged by hybridization to a microarray containing PCR
products of all annotated Nichols open reading frames
(ORFs) [18]. To compare these closely related, yet phenotypically distinct strains, we sequenced the SS14 genome
by CGS.

Results
Identification of heterologous regions and sequence
changes between Nichols and SS14 strains
In the first mapping stage of CGS, no regions with significantly stronger labeled SS14 DNA signals were observed,
indicating no increase in gene copy number in the SS14
genome. Regions giving significantly weaker SS14 signals
indicated 1731 candidate regions of variation encompassing 1 or more overlapping oligonucleotide targets. The
sequencing data identified 213 SNPs in the SS14 genome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/76

An additional 17 questionable SNPs were suggested in
repeated sequences of the genome but did not score well
in a SNP uniqueness algorithm [4], and thus could represent false positives due to cross hybridization with the
other repeats. DDT sequencing of 12 such regions
revealed 5 real SNPs, 6 false positives, and one position
with 2 alleles within the SS14 population (intrastrain heterogeneity). Therefore these questionable SNPs were not
included in the final sequence, unless they were verified
by DDT sequencing (data not shown). An additional 62
positions out of the 213 SNPs identified by CGS were
DDT sequenced. 60 SNPs were confirmed (Tables 1, 2, 3
last column) and 2 false positives were found.
1674 out of 1731 candidate regions were identified as
SNPs in the second sequencing stage but there were 57
regions encompassing 124 oligonucleotide targets where
sequence changes could not be determined. These represented possible hypervariable regions with multiple differences from Nichols in the sequencing 29 mers. DNA
regions comprising these sites were grouped into 38 larger
regions (29–1507 bp), amplified by PCR and DDT
sequenced. In 21 of the 38 cases, mostly closely spaced
SNPs and/or short insertions or deletions (indels ranging
from 1 to 7 nts) were found while no changes were seen
in 17 cases (Table 1, column 7), which is in agreement
with data obtained by others [12]. DDT sequencing of
hypervariable regions suggested by the first phase of CGS
identified nucleotide changes in these regions (Table 1,
column 7) and also in the vicinity of these regions, where
results of the first CGS phase suggested no changes (Table
1, column 8), indicating the need for extension of DDT
sequenced regions of at least 100 bp in both directions.
Additional short indels were discovered during DDT
sequencing of regions identified by WGF (Table 3). Altogether, 2 false positive SNPs (data not shown), 19 false
negative SNPs and an additional 16 indels (Tables 1, 3)
were found in these DDT sequenced regions (42,344 bp).
The overall confirmation of data suggests that repeated
regions of the genome are limitations for SNP discovery
and almost half of possible hypervariable regions are false
positive results.
The accuracy of CGS was determined by comparison to
the results of DDT sequencing for 27 regions encompassing 27,141 bp (Table 2). Selection of these regions was
focused on possible variable regions in SS14/Nichols
hybridization experiments (D. Šmajs, G. M. Weinstock,
unpublished results) using a microarray of TPA coding
sequences [18] and thus was not completely random.
These regions included 5 SNPs and no false positive or
false negative SNPs/indels were found. These results indicate an error frequency comparable to or lower than that
of high quality finished DDT sequence.

ORF – open reading frame; nt – nucleotide; SNP – single nucleotide polymorphism; aas described in [3]; bSNPs identified using CGS in these regions
were verified by DDT sequencing.

Assessment of reproducibility of CGS experiments
To test the reproducibility of the method, the genome of
TPA SS14 was sequenced twice with the CGS approach,
using 2 independent DNA isolations from two subsequent inoculations of rabbit testes (i.e. 4950 and 4951,
respectively). When most of the variable genomic regions
were excluded from the analysis (CGS cannot identify
closely spaced SNPs and/or short indels), CGS discovered
198 SNPs in each DNA preparation. The experiments
agreed at 192 SNPs (97%), and 12 SNPs were predicted by
only one CGS experiment. Out of these 12 SNPs, 7 were
found to be real, as shown by DDT sequencing (data not
shown), three loci showed intrastrain heterogeneity in
one of the two SS14 DNA isolations, with one allele identical to the Nichols genome sequence and a second allele
identical to the base change found by CGS. Two SNPs
were predicted falsely, and in both cases the false SNP was
located next to a real SNP. The reproducibility of the CGS
method is thus likely to be limited by the presence of SNP
clusters and influenced by genetically different subpopulations in the test sample.

Physical mapping of treponemal chromosome
To verify the complete sequence of SS14 strain, to screen
for possible discrepancies in cross-reacting repeat regions
(tpr genes) and insertions of unique sequences, WGF was
performed. This physical mapping approach showed the
order of the ORFs along the chromosome is identical to
Nichols genome and 4 large indel regions were identified.
A 64 bp deletion upstream of TP0136 was found by both
CGS and WGF methods. Three additional indels were
found only by WGF, two insertions (between genes
TP0126–TP0127 and within overlapping genes TP0433–
TP0434) and one deletion (in TP0470) (Table 3). A deletion in TP0470 and an insertion in TP0433–TP0434 comprised tandem repeats of 24 and 60 bp, respectively.
Similar analysis of the Nichols strain revealed length differences in genes TP0433–TP0434 compared to the published sequence [GenBank:AE000520] as described
previously [19]. Moreover, intrastrain heterogeneity in the
Nichols strain was observed in regions comprising
TP0126–TP0127 and upstream of TP0136 with one allele
identical to the published sequence. In the Nichols BAC
library [20], similar intrastrain heterogeneity was found in
the vicinity of gene TP0126. This region comprises a 1255

bp insertion between genes TP0126 and TP0127 in SS14
strain. A similar region was previously described in
another syphilitic strain (Chicago, [GenBank:AY587909])
and was found to contain a sequence similar to tprK and
is believed to be recipient site of the tprK conversion [21].
Altogether, three large indels were not detected by CGS.
We suggest probable reasons for this fact are (1) the length
of the repeats is similar to/longer than oligonucleotides
used on the array and (2) sequence changes were found in
Nichols DNA when compared to published complete
sequence used for mapping array design [GenBank:AE000520].
Analysis of whole genome interstrain heterogeneity
between Nichols and SS14
When results of CGS, WGF and DDT sequencing were
combined, 327 SNPs (224 transitions and 103 transversions), 14 deletions and 18 insertions were identified (Fig.

1). Sequence changes of variable regions V1–V7 of
TP0897, tprK, were not included, because sequences of
these regions were found to differ greatly in both length
and sequence within the SS14 population, in agreement
with investigations published previously [22-24].
Obtained data have been used to compile the sequence of
the SS14 genome [GenBank:CP000805]. The GenBank
entry contains Ns in the positions of variable regions V1–
V7 of tprK gene. All discovered sequence changes are listed
in Table S1 (See Additional file 1: Supplemental data).
Interstrain sequence heterogeneity discovered between
strains Nichols and SS14 included silent mutations,
amino acid alterations/indels, gene fusions, and truncations and elongations of open reading frames due to
indels. Among the SNPs found by CGS was an adenine to
guanine transition in both copies of 23S rDNA in SS14
strain. This sequence change was previously described in

Many discovered indels did not disrupt the open reading
frames and represented variable number of nucleotides in
homopolymeric tracts (e.g. in TP0012, TP0127), variable
number of short motif repeats of 3 and 6 nucleotides (e.g.
in TP0136, TP0304, TP0544, TP0668, TP0865), and variable number of longer motif repeats of 60 and 24 nts
(TP0433–TP0434, TP0470).
Frameshift mutations and other changes affecting protein
length are presented in Table 4. Besides 11 hypothetical
proteins (including two possible surface proteins – Tp75
and p83/100), FlaB1 and Tex protein were affected.
Sequence changes in four cases led to fusion of ORFs
(TP0006 and TP0007 – elongation of Tp75 protein; hypothetical proteins TP0433 and TP0434, TP0597 and
TP0598; conserved hypothetical proteins TP0468 and
TP0469). Three of these genes (TP0006, TP0470, TP0486)
were predicted to code for possible surface protein virulence factors [26]. Moreover, antigen p83/100, hypotheti-

cal gene TP0127, conserved hypothetical gene TP0470
and the fused proteins TP0433–TP0434 and TP0468–
TP0469 were described to be antigenic in rabbits [27].
Two of the frameshift changes were confirmed to be
present in the Nichols strain genomic DNA (TP0486 and
TP0598).
SNPs in SS14 were found to be non-uniformly distributed
with the number of SNPs per ORF varying from 0 to 49.
Hypervariable regions are listed in Table 5 and include
ORFs encoding 3 hypothetical proteins, Tpr proteins
(TprC, TprL) and outer membrane protein TP0326.
TP0326 was predicted to be a virulence factor [26] and
was experimentally verified to be an antigen [27]. It is of
interest that the most variable region of the genome represents TP0136 (and sequence upstream of this gene)
which encodes a protein that is antigenic in both rabbit
and human infections [27,28] and was found to serve as
fibronectin and laminin binding protein [29].

The distribution of SNPs in coding and non-coding
sequences of SS14 was not significantly different. ORFs
represent 92.9% of total genomic sequence; 94.8% of all
SNPs were in coding sequences corresponding to 310
SNPs in genes (212 transitions and 98 transversions) and
17 SNPs (5.2%) in intergenic regions (12 transitions, 5
transversions). The frequency of SNPs was different
among putative protein classes (Table 6). The highest frequency of SNPs was in hypothetical genes, lowest in
housekeeping genes. In addition, housekeeping genes had

and TP1029 (hypothetical protein) and in the intergenic
region between tprI and tprJ. Consensus sequences were
mostly identical to the Nichols published sequence, but
some positions had minor alternative sequences or vice
versa. Altogether, intrastrain genetic heterogeneity comprised polymorphisms in 43 nucleotide positions and one
polymorphism in a homopolymeric stretch (Table 7).

Discussion
Obtaining the complete genome sequence of a second
syphilis spirochete (SS14) shows the utility of the CGS
strategy for treponemal comparative genomics. This is the
first application of this approach to sequence an entire
genome. This approach can be used when highly similar
genomes are investigated and one genome sequence of
closely related organism is known. The CGS strategy represents a rapid (days to weeks) and scalable methodology
to sequence multiple syphilitic strains and clinical isolates. In the present study there was a need to further
investigate some variable regions, but the directed DDT
sequencing required was much less than needed to

Identification of intrastrain variability in TPA population
Because DDT sequencing of some PCR products did not
result in an unambiguous sequence, WGS-DDT sequencing of small insert libraries was performed. Analysis of
libraries and PCR products revealed multiple (intrastrain)
sequence variants in TP0117 (tprC), TP0402 (coding for
flagellum-specific ATP synthase), TP0620 (tprI), TP0621
(tprJ), TP0971 (pathogen-specific membrane antigen)

sequence a whole genome, thus lowering the total cost of
obtaining the genome sequence.
There are some of the TPA-specific limitations of this
approach to whole genome sequencing. Because the CGS
strategy uses genomic DNA as a probe, accuracy is affected
by the presence of repeated sequences. Repeat regions
hybridize to more than one oligonucleotide on a tiling
array resulting in both reduced sensitivity to detect
changes, as well as ambiguity in assigning locations for
the variants detected. Precautions have to be taken when
inspecting tpr regions and others (arp gene, TP0470)
which cross-react based on sequence similarity. Such
regions, together with highly variable regions, need to be
analyzed by WGF and sequenced by DDT to reveal true
nucleotide changes and numbers of repeated regions.
Another possible restriction of this methodology arises
from the character of the TPA population. Multiple
sequence variants in the Nichols strain population were
both described previously and identified in this work, and
hybridization based sequence changes discovery in these
regions is influenced by the ratio between/among different sequence variants in the population. Finally, the accuracy of the genome sequence produced by CGS is
dependent on the accuracy of the reference genome
sequence. As suggested by two newly revealed frameshifts
in Nichols strain sequence, discovered sequence changes
have to be verified in Nichols sequence to describe real
sequence changes compared to Nichols genome.
The SS14 genome brings a first insight into the whole
genome variability within TPA. Both Nichols and SS14
cause infection in rabbits and so are not believed to be
attenuated to cause infection in man, thus it is very probable none of the differences may affect the ability of the
bacteria to cause the disease. The examples of interstrain
heterogeneity and multiple alleles in a population of haploid organisms are candidates for antigenic variation, contingency genes and other types of SSR (short sequence
repeats) [30,31]. Changes resulting in significant differences in protein sequences (frameshifts and sequence

changes causing protein length shifts) and hypervariable
regions affected novel genes, membrane antigens and Tpr
proteins. The Tpr protein family includes 12 Treponema
pallidum repeat proteins, found uniquely in this bacterium
and showing sequence similarity to major sheath protein
of Treponema denticola. 8 out of 12 tpr genes (66%) were
found to be affected by sequence changes representing a
higher proportion than the whole genome rate (13.1%).
Positions showing interstrain and intrastrain heterogeneity or both were found in tpr genes. Altogether 53 SNPs
and 38 intrastrain variable nucleotide positions, with at
least one allele identical to the sequence of the Nichols
genome, were found in tpr genes (V1–V7 regions of tprK
were excluded from this analysis). Based on the fact that
tpr genes share a high degree of similarity on the DNA
level, we expect differences could be underestimated due
to the limitations of the hybridization method for
repeated sequences. Multiple alleles of tpr genes were
described among and within TPA strains [22-24,32,33]
and some TPA repeated regions (tpr genes, arp gene) were
used as loci for typing of clinical isolates [34-38]. Newly
identified hypervariable regions (Table 5) represent candidate sequences to screen clinical isolates and have
potential to be used as typing markers of strains and isolates. In addition, different strains of TPA have already
been tested for association with higher risk for neuroinvasion in rabbits [39] and identification of underlying
sequence changes will enable prediction of such risks. The
identified variation in novel genes suggests other targets
besides tpr genes could be responsible for antigenic variation in TPA, or without support of further expression and
antigenicity data, these could represent pseudogenes.

Conclusion
The CGS strategy combined with WGF represents a rapid
and simply scalable method to assess genome-wide
genetic variability within TPA strains and subspecies,
which share a very unusual degree of sequence similarity
and lack genome rearrangements (as shown in this study).
We expect this method to be combined with new sequencing technologies to produce high quality genome

sequences to provide important data to design genotyping
systems for more intensive strain sampling. Sequence variants could be readily used for molecular typing and identification of SS14 and Nichols strains and, with
accumulation of additional data from other TPA
genomes, for epidemiologic applications and clinical discrimination between reinfection and reactivation of syphilitic processes. Moreover, the ability to now sequence
numerous TPA strains, especially those showing different
degrees of virulence, will allow phenotype to be correlated
with sequence. This is a significant development for an
organism of important public health impact, but for
which standard bacterial genetic methods are untenable.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/76

Finally, the stain solution was removed, and arrays were
washed in non-stringent wash buffer followed by two 30
sec washes in 0.5 × SSC and a 15 sec wash in 70% EtOH.
Arrays were spun dry in a custom centrifuge and stored
until scanning.
Microarray scanning, data analysis and sequencing microarray design and procedure were described previously [4].
The second array designed to sequence SS14 strain contained 392,000 oligonucleotides, with 8 oligos per base
position (4 for each strand) and 48,600 bases were
sequenced in total. Because mutations are sequenced in
step two, inclusion of false positives from the mapping
arrays does not affect the final data set.

Methods
DNA isolation
TPA strains Nichols and SS14 were maintained by rabbit
inoculation and purified by Hypaque gradient centrifugation as described previously [40]. Chromosomal DNA
was prepared as described previously [3].
Comparative genome sequencing
100 ng of treponemal genomic DNA was amplified to
approximately 100 µg using the REPLI-g kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). For each array hybridization, 5 µg of amplified genomic DNA was digested with 0.005 U DNase I in
1× One-Phor-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Piscataway, NJ) for 5 min at 37°C, followed by inactivation at 95°C for 15 min. To label the digested DNA fragments, 4 µl 5× Terminal Transferase Buffer (Promega,
Madison, WI), 1 nmol Biotin-N6-ddATP, and 25 U Terminal Transferase were added directly to the inactivated
digestion mix and incubated at 37°C for 90 min, followed
by inactivation at 95°C for 15 min.

Mutation mapping microarrays were designed to map
mutations by selecting a 29 mer oligonucleotide every 7
bases for both strands of the complete TPA Nichols
genome sequence [3], [GenBank:AE000520]. All 325,138
oligonucleotides were synthesized in parallel as described
by others [41,42].
Arrays were hybridized to digested, labeled genomic DNA
of Nichols and SS14 strains separately and processed as
described in [4] with an additional step after second wash
in stringent buffer consisting of staining with a solution
containing Cy3-Streptavidin conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min, and washing again with nonstringent wash buffer. The Cy3 signal was amplified by
secondary labeling of the DNA with biotinylated goat
anti-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
The secondary antibody was washed off with non-stringent wash buffer, and arrays were re-stained with the Cy3Streptavidin solution.

Dideoxy-terminator sequencing of heterologous SS14
genome regions
After the second sequencing stage of the array analysis,
some regions (Table 1) of the SS14 genome showed clear
differences but SNPs could not be clearly identified. These
regions were sequenced by DDT sequencing. Coordinates
of these regions were extended with at least 150 bp in
both directions and amplified with Taq-polymerase using
oligonucleotide primers designed with Primer3 software
[43]. The resulting PCR products were purified using
QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and DDT
sequenced using the original amplification primers and
internal primers where applicable. Due to sequence similarity between tpr (Treponema pallidum repeat) genes, 3 of
the heterologous regions (comprising genes TP0620–
TP0621, TP0896–TP0898, TP1029–TP1030) were XL PCR
amplified using primers annealing to unique regions in
the vicinity of the desired sequence. XL PCR products were
purified and mechanically sheared to fragments 500 –
1000 bp in length. These fragments were cloned into the
pUC18 vector resulting in small insert libraries and
recombinant plasmids isolated from at least 48 colonies
were DDT sequenced to multiple coverage using pUC18
primers. All sequence reads were analyzed using Lasergene
software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).
Whole genome fingerprinting
Whole genome fingerprinting was performed as described
previously [44]. The chromosomal DNA was amplified in
102 Treponema pallidum interval (TPI) regions with
median length of 12,204.5 bp (ranging from 1,778 to
24,758 bp) using the GeneAmp® XL PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer pairs for these
amplifications are listed in Table S2 (See additional file 1:
Supplemental data). Each PCR product was digested with
BamH I, EcoR I and Hind III (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) or their combinations. To asses the possible
presence of indels in restriction fragments ≥ 4 kb, additional digestions using Acc I, Cla I, EcoR V, Kpn I, Mlu I,
Nco I, Nhe I, Rsr II, Sac I, Spe I, Xba I or Xho I were per-
