Abstract
Background: The Archaea are highly diverse in terms of their physiology, metabolism and ecology.
Presently, very few molecular characteristics are known that are uniquely shared by either all archaea or
the different main groups within archaea. The evolutionary relationships among different groups within the
Euryarchaeota branch are also not clearly understood.
Results: We have carried out comprehensive analyses on each open reading frame (ORFs) in the genomes
of 11 archaea (3 Crenarchaeota – Aeropyrum pernix, Pyrobaculum aerophilum and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius; 8
Euryarchaeota – Pyrococcus abyssi, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanococcoides
burtonii, Halobacterium sp. NCR-1, Haloquadratum walsbyi, Thermoplasma acidophilum and Picrophilus torridus)
to search for proteins that are unique to either all Archaea or for its main subgroups. These studies have
identified 1448 proteins or ORFs that are distinctive characteristics of Archaea and its various subgroups
and whose homologues are not found in other organisms. Six of these proteins are unique to all Archaea,
10 others are only missing in Nanoarchaeum equitans and a large number of other proteins are specific for
various main groups within the Archaea (e.g. Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Sulfolobales and
Desulfurococcales, Halobacteriales, Thermococci, Thermoplasmata, all methanogenic archaea or
particular groups of methanogens). Of particular importance is the observation that 31 proteins are
uniquely present in virtually all methanogens (including M. kandleri) and 10 additional proteins are only
found in different methanogens as well as A. fulgidus. In contrast, no protein was exclusively shared by
various methanogen and any of the Halobacteriales or Thermoplasmatales. These results strongly indicate
that all methanogenic archaea form a monophyletic group exclusive of other archaea and that this lineage
likely evolved from Archaeoglobus. In addition, 15 proteins that are uniquely shared by M. kandleri and
Methanobacteriales suggest a close evolutionary relationship between them. In contrast to the
phylogenomics studies, a monophyletic grouping of archaea is not supported by phylogenetic analyses
based on protein sequences.
Conclusion: The identified archaea-specific proteins provide novel molecular markers or signature
proteins that are distinctive characteristics of Archaea and all of its major subgroups. The species
distributions of these proteins provide novel insights into the evolutionary relationships among different
groups within Archaea, particularly regarding the origin of methanogenesis. Most of these proteins are of
unknown function and further studies should lead to discovery of novel biochemical and physiological
characteristics that are unique to either all archaea or its different subgroups.

Background
Archaea are widely regarded as one of the three main
domains of life [1-7], although their origin is a subject of
debate [8-14]. Archaeal species were earlier believed to
inhabit only extreme environments such as extremely hot,
or hot and acidic, extremely saline, or very acidic or alkaline conditions [15-19]. However, recent studies provide
evidence that they are widespread in different environments [3,20]. The archaea also include methanogens,
which grow under strictly anaerobic and often thermophilic conditions, and are the only organisms that
derive all of their metabolic energy by reduction of CO2 by
hydrogen to produce methane [21,22]. The archaeal species branch distinctly from all other organisms in phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and many other gene/
protein sequences [2,7,23-25]. In addition, many morphological or physiological characteristics such as the
presence of branched-chain ether-linked lipids in their
cell membrane, lack of peptidoglycan in their cell wall,
characteristic subunit pattern of RNA polymerase, presence of modified bases in tRNA, presence of a unique
form of DNA polymerase, have been previously indicated
as defining characteristics of archaea [1,15]. However, as
noted by Walsh and Doolittle [26], many of these features
are either not shared by all archaea or they are also present
in various eukaryotes or some thermophilic bacteria, indicating that they do not constitute distinctive characteristics of all Archaea.
The phylogenetic analyses of Archaea have led to their
division into two major groups or phyla designated as
Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota [1,2,7,13,27-29]. The
Crenarchaeota species have also been referred to as
'Eocytes' by Lake and coworkers [30,31]. The species from
both these groups, particularly Euryarchaeota, are highly
diverse in terms of their metabolism and physiology.
Based on their metabolic and physiological characteristics
and other unique features, five functionally distinct
groups within Euryarchaeota are currently recognized:
methanogens, sulfate reducers, extreme halophiles, cell
wall-less archaea, and extremely thermophilic sulfur
metabolizing archaea [2,13,32]. Some of these groups,
such as methanogens, are polyphyletic in different phylogenetic trees [13,33,34]. However, the sets of genes or proteins that are unique to these different functional groups
and distinguish them from all others remain to be identified. In the past 10 years, complete genomes of many
archaeal species (29 at the time when these analyses were
completed) covering all major divisions within the
Archaea have been sequenced (see Table 1). Comparative
analyses of these sequences provide a valuable resource
for identifying different genes/proteins that are distinctive
characteristics of various taxonomic and functional
groups within Archaea [27,35-37].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

Whole proteins that are uniquely present in particular
groups or subgroups of organisms but not found anywhere else provide valuable molecular markers for taxonomic, phylogenetic and biochemical studies. These
proteins, which we refer to as signature proteins in our
work, and others have called them as ORFans or conserved hypothetical proteins, are present at different phylogenetic depths, such as genus, family, order or even
phylum [35,36,38-42]. In our recent work, a large number
of such proteins that are distinctive characteristics of several groups within bacteria (viz. α-proteobacteria, ε-proteobacteria, Chlamydia and Actinobacteria), and also
their subgroups, were identified [39-43]. These proteins
provide not only valuable molecular markers for identifying and circumscribing species belonging to these major
groups (and their subgroups) in molecular terms, but
their species distribution pattern also provides useful
information about the branching order within these
groups. As archaea constitute a very diverse group, identification of sets of proteins that are specific for its main
groups and subgroups should prove useful in terms of
identifying molecular characteristics that are unique to
them. Additionally, this information should also be helpful in understanding the evolutionary relationships
among different groups.
Comparative studies on limited numbers of archaeal
genomes have been carried out by a number of investigators using different criteria. Graham et al. [36] analyzed 9
archaeal genomes to identify signature proteins that function uniquely within the Archaea. Their definition of an
archaeal signature protein required it to be present in only
two different euryarchaeal species and they identified 353
archaeal signature proteins. Makarova and Koonin
[27,35] have analyzed archaeal genomes to identify core
sets of genes, which are present in all archaeal species, but
which are not restricted to the archaeal species. Recently,
Walsh and Doolittle have analyzed prokaryotic genomes
to measure dissimilarity between Archaea and Bacteria
[26]. Although it was reported that 28% of the proteins
from archaeal genomes are restricted to the Archaea, specific proteins that were present in different groups of
archaea were not identified. Other comparative studies
using different criteria have been conducted on smaller
groups within archaea such as Pyrococcus, Sulfolobus and
thermoacidophilic organisms (to be discussed later).
However, thus far no comprehensive phylogenomics
study on different archaeal genomes has been carried out
using the same standard criteria to identify proteins or
ORFs that are shared by all archaea or its different major
lineages. In this study we have carried out comparative
analyses of archaeal genomes using uniform criteria to
identify proteins that are uniquely present in archaeal species at different phylogenetic depths (genus or higher)
representing all major groups within the Archaea.

Results and discussion
A. Phylogenetic analyses of archaeal species
Prior to undertaking comparative studies on archaeal
genomes, phylogenetic analysis of sequenced archaeal
species was carried out so that the results of phylogenomics analyses could be compared with those obtained by
traditional phylogenetic approaches. Phylogenetic trees
for the archaeal species based on 16S rRNA as well as concatenated sequences of translation and transcriptionrelated proteins have been published by other investigators [7,28,32,44]. In the present work, we have constructed phylogenetic trees for 29 archaeal species (see
Table 1) using a set of 31 universally distributed proteins
that are involved in a broad range of functions [45]. The
sequence of Haloquadratum walsbyi DSM 16790, which
became available afterward, was not included in these
studies. Phylogenetic trees based on a concatenated
sequence alignment of these proteins were constructed
using the neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood
(ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) methods.

The results of these analyses are presented in Fig. 1. All
three methods gave very similar tree topologies except for
the branching positions of M. kandleri and Methanospiril-

lum hungatei, which were found to be variable. Except for
this, the branching pattern of the archaeal species based
on our dataset is very similar to that reported by Gribaldo
et al. [13,32] based on concatenated sequences of translation and transcription-related proteins. In the tree shown,
the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, the two major phyla
within Archaea were clearly distinguished from each
other. The phylogenetic affinity of Nanoarchaeum, which
has a long-branch length, was not resolved in this or various other trees [32,46]. Within Crenarchaeota, Pyrobaculum
was indicated to be a deeper branch, and Aeropyrum
branched in between the Pyrobaculum and Sulfolobus.
Within Euryarchaeota, the clades corresponding to Halobacteria, Thermococci and Thermoplasmata were resolved
with high bootstrap scores, but the methanogens were
split into 2–3 clusters. One of these clusters that has low
bootstrap score consisted of Methanobacteriales and Methanococcales with M. kandleri (Methanopyrales) branching in
its vicinity [34,47,48]. The second cluster, with higher
bootstrap score, showed a grouping of Methanomicrobiales
and Methanosarcinales. These two clusters, which are separated by Thermoplasmata, Archaeoglobi and Halobacteria,
have been referred to as Class I and Class II methanogens
by Bapteste et al. [29].

the query genomes for blast searches.

B. Phylogenomic analyses of archaeal genomes
To search for proteins (or ORFs), which are uniquely
present in either all Archaea or various subgroups of them,
blast searches were performed on each open reading
frame (ORF) from a total of 11 archaeal genomes (see
Table 1; shaded species in Fig. 1). These genomes included
3 Crenarchaeota (viz. Aeropyrum pernix, Pyrobaculum aerophilum and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius) [49-51] and 8 divergent Euryarchaeota species covering all main functional
and phylogenetic groups (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). The Euryarchaeota genomes analyzed included: Pyrococcus abyssi
from extremely thermophilic sulfur metabolizing archaea
[52], Methanococcus maripaludis [53] from Methanococcales, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and H. walsbyi from extreme
halophiles [54], Thermoplasma acidophilum and Picrophilus
torridus belonging to the cell wall-less archaea [19,55],
Methanococcoides burtonii from Methanosarcinales and
Methanopyrus kandleri from the Methanopyrales order
[56]. The chosen genomes should provide information
regarding all archaeal proteins that are shared at a taxonomic level higher than a genus. The analysis of the

remainder of the genomes, which was expected to provide
information regarding proteins that are only unique to a
given species, was not carried out.
Each ORF from these genomes was examined by means of
blastp and PSI-blast searches against all available
sequences from different organisms to identify proteins
that are specific for only archaeal lineages. The methods
and the criteria that we have used to identify proteins that
are specific for either all or various subgroups of archaea
are described in the Methods section. Generally, a protein
was considered to be specific for a given archaeal lineage
if all significant hits or alignments in the blastp and PSIblast searches with the query protein were from the indicated group of archaeal species. In a few cases, where 1–2
isolated species from other groups also exhibited significant similarity, such proteins were retained as they provide interesting examples of lateral gene transfer (LGT)
from archaea to other groups. Our analyses have identified 1448 proteins that are unique to different groups of
Archaea and for which no homologues are generally

found in any bacterial or eukaryotic species. Based on
their specificity for different taxonomic groups, these proteins have been divided into a number of different groups
(see Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and Additional files). A brief
description of the different subsets of archaeal-specific
proteins and functional information regarding them,
where known, is given below. In the description of these
proteins that follows, the 'APE', 'HQ', 'Mbu', 'MK', 'MMP',
'PAB', 'PAE', 'PTO', 'Saci', 'Ta', 'VNG', and 'NEQ' part of the
descriptors in proteins indicate that the original query
protein sequence was from the genome of A. pernix K1, H.

equitans, respectively.
(a) Proteins that are specific for all Archaea
Table 2(a) shows a group of 16 proteins that are present
in nearly all archaeal species but whose homologues are
not found in any Bacteria or Eukaryotes with a single
exception. Of these, the first 6 proteins in the left column
(Table 2a) viz. PAB0063, PAB0252, PAB0316, PAB1633,
PAB1716 and PAB2291, are present in all sequenced
archaeal genomes. The observed E-values for these proteins from archaeal species are very low, close to 0, indicating that these proteins show very high degree of
sequence conservation in various archaea. The unique
presence of these proteins in all sequenced archaeal
genomes indicates that these proteins could be regarded
as distinctive characteristics or molecular signatures for
the archaeal domain. The genes for these proteins likely
evolved in a common ancestor of the Archaea and were
then vertically acquired by other archaeal species.
Makarova and Koonin [35] have also mentioned 6 proteins that are commonly shared by different archaea, but
the identity of such proteins was not specified. These proteins are likely the same. The remaining 10 proteins in
Table 2(a) are missing only in N. equitans, which is a tiny
parasitic organism containing only 536 genes [57,58]. The
species distribution pattern of these proteins can be
accounted for by one of the following two possibilities.
First, it is possible that N. equitans is the deepest branching
lineage within archaea, as has been suggested [57,58] and
the genes for these 10 proteins evolved in a common
ancestor of the other archaea after its divergence (Fig. 2a).
Alternatively, similar to the first 6 proteins, the genes for
these 10 proteins evolved in a common ancestor of all
archaea, but they were then selectively lost in N. equitans
(Fig. 2b) [35,46,58]. Based upon our results, one cannot
distinguish between these two possibilities. However, in
view of the fact that the genome of N. equitans has undergone extensive genome shrinkage (only 0.49 Mb) and it is
at least 3 times smaller than the next smallest archaeal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

genome (see Table 1), we favour the latter possibility (Fig.
2b) [35,46,58].
Of the proteins that are uniquely present in all archaea,
PAB0063 corresponds to tRNA nucleotidyltransferase
(CCA-adding enzyme), which builds and repairs the 3'
end of tRNA [59]. Functionally similar enzymes are also
present in bacteria and eukaryotes (assigned as Class II),
but their sequences share very little homology with the
archaeal CCA-adding enzyme (Class I), which explains
why no homologs were detected in any bacteria or eukaryotes in blast searches. The main mechanistic difference
between class I and class II enzymes is that the tRNA substrate is required to fully define the nucleotide binding
site in class I enzyme, whereas class II has a preformed
nucleotide binding site that recognizes CTP and ATP in
the absence of tRNA [60]. Another protein PAB0316 is
assigned as archaeal type DNA primase, which also has its
synonymous counterparts in bacterial and eukaryotic species, but shows very little homology to them [61,62]. In
the same way, protein PAB1633 is annotated as a PilT
family ATPase, which showed very little similarity to bacterial ATPases involved in type IV pili biogenesis [54]. Further studies of this protein could provide insights into
novel aspects of the archaeal flagellar system. A number of
other proteins viz. PAB1716, PAB0018a, PAB0075,
PAB0475 and PAB2104, have also been assigned putative
functions based on sequence analysis, but their exact roles
in archaeal cells remains to be determined. Interestingly,
for protein PAB0075, two gene copies with acceptable Evalues are also present in the genomes of Dehalococcoides
ethenogenes 195, Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1 and Dehalococcoides sp. BAV1, which belong to Chloroflexi [2]. Because
no homologue of PAB0075 is present in other bacteria, it
is likely that this protein was transferred from archaea to
the common ancestor of Dehalococcoides followed by a
gene duplication event.
Table 2(b) lists 20 additional proteins, which are specific
to archaea but missing in a small number of species.
Because these proteins are present in most Euryarchaeota
as well as Crenarchaeota species, but not detected in Bacteria or Eukaryotes except one LGT case (PAB2342, see
note in Table 2), we consider them also to be distinctive
characteristics of most Archaea. Of these proteins, 11 proteins (viz. PAB0654, PAB0950, PAB1135, PAB1906,
PAB7388, PAB0547, PAB0552, PAB0623, PAB1272,
PAB1429 and PAB1721) are mainly missing in the 4 Thermoplasmata species. Thermoplasmata are thermoacidophilic archaea which lack cell envelope [19,55,63](see
Table 1). Some studies have suggested that high temperature and very low intracellular pH exert selective pressure
favouring smaller genomes [19]. Thus, it is possible that
genes for these proteins were selectively lost in the Thermoplasmata lineage. Most of these proteins are of

These proteins were identified by BLASTP searches and their specificity is further confirmed by PSI-BLAST searches. For details, see method
section. The protein ID number starting with PAB represents query protein from the genome of P. abyssi GE5, which was used as probe to perform
the blast search. Accession numbers for these proteins are shown in square brackets. The possible cellular functions and COG or CDD number of
some proteins are noted. For other proteins, the cellular functions are not known.
Note 1. Two low-scoring homologs to PAB0075 were also found in Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 (Chloroflexi) and Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1.

unknown function. However, 8 of them have been
assigned putative functions with the title of "archaeal
type"'. For example, PAB0301 is archaeal sugar kinase,
PAB0950 is archaeal transcription factor E α-subunit,
PAB1387 is archaeal flagella accessory protein, PAB7094
is archaeal chromatin protein, and PAB0552 is archaeal
type Holliday junction resolvase. These proteins do not
show detectable sequence similarity to their counterparts
in Bacteria or Eukaryotes, and some studies indicate that
they also differ in terms of their structure, function or
interaction with other cell components [64,65].
(b) Proteins that are specific for Crenarchaeota
As mentioned in the introduction, the Archaea are divided
into 2 main groups, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota,
based on 16S rRNA trees as well many other gene trees
and characteristics. The Crenarchaeota are also indicated
to differ from Euryarchaeota in terms of their ribosome
structure [30,31]. In comparison to Euryarchaeota, which
contain physiologically and metabolically diverse groups
of organisms, the Crenarchaeota were thought to be a
pure collection of extreme thermophiles and most members metabolize sulfur. However, recent studies indicate
that Crenarchaeota are much more diverse in their physiology and ecology than was previously believed [28,66].
Many species living in the cold ocean also belong to this

group based on their branching pattern in 16S rRNA trees,
although most of them have not been cultivated [67].
Currently, this phylum is comprised of one single class
Thermoprotei containing three orders: Thermoproteales,
Desulfurococcales and Sulfolobales. Fortunately, every
order has a completely sequenced representative (see
Table 1)[50,51,68,69], which provide a platform to
explore the characteristics that are unique to crenarchaeal
species. Comparative genomic surveys have revealed
some molecular features that are shared by crenarchaea
but not euryarchaea, such as the lack of histones, absence
of the FtsZ-MinCDE system and distinctive rRNA operon
organization [69]. Lake et al. have also identified distinctive differences in ribosome structure and an insert in
elongation factor EF-G and EF-Tu, which can be used to
distinguish Crenarchaeota from Euryarchaeota [6,30,70].
However, these features are not unique characteristics of
the Crenarchaeota.
Blast searches on each ORF from the genomes of A. pernix
and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 [49,50] have identified 11
proteins which are shared by all five crenarchaeal species,
but whose homologs are not found in other archaea, or
any bacteria or eukaryotes with only 3 exceptions (see
Table 3(a)). The genes for these proteins likely evolved in
a common ancestor of the Crenarchaeota and they pro-

vide potential molecular markers for species from this
phylum. Additionally, 22 proteins that are listed in Table
3(b) are only found in A. pernix and three Sulfolobus
genomes. These proteins suggest that Aeropyrum and Sulfolobus may have shared a common ancestor exclusive of
Pyrobaculum. However, we have also come across 9 proteins that are shared by Aeropyrum and Pyrobaculum (Table
3(c)) and 14 proteins that are exclusively present in the 3
Sulfolobus species and Pyrobaculum (see Table 3(d)).
Hence, based upon the species distributions of these proteins, the relationships among the Aeropyrum, Sulfolobales and Pyrobaculum are not entirely clear (Fig. 2a). In

phylogenetic trees Thermoproteales (i.e. Pyrobaculum)
branches consistently earlier than Desulfurococcales (i.e.
Aeropyrum) and Sulfolobales (Fig. 1) [32,44]. This observation in conjunction with the fact that Aeropyrum and
Sulfolobus share larger numbers of proteins in common
with each other suggests that these two groups likely
shared a common ancestor exclusive of Pyrobaculum (Fig.
2b). The proteins that are only found in Aeropyrum and
Pyrobaculum, or in Sulfolobus and Pyrobaculum, most likely
evolved in a common ancestor of the crenarchaea, but
were subsequently lost in either the Sulfolobales or A. pernix lineages.

The protein ID number starting with MMP, Ta and VNG represents query protein from the genome of M. maripaludis S2, T. acidophilum and
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. * means protein is missing in the genomes of 4 Thermococci species.
Note 1. Homologs to PAB2404 and PAB0188 are also found in Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M.
Note 2. Homolog to PAB1055 is also found in Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1 and D. ethenogenes 195.

In addition to these proteins that are uniquely present in
either all sequenced Crenarchaeota genomes or different
groups of Crenarchaeota species, these analyses have also
identified 264 proteins that are unique for the Sulfolobales species (see Additional file 1). Of these, 184 proteins
are present in all 3 sequenced Sulfolobus genomes, whereas
the remaining 80 are present in at least two of the three
Sulfolobus genomes. In this work, since blast analyses were
not carried out on all three Sulfolobus genomes, it is likely
that the numbers of genes or proteins that are uniquely
shared by only two Sulfolobus genomes is much higher
than indicated here. Chen et al. [50] have previously analyzed the genome of S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 and indicated the presence of 107 genes that were specific for
Crenarchaeota and 866 genes that were specific to Sulfolobus genus. However, in the present work, relatively few
genes that are uniquely shared by various Crenarchaeota
species were identified. This difference could be due to
more stringent criteria that we have employed for identification of proteins that are specific to different groups.
The genome of Thermofilum pendens Hrk 5, which belongs
to Thermoproteales, has also been partially sequenced
and information for large numbers of genes/proteins
from this species is available in the NCBI database. By carrying out blast searches on each ORF from P. aerophilum
genome [51], we have identified 42 proteins that are only
found in the above 2 Thermoproteales species (see Additional file 2). The numbers of proteins shared by these two
species will likely increase once complete genome of T.
pendens becomes available. Many of these proteins are
expected to provide markers for the Thermoproteales
order.

(c) Proteins that are specific for Euryarchaeota
The Euryarchaeota, which comprise a majority of the cultured and sequenced archaea, is a morphologically, metabolically and physiologically diverse collection of species
as evidenced by the presence in this group of various
methanogens, extreme halophiles, cell wall-less archaea
and sulfate reducing microbes [2,13]. No unique biochemical or molecular characteristic that is commonly
shared by all of the different lineages is known. The
present study has identified 20 proteins that are only
found in Euryarchaeota species with 3 exceptions (see
Table 4). In this Table, the first 7 proteins (Table 4(a)) are
present in most euryarchaeota species. Of these proteins,
PAB0082 and PAB2404 were found in all sequenced euryarchaeota species. PAB2404 was also present in N. equitans, supporting its placement within the Euryarchaeota
[35,46]. The protein PAB0082 is annotated as archaeosine
tRNA-ribosyltransferase (ArcTGT), which catalyzes the
exchange of guanine with a free 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine
(preQ0) base, as the first step in the biosynthesis of an
archaea-specific modified base, archaeosine (7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine) [71]. It should be mentioned
that there is another protein PAB0740 in the same
genome, which is also annotated and experimentally confirmed as ArcTGT [72]. The latter belongs to a family of
proteins that are highly conserved in all archaea species
(including Crenarchaeota) and some bacteria. It seems
that PAB0082 might be involved in RNA modification
since it possesses a PUA domain (named after pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase), but its
function is likely different from PAB0740. The protein
PAB2404, which is annotated as DNA polymerase II large

subunit, is highly conserved within Euryarchaeota, but is
not found anywhere else except in Nanoarchaeum. This
enzyme is the major DNA replicase in Euryarchaeota and
also a distinctive molecular marker for this group [73,74].
The genes for the above proteins likely evolved in a common ancestor of Euryarchaeota (Fig. 2) and they provide
molecular markers for this diverse group of organisms.
Another 13 proteins listed in Table 4(b) are found in
almost all euryarchaeota, but they are missing in Thermoplasmata. Their distribution suggests that either Thermoplasmata is a deep branching lineage within
Euryarchaeota or that the genes for these proteins have

been selectively lost from Thermoplasmata [55]. Of these
proteins, PAB0188 is also present in N. equitans supporting its placement with Euryarchaeota. Five other proteins
from the first two columns in Table 4 (viz. MMP0243,
Ta0062, VNG1263c, MMP1287, and VNG2408c) are also
not found in the 4 Thermococci species. These results can
again be explained by either selective loss of these genes
from these particular groups or deeper branching of these
lineages within the Euryarchaeota species. On the basis of
proteins listed in Table 4, although one can infer that
Thermoplasmata and Thermococci are deeper branching
lineages within Euryarchaeota in comparison to methanogens, their relative branching order cannot be resolved.

(d) Proteins that are specific for different main groups within
Euryarchaeota
Proteins specific for methanogenic archaea and their various
subgroups
Currently, the methanogens form the largest group within
the Euryarchaeota. They are distinguished from all other
prokaryotes by their ability to obtain all or most of their
energy via the reduction of CO2 to methane or by the
process of methanogenesis. In the Bergey's manual [75],
the methanogenes are divided into 5 distinct orders (viz.
Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales, Methanomicrobi-

ales, Methanosarcinales and Methanopyrales). Some
studies have suggested that these organisms possess a set
of unique enzymes which are responsible for methanogenesis, such as coenzyme M, Factor 420 and methanopterin [76]. However, no systematic study has been carried
out thus far to identify proteins that are uniquely present
in different methanogens. Our blast searches of proteins
from different methanogens have led to identification of
31 proteins, which are uniquely found in various methanogenic archaea. Twenty of these 31 proteins are present
in all sequenced methanogens, while 11 proteins are

missing only in M. stadtmanae, which is a human intestinal inhabitant (see notes in Table 5). This archaeon generate methane by reduction of methanol with H2 and
lacks many proteins present in the genomes of other
methanogens [77,78]. Thus, it is highly likely that the 11
proteins missing in M. stadtmanae were selectively lost
from this species. Therefore, it is very likely that the genes
for these 31 proteins that are commonly shared by virtu-

ally all methanogens (Table 5(a)) evolved in a common
ancestor of all methanogens.
These analyses have also identified 10 proteins that are
uniquely shared by various methanogens as well as A.
fulgidus (see Table 5(b)). The genes for these proteins
likely evolved in a common ancestor of A. fulgidus and
various methanogenic archaea and they point to a close
relationship between these two groups of organisms (Fig.

this lineage is the closest ancestor of all methanogens.

are commonly shared by A. fulgidus and various methanogenic archaea, MMP0607 is reported to be a novel repressor of nif and glnA genes, which are involved in nitrogen
assimilation [79]. Interestingly, 2 homologs of this protein are also found in 3 Dehalococcoides species, but
nowhere else, which are very likely due to LGT. Protein
MMP0984 is the ε-subunit of carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase complex, which is made up of five subunits in different methanogens [80]. The epsilon subunits are
required for the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 [81].
All of the other components could be found in a few bacterial species, while the ε-subunit is restricted to methanogenic archaea and A. fulgidus [82,83]. Protein MMP1499 is
identified as a transcriptional regulator with a Helix-turnhelix (HTH) motif, but its exact role has not been
reported.
Among the genes that are uniquely shared by various
methanogenic archaea (or these archaea plus A. fulgidus),
two large gene clusters responsible for methanogenesis are
found. The proteins MMP1346, MMP1560–MMP1564
and MMP1566–MMP1567 (Table 5) are parts of an eightcomponent complex, coenzyme M methyltransferase

(Mtr), which catalyzes an energy-conserving, sodium-iontranslocating step in methanogenesis from H2 and CO2
[84]. M. maripaludis contains all of the known Mtr subunits, but the gene coding for MtrF is fused into the N-terminal region of MtrA [53]. All other methanogenic
archaeal genomes contain complete set of mtr genes. It is
of interest to note that for the protein MMP1567 (MtrH),
homologues with low E-values are also found in two Desulfitobacterium hafniense strains as well as in three Rhizobiales species (Aminobacter lissarensis, Methylobacterium
chloromethanicum, and Hyphomicrobium chloromethanicum;
α-proteobacteria) (see note in Table 5). These three rhizobiae species can use methyl halides as a sole source of carbon and energy, and all of them possess a set of cmu genes
which are essential for methyl chloride degradation [85].
In particular, the CmuB protein which is homologous to
MMP1567 transfers a methyl group to methylcobalamin:H4 folate (H4F), which is analogous to the reverse of
the reaction catalyzed by MtrH in archaea [86]. In view of
the sequence and functional similarity between MtrH and
CmuB proteins, it is likely that the mtrH gene was laterally
transferred from a methanogenic archaeon to the common ancestor of the above three rhizobiae species to serve

Page 13 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:86

the new functional role. The function of the laterally
transferred mtrH related gene in D. hafniense is not known
at present.
The proteins MMP1555–MMP1559 in Table 5 form
another gene cluster, encoding the subunits of Methylcoenzyme M reductase (MCR). This complex catalyzes the
final reaction of the energy conserving pathway in which
methylcoenzyme M and coenzyme B are converted to
methane and the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB [87,88].
Except for these proteins, the other proteins listed in Table
5 are of putative or unknown functions. It is likely that
these proteins are involved in some aspects of methanogenesis or other unknown pathways unique to methanogenic archaea. These proteins provide molecular markers
for methanogens, which can be used for identification of
new archaeal species capable of methane production.
The blast searches of the M. maripaludis [53] and M. kandleri [56] genomes have identified 10 proteins that are
uniquely shared by all of the following species belonging
to the orders Methanobacteriales (M. thermoautotrophicus), Methanococcales (M. jannaschii, M. maripaludis) and
Methanopyrales (M. kandleri) (Table 6(b)). Of these, only
2 proteins are present in M. stadtmanae, which is also a
Methanobacteriales that has lost most of its genes due to
its adaptation to the human intestine [78]. The genes for
these 10 proteins likely evolved in a common ancestor of
the above groups of methanogens (Fig. 3), which corresponds to the cluster of methanogenic archaea referred to
as "Class I methanogens" [13]. Interestingly, these studies
have also identified 10 proteins that are uniquely shared
by these methanogenic orders and M. hungatei (see Table
6(a)), which branches distantly in phylogenetic trees [13].
The unique presence of these proteins in these methanogens suggests that species from these groups shared a common ancestor exclusive of other methanogenic archaea
(Fig. 3).
Fifteen additional proteins discovered in this work (Table
6(c)) are uniquely present in M. kandleri and various
Methanobacteriales indicating that these two groups are
more closely related to each other than the Methanococcales (Fig. 3). We have also come across 7 proteins that are
uniquely shared by Methanococcales and Methanobacteriales (Table 6(d)), and 4 proteins that are only present in
Methanococcales and Methanopyrales (Table 6(e)). The
most likely explanation to account for the species distributions of these latter proteins is that their genes also originated in a common ancestor of the above three groups of
methanogens, but were selectively lost in either the Methanobacteriales or Methanopyrales lineages. These analyses have also identified 14 additional proteins that are
uniquely present in all 5 Methanosarcinales species (Table
6(f)), as well as 7 proteins that are only found in various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

Methanosarcinales and M. hungatei (Table 6(g)). Lastly,
these studies have also identified 55 proteins that are
uniquely present in M. maripaludis and M. jannaschii
(Methanococcales, see Additional file 3(a)) and 68 proteins that are only present in M. burtonii and 3 Methanosarcina species, all belonging to the Methanosarcinaceae
family (see Additional file 3(b)) (Fig. 3) indicating that
they are likely distinctive characteristics of species from
these groups.
Of the proteins that are uniquely found in Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanopyrales and Methanomicrobiales, 12 proteins viz. MMP1448–MMP1454,
MMP1456, MMP1458–MMP1460 and MMP1467 are
from a big gene cluster eha, which encodes the multisubunit membrane-bound [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase [89]. Two of
these proteins, MMP1456 and MMP1458, are only found
in Methanococcales (Table 6(e)). The whole eha operon is
composed of 20 ORFs in the genome of M. thermoautotrophicus and of these only these 12 proteins are
restricted to these methanogens while the other subunits
have counterparts in bacteria. The precise roles of these 12
proteins, which are predicted to be integral membrane
proteins in the hydrogenase complex, have not been
determined [89]. Among the other proteins that are specific for these groups of methanogens, MMP0127 and
MMP1716 are Hmd homologs, which catalyze the reversible dehydrogenation of N5, N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin [90]. In the proteins that are specific
for the Methanococcales (see Additional file 3(a)), one
large gene cluster (MMP0233–MMP0240) is found, but
no information is available concerning its possible function. Except for these proteins, all other proteins that are
specific for these methanogenic archaea are of unknown
or putative function.
Proteins that are specific for Thermococci
Thermococci are obligately thermophilic, strictly anaerobic cocci, which are able to convert elemental sulfur to
hydrogen sulfide. Thus, they are so called "extremely thermophilic sulfur metabolizer", which comprise one of the
main functional groups within Euryarchaeota. According
to the Bergey's Manual [75], the class Thermococci contains only one family, Thermococcaceae, consisting of 2
genera: Thermococcus and Pyrococcus. Currently, 4 species
from this family have been completely sequenced (Pyrococcus abyssi, P. horikoshii, P. furiosus and Thermococcus
kodakarensis; see Table 1) [52,91-93]. The blast searches
on each protein from P. abyssi have identified 141 proteins that are shared by all 4 of these species (see Additional file 4(a)). All of these proteins show high degree of
conservation within Thermococci and they do not have
homologs in any other prokaryotes or eukaryotes except
one possible LGT event (PAB1493, see note in Additional
file 4). The genes for these proteins have likely evolved in

Page 14 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:86

a common ancestor of the Thermococci (Fig. 3). Of these
proteins, PAB1510 is annotated as TBP-interacting protein
(TIP), which forms complex with TBP (TATA-binding protein) to regulate transcription [94]. It is known that the
archaeal transcription machinery is strikingly similar to
that in eukaryotes [23], but no TBP-binding component
was found in archaeal species until the discovery of the
TIP in T. kodakaraensis [95,96]. Most other Themococcispecific proteins are of unknown function, although in a
few cases limited similarity to domains in known protein
families have been noted. A number of proteins (viz.
PAB0643–PAB0644.1n; PAB1821–PAB1826) are clustered together in the P. abyssi genome, and it is possible
that they may form functional units and are involved in
related functions.
Cohen et al. [52] have reported a large number of proteins
which are restricted to the Pyrococcus genus. However, a
number of proteins from their list are also found in T.
kodakarensis KOD1 [93], whose genome was not available
when their work was published. Some proteins are not
specific for either Pyrococcus or Thermococci according to
our criteria and some of them are only found in one species – P. abyssi. Our analysis of the P. abyssi GE5 genome
has also identified 43 proteins that are unique to the Pyrococcus genus (see Additional file 4(b)). Again, almost all of
these proteins are of unknown function except PAB2241,
which is annotated as RNase P, but this annotation seems
arbitrary as it does not show significant sequence similarity to known RNases. The proteins that are uniquely found
in the 3 Pyrococcus genomes likely evolved in a common
ancestor of this genus (Fig. 4).
Proteins that are specific for Halobacteria
Extreme halophiles constitute another major class within
Euryarchaeota. They require 5–10 times the salinity of seawater (ca. 3–5 M NaCl) for optimal growth [17,97]. In
order to grow in such high salinity environments, they
have developed a set of physiological adaptation, such as:
high internal concentration of potassium chloride, acidic
proteome with low pI value, high GC content with GC
bias in the wobble position, unique chloride pumps to
maintain osmotic balance, etc. [17,98,99]. Among
archaea, halobacteria also have the unique ability to use
solar energy to generate a proton gradient to synthesize
ATP. So far, the Class Halobacteria harbors one family
with 15 genera and 4 species have been completely
sequenced, including Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, Haloarcula
marismortui, H. walsbyi and Natronomonas pharaonis
[54,98,100,101]. By performing blast searches on each
protein in the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome, we have
identified 127 proteins, which are only present in all 4
Halobacteria species with only 3 exceptions (see Additional file 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

Of the proteins listed in this Table, VNG0016H,
VNG1096H, VNG2414H and VNG2563H are annotated
as DNA-binding proteins or regulators because of the
presence of HTH domain, but their exact functions have
not been reported. VNG0667G is an ATP-binding protein
of ABC transporter family. Several other proteins, such as
VNG2089H and VNG2628H, have also been assigned
possible functions based on weak similarity to known
conserved domains in the CDD database [102], but their
exact functions remain to be determined. Because of their
high degree of conservation and uniqueness to halobacteria, the genes for these proteins likely evolved in a common ancestor of Halobacteria (Fig. 4) and they are
presumably involved in unique physiological functions
related to their adaptation to the hypersaline environment. Because of their specificity for Halobacteria, these
proteins provide useful biomarkers for this group of species.
In addition to these proteins that are specific to all
sequenced halobacterial species, we have also identified a
large number of proteins either uniquely shared by 3
halobacterial species or only found in 2 halobacterial species (see Additional files 6 and 7). Surprisingly, these proteins are present in different combinations of
halobacterial species. The four-halobacterial species are
from 4 different genera within the Halobacteriales order
and their relationships are unclear at present. The largest
numbers of these proteins (i.e. 56) are uniquely shared by
the Haloarcula, Haloquadratum and Natronomonas species,
followed by 49 proteins that are restricted to Haloquadratum and Haloarcula. These results suggest that of these
three species, Haloquadratum and Haloarcula are more
closely related to each other and that Halobacterium might
be the deepest branching of the four available halobacterial species (Fig. 4). However, the genome size of these
halobacterial species varies and some of these protein
sequences are present on plasmids found in these species,
which makes it difficult to reliably infer their relationships
solely based on the number of shared proteins. Among
the proteins that are specific for halobacteria, only few
have been assigned possible functions. Protein
VNG2178H is annotated as PhiH1-like repressor and
VNG0584H is assigned as a Rieske Fe-S protein. Two additional proteins VNG1720H and VNG2562H have been
annotated as iron-binding proteins because of their similarity with FhuD and TroA_a domains, respectively [102].
All of the other proteins are of unknown function.
Proteins that are specific for Thermoplasmata
The Thermoplasmata group is comprised of cell wall-less
archaea, which resemble the bacterial Mycoplasma species
[63]. Generally, they are thermoacidophilic, aerobic or
facultative anaerobic, and are able to reduce sulfur to H2S
under anaerobic conditions [19,55]. To date, this class

include three families-Thermoplasmaceae, Picrophilaceae, and Ferroplasmaceae, each represented by one
genus [103,104]. Three complete genomes from this class
(T. acidophilum, T. volcanium and P. torridus) are available
at present (see Table 1) [19,55,63] and Ferroplasma acidarmanus Fer1 genome is draft assembled and sequence
information for this is also available in the NCBI database. Our analyses have uncovered 77 proteins that are
uniquely present in all four species belonging to this class
(see Additional file 8(a)) (Fig. 4). Most of these proteins
are present in all four available genomes, but a few are
missing in one or two species, which is probably due to
gene loss. Besides, we have also identified 33 proteins,
which are shared only by the two Thermoplasma species

(see Additional file 8(b)) and 17 proteins unique to P. torridus and F. acidarmanus (see Additional file 8(c)). The latter proteins indicate that species from Picrophilaceae and
Ferroplasmaceae families are more closely related to each
other (Fig. 4). All of these proteins are of unknown or predicted functions.
Proteins restricted to several archaeal lineages or showing sporadic
distribution
In addition to the above proteins that are restricted to specific lineages of archaea, we have also identified 63 proteins, which are shared by several archaeal groups (see
Table 7). The distribution pattern of these proteins could
provide useful insights concerning the phylogenetic rela-

tionship between different groups. However, their distribution patterns could also be explained by gene losses in
specific lineages or LGT between particular groups. Table
7 shows many proteins that are uniquely shared by various methanogenic archaea, Archaeoglobus and Thermococci. The first 5 proteins in Table 7(a) (PAB0076,
PAB0138, PAB0965, PAB1927 and PAB1994) are present
in all of the Thermococci and most of the methanogens.
Four of these proteins are also present in A. fulgidus. The
next 13 proteins in this Table are also uniquely found in
most of the Thermococci as well as a number of methanogens and also in many cases in A. fulgidus. In addition, 6
proteins listed in Table 7(b) are only found in various
Thermococci and A. fulgidus. These results suggest a closer
relationship between the methanogenic archaea, A. fulgidus and Thermococci within the Euryarchaeota lineage.
In conjunction with our earlier inference that A. fulgidus
forms an outgroup of the methanogenic archaea, these
results suggest that the above three groups are related in
the following manner: Thermococci → A. fulgidus →
Methanogens.
Although the relationship suggested above is the most
likely explanation for the observed results, we have also
come across three proteins (VNG1263c, MMP11287 and
VNG2408c) that are uniquely present in various Halobacteria, A. fulgidus and different methanogens. To account
for their species distribution, one has to postulate that
their genes have been selectively lost from the Thermococci. In addition, 9 proteins are only found in various
Halobacteria as well as Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales (Table 7(c)). Their distribution requires
again either selective gene losses from other lineages or
LGT from Halobacteria to these methanogens.
Our analyses have also uncovered 30 proteins that are
uniquely shared by species from Thermoplasmata and
Sulfolobus (see Table 7(d)). Among these proteins, 7 are
present in all Thermoplasmata and Sulfolobus species for
which sequence information is available, while the
remainder are missing in 1 or more species. It has been
reported that there has been much lateral gene transfer
between T. acidophilum and S. solfataricus, both of which
inhabit the same environment [55]. However, the shared
presence of these proteins in these two groups could also
result from a unique shared ancestry of these thermo-acidophilic archaea.
Another 43 Archaea-specific proteins are sporadically
present in different archaeal species (see Additional file
9). A number of proteins in this group are present in a limited number (between 3 to 6) of archaeal species belonging to different groups. There are 2 possible explanations
that can account for their sporadic distribution: First, it is
possible that some of these genes are the remnants of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

sequences that also originated in an ancestral lineage of
Archaea but they have been selectively lost in many species because they are not required for growth. Second, the
sporadic presence of these genes in a number of archaeal
species can also be explained if some of these genes originally evolved in a particular group or species of archaea
and then transferred to other archaea by LGT [105]. However, in view of the observed specificity of these genes/proteins for archaea, the LGTs in these cases need to be
selective and limited to within archaea.

Conclusion
Comparative analyses of sequenced archaeal genomes
presented here have led to identification of large numbers
of proteins that are distinctive characteristics of either all
archaea or its different main groups. Based upon these
proteins, all of the main groups within Archaea (e.g. Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Halobacteria, Thermococci,
Thermoplasmata, Methanogens) and their subgroups can
now be clearly distinguished in molecular terms. The species distribution of these signature proteins strongly suggests that their genes have evolved or originated at various
stages in the evolution of archaea, but once evolved, they
are indicated to be generally stably retained in various
descendents of these lineages with minimal gene loss or
LGTs. Based upon the species distributions of these proteins, the evolutionary stages where the genes for these
proteins have likely evolved are shown in Fig. 4. The evolutionary relationships among archaea have thus far been
mainly inferred on the basis of their branching in phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and certain protein
sequences [2,7,13,23-25]. The results of our analyses
although they support many inferences reached based on
phylogenetic trees (viz. identification of all of the main
clades in phylogenetic trees in molecular terms) (Fig. 1)
[2,7,13,23-25], they also differ from them in important
regards. In particular, our results shed important light on
certain phylogenetic relationships that were very puzzling
or were not resolved based on earlier studies. Some of
these novel inferences are discussed below.
In phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and various proteins sequences, the methanogenic archaea form at least
two distinct clusters (see Fig. 1) [13,29,34,56,106]. In
addition, in many of these trees, M. kandleri branches distinctly from all other methanogenic archaea [13,34,48].
The methanogenic archaea in these trees are interspersed
by other groups of non-methanogenic archaea such as
Halobacteriales, Archaeoglobus, Thermoplasmatales and
Thermococcales (see Fig. 1) [13,34,48]. This has led to
important questions concerning the origin of methanogenesis i.e. whether it evolved only once and its absence
in the intervening lineages [13,29,35,76]. To account for
these results, it has been suggested that methanogenesis
evolved once in a common ancestor of the above groups,

Page 17 of 23

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:86

i.e. different methanogenic archaea, Halobacteriales,
Archaeoglobus, Thermoplasmatales and also possibly
Thermococcales, comprising virtually all euryarchaeota,
but that the various genes involved in this process were
subsequently lost from different groups except the methanogens [13,29,56]. This scenario, in essence, proposes
that the common ancestor of different physiologically and
metabolically distinct groups within euryarchaeota was a
methanogen and this capability was independently lost in
all other lineages.
In contrast to this proposal, our phylogenomics analyses
have identified 31 proteins that are uniquely present in
virtually all methanogens, as well as many proteins that
are specifically shared by different subgroups of methanogens. Of these proteins only about 1/3 are indicated to be
directly involved in methanogenesis and the cellular functions of others are presently not known. The unique presence of such large numbers of proteins by nearly all
methanogens, but none of the above groups of archaea,
strongly indicates that the genes for these proteins evolved
in a common ancestor of various methanogens. These
results strongly suggest that all methanogenic archaea
form a mononphyletic lineage exclusive of all other
groups of archaea (Fig. 4). Importantly, these studies have
also identified 10 proteins that are uniquely shared by all
methanogens as well as by A. fulgidus. In contrast, we have
not come across any protein that various methanogenic
archaea uniquely share with any of the Halobacterales or
Thermoplasmatales. These observations are highly significant because they strongly suggest that Archaeoglobus
and all of the methanogens shared a common ancestor
exclusive of all other archaea. In other words, the ancestral
lineage that led to the origin of methanogenesis very likely
evolved from the Archaeoglobus lineage (Fig. 4). It is also
significant that of the proteins that are uniquely shared by
Archaeoglobus and methanogens, several form part of
complexes that are important for nitrogen assimilation
and methanogenesis. These results support the view that
these characteristics have their origin within the Archaeoglobus lineage.
The present work also provides clarification regarding the
phylogenetic position of M. kandleri. In phylogenetic trees
based on 16S rRNA or different protein sequences, the
branching of this species is highly variable [13,34,47,48]
and it often forms the deepest branch within the Euryarchaeota. In the present work, we have identified 31 proteins that are uniquely shared by all methanogens
including M. kandleri, as well as 10 proteins that M. kandleri specifically shares with various Methanobacteriales
and Methanococcales, and 15 additional proteins that are
only found in M. kandleri and the two Methanobacteriales
species (M. thermoautotrophicus and M. stadtmanae). These
observations reliably place M. kandleri with other metha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

nogenic archaea with the Methanobacteriales as its closest
relatives (Fig. 4). Our results also suggest a closer relationship of the Thermococcales to the Archaeoglobus and
methanogenic archaea, although this relationship is not
as strongly supported as between Archaeoglobus and
Methanogens.
The observed differences in the evolutionary relationships
among methanogens based upon phylogenomics analyses versus those by traditional phylogenetic methods can
in principle be accounted for by three explanations. First,
it is possible that the branching patterns of various clades
in phylogenetic trees are misleading and they have been
affected by factors such as long branch attraction effect
[107,108]. Second, the polyphyletic branching of methanogens can also be explained (as indicated earlier) if the
genes uniquely shared by all methanogens evolved in an
early branching lineage such as M. kandleri, but subsequently they were either completely or partially lost from
various non-methanogenic (viz. Halobacteriales, Thermoplasmatales and Archaeoglobus) groups that lie in
between the two methanogenic clusters (Fig. 1). Third, lateral transfer of these genes from one methanogenic
archaea to all others can also explain these results. Of
these possibilities, we favour the first explanation, as the
last two require extensive gene loss or LGT from (or into)
multiple independent lineages.
The present work also supports the placement of N. equitans within the Euryarchaeota lineage. N. equitans has a
very small genome (only 0.49 Mb), which is at least 3
times smaller than any other archaeal genome. Due to its
very small size, there are only 6 genes that N. equitans
uniquely shares with all other archaea. However, our analysis indicates that whereas N. equitans shares a few genes
(PAB2404 and PAB 0188) with most of the Euryarchaeota, it does not share any gene uniquely with most of the
Crenarchaeota species, indicating its closer affinity for the
former lineage. Although our analysis of the N. equitans
genome has not revealed any strong signals indicating its
specific affinity for any of the Euryarchaeota groups, the
shared presence of some proteins by N. equitans and Thermococci (and in some cases also A. fulgidus and methanogens) suggest that it may be related to the Thermococci.
However, because of the extensive gene losses that have
occurred in this genome, we are not able to draw any reliable inference in this regard. Therefore, although we have
depicted N. equitans as a deep branching lineage within
Euryarchaeota (Fig. 4), based upon our analysis, its placement within Euryarchaeota is not resolved.
The present work also suggests that Thermoplasmatales
might be a deeper branching lineage within Euryarchaeota in comparison to the Thermococcales, Halobacteriales, Archaoglobous and Methanogens. This inference is

Page 18 of 23

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:86

suggested by the observation that a number of proteins
that are uniquely present in almost all other Euryarcheota
species are missing in the Thermoplasmatales. Although
the absence of these proteins in the Thermoplasmatales
can be explained by specific gene loss, the possibility that
the genes for at least some of these proteins have evolved
after the branching of Thermoplasmatales deserves serious consideration. The deeper branching of the Thermoplasmatales within the Euryarchaeota will place it closer
to the Crenarchaeota. Such a placement could prove helpful in understanding why so many genes (i.e. 30) are
uniquely shared by various Thermoplasmatales and the
Sulfolobales.
For the archaeal-specific proteins identified in the present
work, sequence information at present is available from
only a limited number of archaeal species. Hence, it is
important to obtain information for these genes/proteins
from other archaeal species to confirm whether these proteins are distinctive characteristics of the specified groups
or a subgroup of such species. These proteins in addition
to their utility for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies
also provide valuable means for understanding archaeal
biology [35,38]. The cellular functions of most of these
proteins are not known and further studies in this regard
should prove very helpful in the discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique
to either all or different groups of archaea [38]. Lastly, the
primary sequences of many of these genes/proteins are
also highly conserved and they provide novel means for
identification of different groups of archaea in various
environmental settings by means of PCR amplification
and other molecular biological and immunological methods.

Methods
Identification of Archaea-specific proteins
To identify proteins which are specific for Archaea or its
various subgroups, all proteins in the genomes of A. pernix
K1 (APE), S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 (Saci), P. aerophilum
str. IM2 (PAE), P. abyssi GE5 (PAB), M. maripaludis S2
(MMP), M. kandleri AV19 (MK), M. burtonii DSM 6242
(Mbu), Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (VNG), H. walsbyi DSM
16790 (HQ), T. acidophilum DSM 1728 (Ta) and P. torridus DSM 9790 (PTO), were analyzed. Protein-protein
blast searches were carried out on each individual protein
using the default parameters, without the low complexity
filter, to identify different proteins where all significant
hits were from archaea [109]. The results of blast searches
were inspected for sudden increase in Expected values (Evalues) from the last archaeal species in the search to the
first non-archaeal organism. The proteins that were of
interest generally involved a large increase in E-values
from the last archaeal hit to the first hit from any other
organism. Further, the E values of these latter hits were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/86

expected to be in a range higher than 10-4, which indicates
a weak level of similarity that could occur by chance.
However, higher E-values are sometimes acceptable for
smaller proteins as the magnitude of the E-value depends
upon the length of the query sequence.
All promising proteins identified by the above criteria
were further analyzed using the position-specific iterated
(PSI) blast program. In the present work, a protein was
considered to be archaeal-specific if all hits producing significant alignments were from the indicated groups of
archaeal species. However, we have also retained a few
proteins where 1 or 2 isolated species from other groups
(e.g. bacteria or eukaryotes) also had acceptable E-values.
We consider these proteins to be also archaea-specific and
their presence in isolated unrelated species is very likely
due to lateral gene transfer. For all archaea-specific proteins described here, the protein ID, accession number
and their possible functions (also COG or CDD number
[102,110]) are presented in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. All proteins indicated in various tables are specific for the Archaea based
on these criteria unless otherwise mentioned.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses was carried out on a concatenated
sequence alignment of 31 universally distributed proteins
[45]. The information regarding these proteins is provided
in the Additional file 10. For each of these proteins
sequences from all 29 archaeal species were downloaded
and multiple sequence alignments were created using
ClustalX 1.83 program. A concatenated sequence alignment for all 31 proteins was imported into Gblocks 0.91b
[111] to remove poorly aligned region. The resulting final
alignment of 6,252 amino acid sites was used for phylogenetic analyses. A NJ tree based on this dataset was constructed by TREECON 1.3b program with Kimura twoparameter model distance [112]; Maximum-Likelihood
tree were computed under a WAG+F model plus a gamma
distribution with four categories by TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
[113,114]; Maximum-Parsimony tree were obtained by
Mega 3.1 package [115]. All of the trees were bootstrapped
100 times.

Authors' contributions
BG carried out blast searches on different proteins and
was responsible for the initial evaluation of the results.
RSG conceived and directed this study and was responsible for the final evaluation of the results. BG prepared a
rough draft of the manuscript under RSG's directions,
which was revised and modified by RSG. All authors have
read and approved the final manuscript.
