Revolver transposon-like multi-gene family in
Triticeae

Abstract
Background: Revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the Triticeae genome.
Revolver encompasses 2929 to 3041 bp, has 20 bp of terminal inverted repeated sequences at both ends, and
contains a transcriptionally active gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein. A putative TATA box is located at
base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Revolver shows
considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives.
Results: Revolver cDNAs varied between 395 and 2,182 bp in length. The first exon exhibited length variation, but
the second and third exons were almost identical. These variants in the Revolver family shared the downstream
region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5’ first exon. There were 58 clones, which showed partial
homology to Revolver, among 440,000 expressed sequence tagged (EST) clones sourced from Triticeae. In these
Revolver homologues with lengths of 360-744 bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved (65-79%
homology), but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into 12 types, and
did not have EST sequences with open reading frames (ORFs). By PCR with the 3’-flanking region of a typical
genomic clone of Revolver-2 used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1R and 5R could be simultaneously
identified. Extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among 161 genotypes of the single
species Triticum dicoccoides collected from 18 populations in Israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic
stresses (soil, temperature, altitude, water availability, and pathogens).
Conclusions: On the base of existing differences between Revolver variants, the molecular markers that can
distinguish different rye chromosomes were developed. Eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer T. dicoccoides
in Israel and high Revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses. The remarkable
quantitative differences among copy numbers of Revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest
strong amplification activity within the last 10,000 years. It is the interesting finding because the majority of
Triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for BARE-1 element in
Hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution.

Background
In the higher plants, only a small percentage of the genome is required for maintenance of life [1,2], and transposable elements and the sequences derived from them
are scattered in the other highly repetitive DNA regions
[3-6]. The transposable elements are classified into the
class I transposable elements (retrotransposons), which

use a transcript as a template and transfer replicatively,
and class II transposable elements (transposons), which
transfer DNA by the cut-and-paste mechanism. It is
believed that class I long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and class II miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are major components of the
plant genome [7-10]. Such transfer factors can be used
as the source of mutations for DNA marker development or gene functional analysis; the transposable elements with a high number of copies can become the
entry points for PCR during DNA marker development,

and the transposable elements that cause gene disruption enable tagging of genes and contribute to functional
genome research [11,12]. However, the sequences of
regions of repetitive DNA other than the known transposable elements [13,14] are still undetermined, while in
the region of repetitive DNA regarded as junk DNA, it
has been found that the RNA genes that perform epigenetic regulation of gene expression are also scattered
[15-17]. Investigation of the unknown factors in repetitive DNA regions is also important as a key to understanding the mechanisms of genome control and
phenotypic expression.
The first authors recently reported a new transposonlike gene, named Revolver, in Triticeae [18,19]. A part of
the reiterated sequence (89 bp) specific to the rye genome was cloned by the genome subtraction technique,
which deducts the sequence in common with bread
wheat from the rye genome [20]. In order to determine
the entire structure of this reiterated sequence, the l
FixII genomic library of the rye-inbred line was screened
by using 89 bp of the repetitive clone as a probe, and
the base sequence of a region of about 21.6 kb was
decoded in three lambda clones. As a result, the insertion-type consensus sequence (92% homology) with a
full-length sequence of 3,041 bp sandwiched between 20
bp of specific terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequence
was determined and shown to be similar to the class II
transposable elements [18,21-26]. Revolver contains one
gene that codes for an open reading frame (ORF) of a
deduced 139 amino acid residue that is actively transcribed into mRNA. The sequence of the 20 bp inverted
repeat sequence at both ends is different from that of
the known transposons represented by hAT, CACTA,
and Mutator, and 10 bp of the tandemly repeated
sequence is also repeated in the subterminal region.
In a genomic DNA clones of rye that show homology
to Revolver, great structural variation in the region ranging from the first exon to the first intron had arisen
and four sequences thought to be nonautonomous factors for Revolver were found. Revolver produces 0.7 kb
of mRNA and is conserved in Triticeae. A putative
TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base
261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at
base 2918 [18]. On the other hand, the full length of the
nonautonomic factor is 2665 to 4269 bp. The nonautonomic factor has a 37-149-bp homologous region
upstream from the transcription start site containing a
TIR at the 5’ end and a 1294-2112-bp region covering
from around the second exon to the 3’ end on the 3’
side. A region of 549-2007 bps located between them
(equivalent to the region from the first exon to the first
intron) is destroyed. In rye and barley, the nonautonomic factors sharing each end with Revolver are considered to exist within it [19].

The number of copies in Triticeae was computed by
Southern blot analysis and slot blotting techniques by
using cDNA of Revolver as the probe. Consequently,
extremely high numbers of Revolver (20,000 copies)
have been shown to exist in Dasypyrum villosum and
Secale sp., as well as in diploid species such as Triticum
monococcum, which is the ancestor of bread wheat and
tetraploid species such as emmer wheat, with around
10,000 copies. However, the number of copies is extremely low in hexaploid bread wheat. There has been a
large quantitative change during the evolution of Triticeae resulting in amplification of Revolver in some species and its disappearance in bread wheat [18]. The
considerable quantitative variability of Revolver among
the wheat-related species strongly indicates its propagation or differential loss, activity, and diversity in recent
evolutionary times.
In this paper, the structural divergence of Revolver in
genomic DNA and RNA was analyzed, and length variants of the Revolver family were used as chromosome
tags to search the publicly disclosed expressed sequence
tag (EST) database of the 440,000 Triticeae EST
sequences for Revolver homologues. Moreover, we
examined the quantitative variations of Revolver in 161
T. dicoccoides accessions [27] representing 18 populations collected from various locations in Israel, which
encompass a wide range of ecologic conditions of soil,
temperature, altitude, and water availability, to determine the effects of ecologic stress on quantitative
variation.

Results and Discussion
Structural diversity of Revolver mRNA

Revolver, encompassing a 3,041 bp sequence, has 20 bp
of TIR sequences and contains a transcriptionally-active
gene, consisting of three exons (342 bp, 88 bp, and 296
bp) and two introns (750 bp and 1,237 bp) (Figure 1),
and encodes a DNA-binding-like protein [18]. Fifty
cDNA clones of the Revolver family were obtained from
self-fertile rye (homozygous genotype), and a structural
analysis was performed. The total lengths of typical
Revolver cDNAs were 665 to 723 bp in 40 clones out of
50 cDNAs, and they were classified into three subfamilies (I, II, and III) in which the regions of the second
and third exons were almost identical, while the region
of the first exon exhibited a low homology of 60%
among the subfamilies because of duplication or deletion (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). The homologies in
the subfamilies were 89% ( I), 97% ( II), and 93% ( III),
and the homologies between the subfamilies were 75%
for subfamily I and subfamily III, 80% for subfamily I
and subfamily III, and 76% for subfamily I and subfamily
III. Comparing sequences between the exons, the second
exon (89 to 92 bp) and the third exon (293 bp)

exhibited high homologies of 91 to 95% between the different subfamilies. In contrast, the first exon exhibited
high homology within the subfamilies (I: 98%, II: 99%,
and III: 99%); but the homologies between subfamilies
were low (63% between I and II, 64% between I and III,
and 67% between II and III). In the first exon, partial
deletions and mutations of different lengths were found
in the base sequences of the three classes. Thus, the
classification of the cDNA corresponds to the structural
divergence of the first exon. Because repetitive sequence
units composed of 8 to 14 bp are present in the same
direction in the first exon, a nonhomologous recombination between alleles might have caused various structural mutations.
Moreover, cDNAs exhibiting completely different
structures at the first exon were found in 50 cDNA
clones from self-fertile rye (Figure 1). Among them, five
cDNAs had a total length of 1,597 bp and contained the
second intron (1,210 bp) and the third exon (301 bp) of
Revolver, but at the 5’ terminus, they had an 86 bp
sequence that was not observed in Revolver. On the
other hand, four cDNA clones had a total length of 395
bp and lacked the second intron compared to the cDNA
clones of 1,597 bp described above. Meanwhile, another
cDNA clone (total length of 2,182 bp) had the second
exon (90 bp) and the third exon (260 bp) of Revolver,
but the region corresponding to the first exon was
extremely long and had no homology with the other
cDNA clones. As stated above, the members of the
Revolver family, having a common structure downstream
of the second intron, may easily undergo various structural changes at the 5’ first exon and then become
divergent and show different lengths. Such structural

diversities were found in the first exon of the Revolver
genes that were obtained from the self-fertile pure rye
strains, and these structural diversities may be useful for
development of DNA markers in the rye genome.
Furthermore, Revolver cDNAs were recovered from S.
silvestre, D. villosum, T. monococcum, and Aegilops
tauschii after isolation by RT-PCR with 22-mer primers
used at both ends. The majority belonged to subfamilies
I (47%) or II (27%) of S. cereale, indicating that two
major subfamilies were conserved within the Triticum
species. Among the Revolver mRNAs, subfamily I contained a single ORF encoding 139 amino acid residues
[18], which was conserved in the Triticum species with
98% homology. The Revolver ORF was integrated into
the pET-32 vector, and the encoded protein fused with
thioredoxin was produced in Escherichia coli (Figure
2A). The molecular weight of the fused protein was
about 50,000, and that after treatment with Factor Xa
was about 30,000 (Superdex 75 gel filtration). The protein structure encoded by Revolver was predicted by the
Protein Folding Recognition program Robetta. As shown
in Figure 2B, the Revolver ORF includes the c2rf9 motif
of a kinase domain.
Expressed sequence tag homologues of Revolver

In this study, we searched the publicly disclosed EST
database for Revolver homologues. Of the 440,000 Triticeae EST clones in GenBank having mainly T. aestivum
as their source, 63 clones showed partial homology with
Revolver (46 T. aestivum, 6 S. cereale, 4 T. monococcum,
2 Ae. speltoides, and 5 H. vulgare) (Figure 3). These
Revolver homologues were about 360-744 bp in length.
Only two clones, which were from T. aestivum (615 bp)

and H. vulgare (713 bp), showed similarity with Revolver
cDNA across its entire length (Figure 4B). Sequences
downstream of exon 2 were conserved (about 65-79%
identity) in other EST clones (Figure 3B), although they
had either low homology in the 5’ regions containing
exon 1 (Figure 3A), or were missing in the upstream
sequence. S. cereale, Einkorn wheats, and Ae. tauschii,
all of which showed high levels of Revolver transcription
by northern blotting, have cloned cDNA from the Revolver ORF coding for the 139 amino acids (Class I)
together with 2 cDNAs differing in exon 1 sequences
(Class II, III). The 615-bp EST from T. aestivum, which
had the highest sequence similarity to Revolver, was
close to Class II (Figures 3A and 4B); however, the exon
1 region was only 60% homologous. Other EST clones
containing the exon 1 region matched none of the three
classes and were very different from each other (Figures
3A and 4B). Revolver-like EST clones from T. aestivum
were classified into at least 12 types on the basis of
mutations in the exon 1 region, and these EST clones
exhibited large genetic variation (Figure 3A). Exon 2
and exon 3 regions showed three major clusters according to wheat, rye and barley species (Figure 3B). Thus,
Revolver-like transcripts do exist in T. aestivum,
although their proportion among total EST clones is

extremely small, and given that they include variants
with large mutations, no true Revolver genes were present. We hypothesize that Revolver was lost in T. aestivum because it lost its ability to be reinserted. On the
other hand, no Revolver homologues were found in the
Oryzeae EST database. In addition, Revolver was not
detected in the rice genome by Southern blot analysis.
Development of chromosomal markers with Revolver

A typical genomic clone of Revolver (Revolver-2 [18])
was located in this study on the rye 7R chromosome
because 492 bp of DNA was amplified only from the rye
7R chromosome addition line by PCR using the 5’-flanking region of Revolver-2, 5’-GCCTTTCGGCCTTC
CTCTCAGGCGG-3’, and its internal sequence of 5’GTACTTGGCATCGGTAGATGTTCGG-3’, as the primers. PCR was performed then with the 3’-flanking
region derived from the typical genomic clone of Revolver-2 as a single primer, and 4 DNA fragments (2.3 kb,
2.8 kb, 3.3 kb, and 4.3 kb) were amplified from the rye
genome, but nothing was amplified from the wheat genome (Figure 4A). Furthermore, when PCR was performed with the same primer and genomic DNA from
rye chromosome addition lines as a template, DNA fragments of 2.8 kb, 3.6 kb, and 4.3 kb were amplified from

regions showed three major clusters according to wheat, rye and barley species.

the 1R, 5R, and 6R chromosome addition lines, respectively (Figure 4B). PCR amplification with this single primer identified rye chromosomes 1R and 5R
simultaneously. Each DNA fragment derived from the
chromosome addition lines and four types of DNAs
amplified from the rye genome were sequenced (Additional file 2); and the variants were shown to have the
downstream region of the second intron, but they had
structural modifications at the 5’ first exon region as in
the cDNAs (Figure 4B). Such a difference in length in
Revolver allows the development of rye chromosome
markers.
Revolver-3 [18] comprises a total length of 4,269 bp,
and at the 3’ end it has a region of 2,112 bp from the
middle of the first intron of Revolver through the third
exon and reaches the 3’-terminal region (Figure 4B). In
this study, Revolver-3 was shown to be localized on the
6R chromosome because it was amplified with the 3’flanking region primer of Revolver-2 only from the rye
6R chromosome addition line. Furthermore, Revolver-5
located on the rye 1R chromosome had a total length of
2,665 bp, while at the 3’ side it had a region of 1,826 bp
extending from immediately before the second exon to
the 3’ terminus of Revolver (Figure 4A and 4B). At its 5’
side, the region homologous to Revolver is limited to

only 37 bp at the terminus; but a region of about 670
bp is homologous to Revolver-4 [18], which consists of
3,219 bp, and at the 3’ end it has a region of 1,806 bp
ranging from immediately before the second exon to the
3’ terminus of Revolver (Figure 4B). Finally, Revolver-6
located on the rye 5R chromosome (Figure 4A) had a
total length of 3,503 bp, and at the 3’ side, it had a
region of 1,294 bp from the middle of the second intron
to the 3’ terminus of Revolver. However, at the 5’ side,
there was no region homologous to Revolver, and the
121 bp sequence at the 5’ terminus was homologous to
Revolver-4 and Revolver-5 (Figure 4B).
As mentioned above, the members of the Revolver
family showed considerable length variation which was
attributed to structural changes in the first exon. Such a
divergence in length is also found in some transposons,
the CACTA family [28], the Mutator family [29], and
the MITE family [10], but no homology was detected
between Revolver and any of these. If the Revolver family
is a transposable element, these variants are assumed to
be nonautonomous elements. Revolver showed a variability that was considerably larger than the others. With
PCR primers comprising the sequences flanking the
length variants of Revolver scattered in the genome, the
chromosome on which each Revolver is located can be

(Revolver-2) used as a single primer amplified four DNA fragments (2.3 kb, 2.8 kb, 3.3 kb, and 4.3 kb) from the rye genome, but produced no
fragments from the wheat genome. With this primer, rye chromosomes 1R and 5R can be identified in the wheat genome. (B) Each DNA
fragment derived from the chromosome addition lines of 1R, 5R, and 6R (AB646252-646254) was a nonautonomous element of Revolver, with its
second intron and the downstream region, but with considerable structural changes at the 5’ end. Of the 440,000 Triticeae EST clones, only two
clones, which were from T. aestivum (615 bp) and H. vulgare (713 bp), showed similarity with Revolver cDNA across its entire length. Other EST
clones had low homology in the 5’ exon 1 regions.

determined or tagged, and such PCR primers can be utilized for detection and identification of the
chromosomes.
Quantitative variation of Revolver in wild Emmer wheat of
Israel

Among the Triticum species, Revolver shows the highest
copy number (19,000) in S. cereale, and the lowest copy
number (2,000) in T. aestivum [18]. In this study, the
copy numbers of Revolver in wild emmer wheat were
estimated by slot blot analysis. The Revolver cDNA subfamily I (pSc5, 694 bp), which is conserved in Triticum
species, was used as a probe. Wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides (AABB), is a tetraploid progenitor from
which modern tetraploid and hexaploid cultivated wheat
is derived. T. dicoccoides deserves to be considered as a
potential genetic resource for cereal improvement
because wild emmer harbors rich genetic diversity for
multiple disease resistances, agronomic traits of economic significance, and environmental adaptations [27].
The center of distribution and genetic diversity of T.
dicoccoides is found in the catchment area of the upper
Jordan Valley in Israel and its vicinity [30,31]. We examined the copy number of Revolver in wild emmer wheat

T. dicoccoides in 18 populations (161 genotypes), representing a wide range of ecologic conditions of soil, temperature, and water availability in Israel (Figure 5,
Additional files 3 and 4).
All populations were rich in copy number (Additional
file 4 and Figure 5). Most populations had a large variance in copy number from around 1,000 to 30,000,
despite the predominantly self-fertilizing nature of this
species. The populations in the catchment area of Yehudiyya, Gamla, Tabigha, and Rosh-Pinna, where semihumid and warm climatic conditions prevail, showed
high copy numbers, which were almost over 7,000 per
haploid genome and included several genotypes having
around 20,000 copies (Figure 5). Several populations had
higher numbers than 1,100: Yehudiyya shade or sun,
Amirim, Bet Oren, Bat Shelomo, Gamla, Giv’at Koah,
and J’aba. In the marginal mesic areas of Amirim, Bet
Oren, Bat Shelomo, and Giv’at Koah, the copy numbers
were very stable: between 6,000 and 8,000. In contrast,
the populations of the marginal steppic areas, such as,
Mt. Gerizim, Kokhav-Hashahar, and Gitit, included several genotypes with low copy numbers less than 1,000
(Figure 5). This pattern suggests that high Revolver copy
numbers in northern wild emmer populations appear to

Figure 5 The copy number of Revolver gene in wild emmer wheat T. dicoccoides in 18 populations (161 genotypes) representing a
wide range of ecologic conditions of soil, temperature, and water availability in Israel. The populations in the catchment area showed
high copy numbers almost over 7,000 per haploid genome and included several genotypes with around 20,000 copies. In contrast, the
populations of marginal steppic areas included several genotypes with low copy numbers less than 1,000. In the marginal mesic areas, copy
numbers were very stable (from 6,000 to 8,000). This considerable quantitative diversity in the single species and among or in the populations
suggests recent mobilization of Revolver by ecologic stresses.

be associated with biotic stresses, e.g., pathogens and
population densities.
The copy numbers in the populations of Yehudiyya,
Ammiad, and Tabigha showed a broad range (between
20,000 and less than 1,000) (Figure 5). Some populations
displayed gradual variations from low to high (e.g.,
Ammiad, Yehudiyya sun and Yehudiyya shade, J’aba,
Amirim, Bet Oren, Bat Shelomo, and Giv’at Koah).
About half of the populations had polymodal distribution. Some populations were extremely bimodal: Gamla
(4 genotypes were from 3,000-4,000 and 4 genotypes
were from 20,000-30,000) and Gitit (4 genotypes around
500 and 3 genotypes above 12,000) (Figure 5). The different modes of distributions among the populations
suggest differences in Revolver’s mobility in each population. In barley, the selective pressures under hot, dry
desert conditions significantly correlate with increasing
copy numbers of retrotransposon BARE-1 [32,33] and

microsatellite sequences [34]. Revolver showed a variance considerably larger than BARE-1. The propagation
activity of Revolver also might be responsive to both
regional and local environmental conditions and its
extensive quantitative diversity in the single species T.
dicoccoides as well as among its local populations at
microsites, such as, Yehudiyya and Tabigha, suggest the
recent mobilization of Revolver by ecological stresses.
Our results show that 6,000 or more copies of Revolver exist in the native line from the area that has much
precipitation and an average yearly temperature around
20°C; and there was a line that contained as many as
20,000 copies, as does rye wheat. On the other hand,
only a few hundred copies existed in the large majority
of the lines in the area where the hot-dry monsoon
occurred frequently (85 days per year) and the area
where the number of sultry nights reached 80 days per
year. The remarkable quantitative differences in Revolver

within the same species growing in different ecosystems
illustrate a strong amplification activity within the last
10,000 years.

Conclusions
Transposon-like factor Revolver (US granted patent
7351536), which is 3041 bp in length and includes a 20bp TIR on either end, is dispersed within the genomes
of Triticum species. Revolver contains an ORF coding
for an amino acid sequence of 139 residues that is conserved among Triticum species. In S. cereale, a 0.7-kb
mRNA is actively transcribed from this ORF. Southern
blot analysis revealed multiple copies of Revolver within
Secale and Dasypyrum species, as well as some copies in
diploid species, such as, Einkorn wheat and Aegilops
tauschii, and in tetraploid species, such as, Triticum
durum. In contrast, copies were not found in the hexaploid species T. aestivum, in which transcribed products
were also undetected by northern blot analysis. Through
evolution, Revolver has been amplified in several Triticum species while being lost in others. It is therefore a
useful gene for the development of DNA markers for
Triticeae-related species and for use in T. aestivum
breeding.
The novel high-copy Revolver family is transcriptionally active in rye. Some of the transposon-like elements
exist in high copy numbers in the genomes of most
eukaryotes, but the great majority of them are inactive,
and only a small portion of them retain the ability to
transpose [35,36]. Very few transposons have been
shown to be transcriptionally active. A copia-like retroelement BARE-1 dispersed in 10% of the barley genome
[37] is transcribed in somatic tissues [38]. Some LTR
retrotransposons such as tobacco Tnt1, Tto1, and
OARE-1 that are largely inactive, can be transcriptionally
activated under conditions of biotic and abiotic stress,
including wounding, oxidative stress, and pathogen
infection [39,40]. After stress-induced transcription, the
rice LTR retrotransposon Tos17 increased in genomic
copy number [41]. In maize, a survey of more than 4 ×
10 5 ESTs identified only 56 retrotransposon cDNAs,
supporting the notion that most retrotransposons are
inactive [6]. Furthermore, most of these maize
sequences are derived from the low-to-middle repetitive
LTR retrotransposons and not from the very high copynumber elements that have been responsible for doubling the size of the maize genome in the past 5-6 million years. In humans, only 30-60 L1 elements out of 5
× 105 comprising 45% of the genome are thought to be
active [42]. In general, high-copy retrotransposons show
low-level activity except for BARE-1. Like BARE-1,
highly repetitive Revolver is transcribed.
A transcriptionally active Revolver gene is well conserved among the Triticeae members. The methylated

Page 8 of 11

and heterochromatic state of most transposons can
cause them to change sequences more rapidly than
genes [43,44]. For example, regulation at any stage of
the replication cycle for retrotransposons (transcription,
translation, reverse transcription, and integration of
cDNA elements) can limit transposition. Furthermore,
the paucity of maize retrotransposon-derived ESTs indicates that some epigenetic mechanisms might have been
repressing the transcription of a large fraction in the
genome [15,45,46]. In contrast to these silenced retrotransposons, Revolver is transcriptionally active (Figure
1) and might have retained transcriptional activity during the long evolution of Triticeae. The predicted protein encoded by Revolver subfamily I includes a c2rf9
motif of a kinase domain and may serve as a transcription factor among this family. The considerable variation
in Revolver copy numbers among T. dicoccoides indicates their propagation activity during the last 10,000
years of T. dicoccoides evolution. The name of the novel
transposon-like gene Revolver means a dynamic factor
in constructing genomes through evolution of the Triticeae, associated with ecological stresses, and presumably
navigated adaptively by natural selection.

Methods
Structural diversities of Revolver mRNA

Revolver cDNAs were obtained from self-fertile rye, and
structural analysis of the cDNA clones was performed.
The primers for amplification of Revolver cDNA were
designed from both ends of a full-length cDNA clone.
Total RNA for RT-PCR extracted from seedlings was
treated with DNase I. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized by AMV reverse transcriptase (Life Science) with
an oligo (dT) primer. Reaction mixtures contained 10
ng of template cDNA, 50 pmoles of each primer (5’GGCACGAGGGTACGAGTCCGAG-3’, 5’-GGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3’), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 ×
LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 U of LA Taq
polymerase (Takara) in a volume of 25 μL. The PCR
reaction program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95°
C, 30 sec at 63°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The RT-PCR products were purified, ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.
Revolver Protein

The Revolver ORF in cDNA subfamily I (pSc5) was
excised by restriction enzyme Sal I and Nco I and integrated into the plasmid vector pET-32a (+) that had
also been digested by Sal I and Nco I. The plasmid was
transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing
pLysS. The cells were grown in 2YT medium containing
carbenicillin and chloramphenicol. The Revolver protein
was induced by 1 mM IPTG, and the culture was grown
at 20°C overnight. Culture at 37°C resulted in

production of an inclusion body. The Revolver protein
fused to thioredoxin and his•tag was purified by nickel
chelating affinity chromatography followed by POROS
CM chromatography. After treatment with Factor Xa
protease, the enzyme was subjected to Superdex 75 gel
filtration. The protein structure encoded by Revolver
was predicted by the Protein Folding Recognition program Robetta (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/).
Expressed sequence tag homologues of a new class of
transposon Revolver

In this study, we searched the publicly disclosed EST database of Triticeae for Revolver homologues using a default
cutoff expectation value of <e-20. Nucleotide sequences
were compared with sequences in the non-redundant
GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ databases with BLASTN homology search software [47]. Sequence alignment was determined with the computer program DNASIS Pro version
2.10 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). A nonrooted phylogenetic
tree was constructed with MEGA version 4.0.2 [48]. The
neighbor-joining method [49] was conducted with
Kimura’s 2-parameter distances [50]
Use of Revolver to generate chromosomal markers

The single primer for amplification of Revolver genomic
DNA was designed from the 3’-flanking region of a typical clone of Revolver (Revolver-2). Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of template genomic DNA, 50 pmoles of
single primer (5’-GTAGTCGTCAGGAGTCCTCACCA3’), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM
MgCl2 , and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) in a
volume of 50 μL. The PCR reaction program consisted of
30 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 3 min at
72°C. The four types of PCR products (2.3 kb, 2.8 kb, 3.3
kb, and 4.3 kb) amplified from the rye genome and rye
chromosome addition wheat genomes were purified,
ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.
Diversity of Revolver in wild Emmer wheat of Israel

In this study, we examined the copy number of Revolver
by slot blot analysis in 161 T. dicoccoides genotypes
representing 18 populations collected from various locations in Israel, which cover a wide range of ecologic
conditions of soil, temperature, altitude, water availability, and abiotic stresses. The collections were from 14
locations in Israel, namely, Mt. Hermon, Yehudiyya,
Gamla, Rosh-Pinna, Tabigha, Mt. Gilboa, Mt. Gerizim,
Gitit, Kokhav-Hashahar, J’aba, Amirim, Bet Oren, Bat
Shelomo, and Giv’at Koah.
Total DNAs isolated from 161 T. dicoccoides genotypes
were blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham).
The nonradioactive chemiluminescence method (Gene
Images, Amersham) was used for probe labeling,

Page 9 of 11

hybridization, and detection of hybridization sites. The
Revolver cDNA subfamily I (pSc5, 694 bp), which was conserved in Triticum species, was used as a probe. The membranes were hybridized at 60°C for 30 min in hybridization
buffer and then hybridized with a labeled probe at 60°C
overnight. The membranes were washed in SSC, 0.1% SDS
at 60°C for 15 min, then in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15
min, followed by incubation for 60 min at room temperature in a 10% (w/v) blocking agent in an antibody wash
buffer. The membrane was then incubated in the presence
of an anti-fluorescein antibody-alkaline phosphatase (AP)
conjugate. The unbound conjugate was removed by three
washes in 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 in an antibody wash buffer
at room temperature. Hybridization sites were detected
with the CDP-star detection reagent. Decomposition of
the stabilized dioxetane was catalyzed by the probe-bound
AP, and exposure of the X-ray film by the emitted light
was then recorded with a fluoro-image analyzer (FUJIFILM FLA-5000). The copy number was calculated on the
basis of the most approximate function, which Image
Gauge software computed from control slot blot hybridization to a series of measured amounts of Revolver cDNA
(0, 10, 100, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 30, 000,
50,000, and 100,000 copies).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Three classes of Revolver mRNA. Revolver cDNAs
obtained by RT-PCR, total lengths of 665 to 723 bp, were classified into
three subfamilies wherein the regions of the second and third exons
were almost identical, while the region of the first exon exhibited a low
homology of 60% among the families because of duplication or deletion.
Repetitive sequence units composed of 8 to 14 bp are present in the
same direction in the first exon as seen on the dot plot. Neighborjoining tree of Revolver cDNA sequences in the Triticeae indicated
alongside species names showed major three clusters according to the
three sub-families; numbers on branches indicate the boot strap values
and homologies.
Additional file 2: Sequence alignment between authentic Revolver
genomic clones from rye IR27 (Revolver-3, 5, 6: AB124641, 124643,
124644) and newly isolated Revolver genomic clones (Revolver-3 on
Chr. 6R, Revolver-5 on Chr. 1R, Revolver-6 on Chr. 5R: AB646252646254) from each rye Imperial chromosome added in wheat. Each
genomic clone localized on the chromosomes exhibits homology of
96~98% between the genomes of IR27 and Imperial.
Additional file 3: Geographic distribution of 18 tested populations
of wild emmer wheat at 15 sites in Israel. Populations 1-6 were
collected from warm, semi-humid environments on the Golan Plateau
and near the Sea of Galilee (Yehudiyya, Gamla, Ammiad, Rosh-Pinna,
Tabigha, and Mt. Hermon). Populations 7-11 were collected across a
wide geographic and marginal steppic area on northern, eastern, and
southern borders of wild emmer distribution involving hot, cold, and
xeric peripheries (Mt. Gilboa, Mt. Gerizim, Gitit, Kokhav-Hashahar, and
J’aba). Populations 12-15 were collected from marginal Mediterranean
areas, which are the humid western borders of wild emmer distribution
(Amirim, Bet Oren, Bat Shelomo, and Giv’at Koah).
