Abstract
Background: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a group of genes with a variety of roles in the innate
and adaptive immune responses. MHC genes form a genetically linked cluster in eutherian mammals, an
organization that is thought to confer functional and evolutionary advantages to the immune system. The tammar
wallaby (Macropus eugenii), an Australian marsupial, provides a unique model for understanding MHC gene
evolution, as many of its antigen presenting genes are not linked to the MHC, but are scattered around the
genome.
Results: Here we describe the ‘core’ tammar wallaby MHC region on chromosome 2q by ordering and sequencing
33 BAC clones, covering over 4.5 MB and containing 129 genes. When compared to the MHC region of the South
American opossum, eutherian mammals and non-mammals, the wallaby MHC has a novel gene organization. The
wallaby has undergone an expansion of MHC class II genes, which are separated into two clusters by the class III
genes. The antigen processing genes have undergone duplication, resulting in two copies of TAP1 and three
copies of TAP2. Notably, Kangaroo Endogenous Retroviral Elements are present within the region and may have
contributed to the genomic instability.
Conclusions: The wallaby MHC has been extensively remodeled since the American and Australian marsupials last
shared a common ancestor. The instability is characterized by the movement of antigen presenting genes away
from the core MHC, most likely via the presence and activity of retroviral elements. We propose that the
movement of class II genes away from the ancestral class II region has allowed this gene family to expand and
diversify in the wallaby. The duplication of TAP genes in the wallaby MHC makes this species a unique model
organism for studying the relationship between MHC gene organization and function.

Background
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a group
of immune genes critical for immune response to pathogens, immunoregulation, anti-tumour responses and
inflammation. Disease resistance and susceptibility associations have been identified between MHC genes and
autoimmune diseases [1], infectious diseases [2] and
parasite load [3]. Although MHC genes have been found
in all jawed vertebrates, the region is dynamic and MHC
genes have been reorganized throughout vertebrate

evolution as species evolve and adapt to new pathogenic
and environmental pressures [4,5].
The MHC of eutherian mammals is a large cluster of
linked genes, broadly divided into three regions, class I,
class II and class III. These regions are named for the
primary type of MHC gene found within them. The
class I and class II MHC genes encode molecules
responsible for antigen presentation. The class I region
contains class I genes, which present endogenous peptides to CD8+ T cells, and also contains a collection of
well conserved genes with varying functions known as
the framework genes, including the members of the
TRIM family of genes, FLOT1, TUBB and NRM [6].
The class II region contains class II genes, which

present exogenous peptides to CD4+ T cells. This
region also contains the antigen processing genes,
including TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing), PSMB/LMP (Large mutli-functional proteasome) genes and non-classical class II genes belonging
to the DM and DO gene families. TAP molecules are
encoded by two genes, TAP1 and TAP2, which are
transmembrane proteins that form a heterodimer within
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where they
transport peptides from the cytosol to the ER to be
coupled to class I molecules [7]. The DM and DO molecules stabilize peptide binding to class II molecules. The
class III genes are so called due to their position
between the class I and class II regions. These genes do
not have a homogenous function, but many have roles
related to the innate immune response (for example
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin a and b,
LTA and LTB) [8].
The human MHC spans 3.6 Mb and includes 264
genes [9], with the MHC of most other eutherians spanning a similar genetic area and gene richness [5]. In
eutherian mammals the three MHC regions are linked,
with the class I and class II regions separated by the
class III region. The organization of MHC genes is also
generally conserved in eutherian mammals, but with
some variations, including the presence of classical class
I genes adjacent to the antigen processing genes in the
rat [10] and the separation of the class II region from
the remainder of the MHC in pigs [11]. Despite these
variations, linkage of MHC genes is thought to provide
functional advantages via co-evolution of genes, generation of diversity and co-ordination of expression and
function [12].
Among non-mammals a diversity of MHC ‘shapes and
sizes’ has been identified. For example, the MHC region
of the chicken (the B locus) is considered to be ‘minimal
essential’ spanning 92 Kb and containing only 19 genes
[13]. In multiple lineages of teleost fish the class I and
class II genes are not linked, and the class III genes are
fragmented across multiple chromosomes [14]. In contrast, the MHC of the amphibian, Xenopus shows some
similarity to the human MHC, with many class III genes
assembled in a similar gene order to the human MHC
[15]. Despite this diversity, a common feature of the
non-mammalian MHC is that the class I genes are
found adjacent to, or interspersed with, the antigen processing genes [16], which generally are found adjacent
to classical and non-classical class II genes. This organization is thought to provide an advantage in that the
antigen presenting and antigen processing genes can
then co-evolve, with little recombination between them
[17]. The tight linkage of the antigen processing and
antigen presenting genes has been retained to varying
degrees in extant mammals and non-mammals [5].

Characterizing the MHC of distant mammals will provide insights into how the MHC evolved in vertebrates.
Marsupials and eutherians last shared a common ancestor approximately 148 million years ago, and since then
their immune systems have been evolving independently
under different pathogenic pressures, making marsupials
ideal for comparative studies of the MHC region. We
previously annotated the MHC of the grey short-tailed
opossum (Monodelphis domestica) [18], the first marsupial to have its genome sequenced and found that the
opossum class I genes were interspersed with the antigen processing genes and class II genes. This organization is similar to that of many non-mammalian species
[15,18]. However, the opossum class III genes and framework genes that flank the eutherian class I genes are
found in a similar order to those in eutherians. The
opossum class II genes fall into four gene families, with
DA, DB and DC gene families thought to be unique to
marsupials [19] and the non-classical DM family shared
with other mammalian and non-mammalian species
[18]. There are 13 putative opossum class I genes. One
of these genes (Modo-UA) likely has a classical function
of antigen presentation as it is ubiquitously expressed
and highly polymorphic. Two class I genes, which are
closely related to Modo-UA, Modo-UB and Modo-UC,
are found outside the MHC [18,20]. Whether these
genes encode molecules with a classical role in antigen
presentation remains unclear, but they are expressed
with unknown levels of polymorphism [18]. Aside from
Modo-UA, six other MHC linked class I genes are transcribed. All six genes appear to be non-classical, lacking
polymorphism and with tissue specific expression, but
their functional roles remain to be determined [21]. The
opossum MHC has one TAP1 gene, two TAP2 (TAP2A
and TAP2B) genes and a PSMB8 and PSMB9 gene, but
it is not known which of these is expressed.
Comparison of the opossum MHC with that of
another marsupial species is important as marsupials are
an evolutionarily diverse group with orders in both
South America and Australia. The tammar wallaby
(Macropus eugenii) is an Australian macropod, which
last shared a common ancestor with the opossum ~80
mya [22], a similar evolutionary distance as human and
mouse. We recently showed that the organization of the
tammar wallaby MHC is unique among vertebrates.
Nine class I genes were found outside the MHC [23].
Seven of these appear to have a classical role in antigen
presentation [24]. The non-classical MHC class I, classical MHC class II and class III genes have been mapped
by FISH to chromosome 2q. Here we present a Bacterial
Artificial Chromosome (BAC) contig and sequence of
the tammar wallaby MHC. We show that the wallaby
class I genes, antigen processing genes and class II
genes have undergone extensive rearrangement when

compared to the opossum and provide insights into the
evolution of the mammalian MHC.

Results
MHC gene organization in the wallaby

In total 4.7 Mb of tammar wallaby MHC sequence containing predictions for 129 putative functional genes has
been generated from chromosome 2q. The BACs assemble into nine contigs plus three orphaned BACs (summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1). The contigs contain
MHC class I, class II and class III genes, as well as
genes from the extended class II region, antigen processing genes and framework genes. The three orphan
BACs do not overlap with any contig, but contain additional class II genes and have been maped to chromosome 2q using FISH. The wallaby MHC genes have
been ordered on chromosome 2q, using gene sequence
and metaphase and interphase FISH (Figure 2).
Contig 1 covers a 711 Kb region and includes the
extended class II region, class II DM a and b genes, a
single class I gene, several antigen processing (TAP1
and TAP2) and proteasome genes (PSMB8 and PSMB9)
(Figure 1). The gene content and order of the extended
class II region from Syngap1 to VPS52 is almost identical between the opossum and the tammar wallaby and
shares high similarity with the extended class II region
of eutherian mammals. A key exception is the region
around the class II DM genes, while there is ~350 Kb
between the DMB and OSCAR genes in the opossum
there is only 180 Kb in the tammar wallaby and as a
result there are fewer genes within this region in the
wallaby (Figure 3). In the opossum, this region contains
five class I genes Modo-UF, -UI, -UG, -UJ (all non-classical class I genes) and Modo-UA (the single classical
class I gene) that are not present within this region in
the wallaby. In the wallaby, only a single non-classical

class I gene (Maeu-UK) remains. The last gene in Contig 1 is an OSCAR (osteoclast-associated receptor) pseudogene. No evidence could be found for the first two
exons of the OSCAR gene and homology (nucleotide
and protein) to the human and mouse OSCAR genes
terminates part way through the final exon. OSCAR is
also found in the MHC of the opossum, adjacent to
TAP2 and Modo-UA, but is found outside the MHC in
eutherians.
Contig 2 covers a 784 kb region and contains class I
and antigen processing genes. It does not overlap Contig
1 but based on interphase FISH results it lies adjacent
(Figure 2). The region covered by Contig 2 represents
the remnants of a class I/II region, with class I genes
interspersed with antigen processing genes. The contig
contains non-classical class I genes (Maeu-UL, MaeuUE, Maeu-UM and Maeu-UP) as well as antigen processing genes TAP1, TAP2, PSMB8 and PSMB9. One putatively functional TAP1 and two putatively functional
TAP2 genes were identified, as well as two TAP1 and
four TAP2 pseudogenes (either gene fragments or with
in-frame stop codons). Two PSMB8 and two PSMB9
genes and multiple PSMB pseudogenes were detected.
In the opossum a class II DBB gene (Modo-DBB1) is
found 50 kb away from Modo-UM. In the wallaby a
class II pseudogene that shares high similarity to
expressed wallaby DBB genes [25] (Figure 3) is found 20
Kb away from Maeu-UM on Contig 2. We have a gap
in our BAC contig in this region, but predict that the
orphan BAC (210A8) containing DBB, DBA and DAA
genes is in the region adjacent to Contig 2, based on
FISH data (Figure 1 and 2) and the fact that this region
in the wallaby appears to have once contained the class
I/II region and the class II DM genes. The presence of
an OSCAR fragment at one end of Contig 2
(BAC_49O16) suggests that this region was once part of
Contig 1, but was rearranged, causing OSCAR to
become a pseudogene in the wallaby.
Contig 3, a minicontig of ~300 kb, contains a class II
DAB processed pseudogene and a cluster of olfactory
receptor genes and has been mapped by FISH to the
region between Contig 2 and Contig 4 (Figure 1 and 2).
The processed pseudogene is intronless, including all
exons (except the signal sequence), an in-frame stop
codon and a putative polyA tail 700 bp downstream of
the stop codon with a possible consensus sequence
(AATTAAA) immediately upstream. Interphase FISH
indicates that the signals for these contigs are indistinguishable and we estimate that the distance between
Contigs 2 and 3 is less than 500 kb.
Contigs 4 and 5 contain 44 class III genes, class II
genes belonging to the DC gene family and a cluster of
butyrophilin (BTN) genes. The gene content and order
of the 44 class III genes is nearly identical to that of the

opossum. Comparison of Contigs 4 and 5 with the opossum class III region suggests that the contigs are separated by ~150 kb and we predict that nine class III
genes found in the opossum fall into this gap in the wallaby MHC. Similarly, Contigs 5 and 6, containing framework genes, are separated by ~250 kb based on
comparison with the homologous opossum region.

Contigs 7, 8 and 9 contain a cluster of class II genes
belonging to the DAB gene family interspersed with
DAB pseudogene fragments. These contigs map (by
FISH) to a region ~1 Mb telomeric of the framework
region (Figure 2), but we could not determine the exact
order of the contigs. The contigs contain 11 unique
class II DAB sequences. However, as the DAB genes

actually hybrids of the two haplotypes present in the
BAC library. The two orphan BACs containing class II
DAB, DBB and DAA genes map (by FISH) to this region
and do not overlap with Contigs 7, 8 or 9.

Wallaby TAP Genes

Within the wallaby MHC class I region there has been
an expansion of the antigen processing genes, TAP1,
TAP2 and PSMB. The TAP1 genes with complete open
reading frames are found on BAC 242G6 (TAP1A-Contig 1) and BAC 6E22 (TAP1B-Contig 2), while the

complete TAP2 genes are found on BAC 242G6
(TAP2A), BAC 7D13 (TAP2C) and BAC 146G20
(TAP2B) (Figure 4 and 5). The TAP genes are interspersed with non-classical class I genes and the DMA
and DMB genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the
TAP2 genes on BAC 242G6 (Contig 1) and 146G20
(Contig 2) cluster together and share 89% amino acid
identity (Figure 5 and 6). TAP2C, located on BAC 7D13
is more divergent, but is more similar to the opossum
TAP2B gene. It shares 76% amino acid identity with the
wallaby TAP2 genes and 79% amino acid identity with
the opossum TAP2B. The TAP1A and TAP1B genes on
BAC 242G6 and 6E22 cluster together and share 87%
amino acid identity with each other and 81% and 77%
identity respectively with opossum TAP1.
The TAP promoters were examined by aligning the
200 base pairs of sequence upstream from the putative
transcriptional start sites with the promoter sequences
from human and opossum TAP genes. The TAP1A and
TAP1B genes share 70% nucleotide identity across this
region, emphasizing the distinctiveness of these genes
from one another. The TAP1A and TAP1B genes share
47 and 50% identity respectively with the same regions
of the human TAP1 gene. A potential ISRE, NF-kB site
and GC sites were identified for both TAP1B and
TAP1A. The TAP2A and TAP2B genes share 80%
nucleotide identity across the promoter region and 5055% identity with the homologous region of TAP2C
(data not shown).
To determine whether all of the TAP1 and TAP2
genes are expressed, primers were designed to amplify
exons 5 and 6 as the sequences of the two paralogs differ in this region (summarized in Table 2 and Figures 4
and 5). Transcripts that share between 97-100% nucleotide identity to TAP1A (BAC 242G6) were detected in
the spleen from one animal and the blood from two
additional animals. Only transcripts sharing 99% nucleotide identity to TAP1B were isolated from a mixed tissue EST library constructed from a fourth animal, but
no TAP1A transcripts were isolated from this library.
This means that expression of TAP1A and TAP1B were
not detected in the same animal or in the same tissue
type (Table 2). In contrast, TAP2A (BAC 242G6) transcripts were found in spleen and blood samples and
both TAP2A and TAP2B were isolated from the EST
library. Transcripts for the TAP2C gene on BAC 7D13
were not identified in any tissues or the EST library.
Rearrangement of the MHC region

A KERV (Kangaroo Endogenous Retrovirus) fragment
was identified next to the non-MHC pseudogenes at
position 569 kb of Contig 2 on BAC93J23. KERV fragments were also identified adjacent to the class III
region and the VAMP4 pseudogene on BAC198J4 and

Page 6 of 15

BAC163H18 and next to the class II DAB cluster on
BAC 178C11 and the DBB genes on BAC 171E14.
The class II antigen presenting genes have duplicated
and form two clusters separated by the class III genes

MHC class II genes are found on nine of the sequenced
BACs (Figure 1) and include at least one DMA, one
DMB, seven DAB, four DBB, one DAA and two DBA
genes. A pseudogene similar in sequence to the opossum DCB gene was identified with in-frame stop codons
in the b1 and b2 domains.
The classical class II genes are found in two regions:
the first lies between the antigen processing genes and
the class III genes, and contains the DBA, DAA and
DBB genes. The second is found at the telomeric end of
the region and contains DAB genes as well as additional
DBB and DBA genes.
There is a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 10 DAB
loci, however, heterozygosity in the individual from
which the BAC library was made and the complexity
and polymorphism of this gene family means the number of DAB loci is difficult to resolve. Five DAB genes
are found on Contig 7. Four are found on Contigs 8 and
9. A further DAB gene is located on BAC 285B7. All of
these DAB genes have complete open reading frames
and contain residues consistent with functional genes.
As many of the DAB sequences are closely related
(share between 83 and 92% nucleotide identity across
the entire coding region of the gene) and are interspersed with pseudogenes and DAB gene fragments it is
difficult to determine if some identified DAB genes are
representative of different haplotypes. For example, we
predict that Contigs 7 and 8 could represent different
haplotypes as 244N6.5 (Contig 7), 243M2.1 (Contig 8),
178C11.2 (Contig 7) and 155M2.3 (Contig 8) are highly
similar DAB genes. Contig 9 is more difficult to place
and may represent additional loci or alleles. This suggests that wallabies have 6-8 DAB loci. Comparison
with known wallaby DAB transcripts indicates that at
least five of these genes are expressed (Figure 7). The
expression of the remaining genes is unknown. Interestingly, a DAB processed pseudogene was found on Contig 3 between the antigen processing genes and the class
III genes. The pseudogene lacks introns, but cluster
with the other DAB genes in a phylogenetic tree (data
not shown).
The DBB, DBA and DAA genes have been physically
mapped to two different locations separated by the class
III region. BAC_171E14 containing two DBB genes and
one DBA gene lies adjacent to the DAB gene cluster
telomeric to the MHC. A second BAC (210A8), containing an additional DBB gene, a DBA gene and a DAA
gene lies between the class I/antigen processing genes
(Contig 2) and the class III region. No intact class II

genes are found on Contig 2. The corresponding region
to Contig 2 in the opossum contains DBB, DBA and
DAA genes located adjacent to the class I genes, ModoUM, Modo-UE and Modo-UL [18]. However, Contig 2
contains a single class II a chain gene fragment with
two adjacent b chain gene fragments (Figure 3), suggesting that the genomic organization in ancestral marsupials was more akin to that seen in present day
opossums.
We predict the wallaby has four DBB genes, one DAA
gene and two DBA genes. The wallaby DBB genes share
high levels of sequence similarity, between 92 and 94%
nucleotide identity across the entire coding region, and
83 and 88% nucleotide identity across the peptide binding region. Phylogentic analysis shows that the DBB
genes form a species specific clade and MaeuDBB1 and
MaeuDBB3 are closely related to previously isolated
DBB cDNA clones (Figure 7) [26].

Discussion
The wallaby MHC has undergone extensive rearrangement since the divergence of the Australian and American marsupials. The classical class I genes have moved
out of the core MHC region on chromosome 2q and
are found at 10 separate chromosomal locations [24].
Remnants of a class I/II region are visible on 2q, but
this region now only contains non-classical class I genes
and duplicated antigen processing genes. The class II

Siddle et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:421
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/421

MHC genes have relocated into two clusters, which are
separated by the class III region and the extended class
I region. This unique MHC organization allows us to
pose questions about the importance of gene clustering
for antigen processing and presentation and explore
how the mammalian MHC evolved.
The classical class I and antigen processing genes are not
linked in the wallaby

Linkage of classical class I and antigen processing genes
within the MHC has been shown to have functional significance in vertebrates. This is most pronounced in
non-mammals [13,15] and the rat [10] where classical
class I and TAP genes are adjacent to one another,
resulting in minimal recombination. Some species with
this type of MHC gene organization, such as the
chicken, have only a single class I gene allowing co-evolution of class I and TAP alleles that can work together
to process and present specific peptides [17]. In chickens, the TAP genes are polymorphic and in the rat
there are multiple lineages of TAP2, resulting in a
necessary co-evolution between class I and TAP alleles
that has direct functional consequences on the peptides
that are processed and presented to T cells by each
MHC haplotype [10,17,27]. In contrast, most eutherian
mammals have multiple classical class I genes that are
separated from the antigen processing genes by the class
III region. It has been proposed that loss of tight linkage
between class I and antigen processing genes may have
facilitated the expansion of the classical class I in mammals [17,28].
We have previously shown that classical class I genes
are not found within the core MHC on wallaby chromosome 2q [24]. We found only non-classical class I genes
in close proximity to antigen processing genes. A single
class I pseudogene, which is most similar to the classical
class I genes outside the MHC (rather than the nonclassical class I on chromosome 2q), was identified
within this region. This implies that the classical class I
genes were once found within the MHC, but subsequently moved away. The movement of classical class I
genes away from the antigen processing genes most
likely had implications for how these genes evolved and
may have facilitated the expansion of both the classical
class I and TAP gene families in the wallaby.
Most vertebrate species have only a single TAP1 and
TAP2 gene, which form a heterodimer on the ER membrane. In mammals the TAP molecules are generally
permissive in the peptides they pump into the ER and it
is the class I molecules that are selective in the peptide
they will bind. The wallaby has multiple TAP1 and
TAP2 genes. It appears that TAP2B (BAC 146G20) and
TAP1B (BAC 6E22) arose via duplication events from
the TAP1A and TAP2A genes on 242G6 (Figure 6). The

Page 10 of 15

TAP2C gene on BAC 7D13 is orthologous to opossum
TAP2B and may have been present in the marsupial
ancestor. However, we found no evidence that TAP2C
is transcribed. We found evidence that both TAP1A and
TAP1B are transcribed, but we did not find these genes
expressed in the same animal or the same tissue type.
This may mean that these genes are differentially
expressed in different individuals or different tissue
types. In contrast, there is evidence that both TAP2A
and TAP2B transcripts are expressed in a single individual, but in different tissue types. As a whole this data
indicates that diversity is generated among functional
wallaby TAP molecules. How the TAP genes are coordinated in the wallaby cannot yet be determined. We have
considered two possibilities. First, the TAP1 and TAP2
genes may co-ordinate in a random manner. This is
supported by the finding of multiple TAP2 transcripts
in the same individual. This type of interaction may
allow a wider range of peptides to be pumped into the
ER and in turn be presented by class I. Second, the TAP
genes may interact in a specific manner, and may pump
peptides for binding to specific class I genes or only in
certain tissues, increasing the specificity of peptides
pumped into the ER. This hypothesis seems more likely
as the TAP2A and TAP2B genes are expressed in distinct tissues in the same individual. The system utilized
by the wallaby may represent a new way for TAP genes
to provide specificity or promiscuity in the peptides provided to class I molecules.
Genomic organization of class II

In some non-mammals, class II genes are located in a
single cluster next to the class I genes. Similarly, the
opossum, which last shared a common ancestor with
the wallaby ~80 mya contains a class I/II region [18]
and in the platypus, which last shared a common ancestor with the marsupials and placental mammals ~160
mya [29], the classical class II genes are adjacent to
class I and antigen processing genes [30]. In the wallaby
the class II genes have undergone rearrangement and
the classical class II genes are divided into two regions.
The first class II region, containing DBB, DBA, DAA
genes and DAB pseudogenes, is adjacent to the antigen
processing genes. We propose that this was the class II
region in the common marsupial ancestor. A second
class II region is located towards the telomeric end of
the chromosome. This cluster contains the DAB genes,
two DBB genes and a DBA gene.
Class II copy number

The class II genes have undergone large scale expansion
and rearrangement since the divergence of the American
and Australian marsupials. The tammar wallaby is the
only marsupial species for which the number of DAB

genes has been determined using large scale sequencing,
as the DAB genes were not sequenced in the opossum
genome, and only a single gene has been characterized
at the cDNA level [31]. Nevertheless, it is still difficult
to determine the exact number of genes present in the
wallaby genome due to the presence of two haplotypes
in the individual from which the BAC library was made
and the close sequence identity between the DAB genes.
We predict that the wallaby has at least seven DAB
genes. Four DAB genes have been identified in Gracilinanus microtarsus and two DAB genes were identified
in Marmosops incanus, two species of Brazilian mouse
opossum [32]. Among the Australian marsupial species
the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) [33] has at
least five DAB genes, while the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) has at least three DAB genes [34].
Only a single DAA gene was identified 1 Mb away
from the cluster of DAB genes and two DBA genes
were identified. Similarly, there is evidence for a single
DAA gene and multiple DBA genes in the brushtail possum [33]. The wallaby has at least three DBB genes [35],
whereas there are only two in the opossum. It has been
predicted that the brushtail possum has at least two
DBB genes and DBB transcripts have also been isolated
from the red-necked wallaby [33,36].

single monomorphic class II a gene is separated by at
least 50 kb from the polymorphic b gene, with the proposal that this genetic separation has allowed the b
chain to be highly polymorphic and forced the a chain
to become monomorphic and a best fit to the b chain
[38]. In the wallaby the single DAA gene is separated
from the DAB family of genes by at least 1 Mb and the
gene dense class III region. Here we present evidence
that the DAB gene family has multiple expressed genes.
We speculate that the DAA locus in the wallaby will be
non-polymorphic, so that it can form functional dimers
with the highly variable DAB family. In contrast, there
are tightly linked DBA and DBB genes in both of the
wallaby class II regions, suggesting that these genes can
more easily co-evolve to generate functional dimers.
This is supported by evidence of polymorphism at DBB
genes in both the wallaby [25] and in DBB and DBA
genes in the brushtail possum [33]. However, further
data on polymorphism in wallaby class II genes is
needed. The movement of DAB genes away from the
DAA gene may have allowed the DAB gene family to
expand rapidly and is perhaps reminiscent of the class I
genes in the wallaby, which we predict moved away
from the antigen processing genes and then expanded
to create multiple classical class I.

Class II heterodimers

Kangaroo endogenous retrovirus and gene
rearrangements

Based on the organization of the class II genes in the
wallaby we predict that the DAB and DAA genes form
heterodimers, while the DBB and DBA genes most likely
form heterodimers. Holland and colleagues (2008)
recently proposed that in brushtail possums, highly variable DAB genes form heterodimers with the almost
monomorphic DAA genes and the somewhat polymorphic DBB genes form heterodimers with the DBA
genes [33]. This is reminiscent of the relationship
between the DR a and b gene pairs in eutherian mammals, where one member of the partnership is highly
polymorphic, while the other is not. It has been proposed that the genetic distance between a and b chain
genes and the amount of recombination defines the
level of polymorphism of a class II gene [37]. Where
there is a sufficient amount of recombination between a
and b genes one member of the partnership (usually the
a gene) must remain monomorphic so that it can form
a complex with any number of b gene alleles. Conversely, where there is little recombination between the
genes, alleles may co-evolve and there is no reason for
the a gene to remain monomorphic. For instance, it has
been proposed that frequent recombination within the
mouse class II region between H2-Ea and H2-Eb genes,
results in a highly polymorphic H2-Eb and nearly
monomorphic H2-Ea, which can form a complex with
any of the b chain genes [37]. Similarly, in chickens a

Kangaroo endogenous retrovirus (KERV) was originally
discovered due to its role in macropod chromosome
rearrangement and evolution [39]. We previously identified KERV fragments adjacent to class I genes that have
moved away from the core MHC and speculated that
these elements played a role in the movement of class I
genes, as has previously been identified in eutherian
mammals [23,24,40]. Here we identified KERV fragments within the rearranged class I/II region and adjacent to NOTCH4 in the class III region, implying that
retroviruses have played a key role in the evolution of
the wallaby MHC. We have also identified a class II
DAB pseudogene that lacks introns, but is otherwise
intact and with a putative PolyA tail, adjacent to the
rearranged class I/II region. Retroviral activity may have
played a role in the evolution of the wallaby MHC, by
moving DAB genes away from their DAA counterpart,
resulting in the expansion of the DAB gene family and
leaving traces of their activity in intronless class II
pseudogenes.
In a broader context, analysis of retroposon insertions
within the South American and Australian marsupial
orders has shown that the Australian marsupials derived
from a single common ancestor, indicating a single marsupial migration from South America to Australia [41].
Most interestingly, the analysis also implies a high

Siddle et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:421
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/421

degree of retroposon activity in the lineage leading to
the modern Australian marsupial orders. It is possible
that the derived nature of the wallaby MHC (in comparison to the opossum) is in part due to the activity of
these retroposons in the common ancestor of the Australian marsupials. From this interpretation it follows
that the divergent organization of the wallaby MHC,
including the unique organization of the class I and
class II genes, may be common to the Australian marsupial species.

Conclusions
The wallaby MHC has undergone extensive rearrangement since this species shared a common ancestor with
the South American marsupials. Although the remnants
of a class I/II region, seen in the opossum and nonmammals, are visible in the wallaby there are no classical class I genes within the MHC. This is remarkable for
a mammalian MHC and may have affected the number
of antigen processing genes and their expression, resulting in multiple combinations of TAP heterodimers. The
movement of class I and class II genes may have facilitated the generation of diversity within these gene
families. The wallaby class II genes are found in two
regions separated by the class III genes and this most
likely triggered the expansion of the highly polymorphic
class II DAB family of genes. Analysis of the wallaby
MHC has provided insights into the evolution of this
gene family in marsupials and shed light on factors that
have influenced the evolution of the MHC in this
branch of mammals.

Overgo probes were radio labeled with 32P-dATP and
P-dCTP (GE Healthcare) and used to screen a 11 ×
tammar wallaby BAC library (Me_KBa, Arizona Genomics Institute, USA) using the BACPAC hybridization
protocol (available at: http://bacpac.chori.org/overgohyb.
htm). The following modifications to the protocol were
made; overgo probes were pooled in groups of ten and
used to screen six filters at once. Following hybridization and washing, the filters were exposed to Hyperfilm
(GE Healthcare) using intensifying screens for up to
fourteen days at -80°C.

Secondary Screening of MHC associated BAC clones

Secondary screening of positive BAC clones was used to
determine BACs positive for individual MHC genes and
to remove false positive clones. BAC clones were cultured overnight and 1 ul of culture was applied to
gridded Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare). The
membranes were placed on LB/agar plates with chloramphenicol (12 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C overnight.
The membranes were removed from the plate and placed
on blotting paper moistened with a denaturing solution
for 7 min, followed by blotting paper moistened with a
neutralizing solution for 7 min. The membranes were
rinsed in 2 × SSC and baked for 2 hours at 80°C. Ten
overgo probes (Additional File 1, Table S1) were radiolabeled as described above and used to screen these membranes at 60°C overnight. Membranes were washed
according to the BACPAC hybridization protocol and
membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare)
using intensifying screens overnight at -80°C.

Methods

Physical Mapping of BACs

Selection of MHC-associated BAC clones

Many MHC class I genes of the tammar wallaby are
known to be located outside the MHC. Thus, BACs
known to contain class II MHC genes were physically
mapped using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
according to Deakin et al. (2007) [23]. Dual-colour
fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to
determine the location of orphaned BACs or BAC contigs. BACs were labeled by nick translation with either
SpectrumOrange or SpectrumGreen (Vysis), hybridised
to male tammar wallaby metaphase chromosome
spreads and imaged as described in Deakin et al (2008).

Forty-nine overgo probes were designed based on
annotated opossum MHC genes (Additional File 1,
Table S1), which were extracted from the opossum
MHC genome browser (available at: http://bioinf.wehi.
edu.au/cgi-bin/gbrowse/opossum_mhc/). These MHC
genes were used to search against the tammar wallaby
genome trace archive (2 × coverage deposited on the
NCBI database) using a discontinuous BLAST (Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool) for cross species
searches. Significant matches from the wallaby trace
archive were searched against the Genbank database to
confirm the identity of the sequence. Overgos were
designed for each tammar trace sequence using OvergoMaker [42]. All overgos were 24 base pairs in length,
with an overlap of eight base pairs and a GC content
of 45-55%. After a preliminary contig was built (see
below for methods) ten BACs were selected for BAC
end sequencing (T7 and Sp6 primers). Thirty additional overgos were designed from this sequence (Additional File 1, Table S1).

Interphase nuclei preparations

A male tammar wallaby fibroblast culture was grown to
confluency and held without medium change for 3 days
to enrich for G1 interphase cells. Cells were harvested
by trypsinisation, washed twice in PBS, swollen in 75
mM KCl at 37°C for 15 min, fixed in 3:1 methanol:
acetic acid and dropped onto glass slides. Three separate
experiments were performed on interphase nuclei for
each orphaned BAC. BAC 310P15 representing the

Siddle et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:421

framework region/Class III contig and 288B16 representing the extended region were directly labelled by
nick translation with SpectrumGreen (Vysis) and the
orphaned BAC was labelled with SpectrumOrange
(Vysis). In experiment one all three BACs hybridised to
nuclei in the same experiment elucidated whether
orphaned BACs were within the MHC spanning from
the Class III region to the extended Class I/II region.
Two further experiments were carried out with either
BAC 310P15 or 288B16 labelled with SpectrumGreen
and the orphaned BAC labelled with SpectrumOrange
allowed the orientation of the orphaned BAC in relation
to the flanking region BACs to be ascertained. Hybridisation of labelled probes to interphase nuclei was carried
out following the FISH hybridisation protocol described
in Deakin et al (2008). A total of 50 nuclei were imaged
for each interphase experiment.
BAC contig assembly

All BAC clones were assembled into contigs using BAC
fingerprinting as described by Marra et al (1997) [43]
and Humphrays et al. (2001) [44] followed by contig
analysis using FPC (v6.5) [45]. Known MHC markers on
the BACs identified by secondary screening were used
to assess the validity of any contig merges. BACs constituting a minimum tiling path were then selected for
sequencing. We used the opossum MHC as a guide to
ordering the contigs, but with some caution, as we have
previously shown the organisation of the wallaby class I
genes is very different to that of the opossum [24].
Sequencing of overlapping BACs

Sequencing of BACs occurred at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute as previously described [46]. The BACs
for which sequencing and annotation have been completed have been submitted to Genbank under the following accession numbers. MEKBa_288B16 [CU463226];

MEKBa_155M2 [CU463961]. A previously sequenced
BAC (VIA_6605) containing class III genes was also
included in the contig [47]. The full annotation and
sequence for each BAC can be found at http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Macropus_eugenii/Info/Index.
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis

The overlapping regions of fully sequenced BACs were
determined using Sequencher 4.1.4 (GeneCodes) with
10% minimum overlap and 80% minimum nucleotide
identity. The overlapping regions were then checked
manually for mismatches. The predicted, full length
coding sequences of the MHC class II a chains and b
chain and TAP genes were aligned with the sequences
from the NCBI database listed below using ClustalW, in
the Bioedit program [48]. Neighbour joining trees were
constructed with the b2 domain of the class II genes
and the full amino acid coding sequence of the TAP
genes using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix and 1000
bootstraps in the Mega 4.0 software [49].
TAP sequences used for phylogenetic analysis were as
follows: Opossum: ModoTAP2A, ModoTAP2B and
ModoTAP1 can be found at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/
opossum/seq/Class_II.fa; Human: HosaTAP2-[M74447],

Analysis of TAP1 and TAP2 expression

Primers were designed to amplify exons 5 and 6 of the
wallaby TAP1A, TAP1B, TAP2A, TAP2B and TAP2C
genes (TAP1F-CTGTGGAGGCACTTTCTGC, TAP1R-.

CAAGGC). The primers were designed to regions where
the multiple TAP1 and TAP2 genes are identical, but
across a region that would allow different genes to be
identified. TAP1 and TAP2 fragments were amplified
from a spleen sample and blood samples (n = 3) with
the following reaction: 1 × Buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm
dNTP, 2 μm of each primer and 0.3ul of High fidelity
taq polymerase (Expand taq, Roche). Cycling conditions
were as follows: Initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 3 min,
followed by 29 cycles of 94.0°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. A 250 base pair fragment was amplified and cloned
into a commercial vector (Clonejet, Fermentas). Twelve
clones were selected from each spleen or blood sample
and sequenced using a M13F and M13R primers. A 5’
and 3’ EST database constructed from mixed tissue of a
single wallaby (including spleen and lymph node) was
blasted using full length TAP1A, TAP1B, TAP2A, 2B
and 2C sequences. Access to the library was kindly provided by Marilyn Renfree at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Kangaroo Genomics.
