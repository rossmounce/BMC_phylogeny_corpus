Abstract
Background: Flavonoids, one of the major groups of secondary metabolites, play important roles
in the physiology, ecology and defence of plants. Their wide range of activities is the result of their
structural diversity that encompasses a variety of functional group substitutions including
hydroxylations. The aromatic hydroxylation at position 6 of flavonols is of particular interest, since
it is catalyzed by a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (ODD), rather than a cytochrome P450dependent monooxygenase. ODDs catalyze a variety of enzymatic reactions implicated in
secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
Results: A cDNA fragment encoding an ODD involved in the 6-hydroxylation of partially
methylated flavonols, flavonol 6-hydroxylase (F6H), was isolated and characterized from
Chrysosplenium americanum using internal peptide sequence information obtained from the native
plant protein. This novel clone was functionally expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
expression systems and exhibited ODD activity. The cofactor and cosubstrate requirements of the
recombinant proteins are typical for ODDs, and the recombinant enzymes utilize 3,7,4'trimethylquercetin as the preferred substrate. The genomic region encoding this enzyme possesses
two introns at conserved locations for this class of enzymes and is present as a single copy in the
C. americanum genome.
Conclusions: Recombinant F6H has been functionally expressed and characterized at the
molecular level. The results demonstrate that its cofactor dependence, physicochemical
characteristics and substrate preference compare well with the native enzyme. The N-terminal
region of this protein is believed to play a significant role in catalysis and may explain the difference
in the position specificity of the 6-hydroxylation reaction.

Background
Flavonoid compounds constitute one of the major groups
of secondary metabolites and play important roles in
plant development, reproduction and defence. This

diverse spectrum of activities results from their structural
diversity and a variety of functional group substitutions
[1]. Chrysosplenium americanum (Saxifragaceae), a semiaquatic weed, accumulates a variety of tetra- and penta
methylated flavonol glucosides substituted at various

Proposed pathway for polymethylated flavonol biosynthesis in C. americanum

Proposed pathway for polymethylated flavonol biosynthesis in C. americanum
positions of the flavonol ring [2]. Their biosynthesis from
the parent aglycone, quercetin, is catalyzed by a number
of stepwise, substrate-specific, position-oriented O-methyltransferases and two distinct O-glucosyltransferases in a
highly ordained sequence (Figure 1) [2]. During the
course of their biosynthesis, the partially methylated
intermediate, 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetin (TMQ) is hydroxylated at position 6 to 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetagetin
(TMQg) by a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase
(ODD), flavonol 6-hydroxylase [3].
Plant ODDs (EC 1.14.11.-) constitute a class of nonheme, iron-containing cytosolic enzymes that utilize an
oxoacid as a cosubstrate and a reducing agent for the reactive iron moiety, typically ascorbate. This widespread class
of enzymes has been implicated in a variety of plant metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis of some
amino acids, hormones, signalling molecules and a variety of secondary metabolites [4]. Hydroxylation at position 6 of partially methylated flavonols is of particular
interest, since it is catalyzed by a 2-oxoglutarate-depend-

ent dioxygenase rather than a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase.
Using the peptide sequence information obtained from
the purified plant protein [3], degenerate primers were
designed for the screening a C. americanum cDNA library
and the isolation of a F6H clone. The identity of this clone
was confirmed after identifying internal peptide
sequences in the translated amino acid sequence of the
isolated cDNA clone, as well as by functional expression
of F6H in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The
molecular characterization of this gene, with respect to its
genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship to
other ODDs involved in plant secondary metabolism,
contributes to the growing pool of information on this
class of enzymes.

known flavonoid ODDs such as the flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) [5], flavonol synthase (FLS) [6] and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) [7]. Two other peptide sequences,
Micro2 – KIVEACEDWG and Micro3 – TLMAGLACKLLGVL, exhibited limited homology to this class of
enzymes. Of the different approaches used, two methods
allowed the isolation of putatively positive cDNA fragments from a C. americanum bacteriophage expression
library [8]. The PCR-based strategy utilized several primer
combinations and resulted in the isolation of a fragment
termed, F6H·1, that exhibited a significant degree of
homology to flavonoid ODD genes. In addition, a portion of the deduced amino acid sequence of F6H·1
matched another fragment obtained from microsequencing. Subsequently, the PCR-based screening approach
resulted in the amplification of a 1,245 bp-long cDNA
fragment, termed cF6H, that contained the 3'-end of this
putative cDNA clone, including an in-frame stop codon
(TAA), a putative polyadenylation signal (ATATAA) and a
short polyA tail (Accession # AY605048), although it
lacked the translation start site. The same cDNA library
was also screened with an oligonucleotide probe derived
from the F6H·1 sequence. Putatively positive clones were
isolated and characterized, but none yielded a full-length
F6H cDNA clone, although several clones were isolated
with homology to related sequences, particularly F3H and
aminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase (ACCO). Further
attempts to isolate a complete F6H ORF were unsuccessful, including the use of inverse PCR and the GenomeWalker technique (ClonTech).
The truncated DNA fragment, cF6H, translates into a 376
amino acid-long sequence with a predicted molecular
mass of 40.9 kDa and a pI of 5.1. The fact that the native
protein exhibits a molecular mass of 43 to 45 kDa following gel filtration or SDS-PAGE analysis respectively [3],
suggests that the cDNA fragment lacks ~10 to 15 N-termi-

nal amino acid residues. However, the conserved regions
and catalytically important residues located in the C-terminal of ODDs [9] are present in the translated cF6H
sequence. The amino acid residues involved in iron
(His222, His285, Asp224) and α-KG-binding (Arg295,
Ser297), as well as other conserved residues are present
within the cF6H sequence (Figure 2). The near-full length
cF6H, although truncated at the N-terminal, was confirmed to be an authentic fragment of the gene encoding
the F6H, since the internal peptide sequences obtained
from the native protein were present in the deduced
amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone (Figure 2).
Sequence analyses of ODD genes including cF6H demonstrate that the conserved regions and catalytically important amino acids are located primarily within the Cterminal half of these proteins, whereas the less conserved
N-terminal region may be involved in substrate binding
or maintaining the protein's tertiary conformation. Given
the inherent variability of the N-terminal, that in certain
cases it does not contribute significantly to ODD enzyme
activity as was the case with the desacetoxyvindoline 4hydroxylase of Catharanthus roseus [10], and that all possibilities for the isolation of the remaining fragment were
exhausted, the cF6H fragment was cloned into prokaryotic
and eukaryotic expression vectors to assess its enzyme
activity.
Expression of recombinant F6H
The induction and solubility of the bacterial expressed
F6H (rF6Hb) fusion protein were assessed over a 4-h
period and recombinant F6H enzyme activity was
assayed. The level of expression of the fusion protein was
monitored by Western bolt analysis of cell lysates using
anti-(His)6 antibodies. The antibody reacted with a 45
kDa protein band in cell lysates carrying the pTrc-HiscF6H construct after induction (Figure 3). This corresponds to the correct mass of the recombinant protein

since the (His)6-tag and extraneous amino acids resulting
from the cloning process account for an additional ~3.5
kDa in the fusion construct. The Ni-NTA-purified recombinant protein (Figure 3) exhibited a F6H activity of 0.103
pkat/mg following size exclusion chromatography (Table
1). The level of enzyme activity did not vary significantly
regardless of the time or temperature of induction.
In order to test for any inhibitory effect resulting from the
(His)6-tag, the fusion protein was cleaved by incubation
with enterokinase (EK). The enzyme activity of the cleaved
protein was significantly reduced compared to the NiNTA-purified rF6Hb (Table 1). The loss of activity was
attributed to destabilization of the protein resulting from
dialysis to remove inhibitors of the EK reaction, followed
by incubation at room temperature with EK. Control
experiments indicated that the (His)6-tag did not stimulate overall recombinant enzyme activity, since the intact
rF6Hb treated in parallel with the preparation undergoing
cleavage exhibited a similar reduction in enzyme activity.

The translated cF6H sequence possesses two potential glycosylation sites at Ser139 and Ser305 that may contribute
to catalytic activity, perhaps by stabilizing a favorable tertiary conformation or through the modulation of interactions with other proteins. The effects of such posttranslational modifications and protein folding were
taken into account by expression of the recombinant protein in the eukaryotic expression system Pichia pastoris.
This system is relatively easy to manipulate and exhibits
many of the advantages of eukaryotic expression, including protein processing, folding and modification. Recombinant protein expression was both intracellular (rF6Hy)
and secreted (rF6Hys). The chosen culture media (BMGY/
BMMY) contained protein stabilizing factors, such as peptone and yeast extract, shown to reduce proteolysis, particularly of secreted proteins [11]. Protein expression,
monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-(His)6 antibodies, was maximal at 3 to 4 days post-induction in both
intracellular and secreted systems (Figure 4), and the protein eluted at a volume corresponding to ~40 kDa from a
Superose 12 column. The Ni-affinity-purified prepara-

tions exhibited a specific activity of 0.21 and 0.11 pkat/mg
for the intracellular (rF6Hy) and the secreted (rF6Hys)
constructs, respectively. Their specific activities could not
be further improved by size exclusion chromatography
instead of or in addition to, Ni-NTA purification (Table
1).
In both prokaryote and eukaryote expression systems
rF6H was soluble, exhibited similar physicochemical
properties to the native protein and was no more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Interestingly, as with the
native plant protein [3], the recombinant F6H was functional as a monomer, but was also shown by gel filtration
to associate in vitro (Figure 3C). In the case of the native
F6H, this may result from the disruption during isolation
of any weak interactions with other proteins, particularly
those involved in polymethylated flavonol biosynthesis.
A hydrophobic prediction plot of the translated cF6H
(data not shown) indicates the presence of a nonpolar
region at the very end of the protein sequence, which may
participate in dimerization or aggregation processes.
The substrate specificity of recombinant F6H was tested
using the Ni-NTA-purified enzyme with different flavonol
substrates (Table 2). The results indicate that, although
the overall specific activity of both recombinant proteins
is reduced as compared to the native protein, 3,7,4'-TMQ
is the preferred substrate for both rF6Hb and rF6Hy,
which accepted neither quercetin nor 3-methylquercetin
to any significant extent. On the other hand, 3,7-dimeth-

ylquercetin was accepted at 56% and 63% of the control
activity by rF6Hb and rF6Hy, respectively.
Given the fact that neither of the recombinant proteins
utilized naringenin as a substrate, it seems unlikely that
F6H catalyzes a side reaction of F3H or a bifunctional
activity as F3H-FLS, as has been demonstrated with the
Citrus unshiu bifunctional dioxygenase [12]. Therefore,
this enzyme may putatively be classified as a narrow-specificity ODD [12]. Taken together, these results suggest
that Chrysosplenium F6H exhibits a specificity for partially
methylated flavonoids involved in polymethylated flavonol biosynthesis characteristic of the species.
The cofactor requirements for the bacterially expressed
recombinant protein were similar to those of the native
plant protein [3]. Ferrous ions had the greatest effect on
enzyme activity and enzyme reactivation in affinity-purified samples, as demonstrated by abolition of enzyme
activity upon incubation with 5 mM EDTA. A preliminary
assessment of the apparent Km values of rF6Hb for the flavonol substrate (63 µM) suggests that the binding affinity
has been reduced 17-fold compared to the native protein
(0.27 µM) [3]. In contrast, that for α-KG was only slightly
affected (78 µM instead of 60 µM), indicating that the
binding site for the cosubstrate has not been substantially
altered. Nevertheless, a detailed kinetic analysis of the
recombinant protein was not conducted given the truncation of the N-terminal and reduced enzyme activity.
The hydroxylation of an aromatic carbon may be the
result of substrate positioning in relation to the oxidizing
moiety within the active site. Mehn and colleagues [13] in
attempting to elucidate the role of the cosubstrate in oxygen activation by ODDs through the use of synthetic iron
complexes have also demonstrated the hydroxylation of
phenolic substrates. In addition, the nature of the substituents on the phenolic moiety, dramatically affects the
reaction rate. These results suggest that the structure of the
substrate and its positioning within the active site play a
crucial role in aromatic hydroxylations by ODDs as
opposed to more fundamental differences in reaction
mechanisms. This may explain the importance of the Nterminal to F6H enzyme activity, particularly if it is
involved in substrate binding either by directly contributing to the flavonol binding site, or by maintaining the
appropriate conformation for substrate recognition. This
hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that rF6H exhibited a
reduced specific activity in comparison to the native F6H,
regardless of the expression system, degree of purification
or the location of the polyhistidine tag.

amplification reactions with primers designed to the outermost regions of the cF6H sequence. This produced a
fragment of ~3.1 kbp (gF6H) that contained two potential
intronic sequences (Figure 5). The first intron, 421 bp
long is centrally located at position 684 of cF6H, whereas
the second intron is significantly longer, 964 bp and is
located towards the 3'-end of the gene at position 943.
Southern analysis of genomic DNA, probed with the cF6H
partial ORF, gave rise to single bands in BamHI- and
EcoRI-digested genomic DNA (Figure 6). The internal
sequence of gF6H does not contain any recognition sites
for the above enzymes; however, one recognition site is
located within the known sequence for KpnI, NcoI, XhoI.
Two major bands were detected in these lanes at estimated
sizes ranging from ~4.3 to 10.0 kbp. These results indicate
that F6H is present as a single copy gene in C. americanum,
particularly since potential tandem F6H repeats would
have resulted in the observation of fragments larger than
6.2 kbp, which were not present in lane 1. Under conditions of reduced stringency, certain lanes exhibited more
than the two expected bands (data not shown), indicating
the existence of related sequences within the genome.
The ORFs of the clones isolated using different
approaches were identical in sequence, indicating that
they represent the same protein. This is in agreement with
the results obtained from Southern analysis suggesting
that F6H is present as a single copy in the C. americanum
genome. The deduced amino acid sequence of cF6H

exhibits homology to other ODDs, particularly at the Cterminal, and this conservation can be extended to the
organization of the gene as a whole. The fact that gF6H
possesses two introns at conserved locations for ODDs
[14], suggests that ODD sequences arose through divergence from a common ancestor. The single copy nature of
this enzyme also suggest a regulatory role in polymethylated flavonol biosynthesis and may be significant, in relation to a second hydroxylation that occurs at the 2'position of the TMQ intermediate (Figure 1). A comparable reaction was recently reported to be catalyzed by a
cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase involving
the 2'-hydroxylation of isoflavones in Medicago truncatula
[15]. It has been proposed that the cytosolic enzymes
involved in the sequential methylation of Chrysosplenium flavonoids are organized on the surface of a multienzyme aggregate, thus allowing for a more efficient
regulation of the pathway as a whole [16]. It is likely that
the F6H is a component of this enzyme complement, as it
introduces a hydroxyl group at position 6 of 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetin for subsequent O-methylation at this
position by a flavonol 6-O-methyltransferase (F6OMT).
Immunolocalization of both enzymes, F6H and F6OMT,
should provide further evidence in support of this view.
cF6H from C. americanum exhibits highest similarity, at
the amino acid level, to various F3H homologs. Phylogenetically, it is evident that homologous genes encoding
biochemically related proteins in single pathways are clustered into related subgroups (Figure 7), perhaps as a result

Page 7 of 12

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4:20

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/20

At the phylogenetic level, ODDs comprise a superfamily
with numerous subgroups whose subsets are defined by
shared motifs in the encoded proteins, such as those
involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. These motifs often
comprise the active site of the enzyme and/or the binding
domains for substrates and cofactors. In addition, the
degree of similarity between genes encoding dioxygenases
with different substrate preferences suggests a common
reaction mechanism. The molecular characterization of
F6H and related ODDs could identify potential commonalities in structure or reaction mechanisms, as well as
reveal motifs or residues that may determine reaction type
and/or substrate preference. When aligned with related
sequences, cF6H exhibits a high degree of conservation of
the motifs required for iron and cosubstrate binding,
whereas other regions show little or no identity and are
presumed, most likely, to contribute to differences in substrate specificity and/or reaction type. This applies particularly to the variable N-terminal and a region where a gap
insertion within an ODD sequence motif is required for
proper alignment with other flavonoid biosynthetic
enzymes. Further evidence of such distinctness is the fact
that, although F6H clusters with the F3H group of flavonoid dioxygenases (Figure 7), it appears to have evolved
paraphyletically from a common ancestor with respect to
this group of genes.

of gene duplication and divergence. Genes encoding proteins in the same pathway of a given species, although not
within the same subgroup, exhibit expectedly higher identity than unrelated genes. cF6H clusters with the F3H
group of genes, although at a position distal to those
homologs from other species, thus suggesting an evolutionary relationship with this particular subgroup of biosynthetically related enzymes. It is evident from Figure 7
that flavonol ODDs cluster into 2 distinct clades; the first
consisting of enzymes with a narrow substrate specificity
including F3H, FSI and F6H, whereas the second is comprised of FLS and ANS, both possessing broad substrate
specificity as has been previously described [12,17,18]. It
seems that based on biochemical and phylogenetic considerations, Chrysosplenium F6H exhibits high substrate
and position specificity.

Conclusions
A novel ODD cDNA involved in the 6-hydroxylation of
partially methylated flavonols was isolated and characterized from C. americanum. The substrate specificity
observed with the recombinant F6H compares well with
the native enzyme [3]; displaying a specificity for position
6 of partially methylated flavonols, with 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetin being the preferred substrate. The fact that it
hydroxylates position 6 of the aromatic ring A of a
partially methylated flavonol contrasts with other aromatic hydroxylations which are commonly catalyzed by
cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, such as the flavonol
8-hydroxylase of Tagetes patula [19] and the flavonoid 6hydroxylase of soybean involved in isoflavone biosynthesis [20]. Given that both the native and recombinant F6H
exhibit a preference for relatively hydrophobic substrates
further distinguishes this protein from other dioxygenases
characterized to date, that are known to accept relatively
polar flavonoid aglycones [21-24]. Further evidence of
such distinctness is the fact that, although cF6H clusters
with the F3H group of flavonoid dioxygenases (Figure 7),
it appears to have evolved in a paraphyletic fashion with
respect to this group of genes. General flavonoid biosynthesis may have arisen from a multifunctional dioxygenase, since F3H and F6H seem to share a common ancestor,
but significant divergence has since occurred resulting in
the evolution of this novel activity.

A clone with full enzyme activity, which can be isolated
based on the cF6H sequence provided fresh tissue is
available, can be used to assess the versatility of this
enzyme with respect to substrate preference through sitedirected mutagenesis, as well as to assess its potential
applications in metabolic engineering.

Methods
Materials
Chrysosplenium americanum (Schwein x Hooker; Saxifragaceae), was collected from St. Anicet, Québec, and was
maintained in the greenhouse under conditions simulating its natural habitat regarding light intensity, temperature and humidity.

Flavonol substrates were from our laboratory collection.
All other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade. Buffers: Assay buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10 mM DTT,
150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v); Wash solution I, 2 ×
SSC, 0.1% SDS (w/v); Wash solution II, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1%
SDS (w/v); Blocking solution, 5% SDS (w/v), 125 mM
NaCl, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2); Blot washing
solution, 0.5% SDS (w/v), 12.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.2). FPLC buffers were filtered,
degassed and stored at 4°C.
Isolation of an F6H clone
The ligand-affinity purified F6H protein [3] was subjected
to digestion and sequencing at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility using microcapillary, reverse-phase HPLC
nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The MS/MS spectra obtained were correlated with
known sequences using the Sequest algorithm developed
at the University of Washington [25,26].

A C. americanum cDNA Lambda UniZap XR library was
screened by PCR as described in [27] with 5 µL of the
cDNA library (representing 1 × 106 pfu) per reaction. The
following degenerate oligonucleotide primers were
derived from two internal peptide sequences obtained
from the native protein, Micro1 and Micro2;
Micro1For-5'-GCTGGATCCTCCTTCATATA-3';
Micro1Rev-5'(GC)GATAC(AT)GG(TC)AA(TC)(CG)TTAG(ATGG(CT)T

Primer combinations: i) Micro1Rev and Micro2For; ii)
Micro1For and T3; iii) Micro1Rev and T7; iv) Micro2For
and T3; v) Micro2Rev and T7. PCR products were subjected to DNA sequencing for characterization after cloning into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). DNA sequencing
was carried out using the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method [28]. Fragment F6H·1 was amplified
using a mixed primer set, T7 and Micro1Rev, and contained the peptide sequence to which the primer was
designed, as well as certain conserved ODD motifs and a
second peptide sequence. In order to isolate full-length
putative F6H clones, new sets of primers were designed
specifically to the ends of the F6H·1 sequence and the
screening procedure was repeated with vector primers
under stringent conditions. Alternatively, the bacteriophage cDNA library was screened as described in [29],
using the F6H·1 fragment (602 bp) as an oligonucleotide
probe. The near-full-length cDNA fragment isolated that
putatively encoded the F6H was termed cF6H. Given the
lack of fresh C. americanum tissue and its disappearance
from its natural habitat, for use in 5'-rapid amplification
of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments or primer extension,
genomic DNA-based techniques such as inverse PCR and
GenomeWalker (ClonTech) were employed in attempts
to isolate the remaining 5'-end of the putative F6H
sequence. Nevertheless, neither of these approached
proved successful.
To isolate the genomic region coding for the cF6H, C.
americanum genomic DNA (0.1 to 1.0 µg) was employed
as a template for PCR using primers designed to the ends
of the cF6H sequence. Putatively positive fragments were
subsequently cloned into the pGEM-T vector for DNA
sequencing.
To determine the copy number of F6H, genomic DNA (15
µg) was digested overnight and subjected to Southern
analysis according to [30]. The probe, cF6H, was labeled
using the BioPrime Kit (Amersham) designed for the
preparation of biotinylated nucleotide probes for blotting
with the IRDye800-conjugated Streptavidin (Rockland
Immunochemicals) as the detection system. The membrane was pre-hybridized using UltraHyb-OS (Ambion)
at 42°C for 2–3 h. Hybridization was carried out with
denatured, biotinylated probe solubilized in a fresh aliquot of UltraHyb-OS overnight at 42°C. The membrane
was washed according to manufacturer's instructions
using wash solutions I and II. The membrane was blocked
with blocking solution for one hour at room temperature,
prior to probing with IRDye800-labelled streptavidin
(1:10,000) in blocking solution for 1 h at room

temperature. The membrane was washed with blot washing solution three times, 15 min each, prior to detection.
Cloning and expression strategies
The cDNA fragment encoding the near-full length F6H,
cF6H was cloned into an E. coli expression system (pTrcHis; Invitrogen) The fragment was amplified by PCR using
gene-specific primers, containing BamHI and HindIII recognition sites, respectively. The DNA insert is positioned
downstream and in-frame with a sequence encoding the
(His)6-tag and an enterokinase cleavage recognition site.
The pTrc-His-F6H construct was transformed into Top 10
cells by heat shock, and selected on ampicillin (50 µg/mL)
containing media. Recombinant protein production in E.
coli strain Top 10 was induced by the addition of 1 mM
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at
37°C. After sonication of the cell pellet and centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed for F6H enzyme activity
or purified on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The affinity-purified protein was eluted in presence of 250 mM imidazole
and subjected to buffer exchange on a PD-10 column
against the assay buffer. Enzyme assays and analysis of
reaction products were carried out as previously described
[3].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/20

Recombinant proteins obtained from both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic expression systems were subjected to SDSPAGE [31] and Western blot [32] analysis using chemiluminescent (HRP; Amersham) or IRDye800 (Li-Cor)
detection.
Phylogenetic analyses
Fifteen ODD genes involved in secondary metabolism
where biochemical information was available, belonging
to different plant species, were selected from the PubMed
and GenBank searches. The amino acid sequences were
aligned using CLUSTAL-W [33] and PHYLIP output format. The data was transferred into MacClade 4.03 [34] for
visual inspection and manual editing prior to analysis by
a phylogenetic tree building and analysis program, PAUP
4.0, beta 4 [35]. The optimality criterion employed for the
distance method was Neighbor-Joining [36]. The aligned
amino acid sequences were analyzed using a heuristic
search algorithm with 1000 random addition sequences.
Bootstrapping analysis was carried with heuristic search
based on 1000 replicates and the distance measure was set
to be equal to mean character difference.

List of abbreviations
cF6H F6H cDNA

Heterologous expression in the Pichia pastoris expression
system (EasySelect pPicZ-His; Invitrogen) can be either
intracellular (pPicZ) or secreted (pPicZα), depending on
the presence of an in-frame signal peptide. The cF6H fragment was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers,
containing KpnI and SacII recognition sites, respectively.
For the pPicZ construct, the initiation ATG was part of the
yeast consensus sequence (AATAATGTCT) included in the
5' gene-specific cloning primer. For the pPicZα construct,
the insert was cloned in-frame with the N-terminal signal
sequence and C-terminal His-tag. The pPicZ-cF6H and
pPicZα-cF6H constructs were transformed into Pichia cells
by electroporation and putative multi-copy recombinants
were selected on Zeocin-containing media according to
manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Recombinant F6H production was induced by the addition of 0.5% methanol (in the absence of glucose) every
24 h for 3 to 4 days. A buffered culture medium (BMGY/
BMMY; containing 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH
8.0) was used for cell growth and protein induction in
order to enhance protein stability and limit enzyme inactivation. In the case of intracellular recombinant protein
production, cells were lysed using glass beads and extracts
were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen). Secreted proteins were collected and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (35 to 70% saturation), and used for activity assays after desalting or for
subsequent affinity purification.
