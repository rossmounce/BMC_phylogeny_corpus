Abstract
Background: The bumblebee Bombus terrestris is an ecologically and economically important pollinator and has
become an important biological model system. To study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level,
a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci (QTL)
mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. We here present a saturated linkage map and match it
with the Apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. This genome-wide comparison allows insights into
structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level.
Results: The high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the B. terrestris genome on 18 linkage groups (LGs) and
has a length of 2’047 cM with an average marker distance of 4.02 cM. Based on a genome size of ~ 430 Mb, the
recombination rate estimate is 4.76 cM/Mb. Sequence homologies of 242 homologous markers allowed to match
15 B. terrestris with A. mellifera LGs, five of them as composites. Comparing marker orders between both genomes
we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same
homologous LG.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both A. mellifera and B.
terrestris and a long divergence time of about 100 million years, the genomes’ genetic architecture is highly
conserved. This reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. We show that data on genome organization and
conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies,
opening up new avenues of research in the Apidae.

Background
The buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris is a key
pollinator for crops and wild flowering plants as well as
a model system in various disciplines of biological
research. This includes studies on population genetics,
mating biology, sexual selection, caste determination,
social behavior, host-parasite interactions, immunology
and plant-pollinator interactions [1-11]. In addition,
colonies of B. terrestris are commercially produced in
large numbers in Europe for pollination of greenhouse

crops [1]. Accordingly, many genomic resources have
been developed for this species such as molecular markers [12-15], genetic linkage maps [16,17] and BACand EST-libraries [18,19].
With the advance of genome sequencing techniques B.
terrestris is about to evolve into an important Hymenopteran genetic model species in addition to the honeybee,
Apis mellifera and the parasitic wasp Nasonia spp. Since
the bumblebee is phylogenetically very similar to A. mellifera with its fully sequenced genome, a genomic comparison between the two species is particularly
rewarding for understanding genome evolution in social
bees. The genome of A. mellifera revealed several exceptional traits including an extremely high recombination

rate, a very high AT-content, the lack of retrotransposons, and a high density of simple-sequence-repeats
(SSR/microsatellites) [20]. The evolution of these extraordinary genome characteristics is unclear. A comparison with the bumblebee genome might therefore reveal
common patterns resulting from the phylogenetically
close relationship, but also differences due to different
social colony structures and ecologies of honeybees and
bumblebees.
High resolution genetic maps are powerful tools to
study genomic organization [21,22]. Moreover, such
maps greatly facilitate genome assembly for full genome
sequencing [23]. Whereas most of the first genetic maps
were based on markers like RAPD, AFLP, isozymes or
mutant phenotypes, linkage maps are now increasingly
constructed with polymorphic simple sequence repeats
(SSR, microsatellites) or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [23-35]. Since these markers also include
sequence information of potentially conserved flanking
regions, they allow for anchoring genome assemblies
and for comparisons among species [24,28,32,35-37].
For B. terrestris two basic linkage maps are available:
one map based on RAPD and SSR markers [16] and
another map with AFLP and SSR markers [17,38]. However, in both maps the coverage and marker density was
insufficient to explicitly detect all known 18 chromosomes of this species’ haploid set [39]. Moreover, these
maps could not be used for genomic comparisons
between the honeybee and the bumblebee, because most
markers were either RAPDs or AFLPs, which do not
provide any sequence information.
In this paper we construct a dense and saturated
genetic (meiotic) linkage map for the bumblebee B. terrestris using recently published SSR markers [15] as well
as novel SSRs created from BAC-end sequences. Based
on this second generation linkage map and sequence
homologies of microsatellite-flanking regions, we compare the genetic maps of B. terrestris and A. mellifera to
identify homologous chromosomes, conserved synteny
blocks and rearrangements. These can be used to study
chromosome and genome evolution as well as QTL synteny among species.

Results
SSR markers

A screen of the BAC library [19] yielded 4’593 SSRs
with motifs of 1-6 bp in length of which 2’573 (56%)
were redundant or had too short sequences that were
flanking the repeat motif. For the remaining 2’020 loci,
a total of 960 primer pairs were tested for amplification
products. 910 of those (95%) yielded PCR products and
were screened for polymorphisms in B. terrestris. 586
primer pairs (64.4%) showed two or more alleles of
which 564 were tested for polymorphism in the

Page 2 of 17

mapping population “BBM1” [17], a subset of 300 loci
by using fluorescent labels, 264 loci by using unlabeled
primers. This resulted in a total of 306 informative loci.
The 123 SSR loci published in ref. [15] yielded 56 additional polymorphic loci in the population BBM1 and
further three novel loci were developed as described in
[15]. A screen of 2’304 A. mellifera SSR markers
[23,40-42] yielded 15 loci that were polymorphic in
BBM1. (Additional file 1). Finally 274 SSRs were successfully or sufficiently genotyped.
Map

To construct the new linkage map, we used the raw
data (207 AFLPs, 39 SSRs) from the mapping population
BBM1 (which was used for the core linkage map [17])
plus another 46 SSRs from ref. [15] and 209 SSRs
derived from the BAC library (Additional file 2). Additionally three novel markers and 15 Apis mellifera
[23,40-42] SSR markers were mapped (Table 1, Additional file 2). Four AFLPs remained unmapped.
Although 75 markers showed segregation distortion,
they were nevertheless included because their exclusion
did not alter the map (Table 1).
Processing all available genotype data in JoinMap4
[43] yielded 18 linkage groups (LGs) all of which were
well supported by LOD scores of 8.0 or higher (Additional file 3). The 18 LGs, which most likely represent
the 18 haploid chromosomes [39], range in recombination size from 51.01 to 171.7 cM containing 8 to 38
markers (Table 1). The shortest one, LG B18, contains
only five AFLP and three SSR markers, the longest LG
(B06) has 35 markers. The length of a LG was correlated with the number of markers per linkage group
(Pearson r = 0.71768, p < 0.05). The average marker distance ranges from 2.54 cM (LG B03) to 8.31 cM (LG
B17) with an average of 4.02 cM (± 1.42 cM SD).
This map contains a total 516 markers and spans a
total of 1’902.21 cM (Additional file 2, Additional file 3).
This is an increase of 271.21 cM (16.62%) compared to
[17] (1’630.9 cM, reanalyzed with JoinMap4 [43]). To
correct for the missing chromosome ends, which cannot
be mapped since there are no flanking markers, the
length of each LG was adjusted by adding double its
average marker distance to the value calculated by JoinMap [44]. This resulted in a corrected map length of
2’047.09 cM (Table 1). Hence the genome coverage of
the present map is estimated to be 92.92%.
Based on the function c = 1-e-2md/L given in ref. [45]
where c is the proportion of the genome within d cM
distance to a marker, L the estimated genome length
and m the number of markers, 86.85% of the genome is
located within the average marker distance of 4.02 cM
and 99.99% of the genome is located within 17.6 cM
distance to a marker.

Genome size and recombination rate

The genome size of the bumblebee B. terrestris previously was measured by flow cytometry [16,17]. The
first measurement [16] was based on a staining method
biased towards the AT portion of the genome, hence a
correction is needed. The genomic AT-content of B. terrestris was estimated to be 61% by using 8.5 Mb nonredundant sequences (data not shown) from the BAC
library, representing about 1.98% of the genome. The
honeybee AT-content is 67.3% [46], 6.3% higher than
the bumblebee. Consequently the DNA content (0.27
pg) as measured by ref. [16,47] was corrected leading to
an increase of the ratio (B. terrestris/A. mellifera DNA
content) from 1.54 to 1.653. Thus the genome size of
the bumblebee Bombus terrestris was estimated to be
433 Mb.
A second estimate was obtained using the relation
between genetic distance and physical distance for two
markers from the two ends of a BAC clone [19]. The
two markers SSR_0929_66j14 and SSR_924_66j14 are
0.494 cM apart (Additional file 2). The average insert
size of clones from the BAC library is 102.9 kb, based
on a selection of n = 186 clones which doesn’t include
this BAC clone [19]. Extrapolated onto the whole map,
a genome size of about 426 Mb is calculated. This
nearly matches the previous estimate of 433 Mb. The
average between both estimates is 430 Mb. However,

preliminary data for the genome assembly of B. terrestris
(Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center, unpublished) give an additional estimate of
about 250 Mb for the size of the genome.
Using the length of this linkage map (2’047.09 cM), a
recombination rate of 4.76 cM/Mb is calculated, based
on a genome size of 430 Mb, and 8.19 cM/Mb based on
a genome size of 250 Mb.
Homology

A search for homologous sequences in the A. mellifera
genome for each mapped SSR marker yielded 242
homologous loci, with 15 being homologous with unassigned (unmapped) A. mellifera sequences. In 29 cases
the B. terrestris sequence was homologous to a gene or
a predicted gene in A. mellifera (Table 2, Additional
file 1, Additional file 2).
A B. terrestris map containing only the loci homologous to the A. mellifera genome was constructed (Figure
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). By comparing both maps, it was possible to homologize 15 of the 18 B. terrestris LGs with
corresponding A. mellifera LGs (Table 2). Omitting
homologues to unassigned A. mellifera sequences, 10
linkage groups could be precisely matched with 4 to 26
(mean 13.7) homologous loci. In case of LG B02 in B.
terrestris, all homologous markers match LG 2 in A.
mellifera. Five B. terrestris LGs were composites of parts

The numbers of markers homologous between Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera are shown for each LG. Bold numbers indicate matching B. terrestris and A.
mellifera LGs, as homologized LGs (the majority of the homologous markers is found in one LG) or as composites if a LG consists of a high proportion of markers
homologous to more than one A. mellifera LG. Single markers or low numbers of markers are left normal.

homologous to two different A. mellifera LGs each. 35
homologous loci were mapped on A. mellifera LGs that
were different from the homologized ones. The three
small LGs B16, B17 and B18 consist of too few homologous markers to assign them to A. mellifera LGs
(Table 2, Additional file 1, Additional file 2).
Overall, there are many conserved chromosomal
regions in both genomes. With 83 syntenic marker pairs
from 15 bumblebee LGs spanning a total of 302.16 cM
in B. terrestris and corresponding to 689.80 cM in A.
mellifera. The distances between syntenic marker pairs
ranged from 0.003 to 26.05 cM and from 0.08 to 54.28
cM for B. terrestris and A. mellifera, respectively
(Table 3, Additional file 4). In 18 cases three to six markers were conserved in sequential order. In total the
syntenic regions account for 14.81% of the whole map,
with the distribution among the different LGs being heterogenic. LGs B02 and B13 show the largest proportion
of syntenic regions with 47.99% and 41.66%, respectively. LGs B03 and B07 exhibit the lowest proportion
with 1.16% and 0.3% syntenic regions, respectively
(Table 3). The mean is 17.6%.
Most chromosomal regions showed rearrangements in
the spatial ordering of markers, but only within the
same homologous LG. These cases reflect inversions or
non-reciprocal translocations (chromosome mutations)

(e.g. Figure 2: B02). While such regions cannot be precisely linked to physical positions on the map as there is
no information about the exact locations of breakpoints,
these markers are nevertheless located on the same
chromosome. A total of 65 such blocks, which do not
show an inter-chromosomal insertion, were found in B.
terrestris and these account for 21.09% (431.76 cM) of
the whole map length (Table 3, Additional file 5). The
highest proportion of such homologous regions was
found on the two LGs B05 and B14 with 50.63% and
45.89%, respectively, whereas the two LGs B07 and B13
with 0 and 6.31%, respectively, showed the lowest proportion: the mean proportion is 24.59% (Table 3).
Taking into account the syntenic and homologous
rearranged proportions, a total of 35.9% of the whole
map length is conserved between A. mellifera and B. terrestris. With more than 60% the LGs B02 (73.99%), B14
(68.24%), and B05 (65.07%) exhibit the highest degree of
conservation, whereas the lowest degree was observed in
LGs B07 (0.3%), B03 (16.38%) and B15 (17.79%)
(Table 3): the mean percentage of conservation was
42.19%. Accordingly, a high percentage of the A. mellifera LGs are homologous but rearranged if compared to
those of B. terrestris (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
Inter-chromosomal (reciprocal) translocations of larger
regions only occurred in five composite chromosomes

(see above). Small interchromosomal translocations
(a single or double marker insertion) were only observed
in 21 cases. Those markers were homologous to A. mellifera LGs except for 2, 9, 11, 13, 14 and 15 which had
been “inserted” into B. terrestris LGs except in LG B02,
B08 and B12 (Table 3, Additional file 2).

Discussion
We here present a second-generation linkage map of the
bumblebee B. terrestris (Additional file 3). With 18 linkage groups spanning a total of 2’047.09 cM (Table 1) it
matches the known number of the haploid chromosomal set (n = 18) [39]. Compared to the previous core

linkage map (BBM1, [17]) both the number of LGs (n =
21) and the total map length (2’221.8 cM) are considerably smaller. The shorter map length is a result of a different mapping algorithm compared to that of ref. [17]
which used a maximum likelihood algorithm (Mapmaker [48]). The Mapmaker procedure per se assumes
no crossover interference causing map inflation whereas
the regression algorithm (JoinMap4 [43,49]) used in this
study does account for interference hence producing
much shorter maps although both algorithms use

Kosambi’s mapping function [26,49-52]. Since crossover interference is common in the honeybee and other
higher organisms [e.g. [23,53,54]] it seems prudent to
consider this mechanism for establishing the bumblebee
map. This highlights the importance of choosing a
appropriate mapping algorithm to generate comparable
and more precise genetic maps. Although several markers showed segregation distortion, those markers were
not excluded, since the algorithm (G2-statistics for independence) of JoinMap is not affected by segregation

distortion [43]. In some case, the Segregation Distortion
(meiotic drive) likely is caused by genotype gaps. But it
can also have a biological background such as asymmetry of the meiosis (driving allele ends up in the ovocyte
instead of in the polar bodies with a probability greater
than one half) or can involve gamete destruction (postmeiotic mechanism, e.g. by a selfish segregation distorter
genes as found in Drosophila, mouse and Tribolium).
However, our data don’t support further assumptions,
since the distorted markers are distributed across almost
all chromosomes (table 1) without showing a distinct
pattern (Additional file 2).

The present 1’902.21 cM map (sizes not corrected for
missing chromosome ends) contains 516 markers with
an average distance of 4.02 cM between markers. By reanalyzing the original data set used to create the core linkage map [17], we found that the map size was increased
only by 16.6% (271.21 cM) by including 277 additional
markers (map sizes not corrected for missing chromosome ends). The genome coverage (92.92%) is much
higher than the previous map’s 81% [17]. 99.99% of the
genome is located within a distance of 17.6 cM to a marker. The current map is thus nearly saturated and thus a
valuable tool for further QTL mapping studies [2,3].

The two prior estimates for physical genome size were
both based on flow cytometry and muscle cells, but differed substantially. Ref. [16] estimated a genome size of
274 Mb whereas ref. [17] reported an estimate of 625
Mb. The staining method used by [16] is typically biased
towards the AT content of the genome [55-58] and
hence may have lead to underestimating the genome
size of B. terrestris because the 61% AT content is only
6.3% less than that of A. mellifera [46]. By correcting for

the AT bias the B. terrestris genome size is estimated to
be 433 Mb, very similar to the estimate of 426.41 Mb in
this study derived from the relation of the measured
genetic and known physical distance between two neighboring markers. Theses concurring measurements lead
us to the conclusion that the genome size reported by
ref. [17] was overestimated. There is a further estimate
of about 250 Mb based on preliminary data for the B.
terrestris genome assembly (Baylor College of Medicine

this need to be verified.
Given a physical genome size of 430 Mb, the estimated
recombination density of 4.76 cM/Mb for B. terrestris is
slightly higher than the 4.42 cM/Mb previously published
[17]. Although this recombination rate is much less than

that of the honeybee genome (15.7 cM/Mb [46]) it is still a
high value compared to other eukaryotic organisms (Vertebrata 1.37 cM/Mb, Insecta excl. Hymenoptera 2.69 cM/
Mb, [46,59]). This supports the idea that a high genomic
recombination rate may be positively correlated with other
genomic traits such as AT content, as shown for several

For each LG information on the number (n) of marker pairs (intervals/segments) is given, which is also present as a marker pair (interval/segment) in A. mellifera
(synteny). The genetic length in cM of the synthenic intervals/segments in B. terrestris (B.t.) and the corresponding intervals/segments in A. mellifera (A.m.) and
the ratio between both species is given. Furthermore, the proportion (%) of synthenic marker intervals/segments of the total length of a B. terrestris LG is
calculated. Likewise numbers of intervals/segments, their length (cM) and proportion (%) of the total length in B. terrestris is listed for intervals/segments of
markers present in B. terrestris, but rearranged (not paired) on the matching A. mellifera LG ("homology”), indicating intrachromosomal rearrangements.
B. terrestris markers, which were found in a non-matching (see table 2) A. mellifera LG (interchromosomal rearrangement) are summed up as “inserts”.
The last column shows the proportion (%) of synthenic plus homologous marker intervals/segments for each B. terrestris LG.

organism groups with the exception of mammals [46].
Alternatively, a high recombination rate might have
evolved due to sex-restricted recombination (e.g. haplodiploid Hymenoptera) or may be related to sociality in
insects as such [59]. Social Hymenoptera show a higher
recombination rate (mean 10.27 cM/Mb, n = 4) than nonsocial parasitoid Hymenoptera (mean 3.99 cM/Mb, n = 4)
[46,59]. Depending on the B. terrestris genome size in the
final genome assembly, the recombination rate in the
bumblebee might be significantly higher than estimated
here. Based on a preliminary value of 250 Mb a very high
genome wide recombination rate of 8.19 cM/Mb is calculated making the relationships discussed above even more
clear. However, the sample size for data on genomes from
different taxonomic groups is still low, therefore a robust
conclusion is not yet possible.
Using sequence similarities, it was possible to unambiguously match 15 linkage groups between B. terrestris
and A. mellifera, of which five were composites consisting of partial homologous to two A. mellifera LGs
(Table 2). A high proportion (21%) of the genome
showed homology in terms of markers present on the

homologous LG, and 14.81% were identified as synteny
blocks, segments with preserved marker order without
disruption by rearrangements [60,61]. The genomic
homology is most striking at the level of individual LGs.
More than 40% of LG B02 and B13 are syntenic. If synteny and rearranged blocks are added, on average a total
of 42.19% of a LG is conserved. Three LGs even show a
conservation of more than 65% (Table 3).
This homology and synteny can be used to refer to
previously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) or
genes in the honeybee (as shown above, Additional
file 1). These loci may now serve as target candidate
regions for the same traits in the bumblebee; hence, the
map we present here can be a valuable tool for crossspecies genetic mapping. For example the thelytoky
locus of A. mellifera [62] is located on chromosome nr.
13, at 39 cM between the syntenic marker pair SSR_Apis_a124 (11.4 cM) and SSR_0083_47g5 (51.66 cM) (Figure 7, Additional file 2, 4). In B. terrestris this pair is
located on LG B13 (88.2 cM and 74.8 cM, respectively).
It is thus conceivable that the corresponding gene is
located between the same markers in B. terrestris.

Stolle et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/48

A biologically important element is the sex locus (csd
gene [63]), which is located on A. mellifera chromosome
nr. 3, at 243.95 cM. In the present new map there is
unfortunately no syntenic marker pair surrounding this
locus. The neighboring homologous markers are located
on Bombus LG B04 and B06, whereas the remaining
part of the chromosome is mostly homologous to LG
B03 (Figure 1, 2, 3, Additional file 2, 4, 5). While this
locus has already been mapped directly in B. terrestris
too [16], it cannot be homologized with the honeybee,
as the sex locus was linked only to RAPD markers.
Hence, there is no unambiguous information for the
location of the corresponding sex locus csd in B. terrestris. Its identification may require information on the
whole genome sequence of the bumblebee [64-66].
Comparisons of genome architecture can provide
insights into genome and chromosome evolution
[65,67,68]. As we have shown, there is a high degree of
homology between the genomes of B. terrestris and A.
mellifera. On the other hand the divergence time
between the bumblebees (tribe Bombini) and the honeybees (tribe Apini) has been roughly estimated based on
fossil records and several phylogenetic or molecular systematic studies [69-74]. From this data, Bombini and
Meliponini are considered to be sister groups, with the
split of the Bombini (plus the Meliponini) and the Apini
to have occurred 125 - 80 million years ago (mya) (mean
~ 100 mya), coinciding with the Angiosperm radiation
[75,76]. The genera Bombus and Apis are considered to
have radiated much later into today’s species diversity
[71,72]. Despite an independent evolution of about 100
million years, large parts of the genome and even almost
entire chromosomes are relatively conserved.
Other comparative genomic studies have revealed various degrees of conservation between genomes of species
with different divergence times. In the genus Drosophila
(age ~ 40 mya), for example extensive gene shuffling
within the homologous chromosome arms between even
moderately diverged genomes such as D. melanogaster
and D. erecta (divergence ~ 10 mya [77]) is observed. The
conservation of the genetic architecture between D. melanogaster and Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera, Tephritidae)
(divergence ~ 50-55 mya) was high in chromosomes X
and 3, respectively, whereas D. melanogaster chromosome
2 is composed of regions homologous to all five R. pomonella LGs with many inter-chromosomal rearrangements
[37]. In mammalian genomes, extensive shuffling of chromosomal regions between species (e.g. human, elephant,
horse, hedgehog, cattle, cat, mouse) of phylogenetically different lineages, which split about 90 mya has been
reported too [36,64,78-83]. Even within short evolutionary
times (<40 mya) extensive genome reorganizations have
been reported among the anthropoid Primates [84]. These
exceed the differences between bumblebees and honeybees

Page 13 of 17

by far, although insects usually have much shorter generation lengths. Clearly many more rearrangements, both
intra- and inter-chromosomal, have occurred among genomes of taxa with a similar divergence time as between B.
terrestris and A. mellifera.
In light of these other studies, the large degree of
homology between B. terrestris and A. mellifera is rather
surprising. In fact, similar levels of homology as
observed here are typical for very closely related species,
such as mouse and rat (divergence 16 mya [64]) or with
the example of the conserved marker order in chromosomes 3 and 12 of Apis mellifera and A. florea [85],
which split 20-25 mya [71]. The high level of homology
is furthermore surprising in light of the high genomewide recombination rate of both bee species, which
clearly exceed the average recombination rate in insects
or vertebrates [46,59].
Our findings suggest a very slow rate of genome and
chromosomal evolution in these two bee species. This
supports the previous conclusions that the honeybee
genome evolved more slowly than that of the fruitfly or
Anopheles mosquitoes [20]. Our new data and the conservation of marker order between two Apis species
[85], suggests that the genome and chromosome evolution might be slow in the whole family Apinae.
Reasons for such a slow evolutionary rate at the
genome level remain elusive. The relative lack of retrotransposons in A. mellifera [20] or the high density of
simple-sequence-repeats (SSR, microsatellites) might be
important factors. Sociality, which occurs in all four
Apinae tribes, or haplodiploidy could also favor a slow
genome evolution or vice versa. With the advance of
next generation sequencing, it will clearly be only a matter of time until the whole genome sequence of Bombus
terrestris and other bee species will be available. This
will then allow us to conduct a comprehensive genomic
comparison to unravel the ultimate evolutionary causes
of the high genome conservation in social bees.

Conclusions
This report describes the construction of the first saturated linkage map for Bombus terrestris with 516
mapped markers. The genome coverage is ~93%. Based
on homologies of microsatellite flanking sequences to
the genome of Apis mellifera it was possible to match
15 linkage groups. A genome comparison revealed that
about 15% of the genome is organized in syntenic blocks
and 21% in rearranged regions on the same homologized linkage group. Inter-chromosomal rearrangements
are less frequent. This high conservation of the genetic
architecture is unexpected since both bee species exhibit
a very high recombination rate and a long divergence
time. This map will be an essential tool for QTL mapping, with the high degree of homology potentially

allowing for cross species mapping in B. terrestris and A.
mellifera.

Methods
Mapping population & DNA extraction

A B. terrestris colony (BBM-1) was established as a
phase-known mapping population with 577 male individuals [17]. It originated from a mated and hibernated
queen from a wild catch in northwestern Switzerland.
We used the same specimens (males) from this colony
for this mapping study as well. DNA from the bumblebee individuals was extracted using the DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) following the manual.
Genetic markers, PCR, genotyping

End sequencing of a BAC-library [19] was carried out
according to [86] and a screen for 1-5 bp simple
sequence repeats (SSRs, microsatellites) was done using
MISA [87]. Complete sequences containing the SSRs
were checked against each other and already existing
SSRs [12-15] for redundancy, employing a local BLAST
search in BioEdit [88] or using the MAFFT alignment
algorithm [89]. Primer pairs were designed with BatchPrimer3 [90], Primer3Plus [91] or manually for the
resulting unique SSR loci. PCR was carried out at 50°C,
55°C and 60°C using a TGradient thermocycler (Biometra) to optimize reaction conditions. Standard PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 15 μL (~10
ng DNA, 0.25 μL of each primer (10 μM), 2.25 μL of
10x reaction buffer (160 mM (NH4)2SO4, 670 mM TrisHCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20), 0.13 μM of a mix
of each dNTP (10 mM) and 0.3 U Taq polymerase
(GeneCraft), 3 min at 94°C, 37 cycles of 45 s at 94°C,
45 s at 50-60°C and 45 s at 72°C, 3 min at 72°C). The
PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide and successfully amplifying loci
were then checked for polymorphism in B. terrestris by
performing a standard PCR containing a DNA pool from
11 B. terrestris queens or females (species identity was
confirmed according to [92]) from Estonia (Tartu),
France (Arles, Normandy), Hungary (Debrecen), Ireland
(Belfast), Sweden (Tovetorp), Belgium (Zemst), Norway
(Kalvøya), Austria (Vienna), laboratory colony (Koppert)
and Germany (Halle) (5 ng each). The PCR products
were run on a QIAxcel automatic capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel DNA High Resolution Kit) and analyzed
using the QIAxcel BioCalculator software (QIAGEN).
For a subset of polymorphic loci as well as the 123
microsatellite loci for B. terrestris recently published by
ref. [15] fluorescent labeled primers (FAM, HEX or
TET, Metabion) were used in multiplex standard PCR
reactions (containing three primer pairs with a different
fluorescent label and 20 ng of a DNA pool from 10
males) to detect informative (dimorphic) loci in the

Page 14 of 17

mapping population. The PCR products were run on a
MegaBace capillary sequencer and analyzed using the
FragmentProfiler software. Additional loci were tested
with unlabelled primer pairs in single locus PCR containing also 20 ng of a DNA pool from 10 males of the
mapping population and PCR products were run and
analyzed on the QIAxcel system (see above).
The genotyping of 288 to 384 males from the mapping
population was performed in multiplex PCRs with 2 - 10
primer pairs depending on fragment size and fluorescent
label. Multiplex PCRs with fluorescent labeled primer
pairs were conducted using PCR Master Mix (Promega)
and then run and analyzed on the MegaBace system (see
above). Multiplex PCR’s with unlabeled primer pairs were
conducted using the standard PCR procedure (see above)
and were run on the QIAxcel system (see above).
Worker-produced males were already detected and
excluded by [17]. However, two more individuals with
paternal alleles were detected and excluded from further
analysis.
Preliminary information for an additional estimate of
the genome size was obtained from Baylor College of
Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu).
Genotype analysis & map construction

For analysis of the genotypes the software JoinMap 4.0
[43] was used. The segregation was tested against the
normal Mendelian expectation ration using a Chi2 test
in order to detect Segregation Distortion. The software
first detects linkage groups (LGs) based on the independence LOD (larger than 5) calculated for the recombination frequencies and the linkage phase is automatically
determined using pairs with a LOD larger than 5. The
mapping was done phase-unknown using marker pair
LOD scores of 5 or higher. Ref. [17] confirmed that in
this system prior knowledge of linkage phase is not
necessary for accurate genetic mapping (no difference
between phase-known and phase-unknown mapping).
Furthermore, the phase for some loci on each LG is
known from [17], so the correct phase of each marker
could be established. Then, for each LG, marker order
and genetic distance were inferred by regression mapping using Kosambi’s mapping function [50] to account
for crossover interference. Three rounds were performed, using linkages with a recombination frequency
smaller than 0.40 and a LOD larger than 1.0. After adding a single locus a “ripple” (test for all possible 3-point
orders of consecutive markers to obtain the most likely
order for every marker) was performed using linkage
information from up to 10 neighboring markers to verify
that the marker order found in previous analyses was
correct. Maps were printed with the MapChart 2.2 software [93].

Homology of SSR loci

Using the available sequencing information for each
mapped SSR (whole clone sequence containing the
microsatellite, 337 to 961 bp) we performed a cross-species MegaBlast or alternatively BlastN search against the
Apis mellifera genome (NCBI, Amel 4.0). Unique Blast
hits with a homologous sequence larger than 30 bp, a
score higher than 45 or a maximal identity of higher
than 67% were used (two exceptions were made, where
one of the characteristics had fallen below one of the
thresholds). By plotting the genetic map [23] onto the
physical map [94,20], the genetic position on the respective A. mellifera linkage group could be estimated from
the physical sequence homology (Blast hit). Next, individual maps for each linkage group of B. terrestris were
plotted, only containing the homologous markers. Similarly all A. mellifera LGs were plotted again only using
the homologous markers from the A. mellifera map.
Both genomes were then compared side by side in MapChart2.2 [93].
