Abstract
Background: Because the Japanese native cattle Kuchinoshima-Ushi have been isolated in a small island and their
lineage has been intensely protected, it has been assumed to date that numerous and valuable genomic variations
are conserved in this cattle breed.
Results: In this study, we evaluated genetic features of this breed, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
information, by whole-genome sequencing using a Genome Analyzer II. A total of 64.2 Gb of sequence was
generated, of which 86% of the obtained reads were successfully mapped to the reference sequence (Btau 4.0)
with BWA. On an average, 93% of the genome was covered by the reads and the number of mapped reads
corresponded to 15.8-fold coverage across the covered region. From these data, we identified 6.3 million SNPs, of
which more than 5.5 million (87%) were found to be new. Out of the SNPs annotated in the bovine sequence
assembly, 20,432 were found in protein-coding regions containing 11,713 nonsynonymous SNPs in 4,643 genes.
Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using sequence data from 10 genes (more than 10 kbp) showed that
Kuchinoshima-Ushi is clearly distinct from European domestic breeds of cattle.
Conclusions: These results provide a framework for further genetic studies in the Kuchinoshima-Ushi population
and research on functions of SNP-containing genes, which would aid in understanding the molecular basis
underlying phenotypic variation of economically important traits in cattle and in improving intrinsic defects in
domestic cattle breeds.

Background
The Japanese native cattle Kuchinoshima-Ushi has long
been bred on Kuchinoshima Island in the Tokara Archipelago of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan (Figure 1A).
Kuchinoshima-Ushi, which have been used mainly as
pack animals, are characterized genetically as being lean
with a small body size (approximately 500-kg adult males
and 300-kg females), wide breast, narrow waist, and
horns. They have variable coat colours, including black,
black with white spots, and brown. This phenotype is
probably due to a population bottleneck caused by longterm isolation on this island. Similarities between ancient

Japanese cattle described in historical records and
Kuchinoshima-Ushi suggest that they have retained some
features of ancient native cattle (Figure 1B, C). Currently,
the four major Japanese domestic cattle breeds, namely,
Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, Japanese Shorthorn, and
Japanese Polled, are bred mainly for meat in Japan. These
breeds were established by crossing Japanese native cattle
with several European cattle breeds during the mid-19th
century to improve the native stock. However, the specific characteristics inherited by modern Japanese domestic
cattle are unknown.
Since the first whole-genome assembly of the human
genome in 2001 [1], the sequencing and assembly of mammalian genomes have quickly progressed. The bovine
genome was assembled by the international bovine wholegenome sequencing project through a combination of
shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)

sequencing of an inbred Hereford cow and her sire by
using capillary sequencing [2]. Recently, Van Tassell et al.
(2008) contributed more than 23,000 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) to the bovine SNP database
(dbSNP) by next-generation sequencing using a dairy
breed (Holstein) and seven major breeds of beef cattle [3],
and more than 2 million SNPs have been submitted to the
bovine dbSNP to date. Although the array approach with
these SNPs is useful, the underlying SNP resource is far
from complete for understanding genome structure [4,5].
Eck et al. (2009) generated 24 gigabase (Gb) of sequence
with an average 7.4-fold sequence depth from a single
Fleckvieh bull by next-generation sequencing [6] and identified more than 2 million previously unknown SNPs and
115,000 small insertions and deletions (indels) in comparison with the reference sequence. Although the bovine genome and HapMap projects have progressed [2,7], the
sequences of Japanese cattle have not been utilized in the
respective projects. Therefore, we conducted a wholegenome analysis to examine the genetic features of the
Japanese native cattle Kuchinoshima-Ushi and to gain a
better understanding of the genetic relationship between
domestic cattle breeds and Kuchinoshima-Ushi. This study
provides detailed genetic information of this breed of
cattle based on 64.2 Gb of sequence data generated by
next-generation sequencing.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing, mapping, and SNP/indel detection

Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (GAII) using the genomic DNA from a
Kuchinoshima-Ushi male and generated 64.2 Gb of high
quality sequence on 34 paired-end lanes (75-bp reads in

Page 2 of 8

28 lanes and 36-bp reads in 6 lanes). Read mapping to
the reference sequence (Btau 4.0) was performed using
BWA [8], and 86% of the obtained reads were successfully mapped to a unique position on the bovine reference genome sequence (Btau4.0). Of the total mapped
reads, 239,789,699 (26% of the total reads) were mapped
to multiple chromosomal positions. We used uniquely
mapped reads (551,136,389; 60% of the total reads) for
further analysis (Figure 2). The chromosomal distribution of the mapped reads was unbiased except for chromosome 13 (Additional file 1). The number of reads
mapped to chromosome 13 seemed higher than the
average relative to the chromosome length. When we
examined the read coverage of the chromosome 13 in
detail, we found that most of the reads were mapped in
a region known as the satellite repeat region. Although it
is unknown why such a number of reads were mapped
preferentially in the satellite region of chromosome 13, it
is probably due to the feature of the mapping program
BWA. We also performed mapping analysis using
repeat-masking sequences ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.
edu/goldenPath/bosTau4/bigZips/, which showed that
high number of reads mapped to BTA13 disappeared
(Additional file 1). It shows that the region with high
number of reads mapped is masked as repeat.
On an average, 93% of the genome was covered by
reads (Additional file 2), and the number of mapped

reads corresponds to 15.8-fold coverage across the covered region. However, the previous study describing
whole-genome sequencing of a Fleckvieh bull reported
that 98% of the genome was covered by the reads at a
relatively low read depth (7.4-fold) [6]. The relatively
lower genome coverage in our study is probably due to
the fact that compared to the Fleckvieh breed, the
Kuchinoshima-Ushi breed is evolutionarily more distantly related to the breed of the reference genome
(Hereford). The difference in coverage can also be due
to the number of prepared libraries (three different
libraries in the Fleckvieh breed, whereas only one library
in the Kuchinoshima-Ushi breed).
Using SAMtools [9], 6,303,790 SNPs were detected;
3,491,313 (55.4%) were heterozygous and 2,812,477
(44.6%) were homozygous. Of the identified SNPs,
5,031,648 (79.8%) were located in intergenic regions and
218,967 (3.5%) were within the 5-kb regions upstream
or downstream from gene regions (Figure 3A). The

regions (Figure 3A). The number of SNPs in each chromosome decreased in accordance with the decrease of
the length of chromosomes, and the SNP density in
each 1-kb region of the total genome sequence showed
that the chromosomal distribution of the SNPs was
unbiased (Additional file 3, 4). The locations of the
identified SNPs were also compared with those already
published (dbSNP Build 129; latest version of dbSNP
data ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/organisms/cow_9913/
chr_rpts/); 12.9% of the SNP sites were found in the
database, and the remaining 87.1% were new. The percentage of newly identified SNPs in this study closely
agreed with the results from a previous study [6]. We
also investigated indel events and found 629,256
(284,007 insertions and 345,249 deletions). Of these
indels, 498,101 (79.2%) were in intergenic regions,
23,686 (3.8%) were within 5-kb upstream or downstream
of gene regions, and 107,469 (17.1%) were in gene
regions (Figure 3B). The number of indels in each chromosome decreased in accordance with decrease of the
length of the chromosomes (Additional file 3). The
length of most indels was 1 bp (Additional file 5).
Sequence data were deposited in the DDBJ Read
Archive (DRA) [Accession #: DRA000172] and identified
SNPs excluding ambiguous bases and those mapping to
multiple locations unless providing more than 5 kbp
flanking sequences were submitted to the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) at NCBI under the
handle TUANGRC. In addition to submitting data to
the standard repositories, the positions of the SNPs for
Kuchinoshima-Ushi can be viewed in a customized
installation of the UCSC Genome Browser http://www.
nodai-genome.org/btau/cgi-bin/hgGateway, along with
supporting evidence (the number of reads for each allele
and the density of the SNPs).
Functional annotation of nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)
and nsSNP-containing genes

The SNPs in gene regions were annotated using the
RefSeq and GenBank gene sets (16,635 genes). We found
1,004,496 SNPs in introns, 17,684 in untranslated regions
(UTRs), 801 SNPs in splice-sites, and 20,432 coding SNPs
leading to 11,713 nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions
(Figure 3A). The percentage of nonsynonymous changes
in the coding region was 57.3%, which was higher than
that of any other previous studies of whole-genome resequencing in humans and cattle [6,10-15]. This finding
would indicate on a possible occurrence of pseudogenes,
the existence of proteins whose functions have been
severely affected by extensive amino acid substitution, or
significant differences in segmental duplications or copy
number variants. Alternatively, the number of nsSNPs
might have increased due to the false positives created by
incomplete annotation information.

Percentage of genes

In our Kuchinoshima-Ushi data set, nsSNPs were
detected in a total of 4,643 genes, which are listed in
Additional file 6. Gene ontology (GO) terms associated
with the 100 genes containing the highest number of
nsSNPs were compared to those of all genes in the
bovine whole genome by using the web-based tool
agriGO [16,17]. The analysis showed that the genes
associated with molecular functions such as protein
binding, catalytic activity, and metabolic pathways and
their regulation were enriched among the top 100
nsSNP-containing genes in the Kuchinoshima-Ushi
population (Figure 4A, Additional file 7). These results
suggest the possibility that phenotypes associated with
these genes may represent specific characteristics of the
Kuchinoshima-Ushi breed. In contrast, genes involved in
environmental adaptation such as sensory perception or
immune function were not enriched in the list of the
top 100 nsSNP containing genes.
We also examined whether nsSNP-containing genes
were reportedly associated with economically important
traits such as meat/milk production, growth rate, and
domestication in other breeds of cattle. In order to
extract information from studies reporting relationships
between SNPs/genes and traits, we performed a PubMed
search using economical traits such as growth rate or
meat production as the query and limited the search to
studies of Bos Taurus. From the result of the search,
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ nucleotide records reported in
the obtained articles as well as sequences referred to in
the articles as references (RefSeqs) were extracted and
compared with the list of nsSNP-containing genes in
our analysis of Kuchinoshima-Ushi.
Of the 4,643 nsSNP-containing genes, 708 matched to
genes that have been reported to be potentially associated
with economically important traits such as meat/milk
production, growth rate, and domestication in other cattle breeds [18-22] (the list of genes containing nsSNPs
that were reported as trait-associated in other cattle
breeds is shown in Additional file 8). Some of the genes
were also found to reside at positions of significant quantitative trait loci (QTL; data from Cattle QTLdb http://
www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/BT/index); for
example, body growth-associated genes such as genes for
growth hormone (GH), growth hormone receptor (GHR),
and leptin receptor (LEPR) [18-20]; lactation-related
genes like prolactin receptor (PRLR) and caseins (CSN);
and genes encoding immune-related proteins in milk,
such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) [21,22].
Recently, associations between SNPs and phenotypes
have been reported in many studies, including cattle
[23,24]. Some SNP sites identified in Kuchinoshima-Ushi
have already been reported to be associated with phenotypes in other cattle breeds (Figure 4B). For example, a
mutation found in the fatty acid binding protein 4

Nevertheless, population genetic studies in the
Kuchinoshima-Ushi breed are required to validate the
identified nsSNPs and to examine their association with
relevant phenotypic traits in this population. Also, most
nsSNPs identified in Kuchinoshima-Ushi have yet to be
reported, nor have their functions or associations been
investigated; new nsSNPs identified in this study will be
valuable for future research.
Phylogeny of bovine-related species

To understand the genetic relationships between Kuchinoshima-Ushi and other breeds of cattle, we carried out
a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant maximum likelihood tree of bovine-related species is shown in Figure 5.
Bovinae subfamily relationships were largely consistent
with those in an earlier study [31], with the exception of
the phylogenetic position of bison and the sister-group

relationship between East Asian river buffalo (Bubalus
bubalis) and swamp buffalo (Bubalus carabasis). Two
subtribes, namely, Bovina and Bubalina, formed a monophyletic group with high maximum likelihood (ML)
bootstrap (BS) and Bayesian posterior probability (PP)
support (BS > 99%, PP = 100%), respectively. In
the Bovina clade, Hereford, Holstein, Tuli, and
Kuchinoshima-Ushi comprised a monophyletic group
with high statistical support (BS = 100%, PP = 100%),
and Kuchinoshima-Ushi was the sister lineage of all
other breeds of Bos taurus cattle with relatively high statistical support (BS = 74%, PP = 100%). Among species
of wild cattle that have never been subjected to selective
breeding, such as Banteng and Gaur, KuchinoshimaUshi was the nearest species of domesticated cattle.
These data also suggest that Kuchinoshima-Ushi would
be an appropriate breed for investigating adaptations
associated with the domestication of wild cattle. When
the sequence data of Japanese domestic breed of cattle
such as Japanese Black will be available, the phylogenetic
position of “Japanese native cattle” should be revealed
more clearly.

Conclusions
In the present study, Japanese native cattle KuchinoshimaUshi, which have retained their phenotype over time without being affected genetically by European domestic
breeds, were used for whole-genome resequencing with
a next-generation sequencer. We identified 6.3 million
SNPs, of which more than 5.5 million (87%) were found
to be new. Among the identified SNPs, some nonsynonymous SNPs were found in genes that have been
reported as candidate genes for QTL affecting economically important traits in other cattle breeds. The results
of phylogenetic analysis showed the phylogenetic position of Kuchinoshima-Ushi. In the current status of
domestic cattle, repeated selection for specific traits
such as weight gain as well as milk and meat production has progressed, but problems have emerged with
unconsidered traits such as reproduction and disease
resistance. Our results provide a framework for future
investigations aiming at the understanding of gene functions and identifying the molecular basis underlying
phenotypic variation of economically important traits in
domestic cattle breeds. It would contribute to the development of a new, more efficient breeding system preferentially for East Asian domestic cattle breeds including
Japanese one. Furthermore, genome information for
Kuchinoshima-Ushi is expected to be important not
only in revealing the genetic structure of a geographically isolated breed originating from ancient, native
Japanese cattle but also in identifying genetic traits that
distinguish domestic breeds from original, undomesticated species.

Methods

Software

Breeding conditions for Kuchinoshima-Ushi

For alignment and annotation of the sequence reads,
we used the bovine genome assembly Btau 4.0
ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau4/
chromosomes/ as a reference source. In this study,
sequence scaffolds not yet assigned to specific chromosomes were excluded and no repeat masker was applied
to the assembly.
Image analysis and ELAND alignment were performed
with Illumina’s Pipeline Analysis software ver. 1.4.
Sequences passing through the standard Illumina GA
pipeline filters (i.e., clusters with intensities greater than
0.6-times the average of the highest and the sum of the
two highest intensities for the first 25 cycles) were
retained for further analysis.
For short-read alignment and consensus assembly, we
used a recently developed algorithm, BWA ver. 0.5.0
(the outline of the algorithm is available online http://
bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) [8]. The BWA default values
for mapping were as follows: maximum edit distance
(maxDiff) = 0.04, maximum number of gap opens (maxGapO) = 1, maximum number of gap extensions (maxGapE) = -1, disallow a long deletion within bp
(nDelTail) = 16, disallow an indel within bp (nIndelEnd) = 5,
take the first subsequence as seed (seedLen) = infinite,
maximum edit distance in the seed (maxSeedDiff) = 2,
number of threads (nThrds) = 1, mismatch penalty
(misMsc) = 3, gap open penalty (gapOsc) = 11, gap
extension penalty (gapEsc) = 4, and parameter for read
trimming (trimQual) = 0. After read mapping, we discarded the reads mapped to multiple chromosomal positions and unmapped reads. Only reads mapped to a
unique position on the reference genome sequence were
used for SNP calling.
To call SNPs, we used SAMtools [9] and applied additional filters as follows: minimum read depth = 3, minimum read depth calling the SNP = 2, and a 30% cutoff
of percent aligned reads calling the SNP per total
mapped reads at the SNP sites. We also filtered these
identified SNPs with more stringent parameters (i.e.,
minimum depth = 4, minimum SNP = 2, and 30% or
higher aligned reads calling the SNP; and minimum
depth = 5, minimum SNP = 3, and 30% or higher
aligned reads calling the SNP), but the difference in the
number of SNPs was small (Additional file 9). Heterozygous and homozygous SNPs were distinguished using an
80% cutoff of percent aligned reads calling the SNP. We
also used BWA to estimate the sequence read depth,
which influences the coverage and accuracy of SNP calling. After SNP calling, we annotated the SNPs using the
GenBank and RefSeq gene sets (16,635 genes; the gene
set is available from the UCSC download site ftp://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau4/database).

For our experiments we used genomic DNA from a
horned 119-month-old male Kuchinoshima-Ushi (#8915)
(Figure 1B) that weighed 485 kg and was black with
large white spots. The cattle in the wide field of Nagoya
University are bred under good and relaxed conditions.
In 1990, one male and three female Kuchinoshima-Ushi
were captured on Kuchinoshima Island and transferred
to the stock farm at Shitara Field, Nagoya University. In
1993, two males and three females were brought to the
field from the Nagoya Animal Science Foundation. By
2004, the group had increased to 23 males and 22
females with inbred conditions in a closed colony.
DNA library construction and sequencing

Blood sampling was carried out according to the ‘Regulations for Animal Experiments in Nagoya University’ and
the ‘Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’, as specified by the Tokyo University of Agriculture.
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using standard phenol/chloroform extraction methods [32].
A genomic DNA library was prepared using a pairedend DNA sample prep kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Preparing Samples for Sequencing Genomic DNA, Part
# 1003806 Rev.B, Illumina) with slight modification as
follows: 2 μg of DNA were fragmented to a median fragment size of 200 bp using Adaptive Focused Acoustics
(Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). After size selection
on a 2% agarose gel, 10 μl of the DNA fragments was
enriched by 12 cycles of PCR. For quality control, an aliquot of the library was cloned into a sequencing vector
(TOPO TA Cloning ® Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen
Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 96 clones were
sequenced by sanger sequencing. We found that all
sequences were unique, and duplicates were not
detected in the analyzed sample. BLAST search in the
bovine genome sequence database using these sequences
revealed high (90%) similarities to respective bovine
sequences. DNA concentration was measured using UV1800 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The genomic DNA library was
diluted to 10 nM, and a 2 μl aliquot was used to generate clusters on the Illumina Cluster Station using the
Paired-End Cluster Generation Kit v2 (Illumina) and
sequenced on the GAII with the SBS 36-cycle Sequencing Kit v3 following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Using the Paired-End Cluster Generation Kit v2 on the
Cluster Station and Paired-End Module, Part #: 1005629
Rev.C; Using the SBS Sequencing Kit v3 on the Genome
Analyzer, Part #: 1005637 Rev.A, Illumina) as 75-bp and
36-bp reads (28 and 6 paired-end lanes, respectively).

Phylogenetic analysis

We used 15 species from the Bovinae subfamily (9 species from subtribe Bovina, 5 species from subtribe Bubalina, and one species from tribe Tragelaphini as an
outgroup) for the phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 10).
On the basis of a previous study [31], we used 10 nuclear
genes (listed in Additional file 11). All of the sequence
data except for that of Kuchinoshima-Ushi were previously determined and published (accession numbers
can be seen in Additional file 11). Sequences of the genes
from Kuchinoshima-Ushi were determined reflecting
its SNP information in the reference sequence data.
We concatenated newly-determined sequences of
Kuchinoshima-Ushi and the published sequences and
aligned them for the phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic
trees were estimated using partitioned ML and partitioned Bayesian methods using RAxML ver. 7.0.3 [33]
and MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [34], respectively.

mapped to the SNP sites, (2) SNPs: the number of reads calling SNP at
the SNP site, and (3) Mutation: the cutoff value of percent aligned reads
calling the SNP per total mapped reads at the SNP sites. Cut off value
was 30% in all filters. In the table, “%” means the reduced percentage of
the number of SNPs/indels compared with basic parameters (i.e., Depth≥
3, SNPs≥ 2, and Mutation≥ 30).

Additional file 1: Reads for all chromosomes of repeat masked and
unmasked genome assembly. In each chromosome, left columns show
the reads mapped to the assembly without repeat masking and right
columns show those to the repeat-masked assembly. Among the reads
that were mapped to the reference genome sequence, most were
mapped in pairs (blue column in each chromosome). However, in some
read pairs, only one was mapped (red column). Additionally, some read
pairs were mapped, but the distances or directions were not adequate
(green columns). Length of the chromosomes is shown in the yellow
line. High number of reads mapped to BTA13 of the assembly without
repeat masking (left column) was removed in the repeat-masked
assembly (right column).
Additional file 2: Length of the regions that are covered by reads
for each chromosome. Length of the regions that are covered by reads
for each chromosome. The length of chromosomes is shown in the blue
columns, and that of the regions covered by reads is shown in the red
columns. The percentage of the regions that are covered by reads in
each chromosome is indicated by the green line. On an average, 93% of
the genome is covered by reads.
