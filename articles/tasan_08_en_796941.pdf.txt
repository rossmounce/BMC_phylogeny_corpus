Abstract
Background: Individual researchers are struggling to keep up with the accelerating emergence of
high-throughput biological data, and to extract information that relates to their specific questions.
Integration of accumulated evidence should permit researchers to form fewer - and more accurate
- hypotheses for further study through experimentation.
Results: Here a method previously used to predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Tian et al.: Combining guilt-by-association and guilt-by-profiling to predict Saccharomyces
cerevisiae gene function. Genome Biol 2008, 9(Suppl 1):S7) is applied to predict GO terms and
phenotypes for 21,603 Mus musculus genes, using a diverse collection of integrated data sources
(including expression, interaction, and sequence-based data). This combined 'guilt-by-profiling' and
'guilt-by-association' approach optimizes the combination of two inference methodologies.
Predictions at all levels of confidence are evaluated by examining genes not used in training, and top
predictions are examined manually using available literature and knowledge base resources.
Conclusion: We assigned a confidence score to each gene/term combination. The results
provided high prediction performance, with nearly every GO term achieving greater than 40%
precision at 1% recall. Among the 36 novel predictions for GO terms and 40 for phenotypes that
were studied manually, >80% and >40%, respectively, were identified as accurate. We also illustrate
that a combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' outperforms either approach
alone in their application to M. musculus.

Introduction

With the ever-increasing collection of high-throughput
experimental techniques, data acquisition at the genomic

scale has never occurred more rapidly. As the raw data continue to amass, each biologist is faced with the difficult challenge of integrating and interpreting the data that are most

relevant to each specific research question. Comprehensive
annotation systems are thus of paramount importance, as
evidenced by the integration of a large number of data types
in many model organism databases [1-4]. Such databases are
now the researcher's starting point for informed hypothesis
generation, making the daunting task of curating the source
data for representation in model organism databases crucial
to effective science.
Recognizing this problem, curation systems are becoming
increasingly reliant on computational approaches to assist in
the annotation process. Sequence similarity (both at the
nucleotide and peptide levels) has traditionally been the primary source of automated annotation. Particular motifs
found within a sequence can be used to infer a gene product's
molecular activity, with increasing work being done to identify the domains that facilitate protein interactions [5]. Similarly, when working with an uncharacterized gene, identifying
characterized homologous sequences in other species is often
the first step to understanding the gene of interest (which
underscores the great benefit of multiple model organism and
associated databases). Identifying gene function solely
through sequence-based approaches has its limitations, however. Often sequence similarity must be restrictively high for
correct inference of functional annotation [6], and in many
cases no homolog has yet been characterized.
The integration of other high-throughput data types has been
shown to be effective for combating the limitations of annotation systems reliant only on sequence similarity [7-13].
Recently, an attempt has been made to assess the ability of
such methods to make Gene Ontology (GO) annotations in
Mus musculus: the MouseFunc project [14]. A wide range of
data was collected for each of 21,603 mouse genes, and 9
models were built by research groups working independently
to determine whether the successes achieved with previous
data integration methods on single-celled eukaryotes could
be replicated in a complex mammalian system with a large
fraction of genes being wholly (or incompletely) un-annotated. Here we present results from one of the nine modeling
approaches submitted for the MouseFunc project (the methodology as applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described
in [15]), producing an updated set of genome-wide annotation predictions for approximately 3,000 GO terms [16] for
M. musculus. In addition, we provide predictions for approximately 4,000 mammalian phenotype terms [17], which can
assist in selection of (often resource-intensive) phenotyping
assays for knockout mice. We evaluate classifier performance
according to genes not used in training the predictive models.
A subset of the highest confidence novel predictions are
investigated in the published literature and are discussed further.

Results
Compilation of data
Data of a large number of distinct types were collected and
organized for both phenotype and GO term prediction. Protein domain annotations, protein-protein interactions,
expression data, disease data, and phylogenetic profile data
for 21,603 M. musculus genes were taken from the dataset
established for the MouseFunc project [14]. Expanded and
more recent (relative to the MouseFunc data [14]) sets of
mammalian phenotype and GO term annotations for the
same mouse genes were acquired from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) [17]. Detailed descriptions of the data organization and pre-processing are given in the Materials and
methods (see below).

A combined learning approach for annotation
prediction
A machine-learning approach was used here for function and
phenotype prediction. We used a weighted combination of
two distinct models, rather than adopting a single family of
models for prediction. For clarity, a brief description of the
general method is described here, with further details available in this issue [15].
First, we applied a gene-centric 'guilt-by-profiling' approach.
Here, properties associated with single genes (for example,
matches to specific protein domain patterns) were used to
infer various annotations for those genes. In this case, a distinct random forest classifier [18] was constructed for each
GO term or phenotype. Second, a paired-gene approach was
applied ('guilt-by-association'). Pairs of genes are connected
by weighted edges, with weights representing belief that the
two genes are functionally linked (that is, a functional-linkage
graph [19]). Genes with strong functional links tend to share
annotations, and in cases where one member of a functionally
linked pair has an annotation and the other does not, a new
annotation can be inferred.
Annotation predictions made by each of these two component
classifiers were then combined using a regression model that
maximizes a chosen performance measure, exploiting the
best features of both predictive classifiers. A brief description
is given in the Materials and methods (see below) and in more
detail in an accompanying paper describing the methodology
and its application to S. cerevisiae gene function [15].

Genome-wide application of a combined learner to M.
musculus
Predictive models for 2,938 GO and 3,914 mammalian phenotype terms were made; 21,603 M. musculus genes were
given quantitative scores for each possible annotation of each
term (for a total of 21,603 × [2,938 + 3,914] ≈ 148 × 106 prediction scores computed).

Subdivision of terms based on specificity
The 2,938 GO terms currently (as of November 2006) annotated with a number of genes in the range [3,300] were
selected for training and prediction (here the notation '[a, b]'
indicates the range from a to b, inclusive of a and b). We
wished to evaluate separately the performance for terms of
different types and levels of generality. To this end, terms
were divided into 12 disjoint sets, each representing both a
single branch in the GO (that is, biological process [BP],
molecular function [MF], and cellular component [CC]) and a
range in current annotation count, that is, the number of
genes annotated with the term (we considered the ranges
[3,10], [11,30], [31,100], and [101,300]). The number of terms
in each set is given in Table 1. A similar division was created
for mammalian phenotype terms (from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology [17]), and terms having current annotation
count in the range [3,300] were selected for prediction. This
collection was similarly divided into four sets based on annotation count (as of October 2007) - the number of terms in
each set is shown in Table 1.

include aggregate performance measures for categories such
that scores for all terms within a single category are pooled.
Table 2 gives - for each category - the aggregate precision for
the combined classifier across varying levels of recall, as well
as the AUC-ROC. Precision at low recall is usually the driving
criterion for biologists, who generally want to have high precision (accuracy) when examining a 'short list' of candidate
genes for association with a particular function or phenotype.
For GO term prediction, mean AUC-ROC for the combined
classifier exceeds 0.8 for 9 out of 12 categories (with 0.5 AUCROC being expected for random predictions). At 1% recall,
the precision ranges from 41% to 92% across the 12 categories, with MF and CC terms being easier to predict for than BP
terms, and with difficulty in prediction increasing as the
existing annotation count for these terms decreases (due to
limited training data availability and a lower prior probability
of success due to low prevalence of existing annotations). The
performance levels for each category as the threshold varies
can be seen in Figures 1 and 2.

Quantitative predictive performance estimates
To evaluate the participating classifiers, the MouseFunc
project employed the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) and precision at specified
levels of recall (precision is the fraction of predictions [scores
above a given threshold] that are true, while recall is the fraction of true annotations recovered above some score threshold). We use the same general approach here, but include an
additional measure: 'mean average precision' (MAP). An ROC
curve indicates the relationship between true positives and
false positives as the score threshold for calling a prediction is
varied. Also used are points along the precision-recall curve
(as the threshold varies), with MAP being the mean precision
obtained at all distinct recall levels. In the case of a tie among
scores, the average precision over all permutations of the
response variable (the GO or phenotype term annotations) is
taken as the precision for that level of recall. The MAP has
been identified as a good alternative to other precision-recall
based statistics. Most notably, it has been deemed more useful than area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as a
measure of comparison between classifiers [20]. We also

Phenotype annotations prove systematically more difficult to
classify than GO term annotations (see Discussion, below).
The AUC-ROC for each pooled phenotype category exceeds
0.7, with precision at 1% recall ranging between 10% and 44%
(again with the observation that terms with lower annotation
count have lower predictive accuracy). Performance characteristics along the threshold range are depicted in Figures 3
and 4.

Examination of top novel predictions
Cross-validation and out-of-bag [18] performance estimates
are useful to assess the ability of the classifier to recover the
'gold positives' not used in the training process and, thus, the
generalizable performance of the classifier. However, the true
potential of such classifiers to impact biology is in their ability
to make novel annotations, even for genes used in the training
process. Thus, high-scoring 'incorrect' predictions are of
extreme interest because they provide novel hypotheses
about gene function and may serve to guide choice of experiments. (We note that some predictions may only be 'incorrect'
in the sense that cross-validation or held-out test set performance measures consider such cases as 'false positives' because
the gene has not yet been annotated with the property, even
though such a prediction may in fact be correct and thus
'novel'.) The MouseFunc project introduced a method for prospectively assessing the ability of classifiers to make novel
predictions [14]. Training data for MouseFunc reflected the
state of annotation knowledge in February 2006. When
scores were submitted in October 2006, the classifiers' ability
to recover held-out test data was assessed, but in addition the
classifiers' ability to predict for annotations that were newly
assigned between February and October was measured. The
methods in the MouseFunc project (group 'G') are fundamentally the same as those applied here; thus, we expect approxi-

mately the same level of novel term prediction performance
while using a newer set of GO data for training. It should be
noted that the performance reported in that work can be
viewed as a pessimistic measure of the actual performance, as
only a matter of months elapsed before assessing novel predictions, and many of the apparently false-positive predictions at the end of that period may ultimately be proven
correct by future experiments.
To gain intuition from specific examples, we examined some
of the most interesting novel predictions within the literature.
A gene/term prediction is novel and was considered interesting if it was not currently annotated in the reference database
and if there did not exist any current annotation involving the
gene and any non-root ancestor of the term. Otherwise, we
consider such predictions to be 'refinements' of existing
annotations. Within each category, the top interesting gene/
term combinations are scanned in decreasing order of confidence (that is, prediction score) and - to avoid over-weighting
particular genes or terms - a further filtering step is employed
to limit each gene and term to a single appearance in the list
to be followed up in depth. This filter is described in detail in
the Materials and methods (see below).

Literature evaluation of novel GO term predictions
Predicted GO annotations were reviewed by biologists within
the MGI group who are experienced with literature curation
(DPH and JAB). Three predictions were reviewed for each of
the 12 GO categories based on novelty with respect to existing
annotations. Each of these 36 predictions were placed in one

of the following four classes: class (i), available experimental
literature supports the predicted annotation (21 predictions);
class (ii), prediction likely to be correct but supported only by
indirect evidence in the literature (5 predictions); class (iii),
veracity of prediction is unclear (4 predictions); and class (iv),
the prediction is incorrect or unlikely to be correct based on
current knowledge (6 predictions). We determined that 19
predicted annotations were class (i), that is, they would qualify for annotation by current curation standards but have not
yet been annotated. A remaining two had been annotated
since our training data were collected, and were, therefore,
correct by definition. Excluding 4 'unclear' evaluations, this
leads to 26/32 ≈ 81% accuracy. Additional data file 1 lists
these predictions, ratings, and evidence supporting the ratings.
Some of the annotations in the first class could be assigned to
even more specific terms than the predicted annotation based
on current literature. For example, Adra2, predicted for
annotation with 'blood pressure regulation' (GO:0008217),
could be annotated to 'baroreceptor feedback regulation of
blood pressure' (GO:0001978), which is a child of 'blood pressure regulation' [21].
In some cases a biological explanation for the evidence that
proved useful in making the prediction was not immediately
obvious. In such cases, an examination of the reasons for the
prediction may shed light on underlying mechanisms of
action of the genes involved. An example of this is the class (ii)
prediction of subcellular localization of MYBPC1 (myosin

binding protein C, slow type) to the A-band. The primary
annotations of Mybpc1 leading to this prediction are protein
sequence patterns found by the classifier to be associated with
A-band localization (fibronectin type III domains and immunoglobulin I-set domains). Annotations of these domains do
not specify any particular localization signal, but the combination of these domain families nevertheless gives rise to Aband annotation predictions. This particular prediction was
found likely to be true in our follow-up due to literature-based
support [22]. Thus, it may be useful to annotate this combination of Interpro and Pfam domains as being associated with
A-band localization.
As one illustrative example of a class (iv) prediction, the gene
product of the Srd5a1 gene was predicted to be involved in the
process of 'genitalia development'. The literature reports that
a mutation in this gene product causes defects in parturition,
in particular, the cervix of the pregnant female fails to ripen,

resulting in the defect [23]. Although cervical ripening is a
process that involves the internal genitalia of the female
mouse, the cervix is mature before ripening and, therefore,
the ripening process itself is not part of the development of
the cervix. The process of cervical ripening is instead a process that would be part of 'maternal process involved in parturition' (GO:0060137). In this case, the GO prediction was
related, but subtle curator judgment was required to deem the
prediction incorrect. There was no other evidence in the MGI
literature collection that supported an annotation of Srd5a1
to 'genitalia development'.
Another illustrative example from class (iv) was the Vcl gene
product, which was predicted to be part of the extracellular
matrix. The protein has been shown to be part of adhesion
contacts that interact with the matrix, but curators could find
no evidence that it is part of the matrix itself (for example see
work by Ben-Ze'ev and coworkers [24]).

Phenotype term predictions
The top 40 phenotype predictions (across all four categories)
were also evaluated through an examination of the relevant
literature (by DPH and JAB). Of these, 13 were deemed
'would be annotated' or 'likely to be true' (class [i]), 11 were
considered 'unclear' (class [iii]), and 16 were found 'unlikely'
or 'very unlikely' (class [iv]). Excluding 'unclear' evaluations,
the success rate was 13/29 ≈ 45%. Additional data file 2 lists
these predictions and evidence supporting the evaluations.
In the case of the enlarged heart phenotype prediction for
Nfatc2, the absence of an embryonic heart phenotype had
been reported [25]. This highlights one of the difficult tasks in
predicting and evaluating phenotypes, in that this description
does not rule out a heart phenotype if the gene product were
perturbed by a different mutation or at another stage of development. Ten phenotype predictions were classified as unclear
either because little was known about the gene products, or

because the phenotypes that had been reported for knockouts
in the genes are severe and might mask the predicted phenotype. Examples of this are Tbx4 and Acvr1b. Animals with
mutations in these genes exhibit severe defects in early
embryogenesis that may mask phenotypes such as fused dorsal root ganglia or mandible hypoplasia that would only be
revealed by perturbing these genes later in development or
perhaps through more subtle mutations [26,27]. In general,
phenotype predictions are much more difficult to assess
because a phenotype must often be specifically sought or it
can be missed.
The value in phenotype prediction lies in its abilities to suggest the most relevant phenotype tests to apply to organisms
in which a given gene has been mutated. Many phenotypic
assays are resource intensive and are, therefore, unlikely to be
performed in the absence of a strong a priori hypothesis. An
example of a verified class (i) prediction that had not been

annotated previously is our association of the Vav2 oncogene
with abnormal circulating adrenaline levels. Vav2 knockout
mice have shown defects in heart, arterial walls, and kidneys,
as well as tachycardia and hypertension, each associated with
adrenaline regulation [28]. Thus, phenotype predictions are
often specific and may justify the investment of experimental
resources in potentially costly assays (for example, the use of
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] to measure
adrenaline levels in the Vav2 knockout mice) that may help
pinpoint phenotype and (in some cases) disease etiology.

Availability of predictions
All predictions have been made available through the worldwide web through a simple database gateway [29].

Discussion
Success of a combination-of-learners approach
'Guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' methods have
both been previously employed for functional prediction. The
combination of these approaches has been applied to the unicellular eukaryote S. cerevisiae [13,15]. Here we show that an
approach that combines classifiers of both types by logistic
regression is superior to that of either base classifier alone in
the mammal M. musculus for both function and phenotype. A
detailed discussion of this combination approach is provided
in [15]. Briefly, a single free parameter α weighting the contribution of each base classifier was chosen to maximize AUCPR. To avoid over-fitting, a single α was found for each pooled
category. Performance evaluation of the algorithm as applied
to M. musculus function and phenotype is described below.

As observed in [15], each 'base' classifier type (for example,
functional linkage decision trees) has unique strengths in different categories and across different performance measures.
The functional linkage approach ('guilt-by-association') tends
to be the favored base classifier when evaluated by ROCbased measures (Figures 5 and 6), but the 'guilt-by-profiling'
method excels when precision is the performance measure of
choice (seen in Figure 7 and to a lesser extent in Figure 8). We
believe that for many researchers the precision at low recall
levels is of greatest importance - and is ultimately how the
optimized combination method was guided in this study, aiding in the prioritization of a few high-scoring results for a
laborious literature-based follow up.
As seen with S. cerevisiae [15], different base classifiers may
each excel for some categories, or within a bounded specifi-

city range of a single category (for example, seen in some
cases in Figures 1 and 3). For prediction of M. musculus GO
terms, Figure 2 shows that CC terms seem to benefit the most
from using the functional linkage approach and that MF
terms do not gain much from the integration of the functional
linkage data. In contrast, MF annotation predictions (often
relying on specific domain features - inherently gene-centric
data - as primary predictors) tend to rely on the output of the
random forests approach. By tailoring the data most appropriate for each style of base classifier, the combination
approach leads to greater overall performance [15].
Figures 1, 3, 7, and 8 show the increase in precision across the
entire recall range (and as a single MAP score) when using the
combined scores relative to performance of each base classifier alone. Because we optimize the combination such that

AUC-PR is maximized, we also checked to see whether the
MAP measure for individual terms also increased. Figures 7
and 8 show that the mean of the MAP within each category is
increased using the combined approach. This is consistent
with results for S. cerevisiae function prediction [15] but had
not been demonstrated for mammals, for phenotype prediction, or using the MAP measure. The combined classifier's
performance in a precision-recall statistic does not guarantee
improvement in other performance measures. However, the
combination optimized for AUC-PR also led to AUC-ROC
improvements across most GO categories (Figure 2) and had
little impact for phenotype categories (Figure 6). We believe

that predictions with the most utility are those with high precision, which tend to be at low recall. Thus, we conclude that
the substantial benefits gained in precision using our regression-based precision-optimized combination easily justify
any potential drop in AUC-ROC measures. The ability to
increase predictive power using a combination of two classifiers leads to the natural question of, 'why stop at 2?' Indeed,
one can combine in a similar fashion many different classifiers, with the number of degrees of freedom in the optimization problem increasing linearly with the number of base
classifiers. Comparison of the optimized multiplicative coefficients might then be used to rate the relative contribution of

homeostasis' used the Interpro-catalogued protein domain
pattern 'Proteinase inhibitor, hirudin/antistatin' as the primary predictor (statins play a role in cholesterol regulation
through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity).

A method for characterizing high-scoring predictions
As discussed in [15], random forests offer an advantage over
some alternative machine-learning methods (for example,
support vector machines, or monolithic classification trees)
in that they provide a reliable variable importance measure.
This provides valuable insight into why a prediction was
made, offering the researcher a first step in understanding the
biochemical principles underlying the annotation. As an
example, a class (i) prediction associating the gene Plscr1
(phospholipid scramblase 1) and the GO term 'cholesterol

Conclusion

We have computed a confidence score for every pairwise combination of nearly 7,000 function or phenotype annotation
terms and over 20,000 M. musculus genes. Our classification
method exhibits high precision (between 41% and 92% for GO
categories at 1% recall) and has been shown to make accurate
novel predictions [14]. A selection of our highest ranking
novel predictions have also been examined in further detail,

revealing a high (>80%) precision and immediately aiding in
the annotation of mouse genes. The entire collection of scores
and variable importance rankings are available to the public
through a web interface. Our combined classifier approach
has shown to be more effective than either base classifier
alone, suggesting that integration of data sources and classifier approaches can improve predictions of phenotypes and
confirming in mammals conclusions about this function prediction method made previously in S. cerevisiae [15]. These
results support the idea that improved quantitative annotations may come by combining scores from large multi-group
efforts like MouseFunc.

SAGE data provided for the MouseFunc project were first
normalized within each library by that library's sum, thus
reducing library-specific effects. Libraries within a single
major tissue were then averaged (for example, two 'kidney'
libraries were averaged). The clustering methods employed
the Canberra distance, which is appropriate for count-based
(Poisson-like) data. This metric, defined as the sum of the element-wise ratios of the difference of the two expression profiles to their sum, tends to accentuate the effect of a given
difference among profiles close to zero. There is evidence [36]
that a distance metric that acknowledges the Poisson nature
of a counting-based method (for example, SAGE) may result
in more biologically relevant clusters.

Materials and methods

Protein domain patterns

Data sources
For both GO and mammalian phenotype term annotation
prediction, our training data consisted primarily of the datasets assembled and integrated for the MouseFunc project.
While much of the data originates from outside of the mouse
community, the curation and data integration (for example,
mapping between human interactions and their mouse equivalents) was primarily taken from the Mouse Genome Database [4] as part of the organization of the MouseFunc project.
Cases where data used here differed from that used in the
MouseFunc project are made clear below.

Expression data
Three expression datasets were used, two from microarray
experiments [30,31], and a third [32] using serial analysis of
gene expression (SAGE) [33]. After obtaining the data as
described in the MouseFunc project [14], we performed additional clustering using k-means [34] and agglomerative hierarchical [35] methods. Hierarchical clustering used both
complete- and average-linkage variants, with cuts at various
depths in the resulting dendrograms to produce a predetermined number of clusters. The resulting number of clusters
for each of the three methods was one of: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200,
500, and 1,000 for microarray data, and one of 10, 100, and
1,000 for SAGE data. Cluster membership was encoded by a
binary attribute matrix (3 × [2 × 1,880 + 1,110] = 14,610 columns, 21,603 rows) such that each variable (column) represents membership for a given cluster, and each binary entry
indicates membership for a given gene/cluster combination.
For the microarray-based expression data a log2 transformation was applied to the data provided for the MouseFunc
project. Post-transformation, genes that did not rise above
baseline sufficiently in any tissue (at least 40 observations >0
for Zhang data, at least 40 observations >3.0 for Su data)
were removed. Genes were also removed if they did not show
sufficient signal variation across tissues (difference between
maximum and minimum signals must exceed 1.0 for Zhang
data and 3.0 for Su data). The Euclidean (L2-norm) distance
function was used for these data.

Matches to protein domain patterns from the Pfam [37] and
InterPro [38] databases were as provided for the MouseFunc
project [14]. These data were placed in matrices with each column representing a particular domain (5,405 for Interpro
and 3,133 for Pfam) and each row representing one of the
21,603 genes.

Protein-protein interaction
Binary protein interaction data from OPHID [39] was
obtained as described in the MouseFunc project [14]. These
data was then clustered into complexes using MCODE [40]
(using the default parameter settings), resulting in 88 clusters
(minimum cluster size = 3, maximum cluster size = 97). Each
cluster is represented by a column in a binary matrix, in a
similar fashion to the data sets described previously.

Phenotype
The mammalian phenotype annotations made available for
the MouseFunc project consisted of only the 33 top-level
terms. For the GO predictions, these annotations were used
as-is (again, in a binary matrix form). For the mammalian
phenotype predictions, the entire phenotype term ontology
was examined in its most recent form. Annotations were
made based on data available from the Mouse Genome Database [4]. After filtering for only those with annotation count
in the range [3,300], 3,914 terms remained. Again, a binary
matrix representation was used for the classifiers.

Phylogenetic profiles
Two data sources (BioMart [41] and Inparanoid [42]) were
used in binary form as provided for the MouseFunc project
[14]. Each variable with such data represents a species, leading to a binary vector for each mouse gene describing the
presence of a known homolog in each species available (18 for
BioMart and 24 for Inparanoid).

Disease associations
Disease associations from Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) [43], as provided for the MouseFunc project
[14], consisted of 2,488 known Mendelian traits, each represented by a column in matrix form as above.

GO term annotations
GO annotations obtained November 2006 (the later of the
two GO downloads employed within the MouseFunc project)
were used for training GO prediction models, and (in some
cases) for training phenotype prediction models. There were
2,938 GO terms within the three branches (BP, MF, CC) having annotation count in the range [3,300].

Training data organization for functional linkage
approach
Training data for the machine learning algorithms were
organized generally as described in [15], with descriptions
specific to M. musculus data manipulation given below.
The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of
expression data was computed for each gene-pair (for each of
the three data sets). These continuous coefficients were then
binned into five groupings, E0.5, E0.6, E0.7, E0.8, and E0.9; each
group defined as:

Tasan et al. S8.14
¸

tation counts in ranges [3,10], [11,30], [31,100], or
[101,300]), leading to 34 binary variables. We excluded terms
within the BP branch to avoid potential circularity because
GO BP terms are often tightly related to phenotypes. The data
were then organized into a matrix with genes as rows and the
34 predictive variables as columns.

Training data organization for random forests
approach
For the random forest base classifiers, binary gene-centric
data were represented in a binary matrix form (each row representing one gene, each column representing a property
associated with that gene). When predicting GO terms, the
training matrix was composed of the protein domain data, the
phenotype data (top level only), the phylogenetic profile data,
and the disease data (for a total of 5,405 + 3,133 + 33 + 18 +
24 + 2,488 = 11,101 columns). For phenotype term prediction,
the training matrix consisted of the same data used for GO
prediction as above except without the phenotype data (for a
total of 11,068 columns).

Ex ={(a, b)|ρ1(a, b) ≥ x}
where a and b are genes, and ρ1 is the correlation coefficient
function. This resulted in 15 binary attributes describing each
gene-pair. The protein-protein interaction data were already
provided in gene-pair format, with each positive edge resulting in a positive gene-pair for a single binary matrix column
representation.
Protein domain pattern data were converted to gene-pair format using the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Let A and B represent sets of annotated domains belonging to (respectively)
genes a and b. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is then
defined as:

ρ 2 ( a, b) =

Probabilistic decision trees for functional linkage
approach
To generate functional linkage graphs, a single probabilistic
decision tree [44] was built for each category (12 for GO prediction, 4 for phenotype prediction). For each tree, the
response variable was whether or not the gene-pair shared an
annotation of a specific term within that category or any category in the same branch but with smaller annotation count.
This response variable is thus used as a proxy for the general
concept of two genes being 'functionally linked'. For GO term
prediction, training examples (gene-pairs) were filtered such
that only those genes with some existing GO annotation were

⎛ 10542 ⎞
included in the gene set, leading to ⎜
⎟ unique gene⎝ 2 ⎠

A∩ B

pairs. No such filter was performed for the four phenotype

Those gene-pairs (a, b) having ρ2(a, b) ≥ 0.9 were assigned
membership in a single set. Each domain dataset (Pfam and
Interpro) was processed using this method, resulting in two
binary variables.
The phenotype and OMIM disease data were given the same
treatment as that for the protein domain data, resulting in
two additional binary variables. The phylogenetic data sets
were processed identically to the protein domain data, except
that only three final Jaccard thresholds were used (0.7, 0.8,
and 0.9), resulting in 6 additional binary variables (3 each for
Biomart and Inparanoid data).
Thus, a total of 26 distinct binary variables describing each
gene-pair were used by the functional linkage classifier. For
phenotype prediction, eight additional variables were
included representing co-annotation of terms within the MF
and CC annotation sets (four groupings each based on anno-

functional linkage trees (giving ⎜

sion tree training and classification was then performed as
described in [15].

Random forests approach
Random forests are used as described in [15], with parameter
choices and organism-specific details as listed below. For
each GO term prediction a forest of 300 trees was built, with
a column sample size chosen as v/20 where v is the number
of remaining variables to be sampled at a given node. For the
phenotype predictions, 200 trees/forest and the same v/20
were used as parameters. Each term (2,938 GO and 3,914
phenotype) corresponds to a separate random forest model.

Logistic combination of methods
The two base classifiers for each GO or phenotype term were
combined via a logistic model, as described in [15]. The α
parameter corresponding to each category is shown in Table
3.

Calibration of scores
The combined scores go through a final calibration so that
they more closely approximate posterior probabilities. The
calibration method developed for this study was also applied
in the companion paper describing the MouseFunc project
[14], where it was desirable to calibrate scores produced by
vastly different learning methods (for example, support vector machines versus probabilistic decision trees). Briefly, for
each term t we convert gene i's score si to a new score:
∗
si =

L ⋅s i

where count(t) is the number of annotations for term t (that
is, the average scaled score will equal the prior probability of
positive annotation for term t).
