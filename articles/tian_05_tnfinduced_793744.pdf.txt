Abstract
Background: The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) initiates tissue inflammation, a process
mediated by the NF-κB transcription factor. In response to TNF, latent cytoplasmic NF-κB is
activated, enters the nucleus, and induces expression of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic gene
expression programs. Recently it has been shown that NF-κB displays two distinct activation
modes, monophasic and oscillatory, depending on stimulus duration. Characterization of temporal
expression patterns for the NF-κB network and determination of those genes under monophasicor oscillatory control has not been experimentally addressed.
Results: To identify the kinetics of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and determine whether
these two types of NF-κB translocation modes control distinct gene programs, a detailed kinetic
analysis of a validated microarray data set was performed on 74 unique NF-κB-dependent genes in
response to TNF. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct expression profiles termed the "Early",
"Middle", "Late" response groups, peaking 1, 3, and 6 h after stimulation, respectively. These
expression patterns were validated by Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and NF-κB
binding was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Each response group
was mapped to its molecular function; this analysis indicated that the Early group encodes cytokines
or negative regulators of the IKK-NF-κB pathway, and the Late group encodes cell surface
receptors, adhesion molecules and signal adapters. That similar coordinated sequential cascades of
gene expression were also seen in response to stimulation by the cytokine IL-1, and expression
patterns observed in MRC-5 fibroblasts indicated that the epithelial NF-κB program is relatively
stimulus- and cell type-independent. Bioinformatic analysis of the Early and Late gene promoters
indicates that although both groups contain similar patterns of NF-κB-binding sites, only the Early
gene promoters contain NF-κB-binding sites located in phylogenetically conserved domains.
Stimulation protocols designed to produce either monophasic or oscillatory NF-κB activation
modes showed that the oscillatory mode is required only for expression of the Late genes.
Conclusion: This analysis provides important insights into the TNF-regulated genetic response
program in epithelial cells, where NF-κB controls sequential expression patterns of functionally
distinct genes that depend on its oscillatory activation mode.

Background
Tumor necrosis factor (TNFα, TNF ligand superfamily 2
[TNFSF2]) is a prototypical inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine inducibly expressed by activated
macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T-cells and NKcells [1]. TNFα is a central mediator of the host inflammatory response by its ability to activate adhesion molecule
expression, enhance leukocyte trafficking, and affect the
expression of secondary cytokine cascades controlling leukocyte recruitment and activation [1,2]. TNF signaling is
mediated by binding and aggregating single-pass type I
transmembrane receptors (TNFR-I, ref. [3]) that then serve
as an anchor to recruit signaling proteins binding to the
death domains on the cytoplasmic receptor tails. Upon
assembly of this submembranous complex, two major
downstream signaling pathways are activated; these are
the jun NH2 terminal kinase -activating protein-1- and the
IκB Kinase (IKK)-Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways
[4,5].
Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor maintained in a cytoplasmic location by
binding the IκB inhibitors, proteins that bind and specifically inactivate it by masking its nuclear localization
sequence, thereby preventing its nuclear entry [6]. NF-κB
is activated by TNF signaling pathway indirectly as a result
of targeted IκB proteolysis (reviewed in ref. [7]). Signalinduced IκB proteolysis is mediated by activation of the
multiprotein cytoplasmic IKK (a.k.a., the "signalsome"ref.
[8]), a kinase that phosphorylates IκB specifically in its
NH2-regulatory domain, making it a substrate for proteolysis through the 26S proteasome and calpain pathways
[8,9].
As a result, liberated NF-κB rapidly enters the nucleus to
activate target gene expression by formating a nucleoprotein complex with chromatin-remodeling proteins,
kinases, and other transcription factors [10]. Recent single
cell fluorescence imaging experiments have shown that
TNF can induce two distinct modes of NF-κB activation
patterns [11]. In the monophasic mode, the result of a
brief TNF stimulation, NF-κB enters the nucleus and
induces the expression of IκB inhibitory proteins whose
resynthesis redistributes NF-κB back into the cytoplasm,
restoring cellular homeostasis [12,13]. Conversely, oscillatory NF-κB activation, a result of tonic TNF stimulation
produces prolonged IKK activation and continued IκB
proteolysis, results in repeated rounds of NF-κB translocation and cytoplasmic recapture [11]. This latter activation
profile is characterized by a series of asynchronous,
damped oscillations of nuclear NF-κB [14]. These findings
explain the biphasic pattern of nuclear NF-κB binding that
has been observed in response to tonic TNF stimulation in
a number of distinct cell types [15,16], where the initial
oscillation is observed due to stimulus-induced syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/137

chrony in the cell population, but lost afterwards because
subsequent oscillations are asynchronous and appear
damped in the population [14]. Whether these two modes
of NF-κB activation produce distinct genetic programs has
not been systematically studied.
Although a body of isolated work has reported that NF-κB
controls expression of acute-phase reactants [17],
cytokines [18], anti-apoptotic proteins [19], and autoregulators of the IKK-NF-κB pathway [12,13,20], the full
spectrum of NF-κB-dependent genes are only beginning
to be systematically understood [21]. In this study, we
analyzed and validated a microarray time series experiment of cells expressing a regulated NF-κB dominant-negative inhibitor in response to TNF. From this data set, we
have previously systematically identified known and
novel NF-κB-dependent genes [21]. Because these represent a time series experiment, the data may contain genes
that are under direct or indirect NF-κB control. That these
"NF-κB-dependent" genes were directly controlled by NFκB was verified by satisfying a series of experimental validation experiments: 1. Ectopic expression of constitutively active NF-κB/Rel A transactivated the endogenous
"NF-κB-dependent" genes in the absence of TNF stimulation; 2. TNF induced the "NF-κB-dependent" genes in the
absence of new protein synthesis; 3. NF-κB sites were
computationally identified and confirmed by EMSA; and,
4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
showed the endogenous "NF-κB-dependent" promoters
bound NF-κB/Rel A in TNF stimulated cells [21]. Based on
these observations, we concluded that this was a robust
dataset containing genes directly under NF-κB control.
Here we performed a kinetic analysis of the time series
data set where, strikingly, four distinct kinetic groups were
identified by cluster analysis. Gene Ontology and Ingenuity pathway analysis show that these response groups
encode distinct biological functions from one another,
with the Early group being composed of families of
secreted cytokine/chemokines and the Late group being
composed of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules. Stimulation experiments producing monophasic or
oscillatory NF-κB activation modes show that the oscillatory mode is required for Late gene expression. These data
provide major new insights into the coordinated NF-κB
response program to inflammatory stimuli, where the cellular response is dictated by the mode in which NF-κB is
activated.

Results
We have previously isolated and characterized HeLatTA/
a clonal cell line expressing a tetracycline-regulated NF-κB dominant-negative inhibitor [21,22]. When
doxycycline (Dox) is present in tissue culture medium,
tTA is inactivated, and FLAG-IκBα Mut levels are barely

Schematic diagram of microarray data analysis. HeLaTetO-FLAGIκBα Mut cells were plated in parallel into cultures in the
absence or presence of Dox (2 µg/ml). After four days, cells
were stimulated without (0 h) or with rhTNFα (25 ng/ml) at
6 h, 3 h, and 1 h prior to simultaneous harvest for RNA
extraction. Experiments were conducted four independent
times. Data sets were scaled for comparison. NF-κB dependent genes were identified using 2-way ANOVA where Dox
treatment and TNF treatment were considered independent
variables. Those changed by Dox treatment at a p-values
[Pr(F)< 0.01] were then filtered for 3-fold change at any
point during the experiment (signal intensity with NF-κB vs
signal intensity without NF-κB).

detectable by Western immunoblot, resulting in a wild
type phenotype, with normal levels of activated NF-κB in
the nucleus being produced after stimulation [21,22].
Conversely, upon Dox withdrawal, tTA is activated, and
FLAG-IκBα Mut expression occurs at similar levels to
endogenous IκBα [22]. These levels of FLAG-IκBα Mut
expression are sufficient to completely inhibit NF-κB
translocation and target gene expression [21,22]. HeLatTA/
FLAG-IκBα Mut cells were plated in parallel cultures in the
absence or presence of Dox (2 µg/ml), and each group
stimulated tonically with TNFα to induce NF-κB activation in the oscillatory mode [11]. RNA was then subjected
to high density oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Reanalysis of the raw data set was performed using less stringent statistical filters to more fully identify the spectrum of
biological functions under NF-κB control, where we identified 74 probe sets (Figure 1). From these, the scaled signal intensities were subjected to hierarchical clustering to
identify coregulated genes, identifying 5 expression
groups based on their kinetics of expression (Figure 2a).
As an indicator of reproducibility, we noted that redundant probe sets generally clustered with one another,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/137

where multiple NF-κB2 and IL-8 probesets group together
(Figure 2a). These findings indicated that the clustering
analysis is robust, grouping probe sets representing the
same genes based on similar expression patterns. Further
inspection of the hierarchical clustering results indicates
that TNF induces expression of five distinct groups: 1.
"Early" genes whose expression profiles peak at 1 h and
less; 2. "Middle" genes whose expression profiles peak at
3 h, falling thereafter; 3. "Late" genes whose expression
profiles begin to peak at 6 h and later; 4. "Biphasic", genes
whose expression profiles peak rapidly at 1 h, fall at 3 h,
and peak again at 6 h; and, 5. "Paradoxical" genes whose
expression is not significantly altered by TNF in the wild
type cells, but whose expression are induced by TNF in the
cells lacking NF-κB signaling (Figure 2a). Further, NF-κB
dependence for these probe sets is seen by comparing the
heat map profiles for each probe set obtained in the presence of Dox vs the profile obtained in the absence of Dox
(Figure 2a). For example, the strong induction of gene
expression in "Middle" genes at 3 h in the presence of Dox
is not seen in the absence of Dox. Similar findings are
made for the probe sets in the "Early", "Late", and "Biphasic" genes.
To rigorously compare the expression profiles of the
major clusters, the scaled and normalized hybridization
intensities were retrieved for each gene and plotted by
group as a percentage of each gene's maximal expression
value during the time course (because of the limited
number of probe sets in the Biphasic group, these were
excluded from subsequent analysis). As seen in Figure 2b,
as a group, the Early genes had ~ 10 % maximal expression at time 0, and rapidly peaked at 100% maximal
expression by 1 h, falling to ~ 50 % expression at 3 h. The
Middle and Late groups tended to have higher basal
expression relative to their maximal induction. The genes
within the Late group were tightly synchronized showing
maximal expression at 6 h. As expected, the Paradoxical
group showed no significant induction by TNF in the presence of Dox, but their expression increased 2-fold in the
cells stimulated in its absence. As a test whether the TNFinduced profile grouping was statistically significant, the
paired two-tailed Z-Test statistic was calculated to determine whether these three expression groups came from
different populations during the TNF response [see Additional file 1]. We found that the P values for the two-tailed
test statistic for Early gene group is significantly different
than the profiles of the Middle or Late genes at all times of
TNF stimulation, indicating that they come from a distinct
population than the members of the Middle or Late genes.
Similarly, the expression profiles of the Middle genes are
different from the Late genes also at 1, 3, and 6 h of stimulation. Together this analysis indicated that the Early,
Middle and Late expression groups are separable populations with distinct gene expression patterns.

and black indicates Z > 0.5. Expression groups are indicated at right by vertical line. (b) Distinct Expression Profiles. The normalized SI measurements for each of the genes in Clusters I–IV are presented as a percentage of the maximum value for any

To validate the gene expression kinetics and confirm their
NF-κB dependence, Q-RT-PCR assays were developed for
representative members of the Early (IL-6, IL-8, TNFAIP3/
A20) and Late (NF-κB-2, Naf-1 and TRAF-1) genes. We
then used these assays to measure mRNA changes in tonic
TNFα-stimulated in HeLatTA/FLAG-IκBα Mut cells cultured in
the absence or presence of Dox. A rapid induction of
mRNA transcripts was observed within 1 h for the selected
Early genes (Figure 3a). Here, IL-6 mRNA abundance
peaked at 48 -fold within 0.5 h, whereas IL-8 and
TNFAIP3/A20 peaked at 900-fold and 125-fold at 1 h,
respectively. All mRNA signals then rapidly fell to < 30%
of the maximal signal at 3 h of stimulation (Figure 3a). In
addition, in the HeLatTA/FLAG-IκBα Mut cells cultured in the
absence of Dox, mRNA expression for all of these genes
were significantly inhibited, with IL-6 being induced no
more than 5- fold, and no detectable induction was seen
for IL-8 and TNFAIP3/A20 (Figure 3a). In contrast, mRNA
transcript abundance for the Late gene group peaked 6 h
after TNFα stimulation, with the exception of Naf-1,
whose mRNA abundance continued to increase until 9 h

(Figure 3b). Like the Early genes, TNFα-induced expression of the Late genes was also significantly inhibited in
cells cultured in the absence of Dox.
We next asked whether TNF-induced specific NF-κB subunit binding to endogenous target genes. For this purpose,
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed on representative members of the Early (IL-8, IL6) and Late (Naf-1, NF-κB2) genes. In this assay, control
or TNF-stimulated cells are exposed to protein-DNA crosslinking reagents to covalently stabilize the chromatin. The
soluble chromatin is then extracted, sheared, and the target protein specifically immuno-precipitated (along with
its associated DNA). After elution of the DNA, the
crosslinks are reversed, and the presence of specific genes
detected by PCR. As seen in Figure 3c, TNFα treatment
strongly induced NF-κB/RelA subunit binding the IL-8
gene. By contrast, TNF induced only weak c-Rel binding to
IL-8. For the DNA binding subunits, although NF-κB1
binding is detectable on IL-8 in the absence of stimulation
(compare signal in absence of TNF vs that produced by

IgG, Figure 3c), its levels increase in response to TNF treatment. By contrast, no NF-κB2 binding is detectable either
in the presence or absence of TNF stimulation. Very similar patterns of NF-κB subunit binding are seen by ChIP
assay of the IL-6 gene (Figure 3c, right panel). In Figure 3d,
basal- and TNF-induced binding of the same NF-κB subunits is shown for two representative members of the Late
genes. Like the early genes, TNF induces RelA and to a
lesser extent, c-Rel, and NF-κB1 binding to both the Naf1 and NF-κB2 genes (Figure 3d). In contrast, constitutive
NF-κB2 binding is seen for both promoters. Because of
differences in PCR efficiencies, it is not possible to determine whether NF-κB2 subunits are binding more or less
strongly to the Late gene promoters than the Early genes.
These findings indicate that the selected Early and Late
genes directly and inducibly bind NF-κB/RelA, c-Rel, and
NF-κB1 DNA binding subunits in an apparently similar
pattern. Taken together, these studies validate the microarray profiles, confirm the relative cascades of gene expression, demonstrate their absolute dependence on intact
NF-κB signaling, and indicate the Early and Late members
show similar binding affinities for the transactivating NFκB family subunits.
To determine the functional activities of the various NFκB dependent groups, the individual probe sets in each
expression profile genes were mapped to their primary
Gene Ontology Biological Process and Molecular Function. Statistical analysis was performed on functional categories over-represented in the groups relative to the
functional representation within the human proteome
(Table 1, ref. [23]). For example, Cytokine Activity was
significantly enriched in the Early dataset, representing 32
% of the genes, whereas peptide transporter and protein
binding activity was enriched in the Late dataset, representing 12- and 31 % of the genes, respectively (Table 1).
To more clearly display this functional difference, the 74
NF-κB-dependent genes were annotated by primary biochemical function and kinetic grouping (Table 2). From
this analysis, it is clear that the NF-κB-dependent genes
control a variety of cellular processes, including antiapoptosis, cytokine signaling, growth factors and secreted
proteins, metabolism, receptors and cell-surface adhesion
molecules, signaling molecules, transcription factors and
those with currently unknown function. Here, our analysis reveals that groups of genes controlling distinct cellular
functions are sequentially expressed during the evolution
of the TNF response. For example, the Early gene group is
predominantly composed of secreted cytokines, including
IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-1 through- 3, TNF and CCL20/Exodus-1
(Table 2). Conversely, the Late gene group encodes cellsurface adhesion molecules (ICAM, KLRC2), signaling
adapter molecules (TRAF1/3), and NF-κB2. The Middle
group functionally overlaps with those of the Late genes in
that they control expression of cell-surface receptors, sign-

aling molecules, autoregulators of the IKK-NF-κB pathway
and metabolic enzymes. To avoid the potential problem
of bias inherent in expert classification, we employed
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). IPA compares groups
of genes from each expression profile to an annotated
database generated from published protein and genetic
networks and displays a rank-ordered list of pathways
whose function is most likely to be affected by that expression pattern. For each pathway, its members and their
relationships (functional and physical) are displayed.
Consistently, the highest scoring IPA pathway for Early
gene group was an NF-κB-dependent pathway controlling
production of extracellular cytokines (Figure 4a). Similarly, although the highest scoring pathway for Late gene
group was also an NF-κB-dependent pathway, the major
targets of this pathway are extracellular adhesion proteins
(Figure 4b). Together, our data suggests that NF-κB controls waves of sequential expression of functionally distinct genes.
To determine whether the NF-κB-dependent gene expression cascades produced by TNFα are observed with other
NF-κB activating stimuli, we stimulated HeLatTA/FLAG-IκBα
Mut with IL-1α. IL-1α shares the ability to rapidly activate
the IKK- NF-κB pathway with indistinguishable kinetics
[20]. The mRNA expression profiles displayed as a heat
map shows four expression profiles (Figure 5). IL-8,
TNFAIP3/A20 and IL-6 (Early genes in response to TNF)
were also rapidly induced by IL-1, peaking 1 h after
stimulation. The genes encoding Naf-1, PTGES and
PSMB9 (Late genes in TNF response) peaked 9 h after IL1 stimulation. NF-κB1, and NF-κB2 constituted a Middle
expression group. Together we conclude that similar temporal expression programs and NF-κB-dependence are
seen in response to IL-1 signaling for members of the
Early- and Late NF-κB-dependent genes. To partially
address whether these expression profiles could be
observed in other cell types, a time course experiment of
TNFα – stimulated MRC-5 fibroblasts was analyzed for
changes in a representative member of the Early gene
group (IL-8) and a member of the Late gene group (Naf1) by Northern blot analysis. As seen in Figure 5b, IL-8 is
induced with an apparent plateau 2 h after TNF stimulation. Conversely, Naf-1 expression is not detectably
induced at 2 h, but rather begins to increase after 3 h of
stimulation, apparently reaching a plateau 6 h and later
after stimulation. These findings suggest that these waves
of genomic NF-κB responses can be observed in other cell
types.
The promoters of the Early and Late response groups were
subjected to bioinformatics analysis, to determine
whether the kinetics of NF-κB-inducible transcription was
a function of the location or number of high-affinity NFκB-binding sites [24]. Within 1000 bp of the transcription

start site, between 1 to 6 high-affinity NF-κB-binding sites
were found in both expression groups [see Additional files
2, 3]; when subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering, neither the location or number of NF-κB-binding
sites was apparently predictive of target gene expression
pattern (Figure 6a). For example, Naf-1, a Late gene, coclustered with A20, an Early gene (Figure 6a). Both promoters had >5 putative high-affinity NF-κB DNA-binding
sites in their promoters. To initially address the possibility
that the combinatorial context in which the NF-κB site
was located may determine its pattern of response, we
examined whether AP-1 binding sites were enriched in the
Early gene promoters. For example, previous promoter
analyses from our lab have shown that the presence of AP-

1 binding site affects the magnitude of IL-8 gene induction in response to TNFα [25]. The location of putative
high-affinity AP-1 binding sites in relationship to the NFκB binding sites are shown in Figure 6b. Although AP-1
binding sites are frequent in the promoters analyzed, with
31 sites found in the 26 promoters analyzed, the frequency of those containing AP-1 was not different
between the expression groups. Here, 10 of 13 Early gene
promoters contained at least one AP-1 site, and exactly the
same number of Late gene promoters (10/13) contained
them.
However, when the location of NF-κB-binding sites
located within phylogenetically conserved domains was

considered, striking differences between the two groups
emerged. For the Early genes, promoter alignments
between human and mouse genes showed that the NF-κBbinding sites were highly conserved, where the A10,
CXCL-1, CCL-20, IκBα, IL-6, IRF-1 and TNF genes contained NF-κB-binding sites, representing 7 of the 9 genes
amenable for analysis (Figure 7a). Conversely, for the Late
genes, only CYB5 and ICAM-1 had NF-κB-binding sites
within phylogenetically conserved domains, representing
only 2 of the 9 genes (Figure 7b). Together, these data
indicate that the Early gene promoters may be under selective conservation pressure to contain NF-κB-binding sites,
whereas the Late gene promoters may not be. To further
explore the question of co-occurrence of AP-1-binding
sites, the frequency of AP-1 sites in phylogenetically conserved domains was also examined. As seen by the green
asterixes in Figure 7a, only two phylogenetically conserved domains in Early genes contained high-affinity AP1-binding sites. More work will be required to understand
the biological significance of these apparent differences in
binding patterns between the two groups.

TNF can induce two distinct modes of NF-κB activation
patterns- a single, synchronized "monophasic" NF-κB
translocation vs a series of damped, desynchronized
oscillations ("oscillatory") whose differential effects on
cellular genetic response has not been explored [11,14].
Pulse TNF stimulation rapidly activates IKK briefly over 5–
15 min, after which the kinase inactivates, thereby allowing newly resynthesized IκBα to recapture activated NF-κB
and return it to its inactivated cytoplasmic form. Conversely, tonic TNF stimulation produces a low level of persistent IKK activity. This persistent IKK activity produces
continuous IκBα proteolysis and NF-κB binding [14]. To
illustrate, the DNA binding profiles of "pulse" TNFα stimulation (15 min, Figure 8a) were then compared with
"tonic" TNFα stimulation. Over the first 1 h, NF-κB DNA
binding activity in EMSA was indistinguishable between
the "tonic" and "pulse" TNF stimulation (Figure 8b).
However, after 3 h, NF-κB activated by pulse TNF stimulation is no longer detectable in the nucleus, being relocated
into the cytoplasm, whereas tonic TNF stimulation produced a low level of NF-κB binding (Figure 8b; compare

3- and 6 h Tonic vs Pulse stimulated cells). Although high
resolution single-cell fluorescence microscopy indicates
this is due to a series of dampened oscillations, the
oscillations have desynchronous cycle times and presents
as an apparently tonic binding pattern in the homogenated cell population (Figure 8b). As expected, cytoplasmic IκBα is rapidly reduced within 30 min in cells
subjected to either pulse or tonic stimulation, but only
those subjected to tonic treatment show persistent IκB
proteolysis (see Western blot in Figure 8c), producing an
oscillatory NF-κB translocation profile (compare with Figure 8b). Using these two stimulation modes, we tested
their effect on the Early and Late gene expression profiles

by Q-RT-PCR. For the Early genes, we found that the
expression patterns for IL-8 and TNFAIP3/A20 gene
expression were quite similar (Figure 8d). Surprisingly, IL6 response to pulse stimulation was much greater than
that of identically cultured cells that were tonically TNF
stimulated (Figure 8d). Cells in the pulse-treated plates
are washed in PBS to remove the TNFα ligand after the 15
min exposure time. It may be possible that a secreted
TNFα-inducible inhibitor of IL-6 expression (such as an
arachidonic acid metabolite) is removed during this
processing, accounting for the enhanced IL-6 expression.
Nevertheless, and in marked contrast, Late gene expression patterns were significantly reduced in response to

pulse stimulation. Tonic TNF stimulation produced a 12fold induction of NF-κB2 and 120-fold induction of Naf1 mRNAs, whereas the pulse stimulation produced less
than 2-fold mRNA induction for either gene (Figure 8e).
Also, the Early expression of TRAF-1 (15 fold at 1 h) was
similar for both treatment conditions; however at later
times, TRAF-1 expression returned to unstimulated values. Together these data indicate that expression of the
Late genes are dependent on tonic stimulation producing
continuous oscillatory NF-κB activity, and suggest that the
Late genes are recruited into activated expression modes
by time-dependent NF-κB exposure.

Discussion
TNFα is a potent inflammatory and immunomodulatory
cytokine expressed by macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T-cells and natural killer (NK)-cells following
stimulation by bacterial endotoxin. Upon binding to
high-affinity cell surface receptors, TNFα activates the

expression of secondary cytokine cascades and adhesion
molecules that, in turn, play important roles in tissue
inflammation by coordinating leukocyte activation,
chemotaxis and cell death [1,2,26,27]. The intracellular
signaling pathways in response to TNF are well understood. Ligation of TNFRI induces protein recruitment to
its cytoplasmic death domains, assembling a submembranous signaling complex composed of TRADD, FADD,
TRAF2 and other proteins. These, in turn, activate two
divergent intracellular signals, the JNK-AP-1 and the IKKNF-κB pathways responsible for producing homeostatic
genomic responses. Although the IKK-NF-κB pathway is
critical for inducing tissue inflammation and preventing
TNF-induced programmed cell death, surprisingly little is
known about its downstream gene targets and their kinetics of induction. In this study, we have systematically
analyzed the kinetics of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Our findings suggest that NF-κB controls distinct
groups of target genes whose pattern of expression appear

are harvested for gel shift (Figure 8b) or Q-RT-PCR (Figures 8c, d). (b) NF-κB-binding in tonic- vs pulse-stimulated cells.

to be an orchestrated cascade of Early, Middle and Late
target gene responses. These kinetically separable waves of
NF-κB-dependent gene expression control distinct biochemical processes, with the Early gene group primarily
encoding for cytokines that mediate TNF's ability to
amplify local cytokine cascades in inflamed tissue. Moreover, we find the orchestration of distinct temporal gene
expression cascades is a general feature of cytokineinduced NF-κB activation, being also observed in
response to stimulation with IL-1. Undoubtedly cell typespecific influences may affect the precise timing of expression and composition of the kinetic groups that we have
identified here for epithelial cells, we nevertheless find
similar distinct temporal profiles of representative member of the Early and Late gene groups in unrelated human
MRC-5 fibroblasts. Finally, our study identifies differences
in gene expression depending on NF-κB activation modes
that affect target genes within non-phylogenetically conserved regulatory domains. These findings shed important
new insights into the genetic responses to cytokine action.
The Early genes are enriched in cytokines and regulatory
components of the IKK-NF-κB pathway as analyzed by
Gene Ontology, Ingenuity pathway analysis, and expert
classification. An important biological property of TNF is
to initiate the cytokine cascade in target cells, where the
expression of secondary (downstream) cytokines are produced, each with their own distinct biological properties
[1,27]. In this manner, TNF amplifies the inflammatory
process. We find that a major part of the Early gene group
is the CXC chemokine family. CXC chemokines are the
numerically largest of the chemokine families, responsible for inducing migration of neutrophilic leukocytes,
stimulating wound healing, initiating angiogenesis and
promoting tumorigenesis [28]. In addition, a CC chemokine, CCL-20, is responsible for stimulating monocytes and
dendritic cells [29]. Another Early gene, the cytokine IL-6,
induces B cell differentiation and is a major mediator of
the hepatic acute phase reaction. Therefore, TNF stimulation of epithelial cells rapidly induces secondary cytokine
cascades that control leukocyte trafficking, wound healing, angiogenesis, and systemic inflammation. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the Early gene promoters
contain NF-κB-binding sites in evolutionarily conserved
regions between human and mouse, perhaps suggesting
existence of selection pressure for this rapid TNF response.
Moreover, since chemokine activity is produced as a
major portion for the most rapidly expressed genes, the
primary responses of the TNF-stimulated epithelium
appear to be the paracrine propogation of the inflammatory response, with the induction of homeostatic factors a
secondary priority for the cell.
The other important members of the Early genes encode
intracellular regulatory molecules involved in inhibition

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/137

of the IKK-NF-κB pathway itself. The NF-κB pathway is
tightly controlled by negative feedback loops at multiple
steps in its signaling pathway [14,30]. One level of
feedback inhibition involves the inactivation of nuclear
NF-κB and return to its cytoplasmic localization, a process
termed the NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory loop [13,15]. In this
loop, activated NF-κB produces enhanced expression of
IκBα mRNA. IκBα protein is then replenished to bind and
inactivate NF-κB/Rel A, returning it back into to the
cytoplasm to restore homeostasis. At a second level, activated NF-κB induces inhibitors of the activated IKK complex. This inhibition is mediated by the TNFAIP3/A20
protein, a ubiquitin ligase that associates with RIP and
mediates its proteasomal degradation [31], resulting in
inhibition of IKK signal [14,31-34]]. Together, these
observations indicate that an additional effect of the Early
NF-κB response is to terminate the TNFR-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway at several levels whose effect is to restore
cellular homeostasis.
Conversely, the Late gene group encodes adhesion molecules (ICAM, KLRC2), MHC I antigen processing/presentation (TAP, TAPBP). These molecules play important
roles in cytotoxic T cell mediated cytolysis. The finding
that tonic TNF stimulation is required for adhesion molecule expression and MHC I antigen presentation suggests
that tonically TNF stimulated cells, such as those produced in the context of persistent infection, would be targeted for enhanced immune recognition and clearance.
Also in this group, the TRAF signal adapter molecules couple TNF receptors to intracellular responses. TRAF1 is distinct from other TRAF isoforms in that it apparently serves
to protect cells from apoptosis and plays a role in the negative feedback regulation of receptor signaling [35]. Similarly TRAF3 has inhibitory functions to those of TRAF 2/6
in TNF induced NF-κB activation [35]. In this regard,
TRAF-1 and 3 dependence on tonic TNF stimulation suggests a mechanism how the cell attempts to restore homeostasis in the presence of a strong pro-apoptotic stimulus
by additional down- regulation of the TNFR-IKK signaling
pathway. Our new findings that Late gene expression is
dependent on tonic TNF stimulation is mechanistically
significant because it means that TNF may produce distinct phenotypic responses depending on the stimulus
duration.
Although the mechanisms underlying the different patterns of Early and Late gene expression control were not
the focus of this study, several findings merits further discussion. Our preliminary analyses indicate that expression of both classes of genes is absolutely dependent on
NF-κB translocation, because expression of both groups is
completely blocked by overexpression of the nondegradable IκBα inhibitor (Figures 2, 3). Bioinformatic analysis
shows that both groups contain high-affinity NF-κB-bind-

Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:137

ing sites (Figures 6, 7), many of which have been experimentally verified [21,36]. Moreover, we show here that
members from both groups inducibly bind NF-κB within
their native chromatin environment (Figures 3c,d). Additionally, we previously showed that TNFα robustly
induces expression of three members of the Middle gene
group (IκBε, NF-κB1, and RelB), and three members of
the Late gene group (TRAF-1, NF-κB2, and Naf-1) in the
absence of new protein synthesis [21]. Protein synthesis
independence excludes paracrine factors mediating Late
gene expression in epithelial cells, unlike those seen in
other cell types [37]. Finally, we have previously shown
that expression of a constitutively active NF-κB/RelA
transactivator is sufficient to activate expression of representative Middle and Late genes, excluding a requirement
for other TNF-induced signaling pathways in expression
of these genes. Together, these data strongly argue that
TNFα – induced NF-κB binding to high-affinity DNAbinding sites in the Late gene promoters is necessary and
sufficient for their expression. NF-κB, therefore, is a direct
regulator of Late gene expression.
Recent studies suggesting that NF-κB binding occurs in
two distinct "waves" in LPS-stimulated macrophages [38]
raises the question whether Late gene expression could be
due to different rates of NF-κB recruitment. Unfortunately, our findings do not support this as a mechanism
controlling Late gene activation by NF-κB in epithelial
cells. For example, we have previously shown that the
kinetics of the potent transactivating NF-κB/RelA subunit
binding to the Late gene, Naf-1, is rapid and indistinguishable from that for the Early gene, IκBα [21]. It is still
possible that other Late genes not yet tested are bound by
RelA more slowly, but at least we can conclude that differences in rate of NF-κB binding cannot account for the late
pattern of Naf-1 expression. Alternatively, expression differences could be due to different compositions of NF-κB
subunit binding to the Early and Late gene promoters.
Although the ChIP assays presented in Figures 3c and 3d
show that the RelA, c-Rel and NF-κB1 subunits bind similarly to the Early and Late genes, NF-κB2 appeared to be
binding more strongly to the late genes. It therefore is possible that exchange of various transactivating subunits for
NF-κB2 may occur later in the time series, a possibility
that will require further investigation.
Another possible explanation for the different rates of
promoter activation may be through the environment in
which the NF-κB binding sites are located in the Early and
Late gene promoters. The rate of response of some NF-κB
dependent genes has been suggested to be modified by
adjacent transcription factor regulatory sites. In our previous studies of IL-8 gene expression, we found that the
magnitude of its TNF-induced transcriptional response is
partly dependent on an intact upstream AP-1 binding site

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/137

[25]. Although our preliminary bioinformatic analysis
does not indicate any differences in the frequency of coregulatory AP-1 binding sites between the two groups
(Figure 6b), other sites or combinations of sites may be
important. For example, a rapid transcriptional response
of the A20 gene has been suggested to be due to a "preassembled" pre-initiation complex that is nucleated by
the SP-1 transcription factor [39]. In this way, the A20
promoter is poised for rapid transcriptional induction
when NF-κB is activated. It will be interesting to compare
whether the Early genes are pre-loaded with TFIID or RNA
Polymerase by ChIP, and whether these patterns are different from the Late gene promoters. However, we note
from our previous genomic footprinting studies have
shown that TNF induces both NF-κB- and TFIID binding
simultaneously to the IL-8 promoter in epithelial cells
[18]. We therefore think SP-1 mediated promoter preloading is not likely to be a universal mechanism explaining Early gene expression.
Another possible explanation for the delay in Late gene
expression is that this group undergoes an additional ratelimiting step necessary for promoter activation after NFκB binding has occurred. This step is apparently dependent on a TNF stimulation protocol that induces oscillatory
NF-κB binding behavior. In a previous mathematical
treatment of this phenomenon at a single cell level, we
demonstrated that the Late gene expression profiles can be
simulated using a theoretical construct of two sequential
activator binding steps, the first one being NF-κB [40].
This second activator, yet to be experimentally identified,
could be chromatin modification, nucleosomal re-positioning, pre-initiation complex formation, or coactivator
recruitment (reviewed in [41-43]]). These possibilities
will require further experimentation.
Another conclusion from our study is that Early gene
expression is being actively terminated. Comparing the
microarray and Q-RT-PCR profiles with NF-κB binding
profiles show that IL-8 expression is falling to control levels 3 h after TNF stimulation, even though NF-κB binding
continues to be detectable at these times. Both EMSA (Figure 8) and ChIP assays show NF-kB binding is strongly at
these times (See Figure 7F in [21]). To our interpretation,
these findings indicate a repressive activity is being
recruited to the Early gene promoters during the evolution
of the TNF response, an activity or factor which has yet to
be experimentally identified [see also discussion in [40]].
Finally, we have not addressed regulation of the Paradoxical genes. These genes are not affected by TNF stimulation
in the presence of intact NF-κB signaling pathway (Figure
2), but are induced by its absence. One possibility is that
they represent a group of genes whose expression is tonically inhibited by basal NF-κB nucleo-cytoplasmic shut-

tling. This could be through a competition for ratelimiting, shared, coactivators. In the absence of NF-κB
translocation, these limiting coactivators are now able to
bind and activate expression of the Paradoxical genes.

Conclusion
This study is the first systematic dissection of the NF-κB
response profiles downstream of TNF. We have found evidence for temporal waves of NF-κB-dependent target
expression encoding distinct molecular functions. The
expression profiles are stimulus-independent, being
induced in the same coordinated cascades in response to
IL-1. Finally, we have identified a subnetwork of the NFκB response program whose expression is dependent on
its oscillatory mode of activation. This finding is significant in that it indicates distinct cellular phenotypes can be
produced depending on the duration of TNF stimulation.

Methods
Cell culture and treatment
HeLatTA/FLAG-IκBα Mut, Tet-transactivator (tTA)-expressing
HeLa cells stably transfected with a Tet Operator controlled non-degradable IκBα (IκBα Ser32Ala/Ser36Ala) plasmid, were cultured as described [22]. For pulse TNF
stimulation, cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml recombinant
TNFα for 15 min, and rapidly washed 3 times with PBS
before returning to culture medium. For tonic stimulation, 25 ng/ml TNF was added to the culture medium and
left for indicated times prior to harvest.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/137

RNA isolated from control (0 h), 1, 3 and 6 h TNF stimulated HeLatTA/FLAG-IκBα Mut cells in the presence or absence
of Doxycyline (2 µg/ml). For comparison of the fluorescent intensity (Signal Intensity) values among multiple
experiments, the Signal Intensity (SI) values for each
"experimental" GeneChip were scaled to that of the
"base" GeneChip and subjected to a 2 way analysis of variance with replications (ANOVA, Splus 6, Insightful Inc.).
As seen in Figure 1 (supplementary information), 343
probe sets were changed by Dox treatment a p value
[Pr(F)] of < 0.01. The probe sets were then filtered to identify any that showed a 3-fold difference in SI at any time
during the TNF treatment (SI with NF-κB vs SI without NFκB), identifying 74 probe sets being under NF-κB control.
Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was performed
using the Weighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic
mean (WPGMA, Spotfire Array Explorer, v. 8, Spotfire
Inc., Cambridge MA) using Euclidian Distance. The
primary data has been deposited with GEO or can be
found at our website [44].
Functional annotation mapping was performed using the
NIAID DAVID database [23,45]). Pathways Analysis was
performed using individual clusters as input into the Ingenuity Knowledge Base database [46]. NF-κB-dependent
human promoters were obtained from the Human
Genome Browser gateway using the Human May 2004
(hg17) assembly (UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site,
[47]. NF-κB-binding sequences were identified by TRANSFAC 4.2 filtering matrix scores by minimizing the sum the
false positive and negative error rates. Human and mouse
promoters were aligned using the VISTA genome browser
2.0 [48,49].

RNA analysis
Twenty micrograms acid guanidium-phenol extracted
RNA was analyzed by Northern blot as previously
described [21]. The washed membrane was exposed to a
Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager cassette for quantitation. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (Q- RT-PCR) assays used commercially available primer and probe sequences (ABI, P/N
4331182). For TNFAIP3/A20, the probe sequence was 5'CAATTGCCG TCACCGTTC-3'; the forward primer was 5'AGCTTGTGGC GCTGAAAAC-3', and reverse primer was
5'-ACTGAGAAGTG GCATGCATGAG-3'. The cycling
parameters for one-step RT-PCR were: reverse transcription 48°C for 30 min, AmpliTaq activation 95°C for 10
min, denaturation 95°C for 15 s, and annealing/extension 60°C for 1 min (repeat 40 times) on an ABI7000
thermocycler. Duplicate CT values were analysed using
comparative CT(∆∆ CT) method. The amount of target (2
-∆∆CT) was obtained by normalizing to an endogenous
reference (18S RNA) and relative to a calibrator (one
experimental sample).

Protein extraction and analysis
Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were fractionated as
previously described [21]. 15 µg of nuclear extracts (NE)
were subjected to Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
(EMSA) using the high-affinity NF-κB-binding site [22].
The complexes were fractionated on 6 % native polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at
70°C. For Western blot, equal amounts of cytoplasmic
protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membrane. The membranes were incubated with
affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IκBα
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Washed membranes were
then incubated with IRDye 800 labeled anti-rabbit IgG
antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville,
PA), and immune complexes quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE.).

Oligonucleotide array data analysis
Four independent Hu95Av2 GeneChip (Affymetrix Inc,
Santa Clara, CA) hybrdiziations were performed using

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
The ChIP assay was as described [21]. On the day prior to
experiment, 2–4 × 106 cells were plated in 0.5 % BSA con-

taining growth medium. Cells were stimulated for indicated times, and sequentially crosslinked with
disuccinimidyl glutarate and 1 % formaldehyde in serumfree medium for 15 min at 37°C. The cells were washed,
transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and solubilized in 400 ml
of SDS Lysis Buffer (1% SDS 10 mM Tris, ph 8.0, 1 mM
EDTA) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich).
The samples were sonicated 3 times, 15 sec at setting 2
until DNA fragments were 300–400 bp or less. Equal
amounts of DNA were immunoprecipitated overnight at
4°C in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM NaCl, 1 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL-630, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT) with
20 µg of indicated NF-κB subunit specific antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotech) or IgG as indicated. Immunoprecipitates
were collected with protein-A magnetic beads (Dynal,
Inc), and washed sequentially with ChIP dilution buffer,
high salt buffer, LiCl buffer and TE buffer (10 mM Tris, ph
8.0, 1 mM EDTA). DNA was eluted in 1 ml of Elution
Buffer 1 % SDS in 0.1 M NaHCO3). Samples were decrosslinked in 200 mM NaCl at 65°C, 1 h. DNA was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated and used for PCR. PCR
primers and conditions for semiquantiative PCR are in
[21]. PCR products were fractionated by agarose gel chromatography and stained with ethidium bromide.
