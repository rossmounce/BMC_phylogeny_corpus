New genomes, new taxa and deep questions in
the eukaryotic tree of life: a meeting report on
the EMBO comparative genomics conference
Alex de Mendoza1,2 and Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo1,2,3*

Abstract
A report on the meeting Comparative Genomics of Eukaryotic Microorganisms: understanding the complexity of
diversity. Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Spain. October 15-20, 2011.
’We scientists are like the lovers in 1950s films, absolutely insatiable. After one genome will come another,
and another, and we will not stop until we have
sequenced all of them’ said microbiologist Antonio Lazcano more than a decade ago. The truth is that this
year’s EMBO conference series on the Comparative
Genomics of Eukaryotic Microorganisms has proven
Lazcano to be somehow right. Importantly, however,
these new genomes are giving us useful insights into
eukaryotic diversity, biology and evolution. Even more
importantly, thanks to high-throughput sequencing
technologies the cost of sequencing is rapidly dropping
providing researchers with the opportunity not only to
analyze hundreds of genomes but to obtain the first
genome data from previously neglected eukaryotic taxa.
Below we report some of the highlights of the meeting
that both emphasize this trend and are potentially relevant to the readers of EvoDevo.

Fungi, subtelomeric regions and experimental
evolution
It is clear that there exists a huge bias in genomic sampling efforts across the diversity of the eukaryotic tree.
For example, the Opisthokonta, the clade that includes
Fungi and Metazoa, continues to be by far the most
well-sampled eukaryotic superclade, whereas genomic
data on Excavata and Rhizaria remain scarce. In this
meeting more than half of the presentations concerned
the analysis of genomes and/or transcriptomes of Fungi,

which is not surprising given that more than 200 fungal
genomes have been sequenced to date. Such comprehensive genome sampling enables studies at the level of
population genomics, some of which are providing
important insights into the subtelomeric regions. It is
becoming widely accepted that subtelomeric genes show
increased rates of duplication and undergo frequent
ectopic recombination without the need for meiosis.
Thus, these subtelomeric regions may play important
roles in the origin of evolutionary innovation and, specifically, in the generation of genetic diversity. Good
examples of this, presented by Kevin Verstrepen (VIB
Laboratory for Systems Biology, Belgium), are the yeast
MAL genes that show interesting patterns of subfunctionalitzation of the resulting duplicates. Another good
example is the evolution of variant surface glycoprotein
(VSG) genes, which produce an important surface glycoprotein, in the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei (Lindsey Plenderleith, University of Glasgow, UK).
Moreover, Patrick Keeling (University of British Columbia, Canada) presented comparative genomic analyses of
several species of microsporidians, as well as three different strains of Encephalitozoon. Microsporidians have
among the smallest eukaryotic genomes as a result of
their adaptation to intracellular parasitism. Keeling’s
analysis revealed higher variation in subtelomeric
regions than in the rest of the genome, and a high
degree of conservation in synteny and intergenic
regions.
Another good reason to study fungi relates to the
interesting field of experimental evolution. Sophisticated
molecular biology techniques and extensive genomic
sampling enables experiments to be conducted across

hundreds of generations in lab conditions. Bernard
Dujon (Institute Pasteur, France) presented an interesting series of evolutionary experiments designed to unravel how adaptation works. He reported that they had
introduced a metabolic gene from Yarrowia lipolytica
inside Saccharomyces cerevisiae, causing a severely unfit
phenotype. They subsequently grew this strain for hundreds of generations in non-limiting media, eventually
observing an increase in fitness. By genomic re-sequencing they discovered that the insert had been amplified
by multiple episomes, which were later re-introduced in
tandem repeats inside the genome, allowing an increase
in sequence changes. Finally, Jure Piskur (Lund University, Sweden) presented a case of parallel evolution in
yeast, in which two distantly related lineages had
evolved a convergent lifestyle by re-wiring cis-regulatory
motifs of the same metabolic pathway.

Horizontal gene transfer
A remarkable example of the role that horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) plays in eukaryotic evolution was presented by Tom Richards (Natural History Museum London, UK). His group analyzed the role of HGT in the
evolution of the osmotrophic lifestyle. Their genomewide analysis revealed at least 34 HGT events from
Fungi to the oomycote Phytophtora infestants, which
shares a very similar lifestyle with fungi. More importantly, the bulk of transferred genes are involved in the
processes of osmotrophy and plant parasitic mechanisms
(specifically plant cell breakdown, sugar scavenging, and
plant cell effector proteins) suggesting that HGT played
a significant role in the convergent evolution towards
the osmotrophic capacity of the oomycetes. Interestingly, following the same pipeline they were only able to
infer nine ancient transfers between fungi and plants.
Whole genome duplications
Another important subject that arose during the conference was the importance of whole genome duplications
(WGD) in eukaryotes. Some examples, besides plants
and vertebrates, are the Saccharomycotina, in which
WGD was followed by a rapid loss of duplicates, or the
ancestral duplication of Zigomycota, in which Rhizopus
suffered a third round of WGD. Analyses of the
dynamics of paralog retention and synteny loss shed
some light both on sex-chromosome evolution and sensory perception (Luis M. Corrochano, Universidad de
Sevilla, Spain; and Ken Wolfe, Trinity College, Ireland).
Tree of life (TOL)
The tree of life and the efforts to obtain a well-supported tree of eukaryotes was one of the main topics of
the conference with four consecutive sessions. Toni
Gabaldón (Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona)

presented a promising automatic method of iterative
and nested phylogenetic reconstruction, in which after
every node a new dataset of shared genes is re-calculated allowing a scalable resolution at more recent
nodes (the tips). The deeper nodes of eukaryotes, however, remain problematic and unsupported. The pipeline
allows continuous update as more data become available, so it remains to be seen whether trimming unnecessary taxa and incorporating new genomes from basal
nodes will provide better-supported trees. A different
strategy was proposed by Céline Brochier-Armanet
(Université de Provence, France), who suggested constructing phylogenies with concatenated datasets of
operational rather than informational genes. Although
operational genes have been considered unsuitable for
phylogenies given that they evolve faster, BrochierArmanet showed a well-supported eukaryote tree
inferred using concatenated genes from the midbody
toolkit. In her tree, deeper eukaryotic nodes had better
resolution than in trees reconstructed from published
datasets that are based on informational genes (that is,
ribosomal genes). A study to unravel the root of eukaryotes was presented by Ding He (Uppsala University).
He showed how they had used a concatenated dataset of
40 nuclear-encoded proteins of bacterial origin (euBacs),
mainly of mitochondrial origin, to reconstruct the tree
of eukaryotes. The use of euBacs allowed the tree to be
rooted using alpha-proteobacteria as an out-group. The
topology showed that Discoba (a group of excavates that
comprises Heterolobosea, Jakobids and Euglenozoa) is
the sister-group to the remaining eukaryotes. Then
Andrew J. Roger (Dalhousie University, Canada) nicely
introduced us to the long-standing problem of long
branch attraction as well as other systematic errors and
the possible solutions for overcoming them. He emphasized the use of improved phylogenetic models and
improved taxonomic sampling. For example, he showed
how the addition of several slowly evolving excavates
radically changed the topology on the deeper nodes of
the eukaryotic tree. For this reason it was good to learn
of the first jakobid (Andalucia godoyi) to be fully
sequenced, by Marek Elias (University of Ostrava, Czech
Republic). This is particularly important if Discoba really
are the most basal eukaryotic group. Elias presented a
very compelling argument for why it is worth sequencing previously neglected taxa such as Andalucia or
other jakobids. Within this same clade (Discoba), Lillian
Fritz-Laylin (University of California, US) showed how
the genome of Naegleria gruberi has changed our views
of the last common ancestor of Eukaryotes and presented promising results on the development of molecular techniques for this organism.
Two talks discussed work on diatoms, which are ecologically relevant microorganisms. Andrew Allen (J.

Craig Venter Institute, US) reported the presence of
genes involved in the urea cycle in the genomes of both
Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. These genes had previously been found only in
metazoans and prokaryotes. Chris Bowler (Institut de
Biologie de l’Ecole normale supériere, France) presented
the epigenomic map of DNA methylation in the diatom
P. tricornutum. Bowler reported a set of convincing
experiments that clearly show that methylation is found
preferentially on transposable elements, such that these
are silenced by default. Transposable elements are later
unsilenced allowing an increase in evolutionary rates,
when the organism faces stressful conditions.

Mitochondrial genomes and metagenomics
Two successful symposiums dealt with mitochondrial
genomes and metagenomics. In the first one, Gertraud
Burger (University of Montreal, Canada) and Michael
W. Gray (Dalhousie University, Canada) presented
examples of degenerate mitochondrial genomes among
diplonemids and euglenids. The mitochondrial genomes
of diplonemids demonstrate an extremely complex
behavior, with all genes being partitioned among hundreds of small chromosomes. These fragments are transcribed and trans-spliced, as well as heavily edited,
making the adaptive value of this process a big mystery.
All this seems to be led by some kind of ‘guiding
RNAs’, the nature of which has been investigated in a
series by Burger.
It is probably the field of metagenomics that best
emphasizes the role that high-throughput sequencing
technologies are playing in shaping this, as well as other,
disciplines. Patrick Wincker (Genoscope, France) gave
an overview of the ambitious Tara Oceans project, the
goal of which is to explore global ocean biodiversity and
ecosystems with the use of high-throughput sequencing,
imaging methods and modeling tools. A recurrent technical issue throughout the talk was the importance of
the single-celled amplified genomes in order to better
understand the main players of marine ecological environments. Finally, Alexandra Z. Worden (Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, US) focused on eukaryotic
phytoplankton, pinpointing the importance of linking
organism and gene function in order to increase our
current understanding of marine ecosystems.
Given the enormous amount of genomic data that is
currently being generated, Lazcano’s statement certainly
bears some truth. However, one wonders whether in the
future, and with the limits of data processing, we will
have to think carefully about which organisms it will be
worth obtaining the genome from. Nevertheless, we
should enjoy and celebrate the power that technology is
providing us to understand the diversity of eukaryotes
in unforeseen ways.
