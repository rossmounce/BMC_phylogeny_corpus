Abstract
Background: The entomopathogenic anamorphic fungus Metarhizum anisopliae is currently used
as a biocontrol agent (BCA) of insects. In the present work, we analyzed the sequence data
obtained from group I introns in the large subunit (LSU) of rDNA genes with a view to determining
the genetic diversity present in an autochthonous collection of twenty-six M. anisopliae isolates
selected as BCAs.
Results: DNA fragments corresponding to the 3'-end of the nuclear LSU rDNA genes of 26 M.
anisopliae isolates were amplified by PCR. The amplicon sizes ranged from 0.8 to 3.4-kb. Four intron
insertion sites, according to Escherichia coli J01695 numbering, were detected- Ec1921, Ec2066,
Ec2449 and Ec2563- after sequencing and analysis of the PCR products. The presence/absence of
introns allowed the 26 isolates to be distributed into seven genotypes. Nine of the isolates tested
showed no introns, 4 had only one, 3 two, and 10 displayed three introns. The most frequent
insertion sites were Ec1921 and Ec2449. Of the 26 isolates, 11 showed insertions at Ec2563 and a
1754-bp sequence was observed in ten of them. The most-parsimonious (MP) tree obtained from
parsimony analysis of the introns revealed a main set containing four-groups that corresponded to
the four insertion sites.
Conclusion: Four insertion sites of group I introns in the LSU rDNA genes allowed the
establishment of seven genotypes among the twenty-six biocontrol isolates of M. anisopliae. Intron
insertions at the Ec2563 site were observed for first time in this species.

Background
The use of entomopathogenic microorganisms to combat
insects is currently considered to be a viable supplement

or alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides, which are
known to have toxic effects on non-target organisms [1].
Strains of Metarhizium have been shown to efficiently con-

trol several insect species [2,3]. The most common species
is M. anisopliae, initially described as a pathogen of the
wheat cockchafer Anisoplia austriaca. This fungus is commonly known as "green muscardine fungus" [4] and can
infect the larvae and adults of more than 200 host species
[5,3]. Once M. anisopliae spores have come into contact
with the outer surface of the insect, they germinate. After
penetrating the insect exoskeleton, they rapidly grow
inside the insect and cause its death.
Traditionally, the classification and typing of anamorphic
entomopathogenic fungi have mainly been based on morphological characteristics [6]. Nevertheless, such tools are
insufficient for distinguishing between species of
Metarhizium [7] or for monitoring the establishment and
spread of a given strain released into the field, since these
characters are modified by environmental and physiological conditions [8].
The application of molecular techniques in mycology has
shed new light on the systematics, biochemistry, and ecology of entomopathogenic fungi [9]. Molecular markers
have been used to assess the genetic variation among isolates of M. anisopliae and other entomopathogenic fungi
in order to identify strains of interest, determine the origin
of the isolates, study populations, or carry out phylogenetic analyses. Thus, a useful polymorphism for fingerprinting M. anisopliae isolates was detected using
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mitochondrial (mt) DNA [10]. A high degree of polymorphism was also detected in coding regions of small
and large subunits of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (SSU
rDNA and LSU rDNA) as well as in intergenic spacers
(IGS), whereas the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were
extremely conserved among the M. anisopliae isolates
tested [11,12]. This rDNA polymorphism has been attributed to small insertions/deletions, multiple duplications,
or -mainly- to the presence of group I introns [11].
Group I introns are autonomous genetic elements characterized by their ability to "self-splice", or to splice due to
their particular topology. These introns are found in
eukaryotic and (eu)bacterial domains [13,14]. In entomopathogenic fungi, the first report of a group I intron
was described by Neuvéglise and Brygoo [15] for Beauveria
brongniartii. RFLP analysis of PCR products revealed the
presence of insertional elements of about 350–450 bp
within the LSU rDNA. Several authors have reported the
usefulness of group I introns, inserted after specific sites in
SSU or LSU rDNA genes for genotyping species and strains
in genera such as Beauveria or Cordyceps [16-20]. The presence of group I introns in M. anisopliae has been identified
at three different positions within the LSU rDNA
[11,12,17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/77

The present study was undertaken to determine any
genetic diversity existing in an autochthonous collection
of M. anisopliae isolates selected as biocontrol agents
against insects. Twenty-six biocontrol isolates, most of
them obtained from different locations in the Iberian
Peninsula, were examined, based on the analysis of
sequence data from group I introns in the LSU rDNA
genes. The usefulness of group I introns in LSU rDNA
genes for the characterization and identification of M. anisopliae strains was evaluated.

Results
Identification of group I introns
DNA fragments from LSU rDNA genes of 26 M. anisopliae
isolates (Table 1) were amplified with primers I29/E24.
The PCR products were purified and sequenced with a
view to identifying whether multiple insertion sequences
might be responsible for the length diversity in this
region. The intron-less LSU sequence size was 823 bp.
Sequence analysis revealed that nine isolates -designated
Ma4 Ma7, Ma13, Ma18, Ma19, Ma20, Ma23, Ma24 and
Ma25- had no introns. In the other seventeen isolates, the
presence of introns inserted at one or more of the four
possible conserved positions was observed. Intron insertion sites were refered to the I29 primer and located after
positions 73 (Ec1921), 217 (Ec2066), 625 (Ec2449) and
738 (Ec2563). These insertion sites were named according
to numbering of their nucleotide position in Escherichia
coli J01695. Inserted intron sequence sizes were 440-bp at
Ec1921; 343 bp at Ec2066; 409, 413, 414 or 417 bp at
Ec2449; and 435 or 1754 bp at Ec2563.

Among the 17 intron-containing isolates, ten of them
showed a length of 3.4-kb with three introns inserted at
positions Ec1921, Ec2449 and Ec2563. One isolate was
1674 bp in length, with two introns at positions Ec2449
and Ec2563. Another two were 1687 bp long, with two
introns at positions Ec1921 and Ec2449. Another isolate
was 1367 bp long, with an intron at position Ec2449.
Only one isolate, with an amplicon of 1173 bp long,
exhibited an intron at position Ec2066. Two isolates from
Cantabria (North Spain) were 1270 bp long, with one
intron at position Ec1921.
The presence/absence of introns at the 3'-end of the
nuclear LSU rDNA of the twenty-six M. anisopliae isolates
analyzed allowed a distribution into the following genotypes: A1B2A3A4, B1B2A3A4, A1B2A3B4, B1B2A3B4,
B1A2B3B4, A1B2B3B4 and B1B2B3B4. Letters A and B
indicate the presence and absence of introns, respectively,
and the insertion sites are numbered from 1 to 4; that is,
Ec1921 (1), Ec2066 (2), Ec2449 (3) and Ec2563 (4).
These genotypes and their distribution frequencies are
shown in Table 2. Nine (34.6%) out of the twenty-six
strains had no introns; four (15.4%) contained one; three

Ec1921, Ec2066, Ec2449 and Ec2563, respectively.

(11.5%) had two, and ten (38.5%) had three introns. The
most frequent insertion sites -53.8% of the isolates studied- occurred at nucleotide positions Ec1921 and Ec2449,
followed by position Ec2563 (42.3%), whereas only one
strain had an intron at Ec2066 (3.8%).
Intron characterization and variability
A 440-bp intron was identified in fourteen isolates at position Ec1921. Alignment of these sequences revealed the
existence of two variants with a few bp differences for this
intron. The divergences were due to nucleotide substitution at different positions. BLAST analysis of these
sequences revealed high sequence identity with an intron
inserted at the same position in the LSU from M. anisopliae
33 (97% and 98%, respectively; AF197122) [11] and with
another intron also inserted at the same position in the
LSU from M. anisopliae IMNST 9601 (96 and 95% identity; AF363479).

Isolate Ma17 from Seville was the only one of the twentysix isolates selected for study that showed evidence of an
intron, 343 bp long, at position Ec2066. This intron had
95 and 98 % identity with two sequences previously
detected at the same position in the LSU of M. anisopliae
isolates 11 and 33 (AF197121 and AF197123, respectively).
Fourteen isolates displayed one intron at position Ec2449.
Five sequence variants, ranging from 409 to 417 bp in
size, were identified at this site. These five sequences were
very similar and showed a 96–98 % identity with the
Ec2449-position intron sequence reported for M. anisopliae 33 (AF197124).
Two sequence types, very different in length, were
detected at position Ec2563 of eleven of the M. anisopliae
isolates. One of them was 1754-bp in size sequence and
was detected in ten of these isolates. A 161-bp fragment at
the 3' end of this sequence showed a BLASTn identity of
83% with a Cordyceps intron sequence from position 1398

to 1585 (AB044641). The rest of this 1754-bp sequence
did not show either BLASTn or BLASTx identity with any
of the genome sequences deposited in the public databases. An open reading frame (ORF) coding for 360
amino acids, located at position 49-1084-bp, was identified in this sequence. No homing endonuclease (HE)
motifs were detected. The second type was observed in
only one isolate, Ma12, corresponding to a 435-bp long
intron showing a sequence of 172-bp with a 84% of identity, from position 125 to 297, with the same intron
sequence of Cordyceps (AB044641).
In order to explore the different intron sequences
obtained in the present work in greater detail, a comparative study with elements P, Q, R and S, previously reported
in group I introns [13], was carried out (a. n. AF197122
for Ec1921 site; a. n. AF197123 for Ec2066 and a. n.
AF197124 for Ec2449). Since the Ec2563 insertion site
had not been described previously in M. anisopliae, the
comparison was performed with the B. bassiana sequence
a. n. AF430699. P, Q and R elements were conserved at the
four insertion sites. However, the element S was also identical in introns located at the Ec1921, Ec2066 and Ec2563
sites, but was not conserved for introns inserted at position Ec2449. At Ec2563 site the four elements were
located in the 1754-bp intron at the following positions:
1428 to 1440 (P), 1505 to 1519 (Q), 1455 to 1466 (R)
and 1553 to 1564 (S). In the 435-bp intron, these elements were located at positions 141 to 153 (P), 168 to
179 (Q), 218 to 232 (R) and 265 to 276 (S).
Phylogenetic analysis
The MP tree obtained after the alignment of 11 distinct
intron sequence types identified from 26 isolates and
GenBank-deposited sequences, that represent intron
sequences from three entomopathogenic genera
Metarhizium, Beauveria and Cordyceps, and the subsequent
phylogenetic analysis is shown in Figure 1. The MP tree
shows the separation of four independent groups corresponding to introns located at positions Ec1921, Ec2066,

Phylogenetic analysis of group Ifungi
Phylogenetic analysis of group I introns of the LSU
rDNA genes from entomopathogenic fungi. The MP
tree was generated by parsimony analysis after heuristic
searching (TBR option). Bootstrap full heuristic analysis with
bootstrap intervals from 1000 replications and nodes supported in >50% of bootstrap replicates was generated using
the PAUP 4.0 program. The branch lengths are proportional
to the number of changes. Eleven different intron sequence
types identified from 26 Metarhizium anisopliae isolates were
aligned with 21 representative intron sequences from
Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma), Beauveria bassiana (Bb), Cordyceps profilica (Cp) and Cordyceps sp. (Csp) and, and an intron
sequence from Naegleria sp. (Nsp) was used as an outgroup.

region in Beauveria by PCR were used to characterize our
M. anisopliae isolates. The polymorphism observed in this
region of M. anisopliae genome was high, due to the presence/absence of introns at the four conserved sites. In the
26 isolates of M. anisopliae, we identified a total of 40
group I introns, which were inserted at any of the four specific sites in the LSU rDNA. This degree of polymorphism
is in agreement with the high number of group I introns
detected in Cordyceps, in which 28 representative members
of this genus have been studied [18]. The latter authors
suggested that if sequence comparisons are carried out
between closely related taxa, one would expect to find a
high variety of insertion patterns. Thus, considering the
presence/absence of introns, due to intron vertical transmission and intron loss events, it was not unexpected that
we found six genotypes when we analysed the 26 isolates
belonging to the same species. The eight insertion sites
described in rDNA genes of entomopathogenic fungi are
not always occupied by introns and this could be related
to the genus or species considered. When LSU introns
were explored, 47 isolates of B. brongniartii and 125 of B.
bassiana were distributed within 9 and 13 genotypes,
respectively. A high number of introns inserted at the four
specific sites was detected for both species, and only 7% of
isolates tested did not display intron insertions [16,20].
However, in other studies of M. anisopliae a low intron
number was detected; only 5 and 2 introns were described
from 30 and 40 strains studied, respectively [11,12]. Bearing in mind the taxa sampled, those M. anisopliae results
were surprising since a high degree of polymorphism, due
to vertical transmission events, would be expected, and an
even higher degree if the high polymorphism discovered
in the rDNA genes of Cordyceps, the teleomorph of these
species, was considered [21,22].

Discussion

Phylogenetic studies have been used to explain the sporadic distribution of these elements in Cordyceps, proposing a cyclic model of invasion, degeneration, loss, and
reinvasion [18]. However, genotypes 1 (three introns) and
7 (no-intron insertions) were predominant in our study,
with a frequency of 38.5% and 34.6 %, respectively. Moreover, introns were more frequent at positions Ec1921 and
Ec2449 (53.8%). Additionally, only one intron inserted at
Ec2066 was discovered (3.8%). In our hands, and light of
these distribution frequencies, it seems that there is some
kind of preference for certain positions. LSU sites where
intron insertion is more frequent (84.4% for Ec1921)
have also been detected in B. bassiana strains and isolates
with three-, two- and one-intron insertions, representing
16%, 48% and 28% frequency, respectively [20].

The variability in group I introns from LSU rDNA genes
can be used as a robust molecular tool for the identification of polymorphisms in entomopathogenic fungi such
as Beauveria and Metarhizium [11,16,21]. The primers previously described to amplify the 3'-end of the LSU rDNA

A phylogenetic analysis based on intron sequences in the
LSU rDNA was carried out with the 11 different M. anisopliae sequences obtained in this work and some other
Metarhizium, Beauveria and Cordyceps representative

Ec2449 and Ec2563, supported by high bootstrap values
(100, 92, 100 and 99%, respectively). Clusters grouping
intron sequences located at Ec2066 and Ec2563 were
closer although with a support of 63 %.

sequences from public databases. In general, the MP tree
shows that introns inserted at the same site are closely
related. This is expected, considering that horizontal
transmission is one of the pathways along which group I
introns can move [18,23]. This is also in agreement with
the results obtained in other entomopathogenic fungi, in
which phylogenetic analyses of group I introns suggest
that transposition between different insertion sites is
uncommon [12,20]. At the Ec2449 insertion site, M. anisopliae isolates are separated in an independent clade
(bootstrap of 53%) from the Beauveria and Cordyceps isolates. In spite of the sequence polymorphism observed at
this insertion site, the five variants of M. anisopliae
grouped together. In this sense, a sequence comparison of
the P, Q, R and S motifs in introns inserted at the four specific sites was carried out (data not shown). Compared
with AF197124 sequence of M. anisopliae, only P, Q and R
motifs were conserved.
An intron at insertion point Ec2563 was identified in
eleven isolates. Nevertheless, the intron of the ten isolates
grouped in genotype 1 had an uncommon size of 1754bp. This intron type is usually small, ranging in size from
250–500 bp [24]. Introns with similar lengths containing
an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a highly specific
homing endonuclease (HE) have been reported previously in both the SSU of B. bassiana [25] and the LSU
rDNA of Naegleria sp. [26]. HE conserved motifs were not
detected in the 360 amino acid sequence of the M. anisopliae ORF, suggesting the ORF is not an HE.
Species and strains of Metarhizium and Beauveria have
been differentiated by RAPD analysis, but little evidence
of a correlation between RAPD groups and the geographical origin or host has been gathered [27]. Other studies
carried out in M. anisopliae have described that similar
RAPD profiles tend to be obtained from isolates of the
same geographic area [28]. LSU introns have shown a tenuous dependence upon geographical origins or specific
insects with rDNA intron genotype distribution in 125
strains of B. bassiana [20]. In the present study, the
number of isolates was much lower and those obtained
from insects were only two. Then, no comparisons
between genotypes and habitat/host could be made. In
the present work we failed to observe any correlation
between the distribution of genotypes and the geographical origins of the isolates.
The genus Metarhizium includes entomopathogenic isolates used as BCAs. To predictably and successfully apply
BCAs to combat insects in the field, it is essential that their
biology and ecology should be well understood. The
release of biocontrol agents into the environment
demands the development of methods to monitor their
presence or absence in the field [29,30]. Using a molecu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/77

lar marker such as an LSU rDNA intron, two B. bassiana
strains were discriminated in co-formulation studies [31].
In this study, the twenty-six isolates analyzed were distributed into seven genotypes considering the presence/
absence of group I introns at the 3'-end of the LSU rDNA
genes. Thus, three of the seven genotypes established
(genotypes 2, 4 and 5) have a single component; and a
high degree of polymorphism was also observed in the S
motif of intron sequences inserted at Ec2429. Primers
have been designed in these genes and their specificity is
currently being tested with both mixed mycelia from different M. anisopliae strains and soil samples with a view to
generating SCAR markers and developing quantitative
real-time PCR assays.

Conclusion
A total of 40 group I introns related to four insertion sites
detected at the 3' end in LSU rDNA genes have been identified in 26 biocontrol isolates of M. anisopliae. These
introns exhibited various insertion patterns and this small
and selected collection of 26 isolates was distributed into
7 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of these intron
sequences demonstrated a general correlation between
specific insertion sites and sequence homology. P, Q, R
and S elements were conserved at insertion positions
Ec1921, Ec2066 and Ec2563, and only P, Q and R elements were conserved at Ec2449 site.

Methods
Fungal strains and culture conditions
Twenty-six strains of M. anisopliae were used in this study.
The cultures were obtained from the collection at the
CRAF (Ciencias y Recursos Agrícolas y Forestales) Department of the University of Cordoba (Córdoba, Spain).
Their habitat/host and geographical origins are shown in
Table 1. Cultures were maintained on malt extract agar
(MEA, Difco Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) plates at
4°C.
Genomic DNA extraction
Mycelia for DNA extraction were obtained by inoculating
MEA plates that contained a sterile cellophane sheet with
spores from MEA cultures after incubation at 25°C for 4
days. Mycelia were collected by scraping the cellophane
sheets and were then frozen, lyophilized and ground.
Total DNA was extracted using the method described by
Möller et al. [32].
PCR amplification and sequencing
The primers used for the amplification of the 3'-end of the
LSU rDNA region have been reported previously for the
amplification of this region in the genus Beauveria
[16,20]. Amplification of this rDNA region for the 26 isolates of M. anisopliae included in this study was carried out
with the primer pair E24 (5'- GCTGAATTACCATTGCG-

GAG-3') and I29 (5'-CTGCCCAGTGCTCTGAATGTC-3'),
using the Taq polymerase system (Biotools B&M Labs,
Madrid, Spain), following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 25 ng of genomic DNA and 0.20 μM
concentrations of each primer described above. The
amplification included an initial denaturing cycle of 5
min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min 30 sec at
94°C, 2 min 30 sec at 57°C and 3 min at 72°C, and a final
extension step of 5 min at 72°C in a PCR System 9700
Genetic Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels buffered with 1X TAE [33] and stained with ethidium bromide. A 100-bp ladder molecular weight standard
(Roche Mannheim, Germany) was also used.
The PCR products were purified from agarose gels using
the GenClean II kit (Q-BioGen, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequences were
obtained using an automated ABI 377 Prism Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) with fluorescent terminators. All
PCR products were sequenced in both directions.
Sequences of internal primers were as follows: M1 (LSU
gene, position 769–790), 5'-GGTAAAACTAACCTGTCTCACG-3'; M2 (1754 bp intron, position 184–202), 5'GATCCTTCCCAGGGAGGTG-3'; M3 (1754 bp intron,
position 1238–1257), 5'-CGGGTAGGTATTGTAAGGCG3'; M4 (1754 bp intron, position 542–559), 5'-GGGACCTCGAGGTTTGTG-3' and M5 (1754 bp intron, position
893–911), 5'-CCAGGTCTGACTTACATG-3'.
Molecular analysis
The presence or absence of introns at the 3'-end of the
nuclear LSU rDNA of M. anisopliae was analyzed by detecting previously described target sequences [20]. Sequence
alignments were generated using the MegAlign (DNASTAR package, 1989-92, London, UK) and the CLUSTALX
1.81 program [34]. Published intron sequences for isolates included within the genera Metarhizium, Beauveria,
Cordyceps or Naegleria were retrieved from GenBank and
included in the alignments. The GenBank accession numbers were: B. bassiana, AF322942 and AF430706 for insertion site Ec1921; AF430703 and AF322939 for insertion
site Ec2066; AF430700 for insertion site Ec2449, and
AF336302 and AF322936 for insertion site Ec2563; M.
anisopliae, AF197120, AF197122 and AF363479 for insertion site Ec1921; AF197121 and AF197123 for insertion
site Ec2066, and AF197124 for insertion site Ec2449, and
Cordyceps prolifica, AB044640, and Cordyceps sp.,
AB044641, for insertion sites Ec1921, Ec2066, Ec2449
and Ec2563. The Naegleria sp. AM167886 sequence was
used as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis was carried
out with PAUP (version 4.0 b10; Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA). Gaps, encoded as missing data, and uninformative characters were excluded from the analysis. The

MP trees were obtained from heuristic searches using TBR
branch swapping [35], and all MP trees were within a single tree where all branch lengths equal to zero were collapsed by polytomies. A bootstrap full heuristic analysis
consisting of 1000 replicates was performed and a 50%
majority rule tree was produced.
The sequences corresponding to the introns from M. anisopliae obtained in this study were deposited in the
GeneBank database under the accession numbers given in
Table 1.
