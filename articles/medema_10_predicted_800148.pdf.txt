Abstract
Background: Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria perform a key step in global nitrogen cycling.
These bacteria make use of an organelle to oxidize ammonia anaerobically to nitrogen (N2) and so contribute ~50% of
the nitrogen in the atmosphere. It is currently unknown which proteins constitute the organellar proteome and how
anammox bacteria are able to specifically target organellar and cell-envelope proteins to their correct final
destinations. Experimental approaches are complicated by the absence of pure cultures and genetic accessibility.
However, the genome of the anammox bacterium Candidatus "Kuenenia stuttgartiensis" has recently been sequenced.
Here, we make use of these genome data to predict the organellar sub-proteome and address the molecular basis of
protein sorting in anammox bacteria.
Results: Two training sets representing organellar (30 proteins) and cell envelope (59 proteins) proteins were
constructed based on previous experimental evidence and comparative genomics. Random forest (RF) classifiers
trained on these two sets could differentiate between organellar and cell envelope proteins with ~89% accuracy using
400 features consisting of frequencies of two adjacent amino acid combinations. A physicochemically distinct
organellar sub-proteome containing 562 proteins was predicted with the best RF classifier. This set included almost all
catabolic and respiratory factors encoded in the genome. Apparently, the cytoplasmic membrane performs no
catabolic functions. We predict that the Tat-translocation system is located exclusively in the organellar membrane,
whereas the Sec-translocation system is located on both the organellar and cytoplasmic membranes. Canonical signal
peptides were predicted and validated experimentally, but a specific (N- or C-terminal) signal that could be used for
protein targeting to the organelle remained elusive.
Conclusions: A physicochemically distinct organellar sub-proteome was predicted from the genome of the anammox
bacterium K. stuttgartiensis. This result provides strong in silico support for the existing experimental evidence for the
existence of an organelle in this bacterium, and is an important step forward in unravelling a geochemically relevant
case of cytoplasmic differentiation in bacteria. The predicted dual location of the Sec-translocation system and the
apparent absence of a specific N- or C-terminal signal in the organellar proteins suggests that additional chaperones
may be necessary that act on an as-yet unknown property of the targeted proteins.

Background
Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria
convert ammonium and nitrite into nitrogen and are
major players in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle [1-4].
They comprise a monophyletic taxon within the Planctomycetes phylum. Like other Planctomycetes, they possess

an unusual cellular architecture with a diderm cell envelope and a compartmentalized cytoplasm [5,6]. More
specifically, the cells of anammox bacteria contain a single organelle-like intracytoplasmic compartment
bounded by a single bilayer membrane. This compartment is known as the anammoxosome, and was proposed
to be the site at which the anammox reaction takes place
[7]. This reaction is thought to be performed mainly by
cytochrome c enzymes [8]. Within anammox cells, such
enzymes have been shown to be present exclusively inside
the anammoxosome [9,10].
If indeed the anammoxosome is a separate compartment
in which a distinct and substantial part of the proteome is
localized, this would present a situation unique to bacteria. In a thorough electron tomographical study it was
reported that, unlike for example the magnetosomes of
magnetotactic bacteria [11] and the chlorosomes of green
photosynthetic bacteria [12], the anammoxosome has no
detectable membrane links with the cell envelope during
its biogenesis [13]. Furthermore, anammoxosomes divide
separately from the cell envelope during cell division [14].
This leads to two questions regarding the cell biology of
anammox bacteria: Firstly, which proteins are targeted to
the anammoxosome besides the cytochrome c enzymes?
Secondly, by what mechanism are these proteins specifically targeted to the anammoxosome?
One possible answer to the second question is that anammoxosomal proteins might contain specific sorting signals such as targeting motifs, domains or signal peptides
[15-19]. For example, in Salmonella, several effectors
were reported to contain multifunctional motifs or
domains that are responsible for translocation and localization of the effector traits [20]. Moreover, some cases
have recently been discovered in which modulation of
Sec-signal peptide sequences result in different protein
localizations [21,22]. Most strikingly, in cyanobacteria,
signal peptides from proteins targeted to the thylakoid
differ from signal peptides of proteins targeted to the cell
envelope [23-25].
Progress in the experimental investigation of the cell biology of anammox bacteria is slow because these bacteria
grow exceptionally slowly (with a doubling time of two
weeks), and are not available in pure culture. However,
the genome of the anammox bacterium Candidatus "Kuenenia stuttgartiensis" was recently assembled from a community genome [8].
Using these genome sequence data, it might be possible
to answer the first question. Interestingly, it has been
shown experimentally that the anammoxosome may be
more acidic than both the cytoplasm and the cell envelope [26]. We reasoned that such a physicochemical difference could be reflected in the amino acid composition
of the anammoxosomal sub-proteome [27], and that this
difference could be used to predict this sub-proteome in

silico. Therefore, a Random forest (RF) classifier was
trained on two sets of anammoxosomal (set A) and cellenvelope (set P) protein sequences, constructed based on
existing experimental evidence and comparative genomics. The best RF classifier was successful at predicting the
targeting of proteins to the anammoxosome. This
approach was complemented by the analysis of the
encoded protein translocation machinery. Finally, the
predicted signal peptides of the two sub-proteomes were
analyzed and compared to unravel the molecular basis of
protein sorting in anammox bacteria.

Results
Construction of training sets

We constructed two sets of amino acid sequences from
soluble proteins with functions that were known to be
specific to either the anammoxosome or the cell envelope
(Additional file 1: sheet S1). The anammoxosomal set
(termed 'set A') contained the sequences of 30 proteins,
including the 26 most highly expressed cytochrome c
proteins of K. stuttgartiensis [8,10] and 4 orthologues of
these proteins from another anammox bacterium, Candidatus "Scalindua marina" (data kindly provided by M.
Jetten and M. Kuypers). The cell-envelope set (termed
'set P') contained the sequences of 59 proteins that were
homologous to proteins with an experimentally validated
function specific for the periplasm, cell envelope, or
extracellular environment. All proteins of both sets contained a predicted N-terminal signal peptide that can
putatively be recognized by the Sec translocon. TatFind
[28] and PilFind [29] predicted no Tat-system or Type IV
system-secreted proteins in these two sets.
Training of the Random forest classifier

To detect the overall compositional differences between
the anammoxosomal and cell-envelope protein sets, we
constructed Random forest (RF) classifiers based on
amino acid composition, using set A and set P as the
training sets. Among commonly used analytical machinelearning techniques [30-35], the RF algorithm has shown
its power in classifying proteins based on noisy amino
acid composition [36-40]. To balance class sizes of sets A
and P, set P was first randomized into two sets (P1 and
P2) to arrive at three equally sized protein sets (see Material and Methods).
In total 3000 three-set (A, P1, P2) RF classifiers were
trained, based on different combinations of single or two
adjacent amino acids frequencies (average out-of-bag
(OOB) error 24.4% with standard deviation of 9.7%). The
best-performing RF model for discriminating set A from
set P was selected based on the highest accuracy (89%)
and the best anammoxosomal protein (set A) recall
(90%). This RF model had been made using two-adjacentamino-acids combination frequencies from full-length

Figure 1 Performance comparison of the RF model trained on different types of input data. 500 RF models with randomly generated P1 and
P2 sets, to correct for class A and P inbalance, were trained on each of the following 6 types of data: the full-length amino acid sequences, the signal
peptides (SP) and the mature protein amino acid sequences, each analyzed with either the residue frequency of single amino acids or the frequency
of 2 adjacent amino acids. When the 6 top-performing models of each input type are compared, the model trained with full-length protein sequences
with the 2 adjacent amino acids combination shows the highest overall accuracy (89%) and A protein recall (90%).

protein sequences as the input (Figure 1). The top 10
most important adjacent amino acid residue combinations associated with the recognition of set A were GP,
TS, ID, YS, TF, LD, YG, IG, GN and IT. The highest accuracy of RFs trained on other types of input data (with single amino acid frequencies or with other regions of the
protein sequences, e.g. signal peptides) ranged from
~75% to 84%, and the recall of anammoxosomal protein
sequences ranged from 60% to 83%, respectively (Figure
1). No tests on combinations of more than two amino
acids were attempted because this required prohibitively
long computation time. During the training process, the
RF algorithm chose the most representative features of
each class by random bagging with overlaps, which is
similar to jack-knife cross validations. Within the training
process, RF accurately determines classification errorrate (out-of-bag errors; OOB error) [40-42]. These OOB
errors were used as a non-biased indicator of the performance of the classifiers.
Identification of translocated and membrane proteins

All translocated proteins and membrane proteins
encoded in the genome of K. stuttgartiensis were classi-

fied based on the predicted presence of transmembrane
helices and/or signal peptides. Prediction of signal peptides was not straightforward because anammox bacteria
are evolutionarily only distantly related to proteins of
those organisms that were used to train the predictors
(e.g. Proteobacteria or Gram-positive bacteria). For this
reason, 15 different available signal-peptide prediction
algorithms were applied to the open-reading frames predicted for the K. stuttgartiensis genome (Figure 2). Positive predictions were combined into a single majority
vote decision for each protein. Among 4663 open-reading
frames, 594 membrane proteins and 344 translocated soluble proteins with signal peptides were predicted (Additional file 1: sheet S2). Nine of the signal-peptide carrying
proteins were predicted to be Tat-translocated by TatFind, and ten proteins were predicted to be secreted by
the Type IV secretion system by PilFind.
Experimental evidence was obtained to confirm the signal peptide cleavage sites of some exemplary proteins by
protein mass-spectrometry. For seven K. stuttgartiensis
mature proteins, including two from set A and one from
set P, N-terminally non-tryptic peptides were identified

that matched exactly to sequences after a putative SP1cleavage site at the end of a canonical Sec signal peptide
(Figure 3), indicating that the signal peptides of both anammoxosomal and cell-envelope proteins were predicted
correctly and are functional.
Prediction of the anammoxosomal sub-proteome

We then used our RF classifier to predict the destination
of the 938 translocated and membrane proteins. Of these
proteins, approximately 60% (562 proteins) was predicted

to be anammoxosomal (Table 1, and Additional file 2:
sheet S2) after removal of four predicted type IV secretion system substrates.
Importantly, the predicted anammoxosomal sub-proteome formed a functionally consistent and cohesive set.
First, the cytochrome c maturation machinery [43] was
predicted to be anammoxosomal as 6 out of the 8 encoding genes were predicted to be targeted to the anammoxosome (Additional file 2: sheet S4), consistent with
the recent proteomics study of Karlsson et al. [9]. Sec-

A summary of the predicted anammoxosomal sub-proteome of K. stuttgartiensis. In this set, 371 proteins are hypothetical proteins of
unknown function. Some examples of proteins are listed, especially those with functions known to be related to anammox. Details of the
predicted sub-proteome are stored in Additional file 2.

ondly, the destination of proteins encoded in the same
genetic neighbourhood (i.e. putative operons) was generally consistent. This makes sense because such proteins
are usually subunits of a protein complex or otherwise
functionally associated (Additional file 2: sheet S5).
Thirdly, we found that only 15 of the 562 predicted anam-

moxosomal proteins (2.7%) had SMART or PFAM functional domains [44] (e-value < 0.01) which are on
functional grounds incompatible with an anammoxosomal location (Additional file 2: sheet S2).
Finally, the predicted anammoxosomal sub-proteome
was consistent with the proposed biological role of the

Medema et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/299

anammoxosome [7,10,45]. If the main catabolism of anammox bacteria takes place in the anammoxosome, the
respiratory complexes should be associated with this
compartment. Indeed, all 14 major respiratory complexes
encoded in the K. stuttgartiensis genome were predicted
to reside in the anammoxosomal membrane (Additional
file 2: sheet S6). Moreover, three out of four ammonium
transporters, all nitrite transporters, and all nitrite/
nitrate antiporters were predicted to be anammoxosomal
(Additional file 2: sheet S7). In contrast, importers of
essential trace elements and amino acids, as well as multidrug-efflux proteins were predicted to be located on the
outside of the cells, as expected. A single putative copper
ATP transporter was predicted to be anammoxosomal
consistent with the anammoxosomal destination of some
enzymes dependent on copper (or other metal cations).
Overall, the RF classifier predicts that in anammox bacteria the cytoplasmic membrane is mainly used for transport and that essentially all catabolic functions (the
anammox reaction, respiration and ATP synthesis) are
associated with the intracytoplasmic organelle.
Mechanism of protein translocation

The next point we addressed is the molecular basis for
protein sorting in anammox bacteria. We reasoned that
comparison of predicted protein features to those of reference bacteria could provide the first clues to how such a
sorting system could function.
Homology searches showed that the typical bacterial protein translocation system components, including the Sectranslocation system (SecYEG, SecA and YidC proteins)
[46-48], Tat-translocation system (TatA/B and TatC proteins) [49] and type I [50], II [51] and IV [52] signal peptidases were encoded by the genome of K. stuttgartiensis.
All components were present in single gene copy only
(Table 2).
The identified components of the Sec- and Tat-systems
appeared canonical, except for the presence of a C-terminal FecR domain (PF04773) in TatC. This signal-transducing domain is absent in any other TatC protein
identified so far. Topology predictions of the TatC-FecR
protein (by Phobius [53], TMHMM [54], and HMMTOP
[55]) unanimously showed that the FecR domain is noncytoplasmic. Because of the uniqueness of such a domain
combination, it is tempting to speculate that the FecR-like
domain may somehow have a role in the evolutionary
solution that has been found by anammox bacteria for
protein sorting to the anammoxosome.
Interestingly, the RF classifier results for Sec components
were ambiguous (only 3 out of 6 subunits were predicted
to be anammoxosomal), whereas the Tat system was predicted to be completely anammoxosomal (Additional file
2: sheet S8). Consistently, 7 out of the 9 Tat-substrates
predicted in the K. stuttgartiensis genome were also pre-

Page 6 of 14

dicted to be anammoxosomal. These include a multi-copper oxidase SufI (kuste4301), a putative superoxide
dismutase (kustd1303), two Rieske subunits of the bc1
complex (kuste3096 and kuste4569), and a few hypothetical proteins. The NarG nitrate reductase subunit is very
probably a false positive, as has been noted earlier [56].
In conclusion, the encoded protein translocation machinery shows that no duplication of the Sec- or Tat-systems
has taken place to facilitate separate translocation routes,
and that both systems may be involved in protein sorting
towards the anammoxosome.
The role of signal peptides in protein sorting

Regardless of the protein translocation machinery used,
the targeting of proteins to specific subcellular locations
is often accomplished by modulation of N- or C-terminal
signal peptides, in eukaryotes [15-19] and prokaryotes
[23-25] alike. Therefore, we compared the N- and C-termini of the two training sets A and P to identify a possible
distinctive property or amino acid motif that could be
used to differentiate both sets of protein sequences.
Direct alignment of the signal peptides resulted in alignments which only had high quality (similarity level higher
than 30%) in the h-regions (TMH). Therefore, the n-, h-,
and c-regions of the signal peptides from the amino acid
sequences from both training sets were first extracted
manually, and were used to create a series of ungapped
alignments which were aligned at: (1) the N-terminus; (2)
the h-region start; (3) the c-region start; and (4) the putative cleavage site. The resulting segmental alignments
were then joined in the order corresponding to the original signal peptide architecture. The sequence logo [57] of
the ungapped alignments of the N-termini illustrates that
in general the signal peptides of both sets were canonical
type I signal peptides (Figure 4) and most of the proteins
had SPase I cleavage sites with a clear AxA motif. These
alignments were further investigated by comparing the
search results of Hidden Markov Models [58] of both sets
in a sliding window approach (Additional file 3), but no
discriminating motif was found in either set A or set P.
MEME motif searches [59] and statistical analysis of
amino acid frequencies also did not yield any significant
differences. Finally, we trained RF classifiers using only
the N-terminus (30 amino acids) of the two sets of proteins, with the frequencies of two adjacent amino acid
combinations as also used for the full protein RF classifiers. The resulting RF classifiers showed much lower accuracy than the models built based on the complete protein
sequences, suggesting that less distinctive features were
encoded in the N-terminus of these 2 groups of proteins
(Figure 1).
An interesting side observation was that the h-regions of
the predicted signal peptides from K. stuttgartiensis proteins contained significantly more phenylalanine residues

(2.23 on average for both training sets) than found in E.
coli TMHs (1.64 on average, Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3). We speculate that this difference may
be related to the affinity of trans-membrane helices to the
unique ladderane membranes of anammox bacteria that
have an exceptionally high density to prevent diffusion
[60].
Yet in conclusion, it is unlikely that the N- or C- terminus
plays a role in protein targeting of anammox bacteria.

Discussion
The anammoxosome of anammox bacteria is one of the
best documented cases of organellar biogenesis in Bacteria; electron tomography has shown that this bacterial
organelle divides separately from the cytoplasmic mem-

brane, and is not connected to this membrane during a
complete cell cycle [14]. Cytochrome c proteins were
detected exclusively inside the anammoxosome [10] and
an intracytoplasmic pH gradient was shown to exist [28].
Because experimental investigation of anammox bacteria
appeared to be difficult and the genome of K. stuttgartiensis has been sequenced recently, an in silico analysis
was therefore obviously the next step forwards in unravelling this interesting biological phenomenon.
In the present study a Random forest classifier was
trained with two sets of protein sequences. The best RF
classifier predicted an organellar sub-proteome of 562
proteins that was internally consistent and made functional sense. The best classifier used two-adjacentamino-acids combination frequency as the input.

Figure 4 Sequence composition of the signal peptides of the anammoxosome and cell envelope protein sets. Weblogos of the signal peptides of protein sets A (anammoxosomal) and P (cell envelope) are shown. Both the hydrophobic h-regions (residues -6 to -17) and the signal peptidase AxA consensus (residues -1 to -3) preceding the cleavage site are clearly visible. The weblogos were created from sequences aligned to the
cleavage site, using Weblogo [47].

According to their grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY)
[61] and aliphatic index [62], the anammoxosomal proteins tend to be more hydropathic and more aliphatic
(Figure 5). This could be a consequence of the different
physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. different pH [26])
inside the anammoxosome. As computing power is likely
to increase, the accuracy of the RF classifier may be
improved in follow-up studies, e.g. by using combinations
of more than 2 amino acids.
The anammoxosomal training set consisted only of
amino acid sequences of cytochrome c proteins. It is possible that the classification was biased by the uniqueness
of the protein types in this set. However, the cytochrome
c protein family is only defined by the presence of a conserved CXXCH heme-binding motif (which we excluded
from the RF input data) in an alpha-helical domain. Yet
the remainder of the amino acid sequences were vastly
variable, some polypeptides even containing regions with
different folds or domains [63,64]. In fact, motif searches
showed that no conserved sequence patterns could be
found in set A except for the heme-binding motif, and the
pairwise sequence identities of proteins in this set were
all below 80%, with only 11 of them above 50%.
For the prediction of translocated proteins, a combination of 15 existing signal peptide prediction algorithms

was used. These 15 signal peptide predictors reported
immensely different predictions (Figure 2) on the presence or absence of a signal peptide in K. stuttgartiensis
proteins. Considering the fact that the Gram-negative
predictors were mainly trained with sequences from Proteobacteria, which are only very distantly related to anammox bacteria, it is highly unlikely that the reported
accuracies of these predictors of 91-95% [65-68] can be
valid for Kuenenia proteins. Moreover, among all
employed algorithms, the SignalP-HMM algorithm
trained on eukaryotes showed the highest true-positive
rate by predicting signal peptides in 68 out of 69 of the
proteins in set A. This indicates that anammox signal
peptides are more similar to those of eukaryotes than to
those of Gram-negative or Gram-positive model bacteria.
Analysis of the encoded protein translocation machinery
provided some clues as to how this bacterium targets
translocated proteins to their proper destination. Because
this machinery is non-redundant, an additional layer of
chaperoning would be required to achieve specificity.
Moreover, because no sorting signal was apparent at the
N- or C-termini of the proteins, such chaperones could
act on the physicochemical characteristics observed in
the amino acid sequence. Alternatively, the signal may act

Figure 5 Physicochemical differences between anammoxosomal and cell envelope proteins. Two physicochemical parameters are plotted
against each other: GRAVY index (grand average of hydropathy) and aliphatic index (relative volume occupied by aliphatic side chains of I, L, V, and
A), which can both be calculated from amino acid compositions. These two parameters separate sets A and P into two largely distinct clusters. Purple
dots: set P. Blue dots: set A.

at the level of the messenger RNA that could determine
the fate of the protein even before translation starts.
In case of the Sec translocase, some subunits (SecE, SecG
and YidC) were predicted to be anammoxosomal, while
some others (SecY, SecA, SecDF,YajC) were not. According to the presence of the seemingly canonical Sec-signal
peptides on both cell-envelope-targeted proteins and
anammoxosome-targeted proteins, it is likely that the Sec
translocase has a dual localization on both the anammoxosomal and the periplasmic membranes. However,
recent studies have also shown that under certain conditions Sec-system exported proteins could as well be
translocated by the Tat-system [69,70], and therefore we
cannot exclude the possibility that the Tat system translocates more than just the predicted twin-arginine-motifcarrying substrates.
An alternative hypothesis for anammoxosomal targeting
could be primary translocation to the periplasm through
the Sec pathway and secondary retro-translocation to the
anammoxosome (or vice versa) through vesicles. However, it must be noted that the application of 3D electron
microscopy (tomography) did not reveal any such vesicles
in growing or dividing cells [13].
In order to further elucidate the anammox protein targeting problem, more experiments, such as immunolocalization of the Tat- and Sec-translocase subunits and

quantitative proteomics approaches [71,72], comparing
protein concentration levels in purified anammox cells
and solutions enriched in anammoxosomes (a purification method which has been described earlier [60]), are
required. The present study provides a clear hypothesis to
future experiments: in anammox bacteria, catabolism
and respiration are strictly organellar, leaving only transport functions for the cytoplasmic membrane.

Conclusions
The anammoxosome of anammox bacteria is one of the
best documented cases of organellar biogenesis in bacteria. Experiments have shown that several key enzymes
catalyzing the anammox reaction are present exclusively
inside the anammoxosome. The present study makes use
of physicochemical characteristics of predicted protein
sequences to predict a 90% accurate sub-proteome that
constitutes this bacterial organelle. Meanwhile, the
mechanism of protein sorting remained largely elusive.
The predicted sub-proteome has been deposited into a
freely accessible Microsoft-Excel database (Additional file

Methods
Genome sequence of Candidatus K. stuttgartiensis

The complete predicted proteome of K. stuttgartiensis
was compiled from all annotated protein sequences (4663
ORFs, accessed 11-02-2008) encoded by K. stuttgartiensis
genome fragments kustA - kustE (GenBank accession
nrs.: CT030148, CT573074, CT573073, CT573072,
CT573071). The proteome has been deposited in the
peptidome database (accession number PSE111).
Sets of putatively anammoxosome- and cell-envelopetargeted proteins

The set of amino acid sequences of putative anammoxosomal proteins ("set A") was first constructed from the
cytochrome c proteins with a peptide coverage of more
than 10% in an experimental analysis of the K. stuttgartiensis proteome (Kartal et al., unpublished data). Next,
local BlastP searches were performed with the Scalindu
marina metagenome using these protein sequences as
queries in order to extend the set A. Reciprocal best Blast
hits with the K. stuttgartiensis genome that share an identical gene context with the set A proteins were identified
as orthologues and added to set A. By similar methods a
set of amino acid sequences of putative cell-envelope
and/or excreted proteins ("set P") was also constructed.
This set consisted of proteins from the K. stuttgartiensis
genome with high similarity to proteins with a validated
function in the periplasm, cell envelope or extracellular
environment [73-89].
Predicted integral transmembrane proteins (predicted
using Phobius [53], combined with manual inspection)
were removed from the sets. The translation start sites of
the selected proteins were manually checked and corrected when necessary. Pairwise identities of the
sequences from both sets were calculated with MatGAT
[90] and redundant protein sequences (with pairwise
identity higher than 85%) were removed.
Prediction of signal peptide-carrying proteins in
Candidatus K. stuttgartiensis

Signal peptide predictions on the whole K. stuttgartiensis
proteome were performed by the Gram-negative, Grampositive and eukaryote versions of the algorithm PrediSi
[67], SignalP-HMM and SignalP-NN [66], Gram-negative
and Gram-positive versions of Signal-3L [68] and SignalCF [65], and the general versions of RPSP [91] and Phobius [53]. All positive predictions from all algorithms
were combined into a majority vote decision. Transmembrane helices (TMH) were predicted by Phobius,
TMHMM [54], and HMMTOP [55]. Tat-secreted proteins were identified with TatFind [34]. The same algorithms were also run on all protein sequences of sets A
and P (see below). The n-, h-, and c-regions of the predicted signal peptides were determined manually based

Page 10 of 14

on expert knowledge with help of the predictions by Phobius and SignalP. No attempt was made to differentiate
between signal peptides (which are cleaved by a SPase)
and signal anchors (which are not cleaved) for these sets.
Random Forest classification based on mature protein
amino acid composition

The Random Forest classifier package (version 4.5-28)
[42,92] from the R environment (version 2.8.1) [42,93]
was used to train RF classifiers for the separation of anammoxosomal (set A) and cell-envelope (set P) proteins.
In order to reduce the bias due to class size imbalance
(larger size of set P), this set was randomly separated into
two subsets (set P1 and P2) with sizes similar to that of
set A. As input for the RF algorithm, features were determined based on the frequencies (occurrences divided by
the sequence length) of amino acids, including the frequencies of two-adjacent-amino-acids, from (i) the SPs,
(ii) the full-length amino acid sequences and (iii) the
mature protein amino acid sequences of sets A, set P1
and set P2 (except cysteines and histidines, which constitute the heme c binding motif ). A three-class (P1, P2, and
A) RF model was trained with 1000 trees per forest using
each set of input data at each round of P set randomization. The randomization training process was repeated
500 times for each set of input data, after which the votes
for classes P1 and P2 were pooled into one merged set P
and the overall classification or out-of-bag (OOB) errors
were calculated.
The best RF model was selected based on overall accuracy and A protein recall. When a tie situation occurred
with the overall accuracy, the model with higher A protein recall was preferred.
Identification of Sec signal peptide cleavage sites by massspectrometry

Mass-spectrometry experiments were performed to
identify the Sec-signal peptide cleavage sites in proteins
from sets A and P. A detailed methodology of these
experiments is described in the Additional file 3. The
resulting mass spectrometric data files were searched
against a database containing the K. stuttgartiensis proteins and known contaminants like human keratins and
trypsin using Mascot (Matrix Science Inc., USA, version
2.2) [94]. Variant sequences were modified at the N-terminus by deleting amino acid 1 to 50 and were added to
the database in order to search for the Sec-signal peptide
cleavage site. The resulting peptide hits were validated
using an in-house developed script which selects peptides
based on peptide score, the number of variable modifications, the expectation value, and the modified delta score.
From the list of validated peptides, a non-redundant Nterminal peptide list was manually extracted by the criteria of: (1), whether the protein was identified with ≥ 3

Medema et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/299

peptides; (2), whether the peptide was the first detectable
peptide (based on calculated m/z values of in silico predicted tryptic peptides in relationship with the m/z
detection limits of the mass spectrometer) of the protein;
(3), whether the peptide was semi-tryptic (with the nontryptic side at the N-terminus).
Prediction of the anammoxosomal sub-proteome of K.
stuttgartiensis

The Candidatus K. stuttgartiensis proteome was separated into the translocated and non-translocated sets by
combining several signal-peptide predictors as follows:
firstly, a majority vote of the prediction from 15 signalpeptide prediction algorithms (see above) was used to
predict sets of proteins containing SPs (511) and proteins
without SPs (4152). Secondly, the proteins without SPs
were subdivided into sets of soluble cytoplasmic proteins
(3724 proteins, set 4) and SP-less transmembrane proteins (427 proteins, set 3), using predictions of TMHMM
2.0 [54]. Finally the SP-containing proteins were considered subdivided into soluble proteins and proteins containing TMHs, by assessing which proteins had TMHs
predicted by a Phobius constrained prediction (constraint: N-terminus = signal peptide). This resulted in a
predicted set of 344 SP-containing soluble proteins (set 1)
and a predicted set of 167 SP-containing transmembrane
proteins (set 2) (Additional file 1: sheet S2). The TMHs
(including TMH topology) were predicted by either a
constrained Phobius search (for sets 1 and 2) or the
TMHMM output (for set 3). Protein sequence composition data of subset 1-3 were then used to predict the anammoxosome proteome.
Identification and sequence analysis of the protein
translocation system components in the genome of
Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis

Genes encoding translocation-associated proteins SecY,
SecE, SecG, SecA, SecDF, YajC, YidC, TatA, TatC, SPI,
SPII, SPIV, FtsY, and Ffh were identified in the K. stuttgartiensis genome by finding reciprocal best Blast hits using
BlastP [95] with the well-studied proteins involved in
inner membrane translocation in Escherichia coli K12 as
queries. Orthologues from S. marina were identified by
performing BlastP analysis on a metagenomic database
(M. Jetten and M.Kuypers, unpublished results) constructed with a S. marina enrichment culture [96], using
the above-identified K. stuttgartiensis protein sequences
as a query.
Homologues of the Sec- and Tat- translocation system
components from other bacterial species were found by
PSI-Blast [97] searches using the Escherichia coli K12
proteins as queries on the GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genomic data from all bacterial
phyla. The K. stuttgartiensis protein translocation-associ-

Page 11 of 14

ated proteins were aligned to at least 4 non-planctomycete sequences using Muscle [98].
Analysis of N-terminal signal peptides

Multiple sequence alignments were made by Muscle 3.6
using standard parameters. Motif searches were performed using MEME [59], first with the criterion of zero
or one motif per sequence, then with one motif per
sequence. Phylogenetic footprinting [99] was performed
by aligning the signal peptides of K. stuttgartiensis and S.
marina orthologues from set A together with their putative orthologues (based on reciprocal best BlastP hits)
from the sequences of planctomycete KSU-1 obtained by
Shimamura et al. [100,101]. The protein physicochemical
properties, including the prevalence of general amino
acid classes (ILV, FWY, AILVMFWYC, AGS, ST, GNP,
DE, DN, KR, EQ, DENQ, HKR, DENQHKR, and DENQHKRST), aliphatic index [68], and GRAVY index (grand
average of hydropathy, according to the Kyte/Doolittle
scale) [61] of the proteins were calculated by custom
Python scripts. Statistical analysis on these parameters
was performed by calculating the average, standard deviation, and average deviation of the data.
