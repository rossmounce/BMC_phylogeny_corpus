Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Studies concerning transcriptional regulation of
miRNAs have so far concentrated on those located within the intergenic region of the genome and
the search for putative promoters, thus leaving open the question of the existence of possible
regulatory elements common to all miRNAs including those located in introns of protein coding
genes.
Results: In this study, we initially searched for motifs occurring in the area 1000 bp upstream from
all miRNAs independent of their genomic location. We discovered a previously unknown sequence
motif GANNNNGA that displayed a conserved distribution in the nematode worms Caenorhabditis
elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. This motif had a peak occurrence at 500 bp upstream, with a
sharp drop-off toward the miRNA start site. Further analysis indicated that this motif was locally
restricted and not enriched 1000–5000 bp upstream or 0–2000 bp downstream of the miRNA start
site. In addition, this motif was observed to be most abundant in the upstream sequences of two
important miRNAs, mir-1 and mir-124. This abundance was also conserved in phylogenetically
distant species including human and mouse.
Conclusion: The results show that the motif GANNNNGA is conserved close to miRNA
precursor start sites, suggesting that it may be involved in miRNA sequence recognition or
regulation. This data provides important knowledge for the identification and computational
prediction of miRNA sequences.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form one class of small, non-protein coding RNAs. They are defined as single stranded, 19–
25 nt long endogenously expressed RNAs generated from
one arm of a hairpin precursor sequence [1-3]. These precursors are derived from a larger transcript, pri-miRNA,
which is considered to be the original transcription product of a miRNA gene. MiRNAs are known to be involved

in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding
genes. They operate by binding to the 3'UTR region of a
mRNA sequence with antisense base pairing and cleave
the target mRNA or repress its translation into protein.
One miRNA can repress various different mRNAs and a
single mRNA may be bound by several co-operating miRNAs [4,5]. The expression of a miRNA may be associated
with different developmental stages of an organism or,

more often, they are found to be expressed in particular
cell types [2,3].

finding tools: POCO, Weeder, MEME and Gibbs Motif
Sampler.

The transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes is still not
completely understood. Most miRNA genes are located in
the genome far away from protein coding genes and are
therefore thought to derive from their own, independent
transcription units [2,3]. There is also some evidence that
these "intergenic" miRNAs are transcribed from their own
promoters by RNA Polymerase II [6,7], and that a small
fraction of miRNAs interspersed among the Alu repeats in
human genome may be transcribed by RNA Polymerase
III [8]. MiRNAs organized to clusters are also suggested to
be transcribed independently as multi-cistronic units
[9,10]. Those miRNAs whose origins are in introns of protein coding genes are possibly transcribed either in parallel with their host genes or independently [2,3].

With POCO, 65 significant patterns that occur in every
sequence in both C. elegans and C. briggsae putative
miRNA promoter sequence sets were found (Table 1). The
found patterns were 4–8 bp long, containing four known
nucleotides A, C, G or T while the rest of the places in a
pattern, marked as N, can be any of these. There were four
patterns having an average of more than 10 occurrences in
both of our putative miRNA regulatory region data sets:
GAGA (11.6 in C. elegans/15.4 in C. briggsae),
GANNNNGA (11.3/14.8), GANANNG (11.0/13.1) and
ANAGNG (10.9/11.0), thus containing abundant A and
G. To check if these nucleotides are dominating in our
putative regulatory sequences, the proportion of all nucleotides was calculated from all the sequences of C. elegans
and C. briggsae. The most frequent nucleotides were A
(30.9% in C. elegans and 29.9% in C. briggsae) and T
(30.8% and 29.7%, respectively), while both C and G had
about 20% proportions. The multiple sequence alignment of the over-represented patterns common to both
data sets gave for consensus sequence GANNNNGNG, a
pattern that closely resembles GANNNNGA, one of the
most copious patterns found from both putative miRNA
regulatory sequence sets. Thus, from all the POCO results,
we selected GANNNNGA for further study. In addition, to
find if this actually was a repetitive motif, we counted also
the occurrences of GANNNNGANNNNGA and found it
from 57 C. elegans and 58 C. briggsae putative miRNA regulatory sequences.

The upstream regions of intergenic miRNAs have been
inspected in several studies to reveal additional information about miRNA transcription [7,11-13]. In these studies, some interesting sequence motifs have been found
and also a few known transcription factors are suggested
to regulate the miRNAs. The focus has thus far mainly
been in the putative promoters of miRNA genes that are
located in the intergenic area, thus leaving open the question of possible regulatory elements of all the other miRNAs.
In this study, we examined the upstream sequences of
Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae miRNAs
in order to find over-represented, phylogenetically conserved short sequence motifs that occur upstream from
miRNAs, independent of their origin in the genome. In
the analysis, we used four motif finding tools with different algorithms and motif models. The most significant
motif found was GANNNNGA, a novel motif with conserved distribution upstream of the miRNAs in these
worms. This motif was also found to be especially abundant in the upstream sequences of two old and biologically important miRNAs, mir-1 and mir-124, thus
suggesting a connection between the number of motif
instances in the upstream sequence close to a miRNA start
site and a globally conserved function of the miRNA.

Results
The main workflow of the study is shown in Figure 1.
Search for conserved motifs
The putative miRNA promoter sequence sets, containing
the sequences up to 1000 bp upstream from the starting
site of 100 Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs (25 of these
were located within a protein coding gene) and 95
Caenorhabditis briggsae miRNAs, were searched for conserved over-represented sequence patterns with four motif

Both putative miRNA regulatory sequence sets were further scanned for over-represented short patterns using
three motif finding tools with different algorithms and
motif models. With Weeder, the most significant pattern
found was GAAGGAGG, located 473 times from 94 C. elegans and 623 times from 93 C. briggsae miRNA upstream
sequences. Further, with Gibbs Motif Sampler, the most
frequent motif revealed was TTTCAAAAA, with 1218
instances in 98 C. elegans sequences, but only 623
instances in 94 C. briggsae sequences. The two most significant patterns found with MEME had consensus
sequences CTCCGCCC and TTTCAAAA, the latter of
which is a more well-defined version of the motif with
similar consensus found with Gibbs Motif Sampler. These
two motifs were found only from 57 and 63 C. elegans
miRNA upstream sequences, respectively. All the motifs
found with different tools together with the motif
sequence logos and the motif p-values calculated against
random background are gathered to Figure 2.
Motif analysis
The Transfac 7.0 public database [14] contains only a few
nematode transcription factor binding sites, and none of
them could be matched with any motif we had found.

The main workflow of this study
The main workflow of this study.
We did find a human match with ISGF-3 from Transfac,
and STAT1 from the JASPAR v3 database [15]. Some of
these motifs we observed in C. elegans were reported in
earlier studies concerning C. elegans intergenic miRNA
promoter elements. The motif CTCCGCCC was first
found by Ohler et al. [11], from conserved upstream
sequence blocks of orthologous, independently transcribed C. elegans and C. briggsae miRNA foldbacks and
later, this same motif was found also by Zhou et al. [7].
Also, the motif TTTCAAAAA was found earlier by Ohler et
al. [11] from the area 1000 bp downstream of orthologous, independently transcribed C. elegans and C. briggsae
miRNA foldbacks. We found this motif upstream in
almost every C. elegans miRNA, including 16 miRNAs
from the sense strand of an intron. This may not be surprising, because a motif very similar to this was discovered

earlier from C. elegans protein coding gene introns [16].
Most miRNA genes have CT-repeats in their nearby
upstream region, which may suggest significance of the
motif GAAGGAGG in the studied area [7]. In contrast, the
motif GANNNNGA has equal frequencies of different
nucleotides in positions 3 to 6, and any link to the CTrepeat is not, at this stage, obvious.
Conservation studies of the motif GANNNNGA
GANNNNGA was the only motif that occurred in all studied putative miRNA promoter sequences in both species.
To determine whether this motif is specific to the studied
area up to 1000 bp upstream from the starting site of nematode miRNAs, we downloaded the sequences from 5000
upstream to 2000 bp downstream with respect to miRNA
start sites for all miRNAs of both worms, and located all

the motif occurrences from this area. Further, we drew the
200 bp moving average curves of the frequency of motif
GANNNNGA for both worms in this larger area around
the miRNAs (Figure 3). The curves show that the motif
GANNNNGA has conserved distribution relative to
miRNA starting sites in both worms, and that it is most
frequent in the area 1000 bp upstream from the miRNA
start site with a pronounced peak at about 500 bp with
~13 occurrences on average in C. elegans and ~15 occurrences in C. briggsae, while the overall average count of the
motif is less than 10 in both worms.
All occurrences of the motif GANNNNGA were then
counted from 1000 bp upstream of 70 orthologous
miRNA pairs in C. elegans and C. briggsae. The results of
this calculation and the location of each miRNA with
respect to the C. elegans protein coding genes are presented in Table 2. For those miRNAs that are from the protein coding area, we also indicate its strand with respect to
the host gene (sense +, antisense -). Fifteen orthologous

miRNA pairs have 15 or more instances of the motif
GANNNNGA in the area 1000 bp upstream from their
start sites, including 7 miRNAs from the sense strand of an
intron and 1 miRNA overlapping an exonic area. On the
other hand, 34 of the 70 orthologous miRNAs have less
than 10 motif GANNNNGA occurrences in C. elegans.
When comparing these results, we found that the motif
GANNNNGA is especially abundant in the 1000 bp
upstream sequences of miRNAs mir-1, mir-124 and mir228 in both worms. From these, mir-1 and mir-228 are
intergenic, while mir-124 is located in the intron of the
gene trpa-1.
To determine whether the motif GANNNGA is conserved
in the upstream sequences of mir-1, mir-124 and mir-228
orthologs in other species, we located all its occurrences
from 1000 bp upstream sequences of all miRNAs that,
according to miRBase [17], belong to mir-1 or mir-124
family in human and mouse genomes. Mir-228 is not
found from these two genomes, and generally it is

Figure 2 conserved motifs discovered from the miRNA regulatory region of C. elegans and C. briggsae
Significant
Significant conserved motifs discovered from the miRNA regulatory region of C. elegans and C. briggsae. Presented is the total number of the motif instances in both regulatory region sequence sets and the number of miRNAs that contain the motif in their upstream region. The rightmost column shows the p-value of the motif calculated against random
background sequences. Motif logos show the information content present at every position in the sequence, for example in the
logo of motif GANNNNGA the G:s and A:s are certain, thus having the highest information content (2 bits) while in the positions 3 to 6 all four nucleotides have about the same frequencies and the information content in these positions is close to
zero.

included in the mir-124 family [18]. Both human and
mouse, have three miRNAs belonging to the mir-1 -family:
mir-1-1, mir-1-2 and mir-206. The 1000 bp upstream
sequence of human hsa-mir-1-1 includes 21 occurrences of
the motif which is more than twice as many occurrences
as the corresponding sequences of hsa-mir-1-2 and hsamir-206 which contain 10 and 6 occurrences, respectively.
For mouse, the numbers are 20 for mmu-mir-1-1, 6 for
mmu-mir-1-2, and 6 for mmu-mir-206. Similar results were
observed when looking at the occurrences of
GANNNNGA in the mir-124 -family, where the putative
promoter sequence of mir-124a-1 is the only one that
includes a significant number of the motif in both species,
37 and 19, respectively. In summary, the mir-1-1 1000 bp
upstream sequences of human and mouse contain nearly
as many occurrences of the motif GANNNNGA (21 and
20) as the corresponding sequences of mir-1 of C. elegans
and C. briggsae (23 and 26). The same holds for the 1000

bp upstream sequences of mir-124-a1 of human and
mouse (37 and 19) compared with the corresponding
sequences for mir-124 of C. elegans and C. briggsae (26 and
30). On average, the human miRNA 1000 bp upstream
sequences contain 9.9 occurrences of motif GANNNNGA
and in mouse the corresponding average is 10.6 compared
to 11.3 and 14.8 for C. elegans and C. briggsae, respectively.
We draw the frequency diagrams of the motif
GANNNNGA in the 1000 bp upstream sequences of mir1 and mir-124 orthologs in these four species (Figure 4),
and made the global alignments of mir-1 and mir-124
upstream sequences (Additional files 1 and 2). In both
cases, we chose mir-1-1 as the representative of mir-1 -family and mir-124a-1 for the representative of mir-124 -family for human and mouse. The distribution of motif
GANNNNGA in the 1000 bp upstream area of both miRNAs looks rather similar, giving a clue to possible conser-

vation of the motif even between these phylogenetically
distant species.
Using miRNA microarray analysis, we measured the signal
intensity of C. elegans miRNAs isolated from age synchronized whole body wildtype worms and plotted the values
versus the number of observed GANNNNGA motifs for
each miRNA (Figure 5). A weak correlation only was
found, r2 = 0.13.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the 1000 bp upstream regions
of all C. elegans and C. briggsae miRNAs to reveal characteristic sequence motifs. In addition to the miRNAs in the
intergenic area, we included in our study also the miRNAs
that lie in the protein coding area and whose possible pro-

moters were not studied earlier. In the search, we focused
on over-represented, phylogenetically conserved short
sequence motifs that can be found from the miRNA
upstream regions, independently of miRNA origins in the
genome. The four motif finding algorithms used in the
search gave a couple of very frequent result patterns whose
consensus sequences were quite diverse, due to the different motif and background models used in the algorithms.
We found one significant sequence motif, GANNNNGA,
which was quite abundant and could be located from all
miRNA upstream sequences of C. elegans and C. briggsae.
Thus, the motif GANNNNGA is found from all studied
miRNA upstream regions, and no clear difference can be
made in its abundance when comparing the intergenic
miRNAs and the miRNAs located in the protein coding

area. In addition, this pattern seemed to also have a conserved distribution in the area surrounding the studied
1000 bp miRNA upstream loci in these two worms, having most of its occurrences between 0–1000 bp upstream
from miRNA start sites. From earlier studies [11], this is
known to be a highly conserved region upstream of intergenic C. elegans and C. briggsae orthologous miRNA precursors, and the putative PolII type promoter sequences of
most C. elegans intergenic miRNAs are predicted to be situated on the 0–500 bp area upstream from the precursors
[7]. The motif GANNNNGA was not found in earlier studies of C. elegans miRNA promoters [7,11] perhaps because
these studies were focused on the intergenic miRNA promoters, thus leaving motifs in the coding area out of
scope. Another reason is the tools used for motif finding
had a motif model different from that used in POCO,
which puts the wildcards (N) in certain places in the middle of the motif and keeps the other places occupied with
constant nucleotides [19].
Several lines of evidence suggest that the motif
GANNNNGA is not a miRNA promoter. First, although
the motif is found proximal to the miRNA transcript, it is

found in abundant copies, which is more characteristic of
enhancer or other regulatory elements. Second, we have
cloned the 1000 bp 5' flanking region of mir-1 and used it
to construct an expression plasmid with green fluorescent
protein as the reporter (data not shown). We were not
able to express the reporter despite successful experiments
with a variety of other promoters [20]. Eventually, large
scale deletion analysis of multiple miRNA flanking
sequences using a strong promoter and including the
miRNA sequence may be necessary to help define the context where GANNNNGA is active. Thirdly, there appears
to be only a weak correlation between the number of
GANNNNGA motifs and absolute expression levels (Figure 5). Finally, using STAMP [21], we were not able to find
any matching transcription factor binding sites in C. elegans using the TRANSFAC or JASPAR databases.
Prior to and independent from the current study, there
has been keen interest in mir-1 and mir-124, two miRNAs
with the most abundant GANNNNGA motifs. These two
miRNAs are found from all bilateria and are thus interpreted to be among those most phylogenetically ancient
miRNAs [22,23]. Both are known to have high tissue spe-

cificity. Mir-1 is known to have high expression levels in
mammalian heart and muscle cells while mir-124 contributes to the cells of the nervous system [24]. In a landmark
study, Lim et al. [5] demonstrated through transfection to
human HeLa cells, that these miRNAs can downregulate
the transcription of 96 and 174 annotated genes, respectively, most likely through 3' UTR seed matches, and thus
may have a wide global effect to the identity of the tissues
mentioned above [5]. The down regulation of brain
mRNAs by mir-124 in transfected HeLa cells suggests that
this miRNA confers tissue specific expression. Consistent
with this result, the transfection of mir-1 duplexes to HeLa
cells produced a heart and skeletal muscle profile. Mir-124
has also been shown to promote neuronal differentiation
by down regulating the general splice regulator PTB1 [25].
From the evolutionary point of view, the tight tissue specific regulation and large number of genes targeted
appears logical, since phylogenetically ancient miRNAs
are supposed to have more targets than more recent ones
[22]. Consistent with these studies, we found that another
brain specific miRNA, hsa-mir-9, has 21 occurrences of
motif GANNNNGA in its 1000 bp upstream sequence
(data not shown). Thus, the presence of more copies of
GANNNNGA in the upstream sequences of miRNAs may
signal a globally conserved function, such as tissue specific expression. We also found the frequency distribution
of the motif in the upstream sequences from human and
mouse orthologs of mir-1 and mir-124 to approximately
follow its corresponding distributions in the two worms,
thus confirming the conserved nature of the motif.
Motifs CTCTCTCTCTC and CTTCTTCTTCTTC, complementary to the motif GANNNNGA were found earlier in
the studies of C. elegans muscle specific regulatory motifs
[26]. We found these motifs also from the mir-1 and mir124 1000 bp upstream sequences in C. elegans and C.
briggsae, thus strengthening the connection of these miRNAs with a muscle specific function in these two worms.
Computational identification of miRNA genes relies upon
the properties of known miRNAs such as the length of
mature miRNA and their hairpin precursor secondary
structure, together with high phylogenetic conservation of
some miRNAs [18,27,28]. The predictions based on the
miRNA hairpin sequence only are not very accurate and
tend to give a high number of false positives. Computational algorithms are also prone to false negatives and
may miss miRNAs that do not have clear homologs in
related species. The accuracy of the algorithms can be
improved by adding characteristics from miRNA flanking
sequence, such as scoring the sequence conservation and
characteristic motifs [11]. Ohler and his co-workers successfully applied knowledge about the motif CTCCGCCC
and its location upstream from the orthologous inde-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/105

pendently transcribed miRNA foldbacks to improve the
accuracy of the miRNA gene prediction. In our study, this
motif was found also from upstream of 10 C. elegans miRNAs located in the sense strand of an intron (data not
shown), thus suggesting that it could be used also to
improve prediction of the intronic miRNAs. In addition,
the motif GANNNNGA is highly conserved in the vicinity
of the miRNA starting site and equally frequent in the
upstream of all the miRNAs despite their genomic location, suggesting that it could be a useful additional characteristic for the search and computational prediction of
miRNA sequences.

Conclusion
To better understand the transcriptional regulation of
miRNAs, we searched for conserved sequence motifs from
the area 1000 bp upstream from all miRNAs independent
of their genomic location. We discovered one significant
sequence motif GANNNNGA, occurring in every miRNA
upstream sequence and having a conserved distribution in
the upstream sequences of all miRNAs of nematode
worms C. elegans and C. briggsae. It appears to be a common factor for the upstream regions of all miRNAs and is
concentrated in a proximal area near the beginning of the
miRNA precursor start sites. It may not be a transcription
factor binding site, but rather a co-factor site, or recognition sequence for miRNA processing. The abundance and
conservation of this motif in the upstream of two old and
important miRNAs, mir-1 and mir-124 suggest a connection to miRNAs with global specialized function. The
abundance and location of the GANNNNGA motif may
be of benefit in computational prediction of miRNAs.

Methods
Datasets
We downloaded from WormBase release WS160, 31 July
2006 [29] the sequences 1000 bp upstream from the
beginning of all available C. elegans and C. briggsae miRNAs. We considered as clustered those C. elegans miRNAs
that were less than 1000 bp distance from each other.
Seven clusters containing 23 miRNAs in total were found
and only the upstream sequence of one, upstream-most
miRNA from each cluster, was chosen to represent the
whole cluster. Thus, the number of C. elegans 1000 bp
miRNA upstream sequences was reduced from 116 to 100
while for C. briggsae, there were 95 miRNAs in all. In this
study, these two datasets were considered as putative
miRNA regulatory sequence sets. From the 100 C. elegans
miRNAs included into this study, 75 are located into the
noncoding area of the genome and 25 are located in the
gene coding area. We selected the 1000 bp upstream from
intergenic miRNAs, rather than from their host genes, in
order to find regulatory motifs specific for miRNA
sequences.

Motif extraction
Within both of our data sets we searched for short, overrepresented patterns to find putative regulation motifs.
For this purpose we used four motif finding tools available: POCO, Weeder, MEME and Gibbs Motif Sampler.
POCO [19], takes advantage of exhaustive search methods
and bootstrapping to find significant patterns composed
of the nucleotides A, C, G, T and N from a given data set
compared with the selected background organism. The
resulting patterns contain at least 4 known nucleotides in
steady places while the first or the last nucleotide must not
be the wildcard N. Thus, mismatches are allowed only in
fixed places in the pattern. All the full-length patterns and
their sub-patterns are automatically analyzed, so when the
maximum possible length of searched patterns, 8 bp, is
selected for pattern length, the output contains all significant patterns which are 4–8 bp long. We used POCO in
our miRNA upstream sequence motif analysis because
this kind of motif model has not been used earlier in similar studies [7,11-13], and so it could give a new perspective to the possible regulative elements of miRNA genes.
For the background organism to be used in the analysis we
chose C. elegans clean which contains the promoter
regions (downloaded from Ensmart [30], parameters:
known genes, one output per gene, 5' upstream only and
5' Flank 3000 bp [19]) of almost every gene in the C. elegans genome where sequences containing letters other
than A, C, G or T are removed. We chose the maximum 8
for pattern length and left all the remaining parameters as
default. Weeder [31,32] is an exhaustive enumeration
method for finding approximate occurrences of patterns.
Significance of the found motif is calculated against the
oligo frequency in the protein coding gene upstream
regions of the selected organism. We chose to use Weeder
in this study, because it has proved to perform well when
compared to other common motif finding tools [33]. We
ran Weeder with "quick" mode, and looked for motifs of
length 8 allowing 2 mutations. MEME [34] is a probabilistic local alignment based method for discovering degenerate sequence motifs. The significance of the found motif
is calculated against random sequences with the same
nucleotide composition as the query sequences, so the
motifs E-value refer to the expected number of motifs of
equal width with the same or higher likelihood in a random sequence set with the same size and nucleotide composition as the input sequence set. We used MEME
because it is used also in the other miRNA upstream motif
studies [7,11,13], which gives a possibility to compare the
results. In this study, MEME was launched to search
motifs with width 8 bp having any number of repetitions
in the input sequence set. The optional attributes were left
as default. The Gibbs Motif Sampler is a probabilistic,
alignment based approach for locating common motifs in
collections of sequences [35]. The Gibbs Recursive Sampler [36] is a version of Gibbs sampler, developed for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/105

locating multiple transcription factor binding sites simultaneously from unaligned heterogenous DNA sequences.
In this study, we launched the Gibbs Recursive Sampler
with the minimum attributes: the number of different
motifs was set to 3 and for each of them the initial width
estimate was set to 8, and the maximum number of sites
per sequence was set to 10. Even though the initial width
of the sites was entered as 8, the output sites had length of
8 or more, where 8 columns were conserved and the rest
of them were non-conserved.
Motif analysis
From POCO results for both worms, we chose such patterns that were found from every sequence in the putative
miRNA regulatory sequence sets, having p-values less than
0.05 and searched among them for patterns common to
both sets (for algorithm, see Additional file 3. These patterns were then aligned with ClustalW [37], (Additional
file 4).

The most significant motifs were located from the putative
miRNA regulatory region with Visualize tool of POXO
tool series [38], or Weeder Motif Locator included in MoD
Tools [32], allowing two mismatches to the consensus
sequence, and the position weight matrices were calculated from these results. The motif logos were created with
WebLogo [39] and Transfac and Jaspar databases were
searched for matching TFBSs with STAMP [21].
To test the statistical significances of the found motifs, we
generated 100 random 1000 bp long sequences with the
same nucleotide composition as C. elegans genome and
counted the motif occurrences from these sequences.
Then we calculated the p-values for the putative motifs
with the independent samples t-test.
The 1000 bp upstream sequences of human and mouse
miRNAs that belong to mir-1 and mir-124 families were
downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser [40], and the
multiple sequence alignments for the mir-1 and mir-124
families upstream sequences were made with ClustalW
[37].

miRNA microarray analysis
Wild type worms (strain N2) were fed with OP50 E. coli
on culturing plates containing Nematode Growth Media
(NGM) agar [41]. Animals were grown at 20°C, synchronized and harvested at Larva 4 (L4) stage. mirVanaTM
miRNA Isolation-protocol (Ambion Inc., Austin, Texas)
was used to isolate small (<200 nucleotide) RNAs containing miRNAs which were labeled using NCodeTM

the manufacturer's protocol. Labelled RNA was hybridized on NCodeTM Multi-Species miRNA Microarray V2arrays (Invitrogen) containing three sub arrays (technical
