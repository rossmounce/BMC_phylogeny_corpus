Abstract
Background: The results of transcriptome microarray analysis are usually presented as a list of
differentially expressed genes. As these lists can be long, it is hard to interpret the desired
experimental treatment effect on the physiology of analysed tissue, e.g. via selected metabolic or
other pathways. For some organisms, gene ontologies and data visualization software have been
implemented to overcome this problem, whereas for others, software adaptation is yet to be done.
Results: We present the classification of tentative potato contigs from the potato gene index
(StGI) available from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) into the MapMan ontology to enable the
application of the MapMan family of tools to potato microarrays. Special attention has been focused
on mapping genes that could not be annotated based on similarity to Arabidopsis genes alone, thus
possibly representing genes unique for potato. 97 such genes were classified into functional BINs
(i.e. functional classes) after manual annotation. A new pathway, focusing on biotic stress responses,
has been added and can be used for all other organisms for which mappings have been done. The
BIN representation on the potato 10 k cDNA microarray, in comparison with all putative potato
gene sequences, has been tested. The functionality of the prepared potato mapping was validated
with experimental data on plant response to viral infection. In total 43,408 unigenes were mapped
into 35 corresponding BINs.
Conclusion: The potato mappings can be used to visualize up-to-date, publicly available, expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) and other sequences from GenBank, in combination with metabolic pathways.
Further expert work on potato annotations will be needed with the ongoing EST and genome
sequencing of potato. The current MapMan application for potato is directly applicable for analysis
of data obtained on potato 10 k cDNA microarray by TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research)
but can also be used by researchers working on other potato gene sets. The potato mapping file
and the stress mapping diagram are available from the MapMan website [1].

Background
The output of microarray statistical data analysis is often
in the form of a list (or lists) of differentially expressed
genes. Depending on the null hypothesis that is being
tested and the experimental treatments that have been carried out, these lists can vary in length but often enough
these are too long for a rigorous manual inspection. This
poses a problem of complexity of interpretation. Lists can
be condensed by organising them according to their
known or suspected function, but this requires gene
ontologies, which cannot be automatically extended from
one organism to another, especially when they are not
closely related. In addition, transcriptome data analysis is
being combined with proteome (or metabolome) data
analysis which only adds to the complexity of interpretation. Development of new, more reliable methods of data
analysis and visualization will enable easier interpretation
of results and thus a greater contribution to explaining the
biological problem. Various visualization tools that help
the data analysts and the biologists are available today,
from GenMapp, Pathway Processor and GeneXpress
(reviewed in [2]) to KaPPA-View [3] and VANTED [4].
Using them, it is possible to find trends that would be less
apparent from using only lists of genes [5]. While they are
suitable for some organisms, their usefulness for plant
organisms can be restricted because they have often been
developed for microbial or animal systems and thus have
categories that are irrelevant for plant systems and lack
plant-specific pathways and processes [5,6].
MapMan organization
A plant-specific visualization tool, MapMan, has been
developed to overcome this problem. Initially it was
developed for genes from Arabidopsis thaliana that are
present on the Affymetrix 22 K array [6]. Its main purpose
is to organize and display experimental data sets or results
onto diagrams of the users' choice [5,6]. It consists of two
modules, (i) Scavenger module and (ii) ImageAnnotator.

The Scavenger module is a gene ontology, in which genes
are assigned based on their annotation into largely nonredundant and hierarchically organised BINs. Each BIN
consists of items of similar biological function and can be
further split into subBINs, corresponding to submodes of
the biological function [7]. The original BIN assignments
for A. thaliana were based on publicly available gene
annotations from TIGR (The Institute for Genomic
Research) using a process which involved alternation
between automatic recruitment and manual correction
[6]. The resulting BINs are shown in Table 1; these are broken down by current versions into > 1200 subBINs.
The ImageAnnotator module uses the classifications from
the Scavenger module in the form of mapping files in
order to display data on various diagrams of the user's

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/3/1/10

choice [5]. A mapping file for an organism includes, but is
not limited to, these categories: BIN code; BIN name;
identifier; description. The identifier includes gene names
or clone names with their descriptions, i.e. the names
which link the mapping file with the experiment file.
The ImageAnnotator also uses diagrams for data display.
They are obtained with the MapMan software [1] or can
be self-made and then included in MapMan as described
in [5].
Potato annotation
The potato genome has yet to be fully sequenced. Thus, at
present only an approximation of the potato transcriptome is available in the form of the potato gene index that
contains expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from diverse tissues. The potato gene index (StGI [8]) clusters ESTs into
tentative contigs (TCs) after removing low quality ESTs
[9]. The information in StGI is constantly being updated,
with 13 releases since July 2000. Not all gene functions
within gene indices are well characterized. The StGI database contains clone sequence data (in GenBank) and the
corresponding tentative consensus sequence (TC) of the
clones that theoretically represent one gene.

The TIGR potato 10 k array is the only microarray platform that is currently publicly available for researchers
studying potato. Together with several control clones, the
microarray contains 15,264 clones. Each cDNA clone is
spotted in two spatially separated replicates thus summing up to 30,528 spots on each microarray. For a general
purpose microarray design it is expected that clones from
every BIN should be present on the microarray.
We found MapMan implementation for potato beneficial
as it will facilitate biological interpretation, support an
ontology-based statistical data analysis (see e.g. [10]) and
provide users a global overview of the results. We have
also added a new mapping of plant's response to biotic
stress in order to facilitate the studies of biotic interactions.

Results and Discussion
Given the usability of potato microarrays in various
potato experimental systems, [11-13], we have implemented MapMan to visualize potato transcriptomic data.
The sequences and the annotations of the potato gene
index (Solanum tuberosum gene index, StGI) version 10
were BLASTed against Arabidopsis proteins (release TAIR
6). In this way, every potato clone was assigned up to ten
best matching Arabidopsis proteins.
The Arabidopsis proteome was chosen for comparison
because (i) the original MapMan Scavenger module was
constructed for Arabidopsis, (ii) the Arabidopsis genome

Some of the problems encountered in converting MapMan for a potato clone set were due to species-specific differences in the metabolism. Further, potato is a model
organism for plant-pathogen interactions and for physiological processes like tuberization, dormancy and sprouting [14]. Therefore expert input is needed for more
detailed BIN structuring and for preparing schemes for
such specific processes.
The final mapping file had 43,408 entries that represent
the 38,239 different sequences in the potato gene index;
of these 15,817 (around 36%) are present on the TIGR
potato 10 k microarray. The percentage of clones in a BIN
compared to all StGI clones, as well as the numbers of
clones from a BIN that are present on the 10 k microarray,
are shown in Table 1.

has been fully sequenced and (iii) potato is phylogenetically most similar to Arabidopsis among plant species
with known genomes. BLASTing results were put into a
file which was modified in order to contain the potato
unigene name and its annotation from StGI, the protein
domain description from StGI, the best matching Arabidopsis gene names and the corresponding E value, and
information on the presence of the clone on the TIGR
potato 10 k microarray, and the BIN assignment from Arabidopsis in order to match the original BIN assignment
for every gene name. Potato clone annotations were
checked manually with the matching Arabidopsis entry; if
it differed and the E value was reasonably low (threshold
10-15), the BIN assignment was left as for Arabidopsis.
When E values were higher than the chosen threshold
(between 10-10 and 10-15), clones were assigned manually
to corresponding BINs, on the basis of sequence and literature
searches.

Classifying biotic stress responses in potato
In order to enable easier data visualization and interpretation of gene expression in potato – virus and other biotic
interactions, the genes which had been classified as potentially being involved in biotic stress (BIN 20.1) were further subdivided into respiratory burst, receptors,
signalling, kinases, regulation of transcription, heat shock
proteins, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, secondary
metabolism and miscellaneous functions. A sub-subBIN
comprising proteinase inhibitors was added to a subBIN
of PR proteins. New subBINs reflect the pathogen's signal
transduction pathway and the plant's response to infection (Figure 1). Since some genes that are involved in
response to stress, e.g. proteinase inhibitors, are involved
in constitutive processes as well [15], the classification
was based on the level of involvement of the gene (e.g.
recognition, signalling etc.) rather than on its molecular
function. 509 unigenes were mapped into BIN 20.1. Of
those, slightly over 50% belong to receptors subBIN, con-

sisting of several putative R (resistance) genes and 30% to
subBINs consisting of PR proteins (Table 2).

• no decision made about their ontology yet, despite having some annotation (subBIN 35.1),

Proteinase inhibitors play an important role in plant
defence mechanisms [15] against pathogens and pests.
These were also mapped together and can now be found
in BIN 29.5.15 (protein.degradation.inhibitors) which
has 49 entries that were originally distributed between
five proteinase BINs: cysteine, serine, aspartate, metalloprotease and ubiquitin. A large proportion of this BIN is
also annotated to BIN 20.1.7.6, what was considered
appropriate due to their involvement in "common" physiology as well as biotic stress responses.

• and having a low similarity to characterized Arabidopsis
genes (subBIN 35.2).

This improvement of the structure of BIN 20.1 (biotic
stress) provides a more detailed biotic stress scheme (Figure 1), allowing various stages of a plant's response to
biotic stress can be investigated. Previously, biotic stress
subBINs were not classified, which made it more difficult
for the experimenter to differentiate between different
stages of biotic stress response. Along with subBINs of the
BIN 20.1, BINs containing genes that are putatively
involved in plant response to pathogen or pest attack,
were added to the scheme. These include genes involved
in hormone signalling, signalling, redox state, cell wall,
protein degradation [16], heat shock proteins [17] (BINs
17, 30, 21, 10, 29.5, 20.2.1 respectively), and a family of
selected transcription factors [18]. Bin 20.2, containing
genes involved in abiotic stress is also shown on the
scheme, since it may contain general stress related genes.

From the 1582 clones assigned to BIN 35.1, that are represented on the potato 10 k microarray, 52 clones were
assigned to corresponding BINs in the case where the
potato annotation (together with high homology and
coverage) was more specific than that for Arabidopsis. Of
these 52 clones, eight were annotated to more than one
subBIN. The majority of newly assigned clones belonged
to BIN 20, which is not surprising since, in the current
work, the emphasis was put on this group of genes.
The clones with E values > 10-10 after BLASTing against the
Arabidopsis protein set are candidates for unique potato
genes. Initially they were all mapped to BIN 35.2, and we
focused on classifying them, especially those present on
the potato 10 k array. The clones were mapped to the
appropriate BINs using TIGR annotation of the corresponding TC and NCBI BLASTx search results (nr database), together with literature survey.
From 4,687 clones that were originally mapped to BIN
35.2 and are present on the potato 10 k microarray,
• 2,972 had low similarity to Arabidopsis sequences –
group I
• 1705 were similar to Arabidopsis sequences coding for
proteins annotated only as "expressed_proteins", and that
could not be mapped into other existing bins – group II

97 clones from subBIN 35.2 were mapped to more appropriate BINs. The majority of the newly mapped clones
were potato or other Solanaceae-specific (Table 3). Taking
into account our special focus on genes involved in the
biotic stress, the majority of the newly annotated clones
(35) were mapped to BIN 20.1 and its subBINs. Examples
of Solanaceae specific transcripts include genes for metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor, a potato PR-10a protein
[19], several potato cysteine proteinase inhibitors [15]
and potato polyphenol oxidase.
BIN representation on the potato microarray
Since TIGR potato 10 k cDNA microarrays are used by several researchers working on potato and other Solanaceae
species, we investigated how various BINs and subBINs
are represented on the potato microarray.

Globally, around 36% (15,817 out of 43,408) of potato
sequences from the StGI database are present on the
potato microarray. Twelve BINs out of 33 (see Table 1 in

Changes in expression during responses of plant samples to pathogens. The plant's reaction to biotic stress involves
a few steps: after the initial signal input from the pathogen which is recognized by the related receptors (putative R genes),
transcription of the cascade of the plant defence mechanism is triggered, including oxidative stress changes. Inside the cell, signals are transmitted to lead to the production of defence molecules (PR-proteins, heat shock proteins and secondary metabolites). Genes with experimental indication of involvement in the biotic stress are gathered on the main panel (coloured with

bold) are completely covered (BIN and all the subBINs)
on the microarray. In other words, at least one clone from
every BIN and its corresponding subBINs mentioned
above are present on the microarray. There were only
minor discrepancies such as (i) very small subBINs with
few entries that had no 10 k microarray clone representative (e.g. 26.09 misc.glutathione S transferases with 1
entry), or (ii) half of a sub-subBIN is sometimes being
missing on the microarray (e.g. subBIN 17.3.1.01 hormone
metabolism.brassinosteroid.synthesis-degradation.reductase). This kind of discrepancy, where some
subBINs are completely missing on the microarray while
others are fully present, is usually found in sub-subBINs,
representing single enzymatic functions, and not at the
higher hierarchical BIN splits. Consequently, we can say
that, in general, BIN representation is well covered on the
TIGR microarray, enabling investigation of various physiological issues. Some improvements in this aspect could
be incorporated in the next versions of TIGR potato
microarrays.
Experimental data
To present the functionality of potato mapping for MapMan, we explored two experiments, by which the complexity of the pathogen vs. plant interaction was assessed.
Since plant responses to pathogen attack are still far from
being completely understood [20], these experiments provide a useful insight into their reaction to pathogen infection.

A simple comparative design experiment was conducted
in which, in the first experiment, a potato cultivar resistant
to potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN) was tested. To show the versatility of the biotic stress pathway, a second, previously
published [21] experiment was reexamined, in which coyote tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata) plants were tested for
their reaction to a herbivore insect, Manduca secta. The

aim of both experiments was to investigate on plant's
involvement in biotic stress response on the transcriptome level. In both experiments, plants were divided in
two groups; being virus-inoculated or insect-treated and
the other half being mock-inoculated or non-treated in
the case of potato or tobacco experiment, respectively.
Potato and tobacco plants were harvested 30 minutes and
24 hours post infection, respectively. While the potato
experiment was performed in-house, the raw data for the
tobacco experiment was downloaded from the SGED
database, in which currently around 50 Solanaceae studies are deposited [22]. Three biological replicates for a
virus and a mock infected sample were analysed using the
TIGR potato 10 k microarray. Data were analyzed using R
statistical software with the limma package [23]. The output of the analysis, a list of possible differentially
expressed genes (p < 0.05), with their respective M values,
was visualized using MapMan (Figure 1a and 1b). Instead
of having to analyze each gene separately, the difference in
expression can be now visualized for a whole BIN. Biological hypotheses can thus be confirmed or rejected, since a
larger picture, that includes all the differentially expressed
genes, is seen.
For the potato PVYNTN experiment, 575 clones were differentially expressed, of which 16 belong to the biotic stress
response pathway (Figure 1a). It is easily seen that the
clones belonging to the beginning (putative R genes) and
the end (PR-proteins) of the pathway are mostly downregulated after viral infection. Moreover several other genes
putatively involved in biotic stress (such as heat shock
proteins and transcription factors), together with genes
involved in abiotic stress, have mostly been downregulated. This intriguing result becomes immedeatly obvious
after inspecting the provided figure or by looking at
changed categories. These subBINs had a low p-value for
Wilcoxon rank sum test which confirmes that the average
response of a BIN is different from the response of all the
other BINs [5]. It seems that 30 minutes post infection is
too early for a plant to establish real defence response. At
this time genes that are involved in other processes are
upregulated (data not shown). This result is in concordance with previously published studies involving cucumber mosaic virus infection to Arabidopsis thaliana where at
early stages of response, most of the significantly
expressed genes were downregulated [24]. Additional
experiments should be performed in order to confirm this
hypothesis.
A list of 875 differentially expressed clones was obtained
after M. secta attack on N. attenuata. Their involvement in
biotic stress pathway is presented on Figure 1b. Here, in
contrast to the potato experiment, genes that are represented on our biotic stress pathway (10 clones) are almost
all upregulated. Moreover, several other genes that are

Plant Methods 2007, 3:10

deeply involved in plant-pest interaction, namely jasmonic acid pathway and genes involved in secondary
metabolites synthesis were upregulated as discussed in
[21]. However, whereas previously candidate genes had to
be examined separately and functional classes had to be
assigned based on the annotation, now this can be done
with a few mouse-clicks by simple pasting lists [10,25]. As
we see a quantitatively similar response as previously
described, the adaptation of MapMan will help in classifying genes from potato and thus speed up array analysis
significantly especially in the area of pathogen interaction.
A more thorough examination of the results could lead to
formation of interesting biological hypotheses on the
mechanism of resistance/reaction to virus/insect infection. The observed difference in the two responses might
be attributed to different experimental systems: different
plants, stressors and most importantly, time after treatment. It seems that in early response to pathogen, plant
defence
have
not
yet
been
activated.

Conclusion
Tools that integrate microarray data with biological processes in which the genes are involved have been developed mostly for human and microorganism microarrays.
Consequently, they do not include processes and metabolic pathways specific for plants (e.g. photosynthesis)
and they can-not be used to visualize data obtained by
plant microarrays. Additionally, plants are remarkably
diverse and therefore additional pathways may need to be
implemented for each species. Tools that are specific for
plant metabolism have been developed [2-4] but many of
them have been Arabidopsis-specific. MapMan is different
as it is more flexible, enabling any organism to be mapped
to the existing MapMan ontologies. It has already been
adapted for use with tomato [7] and Medicago [26]. With
the implementation of potato mappings to MapMan, visualization and interpretation of more complex biological
data from experiments performed on potato will be easier.
As current trends in molecular biology are focused on connecting results from different levels of '-omics' data analysis (e.g. transcriptomic with metabolomic data analysis),
this will be possible with potato experiments too, since
MapMan enables the visualization of trancriptomic and
metabolomic data simultaneously [5,6]. Conversly, it will
be possible to use our improved dissection of biotic stress
in BIN 20.1 and the schematic representation of the
plant's response to infection for MapMan mappings in
other species (Arabidopsis, tomato, Medicago). Thus the
results of complex analysis can be interpreted on an additional level, and biotic stress responses in different experimental systems can be compared. This can increase the
understanding of plant response to pathogen or pest
attack.

Methods
BLAST
The sequences and the annotations of the potato gene
index (Solanum tuberosum gene index, StGI) version 10
were downloaded from the StGI database (38,239 unique
potato unigene identfiers). The unigenes sequences were
then BLASTed (BLASTx, version 2.2.14) against Arabidopsis proteins release TAIR 6 (file TAIR6_pep_20051108,
available from [27]) under default settings. In this way,
every potato clone was assigned up to ten best matching
Arabidopsis genes. The complete mapping file had 43,408
entries.
Annotations
Following BLASTing, the file was modified in order to
contain only the potato unigene name and its annotation
from StGI, the protein domain description from StGI, if
any, the best matching Arabidopsis gene names and the
corresponding E value. The information on the presence
of the clone on the TIGR potato 10 k microarray was
included, where an extra column to the final output data
was added, showing the potato clone name if present on
the microarray. The BIN assignment from Arabidopsis was
also included in order to match the original BIN assignment for every gene name.
Manual annotation evaluation
Every potato clone annotation which was derived from its
corresponding tentative contig, was checked manually in
order to compare it with the description of the matching
Arabidopsis entry. If it differed from the Arabidopsis
description, the E value was checked. If the E value was
reasonably low (threshold was chosen at 10-15), the BIN
assignment was left as for Arabidopsis. When E values
were higher than the chosen threshold (between 10-10 and
10-15), clones were assigned manually to corresponding
BINs, on the basis of sequence (NCBI BLASTx, nr database), protein domain information (PFAM [28], SMART
[29]) and TIGR annotation. An additional literature survey was performed when needed. Where appropriate, BIN
assignments were changed for original Arabidopsis mappings as well.
Array analysis
A simple comparisons design analysis was applied (virus
infected/insect treated versus mock inoculated/untreated
samples). All calculations were done in limma software
package for R with the limma package [23,30]. Two normalizations were performed, loess [31] and vsn [32]. The
intersection of genes, resulting as differentially expressed
both by applying loess and vsn normalization were used
for further analysis.

Adaptation of the MapMan ontology to biotic stress
BIN 20.1 (biotic stress) has been further divided into subBINs based on previous knowledge about plant's response
to pathogen infection and pest attack.

New subBINs for proteinase inhibitors have been added
to BIN 29, protein degradation.
Special attention was drawn to BINs 35.1 not assigned.no
ontology and 35.2 not assigned.unknown. The latter consisted of clones with E values > 10-10 after BLASTing.
Clones from this BIN that are present on the TIGR potato
10 k microarray were checked manually and, where
appropriate, were assigned to corresponding BINs as
described above.
Pictorial representation of stress responses in MapMan
A new biotic stress pathway showing also putative
involvement in stress response was constructed using our
in-house expert knowledge about the involved stress processes [33]. BINs were assigned to each part of the pathway
after importing the image to MapMan. The procedure is
described in [5]. In short, a mouse click on the selected
location on the pathway opens a pop-up dialog box where
the BIN and subBIN codes are entered. This is repeated for
all BINs and subBINs that are to be represented on the display. The resulting assignments are stored as an .xml file
which is linked to the map image.

Authors' contributions
AR participated in performing BLAST and initial annotations, did most of the manual annotations and corrections, participated in designing biotic stress pathway, did
the statistical analysis and wrote the paper. BU did BLAST
and initial annotations, confirmed the proposed corrections and put expert knowledge into mapping the clone
names. ŠB performed the biological experiment, participated in manual annotation, especially focusing on BINs
20.1, 29.5.15 and 35.2 and organized the biotic stress
pathway. MS put expert biological knowledge into the
evaluation of the results. KG originated the study, put
expert biological knowledge into certain mappings and
designed the biotic stress pathway. All authors edited,
read and approved the final manuscript.
