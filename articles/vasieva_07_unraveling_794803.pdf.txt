Background
Prediction of the role of one protein in a network of regulatory and metabolic interactions involves analysis of
many complex data sets in their interference, as no experimental source along is completely and generally reliable.
To discriminate the most promising pathways related to a
protein of interest from background noise we integrate
multiple bioinformatics data by means of a graphical
designer/database of protein-protein interactions supported by data mining and logical modeling of resulted
networks.

Materials and methods
The SEED database http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/
index.cgi is an open-source genomic platform provided by
the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) http:/
/www.figresearch.com/, which supports the encoding and
projection of metabolic subsystems across the entire collection of integrated genomes. It provides two similar but
distinguished approaches which were applied to compare
chromosome regions. The first method 'Compare region'
is similar to one applied to analysis of clustering of functionally related genes on the prokaryotic chromosome
[4,6]. The approach involves computation of "pairs of
close bidirectional best hits. Using these pairs, one can
compose evidence (based on the number of distinct
genomes and the phylogenetic distance between the
orthologous pairs) that a pair of genes is potentially functionally coupled. Another approach underlies 'Pinned
regions' resource. It allows one to align chromosome loci
that contain open reading frames for homologous proteins, or, in other words: to 'pin' these loci through

homologous genes. Similarity threshold can be customized.
Gene Spring was used for an initial analysis of micro array
data; Seed and NCBI databases-for the analysis of
sequences derived from Two-Hybrid experiments. All data
were integrated by means of PathBlazer https://bioinfor
matics.ccr.buffalo.edu/software/vector.

Results and conclusions
In a process of a network reconstruction we have been
evaluating predictive capacities of three data sources: gene
expression data, potential protein-protein interaction data
derived in two-hybrid system experiments and gene positional clustering [4,5] to show that gene co-localization
on a chromosome can be a reliable indication for a functional relevance between the encoded proteins.
We demonstrate a capability of the SEED database and its
unique tools for eukaryotic chromosome loci alignment
and phylogenetic analysis to serve in retrieval of conservative gene patterns and uncovering of potential functional
partners of a protein of interest (see Figure 1).
Here we present procedures of unraveling the functional
connections between sirtuin family proteins [1] and NFkappaB regulatory network [2], and the GSTPi [3] function as a carrier of Nitric oxide and Iron complex in the
regulation of mitochondrial respiration.
