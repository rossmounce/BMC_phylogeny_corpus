Abstract
Background: Roo is the most abundant retrotransposon in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Its
evolutionary origins and dynamics are thus of special interest for understanding the evolutionary
history of Drosophila genome organization. We here study the phylogenetic distribution and
evolution of roo, and its highly diverged relative rooA in 12 completely sequenced genomes of the
genus Drosophila.
Results: We identify a total of 164 roo copies, 57 of which were previously unidentified copies that
occur in 9 of the 12 genomes. Additionally we find 66 rooA copies in four genomes and remnants
of this element in two additional genomes. We further increased the number of elements by
searching for individual roo/rooA sequence domains. Most of our roo and rooA elements have been
recently inserted. Most elements within a genome are highly similar. A comparison of the
phylogenetic tree of our roo and rooA elements shows that the split between roo and rooA took place
early in Drosophila evolution. Furthermore there is one incongruency between the species tree and
the phylogenetic tree of the roo element. This incongruency regards the placement of elements
from D. mojavensis, which are more closely related to D. melanogaster than elements from D.
willistoni.
Conclusion: Within genomes, the evolutionary dynamics of roo and rooA range from recent
transpositional activity to slow decay and extinction. Among genomes, the balance of phylogenetic
evidence, sequence divergence distribution, and the occurrence of solo-LTR elements suggests an
origin of roo/rooA within the Drosophila clade. We discuss the possibility of a horizontal gene transfer
of roo within this clade.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that
have the ability to replicate within a genome using a variety of mechanisms [1]. They are present in almost all
eukaryotic genomes, and they play an important role in
genome evolution by creating genetic variation through

their mobility. Most new transposable element insertions
have a negative effect on the host's fitness through insertions in genes or regulatory regions [2,3], or through
ectopic recombination between two copies of an element
[4]. For this reason, their transpositial activity is regulated
and suppressed by various host encoded mechanisms, like

cytosine methylation [5], repeat induced point mutations
[6], and expression silencing by RNA interference [7,8].
The number of active copies also decreases due to random
mutations, excision, purifying selection, and stochastic
loss [2].
TEs can be divided into two classes (I and II) based on
their replication mechanism. Class I elements use an RNA
intermediate for transposition and are called retrotransposons. They can be further subdivided into LTR and nonLTR elements, named after the presence or absence of long
terminal repeat (LTR) sequences in the element. Class II
elements use a DNA intermediate and are therefore called
DNA transposons [1]. Although TEs are mainly transmitted vertically from parent to offspring, they also have the
ability to invade new genomes and even cross species
boundaries through horizontal gene transfer. In D. melanogaster class I and II TEs occupy around 5.35 percent of
the euchromatin part of the genome [9], with the LTR element roo being the most abundant element [10,11]. Roo
differs from most other LTR elements in that it encodes an
envelope (env) gene in addition to the gag and pol genes
encoded by most LTR elements [12]. The origin of roo's env
gene is not completely clear. It might have been captured
from retroviruses, where the gene encodes an envelope
glycoprotein that is important for the infectivity of the
virus, or it might have been lost from most LTR elements
other than roo. Aside from roo, only a few other LTR elements harbor an env protein. With the exception of the env
gene in the LTR element gypsy, the proteins encoded by env
in LTR retrotransposons are thought to be non-functional.
Roo was first identified by Scherer et al. under the name
B104 [13] and by Meyerowitz and Hogness as roo [14].
The element is 9092 basepairs (bp) long. It contains one
open reading frame (ORF) with 7083 nucleotides that
comprise the gag, pol and env genes. The structure of the
element is shown in Figure 1a. The element is strongly
expressed during embryogenesis and is responsible for
gene mutations [15].
Frequent ectopic recombinations between roo elements
cause chromosome rearrangements [4]. So far, roo has
only been identified in a few species belonging to the melanogaster subgroup [16], and one horizontal transfer
event between D. melanogaster and D. simulans has been
suggested [17]. An anciently diverged relative of roo is
rooA, which also has members in D. melanogaster. In this
subfamily, the internal coding region is only ~62 percent
identical to the coding region of roo. The rooA subfamily
was probably active in the D. melanogaster genome ~2.5
myr ago [18]. In contrast to the high copy number of roo,
only a few rooA elements were previously identified in the
D. melanogaster genome [11]. These elements are mostly
short fragments and up to now, no complete rooA element
has been identified.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

Roo's high abundance makes it a prominent constituent of
mobile DNA in Drosophila. This fact, and the existence of
a diverged subfamily renders the element worthy of study.
We here use the 12 sequenced Drosophila genomes [9] to
study the evolutionary dynamics of roo and rooA on different timescales. Specifically, we explore these evolutionary
dynamics within and among genomes, including likely
transmission routes, and we examine the origin of the
common ancestor of all roo/rooA elements.

Results
Distribution of Roo elements
We first used an iterative approach to identify all roo and
rooA elements in the currently available 12 sequenced
Drosophila genomes [9]. This approach (see Methods for
details) used the canonical Drosophila roo and rooA elements as query sequences to identify a series of additional
elements in the Drosophila genomes. These additional elements then served as queries in further search rounds,
which were continued until no further roo/rooA elements
could be identified. To identify more diverged elements,
we used the 157 high confidence elements identified
through this iterative search as initial queries for a second
search with less stringent search parameters. Because roo
and rooA query sequences can identify members of both
families, we separated all identified elements based on
their similarity to the roo and rooA canonical element.
While most elements in D. mojavensis correspond to roo
elements, one element shared a higher similarity to the
canonical rooA element. All other identified rooA elements, however, are much more similar to the rooA
canonical sequence than this one element. We mention
this element, because its dubious affiliation affects the
evolutionary scenarios we discuss below.

Our combined search approach (round one and two)
yielded a total of 230 elements, 164 roo and 66 rooA elements, that occurred in nine out of the 12 genomes (see
Additional file 1). Columns 2 and 5 of table 1 display the
number of roo and rooA elements, respectively, in each
genome, as does Figure 1b in the context of the Drosophila
phylogeny. Table 1 also lists the number of probably
active elements (full-length, no frameshift, no stopcodon). The distribution of elements is different between
the two subfamilies. For example, while the D. melanogaster genome is the most roo-rich genome, harboring
107 elements (two thirds of all identified roo elements), it
is D. erecta that harbors most rooA elements (44 copies).
Overall, we identified roo elements in nine out of the 12
genomes, but found rooA elements in only four genomes.
We now briefly highlight some features of roo's distribution. The two species most closely related to D. melanogaster are the sister species D. simulans and D. sechellia.
In contrast to the large number of roo copies in D. melanogaster, we find only 16 roo copies in D. sechellia, and

For each genome (column 1 from the left), column 2 shows the total number of identified roo elements, with the number of functional copies after
the slash. Column 3 shows the number of identified solo-LTRs, which have a similarity of at least 70 percent and a length difference of less than 10
percent to a roo LTR sequence. The calculation of the average insertion time (column 4) is based on the divergence between the two LTR
sequences of every element. Columns 5â7 represent the same data for the rooA element; myr: million years; func: functional;

only one fragmented copy in D. simulans. We want to note
that the genome of D. sechellia is not assembled and that
the copy number might, therefore, be lower.
Like D. simulans and D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and
D. persimilis are very closely related (Figure 1b). We found
no roo elements in D. pseudoobscura, and only one in D.
persimilis. This sole element is highly diverged, contains
multiple small ORFs as well as a frameshift mutation, and
has only 63 percent of the length of the canonical roo element. The element may thus be a remnant of a functional
roo element. The absence of additional roo copies in this
genome indicates that roo is in the process of being eliminated from the genome.
The roo copies in D. mojavensis deserve special mention.
This species is, together with D. virilis and D. grimshawi,
one of the most distantly related species to D. melanogaster. The latter two species harbor no roo elements, but
D. mojavensis harbors 12 copies, of which at least one copy
may be functional. This tentative assessment is based on
the element's complete coding sequence and the absence
of frameshifts and stop codons.
With respect to the distribution of rooA, we note that the
sister species D. yakuba and D. erecta contain the vast
majority of rooA elements. Before our analysis, no rooA
element had been identified outside the D. melanogaster
genome, and none of the previously identified elements
are full length [11]. While none of the elements in D.
yakuba are full length, D. erecta contains at least one full
length and probably functional element. Compared to

other elements, this element has a 271 amino acid duplication in its coding region, but has only one open reading
frame (ORF), and shows no frameshift mutations or internal stop codon. We also note that we did not identify any
rooA elements in D. melanogaster, the species where it was
first identified. The flybase annotation of the D. melanogaster genome (release 4.1) lists five rooA elements. Four
of these copies are, however, very short and one element
has an extremely diverged coding region, so that our
search procedure would not identify it.
Solo-LTRs indicate loss of roo/rooA in some species
An individual LTR retrotransposon can most easily get lost
from a genome via a recombination event between the
two LTR repeat units. The remnant of such a recombination event is a solo-LTR, a single remaining LTR repeat
unit [19]. Instances of solo-LTRs have been reported for
roo elements [20]. In order to find out whether some
genomes may have lost all their roo or rooA elements, we
searched for roo and rooA solo-LTR elements in the twelve
genomes.

To identify these elements, we performed a stringent blast
search [21], using each LTR sequence of all previously
identified roo and rooA elements as queries. We only
excluded LTR sequences as queries that were shorter than
200 bp and that contained an "N" (unidentified nucleotide) at more than half of their nucleotides in the
genome sequence. This procedure led us to exclude 26
(out of 328) roo LTRs and 22 (out of 132) rooA LTR
sequences as queries. Each identified solo-LTR had to
show at least 70 percent identity to the query sequence,

and deviate in its length by no more than 10 percent from
it. Table 1 (columns 3 and 6) shows the number of identified solo-LTR sequences for each genome.

there is a high turnover of elements within a genome. The
high number of solo-LTRs we observe is evidence for such
high turnover.

In addition to solo-LTRs in the genomes that contained
roo elements, we found 33 solo-LTRs in D. pseudoobscura.
These observations validate the above assertion that roo
has become extinct from the genome of D. pseudoobscura.
A similar extinction process may still be ongoing in the
highly mutated sole remaining element of D. persimilis.

The median age of insertion of all roo elements in this
analysis is below the detection limit of 0.05 myr obtainable from divergence data, indicating that most roo elements were inserted less than a million years ago, as
indicated in the bottom right panel of Figure 2. However,
there are significant differences in the roo age distribution
among species. In D. melanogaster, the species with most
roo elements, the vast majority of elements are young, a
pattern that is most striking with its more than 100 roo elements. Specifically, more than half of the D. melanogaster
elements have identical LTR sequences, indicating very
recent insertion. The median element age is below the
detection limit of 0.05 myr. The oldest identified element
has inserted only approximately 0.6 myr ago. The Drosophila melanogaster roo elements thus underwent many
recent transpositions. The median age is even lower than
that estimated in previous work [10]. The high LTR identity of the roo element is not unusual for LTR elements in
D. melanogaster. It also occurs for other LTR elements in
Drosophila melanogaster like copia, blood or 412 [10,20]. In
D. melanogaster the median insertion time for every analyzed LTR element family was less than 0.11 myr ago.

In contrast to roo solo-LTRs, rooA solo-LTRs occur only in
species within the melanogaster subgroup, with one
exception: Solo-LTRs in D. mojavensis, which were all
identified by the two LTR sequences of the single rooA element in this species. The number of rooA solo-LTRs varies
significantly between the different species in the melanogaster subgroup: Whereas D. melanogaster only harbors
55 copies, D. yakuba harbors more than 3000 solo-LTRs.
The only two genomes that did not contain any solo-LTRs
for either roo or rooA are D. virilis and D. grimshawi.
LTR divergence indicates that most roo elements have
been recently inserted
Because the two LTR sequences of a retrotransposon are
identical at the time of insertion, their divergence can be
used to estimate an element's age, the time since insertion
[22]. Highly similar LTR sequences suggest that an element was only recently inserted, because too little time
elapsed for many mutations to accumulate between them.
From alignments of the LTR sequences of each roo/rooA
element, excluding elements with unidentified nucleotides in their sequences, we estimated the intra-element
LTR divergence. We then used this information, together
with the synonymous substitution rate of 0.016 substitutions per site per million years (myr) for Drosophila [23],
to estimate the age distribution of roo/rooA elements. The
median estimated time since insertion for the elements is
shown in Table 1 (column 4 and 7 for roo and rooA elements, respectively) for each genome, and the full age distribution is shown in Figure 2 for roo and rooA in red and
blue bars, respectively. These insertion times have to be
considered with caution, because it is possible that transposable elements may experience gene conversion
[24,25], which compromise this molecular clock. (For
instance, the LTR sequences of D. ananassae are identical
despite high divergence in their coding regions, a disagreement that might be explained by gene conversion of the
LTR sequences.) We, therefore, also show the distance distribution itself (Additional file 2). We want to point out
that the insertion time of an element is not the same as the
age of the element in the species. Even if all elements in
one species appear recently inserted, the element may
have resided in the genome for a long time, for example if

In species other than D. melanogaster, the insertion time
distributions for roo are highly variable. For example, all
five roo elements from D. ananassae have identical LTR
sequences. The roo elements in D. sechellia are very similar
to those in D. melanogaster, but here only two elements
have identical LTR sequences, and the insertion times are
more diverse, which suggests that no recent replication
activity took place. Finally, in D. mojavensis the median roo
insertion age is 0.09 myr.
The age distribution of rooA elements is also quite diverse.
D. erecta, the species with the highest abundance of 44
rooA elements, also shows many young elements but the
insertion time distribution is broader than for roo in D.
melanogaster. For example, ten out of the 44 identified
rooA elements in D. erecta have identical LTR sequence,
and may have, therefore, been inserted recently, but the
oldest element is already approximately 4.1 myr old. The
median insertion time, however, is only 0.16 million
years ago, which indicates that rooA was recently active in
this species, and that it might still be spreading. Despite
the young age of most elements, the majority of elements
may be non-functional, as suggested by the fact that they
have only 25 percent of the length of the canonical element, and that some elements also carry stop codons in
the coding region. These observations suggest that passive
spreading via intact helper elements plays a role in rooA
proliferation.

In contrast to D. erecta, the rooA elements in D. yakuba
have a much higher insertion age (median: 1.02 myr).
Most D. yakuba rooA elements also have frameshift mutations or stop codons in their coding region. Because D.
yakuba also shows no signs of recent transposition activity
(Figure 2), we speculate that the rooA element may be in
the process of being deleted from this genome. The putative rooA element in D. mojavensis is already 1.5 myr old,
in contrast to this genome's roo elements, which have
been recently inserted.

Table 3: Average protein similarity between rooA elements

Taken together, the age distribution of rooA is broader
than that of roo.

expected from our LTR analysis, within-species divergence
is generally very low, suggesting either recent acquisition
or high turnover of roo elements within genomes.

Intra- and inter species divergence
We next compared the sequence divergence of different
elements within and among species. Such a comparison
may yield additional information about the evolutionary
dynamics of the roo/rooA elements. Specifically, we estimated the percent similarity between their protein coding
sequences using a maximum likelihood approach implemented in the package Phylip[26]. Because similarity
estimation requires coding sequence information, we
only used the 134 elements (123 roo and 11 rooA elements) with a coding sequence length spanning at least
half the coding sequence of the canonical element (1180
aa). Most elements with shorter coding sequence are
highly diverged and contain several short ORFs interrupted by stop codons and/or frameshift mutations. As a
result of this length threshold, we were able to include 10
(of 16) roo elements from D. sechellia, 97 (of 107) from D.
melanogaster, 1 (of 7) from D. yakuba, all from D. ananassae, 3 (of 14) from D. willistoni and 7 (of 12) from D.
mojavensis, and no elements from D. simulans, erecta, and
D. persimilis. For rooA, we were able to use 2 (of 18) rooA
elements from D. yakuba, and 8 (of 44) elements from D.
erecta, the single element in D. mojavensis.

Tables 2 and 3 show the percent similarity for roo and rooA
elements, respectively, between elements within the same
species (diagonal), and among species (off-diagonal). As

One conspicuous pattern is that roo elements in D.
mojavensis are 10 percent more similar to elements in D.
melanogaster than to elements from the more closely
related D. ananassae and D. willistoni. This observation is
strictly speaking inconsistent with the Drosophila species
tree in Figure 1b. However, its weight is reduced if one
considers that the similarities between roo elements in D.
melanogaster on one hand, and D. ananassae, D. willistoni
and D. mojavensis on the other hand, are of comparable
magnitude.
Phylogenetic incongruence between roo and species tree
We next constructed and manually inspected a multiple
alignment of the protein sequences of roo's and rooA's coding regions. To create a maximum likelihood phylogenetic
tree of the roo/rooA elements from this alignment, we used
PhyML_aLRT[27], a version of PhyML[28] that incorporates an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the
statistical support of the tree topology. Furthermore we
used the canonical sequence of the BEL element [GenBank:U23420] from D. melanogaster as outgroup. The
phylogenetic tree of the roo/rooA elements is shown in Figure 3. Because of the high number of elements the terminal clades are collapsed. The black triangle at the end of
each terminal clade indicates the divergence of the elements within a clade or species. Additional file 3 shows
the complete tree. Roo and rooA elements are clearly distinguishable in the tree of Figure 3, because they form two
distinct clades (highlighted in red and blue, respectively).
Three major patterns are evident from this tree. First, roo
elements from distantly related genomes are separated in
different clades, as one might expect if the mode of transmission is predominantly vertical. Second, elements
within one species are usually more closely related to each
other than to elements in other species. The only exception are roo and rooA elements in species of the melanogaster subgroup. In these species, the elements are so
closely related that the divergence of the genomes that
harbor them is not reflected in the elements' divergence.
Third, elements within a genome vary greatly in their

Figure 3
Phylogenetic tree of the 230 identified roo and rooA elements
Phylogenetic tree of the 230 identified roo and rooA elements. The tree is based on the protein coding sequence of
roo and rooA. It was constructed using PhyML with an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the statistical support of
the tree topology [27], as shown by the numbers at the branches. All branches have a very high support. There is a clear division between roo (red background) and rooA (blue background) elements on the tree. Specifically, all roo elements from one
species form a clade and the same holds for rooA. The black triangles at some leaves indicate the divergence of the elements
associated with this leaf, with long triangles indicating great divergence. The number in brackets behind each species name indicates how many elements are present in the respective species.
divergence. For example, the roo elements in D. mojavensis
and D. ananassae, show a low divergence (small triangle),
the roo elements in D. willistoni show the highest divergence (large triangle). Roo elements in the melanogaster
subgroup also seem to be quite diverged. This divergence
can be traced back to only 7 (out of the 132) elements. All
other elements are very similar, as can be seen in Additional file 3. High divergence of elements can point to different subclasses of elements, such as functional and nonfunctional elements.

sophila melanogaster lineage around 40 myr ago, but the
element tree shows that the roo elements in D. mojavensis
are more closely related to D. melanogaster than the elements in D. willistoni. An error in tree estimation is made
unlikely by the high statistical support of both the D.
mojavensis and D. willistoni branches in the roo element
tree (Figure 3). The observation raises the possibility of a
horizontal transfer of the roo element into D. mojavensis
from a Drosophila species after the split from D. willistoni,
but before the split from D. persimilis.

Despite these general patterns, there is one major incongruency between the species tree (Figure 1b) and the element tree (Figure 3). It regards the roo elements. This
incongruency occurs in the D. mojavensis genome. This
species is one of the species most distantly related to D.
melanogaster. Its common ancestor split from the Dro-

Additional fragments validate our earlier findings
The number of roo and rooA copies we identified is probably an underestimate of the real copy number in these
genomes caused by our high stringency search. We, therefore, performed two additional searches to get a better
copy number estimate.

While the coverage and assembly quality of the D. melanogaster genome is very good, the quality of most of the
other genomes is much lower. Even though the sequence
coverage is high, the sequence is divided into many small
stretches of contiguous sequence (contigs). The length of
many contigs is smaller than 10 kb and therefore smaller
than the roo/rooA element. Identification of complete elements in these genomic regions is, therefore, not possible.
Furthermore, the assembly of repeated regions is challenging. To overcome this limitation, we identified the reverse
transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR)
domains in the pol gene of our high stringency sequences
using Pfam domains [29]. The amino acid sequences of
these domains, which vary in length from 153 to 210
amino acid, were then taken as queries for a tblastn[21]
search. The numbers of identified domains, that do not
belong to previously identified roo or rooA elements, are
shown in Table 4.
This search identified roo domains in all genomes with
previously identified roo elements, and additional
domains in D. pseudoobscura, but still did not identify any
elements in D. virilis and D. grimshawi. This leads to the
conclusion that the roo element is not present in these two
genomes, or that it was deleted a long time ago.
The same search identified rooA domains only in genomes
belonging to the melanogaster subgroup and in D.
mojavensis (Table 4).
For each of the three domains, our search identified more
than 100 domains that were not part of previously identi-

fied roo or rooA elements. We calculated the amino acid
similarity between domains within and between elements
from different species. The results mainly validate our
whole element comparison (see Additional files 4, 5, and
6 for results from the reverse transcriptase, integrase and
protease domain, respectively). An exception is the roo
integrase domain. The D. pseudoobscura genome, where we
had not identified any element previously, contains a few
(three) integrase domains (Table 4). These domains are
very similar (92.4% identity) to the domains in the sister
species D. persimilis (Additional file 5).
Many transposable elements are found in the heterochromatin part of the genome. These regions are usually
poorly assembled, which means that we possibly missed
some of the roo and rooA elements. We therefore blasted
the amino acid sequence of all roo and rooA elements
against the sequence trace archives of all genomes, with
the exception of D. pseudoobscura, where no trace archive
was available, using a similarity threshold of 70 percent.
Table 4 indicates, whether part of a roo (column 6) or
rooA (column 11) element was found. The results are
largely confirmatory of our previous analysis. No roo or
rooA elements occur in D. virilis or D. grimshawi. Roo elements occur in the remaining nine genomes. RooA elements occur in all genomes of the melanogaster subgroup
and in D. mojavensis.
No likely origin of roo/rooA outside Drosophila
To detect if the roo or rooA element is also present in species outside the Drosophila group, we searched for the protein sequence of the canonical element in all 162

For each genome, the number of identified sequence domains, which have a similarity of at least 90 percent and a length difference of less than 1
percent to a reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) or protease (PR) domain of the identified roo and rooA sequences, is shown, separated for roo
(columns 2â4) and rooA (columns 7â9). All numbers are additional numbers meaning that domains corresponding to domains in the full length
elements were excluded. The number of total elements (column 5 and 10 for roo and rooA, respectively) was calculated by adding the maximal
number of the three domains to the number of elements of the high stringency search. A "+" in column 6 and 11 indicates that a fragment of an roo
and rooA element, respectively, was found in the trace archive for that genome. Note: No trace archive was available for D. pseudoobscura

available, fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes using
genomic blast [30]. We found no complete roo/rooA elements, and only short fragments covering less than 65
percent of the coding sequence length of roo. Specifically,
we found similar sequences of length between 1000 and
1540 amino acids that overlapped the complete pol region
and part of the gag regions. The longest of these sequences
occurred in insect genomes from mosquitoes Aedes
aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus, the
silkworm Bombyx mori, the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Sequences of
around the same length were also found in the teleost
fishes Danio rerio, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Oryzias latipes,
the sea squirt Ciona savignyi, the lizard Anolis carolinensis,
and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Shorter
sequences that still covered the whole pol region were
found in nematode genomes. No similar sequences were
identified in mammals. We next asked whether these
sequences correspond to roo elements outside the Drosophila clade, or if they derive from other retrotransposons
which also share pol and gag regions. To this end, we used
our relaxed search procedure (see Methods) on all roo/
rooA elements from Drosophila. This relaxed search did not
identify any roo or rooA elements in any of the genomes
from the previous paragraph, which suggests that the
sequences found by blast stem from other retrotransposon families.

Discussion
Element distribution
We identified 164 copies of the roo element in nine out of
the 12 sequenced Drosophila genomes, and 66 copies of
rooA in four of the genomes. An additional search for roo
and rooA fragments using sequence domains (see Methods), and a search against the trace archives of the
genomes found additional elements. These additional
searches identified roo elements or remnants of roo elements in the genome of D. pseudoobscura, where the high
stringency search had not found any elements. This observation, together with our observation of solo-LTRs in this
species, suggests that D. pseudoobscura contains remnants
of these elements. In sum, ten of the 12 Drosophila species
contain roo elements. The additional searches also
revealed new rooA elements or fragments in the two
genomes of D. sechellia and D. melanogaster that did not
contain high stringency elements. RooA elements are thus
present in six out of the 12 genomes, i.e., in the five
genomes belonging to the melanogaster subgroup, and in
the genome of D. mojavensis. Overall, the number of identified elements is probably still an underestimate because
not all parts of every genome are sequenced. Especially the
high number of genomes which contain only non-functional elements (see Table 1 and Figure 4) is surprising, as
it is not likely that these elements were still active recently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

(as indicated by LTR similarity), and then were lost simultaneously in many genomes. Active elements might still
be present in non-sequenced parts of some genomes.
The single rooA element in D. mojavensis remains a mystery. The solo-LTRs and additional integrase domains we
find in this species, were all identified by the sequence of
the complete element in this species, and not by any of the
element sequences in D. yakuba or D. erecta. We did not
find any traces of rooA elements in any other genome outside the melanogaster subgroup. It is possible that this single element belongs to a different LTR element family.
Below we will discuss the implications of this element on
the evolutionary dynamics of the roo and rooA families.
Comparison to previous work
Our analysis can best be assessed by comparison to previous work focusing only on the D. melanogaster genome,
and to the annotation of the D. melanogaster genome. Previously, SÃ¡nchez-Gracia et al. (2005) reported 54 roo copies based on PCR amplification [17]. This study, however,
used only a 1.5 kb fragment of coding DNA to identify a
roo element. This is much shorter than our thresholds for
the high and low stringency search. Vieira et al. (1999)
used in situ hybridization to identify roo insertion sites in
D. melanogaster and D. simulans [31]. Here again, the
probe DNA had to be short (less then 300 bp), which
means that no study to date identified complete and
active roo elements in D. simulans. This shortcoming was
also pointed out by a recent study by BartolomÃ© et al.
(2009) [32]. Lerat et al. (2003) [20] report 103 roo elements, including 30 complete elements. These numbers
are similar to the 107 elements we found in Drosophila
melanogaster. In contrast, Kaminker et al. (2002) [11]
report 146 roo elements. However, the latter authors identified a sequence as a roo element if it was only 50 bp long,
a low stringency that is not appropriate for our analysis. At
higher stringency, our analysis may be more comprehensive. We note that both previous searches were based on
release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome, whereas our analysis uses release 4. In release 4, additional gaps in the
sequence were closed, adding an additional 1.4 Mb to the
genome sequence [33]. The flybase annotation of release
4.1 of the D. melanogaster genome still contains 146 roo
elements. Thirty-six of them were not identified with our
search strategy. All but four are truncated elements, i.e.,
they are solo-LTRs or fragments with a length shorter than
our search threshold. Two of the remaining four long elements are not flanked by recognizable LTR sequences; one
element has very short LTR sequences; the last element
has no identifiable ORF. This comparison shows that our
search strategy, together with a search for solo-LTRs and
domains, can identify the vast majority of previously
known elements. Only short and/or highly diverged ele-

Figure 4
Three hypotheses for the evolutionary dynamics of the roo and rooA element in the 12 Drosophila genomes
Three hypotheses for the evolutionary dynamics of the roo and rooA element in the 12 Drosophila genomes.
Red and blue branches indicate species harboring roo and rooA, respectively. Black branches indicate the loss of both elements.
a) Roo/rooA may have originated in the common ancestor of all 12 Drosophila genomes with the split between the two elements
shortly thereafter. Both elements were then vertically transmitted, as shown by the red and blue branches. Roo was lost in 3
species and rooA in six or seven (depending on the correctness of the rooA element in D. mojavensis (see text for details)). b)
Roo/rooA may have arisen in the common ancestor of the Sophophora group and split shortly thereafter into separate lineages.
Both elements were vertically transmitted to all descendant genomes, with a loss of roo in one genome and of rooA in four
genomes. In this scenario, a horizontal transfer of roo to the genome of D. mojavensis took place after the split from D. willistoni
(red arrow), but the exact time point of transmission cannot be determined. c) Roo/rooA might have originated in the common
ancestor of all 12 genomes. With the split of the Sophophora group the element evolved into the roo element in the Sophophora group, and into the rooA element in the other three genomes. While roo was vertically transferred to all genomes, rooA
is today only present in the D. mojavensis member of this clade. A horizontal transfer of roo to the genome of D. mojavensis took
place after the split from D. willistoni. Later, another horizontal transfer, this time of rooA, took place from D. mojavensis to the
common ancestor of the melanogaster subgroup where it then spread in all five genomes.
ment fragments are not identifiable by our search strategy
as seen, for example, for the previously identified rooA
fragments in D. melanogaster.
Roo and rooA are in various states of activity
LTR elements in eukaryotic genomes undergo different
waves of activation and inactivation [34,35]. The roo and
rooA elements we observed are in various states of activity.

In some species, such as D. persimilis, roo may be on its
way to extinction, as indicated by the sole element in this
species, its truncation, its multiple stop codons, its
frameshift mutation, and its high divergence. In other species, roo elements are numerous and active. Species with
abundant roo or rooA elements have experienced recent
transpositional activity. They include Drosophila melanogaster for the roo element and D. erecta for the rooA ele-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:205

ment. In these species, the LTR sequences of any one
element are generally very similar to one another, indicating recent insertion. Within-genome amino acid similarity is generally high, also indicating recent transposition.
For D. melanogaster, these observations are consistent with
evidence suggesting that LTR elements have recently
become activated [10,36].
The typically young age of most roo LTR elements within
a genome suggests three possible scenarios for roo's evolutionary dynamics. First, roo may have entered any one
genome only recently. This possibility apparently contradicts the observation that roo elements are moderately
diverged within the Drosophila clade as a whole, suggesting that they have segregated in the clade for some time.
This contradiction could be resolved if roo elements that
enter a genome cause the host's extinction on short evolutionary time scales, but before they do so, become horizontally transferred to another host. In this case, roo
elements would persist in a clade largely through horizontal transfer. However, although horizontal transfer has
been suggested by SÃ¡nchez-Gracia et al. (2005) between
roo elements from D. simulans and D. melanogaster [17],
and although our data is suggestive of another horizontal
transfer event, it contains no indication that such transfer
is rampant. For example, the roo element tree is largely
congruent with the species tree.
The second scenario is that roo and rooA elements simply
show high turnover within a genome, with elements continually becoming deleted (leaving solo-LTRs behind)
and transposing into new locations. D. melanogaster has
indeed a high rate of DNA loss [37]. Compared to other
invertebrate genomes, the D. melanogaster genome is
much smaller and contains less non-coding DNA. A high
rate of transposable element deletion may be part of the
process maintaining genome compactness. Although
most other Drosophila genomes are larger than that of D.
melanogaster, they also have a small genome compared to
other invertebrates. The many solo-LTRs we find confirm
that the Drosophila genomes we study may have a high rate
of mobile DNA loss.
A third scenario is that non-autonomous elements are
under strong selection to maintain their LTR sequences,
because LTR sequences are important for transposition
and DNA interaction. Having identical or highly similar
LTRs might enable non-autonomous elements to use the
transcription mechanism of autonomous copies. This
may explain the high coding sequence diversity despite
very similar LTR sequences observed for some elements.
Examples include the five elements in D. ananassae. If this
possibility is correct, than many seemingly young elements might not be that young in reality.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

In balance, the lack of rampant horizontal transfer, and
the frequency with which roo elements become excised,
support the second and third scenario, which are not
mutually exclusive.
Roo and rooA split a long time ago
We next discuss the relationship of roo and rooA, whose
element trees are clearly separable (Figure 3). The split
between roo and rooA probably took place before the
branch leading to D. willistoni or even before the branch
leading to D. mojavensis originated, because otherwise the
elements in these genomes would belong to the ancestral
roo/rooA family and they would be joined to the outgroup
in the element tree. The rooA family probably consisted of
only one or very few copies before the melanogaster subgroup arose, because we did only find one putative occurrence outside this subgroup. The rooA copies were
probably activated and experienced a transposition activity after the split from D. ananassae and then spread
through all species, as indicated by the blue lines in Figure
4. One putative rooA element, however, occurs in the
genome of D. mojavensis. This suggests that the split
between roo and rooA indeed occurred in the common
ancestor of all 12 species.
Incongruency between species and roo element tree
We now turn to an incongruency in the subtree for the roo
elements (Figure 3, red part) that involves the D. mojavensis genome. D. mojavensis is one of the most distantly
related species to D. melanogaster, but the roo elements in
D. mojavensis are more closely related to D. melanogaster
than the elements in D. melanogaster's closer relative D.
willistoni. The element tree topology (including the branch
in question) is well supported, making a tree estimation
error unlikely. Incongruencies like these raise the possibility of horizontal gene transfer events, but before one can
conclude that such an event took place, a number of
potentially confounding factors need to be considered.
First, the genomes of D. willistoni and D. saltans, a sister
group of D. willistoni with no sequenced genome, are
evolving faster than the other genomes of the Drosophila
genus [38]. This could have influenced the evolution of
the roo element and explain the position of the D. willistoni elements in the element tree. Second, an error in the
multiple alignment could lead to this incongruency. Multiple alignments based on many, very long sequences are
error prone, especially if the sequences differ in their
length and are not all closely related. To exclude this possibility, we examined the average amino acid similarity
between elements based on pairwise alignments. This
measure of divergence indicates a higher similarity
between roo elements from D. mojavensis and Drosophila
melanogaster than between elements from D. willistoni and
Drosophila melanogaster. While the difference in similarity

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:205

is small (61.3 percent versus 59 percent) the result still
supports the element tree's structure. A third confounding
factor is the species tree itself. The current placement of D.
willistoni is close to the split of all 12 Drosophila genomes;
this placement, however, is ambiguous. Many gene trees
do not match the current phylogeny [9] and place D.
willistoni as an outgroup to the other genomes. If so, the
species tree would be congruent with the roo element tree.
In sum, a horizontal gene transfer event involving D.
mojavensis is possible but does have mixed support in the
data.
High similarity between roo/rooA elements in
melanogaster subgroup
SÃ¡nchez-Gracia et al. (2005) suggested a horizontal transfer event of roo between D. melanogaster and D. simulans
based on synonymous and non-synonymous divergence
data. We also find a high similarity in roo between these
two species. However, we can not unambiguously explain
this low divergence by a horizontal transfer event, because
the similarity for elements within one genome is higher
than the similarity between elements from different
genomes. Also, we find high similarity not only between
elements in these two genomes but also between all roo
and rooA elements in species of the melanogaster subgroup. This observation might lead to the speculation that
the roo and the rooA element were repeatedly "jumping"
from one species to another. However, SÃ¡nchez-Gracia et
al. showed that other LTR, non-LTR and DNA transposons
also show low divergence, raising the possibility that these
patterns are consistent with vertical transfer.
Three possibilities for the evolutionary dynamics of roo
and rooA
Taken together, all our observations suggest three alternative hypotheses for the evolutionary dynamics of the roo
and rooA elements among the 12 Drosophila genomes.
These hypotheses are based on the assumption that the roo
and rooA subfamilies diverged shortly after their common
ancestor originated, because they are highly diverged. The
first two hypotheses differ in assigning a time for the first
occurrence of a roo/rooA element in the Drosophila species.
The first hypothesis (Figure 4a) assumes that the roo/rooA
element was already present in the common ancestor of
all 12 species, and that both the roo and the rooA element
were vertically transferred to all species. This would
explain the absence of roo elements in some species by stochastic loss (black branches in Figure 4). Wherever element numbers are low in a genome, such stochastic loss is
likely. The closest relatives of genomes with no roo elements have small to modest element numbers, which supports the loss hypothesis. For example, the closest relative
of D. pseudoobscura, which has no roo elements, is D. persimilis, which has only one roo element. According to this
hypothesis roo was lost from the genomes of D. virilis and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

D. grimshawi, but is still present in D. mojavensis. The split
between roo and rooA also took place in the common
ancestor of all 12 genomes, and rooA was transmitted vertically to all genomes. It might have been lost from the
common ancestor of the three species outside the Sophophora group soon thereafter. Alternatively, if the single
putative rooA element in D. mojavensis is a true rooA element, it might have been lost in each non-Sophophora
genome separately (as indicated by the dashed blue lines
in Figure 4a).
The second hypothesis addresses the key shortcoming of
the first hypothesis, which cannot explain the incongruence between the species (Figure 1b) and the element tree
(Figure 3). This second hypothesis places the first occurrence of the roo/rooA element in the ancestor of the Sophophora group and the split between the two elements
shortly thereafter, as shown in Figure 4b by the red and
blue branches. The elements were then vertically transmitted to all descendant species. While roo elements are still
present in all of the nine genomes, rooA elements are only
found in species belonging to the melanogaster subgroup
and were lost from the other genomes. This hypothesis
also assumes that the single rooA element in D. mojavensis
belongs to a different LTR family and was wrongly identified. The roo element in this genome, however, is
explained by a horizontal transfer of a roo element after
the split of D. willistoni to the genome of D. mojavensis.
This hypothesis can also explain the element tree in Figure
3 (if we assume that the species tree in Figure 1 is correct),
the lack of solo LTRs and domains in D. virilis and D. grimshawi, and the amino acid similarity between the coding
regions of the elements. This transfer would have been an
ancient transfer, because the elements from D. mojavensis
share little similarity with elements from other species. An
origin of roo within the Drosophila clade is further supported by the fact that no roo elements can be found outside Drosophila. Some of the RETRO elements in A.
gambiae show a similarity to the roo element [39] but they
may not belong to the same family. Furthermore, only
LTR sequences of RETRO elements have been identified so
far, which makes a comparison to the roo/rooA elements
difficult. Previous phylogenetic studies identified the
Tinker and BEL elements in D. melanogaster as closest relative of the roo element [12,40], but when the split between
these elements may have occurred is unclear.
This second hypothesis however, does not explain the single rooA element in D. mojavensis, if we assume it was not
falsely identified. Our third hypothesis (Figure 4c)
addresses this shortcoming. As in the first hypothesis, we
assume that the roo/rooA element arose in the common
ancestor of all 12 genomes. In contrast to the first hypothesis, the third hypothesis posits that the split between roo
and rooA corresponds to the split between the genomes of

Page 13 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:205

the Sophophora group and the other three genomes. In
the Sophophora group the ancestral roo/rooA element
evolved into today's roo elements, as indicated in Figure 4c
(red lines). In the three genomes of D. mojavensis, D. virilis
and D. grimshawi the ancestral element evolved into the
rooA element. But in contrast to the roo elements in the
Sophophora group, the rooA element did not replicate
often and was lost early from D. virilis and D. grimshawi.
Only in D. mojavensis did the element start to spread. At
one point a roo element was horizontally transferred into
D. mojavensis, and later a second horizontal transfer took
place, this time of rooA from D. mojavensis to the common
ancestor of the genomes of the melanogaster subgroup. In
this group rooA transposed often, especially in the
genomes of D. yakuba and D. erecta. As no functional copy
is left in D. mojavensis, this horizontal transfer prevented
the extinction of the rooA element.
In sum, each of these three hypotheses explains some
aspect of the available data, but this data is currently not
sufficient to decide equivocally for or against one of them.

Conclusion
Within genomes, the evolutionary dynamics of roo and
rooA shows a broad spectrum ranging from recent intense
transpositional activity to slow decay and extinction.
Among genomes, the balance of evidence suggests an origin of roo/rooA in the common ancestor of all 12 genomes
or within the Drosophila clade, and the separation between
the two families shortly afterwards. Furthermore, one horizontal transfer of roo and one of rooA may have occurred,
but the evidence for such transfers is equivocal. Our analysis is based on a limited number of genomes, and conclusive proof of the evolutionary dynamics of roo and rooA, as
well as dating of their origin would need sequence information from additional species. For example, horizontal
transfer of roo and rooA could be confirmed if future
genome sequencing showed that all roo elements occur in
species closely related to the Sophophora group and to D.
mojavensis, whereas rooA elements were found to occur
only in genomes of the melanogaster subgroup and outside the Sophophora group.

Methods
Element Identification
To identify roo elements in the 12 focal Drosophila
genomes, we carried out a high stringency and a low stringency search. Both of these searches use an iterative procedure that has as its core the tool IScan[41], which was
originally designed to identify insertion sequences, simple
transposable elements in bacteria. To identify a transposable element's coding region, IScan performs a tblastn
search (using WUBLAST[42]) to identify matches of the
amino acid query sequence in a genome sequence of interest. After having identified the coding region, IScan also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

allows the identification of indirect repeat regions characteristic of some transposable elements, and associated
with the coding regions. For our purpose, we modified
IScan to allow us to identify the direct repeats associated
with roo elements.
In our high stringency search, we used the roo canonical
sequence [GenBank:AY180917] and the rooA canonical
sequence [18] as a first query, and searched for matches in
the 12 Drosophila genomes which we obtained from the
Comparative Assembly Freeze 1 (CAF1) [43]. In the high
stringency search, we considered further only hits with an
evalue â¤ 0.0001 and at least 50 percent identical residues
between the hit and query sequence. We only considered
hits with an LTR sequence length between 100 bp and
1000 bp, and allowed no unidentified ('N') nucleotides in
the coding and LTR sequences.
After having identified a series of roo sequences that fulfill
these criteria, we used these sequences as new queries in a
new search round, and reiterated this procedure until no
new roo sequences were found. Between each iteration, we
verified that no previously identified sequence was used
more than once as a query. We then manually inspected
all roo elements for spurious hits.
For the low stringency search, we used those 118 elements
previously identified in the high stringency search where
the predicted protein length was longer than 1180 aa, that
is, at least half of the canonical protein length. For this low
stringency search, we used an evalue â¤ 0.01, required at
least a 40 percent match between the query sequences and
the hit, and permitted sequences with unidentified nucleotides ('N') in their coding and LTR sequences. This search
yielded additional roo and rooA fragments in only one
genome (D. simulans) where the previous search had
failed. However, these elements are of spurious validity, as
they contain many sequence fragments annotated with
unknown nucleotides ('N'). In all other genomes except
D. persimilis where the high stringency search had identified one roo element, the low stringency search yielded
additional roo and rooA copies. Because both canonical
sequences identify roo and rooA elements we calculated
the similarity of each identified element to both canonical
elements and added the element to the family with the
higher similarity.
Identification of complete coding region
Our search strategy described above may identify candidate coding regions only incompletely. Specifically, its
results may not include the upstream-most and downstream-most parts of coding regions, such as start codons
and stop codons. To help us to get complete coding region
information, we applied the getorf tool from the
EMBOSS package [44] to the complete element sequence,

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:205

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/205

from the first nucleotide of the 5' LTR sequence through
the last nucleotide of the 3' LTR.

[27]. As outgroup we used the canonical sequence of the
BEL element in D. melanogaster to root the tree.

Specifically, this processing step used the coding region C
identified in the initial analysis, and used getorf to
identify all open reading frames (ORFs) in the same reading frame as C and overlapping C. For most elements (176
elements), this analysis found only one ORF, which covered C completely, which we then used as the final coding
sequence. However, in 54 roo and rooA elements we found
two (or more) ORFs overlapping C, which may be caused
by nonsense mutations that insert stop codons into a
gene. For these elements, we designated the final coding
sequence as extending from the first (upstream-most) to
the last (downstream-most) ORF overlapping C. The
potential non-coding region between the ORFs, if any,
were also included into this final region. With their
median length of 270 bp they comprise a small average
fraction of 5.6 percent of the coding region, and are thus
not likely to significantly alter our results. In fewer than 5
cases additional ORFs in the reading frame but not overlapping C showed a high similarity to the canonical roo
sequence, in which case we included these ORFs into the
coding region as well.

Age calculation
We estimate the intra-element pairwise nucleotide identity between LTR sequences using the dnadist program
from the PHYLIP package [51] with the Felsenstein F84
parameter method. We used the formula T = K/2r where T
= time to most recent common ancestry, K = sequence
divergence, and r = substitution rate [23] to calculate the
age of an element, as described by Bowen and McDonald
(2001) [10]. As a substitution rate we used 0.016 substitutions per site per million years, as estimated for Drosophila
[23].

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The alignments we used are based on the protein coding
sequences of all roo and rooA elements. Our dataset contained 230 roo and rooA elements with coding sequences
as long as 2615 amino acids, which renders accurate multiple alignment identification challenging. We compared
different
alignment
algorithms
(ClustalW[45],
Mafft[46], Muscle[47], Prank[48] and Prob
Cons[49], T-Coffee[50]) to find the best algorithm for
our dataset. Because of its high speed and low number of
artefacts evident upon visual inspection, we chose Mafft
version 5, which refines alignments iteratively using pairwise alignment information.

Based on the multiple alignment, we computed phylogenetic trees of elements using PhyML_aLRT[27] a version
of PhyML[28] which incorporates an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the statistical support of the
tree topology. This approach is superior to a bootstrap calculation with respect to accuracy and power, and it is computationally much more efficient [27]. The method
assigns to each branch a statistical significance ranging
from 0 (least significant) to 1 (highly significant). We
used the default options of PhyML_aLRT with the JTT
matrix for amino acid substitutions, the proportion of
invariable sites set to zero, and with only one category of
substitution rate [28]. We chose the Ï2-based parametric
branch support for approximate likelihood ratio tests

Calculation of amino acid similarity
The calculation is based on the coding region of the element. To avoid biases associated with truncated copies,
which are usually also highly diverged, we used only the
134 roo and rooA elements with an encoded protein
sequence length longer than 1180 amino acids, which is
half the length of the canonical element's coding region.
Using the protdist program from the PHYLIP package
[51] we calculated the percent similarity between pairwise
Mafft alignments of element pairs.
Domain identification
The pol gene of all autonomous LTR retrotransposons contains a reverse transcriptase (RT), an integrase (IN), and a
protease (PR) domain. We obtained the following hidden
markov models [52] from Pfam [53]: "RVT_1" for reverse
transcriptase, "rve" for integrase, and "Peptidase_A17" for
the protease domain. Using Hmmer [54] to search for
these domains in our high stringency hits, we then used
the identified domains in a tblastn search against all
twelve Drosophila genomes. Only hits which share at least
99 percent of the length to their query sequence and a
sequence identity of 90 percent were considered for further analysis. The amino acid similarity between domains
was estimated as described above.
Search in trace archives
We used the protein sequences of all roo and rooA elements in a tblastn search against the traces archives of
all genomes, except that of D. pseudoobscura, where no
trace archive was available. A hit required at least 70 percent similarity to a roo or rooA sequence, and it had to
overlap at least half of the trace archive sequence.
