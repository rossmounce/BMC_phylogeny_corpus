Untangling spider silk evolution with spidroin
terminal domains
Jessica E Garb1,2*, Nadia A Ayoub1,3, Cheryl Y Hayashi1

Abstract
Background: Spidroins are a unique family of large, structural proteins that make up the bulk of spider silk fibers.
Due to the highly variable nature of their repetitive sequences, spidroin evolutionary relationships have principally
been determined from their non-repetitive carboxy (C)-terminal domains, though they offer limited character data.
The few known spidroin amino (N)-terminal domains have been difficult to obtain, but potentially contain critical
phylogenetic information for reconstructing the diversification of spider silks. Here we used silk gland expression
data (ESTs) from highly divergent species to evaluate the functional significance and phylogenetic utility of spidroin
N-terminal domains.
Results: We report 11 additional spidroin N-termini found by sequencing ~1,900 silk gland cDNAs from nine spider
species that shared a common ancestor > 240 million years ago. In contrast to their hyper-variable repetitive
regions, spidroin N-terminal domains have retained striking similarities in sequence identity, predicted secondary
structure, and hydrophobicity. Through separate and combined phylogenetic analyses of N-terminal domains and
their corresponding C-termini, we find that combined analysis produces the most resolved trees and that N-termini
contribute more support and less conflict than the C-termini. These analyses show that paralogs largely group by
silk gland type, except for the major ampullate spidroins. Moreover, spidroin structural motifs associated with
superior tensile strength arose early in the history of this gene family, whereas a motif conferring greater
extensibility convergently evolved in two distantly related paralogs.
Conclusions: A non-repetitive N-terminal domain appears to be a universal attribute of spidroin proteins, likely
retained from the origin of spider silk production. Since this time, spidroin N-termini have maintained several
features, consistent with this domain playing a key role in silk assembly. Phylogenetic analyses of the conserved Nand C-terminal domains illustrate dramatic radiation of the spidroin gene family, involving extensive duplications,
shifts in expression patterns and extreme diversification of repetitive structural sequences that endow spider silks
with an unparalleled range of mechanical properties.

Background
There are numerous types of spider silks and each has
its own suite of mechanical properties, including exceptional tensile strengths, extensibilities, and toughness
[1,2]. This mechanical diversity is associated with the
distinct functional demands of the different silk types
and largely stems from variation in the molecular composition of the silk proteins [3,4]. An individual spider
spins a multitude of silk types, with each type emerging
from its own distinctive set of abdominal silk glands.
This complex silk machinery enables spiders to utilize

task-specific silks (e.g., for web assembly, egg-case construction, prey wrapping, etc.). Every fiber type is composed of one or more spidroin proteins (spidroin =
spider fibroin; [5]). Spidroins synthesized by an individual spider are encoded by multiple gene paralogs, the
result of gene duplication and divergence events [6-8].
The complement of spidroin paralogs found within a
spider genome varies substantially across species from
different families [6,7]. Determining the evolutionary
relationships of spidroins is therefore an essential step
to understanding spider silk diversification.
Spidroins are typically very large proteins (e.g., > 3000
amino acids, > 200 kDa) and exhibit a polymeric organization, where > 90% of the sequence is composed of

highly homogenized tandem repeats [9-12]. Depending
on the type of spidroin, these tandem repeats may contain combinations of amino acid sequence motifs that
form structural modules such as crystalline beta-sheets,
beta turns, or helices, that underlie the mechanical attributes of spider silks [4,13-15]. Flanking a spidroin’s long
core region of iterated repeats are short, non-repetitive
amino (N) and carboxy (C) terminal domains (Figure 1).
Sequence conservation of these terminal domains across
spidroins, and their presence in silk fibers [16-18], imply
they serve some critical role. For example, predicted signal peptides in the N-terminal domain are thought to
regulate spidroin secretion from silk gland cells [19-21];

whereas experimental data suggest the N- and Cterminal domains contribute to fiber assembly [22-28].
Reconstructing relationships among spidroins based
on their repetitive regions is problematic because their
extreme variability in length and sequence identity make
them difficult to align [6,7,12]. The high variability
observed between spidroin repetitive sequences results
from mutations being spread across a gene by concerted
evolution involving non-reciprocal recombination
among intragenic repeats [10,29]. This scrambling and
overwriting of repeated sequences violates assumptions
of positional homology implied when they are aligned
for phylogenetic construction [30,31]. Thus, despite the

repetitive region composing the majority of a spidroin
sequence, phylogenetic analyses of the spidroin gene
family have relied mostly on the much shorter, more
conserved C-terminal domain [6,8,21,32].
Spidroin C-terminal sequences are relatively straightforward to deduce via cDNA cloning and represent the
overwhelming majority of existing sequence data available for gene family reconstruction. However, the short
C-termini (encoded by ~300 bp) provide limited characters from which to infer evolutionary relationships
among paralog lineages that could have arisen 300-400
million years ago [33]. Far fewer spidroin N-terminal
sequences are known, due to the difficulties associated
with direct N-terminal sequencing of silk proteins and
cloning full-length spidroin cDNAs or genomic
sequences that can be ~10-15 kb or longer [11,12,20].
The few published N-termini suggest promise as an
additional source of phylogenetic characters, because
they are approximately 50% longer than C-termini and
appear to be more conserved [8,12,20,21,34].
The increasing efficiency of DNA sequencing has
enabled us to assemble large-scale collections of
expressed sequences (ESTs: Expressed Sequence Tags)
from spider silk gland cDNA libraries. Through bioinformatic surveys of these data, we identified 11 more
N-terminal spidroin sequences from nine species, nearly
doubling the set available for phylogenetic inference.
Notably, we report N-terminal spidroin sequences from
a broad sampling of spider lineages, spanning > 240
million years of divergence, as well as from a greater
diversity of functionally distinct silk proteins. We investigate the utility of these expanded N-terminal data,
both separately and in combination with corresponding
C-termini for resolving spidroin phylogeny and to trace
the evolution of structural motifs that contribute to the
extraordinary mechanical performance of spider silks.
We also identify conserved sequence features of spidroin
N-termini that are likely to be important for the production of native spider silk and the assembly of recombinant silk in vitro for biomimetic applications.

Methods
cDNA library construction and screening

Silk gland cDNA libraries were constructed from nine
spider species representing eight families. Live spiders
were anesthetized with CO 2 and the following silk
glands were dissected and then flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen: (1) tubuliform glands from Argiope argentata
(Araneidae); (2) minor ampullate glands from Latrodectus hesperus (Theridiidae); (3) flagelliform glands from
Metepeira grandiosa (Araneidae); (4) large, ampullate
shaped glands from Diguetia canities (Diguetidae); and
combined silk gland tissue from (5) Agelenopsis aperta
(Agelenidae), (6) Deinopis spinosa (Deinopidae),

(7) Uloborus diversus (Uloboridae), (8) Kukulkania
hibernalis (Filistatidae), and (9) Bothriocyrtum californicum (Ctenizidae). Total RNA was extracted from each
tissue type by homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and further purified using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). mRNA was isolated
with oligo-(dT)-tagged magnetic beads (Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen’s SuperScript
Choice protocol, starting with the anchored oligonucleotide (dT) 18 V. cDNAs were fractionated by size using
ChromaSpin 1000 columns (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA), blunt-end ligated into pZErO-2 vector (Invitrogen),
and electroporated into TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). For each species, ~1800 colonies were arrayed and
replicated onto nylon filters. Between 400-600 recombinant clones from each library were screened for size by
visualization of plasmid DNA with gel electrophoresis
using the method of Beuken et al. [35] and inserts ≥ 500
bp were sequenced using T7 or Sp6 primers.
The nylon filters of every cDNA library were screened
with g32P labeled oligonucleotide probes encoding polyalanine (GCDGCDGCDGCDGCDGC) and alternating alanine and glycine (CCWGCWCCWGCWCCWGCWCC),
motifs common to many spider silks [6]. We also used the
following probes to screen specific libraries: (1)
GMWGAWGCRAAWGCCATRTT, (2) CRAYMGMAGATGCRAATGCCAT (1-2 for Kukulkania hibernalis
and Diguetia canities); (3) CGATGCGGCTGCTGCAGA,

Diguetia canities); (10) CCWCCWGGWC CNNNWCCW
CCWGGWCC, (11) CCWGGWCC TTGTTGWCCW

GGCACT, (14) GGCACTGGAGAAAGCGCT, (15)
ACTDGCTCCBACRCCRAC, (16) GAYTGGCTTGC
GGCTTGRCT (12-16 for Agelenopsis aperta). Additional
probes used in screening libraries from Argiope argentata
were reported in Garb and Hayashi [29], from Uloborus
diversus and Deinopis spinosa in Garb et al. [32],
and Bothriocyrtum californicum in Garb et al. [7]. Probepositive recombinant clones were sequenced with T7 and/
or Sp6.
Characterization of spidroin N- and C-terminal domains

To identify putative spidroin N-terminal domain
sequences, silk gland EST sequences were subjected to
translated-Blast queries (BlastX; [36]) against the NCBI
nr protein database. Collected sequences were also compiled in a private database against which we blasted
published spidroin N-terminal sequences. Plasmids containing N-terminal coding regions were digested with

Garb et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/243

restriction enzymes to estimate insert size. The longest
clone of each N-terminal type, containing the maximal
amount of upstream sequence, was selected for further
characterization. These cDNAs were independently
sequenced two times in their forward and reverse directions using T7 and Sp6. We also surveyed the literature
and searched GenBank databases for published N-terminal sequences.
N-terminal sequences were identified as belonging to
established spidroin classes by: 1) the presence of recurring amino acid motifs in adjacent repetitive sequence,
diagnostic for particular spidroins (see Gatesy et al. [6]);
2) the silk gland from which they were isolated; and 3)
their relationship to published N-termini based on preliminary phylogenetic analyses. Spidroin sequence
nomenclature indicates the silk gland type from which it
was initially isolated (Ma = major ampullate, Mi =
minor ampullate, Tu = tubuliform, Ac = aciniform, or
Flag = flagelliform), usually followed by “Sp” for spidroin, and often a number for distinct paralogs (e.g.,
MaSp1 and MaSp2 were the first two spidroins characterized from major ampullate silk glands). Sequences
not readily assigned to these groups were designated by
species name followed by “fibroin x”, where x is a number identifying a distinct paralog (e.g., Bothriocyrtum
californicum fibroin 1). However, it should be noted
that various authors have occasionally assigned the same
protein name to paralogous spidroins (e.g., paralogs
from different species have been named “MaSp1”).
For new and published spidroin N-terminal sequences,
we associated each with its corresponding downstream
C-terminal sequence. This is trivial in the four cases
where full-length cDNA or genomic sequences have
been reported [11,12]. However, the great majority of
spidroin sequences represent partial transcripts that
span either the N-terminal or C-terminal coding region
adjacent to downstream or upstream repetitive
sequence, respectively. Because spidroin repetitive
sequence is extremely similar across its entire length
(e.g., see Figure 1), previous work reporting N-termini
have identified their probable downstream C-terminal
sequence based on near identity of the adjacent repetitive regions in each [20,21,34]. In this paper, we similarly assigned a corresponding C-terminal sequence to
an N-terminal sequence (from the same species) if their
repetitive regions were nearly identical. GenBank accession numbers for newly reported and published
sequences examined in this study are listed in Table 1.
N-terminal spidroin sequences were determined by
conceptual translation using coding frames determined
by BlastX searches. Rising et al. [21] identified the presence of a conserved translation initiation site (Met residue) in N-terminal sequences. Following this finding, we
presumed that N-terminal transcripts lacked complete

Page 4 of 16

upstream coding information if their sequence did not
overlap this region. We subjected the N-termini to SignalP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ analyses,
which predict the location of signal peptide cleavage
sites. Superimposed Kyte-Doolittle [37] hydropathy plots
of the N-termini were made with pepwindowall http://
emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/pepwindowall.html. N-terminal secondary structures were predicted using the Garnier et al. [38] method implemented
in GOR IV http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_gor4.html.
Phylogenetic tree construction

N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences were
separately aligned with ClustalW, using default parameters as implemented in MacVector 7.0 (Oxford Molecular Group, Oxford, UK), then the output was refined
manually. N-terminal sequences of Latrodectus geometricus MaSp1 and Nephila clavipes Flag were edited
according to Rising et al. [21]. Protein sequence alignments were used to guide an alignment of encoding
nucleotides using the program tranalign http://bioweb2.
pasteur.fr/docs/EMBOSS/tranalign.html. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed with N- and C-terminal alignments for protein and nucleotide sequences separately,
and also in a combined analysis, concatenating the Nand C-terminal character matrices. Heuristic parsimony
tree searches were conducted with PAUP* 4.0b [39],
including 10,000 random taxon addition replicates and
tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping, treating
gaps as missing data. Branch support was computed
from 1000 bootstrap (BT) replicates, with three random
taxon addition replicates per bootstrap replicate. Decay
indices of tree nodes were determined using the program TreeRot v3 [40].
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were also conducted
separately for N-termini, C-termini, and the two in
combination. Analyses were performed with MrBayes
3.1.2 [41], using the model recommended by ProtTest
[42] for separate analyses of protein sequences, or by
ModelTest [43] for separate and combined analyses of
nucleotides. Combined nucleotide analyses were partitioned by N- and C-terminal domains, using the recommended model for each partition. Combined amino acid
N- and C-terminal analyses implemented a “mixed”
model, allowing switching between models plus a
gamma distribution. Bayesian runs were executed for
5 × 106 generations, sampling trees every 1000 generations, and continued until split frequencies were below
0.01. Clade posterior probabilities (PP) were computed
from a 50% majority-rule consensus of post burn-in
trees (25% of each run, totaling 125,000 trees).
Root placement in spidroin gene family trees was estimated with reference to a phylogenetic hypothesis for

spider species. This “species tree” included all species
from which the analyzed spidroin genes were sampled
and is a composite tree, summarized from published
phylogenies (Figure 2). Relationships at the family level
and above were determined from Coddington et al. [44],
relationships among Nephila species were from Kuntner
et al. [45], relationships within Araneidae are based on
Scharff and Coddington [46] and relationships among
Argiope species were from Elices et al. [47]. Each gene
tree was reconciled with the fixed species tree in
Notung 2.6 [48], to identify the rooted topology that
minimized inferred gene duplications and losses (D/L).
Default cost parameters in Notung (duplication = 1.5,
loss = 1.0) were used to compute minimal D/L scores
and re-root trees.
Spidroin tree comparisons and character mapping

The resulting N- and C-terminal trees were visually compared to identify any well-supported (BT ≥ 70% or PP ≥
0.95) but conflicting nodes [49]. Potential conflict
between N- and C-termini was also evaluated with the
partition homogeneity test (PHT), implemented in PAUP

and excluding invariant characters. Null distributions
were constructed from 1000 replicate character permutations, with most parsimonious trees for each replicate
estimated from 10 random taxon addition replicates.
Likelihood tree scores for different N- or C-terminal (and
combined) phylogenetic hypotheses were evaluated relative to each dataset. Likelihood values for nucleotide
trees were determined in PAUP*, using the recommended substitution model for the given dataset and
allowing branch lengths to vary. Significant differences
between best and alternative hypotheses were compared
using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [50], with full
optimization and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Likelihood
values of trees derived from amino acid data were determined and compared to alternative trees with the SH test
in TreePuzzle 5.2 [51]. For combined parsimony analyses,
conflict and congruence for different nodes was also evaluated with Partitioned Branch support [52], computed
with TreeRot v3, Hidden Branch Support and Partitioned
Hidden Branch Support [53].
The combined amino acid tree was used to map N- and
C-terminal domain synapomorphies. Unambiguously

optimized apomorphic changes were determined using
the “apolist” option in PAUP*, for both ACCTRAN and
DELTRAN optimizations, and tracing each onto the
combined tree to identify shared derived residues at each
tree node. We scored exemplar repeat sequences from
each sampled spidroin for the presence of amino acid
motifs hypothesized to form specific secondary and tertiary structures [4]. These included poly-alanine, An (four
or more contiguous alanines); two or more consecutive
glycine-alanine couplets, (GA)n; two or more consecutive
glycine-serine couplets, (GS) n ; two or more GPGX n
repeats, where P = proline and X = an amino acid from a
small subset; and two or more tandem arrayed GGX. An,
(GA)n, and (GS)n conform to beta-sheet structures that
impart tensile strength, whereas repeating GPGXn motifs
form beta-turns that confer extensibility, and the (GGX)n
motif forms a 310 helix [4]. Gain or loss of these motifs at
tree nodes was inferred by parsimony ancestral reconstruction using the combined N- and C-terminal domain
trees in MacClade 4.0 [54].

Results
N-terminal sequence discovery

In total, we sequenced 1,921 silk gland cDNAs from
nine spider species. BlastX searches of the resulting EST

data identified 30 cDNA sequences containing putative
spidroin N-termini. Blastclust analyses http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/blastclust#, which cluster highly similar
sequences, grouped the 30 N-termini into 11 distinct
sequence types. Each N-terminal cDNA represented a
partial transcript that included some adjacent repetitive
sequence. Except for the MaSp1 N-terminal sequence
from the nursery web spider, Euprosthenops australis
[21], previous reports of N-terminal spidroins were from
eight species of the spider clade Araneoidea (ecribellate
orbweavers; Figure 2). Our new sequences indicate the
presence of a similar non-repetitive N-terminal domain
in spidroins synthesized by eight additional species, six
of which were non-araneoids from the lineages Deinopoidea (Uloborus and Deinopis), the RTA clade (Agelenopsis), Haplogynae (Kukulkania and Diguetia), and
the suborder Mygalomorphae (Bothriocyrtum). These
included sequences we hypothesize to be upstream of
Agelenopsis aperta MaSp1 (GenBank accession
AAT08436) and Kukulkania hibernalis MaSp1
(AAT08433) reported by Tian et al. [55]. In addition, we
discovered N-terminal sequences from Latrodectus,
Metepeira, and Uloborus for the minor ampullate spidroin MiSp, which constitutes temporary scaffold silk.
Fourteen additional published N-terminal spidroin

sequences, and one unpublished N-terminal sequence
reported in GenBank as a “major ampullate dragline silk
protein” (AY945306) but which we attribute to Flag
because it flanks repetitive sequence characteristic of
Flag spidroins, were included in subsequent analyses
(Table 1). We were able to associate N-termini with
putative downstream C-termini for all new and published sequences except for Kukulkania hibernalis
MaSp1, the C-terminus of which is unknown. It was
also not possible to determine whether the N-terminal
sequence of MaSp2 from Deinopis spinosa was upstream
of MaSp2a (DQ399329) or MaSp2b (DQ399328)
C-terminal sequences, which are very similar to each
other and possibly represent allelic variants [32]. For
this reason, both MaSp2a and MaSp2b from D. spinosa
were included in C-terminal analyses.

shared an average of 35% identity (median pairwise
identity for N-termini = 33%, C-termini = 30%).
N-terminal regions had proportionately less length variation than C-terminal regions (complete N-terminal
sequences ranged from 151-162 amino acids vs. 87-107
amino acids for C-terminal sequences). Superimposed
Kyte-Doolittle plots indicated relative similarity in
hydropathy profiles across N-termini (Additional file 2),
with greatest hydrophobicity occurring in the first 10-20
residues, consistent with predictions that they include
signal peptides, followed by alternating hydrophilic and
hydrophobic regions. Secondary structural predictions
for exemplars of the different N-termini consisted

N-terminal sequence features

Phylogenetic analyses

Alignment of the translated sequences showed that five
of the 11 newly reported N-termini include the conserved methionine residue identified by Rising et al. [21]
as the spidroin translation initiation site (Additional file
1). SignalP 3.0 predicted the presence and location of a
signal peptide in nearly all N-terminal sequences, consistent with the targeting of these proteins for entry
into the secretory pathway. Three sequences (A.a.
TuSp1, A.v. Flag, and U.d. MiSp) were predicted to be
non-secretory proteins, a possible artifact of their lack
of some upstream sequence. The amino acid sequence
motif “TTGXXN” identified by Rising et al. [21] as conserved across spidroin N-termini, does not appear in all
of the new sequences we report here (Additional file 1).
Of the 168 aligned residues in the N-terminal alignment, only three are present universally in all sequences
(Additional file 1). These three residues are the start
codon, an aspartic acid (position 70) and a glycine
(position 140). However, 39% of all sites contained the
same residue in at least half of the sequences. Average
pairwise identity across N-terminal amino acid
sequences was 37%, and corresponding C-termini

At both the nucleotide (nu) and amino acid (aa) level,
N-terminal sequences provided more variable (nu = 455,
aa = 160) and parsimony informative (PI: nu = 415, aa =
144) characters than C-termini (variable: nu = 300, aa =
102; PI: nu = 283, aa = 96; Table 2). The consistency
indices (CI) of most parsimonious trees, were similar for
both N-termini and C-termini (e.g., Nterm aa CI =
0.634 vs. Cterm aa CI = 0.643; Table 2). Parsimony analyses of nucleotide data resulted in a single N-terminal
tree and two C-terminal trees, whereas Bayesian consensus trees were less resolved (Additional file 4). Nearly all
statistically supported nodes in the separate nucleotide
trees were supported in the amino acid trees (Figure 3,
Additional file 4), and the number of supported nodes
did not markedly differ between N- and C-terminal
trees (Table 2). Separate N- and C-terminal amino acid
trees supported a TuSp1 clade (N-terminal: BT = 100,
PP = 1.00; C-terminal: BT = 54, PP = 1.00) and Flag
clade (N-terminal: BT = 97, PP = 1.00; C-terminal: BT =
100, PP = 1.00), but relationships among MaSp and
MiSp sequences varied. Nevertheless, supported groups
of more recently diverged sequences were mirrored in

MaSp2 sequences in the Bayesian consensus. Combined
amino acid trees included a TuSp1 clade (BT = 100,

reconciliation analyses with every spidroin phylogeny
indicated that rooting on the branch leading to Bothriocyrtum californicum fibroin 1 minimized costs associated
with gene duplications and losses.
Evidence for any strongly supported, but conflicting
nodes between N- and C-terminal trees was limited to
the TuSp1 clade, which in the Bayesian C-terminal
nucleotide analyses included all Flag sequences (PP =
0.98; Additional file 4). By contrast, the N-terminal

Bayesian nucleotide tree showed a well-supported
monophyletic TuSp1 (PP = 1.00), which was in agreement with the results of all other analyses. Also, L.h.
TuSp1 grouped with A.ap.TuSp1 in the C-terminal
amino acid Bayesian tree (PP = 0.98), which conflicts
with it being sister to all other TuSp1 sequences in the
N-terminal Bayesian amino acid tree (PP = 1.00; Figure
3). However, partition-homogeneity tests did not indicate significant incongruence between the N- and

Garb et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:243

C-terminal characters (nu: P = 0.788; aa: P = 0.330).
Comparisons of alternative topologies using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test indicated there were significant differences in likelihood between topologies derived
from separate N- or C-terminal data analyses (Table 3).
But parsimony and Bayesian combined (N+C) data
topologies were not significantly different from the best
likelihood N- or C-terminal trees from separate data
analyses. The sum of N- and C-terminal Partitioned
Branch Support (PBS) values for all nodes in the
combined parsimony tree (Figure 4) indicated that Nterminal data (PBS sum = 132.2) contributed much
more support than the C-terminal data (PBS sum =
45.7). Nearly all N-terminal PBS scores were positive,
whereas several C-terminal PBS scores were negative,
the largest negative value being -6 (node 4, Figure 4).
The Hidden Branch Support (HBS) values indicated that
there was hidden support gained by combining the data
(HBS sum = 62) and only 3 of 23 nodes indicated some
hidden conflict (nodes 11, 16, and 17, Figure 4). Much
of the hidden support emerged from the N-terminal
data, while hidden conflict was mainly restricted to the
C-terminal data (see PHBS values, Figure 4).
In the combined analyses, although the N-termini
contributed more phylogenetic support, there were
more synapomorphic residues in the C-terminal data
(43) than in the N-termini (37; Figure 5). Considering
the combined analysis results, ancestral reconstruction
of structural motifs scored from exemplar repeats (Additional files 6 and 7) showed the unambiguous presence
of An motifs at the root of the tree and its loss in three
independent lineages (Figure 5). GPGXn repeats evolved
at least twice to explain their presence in Flag sequences
and in the clade containing MaSp2 sequences. (GS)n
motifs independently arose in the MiSp lineage and in
K.h. MaSp1. Alternative reconstructions were possible
for (GA) n and (GGX) n evolution, as the presence or
absence of these motifs at the root of the tree was equivocal (Figure 5).

Discussion
Conservation and diversity of spidroin N-termini

Despite years of intense research aimed at discovering
the molecular basis for spider silk mechanics, determination of full-length spidroin sequences has rarely been
achieved [11,12]. While many partial spidroin fragments
containing C-termini have been characterized from
divergent spider species, very few N-terminal sequences
of these proteins are known and all but one were from
araneoid species [11,12,18-21,34]. The limited number
of the non-repetitive N-terminal domain sequences has
restricted generalizations regarding its distribution
across spidroins, as well its variability and potential
functional significance. In this study we substantially

Page 11 of 16

expanded the number and diversity of spidroin N-terminal domain sequences by employing an EST approach,
where > 1,900 silk gland cDNAs were sequenced at random. Using this method, we discovered that spidroins
from the divergent spider lineages Mygalomorphae,
Haplogynae, Agelenoidea, and Deinopoidea are also
characterized by the presence of a non-repetitive
N-terminal domain with high sequence similarity to
those reported from distantly related araneoid spiders
[11,12,18-20,34] and the pisaurid Euprosthenops australis [21].
The finding of an N-terminal domain in a mygalomorph spidroin is significant because it indicates that
this molecular feature has been conserved for at least
240 million years of spider silk production, the minimal
age that fossil evidence dates the divergence of mygalomorphs (tarantulas and their kin) and araneomorphs
("true spiders”) from a common ancestor [56]. Molecular dating with multiple fossil calibration points estimates an even older divergence, as early as ~390 million
years ago [33]. The conserved N-terminal domain may
be a universal feature of spidroin protein architecture
that has persisted since the spinning of the first spider
silk, estimated to have occurred in the Devonian.
Our analyses show that spidroin N-termini are relatively conserved at multiple levels of molecular organization. In addition to sequence similarity, the different Ntermini are similar in length (~151-162 amino acids)
and share a common translation initiation site. After the
first methionine, two other residues are identical across
all spidroins (position 70 = D and position 140 = G),
while their corresponding C-terminal domains do not
have a single residue that is 100% conserved. The shared
features of spidroin N-termini also include predicted
signal peptides, hydropathy profiles characterized by
similarly alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic
regions, and secondary structural predictions consisting
of 4-6 alpha-helices. While previous studies noted some
of these characteristics [20,21], our work substantially
broadens their distribution across very distantly related
species and spidroin paralogs that compose mechanically dissimilar silks.
Previous mass spectrometry (MS) work confirmed the
presence of the TuSp1 N-terminal domain in egg-case silk
fibers [18]. The Latrodectus hesperus MiSp N-terminus we
report here contains the sequences (VWDSTATAEAFIGSFNS and MDDISSISDTIISAIER) that exactly match
mass spectrometry peptide sequences collected from
L. hesperus minor ampullate silk by LaMattina et al. [57]
(peptide mass 2081.0 and 2434.1), excepting that all “I”
residues were reported as “L” (I and L are difficult to
distinguish with MS). These data indicate that the MiSp
N-terminal sequence (beyond the signal cleavage site) is
also present in minor ampullate silk fibers and given the

conserved characteristics, further reinforces that this
domain contributes to silk production beyond secretory
signaling.
Though relatively similar at the structural level, the new
N-terminal sequences we report reveal far more sequence
diversity than previously known. Our work confirms that
this domain is the most conserved region across spidroin
paralogs, although it exhibits only slightly greater pairwise
identity than do its corresponding C-termini. This additional N-terminal sequence diversity is intriguing because
it may relate to differential mechanisms of fiber formation
among functionally distinct silks. Fiber assembly processes
are likely to vary across gland types because of the differences in the repetitive structural motifs of their constituent spidroins and the length of time they are stored in
glands (e.g., major ampullate silk is used daily while tubuliform silk is used only a few times in a spider’s lifetime).
Examples of paralog-specific features are the two identically positioned cysteine residues that have evolved in araneoid and non-araneoid TuSp1 N-termini (positions 52
and 134, Additional file 1), suggesting their involvement in
a biochemical mechanism particular to the assembly of
spider egg-case silk fibers. These cysteines may participate
in intra- or inter-molecular disulfide bridges, much like
the conserved cysteines in lepidopteran heavy-chain
fibroin [18,58].
Phylogenetic utility of spidroin N-termini

It is generally not controversial to combine sequence
data from different regions of the same gene or protein
for phylogenetic reconstruction. However, a number of
features specific to spidroin genes suggest that their evolutionary dynamics may create phylogenetic conflict
between the two termini. Recent work has demonstrated
that there are multiple genomic copies of the MaSp1
dragline silk gene [8,21,34]. Detailed evolutionary analyses of Latrodectus MaSp1 and MaSp2 genes showed
their encoded N-and C-termini do not form mutually
exclusive clades, despite having markedly different repetitive region sequences (e.g., GPGXn motifs are abundant in MaSp2 but absent in MaSp1; [8]). Relationships
among the N-termini of these sequences also conflicted
with those from their C-termini, which was attributed to
intergenic recombination between different MaSp1
copies and also between MaSp1 and MaSp2 [8]. Such
recombination would introduce conflict in combined
phylogenetic analyses. Ayoub and Hayashi [8] hypothesized that an alternative explanation for the unexpected
groupings of MaSp1 and MaSp2 termini could be convergent evolution within a genome to facilitate coexpression and/or co-assembly in major ampullate
glands. Convergent evolution of N- and/or C-termini
would obscure their phylogenetic relationships in either
separate or combined analyses.

Page 13 of 16

Regardless of the potential for recombination and convergence, we primarily observe congruence among the
well-supported nodes in trees separately constructed
from N- and C-termini and a partition homogeneity test
did not find strong evidence of character conflict
between the two datasets. While there were significant
differences in the likelihood scores of topologies
produced by the N- and C-termini, neither N- nor Cterminal topologies were significantly different from the
combined topologies. Our analyses did show repeated
grouping of araneoid MaSp1 with MaSp2 sequences,
but these relationships are mirrored in both N- and Cterminal trees where they were strongly supported.
Some disagreement was found between N- and Ctermini within the TuSp1 clade, suggesting the need for
additional sequences to determine if this conflict persists
or is a sampling artifact. Despite our best efforts to link
N- and C-termini from the same protein, there is the
possibility that in some cases the concatenated termini
do not represent two ends of the same molecule, but
instead are from different paralogs, introducing another
potential source of phylogenetic conflict.
The combination of N- and C-termini produced
improved phylogenies over separate analyses, based on
the criteria of containing more strongly supported
branches, increased branch support values, and being
more robust to different methods of phylogenetic inference (i.e., the parsimony tree and Bayesian consensus
were highly congruent). Combination of the data also
revealed a much higher level of hidden branch support
relative to hidden conflict [53], consistent with an overall increase in phylogenetic signal. However, the contribution of the two termini to combined analyses was
imbalanced, as indicated by the partitioned branch support and hidden partitioned branch support values that
showed N-termini provided greater support than C-termini. This result suggests that N-termini are more informative than C-termini for understanding spidroin
relationships, perhaps because of their greater length
and sequence conservation. Future work will focus on
characterizing the presently unknown N-terminal
domains of spidroins composing prey-wrapping silk
(AcSp1; [59]) and cementing silk (PySp1 [60]) to further
clarify spider silk diversification.
Evolution of spider silks

Although all spiders make silk, perhaps the greatest complexity of silk production is displayed by araneoid orbweavers, which possess seven distinct gland types that
manufacture different silks with diverse functional applications. Molecular characterizations of araneoid silks has
established that six of these glands (major ampullate,
minor ampullate, flagelliform, aciniform, tubuliform and
pyriform glands) each express unique combinations of

Garb et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:243
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/243

spidroin paralogs [9,19,29,59-61]. These paralogs encode
proteins with varying proportions of structural motifs that
underlie the signature mechanical properties of each fiber
type. Outside of araneoids, there is tremendous variation
in the number and types of silk glands, as well as the set of
spidroin paralogs found across species. The evolution of
this striking diversity can be investigated by jointly considering: 1) the phylogenetic relationships of spiders; 2) the
distribution of silk glands among these lineages; and 3) the
relationships of spidroins expressed by these glands and
their sequence features.
In contrast to araneoids (part of the suborder Araneomorphae), spiders in the suborder Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their kin) possess many primitive features of
silk production, including homogeneous, acinous-shaped
silk glands and uniform fiber types [62]. Consistent with
their lesser glandular diversification, mygalomorphs also
express fewer spidroin paralogs than araneomorphs and
these paralogs are also relatively similar in sequence [7].
The glandular affiliation hypothesis of Hayashi and
Lewis [19] proposed that spidroins evolved in association with the glands where they are primarily expressed,
predicting a phylogenetic correlation between araneomorph gland type and spidroin paralogs. Our combined
N- and C-terminal spidroin amino acid trees generally
support this expectation: TuSp1, Flag and MiSp,
expressed in tubuliform, flagelliform and minor ampullate silk glands, respectively, each form mutually exclusive clades. However, spidroins characterized from the
major ampullate glands of the haplogyne species
Kukulkania (K.h. MaSp1) and Diguetia (D.c. MaSp and
D.c. MaSp-like) did not group with MaSp sequences
from Entelegynae species. While all araneomorph spiders possess major ampullate glands, tubuliform glands
are restricted to the Entelegynae clade, and flagelliform
(and homologous pseudoflagelliform) glands subsequently evolved in the common ancestor of Araneoidea
and Deinopoidea. Accordingly, tubuliform and flagelliform glands (and their expressed spidroins) may have
originated as duplicates of major ampullate glands.
There has been apparent duplication and loss of major
ampullate glands among araneomorph spider lineages
[63], such that the major ampullate glands of Haplogynae and Entelegynae spiders also may not be strictly
homologous (identity of structures through inheritance
from a common ancestor). Instead, some major ampullate glands may be serially homologous to each other
(similarity of structures due to common developmental
mechanisms). The non-monophyly of MaSp sequences
may also reflect our greater sampling of major ampullate
gland cDNAs from a wider range of species in distantly
related spider families, as compared to our more limited
sampling of other silk gland types in non-orbicularian
species. Thus the grouping of TuSp1, Flag and MiSp

Page 14 of 16

into monophyletic clades could break down with further
taxonomic sampling, suggesting that future work should
substantially increase sampling of silk sequence types
from a more diverse and numerous set of spider taxa.
The disjunct relationships of major ampullate spidroin
termini are not entirely surprising given the diversity of
their repetitive sequences. Major ampullate spidroins
from orbicularian (araneoid + deinopoid) species, are
largely characterized by iterations of An in combination
with either tandem arrayed GGX in MaSp1 or GPGXn
in MaSp2. The repetitive sequence of major ampullate
spidroins from the haplogyne Kukulkania [55] and
Diguetia (this study) are distinct from each other and
from orbicularian MaSps (see Additional file 6). For
instance, D.c. MaSps, characterized from the ampullate
shaped glands of Diguetia contain An, but are unusual
in also containing strings of glutamine (Q n ). K.h.
MaSp1, described from the major ampullate glands of
Kukulkania [53], contains many iterations of (GA)n and
(GS) n , and much less A n than in orbicularian MaSps
and no Qn like the D.c. MaSps. Swanson et al. [2] found
that major ampullate silk fibers from divergent spider
species exhibit substantial variability in their mechanical
properties, which may correlate with the phylogenetic
distribution of structural motifs we observe in MaSp
repetitive sequences (Figure 5). Our results indicate that
the structural module An, primarily associated with the
high tensile strengths of major ampullate silk, was present in ancestral spidroins but was subsequently lost in
some paralogs or expanded in others.
The relatively close relationship between the terminal
domains of the egg-case silk protein TuSp1 and the orbweb capture spiral silk protein Flag is especially surprising given their dissimilar functions and repetitive
sequence properties. A correlation between spidroin phylogeny and silk ecological use might predict a close relationship between Flag and other silk proteins used in
orb-webs, such as the temporary scaffolding protein
MiSp. Flag may alternatively be expected to share recent
ancestry with orbicularian MaSp2 proteins, because both
contain numerous iterations of the proline containing
GPGXn structural module that forms elastic nano-springs
[15]. Our phylogenetic hypothesis instead suggests more
radical shifts in silk use subsequent to spidroin gene
duplication, as well as convergent evolution of GPGXn
modules that impart fibers with greater extensibility.

Conclusions
The presence of a similar, non-repetitive N-terminal
domain in spidroin proteins across divergent spider
lineages supports its participation in a general mechanism
of spider silk production. Sequence conservation of these
N-termini makes them an unequalled resource for reconstructing spidroin phylogeny. The improved

Garb et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:243

understanding of spidroin relationships we provide using
both N- and C-terminal domains shows that there is considerable evolutionary flexibility throughout the spider silk
system, from the level of gene sequence motif to paralog
number and silk gland expression pattern. This dynamic,
labile nature of silk evolution is in stark contrast to the
incredible homogeneity of repeats within some spidroins
(e.g., 100% identity in consecutive 1026 bp repeats; [7])
and the consistently high-performing mechanical properties of silk fibers (e.g., dragline silks, [2]). Given the elevated rate of sequence rearrangement and turnover in the
repetitive region, the spidroin N- and C-terminal domains
are not only important for the biochemistry of silk fiber
production, but also serve as signposts for retracing the
history of the ancient and functionally diverse spider silks.
