Abstract
Background: Golden moles (Chrysochloridae) are small, subterranean, afrotherian mammals from South Africa and
neighboring regions. Of the 21 species now recognized, some (e.g., Chrysochloris asiatica, Amblysomus hottentotus)
are relatively common, whereas others (e.g., species of Chrysospalax, Cryptochloris, Neamblysomus) are rare and
endangered. Here, we use a combined analysis of partial sequences of the nuclear GHR gene and morphological
characters to derive a phylogeny of species in the family Chrysochloridae.
Results: Although not all nodes of the combined analysis have high support values, the overall pattern of
relationships obtained from different methods of phylogeny reconstruction allow us to make several
recommendations regarding the current taxonomy of golden moles. We elevate Huetia to generic status to include
the species leucorhinus and confirm the use of the Linnean binomial Carpitalpa arendsi, which belongs within
Amblysominae along with Amblysomus and Neamblysomus. A second group, Chrysochlorinae, includes
Chrysochloris, Cryptochloris, Huetia, Eremitalpa, Chrysospalax, and Calcochloris. Bayesian methods make
chrysochlorines paraphyletic by placing the root within them, coinciding with root positions favored by a majority
of randomly-generated outgroup taxa. Maximum Parsimony (MP) places the root either between chrysochlorines
and amblysomines (with Chlorotalpa as sister taxon to amblysomines), or at Chlorotalpa, with the former two
groups reconstructed as monophyletic in all optimal MP trees.
Conclusions: The inclusion of additional genetic loci for this clade is important to confirm our taxonomic results
and resolve the chrysochlorid root. Nevertheless, our optimal topologies support a division of chrysochlorids into
amblysomines and chrysochlorines, with Chlorotalpa intermediate between the two. Furthermore, evolution of the
chrysochlorid malleus exhibits homoplasy. The elongate malleus has evolved just once in the CryptochlorisChrysochloris group; other changes in shape have occurred at multiple nodes, regardless of how the root is
resolved.

Background
Golden moles (Chrysochloridae) are small, burrowing
mammals endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Bronner and
Jenkins [1] divide the group into nine genera and 21
species, most of which are recorded from South Africa.
They have been dubbed “spectacularly autapomorphic”
[2] and are among the most unusual of mammals, showing three long bones in the forearm [3], hypertrophied
middle ear ossicles [4-6], and a hyoid-mandible articulation [7], among other features. They converge in many
ways on the phenotype of other subterranean mammals,

such as lipotyphlan moles (Talpidae), burrowing rodents
(Bathyergidae), certain armadillos (Chlamyphorus), and
marsupial moles (Notoryctidae), but lack a close phylogenetic relationship with these other groups. Rather,
chrysochlorids are now understood to be part of
Afrotheria, a radiation of endemic African mammals,
also including hyracoids (hyraxes), proboscideans
(elephants), sirenians (sea cows), macroscelidids (sengis
or elephant shrews), tubulidentates (aardvarks), and tenrecids (tenrecs) [8-12].
Previous taxonomic treatments of chrysochlorids have
differed not only in terms of the implied intra-familial
interrelationships, but also in the number of genera
used to categorize a roughly similar hypodigm of extant

species. In contrast to the nine genera given by Bronner
and Jenkins [1], the number of genera recognized by
other authors ranges from five to seven [13-15]. Uncertainty surrounding difference among previous taxonomic
treatments are likely the result of emphasis on of different types of characters that vary in phylogenetic signal.
The only previous, character-based phylogenies of
chrysochlorids were based on hyoid shape [7], chromosome morphology [16], and craniodental anatomy [17]
from approximately a dozen species (Fig. 1A). Simonetta
[13] also presented an estimate of chrysochlorid interrelationships (Fig. 1B), but did not base his on an explicit
matrix of morphological or molecular data. These
published trees contradict at least some genus-level relationships frequently implied in the literature [18]. For
example, both Simonetta [13] and Bronner [17] imply
paraphyly of the genus Chrysochloris, consisting of the
Cape golden mole, Chrysochloris asiatica, and a tropical
congener, C. stuhlmanni (Fig. 1). The geographical disparity of Chrysochloris populations—with over 3000 km
separating the Western Cape province of South Africa
(C. asiatica) from the region surrounding Lake Victoria
(C. stuhlmanni)—lends itself to the possibility of genuslevel paraphyly. Similarly, occurrences within what previous authors [1] referred to as Calcochloris are

separated by at least 2000 km: C. obtusirostris in southern Mozambique and “C.” leucorhinus in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Angola. Other classifications
of leucorhinus (e.g., in the genus Chlorotalpa [15] along
with C. duthieae and C. sclateri from South Africa) do
not improve the geographic cohesiveness of this taxon.
Hence, the monophyly of some chrysochlorid genera
has not been consistently supported [13,17] and
deserves to be tested.
Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the Chrysochloridae based on 145 morphological characters from
the cranium, dentition, and skeleton, combined with
approximately 700-900 bases from exon 10 of the
nuclear Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) gene for 18
of the group’s currently recognized 21 species. This
locus has frequently been applied to questions regarding
afrotherian systematics [e.g., [19,20]], and along with
other nuclear sequences supports a sister-group relationship between chrysochlorids and tenrecids [e.g.,
[10]]. This study attempts to provide an evolutionary
basis for chrysochlorid classification and thereby aid the
process of understanding chrysochlorid systematics and
evolution.

Results
The Chrysochloridae and several clades within it are
recovered with high support from our Bayesian and MP
analyses of the combined morphology-GHR dataset
(Fig. 2), including the genera Amblysomus, Neamblysomus, Chlorotalpa, and Chrysospalax. The genus Chrysochloris, including both C. stuhlmanni from near Lake
Victoria and C. asiatica from the Western Cape, is also
supported as monophyletic with high Bayesian but low
MP support (Fig. 2). Both MP and Bayesian analyses
support the sister taxon status of Cryptochloris and
Chrysochloris, again with Bayesian support higher than
that from MP. In agreement with both Simonetta (reference thirteen: fig. 2) and Bronner [17], “Calcochloris”
leucorhinus does not form a clade with Calcochloris
obtusirostris in either the Bayesian or MP analyses
(Fig. 2), making Calcochloris (sensu [17]) paraphyletic.
For this reason, we regard Huetia (previously used as a
subgenus [1]) as the appropriate generic name for the
species leucorhinus.
The association of Carpitalpa arendsi with Neamblysomus (Fig. 2) is consistent with the recognition of
Carpitalpa as a distinct genus [1], in contrast to previous classifications which assigned arendsi to either
Chlorotalpa [18] or Amblysomus [14]. Amblysomus and
Chlorotalpa comprise successively distant sister taxa to
the Carpitalpa-Neamblysomus clade following our optimal Bayesian trees; MP agrees concerning Amblysomus
but does not consistently resolve the position of
Chlorotalpa.

some species of Amblysomus). Colored letters adjacent to clades correspond to the partitioned branch support analysis presented in Table 1.
Green = positive HBS, red = negative HBS, black = additive HBS (see Table 1).

Bayesian analyses do not resolve the chrysochlorid
root, but favor Eremitalpa and a Huetia-ChrysochlorisCryptochloris group as the basal-most taxa (Fig. 2A).
Results from MP also show an unresolved root, but differ by reconstructing chrysochlorines as monophyletic
(Fig. 2B). In half of the optimal trees, MP places the
root between monophyletic chrysochlorines and amblysomines plus Chlorotalpa, or with Chlorotalpa itself as
the basal-most clade, also with a monophyletic Chrysochlorinae and Amblysominae. Despite this difference,
the unrooted topologies supported by Bayesian and MP
algorithms are mutually consistent (Fig. 3).
To further examine the position of the root, and to
infer the node potentially most susceptible to long
branch attraction [21], we tested the affinities of 100

randomly-generated taxa, each of which was used in
turn as the outgroup for an MP analysis of our 18 chrysochlorid taxa. As depicted in Fig. 3, 36 of these outgroups rooted the chrysochlorid tree at or within
Chrysospalax, 23 at Eremitalpa, 7 at or within Neamblysomus, 6 at Carpitalpa, 6 at Calcochloris, and 5 at or
within Chrysochloris. Seven random outgroups yielded
topologies that lacked a resolved root in a majority rule
consensus of the optimal trees for that analysis. The
remaining root-positions exhibited by the randomly-generated outgroups occurred at frequencies between 1-4
(Fig. 3). Hence, the equally-weighted MP analysis of
GHR, morphology, and indels (Fig. 2B) does not root
the chrysochlorid tree near the branches to which the
greatest number of randomly generated outgroups are

proportional to number of changes obtained in MP tree #2 [see Additional file 1] derived from the combined dataset, using assigned branch
length in PAUP and assuming accelerated transformations (ACCTRAN). Dashed lines for Amblysomus are diagrammatic only. Squares indicate the
two root positions (i.e., where Tenrecidae attaches) favored by 4 of 8 optimal MP trees (Fig. 2B), stars those favored by the majority of Bayesian
post-burnin topologies (Fig. 2A). The branch leading to Tenrecidae is 106 steps; the longest intra-chrysochlorid branches are those leading to
Chrysospalax and Eremitalpa at 15 steps each. Circles denote nodes to which the 100 randomly generated outgroup taxa were attracted, and are
proportionately larger when more random outgroups attach at that node (indicated by the number within/adjacent to each circle). Seven of the
randomly generated outgroups did not yield a resolved position for the root.

attracted, but the Bayesian analysis does. As previously
noted, the optimal MP trees show a root at either
Chlorotalpa or between chrysochlorines and amblysomines+Chlorotalpa. Only four of the 100 randomly-generated outgroups rooted the chrysochlorid tree adjacent
to these nodes (Fig. 3). Bayesian analyses, in contrast,
more frequently rooted the chrysochlorid topology at or
near one of the longest branches within the chrysochlorid tree, albeit without strong support values.
Overall, both MP and Bayesian algorithms agree on
the basic branching pattern within chrysochlorids
(Fig. 3): an Amblysomus-Neamblysomus-Carpitalpa
group, a Chrysospalax-Calcochloris-Chrysochloris-Cryptochloris-Huetia-Eremitalpa group, with the two species
of Chlorotalpa between the two. However, we acknowledge that support indices for most basal nodes remain
low, and we cannot yet be certain about the position of
the chrysochlorid root.
Fig. 4 shows the trees supported by the GHR (Figs.
4A, B) and morphology (Fig. 4C) partitions examined

separately. Aspects of non-chrysochlorid afrotherian
phylogeny are discussed elsewhere [20]. For chrysochlorids, the molecular and morphological partitions agree on
supporting Amblysomus, Chrysospalax, Neamblysomus,
and Chrysochloridae. Morphology alone does not
resolve most supra-generic clades, and where resolution
exists, support is weak. It does resolve a NeamblysomusAmblysomus clade, but without Carpitalpa arendsi as
portrayed in the combined (Fig. 2) and GHR (Figs. 4A,
B) datasets. Morphological data weakly support an
Eremitalpa-Cryptochloris clade and a Chlorotalpa-Carpitalpa-Calcochloris-Huetia-Amblysomus-Neamblysomus
clade, groupings which collapse when MP is relaxed by
one step. Nevertheless, as documented elsewhere
[22-24], the performance of a given partition in isolation
should not prevent its combination with other datasets.

support with addition of morphology and indels, 4 do
not change, and 3 show decreased branch support.

Discussion
As noted above, the morphological partition alone does
not recover most suprageneric clades of the combineddata analysis, and weakly disagrees with many aspects of
the GHR tree (Fig. 4). However, it has been demonstrated that a given clade may receive support from a
combined dataset even when that clade lacks support
from every partition analyzed in isolation [22,23]. For
example, at high taxonomic levels within placental
mammals, morphology (among other partitions) has
been shown to contribute positively to clade support in
a combined analysis, whether or not that clade is present in a tree derived from morphological data alone
[24]. For the present dataset, the addition of the morphological partition improves branch support for the
majority of nodes present in both the optimal MP and
Bayesian topologies of the combined dataset (Fig. 2;
Table 1). This observation is consistent with the observation made elsewhere [22-24], based on independent
datasets, in which interaction between partitions can
increase support beyond the sum of branch supports
obtained from partitions in isolation (i.e., “hidden

support” of [22]). Hence, we base our discussion on the
combined-data tree.
Our results are partly congruent with the suggestion
of Bronner and Jenkins [1] that chrysochlorids may be
divided into two clades: Amblysominae and Chrysochlorinae, although their content is different according
to our results. We place Amblysomus, Neamblysomus,
and Carpitalpa arendsi in Amblysominae. The Chrysochlorinae of Bronner and Jenkins [1], excluding Carpitalpa and Chlorotalpa, is a potentially monophyletic
clade (Figs. 2B, 3), and is weakly supported as such by
our MP analyses of the combined data (Fig. 2B).
However, additional data are necessary to address the
possibility that the chrysochlorid root falls within this
group, possibly near Eremitalpa (Fig. 2A). For ease of
discussion, we use the terms amblysomines and chrysochlorines as defined above, but acknowledge that the
latter term may be rendered paraphyletic with further
phylogenetic scrutiny.
Morphological character evolution

As noted previously, chrysochlorids share a number of
features (e.g., three forearm long-bones, hyoid-mandible
articulation, hypertrophied malleus) seldom seen elsewhere among living mammals. In the case of ossicular

Numbers below each partition name represent optimal treelength for clade in left-most column; column “WO” indicates optimal treelength without that clade;
column “BS” indicates branch support for that clade from partition (i.e., partition WO - partition). Hidden Branch Support (HBS, see [22-24]) represents the
difference between combined branch support and the sum of branch support from each partition. Positive HBS (plain text) indicates more support from
combined analysis than from sum of partitions; negative HBS (bold) indicates support for clade lower in combined analysis relative to sum of partitions; zero HBS
(italic) indicates additive branch support (support for clade the same in combined and in sum of partitions).

morphology, considerable variation exists across chrysochlorid species [4-6,25,26]. Amblysomus, Neamblysomus,
and Calcochloris show a relatively small malleus (Fig.
5A), unlike the elongate, club-shaped ossicle seen in
Chrysochloris and Cryptochloris (Fig. 5D). The mallear
head is enlarged and globular in Eremitalpa (Fig. 5E)
and Chrysospalax (Fig. 5F), and is also globular but only
slightly enlarged (relative to Amblysomus) in Chlorotalpa (Fig. 5B), Huetia, and Carpitalpa (Fig. 5C). Those
taxa with a club-shaped malleus all possess a substantial
bulge in the posterior aspect of their orbitotemporal
fossa, known as the temporal bulla, which serves as a
dorsal continuation of the epitympanic recess for housing the enlarged malleus (Fig. 6). The globular malleus
of Eremitalpa is sufficiently large that it too results in
an externally visible temporal bulla (Fig. 6C). In the
other taxa with a globular malleus (Chlorotalpa, Huetia,
and Carpitalpa), the ossicle is smaller and does not
result in an externally distinct temporal bulla.

There are a number of other variations on chrysochlorid mallear morphology not accounted for in the
current morphological matrix, such as orientation of the
manubrium mallei, shared for example in Eremitalpa
and Chrysochloris but not in Chrysospalax (Fig. 5; M.
Mason pers. commun. and [4-6]). Here, we focus on
size and shape of the mallear head, which has figured
prominently in previous classifications. This region
guided the classification of Simonetta [13], who stated
“[mallear] morphology pointed to three divergent evolutionary trends, so that the family could be ... divided
into three subfamilies” (p. 33 of ref. [13]). He further
implied the intuitive view that the “normal” (i.e., small)
malleus of Amblysomus is primitive, and inferred a
“morphological sequence” from Amblysomus to the taxa
with a globular malleus to the “extreme” club-shape
observed in Chrysochloris.
Interestingly, the taxa most frequently inferred as
basal by Bayesian analyses possess an enlarged, globular

malleus (i.e., Eremitalpa), a slightly enlarged malleus
(Huetia), or an elongate malleus (Chrysochloris and
Cryptochloris). If such a taxon occupies the base of the
chrysochlorid tree, then Simonetta’s intuition about the
character evolution of the chysochlorid malleus is
wrong: taxa with an unenlarged malleus (Amblysomus,
Neamblysomus, Calcochloris) occupy relatively nested
branches. In contrast, the root supported by four of the

eight MP analyses (Fig. 3) shows Calcochloris obtusirostris (with a small malleus) at the base of a monophyletic
Chrysochlorinae, which forms the sister taxon of a
Chlorotalpa-amblysomine clade. This scenario is potentially consistent with the view that a small malleus
(Fig. 5A) characterized the basal-most living chrysochlorids, with enlargement occurring independently
within each subfamily. Most phylogenies of Afrotheria

support a tenrec-golden mole association [10,11], and
one would expect that the chrysochlorid common
ancestor with other afrotherians would have had relatively small ear ossicles. Their scant fossil record [27,28]
indicates that Miocene chrysochlorids lacked a temporal
bulla and therefore would not have had a mallear head
of the kind seen in Chrysochloris (Fig. 5D), Eremitalpa
(Fig. 5E), or Chrysospalax (Fig. 5F).
Previous discussions of mallear evolution in chrysochlorids have also noted the high probability of homoplasy in this region [4,5,26]. While we cannot yet
resolve the position of the chrysochlorid root, all of our
optimal trees agree with recent authors that mallear
enlargement has not occurred in a simple progression
from small, to globular, to elongate. The paraphyly of
chrysochlorids with an enlarged, globular malleus indicates the presence of homoplasy in the occurrence and
direction of ossicular enlargement.
Based on the phylogeny in Fig. 2, a few additional
morphological characters optimize with relatively low
homoplasy across chrysochlorids. The position of the
foramen ovale relative to the foramen for the inferior
ramus of the stapedial artery (Fig. 7) shows relatively little homoplasy in the optimal MP and Bayesian trees: the
two are confluent in chrysochlorines (except Calcochloris) and distinct in amblysomines and Chlorotalpa.
The position of foramen ovale relative to the sphenorbital fissure (Fig. 7) also distinguishes most members of
the two groups: in amblysomines and Chlorotalpa sclateri they are separated in the ventral part of the temporal fossa, whereas in Chlorotalpa duthieae and most
chrysochlorines (but not Huetia or Calcochloris) they
are situated close together.
Dentally, most chrysochlorines (except for Chrysospalax) lack talonids on their lower ultimate premolar (Fig.
8), whereas these are present in amblysomines (except
for Neamblysomus julianae) and Chlorotalpa. Talonids
on the molars are similarly lacking in chrysochlorines
(except Chrysospalax and Chrysochloris stuhlmanni), but
present in amblysomines (except Neamblysomus) and
Chlorotalpa. The overall number of teeth in each jaw
quadrant—10 in those taxa with a full complement of
three molars and 9 in taxa with just two—has also figured prominently in previous chrysochlorid classifications. However, reduction of molars is restricted to
Amblysomus, Calcochloris, and is variable in Neamblysomus. As such, this feature is not diagnostic for the
supra-generic clades indicated in this study.

Conclusions
Our data support the validity of Carpitalpa arendsi, the
removal of the equatorial species leucorhinus from Calcochloris, Chlorotalpa, and Amblysomus, the integrity of
most chrysochlorid genera, such as Chrysochloris

including species from both equatorial Africa (C. stuhlmanni) and the Western Cape province of South Africa
(C. asiatica), and the association of Cryptochloris with
Chrysochloris [40] and of Amblysomus with the Neamblysomus-Carpitalpa clade. We amend previous chrysochlorid taxonomies by using Huetia as the appropriate
genus-level designation for H. leucorhinus. Both MP and
Bayesian analyses support a similar unrooted topology,
with amblysomines as defined above and chrysochlorines consisting of Chrysochloris, Cryptochloris, Huetia,
Chrysospalax, and Calcochloris. Chlorotalpa is favored
as the sister taxon to amblysomines in Bayesian analyses; whereas in the consensus of optimal MP trees,
Chlorotalpa appears in an unresolved trichotomy with
monophyletic amblysomines and chrysochlorines
(Fig. 2B). Bayesian analyses weakly support a root within
Chrysochlorinae, near Eremitalpa or a ChrysochlorisCryptochloris-Huetia clade. As noted above, MP yields a
trichotomy at the root. The fact that an intra-chrysochlorine placement of the root in some of our analyses
corresponds with the region of the tree that frequently
attracts randomly generated outgroup taxa leads us to
regard the position of the chrysochlorid root as still
unresolved and in need of further study.
An incremental, small-to-large evolution of one of the
most peculiar chrysochlorid features—the enlarged malleus—is not supported by our analysis. According to
topologies supported by Bayesian techniques, chrysochlorid species with a small malleus (Amblysomus,
Neamblysomus, Calcochloris) are nested, not basal,
within the chrysochlorid radiation. However, optimal
MP topologies cannot rule out a small malleus characterizing the basal-most chrysochlorid branch. Furthermore, and regardless of the position of the root, change
in mallear size has occurred multiple times during the
history of this insectivoran-grade radiation of afrotherian
mammals.

Methods
We obtained new GHR sequences of 17 chrysochlorid
species and appended them to GHR alignment #1 of
Asher and Hofreiter [[20]; see Additional file 1]. As
detailed in Table 2, skulls from the collections of the
Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (ZMB) and the Transvaal Museum Pretoria (TM) comprised source material
for five of these taxa. For these specimens we followed
the DNA extraction procedure described in [20]. To
control for potential sequencing artifacts, we followed
[20] and [29]. Additional file 2 shows individual BLAST
results for GHR sequence fragments derived from
museum skulls. In every case, the closest match on GenBank was to the existing chrysochlorid (Chrysospalax
trevelyani AF392877 from [30]), with a percent similarity ranging from 91-100. In most cases the match was

not identical, either to the GenBank sequence or across
our samples. Given the fact that some regions of GHR
exon 10 are highly conserved across mammals and the
relatively short length of our amplified fragments (ca.
60-160 bp), it is not surprising that a small number
match entirely. Overall, we view this result as evidence
that our sequences are genuine and not influenced by
contamination.

The remainder of our chrysochlorid sample derived
from work undertaken at the Universities of Pretoria
and Cape Town (Table 2). Methods for obtaining partial
GHR sequences from these taxa are as follows: genomic
DNA was extracted from frozen or ethanol-preserved
tissues using standard phenol-chloroform procedures
[31]. A 767 bp fragment was amplified for 16 samples
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, [32]) and

primers GHR-For 5’-AGCCATTCATGGCAACTATAAATC-3’, and GHR-Rev 5’-ARGGCAAGGCAGTTGCTTGAG -3’ (modifications from those
previously published by [8]). PCR reactions were done
from 50 - 100 ng DNA using 1 unit of Supertherm Taq
polymerase (Southern Cross Biotechnologies) in a 50 μl
mixture consisting of 1× reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2
and 2 mM of each dNTP, 10 pM of each primer and
ddH2O under the following cycling conditions: initial
denaturation for 2 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of

Page 10 of 13

denaturation (30 sec) at 94°C, primer-annealing at 60 62°C (30 sec), primer-extension (45 sec) at 72°C; final
extension of 5 min at 72°C. The resulting products were
purified using isopropanol/ammonium acetate precipitation and were sequenced in both directions on an automated ABI 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Johannesburg, South Africa) using ABI PRISM Big
DyeTM Terminator version 3.1 chemistry (Applied
Biosystems). Nucleotide sequence alignments were constructed in ClustalX (v. 1.82 [33]) and subsequently
translated to amino acids in MacClade (v. 3.0 [34]) to
verify the functional reading frame. The GHR alignment
of specimens amplified from both museum skulls and
tissue samples comprised a matrix of up to 913 aligned
nucleotides, of which 211 were parsimony informative
[see Additional file 1].
Discrete morphological characters based on the matrix
of Asher and Hofreiter [20] were collected using
museum collections in Pretoria, Cape Town, King William’s Town, Cambridge, London, Berlin, Stockholm,
and New York. A total of 337 character states are distributed across 144 characters [see Additional file 3]. Of
these characters, 45 are postcranial, 37 derive from the
dentition and mandible, and 62 are from other parts of
the cranium. These characters are graphically documented at http://www.morphobank.org[35]. Indels were
recorded as in [20] and were entered as binary characters following the GHR alignment [see Additional file 1].
Gaps within the GHR alignment were treated as missing
data.
Parsimony (MP) analyses were undertaken with PAUP
4.0b10 [36], using heuristic searches with at least 500
random addition replicates using TBR branch swapping,
multiple states treated as polymorphic, and branches
collapsed unless they have at least one unambiguous
optimization ("COLLAPSE = MINBRLEN”). All morphological character state changes were accorded equal
weight. MP bootstrap values were calculated based on
500 pseudoreplicates of a simple addition sequence.
Analysis of the partitions shown in Table 1 was conducted using MP for each partition separately, using a
heuristic search as above but with 100 random addition
replicates.
Bayesian analyses were implemented using MrBayes
3.1 [37], using the HKY+G model as recommended by
the AIC in MrModeltest 2.1 [38]. We used the default
models for our morphological (i.e., Mk [39]) and indel
(i.e., restriction site [37]) partitions, setting MrBayes to
infer coding bias assuming that only variable characters
can be observed for both ("CODING = VARIABLE”).
Additional analyses assuming “CODING = ALL” for the
morphological partition did not appreciably change the
optimal topologies. Bayesian analyses were undertaken
using four independent runs, each using a random

starting tree and 1,000,000 generations with one cold
and three heated chains, sampling trees every 100 generations. These reached stationarity by 10,000 generations (i.e., after the first 100 trees), at which point
likelihood scores reached an asymptote and did not
greatly change in value. Hence, Bayesian trees and posterior probabilities derive from a majority-rule consensus of the last 9901 trees for the first of the four
independent runs, ignoring the first 100 as “burn-in”. In
each case, the four runs of 1,000,000 generations converged on a consistent topology. Likelihood analysis
(including bootstraps) of the GHR data alone also used
PAUP [36] and the HKY+G model as estimated by the
AIC in MrModeltest [38], i.e., transition/transversion
ratio = 2.2696, nucleotide frequencies A = 0.2805,

C = 0.265, G = 0.2218, T = 0.2327, assumed proportion
of invariable sites = none, distribution of rates at variable sites = gamma, shape parameter = 0.8383.
In order to investigate the part(s) of the chrysochlorid
tree most attracted to a long branch, we followed a
method described by Sullivan and Swofford [21]. That
is, we generated 100 artificial taxa, composed of 913
randomly picked nucleotides (consistent with the number of aligned nucleotides and base frequencies [A 28%,
C 27%, G 22%, T 23%] observed in the outgroup taxon
Elephantulus [similar to other potential outgroups], chosen arbitrarily among afrotherian taxa known to be close
to chrysochlorids), followed by randomly generated
morphological (145) and indel (8) characters, all of
which were binary. Each of these randomly generated

“outgroups” was successively used as the root for an MP
analysis sampling our 18 chrysochlorids, preserving
unchanged their GHR, morphology, and indel characters. MP searches were heuristic, as described above, but
with 25 random addition replicates. The position of the
root was noted in each of the 100 simulations. For those
analyses that did not yield a resolved root in the strict
consensus, a 50% majority rule consensus was used (13
cases). Seven out of 100 cases did not yield a resolved
root using majority rule and were ignored.
