Abstract
Background: Macrophages, osteoclasts, dendritic cells, and microglia are highly specialized cells
that belong to the mononuclear phagocyte system. Functional and phenotypic heterogeneity within
the mononuclear phagocyte system may reveal differentiation plasticity of a common progenitor,
but developmental pathways leading to such diversity are still unclear.
Results: Mouse bone marrow cells were expanded in vitro in the presence of Flt3-ligand (FL),
yielding high numbers of non-adherent cells exhibiting immature monocyte characteristics. Cells
expanded for 6 days, 8 days, or 11 days (day 6-FL, day 8-FL, and day 11-FL cells, respectively)
exhibited constitutive potential towards macrophage differentiation. In contrast, they showed timedependent potential towards osteoclast, dendritic, and microglia differentiation that was detected
in day 6-, day 8-, and day 11-FL cells, in response to M-CSF and receptor activator of NFκB ligand
(RANKL), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNFα), and glial cell-conditioned medium (GCCM), respectively. Analysis of cell
proliferation using the vital dye CFSE revealed homogenous growth in FL-stimulated cultures of
bone marrow cells, demonstrating that changes in differential potential did not result from
sequential outgrowth of specific precursors.

Conclusions: We propose that macrophages, osteoclasts, dendritic cells, and microglia may arise
from expansion of common progenitors undergoing sequential differentiation commitment. This
study also emphasizes differentiation plasticity within the mononuclear phagocyte system.
Furthermore, selective massive cell production, as shown here, would greatly facilitate investigation
of the clinical potential of dendritic cells and microglia.

Background
The mononuclear phagocyte system encompasses a widely distributed family of related cells exhibiting highly specialized functions such as macrophages, osteoclasts,
dendritic cells, and microglia. Resident macrophages,
found in most organs and connective tissues, serve as professional phagocytes, removing pathogens or apoptotic
cells [1]. Microglia represents a unique category of mononuclear phagocytes distributed throughout the central
nervous system (CNS) parenchyma in both white and
grey matter [2]. Microglial cells share a number of immunological markers with other mononuclear phagocytes,
yet they present a unique ramified morphology, which is
best characterized by electron microscopy [3]. Besides
their role as immune effectors of the CNS, microglial cells
exert non-immunological functions, including production of neurotrophic factors and glutamate uptake [4,5].
Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized in capturing antigens
and initiating immune response through naive T-cell activation [6], and are also implicated in maintaining tolerance to self-antigen [7]. The diverse functions of DCs in
immune regulation are dictated by the instructions they
received during innate immune responses to different
pathogens, but DC response may be also lineage-dependent as distinct myeloid and lymphoid DC lineages have
been recently identified [8]. Osteoclasts are multinucleated, adherent, bone-resorbing cells found in the bone vicinity. They play an essential role in bone remodelling, as
well as in regulating calcium homeostasis [9].
Functional and phenotypic heterogeneity within the
mononuclear phagocyte system may reveal differentiation
plasticity of a common progenitor, but the developmental
pathways leading to macrophages, osteoclasts, DCs, or
microglia are still unclear. Cell transfer experiments have
established that alveolar macrophages in the lung, and
Kupfer cells in the liver, derive from mature monocytes
[10]. Late monocyte precursors have been shown to differentiate into osteoclasts in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of
NFκB ligand (RANKL) [9,11]. Similarly, DCs could be derived from circulating human monocytes following stimulation with GM-CSF and interleukin-4 [12], or from
human CD34+ myeloid progenitors using GM-CSF and
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) [13]. Furthermore, bone
marrow progenitors were recently identified through their
ability to differentiate into DCs or osteoclasts, depending

on whether RANKL was combined to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) or M-CSF, respectively [14]. Whereas microglia has been well
characterized in vivo and in vitro, little is known about microglial precursors, and attempts to induce in vitro microglial differentiation of mature or immature monocytes
have been unsuccessful [3,15]. However, recent in vivo
studies have shown that microglia and other CNS resident
cells (macroglia and neurons) are continuously renewed
from as yet uncharacterized progenitors originating from
the adult bone marrow which are, themselves or their
progeny, able to cross the blood-brain barrier and give rise
to mature microglia [16,17]. Altogether, data from the literature plead for the myeloid origin of macrophages, osteoclasts, DCs, and microglia. However, a global approach
proved necessary for delineating lineage relationships
within the mononuclear phagocyte system. In particular,
learning how cellular diversity is generated in this cellular
system is of great importance regarding cellular or gene
therapy protocols.
Here we describe ex vivo expansion of murine myeloid
cells in response to Flt3 ligand (FL) and investigate their
response to cytokines inducing differentiation towards
macrophages (M-CSF), osteoclasts (M-CSF plus RANKL),
dendritic cells (GM-CSF plus TNFα), or microglia (glialcell conditioned medium: GCCM). Results support a
model based on the sequential commitment of Flt3+
bone-marrow progenitors.

Results
FL expands a continuum of macrophage precursors from
mouse bone marrow cells
FL exerts potent stimulatory effects on precursors of the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, alone or in combination
with M-CSF [10,18]. Furthermore, it was recently shown
that FL stimulates generation of DC precursors [19,20] or
macrophages [18] when used alone, and that of osteoclasts in combination with RANKL [21]. In our conditions, bone marrow cell proliferation was observed for at
least 11 days in the presence of FL (Figure. 1A). FL was
used at 5 ng/ml FL throughout the present study, as this
dose was sufficient to initiate bone-marrow cell proliferation (Figure. 1B). More than 90% of non-adherent day 6
cells (day 6-FL cells) and day 8 cells (day 8-FL cells) were
viable cells, but FL-stimulated cultures showed decreasing
cell viability from day 8 of culture (not shown). Re-feed-

ing day-8 cultures with 5 ng/ml FL resulted in only slightly
increased viability of day-11 FL cells while it strongly stimulated cell proliferation (data not shown).
Next, we asked whether FL-stimulated growth between
day 6 and day 11 could be accounted for by continuous
expansion of a common progenitor cell population. Using CFSE labelling, we show that day 6-FL cells as well as
day 8-FL cells actively and synchronously divided, consistent with rapid and homogeneous outgrowth of FL-cells
(Fig. 1C). We conclude that the whole day 6-FL cell population generates day 8-FL cells that are precursors of day
11-FL cells.
Day 6-FL cells express a homogeneous immunophenotype suggestive of maturing monocytic cells: CD11b+,
CD115+ (M-CSF receptor) and F4/80-, a macrophage
marker (Fig. 2A). Consistently, cells showed high nucleus/
cytoplasm ratio, basophilic cytoplasm and bean- or ringshaped nuclei (Fig. 2B). At later culture times, FL-stimulated cells maintained CD11b expression, but acquired ex-

pression of markers expressed on DCs, such as DEC 205
and CD11c, at day 8, and F4/80, at day 11 (Fig. 2A). Modulation of cell-surface marker expression suggested that
FL-cells might develop various differentiation potentials
along with culture duration.
Macrophage potential of day 6-FL cells can be directed towards osteoclast differentiation
Stimulation of day 6-FL cells with M-CSF for 4 days resulted in limited proliferation, then differentiation into adherent (Fig. 3A), phagocytic (Fig. 3B) macrophage-like
cells. Accordingly, morphology changes were accompanied by decreased CD34 and CD135 (Flt3) expression,
but increased CD11b levels and induced F4/80 expression
(Fig. 3C). Similarly, day 8-FL cells and day 11-FL cells differentiated to macrophages in response to M-CSF, as
shown by expression of F4/80 and CD11b antigens (Fig.
3D), correlating with level of CD115 expression (Fig. 2A).

To determine whether FL-expanded precursors could be
committed towards osteoclasts, a combination of M-CSF
and RANKL was applied to day 6-FL cells, in the absence
of FL. After 6 days of this treatment, large multinucleated
cells were formed and all cells in the cultures were expressing tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) activity, a
classical osteoclast marker (Fig. 4A). Overall, when grown
on dentin slices, cells formed typical resorption pits indicating that they were functional osteoclasts (Fig. 4B).

Macrophage potential of day 8-FL cells can be directed towards myeloid-related DC differentiation
Flt3+ myeloid progenitors purified from mouse bone marrow have been shown to generate both CD8α- and CD8α+
DCs in FL-supplemented cultures [19]. In preliminary experiments, we sought for culture conditions that could
specifically generate myeloid-related DCs and found that
a combination of GM-CSF and TNFα triggered a pure myeloid-related DC differentiation of day 8-FL cells. Differentiation occurred in the absence of [3H]-thymidine
incorporation, but cell viability was greater than 90% (not
shown), indicating massive differentiation of day 8-FL
cells. Mature DC differentiation was assessed by phenotypic, morphological and functional analysis. CD11b expression was maintained, but cells acquired CD11c+,
CD86high, MHCIIhigh, CD80high, CD40+, and CD25high
expression (Fig. 5A), and were negative for CD8α, B220,
IgM, CD3 and CD71 antigens (not shown). Consistent
with mature DC immunophenotype, cells displayed a typical dendritic morphology (Fig. 5B) and elicited greatly
enhanced allogeneic T-cell response compared to syngeneic stimulation (Fig. 5C), whereas they were unable to
effectively phagocyte latex beads (data not shown).

Interestingly, addition of TGFβ directed DC differentiation towards immature immunophenotype (CD80low,
CD86low, MHCIIlow; see Fig. 5A), morphology (shorter
dendrites; see Fig. 5D), and function, as they could phagocyte latex beads (Fig. 5E). They were also potent allostimulatory cells (data not shown). These cells represent a
double-negative CD4-/CD8- immature DC population
but not typical Langerhans cells, as they do not contain
any Birbeck granules (not shown).

Late commitment of macrophage precursors towards microglia differentiation
In order to evaluate microglia differentiation potential,
day 11-FL cells were cultured for 3 or 6 days with or without 50% GCCM. Microglia cells share a number of immunological markers with other classes of mononuclear
phagocytes but present a unique morphology characterized by the presence of multiple cellular processes and micro-spikes or spines [3]. GCCM-treated day 11-FL cells
adhered to plastic, maintained CD11b expression (Fig.
6A, 6B) and 20% of cells developed a ramified morphology and bore actin-filled micro-spikes and pseudopodia
(Fig. 6C). By performing electron microscopy on differentiated day 11-FL cells, we were able to ascertain the typical
morphological features which characterize microglia in
vitro[3]: thread-like structures of 0.05 nm diameter and
cellular processes bearing numerous cell-surface spines of
0.1 nm diameter (Fig. 6D). After 6 days of GCCM treatment, process length reached more than 3 times the cell
body diameter in 20% of cells (Fig. 6E), and more numerous thread-like structures were observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 6E, insert). As reported for cultured
microglia [2,22], differentiated day 11-FL cells exhibited
high cell surface expression of the macrophage markers
CD115, CD11b and F4/80, and low or undetectable expression of CD80, CD86 (Fig. 6F) and MHC class II antigen (data not shown).
Differentiation plasticity of FL-expanded macrophage
precursors is time-dependent
In experiments reported above, FL cells reproducibly differentiated into macrophages in response to M-CSF, whatever duration of the primary culture. Differentiation to
osteoclasts, DCs, and microglia was obtained by cultivating day 6-, day 8- and day-11 FL cells in the presence of MCSF and RANKL, GM-CSF and TNFα, or GCCM, respectively. Time-course studies showed that these conditions
were optimal (Fig. 7). Indeed, osteoclast differentiation
sharply decreased between day 6 and day 11 of primary
cultures (Fig. 7A). Differentiation to mature DCs in response to GM-CSF and TNFα combination was maximal
with day 8-FL cells, as shown by CD11c expression (Fig.
7B). Finally, percentage of typical microglial cells obtained in response to GCCM reached a peak using day 11FL cells (Fig. 7C). These data clearly confirmed that differentiation ability of macrophage precursors was dependent
on the duration of the primary cultures.

Discussion
The culture system described here is to our knowledge the
first to enable mass selective production of pure osteoclasts, pure CD8α- DCs, and pure macrophages, thus providing a unique tool to study primary cells from the
mononuclear phagocyte system. Indeed, bone marrow
from a single mouse (7–10 × 107 cells) currently yields 1–

2 × 107 osteoclasts, 2–3 × 108 DCs, or 1–2 × 108 macrophages. In particular, this protocol will facilitate investigations on genetically modified cells obtained from
transgenic or knockout mice, or following retrovirus-mediated cell transfer.

CFSE monitoring of cell division demonstrated that most
day 6-FL cells are precursors of day 8-FL cells. Both cell
types were shown to be macrophage precursors endowed
with osteoclast or prominent DC differentiation potential, respectively. As both proliferation and cell mortality
were limited or absent during the differentiation process
(not shown), we conclude that osteoclast or DC differentiation of FL cells was not preceded by preferential expansion of distinct precursor sub-populations. Thus we
propose that Flt3+ macrophage precursors commit sequentially to osteoclast and DC differentiation, possibly
through time-dependent expression of intracellular factors. Consistent with this model, Miyamoto et al. have recently demonstrated that M-CSF and GM-CSF regulate
differentiation of osteoclasts and DC from a common precursor whether they express c-Fos or not, respectively [14].
It remains to be shown whether FL-expanded osteoclast
precursors are identical or not to those previously described by Arai et al. [11].
The protocol described in the present paper also represents a powerful tool for studying microglia differentiation control mechanisms. It now becomes possible to
determine which soluble factors in GCCM induce microglia differentiation. In addition to macrophages and microglia, day 11-FL cells could also differentiate to DCs (30
to 40%), though less efficiently than day 8-FL cells (>
90%). It was recently suggested that native microglia are
uncommitted precursors of DC and macrophages [23].
However, it is not clear whether this results from microglia plasticity or de-differentiation to an uncommitted
precursor. In that respect, day 11-FL cells, that have no microglia characteristics, may represent a valuable model to
delineate the relationship between DC and microglia
pathways.
Facilitating in vitro studies on microglia differentiation
may help to shed some light on several physiopathological processes. Indeed, microglia is the principal immunoeffector cell located in the CNS parenchyma, and its
involvement in pathogenesis has been established for numerous neurological conditions including stroke, trauma
and Alzheimer's disease [24]. Furthermore, bone marrowderived progenitors committed to microglial differentiation should be ideally suited for CNS-targeted gene therapy since they may be able to migrate from blood to brain
through an intact blood-brain barrier [16,17,25].
The unique DC properties of either eliciting immunity or
ensuring self-tolerance [7], make them candidates for enhancing responses against foreign antigens in vaccination
protocols [26] and against tumor antigens in cell immunotherapy [27], as well as making them targets for the
treatment of autoimmunity and allograft rejection [6].

these various fields is a matter of debate that could be
solved with the two culture conditions described, with
and without the use of TGFβ. These last years, substantial
progress were made to characterize distinct subsets of
DCs, based on differential phenotype and function, both
in humans and mice. In mice, all DC subsets described so
far express CD11c [28]. CD8α homodimer expression
now appears to be more related to maturation state than
lineage origin [8]. Flow cytometry analysis of spleen cells
from mice treated with FL for 9 days reveals five pre-DC or
DC subpopulations that occur in distinct microenvironments of the spleen [29]: two putative immature populations, CD11b+ Ly6C+ Gr-1+ (named A, B), and three
CD11c+ DC populations distinguished by CD8α and
CD11b expressions (named C, D, E). Although phenotypic characterization of these DCs does not exactly fit to the
in vitro FL-derived DCs presented in this work, latter cells
are closely related to spleen DCs of myeloid origin, referred to as population C by Pulendran et al.[29].

Differentiation potential of FL cells is time dependent Day 6-, day 8-, and day 11-FL cells were differentiated to
osteoclasts, DCs, and microglia using specific cytokine combinations. Percentage of differentiated cells was measured as
specified below. (A) Cells were grown in presence of M-CSF
and RANKL and the number of osteoclasts was counted 6
days later. Similar results have been consistently obtained in
several experiments. (B) Cells were treated by GM-CSF and
mature DC percentage was determined by flow cytometry
determination of CD11c+ cells. Results are representative of
3 independent experiments. (C) Microglia differentiation was
assessed by detection of ramified cells after cultivating the
cells for 6 days in the presence of GCCM. This experiment is
representative of 4 independent experiments.

Plasmacytoid DCs, also called interferon producing cells
(IPC) were recently characterized in humans and mice
[30–33]. Both myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs were clearly expanded by FL in vivo, with or without GM-CSF mobilization [33]. Recently, Gilliet et al. demonstrated that
plasmacytoid DC precursors are differentially regulated by
FL and GM-CSF [20]. Though cellular phylogeny between
Flt3+ progenitors and DCs become more and more clear,
the relationships between Flt3+ bone-marrow progenitors
(0.3% of total bone marrow cells), lymphoid progenitors
and myeloid progenitors remains to be clarified. Concerning functional aspects, DC-dependent T-cell polarizing activity (Th1-, Th2-, Th3- or Tr-type) is not related to lineage
origin, but rather depends on the stimuli used to activate
these cells, probably due to their equipment and subsequent transduction of pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors, such as Toll receptor family [34].

Conclusions
Based on the present study and data from the literature,
we propose a model where early Flt3+ progenitors commit
themselves to a sequential differentiation program proceeding through narrow windows; each time window corresponds to expression of a specific differentiation
potential (Fig. 8). A first phase of selection (hatched line),
likely through apoptotic death of Flt3- cells, would lead to
Flt3+ cell expansion (plain line). Each time window may
permit generation of different types of precursors able to
differentiate into osteoclasts, then into DCs, and finally,
for 25% of day 11-FL cells, into microglia cells. Moreover,
FL cells can differentiate to macrophages in response to MCSF whatever the duration of primary culture in FL.
Data obtained with transgenic FL-mice and FL deficient
mice support a major role of FL in DC development [35].

Model showing the sequential commitment of FL-expanded precursors to macrophages, osteoclasts, dendritic
cells, and microglia GCCM: glial cell-conditioned medium; IPC: interferon producing cells.

In contrast, development of DC lineages is almost normal
in lymphoid organs of mice deficient for GM-CSF or GMCSF receptor [36]. It would be interesting to test whether
DC differentiation from FL cultivated cells is dependent
on the presence of GM-CSF, or whether it could be obtained in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines or
bacteria-derived products, as recently shown [19]. Indeed,
an attractive hypothesis would be that DCs represent the
default cell type in the progeny of Flt3+ progenitors, unless appropriate microenvironment stimulation is added
to differentiate progenitors to osteoclasts (M-CSF and
RANKL), macrophages (M-CSF) or microglia (GCCM).
Nevertheless, the picture emerging from our study is that
diversity within the mononuclear phagocyte system is
generated from a continuum of macrophage precursors
whose differentiation potential might change as a function of relative ageing and cytokine environment. Whether this sequential commitment process is cellautonomous or depends on paracrine/autocrine loops re-

mains to be determined. However, in vivo experiments
have clearly shown that tissue macrophages may differentiate into lymph-node DCs when exposed to a phagocytic
stimuli [37]. Moreover, microglia could be induced to acquire specific DC or macrophage markers when exposed
to GM-CSF or M-CSF, respectively [23]. Thus, mature
macrophages, DCs, or microglia, may activate latent differentiation programs under appropriate stimuli. We have
shown here that macrophage precursors show more limited differentiation potential, raising the attractive possibility that mature cells cells of the mononuclear phagocyte
system are more capable of differentiation plasticity than
their precursors.

Methods
FL-cell production and proliferation
Total bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice (IFFA-CREDO, France) were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/mL in Iscove's
Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM; Life Technologies)

supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS; Dutscher)
and 5 ng/mL human FL (R&D Systems). Indeed, preliminary experiments indicated that human FL was as efficient
as murine FL in stimulating bone marrow cell proliferation (data not shown). Cultures were performed at 37°C,
5% CO2. After different durations of culture, as specified
in the text, non-adherent cells were recovered following
gentle flushing of the culture flasks, and therefore designated as FL-cells. For FL-dose response studies, cells were
cultivated under the same conditions in 0.1 mL of culture
medium per each culture well in 96-well plates. Proliferation was assessed after 6 days of culture using the MTT assay, which was performed as previously described [38].
For cell division studies, non-adherent cells were harvested from FL-stimulated cultures at day 6 or day 8, stained
with carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) as previously described [39], and cultured for durations as indicated. In order to ensure optimal growth,
culture medium and flask were re-used for culturing CFSE
labelled cells.
Macrophage differentiation in vitro
FL-cells were cultured for 4 days in the presence of 500 U/
ml M-CSF. The source of M-CSF was supernatant from Sf9
insect cells expressing murine M-CSF from a baculovirus
vector. One unit was defined as being able to stimulate
one colony from 50,000 mouse bone marrow cells in
standard agar cultures [40].
Osteoclast differentiation and characterization
Cells were seeded at 1.8 × 105 cells/well of 24-well plates
in α-MEM medium (Life technologies) supplemented
with 10% FCS (Hyclone), 1% glutamine, in the presence
of M-CSF (500 U/mL) and human RANKL (3% of supernatant from RANKL cDNA-expressing yeast, corresponding to about 30 ng/ml of recombinant RANKL). TRAP
activity in osteoclast cultures was identified by using the
Leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma). For assessing resorption activity, cells were maintained on dentin slices
for 14 days in a 10% CO2 incubator. Following cell removal, dentin slices were stained with toluidin blue to reveal resorption pits under microscope [41].
Dendritic cell differentiation and functional characterization
FL cells were seeded at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-glutamine, 40 µg/ml gentamycine, 10% FCS (Gibco-BRL), 5 × 10-5 M β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 5 ng/ml murine GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml
murine TNF-α with or without 10 ng/ml human TGF-β
(Peprotech). Additional 50% Percoll gradient permitted
to enhance DC purity from 60–80% to >90%.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/3/15

For assessing syngeneic or allogenic stimulation, cells
were cultured in various numbers in presence of a constant number (105/well) of T cells purified from either
C57BL/6 or DBA/2 mice. DNA synthesis was assessed after
an 8-h pulse with 1 µCi [3H]TdR.
Microglia cell differentiation
Cells were washed once in PBS then cultured for 6 days at
5 × 105 cells/ml in 50% GCCM and 50% DMEM containing 10% FCS. To obtain GCCM, C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 2, meninges were removed and
mechanically dissociated cortices were cultivated for 10
days on polyornithine-coated dishes in DMEM supplemented with FCS 10% (Gibco Life Technologies). Culture
supernatant was referred to as GCCM. Following culture
in the presence of GCCM, adherent cells were either
trypsinized and collected for FACS analysis, acetone-fixed
for fluorescence studies or fixed with glutaraldehyde before electron microscopy analysis. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed directly in the culture flasks for 60 min.
with glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixed
in 0.1% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated in graded ethanol solution. Gelatin capsules filled with araldite solution were put upside down over selected culture areas and
polymerized at 60°C during 24 h before they were split
from the culture flask. Ultrathin sections were contrasted
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. To visualize actin filaments, acetone-fixed cells were incubated with phalloidin-fluorescein (Sigma) for 50 min. at room temperature
before washing in PBS.
FACS analysis
For immunofluorescence staining, 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 15 min. on ice with anti-CD16/32 monoclonal
antibody (clone 24G2; Fc-Block reagent, Pharmingen),
then FITC or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies were
added for 40 min. incubation on ice. Cells were washed
once in PBS before performing fluorescence analysis on a
FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Signal acquisition and result analysis were performed using Cell Quest software
(Becton-Dickinson). Monoclonal antibodies used here
were as follows: anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD8α (5H10),
B220 (RA3-6B2), F4/80 (clone CI:A3-1), and CD34
(clone MEC14.7) were from Caltag; anti-CD11b (clone
M1/70), CD11c (clone HL3), CD40 (clone 3/23), CD80
(clone 16-10A1), CD86 (clone GL1), CD135 (clone
A2F10.1), and MHC II (Iab; clone 25-9-17), were from
Pharmingen; anti-CD25 (clone PC615.3) was from Coulter-Beckman. For staining with anti-CD115 (clone 2E-11,
ref. [42]), cells were first incubated with goat IgG (Sigma)
for 15 min. on ice, then 2E-11 antibody was added for a
40-min. incubation on ice. After washing in PBS, cells
were resuspended in fluorescein conjugated F(ab')2 fragments of goat anti-rat immunoglobulins (Caltag) for a 40
min. incubation anice.
