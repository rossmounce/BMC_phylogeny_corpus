Abstract
Background: Salmonella (S.) enterica is the main cause of salmonellosis in humans and animals. The epidemiology
of this infection involves large geographical distances, and strains related to an episode of salmonellosis therefore
need to be reliably discriminated. Due to the limitations of serotyping, molecular genotyping methods have been
developed, including multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA). In our study, 11
variable number tandem-repeats markers were selected from the S. enterica Typhimurium LT2 genome to evaluate
the genetic diversity of 206 S. enterica strains collected in Cambodia between 2001 and 2007.
Findings: Thirty one serovars were identified from three sources: humans, animals and food. The markers were
able to discriminate all strains from 2 to 17 alleles. Using the genotype phylogeny repartition, MLVA distinguished
107 genotypes clustered into two main groups: S. enterica Typhi and other serovars. Four serovars (Derby,
Schwarzengrund, Stanley, and Weltevreden) were dispersed in 2 to 5 phylogenic branches. Allelic variations within
S. enterica serovars was represented using the minimum spanning tree. For several genotypes, we identified clonal
complexes within the serovars. This finding supports the notion of endemo-epidemic diffusion within animals,
food, or humans. Furthermore, a clonal transmission from one source to another was reported. Four markers
(STTR3, STTR5, STTR8, and Sal20) presented a high diversity index (DI > 0.80).
Conclusions: In summary, MLVA can be used in the typing and genetic profiling of a large diversity of S. enterica
serovars, as well as determining the epidemiological relationships of the strains with the geography of the area.

Findings
Complete genome sequences are now available for many
bacteria, including some S. enterica strains. These can
be used to determine DNA repeat-motif sequences
through multiple-loci variable-number of tandem
repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), which has a high
capacity for discrimination [1-5]. A database of tandem
repeats for several completed Salmonella genome
sequences is available http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr[6].
Using S. enterica Typhi, S. enterica Typhimurium, S.
enterica Enteritidis, and S. enterica Newport as reference
strains, a large panel of VNTRs markers using MLVA
technique tested different serovars of S. enterica using

human and environmental samples from different geographic origins [1,3,4,7-9]. To date, 58 VNTRs markers
have been described, but only a few of these are still
being used [2]. These have been developed from the
genotyping and phylogenetic analyses of the S. enterica
serovars Typhimurium [3,4], Typhi [8,10], and Enteritidis [11,12] and Newport [9].
In the study, we investigated the genetic distribution
of 31 Salmonella enterica serovars from different
sources (human, animal, and food) using MLVA. This
was done by selecting a set of 11 VNTR loci [1,2,8] that
were tested to determine the genetic diversity of strains
isolated in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The choice of the
VNTR loci and the multiplicity of the serovars may contribute to the evaluation of the genetic framework of the
Salmonella genus. Furthermore, sequence analysis of

VNTR loci was employed to investigate different patterns of tandem repeats.
The set of 11 VNTR loci was used to discriminate 31
serovars represented by 206 isolates. The LT2 reference
DNA, tested as an internal control, gave identical
expected VNTR fragments with the repeat motifs, thus
demonstrating the reproducibility of the system.
With the Sal06 marker, PCR amplification was negative for 3 out of 5 Albany isolates, 3 out of 7 Braenderup isolates, 4 out of 6 Choleraesuis isolates, 3 out of
9 Corvallis isolates, 6 out of 8 Hvittingfos isolates, 2 out
of 2 Kentucky isolates, and 1 out of 4 Ohio isolates.
PCR for the Sal23 and STTR8 markers were negative
for the Choleraesuis serovar and PCR for the STTR8
marker was negative for the Mbandaka serovar. All
Typhi isolates were differentiated from the other serovars by the Sal06 and TR1 markers. The Sal23 marker
distinguished the Albany, Braenderup, Corvallis, and
Typhi serovars from the others.
Composition of the amplicons

To validate the organization of amplified fragments having an unexpected TR length, DNA sequence analysis
was performed for the following markers: Sal06, Sal15,
Sal20, STTR3, STTR5, STTR7, and STTR8. Fifty fragments were amplified from samples corresponding to 16
serovars and the sequences obtained were compared to
the fragments of LT2 reference strain. A TR sequence
greater than or equal to 0.5 repeat copies was considered as one copy and a repeat copy less than 0.5 was
considered as a zero-repeat copy. All loci without amplification or presenting amplifications without TR still
need to be noted and are considered as “0” alleles in the
analysis [5,13].
There were three possible compositions of VNTR loci:
(i) DNA fragments harboring expected repeat motifs, (ii)
DNA fragments of unexpected length with insertion or
deletion within the motif, or (iii) DNA fragments of
unexpected length with repeat motifs (Figure 1). The S.
enterica Sandiego (SA_01_06A) presented four units in
the STTR8 VNTR with an insertion of a 733 bp length
fragment in the third one (Figure 1A). In addition, one
Paratyphi B n° 202 (SA_03_01B) isolate presented with
13 TR in the STTR5 VNTR (Figure 1B), whereas the
Salmonella Paratyphi B SBP7 reference strain in http://
minisatellites.u-psud.fr presented only two matches left
at 3,145,646 and 3,022,019 genome positions but no
matches right with the STTR5 VNTR.
Diversity index

Allelic variability for all strains and sources was assessed
for 11 markers using MLVA. VNTR loci displayed a
wide range of polymorphism ranging from 2 to 17
alleles (Table 1). The global index of diversity was

Page 2 of 8

closed to one (DI = 0.988), indicating that the 11 markers had a high discriminatory effect. A high global
diversity index was found for all isolates from three
sources indicating a high discriminatory effect between
sources: food DI = 0.985, animal DI = 0.985 and human
DI = 0.894.
Four out of the 11 markers (Sal20, STTR3, STTR5,
and STTR8)that were tested in this study were highly
polymorphic for the 31 Salmonella serovars and discriminatory for all strains (DI > 0.80). A large allelic-diversity range was observed for all strains using Sal20,
STTR3, STTR5, and STTR8. The STTR5 in yohM gene
had short repeat copies (6 bp) and showed the highest
allelic size variation with 17 alleles ranging from 6 to 25
repeat motifs. This marker had also a high discriminatory power for all of the isolates (DI = 0.882) regardless
of their origin; food DI = 0.915, human DI = 0.855, and
animal DI = 0.845. The STTR3, STTR8, and Sal 20 markers were poorly discriminant for human isolates (DI <
0.8). The STTR3 marker was more discriminant for the
food isolates (DI = 0.815) and the STTR8 marker was
more discriminant for the animal isolates (DI = 0.830).
The Sal20 marker was more discriminant for the whole
population studied (DI = 0.805) than for each origin
(0.627 for human isolates, 0.743 for animal isolates, and
0.761 for food isolate). Eight other markers Sal06, Sal10,
Sal15, Sal23, STTR7, TR1 (Sal11), and TR5 (Sal22) were
less discriminant, whatever the origin of isolates.
The isolates were distributed into 75 genotypes for
133 animal isolates, 24 genotypes for 28 food isolates,
and 16 genotypes for 45 human isolates. The isolate
population from food was the most diverse, with almost
one genotype per isolate, followed by the isolate population from animals with one genotype for two isolates,
and then the human isolate population with one genotype for four isolates.
Dendrogram and minimum spanning tree

The categorical coefficient and unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) were used to
generate a dendrogram.
The genetic clone S. enterica serovar Typhi which was
exclusively from humans and rather homogeneous,
diverged from the main group B clustering of 30 Salmonella enterica serovars. group B contains two clonal subgroups, B1 and B2, which are independent from the
origin of the isolates. The B1 subgroup included the
Choleraesuis and Lexington serovars. The B2 subgroup
was genetically more complex with 28 serovars clustered
into subclonal groups B2.1 which included 11 serovars
and B2.2 which included 17 serovars (Figure 2).
The Schwarzengrund serovar is dispersed in both the
B2.1 and B2.2 clusters. With the exception of the Mbandaka unique strain, two distinct unequal populations of

genotypes can be distinguished in the B2.1 subgroup.
Within this subgroup, the S. enterica Weltevreden,
Derby, and Stanley serovars present several subclones.
The B2.2 subgroup is more heterogeneous. These results
show that the antigen profile occurs in isolates belonging to several distinct clonal lineages with different evolutionary patterns.
On the basis of the composition of allelic distribution,
a phylogenic modeling of the strains using MLVA was
deduced by the construction of a minimum spanning
tree (MST) (Figure 3). The 206 isolates (31 serovars)
were distributed into 107 genotypes, although MLVA is
more discriminant than serotyping. There is a good correlation between genotypes and serotypes, and two identical genotypes always belong to the same serotype. The
degree of diversification was different depending on the

serovar. The genotypes differing by one single locus variation (SLV) were clustered. The one-marker difference
created clonal complexes which grouped one or several
serovars. For example, Corvallis, Bovismordificans,
Braenderup, Kentucky, London, Monophasic 4, 5: fgt,
Typhi, Paratyphi B, Schleissheim, Typhimurium, and
Virchow serovars, were not very diverged and constituted a serovar clonal complex with one SLV. The
human Salmonella Typhi clonal complex differed by
eight loci from the Salmonella Newport serovar (genotype no25). Clones complexes from the same serovar,
such as the Stanley serovar, can be grouped in two separated clonal complexes according to their origin (human
or food). Some serovars, in particular the Derby and
Stanley serovars are more diverse than others. The
human isolates belonged to only five of the 31 serovars

present in this study. For each of these serovars, the
human isolates belonged to the same clonal complex,
which also included animal and food isolates.
Five serovars (Give, Mbandaka, Poona, Sandiego, and
Wansworth) are single isolates. The genetic divergence
between Salmonella enterica serovars included in the
analysis was very variable and the serovars differed by
two to eight VNTR markers. Within the serovars the
MLVA type between genotypes varies by one or two
loci and rarely by more than three. However, subclones
of S. enterica Derby, Schwarzengrund, Stanley, and Weltevreden showed differences in one to seven loci. These
results are concordant with the pattern of the
dendrogram.
MLVA is a reliable method for the molecular discrimination of Salmonella enterica isolates causing salmonellosis in humans and animals. The panel of VNTR loci
used in this study was determined after reviewing the
literature and applied to a collection of isolates obtained
from different sources (animal, food or human) without
any obvious connection to an outbreak.
This paper reports the MLVA results on a collection
of 206 Salmonella enterica isolates from Phnom Penh,
Cambodia. The study focused on six serovars (Anatum,
Enteritidis, Newport, Paratyphi B, Typhi, and Typhimurium) previously analyzed by others using MLVA [1,3,8]
and 25 untested serovars (Albany, Braenderup, Bovismorbificans, Choleraesuis, Corvallis, Derby, Give, Hvittingfos, Indiana, Itami, Kentucky, Lexington, London,

Mbandaka, Ohio, Poona, Rissen, Sandiego, Scheissheim,
Schwarzengrund, Stanley, Virchow, Weltevreden, Wansworth, and Monophasic 4, 5: fgt), contributing to the
follow-up of the genetic diversity of Salmonella enterica
isolates. With the exception of the Typhi serovars [8],
none of the serovars that we studied have been previously analyzed by MLVA in Asia.
The sequencing of PCR bands for analysis of repeat
motifs helped to validate the presence and the number
of motifs in the amplified fragment and the deletions or
insertions in a motif. This was particularly the case for
fragments of unexpected length. In our study, the number of repetitions was concordant with allelic variations
for small units (< 40 bp). An insertion within a motif
for a large amplified fragment (> 900 bp) using STTR8
loci was found (Figure 1). On contrast, other studies
had shown insertions at the beginning or the end of the
repetition for all of the markers we tested [7]. Using the
STTR8 locus, the dispersion of TR for the Typhimurium
serovar discriminated two Typhimurium isolates harboring five (4.9) repeats, and eight other isolates harboring
seven (6.5) repeats. These results correspond to the
findings of previous studies in which four repetitions [3]
or six repeats motifs [7] were reported.
STTR5, STTR3, STTR8, and Sal20 VNTRs presented
with 17, 12, 10, and 11 alleles respectively. These markers showed a high degree of discrimination among all
strains with a large allelic distribution. Two markers
(Sal06, and Sal10) were less discriminatory than

between the circles represents the genetic divergence (heavy short lines connect SLVs, thin long lines connect DLVs, and dotted lines indicate
the connection between 2 allelic distribution types). The number in each circle indicates the genotype. Red dotted squares indicate human
isolates. The halos surrounding the various types denote the groupings obtained by Bionumerics analysis. In Bionumerics MLVA clonal complexes
are grouping genotypes different by one allele.

previously reported [1,3]. The TR1 marker had a lack of
discrimination compared with a previous study of S.
enterica Typhi [1]. The TR5 marker and STTR7 marker
were more discriminatory than previously described
[3,8]. Identical allelic results were observed for Sal15,
TR5, and Sal23 loci, which was consistent with other
studies [1]. The scope of the number and the diversity
of the serovars studied confirmed the allelic scale of the
11 VNTR loci and allowed identification of other alleles.
It is remarkable that the most discriminatory markers
are involved either in the pathogen-host interaction
(antigen virulence) or in the pathogen-environment (cell
division) interaction.
The dendrogram findings supported a heterogeneous
clone dispersion for a serovar distributed as different

branches in the same group (five branches for S. enterica Derby, three branches for S. enterica Stanley, and
two branches for S. enterica Weltevreden serovars). For
S. enterica Schwarzengrund, the distribution was in two
different subgroups. Population genetic analysis of allelic
variation in chromosomal structural genes has demonstrated that isolates of Salmonella of the same serovar
are genotypically heterogeneous. For some serovars,
groups of genetically distant individuals are observed,
appearing as branches (dendrogram) or clonal complexes (MST). In some cases the same serovar may
represent two or more highly divergent phylogenetic
lineages as previously reported for the S. enterica Derby
and S. enterica Newport serovars [14]. However, this
may be also due to either the number of other serovars

studied or the collection of isolates from a restricted
area, Phnom Penh in Cambodia. In other studies the
population of isolates was selected from different countries worldwide, and was therefore more dispersed [1,8].
The difference of dispersion for the S. enterica Typhi
serovar indicated that the choice of VNTR depended on
the population that was studied. In a homogeneous
population including few other serovars [1,3,8] a discriminator VNTR should be chosen, whereas in a much
diversified serovar population, a panel of discriminant
and non- discriminant VNTRs has to be selected.
The representation of the MLVA results by using
MST dispersed heterogeneous genetic variations of Salmonella isolates within the same serovar in SLVs and
DLVs as previously reported [1]. Isolates obtained from
different sources (human, animal, or food), are genetically linked and showed that Salmonella is a highly clonal organism [15]. MST constitutes a convenient tool to
study the modalities of salmonella transmission between
animals and humans. It would be interesting to test the
hypothesis of an eventual enhanced transmissibility from
animals to humans of particular genotypes belonging to
the same serovar. For the same serovar, different genotypes may be associated either in a clonal complex, such
as the S. enterica Corvallis serovars, or as a more diversified complex such as the S. enterica Typhimurium serovar. The genotypic dispersion of animal and food
Salmonella populations was larger than that for human
isolates. However, the minimal presence of Enteritidis
and Typhimurium serovar in human isolates may reflect
a bias in the population that was selected with overrepresentation of animal strains.
In conclusion, the MLVA assay using agarose electrophoresis is a simple, rapid, and powerful technique to
genotype S. enterica isolates from human, food, or animal sources. The 11 markers used in this study permitted the subtyping of 107 genotypes from 206 isolates
of 31 Salmonella enterica serovars. However, four out of
the eleven studied markers presented an effective discriminatory power and should at least be included in
further studies where the choice of other markers will
depend on the aim of the study and the serovar being
analyzed. The food population presented the largest variation in genotypes, followed by animal, and then
human isolates. MLVA is an important tool for surveillance and investigation of outbreaks of human or animal
salmonellosis infections.
