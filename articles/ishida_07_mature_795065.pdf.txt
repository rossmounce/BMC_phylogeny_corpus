Abstract
Background: Populations may be bound by contemporary gene flow, selective sweeps, and
extinction-recolonization processes. Indeed, existing molecular estimates indicate that species with
low levels of gene flow are rare. However, strong priority effects and local selective regimes may
hinder gene flow (despite dispersal) sending populations on independent evolutionary trajectories.
In this scenario (the monopolization hypothesis), population differentiation will increase with time
and genealogical evidence should yield ample private haplotypes. Cyclical parthenogens (e.g.
rotifers and cladocerans such as Daphnia) have an increased capacity for rapid local adaptation and
priority effects because sexual reproduction is followed by multiple generations of clonal selection
and massive egg bank formation. We aimed to better understand the history of population
differentiation and ongoing gene flow in Daphnia rosea s.l., by comparing population and regional
divergences in mature unglaciated areas and younger previously glaciated areas. We also examined
the timing and paths of colonization of previously-glaciated areas to assess the dispersal limitations
of D. rosea s.l. We used DNA sequence variation (84 populations and >400 individuals) at the
mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear HSP90 loci from Holarctic populations for our genetic analyses.
Results: The genetic evidence indicated pronounced historical structure. Holarctic mtDNA
phylogenies of D. rosea s.l. revealed three geographically restricted and divergent clades: European,
Siberian and Japanese/American. The Japanese/American clade showed marked population genetic
structure (FST > 0.8) that was weakly associated with geographic distance, and a high proportion of
private haplotypes. Populations from older unglaciated habitats (i.e., Japan) showed higher DNA
sequence divergences than populations from presumed younger habitats (i.e. non-Beringian North
America) with nDNA and with mtDNA. Mismatch analyses of mtDNA and nDNA were consistent
with a single rapid post-glacial expansion of D. rosea that covered most of the New World.
Conclusion: Our evidence agrees with negligible gene flow after founding, and the accumulation
of genetic divergence with habitat age. Existing direct evidence and our mismatch analyses indicate
that the pronounced population differentiation is unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation. Instead,
priority effects and local selection regimes may play a role in limiting gene flow. The results
challenge the notion that lacustrine populations of cladocerans are generally unified by
contemporary gene flow.

Background
The Biological Species Concept assumes that gene flow
limits population differentiation and acts as a cohesive
process for species [1]. Related potential cohesive forces
are selective sweeps of advantageous alleles, hybrid vigour
involving immigrant alleles, and genetic rescue from frequent bouts of extinction and recolonization [2-4]. However, Ehrlich and Raven [2] argued that gene flow itself is
rarely sufficient to bind populations of a species together
as a unit of concerted evolution even in the face of strong
dispersal. Instead of dispersal, natural selection is the primary force governing gene flow among populations.
Although Ehrlich and Raven [2] recognized that selection
may act as a cohesive force, they posited that in most cases
selection keeps populations on independent evolutionary
trajectories, and predicted that the increasing use of
refined genetic tools would eventually reveal that gene
flow is unimportant in unifying populations. Similarly, in
their monopolization hypothesis, De Meester et al. [3]
concluded that many aquatic populations possess weak
ongoing gene flow – local adaptations, priority effects,
and large egg/seed banks may restrict gene flow despite
pronounced dispersal from nearby populations. Thus, the
disruptive selection and monopolization schools view the
population as the primary unit of evolution whereas the
cohesion school views the species as the primary unit of
evolution.
Despite the predictions by Ehrlich and Raven [2], modern
gene flow studies have strongly favoured the primacy of
cohesive gene flow over disruptive local selection [4,5].
Indeed, Slatkin [6] declared that he knows of no cases
where molecular estimates of gene flow are low despite a
high level of observed dispersal (i.e., direct estimates).
Moreover, nearly all of the low molecular estimates of
gene flow in animals appear inflated by historical processes (e.g. the inclusion of potentially vicariant phylogroups) [4]. So, Ehrlich & Raven's key prediction of
marked local population genetic differentiation in the
face of dispersal appears unsupported. An additional
blow against disruption/monopolization hypotheses is
the recent theoretical and empirical evidence that the
main role of selection may be as an enhancer (not a disruptor) of gene flow via heterosis or universal selective
sweeps [4,7].
Still, it is possible that the existing molecular estimates of
gene flow, which are based largely on obligate sexual species, are unrepresentative of animals. De Meester et al. [3],
for example, ranked cyclical parthenogens as the animal
breeding system with the greatest potential for monopolization. Cyclical parthenogens (e.g. rotifers and cladocerans) have an increased capacity for rapid local adaptation
over other breeding systems because of their frequent sexual reproduction followed by multiple generations of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/52

clonal selection [5] and persistent priority effects [8].
There is now considerable evidence for the rapid evolution of population-specific adaptations in cladocerans
such as body size, defensive structures, phototactic behavior, resistance to algal toxins, and parasite resistance[7,1012]. There is also growing direct evidence that these local
adaptations arise in species with strong dispersal of propagules by avian vectors [3,9,10] and wind [11,12]. Colonization studies indicate that cyclical parthenogens such
as daphniids appear to have strong dispersal capacity [13].
Additional evidence for the strong natural dispersal capacity of cladocerans comes from paleogenetic analysis of
cladoceran embryos in aged African lake sediments [14].
A single asexual hybrid clone of North American Daphnia
pulex appears to have been introduced into a central African lake and spread naturally throughout the continent in
less than 60 years. Likewise, clones in the Daphnia pulex
group appear to have dispersed naturally across immense
distances in the Arctic [15]. Although nearly all cladocerans lack the potential heterotic advantage and asexual
propagules of the D. pulex group, the examples do speak
to the strong passive dispersal capacity of daphniids.
Thus, cladocerans appear to be biologically predisposed
to the scenario envisioned by Ehrlich and Raven where
local selection disrupts populations despite dispersal.
Does the available indirect evidence then support low
gene flow despite strong dispersal in cladocerans? There
are many population genetic studies on cladocerans and
most report moderate to strong population structure
using relative estimates [3]. However, this result constitutes weak evidence for low gene flow because it is well
known that founder effects and long-distance dispersal
events (which both inflate FST values) have been common
in cladocerans [9,19-21]. Additional evidence is necessary
to tease apart ongoing gene flow from monopolization.
Analysis of population history offers one possible solution as the monopolization hypothesis and the ongoing
gene flow hypothesis lead to different predictions about
population genetic differentiation over time. Under ongoing gene flow, population differentiation should decrease
with time since founding [8,16]. Moreover, gene flow and
recombination should reduce allelic sequence divergence
and the proportion of private alleles. But, with little or no
ongoing gene flow, haplotype frequency differences, the
proportion of private alleles, and allelic sequence divergences should increase among populations with time.
Existing population history studies of Daphnia do support
the predictions of ongoing gene flow, but the generality of
these results for the genus are uncertain. Potentially older
populations from large lakes show less genetic differentiation (i.e. lower FST's) than populations from presumed
younger habitats such as small ponds [22-28]. However,
the higher turnover rates in ponds compared to large lakes

may lead to relatively high FST's in ponds [17]. A detailed
17-year longitudinal genetic study of two Daphnia species
with rock-pool subpopulations of known age showed a
clear erosion of allozyme-based FST's with time [11]. Still,
the rock pools also appear to lack the large effective egg
banks and strong spatial variation in biotic selection pressures (e.g. fish versus no fish) that are characteristic of
cladoceran populations from larger water bodies. Finally,
a Holarctic analysis of the Daphnia tenebrosa s. l. using
mtDNA RFLP's showed significant genetic structure
among younger glaciated regions but no genetic structure
among older non-glaciated regions. D. tenebrosa is a member of the D. pulex group that normally produces strictly
asexually at higher latitudes, making it less susceptible to
the proposed mechanisms of monopolization in sexual
cladocerans [15].
Studies of sexual Daphnia that use the absolute estimates
of population divergences yielded by DNA sequences are
still uncommon (see Paland et al[18] for an asexual example). This absolute measure of population divergence will
be sensitive to sampling error, but should be less inflated
by founder effect. De Gelas and De Meester [19] provided
evidence from COI mtDNA sequences that the present
day population structure in European Daphnia magna is
largely the result of a mosaic formed by historical recolonization from four glacial refugia rather than from ongoing gene flow. They detected some divergent lineages in
refugial areas but lacked samples for a detailed population
analysis of refugial regions. In the present study we
obtained both relative and absolute estimates of population genetic divergence; used both nuclear and mtDNA
genomic sequences; sampled populations from throughout the Holarctic range of the study species (including at
a local scale to understand structure from long distance
dispersal); and studied a sexual species of Daphnia that
commonly occupies permanent, weakly-disturbed waters
with a large range of habitat ages.
The study species, Daphnia rosea s.l. is a common component of oligotrophic permanent lakes and ponds in the
boreal, alpine, and subarctic zones of the Holarctic [3034]. Although habitat-specific head shapes are common
in D. rosea, the most recent morphological treatments
have supported one Holarctic species [20,21]. Allozyme
and mtDNA phylogenetic analyses of a few specimens
from the extremes of the geographic range reported a
western European clade (Daphnia rosea) and a North
American clade (D. dentifera) [22,23], but provided no
evidence for more than one species in each of these allopatric clades. D. rosea s.l. hatch from resting eggs in the
Spring and reproduce asexually for at least eight generations [11]. In the fall, some individuals produce sexual
propagules that sink to the sediment and function as egg
banks [24], but vast numbers of resting propagules may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/52

float forming a surface scum and shoreline deposit [25].
The direct evidence for strong dispersal, potential regional
genetic structuring, cyclical parthenogenetic breeding system, rapid local adaptations [26] and frequent occupancy
of permanent habitats suggests that D. rosea s.l. is a good
candidate for testing the historical predictions of the
monopolization hypothesis.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that D. rosea s.l. conforms
to the population structure of a sexual vagile species,
where ongoing gene flow is sufficient to offset population
genetic divergence. We aimed to compare populations
from regions that are potentially of different ages by sampling in well-established glacial refugia (Japan and Beringia) and in younger glaciated areas (temperate North
America) [27]. We also assessed the timescale and routes
of recolonization of glaciated areas to understand if evolutionary significant dispersal limitation exists in D. rosea
s.l. We found evidence for marked historical structure and
little evidence for ongoing gene flow. Populations from
unglaciated regions exhibited significantly higher
sequence divergences for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
compared to populations from glaciated North America.
We found the genetic signature of a single rapid population expansion for most of the glaciated New World, suggesting that dispersal limitation is insignificant on an
evolutionary timescale. The results are consistent with the
monopolization hypothesis where priority effects and
selection trump contemporary gene flow, rendering the
population or local metapopulation as the units of evolution.

Results
We found marked regional structure of D. rosea s.l with
three divergent allopatric mtDNA clades: European; Siberian and Japanese-American and no indication of recent
long-distance dispersal among regions (Fig. 1 and 2) [see
Additional file 1]. The ND2 alignment was 937 bp with
122 unique ingroup haplotypes, no indels (insertions or
deletions), and 421 variable sites. The best-fit ML model
was TIM + I + G (transition model with invariable sites
plus gamma distribution). The ML distance between the
European and Siberian clades was 4.47%, while the ML
distances from the American-Japanese clade to the European clade and the Siberian clade were 7.61% and 8.13%
respectively. We suspected the existence of a pseudogene
in two Japanese populations (Kazefuki-o-ike and Hakubao-ike in Nagano) because of ambiguous sequences, and
cloned PCR products to further examine the possibility.
Cloning of the PCR products revealed that each individual
of the populations had two sets of haplotypes (Fig. 1); one
with a complete reading frame and one with stop codons
at 127–129 bp. Ambiguous sites and stop codons were
absent from the mtDNA of all individuals sampled outside of these two populations.

We found extremely high estimates of relative population
structure within both glaciated and non-glaciated regions
of the North American – Japanese mtDNA clade; for nonBeringian North America FST = 0.936 (Nm = 0.02) and
Snn = 0.744 (P < 0.001); for Beringia FST = 0.869 (Nm =
0.04) and Snn = 0.751 (P < 0.001) and for Japan FST =
0.804 (Nm = 0.09) and Snn = 0.834 (P < 0.001). Likewise,

mtDNA haplotype diversities were high for each region:
0.939 ± 0.017 (95% CI) for non-Beringian North America, 0.869 ± 0.017 for Beringia, and 0.963 ± 0.006 for
Japan. Private mtDNA haplotypes (which occur in only
one population) were common: 94% of the 48 North
American haplotypes and 91% of 34 Japanese haplotypes.

distance) was also extremely pronounced; FST = 1.000 in
western Alaska, USA (N = 5); FST = 0.988 in Colorado,
USA (N = 3); FST = 0.935 in Michigan, USA (N = 3); FST
= 0.916 in Ontario, Canada (N = 3); FST = 0.833 in New
York, USA (N = 3); FST = 0.645 in central Honshu, Japan
(N = 8, Jp-7 in Fig. 3C); FST = 0.917 in western Hokkaido,
Japan (N = 3, Jp-2 in Fig. 3C) and FST = 0.915 in eastern
Hokkaido, Japan (N = 2, Jp-1 in Fig. 3C). For Japan,
AMOVA revealed that 55.84% of the variation in ND2
sequences occurred among regions, 34.62% of the variation occurred among populations within a region and
9.54% of the variation occurred within populations.
Although geographic distance among populations
explained a significant amount of the variation in pairwise FST's in Japan and in non-glaciated North America,
the amount of variation explained was low (Fig. 4; 6–
20%).
Unlike the universally high relative measures, absolute
measures of population divergences populations from
presumed older habitats (i.e. Japan and Beringia) were
generally greater than the divergences among populations
from glaciated habitats (i.e. non-Beringian North America) in mtDNA and in nDNA sequences (Fig. 3). The ND2
alignment of the Japanese-American clade contained 82
unique haplotypes (937 bp), no indels, and 199 variable
sites. The best-fit ML model was TrN + G (Tamura – Nei
with gamma distribution). Average pairwise ML distances
(using the best fit model and parameters) among populations were much higher in Japan (2.84% ± 0.14% in 95%
CI) than in non-Beringian North America (1.01% ±
0.08%) and Beringian North America (0.88% ± 0.18%).
mtDNA nucleotide diversities were also greater in Japan
(0.0234 ± 0.0026) than in non-Beringia (0.0104 ±
0.0020) and in Beringia (0.0088 ± 0.0010).
The HSP90 tree consisted of a subset of specimens represented on the ND2 tree of the Japanese-American clade.
The total alignment was total 784 bp with 192 variable
sites and 95 unique alleles. Two putative introns were
detected: Intron I (69 bp) between 87 bp position and
155 bp position; and Intron II (69 bp) between 448 bp
position and 516 bp position. No indels were found in
exons. 2–5 bp and 3–7 bp indels were found in Intron I
and Intron II, respectively. The best-fit ML model was GTR
+ I + G (General time-reversible model with invariable site
plus gamma distribution). Average pairwise ML distances
(using the best-fit model and parameters) among populations (nDNA) were much higher in nonglaciated regions
(Japan 5.04% ± 0.14%; Beringia 4.15% ± 0.37%) than in
non-glaciated North America (1.07% ± 0.06%).
North American populations showed genetic signatures of
a bottleneck and postglacial expansion. Most North American haplotypes were restricted to a star-like clade of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/52

closely related haplotypes (Fig. 3A) [see Additional file 2].
The clade had significant negative values of neutrality tests
(p < 0.001 in Tajima's D and Fu's FS). Still, just two mitochondrial haplotypes were shared among populations in
the star-like North American clade. One of these shared
haplotypes formed the central haplotype in a haplotype
network [see Additional file 2] and was widely distributed
in North America: one population in Alaska (USA), one
population in Yukon (Western Canada), one population
in Wisconsin (USA), three populations in Michigan
(USA) and two populations in Indiana (USA). The other
shared haplotype was detected only within a 120 km
diameter region near the Michigan – Indiana border. Pairwise differences of all sequences (n = 199) in the clade
formed a unimodal distribution pattern, which fit the
expected distributions of spatial expansion (Fig 5A; P[simulated SSD > observed SSD] = 0.93) and pure demographic expansion (P = 0.38). The parameter Tau in the spatial
expansion model was 3.228 (1.582–4.288 in 95 % CI).
Pairwise differences of the non-Beringian sequences (n =
175) in the clade formed a unimodal pattern, which fit the
expected distributions of spatial expansion (P = 0.45) but
not of pure demographic expansion (P < 0.05). The
parameter Tau in the spatial expansion model was 3.088
(1.544–4.080 in 95 % CI).
Similar to the mtDNA, we detected a clade comprised of
the non-Beringian North American populations and two
Yukon populations with nDNA (Fig. 3B) [see Additional
file 3]. The clade had significant negative values of neutrality tests (p < 0.05 in Tajima's D and p < 0.001 in Fu's
FS). Three nuclear haplotypes were detected as shared
among populations in this North American clade. Pairwise differences of all sequences (n = 43) in the clade were
distributed in a unimodal pattern, which is similar to the
expected distributions under models of spatial and sudden expansions (Fig 5B). The parameter Tau in the spatial
expansion model was 2.427. However, the least-square
fitting algorithm in ARLEQUIN [28] did not converge,
suggesting that the nuclear data poorly fit the available
models. Thus, the P-value for the available models and the
95% CI of the expected distributions were not available.
Similarly, pairwise differences of the non-Beringian
nuclear sequences (n = 35) were distributed in a unimodal
pattern, and the least-square fitting algorithm did not converge.

Discussion
The phylogeographic and population genetic results are
consistent with the monopolization hypothesis where
gene flow is insufficient to prevent population divergence
[2,3]. Daphnia rosea s.l. may represent Slatkin's [6] missing
gene flow category with strong estimated population
structure despite strong dispersal abilities. Morjan &
Rieseberg's [4] review provides an indication of how

small percentage of studies (24 animal species) had a population subdivision estimate of > 0.8. However, in each of
these cases, the estimate was calculated across divergent
geographic clades, suggesting that historical relationships
inflated the estimate. Our finding of FST > 0.8 subdivision
among populations within a regional clade and genetically divergent haplotypes among Japanese populations
reveals that the vagile D. rosea s.l. also possesses among
the highest estimates of population subdivision yet
recorded for animals.
Unlike previous studies, and contrary to the predictions of
ongoing gene flow, we found by two crude measures of

habitat maturity that older populations possessed as
much or more genetic structure than presumed younger
populations. Our results indicate that populations of
Daphnia from large lakes and large ponds can possess
strong structure – stronger than has been reported from
small pond species [17,29]. Part of the difference between
our estimates and prior studies arises from the increased
mutation rates of our markers. But this cannot be the only
explanation as some studies of pond cladocerans [29,30]
have used rapidly evolving markers (i.e. control region of
mtDNA and microsatellites). Nor is the pattern restricted
to the present study species as Ishida & Taylor [31] have
recently found similarly strong population structure using
the same markers in a large study of the lacustrine specialist, Daphnia galeata. The absolute measures of genetic
divergence from presumed older habitats or metapopula-

Figure 5 patterns in mismatch distributions for temperate North American populations of Daphnia rosea
Expansion
Expansion patterns in mismatch distributions for temperate North American populations of Daphnia rosea.
The distribution of pairwise haplotype differences (number of differences) within the major mitochondrial clade (A) and the
major nuclear clade (B) of North American populations. Black line indicates the observed distribution. Red line indicates the
expected distribution based on the spatial expansion model. Light blue zone indicates the 95% CI range of expected distribution based on the spatial expansion model. The nuclear distribution lacks the 95% CI range, because the least-square fitting
algorithm in ARLEQUIN failed to converge.

tions in unglaciated areas (Japan and Alaska) were generally much greater than those population genetic
divergences among younger habitats (glaciated areas).
The contrast between glaciated and unglaciated areas was
apparent in both the mitochondrial and the nuclear
genomes. Only the Beringian – North American contrast
for ND2 distances revealed similar levels of structure.
Analysis of more populations from central Beringia is necessary to determine if the contrast is real. Both the
increased divergence with age of habitat and the very high
proportion of private haplotypes found in most populations are inconsistent with ongoing gene flow acting to
homogenize populations. However, they do satisfy a
major prediction of the monopolization hypothesis:
increased differentiation and divergence with population
age.
The roles of local selection, ongoing gene flow with drift,
and dispersal limitation are difficult to tease apart as contributors to the observed population structuring of D.
rosea. Ongoing gene flow with drift probably occurs, but it
seems unlikely given the lack of allele sharing and relatively high sequence divergences among geographically
close regions in Japan with both nDNA and mtDNA (see
also De Gelas and De Meester [19]). Colonization studies

[11,13], the massive production of resting propagules,
and the evidence for rapid postglacial colonization of vast
areas of the northern hemisphere indicate that dispersal
limitation may also be weak. The population genetic signature of D. rosea s.l. in North America is consistent with
postglacial expansion from a Beringian refugium. A severe
genetic bottleneck in glaciated North America was clear
from both the nuclear and the mitochondrial results.
Diverse nuclear lineages in the Northern Pacific Coast
(especially Alaska) and reduced genetic diversity in glaciated regions indicates population expansion from Beringia. The mitochondrial North American clade
consistently showed the spatial expansion patterns in mismatch distributions with or without Alaska and Yukon
populations. The spatial expansion model assumes that
subdivided populations expand the distribution range
and increase the total number of the individuals, while a
pure demographic expansion model assumes that populations are not subdivided. The observed high value of FST
and the high frequency of private haplotypes among the
Am1 populations [see Additional file 1] indicate subdivided populations. The star-like haplotype network [see
Additional file 1] and the significant negative values of
neutrality tests were also consistent with the expansion
patterns of this clade. Using Tau = 2ut and assuming a

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:52

divergence rate of 2.0% per million years for arthropod
mitochondrial protein-coding genes [32], the expansion
time is estimated to be 86 000 years ago (42 000–113 000
years ago in 95% CI) for populations including Alaska
and Yukon, and 82 000 years ago (41 000–109 000 years
ago in 95% CI) for populations excluding Alaska and
Yukon. However, the relationship between the age and
the evolutionary rate can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, where the short-term (< 1–
2 Myr) mutation rate gets exponentially higher, while the
long-term (> 10 Myr) substitution rate is constant. The
estimated expansion times could be overestimated more
than 10 times because of the recent events (< 0.1 Myr B.P.)
[33]. Thus, the spatial expansion of D. rosea s.l. in North
America might have occurred rapidly after the last Ice Age
(< 15 000 y B.P.). As both Japan and Alaska contain ample
migratory waterfowl vectors, and our results provide evidence that much of the North American continent was
rapidly colonized after glaciation, there are no reasons to
believe that dispersal differences or limitations account
for the differing divergence patterns between Japan and
North America. Also, the refugial areas represent relatively
small geographic areas (e.g. Japan) compared to the vast
glaciated regions (e.g., much of North America), so the
divergence patterns are not attributable solely to isolation
by distance.
Of course, indirect estimates of gene flow apply only to
the loci under study. Selective sweeps of globally favourable alleles may occur at unsampled loci [4]. We note that
the inclusion of mtDNA in our study makes our conclusion of strong population differentiation conservative –
mtDNA is perhaps one of the most susceptible loci to
homogenizing selective sweeps in animals [34]. We also
note that during the multiple generations of clonal reproduction in D. rosea, mtDNA and nuclear genomes are
linked, increasing the potential for background selection
against immigrant genes [3,29]. Our finding of generally
concordant divergence patterns for nuclear and mitochondrial loci and the frequent observation of stable,
lake-specific body shapes in D. rosea s.l. [20] suggests that
the strong population differentiation is not merely a
locus-specific phenomenon.
If populations of Daphnia rosea are indeed exposed to negligible gene flow despite dispersal, then what are the evolutionary consequences? Speciation by habitat isolation
or vicariance may occur if populations are separated in
distant glacial refugia. Most populations of D. rosea have
likely gone extinct from the regular waves of catastrophic
Pleistocene glaciation or experienced turnover as local
selection regimes changed. Indeed, the shape of the
mtDNA tree for D. rosea is consistent with the recolonization of the Holarctic from at least three geographically –
distant bottlenecked glacial refugia. Our evidence that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/52

local regions continue to diverge over time (perhaps over
hundreds to thousands of years) in vagile D. rosea, suggests that the evolutionary legacy of monopolization is
perhaps the stabilization of countless innovations and
adaptations in local metapopulations. Some of these local
adaptations such as parasite resistance [26] and defensive
structures on the head [20] have already been identified
for D. rosea.
Although we present a case of marked population differentiation and sequence divergence in cladocerans, it is difficult to estimate how taxonomically widespread
monopolization is. However, if a mixed breeding system
and differing local selection regimes are important drivers
of monopolization, then the patterns we found in D. rosea
s.l. are perhaps more widespread among eukaryotes. More
work is necessary to understand the causes of monopolization. Future genetic analysis of preserved egg/embryo
banks of cladocerans in lake sediments and permafrost
may offer detailed window into the process.

Conclusion
Our findings are consistent with negligible gene flow after
founding, and the accumulation of genetic divergence
with regional age. Daphnia rosea s.l. showed increased levels of population divergence in mature unglaciated
regions compared to presumed younger glaciated regions.
Previous direct evidence of vagility in D. rosea s. l. and our
evidence for a rapid population expansion at the continental scale, suggests that most population differentiation
is unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation. Instead, priority effects and selection may play roles in limiting gene
flow. The results challenge the notion that sexual populations of lacustrine cladocerans are generally unified by
contemporary gene flow.

Methods
Sample collection
Specimens of D. rosea s.l. were collected from 84 Holarctic
locations [see Additional file 4]. As previous studies
showed that D. cucullata and D. longispina were closely
related species to D. rosea s.l. in the mitochondrial ND2
phylogeny [35], we used these species as outgroups [see
Additional file 4]. All samples were preserved in absolute
ethanol at room temperature, or frozen at -80°C. These
specimens were morphologically identified according to
Ueno [36], Brooks [20], Glagolev [37], Taylor et al. [22]
and Flössner [21].
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted by using QuickExtract
(Epicentre). Samples were homogenized in 30–50 μL of
the QuickExtract solution, incubated at 65°C for 2 h and
98°C for 10 min, and stored at -20°C. A c. 1000 bp fragment of the mitochondrial protein-coding NADH-2

(ND2) gene was amplified using the primers MetF3 (5'GTT CAT GCC CCA TTT ATA GGT TA-3') and TrpR (5'GAA GGT TTT TAG TTT AGT TAA CTT AAA ATT CT-3')
[35]. A c. 760 bp fragment of the nuclear protein-coding
HSP90 gene was amplified using the primers (5'-TTA CGA
GTC CAG ATG GGC TT-3') and (5'-ATC CGT TAT GAA
TCC CTG ACT GA-3') [38]. Each 50 μL PCR reaction consisted of 5 μL of extracted DNA, 10× PCR buffer [50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mg MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.01% (w/v)
gelatin], 2 mM of each dNTP, 1 μM of each primer and 1
unit of Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR temperature profile
for the mitochondrial ND2 gene was as follows: 40 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, and
final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR temperature
profile for the nuclear HSP90 gene was as follows: 40
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min,
and final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Because ND2 PCR
products from two Japanese populations had multiple
peaks in their sequences, cloning was performed for the
products using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen).
Then, three cultured colonies were used for sequencing.
For HSP90, all PCR products were cloned using the TOPO
TA Cloning Kit, and then four or five cultured colonies
were sequenced. Sequences of ND2 and HSP90 were
obtained in both directions by Genaissance pharmaceuticals (Connecticut, USA) or Roswell Park Cancer Institute
(New York, USA). Sequences were assembled, edited with
Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Code Corporation), and aligned
manually with Se-Al 2.0 [39].
Genetic analyses
For the mitochondrial phylogeny of Holarctic D. rosea s.l.,
we used a total of 403 individuals of D. rosea s.l from 84
Holarctic locations: 212 individuals from 30 non-Beringia
North American populations (in North America except
Alaska and Yukon), 43 individuals from nine Beringia
North American populations (in Alaska, USA and Yukon,
Canada), 97 individuals from 19 Japanese populations,
25 individuals from six Siberian populations, and 26 individuals from 20 European populations [see Additional
file 4]. The best-fit maximum likelihood (ML) model was
selected by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests in the program Modeltest 3.7 [40]. The ML distance was based on
the best fit model and calculated using PAUP v4.0b10
[41]. An Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed with
the ML distance and 1000 bootstrap replicates using
PAUP.

Population level information was available for the
mtDNA of specimens from North America and Japan. We
calculated FST with the estimator of Hudson et al. [42] and
the nearest-neighbor statistic (Snn) of Hudson [43] as
implemented in DnaSP 4.10 [44]. With Hudson et al.'s
estimator of FST, each polymorphic site in an alignment is
treated as a locus and FST = 1-Hw/Hb. Hw is the mean

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/52

number of sequence differences among different haplotypes sampled from the same subpopulation and Hb is the
mean number of sequence differences among samples
from different subpopulations [42]. This estimator is
equivalent to the NST estimator of Lynch & Crease [45]
without a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple substitutions. Snn is a measure of how often the most closely
related sequences (nearest-neighbors) occur in the same
locality (water bodies in the present case). The number of
private haplotypes (which occur in only one population)
was counted. Haplotype diversities and nucleotide diversities were calculated using DnaSP [44].
We further analyzed phylogeography of the North American and Japanese populations using mitochondrial and
nuclear data. For mitochondrial analysis, we used the
same data of ND2 sequences that was used in construction of the Holarctic D. rosea s.l. phylogeny. For nuclear
analysis, we used 36 individuals of the D. rosea s.l: 13 individuals from 13 non-Beringia North American populations, six individuals from six Beringia North America,
and 17 individuals from 17 Japanese populations. Intron
boundaries of the HSP90 sequences were identified by
comparing arthropod HSP90 mRNA sequences (e.g.
AY528900, AY423488) and by examining the intronsplicing signature sequences. Two introns were identified
and aligned using clustalW. For mitochondrial and
nuclear data of North American and Japanese D. rosea s.l.,
the best-fit ML model was selected by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests using Modeltest. ML distance was calculated using PAUP. NJ phylogeny was constructed with ML
distance and 1000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP. The
Mantel test [46] was used to determine the relationship
between genetic distance (pairwise FST from Arlequin 3.01
[28], and pairwise ML divergence) and geographic distance to test an isolation-by-distance model. The geographic distance was calculated using the great-circle
distance formula. The Mantel test was implemented in
IBD 1.52 [47] using 1000 permutations. The computer
program TCS 1.21 [48] was used to estimate the mitochondrial haplotype network that illustrates all connections that have 95% probability of being the most
parsimonious. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
was carried out for Japanese regional groups (Jp1-8 in Fig.
3C) using the TrN + G (Tamura-Nei distance with gamma
distribution) by Arlequin with 1000 permutations.
To address the population expansion of major North
American clades in mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies, we performed the neutrality tests of Fu's FS [49] and
Tajima's D [50] and revealed the frequency distribution of
the number of pairwise sequence differences (i.e. the mismatch distribution). The values of Fu's FS and Tajima's D
are expected to have significantly negative values for population expansion (other explanations are background

selection and hitch-hiking associated with selective
sweeps). The significance of Fu's FS and Tajima's D were
tested by random permutation using 1000 replicates in
ARLEQUIN 3.01 [28]. The mismatch distributions were
calculated using ARLEQUIN. The observed distributions
were compared with the simulated distributions under
the models of pure demographic expansion and spatial
expansion. The model of pure demographic expansion
assumes that non-subdivided populations suddenly
expand in population size and increase the total number
of individuals [51]. The model of spatial expansion
assumes that subdivided populations expand the distribution range and increase the total number of individuals
[52,53]. Both models estimate Tau = 2ut where u = mTμ. t
is the estimated time of expansion, mT is the number of
nucleotide sequences under study, and μ is the mutation
rate per time. A least square procedure and bootstrap
approach (1000 replications) provided the probability
that the sum of squared deviations is lower in the
observed distribution than in the simulated distributions,
and calculated the 95% confidence intervals of the
expected distribution and Tau.
