Abstract
Background: Widely used substitution models for proteins, such as the Jones-Taylor-Thornton
(JTT) or Whelan and Goldman (WAG) models, are based on empirical amino acid interchange
matrices estimated from databases of protein alignments that incorporate the average amino acid
frequencies of the data set under examination (e.g JTT + F). Variation in the evolutionary process
between sites is typically modelled by a rates-across-sites distribution such as the gamma (Γ)
distribution. However, sites in proteins also vary in the kinds of amino acid interchanges that are
favoured, a feature that is ignored by standard empirical substitution matrices. Here we examine
the degree to which the pattern of evolution at sites differs from that expected based on empirical
amino acid substitution models and evaluate the impact of these deviations on phylogenetic
estimation.
Results: We analyzed 21 large protein alignments with two statistical tests designed to detect
deviation of site-specific amino acid distributions from data simulated under the standard empirical
substitution model: JTT+ F + Γ. We found that the number of states at a given site is, on average,
smaller and the frequencies of these states are less uniform than expected based on a JTT + F + Γ
substitution model. With a four-taxon example, we show that phylogenetic estimation under the
JTT + F + Γ model is seriously biased by a long-branch attraction artefact if the data are simulated
under a model utilizing the observed site-specific amino acid frequencies from an alignment.
Principal components analyses indicate the existence of at least four major site-specific frequency
classes in these 21 protein alignments. Using a mixture model with these four separate classes of
site-specific state frequencies plus a fifth class of global frequencies (the JTT + cF + Γ model),
significant improvements in model fit for real data sets can be achieved. This simple mixture model
also reduces the long-branch attraction problem, as shown by simulations and analyses of a real
phylogenomic data set.
Conclusion: Protein families display site-specific evolutionary dynamics that are ignored by
standard protein phylogenetic models. Accurate estimation of protein phylogenies requires models
that accommodate the heterogeneity in the evolutionary process across sites. To this end, we have
implemented a class frequency mixture model (cF) in a freely available program called QmmRAxML
for phylogenetic estimation.

Background
Since the 1970s, the evolution of protein sequences has
been modelled using empirical amino acid substitution
matrices derived from analyses of databases of protein
alignments. Since the first introduction of these 'accepted
point mutation' (PAM) models by Dayhoff and coworkers
[1], a variety of newer substitution matrices have been
derived based on much larger databases of alignments
(e.g. the JTT matrix [2], the BLOSUM family [3], the probability matrix from blocks (PMB) [4], WAG [5]) or databases of proteins encoded by specific genome types (e.g.
mitochondria [6] and chloroplasts [7]) and using more
rigorous statistical methods (see [8,9] for a recent discussion).
However, it has long been recognized that different
sequence positions evolve at different rates. Indeed, a significant improvement in the fit of these models to real
data has been to model heterogeneity in rates at different
sites using a discrete approximation to the gamma distribution [10]. Yet it is well known that sites in proteins not
only differ in their relative rates of evolution, but, because
of structural and functional constraints, they also differ in
their preferences for specific amino acids. Some sites in a
protein alignment are occupied by almost any residue,
while others appear to be restricted to a limited subset of
amino acids and, quite frequently, only one particular residue. Attempts at improving substitution matrices for
database searching, take these forms of substitution heterogeneity into account with the development of positionspecific scoring matrices [3], profile-based methods [11],
hidden Markov models [12] and structure-specific substitution matrices [13]. However, accounting for site- or
structure-specific dynamics in amino acid replacements in
protein phylogenetic models has only recently garnered
significant attention.
Bruno [14,15] proposed a model where site-specific
amino acid frequencies were estimated by maximum likelihood (ML). However, this model is problematic because
the number of parameters increases without bound (19
per site) [16] and a large number of taxa are required for
model fitting. Goldman and coworkers [17,18] introduced a set of eight to ten predefined categories of substitution patterns at sites in a hidden Markov model
framework, based on protein secondary structures and
surface exposure, and each category has its own rate
matrix for ML inference. Other models explore the interdependence of sites due to constraints introduced by tertiary structure in protein sequence evolution [19-21].
Lartillot and Philippe [22] proposed a Bayesian mixture
model that allows amino acid replacement pattern at different sites to be described by distinct substitution processes which have the same substitution rates but different
stationary probabilities. They implemented their CAT

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/331

model in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework with a
Dirichlet process prior. More recently Le et al. [23] proposed a new amino acid profile mixture model in which
substitutions at sites follow a 'proportional' model
whereby site-specific substitutions are entirely characterized by a mixture of 10 to 60 equilibrium frequency
classes at sites.
Lartillot, Le and colleagues [22-24] argue that taking into
account the site-specific nature of protein evolution may
be of vital importance to phylogenetic estimation especially in the case where two or more branches are
extremely long, leading to an apparent long branch attraction (LBA) type artefact in empirical data sets. They, and a
recent study by Rokas and Carroll [25], have shown that
'homoplasy' (i.e. multiple independent origins of the
same character state at a homologous site in different
taxa) occurs much more frequently in true protein alignments than expected under standard substitution models
such as JTT or WAG, even when the rates-across-sites process is taken into account. As a result, they suggest that even
probabilistic methods (i.e. maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods) employing these standard models can display an LBA bias, even when a large number of sites are
considered. Lartillot's CAT model and the methods proposed by Le et al. are designed to counter these problems,
although at the cost of a large number of additional
parameters to be estimated and some model simplifications.
Here we revisit the issue of site-specific amino acid constraints in protein phylogenetics. First, to further probe
the differences between the 'true' substitution process and
standard models, we assembled 21 large protein sequence
alignments and used two different methods to test if and
how empirical frequencies at sites differ from those simulated under the standard JTT + F + Γ substitution model.
We showed that significant deviations can be detected for
the majority of these protein families. Second, using the
site-specific amino acid frequencies estimated from one of
the data sets, we simulated a four-taxon case over a large
grid of different branch-length settings to evaluate the
accuracy of the ML methods employing a standard empirical matrix to recover the correct tree under these conditions. We found a large 'Felsenstein zone' where the LBA
artefact occurs. Third, we conducted a principal components analysis of the amino acid frequency matrix at all
sites of the 21 protein alignment data sets and obtained
four major classes (or profiles) of amino acid frequency
distribution at sites. We propose a random effects mixture
model using these class frequencies to model site-specific
amino acid frequency distributions and implemented it in
a version of RAxML [26] that we call Q-matrix mixture
RAxML (QmmRAxML) for phylogenetic inference. This
model differs from previous models [22,23] by account-

ing for intrinsic exchangeabilities between amino acids
and containing standard amino acid substitution models
as a special case, thereby permitting likelihood ratio testing of improvements in model fit. We show that the
amino acid frequency mixture model fits the data significantly better than the conventional non-mixture model in
all cases examined and further find it can reduce the LBA
artefact both in simulations and in a phylogenomic analysis of a eukaryotic data set. In comparison to other
approaches, our model introduces significantly fewer
additional parameters and avoids model over-simplification.

Results and discussion
Statistical analyses of site-specific amino acid uniformity
and state frequencies
An entropy-based measure was used to quantify the deviation of site-specific amino acid frequencies from uniform
usage of amino acids. A Z-test was used to determine
whether the real data are more or less uniform compared
to a very large data set simulated under JTT + F + Γ for the
same tree. A total of 21 protein data sets (numbers of taxa
and sites shown in Table 1) and associated simulated data
(100,000 amino acid sites for every simulated data set)
were used and the sites of the real and simulated data were
divided into four estimated rate categories and Z-tests

were carried out on each rate category. The P-values for the
tests are shown in Table 1. These indicate that for the sites
in the slowest rate category (rate 1) less than half of the
datasets have significant differences in amino acid uniformity between the real data and the simulated data; but
for sites in the faster rate categories (rates 2–4), the real
data are less uniform than the simulated data in the
majority of the cases.
Table 1 also shows the results of the state frequency tests.
For these analyses a χ2 test was used to compare the numbers of sites with a given number of observed states in real
data (observed counts) versus those in simulated data
(expected counts). Only three data sets showed no significant differences in the amino acid state frequency counts
between the real and simulated data. For the remaining 18
data sets, the real data and the simulated data have very (P
< 0.001) or moderately (P < 0.05) significant differences
in the number of distinct amino acids at the sites. Moreover, in all these cases, the simulated data have greater
numbers of distinct amino acid states at sites. Figure 1
shows the distribution of the number of sites with a given
number of states for the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)
data set compared with the data simulated using the
HSP90 tree under the JTT + F + Γ model with parameters
fit to the data set. Relative to the simulated data, the real

Numbers of sites with a given number of states in simulated
Numbers of sites with a given number of states in
simulated versus real HSP90 data. The original HSP90
data have 54 taxa and 459 sites. The simulated data have the
same number of taxa and 100,000 sites. In the latter case the
proportions of sites with each number of states were calculated and then multiplied by 459 to make the numbers
directly comparable to the HSP90 data set.

HSP90 data set has more sites with fewer states and no
sites that have more than 13 states. By contrast, the simulated data set has sites with as many as 18 observed states.
Collectively, these tests indicate that real data sets tend to
have less uniform amino acid frequencies and fewer states
at sites than expected under standard phylogenetic substitution models such as JTT + F + Γ.
Four-taxon tree simulations under a site-specific frequency
model and average frequency of the whole data set
In order to evaluate the potential impact of restricted sitespecific amino acid frequencies on ML-based phylogenetic inference we did simulations of four-taxon trees
under an extreme 'site-specific frequency' (ssF) model. For
this model, the amino acid frequencies at each site were
calculated from the HSP90 data set. These frequencies
were then used in a JTT + ssF + Γ model to simulate data
sets over the four-taxon trees over a wide range of branchlength settings. Note that for this model, each site is simulated with stationary frequencies corresponding to the
frequencies observed in a given HSP90 alignment column. For each branch-length setting, trees were then estimated by ML under JTT + F + Γ with Tree-Puzzle [27] (Fig.
2B). For comparison, we also simulated data sets for the
same branch-length settings using the average amino acid
frequencies observed in the whole HSP90 data set using
the standard JTT + F + Γ model. Trees for these latter simulated data sets were also estimated by ML under the JTT
+ F + Γ model to evaluate a case where there is no model
misspecification (Fig. 2A). The results show that for the

Principal Components Analysis of site frequency data
The above simulation results show definitively that, if
ignored, site-specific amino acid frequencies will cause
significant LBA problems for phylogenetic inference.
Although Bruno (1996) [14] attempted to account for this
phenomenon by modelling amino acid frequencies at
each site of the alignment, this approach leads to a serious
statistical problem [16] whereby the number of model
parameters increases linearly with the amount of data. If,
however, certain patterns of amino acid usage are recurrent, one may derive some common frequency vectors, or
profiles, from a large number of sequence sites. To determine whether there were such recurrent patterns in the
data, we calculated the 20 amino acid frequencies from
each of the 6555 sites of the 21 protein data sets to form a
matrix of 6555 sites × 20 frequencies. We then carried out
a principal components analysis (PCA) and plotted the
first two components (Fig. 3). These two components
account for 21.6% of the variance of the data. We used a
clustering method to cut the distribution of the sites into
four classes along the lines of linear regressions (see Methods for details). The first class has high frequencies of
valine, isoleucine and leucine, followed by methionine.
The second class has high frequencies of glycine, followed
by alanine and serine. The third class is rich in aspartic
acid and glutamic acid. The fourth class, a 'left-over' class
that contains those sites that are not obvious members of
the first three classes, has much more uniform frequencies
of the various amino acids. The predominant amino acids
in the first three classes are consistent with the observation that the amino acids in those classes are biochemically and structurally similar and expected to be more
interchangeable over evolutionary time. Figure 4 shows
the average amino acid frequencies of the four PCAderived classes as well as the overall average amino acid
frequencies of the 21 data sets.
Testing a class frequency mixture model
Using the four amino acid frequency profiles from the
PCA analysis and adding a fifth one corresponding to the
average frequency of the whole data set to account for site
frequencies not captured by the PCA classes and also to
make the relevant model comparisons easier (see the

indicated by an open circle. The classes and the regression
lines were determined as shown in the main text.

Methods section for details), we implemented a 'class frequency' (cF) mixture model. In this model, the site likelihood is calculated as a weighted sum of the site
likelihoods conditional on each class frequency or the
whole data set frequency separately. We also account for
rates-across-sites using standard discretized gamma mixture model methods. The cF mixture model has been
implemented in QmmRAxML, based on the source code
of the phylogenetic inference package RAxML.
We used QmmRAxML to calculate likelihoods of 25 protein data sets under the single frequency model (JTT + F +
Γ) and the cF mixture model (JTT + cF + Γ), respectively.
The first 21 data sets are the same ones that were used for
deriving the class frequencies from the PCA, while the last
four data sets are additional protein alignments used to
test the generalizability of the cF model to other data sets.
For the analyses under the cF mixture model, we fixed the
tree topologies to be the same optimal trees recovered
under the JTT + F + Γ model but branch-lengths were reoptimized. QmmRAxML uses an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize weights of the class frequencies and the whole data set frequency. The estimated
weights (the wc parameters in the model described in the
Methods section) and the likelihood differences (ΛlnL)
between the two models are listed in Table 2. In all cases
there are significant likelihood increases under the cF mixture model compared to the single frequency model, indicating the cF model always fits the data better for the same
topology. Curiously, in all cases the weight of the F class
(the average frequency of the whole data set) is generally
high and the weights of the four PCA classes are generally
low, especially in classes 2 and 3. The weight for a class

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/331

estimates the probability that a site has a frequency vector
corresponding to that class. The reasons for the relatively
small class 1–3 weights are several-fold. First, it seems
likely that these frequency classes are related to structural
features. For instance, the two major amino acids of class
3, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, are negatively charged
and many sites that are conserved to have only these
amino acids could have important structural roles such as
binding metal cations, participating in intramolecular
and/or intermolecular salt-bridges, or have catalytic or
substrate-binding functions. Although the number of
such sites will vary across protein families, it is likely that
they will always constitute a relatively small minority in
any given protein family. The data bears this out in other
ways. Most sites that do not have a very pronounced preference for the amino acids emphasized in classes 1–3 or
that have appreciable frequencies for more than four
amino acids, will be fit best by either class 4 or the F class.
Since classes 1–3 emphasize sites with very few amino
acids each of which occur with frequencies of < 10% overall, it is not surprising that the estimated frequency of
these kinds of sites are all quite low. For example, aspartic
acid and glutamic acid together have an average frequency
of 12.2% in the 21 data sets. Therefore, the sites restricted
to having virtually only these two amino acids, as featured
in class 3, are expected to be very small and is reflected by
the low weights assigned to this class.
In the above simulation studies we have demonstrated
that sequence data generated under the JTT + ssF + Γ
model can cause a serious LBA problem when the trees are
estimated under the conventional JTT + F + Γ model. To
test whether the cF mixture model can ameliorate the LBA
problem we used both simulations and analysed a real
data set. Figure 5 shows the simulation results from data
generated under JTT + ssF + Γ model. The left panel shows
the results of estimation under a standard JTT + F + Γ
model and the right panel shows estimation under the JTT
+ cF + Γ model. From comparing these two results, it is
clear that the cF model ameliorates some, but not all of
the LBA problems relative to the standard model. It is
interesting to note that in the non-Felsenstein zone
region, the cF model sometimes performs slightly worse
than the standard model. This is consistent with higher
variance estimates expected from a model that includes
more parameters.
The deep phylogeny of eukaryote 'supergroups' is often
plagued with LBA [28], even when large multi-gene phylogenomic data sets are used [29]. One of the most famous
examples of this concerns the position of Microsporidia, a
group of fast-evolving intracellular parasites that are now
known to be relatives of Fungi [30]. When reconstructing
the phylogeny of eukaryotes rooted by Archaea with conventional models, the extremely long branch leading to

Average amino acid frequencies in the four site-specific classes derived from the PCA shown in Figure 3. The
bottom frequency profile shows the overall frequencies of amino acids observed at all sites in the 21 amino acid alignments.

Microsporidia is often attracted to the long branches leading to the Archaea at the base of the eukaryotes. Many
methods have been proposed to solve this problem,
including selective taxon sampling, removal of fast-evolving proteins and saturated sites [28,29], accounting for
covarion shifts [28], amino acid profile mixture modelling [23], etc. Here we applied the cF mixture model to a
large set of eukaryote phylogenomic data with 133 proteins from 40 taxa and 24294 sites [29] and calculated
likelihoods of two competing trees: the LBA topology
where Microsporidia group with Archaea and, the correct
topology where Microsporidia group with Fungi. As
shown in Table 3, while the JTT + F + Γ model supports the
Microsporidia plus Archaea clan, the cF mixture model
supports the correct Microsporidia-Fungi tree. Thus for a

real example the cF model appears to be less susceptible
to the effects of LBA than the standard model.
Comparisons to other methods
Lartillot and colleagues have shown that accounting for
site-specific amino acid frequencies with their CAT + Γ
model seems to significantly improve both model fit and
phylogenetic estimation with large concatenated protein
data sets [24]. Indeed, they were the first to observe that
accounting for site-specific frequencies is important to
avoid long-branch attraction problems when there are
large numbers of substitutions (i.e. so-called 'substitutional saturation'). However, as these authors later note,
the standard CAT + Γ model fits very large numbers of
classes that, while appropriate for large concatenated data

Protein

ΛlnL is the likelihood difference between the cF mixture model and the single frequency model (JTT + F + Γ). The p-values associated with these
differences, calculated from χ2 tests with 4 degrees of freedom, are very significant in all cases (p < 0.01). The actual p-values would be even smaller
as the tests are conservative (see the main text for a discussion).

sets, likely leads to problems with over-parameterization
and convergence of Bayesian analyses in the case of
smaller alignments (e.g., less than 1000 sites) [23].
To address this, Le and colleagues [23] developed similar
models based on a set of 10 to 60 classes of amino acid
profiles that were estimated from a database of alignments and implemented these in both Bayesian (PhyloBayes) and maximum likelihood (PhyML) estimation
programs. However, again, for computational efficiency
reasons, the authors restricted attention to proportional
models that ignore different intrinsic 'exchangeabilities'
between amino acids. This, and the fact that weights associated with the 10 to 60 classes should be estimated for
every tree, suggests that problems may still exist with both
over-simplification of the substitution process (i.e. ignoring exchangeabilities), overparameterization of the models and computational efficiency.
Our model is developed with more of a 'bottom-up' style
approach; we have introduced very few frequency classes,
that, based on our PCA of a set of real alignments, seem to
be the most important amino acid profiles. Furthermore,
we use the exchangeabilities from standard models (e.g.

JTT or WAG) and include the overall frequencies as one of
the classes. This setup allows nested model comparisons
for likelihood ratio tests to directly examine improvement
in model fit by the introduction of new classes.
It is interesting to compare this approach to that described
by Le and colleagues [23]. Le and colleagues have estimated a larger number of frequency classes directly by the
method of maximum likelihood from a large database of
alignments and therefore these classes in principle should
fit the data they were estimated from better than the PCA
approach described here. However, because of the
assumption of uniform exchangeabilities, they are likely
to estimate too many classes some of which are distorted
frequency classes that adjust for increased exchangeabilities present in more complex and realistic rate matrices
than the uniform matrix. Our approach may avoid this situation and therefore may require fewer frequency classes
to adequately capture the site-specific nature of protein
evolution. Furthermore, by including the data set frequencies as a fifth component, sites that show little preference
for a restricted amino acid profile, but evolve according to
the exchangeabilities of the JTT matrix can be accommodated.

The performance of ML tree reconstruction with the JTT + F + Γ model and the JTT + cF + Γ model
The performance of ML tree reconstruction with the JTT + F + Γ model and the JTT + cF + Γ model. The data
were simulated under the site-specific frequency model (JTT + ssF + Γ) based on amino acid frequencies observed at each site
of the HSP90 alignment. The ranges of branch-lengths a and b are 0.05–1.45 and 0.5–2.95, respectively, with an increment of
0.05. The left and right heatmaps represent, respectively, the proportions of correctly estimated trees estimated under JTT +
F + Γ and JTT + cF + Γ models. Each box of the heatmaps represents 100 simulations for the given conditions.

Nevertheless, despite the improvements in phylogenetic
estimation we have found, the four classes we introduced
from the PCA may in fact be too few to adequately capture
the diversity of 'site-specific' preferences in amino acids.
For instance, we did not recover a class where the basic
amino acids lysine and arginine predominate, even
though sites that rapidly switch between these amino

acids are clearly observable in protein families [31]. The
fact that the first two components of our PCA account for
only ~21% of the variance in the data indicates that inclusion of additional classes by investigation of the third or
more principal components from the PCA or other data
mining methods such as the self-organizing map [32] may
be fruitful future directions to take. In any case, our imple-

mentation of these methods in a generic Q-matrix mixture
model in QmmRAxML, allows the user to implement any
number of exchangeability matrices plus associated stationary frequency vectors to freely explore improvements
in model fit in protein evolution.

For each of the 21 data sets, a phylogenetic tree was estimated under the JTT + F + Γ model with 8 gamma rate categories using Tree-Puzzle (version 5.2). The resulting trees
were used to simulate amino acid sequences of 100, 000
sites under JTT + F + Γ using Seq-Gen [34].

Conclusion

Statistical analyses
Method 1 – Amino acid uniformity and uniformity test:
We utilized an information theoretical notation of relative
entropy (r), also called the Kullback-Leibler divergence
[35], to measure the amino acid uniformity at sites. It is
defined as:

We report the results of two statistical tests – the amino
acid frequency uniformity test and state counts test – that
demonstrate that in real protein alignments there are
fewer states at sites and the frequencies of these states are
less uniform than predicted by JTT + F + Γ model. We
show that use of standard 'average' frequency models like
JTT + F + Γ for phylogenetic estimation when the data are
simulated with site-specific frequencies leads to serious
LBA artefacts. A PCA of site-specific frequency vectors of
6555 sites from 21 protein data sets revealed four major
classes of sites. These classes can be used in a simple classfrequency (cF) mixture model for modelling site-specific
distributions for phylogenetic inference that we have
implemented in a program called QmmRAxML. Likelihood ratio tests indicate a large improvement in the fit of
JTT + cF + Γ over JTT + F + Γ for all data sets examined. Furthermore, the cF mixture model appears to ameliorate the
long-branch attraction problems, in both simulation
studies and in analyses of a phylogenomic data set. The cF
mixture model provides a new method for modelling sitespecific compositional heterogeneity and QmmRAxML is
a promising tool for exploring model fit in protein evolution and reconstructing more accurate phylogenies.

where Pi is the frequency of amino acid i at a given site. A
site with all 20 AA's having equal frequencies (Pi = 0.05)
would have an r = 0; a perfectly conserved site would
result in the maximum possible r = log20 = 4.32 bits; all
other sites would have an r between 0 and 4.32 bits.
The uniformity test asks whether the amino acid frequencies at sites in real data have the same uniformity as those
in data simulated under the JTT + F + Γ model. An r averaged over all sites is calculated respectively for a real data
set ( rreal ) and for a corresponding data set simulated
under JTT + F + Γ ( rJTT + F +Γ ). The simulated data have
100,000 sites, so the standard error of rJTT + F +Γ is effec-

Methods
Data sets
To obtain a representative set of protein alignments with
enough taxa and sites to test for departures from the
empirical JTT amino acid substitution model, we took the
7459 seed alignments from Pfam-A database (release
14.0) and filtered it using two criteria. First, only alignments with > 30 sequences were considered and submitted to the Gblocks program [33] to automatically trim
regions of ambiguous alignment with a minimum block
size set to 5 and maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions of 16. From this set of trimmed alignments only data sets with > 200 positions were
considered, yielding a final set of only 12 alignments. To
these 12 alignments, 9 alignments of proteins used for
phylogenetic studies in our laboratory were added that
met the requirement of > 30 taxa and > 200 sites after
trimming with Gblocks (using the same settings as
above). The 21 protein families examined are indicated in
Table 1 and include proteins with functional roles ranging
from components of the cytoskeleton (e.g. tubulins and
actin), to globular enzymes (e.g. CTP-synthetase) to viral
coat proteins (e.g. Poty_coat).

tively 0 and therefore can be ignored allowing a simple ztest. The test statistic for the uniformity test is a z-score
defined as

r
−r
z r = real JTT + F +Γ
s real n
where Sreal is the standard deviation of rreal and n is
number of sites in the real data.
Furthermore, the sites of the real and simulated data were
divided into four rate categories and Z-tests were conducted on each rate category separately.

states at a site in real data and in simulated data. The test

where Oy is the number of sites showing y distinct character states observed in real data and ey is expected number
of sites showing y distinct character states in simulated
data under JTT + F + Γ. The c2 has an approximate χ2 distribution with 19 degrees of freedom.
Simulations of four-taxon trees under a site-specific
frequency model
We sought to evaluate the potential impact of site-specific
amino acid frequencies on ML-based phylogenetic inference with empirical amino acid substitution models and
overall data set frequencies. To do this, site-specific amino
acid frequencies were calculated from the HSP90 protein
family and these frequencies were used to simulate data
sets of four sequences using covTREE (morticia.cs.dal.ca/
lab_public/?Download:covTREE), a C++ adaptation of
Seq-Gen. The simulation settings were as follows.

Following the studies of Huelsenbeck [36] and Wang et al.
[37], we evaluated tree reconstruction efficiency, over a
grid of branch-lengths a and b, for trees of the form of
((1:a,2:b),(3:a,4:b):b). In the figures, the grids of branchlengths have a on the x-axis and b on the y-axis with an
increment of 0.1 for both a and b, within a range of 0.05
to 2.95 substitutions per site. For each branch-length setting implied by a given element of the grid, 100 simulated
data sets were generated. For evaluation of the class frequency model described below, similar grids were calculated but with finer increments of 0.05, and focussing on
the 'Felsenstein zone' region. In this case the range of a
was 0.05–1.45 and the range of b was 0.5–2.95.
Principal components analysis of amino acid frequency at
sites
An amino acid frequency composition vector was calculated for every site in each of the 21 protein data sets and
assembled into a matrix of 6555 sites by 20 amino acid
frequencies. To investigate whether there were any recurring patterns in these frequency vectors, principal component analysis was performed using the R package [38]. The
four site classes, given in Figure 3, were determined as follows. An initial clustering divided sites into three classes
based of the first principal component (less than -0.04,
greater than 0.04 on the x-axis, or between these bounds).
For each cluster, linear regression applied to the first two
principal components gave the three lines in Figure 3.
Sites were then classified to whichever line they were least
distant from. To reduce the risk of misclassification, sites
with first principal component between -0.1 and 0.05 and
second principal component between -0.25 and 0.25 were
excluded from class frequency calculation associated with
the linearly determined classes; this gave a fourth class.
The aggregate amino acid frequencies of these four classes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/331

(i.e., the site frequency profiles) were calculated and used
in the class frequency model (see below).
A class frequency (cF) mixture model
We proposed a class frequency mixture model under
which the likelihood of a sequence site is a weighted sum
of the site likelihood conditional on each of the class frequencies found from the PCA analysis. In order to take
account of frequency distributions not modelled in the
PCA study of the limited data (the 21 data sets), the cF
mixture model was further added with a fifth class that
corresponds to the average amino acid frequency of the
whole data set. The cF model can further be combined
with a Γ model to take account of the rates-across-sites
variation and the site likelihood under a JTT + cF + Γ is
given in the following equation.

L( x i ) =

where xi are data at site i, the wc's are the probabilities (i.e.,
weights) of the class frequencies, including the whole data
set frequency as one class, rk is the rate of a Gamma distribution discretized into one of the g categories with equal
probabilities.
In this likelihood calculation the usual JTT + F + Γ model
is a special case of the JTT + cF + Γ mixture model when
the probability of each of the class frequency profiles is 0
and the probability of the whole data set frequency profile
is 1. Therefore, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) may be used
to compare the models, where the test statistics is twice
the difference in log-likelihoods of the alignment under
the two models and a P-value can be calculated from a χ2
distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. However, since
the parameters (i.e., the weights of the cFs) are on the
boundary of the parameter space, a simple χ2 approximation does not hold. The real distribution of the test statistics follows a mixture of χ2 distributions [39,40] and the
P-value is even smaller. If this were the only complication,
then the P-values reported using the χ2 distributions
would be conservative estimates.
However, an additional complication in calculating
degrees of freedom arises because the proteins for which a
comparison between the JTT + F + Γ and JTT + cF + Γ models was desired were sometimes also used in constructing
the class frequencies, although this is not true for the four
additional alignments at the bottom of Table 2. An
extremely conservative estimate in these cases would
adjust the degrees of freedom upwards by 19 × 4 = 76. In
this case, a difference in log likelihoods for the two mod-

els would be declared significant at the 5% level if it
exceeds 51. Table 2 indicates that this is the case for all but
two of the 21 proteins used in constructing the class frequencies. This adjustment, however, greatly understates
the significance of the differences. For a given alignment,
an additional 76 degrees of freedom would be appropriate if the class frequencies were chosen to give the largest
likelihood for that alignment. Not only are the class frequencies not chosen to give largest likelihoods but they
are based on 21 different alignments, making it unlikely
that any one alignment would have a substantial influence on them.
The cF mixture model was implemented in a maximum
likelihood framework for phylogenetic inference, by
modifying the source code of RAxML-VI-HPC version
2.2.3 [26] to produce the 'Q matrix mixture RAxML' or
QmmRAxML for short. As the weights for the class frequency profiles are not known, an Expectation-Maximization algorithm [41,42] (described in the following
subsection) was used to optimize the weights from an initial set of equal weights. In addition to modelling a mixture of site class-frequency profiles as discussed in this
paper, QmmRAxML may also be used to model any mixture of amino acid substitution matrices, such as those
based on protein secondary structures and solvent accessibilities at sites.
Parameter optimization and the ExpectationMaximization algorithm
In QmmRAxML we use an alternating scheme to optimize
parameters in the class frequency mixture model, including branch-lengths, the among-sites rate variation parameter (α) and the weights (wc) of class frequency vectors.
First the program has the branch-lengths and α optimized
with routines in the original RAxML for an initial set of wc,
which set all weights equal. Then it uses an EM algorithm
to optimize wc for the current branch-lengths and α. Then
it optimizes branch-lengths and α again and followed by
updating wc with another round of an EM. These processes
repeat until a maximum likelihood is reached for the current topology.

In updating the wc's each round of EM itself alternates
between performing an expectation (E) step, which computes a conditional expectation, conditional upon the
data, of the complete likelihood by including the latent
variables (wc) as if they were known, and a maximization
(M) step, which computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters by maximizing the expected likelihood found on the E step. The parameters found on the
M step are then used to begin another E step, and the process is repeated. Specifically the EM updating scheme for
the wc's is as follows.

Let Lci be the likelihood for the ith site fixing the cth class
frequency vector and Li be the overall likelihood at the
