Abstract
Background: Glutamine synthetase (GS; EC: 6.3.1.2, L-glutamate: ammonia ligase ADP-forming) is a key enzyme in
ammonium assimilation and metabolism of higher plants. The current work was undertaken to develop a more
comprehensive understanding of molecular and biochemical features of GS gene family in poplar, and to
characterize the developmental regulation of GS expression in various tissues and at various times during the
poplar perennial growth.
Results: The GS gene family consists of 8 different genes exhibiting all structural and regulatory elements
consistent with their roles as functional genes. Our results indicate that the family members are organized in 4
groups of duplicated genes, 3 of which code for cytosolic GS isoforms (GS1) and 1 which codes for the
choroplastic GS isoform (GS2). Our analysis shows that Populus trichocarpa is the first plant species in which it was
observed the complete GS family duplicated. Detailed expression analyses have revealed specific spatial and
seasonal patterns of GS expression in poplar. These data provide insights into the metabolic function of GS
isoforms in poplar and pave the way for future functional studies.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that GS duplicates could have been retained in order to increase the amount of
enzyme in a particular cell type. This possibility could contribute to the homeostasis of nitrogen metabolism in
functions associated to changes in glutamine-derived metabolic products. The presence of duplicated GS genes in
poplar could also contribute to diversification of the enzymatic properties for a particular GS isoform through the
assembly of GS polypeptides into homo oligomeric and/or hetero oligomeric holoenzymes in specific cell types.

Background
Glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2, L-glutamate:
ammonia ligase ADP-forming) catalyzes the ATP-dependent addition of ammonium (NH4+) to the g-carboxyl
group of glutamate to produce glutamine and acts as
the center for nitrogen flow in plants. Glutamate
synthase (Fd-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1; NADH-GOGAT, EC
1.4.1.1) then catalyzes the conversion of glutamine and
2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of glutamate,
one of which participates in further ammonium assimilation via GS while the other donates reduced nitrogen
for all nitrogen-containing biomolecules [1]. The ammonium assimilated by GS in the production of glutamine
can come from various sources, including direct uptake
from the soil, reduction of nitrate and nitrite, photorespiration, deamination of phenylalanine catalyzed by

phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and the catabolic release
of ammonium during the mobilization of vegetative storage proteins and during senescence.
Multiple nuclear encoded GS polypeptides are
expressed in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues of higher plants and these polypeptides are
assembled into oligomeric isoenzymes located either in
the cytosol or in the chloroplast [2,3]. Recently it has
been reported that plant GS holoenzyme has a decameric structure composed of two face-to face pentameric rings of subunits, with active sites formed
between every two neighboring subunits within each
ring [4,5]. Phylogenetic studies of nucleotide and amino
acid sequences have shown that genes for chloroplastic
and cytosolic GS in plants form two sister groups with a
common ancestor which diverged by duplication before
the split between angiosperms and gymnosperms [6].
In angiosperms there are two main isoforms of GS,
cytosolic GS (GS1) and a chloroplastic GS (GS2). This
suggests that there are several distinct pathways for

glutamine production, both spatially and temporally. In
developing leaves, glutamine is mainly produced in
chloroplasts through the activity of the GS2 isoenzyme.
The ammonium assimilated into glutamine in young
leaves is produced by nitrate reduction and through
photorespiration [7,8]. Alternatively, cytosolic GS1 primarily generates glutamine for intercellular nitrogen
transport. The cytosolic enzyme assimilates ammonium
taken up from the soil and released in the biosynthesis
of phenylpropanoids and nitrogen remobilization [9-11].
Thus, GS1 genes are differentially expressed in roots
and in vascular tissues. Molecular analysis of genomic
GS sequences from a number of angiosperm species has
shown that the cytosolic GS1 genes belong to a small
multigene family, whereas, the chloroplastic GS2 is
encoded by a single gene [9,10].
GS plays a fundamental role in growth and development of woody plants [11,12]. In poplar, this critical role
for GS has been clearly demonstrated through studies of
transgenic poplars that express ectopically the pine cytosolic GS. Transgenic poplars exhibit enhanced vegetative
growth [13,14], enhanced resistance to drought stress at
both ecophysiological and enzymatic and non-enzymatic
antioxidant levels [15], and enhanced nitrogen use efficiency [16]. These results clearly lead to the conclusion
that in poplar GS activity is a limiting factor in growth
and development. The current work was undertaken to
develop a more comprehensive understanding of molecular and biochemical features of GS gene family in poplar,
to establish an understanding of the roles of specific
members of the poplar GS gene family during development, and to characterize the developmental regulation
of GS expression in various tissues and at various times
during the poplar perennial growth.

Results
Identification and structural analysis of poplar GS genes

A search of the Populus trichocarpa whole genomic
sequence at the JGI [17] allowed us to identify regions

containing GS sequences. Eight sequences containing a
complete ORF as well as the structural and regulatory elements for a functional gene were retained for further
study. The poplar genome data base also contains 9 GS
pseudogenes as well as an additional GS gene showing a
high identity level to the GS genes in archaebacteria. The
full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) of the 8 GS genes were
analyzed and the characteristics of the polypeptides
encoded by their ORFs were compared (Table 1). The
results of all these bioinformatic analyses allowed the identification of 6 genes coding for a cytosolic GS iosenzyme
(GS1) and 2 genes coding for a plastidic GS isoenzyme
(GS2). Additionally, our analysis suggests that the GS gene
family in poplar is organized in 4 groups of duplicated
genes, PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and PtGS2. According to
the original identification numbers at the JGI database,
poplar GS1 genes were named PtGS1.1-710678 and
PtGS1.1-831163, PtGS1.2-716066 and PtGS1.2-819912,
PtGS1.3-827781 and PtGS1.3-834185. Following the same
criteria, poplar GS2 genes were named PtGS2-725763 and
PtGS2-820914. The genetic distance between the different
GS genes was calculated considering the complete genomic sequence of the individual members of the gene
family confirming the existence of the GS gene duplicates.
The four duplicated GS genes were positioned in the
linkage groups (LG) or scaffolds present in the Populus
trichocarpa genome (Figure 1). The genomic regions
where the GS genes were located were examined in
detail by determination of the open reading frames
(ORFs) upstream and downstream of the specific GS
genes and cross-alignment of these adjacent regions
between the gene pairs. Several duplicated genes were
collinearly positioned for the PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2 and
PtGS2 duplicates. However, it was not possible to localize the PtGS1.3 duplicate because the region dowstream
PtGS1.3-827781 was not present in the scaffold where
the gene is located (Figure 1). Non-duplicated genes
were also observed near the GS genes, as well as internal
duplications located on the same chromosome.

is located in the unassambled Scaffold 122. Arrows indicate the 5’-3’ orientation of genes. Red arrows connected by horizontal solid lines are the
duplicated GS genes. White arrows connected by dotted lines are duplicated collinear genes located adjacent to the positions where the GS
genes are present. White arrows connected by dashed-dotted lines are internal duplicated genes. The position of genes is marked by the
numbers of bp in each LG.

Structural analysis of the GS gene family in poplar was
performed by comparison of the exon/intron organization. As shown in Figure 2 the size of the exons is generally well conserved in the four duplicates, PtGS1.1,
PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and PtGS2. However, the genomic
structure is substantially different at the intron regions
with introns significantly divergent in size and sequence.
In contrast to these observed differences among the

gene duplications, the exon/intron boundaries are
almost identical between the two members of each
duplicate (Figure 2). The PtGS2 and PtGS1.2 duplicates
contain 13 exons and 12 introns, the PtGS1.3 duplicate
presents 12 exons and 11 introns, and the PtGS.1.1
duplicate contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Interestingly, exon 6 in the PtGS1.1 duplicate represents the
fusion of exons 6 and 7 in the PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and

PtGS2 duplicates. On the other hand, the last exon in
the PtGS1.1 and PtGS1.3 duplicates represents the
fusion of exons 12 and 13 in the PtGS1.2 duplicate. It is
interesting to note the presence of an intron of more
than 2 kb interrupting exons 5 and 6 in the PtGS1.2
duplicate.
Comparative analysis of GS gene families in sequenced
plant genomes

To examine the evolutionary relationships of poplar GS
genes we performed a cladistic analysis based on
deduced amino acid sequences, including the complete
GS gene families from the sequenced genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, grape, sorghum and poplar. Pine and spruce
GS genes were also included in this comparative analysis
(Figure 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction at the molecular
level shows the separation of cytosolic (GS1) and chloroplastic (GS2) sequences in angiosperms as two well differentiated clusters. Figure 3 also shows that poplar
duplicates for GS2 and GS1 genes were distributed in
the two clusters. GS1 genes from Arabidopsis, rice,
grape and sorghum were distributed in three subfamilies
and the PtGS1.2 and PtGS1.3 duplicates were clearly
associated to two of these subfamilies. In contrast, the
PtGS1.1 duplicate was outside the conserved GS1 subfamilies and was more closely aligned with the GS1 isoforms of gymnosperms that group outside the main
subfamilies of GS1 in angiosperms. However, these data
should be interpreted with caution because the support
values of the clades are moderate.
Regulatory regions in the poplar GS genes

In order to get insight into the function of GS genes in
poplar, the presence of regulatory elements in the 5’upstream regions was investigated. According to results
previously obtained in the structural and phylogenetic
analyses, we decided to consider exclusively regulatory
elements that were present in the two members of a GS
duplicate (Figure 4). In the PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2 and
PtGS1.3 genes, these common regulatory elements were
found concentrated in the proximal region of the promoter (about 600 bp upstream the initiation of translation). In contrast, the presence of common regulatory
elements spanned a major region in the promoter of the
PtGS2 duplicate (about 1300 bp upstream the initiation
of translation). Putative regulatory elements involved in
the interaction with Myb trancription factors were identified exclusively in the PtGS1.3 duplicate. Light-responsive elements such as GATA boxes were identified in all
gene duplicates except PtGS1.2. Regulatory elements
involved in tissue-specific gene expression (mesophyll,
roots) were identified in all genes except PtGS1.3,
whereas ABA response elements were present in the
promoters of PtGS1.2 duplicates. Boxes specific to

Page 4 of 16

cytokinin response were identified in all GS genes but
auxin response elements were exclusively found in
PtGS1.1. The poplar GS2 promoter contains a sequence
of about 200 bp showing a 90% identity with light-regulatory elements that have been functionally characterized
in the GS2 of pea and common bean [18]. Finally, the
presence of AT-rich regions was detected in all GS promoters although they were much less abundant in the
PtGS2 duplicate.
Organ-specific expression of duplicate GS genes in poplar

To understand the regulation of the GS gene family in
poplar and obtain further insight into the biological
roles of members in the gene family, GS expression was
precisely quantified spatial and temporally. Total RNA
was extracted from different organs and the relative
abundance of GS transcripts was determined quantitatively by real-time PCR (qPCR). In all cases the transcript levels were normalized by comparison with
expression levels of reference genes (as described in
Material and Methods). Two month-old hybrid poplars
were divided into above-ground and root-regions (Figure
5). The aerial region included the meristematic apex (A),
young leaves and stem internodes (A1), intermediate
leaves and stem internodes (A2), mature leaves and
stem internodes (A3). Aerial regions A1, A2 and A3
were further subdivided in lamina of the leaf (L), leaf
vein (V) and stem (S). The root region included the
main root close to the root crown (R1) and the secondary root masses (R2). As shown in Figure 5, gene
expression profiles of PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and
PtGS2 differed significantly in the samples examined.
PtGS1.1 transcripts were particularly abundant in the
aerial regions containing intermediate and mature leaves
(A2 and A3) and in R2. Interestingly, maximum levels
of PtGS1.1 expression were observed in the leaf lamina
(L2, L3) with decreased abundance in the leaf veins (V2,
V3). Minor levels of gene expression were observed in
petioles (P2, P3) and stems (S2, S3). For the PtGS1.2
duplicate the highest transcript abundance was observed
in the secondary root masses (R2), while about a half of
this value was observed in petioles (P2, P3) and stems
(S2, S3) of the aerial parts (A1 and A2). Much lower
levels of PtGS1.2 transcripts were detected in remaining
samples. Figure 5 also shows that expression of the
PtGS1.3 duplicate was predominant among the poplar
GS1 genes, and high levels of PtGS1.3 transcripts were
observed in the apex, aerial and root sections. Furthermore, levels of PtGS1.3 transcripts were highest of the
poplar GS gene family in the apex. It is important to
note that in the aerial sections, expression of PtGS1.3
was clearly associated with samples enriched in vascular
tissue, such as petioles (P1, P2 and P3) and stems (S1,
S2 and S3) whereas lower levels of gene expression were

observed in the leaf lamina in all sections examined.
Finally, analysis of the PtGS2 duplicate revealed that the
transcripts of this family member were the most abundant in the young leaves (A1), and decreased progressively from the top to the bottom of the tree, with the
lowest values detected in the roots.
In order to determine if there was a correspondence
between the expression patterns of the GS transcripts
and the distribution of GS polypeptides, we examined
the distribution of GS polypeptides in different organs.
Total proteins were extracted from leaves, stems and
roots of two month-old poplar trees and GS polypeptides in these organs were identified by western blot

analysis using antibodies raised against pine GS [19]. It
has been previously reported that these antibodies were
able to recognize specifically poplar GS polypeptides
[13]. Figure 6A shows the identification of two GS polypeptides, GS2 (45 kDa) and GS1 (40 kDa) in the leaf
lamina. The GS1 polypeptide was predominant in stems
and roots.
In order to investigate the correspondence of GS trancripts and GS polypeptides in the different organs, total
proteins from the same protein samples (leaves, stems
and roots) were also separated by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), and the GS polypeptides
identified by western blotting (Figure 6B). This

experimental approach allowed us to identify GS polypeptides of different charge among the family of GS
polypeptides of the same size. Thus, in the leaf lamina
the GS2 polypeptide was resolved as several spots with
the most abundant exhibiting a calculated isoelectric
point (pI) of 5.26. The GS1 polypeptide was resolved as
a major spot of a pI of 5.52. In the stem, two major
major spots corresponded to GS1 polypeptides of pI
5.20 and 5.81. Finally, in the roots the major GS1 spot
had a calculated pI of 5.14. These experimental pI
values were in the range of the predicted pI values for
poplar GS polypeptides (Table 1).
Seasonal changes in GS gene expression

We were also interested to know the seasonal changes
in the expression of the GS gene family in poplar. Transcript levels of PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and PtGS2
were quantitatively determined in RNA extracts from
leaves, stem, buds and bark of 10-year-old poplar trees
(Populus tremula x P. alba, clone INRA 7171 1-B-4).
Figure 7 shows that GS duplicates exhibited contrasting
patterns of gene expression during annual growth. The
expression of the PtGS1.1 duplicate was very low during
winter and increased during spring to reach the maximum values at the end of summer and autumn. Interestingly, the peak values of transcripts were observed in
leaves. Transcript abundance for the PtGS1.2 duplicate
was low in all samples examined at the different seasons
of the year. PtGS1.3 was highly expressed in stems buds
and bark during all seasons with peak transcript levels

during spring and autumn. Interestingly, the levels of
PtGS1.3 transcripts were low in leaves except in autumn
when levels increased significantly. Finally, high levels of
PtGS2 transcripts were exclusively detected in expanding leaves in spring.

Discussion
The GS gene family in poplar consists of 8 different
genes which exhibit all structural and regulatory elements to be potentially considered as functional genes
(Table 1). A detailed analysis of the genomic GS
sequences suggests that the GS gene family in poplar is
organized into 4 groups of duplicated genes, PtGS1.1,
PtGS1.2, PtGS1.3 and PtGS2. These GS genes are distributed on separate loci in different chromosomes, and
to our knowledge, Populus trichocarpa is the first plant
species in which the complete GS family is observed to
be duplicated. However, the duplication of a single GS
gene has been previously reported in plants. Thus, two
copies of GS1 genes have been described in Pisum sativum [20], and more recently the occurrence of two distinct GS2 genes have been reported in Medicago
truncatula [21]. Homology-microsynteny analysis of the
genomic regions where the GS genes are located
strongly suggests that the origin of the duplicated genes
is a genome-wide duplication event that occurred
approximately 65 Myr and which is still detectable over
approximately 92% of the poplar genome [17]. Following
duplication, new copies of a gene may undergo modifications allowing functional diversification, which is a

significant source of evolutionary novelty in plants [22].
However, it is also possible that a duplicated gene copy
is rapidly lost through pseudogenisation. Interestingly,
the exon-intron organization is highly conserved in each
pair of duplicated genes in poplar and similar regulatory
elements are present in their promoters. These findings
provide evidence supporting the expression of GS duplicates in the same cell-types where they are subjected to
similar developmental and environmental cues. Furthermore, their coding regions are also quite well-conserved,
indicating they encode for essentially the same or very
similar GS enzymes. All these results suggest that these
duplicated genes could play equivalent roles in poplar
nitrogen metabolism.
The molecular and functional analyses of GS gene
families in other plants revealed specialization of GS isoenzymes to fulfil specific and non-overlapping roles in
nitrogen metabolism depending of the tissue and plant
species [9,10]. Phylogenetic analyses of poplar GS genes
have shown that genes encoding chloroplastic and

cytosolic isoforms form two sister groups as previously
described for other GS gene families [10]. It has been
suggested that the two groups of genes (GS1 and GS2)
diverged by duplication from a common ancestor [23]
and that this separation occurred before the divergence
of gymnosperms/angiosperms [5] but possibly after the
appearance of vascular plants [24]. It has been proposed
that the gain of a N-terminal transit peptide in GS2
would provide adaptive advantages to plants through
enhanced photorespiratory ammonium assimilation in
the plastids [12]. Members of the GS1 clade in angiosperms are grouped in subfamilies as previously reported
by others [6,10,21]. PtGS1.2 and PtGS1.3 duplicates
were found associated to these subfamilies suggesting
they could play similar functions to those described for
these isoforms. In contrast, the PtGS1.1 duplicate was
found separated from PtGS1.2 and PtGS1.3 genes.
The intron-exon organization of the poplar GS genes
supports the above hypothesis (Figure 3). The positions
and lengths of exons are quite similar for all genes

Castro-Rodríguez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/119

suggesting that the structure of the ancestral GS gene
has been maintained during evolution with some modifications, such as the presence of a plastid targeting
sequence in the first exon of GS2 and minor changes in
some other exons of GS1 genes.
A detailed analysis of GS transcript abundance in different tissues and organs of poplar allowed us to identify
specific expression patterns of the individual members
of the gene family (Figures 5 and 7). PtGS2 transcripts
were most abundant in leaves as previously reported for
other angiosperms where the GS2 isoform is responsible
for assimilation of photorespiratory ammonium [9,10].
In fact, the promoters of the poplar GS2 duplicates contained cis regulatory elements described in other GS2
genes in angiosperms [18]. An additional role of GS2 is
the assimilation of nitrate-derived ammonium in leaves.
It is well known that plants differ in the localization of
nitrate reduction and assimilation. Thus, some species
localize nitrate reduction and assimilation in the roots,
whereas other species assimilate nitrate preferentially in
the leaves. In poplar, most nitrate assimilation takes
place in the leaves [25]. Therefore, high levels of the
GS2 isoform are necessary to assimilate the ammonium
generated by nitrate reduction within the chloroplast.
Only one of the three PtGS1 duplicates in poplar,
PtGS1.1, was also preferentially expressed in leaves and
interestingly its expression pattern spatially complemented the observed expression pattern of PtGS2. Thus,
PtGS1.1 transcripts were particularly abundant in the
older leaves located at the basal part of the tree. These
results suggest a relevant role of PtGS1.1 in glutamine
biosynthesis associated to photosynthetic metabolism in
leaves. Furthermore, the presence of light-regulation
boxes [26,27] in the promoter regions of PtGS1.1 duplicates (Figure 4) is consistent with our data and may
explain the above described expression pattern in green
leaves.
Poplar GS1.2 was preferentially expressed in roots of
young trees suggesting a role for this gene duplicate in
primary assimilation of nitrogen from soil, as it has
been previously described for other cytosolic GS
enzymes in plants [28-30]. Interestingly, the relative
abundance of PtGS1.2 transcripts increased significantly
(12 fold) in poplar leaves infected with Pseudomonas
syringae, whereas the expression of other members of
the GS gene family was not affected (data not shown).
The induction of a GS1 gene in response to pathogen
attack has been previously described [31,32]. Moreover,
it has been demonstrated in infected tomato leaves and
senescing tobacco leaves that the cytosolic isoform
involved in nitrogen remobilisation is the product of a
GS1 gene preferentially expressed in roots [33,34].
These data, together with our work described here

Page 10 of 16

suggest that PtGS1.2 may have a role in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence.
In young trees, the maximum expression levels of the
twin PtGS1.3 genes were detected in stems and petioles.
Furthermore, this member of the poplar GS family
exhibited the highest levels of gene expression suggesting it plays an essential role in nitrogen metabolism.
The regulatory regions of the PtGS1.3 duplicates contained AC elements involved in the interaction with
members of the R2R3 Myb factors regulating the transcription of genes for lignin biosynthesis [35,36]. Similar
cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors have
been found to coordinate lignin biosynthesis and nitrogen recycling in pine [37], suggesting that PtGS1.3 is
involved in nitrogen recycling associated to lignification
in poplar. Transcriptomic analyses have also suggested a
role of Dof family members in the regulation of genes
under conditions resulting in increased lignin deposition
[38]. The differential regulation of cytosolic GS genes in
conifers by a member of the Dof family (Dof5) was
recently reported [39] and putative regulatory elements
for Dof regulation have been identified in poplar GS
genes (Figure 4). Furthermore, we have found that
orthologous Dof factors are also involved in the regulation of GS isoforms in poplar (García-Gutiérrez, Avila
C, Cánovas FM, unpublished data). The analysis of GS
polypeptides in different poplar organs by 2D-PAGE
(Figure 6) largely confirmed the expression patterns
determined for the duplicated GS genes. The GS polypeptides were resolved in four major spots with differential accumulation in poplar organs. Thus, in the leaves,
the GS2 and GS1 polypeptides displayed pI values in the
range of the calculated pI values for the PtGS2 and
PtGS1.1 gene expression products (Table 1). In stems,
the predominant GS1 polypeptide is predicted to be the
expression product of the PtGS1.3 duplicate whereas the
major GS1 polypeptide in roots is predicted to be the
expression product of PtGS1.2. This conclusion is supported by the close similarity between the pI values of
the GS1 isoforms separated in Figure 6 and the corresponding values deduced from the polypeptides encoded
by the PtGS1.3 and PtGS1.2 duplicates (Table 1).
The analysis of transcripts in adult trees during one
year of growth (Figure 7) showed that the expression of
the poplar GS family members is seasonally regulated.
The expression of the PtGS2 duplicate was high in
leaves in spring when photosynthesis and photorespiration are at maximum levels [40]. Furthermore, glutamine is required to initiate vegetative protein
accumulation during new shoot development in spring
[41]. Developing leaves represent a strong sink for nitrogen during active growth [42]. High levels of PtGS1.1
gene expression were also found in leaves of adult trees

Castro-Rodríguez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/119

in summer and autumn when the expression of PtGS2 is
very low. These data suggest that the GS1.1 isoform
could play an important role in the redistribution of
nitrogen from poplar leaves to stems during summer
and autumn. In leaves, stem, buds and bark of adult
trees, extremely low levels of PtGS1.2 transcripts were
detected in winter and summer, however, slight
increases were observed in spring and autumn. Nitrogen
mobilisation in poplar is seasonally regulated with recycling and transport of nitrogen compounds from senescing tissues to storage tissues in autumn and
remobilisation of nitrogen reserves to support active
growth in spring [42]. In adult trees, PtGS1.3 gene
expression was seasonally regulated with particularly
high transcript levels in spring and autumn. Transcript
abundance was much high in heterotrophic tissues such
as stem, buds and bark, with the exception of senescent
leaves in autumn.
The role of cytosolic GS in poplar growth and biomasss production has been reported previously [13,14].
Furthermore, enhanced GS expression in poplar results
in enhanced efficiency of nitrogen assimilation [16]. The
role of GS1 in ammonium assimilation and nitrogen
remobilisation is particularly important in perennial
plants that are able to cope with recurrent periods of
growth and dormancy. For example, trees divert large
amounts of carbon to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids needed to generate lignin, an important constituent of wood. Although lignin does not contain nitrogen,
during wood formation there is significant release of
nitrogen in the form of ammonium when phenylalanine
is deaminated and channeled into lignin biosynthesis
and when glycine is decarboxylated in C1 metabolism.
These two metabolic pathways are active in lignifying
cells [43]. Ammonium ions released must be reintegrated into metabolism in order to maintain high rates
of lignification without affecting nitrogen economy
[12,44]. In fact, poplar GS1 transcripts and polypeptides
accumulate in developing xylem cells where activities of
enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and
C1 metabolism are high and, therefore, ammonium is
liberated [45,46]. According to these findings we decided
to examine in silico the expression of GS genes during
wood formation in hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x
Populus tremuloides) using the microarray data available
in Populus DB [47]. Principal component analysis (Additional file 1) showed a high degree of co-expression for
PtGS1.3 and relevant genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and C1 metabolism. In contrast, other members of
the GS family also expressed during poplar wood formation (PtGS1.1 and PtGS2) did not show such correlation.
Taken together, these data suggest an essential role of
PtGS1.3 in lignifying tissues of poplar.

Conclusion
In the present study the structural and expression analysis of the GS gene family in poplar is presented. The GS
gene family consists of 8 different genes exhibiting all
structural and regulatory elements consistent with their
roles as functional genes. Our results indicate that the
family members are organized in 4 groups of duplicated
genes, 3 of which code for cytosolic GS isoforms (GS1)
and 1 codes for the chloroplast located GS isoform
(GS2). Detailed expression analyses have revealed specific spatial and seasonal patterns of GS gene regulation
in poplar (Figure 8). These data provide insights into
the metabolic function of GS isoforms in poplar and
pave the way for future functional studies.
Our analysis shows that Populus trichocarpa is the
first plant species in which it was observed the complete
GS family duplicated. Considering all data in the present
paper, it appears that GS genes have been highly conserved following whole-genome duplication in poplar. In
contrast, duplicated members of other gene families in
poplar have rapidly diverged [48,49]. Some authors
argue that genes involved in transcriptional regulation
and developmental genes are preferentially retained [50].
It has also been proposed that one of the factors influencing the probability of duplicate gene retention is its
connectivity [22]. Our data suggest that GS duplicates
could have been retained in order to increase the
amount of enzyme in a particular cell type. This possibility could contribute to the homeostasis of nitrogen
metabolism in functions associated to changes in glutamine-derived metabolic products. It has been reported
that recently duplicated genes play an important role in
the functional compensation of metabolic products in
Arabidopsis [51]. The presence of duplicated GS genes
in poplar could also contribute to diversification of the
enzymatic properties for a particular GS isoform
through the assembly of GS polypeptides into homo oligomeric and/or hetero oligomeric holoenzymes in specific cell types. Further research is needed to confirm
these hypotheses.
Methods
Plant material

Experiments were performed with hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba, clone INRA 717 1-B4, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, INRA). For
the expression analysis in different plant organs, plants
were micropropagated in vitro on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) as described previously
[13]. Unless otherwise noted, plantlets were maintained
under conditions described previously [13,14]. Rooted
shoots were transferred to plant growth chambers in
plastic pots containing a potting mix (HM3-Agromálaga,

Figure 8 Schematic representation of the spatial and seasonal regulation of the poplar GS family. The arrows and intensity of colors
indicate the existence of a gradient of gene expression along the plant axis. Maximum values of gene expression in leaves, stems and roots
were considered in the scheme. Global seasonal variation reflects major changes in gene expression.

Málaga, Spain) and vermiculite in proportions 1:1. After
ex-vitro acclimatization, the plantlets were maintained
for 8 weeks in the following conditions: temperature
was kept constant at 22°C, day-length was set at 16
hours, light was supplied at an intensity of 125 μmol m2
s-1 and humidity was fixed about 80%. Plants were regularly supplied with a nutrient solution containing 10
mM potassium nitrate. At the end of the growing period, P. tremula x P. alba plants were harvested and samples taken from 15 different sections from the shoot
apex to the root tip.
The aerial regions of the plants was divided into four
parts: the apical bud (A), the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th
apical leaves (A1); the intermediate region with the 6th,
7th, 8th, 9th and 10th leaves (A2), and the more basal
region including 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th leaves
(A3). Each section was further divided in: L, leaf lamina;
V, principal midrib; P, petiole; S, stem. The root was
sectioned in R1, principal root and R2, secondary root.
Seasonal analysis of gene expression was monitored in
10-year-old trees of hybrid poplars located in the experimental centre Grice-Hutchinson, Barrio de San Julián,
29004, Málaga, Spain. The samples used were leaves,
stems, buds and bark from hybrid trees. The samples
were harvested in mid- March, June, September and
December of 2008.
Identification of GS gene duplicates and chromosomal
mapping

The GS nucleotide and protein sequences were identified using the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups section of
the Join Genome institute (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html). The protein identifiers
used in this genome portal have been conserved in our
study (Table 1). GS sequences captured from the poplar
database were annotated by blastp searches in the GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The p-distances among the exonic and intronic regions of the GS
family were calculated with the phylogenetic program
MEGA 4 [52], sewing the intron sections of each gene
in continuous sequence. The degree of identity between
the genomic regions in which the GS duplicated genes
were located was explored by using a strategy of searching microsynteny among the different Linkage Groups.
Upstream and downstream genomic sequences were
aligned with CLUSTALW [53] and the ORF sequences
flanking the GS genes were located manually. Results
were then compared with those reported by [17].
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

The alignment of the Populus trichocarpa GS protein
sequences was carried out with CLUSTALW [53]. The
protein sequences used in the construction of the

Page 13 of 16

phylogenetic tree were collected from species whose
genomes have been fully sequenced. Additionally,
sequences of other interesting arboreal species, including Pinus or Picea, have been included. The protein
sequences, and their corresponding identifiers, were
found in the following databases:
Populus trichocarpa and Sorghum bicolor: http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Pinus sylvestris and Picea sitchensis: http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html.
Arabidopsis thaliana: http://www.arabidopsis.org/
Oryza sativa: http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/
Vitis vinifera: http://www.phytozome.net/
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the phylogeny platform http://www.phylogeny.fr/[54] and comprised the following steps. Sequences were aligned using
T-Coffee (v6.85) using the 10 best local alignments
(Lalign_pair), an accurate global alignment (slow_pair).
After alignment, ambiguous regions were removed with
Gblocks (v0.91b). Minimum length of a block after gap
cleaning was set at 10; no gap positions were allowed in
the final alignment. All segments with contiguous nonconserved positions greater than 8 were rejected. The
minimum number of sequences for a flank position was
set at 85%. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed
using the neighbor joining method implemented in the
BioNJ program, using as substitution model a Dayhoof
PAM matrix and including 1000 bootstraps. Distances
were calculated using ProtDist. The DAY substitution
model was selected for the analysis [55].
Promoter analysis

The presence of regulatory elements in the 5’-upstream
region of poplar GS genes was analyzed starting in the
ATG codon of initiation of translation. Sequences for
each pair of duplicated genes were aligned by means of
MultAlin [56] in order to locate common regions, and
those showing high identity were analyzed to identify
putative cis regulatory elements in the plant databases
PLACE [57] and PlantCARE [58]. Sequence stretches of
600 base pairs for the GS1 genes and 1300 base pairs
for GS2 genes were compared. More distant regions
were not considered, because the p-distance values in
these regions showed that similarity between the duplicated sequences diminished considerably.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Samples from photosynthetic tissues (0.25 g) or nonphotosynthetic tissues (0.5 g) were ground under liquid
nitrogen with a mortar and pestle in proportions 1:2
and 1:1, respectively. RNA extraction was performed as
described by Canales et al. [59] with minor modifications. The RNA was quantified with a NanoDrop ® ND-

Castro-Rodríguez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/119

1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.
Wilmington, USA). The integrity of RNA in the samples
was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis.
The cDNA synthesis was performed by means of the
PrimeScriptTM RT reagent (Perfect Real Time) of
Takara BIO Inc. (Otsu, Shiga Japan), following the
instructions recommended by the manufacturer. The
reaction mix contained 0.5 μg of total RNA in a final
volume of 10 μL, which were incubated during 15 min
at 37 °C.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)

The 3’ untranslated regions of PtGS1.1, PtGS1.2,
PtGS1.3 and PtGS2 duplicates were compared to identify
sequences with high identity for each pair of duplicated
genes. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify
specifically the transcripts encoded by each pair of
duplicated genes. Sequences of forward and reverse primers follow.

PCR products were verified by melting point analysis
at the end of each experiment. The identity of the PCR
products for each GS duplicate was tested during protocol development by gel electrophoresis and confirmed
by DNA sequencing (Additional file 2).
The relative quantification of the gene expression was
carried out by qPCR using a thermal cycler (Real System
Stratagene MX Swindles PCR 3000PTM, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The qPCR system was the
QUANTIMIX EASY SYG (Biotools B&M Labs S.A.
Madrid, Spain) and the protocols followed were those
recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR reactions
were performed by triplicate using samples without
DNA as controls. The volume of the qPCR samples was
2 μL containing 10 ng of cDNA from the RT reactions.
The amplification program had 3 steps: i) 1 cycle (95°C,
2 min); ii) 40 cycles, cDNA denaturing (95°C, 15 s),
hybridization (55°C, 15 s) and extension (72°C, 30 s); iii)
1 cycle (95 °C, 1 min) and 1 cycle (30 s) for absolute
temperatures from 55°C to 95°C to generate the dissociation curve in order to confirm the specific amplification of each individual reaction.
The relative expression levels were calculated by using
actin2 and ubiquitin as reference genes [60]. The initial
number of transcripts of the candidate and reference
genes (N0) was calculated by means of the LinRegPCR
software version 11.0 [61]. The normalized N 0 was

Page 14 of 16

found by calculating the ratio between the averages of
the N 0 of the replicates and the N 0 of the reference
genes (normalization factor).
Protein extraction and western blot analysis

Poplar protein extraction was performed using the following protocol. One gram of plant tissue was homogenized in mortar and pestle with 1 g of sand and 1 mL of
extraction buffer [0.175 M Tris pH 8.8, 5% SDS (w/v),
15% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 M mercaptoethanol]. The extract
was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4°C for 30 min. The
supernatant was mixed with 4 volumes of acetone for 1
h at -20°C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g 4°C for 30
min. The resulting pellet was washed with 80% (v/v)
acetone and centrifuged two times at 10,000 × g 4°C
for15 min. The pellet was dried and solubilized in loading buffer for SDS-electrophoresis on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Resolved polypeptides were
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany) and the presence
of GS polypeptides was immunorevealed as described by
Cánovas et al. [62] using the antiserum raised against
recombinant pine GS [19]. Subsequent detection of
immunocomplexes was carried out by a peroxidase
assay.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as
described previously [63]. Poplar proteins were solubilized in isoelectrofocusing (IEF) loading buffer. The
amount of protein loaded per gel was 30 μg. IEF slab
gels were 80 × 70 × 1 mm consisting of 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 8.3 M urea, 2.5% (v/v) carrier ampholytes
(Pharmalyte pH 4-6). IEF was performed at 200 V for
2.5 h. The second dimension electrophoresis was also
performed in 80 × 70 × 1.5 mm slab gels of 12.5% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gels containing SDS as described above.
The resolved proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunodetection was performed
essentially as described for one-dimensional western
blots.
Protein quantification

Protein levels were determined by the Bradford’s procedure [64]. In samples solubilized with SDS protein contents were estimated as described by Ekramoddoullah
[65].

characterized by the mutually exclusive expression of PtGS1.1-710678 and
