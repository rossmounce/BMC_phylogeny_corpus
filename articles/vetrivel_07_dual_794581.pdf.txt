Abstract
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ)
peptides. Aβ is released from ectodomain cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APP) via
intramembranous proteolysis by γ-secretase, a complex consisting of presenilin and a few other
proteins. p23/TMP21, a member of the p24 family type I transmembrane proteins, was recently
identified as a presenilin complex component capable of modulating γ-secretase cleavage. The p24
family proteins form oligomeric complexes and regulate vesicular trafficking in the early secretory
pathway, but their role in APP trafficking has not been investigated.
Results: Here, we report that siRNA-mediated depletion of p23 in N2a neuroblastoma and HeLa
cells produces concomitant knockdown of additional p24 family proteins and increases secretion
of sAPP. Furthermore, intact cell and cell-free Aβ production increases following p23 knockdown,
similar to data reported earlier using HEK293 cells. However, we find that p23 is not present in
mature γ-secretase complexes isolated using an active-site γ-secretase inhibitor. Depletion of p23
and expression of a familial AD-linked PS1 mutant have additive effects on Aβ42 production.
Knockdown of p23 expression confers biosynthetic stability to nascent APP, allowing its efficient
maturation and surface accumulation. Moreover, immunoisolation analyses show decrease in coresidence of APP and the APP adaptor Mint3. Thus, multiple lines of evidence indicate that p23
function influences APP trafficking and sAPP release independent of its reported role in γ-secretase
modulation.
Conclusion: These data assign significance to p24 family proteins in regulating APP trafficking in
the continuum of bidirectional transport between the ER and Golgi, and ascribe new relevance to
the regulation of early trafficking in AD pathogenesis.

Background
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I membrane
protein that is trafficked through the secretory and endocytic pathways in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and is
the precursor to 40–42 amino acid residue β-amyloid
peptides (Aβ). Cerebral deposition of Aβ in senile plaques
is a pathological feature of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Aβ deposits are also found in aged individuals. Aβ is liberated from APP via sequential proteolysis
by β- and γ-secretases [1]. Cleavage of APP within the
lumenal domain by BACE1, the major neuronal β-secretase, releases the APP ectodomain and generates the N-terminus of Aβ [2]. The APP ectodomain can also be released
by cleavage at the "α-secretase" site within the Aβ domain
by zinc metallopreotases such as TACE/ADAM17,
ADAM9, ADAM10 and MDC-9, and an aspartyl protease
BACE2 [3]. The C-terminal APP stubs (APP CTFs) resulting from α – and β-secretase cleavage serve as substrates
for intramembranous proteolysis by γ-secretase, a multimeric complex made of presenilin (PS) 1 or 2, nicastrin,
APH1 and PEN2 [4]. Mature components of the γ-secretase complex are found, and shown to be enzymatically
active, at the cell surface as well as in multiple organelles
such as the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC),
Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and late
endosomes [5]. Activation of Notch signaling also
involves sequential proteolytic processing, which closely
resembles proteolysis of APP. Following ligand binding at
the cell surface, Notch is endocytosed and sequentially
cleaved by ADAM family metalloproteases and γ-secretase
[6]. Enhancer/suppressor screen studies in Caenorhabditis
elegans originally suggested a role for p24 proteins in the
transport regulation of Notch receptors to the cell surface
[7]. Reducing the activity of the p24 family member SEL9 increased the cell surface accumulation of a transportdefective GLP-1 mutant, and increased the activity of
mutant LIN-12 or GLP-1. Recently γ-secretase complex
was found to contain p23 (also called TMP21), a p24 family protein. Intriguingly, reducing p23 expression resulted
in increased γ-secretase cleavage of APP, without affecting
the proteolysis of Notch [8].
The p24 proteins are a phylogenetically-conserved family
of type I transmembrane proteins [9] that are highly
enriched in the ER, Golgi, and coat protein (COP) I and II
transport vesicles [10,11]. Mammalian p24 family consists of six members, p23/TMP21, p24/p24a, p25/gp25L,
p26/p24b, p27, and tp24, which function as hetero-oligomeric complexes [12]. Sorting motifs in the cytosolic tail
of p24 proteins bind to coat proteins of COPI and COPII
vesicles [13-16], and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1)
[17]. Furthermore, p23, p24a, and p25 are present in
complexes with the Golgi reassembly stacking proteins
GRASP55 and GRASP65 [18]. A yeast strain lacking all
eight members of the p24 family was viable displaying

only minor secretory deficits [19], while in mice targeted
disruption of both p23 alleles resulted in early embryonic
lethality [20]. Proposed roles of the p24 proteins include
COP vesicle cargo receptors, regulators of COP vesicle
budding, ER quality control, and organization of the
Golgi apparatus [7,13,16,21-25]. Recent evidence suggests that p24 proteins may specifically populate a subset
of COPI vesicles [26] or influence the formation of tubular transport intermediates [27]. Thus, their precise role in
early secretory pathway trafficking, and more importantly
sorting of specific cargo, still remains elusive.
Here, we investigated p23 modulation of APP metabolism
and report that diminution of p23 expression in non-neuronal and neuroblastoma cell lines leads to increased biosynthetic stability and maturation of nascent APP, cell
surface accumulation of APP, as well as secretion of sAPP.
Selective increase in Aβ42 production associated with a
familial AD (FAD)-linked PS mutation occurs independently of p23 modulation of APP metabolism. Finally,
immunoisolation and immunofluorescence analysis
reveals redistribution of APP and its adaptor Mint3/X11γ
in cells with knockdown of p23 expression, suggesting a
potential mechanism by which p23 may influence APP
trafficking and sAPP release. Our data reveal a novel role
for the p24 family proteins in regulating early secretory
pathway trafficking of holo APP in addition to the recently
reported modulation of γ-secretase cleavage of APP CTFs.

Results
siRNA knockdown of p23 expression affects secretion of
APPs and Aβ peptides in mouse neuroblastoma cells
Transfection with synthetic p23 siRNA markedly attenuated p23 expression (>85% knockdown of p23 expression) in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells relative to nonspecific control siRNA transfection (Fig. 1A). Previously
based on deletion analysis in yeast and mammalian cells,
it was reported that members of the p24 family depend on
each other for proper assembly into stable oligomeric
complexes [20,28]. Consistent with this prediction and a
recent report [8], p23 knockdown produced concomitant
reduction in the levels of p24, p25, and tp24. The steadystate levels of the ER resident transmembrane protein calnexin, Golgi associated β-COP subunit of the coatomer,
and Golgi matrix proteins p115 and Grasp55 were unaffected by p23 knockdown (Fig. 1). However, we noted
minor increase in PS1 NTF as well as an increase in the levels of immature and mature nicastrin, but the levels of
PEN2 remained unchanged. In accordance with the recent
report by Chen et al. [8], siRNA knockdown of p23 expression in N2a cells stably expressing an FAD-linked APP
mutant (N2aSwe cells) increased secretion of Aβ40 by 55%
(10.7 ng/ml in NS siRNA cells versus 16.7 ng/ml in p23
siRNA cells; p < 0.05) and Aβ42 by approximately 4.5-fold
(0.08 ng/ml in NS siRNA cells versus 0.38 ng/ml in p23

Next we sought to determine whether secretion of sAPP
also parallels increased secretion of Aβ in p23-depleted

siRNA (Fig 1E). Our results are in accordance with the earlier reported role for p23 in modulating Aβ production,
but since p23 knockdown invariably attenuates the
expression of several p24 family proteins, our results also
suggest a broader role for p24 family proteins in regulating APP metabolism and secretion.
Knockdown of p23 affects APP maturation and cell surface
expression
Compared with the results from HEK293 cells [8], an
increase in sAPP release observed in N2a neuroblastoma
cells was unexpected. Furthermore, modulation of γ-secretase activity by p23 interaction with the presenilin complex seems insufficient to explain this perplexing
observation on sAPP release, which is dependent on cleavage by α – or β-secretase. This prompted us to further
examine p23 modulation of sAPP secretion in HeLa cells,
as an additional non-neuronal cell line. Similar to N2a
cells, transient siRNA knockdown of p23 expression in
HeLa cells stably expressing an FAD-linked APP mutant
(HeLaSwe) also markedly reduced the levels of other p24
family proteins without discernable effects on the levels of
PS1, nicastrin, PEN2, β-COP or calnexin (Fig. 2A and data
not shown). However, in p23-depleted cells we noted a
clear increase in mature APP (upper band of the doublet),
and APP CTFs resulting from cleavage of APP by α – or βsecretases. Continuous 3 h labeling using [35S]met/cys followed by immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a 2-fold
increase (p < 0.001) in the levels of sAPP released into the
media conditioned by p23-depleted cells, despite similar
steady-state levels of immature and mature APP holopro-

tein relative to non-specific siRNA transfected cells (Fig.
2B and 2C).
Does p23 knockdown alter the kinetics of nascent APP
polypeptide maturation? To address this issue, we performed pulse/chase-labeling experiments. Although APP
synthesis is similar to control cells following 15 min pulse
labeling with [35S]met/cys, we found higher levels of
immature and mature APP during the chase period in cells
transfected with p23 siRNA (Fig. 2D). These data suggest
that nascent core-glycosylated APP polypeptides are relatively more stable, and readily undergo complex glycosylation in cells with attenuated expression of p24
proteins. Increased maturation of APP as well as sAPP
secretion, suggested the possibility that loss of p23 expression might enhance APP trafficking to the cell surface.
Indeed, quantitative analysis revealed a 2-fold increase (p
< 0.001) in the steady-state levels of cell surface APP in
cells transfected with p23 siRNA (Fig. 2E). Next, we considered the possibility that p23 depletion and diminution
of additional p24 family proteins might cause a general
increase in cellular secretion. To test this idea, we assessed
total protein synthesis and secretion in p23 depleted cells.
SDS-PAGE analysis of detergent lysates prepared from
control and p23 siRNA transfected cells showed similar
levels of total protein synthesis following 15 min pulse
labeling or 3 h continuous labeling with [35S]met/cys (Fig.
3A). However, SDS-PAGE analysis of conditioned
medium showed decrease in the levels of several secreted
polypeptides and small increase in a few polypeptides
(Fig. 3B). Thus, depletion of p24 family members does

not affect overall protein synthesis, but causes a small
decrease in the secretory potential of the cell. On the other
hand, the results described above suggest that p23 plays a
role in negatively regulating APP maturation and trafficking, in addition to the reported role in γ-secretase processing.
Stable knockdown of p23 expression in HeLa cells
increases endogenous sAPPα secretion
The data described above were obtained from the analysis
of N2a or HeLa cells stably overexpressing FAD-linked
mutant APPswe. It is known that secretase processing of
wild type APP and APPswe are quite different with respect
to the subcellular sites of proteolysis. For example, the
presence of "Swedish" mutation renders APPswe
extremely susceptible to cleavage by β-secretase in the biosynthetic organelles such as the Golgi and TGN [29]. Furthermore, because p24 family proteins have a wellestablished role in early secretory pathway trafficking of
transport vesicles, p23 regulation of overexpressed
APPswe could markedly differ relative to endogenous
APP. To confirm increased secretion of sAPP from endogenous wild type APP, we generated HeLa cell lines stably
transfected with non-specific control or p23 shRNA plasmids. This later RNAi approach was also effective in stably
reducing expression of p23 in independent clones (Fig.
4A). By assaying conditioned media we found that each of
the p23 knockdown clones displayed a significant
increase in the secretion of endogenous sAPPα relative to
clones transfected with the non-specific shRNA plasmid,

while the steady-state levels of full-length APP (APP FL)
remained unchanged by stable attenuation of p23 expression (Fig. 4A).
To address whether p23 knockdown influences cell-free
generation of Aβ in HeLa cell membranes, we incubated
C100FLAG substrate with membranes prepared from control and p23 knockdown clones using a well-established
in vitro assay [30]. To demonstrate the specificity in these
assays, one set of each sample was incubated in parallel
with the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 to inhibit Aβ production. By ELISA analysis, we found that membrane
preparations from p23 knockdown clones generated
about 50% more Aβ40 relative to membranes from control
clones (Fig. 4B). We then asked whether p23 is incorporated into active γ-secretase complexes. To this end, we
used Merck C, a specific biotinylated transition-state γsecretase inhibitor that is capable of capturing active γsecretase complexes from membrane preparations [31].
Interestingly, we found that the γ-secretase protein complexes captured from CHAPSO solubilized HeLa cell
membranes contained readily detectable levels of PS1
NTF, but not p23 (Fig. 4E). As expected, we also detected
PS1 CTF and nicastrin in γ-secretase complexes isolated
using Merck C (data not shown). Moreover, addition of
excess transition-state analog inhibitor L-685,458 prevented the capture, confirming selective isolation of active
γ-secretase complexes by Merck C (Fig. 4E). These results
indicate that p23 is not present at 1:1 stoichiometry with
PS1 as a stable component of active γ-secretase complexes.

Additive5effects of p23 depletion and FAD-linked PS1 mutation on APP metabolism
Additive effects of p23 depletion and FAD-linked PS1 mutation on APP metabolism. A, Lysates of N2aSwe cells
stably expressing wt PS1 or C410Y mutant were probed with antibodies specific for p23, APP, γ-secretase components, and
calnexin. B and C, Quantitative analysis of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the media conditioned by wt and C410Y cell lines was performed using two-site ELISAs. The data represent mean ± SEM of three transfections. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
Nevertheless, knockdown of p23 expression can influence
in vitro Aβ production in a cell-free assay using an exogenous APP substrate and membrane preparations from
HeLa (our results) or HEK293 cells [8], consistent with
modulation of Aβ production by transient interaction of
p23 with the mature γ-secretase complex.
Role of p23 in PS1 FAD mutation-associated selective
increase of Aβ42 secretion
FAD-linked mutations in PS1 and PS2 selectively elevate
the levels of Aβ42 peptides by mechanism(s) that is still
not clearly understood [32]. In contrast to FAD-linked
mutations, knockdown of p23 expression affected multiple aspects of APP metabolism including biosynthetic stabilization of nascent APP and increased secretion of sAPP,
Aβ40 and Aβ42 as described above. Therefore, we predicted
that p23 modulation of Aβ42 production might be indirect, and distinct from the mechanism associated with
selective FAD-linked PS1 mutant effect on Aβ42 generation. To test this idea, we performed p23 siRNA knockdown studies in N2aSwe derivatives co-expressing APPswe
and either wt PS1 or a FAD-linked PS1 variant (C410Y)
(Fig. 5A). Knockdown of p23 expression in cells overexpressing either wt or FAD-linked mutant PS1 had no effect
on the levels of secreted Aβ40 peptides (Fig. 5B). The
implication of this finding is not readily apparent, but
might be the result of potential interaction between excess
holoPS1 present in these cells. Nevertheless, wt PS1 cells
transfected with p23 siRNA secreted significantly higher
levels of Aβ42 relative to cells transfected with non-specific

siRNA (0.19 ng/ml in NS siRNA cells versus 0.30 ng/ml in
p23 siRNA cells; p < 0.05) (Fig. 5C). As expected, the
C410Y PS1 cells used in these experiments secrete 2-fold
higher levels of Aβ42 relative to wt PS1 cells (0.19 ng/ml wt
PS1 cells versus 0.41 ng/ml C410Y cells; p < 0.05), but
secrete comparable levels of Aβ40 (Fig. 5B and 5C). Moreover, cells expressing C410Y PS1 secreted even higher levels of Aβ42 following transfection with p23 siRNA (0.41
ng/ml in NS siRNA cells versus 0.74 ng/ml in p23 siRNA
cells; p < 0.001) (Fig. 5C). These data imply that p23
depletion has little influence on Aβ40 production in the
presence of excess PS1 polypeptides. Furthermore, presence of FAD-linked PS1 mutation and p23 knockdown
have additive effects on Aβ42 production, consistent with
independent regulation of Aβ42 production by these two
factors.
Influence of p23 knockdown on the localization of APP
and Mint3
How might p23 function affect sAPP secretion? p23 is an
abundant protein in cis-Golgi and ERGIC membranes,
and plays an important role in biosynthetic protein transport [22]. Despite earlier evidence that suggested a cargo
receptor function for p24 family members [33], endogenous p23 does not readily co-immunoprecipitate with or
cross-link to APP in N2aSwe cells, formally excluding the
possibility that p23 modulates APP trafficking by direct
protein interaction (data not shown). We then turned our
attention to potential indirect mechanism(s) that might
account for the observed redistribution of APP in cells

Model depicting the dual role of p23 in APP trafficking and
Model depicting the dual role of p23 in APP trafficking and processing. Our results suggest that p23 has dual
roles in the negative regulation of APP metabolism. First, the
function of p23/p24 family proteins in early secretory trafficking of proteins at the ER-Golgi boundary influences APP
biogenesis in a manner that stabilizes nascent APP, as well as
enhances APP maturation and steady-state accumulation at
the cell surface. Second, p23 can modulate Aβ production by
influencing the proteolysis of APP CTF by modulation of γsecretase. Cells transfected with p23 siRNA secrete
increased levels of Aβ. Moreover, absence of p23 expression
also results in increased Aβ generated by proteolysis of
recombinant APP CTF substrate in cell free assays, providing
strong support for the notion that this latter function occurs
independent of vesicular trafficking.

transfected with p23 siRNA. Cytosolic adaptors such as
members of Munc18-interacting protein (Mint) [also
referred to as X11], Fe65, Dab, and JIP family of proteins
regulate Aβ production by influencing APP trafficking and
γ-secretase processing [34]. Mint3 (X11γ), the ubiquitously expressed Mint family member, is particularly
interesting because it binds to ARF1, localizes to the Golgi,
and can function as coat proteins to regulate APP trafficking [35]. Therefore, we asked whether p23 might influence APP trafficking by affecting Mint3 function. First, we
visualized the distribution endogenous Mint3 and APP in
N2a cells by immunofluorescence labeling. Consistent
with previous descriptions, Mint3 and APP were concentrated in a juxtanuclear location, and showed considerable overlap with COPI coatomer subunit β-COP and the
Golgi marker giantin (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, when N2a
cells were disrupted without the use of detergents using a
ball-bearing homogenizer and fractionated through a
sucrose step gradient to separate organelles based on their
density, we found co-fractionation of APP, Mint3 and p23
with membranes enriched in Golgi, TGN and ER makers

http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/2/1/4

(Fig. 6B). Note that Mint3 found in fractions 1–3 represents Mint3 associated with light-density vesicles,
cytosolic Mint3, and Mint3 that had detached from Golgi
membranes during cell lysis. The relative distribution of
APP and Mint3 in sucrose density gradients was not markedly altered by p23 depletion. To obtain direct evidence
for co-residence of APP, Mint3 and p23, we carried out
antibody-mediated immunoisolation of APP containing
vesicles and membrane organelles using magnetic beads
coated with mAb 9E10 (which reacts with the C-terminal
c-myc epitope tag of APPswe). Subsequent Western blot
analysis revealed the presence of endogenous Mint3 and
p23, supporting the notion that APP, Mint3 and p23 coreside in early secretory compartments (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, p23 depletion caused marked diminution in the coresidence of Mint3 in membranes immunoisolated using
magnetic beads coated with mAb 9E10 (Fig. 6D). These
results show that p23 function likely influences co-residence of APP and its adaptor Mint3, providing a plausible
mechanism by which p23 can affect APP trafficking and
sAPP secretion independently of a direct APP-p23 interaction.

Discussion
The main finding of our work is that p23/TMP21, and
likely p24 family proteins, regulate APP biosynthesis and
trafficking. siRNA knockdown of p23 expression
enhances biosynthetic stability of nascent APP, and leads
to enhanced maturation and cell surface accumulation of
APP. Moreover, our study confirms that p23 can modulate
Aβ production as recently reported [8], and documents
that p23 modulation of Aβ42 production is independent
of FAD mutant PS1-associated increase in γ-secretase
cleavage of APP at the Aβ42 site. The efficiency of Aβ production is determined by multiple cellular events that
control the trafficking and sequential proteolytic processing of APP. Despite remarkable progress on the characterization of APP secretases, the mechanisms that modulate
cell surface transport of APP, especially during transit of
nascent APP polypeptides through early secretory compartments, are not well understood. Because Aβ is mainly
generated in late secretory and endocytic compartments
[36], positive or negative control of biosynthetic APP
transport in the ER and Golgi could significantly impact
on the efficiency of amyloidogenic processing. Based on
previous findings and our analysis of APP metabolism in
p23-depleted cells reported here, we suggest that p23 has
dual roles in the regulation of APP metabolism: modulation of γ-secretase processing of APP CTF [8]; and regulation of APP biogenesis and trafficking of APP holoprotein,
which can further influence Aβ production (Fig. 7).

COPI and COPII coatomer components, recruitment of
ARF1 to Golgi membrane, Golgi organization, de novo formation of vesicular tubular clusters, generation of ER exit
sites, and the formation of tubular transport intermediates [13,14,17,20,24,27,37]. Deletion of yeast p24
ortholog EMP24 impaired retention of Kar2p/BiP, indicative of defects in Golgi to ER retrieval [21]. Moreover, partial defects in Golgi maturation of Gas1p (a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored plasma membrane protein) and secretion of invertase (a soluble protein that is
secreted into the periplasmic space) in yeast p24 deletion
mutants led to the suggestion that p24 proteins regulate
cargo entry into COPII vesicles [19,21]. Nevertheless,
secretion of carboxypeptidase Y and pro α-factor were
unaffected in yeast lacking all p24 proteins, arguing
against an essential role in vesicular transport in the exocytic pathway [19]. Consistent with this idea, our
[35S]met/cys labeling studies reveal only minor decrease
in overall protein biogenesis or secretion in N2a cells
upon p23 knockdown.
Based on p23 antibody-mediated inhibition of vesicular
stomatitis virus G protein trafficking, it was proposed that
p23 plays an obligatory role in forward biosynthetic transport of transmembrane proteins in mammalian cells [22].
In contrast, loss of SEL-9 (p24 ortholog) function in C. elegans increased cell surface trafficking of mutant but not wt
GLP-1 (Notch homolog). Our data demonstrate
enhanced APP maturation and cell surface accumulation
in cells transfected with p23 siRNA. Moreover, we find an
increase in the secretion of endogenous wt APP as well as
stably overexpressed FAD-associated mutant APPswe following attenuation of p24 family protein expression.
These findings are consistent with improved biosynthetic
transport of APP to the cell surface in the absence of p23/
p24 family function. In this regard, it is notable that PS1
deficiency also results in enhanced release of APP-containing vesicles from the ER and TGN, leading to increased
maturation and cell surface accumulation of APP [39].
Considering that packaging of APP and PS1 into COPII
vesicles during ER export is uncoupled [38], it is highly
likely that p23 depletion affects APP FL trafficking and
PS1-dependent γ-secretase activity via distinct mechanisms. In agreement, we find that expression of FADlinked mutant PS1 and depletion of p24 proteins have
additive effects on Aβ42 production. One plausible mechanistic explanation for our results is that p23 function
restricts biosynthetic trafficking of APP; p23-dependent
APP retention/retrieval mechanisms operating in the continuum of bidirectional transport between the ER and
Golgi are compromised upon p23 knockdown, allowing
enhanced transit of nascent APP from the ER/Golgi
through the exocytic pathway. Thus, our study provides
the important insight that p23 functions in both positive
and negative regulation of transmembrane cargo trans-

http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/2/1/4

port in the early secretory pathway. Elucidating the precise
function of p23 in controlling the fidelity of APP trafficking remains a challenge because overexpression of p23
leads to retention of exogenous and endogenous p24 proteins in the ER, causing experimental artifacts (data not
shown) [10,24].
Several cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding
domains, including Mint family proteins, Fe65 family
members, and Dab1 bind to the APP cytoplasmic tail at or
near the YENPTY motif, and regulate APP trafficking and
processing [34]. Mint proteins can directly bind to ARFs in
a GTP-dependent manner, and siRNA knockdown of
Mint3 resulted in diffuse localization of APP throughout
the cell and concomitant decrease in juxtanuclear Golgi
concentration [35]. Thus it was postulated that Mints
might serve as coat proteins in regulating vesicular trafficking of APP. We find that endogenous Mint3 localizes
to the Golgi apparatus and shows colocalization with p23,
β-COP and giantin. Depletion of p23 markedly reduced
juxtanuclear concentration of Mint3 and membrane colocalization of APP and Mint3 evidenced by immunofluorescence and magnetic immunoisolation analyses (Fig. 6
and data not shown). Together, these results raise the
intriguing possibility that Mint proteins may functionally
link p23 to APP cargo and influence it's trafficking. Since
Mints are recruited to the Golgi membrane by interaction
with ARFs [35], and recruitment of ARF1 to the Golgi is
mediated by p23 [17], it is reasonable to hypothesize that
p23 influence on Mint3 localization may involve ARFs.
This prediction awaits direct experimental confirmation.
Molecular characterization of functional interactions
between p23/ARF/Mint/APP is a focus of our future investigation. Finally, it is interesting to note that while the
phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Mint proteins bind
to APP cytosolic tail, the PDZ domains of Mint also bind
to the C-terminus of PS1. Thus, functional interaction
between p23/Mint/PS1 may be critically involved in the
regulation of APP trafficking as well as γ-secretase processing.

Methods
Plasmids, oligonucleotides, and antibodies
Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to three
p23 target sequences separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) were synthesized
and cloned into a modified pSUPER plasmid [40]. One of
the three siRNAs directed against a conserved sequence 5'ATACCTGACCAACTCGTGA
(nt
416–434
of
NM_006827) present in human and mouse p23 mRNA,
was identified as the most efficient by Western blotting
and used for subsequent experiments. Synthetic siRNA
duplexes against the above sequence were purchased from
Dharmacon. A non-specific control siRNA was designed
against the sequence CTGCAGAGCTCGACCACTC [41].

Molecular Neurodegeneration 2007, 2:4

The non-specific control shRNA plasmid was generated
using oligonucleotides targeted to green fluorescence protein sequence.
Polyclonal p23 antisera were generated against a synthetic
peptide ISFHLPVNSRKCLREEIHKDLLVTGA, corresponding to the N-terminal luminal residues 32–57 of mouse
p23. Polyclonal Ab R8666 was raised against a synthetic
peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 13 amino acids
of APP and affinity purified. mAb B436 reacts with the
amino-terminal region of Aβ and also recognizes sAPPα.
mAb B113 and A387 were raised against Aβ sequences
and are selective for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively. Antibodies against γ-secretase components [42], and p24 family
proteins p24, p25, and tp24 have been described [12].
APP C-terminal Ab 369 was provided by Drs. Sam Gandy
(Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Philadelphia) and
Huaxi Xu (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla). Polyclonal
GRASP55 antiserum was a gift of Vivek Malhotra (University of California, San Diego). The following antibodies
were purchased from commercial sources: mAb P2-1
against APP N-terminus (Biosource), mAb 5228 (Chemicon), calnexin (Stressgen), β-COP (Affinity Bioreagents,
Inc.), giantin (Covance), p115 and Mint3 (BD Biosciences), OKT8 and 9E10 (ATCC).
Cell culture
Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cell lines expressing human
APP695SWE and human PS1 have been previously
described [29,43]. HeLa/APPSWEDISH cells were provided
by Gang Yu (UT Southwestern, Dallas) [44]. HeLa cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM Lglutamine (Invitrogen). N2a cells were maintained in the
medium above mixed 1:1 with OptiMEM (Invitrogen).
For transient p23 knockdown, cells were transfected twice
with 200 or 300 nM p23 siRNA in 60 mm dishes and
experiments were performed 72 h later. HeLa cells were
stably transfected with pSUPERp23neo and the efficacy of
p23 depletion in individual clones was determined by
Western blot analysis.
Protein analyses
Total cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared in IP
buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium
dexoycholate, 0.5% NP40, 0.25% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.25
mM PMSF, and supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail [Sigma]). Metabolic labeling using [35S]met/cys
and APP immunoprecipitation were performed as
described [29]. APP was immunoprecipitated from lysates
and conditioned media using Ab 369 and mAb P2-1,
respectively. Total protein synthesis and secretion were
determined by using trichloroacetic acid precipitation
combined with scintillation counting or by SDS/PAGE
combined with phosphorimager detection. To measure

http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/2/1/4

cell surface APP, live cells were washed in cold HEPES
buffer and blocked in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% BSA
for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then incubated at 10°C with
mAb P2-1 for 90 min. After washing, cells were incubated
for 3 h at 4°C with 1 μCi/ml 125I-conjuated anti-mouse
secondary Ab (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive
washes, cells were lysed in IP buffer and Ab binding was
quantified by γ-counting. Non-specific binding was determined by omitting primary Ab, and specific binding was
normalized to total protein concentration determined by
BCA assay.
Aβ and sAPPα measurements
Fresh medium was added to cells 24 h after transfection
with siRNA and conditioned media were collected at 48 h.
The levels of secreted Aβ40, Aβ42, and sAPPα were quantified using specific sandwich ELISAs. Briefly, 96-well white
ELISA plates were coated with the appropriate capture
mAb (B113 for Aβ40, A387 for Aβ42, and 5228 for sAPPα).
Following sample incubation for all three ELISAs, plates
were washed and Aβ40, Aβ42 or sAPPα were detected with
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mAb B436 and CSPDSapphire II Luminescence Substrate (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was assayed in duplicate using appropriate dilution of the conditioned media so that the
relative luminescent units were in the linear range of the
standards included on each plate. For Aβ quantifications
synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were diluted in culture
medium to generate standard curve. sAPPα sample relative luminescence unit values were compared to a standard curve prepared from affinity-purified sAPPα. Briefly,
conditioned medium from cells expressing human wildtype APP751 was collected and passed over an affinity column linked with a mAb that recognized sAPPα but not
sAPPβ. Fractions were eluted with low pH and neutralized. A pooled sample containing the sAPPα peak was
quantified by a protein assay and utilized for the sAPPα
standard curve.
In vitro γ-secretase assays
Cell-free assays using C100FLAG substrate were performed essentially as described [30] using membranes
prepared from non-specific control and p23 knockdown
clones. Merck C, a highly specific biotinylated γ-secretase
inhibitor [31], was used for affinity isolation of γ-secretase. The CHAPSO solubilized HeLa S3 membranes were
incubated with 10 nM of Merck C for 2 h at 37°C in the
absence or presence of 2 μM L-685,458. The samples were
then incubated with streptavidin beads to capture inhibitor-bound γ-secretase complexes as previously described
[31]. Bound proteins were released by incubating in SDSsample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.

Subcellular fractionation studies
Confluent cells from nine 60 mm dishes were homogenized using ball-bearing homogenizer with a 12 μm clearance and postnuclear supernatants were fractionated on
sucrose density gradients essentially as described previously [42]. Twelve 1 ml fractions were collected from the
top of the gradient using a fractionator and 60 μl of each
fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoisolation of APP containing vesicles using magnetic beads
coated with mAb 9E10 was performed essentially as
described [42]. Antibody OKT8 was used as the negative
control to establish the specificity of the immunoisolation
procedure.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells cultured on poly-lysine coated coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence analysis as previously
described [42]. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS
containing 3% BSA and 0.2% Tween-20 and added to
fixed cells at room temperature for 2 h. Images were
acquired as 200 nm z-stacks on a motorized Nikon
TE2000 microscope with Cascade II:512 CCD camera
(Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using 100× 1.45 NA PlanApochromat oil objective. Images were deconvolved
using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging BV,
The Netherlands) and processed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corporation, Downingtown,
PA).
