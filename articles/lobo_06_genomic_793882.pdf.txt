Abstract
Background: To have an insight into the Mayetiola destructor (Hessian fly) genome, we performed
an in silico comparative genomic analysis utilizing genetic mapping, genomic sequence and EST
sequence data along with data available from public databases.
Results: Chromosome walking and FISH were utilized to identify a contig of 50 BAC clones near
the telomere of the short arm of Hessian fly chromosome X2 and near the avirulence gene vH13.
These clones enabled us to correlate physical and genetic distance in this region of the Hessian fly
genome. Sequence data from these BAC ends encompassing a 760 kb region, and a fully sequenced
and assembled 42.6 kb BAC clone, was utilized to perform a comparative genomic study. In silico
gene prediction combined with BLAST analyses was used to determine putative orthology to the
sequenced dipteran genomes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the malaria mosquito,
Anopheles gambiae, and to infer evolutionary relationships.
Conclusion: This initial effort enables us to advance our understanding of the structure,
composition and evolution of the genome of this important agricultural pest and is an invaluable
tool for a whole genome sequencing effort.

Background
The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is an important
insect pest of wheat (Triticum spp.). As a member of the
gall midge family (Cecidomyiidae) it belongs to the dipteran suborder Nematocera, which also includes mosquitoes, midges, black flies and fungus gnats. Widespread
outbreaks of the Hessian fly occur at irregular intervals in
many parts of the world [1]. In the United States local outbreaks cause extensive losses nearly every year. The status

of the Hessian fly as an agricultural pest, its behavior and
its evolutionary relationship to other insects make it an
excellent candidate for genome sequencing.
The complexity of the Hessian fly genome is manifested
by the presence of two distinct classes of chromosome: E
chromosomes and S chromosomes [2]. The E chromosomes vary from 32 to 45 in number, and are germ line
limited. The composition of these chromosomes is still

unknown. It has been hypothesized that they function to
provide additional copies of genes required for oocyte and
embryonic development [3]. It has also been suggested
that they are largely composed of parasitic DNA adapted
to the Hessian fly's post-zygotic mechanism of establishing X chromosome number, as described below [4]. The S
chromosomes compose the more conventional portion of
the Hessian fly genome and are present in both the germ
line and the soma. They consist of two autosomes (A1 and
A2) and two X chromosomes (X1 and X2). The S chromosomes contain the genes that are necessary for the housekeeping and specialized functions associated with each
somatic cell type, including the avirulence (Avr) genes and
other genes that are important in the insect's interactions
with wheat. A haploid complement of S chromosomes
consists of approximately 160 Mb of DNA [5]. The X chromosomes compose approximately 46% of the S genome.
A preliminary understanding of the composition and
structure of the S genome would be imperative for a whole
genome sequencing effort.
Chromosome imprinting and chromosome elimination
are both involved in the anomalous behavior of the Hessian fly genome [4,6]. All Hessian fly zygotes begin life
with a diploid set of S chromosomes and a complement
of E chromosomes. Chromosome imprinting is evident as
the E chromosomes and the paternally derived S chromosomes are eliminated from the primary spermatocytes
during spermatogenesis. There is no genetic recombination in males. Thus, every spermatoctye contains only the
maternally derived set of S chromosomes. Chromosome
imprinting is also evident when the male and female
somatic karyotypes are established. During the fifth
nuclear division of the embryo, the E chromosomes are
eliminated from all presumptive somatic nuclei [7]. A
male somatic karyotype (A1 A2 X1 X2/A1 A2 O O) is
established if the paternally derived X1 and X2 chromosomes are eliminated from the presumptive somatic
nuclei along with the E chromosomes. A female somatic
karyotype (A1 A2 X1 X2/A1 A2 X1 X2) is established if the
paternally derived X chromosomes are maintained in the
presumptive somatic nuclei when the E chromosomes are
eliminated. X-chromosome elimination is controlled by
maternal genotype. Thus, most female Hessian flies produce families that are either all female or all male.
Wheat breeders and wheat geneticists have worked for
decades to discover and incorporate cultivar-specific Hessian fly resistance genes into wheat in an effort to manage
this pest [8]. Unfortunately, their many successes have
been limited by the evolution of Hessian fly genotypes
that are unaffected by those resistance genes. By investigating the genetics of this problem [9] and by virtue of its
similarity to the genetics of certain obligate bacterial and
fungal plant pathogens [10-12], the following working

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/7

hypothesis has emerged [13]: Hessian fly and wheat have
a gene-for-gene relationship whereby loss-of-function
mutations in certain Hessian fly genes (broadly called
avirulence or Avr genes) enable the flies to overcome the
resistance conferred by specific alleles of a corresponding
set of genes (broadly called resistance or R genes) in
wheat. For example, mutations in the Avr gene vH13 permit the survival of larvae feeding on wheat genotypes carrying the R allele H13. Hessian fly larvae lacking those
mutations die as they attempt to feed on the same wheat
genotypes. At least 31 R genes have been discovered in
wheat [14]. Avr genes corresponding to 5 of these R genes
have been genetically mapped in the Hessian fly genome
[5,15]. Although neither R genes in wheat nor Avr genes
in the Hessian fly have been cloned, genetic analysis suggests that the wheat genes for Hessian fly resistance
encode receptors that interact, alone or in concert with
other factors, with the products of the Hessian fly Avr
genes. This interaction elicits a biochemical cascade that
results in plant resistance and the death of Hessian fly larvae attempting to feed on the plant. Recessive mutations
in the Avr genes appear to enable the insect to avoid detection by the plant. This leads to larval survival and plant
damage on plants that would otherwise be resistant to
Hessian fly attack. The evolutionary and functional characterization of important Hessian fly genes, such as Avr
genes, would include an understanding of their functional
and evolutionary relationships to homologues in
sequenced genomes.
We discovered markers sufficiently close to vH13 to
attempt chromosome walking for the purpose of cloning,
for the first time, an Avr gene from an insect [15]. Two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries were constructed and walking began in both directions from the
most tightly linked DNA marker (22–124). Though the
libraries lacked clones containing segments of the genome
between vH13 and 22–124, we generated a contig of
approximately 1 Mb in the opposite direction. Our objectives in the present study were to better understand the
molecular structure and composition of this genome
using the sequence information garnered. We correlate
physical and genetic distance in this region of the Hessian
fly genome, and evaluate this segment of DNA for structural and genetic similarities to the sequenced dipteran
genomes of the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, and the malaria
mosquito, A. gambiae. This serves as an effective platform
towards a whole genome sequencing effort as well as enables an understanding of the functional and evolutionary
relationships between these 3 Dipterans.

Chromosome walking was initiated by screening the BAC
libraries with STS marker EAC/MCAC-124 (hereafter

Contig 124-right chromosome walk. (A) Chromosome walking was initiated at STS marker 124 and proceeded 13 steps to the
right in reference to the Hessian fly genetic map near avirulence gene vH13 shown as a thick black horizontal line. Vertical lines
indicate the genetic positions of Avr gene vH13 and five previously mapped STS markers (134, 124, 185, 233, and 291; Rider et
al. 2002) along the genetic map. A sixth marker (593), developed from the end sequence of Mde47o23-SP6, co-segregated with
STS 291 in the same mapping population. Units shown below the genetic map are Kosambi centiMorgans (cM). Horizontal
green and red lines shown below the genetic map represent BAC clones in the 124-right contig. The line colors correspond to
the color the clones fluoresced in Fiber-FISH experiments (B-J). The scale (in kb) shown below these lines indicates the
approximate length of each of these clones in the contig. The length of each clone and its overlap with flanking clones was
determined by these experiments. Horizontal black lines shown above the BAC clones in the contig indicate the approximate
positions of the STS markers in the contig. (B-J) The fluorescence observed at the intersection of adjacent BAC clones (shown

referred to as 22–124, Fig. 1). Three clones were identified
in the Mde library and none in the Hf library. A chromosome walk then proceeded in one direction while walking
in the opposite direction was prevented by an absence of
clones in both libraries (Fig. 1). In the direction in which
walking was possible, 13 steps were taken, identifying an
average of 3.8 ± 2 clones per step and a total of 50 BAC
clones. FISH was performed after each step to confirm that
the clones were located on the short arm of chromosome
X2 (Fig. 2). To determine the orientation and relative

lengths of overlapping BAC clones in the walk, a PCRbased method was used. This method utilized oligonucleotides designed after the sequences of BAC-end fragments
as primers (described below) and BAC clone DNA as template. Fiber FISH experiments were performed to determine if the walk resulted in a single contig of Hessian fly
genomic DNA (Fig. 1). BAC clones representing each step
in the walk were used as probes in these experiments.
They conclusively demonstrated that a single contig was
identified. They were further used to estimate the lengths

clone as template and with the primers of each marker
(data not shown). The relative positions of the STS markers in the contig were determined with these data (Fig. 1).
This analysis clearly showed that the contig extended in
the direction away from vH13, and that the relative positions of the STS markers on the genetic map corresponded
with their relative physical positions in the contig. The
lengths of the BAC clones that contained each STS marker
and the overlap of those clones with adjacent clones in the
contig were used to determine the limits of the STS marker
positions (in kb) in the contig (Fig. 1). These limits were
then used to determine the minimal and maximal distances between each pair of STS markers in the contig
(Table 2). These values were then used to estimate the
physical distance between each pair of markers. These values generally fell below 10 cM/Mb, but ranged from 7.6 to
an unusually high 22 cM/Mb.

of the 13 clones and their overlap in the contig (Table 1).
The Fiber-FISH determined BAC lengths were slightly
greater (1.9%) than those made by CHEF gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The entire contig had an estimated length of 760 kb.

BAC clone Mde8i18
To obtain sequence for a genomic analysis of the contig, a
relatively small BAC clone within the contig was selected
for sequencing. Sequences generated from the selected
clone, Mde8i18, clone were assembled into a 42,642 bp
contig [GenBank: DQ208194] (Fig. 3). This contig has a
minimum of 5× coverage (in both directions) and > 20×
sequencing coverage on average. Mde8i18 had a G+C content of 31.5%. The assembled sequence had 24 simple
repeats (di and tri and tetra-nucleotide). No transposon
sequences were found in this genomic segment.

The orientation of the contig with respect to the genetic
map was determined using STS markers developed and
positioned on the genetic map in a previous investigation
[15], and a new marker developed from the DNA
sequence at the SP6 end of BAC clone Mde47o23. The
BAC clones containing each of these markers were identified in separate PCR experiments that used each BAC

Six putative coding regions (Mde8i18.1-6, see Additional
file 1) were found following exon prediction (Genscan
1.0) and database searches. A similarity-based search of a
Hessian Fly Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database identified an EST (LG2D1) that corresponded to predicted
peptide Mde8i18_3. There were 6 predicted transcripts
(Mde8i18_1-6, see Additional file 1) in this sequence (Fig.

3). Predicted transcripts were compared to nucleotide and
protein databases for putative functional assignment.
Putative peptides Mde8i18_1 and Mde8i18_6 were partial
predictions and were at either end of the BAC clone (Fig.
3), and did not demonstrate similarity to proteins in the
database. Predictions Mde8i18_4 and Mde8i18_6 had no
identifiable protein domains. Three other predictions had
significant hits to proteins in the Anopheles and Drosophila
genomes. The Anopheles and Drosophila sequences with the
greatest similarity to Mde8i18_2 and Mde8i8_5 were
orthologs of each other [16]. Mde8i18_2 (Md_GCN2) was
similar to the Drosophila GCN2 gene (dGCN2, CG1609)
and to its Anopheles ortholog – XM_320188. Mde8i18_5
belongs to the Vinculin family of proteins and its putative
ortholog was the A. gambiae alpha-catenin-related gene

(XP_309552) and the D. melanogaster CG2987 gene. This
Hessian fly sequence had two hits in both the Drosophila
and Anopheles genome with putative orthologs having a
significantly better E value. The Anopheles and Drosophila
genes were orthologs of each other while the second hits
in each genome were orthologs as well. To verify the
results, the phylogenetic analysis included the Human
orthologs of these genes as well as the Anopheles white gene
as an outgroup (Figure 4, see Additional file 2).
Mde8i18_3 had Leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and possessed
significant similarity to the Toll family of proteins. This
sequence was almost identical to a Hessian fly EST,
LG2D1 (MSC).

Phylogenetic tree analysis of Mde8i18-5 orthologs
Figure 4
Phylogenetic tree analysis of Mde8i18-5 orthologs. The dendrogram was constructed using the sequences that fit the criteria
for ortholog determination. There were 2 members of this gene family in the Anopheles and Drosophila genome
(ENSANGP00000022276 and ENSANGP00000000768, and CG2987 and CG17947 respectively). CG2987 had 2 associated
transcripts (RA and RB). Human orthologs of the proteins (CTNNAL1 and CTNNAL2) were included to verify orthology predictions. The A. gambiae white gene is the outgroup. Md8i18_5 was most similar to the predicted Anopheles ortholog, and then
to the Drosophila ortholog followed by the human ortholog. The second member of this gene family grouped separately verifying that the most likely Anopheles and Drosophila genes.
BAC clone end sequences (BES)
To obtain additional sequence with which to make further
comparisons, the end sequences of 40 BAC clones in the
contig were determined. This effort resulted in 62 high
quality BAC end sequences (BES) [GenBank: DU135285DU135346] with an average length of 647 bp after vector
removal and end-trimming. Sequencing failures were
attributed to low BAC DNA yield. Some BESs were found
to overlap with each other and the fully sequenced
Mde8i18 sequence. These overlaps served to anchor the
ends of these BACs. All other BESs represent 41,241 bp of
non-overlapping unique sequence contained within the
contig. This value is ~81 Kb when Mde8i18 BAC sequence
is included representing approximately 10% of the entire
contig. These sequences have an overall G+C% of 32%,
approximately the same as that seen for the Mde8i18
sequence.

Hessian fly putative ortholog determination was based on
similarity of protein sequence. Orthologs are genes in different species that have evolved from a common ancestral
gene by speciation and usually retain the same function.
Identification of orthologs is critical for reliable predic-

tion of gene function in newly sequenced genomes. To
minimize the level of false positives, putative orthologs
had to meet a strict set of requirements (see Methods,
Table 3). Eleven BES had significant similarity (BLASTX
and TBLASTN) to proteins in the Anopheles and Drosophila
genomes (Table 3, Fig. 4). With the exception of
Mde8i18_4 (LRR protein) and Mde8i18_3, all TBLASTN
searches recovered only 1 significant hit in each genome.
There were 5 sequences that had similarity to genes that
belonged to single gene families in both the Anopheles and
Drosophila genomes (Table 3). These Hessian fly
sequences included BESs Mde29L21_SP6, Mde5j15_Sp6,
Mde1502_T7, Mde33n3_T7 and Hf15a13_T7. Six BESs
belonged to multi-gene families in either or both of the
other Dipteran genomes. Putative orthologs could not be
postulated when there was more than one gene family
member in both the Anopheles and Drosophila genomes.
However, in some cases, like BES Hf3a11_T7, the Drosophila ortholog (gprs, CG18471) belonged to a single
gene-family while there were 2 genes in the family in
Anopheles. A putative ortholog was postulated as only one
of these Anopheles genes (XM_320284) was already determined by Ensembl to be the ortholog of the Drosophila

gene. In addition, the Hessian fly sequence had significantly high similarity (BLASTX and TBLASTN) to only this
Anopheles gene. Putative orthologs were also determined
for BESs Hf10f11_T7, Hf4F24_SP6, Mde29L21_T7 and
Mde36j2_SP6 (Table 3). Mde36j2_T7 overlapped with the
LRR family protein, Mde8i18_3.

Discussion
An in silico comparative genomic analysis was performed
utilizing Hessian fly genetic mapping, genomic sequence
and EST sequence data along with data available from
public databases. We assembled a 760 kb region on the
short arm of chromosome X2 and related physical distance to genetic distance. We sequenced, assembled and
analyzed a 42.6 kb BAC clone (Mde8i18) from the Hessian
fly (Fig. 1). This sequence data was supplemented with 62
BESs, contained within the contig and encompassing the
Mde8i18 BAC clone, to perform a comparative genomic
study. Exon prediction combined with BLASTX and
TBLASTN analyses revealed significant similarities to the
A. gambiae and D. melanogaster genomes (Fig 2). Mosquito
and fly putative orthologs were determined for 6 of 11
sequences that demonstrated similarity (Table 1). The
higher similarity of the Hessian fly sequences (based on
BLAST values) to the Anopheles putative orthologs indi-

cated that the Hessian fly is closer related to A. gambiae
than D. melanogaster.
High-resolution physical mapping of DNA by in situ
hybridization (Fiber-FISH) is a well established method
of physical genome mapping that has been used with
mammals, yeast, cloned fragments, and plants [18-23].
The ratio of genetic to physical distance (determined by
this method), indicates an unusually high recombination
rate (~10 cM/Mb) in this region. Though the recombination rate is not constant across a particular genome, it
averages at about 1.5 cM/Mb in both Drosophila and
humans [24]. Recombination rates that are unusually
high are seen in insects like the honeybee, which demonstrate genome wide recombination rates as high as 19 cM/
Mb [25]. To confirm the Fiber-FISH determined physical
distances and hence the high recombination rate, 7 BAC
clones that were measured by Fiber FISH were also measured by CHEF gel electrophoresis. The total distance of 7
clones in the contig as measured by CHEF gel electrophoresis was 591 kb (data not shown) whereas their total
distance measured by F-FISH was 603 kb. Fiber-FISH
measurements were slightly greater (1.9%) than estimates
made by CHEF gel electrophoresis confirming the initially
measured recombination rate. This higher recombination
rate may be due to its telomeric location where recombi-

nation is usually higher [24] or to the specific nature of
this part of this genome.
The assembly of the Hessian Fly Mde8i18 BAC clone was
accomplished using highly stringent parameters [26,27]
as this was the first genomic sequence assembly effort in
this insect. The presence of a low frequency of randomly
dispersed sequence mate-pairs with inconsistencies in
either size or orientation was attributed to random error
during library generation or assembly. These sequences
were discarded, as their omission had no effect on the
assembly. The stringent measures taken ensure the accuracy of this assembly and support all ensuing predictions
and conclusions.
The G+C content of 32% observed here is comparable
with 35.2% seen in A. gambiae [28] as well as that seen in
D. melanogaster (41.1%) [29]. The 6 predicted transcripts
in this region represent a gene density of 1 gene in ~7.5 kb
indicating the presence of a higher number of genes in this
region of the Mayetiola genome than that of the Dipterans,
A. gambiae (1/11 kb) (F.H.C.) and D. melanogaster (1/13
kb) [29] in general. The observation that the Hessian fly
genome has a higher gene density, lower transposon content (none observed) and a small genome size (156.5 Mb/
haploid genome [30] fits in with the linear relationship of
genome size and transposon content [31]. The smaller
size and repeat content of this genome will facilitate the
more efficient assembly of this genome in a genome
sequencing effort.
Three of the 6 predicted peptides on this BAC clone had
no similarity to proteins in the databases. This may reflect
a portion of the transcriptome that is unique to the Hessian fly, or genes that have either diverged significantly or
have been lost from other genomes being presently studied. In addition, the complete annotation of the 2 partial
predictions may reveal sequence with similarities to
known proteins. The predicted peptide Mde8i18_3 was
found to have significant similarity to an EST sequence –
LG2D1. Though this predicted peptide had significantly
similar to the Toll family of proteins, the Toll-related EST
sequence differed slightly from the prediction. This result
validates the importance of EST projects [24,32,33] in not
just supporting but also the improvement of ab initio gene
prediction.
To compare transcriptomes and infer phylogeny, we
BLASTed Hessian fly sequences to the genomes of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster. Sequences with significant similarity were evaluated for possible orthologous
relationships. It is important to note that all orthology
inferred here is putative as the complete genome of the
Hessian fly has not been sequenced. Sequences have been
postulated as orthologs only after meeting stringent crite-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/7

ria [17]. We have combined BLASTX and TBLASTN
searches with phylogenetic analyses and linked these
results to the additional feature of using orthologous relationships between the A. gambiae and D. melanogaster
genomes to determine putative Hessian fly orthologous
sequences (See Figure 4 and Additional file 2 for an example of phylogenetic analysis). The strict criteria used here
leads us to believe that we have minimized false positives.
Hessian fly sequences exhibited varying levels of similarity to both genome. Mde8i18_5 was virtually identical to
its Anopheles ortholog (E-0.0) (Figure 4). The extent of
similarity to the Anopheles sequence points to this protein
having a conserved and important role in the two insects.
At the lower limits of detection were the Hf4f24_SP6
sequence and its similarity to the odorant binding proteins of Anopheles (OBP14) and Drosophila (Pbprp2). The
relative low similarity seen here is likely due to pheromone binding proteins being highly individual and specific
for different insect species. In addition the expansion of
odorant protein families in various insects leads us to conclude that an orthologous relationship is tentative at best
and can only be confirmed with an entire genome annotation. Differing levels of similarity between orthologs
amongst genomes would be due to varying evolutionary
selective pressures on individual sequences in specific
genomes.
Based on amino acid and phylogenetic analyses (Figure
4), Hessian fly sequences were found to demonstrate a
higher similarity to Anopheles sequences than to Drosophila
sequences. This supports the argument that the lineage
that gave rise to the Nematocera (lower Dipterans including Anopheles and Mayetiola) diverged after the Brachycera
(higher Dipterans including Drosophila) split off the
ancestral Dipteran lineage [34].
BESs have been used to build detailed comparative physical maps with mammals [35,36]. A preliminary look at
the sequences with high similarity demonstrate that there
were spread across the Drosophila and Anopheles genomes
(data not shown). Though 17% (11/64) of Hessian fly
BESs demonstrated significant amino acid similarity to
the A. gambiae and D. melanogaster genomes, realistic syntenic relationships cannot be inferred in the absence of an
entire Hessian fly genome. Previous studies have looked
at synteny seen between Dipterans [17,41,42], Anophelines [43] and Drosophilids [44]. The lack of synteny as
compared to that seen in mammalian studies [35,38,39]
suggests that even though insect genomes may contain
highly similar transcripts, evolutionary divergence may
correspond to recombination resulting in break fusion
events and the resulting translocation of chromosomal
arm segments followed by extensive paracentric inversions within the chromosome. The only genes that would

retain linear order would be those that were either tightly
linked or if their proximity was essential to their function.

Conclusion
This represents the most extensive analysis of the Hessian
fly genome to date, illustrating the importance of comparative genomic analyses to understand evolutionary and
genetic relationships. It also provides us with an understanding of the architecture of this genome thereby serving as a platform for a whole genome sequencing effort.
This study focused on a ~1 Mb genomic region on the X2
chromosome of the Hessian fly. The relationship between
physical and genetic distance revealed an unusually high
recombination rate which may be due to its location at the
telomeric end of the chromosome or may be a phenomenon specific to this particular region. Hessian fly transcripts identified possessed significant similarity to those
in the A. gambiae and D. melanogaster genomes. Putative
orthology was triangulated among all three genomes,
inferring evolutionary relationships. The higher similarity
seen between Anopheles and Mayetiola transcripts supports
their closer evolutionary relationship and suggests that
the higher Dipteran split occurred prior to the divergence
of the Hessian fly and mosquito. The variable amount of
similarity and seen between putative orthologs comments
on evolutionary pressures exerted. The low transposon
content as well as a structure not unlike sequenced
genomes demonstrates that a WGS effort for this small
genome is feasible. Such an effort would enable further
evolutionary and comparative sturdies and would allow
the characterization of Hessian fly genes such as vH13
thereby having a economic and agricultural implications.

Methods
Chromosome walking
A chromosome walk near the telomere of the short arm of
Hessian fly chromosome X2 was initiated using STS
marker EAC/MCAC-124 [15] as a probe to screen 2 Hessian fly BAC libraries (Mde and Hf) [5,45,46]. BAC clone
Mde5j15 (Fig. 1) was one of three clones identified by this
library screen. The SP6-end of this clone was used as probe
in the first step of the chromosome walk that resulted in
the contig reported here.
Hessian fly BAC library screening
The isolation of DNA probes from the ends of BAC clones
for BAC library screens are described below. Approximately 25 ng of each fragment (100 to 800 bp long) were
gel purified (QIAEX II Gel Purification Kit (QIAGEN))
and labeled in separate random priming reactions with
32-P [dATP] (Random Primer Labeling Kit (Strategene))
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nylon
filter arrays of the BAC libraries were prepared at the Purdue Genomics Center with a Qpix robot (Genetix). Nylon
filters were prepared for hybridization by incubation for 4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/7

hours at 60°C in 25 ml of hybridization solution (0.1 M
Sodium Phosphate, 20 mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 5
mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 10% Sodium Dextran Sulfate, 1
mM o-phenanthroline, 500 µg/ml Heparin Sulfate, 50 µg/
ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50 µg/ml yeast
RNA) in a hybridization oven. Denatured probe was
added to the same solution and incubated with the filters
at 60°C for 16 hours. After hybridization, the membranes
were washed (0.5% SSC solution with 0.1% SDS) and
exposed to Cyclone Storage Phosphor Screens (Packard)
for 2 hours in the dark at room temperature. Digital
images of the hybridizations were produced (Packard
Cyclone Storage Phosphor System).
Isolation of BAC-end fragments for chromosome walking
A modification of AFLP-PCR [47] was used to preferentially amplify sequences from the ends of the inserts of in
the BAC clones. To prepare DNA template for these reactions, individual BAC clones were first restriction digested
to completion with EcoRI and MseI. The resulting fragments were then ligated to either an EcoRI linker or an
MseI linker in separate reactions. The sequences of the
double stranded EcoRI, (5'-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3';
3'-CATCTGACGCATGGTTAA-5') and MseI (5'-GACGATGGAGTCCTGAG-3'; 3'-TACCTCAGGACTCATT-5') linkers were identical to those developed for AFLP-PCR. Each
DNA template was then used in four separate PCRs that
utilized different combinations of primers: 1) a primer
complementary to the EcoRI linker (GACTGCGTACCAATTC) and a primer complementary to the SP6 site
(TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG) in the BAC vector (pBeloBAC); 2) the same EcoRI primer and a primer complementary to the T7 site (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) in the
BAC vector, 3) a primer complementary to the MseI linker
(GATGAGTCCTGAGTAA) and the SP6 primer, and 4) the
MseI primer and the T7 primer. The amplification of MseIMseI and EcoRI-EcoRI fragments were less efficient than
the amplification of SP6-EcoRI, SP6-MseI, T7-EcoRI, and
T7-MseI fragments. Therefore, most reactions resulted in
the presence of a single visible amplicon corresponding to
BAC-end fragments with either an SP6 or T7 site at one
end and an EcoRI or MseI site at the other end. These were
gel purified and used as probes in library screens as
described above.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
Polytene chromosomes were isolated from the salivary
glands of second instar Hessian fly larvae and slides prepared [48]. Probes were prepared by labeling BAC clone
DNA (~1 µg) with either biotin- or digoxigenin-conjugate
dUTP (Roche) by nick translation. Hybridizations were
performed with 40–100 ng of denatured probe DNA in 10
µl of hybridization solution (10% dextran solution, 2×
SSC, 40% formaldehyde, and 20 ug of Herring sperm
DNA) at 37°C for 12 to 15 h. Detection was performed

using Alexa Fluor (Molecular Probes) conjugated antibiotin and rhodamin conjugated anti-digoxigenin. Digital
images were taken using UV optics on an ORCA-ER
(Hammamatsu) digital camera mounted on an Olympus
BX51 microscope, and MetaMorph (Universal Imaging
Corp.) imaging software.
Fiber-FISH
To prepare nuclei for Fiber-FISH, 2 ml of 2nd instar larvae
were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a
pre-cooled mortar and pestle. The powder was mixed with
10 ml chilled Nuclei Isolation Buffer (NIB, 10 mM TrisHCl pH9.5, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 4
mM spermidine, 1 mM spermine, 0.1% mercapto-ethanol) and then the solution was passed through a series of
progressively smaller nylon meshes (beginning with a
250-µm mesh and proceeding through a 149-µm, a 49µm, and finally a 20-µm mesh; Small Parts Inc., Miami
Lakes, Florida) in a chilled funnel. NIB (1 ml) containing
10% (v/v) Triton X-100 was then gently mixed into the filtrate and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 m at 4°C. The
nuclei pellet was suspended in 10 ml NIB and filtered
through 49- and 30-µm nylon meshes. The filtrate was
gently mixed with 1 ml NIB containing 10% Triton X-100,
and the solution centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 m. at 4°C.
The supernatant was decanted and the pellet resuspended
in 1 to 5 ml of a solution containing 1:1 NIB:glycerol.

To extend target DNA fibers over a glass microscope slide,
1 to 5 µl of prepared nuclei suspension was placed in 80
µl NIB. The nuclei were gently mixed into the solution
and then centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 m. The supernatant
was removed and the pellet was suspended in 2.5 µl of
phosphate buffer (PBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH
7.0; 140 mM NaCl). The suspension was then placed
across one end of a clean poly-L-lysine glass microscope
slide (Sigma-Aldrich) and allowed to air dry until the
solution appeared sticky (5 to 10 m). 8 µl of STE lysis
buffer (0.5% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.0) was
placed on top of the nuclear suspension and incubated for
4 m at room temperature. The solution was then slowly
dragged down the surface of the slide with the edge of a
clean coverslip that was held just above the slide's surface.
This preparation was then air dried for 10 m at room temperature, fixed in fresh 3:1 100% ethanol: glacial acetic
acid for 2 min, and baked at 60°C for 30 m.
The DNA probe was prepared using nick translation, and
denatured in hybridization solution as described for FISH.
Probe in hybridization solution (10 µl) was applied to
each slide, covered with a 22 × 22 mm coverslip and
sealed with rubber cement. After the cement had dried,
the slides were placed on a heated surface at 80°C for 3 m.
They were placed in a pre-warmed humid chamber in an
oven for 2 min at 80°C and then overnight at 37°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/7

Detection of biotin-labeled probes was performed using
three layers of antibodies to amplify the green signal: 1)
AF488-streptavidin, 2) biotin anti-streptavidin, and 3)
AF488-streptavidin. Detection of digoxigenin labeled
probes was performed with two layers of antibodies: 1)
mouse anti-digoxigenin, and 2) AF568 anti-mouse. Fluorescence microscopy and imaging were performed as
described for FISH.
Sequencing and analysis of the Mde8i18 BAC clone
The strategy used by Lobo et al., 2003, was employed to
sequence the Mde8i18 BAC clone (DQ208194). Two random libraries were constructed by partially digesting the
BAC clone with Sau3A1 or Tsp509 I, and cloning 2–5 kb
fragments into pLitmus28i (NEB). Two 9–12 kb partial
libraries were similarly constructed. A directional library,
constructed by cloning all completely digested EcoR1 fragments, served as a scaffold to assemble the BAC sequence.
Direct BAC sequencing was used to anchor the ends of the
sequence. Plasmids cloned from all libraries were
sequenced from both ends of the inserts with standard
M13 forward and reverse primers using ABI Big Dye Terminator v3, and reactions were analyzed on the ABI
Prism® 3700 DNA Analyzer. Sequencing data was evaluated, trimmed and assembled using SEQMAN II software
package (DNASTAR Inc.) [49]. Gaps were filled by primer
walking. The assembled sequence was analyzed for repetitive elements and transposon sequences using Repeatmasker and CENSOR [50] and was annotated with both
ab initio gene prediction and algorithms based on
sequence similarity. GENESCAN 1.0 [51], GENEID 1.1
[52]and FGENES 1.0 [53] were used with default parameters and the human training dataset. To avoid over-prediction, genes were only accepted if they were predicted by at
least two algorithms or, if they were predicted by one algorithm and were also similar to known ESTs, cDNAs, or
proteins. The similarity based methods used were
BLASTX, BLASTN and BLASTP [54] against the nr and EST
databank (NCBI) and BLASTX and TBLASTN against the
A. gambiae genome and D. melanogaster genome using the
Ensemble server. Protein domain analysis was performed
using SMART and INTERPRO. Stringency parameters were
similar to those used in Lobo et al. (2003).
BAC end sequencing
2xYT (2 ml) with 20 ul/ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with 4 ul of precultured BACs and grown for 24
hours with shaking at 37°C. BAC DNA was prepared
using the Qiagen R.E.A.L. Prep kit according to the manufacturers instruction. Dye terminator sequencing reactions
were set up using 11 ul BAC DNA solution, 2 ul BigDye
v3.1, 6 ul 5× buffer, and 7.5 pMol primer (SP6 or T7).
Thermal cycling (Applied Biosystems) was carried out at
96°C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 96°C for 30 sec,
45°C for 10 sec and 60°C for 4 min. Reactions were pre-

cipitated using 80 ul 75% isopropanol, washed using 100
ul 70% ethanol, dried, resuspended in 20 ul HiDi formamide and reactions were analyzed on the ABI Prism® 3700
DNA Analyzer.
Putative Orthology determination
Homology searches were done by submitting Hessian Fly
sequences to the BLASTX and TBLASTN program [54]
using the PAM30 substitution matrix [55]. An initial list of
Anopheles and Drosophila sequences that had a BLASTX
expectation value (E) less than e-4 were selected for manual analysis. This set of sequences was then further verified
by direct comparison of the Hessian fly nucleotide and
translated sequence to the corresponding Anopheles and
Drosophila entry. A. gambiae and D. melanogaster sequences
were considered to be orthologs of Hessian fly sequences
when the E value was less that e-16. [17] or if they satisfied
the following criteria: the gene did not belong to a multigene family in that particular genome, the TBLASTN value
was significant (< e-7) and coincided with the BLASTX
sequence chosen for analysis, the E values were significantly higher (> 100×) than that of the next hit (if any)
and the Anopheles ortholog determined was the previously
determined ortholog of the Drosophila gene (NCBI,
Ensembl). If the gene belonged to a multi-gene family,
postulated orthology was based on the degree of significance of the BLASTX and TBLASTN values. In addition,
each putative ortholog was searched against its own
genome, the top hits selected and phylogenetic trees and
molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted (MEGA
version 2.1 [56] and ClustalX [57] using all sequences
selected for a particular Hessian fly sequence to determine
if the sequences clustered as expected. Hessian fly
sequences were also analyzed using the BLASTN and
BLASTP programs against the available databases.
