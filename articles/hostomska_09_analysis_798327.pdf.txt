Abstract
Background: Sand fly saliva plays an important role in blood feeding and Leishmania transmission
as it was shown to increase parasite virulence. On the other hand, immunity to salivary components
impedes the establishment of infection. Therefore, it is most desirable to gain a deeper insight into
the composition of saliva in sand fly species which serve as vectors of various forms of
leishmaniases. In the present work, we focused on Phlebotomus (Adlerius) arabicus, which was
recently shown to transmit Leishmania tropica, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
Israel.
Results: A cDNA library from salivary glands of P. arabicus females was constructed and transcripts
were sequenced and analyzed. The most abundant protein families identified were SP15-like
proteins, ParSP25-like proteins, D7-related proteins, yellow-related proteins, PpSP32-like proteins,
antigen 5-related proteins, and 34 kDa-like proteins. Sequences coding for apyrases, hyaluronidase
and other putative secreted enzymes were also represented, including endonuclease,
phospholipase, pyrophosphatase, amylase and trehalase. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the
presence of 20 proteins predicted to be secreted in the salivary proteome. Humoral response of
mice bitten by P. arabicus to salivary antigens was assessed and many salivary proteins were
determined to be antigenic.
Conclusion: This transcriptomic analysis of P. arabicus salivary glands is the first description of
salivary proteins of a sand fly in the subgenus Adlerius. Proteomic analysis of P. arabicus salivary
glands produced the most comprehensive account in a single sand fly species to date. Detailed
information and phylogenetic relationships of the salivary proteins are provided, expanding the
knowledge base of molecules that are likely important factors of sand fly-host and sand flyLeishmania interactions. Enzymatic and immunological investigations further demonstrate the value
of functional transcriptomics in advancing biological and epidemiological research that can impact
leishmaniasis.

Background
Phlebotomine sand flies are the arthropod vectors of
Leishmania parasites, the causative agents of leishmaniasis. During the feeding process sand flies inject saliva into
the site of the bite to facilitate successful acquisition of a
blood meal [1]. An infected sand fly regurgitates infective
metacyclic promastigote stage Leishmania while feeding;
thus, the parasite is always introduced to the host as a mixture with sand fly saliva. Sand fly saliva facilitates the
transmission of Leishmania parasites to mammalian hosts;
at the same time, immune response to salivary components was shown to partially protect the host from Leishmania infection [2]. Therefore, salivary components
essential for parasite transmission and/or eliciting protective immune response are sought-after. Salivary proteins
from Phlebotomus papatasi, the vector of Leishmania major,
and Lutzomyia longipalpis, the vector of L. infantum, have
been extensively studied. In addition, cDNA libraries from
several other sand fly species were characterized and
include other sand flies that vector L. major (P. duboscqi),
L. infantum (P. ariasi and P. perniciosus) and L. donovani (P.
argentipes).
Phlebotomus (Adlerius) arabicus is distributed in certain
parts of East Africa and the Middle East. In Ethiopia, P.
arabicus females infected with uncharacterized Leishmania
sp. were reported [3], and in northern Israel P. arabicus is
the proven vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L.
tropica [4,5]. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica
is found in a vast discontinuous area reaching from the
south-western Mediterranean to Turkey, north-western
India and Sub-Saharan Africa [6]. Long supposed to circulate in anthroponotic foci exclusively, L. tropica was
recently shown to occur as an anthropozoonosis as well
[4,5]. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that P. arabicus is a permissive vector, meaning it is susceptible to
development of more than one species of Leishmania,
including L. major and L. infantum [7].
In the present study, salivary gland transcripts and proteins of P. (Adlerius) arabicus were studied by cDNA
sequencing, electrophoretic and proteomic methods. This
is the first study of the repertoire of salivary molecules of
a vector of L. tropica and it is the first report of the composition of salivary proteins in the subgenus Adlerius.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing of salivary gland cDNA library
A cDNA library was constructed from salivary glands of
Phlebotomus arabicus females dissected one day after emergence. From this cDNA library, 1152 random transcripts
were selected and sequenced, resulting in 985 high quality
sequences. Sequences were clustered together based on
sequence homology and produced 107 clusters and 288
sequences were assessed as singletons (only one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/282

sequence). The term cluster may refer to either singletons
or multiple homologous sequences. Similar to other sand
flies studied so far, the most abundant transcripts were
those coding for putative secretory proteins and resulted
in 74 clusters with an average number of 7.65 sequences
per cluster. Predicted proteins containing retention signals for endoplasmic reticulum and/or transmembrane
domains were not treated as putatively secreted. An example of such proteins is the translocon-associated protein
complex,  subunit (PabSP91; GenBank accession number
FJ427208), which has homologs previously designated as
16 kDa or 16.1 kDa salivary protein in P. ariasi or L. longipalpis, respectively.
Members of 21 different families were found among putative secretory proteins. BLAST comparison of translated
nucleotide sequences with the NR protein database
showed that overall, high similarity was observed namely
with salivary proteins of L. infantum vectors P. (Larroussius) ariasi and P. (L.) perniciosus. The expected values of
these matches were highly significant at values lower than
E-60. To a lesser extent, similarity to sequences of salivary
proteins of P. (Euphlebotomus) argentipes, the vector of L.
donovani in India, was also observed. These findings are
fully in concert with the close evolutionary relationship of
Larroussius and Adlerius subgenera reported by Aransay et
al. [8].
Some of the protein families contained multiple members. The observed variability among individual protein
family members might be explained by intraspecific polymorphism, as the tested sample was heterogeneous (a
pool of salivary glands from 30 female sand flies). Nevertheless, analysis of genetic variation of SP15 salivary protein in P. papatasi brought strong evidence that SP-15 is a
multicopy gene [9]. While individual intraspecific variability of sand fly salivary proteins awaits broader analysis,
we propose that the multiple homologous transcripts
within protein families observed in this P. arabicus salivary
gland cDNA library may reflect gene duplication events or
allelic variation.
Full-length sequences were obtained for most clusters
coding for putatively secreted proteins. Only sequences
containing a signal peptide and a polyA tail in the coding
cDNA were considered full-length. Table 1 lists clusters for
which full length sequences were obtained, including the
name of the sequence, the best match to NCBI NR database, the predicted molecular weight (Mw) and isoelectric
point (pI) of the mature protein, and the GenBank accession number of the nucleotide coding sequence. The table
also includes information on the presence of individual
proteins in P. arabicus salivary proteome, as confirmed by
Edman degradation and/or mass spectrometry. A more
detailed description of the putative secreted proteins fol-

lows, starting with proteins encoded by the most abundant transcripts:
SP15-like proteins
Thus far, SP15-like proteins have only been reported in
sand flies and their function remains unknown. It was
suggested that SP15-like proteins were derived from an
ancestral odorant-binding protein and were closely
related to short D7 proteins [10]. Immunization of mice
with P. papatasi SP15 conferred partial protection against
L. major infection [11]. Transcripts coding for these proteins represented the most abundant family in P. arabicus
salivary gland cDNA library and clustered into three separate groups (PabSP2, PabSP45 and PabSP93; GenBank
accession numbers FJ538111, FJ538112 and FJ538113,
respectively). The amino acid sequences of mature proteins coded by P. arabicus transcripts share 22.5% amino
acid identity and 23.3% amino acid similarity. When
SP15-like proteins from other sand flies were added to the
analysis, only the six cysteines and three other amino
acids were conserved in the amino acid sequence of
mature proteins (Figure 1A), reflecting the previously
reported divergence among SP15-like proteins in sand
flies [10]. In L. longipalpis a single SP15-like protein was
found, SL1. In P. arabicus and other Phlebotomus spp. studied so far multiple members of the SP15 family are
present. A phylogenetic analysis revealed three separate
groups of P. arabicus SP15-like proteins, showing close
relationships to P. ariasi proteins ParSP03, ParSP06 and
Par08, respectively (Figure 1B). The predicted pI of all
three P. arabicus SP15-like variants is highly basic (average
pI = 9.22), corresponding to the fact that most Phlebotomus
spp. sand fly salivary proteins have very high predicted pI
values.
27 kDa and 25 kDa proteins
Six clusters coding for proteins related to P. ariasi 27 kDa
salivary protein (ParSP25; GenBank accession number
AAX55664) and P. perniciosus 29 kDa salivary protein
(PpeSP08, GenBank accession number ABA43056) were

found in the P. arabicus salivary gland cDNA library. There
are no other homologs of these proteins in accessible
databases, no conserved domains were found in the translated sequences, and no function has been assigned to
these proteins. However, in P. arabicus cDNA library they
represent the second most abundant protein family. Transcripts coding for ParSP25-like proteins occurred in long
(PabSP15 and PabSP11; GenBank accession numbers
FJ538100 and FJ538101) and short forms (PabSP14,
PabSP16, PabSP13 and PabSP12; GenBank accession numbers FJ538102, FJ538103, FJ538104 and FJ538105,
respectively), with very little variability among individual
clusters. The mature proteins coded by these transcripts
have a predicted Mw of 27 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively,
and are composed of 90.5% identical amino acids and
0.9% similar amino acids. The predicted pI of the proteins
is acidic (average pI = 5.03), unlike most sand fly salivary
proteins described thus far.
D7-related proteins
D7 proteins are well known from the saliva of mosquitoes, sand flies, black flies and biting midges [12-15].
While the structure of anopheline D7 proteins allows
binding of biogenic amines and components of the contact activation system of coagulation [16,17], related proteins in sand flies lack conserved residues responsible for
stabilizing bound ligands [18]. Thus, they may not interfere with host hemostasis by a similar mechanism and
their function remains unknown. Mosquito D7 proteins
elicit IgE in individuals hypersensitive to mosquito bites
[19] and antibodies against sand fly D7 proteins were
found in dogs naturally exposed to L. longipalpis [20].
Thus, it is possible that sand fly D7 proteins are involved
in human hypersensitivity to sand fly bites. Four clusters
of sequences coding for D7-related proteins were found in
the P. arabicus salivary gland cDNA library (PabSP20,
PabSP59, PabSP54 and PabSP84; GenBank accession numbers FJ538107, FJ538108, FJ538109 and FJ538110,
respectively). Predicted mature proteins have Mw of 26–28
kDa and an average basic pI of 9.24. Two of the seven clus-

ters have potential N-glycosylation sites, as predicted by
NetNGlyc server. The protein sequences of mature proteins were 20.3% identical and 15.5% similar (Figure 2A).
The phylogenetic analysis showed four distinct clades
among P. arabicus D7-related proteins, all of them bearing
high similarity to P. ariasi and P. perniciosus proteins (Figure 2B).
Yellow-related proteins
Yellow-related proteins are common in insects; in bloodsucking Diptera, yellow-related proteins were described
from mosquitoes and sand flies. In Ae. aegypti, a
dopachrome-converting enzyme shares homology with
Drosophila melanogaster yellow proteins [21] and, according to Li et al. [22], it might play a role in melanotic encapsulation of parasites in the hemocoel. In sand fly salivary
gland samples, however, dopachrome-converting enzyme
activity could not be detected (Hostomska, unpublished
observations), while yellow protein of P. duboscqi was
detected in midgut and salivary glands and shown to have
lectin properties [23]. Sand fly yellow proteins were previously proposed as potential antigens recognized by sera of
experimentally bitten mice and dogs, and naturally
exposed humans [24-26]. In L. longipalpis this was also
suggested by mass spectrometry [20]. In the P. arabicus salivary gland cDNA library a single homolog of yellowrelated proteins was found (PabSP26; GenBank accession
number FJ410293). The predicted Mw of the protein is
42.9 kDa with a pI of 8.4. No N-glycosylation sites were
predicted in the protein sequence by amino acid submission to the NetNGlyc server.
PpSP32-like proteins
PpSP32-like proteins, so named due to homology with
proteins described from P. papatasi, have only been found
in sand flies and their function is unknown. In P. perniciosus they possess a collagen-related internal sequence
[10]. In P. arabicus, however, these proteins bear no significant similarity to collagen; this feature is shared with
PpSP32-like proteins of P. papatasi, P. ariasi or P. argentipes. Similarly to other protein families analyzed, the phylogenetic position of P. arabicus PpSP32-like proteins is
close to that of P. ariasi and P. perniciosus homologs (Figure 3A). Three different transcript clusters coding for
PpSP32-like proteins were found in the P. arabicus salivary
gland cDNA library (PabSP31, PabSP30 and PabSP29;
GenBank accession numbers EZ000628, EZ000629 and
EZ000630, respectively), the mature proteins being
88.1% identical (Figure 3B). The variable length of the
central glycine-rich region of the protein sequence results
in three different variants of mature proteins. The predicted Mw of the three variants are 25, 26.3 and 27.8 kDa.
In all three variants of these proteins, there are alternating
regions of very acidic (pI 4.0) and very basic (pI>11.5)
amino acids (Figure 3C). As shown in figure 3C, the basic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/282

regions include the central glycine-rich sequence and the
C-terminal basic tail. No N-glycosylation sites were predicted for these proteins by the NetNGlyc server.
Antigen 5-related proteins
Antigen 5 (Ag5) protein is present in vespid venom [27]
and related proteins were reported in the saliva of bloodsucking insects [28,29]. Similar to most other sand fly species studied so far, only one cluster coding for Ag5-related
protein was found in the P. arabicus cDNA library
(PabSP4; GenBank accession number FJ439532)
[10,28,30]. Mature Ag5-related proteins of sand flies are
45.6% identical and 14.5% similar, overall (Figure 4A).
The phylogenetic analysis of Ag5-related proteins from
sand flies, other blood-feeding insects and selected
hymenopteran species shows a strongly supported distinct clade of sand fly Ag5-related proteins (Figure 4B).
Unlike previous reports [10], this sand fly clade does not
contain any Culicoides sequences. Close relationship of P.
arabicus Ag5-related protein to P. perniciosus and P. ariasi
was observed, much in the same way as in other salivary
protein families (Figure 4B). The predicted Mw of the
mature protein is 31.1 kDa and the pI is very basic (9.27).
Apyrase
Apyrases are widespread in saliva of bloodsucking insects.
The antihemostatic effects of saliva are, for a great part,
due to apyrase anti-platelet activity [31]. Sand fly apyrases
belong to the Cimex apyrase family [32]. Three very similar apyrase clusters coding for apyrases were found in P.
arabicus cDNA library (98.4% identity) (PabSP41,
PabSP40 and PabSP39; GenBank accession numbers
EZ000631, EZ000632 and EZ000633, respectively). The
predicted average pI of P. arabicus apyrases is 8.85 and the
predicted Mw is 35.3 kDa.
Endonuclease
A cluster encoding a putative endonuclease was identified
in the P. arabicus cDNA library (PabSP49; GenBank accession number FJ439531). Similar sequences were reported
from P. ariasi, P. perniciosus, P. argentipes, and L. longipalpis
salivary glands. Cluster PabSP49 encodes an endonuclease
domain, which is typical for DNA/RNA non-specific
endonucleases. Since all residues composing the active
site, the substrate binding site and the Mg2+ binding site
are conserved in this cluster; we suggest that PabSP49
might possess endonuclease activity. The predicted pI of
the mature protein is 9.45 and the predicted Mw of the
mature protein is 40.5 kDa. Possible roles for a salivary
endonuclease include reducing the viscosity of the blood
pool during feeding and liberating nucleosides. Exogenous nucleosides, primarily adenosine, can exhibit regulatory effects on blood clotting, immune and
inflammatory responses, and Leishmania pathogenesis
[33].

Hyaluronidase
Hyaluronidase activity has been detected in several species of bloodsucking insects including sand flies [34,35].
Accessible expressed sequence tag (EST) data from cDNA
libraries of P. papatasi and P. duboscqi salivary glands do
not contain hyaluronidase transcripts. Nonetheless, the
enzyme activity was detected in salivary gland samples
from these species [34], highlighting the potent enzymatic
activity of a protein produced from a low abundance transcript. In salivary gland homogenate of P. arabicus,
hyaluronidase activity was also observed. As revealed by
zymography, the apparent molecular weight of the P. arabicus hyaluronidase holoenzyme is approximately 110
kDa (Figure 5), but no protein band correspond to the
predicted molecular weight could be detected by silver or
Coomassie staining in electrophoretically separated salivary proteins. These observations reflect the scarcity of
both hyaluronidase transcript and hyaluronidase protein
in sand fly salivary glands, and at the same time underline
the remarkably high specific activity of the enzyme. In P.
arabicus, the predicted pI for mature hyaluronidase is 9.07
and the Mw is 53 kDa.
Additional putative enzymes
In the amino acid translation of sequence cluster 52
(PabSP52, GenBank accession number EZ000627), a
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) domain is present, containing
all conserved residues of both catalytic and metal-binding
sites of PLA2. In hymenopteran venoms, PLA2 represents
a major allergen. In the salivary glands of blood-feeding
insects, sequences coding for PLA2-like proteins were
reported only from sand flies of the subgenus Larroussius
[10,30]. We tested salivary gland samples of P. arabicus
specifically for PLA2 activity and did not detect any positive reaction. Cluster 52 contains an exceptionally long 5'
untranslated region (5' UTR) compared to other clusters
from this cDNA library coding for secreted proteins. The
5' UTR in this cluster is more than 500 nucleotides long.
Thus, the regulation of expression of this transcript might
be different from other transcripts reported herein.

Other sequences coding for other putative enzymes could
not be obtained as full-length clones. These included a
pyrophosphatase-like protein (PabSP288, GenBank accession number EZ000634), amylase (PabSP47, GenBank
accession number EZ000626), an enzyme involved in
digestion of dietary starch [36], and trehalase (PabSP315,
GenBank accession number EZ000625). Previously,
sequences coding for pyrophosphatase-like proteins were
reported in P. argentipes and P. duboscqi sand flies [10,37].
These proteins, as well as their P. arabicus homolog
reported herein, contain a conserved phosphodiesterase
domain, typical for enzymes cleaving phosphodiester and
phosphosulphate bonds in NAD, deoxynucleotides and
nucleotide sugars [38]. Transcripts coding for -amylase

were found in L. longipalpis salivary glands and midguts as
well as P. papatasi midguts [28,39,40]. Amylase activity
was shown in L. longipalpis and P. papatasi salivary gland
samples [28,36] and it is likely that the enzymatic activity
is present also in P. arabicus salivary glands. The putative
trehalase enzyme from P. arabicus salivary glands might
either be an intrinsic component of insect metabolism, or
might be related to sugar feeding and digestion. Trehalose
is the main energy source in insect hemolymph in general.
Trehalases are involved in its hydrolysis, yielding glucose
molecules which are then readily available to various cells
of the insect body [41]. So far, trehalase enzyme or
sequence has not been reported from salivary glands of
any blood-feeding insects, but sequences coding for sand
fly trehalase have been found in midgut cDNA libraries of
P. papatasi [40].
Putative secreted proteins of unknown function
There were a number of transcripts with no homology to
known enzymes or structural proteins; however, eight of
these transcripts encode potentially secreted proteins with
high homology to other sand fly salivary molecules. P.
arabicus salivary transcripts code for 34 kDa proteins
homologous to ParSP09. Polymorphisms resulting in different translations of the transcripts were observed
(PabSP32 and PabSP34; GenBank accession numbers
FJ489241 and FJ489242, respectively). These proteins are

seemingly sand fly-specific; apart from 5 sand fly species
(P. ariasi, P. perniciosus, P. argentipes, P. duboscqi and L. longipalpis); no other related proteins from any organism
were reported. Another family of putative sand fly-specific
proteins contain homologs of P. arabicus 46 kDa salivary
protein (PabSP53; GenBank accession number FJ538106).
Transcripts coding for such proteins were reported from P.
perniciosus, P. ariasi, P. duboscqi and L. longipalpis.
Homologs of P. arabicus 2.7 kDa peptide (PabSP56; GenBank accession number FJ538099) were only found in P.
ariasi and P. perniciosus [10,30]. Our finding contradicts
the suggestion that 2.7 kDa peptides are specific for the
subgenus Larroussius [10]. Likewise, two unrelated 10 kDa
proteins (PabSP75 and PabSP97; GenBank accession numbers FJ474087 and FJ474088, respectively) were found in
P. arabicus; homologous molecules were identified in P.
ariasi [30]. Additionally, two transcripts putatively encoding 16 kDa salivary proteins (two polymorphic variants
PabSP63 and PabSP64; GenBank accession numbers
FJ474085 and FJ474086, respectively) are homologous to
molecules identified in P. argentipes [10].
Two sequence clusters coding for putatively secreted proteins in the P. arabicus cDNA library show no similarity
with known sand fly sequences. Cluster 107 (PabSP107;
GenBank accession number EZ000635) is homologous to
Ae. aegypti putative salivary secreted mucin 3, as well as
the IgE binding protein icarapin from honeybee venom
[42]. The predicted molecular weight of the mature protein is 22.2 kDa and the putative protein would have an
acidic pI of 4.4. There are 2 potential N-glycosylation sites
and 9 potential O-glycosylation sites in the amino acid
sequence of cluster 107, as predicted by submission to the
NetNGlyc and NetOGlyc servers. Similarly, putative extracellular proteins of Anopheles gambiae (XP_001230739)
and Aedes aegypti (XP_001650286) were also predicted to
contain multiple O-glycosylation sites. These proteins
might be involved in hypersensitivity to bites of bloodfeeding insects. The second cluster 126 (PabSP126; GenBank accession number EZ000636), encodes a homolog
of conserved hypothetical proteins of culicine as well as
anopheline mosquitoes. The predicted molecular weight
of the mature protein from P. arabicus is 17.2 kDa and the
predicted pI is 5.34. No N- or O-glycosylation sites were
predicted in cluster 126 protein and nothing is known
about these hypothetical proteins.
Proteome analysis of P. arabicus salivary glands
For the proteome analysis, P. arabicus salivary gland samples separated by SDS-PAGE were subjected to Edman
degradation and mass spectrometry. Edman degradation
resulted in the identification of 7 different N-terminal
sequences. These were representative of two 14 kDa proteins (PabSP2 and PabSP45; GenBank accession numbers
FJ538111 and FJ538112, respectively), yellow-related

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/282

protein (PabSP26; FJ410293), and endonuclease
(PabSP49; FJ439531). An N-terminal sequence common
to all six variants of salivary proteins similar to ParSP25
was also detected by Edman degradation (PabSP11-16;
GenBank accession numbers FJ538100–FJ538105), as
well as N-terminal sequences common to apyrases
(PabSP39-41; EZ000631-EZ000633) and to D7-related
proteins A and C (PabSP20 and PabSP54; FJ538107 and
FJ538109, respectively). From the data obtained by
Edman degradation analysis it could not be concluded
which variants of polymorphic salivary proteins were
present in the proteome.
Mass spectrometry was used for a more detailed analysis
of P. arabicus salivary proteome. By this method, 19 putative secreted proteins were identified in the proteome
(Figure 6). These proteins include amylase (PabSP47,
GenBank accession number ), yellow-related protein
(PabSP26; GenBank accession number ), two 34 kDa salivary proteins (PabSP32 and PabSP34; GenBank accession
number and , respectively), all three apyrase-like proteins
(PabSP39-41; GenBank accession number , , ), two
PpSP32-like proteins (PabSP31 and PabSP30; GenBank
accession number and , respectively), antigen 5-related
protein (PabSP4; GenBank accession number ), four 25
kDa salivary proteins similar to ParSP25 (PabSP14,
PabSP16, PabSP13 and PabSP12; GenBank accession
number , , and , respectively), three D7-related proteins
(PabSP20, PabSP59 and PabSP54; GenBank accession
number , and , respectively), and two PpSP15-like proteins (PabSP2 and PabSP45; GenBank accession number
and , respectively). In addition, one high-molecular
weight protein (>70 kDa) analyzed by mass spectrometry
revealed no similarity to predicted P. arabicus secreted salivary proteins. We assume this protein represents a component of salivary gland wall rather than a secreted
protein present in the saliva. Accordingly, in P. duboscqi
female salivary glands, we previously detected multiple
protein bands running at molecular weight protein >70
kDa which were specifically present in the wall of salivary
glands [43].
Additionally, glycoprotein-specific staining of electrophoretically separated proteins was performed. ProQ Emerald
staining detected six glycoprotein bands in P. arabicus salivary gland samples (Figure 7). Three bands (B, C and D)
correlate with proteins identified by mass spectrometry:
amylase (PabSP47), yellow-related protein (PabSP26),
and 34 kDa proteins (PabSP32 and PabSP34). Band A is
predicted to migrate at about 97 kDa and may represent
hyaluronidase; however, this band may be produced by
the oligomerization of other salivary proteins or components of the gland structure. Bands E and F do not distinctly correlate with molecules identified by mass
spectrometry and are therefore unknown.

Mass-spectrometric analysis of salivary gland proteins from Phlebotomus arabicus. Salivary gland samples
were electrophoretically separated and individual bands cut
from the Coomassie-stained gel were analyzed by mass spectrometry. GenBank accession number of the corresponding
protein coding sequence is listed for each protein identified.

Humoral response to P. arabicus saliva
Some of the proteins homologous to P. arabicus salivary
proteins are known as antigens or allergens in other insect
species. P. arabicus salivary proteins elicit a strong antibody response in mice exposed to P. arabicus feeding. In
Western blots, the most prominent antigenic bands recognized by sera of two bitten mice (Figure 8, lanes 2 and 3)
had apparent molecular weights of 56–58.5 kDa, 45 kDa,
43 kDa (a double band), 42 kDa, 34.5–36.5 kDa and 30
kDa. Slightly weaker reactions were observed with bands
running at 31 kDa and 30.5 kDa. In addition, sera from
some animals recognized two very faint bands, running at
21 kDa and 16 kDa (Figure 8).

In this study we generated a transcriptome of female sand
fly Phlebotomus arabicus salivary glands using a PCR-based
cDNA library. This is the first reported salivary gland transcriptome of a sand fly from the subgenus Adlerius. The
most abundant transcripts were represented in the 985
high quality sequences. Many of the transcripts encoded
full- or partial-length proteins; most of which are homologous to other sand fly species saliva molecules. Phylogenetic analysis consistently shows a strong relationship
between P. arabicus with sand flies from the Larroussius
subgenus; specifically, P. ariasi and P. perniciousus. The
phylogenetic analyses of sand fly salivary proteins reaffirm the taxonomy of phlebotomines [7].
Some of the most abundant molecules identified in the
transcriptome that have a predicted signal secretion peptide include a 14 kDa protein (PabSP2), a D7-related protein (PabSP20), a yellow-related protein (PabSP26), an
Antigen 5-related protein (PabSP4) and 25 kDa and 27
kDa proteins similar to P. ariasi ParSP25 (PabSP14 and
PabSP15, respectively). A number of paralogous transcripts were identified, such as those in the SP15 and D7
families. The presence of duplicate gene copies has been
observed in other blood feeding arthropods [10,44] and
can serve several potential functions including increased
transcript abundance and rapid evolution of blood feeding strategies while retaining intrinsic proteins. Proteomic
analysis by N-terminal sequencing or tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometry identified 20 proteins in the
salivary gland homogenate of P. arabicus that were characterized in the transcriptome. In addition, one protein was
identified by mass spectrometry that did not match any of
the characterized transcripts. This is the most comprehensive description of sand fly salivary proteome to date and
also demonstrates that the transcriptome represents >95%
of the most abundant proteins present in the salivary
gland.
In the analysis of the P. arabicus salivary gland transcriptome four sequences were identified as encoding a putative hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that has
been identified in a number of phlebotomine salivary
glands including Lutzomyia longipalpis, P. Phlebotomus papatasi, P. Phlebotomus duboscqi, P. Paraphlebotomus sergenti
and P. Adlerius halepensis [34]. The zymographic analysis
of salivary gland extract confirms the presence of an active
hyaluronidase enzyme and demonstrates the effectiveness
of a transcriptomic approach to identifying disease vector
salivary components.
Having described the repertoire of saliva molecules opens
more doors in the research of vector-host and vector-parasite interactions, pharmacology and insect biochemistry.
The antigenicity of sand fly saliva is one important aspect

of the vector-host interaction. Evaluating the humoral
response of mice bitten by P. arabicus demonstrates the
abundance and diversity of antigenic molecules in the
saliva. Future work may focus on the use of functional
transcriptomics (expression of recombinant protein and
biological and biochemical assays) to use these P. arabicus
salivary proteins to evaluate the role of these molecules in
the epidemiology of leishmaniasis.

Methods
Sand flies and salivary gland dissection
The colony of P. arabicus (Israel) was reared in the insectary of Charles University in Prague in standard conditions as described by Benkova and Volf [45]. For mRNA
extraction salivary glands of 1-day-old females were dissected in saline and stored in RNA later (Ambion). For
proteome analysis and Western blot analysis, salivary
glands from 5- to 7-day-old P. arabicus females were dis-

sected and stored in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 7.5).
Construction of salivary gland cDNA library
Salivary gland mRNA was isolated from 30 pairs of glands
using Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen).
PCR-based cDNA library was made following the manufacturer's instructions for SMART™ cDNA library Construction Kit (BD Clontech) with some modifications
described by Chmelar et al. [46]. The cDNA library was
fractionated into three sets of cDNAs containing large,
medium and small fragments. Gigapack® III Gold Packaging Extract (Stratagene) was used for packaging the phage
particles. The libraries were plated by infecting log-phase
XL-1 blue Escherichia coli (Clontech). Several plaques from
each plate were selected and a PCR with vector primers
flanking the inserted cDNA was performed. The presence
of recombinants was checked by visualisation the PCR
products on 1.1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
Sequencing of Selected cDNA Clones
Plaques were randomly selected from the plated libraries
and transferred to 96-well polypropylene plate containing
75 l of water per well. The PCR reaction amplifying ran-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:282

domly selected cDNAs was performed using FastStart PCR
Master mix (Roche), 3 l of the phage sample as a template and primers described elsewhere [30]. Amplification
conditions were as follows: 1 hold of 75°C for 3 min, 1
hold of 94°C for 2 min and 34 cycles of 94°C for 1 min,
49°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. Final elongation step
lasted for 10 min at 72°C. Reaction products were cleaned
using ExcelaPure 96-Well UF PCR Purification Plates
(EdgeBio) and used as templates for cycle-sequencing
reaction using BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing
kit (Applied Biosystems) and a forward primer described
elsewhere [30]. Cycle-sequencing reaction products were
cleaned using sephadex and MultiScreen HV Plates (Millipore), dried and stored at -20°C. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730Xl DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
Bioinformatics
Detailed description of the bioinformatic treatment of the
data can be found elsewhere [29,46]. Briefly, EST trace
files were analyzed using a customized program based on
the Phred algorithm [47,48]. Sequences with Phred quality scores lower than 20 were removed, as well as primer
and vector sequences. Resulting sequences were grouped
into clusters using a customized program based on identity (95% identity, 64 word size) and aligned into contiguous sequences (contigs) using the CAP3 sequence
assembly program [49]. BLASTX, BLASTN or RPS BLAST
programs [50] were used to compare contigs and singletons (contigs with a single sequence) to the non-redundant (NR) protein database of the NCBI, the gene
ontology (GO) fasta subset [51], to the conserved
domains database (CDD) of NCBI [52] which contains
KOG ()[53], Pfam [54] and Smart databases[55], and to
mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences available
from NCBI. The three frame translations of each dataset
were submitted to the SignalP server [56] to detect signal
peptides. The grouped and assembled sequences, BLAST
results and SignalP results were combined in an Excel
spreadsheet and manually verified and annotated. N- and
O-glycosylation site prediction was performed for selected
sequences using NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc 3.1 software
(www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc,
www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/NetOGlyc) [57].
Phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences of the members of identified protein
families were compared with related sequences of other
sand fly species obtained from GenBank. Sequences were
aligned using ClustalW version 1.4 [58] running under
BioEdit sequence-editing software, version 7, and manually refined in BioEdit. For each alignment, best substitution matrix was determined by ProtTest software, version
1.4 [59]. This matrix was then used by TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
[60] to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from the protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/282

alignments by maximum likelihood. TREE-PUZZLE
implements quartet puzzling (QP) tree search; at the same
time, the algorithm estimates support values for each
internal branch. The number of puzzling steps was 1000
in each phylogenetic analysis. Resulting trees were viewed
in MEGA 4 [61].
Proteome analysis
Salivary glands from 5-day-old P. arabicus females were
homogenized by 5 freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were
reduced using sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and
electrophoretically separated in 12% polyacrylamide SDS
gel. Gels were stained for total proteins with Coomassie
G-250 (SimplyBlue SafeStain, Invitrogen) or for glycoproteins with Pro-Q Emerald 300 glycoprotein stain (Invitrogen). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with
individual bands cut from the Coomassie-stained gel. The
individual bands were placed in microtubes and covered
with 100 l 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) buffer
in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) with 50 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT). The samples were subjected to sonication in an
ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. After 15 minutes the supernatant was discarded and the gel was covered with 100 l
of 50 mM ABC/50% ACN with 50 mM iodoacetamide
and sonicated for 5 minutes. After 25 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and exchanged for 100 l 50 mM
ABC/50% ACN with 50 mM DTT and sonicated for 5 minutes to remove any excess iodoacetamide. The supernatant
was discarded and samples were sonicated for 5 minutes
in 100 l of HPLC water. The water was discarded and
samples were sonicated for another 5 minutes in 100 l of
ACN. ACN was discarded and microtubes with samples
were left open for a couple of minutes to allow the rest of
ACN to evaporate. Five ng of trypsin (Promega) in 10 l
of 50 mM ABC were added to the gel. Samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and
ACN were added to reach final concentration 1% TFA,
30% ACN. Samples were sonicated for 10 minutes and 0.5
l drop was transferred onto MALDI target and let to dry.
Dried droplets were covered with 0.5 l drop of alphacyano-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (2 mg/ml in 80%
ACN) and let to dry. Samples were measured using a 4800
Plus MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer (Applied Biosystems/
MDS Sciex) equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, firing
rate 200 Hz).

Peak lists from the MS spectra were generated by 4000
Series Explorer V 3.5.3 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex)
without smoothing, peaks with local signal to noise ratio
greater than 5 were picked and searched by local Mascot v.
2.1 (Matrix Science) against a database of proteins
sequences derived from cDNA library. Database search
criteria were as follows – enzyme: trypsin, taxonomy:
none, fixed modification: carbamidomethylation, variable modification: methionine oxidation, peptide mass

tolerance: 120 ppm, one missed cleavage allowed. Only
hits that were scored as significant (p < 0.0001) are
included.
For the Edman degradation analysis, Phlebotomus arabicus
salivary glands were electrophoretically separated on 1
mm thick 4–20% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels using MES
SDS buffer (Invitrogen). A sample containing 30 glands
was reduced with NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen) and run in parallel with non-reduced samples
(50 glands) on the same gel. Wet blotting on a PVDF
membrane was performed using XCell II™ Blot Module
(Invitrogen). SeeBlue® Pre-Stained Standards (Invitrogen)
were used to estimate molecular weight (Mw) of separated
proteins and assess transfer efficiency. The membrane was
stained with 0.025% Coomassie blue without acetic acid.
Stained bands were cut and subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise 494cLC sequencer (Applied Biosystems). cDNA sequences corresponding to obtained Nterminal amino acid sequences of salivary proteins were
identified using an in-house search program [29]. This
program compared three possible translations of each
cDNA sequence obtained in the P. arabicus cDNA
sequencing project with the amino acid sequences.
Enzymatic assays
Salivary gland samples from 5-day-old P. arabicus females
were tested for the activities of hyaluronidase and phospholipase A2. Salivary glands were dissected in Tris buffer
(20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) and stored at -20°C.
Before use, the glands were mechanically disrupted, samples were centrifuged at 12000 g for 5 minutes, and the
supernatant was used in the assays.

The zymographic hyaluronidase assay was performed as
described by Volfova et al. [35]. Briefly, salivary gland
samples were separated by SDS electrophoresis in 8%
polyacrylamide slab gels with incorporated hyaluronan
(0.002%). Prior to electrophoresis, aliquots of the sample
were subjected to treatment with reducing agents (dithiothreitol 50 mM, 45 minutes at 25°C, or 2-mercaptoethanol 7 mM, 45 minutes at 40°C). An equivalent of 1
salivary gland per lane was used for electrophoresis under
reducing conditions using dithiothreitol, an equivalent of
2 salivary glands per lane for electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 2-mercaptoethanol, and for electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, an equivalent of
1/12 of a gland per lane was used. After the electrophoresis, SDS was washed out of the gels; the gels were equilibrated with 0.1 M acetate buffer and incubated at 37°C
for 120 minutes. Gels stained with Stains-all (Sigma) were
rinsed in distilled water and documented.
The phospholipase A2 activity was tested in the same salivary gland samples using the EnzChek® Phospholipase A2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/282

Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The manufacturer's instructions
were followed. Samples containing 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20
salivary glands in 50 l were assayed; as a positive control,
PLA2 from honey bee venom supplied with the kit was
used. The assay was performed at 26°C, and fluorescence
emission at 515 nm was detected after an incubation step
of 12 minutes (Tecan Infinite 200).
Immunization of mice
Experiments on mice were done in accordance with Czech
Act No. 246/1992 and approved by IACUC of the Faculty
of Science, Charles University in Prague. Female BALB/c
mice, 8 weeks old (Charles River Deutschland, Sulzfeld,
Germany) were used for the exposure to P. arabicus sand
flies. In biweekly intervals, the mice were anaesthetized
with ketamine (1.5 mg/10 g body weight) and xylazin
(0.15 mg/10 g body weight) and exposed to sand fly
females. Each time, an average of 60 females fed on each
mouse (SE = 14.9). Ten days after the sixth exposure the
mice were bled and obtained sera were kept at -20°C.
Western blotting
Phlebotomus arabicus salivary gland proteins were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and
separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel, 0.75
mm thick using Mini-Protean III apparatus (BioRad). As a
reducing agent, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol was used in
sample buffer. Biotinylated low range standards (BioRad)
were run on the same gel. Separated proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by iBlot™ Gel
Transfer Device (Invitrogen), and the membrane was cut
into strips corresponding to sample load of 5 salivary
glands per strip. These strips carrying salivary gland samples were either stained with amidoblack (Merck; 0.1%
solution in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid) or
blocked with 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH
7.4, with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tw) overnight. The sample-carrying strips were incubated for 1 hour with preimmune or immune sera of BALB/c mice exposed to P.
arabicus (diluted 1:250 in PBS-Tw), and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-mouse antibody
(Sevapharma, 1:1000 in PBS-Tw) for 45 minutes. Streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Sigma, 1 g/ml in PBS-Tw)
was used for the biotinylated standards. The colour reaction was developed using H2O2 and diaminobenzidine in
PBS. Washes between individual steps were done with
PBS-Tw.
