Abstract
Background: Mali is one of the most important livestock producers of the Sahel region of Africa.
A high frequency of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) has been reported but surveillance and control
schemes are restricted to abattoir inspections only. The objective of this study was to conduct, for
the first time, molecular characterisation of Mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from cattle
slaughtered at the Bamako abattoir. Of 3330 animals screened only 60 exhibited gross visible
lesions. From these animals, twenty strains of M. bovis were isolated and characterised by
spoligotyping.
Results: Organ lesions typical of BTB were most often detected in the liver, followed by the lung
and the peritoneum. M. bovis was isolated from 20 animals and 7 different spoligotypes were
observed among these 20 strains; three of the patterns had not been previously reported.
Spoligotype patterns from thirteen of the strains lacked spacer 30, a characteristic common in
strains of M. bovis found in Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria. However, unlike the other three Central
African countries, the majority of spoligotype patterns observed in Mali also lacked spacer 6. Of
the remaining seven strains, six had spoligotype patterns identical to strains commonly isolated in
France and Spain.
Conclusion: Two groups of M. bovis were detected in cattle slaughtered at the Bamako abattoir.
The spoligotype pattern of the first group has similarities to strains previously observed in Chad,
Cameroon and Nigeria. The additional absence of spacer 6 in the majority of these strains suggests
a Mali specific clone. The spoligotype patterns of the remaining strains suggest that they may have
been of European origin.

Background
Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is considered a neglected and
poverty related zoonosis [1]. It has a major economic
impact on livestock productivity [2], can persist in wildlife

reservoirs and thus affect entire ecosystems [3] and it is of
public health concern due to its zoonotic potential [4-6].
Although still prevalent in the developed world [7-9], BTB
today mostly affects developing countries, which lack the

financial and human resources to control the disease
[4,5]. The Sahel region of Africa is extremely important in
terms of animal production with Mali being amongst the
principal cattle producing countries [10,11]. Mali has previously reported a high frequency of BTB but does not
apply specific control measures, except carcass inspection
at abattoirs [4]. In a recent prevalence study in dairy cattle
herds from the peri-urban region of Bamako, 19% of the
animals reacted positively to the comparative tuberculin
skin test [12].
Spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) [13] has
been shown to be a valuable tool for investigations of the
population structure of Mycobacterium bovis in a number
of settings [7,8,14-16]. Furthermore, the international
designation of spoligotype patterns http://www.Mbo
vis.org, [17] has facilitated the comparison of results from
different countries and helps elucidate the distribution
and spread of strains. Assuming that spoligotype spacers
can only be lost and not regained, phylogenetic relationships between strains can be suggested [18,19]. A number
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) strain families are readily identifiable through spoligotyping [2022].
Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) typing is
another simple method for M. bovis genotyping with a
higher discriminatory power than spoligotyping [19,23].
However, extensive worldwide databases are presently not
available and VNTR typing can today mainly be considered a valuable tool for sub-differentiation of strain
groups initially identified by spoligotyping [19].
For M. bovis, previous studies in Chad, Cameroon and
Nigeria have shown that virtually all spoligotype patterns
lack spacer 30 with strains bearing spoligotype pattern
SB0944 being the most frequent [14-16]. In Cameroon,
because of the similarity to patterns of strains isolated in
France [7] it was suggested that M. bovis could have been
imported to this region during the French colonial period
[15]. However, strains lacking spacer 30 were so far rarely
found outside Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria.
The objectives of this study were to conduct an initial
molecular characterisation of M. bovis in Mali using spoligotyping and to identify potential exchange of strains with
other regions.

Results
At the abattoir of Bamako, Mali, a case series of 3330
slaughter animals were sequentially screened during
standard meat inspection in March and April 2007. A total
of 182 specimens from 60 animals with gross visible
lesions (apparent lesion prevalence: 1.8%; 95% CI: 1.4 –
2.3%) were collected. Organ lesions were most often

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/26

detected in the liver (N = 22) followed by the lung (N =
14) and the peritoneum (N = 11). The specimens were put
in culture and Acid-Fast Bacilli were further characterised
by spoligotyping and typing of the M. bovis specific RD4
region. Infection with M. bovis was confirmed for 20 animals. From two animals, strains of the Mycobacterium fortuitum Complex were isolated as identified by partial
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In one case it appeared
to be a single infection and in the other case a mixed infection of an M. fortuitum Complex strain and M. bovis. In
this animal, the M. fortuitum Complex strain was isolated
from liver lesions and M. bovis was isolated from lesions
of the lungs and bronchial lymph nodes.
Infection with M. bovis was highly associated with the
presence of lung lesions (N = 44, chi-squared = 23.7, p <
0.001); in 79% of the animals exhibiting lung lesions, M.
bovis infection could be confirmed. The association was
less strong for liver lesions (N = 48, chi-squared = 3.9, p <
0.05); only 41% of the animals with liver lesions were
shown to be infected with M. bovis. However, in all 9 cases
where M. bovis infection was detected in animals with liver
lesions, lung lesions were present as well. No association
was found between infection with M. bovis and lesions in
organs other than the liver and lungs. Strains of M. bovis
isolated in different organs of the same animal showed
the same spoligotype pattern. Altogether among the 20
strains of M. bovis isolated, seven different spoligotypes
were observed; four had been previously reported
(SB0944, SB0300, SB0134 and SB0944) and the remaining three were designated SB1410, SB1411 and SB1412 by
http://www.Mbovis.org (figure 1).
The distinctive lack of spacer 30 was observed in the spoligotype pattern of 13 strains; the majority of those in
addition lacked spacer 6 (12/13; figure 1). The remaining
seven strains were linked by the absence of spacers 4 and
5 (figure 1).
VNTR typing using the exact tandem repeats (ETR) A-F
described by Frothingham et al. [24] allowed to further
differentiate strains with the most frequent spoligotype
patterns SB0300 and SB0134 (figure 1). Within the strains
analysed, only VNTR loci ETR A, B and C showed variation; ETR D, E and F profiles were identical in all the
strains. One isolate exhibited two different VNTR alleles
(3 and 5 tandem repeats) for locus ETR C (figure 1), indicating either a mixed infection with two distinct strains or
a microevolution in this population of strains.

Discussion
The apparent prevalence of 1.8% gross visible lesions in
Malian slaughter cattle was surprisingly low compared to
published results from other Sahelian countries
[14,25,26] and also lower than the previous tuberculin

skin test results of cattle from Bamako indicated (reactor
prevalence of 19%) [12]. This suggests that the cattle population slaughtered in the abattoir of Bamako originates
largely from extensive pastoral rather than intensive periurban production systems, where BTB prevalence is usually higher [27]. Because lesion prevalence was so low and
because we could not gauge the sensitivity of lesion detection we did not estimate the true prevalence of BTB at the
Bamako abattoir. However, it is likely to be at least two to
three fold higher than the observed prevalence [25,26].
Only the presence of lung lesions was strongly associated
with the detection of M. bovis infection, suggesting that
the lung was the primary site of M. bovis infection; the
association of liver lesions and M. bovis infection was
weaker. Furthermore, in all the cases where M. bovis infection could be confirmed in animals with liver lesions,
lung lesions were also present (N = 9). In 12 animals liver
lesions were recorded without associated lung lesions,
however, in these animals we were unable to isolate M.
bovis by culture. One animal exhibited a mixed infection
of a M. fortuitum Complex strain isolated from the liver
and M. bovis, isolated from lesions associated with the
lung and the bronchial lymph nodes. This indicates that
some of the lesions outside the lung, and particularly the
liver, have been caused by pathogens other than M. bovis.
The amount of lesion causing infections due to other
organisms than M. bovis might be considerable as only
one third of the animals with lesions could be confirmed
to be infected with M. bovis. Tuberculous gross visible
lesions may be caused by an array of pathogens amongst
which Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) could play a
crucial role in Africa (unpublished results, [28,29]). This
suggestion is supported by a previous study in Chad
where M. fortuitum Complex was repeatedly isolated from
lesions in slaughtered cattle [28]. It may be worthwhile to

address the role of NTM infections on animal productivity
in relation to BTB in African cattle.
Bacteria could only be isolated from 21 out of 60 animals
with gross lesions; this was less than in other studies
[14,29]. Failure to cultivate bacteria could have been due
to long-term storage of tissue samples in the freezer prior
to cultivation. Because of frequent power cuts, we cannot
exclude that some of the specimen might have undergone
multiple freeze-thaw cycles while they were stored. A high
amount of completely calcified lesions, without viable
tubercle bacilli, could also explain the low recovery of bacteria (references within [26]).
The strains identified here can be divided into two groups
by spoligotype pattern (figure 1). The first group is
marked by the distinct loss of spacer 30 and accounts for
65% of the strains detected (figure 1). The absence of
spacer 30 has previously found to be characteristic of spoligotype patterns for strains of M. bovis isolated in Chad,
Cameroon and Nigeria [14-16]. In addition to the absence
of spacer 30, most of the strains from Mali (12/13) also
lack spacer 6, a characteristic not seen in isolates from
Central African countries [14-16]. The most often detected
M. bovis strains in Mali with spoligotype pattern SB0300
could have evolved from strains with spoligotype pattern
SB0944 either by drift or a selective sweep. This is supported by the fact that two of the three VNTR types identified in Malian strains with spoligotype pattern SB0300
were identical to VNTR types of previously isolated Nigerian M. bovis strains with spoligotype pattern SB0944 [16].
Altogether, the results suggest a close relationship
between strains from Mali and those from Central Africa.
The spread of related strains over this large area could be
explained by the predominant long distance transhumant
livestock production system in the Sahel, mainly practised

BMC Veterinary Research 2008, 4:26

by Fulbe pastoralists [30]. However, considering the fact
that, except for pattern SB0944, none of the spoligotype
patterns found in Mali are present in any of the three Central African countries and considering that strains with
spoligotype pattern SB0944 were rarely detected in Mali
we suppose that the spread of M. bovis strains over this
large distance is relatively slow.
The second group of related spoligotype patterns is characterized by the absence of spacers 4 and 5 (figure 1). The
most often detected spoligotype belonging to this group is
commonly found in strains from France and Spain
(SB0134 [7,31]), suggesting a link between M. bovis
strains from Mali and mainland Europe. VNTR profile 6 5
5 4 for ETR loci A-D identified in 2/6 Malian strains of M.
bovis with spoligotype pattern SB0134 has also been
detected in a strain isolated from French cattle in the Normandy in 1996 with the same spoligotype pattern [32].
Moreover, three other Malian M. bovis strains with ETR AD profile 7 5 5 4 and spoligotype pattern SB0134 could be
closely related to SB0134 M. bovis strains with ETR A-D
profile 7 4 5 4, which is frequently found in M. bovis
strains from the Normandy [32]. However, identical spoligotype patterns have also been found in strains from
northern Algeria (unpublished results) and livestock
migrations from Algeria to Mali through the Sahara desert
have been reported. Comprehensive genotyping of strains
from West Africa, North Africa and Europe using highly
polymorphic markers would be necessary to further elucidate the interrelationship of M. bovis strains from these
different regions.
Njanpop-Lafourcade et al., have previously suggested an
influence of the French colonial history based on the similarity of the predominant spoligotype pattern (SB0944)
in Cameroon to the BCG-like spoligotype pattern that is
commonly seen in strains from France [15]. In a similar
manner it is possible to suggest that strains of M. bovis
with spoligotype pattern SB0134 were originally imported
from Europe. If both assumptions are true this would suggest that either M. bovis was not present in the Central or
West African region before introduction from Europe to
Africa or previously existing "native" M. bovis strains have
been largely replaced.
Due to the small sample size, the limited survey period
and the sampling at only one study location, the M. bovis
strains collected cannot reflect the country-wide bacterial
population structure. Therefore, frequencies of strains
with a specific spoligotype may not necessarily mirror the
actual frequency of these strains in the population
although more frequent strains are also more likely to be
detected in a random sample. Moreover, other groups of
M. bovis strains than the two that were observed may be
present in Mali. However, due to the predominant long

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/26

distance transhumant livestock production system, we
believe that the slaughter cattle encountered at the abattoir of Bamako and consequently their associated M. bovis
strains, represent a sample from a large area of the country.

Conclusion
This study presents the first molecular characterisation of
M. bovis strains from Mali. The results suggest that the
most often detected strains are related to strains that are
prevalent in Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria. A second
group of strains shows spoligotype patterns similar to
those abundant in mainland Europe and could have been
imported directly from Europe or via Northern Africa. Our
results can serve as a baseline study for future comparisons with strains from other areas in and around Mali.

Methods
Sample collection
Samples were collected from a sequential series of slaughter cattle at the Bamako abattoir, Mali in March and April
2007. The cattle population consisted of crossbreeds
between N'Dama, zebu and exotic breeds. The origin of
the cattle could not be traced due to poor documentation
and multiple selling-on of the animals before slaughter.
However, we originally assumed that the cattle originate
from the peri-urban region of Bamako as well as the principle areas of cattle production throughout the country.
After slaughter, animals underwent a standard meat
inspection and organs showing gross visible lesions were
confiscated. No ethical clearance was required for this
study because it was done on slaughtered animals and
organ confiscation was part of a routine monitoring. Tissue samples of 60 animals with gross visible lesions were
collected. The samples were transported on ice to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Bamako. Upon arrival, samples were immediately liberated from connective tissue
and fat under a bio-safety cabinet and by use of sterile dissection instruments. The samples were seared on the outside in order to reduce superficial contamination, sealed
into sterile stomacher bags and stored at -20°C for maximum one and a half months until they were shipped to
Switzerland for culture. Because of frequent power cuts we
cannot exclude that some of the specimen might have
undergone multiple freeze-thaw cycles while they were
stored. Shipment to Switzerland occurred in a refrigerated
box; the temperature of the samples was monitored at all
times by use of a data-logger (HoboTemp by OnsetCorp)
and never exceeded -10°C.
Tissue preparation, culture and DNA extraction
At the Swiss Reference Centre for Mycobacteria, samples
were stored at -80°C until processed. Specimen were dissected and approximately 2 g were homogenised for 2
minutes in 10 ml phosphate buffer saline (PBS) using the

ULTRA-TURRAX® Tube Drive homogeniser with DT-20
tubes (IKA, Staufen, Germany). A 5 ml aliquot of the suspension was decontaminated for 15 minutes with 5 ml of
decontamination solution (0.5% N-acetyl-L-cystein/2%
NaOH/1.45% Na-Citrate solution). The decontamination
was stopped by addition of 15 ml PBS, the suspension was
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 minutes and the pellet was
re-suspended in 2 ml PBS. Then, 0.5 ml of the suspension
was added to a BBL™ MGIT™ Mycobacterium Growth
Indicator Tube containing OADC enrichment and
PANTA™ antibiotic mixture (BD) and incubated in a
BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 Mycobacterial Detection System. In
addition, 0.25 ml of the suspension was inoculated onto
Löwenstein-Jensen and 7H10 culture media and incubated at 37°C. Cultures were incubated until growth was
detected or for at least 8 weeks. Presence of Acid-Fast
Bacilli was tested by Ziehl-Neelson staining and Microscopy and DNA of positive cultures was extracted using the
InstGene™ Matrix (Bio-Rad®).

Molecular characterisation
Spoligotyping was conducted as previously described
[13]. VNTR typing was performed according to the
method of Frothingham et al. [24] with adaptations
described elsewhere [33]. According to the findings of
Brosch et al., strains were confirmed as M. bovis by the
absence of region RD4. [34]. The 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing was carried out as described by
Zucol et al., (2006) [35]. Species identification was carried
out by comparison with the sequences of the SmartGene
Integrated Database Network System (IDNS™) 3.4.0.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Intercooled Stata
9.2 for Windows (StataCorp LP, USA). The association
between the presence of lesions in each organ and confirmed M. bovis infection was tested by a chi-squared test.
