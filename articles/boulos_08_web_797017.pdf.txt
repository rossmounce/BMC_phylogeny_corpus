Abstract
'Mashup' was originally used to describe the mixing together of musical tracks to create a new piece
of music. The term now refers to Web sites or services that weave data from different sources
into a new data source or service. Using a musical metaphor that builds on the origin of the word
'mashup', this paper presents a demonstration "playlist" of four geo-mashup vignettes that make use
of a range of Web 2.0, Semantic Web, and 3-D Internet methods, with outputs/end-user interfaces
spanning the flat Web (two-dimensional – 2-D maps), a three-dimensional – 3-D mirror world
(Google Earth) and a 3-D virtual world (Second Life ®). The four geo-mashup "songs" in this
"playlist" are: 'Web 2.0 and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for infectious disease
surveillance', 'Web 2.0 and GIS for molecular epidemiology', 'Semantic Web for GIS mashup', and
'From Yahoo! Pipes to 3-D, avatar-inhabited geo-mashups'. It is hoped that this showcase of
examples and ideas, and the pointers we are providing to the many online tools that are freely
available today for creating, sharing and reusing geo-mashups with minimal or no coding, will
ultimately spark the imagination of many public health practitioners and stimulate them to start
exploring the use of these methods and tools in their day-to-day practice. The paper also discusses
how today's Web is rapidly evolving into a much more intensely immersive, mixed-reality and
ubiquitous socio-experiential Metaverse that is heavily interconnected through various kinds of
user-created mashups.

Background
GIS (Geographic Information Systems and Science) have
always shared many of the foundational ethea (plural of
ethos) of Web 2.0 [1], (even before the latter became
known as a distinct entity), namely data sharing, remixing
and repurposing, and collaboration. GIS enable remixing
and repurposing of data by "mashing-up" various data

and map layers or themes from multiple sources into one
study/map (with multiple layers covering same locations
superimposed like onion's skin). And now with the
advent of Web 2.0 technologies, the democratization and
participatory nature of GIS have never been more possible
or powerful. Neogeography and the GeoWeb 2.0 have
been born and unleashed for use by the masses [2,3]!

On mashups and their growing popularity and importance
'Mashup' was originally used to describe the mixing
together of musical tracks to create a new piece of music
[4]. The term now refers to Web sites or services that weave
data from different sources into a new data source or service. Mashups are becoming increasingly widespread, especially in the context of combining geographic data and
displaying such integrated data on maps. Web-based
mapping applications like Google Maps [5] and Google
Earth [6] allow multiple independently generated datasets
encoded using the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format to be mixed and displayed via a two-dimensional – 2D map (or three-dimentional – 3-D globe in the case of
Google Earth) [7]. The latest offerings from Google Maps,
namely My Maps [8] and Mapplets [9], have made it possible for anyone to create and share their own interactive
online maps with just a few mouse clicks and no (or
almost no) coding at all! (With Google Mapplets, anyone
can tap into, remix and reuse third-party mini-applications for Google Maps (known as Mapplets) from a rapidly expanding catalogue maintained by Google, to create
and share even more powerful personal maps.)

Many scientists have also utilized these technologies for
research purposes [10]. For example, Nature has created its
own geo-mashup using Google Earth for tracking avianflu outbreaks [11], and HealthMap [12], developed by the
Children's Hospital Informatics Program in Boston,
brings together disparate data sources within Google
Maps to achieve a unified and comprehensive view of the
current global state of infectious diseases and their effect
on human and animal health. This freely available Web
site integrates outbreak data of varying reliability, ranging
from news sources (e.g., Google News [13]) to curated
personal accounts (e.g., ProMED [14]) to more valid alerts
(e.g., World Health Organization [15]). Other public
health mashup work can be browsed at [16]. These examples represent a class of Web-based neogeography applications that combine the complex techniques of
cartography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
and place them within reach of users [17]. The benefit of
such easy-to-use GIS applications is evident in an increasing diversity and quantity of publicly available geocoded
health data and a growing interest in using GIS and other
Web-based tools for mashup of public health data.
It is therefore not surprising but rather commendable that
the UK government has recently launched a data mashup
competition to find innovative ways of using the masses
of data it collects [18]. The government is hoping to find
new uses for public information in the areas of criminal
justice, health and education, and is opening up gigabytes
of information for this purpose from a variety of sources
like mapping information from Britain's Ordnance Survey, medical information from the NHS (National Health

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/7/1/38

Service), and neighbourhood statistics from the Office for
National Statistics. (None of the data is personal information.)
How mashups work – the basic principles
Over the last few years, the complexity and magnitude of
research data with advances in genomic sequencing and
translational science have increased the need for complex
mashup applications. One possible solution is Web 2.0, a
term that describes the rising global trend in use of World
Wide Web technology and Web design in the past few
years, and represents applications that aim to enhance creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among
users. Web 2.0 comprises online services that promote
interaction between users and cooperative development
of Web resources [1,19]. These technologies, tools, and
sites can be broadly categorized as follows:
• Data formatter
The contents provided by different Web sites are organized and displayed in many different ways. The traditional
approach to extracting Web content and reformatting it is
to write specific screen-scraping programs to extract content from specific sites. This approach is not scalable given
the high degree of heterogeneity involved. Also, it requires
a significant amount of programming effort. To address
this, tools such as Dapper [20] provide the user with the
ability to visually map the Web content to a particular
structure. In addition, these tools allow the extracted content to be output in different formats such as RSS (Really
Simple Syndication – described in [2]). These tools ease
the effort of content extraction and formatting over the
Web [21].
• Data connector
To facilitate mashup of data provided by different sites in
different formats, tools such as Yahoo! Pipes [22] have
been developed to allow users to graphically create a Pipe
or workflow to connect data including those generated by
other tools like Dapper. Such tools can directly accept data
in different formats and integrate them. The integrated
data can be formatted in different ways for analysis purposes [21].
• Data visualization
Once multiple datasets are parsed or integrated in a common format, tools are available for visualizing data in an
integrated fashion. For example, Yahoo! Pipes can be used
to integrate and format geo-referenced data into the KML
format for visualization by Google Maps or Google Earth
[23].
• Data sharing
One important aspect of Web 2.0 is data sharing and community collaboration. For example, Dapper and Yahoo!

International Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:38

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/7/1/38

Pipes both contain collaboration forums in which users
can view and utilize the work of others. In the context of
GIS, Web 2.0 sites such as GeoCommons [24] allow georeferenced data (e.g., KML files) to be tagged, shared,
reused, and remixed [21].
• Web API
Another key part of the Web 2.0 trend features the growing use of various Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for developers to build rich client
applications that can programmatically access online services such as Google Maps and GeoCommons. Such Web
APIs allow existing functionalities to be reused. For example, using the GeoIQ JavaScript API provided by GeoCommons [25], one can develop client applications that
include content such as heat maps, concentration indices,
or intersection indices in custom data [21].

These Web 2.0 technologies, tools, and services, in conjunction with neogeography applications such as Google
Maps and Google Earth, can support public health
research, including infectious disease surveillance and
molecular epidemiology. They reduce the onus of the
public health expert to write complex programming code
to perform data integration. They also promote data sharing and community collaboration. Whether the purpose
is to analyze historical trends of data over time or to detect
disease anomalies in real-time, Web 2.0 technology can
easily integrate numerical and spatial data for public
health decision support.
Using a musical metaphor that builds on the origin of the
word 'mashup', this paper will present a demonstration
"playlist" of four practical geo-mashup example and idea
sets that make use of a range of Web 2.0, Semantic Web,
and 3-D Internet methods, with outputs/end-user interfaces spanning the flat Web (2-D maps), a 3-D mirror
world (Google Earth) and a 3-D virtual world (Second
Life ®).

A demo "playlist"
Mashup song #1: Web 2.0 and GIS for infectious disease
surveillance
Web 2.0 can be utilized along with GIS for infectious disease surveillance. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram for development of a Web 2.0 mashup application for West Nile
Virus (WNV) surveillance. The first step involves the use of
Dapper [20] to obtain WNV data from the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) Web site [26]. The data contains the number of WNV cases per each state for animals
(such as horses and birds), humans, and mosquitoes. The
second step involves geo-referencing the data by using
Yahoo! Pipes [22] to mashup the WNV case data with
GeoCommons [24], a Web 2.0 mapping service.

Figure 1
Web 2.0 for public health research
Web 2.0 for public health research.

The ability to mashup and integrate Web-based surveillance data lies with the fact that Yahoo! Pipes contains
functions to retrieve data streams, store them locally as a
list, perform iterative loops, string functions, regular
expressions, Web services, and geo-referencing. Figure 2
shows the corresponding Yahoo! Pipe for the mashup of
WNV surveillance data.
Finally, a Web 2.0 mashup can support complex calculations that are often required in epidemiology and infectious disease surveillance. For example, temperature is a
significant factor in the transmission of many vectorborne diseases. In our West Nile Virus example, higher
temperatures enable for the Extrinsic Incubation Period
(EIP) to be completed within the mosquito, which indicates that the virus reaches infectivity and can be transmitted to a susceptible host such as a human, bird, or horse
[27]. Scientists need to track temperature data and calculate measures such as 'degree days' [28] to determine
whether the temperature supports virus transmission.

Degree days can be calculated using sine methods [28]
and may be too difficult to compute using GIS. Web 2.0
supports the integration of Web resources to perform such
calculations and combine the results with geo-referenced
data for WNV surveillance. Our Yahoo! Pipe (Figure 2)
fetches temperature data from the National Climate Data
Center Web site [29]. The output of Yahoo! Pipes can be a
KML file for display in Google Earth (Figure 3) or Google
Maps. In this example, weather stations are shown with '+'
to indicate that the 2005 summer temperature in the area
supports the risk of West Nile Virus transmission. Numbers of positive bird and human WNV cases in 2005 are
also shown.
Mashup song #2: Web 2.0 and GIS for molecular
epidemiology
Web 2.0 can also support the mashup of molecular information in GIS. For example, phylogenetic analysis

through the use of tree generation software has recently
been integrated in Google Earth [30]. The project called
TreeBASE II enables for scientists to analyze genetic distances across different isolates and subtypes, and harnesses Google Earth to deliver biological information
with a geographic component [31] (Figure 4).
Another resource for mashup of molecular data is the
Mesquite Project [32]. The modular system promotes collaboration among scientists to develop their own programs or modules and then upload the modules for other
programmers to utilize and enhance. This mashup
approach enables modules to be attached to other modules for creation of a hybrid module. There is great potential for GIS to be included as a module for Mesquite in as
much the same way that TreeBase II presents trees within
GIS.

GeoRSS can be viewed as an application of RDF (Resource
Description Framework), since RSS 1.0 is a language of
RDF. RDF is part of a broader technology called 'Semantic
Web' [33-35], which is a set of recommendations and
specifications supported by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [36]. The Semantic Web emphasizes common formats and languages for semantic interoperability.
For example, RDF enables for the integration and combination of data drawn from diverse sources. This is an
enhancement from the original Web which emphasized
the interchange of documents. The Semantic Web also
supports languages such as SPARQL (a recursive acronym
that stands for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language), which can be used to express queries across
diverse data sources, whether the data are stored natively
as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware. SPARQL is
much suited for recording how Web content relates to real
world objects. This allows a Web reference, such as a person, or a machine, to start off in one database, and then
move through an unending set of databases which are
connected not by wires but by relationships.

Since our demo "playlist" was created based on the original concept of "musical mashup", it is also very possible
for these separately-composed "songs" to be remixed; for
example, different species of mosquitoes carrying the
WNV (see "Mashup song #1" above) can be queried
semantically (ontologically – see "Mashup song #3"
below), studied using the geo-phylogenetic tree ("Mashup
song #2"), and visualized/interacted with in an avatarinhabited 3-D virtual world environment (see "Mashup
song #4" below).
Mashup song #3: Semantic Web for GIS mashup
Despite the emergence of Web 2.0 tools like Yahoo! Pipes
and standard geo-data formats like KML, the task of identifying and integrating datasets of interest must be manually done by people. 'Semantic mashup' is a conception in
which computers help humans discover and integrate
data. A semantically-enriched machine readable format is
needed for implementing the vision of semantic mashup.
GeoRSS (an extension of RSS) is a step in this direction
[2]. While a regular RSS feed is used to describe feeds
(channels) of Web content such as news articles, Web content consisting of geographical elements such as latitudes
and longitudes can be described using GeoRSS. Like RSS
feeds that are consumed by feed readers and aggregators,
GeoRSS feeds are designed to be consumed by geographic
software such as map generators.

The use of ontologies, or formal representations of concepts and their relationships, has been a popular method
for supporting complex knowledge representation in the
Semantic Web [34,35]. For example, an expressive ontology language called the Web Ontology Language (OWL)
is now a W3C recommendation [37]. OWL-based ontologies can support sophisticated queries as well as machine
reasoning and inferencing. The GeoNames Ontology [38]
is an example of geo-ontology available in OWL format. It
is part of GeoNames [39], which is a database integrating
geographical data such as names of places in various languages, elevation, population and other features from various sources. The GeoNames Ontology makes it possible
to add geospatial semantic information to the Web. The
ontology distinguishes the 'Concept' from the 'Document'. For example, the town Embrun in France is associated with two URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers): [40]
and [41]. The first URI [40] identifies the town Embrun in
France. The second URI [41] is the RDF document with
the information GeoNames has about Embrun. The
GeoNames Web server is configured to redirect requests
for the first URI to the second URI. The redirection tells
Semantic Web Agents that Embrun is not residing on the
GeoNames server but that GeoNames has information
about it instead.
The elements in the GeoNames ontology are semantically
interlinked with each other in the following ways:
• Children
These include countries for a continent, subdivisions, etc.
For example, the children of France include Auvergne
(province) and Lorraine (administrative region).

• Neighbours
These are neighbouring countries for a given country. For
example, Switzerland and Germany are neighbours of
France.
• Nearby features
For example, nearby the Eiffel Tower are Champ de Mars
and Trocadéro – Palais de Chaillot.

Given such an expressive geo-ontology, location-based
inferencing may be performed when mashing up geo-data
corresponding to different levels of granularity. For example, given the parent-child relationship, data corresponding to a city can be integrated with the state/province in
which it is located. In addition to geo-data mashup,
semantic mashup can occur between different types of
ontologies, including geo-ontologies and bio-ontologies
(e.g., Gene Ontology [42] and Sequence Ontology [43]),
and others (Figure 5 – [34,35]).
While machine-readable/machine-understandable data
are essential to semantic mashup, most current Web con-

tent is only human readable. To bridge the gap between
human readability and machine readability, RDFa (RDF
attributes) [44] has been proposed to incorporate Semantic Web methods (RDF) into Web pages (i.e., into HTML
– the HyperText Markup Language). RDFa provides a set
of HTML attributes to augment visual data with machinereadable contexts. In addition to RDFa, the GRDDL
(Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages) specification [45] introduces markup based on
existing standards for declaring that an XML (eXtensible
Markup Language) document includes data compatible
with RDF and for linking to algorithms (typically represented in XSLT – eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations [46]).
Mashup song #4: from Yahoo! Pipes to 3-D, avatarinhabited geo-mashups
Like the first "song" in this "playlist", this "song" also
starts in Yahoo! Pipes [22]. Yahoo! Pipes offers thousands
of ready and free-to-use Pipes like the 'RSS 2 Geo' Pipe
[47], which we were able to use to geo-encode and map
the 'Latest articles' RSS feed from the International Journal

some details about Daden's "port" of Google Maps into
Second Life.

of Health Geographics [48] as shown in Figure 6, without
doing any coding or modification to the Pipe or to our
RSS feed. Pipes can also be 'cloned', i.e., imported to one's
account in Yahoo! Pipes, and then edited or remixed (as
sub-pipes) in an intuitive, Web-based visual Pipe editor
(Figures 2 and 7), to create and publish modified or more
complex Pipes and mashups [49,50].
We cloned two publicly available, community-user-contributed Pipes originally created to map the latest news
stories from Yahoo! and Reuters, with the goal of editing
them to make them more specialized, so that they only
map the latest health news items from Yahoo! and Reuters.
The modified Pipes are available at [51]. They use the
GeoNames RSS-to-GeoRSS Web service [39] to add location information to Yahoo! and Reuters' 'health' RSS
newsfeeds (Figure 7). The results are then displayed using
the Yahoo! Maps AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML) API [52], thanks to Yahoo! Pipes' Location Extractor
module [53].
The Location Extractor module processes the GeoRSS output from GeoNames to map it in 2-D using Yahoo! Maps.
The GeoRSS output from GeoNames is a URI [54], as can
be seen in Figure 7. This URI can also be used outside
Yahoo! Pipes, e.g., to map the GeoRSS feed on Google
Maps instead of Yahoo! Maps [55], so we thought of feeding it into a "port" (by Daden Ltd [56]) of Google Maps in
the 3-D virtual world of Second Life (SL) [57]. Figure 8
shows how the final output looks in Second Life. The

In March 2008, Linden Lab released a new version of Second Life, which for the first time let users display a Web
page on the side of an object (or 'prim' as it is called in SL)
within the world [58]. This was done using the same
media channel that SL currently uses to display images
and videos, and so was still restricted to one "page" per
parcel, but it was at least a step forward. (A 'parcel' here
refers to a circumscribed plot of virtual land in SL, with its
own owner-customisable characteristics and settings.)
However, the implementation does have two significant
drawbacks:
• The page is not interactive, i.e., you cannot click on links
in it; and
• You cannot scroll down or across the page.
Given our earlier work with maps in SL [2], we were interested to see how effective this new feature would be with
Google Maps. Placing the URI of any Web page showing
Google Maps rendered well within Second Life, but one
could not zoom or pan on the map since the page was not
interactive.
In order to achieve this interactivity we built a small 'controller' within Second Life, and a simple Google Maps
page generator on the Web. When first touched the controller sets the parcel URI to the URI of the page generator.
The page generator, (effectively being called by SL to produce a Web page), generates a plain Web page consisting
of a default whole-Earth map, and this is then rendered by
the new SL Web page functionality on an object (a 10 m ×
10 m square prim was used initially, but we also successfully used a 20 m diameter mega-prim). The controller
sets variables for a default latitude/longitude of 0 degrees,
and a default zoom of 15 (the further out that Google
Maps goes). If the user then presses the 'zoom in' button
on the controller (not on the Google Map), then the controller changes the CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
parameter list on the URI to the new zoom value, which
the generator script then uses with the Google Maps API
to create a new zoomed-in page. In this way, all the standard Google Maps functionality of zoom in/out, pan and
even 'Map', 'Satellite' and 'Hybrid' overlays was implemented in-world (Figure 9), with the controller tracking
the state of the parameters and then sending them as CGI
parameters to the page generator to create the relevant
page.
The next challenge was how to represent data on Google
Maps. Using our Newsglobe application [2], we could eas-

ily produce Google Maps with geocoded RSS or KML data
overlaid as markers using the Google Maps API. However,
although we could bring the map with markers image into
SL using the process above, we could not then click on the
markers to interrogate them (e.g., link out to the relevant
news story or data reading). The solution was to bring the
data itself into SL alongside the map (in a similar way to
our Los Angeles aircraft visualisation described in [2]).
Now, when a map with data is requested, the controller
and page generator create the map in the standard way –
with or without markers – but the controller also directly
requests the data feed via a Web proxy which captures

(and if necessary geocodes) the data from the RSS/KML
feed and then passes them back into SL in a simple text
format. The controller then uses these data to rez (SL term
for 'resolve') a Second Life object (e.g., a map pin) at each
location, and with each map pin hyperlinked back to the
Web page containing the relevant item/story. If the user
then zooms or pans the map, the controller de-rezzes the
pins and then re-rezzes them in their new spatial position
to reflect the zoom/pan, without having to re-request the
data. A bounding box is applied to ensure that markers are
not plotted well beyond the map. Given the 2048-byte
limit on data coming in to SL, we typically also restrict the

structure management, health and other fields. Using the
above-mentioned Google Maps system in SL, it was relatively easy to zoom in on the city, augment the view with
2-D photos brought in by the Flickr API [59], news stories
and Web sites from geocoded RSS feeds, and even some
bespoke 360 degree panoramas keyed to particular locations on the map (Figure 11).

• For the rest of the city they took the map image and used
an image editor to make all the road and open spaces
transparent. They then mapped this image onto a transparent object of the same size as the map in Second Life.
They then stacked 5–7 layers of this on top of the map.
The result was a pseudo-3-D effect, where the buildings
show as if rising above the main map, but the open spaces
are left at "ground" level (Figure 10).
For us this is just an initial step towards better 3-D mapping in Second Life – and better Web integration. Once
Linden Lab release a full Web browser in Second Life
(probably in 2009) then Daden's current approach will
not necessarily be needed, although it does create a 3-D
representation of the markers (pins), which no browseronly solution can easily achieve. It also certainly will not
create the 3-D building models (without proper in-world
support of specialist Web-browser plug-ins), so we think
Daden's system will have significant longevity. Particular
areas for enhancement, which Daden might wish to work
on, include:
• Moving and scaling the 3-D objects as one zooms;

However, Daden also wanted to give a sense of the city in
3-D. They used two techniques to achieve this:

• Creating a separate and unique 3-D "layer" for each
height "slice" within the city, enabling a truer representation of the city height profile to be obtained; and
• Importing Google Earth COLLADA models [60] for the
individual 3-D buildings (COLLADA stands for COLLAborative Design Activity, an interchange file format for
interactive 3-D applications).

Other tools
In addition to the above-mentioned tools like Yahoo!
Pipes [22] and Google Mapplets [9], which can be used
for creating and publishing geo-mashups with little or no
coding at all, there exist other equally effective ones worth
exploring by interested readers to find out which tool (or
combination of tools – or "instruments", to keep the
musical metaphor going) works best for them and better
serves their particular settings and purposes. For example,
Google is now also providing Google Mashup Editor [61],
an AJAX development framework and a set of tools that
enable developers to quickly and easily create simple Web
applications and mashups with Google services like

Google Maps. Similarly, Microsoft has an interesting
offering related to Yahoo! Pipes, which they call Microsoft
Popfly [62,63].
Popfly allows users to create and publish Web pages, program snippets, and mashups using the Microsoft Silverlight rich Internet applications (RIAs) runtime [64,65]
along with many pre-built 'Blocks' and data sources/services contributed by Microsoft and the user community,
including a Virtual Earth Block for map display based on
Microsoft Virtual Earth [66,67]. Blocks can be configured
and visually linked to other Blocks in Popfly's intuitive
Web-based editor, much like the visual "plumbing" in
Yahoo! Pipes (Figure 12 – [68]). User-friendly error
notices are given to users when incompatible data are
passed between Blocks. There is also an advanced view for
Blocks, which allows users to modify the underlying code

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/7/1/38

in JavaScript, if they wish. Silverlight has been ported to
Windows Mobile, and Nokia are to support it across a
range of devices. Also, in a rare move, Microsoft
announced Silverlight for Linux [69]. Adobe on the other
hand is pushing its cross-platform AIR (Adobe Integrated
Runtime) environment [70], which uses Adobe Flash,
Adobe Flex, HTML, and AJAX to build RIAs.
What's next: beyond Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web and
towards the 3-D Internet and the ultimate Metaverse
The 'Google Maps/Earth in SL' tool described in "Mashup
song #4" above, with its ability to visualize GeoRSS news
and data feeds in the 3-D virtual world, is perhaps the first
realization of the futuristic vision described by Wade
Roush in [71]. However, Google Earth (the 3-D mirror
world application) remains, to this date, far more powerful than its "port" in Second Life, like many other special-

ist data visualization tools, a fact echoed in a recent
discussion of the topic by Paul Bourke [72]. For example,
Google Earth has COLLADA support but not SL [2,60].
But despite this, there continues to be something very special or "magical" about the current avatar-inhabited
Google Maps/Earth SL version by Daden (even with the
medium's many current limitations)!
Miklos Sarvary, Director of the Centre for Learning Innovation at INSEAD, has drawn parallels between the life
cycle of broadcasting and the Internet [73]: just as radio
gave way to the more immersive experience of TV, today's
flat Web sites will morph into more interactive, immersive
multi-user experiences in which users can see and interact
with each other in much more natural ways.
It is predicted that, within 5 to 7 years, the dominant
Internet interface is likely to be the 3-D 'Metaverse', a new
3-D Web that will gradually "absorb", and seamlessly
integrate with (not fully replace), today's World Wide
Web and its applications like Google Earth [2,74].
(Today's 3-D virtual worlds are still rather early-stage technology and are yet to mature in order to fully realize this
vision of a new 3-D Web.)
Today's flat Web allows us to call up "flat" information; a
3-D virtual environment allows us to more naturally experience and visualize this information in real-time with
others, and also to appreciate their presence around us.
Virtual worlds are such an appealing concept to users primarily because of the social 'co-presence' of others in
these worlds in a very realistic manner (Figure 10).
When people are browsing the flat Web shop of Amazon.com, for example, they cannot see, chat with, and
benefit from the experiences/opinions of, other people
looking for the same items in real time, as they would do
in a supermarket's aisle in the physical world. But with 3D virtual worlds this is very possible.
Although there are some very early flat Web co-browsing
solutions under development like Weblin ([75] – flat
interface) and YOOWALK ([76] – two-and-a-half dimensional – 2.5-D interface) that have attempted to bridge
this gap, they are not without their limitations, and it is
expected that they will only achieve their full potential
within 3-D online social/virtual worlds or the Metaverse
over the coming few years. But this can only happen after
the full 'HTML-on-a-prim' roadmap and vision [58], and
many other currently missing or seriously lacking key features and qualities (e.g., better usability, scalability and
cross-world interoperability) are properly developed and
fully realized in these 3-D worlds.

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/7/1/38

In their introductory description of their MPK20 3-D Virtual Workplace [77], Sun Microsystems wrote under a paragraph entitled 'Why 3-D for Collaboration' at [78]: "One
question we are frequently asked is why use 3-D for a collaboration environment? While it might be possible to build a 2-D
tool with functionality similar to MPK20, the spatial layout of
the 3-D world coupled with the immersive audio provides
strong cognitive cues that enhance collaboration. (...) In terms
of data sharing, looking at objects together is a natural activity.
With the 3-D spatial cues, each person can get an immediate
sense of what the other collaborators can and cannot see". (For
other compelling arguments about the value of data visualization and collaboration in 3-D virtual worlds, please
see [2,79,80].)
Humans are spatial beings by nature, inhabiting featurerich 3-D analogue spaces, so a 3-D synthetic space should
not be more cognitively demanding from a human-computer interface viewpoint compared to conventional flat
interfaces, if it is properly designed with usability in mind.
In fact, it could even make some presentations that are
overly complex in 2-D version much less complicated to
understand when ported to a more native 3-D environment.
Andrew Hudson-Smith and his team at the Centre for
Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College
London, have an extensive portfolio of GIS-related
projects in Second Life, including: (i) Virtual London, (ii)
a new approach to importing geographic terrains into Second Life as tabletops, and (iii) an Arc (ESRI) to Second
Life project. In their popular 'Digital Urban' blog where
these projects are described in detail [81], they frequently
refer to Google Earth and Second Life as 'Three Dimensional Collaborative (Multi-User) Geographic Information Systems'. Second Life and Google Earth (and the
related platforms that will definitely follow in the near
future, as 3-D mirror and virtual worlds merge [2]) are
indeed promising environments for public participation
and collaboration type outreach activities, providing a
good basis for a 'layered 3-D Wikipedia of the planet that
anyone can edit and add to' or what can be referred to as
'The People's Atlas'. (Participatory GIS (PGIS) or Public
Participation GIS (PPGIS) are terms that have been coined
to express the adoption of GIS to broaden public involvement in policymaking, and thus empower local communities, especially the less privileged groups in society, who
are often ignored in traditional government-oriented and
run GIS applications.)
The 3-D Internet is also rapidly becoming a strategic European Commission (EC) research direction, with, for
example, the recent establishment of three Working
Groups (WGs) within a User Centric Media (UCM) cluster
of 15 ongoing EC-funded projects in the area of Net-

worked Media Systems: the Personalized & Creative
Media WG, the 3D & Immersive Media WG, and the
Future Media Internet WG [82].
However, we do appreciate that, for some (especially in
the corporate domain), the public nature of a world like
Second Life may be a barrier to adoption; despite the protection that one can put in place, the core data still goes
through a third party server. However, IBM and Linden
Lab are currently closely working on suitable solutions for
this [83]. Moreover, recent months have seen significant
developments in the OpenSim/Open Source SL-"compatible" platform and grids [84]. OpenSim lets users build
worlds (and visualizations) on their own PC (Personal
Computer) and servers, opened up only to the people
they want and allow to access their worlds. In fact, one can
now develop one's own spaces offline, publish them on
any suitable offline digital storage medium, or host one's
own live region/server on the Internet. These Open Source
developments, coupled with recent work on an emerging
'MPEG-V for Virtual Worlds' ISO standard [85], can only
lead to wider penetration of 3-D virtual worlds among
online users and speed-up the development of interoperability specifications and protocols between these worlds
[86].
Google's recent entry into the 3-D virtual worlds marketplace [87], as well as the availability of 3-D virtual worlds
like Second Life on 3G (third generation) and WiFi enabled mobile phones and other small mobile devices,
which is a reality today, thanks to an amazing and very
well executed technology from Israel-based Vollee Ltd
[88-90], and the novel and more natural 3-D world navigation devices and modalities that are emerging these
days [91,92], will also serve to further expedite the mass
penetration of 3-D virtual worlds among Internet users
and the development of the next-generation 3-D Internet
or Metaverse.
We believe that with the passage from the flat informational Web to the full 3-D experiential Web [82], which
will ultimately happen over the next decade or so [93], a
new Web will (have to) gradually emerge that combines
the strengths of both the social Web 2.0 and the Semantic
Web of today (Figure 13 – [1,94]), while also overcoming
some of their respective weaknesses or deficiencies (e.g.,
the search and information retrieval problems in the
social Web 2.0, with its "uncontrolled" or "loose" folksonomies and not uncommonly Lemmings-like 'wisdom
of the crowds'; the apparent complexity, relative "restrictiveness" and "over formalism"/inaccessibility (from the
viewpoint of ordinary end-users) of Semantic Web methods; and the increasingly non-textual nature of the Web,
which presents many search/information retrieval and
personalization challenges). These weaknesses or defi-

Davis, Project10X.

ciencies can only become more problematic in a future,
much more media-rich experiential Internet, if not properly addressed in the next-generation Web X.0 or
Metaverse.

Conclusion
The Web is still 'work-in-progress'. Nevertheless, over the
past 5–7 years, Internet GIS has gradually transformed forever the way we approach and analyze geographic information, and has also changed the audience, both
producers and consumers, of this information, making it
today available to, and editable/remixable by, the wide
masses, opening up the possibility of many new applications, and realizing the visions of community or 'Participatory GIS' and of the democratization or 'wikification' of
GIS, or what has been called 'consumer health geoinformatics' [7].
Today, many online mapping applications exist where
people can even add their own individual data to a shared
Web map, e.g., 'Who is Sick?' [95,96]. And not just this,
but also now users can dynamically overlay on similarly
shared maps their own current position on Earth, and also
view the position of others who have likewise shared their
position, all in real-time over the Web, if they have, for
example, a low-cost USB GPS (Universal Serial Bus Global
Positioning System) mouse receiver or similar device connected to their PC or built into their mobile gadgets. GPSenabled mobile phones and GPS-enabled cameras are
enabling millions of people every day to collectively
annotate the Earth in ways never done before, besides

opening up many mobile location-based service possibilities and opportunities.
All of this is now possible and accessible like never before,
thanks to the latest breed of 'neogeography' and 'GeoWeb
2.0' technologies and online services like Google Earth (a
3-D mirror world) and Yahoo! Pipes (a visual mashup creation and publishing service), but also not without its
own newly introduced "problems" like copyright, individual privacy and even national security issues, all of which
were not much the case when GIS was once very 'closed'
and only the realm of big organizations and an elite of
experts. We have previously discussed these side-effect
issues and others in [2,7,21,74,79], but there is one more
that seems very suitable for closing an article about geomashups.
The many easy-to-use online interfaces and visual mashup
editors that are now available have increased the risks of
wrong selection, manipulation and interpretation of data
in some scenarios. As discussed in [97], the ideal consumer tools of the future need to be fault-tolerant and
capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in
ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of
integrated or mashed-up data. This can be achieved by
using some form of "intelligent", goal-oriented online
health GIS wizards and mashup editors that are based on
robust statistical, epidemiological and other methods, so
that only valid results, maps and visualizations are
allowed and produced, even when unlearned users
attempt to select inappropriate settings or data for a particular analysis or geo-mashup.
