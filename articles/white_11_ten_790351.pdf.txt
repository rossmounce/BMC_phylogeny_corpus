Abstract
Background: Reconstructing the higher relationships of pulmonate gastropods has been difficult. The use of
morphology is problematic due to high homoplasy. Molecular studies have suffered from low taxon sampling.
Forty-eight complete mitochondrial genomes are available for gastropods, ten of which are pulmonates. Here are
presented the new complete mitochondrial genomes of the ten following species of pulmonates: Salinator
rhamphidia (Amphiboloidea); Auriculinella bidentata, Myosotella myosotis, Ovatella vulcani, and Pedipes pedipes
(Ellobiidae); Peronia peronii (Onchidiidae); Siphonaria gigas (Siphonariidae); Succinea putris (Stylommatophora);
Trimusculus reticulatus (Trimusculidae); and Rhopalocaulis grandidieri (Veronicellidae). Also, 94 new pulmonatespecific primers across the entire mitochondrial genome are provided, which were designed for amplifying entire
mitochondrial genomes through short reactions and closing gaps after shotgun sequencing.
Results: The structural features of the 10 new mitochondrial genomes are provided. All genomes share similar
gene orders. Phylogenetic analyses were performed including the 10 new genomes and 17 genomes from
Genbank (outgroups, opisthobranchs, and other pulmonates). Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood
analyses, based on the concatenated amino-acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding genes, produced the same
topology. The pulmonates are paraphyletic and basal to the opisthobranchs that are monophyletic at the tip of
the tree. Siphonaria, traditionally regarded as a basal pulmonate, is nested within opisthobranchs. Pyramidella,
traditionally regarded as a basal (non-euthyneuran) heterobranch, is nested within pulmonates. Several hypotheses
are rejected, such as the Systellommatophora, Geophila, and Eupulmonata. The Ellobiidae is polyphyletic, but the
false limpet Trimusculus reticulatus is closely related to some ellobiids.
Conclusions: Despite recent efforts for increasing the taxon sampling in euthyneuran (opisthobranchs and
pulmonates) molecular phylogenies, several of the deeper nodes are still uncertain, because of low support values as
well as some incongruence between analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes and those based on
individual genes (18S, 28S, 16S, CO1). Additional complete genomes are needed for pulmonates (especially for
Williamia, Otina, and Smeagol), as well as basal heterobranchs closely related to euthyneurans. Increasing the number
of markers for gastropod (and more broadly mollusk) phylogenetics also is necessary in order to resolve some of the
deeper nodes -although clearly not an easy task. Step by step, however, new relationships are being unveiled, such
as the close relationships between the false limpet Trimusculus and ellobiids, the nesting of pyramidelloids within
pulmonates, and the close relationships of Siphonaria to sacoglossan opisthobranchs. The additional genomes
presented here show that some species share an identical mitochondrial gene order due to convergence.

Background
Elucidating the higher phylogenetic relationships of pulmonate gastropods has remained difficult. A morphology-based phylogenetic analysis revealed a high level of
homoplasy and resulted in a poorly-resolved tree [1].
Molecular studies have been based on few individual
genes, essentially 18S, 28S, 16S, and COI data [2-5], or
few complete mitochondrial genomes [6-8].
Analyses based on individual gene sequences all provide
similar relationships (Figure 1) [2-5]: pulmonates are
monophyletic, but they include a few taxa not traditionally
classified as pulmonates (Acochlidia, traditionally regarded
as opisthobranchs, and Glacidorbidae and Pyramidelloidea,
traditionally regarded as basal heterobranchs); also,
opisthobranchs are paraphyletic, basal to pulmonates;
finally, the false limpet Siphonaria, traditionally regarded
as a pulmonate, is in some cases found to be more closely
related to opisthobranchs than pulmonates. In recent
years, taxon sampling has significantly increased in analyses utilizing individual genes: the largest data set (18S,
16S, and COI) established so far includes 79 species representing all major taxa of pulmonates [5].
Analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes
provide different phylogenetic relationships, at least for
the deep nodes [6-8]: pulmonates are paraphyletic, basal
to the monophyletic opisthobranchs; Siphonaria is nested
within the opisthobranchs. Taxon sampling is still limited
in analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes,
mainly because gastropod mitochondrial genomes are
still difficult to obtain. Since the first complete gastropod

Page 2 of 15

mitochondrial genome was published in 1995 [9], 48
complete genomes have been made available (Figure 2).
The use of shotgun sequencing and the decrease in
sequencing costs caused a noticeable increase in the production of gastropod mitochondrial genomes a few years
ago (Figure 2). Ten genomes became available in nine
different publications between 1995 and 2006; since
2008, 38 genomes became available, 30 of which
appeared in only four publications [6,8,10,11], although a
few papers with only one genome were also published.
At present, Opisthobranchia and Neogastropoda (one
of the lineages of Caenogastropoda) are the taxa for
which the largest number of complete mitochondrial
genomes are available, with 17 and 12 genomes, respectively (Figure 2). Ten genomes are available for pulmonates (including two unpublished), but only some of the
pulmonate higher clades are represented. The taxon
sampling for the other gastropods is either insufficient
(Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, basal
caenogastropods, and basal heterobranchs) or missing
(Cocculiniformia).
In the present study, we report 10 new, complete,
mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates, with a special
focus on lineages that were poorly or not sampled
(Figure 2, Table 1): Salinator rhamphidia (Amphiboloidea); Auriculinella bidentata, Myosotella myosotis, Ovatella vulcani, and Pedipes pedipes (Ellobiidae); Peronia
peronii (Onchidiidae); Siphonaria gigas (Siphonariidae);
Succinea putris (Stylommatophora); Trimusculus reticulatus (Trimusculidae); and Rhopalocaulis grandidieri

pulmonate-specific primers spanning the entire mitochondrial genome and specifically designed for the
present study. These new primers were combined

simultaneous, short reactions. This direct approach was
of great help for amplifying mitochondrial genomes in

Results
Genome structural features

The structural features of each of the 10 mitochondrial
genomes sequenced in this study are summarized in
Table 2. Each genome consists of 13 protein-coding
genes, two rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. The genomes vary in size from 13, 968 bp (Peronia peronii) to 16,
708 bp (Pedipes pedipes) with most in the range of 14,
000 bp. In all 10 genomes, 13 of the 37 genes are coded
on the minus strand: trnQ, trnL2, atp8, trnN, atp6, trnR,
trnE, rrnS, trnM, nad3, trnS2, trnT, and cox3. In Succinea
putris, trnY and trnW are also coded on the minus
strand, as well as trnH in Siphonaria gigas. In the majority of the protein-coding genes (59 of 130), the start

codon is TTG. Alternatively, the start codon is either
ATG (43), GTG (17), ATT (6), ATA (3), CTG (1), or
TTA (1). The stop codon is either TAA (52), TAG (41),
T (36), or TA (1), none of which is used solely for a particular protein-coding gene.
All 10 mitochondrial genomes have adjacent overlapping genes, typically 11 to 12 genes; the highest number
(15) of overlapping genes is found in Peronia peronii and
the fewest number (7) is found in Pedipes pedipes, which
is likely correlated with genome size. The amount of
overlap between genes is typically between 1 and 30 bp.
Only one pair of overlapping genes is common to all 10
mitochondrial genomes: trnK, cox1 (5 to 8 bp). With the
exception of Pedipes pedipes, the other nine mitochondrial genomes all have nad6, nad5 (2 to 18 bp) overlapping and nad5, nad1 (14 to 26 bp) overlapping. The
largest overlaps in adjacent genes are 39 bp between
nad2, trnK in Succinea putris and 45 bp between nad4L,
cob in Auriculinella bidentata. The number of intergenic
spacers range from four in Peronia peronii to 20 in

Pedipes pedipes. The typical size of the intergenic spacers
varies from 1 to 80 bp. A large intergenic spacer (651 bp)
is found in Rhopalocaulis grandidieri between trnS1,
trnS2, and another one (270 bp) in Ovatella vulcani
between trnM, nad3. Of the 20 intergenic spacers found
in Pedipes pedipes, five of them are sizeable and AT-rich:
288 bp between nad6, nad5, 447 bp between trnS2, trnT,
397 bp between cox3, trnQ, 700 bp between trnR, trnS1,
and 317 between nad4, trnI. An AT-rich intergenic
spacer between cox3, trnI is found in all 10 mitochondrial
genomes, and this was determined to be the potential origin of replication (POR) which concurs with previous
findings [6]. Due to gene rearrangements, the POR for
Pedipes pedipes may be located between cox3, trnQ (397
bp) or between nad4, trnI (317 bp). The POR of Pedipes
pedipes is likely adjacent to the start of cox3 for two reasons. First, the percentage of A+T in the 50 bp adjacent
to cox3 is higher than the 50 bp adjacent to trnI (62.0%
and 58.8%, respectively). Second, a POR adjacent to cox3
was previously found in other gastropod mitochondrial
genomes [10].

The 22 tRNAs for each of the 10 mitochondrial genomes were easily located, with the exception of trnS1 in
Rhopalocaulis grandidieri. Unlike the trnS1 of the other
nine mitochondrial genomes, the anticodon loop
sequence is CTGCTAG instead of the typical CTGCTAA
and there are two base mispairings in the anticodon loop,
which is also uncommon (region sequenced with a 4X
coverage). All of the trnS1 and trnS2 genes lack the DHU
stem.
Molecular phylogeny

The trees from the ML and Bayesian analyses share
identical topologies and similar branch lengths and node
support values (Figure 3). Pulmonates form a paraphyletic group at the base of the Euthyneura; Pyramidella
dolabrata, traditionally regarded as a basal heterobranch
external to Euthyneura, is nested within (paraphyletic)
pulmonates. Siphonaria, traditionally regarded as a basal
pulmonate, is nested within Opisthobranchia which
form a derived, monophyletic group at the tip of the
euthyneuran tree. The veronicellid slug Rhopalocaulis

using Mr Bayes in Topali. The ML bootstrap values indicated here are from the ML analysis performed with PhyML in Topali (MTRev+I+G, loglikelihood -99834.23). Alternative analyses provided similar topology, branch lengths, and support values.

grandidieri is the most basal species of the euthyneurans, with high node support. Freshwater snails Biomphalaria glabrata and Radix balthica form a clade emerging
just after Rhopalocaulis grandidieri. Land snails Succinea
putris and Albinaria coerulea form a clade emerging just
after the freshwater snails. The ellobiids (Pedipes pedipes, Myosotella myosotis, Ovatella vulcani, and Auriculinella bidentata) are not monophyletic and are spread
throughout the basal portion of the tree. However, the
false limpet Trimusculus reticulatus (Trimusculidae) is
recovered as closely related to two ellobiids (Ovatella
vulcani and Auriculinella bidentata), which is strongly
supported. The three species of onchidiids (Peronia peronii, Onchidella borealis, and Onchidella celtica) form a
highly-supported monophyletic group. Salinator rhamphidia (Amphiboloidea), traditionally regarded as a basal
pulmonate (mainly because of the presence of an operculum), is not basal with respect to all pulmonates.
Within the clade Opisthobranchia, Ascobulla fragilis is
found to be the most basal. AU and SH tests performed
indicate that other alternative hypotheses of monophyly
(Eupulmonata, Geophila, Ellobiidae, and Systellommatophora) are rejected (Table 3).
Some nodes are strongly supported, with Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1 and bootstrap values of 100%,
such as the monophyly of opisthobranchs (including
Siphonaria) and the monophyly of the clade including
Trimusculus and two ellobiids (Ovatella and Auriculinella). Some other nodes are still reasonably supported,
although less strongly, with Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1 and bootstrap values superior to 75%. However,
four of the deeper nodes display no statistical support,
with Bayesian posterior probabilities less than 0.8 and
bootstrap values less than to 50%. Those nodes, indicated
as thin lines in Figure 3, should be regarded as unresolved polytomies, which directly affects the interpretation of the relationships (see Discussion).

Genome organization and rearrangements

Biomphalaria glabrata, Salinator rhamphidia, Trimusculus reticulatus, Ovatella vulcani, Auriculinella bidentata, Peronia peronii, Onchidella borealis, Onchidella
celtica share an identical mitochondrial genome organization (Figure 4). Albinaria coerulea shares the same
genome organization except that the position of trnS1
and trnS2 are switched and trnS1 is inverted. The genome of the two freshwater snails Radix balthica and
Biomphalaria glabrata differ in the location of five
tRNAs (P, H, G, C, and Y). The genome of Rhopalocaulis grandidieri differs in the location of seven tRNAs (C,
F, G, W, H, L2, and E). The genome of Succinea putris
differs in the location of three tRNAs (F, Y, and W),
with the latter two genes being coded on the minus
strand instead of the plus strand. In Pedipes pedipes,
trnT, cox3 swapped with trnS1, nad4, and trnQ and
trnR moved between these two swapped sets of genes.
Myosotella myosotis only differs from the most standard
mitochondrial genome organization by the rearrangement of nad4L between cox2 and trnY. The location of
trnY before cox1 is a unique and unusual feature of the
mitochondrial genome of Pyramidella dolabrata. Other
attributes, such as the location of atp6 prior to atp8 and
the encoding of trnG by the minus strand, are exclusive
to Pyramidella dolabrata.
The opisthobranch genomes only differ from the common mitochondrial genome arrangement in the position
of trnY, trnW, and trnC. The trnC is located between
trnH and trnQ in Ascobulla fragilis, Chromodoris magnifica, and Berthellina ilisima, and between trnN and atp6
in Aplysia californica, Pupa strigosa, and Hydatina physis. The organization of the genome of Siphonaria gigas
is more similar to the genome of opisthobranchs than
pulmonates, which is also true for Siphonaria pectinata
despite some moderate rearrangements (e.g., trnY and
trnW are adjacent to nad4L).

Discussion
Species diversity of the pulmonate gastropods is largely
dominated by the land snails and slugs, or Stylommatophora, which include at least 25, 000 species. However,
less than five percent of the pulmonate species diversity is
found in the ten other higher taxa, which are anatomically
and ecologically very distinct from each other: Amphiboloidea, Ellobiidae, Hygrophila, Onchidiidae, Otinidae,
Siphonariidae, Smeagolidae, Trimusculidae, Veronicellidae, and Williamiidae. The present contribution constitutes a significant increase in taxon sampling for complete
mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates, especially regarding the non-stylommatophoran taxa (Figure 2, Table 1):
complete mitochondrial genomes of amphiboloids, trimusculids, veronicellids, and two ellobiid “subfamilies” (Pedipedinae and Ellobiinae) are presented here for the first
time. As of today, complete mitochondrial genomes are
unavailable for only three of the pulmonate higher taxa:
Otinidae (only one species known), Williamiidae (less than
10 species), and Smeagolidae (less than 10 species).

The topology of the consensus tree produced by our
phylogenetic analyses (Figure 3) is very similar to the trees
obtained previously based on all protein-coding genes of
the mitochondrial genomes [6,7]: pulmonates are paraphyletic, at the base of euthyneurans (opisthobranchs and pulmonates); opisthobranchs (including Siphonaria) are
monophyletic, at the tip of the tree. Pyramidella dolabrata, traditionally regarded as a basal heterobranch (outside euthyneurans), is more closely related to pulmonates.
Biomphalaria glabrata is found here to be at the base of
pulmonates [7] instead of at a more derived position in
the tree [6].
The trees based on mitochondrial genomes (Figure 3)
show some congruence with the trees based on individual
genes -18S, 28S, 16S, COI (Figure 1). In particular, both
data sets agree on some nodes that were unsuspected
before, such as the close relationship of Trimusculus reticulatus and ellobiids. However, both data sets also show
some noticeable differences. This might be explained by
the fact that some of the deeper nodes are poorly

White et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/295

supported by the mitochondrial AA data set presented
here (Figure 3). Also, the taxon sampling differs greatly:
nearly 80 species of pulmonates are included in a recent
analysis using 18S, 16S, and COI sequences [5] while
only 20 complete mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates
are available, including those generated in this study.
Below we discuss the impact of our phylogenetic results
on our understanding of the evolution of pulmonate gastropods. In particular, we focus on the new insights and
new questions raised by the addition of the 10 new mitochondrial genomes.
In the present results, the most basal lineage of all
euthyneurans are the terrestrial, veronicellid slugs, represented here by one species, Rhopalocaulis grandidieri
(Figure 3). Traditionally, Veronicellidae has been classified
in Systellommatophora, along with Onchidiidae and
Rathouisiidae [12], although no synapomorphies could be
found for systellomatophorans in cladistic analyses [1].
The representation of veronicellids in molecular analyses
is recent, but trees based on individual gene sequences
support the monophyly of Systellommatophora (Figure 1)
[4,5]. A basal position of veronicellids with respect to
other pulmonates was proposed based on morphology
[13,14]. However, this result was based on problematic
interpretations of the anatomy of systellommatophorans,
such as the fact that they supposedly lack a pneumostome
and a lung. If confirmed, a basal position of veronicellids
could lead us to re-interpret their extremely reduced pallial cavity. However, additional mitochondrial genomes of
veronicellids will be necessary for testing this new result,
because a single genome might introduce a bias (e.g.,
long-branch attraction) in the analyses.
Freshwater snails (here represented by Radix balthica
and Biomphalaria glabrata) are found to be among the
most basal lineages, although their relationships with
respect to Stylommatophora (here represented by Succinea
putris and Albinaria coerulea), are unclear. However, the
position of Hygrophila is still quite unstable and does vary
from one study to another [2,4,5]. For unclear reasons, our
attempts to get new complete genomes of freshwater pulmonates failed (very few long PCRs worked), although we
started with fresh material from 13 species).
A relatively basal position of Stylommatophora with
respect to other pulmonates was obtained in previous analyses based on mitochondrial genomes and individual
genes (Figure 1) [5-7]. Many derived features characterize
land snails and slugs, especially in the excretory and pulmonary systems, which are physiologically critical for life
on land [1,12]. As a result, land snails and slugs have often
been regarded as the most derived -and thus most recent lineage of pulmonates. However, several of those derived
features are autapomorphic (e.g., ureter anatomy) or
potentially homoplasic (e.g., eyes at the tip of the eye
tentacles) [1]. A basal position of land snails and slugs

Page 9 of 15

supports Solem’s theory according to which stylommatophorans were the first pulmonates to emerge 350 Mya
[5,12]. Although stylommatophorans are among the most
basal pulmonates and euthyneurans here, their relationships with respect to freshwater snails (Hygrophila) are
unclear because of low node support.
The Ellobiidae is a diverse taxon with about 800 species
names available in the literature, although only 250 of
them are likely to be valid. More importantly, Ellobiidae is
phylogenetically diverse because the 24 ellobiid genera are
characterized by different combinations of plesiomorphic
and derived characters [15,16]. As a result, no exclusive
morphological synapomorphy can be found for ellobiids
within the broader context of all pulmonates [1]. For
many years, molecular analyses could not adequately test
the phylogenetic status of ellobiids because of low taxon
sampling [2,6]. However, ellobiids were found to be monophyletic in a recent molecular analysis based on a new,
comprehensive data set including 25 ellobiid species
(Figure 1) [5], suggesting that additional sequenced mitochondrial genomes might be needed to properly address
the phylogenetic status of the Ellobiidae, especially considering that two subfamilies (Carychiinae and Melampodinae) are still not represented.
Although the phylogenetic status of Ellobiidae remains
problematic, analyses based on concatenated mitochondrial AA sequences and those based on individual genes
(18S, 28S, 16S, COI) all agree that the false limpet Trimusculus reticulatus is closely related to ellobiids (Figure 1)
[2-5]. Trimusculus reticulatus also shares the same genome organization as several ellobiid species (Figure 4).
This is a new result that had not been suggested using
morphology. In fact, there is not any obvious anatomical
feature that appears to be shared by Trimusculus and ellobiids [5]. Some features are found in ellobiids and Trimusculus, but they are also found in many other pulmonates,
such as the globineurons and a hypoathroid central nervous system [1,17]. Another interesting result obtained
here, as well as in recent analyses based on individual
genes, is the close relationship between Onchidiidae and
some ellobiids (Figure 1). Onchidiidae and Ellobiidae were
suggested to be classified together in the Ellobioidea [18],
partly based on characters from the nervous system.
Our present data (Table 3) reject the Geophila
hypothesis (Systellommatophora and Stylommatophora)
which is also not supported by other recent molecular
data (Figure 1). Morphological data supported the
monophyly of Geophila, mainly based on two synapomorphies, i.e., the loss of heterostrophy and the presence of eyes at the tip of the ocular tentacles [1]. Both
of these features might have evolved independently in
Stylommatophora, Onchidiidae, and Veronicellidae. The
Eupulmonata hypothesis sensu Morton (Geophila and
Ellobiidae) also is rejected here [15].

White et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/295

The present analyses confirm two important results
from recent molecular studies (Figure 1) [2-6]. First,
Amphiboloidea, traditionally regarded as one of the most
basal lineages of pulmonates, is not basal, suggesting that
their operculum (amphiboloids and glacidorbids are the
only pulmonates with an operculum) was acquired secondarily. Second, the pyramidelloids, traditionally regarded
as basal (i.e., non-euthyneuran) heterobranchs, are now
consistently found to be nested within pulmonates
[2-5,19]. However, the pyramidelloids have always been
difficult to classify. Some past authors have even regarded
them as opisthobranchs [20-23]. The fact that pyramidellids differ so much from other pulmonates may be related
to the fact that they live submerged in the seawater
(Williamia species are the only other pulmonates that live
submerged as adults).
Finally, the present data confirm that Siphonaria is
more closely related to opisthobranchs than to pulmonates, although this relationship is much clearer with
mitochondrial genomes than with individual genes (18S,
28S, 16S, and CO1) [2-6,8]. More specifically, Siphonaria
appears to be most closely related to sacoglossans (here
represented as Ascobulla fragilis). For most of the 20th
century, authors have classified Siphonaria within
Pulmonata, mainly because they tend to live in the upper
intertidal zone, exposed to the air for most of the day,
unlike opisthobranchs, which all live submerged even
when found in the intertidal zone. As a result, the pallial
cavity of Siphonaria has been interpreted as a pulmonary
cavity and their gills as secondary gills. However, early
anatomists had recognized the similarity of the pallial gill
of Siphonaria with that of cephalaspideans [24,25], suggesting that they could be homologous [1,26]. The pallial
gill of Siphonaria was even sometimes referred to as a
cephalaspidean gill [27]. Siphonaria and opisthobranchs
share another important feature, i.e., the production of a
milky white substance (polypropionate metabolites) when
irritated [28], although defensive metabolites are also
found in other pulmonates, such as Onchidium (Onchidiidae) and Trimusculus [29]. Even the gene order of the
mitochondrial genome of Siphonaria gigas (see the position of trnY, trnW, nad4L, and cob; Figure 4) supports an
affinity with opisthobranchs.
The order of the protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes
in mitochondrial genomes is known to be potentially
informative for phylogenetics [30]. However, the genomes
of pulmonate gastropods display limited informative variation because the organization of protein-coding and ribosomal genes is stable across euthyneurans (Figure 4). Also,
Figure 3, which places gene order in a phylogenetic context, suggests that species may share the same gene order
because of convergence. Indeed, the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata shares the same gene order as other distantly-related pulmonates represented here (Salinator,

Page 10 of 15

Trimusculus, Ovatella, Auriculinella, Onchidella, and
Peronia), but differs from the other freshwater snail represented here, Radix balthica, for five tRNA genes. So, the
gene order found in Biomphalaria glabrata and other pulmonates likely is due to convergence, i.e., tRNA genes
ended in identical positions through distinct but convergent series of rearrangements. The fact that the genomes
of the two Siphonaria species differ in the position of two
protein-coding genes (nad4 and nad4L), which has been
exceptionally observed in euthyneurans, supports the
same idea that the gene order of the mitochondrial genome of a given species should probably not be used to
extrapolate on the gene order of a whole lineage. In caenogastropods, Rawlings and collaborators also demonstrated
that two closely-related species of Dendropoma can differ
significantly in genome organization [11]. When additional
genomes are available for each major lineage of pulmonate
(Veronicellidae, Hygrophila, Onchidiidae, etc.), it might
become possible to determine a common gene order to
each lineage, but it is not possible at this stage because of
our still limited number of complete genomes. There is little doubt, however, that, as additional complete genomes
become available in euthyneurans, we will discover an
increased variability in euthyneuran gene order.

Conclusion
The present data constitute a significant increase in
taxon sampling for complete mitochondrial genomes of
pulmonates (Figure 2). However, despite these efforts, we
are still far from a comprehensive understanding of
higher relationships of pulmonates. Most of the deep
nodes are still uncertain, mainly due to low support
values as well as some incongruence between analyses
based on different data sets (complete mitochondrial
genomes versus individual genes -18S, 28S, 16S, CO1),
these two issues being obviously related (Figures 1, 3).
Additional pulmonate genomes are needed, especially for
the taxa for which no genome is currently available
(Williamia, Otina, and Smeagol). Euthyneuran relationships would also greatly benefit from the addition of new
genomes of basal heterobranchs (Architectonicoidea,
Valvatoidea, Omalogyroidea, Rissoelloidea, Orbitestellidae). Being the most closely related taxa to euthyneurans,
basal heterobranchs could help stabilize the topology
within euthyneurans.
Euthyneuran phylogenetics and, more broadly, molluscan phylogenetics are still based on limited data, at least
compared with vertebrate or arthropod phylogenetic studies which may include more than 40 kb of sequence data.
Addressing some of the incongruence between trees based
on individual genes (18S, 28S, 16S, CO1) and those based
on complete mitochondrial genomes in euthyneuran phylogenetics is a long-term goal that is beyond the scope
of the present study. Progress will obviously require

White et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/295

increased taxon sampling, but, more importantly, new
markers, especially given that, in some ways, using mitochondrial genomes is similar to analyzing one marker with
many loci [5]. In the future, when the number and diversity of molecular sequences and taxon samples are
increased, merging all data into a single data set may also
help provide greater resolution.
Meanwhile, we have to accept that our progress regarding euthyneuran phylogenetics will be slow. Step by step,
important discoveries are being made (Figures 1 and 3).
Some of the results obtained from recent molecular studies
constitute new, major findings [2-5]. In particular, all data
sets support close relationships between the false limpet
Trimusculus reticulatus and ellobiids. Also, pyramidelloids,
regarded for many decades as basal (non-euthyneuran) heterobranchs, are nested within pulmonates. Finally, the false
limpets Siphonaria, traditionally regarded as pulmonates,
are closely related to the sacoglossan opisthobranchs; mitochondrial genomes strongly suggest that Siphonaria
is nested within the monophyletic Opisthobranchia (Figure
3), while individual genes suggest that Siphonaria and
sacoglossans could be at the base of the monophyletic Pulmonata (Figure 1). All those results reinforce the idea that
opisthobranch and pulmonate phylogenetics and evolution
should be studied together, as euthyneurans [1,26].

Methods
Taxon Sampling

In addition to the ten mitochondrial genomes successfully sequenced for the present study, our analyses also
include 17 complete mitochondrial genomes of gastropods obtained from GenBank (Table 1). Of the ten mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates available (Figure 2),
three were not selected here: the sequence of Cepaea
nemoralis, generated more than 15 years ago, is of poor
quality; the mitochondrial genomes of Biomphalaria
tenagophila and Platevindex mortoni, although publicly
available in Genbank, are still unpublished and should be
published shortly by their authors. In addition, seven
genomes were selected to represent the major lineages of
opisthobranchs (Anaspidea, Cephalaspidea, Notaspidea,
Nudibranchia, and Sacoglossa). Three outgroups were
selected within Caenogastropoda.
Species identification, Vouchers, and DNA extraction

Species for which genomes were obtained in the present
study were identified by taxonomic experts (some of
whom are co-authors of the present article): Rosemary
Golding identified the Salinator, Suzete Gomes Rhopalocaulis, Antonio M. de Frias Martins the ellobiids, Tracy
White the Siphonaria, and Benoît Dayrat the Peronia,
Succinea, and Trimusculus. Voucher specimens are
deposited in museum collections (Table 1). For each species, the complete mitochondrial genome was obtained

Page 11 of 15

from a single individual (with the exception of the tiny
Pedipes pedipes for which three individuals had to be
used). In most cases, that individual is part of the lot
deposited as voucher. However, the small specimen used
for DNA extraction of Salinator, Auriculinella, and Ovatella had to be destroyed. In these cases, the voucher lot
contains other individuals from the same population.
DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform extraction protocol with cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide
(CTAB) [31].
PCR Amplification and Sequencing

Three approaches were combined to successfully obtain
complete mitochondrial genomes (Additional file 1): 1)
long PCR products (from ~3 to ~10 kb) were amplified
and sequenced using shotgun sequencing; 2) short PCR
products (less than ~1.5 kb) were amplified using pulmonate-specific primers spanning the entire genome and specifically designed for the present study (pulmonate-specific
primers were designed through the alignment of all the
sequences of pulmonate mitochondrial genomes available
when the present study started); 3) short PCR products
were amplified by ‘primer-walking, ‘ i.e., using individualspecific primers designed in previously sequenced regions
(by individual-specific primer, we mean that distinct primers were designed for each genome being sequenced).
Sequence coverage ranged from 2X (sequences from pulmonate- and individual-specific primers) to greater than
20X (sequences from shotgun sequencing of long PCRs).
Only high-quality chromatograms were utilized in areas
where sequence coverage was 2X. Additional file 1 summarizes how these three approaches were combined to
obtain each genome.
Long PCR amplification

Five pairs of universal primers were utilized to generate
short PCR products within five mitochondrial genes: cox1,
cox3, cob, rrnS, and rrnL [32]. In order to increase the success of long PCR amplification, individual-specific primers
were designed within the short PCR fragments of cox1,
cox3, cob, rrnS, and rrnL obtained with universal primers.
Different combinations of individual-specific primers were
then used to amplify large regions of the genome (from ~3
to ~10 kb). In some cases, universal primers were combined with individual-specific primers (combinations of
two universal primers very rarely yielded successful amplifications). The 25 μl short PCR reactions contained 10.9 μl
of water, 2.5 μl of 10X PCR Buffer, 2 μl of 25 mM MgCl2,
1 μl of each 10 μM primer, 2 μl of dNTP Mixture, 0.2 μl
(1 unit) of TaKaRa Taq (Code No. R001A), 5 μl of 20 ng/
μl template DNA, and 0.4 μl of 100X BSA (10 mg/ml
Bovine Serum Albumin). In some short PCR reactions,
BSA was replaced with 5 μl of 5X Qiagen Q-Solution
(water added to these reactions was 6.3 μl). The thermoprofile used for cox3, cob, and rrnS was five minutes at

White et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/295

94°C; 40 cycles of 40 seconds at 94°C, 1 minute at 46°C,
and 1 minute at 72°C; and 10 minutes at 72°C. The thermoprofile used for cox1 and rrnL was five minutes at
94°C; 30 cycles of 40 seconds at 94°C, 1 minute at 46°C,
and 1 minute at 72°C; and 10 minutes at 72°C. The 25 μl
long PCR reactions contained 3.8 μl of water, 2.5 μl of
10X LA PCR Buffer II, 0.5 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 5 μl of
each 2 μM primer, 3 μl of dNTP Mixture, 0.2 μl (1 unit)
of TaKaRa LA Taq (Code No. RR002M), and 5 μl of
20 ng/μl template DNA. The thermocycler profile for the
long PCRs consisted of one minute at 98°C, followed by
30 cycles of 98°C for 10 seconds and 68°C for 15 minutes,
with a final extension of 10 minutes at 72°C. All long and
short PCR products were cleaned with Qiagen QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Cat. No. 28106) prior to sequencing.
Shotgun sequencing of long PCR products

The purified long PCR products were sheared using the
HydroShear from GeneMachines. The sheared DNA was
then blunt-end repaired and visualized on a 1% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide. Gel fragments of the
correct size (~250bp) were excised and purified from the
gel. The repaired DNA fragments were then ligated into
the pmcl vector plasmid and transformed into competent
Escherichia coli cells by electroporation. The cells were
then blue/white screened on agar plates and 96 white
colonies were picked to form each clone library. A random selection of the library was then amplified by PCR
to ensure the DNA insert was present. The libraries were
sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), Walnut
Creek, California, in the context of a Genomics course
taught by Dr. Mónica Medina, in collaboration between
the University of California at Merced and the JGI.
Short (pulmonate-specific) PCR amplification

Only one genome was sequenced in its entirety using only
long PCR and shotgun sequencing (Trimusculus reticulatus; see Additional file 1). For six other genomes, long
PCR and shotgun sequencing yielded partial genomes with
gaps of various sizes that needed to be closed. A set of 94
pulmonate-specific primers were designed (Additional
file 2) to close those gaps in the six partial mitochondrial
genomes obtained through shotgun sequencing. Multiple
combinations of pulmonate-specific primers were used to
amplify gaps in partial genomes obtained from shotgun
sequencing. Those combinations were also used to amplify
genomes of species without going through shotgun
sequencing (see, Additional file 1). In some cases, depending on the strand used for transcription, a combination of
two forward primers (e.g. Nad4-879F and Cox3-164F) or
two reverse primers (e.g. Nad3-128R and Nad4-642R) had
to be used. For some individuals (e.g. Salinator rhamphidia and Rhopalocaulis grandidieri), the long PCR product
was used as the template for amplification instead of the
genomic DNA (for increasing chances of successful amplification). For those PCRs targeting gaps of ~900 bp or

Page 12 of 15

greater, the long PCR reaction and thermoprofile was used
(see above). Short PCR reactions (see above) were used for
gaps less than 900 bp with the following thermoprofile:
two minutes at 94°C; 5 cycles of 40 seconds at 94°C, 45
seconds at 45°C, and 1 minute at 72°C; 30 cycles of 40 seconds at 94°C, 40 seconds at 55°C, and 1 minute at 72°C;
and 3 minutes at 72°C. PCR products were cleaned with
either the Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit or ExoSAP (2 μl of 1u/μl Shrimp Alkaline Phophatase, 0.1 μl of
20u/μl Exonuclease I, and 6 μl of water per 4 μl of PCR
product) and sent for sequencing. Some PCR products
proved difficult to sequence directly (typically longer PCR
products) and were cloned using the Promega pGEM-T
Easy Vector System II (Cat. No. A1380) then cleaned with
the Promega Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification
System (Cat. No. A1330) prior to sequencing (products
were sent out for sequencing).
Short (individual-specific) PCR amplification

For the gaps that remained in the mitochondrial genomes
after using the pulmonate-specific primers and shotgun
sequencing, individual-specific primers were designed
and the gaps were primer-walked until completion of the
genome (Additional file 1). In some instances, a combination of a pulmonate-specific and an individual-specific
primer was used in an attempt to close gaps. PCR conditions for the individual-specific primers were identical to
those used for the pulmonate-specific primers.
Genome assembly and annotation

The shotgun sequence chromatograms produced by the
JGI were read, bases were called, and a value was
assigned to the quality of the called bases by the Phred
program [33]. The individual sequences were assembled
into contigs using Phrap http://www.phrap.org. The
contigs created by Phrap were analyzed and assembled
to form longer, more complete contigs using Consed
[34]. Contig sequences from the shotgun sequencing
were saved in MacVector with Assembler 9.5.2 http://
www.macvector.com. All other sequences (i.e., all
sequences not obtained through sequencing at the JGI;
see Additional file 1) were assembled in MacVector.
Open reading frames (ORFs) of the assembled contigs
were analyzed by MacVector and the tentative identity of
each protein-coding gene was determined based on the
map of the mitochondrial genome of Aplysia dactylomela.
Each gene was added to its corresponding Se-Al v2.0a11
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk file containing the alignment of
multiple homologous gastropods sequences and the gene
was demarcated on the genome based on the results of the
alignment. The limits of both the protein-coding and
rRNA genes were adjusted manually based on location of
adjacent genes. All tRNA genes were located by hand
based on the anticodon and the fairly conserved anticodon
stem and loop sequence.

Phylogenetic analyses

The 13 protein-coding gene sequences were first translated into amino acid sequences and then individually
aligned using the default parameters of ClustalW (1.6) in
MEGA version 4.1 (Beta) [35]. Each alignment was
cropped to remove variation on either end and then
sequences were concatenated. The concatenated proteincoding genes alignment (3, 458 amino acids) was adjusted
manually and a minimal number of sites were then
removed (gaps created by insertions in the sequences of
the caenogastropod outgroups). Three caenogastropod
species were used as outgroups: Cymatium parthenopeum,
Ilyanassa obsoleta, and Lophiotoma cerithiformis (Table 1).
Because genes of animal mitochondrial genomes are fast
evolving [36-38], phylogenetic analyses based on amino
acid sequences are commonly preferred to analyses based
on nucleotide sequences [6,7,39]. Also, it has been shown
that individual genes provide less topological resolution
than concatenated genes [10].
The amino acid substitution model was determined to
be MTRev+I+G using the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) in Topali version 2.5 [40]. The same model was
obtained whether each gene was treated independently as
a distinct partition, or all genes were concatenated in a
single data set. Maximum likelihood analysis of the amino
acid was run using the MTRev+I+G model with PhyML in
Topali, with bootstrap support values based on 1000 replicates. An alternative ML analysis was also run in RAxML
[41] using MTzoa [42], a model specifically designed for
lophotrochozoan mitochondrial data sets. Bayesian Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was performed on the amino acid sequences using the
MTRev+I+G model with MrBayes in the Topali interface
(two parallel analyses, 100 million generations, sampled
every 100 generations, 25% burn-in). An alternative Bayesian analysis was performed using the MTzoa model. The
Tracer v1.4 [43] graphical tool was used to visualize convergence of the chains from Bayesian analyses. In addition,
posterior samples from different (five) runs were compared, which is arguably the best approach to detect
potential problems of chain convergence [44].
Alternative phylogenetic relationships were tested with
the Approximately Unbiased (AU) and ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) tests, using CONSEL [45] using default
settings. Alternative relationships were based on traditional, morphology-based results as well as recent molecular results [1,5,26].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Approaches used to obtain the 10 new
mitochondrial genomes in the present study. Three approaches were
combined to get each of the 10 mitochondrial genomes of the present
study: 1) shotgun sequencing; 2) sequencing of short and long PCR

fragments obtained with pulmonate-specific primers (designed for the
present study; see Additional file 2); 3) sequencing of short and long PCR
fragments obtained with individual-specific primers (designed for the
present study). The asterisk (*) indicates individuals in which the long
PCR product was used as the template for the majority of PCR reactions
using pulmonate-specific and individual-specific primers.
Additional file 2: Pulmonate-specific primers designed for the
present study. Those pulmonate-specific primers were designed: 1) by
building alignments for the sequences of each individual gene (except
for tRNAs) from the complete, pulmonate, mitochondrial genomes
available prior to the present study (Figure 2, Table 1), and 2) by locating
conserved regions. All primers were specifically designed for the present
study, with the exception of ten of them: in cox1, F14 and R698 [59]; in
rrnL, F437 and R972 [60]; in cob, F384 and R827 [61]; in rrnS, F302 and
R695 [60]; in cox3, F174 and R713 [61].

Acknowledgements
Laboratory work for the present study was performed using funds from a US
National Science Foundation Grant (DEB-0933276, to B. Dayrat). Partial
shotgun sequencing was donated by Eddy Rubin, director of the DOE Joint
Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, California, through the sequencing quota
allocated to the UC Merced Genome Biology course (BIO 142) taught by
Dr. Mónica Medina in Spring 2007 and Spring 2008. Bioinformatics analyses
(assembly and annotation) were initiated by undergraduate and graduate
students in the context of that course. Jennifer Kuehl provided technical
expertise with the libraries at the JGI. Suzete Gomes provided tissue for
Rhopalocaulis grandidieri.
