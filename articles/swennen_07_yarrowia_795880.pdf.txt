Abstract
Background: Protein secretion is a universal cellular process involving vesicles which bud and fuse
between organelles to bring proteins to their final destination. Vesicle budding is mediated by
protein coats; vesicle targeting and fusion depend on Rab GTPase, tethering factors and SNARE
complexes. The Génolevures II sequencing project made available entire genome sequences of four
hemiascomycetous yeasts, Yarrowia lipolytica, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida
glabrata. Y. lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast and has good capacities to secrete proteins. The
translocation of nascent protein through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane was well studied in
Y. lipolytica and is largely co-translational as in the mammalian protein secretion pathway.
Results: We identified S. cerevisiae proteins involved in vesicular secretion and these protein
sequences were used for the BLAST searches against Génolevures protein database (Y. lipolytica, C.
glabrata, K. lactis and D. hansenii). These proteins are well conserved between these yeasts and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We note several specificities of Y. lipolytica which may be related to its
good protein secretion capacities and to its dimorphic aspect. An expansion of the Y. lipolytica Rab
protein family was observed with autoBLAST and the Rab2- and Rab4-related members were
identified with BLAST against NCBI protein database. An expansion of this family is also found in
filamentous fungi and may reflect the greater complexity of the Y. lipolytica secretion pathway. The
Rab4p-related protein may play a role in membrane recycling as rab4 deleted strain shows a
modification of colony morphology, dimorphic transition and permeability. Similarly, we find three
copies of the gene (SSO) encoding the plasma membrane SNARE protein. Quantification of the
percentages of proteins with the greatest homology between S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica and animal
homologues involved in vesicular transport shows that 40% of Y. lipolytica proteins are closer to
animal ones, whereas they are only 13% in the case of S. cerevisiae.
Conclusion: These results provide further support for the idea, previously noted about the
endoplasmic reticulum translocation pathway, that Y. lipolytica is more representative of vesicular
secretion of animals and other fungi than is S. cerevisiae.

Background
Yarrowia lipolytica is a hemiascomycetous dimorphic yeast,
generally regarded as safe (GRAS), which has been used
for biotechnological applications. It is able to produce
large amounts of several metabolites such as citric acid
and to secrete a variety of extracellular proteins (alkaline
or acid proteases, RNase, lipases etc.) [1]. Its good protein
secretion capacities have allowed the engineering of powerful heterologous protein expression systems [reviewed
in [2]]. Y. lipolytica is also a conveniently tractable model
organism, of which the secretion pathway was studied for
several years in our laboratory [3]. We focused on the early
steps of protein translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum [4-8], on the quality control of protein folding [9]
and on the glycosylation pathway [10]. Several genes
involved in these steps were cloned and analysed.
The results of the Génolevures II sequencing project of
four hemiascomycetous yeasts [11] allowed us to search
for proteins involved in the secretion pathway of Y. lipolytica and we compared them to the proteins of the three
other yeasts, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis and
Debaryomyces hansenii. C. glabrata has become the second
most common cause of candidiasis after Candida albicans.
C. glabrata is not dimorphic, in contrast to other Candida
species, and is phylogenetically closer to Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [12]. K. lactis is less closely related to S. cerevisiae
and has the capacity to grow on lactose as a sole carbon
source, it has been used for industrial applications
[13,14]. D. hansenii is a cryotolerant marine yeast which
grows at salinities up to 24%. D. hansenii is the most common yeast found in cheese and provides proteolytic and
lipolytic activities during cheese ripening [15]. In this
work, we first established the list of proteins, predicted
from whole genome analysis, which are potentially
involved in vesicular transport in Y. lipolytica. Candidates
were identified through BLAST searches against S. cerevisiae protein sequences. We then search for homologues of
these proteins in the predicted protein set encoded by the
three other genomes. Among the differences observed, we
noticed a number of plasma membrane SNARE proteins
(three Ssop) in Y. lipolytica compared to the four other
yeasts. S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata have two SSO genes
whilst in K. lactis and D. hansenii, we detected only one
gene. We finally focused on one specific feature of the Y.
lipolytica secretory pathway, namely the existence of a
Rab4-related protein. In mammalian cells, the GTP binding protein Rab4p is involved in the regulation of plasma
membrane protein recycling [16]. A Rab4-related protein
is also found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in filamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus fumigatus
or Phaenerochaete chrysosporium but is absent from S. cerevisiae, Candida albicans [17] and the three other hemiascomycetous yeasts. We constructed a strain of Y. lipolytica

deleted for the RAB4 gene and analysed its phenotypic
pattern.

Results and discussion
Vesicle-mediated protein transport pathways
The only membrane that a secretory protein must traverse
is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, the transport of the protein to its final destination continues
through vesicles which bud and fuse between organelles
[for reviews: [18,19]]. Vesicle budding is mediated by protein coats; vesicle targeting and fusion depend on Rab
GTPase, tethering factors and SNARE complexes.
Vesicle budding
Protein coats (see Additional file 1)
Endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport
Endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport is mediated by
the action respectively of the COPII and COPI coat complexes [[20-23] for reviews]. The COPII coat is assembled
on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and allows
cargo selection and membrane budding [24]. The COPI
complex is involved in retrieval of recycled proteins back
to the endoplasmic reticulum [25]. COP I subunits could
also have a role in vacuolar sorting [26].
COPII coat vesicles (see Additional file 2-1)
Vesicle budding is initiated by the activation of the
GTPase Sar1p by the endoplasmic reticulum integral
membrane guanine exchange factor Sec12p [27,28].
Sar1p initiates membrane curvature [[29], for mammalian Sar1p see [30]]. The membrane-bound Sar1p-GTP
recruits the heterodimer complex Sec23p-Sec24p. These
pre-budding complexes are gathered by the Sec13pSec31p complex into nascent vesicles [see [31]: the mammalian Sec13p-Sec31p structure]. The Sec23p subunit
activates the hydrolysis of GTP by Sar1p and reverses the
assembly process. Sec16p stabilizes the coat against premature disassembly after Sar1p hydrolyses GTP [32].
Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor
the assembly and disassembly of COPII coat, it was suggested that a kinetically stable prebudding complex was
maintained during multiple Sar1p GTPase cycles [33]. In
S. cerevisiae, there are one Sec23p, one Sec23p-related protein, one Sec24p, two Sec24p-related proteins (Sfb2p and
Sfb3p) and one Sec12p homologue (Sed4p). In Y. lipolytica and D. hansenii, all the COP II coat components are
well conserved and we find two Sec23p-homologues, two
Sec24p-homologues but no Sed4p proteins. In C. glabrata,
there are two Sec23p-homologues, three Sec24p-homologues and two Sec13p-homologues and in K. lactis we
found the same proteins as in S. cerevisiae with the exception of Sfb2p and Sed4p.

COP I coat vesicles (see Additional file 2-2)
The COP I coat assembles by the same process as COP II
complex involving an Arfp-GTPase [for a review about
Arf1p: [34]; mammalian Arf1p: [35]; mammalian COPI
assembly review: [36]]. All the S. cerevisiae components
are conserved in Y. lipolytica, though the Y. lopolytica
Sec28p is only weakly related to the S. cerevisiae protein.
In K. lactis, the Arf1 protein homologue was not identified
but another Arf protein could play the role of Arf1p (see
Additional file 2-12).
Post-Golgi transport
In the trans-Golgi network, the proteins are sorted to the
plasma membrane, the endosomal/vacuolar system or
recycled back from the endosome. Coated vesicle adaptors facilitate cargo selection [for reviews: [19,37]].
Adaptor protein complex (see Additional file 2-3)
In S. cerevisiae, by homology to the mammalian adaptor
protein (AP) subunit sequences, three potential heterotetrameric adaptor protein complexes have been identified
[38]. Each complex is composed of two large (Aplp), one
medium (Apmp) and one small (Apsp) subunits. The AP1 complex is associated with clathrin-coated vesicles and
is involved in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins
[39] and trafficking to the vacuole [40]. This complex is
alone able to associate with clathrin [38,41]. Unlike the
mammalian AP-2 complex which associates with endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles, the AP-2 complex of S. cerevisiae is apparently not involved in endocytosis. The AP-3
complex is involved in independent clathrin-coated vesicle transport of membrane proteins from Golgi to vacuoles [42]. In Y. lipolytica, we also identified three potential
AP complexes. As in S. cerevisiae, two AP-1 medium subunits were found, but only two small subunits could be
identified which could correspond to the AP-2 and AP-3
small subunits. The three other yeasts have the same set of
proteins as S. cerevisiae for their adaptor protein complexes.
GGA proteins (Golgi-localized, γ ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins)
(see Additional file 2-3)
GGA proteins are implicated in Golgi to endosomes clathrin-coated vesicle transport and bind to ubiquitin to facilitate this sorting [43,44]. In S. cerevisiae, the GGA gene is
duplicated but in the four yeasts studied, as in C. elegans
and D. melanogater, there is only one gene: GGA2 which,
evolutionary, is closer to the hypothetical common ancestor [45].
Synaptojanin-like protein (see Additional file 2-3)
The S. cerevisiae Inp53p, a synaptojanin-like protein acts
together with the AP-1 complex in the Golgi to endosome
clathrin-dependant pathway which is distinct from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/219

direct Golgi to prevacuolar compartment mediated by
GGA proteins [46].
Retromer complex (see Additional file 2-4) and sorting nexins (see
Additional file 2-5)
Sorting nexins play a role in retrieval of proteins from the
prevacuolar compartment or post-Golgi endosomes and
different nexins operate in different classes of endosomes
[reviewed in [47-49]]. The sorting nexins Snx4p, Snx41p
and Snx42p are required for the retrieval of the SNARE
Snc1p from the post-Golgi endosome; Grd19p and the
retromer complex are involved in the retrieval of endosomal SNARE Pep12p from the prevacuolar compartment
[50]. The retromer complex consists of five proteins:
Vps5p, Vps17p, two sorting nexins which form a dimer
and associate with the complex formed by Vps26p,
Vps29p and Vps35p [see [51,52] for mammalian retromer
complex structure].
Vesicle targeting and fusion
RabGTPase (see Additional file 3 and Additional file 2-6)
Rab proteins are small monomeric guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) which are membrane-associated and
cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive
GDP-bound protein. These switches regulate all the steps
in the secretion pathway. Mammalian Rab proteins
belong to the Ras superfamily of GTPase. All the members
of this superfamily have conserved nucleotide, phosphate
and magnesium binding sequences but the Rab sequences
can be distinguish by their C-terminal prenylation site
and five Rab-specific regions (RabF) [53]. Pereira-Leal and
Seabra [53] have also identified Rab subfamily specific
regions (RabSF). They studied the evolution of the Rab
family [54] and by their analysis, they observed that Rab
proteins co-segregating in the phylogenetic trees showed a
pattern of similar cellular localisation and/or function. In
S. cerevisiae, Ypt1p, Ypt31p/32p and Sec4p are the essential Rab GTPases which regulate the exocytic pathway and
Ypt6p, Ypt7p and Ypt51p/52p/53p are involved in the
endocytic pathway. S. cerevisiae also has two other Rab
GTPase, Ypt10p and Ypt11p which are also present in C.
glabrata and we can find Ypt11p in K. lactis. Ypt10p seems
to be involved in endocytic function and Ypt11p is
required for endoplasmic reticulum inheritance [55]. In
C. glabrata, a Ypt53p homologue could not be identified
and in K. lactis it is Ypt32p which was not found. In Y. lipolytica, we can find homologues of the nine S. cerevisiae
proteins necessary for the secretion pathway. Ypt10p and
Ypt11p are absent but we can find two other Rab-related
proteins, Rab2p and Rab4p as in the filamentous fungi
[17]. The analysis of the phylogenic tree (Fig. 1) obtained
after alignment of several human Rabp, S. cerevisiae and Y.

fungi, Y. lipolytica has a large protein secretion capacity
and is able to switch from a yeast life cycle to a filamentous form in response to environmental conditions; in
this latter form it needs a better capacity of secretion and
of recycling plasma membrane material. In mammalian
cells, Rab2p has been proposed to regulate the retrograde
transport between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum [57] and Rab4p is involved in the recycling of plasma
membrane proteins [see [16,58] for a review about recycling pathways]. The comparison of the mouse, rat,
human, N. crassa, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Y. lipolytica sequences (Fig. 2 and Additional file 4) shows that the
nucleotide, phosphate and magnesium binding regions,
the RabF and RabSF sequences are well conserved. We also
compared these Rab4p sequences with other proteins of
the mammalian Ras superfamily (data not shown) and we
identified a sequence GIQYG next to the RabSF4 region,
and particularly the tyrosine residue only present in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/219

Rab4p sequences. The analysis with the NetPhos program
(CBS prediction server) identified this tyrosine as a potential phosphorylation site. We suggest that this tyrosine
could be important in the regulation of Rab4p activity. In
order to get more information about this filamentous
fungi specificity, we analysed the effects of a deletion of
the gene coding for the Y. lipolytica Rab4-related protein.
This deletion showed only slight phenotypic changes. The
aspect of the colony on rich medium plate was slightly different (Fig. 3). The ability to make the dimorphic transition was not impaired but at OD600 of 10, we quantified
that the percentage of cells undergoing a dimorphic transition for the wild type strain was 74% and 38% for the
mutant strain and the cells in the yeast form had a more
spherical appearance in the mutant strain than in the wild
type and aggregated more readily (Fig. 4). The round morphological aspect is also observed in the Y. lipolytica rac
mutant, the Rac protein is another member of the Ras
superfamily which is implicated in the induction of the
hyphal growth [59]. The slight differences in the morphology of the mutant strains suggested a potential modification of the wall composition. This was confirmed by the
increased sensitivity of the strain to calcofluor white (Fig.
5), implicating an increase in chitin composition of the
wall. We also observed a decrease in the sensitivity to SDS
(Fig. 5) suggesting a decrease in the porosity of the wall.
These two events are also encountered when the genes
coding for a heterotrimeric G-proteins of Aspergillus nidulans are mutated, these mutations in this filamentous fungus confer resistance to the antifungal plant PR-5
(Pathogenesis-Related) protein [60]. We suggest that the
Y. lipolytica Rab4 protein could be important to recycle the
receptor associated with a heterotrimeric G-protein. The
mutant Y. lipolytica rab4 strains were able to produce diploids as well as the wild type strain (data not shown) indicating that the recycling of the pheromone receptor,
associated with a G-protein, was not impaired. The Y. lipolytica Rab4p does not regulate endocytosis as the incorporation of FM4-64 was the same as the wild type strain
compared to a sls2 mutant strain in which the FM4-64
incorporation is delayed (Fig. 6). Y. lipolytica Sls2p is
homologous to the S. cerevisiae Rcy1p which plays a role
in the recycling pathway (see "The vesicle-SNARE Snc1p
recycling" section below).
Regulation of Rab-GTPase [for reviews see [61-64]]
Rab proteins cycle between cytosolic inactive GDP-bound
form and active membrane associated GTP-bound form.
The cytosolic form exists in a complex with a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Post-translational prenylation of
the protein is important for its activity and prenylated
Rabp is recruited to the appropriate membrane by a GDI
displacement factor (GDF) which catalyses the dissociation step. The nucleotide exchange is favoured by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GTP-bound Rabp

is then activated and can interact with its effectors. The
recycling of the Rab protein is stimulated by the GTPase
activating protein (GAP) and the GDP-bound Rab protein
is released from the membrane by GDI.
Prenylation [[65], see [66] for mammalian prenylation] (see
Additional file 2-7)
Most of Rab proteins contain two C-terminal cysteine residues which are isoprenylated with two geranylgeranyl
moieties. This reaction is catalyzed by geranylgeranyl
transferase II (GGTase II), this enzyme has two subunits,
a third subunit, Rab escort protein (REP), is a chaperone.
GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (see Additional file 2-7)
Gdi1p recycles the Yptp/Sec4p proteins from their target
membranes back to the vesicular pool [67].

GDI displacement factor (GDF) (see Additional file 2-7)
In vitro experiments with mammalian proteins identified
that Yip3p catalyses the dissociation of endosomal Rab
proteins from GDI [68]. The Yip family (Yip1p, Yip2p,
Yip3p, Yip4p, Yip5p and Yif1p) are membrane proteins
which interact with prenylated Rab proteins [69]. In S. cerevisiae, Yip1p has been identified through a two-hybrid
screen as a protein interacting with Ypt1p and Ypt31p in
their GDP form [70]. With a similar screen, Yif1p has been
identified as a Yip1p-interacting protein [71]. These two
proteins form an integral membrane complex that bind
Ypt1p and is required for Golgi membrane fusion by
interaction with the Golgi SNARE proteins [72]. Yos1p
(Yip One Suppressor 1) associates with Yip1p-Yif1p complex [73]. This protein was only identified in D. hansenii.
Guanine exchange factor (GEF) (see Additional file 2-7)
The activation and membrane stabilisation of the Rab
protein are accompanied by exchange of the GDP for the
GTP, this activity being catalysed by the guanine exchange

factor. Each GEF is specific for a Rab protein and seems to
be recruited by the activated Rabp playing a role immediately upstream in the secretion pathway [74,75]. The
TRAPP I protein complex binds the COP II vesicles and
activates Ypt1p by guanine exchange [76]. TRAPP II
Trs120p-Trs130p subunits join the TRAPP I complex to
switch the GEF activity from Ypt1p to Ypt31p-Ypt32p acting in late Golgi [77,78]. Sec2p [see [79] for the crystal
structure and 80 for the crystal structure of the Sec2p/
Sec4p complex] is a highly efficient guanine exchange factor of Sec4p [81], the Rabp essential for exocytosis [[82],
see [83] for Sec4p regulation cascade, [84] for Sec2p association with exocyst]. Vps9p is the Ypt51p GEF [85]. The
Ric1/Rgp1p is the Ypt6p GEF [86], the BLAST against the
S. cerevisiae proteins showed only one subunit in Y. lipoly-

tica, Rgp1p, but by comparison with the D. hansenii protein we could identify a potential Y. lipolytica Ric1p. And
Vps39p is the Ypt7p GEF [87].
GTPase activating protein (GAP) (see Additional file 2-7)
The recycling of the Rab protein is favoured by the GTPase
activating protein. In S. cerevisiae, eight GTPase activating
proteins have been identified and are not specific for one
Rab protein in in vitro experiments (Gyp1p, Gyp6p,
Gyp7p: [88]; Gyp2p, Gyp3p, Gyp4p: [89]; Gyp5p,
Gyp8p: [90]). In the four yeasts, the Gyp3p homologue,
Gyp4p was not identified. Gyl1p is Gyp-like protein interacting with Gyp5p involved in the control of polarized
exocytosis [91], this protein has an homologue only in C.
glabrata but not in the three other yeasts.

more resistant to SDS than the wild type (wt) strain.

Tethering factors (see Additional file 5), [reviewed in [92-94]]
The secretory vesicles are tethered to their target membrane by two classes of molecules: coiled-coil proteins
able to form homodimeric complex as long as several
times the diameter of the vesicle and large multisubunit
complexes.
Endoplasmic reticulum-cis-Golgi-network
Several factors are involved in the tethering of vesicles to
the Golgi, TRAPP complex (see Additional file 2-8), COG
complex (see Additional file 2-9) and Uso1p (see Additional file 2-10). TRAPP is associated with the Golgi and
two forms of the complex exist: TRAPP I (7 subunits) acts
in the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport and
TRAPP II which contains the TRAPP I subunits together
with three other proteins acts in Golgi traffic. In Y. lipolytica only two TRAPP II specific subunits were identified by
comparison with the S. cerevisiae protein sequences but
for the Trs65p we used the protein identified in D. hanse-

nii to detect a potential Y. lipolytica protein. Both complexes are able to interchange guanine nucleotide on
Ypt1p. In vitro, TRAPP I can bind COPII vesicles by binding the coat Sec23p subunit [95] and this could be the first
event before interaction of the vesicle with its target [76].
The crystal structure of the mammalian Bet3p, the most
conserved TRAPP protein, reveals a dimeric structure with
hydrophobic channels and a covalent modification with a
palmitate [96,97], the crystallographic study of the complex Bet3p-Trs33p reveals specific interactions between
these subunits [98]. This subunit could be responsible for
the targeting and the anchoring in the Golgi membrane
and could direct the other TRAPP components to the
Golgi [96,99]. Trs120p, a TRAPP II subunit, is required for
vesicle traffic from the early endosome to the late Golgi
[100]. Trs120p and Trs130p TRAPP II subunits are conserved from yeast to mammals; the Trs65p subunit is conserved only in some fungi and unicellular eukaryotes
[101]. The other tethering factors, Uso1p, a long coiled-

recycling" section). Low panel: Nomarski.

coil protein and the COG complex composed of eight
subunits in S. cerevisiae are recruited before the last step of
membrane fusion. Uso1p and the COG complex also
have a function in sorting of endoplasmic reticulum-vesicles containing GPI-anchored proteins [see [102] for a
review about differential ER exit] and in retrograde vesicular trafficking within the Golgi [reviewed in [103]]. The
Uso1 protein consists of an N-terminal globular head
region, a coiled-coil tail which mediates dimerisation and
a C-terminal acidic region. The NCBI Conserved Domain
Architecture Retrieval Tool has identified in the Y. lipolytica Uso1 protein the first two domains but not the C-terminal acidic region. When we compare the consensus
sequence of this region with the Y. lipolytica sequence,
only the last 50 residues of this domain are well conserved. The Saccharomyces cerecisiae and the mammalian
COG complex are composed of eight subunits, a multiple
of four subunits, as one the GARP and the exocyst complexes (see below), which could reflect an interaction with
a four-component complex such as the trans SNARE complex [92]. In Y. lipolytica, only five subunits were identified
as probable COG proteins by comparison with the S. cerevisiae proteins. Cog1p, Cog2p and Cog7p were not
detected by BLAST searches but in mammals these proteins were identified by their function as their sequence
similarity with the S. cerevisiae proteins is low [104].
Cog2p was found in D. hansenii and its sequence used to
make the BLAST search with the Y. lipolytica proteins. This
allowed the identification of a potential Y. lipolytica
Cog2p homologue, but Cog1p and Cog7p were not found
in Y. lipolytica, and in D. hansenii, Cog1p was not found.
These proteins probably exist but should be identified by
another
means.
Cis-Golgi-network-Endoplasmic reticulum (see Additional file 2-11)
Dsl1p complex is a large complex composed of the
peripheral endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins
Dsl1p, Dsl3p (Sec39p) and Tip20p [105,106]. Dsl1p contains three domains, an N-terminal coiled-coil region of
200 aminoacids which interacts with Tip20p, a central
highly acidic region of interaction with Ret2p and Ret1p
(two COP I subunits) and a conserved C-terminal
sequence which could recruit cytoskeletal elements [105].
The 200 amino acid N-terminus from the Dsl1p protein
identified in Y. lipolytica does not align with the S. cerevisiae sequence. Nevertheless the Y. lipolytica sequence also
contains potential coiled-coil regions (as determined by
the coiled-coil prediction program, NPS@:Network Protein Sequence Analysis, [107]). The Tip20p sequence of Y.
lipolytica has only 19 % identities with the S. cerevisiae
sequence. This could explain the divergent N-terminal
sequence of Dsl1p which is involved in the interaction of
the two proteins. Dsl1p, Tip20p and Dsl3p are required
for the stability of the SNARE complex at the endoplasmic
reticulum [106].

Golgi
S. cerevisiae TRAPP II complex (see Additional file 2-8) is
composed of ten subunits and could have a role in retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles [108]. The trs130 mutant
(coding for a TRAPP II subunit) displays synthetic interaction with mutation in a COPI subunit (Ret2p) and a deletion of ARF1 (see Additional file 2-12) is implicated in
COPI formation [108].

A role of the COG complex (see above) has also been
found in retrograde transport to early Golgi vesicles [109].
The VFT/GARP complex (see Additional file 2-13) localizes to the trans-Golgi network and is required for retrograde traffic from early endosomes to the Golgi [110,111].
The S. cerevisiae complex is composed of four subunits
[112,113], it is the effector of Ypt6p and interacts with the
SNARE Tlg1p. Only three subunits were identified in Y.
lipolytica and D. hansenii but the undetected Vps51p unit
also has no homologue in mammalian [114] and seems
to be a regulatory subunit [97] which could be replaced by
another protein as suggested by Liewen, et al. [114]. The
structural analysis of the interaction between S. cerevisiae
Tlg1p and Vps51p has determined an N-terminal peptide
of Vps51p which deletion does not block transport to the
late Golgi from endosomes [115].
Golgins (see Additional file 2-10, -12) [reviewed in
[116,117]] are coiled-coil proteins which organize the
structure and the trafficking pathways in the Golgi. These
proteins have mainly been studied in mammalian cells
but in Sacharomyces cerevisiae several homologues have
been identified: Uso1p is the homologue of the mammalian p115 required for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi
transport; Grh1p, the GRASP65-homologue, a Golgi
localized protein component of the spindle assembly
checkpoint [118]; Imh1p, involved in transport between
an endosomal compartment and the Golgi, Imh1p contains a Golgi-localization (GRIP) domain that interacts
with activated Arl1p-GTP to be localized to the Golgi, this
is regulated by Arl3p [[119,120]] and Arl3p requires the
N-terminal acetyltransferase NatC complex and the protein Sys1p to be targeted to the Golgi [121] [for a review
about Arl proteins see [122]]; Coy1p, the CASP homologue, a Golgi membrane protein related to Giantin, its
deletion in S. cerevisiae restores normal growth to cells
lacking the SNARE Gos1p [123] and Rud3p, a golgin-160related protein, is a Golgi matrix protein that is involved
in the structural organization of the cis-Golgi [124].
Golgi-Endosome, Endosome-Vacuole [37]
The TRAPP II subunit Trs120p is required for vesicle traffic
from early endosome to the late Golgi [100].

The Vps Class C/HOPS complex [reviewed in: [92,125])
(see Additional file 2-14):
The HOPS complex composed of Vps11p, Vps18p,
Vps16p, Vps41p with the protein Vps19p are the effectors
of Ypt51p in endosomal traffic. In vacuolar transport, the
complex seems to recruit the Rab Ypt7p GEF Vps39p
which activates Ypt7p. Activated Ypt7p acts on the HOPS
complex to promote tethering and binding to the SNARE
Vam3p through the interaction with the SNARE-binding
protein, Vps33p. Vps33p together with other HOPS complex subunits is found in complex with Vps8p, a
hydrophilic membrane-associated protein [126]. HOPS
complex binds phosphoinositides and SNARE Vam7p
[127].
Golgi-Plasma Membrane
The Exocyst (see Additional file 2-15, -16)
The S. cerevisiae exocyst complex is composed of eight
subunits (Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec10p, Sec15p,
Exo70p and Exo84p), a quatrefoil complex as in the COG
and the GARP complexes [92]. The activated Rab protein,
Sec4p, present on the secretory vesicles, binds the exocyst
subunit Sec15p in subcomplex with Sec10p resulting in
the association with the other subunits and Sec3p [128].
Sec3p is the spatial landmark defining the sites of polarized exocytosis [129]. The localization of Sec3p is mediated by Rho GTPases, Rho1p [130] and Cdc42p [131].
Rho3p plays a role in exocytosis through its interaction
with Exo70p ([132-134]). These Rho proteins also have a
role in actin polymerisation. Assembly of the exocyst
occurs when the subcomplex associated with the vesicles
joins Sec3p and Exo70p on the plasma membrane [135].
The Sec6p subunit dimerizes and interacts with the
SNARE Sec9p, playing a role in SNARE complex regulation [136]. A cyclical regulatory network contributes to
the establishment and maintenance of polarized cell
growth [137]. Bem1p interacts with Sec15p and is
involved in the Cdc42p-mediated polarity [138].
SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment
protein REceptor) proteins [see reviews: [125,17,139-141] for
mammalian SNAREs] (see Additional file 6 and Additional file 2-17)
After the tethering of the vesicle close to its target membrane, the fusion of the membranes is initiated through
the action of SM (Sec1/Munc18, see below) and SNARE
proteins. SNARE proteins share one conserved sequence
called the SNARE motif which contains 60–70 amino
acids that include heptads repeat typical of coiled coils.
They contain a C-terminal transmembrane domain or a
hydrophobic post-translational modification motif.
SNARE proteins associate to form complex undergoing
conformational changes. Free SNARE motifs are unstructured and when they are associated in a complex they
assemble into elongated four-helical bundles. SNAREs are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/219

present on the vesicle and the target membranes and the
formation of the complex pulls the membrane close
together. SNARE proteins are classified in to subfamilies
based on a highly conserved layer of interacting amino
acids (three glutamines: Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, one arginine: R-)
in the centre of the helix bundle. All complexes contain
one copy of each SNARE motif. In S. cerevisiae, twentyfour SNARE-encoding genes have been identified
[reviewed in [139]]. Twenty-two of these genes could be
found in Y. lipolytica by sequence homology. As in other
fungi [17], Vam3p and Spo20p were not detected.
Spo20p, which seems specific to S. cerevisiae (also not
identified in the three other yeasts), contains both Qb and
Qc SNARE motifs and is required during sporulation for
the prospore membrane formation [142,143]. Vam3p
SNARE is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in S. cerevisiae and there is no homologue outside the Saccharomycetes, the Saccharomycetaceae, K. lactis, has a Vam3p
SNARE, but in D. hansenii, another Saccharomycetaceae as
in Y. lipolytica (Dipodascaceae) the Vam3 protein was not
detected. The mitosporic Saccharomycetales, C. glabrata,
possess a Vam3 protein. Pep12p is a late endosomal Qa
SNARE with sequence similarity with Vam3p, that can
complement vam3 mutants [144]. In Y. lipolytica and in D.
hansenii, the BLAST searches allowed us to identify the
Pep12p SNARE and another SNARE we propose to name
Pep12p-like because its sequence is closer to Pep12p than
to Vamp3p. This Pep12p-like SNARE could play the role
of the S. cerevisiae Vam3p in both yeasts. A specificity of Y.
lipolytica is the presence of three SSO genes resulting probably from gene triplication, and this seems unique to Y.
lipolytica. The Sso proteins are implicated in the fusion of
the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and S. cerevisiae Sso1p also has sporulation-specific functions
[145]. The multiplicity of SSO genes in Y. lipolytica could
reflect its good secretion capacity and its capacity to
induce hyphal growth which needs better recycling of
plasma membrane material. On the contrary, only one
Sso protein (Sso2p) and one Snc protein (Snc2p) were
found in K. lactis and D. hansenii. The SSO and SNC genes
of K. lactis have been cloned by complementation in S.
cerevisiae of sso2-1 and snc1Δ snc2Δ sem1Δ mutant strains.
The K. lactis Ssop can perform both of the S. cerevisiae Ssop
functions and the K. lactis Sncp seems to perform only the
S. cerevisiae Sncp functions [146]. Sft1p was not detected
in C. glabrata, Syn8p was not detected in C. glabrata and K.
lactis and Nyv1p was not detected in D. hansenii.
Regulation of fusion
The Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins (see Additional file 2-18) [reviewed
in [147]]
The SM proteins confer specificity to membrane fusion
through their binding to the N-terminal domain of the Qa
SNARE protein. Four SM proteins have been found in S.
cerevisiae, Sly1p acting between the endoplasmic reticu-

Page 10 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:219

lum and Golgi [148] and Sec1 at the final step of exocytosis, Vps45p and Vps33p playing a role between Golgi and
endosomes and between endosomes and vacuole. Each
SM protein can bind several Qa SNARE but also other
SNARE implicated in the same complex, as has been
shown for Sly1p [149]. In addition one SNARE can bind
two SM proteins at the same organelle: Vps45p and
Vps33p with Pep12p [126]. Mso1p, a Sec1p-interacting
protein, binds to SNARE complex and plays an essential
role for vesicle fusion during prospore membrane formation [150,151].
Vsm1p (see Additional file 2-19)
The phosphorylation of SNAREs by the cAMP-dependent
protein kinase (PKA) regulates their ability to assemble
into functional complexes [152,153]. Phosphorylation of
the Sed5p t-SNARE regulates endoplasmic reticulumGolgi transport as well as Golgi morphology [154]. The
Ssop phosphorylation allows the binding of Vsm1p, a
negative regulator of secretion which prevents the formation of the SNARE complex [155]. Dephosphorylation of
Ssop by ceramide activated protein phosphatase (CAPP)
increases its ability to form a complex with Sec9p [152].
Three S. cerevisiae genes code for a PKA but only one gene
could be identified in Y. lipolytica and D. hansenii and two
were identified in C. glabrata and K. lactis. The CAPP is
composed of two regulatory subunits (Tpd3p and
Cdc55p) and one catalytic subunit (Sit4p) which were
found by sequence homology in the four yeasts in addition to further one Tpd3p-like in C. glabrata.
SNARE recycling
SNARE complex dissociation (see Additional file 2-20):

After the membrane fusion step, the trans-SNARE complex becomes a cis-SNARE complex whose dissociation
requires the ATPase Sec18p and the soluble NSF-attachment protein (Sec17p) as cofactor [156,157]. In vacuole
fusion, Sec17p may displace HOPS from SNAREs to permit subsequent rounds of fusion [158]. Two Sec18 proteins were detected in C. glabrata.
The vesicle-SNARE Snc1p recycling (see Additional file 2-20)
The S. cerevisiae RCY1 gene has been identified with a
screen for mutants affected in membrane traficking along
the endocytic pathway [159]. Rcy1p contains an aminoterminal F box and a CAAX box motif in its carboxyl-terminal sequence. The F box region of the protein is
required for the recycling of the vesicle-SNARE Snc1p. The
CAAX box is required for its localization in polar growth
regions. Rcy1p interacts with Skp1p through the F box
motif and both proteins form a complex necessary for the
recycling function [160]. Rcy1p is a positive regulator of
Ypt6p [161]. Gyp1p, the Ypt1p GTPase activator is also
involved in the recycling of Snc1p [162], as well as Snx4p,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/219

Snx41p and Snx42p [43]. The ARF-GAP Gcs1p facilitates
the incorporation of the Snc1p into COPI recycling vesicles [163]. Rcy1p is a downstream effector of Ypt31, 32p
[164].
In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pof6p, the Rcy1p-homologue, has been identified through a two-hybrid interaction with Skp1. Both proteins are required for normal
septum processing and cell separation [165], a function
which may also require the exocyst function [166].
Previous to these works, a mutation sls2-1, was isolated in
Y. lipolytica that causes synthetic lethality when combined
with the conditional lethal mutation in the 7S RNA of the
signal recognition particle [167]. Rcy1p and Pof6p are the
homologues of Sls2p.

Conclusion
The sequencing of four hemiascomycetous yeasts has
allowed us to search for proteins involved in vesicular
transport by comparison with proteins identified in S. cerevisiae. The method used does not allow the identification
of a protein which does not exist in S. cerevisiae or does
not belong to a protein family. To identify new candidates, a list from other organism should be established or
experimental approach should be performed. The proteins identified are highly conserved between the five
yeasts but we have brought to light several specificities of
Y. lipolytica in keeping with its good protein secretion
capacities and its dimorphic aspect. In Table 1, we summarize these differences. Some of the proteins for which
we did not find homologues have probably a too divergent sequence to be identified through the BLAST searches
and may be identified in the future by functional screens.
But, the presence of Rab2p- and Rab4p-related proteins as
is found in fungi, a potential role of Rab2-related protein
and Ypt1p in vesicular transport between endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi and of Rab4-related protein in addition to Sls2p/Rcy1p in membrane recycling reflect the
greater complexity of the Y. lipolytica secretion pathway,
which is probably dictated by the necessity to secrete and
recycle membrane material needed for its filamentous
growth. In this work, we have shown that the Rab4prelated protein could have a role in this membrane recycling since a modification of the aspect of the colony, the
decrease of the number of cells undergoing dimorphic
transition and the change of the wall permeability of the
rab4 deleted strain were observed. The three Sso proteins
are also indicative of a large secretion capacity and a study
of this specificity would be interesting. As previously
shown through the diverse studies of Y. lipolytica, this
dimorphic yeast has a secretion pathway closer to the
mammalian one than has S. cerevisiae. Its translocation
apparatus is largely devoted to the co-translational translocation of nascent peptides through the endoplasmic

reticulum membrane as is seen in mammalian cells. C.
glabrata and K. lactis are the closest to S. cerevisiae for the
proteins listed. We found among the C. glabrata proteins,
2 COPII coat protein Sec13p-homologues and 2 Sec18phomologues implicated in the SNARE recycling and this
seems to be specific to this yeast. For K. lactis and D. hansenii, only one Ssop and one Sncp were detected. Though D.
hansenii is classified in Saccharomycetaceae, as is S. cerevisiae, and Y. lipolytica is a Dipodascacae, these two yeasts
seem closer at least for the proteins involved in vesicular
transport. These results are in agreement with the phylogenetic tree presented by Dujon et al [11]. In Fig. 7a, we
have shown the proportion of the 165 Y. lipolytica protein
sequences listed (see Additionnal file 2: Y. lipolytica column) with the greatest homology to S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, K. lactis, D. hansenii, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, N.
crassa, other fungi, animals and plants sequences (see
Additional file 7). 72% of these proteins are closest to
fungi and N. crassa. If we exclude animals, plants and
fungi (keeping only N. crassa) from this search (Fig. 7b),

we observed that 52% of the Y. lipolytica proteins listed are
closer to N. crassa. The last comparison is performed without N. crassa (Fig. 7c): in this case, 40% of the proteins are
closer to D. hansenii. This could reflect their common
physiology, the filamentous growth and good secretion
ability for Y. lipolytica and N. crassa and their proteolytic
and lipolytic activities and high salt tolerance [168] for Y.
lipolytica and D. hansenii. These results confirm that considering the identified proteins playing a role in vesicular
transport, Y. lipolytica is closer to the fungi than to S. cerevisiae. The proteins that are the best conserved between S.
cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica, are the SNARE proteins (see
Additional file 7). In Fig. 8a, we have presented the percentage of the Y. lipolytica proteins with the greatest homology to the S. cerevisiae and animal: 40% of these
proteins are closer to the animal ones, particularly, proteins of the AP complexes, Ypt and Arf proteins, TRAPP
and HOPS complexes (see Additional file 7), whereas for
S. cerevisiae, only 13% of these proteins are closer to animals than to Y. lipolytica (Fig. 8b, see Additional file 8).

Koumandou and coworkers [169] have analysed the protein sequences of tethering complexes and SM proteins
from five eukaryotic supergroups. They conclude that the
most recent common eukaryotic ancestor had a complex
endomembrane system with COG, Exocyst, Dsl1, GARP
tethering complexes which could have originated from
one common ancestral complex, TRAPP and HOPS complexes which are independently derived and all four SM
protein families represented. The phylogenetic tree presented by Dujon et al [11] indicates that Y. lipolytica may
be less distant from the last common eukaryotic ancestor
and the observation of a good sequence conservation

between Y. lipolytica and animal TRAPP and HOPS subunits for example, suggests that these complexes are
required for the evolution of multicellular organisms.
Similarly, Hall et al. [170] showed that Rab4p was an
ancient component of the endomembrane trafficking system since it exists, and its recycling function is conserved,
in Trypanosoma brucei which belongs to an eukaryotic
supergroup separated from that of yeast, fungi and animals. In Y. lipolytica also, the presence and the possible
recycling role of a Rab4-like protein was observed while in
S. cerevisiae and in the three other hemiascomycetous
yeasts, this protein has been lost. These observations indicate that S. cerevisiae has diverged further from the last
common eukaryotic ancestor than has Y. lipolytica, as far
as vesicle-mediated protein transport pathways are concerned and that Y. lipolytica has retained the complexity of
the trafficking system allowing evolution to a multicellular organization. So as has been said for fungi [171], we
can say that «Yarrowia lipolytica and humans are closer
than you think» and that this yeast constitutes an interesting model to study the secretion pathway.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
Escherichia coli strains DH5alpha (F'/endA1 hsdR17 (rKmK+) supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA (Nalr) relA1 Δ (lacIZYA-argF)
U169deoR (φ 80dlacΔ (lacZ)M15) was used as host strain
for bacterial transformations and plasmid propagation.

The Yarrowia lipolytica strain INAG136463 (MatB, scr1 : :
ADE1, SCR2, his-1, leu-2, ura3) was used for the inactivation of RAB4-related gene.
Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB medium (1% bactotryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl), 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 37°C. Yarrowia lipolytica cells were cultivated either
on rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone,
1% glucose), 28°C, or on minimal medium: 0.67% yeast
nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco laboratories),
2% glucose as carbon source, 50 mM phosphate buffer pH
6.8, 28°C with amino acids required and 1,25 mg/ml 5'fluoroorotic acid for ura3- strain selection.
Gene inactivation
Disruption was performed using the two-step «pop-in/
pop-out» method [172]. The disrupted gene was obtained
by the deletion of the BstEII-ClaI fragment of the RAB4related gene cloned between the HindIII-KpnI sites of the
p0 vector [173].
DNA techniques
Standard techniques were used according to Sambrook et
al. [174]. Enzymes were supplied by New England
Biolabs. All vectors inserts were checked by sequencing by
Genome express (France).
Transformation procedures
The E. coli strains were transformed by the method of
Chung and Miller [175].Y. lipolytica strain transformations
were carried out according to Xuan et al. [176].
Sensitivity to SDS and Calcofluor White
Cells of the INAG136463 (wt) and two clones (1, 5) of the
deleted rab4-related strains were grown in YPD medium.
5 μl droplets of serial dilutions of exponential growing
cultures of each strain were inoculated on the surface of
YPD plates containing 2.5 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml Calcofluor White (CW) or 0.0075 %, 0.015%, 0.03% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

internalization was stopped with 10 mM NaN3 and 10
mM NaF. Stained cells were visualized using fluorescence
optics [adapted from [159]].
Informatic analyses
Hemiascomycetous yeast genome sequences, BLAST
searches of vesicular secretion proteins and BLAST results
(performed Apr 25, 2003 with 1,093,702 sequences) were
obtained from the Génolevures web site [180]. S. cerevisiae sequences were collected from Saccharomyces Genome
Database [181]. BLASTs against protein databases were
obtained from NCBI (BLAST with 4,554,902 sequences)
[182] and Infobiogen web site [183]. Protein analyses
were done with NCBI Conserved Domain Architecture
Retrieval Tool [184], ExPASy Proteomics tools [185] and
CBS Prediction Servers [186].

A list of proteins implicated in S. cerevisiae vesicular secretion was made from literature. These S. cerevisiae protein
sequences were used for BLAST searches with the Génolevures web site. For protein families such as Rab protein,
autoBLAST, which means BLAST of a sequence against its
own genome, were made to identify all the members of
the family. The protein sequences of the new members
were identified by BLAST searches against the NCBI
eukaryotic protein sequences.
The percentages of proteins with the greatest homology
(Fig. 7 and 8) were determined by quantification of the
best E-values obtained with the BLAST searches against
the NCBI eukaryotic protein sequences.
