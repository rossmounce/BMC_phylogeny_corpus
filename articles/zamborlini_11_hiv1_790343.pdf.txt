Background
HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the integration of the reverse
transcribed viral cDNA into the cellular genome, a key
event of retroviral replication that is targeted by novel
anti-HIV therapeutic agents. Numerous studies have
contributed to understand of the molecular basis of integrase catalytic functions. Besides integration, HIV-1 integrase participates in other steps of viral replication such
as reverse transcription and/or uncoating, PIC nuclear
import and virion morphology. However, the underlying
mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Cellular and
viral factors assist integrase in performing its multiple
activities. Moreover, post-translational modifications (i.e.
acetylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation), which
represent a common, rapid and generally reversible
mechanism for fine tuning of protein activities, have also
been shown to regulate integrase functions.
Materials and methods and results
By in vitro SUMOylation assay and purification on NiNTA beads in denaturing conditions, we show that HIV1 integrase is covalently modified by the three SUMO
paralogues. By mutating SUMO-acceptor lysine residues
within phylogenetically conserved SUMOylation consensus motifs identified in silico, we demonstrate that they
represent major sites of SUMO conjugation. We introduced the same changes in the integrase sequence of a
plasmid encoding the viral genome, which was used to
generate mutant viral particles, and we compare their
infectivity to that of WT HIV-1. We find that viruses harboring SUMOylation-defective integrase mutants are less
infectious that the WT counterpart. Real-time PCR analysis of viral cDNA synthesis reveals that cells infected
with mutant viruses display similar content of traverse

transcripts, but a lower number of integrated proviruses,
than WT HIV-1-infected cells. This integration defect at
the integration step is not due to impairment of integrase
binding to LEDGF/p7S, a key chromatin-tethering factor
of HIV-1 pre-integration complex. Indeed, both WT and
SUMOylation-defective integrase proteins coprecipitated
with similar efficiency with LEDGF/p75. Finally, we
establish that SUMOylation-defective integrase mutants
retained WT catalytic activity as determined by Vprfusion protein complementation assay.

Conclusions
Here, we show that HIV-1 IN is modified by SUMO
proteins and that phylogenetically conserved SUMOylation consensus motifs represent major SUMO-acceptor
sites. Viruses harboring SUMOylation-site IN mutants
displayed a replication defect that was mapped during
the early stages of infection, before integration but after
reverse transcription. Since SUMOylation-defective IN
mutants retained WT catalytic activity as well as
LEDGF-binding, we hypothesize that SUMOylation
might regulate the affinity of IN for co-factors, contributing to efficient HIV-1 replication.
