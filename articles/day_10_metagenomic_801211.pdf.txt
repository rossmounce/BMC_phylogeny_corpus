Metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut RNA
virus community

Abstract
Viral enteric disease is an ongoing economic burden to poultry producers worldwide, and despite considerable
research, no single virus has emerged as a likely causative agent and target for prevention and control efforts.
Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses eluding
classification based solely on morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed
that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and
in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of
determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We utilized the Roche/454
Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many
of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular
on the turkey-origin members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey Picobirnaviruses.
Introduction
Enteric disease syndromes such as Poult Enteritis Complex (PEC) in young turkeys and Runting-Stunting Syndrome (RSS) in chickens are a continual economic
burden for poultry producers. The only reliable method
to reproduce the clinical signs of these syndromes in
experimental birds is oral inoculation with crude preparations of intestinal contents from naturally infected
birds. Further, the full spectrum of the field signs
observed associated with these syndromes is difficult to
reproduce experimentally with isolated viruses [1,2].
Numerous viruses are known to be circulating in turkey
flocks in the United States, with recent research efforts
targeting RNA viruses such as the turkey astroviruses,
novel turkey-origin reovirus, and avian rotavirus, and
DNA viruses such as the recently described turkey parvovirus [3-6]. However, there remains a possibility that
an unidentified virus or combination of viruses may play
a role in poultry enteric disease. Despite the isolation
and characterization of many of these suspect viruses,
the etiology of the poultry enteric disease syndromes

remains elusive, and many enteric viruses can be
detected in otherwise healthy turkey and chicken flocks
[3,4]. Regional and national enteric virus surveys have
revealed the ongoing presence of avian reoviruses, rotaviruses and astroviruses in turkey and chicken flocks,
with combinations of viruses often present in the poultry gut [3,4]. A non-biased, comprehensive approach to
virus discovery that would not require viral cultivation
would reveal a great deal about the complex viral community in the turkey gut. Further, a community-based
understanding of the viruses in the poultry gut will be
an invaluable asset in ongoing studies of the enteric disease syndromes and would be welcome knowledge to
poultry producers who rely upon efficient conversion of
feed in the gut to produce an economically important
commodity. A recent study utilizing a sequence-independent molecular screen of virus particle associated
nucleic acid (PAN) in chicken enteric samples identified
a novel chicken parvovirus (ChPV). This parvovirus is a
member of the Parvovirinae sub-family within the Parvoviridae, and a PCR-based diagnostic test has been
developed that targets the ChPV non-structural (NS)
gene [6,7].The success of this PAN procedure suggests
that similar approaches can be used for virus discovery
in the poultry gut [7]. Ultra high-throughput nucleic
acid pyrosequencing has emerged as a powerful

diagnostic technology that can be applied to determine
the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample [8]. Viral metagenomics can be specifically utilized to analyze viral sequences in just about any
sample type, and is a powerful tool for virus discovery
[9-13]. Further, viral metagenomics can be specifically
applied to the problem of determining etiology in diseases and disease syndromes with no known cause
[14-16]. In order to characterize the un-described
viruses present in the turkey gut, we utilized the Roche/
454 Life Sciences GS-FLX pyrosequencing platform to
compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkeys
experiencing enteric disease. The present analysis
focused on RNA viruses in the turkey gut due to the
large number of RNA viruses that have been identified
to date as possibly contributing to enteric disease and
poultry production problems. This approach yielded
numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
BLAST non-redundant (nr) protein database, many of
which have not been described in turkeys. These results
validate this metagenomic approach to identifying
known and novel RNA viruses in the poultry gut. The
sequence data generated via this approach will prove
useful in the molecular characterization of the viral constituency of the poultry gut, and will inform the selection of molecular diagnostic tests for enteric viruses.
This will facilitate the development of updated molecular diagnostic tests, and a more thorough knowledge of
the viral constituency in the poultry gut will lead to a
better understanding of the role viruses play in enteric
disease and in the performance of poultry flocks in
general.

Results and Discussion
The initial pyrosequencing runs produced in excess of
139,000,000 bases of high quality nucleotide sequence
with an average read length of 362. The sequence data
was used to assemble 6526 contigs ranging in size from
97 to 2578 bp, with the majority of contigs falling in the
range of approximately 250 to 450 bp. 4563 contigs produced no hits in the nr protein database using the blastx
search parameters and the MEGAN default settings. 724
contigs had similarity to sequences from cellular organisms, including bacteria, fungi and avian species. 788
contigs had similarity to RNA viral sequences, including
sequences from the dsRNA viruses (Reoviridae and
Picobirnaviruses), and the ssRNA viruses (Caliciviridae,
Leviviridae, Picornavirales, and Astroviridae) (Figure 1).
The number of cellular sequences in the present dataset
are likely due to the use of intestinal homogenates,
which included intestinal tissue in order to ensure the
discovery of cell-associated viruses in the submitted
samples. The tblastx search output produced a MEGAN

Page 2 of 8

taxon tree similar to the one presented in Figure 1 and
revealed that many of the unassigned contigs were similar to avian sequences.
The majority of the assigned viral contigs (620)
showed similarity to database sequences from the Picornavirales order and other picorna-like viruses, viruses
that, as a group, contain a positive sense single-stranded
RNA genome and a virion approximately 30 nm in diameter [17]. Recently, a retrospective study of electron
micrographs of enteric viruses from California turkeys
experiencing enteric disease revealed a large number of
“small round viruses” ranging in size from 15 to 30 nm,
like most members of the Picornavirales [18]. These
small round viruses are present in turkeys across a
range of ages, but they have only been identified morphologically, making specific identification difficult.
Avian enterovirus-like viruses have been described for
years in domestic poultry; again this designation has
historically been made based primarily upon morphological characterization, and little is known about their
pathogenicity or their transmission characteristics[19]. It
is unclear what role these picornaviruses and picornalike viruses may play in turkey enteric disease or in turkey performance in general, but the presence of picornaviruses in other agricultural species has been closely
associated with enteric disease, namely in pigs and cattle [20-23]. Members of the Picornavirales also infect
avian species, with the etiologic agents of duck hepatitis
(DH) in ducklings and avian encephalomyelitis (AE) in
several poultry species both being picornaviruses
[24,25]. The present metagenomic analysis has identified
RNA sequences with homology to seven of the nine
recognized picornavirus genera [26], with the largest
proportion of the sequences bearing homology to the
Kobuvirus genus.
The picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are a relatively recently
described group of viruses that contain dsRNA, bi-segmented genomes and have non-enveloped capsids generally around 35 nm in diameter [27]. Since their initial
description, the PBVs have been detected in enteric
samples from several mammalian hosts, including
humans [28-30]. A PBV has been described in chickens
based upon morphological characterization and electropherotyping, along with a similar virus with an apparent
tri-segmented genome [31]. The chicken PBV was not
specifically associated with enteric disease. PBVs have
been associated with gastroenteritis in humans [32,33],
but a recent metagenomic analysis of the viral community in feces from healthy human volunteers revealed a
relatively large number of PBV sequences [11]. Interestingly, PBVs have been detected in humans together with
rotaviruses and astroviruses [32,34]. Phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
gene (RdRp) reveals that the putative turkey-origin PBV

Materials and Methods).

identified in the present metagenomic analysis is unique
among the available PBV sequences, which include
PBVs from humans, pigs, dogs, rats, snakes and municipal raw sewage (Figure 2). At the nucleotide level, the
portion of the turkey-origin PBV used for the alignment
and subsequent phylogenetic analysis shared from 49.5
to 70% sequence identity with the PBV sequences
selected from the database; the highest identity was with
the PBV detected in raw sewage in Washington state.
The family Caliciviridae includes four genera: Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus [26]. The present metagenomic analysis revealed nucleic acid with
homology to database sequences from the Sapovirus and
Lagovirus genera. The Sapovirus genus includes viruses
that cause enteritis in swine and humans, and the Lagoviruses infect rabbits and hares (lagomorphs) [26]. In a
phylogenetic analysis using a ~300 amino acid portion
of ORF1 polyprotein homologous to the conserved Ploop NTPase superfamily, the putative turkey-origin
Calicivirus grouped with the porcine enteric Sapoviruses

(Figure 3). In general, the Sapoviruses are a very genetically heterogeneous genus [35], with numerous genogroups recognized, and many porcine Sapoviruses are
related to human strains [36]; it will be interesting to
determine the place the novel turkey caliciviruses hold
in this genus, and it is notable that the portion of the
ORF polyprotein analyzed in this study shared only 23.2
to 35% amino acid sequence identity with the Calicivirus
isolates included in the alignment and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
The appearance of avian reovirus and avian astrovirus
sequences in the present analysis is not surprising, since
these viruses are widespread in turkeys and chickens
[3-5], and a good deal of recent research has helped to
characterize the roles these viruses play in the poultry
enteric syndromes [1,2,37-39]. The turkey astrovirus
revealed using this metagenomic approach was most
similar to the previously described type 2 turkey astroviruses (TAstV-2), which are very common in the turkey
intestine [3]. The avian reovirus genes revealed using

this approach–namely the lambdaA core protein gene,
the non-structural protein muC, and the structural protein muB–have not been described in turkeys previously,
but they have homology to previously described avian
reovirus genome segments [40,41].

This first look at the turkey gut viral community using
metagenomics has revealed a great deal of novel RNA
virus sequence, and this analysis is a step toward identifying some of these undescribed, small enteric viruses.
The dataset includes samples from areas that historically

have had problems with enteric disease and includes a
range of flock ages. The samples were collected regardless of the present enteric disease status of the flocks to
ensure that the viral flora had not been perturbed by
advanced enteric disease signs and due to the numerous

observations that enteric viruses are often present in
healthy birds [3,4]. The sequence data generated via this
approach will prove useful in the molecular characterization of the viral constituency of the poultry gut, and
will inform the selection of molecular diagnostic tests

for enteric viruses. Further, this study sets the stage for
subsequent comparative metagenomic analyses to determine the viruses commonly found in flocks with enteric
syndromes versus the viral constituency of healthy
flocks, for regional comparisons of circulating enteric
viruses, and for comparing specific management and
nutritional techniques and their effect on the gut
microbiome.

Materials and methods
Gut samples receipt and preparation

With the cooperation of industry stakeholders, complete
intestinal tracts (from duodenum/pancreas to cloaca,
including cecal tonsils) from five turkey farms in North
Carolina, U.S.A. with histories of enteric disease problems were received at the Southeast Poultry Research
Laboratory in October 2008. Five complete intestinal
tracts from each farm were collected. The intestines were
processed promptly via blending into a ~20% homogenate in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were
pooled into a single sample. This pooled intestinal homogenate represented turkeys ranging in age from 7 days to
34 days. After 5000 rpm (2400 × G) and 7500 rpm (5500
× G) centrifugation steps (15 min, 4°C) to clarify the
homogenate (SLA 1500 SuperLite rotor, Sorvall), a stepwise filtration process involving 0.8 μm, 0.45 μm, and 0.2
μm cutoff bottle filters (Nalgene) was used to remove
large particles and bacteria. Virus-sized particles were
pelleted by ultracentrifugation (5 hr., 113,000 × G, 4°C).
Viral RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

The virus particle pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and treated with RNAse A (Invitrogen) to
remove unencapsidated (non-viral) RNA. Total RNA was
extracted from the pellet using TRIZOL-LS reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was further purified from the TRIZOLLS aqueous phase using the MagMax Viral RNA isolation
kit (Ambion)[42]. This RNA sample was treated with
Turbo DNAse (Ambion) to minimize any remaining DNA.
cDNA was generated with random hexamers using the
Invitrogen SuperScript Choice System and was ligated to
the included EcoRI/NotI double-stranded oligonucleotide
adapters and sephacryl column purified per the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR using an EcoRI/NotI adapter primer (5’-CGG CCG CGT CGA C-3’) was used to amplify
the cDNA. An initial PCR reaction of 50 μl was split into 5
equal reactions prior to thermal cycling (94°C for 30s, 55°C
for 30s, 72°C for 2 min, times 35 cycles, followed by an
extension at 72°C for 7 min). The reactions were pooled
and purified (Qiagen MinElute PCR cleanup kit).
High throughput sequencing and analysis

The amplified cDNA was utilized in high-throughput
nucleic acid sequencing using Genome Sequencer FLX

Carolina turkeys in 2009 (calicivirus positive) and 2010 (picornavirus
positive).

Titanium pyrosequencing technology and reagents
(Roche). Contigs were assembled using the gsAssembler software (454 Life Sciences) using stringent parameters (50 bp overlap with 95% identity). Using the
assembled contigs as query sequences, the blast nonredundant (nr) protein database (GenBank) was
searched using the blastx and tblastx programs. The
blastx and tblastx output was compiled and contigs
were assigned to taxa with MEGAN using the default
LCA algorithm parameters [43]. Nucleotide and amino
acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW and phylogenetic trees were prepared using MEGA4; the relationship of the sequences was inferred using the
Neighbor-Joining method, which was determined to be
a computationally efficient method to deal with datasets of this size and produced single trees to illustrate
an initial placement of these novel viruses among
available sequences [44]. In order to confirm directly
the presence of picobirnavirus and calicivirus
sequences in gut samples, the metagenomic contigs
were utilized to design RT-PCR primers to amplify
portions of the picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) and calicivirus ORF1 polyprotein.
These primers were subsequently used to amplify viral
sequences in the original RNA prep used to create the
metagenome and in archived turkey intestinal samples
from North Carolina, U.S.A (Figure 4).
