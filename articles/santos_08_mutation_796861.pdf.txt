Abstract
Background: Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been extensively used in population and
evolutionary genetics studies. Thus, a valid estimate of human mtDNA evolutionary rate is
important in many research fields. The small number of estimations performed for the coding
region of the molecule, showed important differences between phylogenetic and empirical
approaches. We analyzed a portion of the coding region of mtDNA (tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle
genes), using individuals belonging to extended families from the Azores Islands (Portugal) with the
main aim of providing empirical estimations of the mutation rate of the coding region of mtDNA
under different assumptions, and hence to better understand the mtDNA evolutionary process.
Results: Heteroplasmy was detected in 6.5% (3/46) of the families analyzed. In all of the families
the presence of mtDNA heteroplasmy resulted from three new point mutations, and no cases of
insertions or deletions were identified. Major differences were found in the proportion and type
of heteroplasmy found in the genes studied when compared to those obtained in a previous report
for the D-loop. Our empirical estimation of mtDNA coding region mutation rate, calculated taking
into account the sex of individuals carrying new mutations, the probability of intra-individual
fixation of mutations present in heteroplasmy and, to the possible extent, the effect of selection, is
similar to that obtained using phylogenetic approaches.
Conclusion: Based on our results, the discrepancy previously reported between the human
mtDNA coding region mutation rates observed along evolutionary timescales and estimations
obtained using family pedigrees can be resolved when correcting for the previously cited factors.

Background
There are several reasons why the mitochondrial genome
(mtDNA) of humans as well as of other mammalians has
been considered to be useful in population genetics, phylogeographic, and phylogenetic studies. Besides the usu-

ally invoked mtDNA characteristics (high copy number
per cell, compact organization and maternal transmission), mtDNA has been widely used because it provides
easy access to an orthologous set of genes with little or no
recombination and rapid evolution [1]. Moreover, from a

theoretical perspective, it has been accepted for a long
time that mtDNA haplotype frequencies are controlled
primarily by migration and genetic drift and that most of
the variation within a species is selectively neutral [1].
However, more recent reports sustain the hypothesis that
mtDNA frequency variation is due to natural selection [24].
Given the importance of mitochondrial function, it is not
straightforward to assume a priori that mtDNA evolves as
a strictly neutral marker. Changes in the mtDNA sequence
can have substantial impacts on the fitness of the
organelle/cell (within individuals) and on the fitness of
the individual host organism. Deviations from a strictly
neutral model of evolution have been found in a variety
of organisms [5-9]. Ballard and Rand [1], in a revision,
gave three main reasons why it is reasonable to predict
that mtDNA variation may be under strong selection: i)
Mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell and, in most
organisms, a reduction in ATP production is expected to
reduce fecundity. In humans, a reduction in the efficiency
of ATP production is known to be highly deleterious or
lethal in the extreme case; ii) Proteins from mtDNA interact with those imported from the nuclear genome to form
four of the five complexes of the electron transport chain;
and iii) The assumption of total absence of recombination
in mtDNA means that each genome has a single genealogical history and all genes will share that history. Any evolutionary force acting at any one site will equally affect the
history of the whole molecule. Thus, the fixation of an
advantageous mutation by selection, for example, will
cause the fixation of all other polymorphisms by a process
known as "genetic hitchhiking" [10]. Even the quickly
evolving non-coding mtDNA region (D-loop) cannot be
assumed to have neutral allele frequencies: It is linked to
the rest of the genome (where selection has been documented) and conserved motifs within this region exhibit
variation that affects mitochondrial transcription and replication in significant ways [11]. Alternatively, polymorphism within a mitochondrial genome may be depressed
through selection against linked deleterious mutations, a
process known as "background selection" [12-14].
Besides the significance of mtDNA selection per se, the
assessment of the impact of selection in mtDNA is crucial
in the establishment of mtDNA evolutionary rate, as was
previously demonstrated by Denver et al. [7]. In a strict
neutral model of evolution, the substitution rate depends
only on the mutation rate per individual; however, if there
was any, even if slight, effect of selection this would not be
true. According to Ohta [15,16] very slightly deleterious
mutants are effectively selected against in populations
large enough; however these same mutants should be governed by random drift in small populations behaving as
selectively neutral. Thus, small populations may accumu-

late deleterious mitochondrial mutations at an increased
rate [17].
Human mtDNA substitution rate has been estimated
using mainly phylogenetic [18-29] and empirical methods [30-37]. Estimations for the D-loop, based on phylogenetic approaches, range from 0.0575 mutations/site/
Myr [20] to 0.2860 mutations/site/Myr [21], whereas estimations using an empirical methodology range from 0
mutations/site/Myr [33,35] to 2.5 mutations/site/Myr
[32]. On what concerns the coding region, the few estimations performed so far showed that the substitution rate of
the coding region is ~10 times lower than that reported for
the D-loop; furthermore, and as observed for the D-loop,
important differences between phylogenetic and empirical estimations have been pinpointed [31]. Mishmar et al.
[2] applying a phylogenetic approach to complete
sequences of the coding mtDNA region obtained a substitution rate of 0.0126 mutations/site/Myr, whereas Howell
et al. [31], using an empirical estimation for the coding
region of mtDNA, report a value of 0.075 mutations/site/
Myr.
Since the first empirical D-loop estimation of mtDNA
evolutionary rate by Howell et al. [30] an intense debate
about the causes of the discrepancies between phylogenetic and empirical rates has taken place [9,31,34,36-40].
Such discrepancy has been attributed to distinct causes,
namely: to differences in the rate of mutation at different
mtDNA positions; to the effect of selection and genetic
drift; to the occurrence of somatic mutations; to the unintended sequencing of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes; and to the leakage of paternal mtDNA and
recombination. Moreover Ho et al. [9,41] described an
acceleration of the rate of substitution at evolutionarily
short timescales and among other factors, the authors
attributed this acceleration to purifying selection acting
on mtDNA [9,41]. However, Emerson [42] reanalyzing
the data of Ho et al. [9] suggested that it would seem that
the time-scale upon which the pedigree rate converges to
the evolutionary rate is very much shorter than the timescale that Ho et al. [9] have focused on, and it is debatable
whether this convergence would follow an exponential
distribution, or if such a pattern existed, whether it could
not be equally explained by coalescent effects.
Recently, we reported on the mtDNA mutation rate of the
D-loop [37], using an empirical approach. Our results
supported the conclusion that the discrepancy between
phylogenetic and pedigree derived rates cannot be attributed neither to the inclusion of somatic mutations in calculations, nor to the use of families with mtDNA disease,
or even to paternal contribution of mtDNA. Moreover, the
discrepancy cannot be justified by the fact that mutations
observed in families occurred preferentially in hypervaria-

ble sites. Santos et al. [37] advanced two additional factors
that must be taken into account: the gender of individuals
carrying germinal mutations (mutations carried exclusively by men will never be passed to the next generation)
and "the weight" of heteroplasmic germinal mutations
(for mutations in mtDNA to reach polymorphism levels
in the population â and eventually become fixed â it is
first necessary that they pass from an heteroplasmic to an
homoplasmic state, at the individual level, and this will be
dictated by the initial levels of heteroplasmy).
To date there are only two studies that deal with the
empirical mutation rate estimation of coding mtDNA
region [31,35]. Moreover, the discussion of the effect of
selection in the fate of new arising mutations in coding
and non-coding portions of mtDNA has not been fully
addressed. In this work we present the results of the analysis of a portion of the coding region of mtDNA, using
individuals belonging to extended families from the
Azores Islands (Portugal). The main aims are: a) to provide empirical estimations of the mutation rate of the coding region of mtDNA under different assumptions, and b)
to better understand the mtDNA evolutionary process,
including the factors that control the levels and progress
of mtDNA heteroplasmy until the intraindividual fixation
of new arising mutations.
Heteroplasmy was detected in 6.5% of the families analyzed. In all of the families the presence of mtDNA heteroplasmy resulted from three new point mutations, and no
cases of insertions or deletions were identified. Our
empirical estimation of mtDNA coding region mutation
rate, calculated taking into account several factors is similar to that obtained using phylogenetic approaches.

Results
tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle genes sequence analysis in
Azorean pedigrees
The mtDNA coding region between nucleotide positions
3230 and 4331 (numbering according to Andrews et al.
[43]), was fully sequenced in 208 individuals from the
most recent generation and in 7 of their relatives (4 mothers, 2 grand-mothers and 1 father) (Fig. 1). The sequences
of tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle obtained are available as
additional file (see Additional file 1).

From the 208 individuals first analyzed, six appear to
present mtDNA heteroplasmy in the fragment of the coding region that was analyzed. The six individuals presenting heteroplasmy belong to three distinct families, which
will be further described. Thus, 6.5% (3/46) of the families present mtDNA heteroplasmy produced by mutations
in the region analyzed. In all of the cases, heteroplasmy
was produced by a point mutation and no cases of insertions or deletions have been detected.

Description and segregation of heteroplasmy in tRNALeu,
ND1 and tRNAIle genes
In Table 1, the individuals carrying heteroplasmy, the heteroplasmic positions and the levels of heteroplasmy
(ascertained by the height of peaks in the electropherogram and by clone counting) are presented for each family. In Table 2, the type and functional implication of
mutation, and the nucleotide in the homoplasmic individuals of the family and in reference sequences [28,44],
is presented for each heteroplasmic position. Moreover,
the number of hits, based on the mtDNA phylogeny [45]
is also presented.

(84.95%T:15.05%C) as the result of a T->C mutation in
position 3396 (Table 1). This mutation, although in a
coding region, is a synonymous mutation since it does not
imply an aminoacid change and the mitotype C(3396) was
detected, although at low frequency, at the population
level (Table 2). In this family the reported heteroplasmy
may have resulted from a somatic mutation that occurred
in the individual herself, or alternatively, it may have
resulted from germline mutations that occurred in the
oocyte from which the heteroplasmic individual developed. Thus, it is not clear if this mutation can be transmitted to the next generation.

Families showing point heteroplasmy can be subdivided
into:

heteroplasmy produced by a point mutation:

1) One family in which only one individual presented
heteroplasmy produced by a point mutation:

ysis of their mother (III3) and grandmother (II1) showed
the presence of very low levels of heteroplasmy in the
mother (95.90%A:4.10%G) and the absence of heteroplasmy in the grandmother. Thus, it is likely that the transition from A to G in position 3260 occurred in individual
III3 and was transmitted to individuals IV3 and IV4.
- Family JS (Fig. 1): The 3230â4331 region was first
sequenced in four maternally related individuals (3 men
and 1 woman). From these, one man (II5) showed
medium levels of heteroplasmy (65.70%A:34.30%G),
whereas another man (III1) and one woman (III2)
showed low levels of heteroplasmy (88.05%A:11.95%G
and 94.15%A:5.85%G respectively) (Table 1). The heteroplasmy resulted from a point mutation in position 3602
of the ND1 gene (Table 1). This mutation is a non-synonymous mutation that changes the aminoacid residue 99 of
the ND1 sub-unit from asparagine to serine. The subsequent analysis of their maternal ancestors (I2, II2 and II3)
showed the presence of low levels of heteroplasmy in all
of them (G(3602) mitotype in a frequency inferior to 17%).
Thus, it was not possible to identify directly the individual
where the mutation arose and, by consequence, the ancestral state for this position in this family. If we take into
account that this position appears to be invariant at the
population level (100% A) (Table 2) and that the state in
the reference sequences [28,44] is an adenine, we can
hypothesize that this mutation could represent an A to G
change at position 3602. As the conservation index of this
mutation is 100%, we may consider that it may have some
functional consequence and that is not neutral. However,
at this point we cannot predict if, this mutation will be
deleterious or beneficial.
Overall Analysis of Mutations: mutation pattern and
mutation rate in tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle genes
We detected three transitions that gave rise to heteroplasmy in three distinct positions. One can be somatic or
germinal and two can be considered germinal (Table 2).
One mutation was detected in the tRNALeu and the other
two were found in the ND1 gene. All the mutations take
place at sites that present a very low number of hits in the
mtDNA phylogeny, a high conservation index, and that
don't appear to be polymorphic in human populations.

In 311 mtDNA transmissions we detected three substitutions in the 1102 bp analyzed (positions 3230 to 4331:
tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle genes), which implies that
0.0096 new mutations arise (at a detectable level) in each
generation, corresponding to 8.7Ã10-6 mutations/site/
generation. If we employ the same definition of mutation
used by other authors (for example Howell et al. [31]),
only mutations for which there is evidence that they are
germinal should be considered (see Table 2). This implies
that the mutation rate would be reduced to 2 mutations in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/167

311 mtDNA transmissions, that is, 0.0064 mutations/
generation for the entire region or 5.8Ã10-6 mutations/
site/generation (95% CI: 0â13.61Ã10-6). This last value is
~4 times higher than that reported by Howell et al. [31]
for the coding region (1.5Ã10-6 mutations/site/generation) and ~3 times lower than that reported by Santos et
al. [37] for the D-loop using the same criteria of including
only germinal mutations. Assuming that the generational
time is 25 years, the mutation rate in the coding fragment
analyzed would be 0.2334 mutations/site/Myr (95% CI:
0â0.544). As in the study of Howell et al. [31], this empirical estimation of mutation rate for the coding region is
much higher than estimations obtained by phylogenetic
methods (Table 3).

Discussion
Proportion and type of heteroplasmy: coding region vs Dloop
The analysis of individuals belonging to 46 families of
Azorean ancestry (Fig. 1) reveals that in 6.5% of the families there is at least one individual that presents mtDNA
heteroplasmy produced by mutation in the analyzed coding region. This value is significantly lower than that
obtained by Santos et al. [37] for the D-loop (72.9% â 35
of 48 families) using almost the same set of families (Proportion test: Z = -6.556; p < 0.0001). This difference is still
significant (Proportion test: Z = -2.009; p = 0.0222) if only
point heteroplasmy is considered for the D-loop (20.8%
â 10 of 48 families).

As expected in the relative absence of selection, coding
homopolymers suffer the same mutational mechanism as
those in noncoding regions [7]. However, notable differences between the coding fragment under analysis and the
D-loop were also observed in the behavior of the poly-C
tracts located in the ND1 gene (Table 4). The poly-C tracts
of both hypervariable regions I and II are known to have
high insertion/deletion rates, thus originating length heteroplasmy [46]. This type of heteroplasmy is represented
by multiple populations of mtDNA containing poly-C
stretches of various lengths [47]. Santos et al. [37]
reported length heteroplasmy produced by the insertion
of cytosine residues in the poly-C tract of HVRI and HVRII
respectively in 22.92% and 54.16% of the families studied
(Table 4). It is accepted that a general mechanism for generating such variability would be replication slippage
[48]; in fact, mispairing during replication of repeated
sequences, including homopolymers has been commonly
suggested to explain length variation in DNA of prokaryotic, eukaryotic and cytoplasmic origin. However, no
cases of length heteroplasmy were found in the ND1 polyC tracts. Moreover, in a population database of almost
~1500 sequences no instance of insertions or deletions in
this region was observed (Table 4). To better address this
question, we selected for analysis all the poly-C tracts

across the human mtDNA genome that present similar
features to that of the hypervariable regions: a minimum
of seven cytosine residues that may be or not interrupted
by another base. For the 14 regions retained, variation
produced by insertion or deletion of cytosine residues
were only observed in non-coding regions and in the 12S
sub-unit of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Table 4). In the 12S
rRNA we identified two repetitive regions (Table 4); however, only one is polymorphic. The polymorphic region of
12S rRNA is located in an internal loop of the secondary
structure whereas the non-polymorphic is located in a
stem; this agrees with the Ruiz-Pesini and Wallace [49]
observation that stem nucleotides are under greater selective constraint than loop nucleotides and it seems that the
insertion/deletion of cytosine residues located in this loop
would not interfere with the secondary structure of the
rRNA. Therefore, differences in mutational patterns
observed between coding and non-coding regions (or less
functionally relevant regions) are likely the result of selection, operating at the most basic levels of organization,
the cell or even the mitochondrion.
Factors influencing mutation rate estimation in pedigrees
The mutation rate obtained for the coding region of
mtDNA considering only germinal mutations was 0.2334
mutations/site/Myr, the highest value reported so far, and

much higher than those obtained by phylogenetic methods (Table 3). Moreover, empirical estimations for the Dloop and for the coding region of mtDNA (see Table 3 and
references therein), clearly show that the evolutionary rate
was higher for the D-loop, as it was previously demonstrated by other works [31,41].
The possible causes for the discrepancy between phylogenetic and empirical estimations of mutation rate will be
discussed further ahead, implicating mainly the process
by which heteroplasmy is resolved as well as the effect of
sex proportion and selection at the different nested hierarchies of populations covered by the mtDNA molecule
(the organelle, the cell, the tissue, the organism, and so on
up through natural populations and species) [8].
For the coding region analyzed, confirmed germinal
mutations occurred in very stable positions conserved
among species. These results reinforce our previous observations for the D-loop [37] that the discrepancy observed
in the mutation rate reported in family and phylogenetic
studies can not be attributed to the inclusion of somatic
mutations in calculations or to the use of families with
mtDNA disease, neither to the occurrence of mutations
preferentially in hypervariable sites. As it was previously
realized by Santos et al. [37], there are other factors that

may be considered in the estimation of mutation rate
using empirical approaches; mainly, the sex of individuals
where new mutations were found (this correction would
be the equivalent of considering the effective population
size for the coalescent estimation of the mutation rate, N,
for the mtDNA [50]), as well as the probability of intraindividual fixation of the new arising mutations (for a
detailed explanation see Santos et al. [37]).
The accuracy of the proposed corrections can be ascertain
by two different results: 1) if we consider the data of Heyer
et al. [36] (only homoplasmic mutations were found and
the number of men and women analyzed were similar)
and we correct for gender proportion the mutation rate
would be 5.85Ã10-6mutations/site/generation, a value
similar to that obtained by Santos et al. [37] for the Dloop, after correcting for the sex of transmitters and for the
presence of heteroplasmy; 2) the value obtained for the Dloop [37], after correcting for sex and heteroplamy is similar to that reported by Ho et al. [41] using population
data (Table 3).
It is important to note that our study addresses a different
question to that analyzed by Ho et al. [9,41]. While they
are analyzing the discrepancies in the "rate of change"
when it is estimated using short or long-term calibration
points, our concern is precisely the process inside the rate
of change, i.e., the factors responsible for the differences
between the mutation and substitution rates. Therefore,
in the comparisons of Ho et al. [9,41] the short-term
points are represented by populations, where the mutations observed are already fixed at least at the individual
level (they do not report any effect derived from heteroplasmic mutations). Moreover, our results support the
idea proposed by Emerson [42] that it would seem likely
that the time-scale upon which the pedigree rate converges to the evolutionary rate is very much shorter than
the timescale which Ho et al. [9] have focused on. Furthermore, we have to consider the higher uncertainty surrounds the estimation of short-term mutation rates than
in the estimation of long-term rates [9]. This uncertainty
results from the fact that smaller errors in calibration
points may have larger consequences in short-term mutation rates and "because as the calibrations move closer to
the present, there is a decreasing amount of information
in the sequences" [41]. Even when using ancient DNA
sequences, as proposed by Ho et al. [41], we should consider that an haplotype observed at any given time could
represent a time span of thousands of years, so radiocarbon dates will provide an additional source of error in
determining the actual age of the haplotype.
Assuming that the correction for sex and heteroplasmy are
important to empirically estimate the evolutionary rate of
mtDNA, if we take into account these two factors, and we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/167

assume that mutations detected are neutral or nearly neutral (and by consequence that the probability that the new
variant will eventually become fixed â homoplasmic â in
the individual is approximately the proportion of the new
variant) the number of new mutations that can be fixed at
the individual level decreased to 0.202 (if only confirmed
germinal mutations are included) â 0.3525 (if all the
mutation are included) and by consequence the mutation
rate would be reduced to 0.0236 mutations/site/Myr â
0.0411 mutations/site/Myr (Table 3). However, our data
clearly evidences that some of the mutations detected cannot be considered neutral and by consequence its probability of intra-individual fixation may be smaller than the
frequency in heteroplasmic individuals. As referred by
Santos et al. [37] a suitable strategy to solve this problem
would be to empirically estimate the proportion of intraindividual fixation by observing the number of heteroplasmic transmissions that become fixed for the new variant. In these circumstances, all the factors affecting the
segregation of heteroplasmy, including selection, would
be averaged and therefore implicitly considered. Furthermore, assuming that selection pressure will be similar at
the intra-individual level and the population level, the
rate of mutations that reach intra-individual fixation will
be similar to the rate of population (and species) fixation.
This means that only neutral and mildly deleterious mutations will be fixed at an intra-individual level but not deleterious mutations, as is observed in the majority of
mitochondrial diseases in which the mutant type never
reaches intra-individual fixation. Selection, however,
could still modify the population fixation rate in cases in
which a change in environment modifies the selective
pressure [4]. Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot empirically estimate the probability of intra-individual fixation
and we will try to access this question by indirect
approaches.
The new mutation arising in family AV in position 3260
has been associated with the development of maternally
inherited myopathy and cardiomyopathy [51,52]; the
wild-type A(3260) is normally bound to the U(3272) as part
of a 4 bp palindrome that forms the anticodon stem of the
tRNALeu(UUR) cloverleaf, the G(3260) mutation creates a
non-standard base pair with the corresponding U(3272).
The A-U pair is highly conserved through mammalian
species [29] and it is probable that the G(3260) affects the
stability of the tRNA anticodon stem [51]. The biochemical analysis of oxygen consumption in transformant
cybrids suggested that for the G(3260) mutation the threshold for detectable impairment of mitochondrial respiration is higher than 60% mutant mtDNA [52]. Moreover,
all symptomatic patients described by Zeviani et al. [51]
had a percentage of mutated mitotypes in muscle of at
least 87%, whereas one unaffected individual had a percentage of mutant molecules of around 78%. These obser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/167

vations are consistent with our finding that the
individuals used in this study are healthy individuals,
since the percentages of mutant mtDNA detected in the
three individuals of AV family are lower than 20%. The
challenge is now to predict the fate of this new arising
pathogenic mutation; the IV3 man cannot transmit the
new mutation; however her sister can have descendents
carrying the mutation. Assuming that selection will not
act against the G variant, the fate of the mutation will be
entirely governed by drift. According to the model proposed by Santos et al. [37] (that allowed us to predict the
probability that a variant drift from ~20% of copies to
more than 60% in one generation) it is unlikely that the
disease will affect the children of IV4. Moreover, even if
this mutation can reach fixation at the individual-level in
a future generation, it would never reach fixation at the
population level, unless an environmental change, or any
factor relaxing the selective pressure, reduce its negative
effect. Mitochondrial DNA evolution at the population
level may be modulated for example by the climatic variables [4] or by the diet of individuals [29].

and non-coding regions of mtDNA. If we assume that
mutations occur randomly in mtDNA genome, the
present results support the idea that newly arising mutations in the coding region are eliminated probably at the
organelle and cell levels, before they reach a detectable frequency in heteroplasmy. Moreover, some of the mutations found in heteroplasmy in the coding region would
never reach fixation at the individual level, since they
appear to be deleterious, and would be latter eliminated.

The non-synonymous A to G mutation at position 3602
was not described so far, both at the population level or
associated to pathology. The conservation index of this
position is 100% indicating that it has a functional relevance and that probably is not neutral. The problem here
is to determine if this mutation has a negative or positive
effect. At this time, it is difficult to determine this issue
without any functional assay. Furthermore, we cannot
predict if weather, or any other factor, will change in the
future, changing in turn the effect of the mutation.

Methods

Taking together these evidences, the number of mutations
that reach fixation at the individual level should range
from 0 (if both germinal mutations detected are considered to be deleterious) to 0.02 (if it is assumed that the
mutation in position 3602 is in fact neutral). This represents a mutation rate for the coding fragment analyzed
ranging between 0 mutations/site/Myr and 0.0023 mutations/site/Myr and similar to that obtained using phylogenetic approaches (Table 3). If we include the mutation in
position 3396, the mutation rate for the coding fragment
analyzed ranges between 0.0176 mutations/site/Myr and
0.0199 mutations/site/Myr. These value are similar to that
values reported by phylogenetic estimations (Table 3).

Conclusion
Given the importance of mitochondrial function, changes
in the mtDNA sequence can have a substantial impact on
the fitness of the organelle/cell/individual and may be
eliminated at the different levels of organization of
mtDNA. Our results are in agreement with this assumption. First of all, major differences were detected in the
proportion and type of heteroplasmy found in the coding

Our empirical estimation of mtDNA coding region mutation rate, calculated taking into consideration the sex of
individuals carrying new mutations, the probability of
intra-individual fixation of mutations present in heteroplasmy and the effect of selection, is similar to that
obtained using phylogenetic approaches. Based on our
results, the discrepancy previously reported between the
human mtDNA coding region mutation rate observed
along evolutionary timescales and estimations obtained
using family pedigrees can be understood when correcting
for the above cited factors.

Genealogies and Samples
The genealogical information and sample databank were
previously described in Santos et al. [37]. All the individuals included in the sample bank were informed by members of the research team about the aims and ethical
guidelines of the project and signed an informed consent
form before the sampling procedure, conducted by mouth
scrap. For this work, we selected 406 individuals belonging to 46 independent mtDNA lineages and corresponding to 311 mtDNA transmissions (Fig. 1).
General Strategy
The analysis of the samples was done following a strategy
similar to that used in Santos et al. [37], with 5 main steps:

1) DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing of
the region that encompasses the tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle
genes, of the individuals from the most recent generation
(represented by filled black squares and circles in Figure
1); 2) Confirmation by a second PCR amplification and
sequencing of the individuals that appeared to be heteroplasmic in step 1; 3) DNA extraction, PCR amplification
and sequencing of the ancestors of individuals confirmed
as heteroplasmic in step 2 (individuals represented by half
tone squares and circles in Figure 1). Whenever heteroplasmy was not present in the mother, the paternal
mtDNA was analyzed to exclude a possible paternal contribution; 4) To authenticate results an independent DNA
extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing were subsequently performed for all individuals showing heteroplasmy; 5) Cloning and sequencing of multiple clones of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:167

individuals that presented heteroplasmy and that are relevant to the mutation rate calculation.
mtDNA analysis
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
DNA from the buccal cells was extracted using the
JETQUICK Blood and Cell DNA Purification Kit
(Genomed) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The mtDNA region from position 3120 to 5129
(according to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence
â CRS [43]), was amplified using new designed primers LMT3120 (5'-CCTGTACGAAAGGACAAGAG-3') and HMT5129 (5'-GTTGAGTAGTAGGAATGCGGT-3'). The new
primers were verified, using the BLAST procedure, to prevent the amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes. The PCR reaction program involved an initial 5
min. denaturation step at 94Â°C followed by 35 cycles of
94Â°C for 1 min., 57Â°C for 45 s and 72Â°C for 2 min., and
a final extension step of 7 min. at 72Â°C. PCR products
were purified using the JETQUICK PCR Purification Spin
Kit (Genomed).

All samples were fully sequenced between positions 3230
and 4331 (tRNALeu, ND1 and tRNAIle genes) using four
new designed primers, two in the direct direction [LMT3120 (5'-CCTGTACGAAAGGACAAGAG-3') and LMT3746 (5'-CCATCATTCTACTATCAACA-3')] and two in
the reverse direction [H-MT3889 (5'-GGTTGGTCTCTGCTAGTGTG-3') and H-MT4432 (5'-GGCCCGATAGCTTATTTAG-3')]. Sequence reactions were carried out using
the sequencing kit BigDyeÂ® Terminator v.3 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's specifications
and ran in an ABI Prism 3100 sequencer.
Cloning
To quantify the proportion of heteroplasmy in samples
that appeared to be relevant to mutation rate calculation,
a PCR using primers L-MT3120 and H-MT3889 was performed. The PCR products were subsequently cloned into
the pCRÂ®4-TOPOÂ® vector with the TOPO TA CloningÂ® Kit
for Sequencing (Invitrogen) and multiple clones for each
sample were sequenced using the same primers used for
PCR.
Data analysis
Detection of heteroplasmy and Sequence alignment
Sequences were analyzed using the Sequencing Analysis
5.2.0 software (Applied Biosystems), considering a value
of 2% in the option of Mixed Base Identification. Moreover, al the sequences were visually verified and compare
with other from the same run to detect the presence of heteroplasmy. Only sequences with a good intensity and
with background almost imperceptible were used.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/167

Subsequently sequences were aligned in relation to the
revised CRS [43], using BioEdit [53]. All polymorphic
positions were confirmed in sequencing electropherograms. Sequences without ambiguities were obtained
between positions 3230â4331.
Levels of heteroplasmy
Levels of heteroplasmy were determined as described in
Santos et al. [37] using the height of the peaks in the electropherograms and/or the cloning of PCR products.
Population Database and Reference Sequences
To calculate the frequency of each variant for a particular
nucleotide position, we created a population database of
1457 mtDNA coding region sequences [2,28,54-59]. To
infer the ancestral state in a given nucleotide position we
used two sequences: a) the reference sequence proposed
by Ingman et al. [28] â GeneBank accession number
NC_001807 â that originates from an African sequence
(GeneBank accession number AF347015); and b) the Pan
troglodytes mtDNA sequence â GeneBank accession
number X93335 [44].
Mutation Rate Estimation
The mutation rate was derived from the number of
detected mutations per number of "meioses" or transmission events, which is the number of cumulative generations tracing back to the maternal ancestor. When the
mutation rate is expressed as mutations per base pair per
million years (Myr), the generational time was assumed to
be 25 years [37]. The mutation rate (considering substitutions only) was estimated according to different assumptions: 1) all the substitutions that were detected were
considered for the mutation rate calculation, 2) only the
substitutions for which a germinal origin was evidenced
were considered (applied by the majority of authors, such
as [31]), 3) only the substitutions present in women for
whom there was evidence of a germinal origin were considered (this takes into account that the mutations present
in men have the same evolutionary weight of somatic
mutations, since they cannot be transmitted to the next
generation), and 4) only the substitutions with a germinal
origin present in women that would become fixed at the
individual level were considered. To perform these estimations we tried to distinguish if a mutation is neutral or
not. A mutation was considered deleterious if it had been
previously described as correlated with any form of disease. On the other hand, non-neutral mutations may have
functional consequences that may be assessed by analyzing the conservation indices. Neutral mutations would
have a low conservation index, whereas non-neutral (deleterious or adaptive) mutations would have a high conservation index [4]. Conservation Index was estimated as in
Ruiz-Pesini et al. [4], using the same set of species. For
neutral mutations the probability of intra-individual fixa-

tion of the new variant was considered to be equal to its
frequency in the heteroplasmic individual. For non-neutral deleterious mutations the probability of intra-individual fixation was considered to vary between zero and the
frequency in the heteroplasmic individual. The 95% confidence intervals for proportions were computed using the
program OpenStat2 v1.42 [60].
