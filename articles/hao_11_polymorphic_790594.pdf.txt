Abstract
Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) exhibits extensive genetic variation. The
outbreak of a highly pathogenic PRRS in 2006 led us to investigate the extent of PRRSV genetic diversity in China.
To this end, we analyzed the Nsp2 and ORF7 gene sequences of 98 Chinese PRRSV isolates.
Results: Preliminary analysis indicated that highly pathogenic PRRSV strains with a 30-amino acid deletion in the Nsp2
protein are the dominant viruses circulating in China. Further analysis based on ORF7 sequences revealed that all
Chinese isolates were divided into 5 subgroups, and that the highly pathogenic PRRSVs were distantly related to the
MLV or CH-1R vaccine, raising doubts about the efficacy of these vaccines. The ORF7 sequence data also showed no
apparent associations between geographic or temporal origin and heterogeneity of PRRSV in China.
Conclusion: These findings enhance our knowledge of the genetic characteristics of Chinese PRRSV isolates, and
may facilitate the development of effective strategies for monitoring and controlling PRRSV in China.

Background
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)
is a severe disease characterized by reproductive disorders in gilts and sows, especially during late gestation,
and by respiratory distress in pigs. The disease first
emerged in late 1987 in the United States [1] and three
years later in Europe [2]. Porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent
of PRRS, belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order
Nidovirales [3], and is an enveloped virus with a singlestranded positive sense RNA genome containing nine
open reading frames (ORFs) [4]. The ORFs 1a and 1b
encode the non-structural proteins Nsp1a, Nsp1b, and
Nsp2-12, while ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3-7 encode
the structural proteins GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5, M,
and N, respectively [5].
Two genotypes are recognized for PRRSV, the North
American type and the European type, as represented by

the prototypes VR-2332 and Lelystad virus (LV), respectively [6]. Significant genetic differences have been
described both between these two genotypes and within
the same genotype of PRRSV [7-9].
Since the first report of PRRSV in China in 1996 [10],
the North American type PRRSV, with considerable
genetic variation, has spread throughout the country
[11-13]. Since 2006, several highly pathogenic PRRS outbreaks have been reported in China, causing severe economic losses in the swine industry [14-16]. The molecular
characterization of these PRRSVs is thus a major focus of
Chinese virology research [17-19]. However, previous studies have focused mainly on the ORF5 or Nsp2 genes,
while the genetics of the Chinese PRRSVs based on the
ORF7 gene are not well characterized. The ORF7 encodes
the nucleocapsid protein (N), the most abundant viral protein in virus-infected cells [5] and the most immunodominant antigen in the pig immune response to PRRSV [20].
ORF7 is, therefore, a promising candidate for serological
detection and diagnosis [21,22]. Indeed, the N protein has
been extensively used for determining the genetic variation
and the phylogenetic relationships among PRRSVs

[23-25], suggesting a significant role for ORF7 in PRRSV
evolutional surveillance.
In this paper, we sequenced the ORF7 and Nsp2 genes
of seven PRRSV strains isolated during the outbreak of
highly pathogenic PRRS in China. We analyzed the
ORF7-coding region to assess the genetic variation of
PRRSV in China and to better understand the molecular
epidemiology of PRRS.

Results
The genetic diversity of the Nsp2 gene among Chinese
PRRSV isolates

To determine whether the isolates examined in this study
possessed the same characteristic deletions in the Nsp2
gene found in the highly pathogenic PRRSVs previously
described [14,15], the partial Nsp2 sequences of all 7
PRRSV isolates were sequenced and aligned with the 93
isolates in GenBank. The GenBank sequences included
91 Chinese reference isolates, in addition to the North
American prototype VR-2332 and its attenuated vaccine
virus RespPRRS MLV (Table 1). Alignment analysis of
the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that 23 Chinese isolates, including our XJ isolate, contained no deletions or insertions in comparison to VR2332 and
RespPRRS MLV. In contrast, deletions occurred within
the Nsp2 protein in 75 Chinese strains. Of these, 74 were
isolated during the outbreak of highly pathogenic PRRSV
(except for the stain HB-2sh collected in 2002). The HB2sh strain contains a continuous 12 amino acid deletion
at position 470-481, while the other 74 isolates have four
different types of deletions. Sixty-four Chinese reference
isolates and 6 of our isolates (07N, 128, PC, TS, XIN, and
XB) contained a discontinuous deletion of 1 and 29
amino acids at positions 482 and 533-561. In addition,
CG and GDQY2 contained a discontinuous deletion of
36 and 29 amino acids at positions 471-506 and 533-561.
The YN9 strain contained a discontinuous deletion of 25
and 29 amino acids at positions 478-502 and 533-561.
The Em2007 strain had a continuous deletion of 68
amino acids at position 499-566. Therefore, the highly
pathogenic PRRS viruses with a discontinuous 30 amino
acid deletion have been the dominant strains circulating
in China.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the ORF7 sequence

In order to better understand the genetic relationship
and evolution of PRRSVs in China from 1996 to 2010,
phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the
ORF7 gene sequences of our 7 isolates and the 93 reference viruses in GenBank (VR-2332, RespPRRS MLV,
and 91 Chinese reference isolates).
In the phylogenetic tree, all these PRRSV isolates were
divided into 5 subgroups (Figure 1). Subgroup I was comprised of 15 isolates that included VR-2332, RespPRRS

Page 2 of 9

MLV, and 13 Chinese reference isolates. The isolates
within subgroup I showed 92.7-100% identity at the
nucleotide level and 92.7-100% at the amino acid level.
Subgroup II consisted of 6 PRRSV reference isolates,
Em2007, CH-1a, and the 4 CH-1a derivatives (CH2002,
CH2003, CH2004, and CH-1R). In this subgroup, sequence
identities were 94.9-100% at the nucleotide level and 94.3100% at the amino acid level. Subgroup III consisted of
6 PRRSV isolates, including our XJ isolate. The other 5 isolates were BJ0706, HB-1sh, GD3, NB04, and SHB. Within
subgroup III, nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were 95.7-98.4% and 96.7-99.2%, respectively.
Subgroup IV contained 2 of our isolates (128 and
XIN) and 6 highly pathogenic reference viruses
(09HUB7, BJSY07, BJSY-1, CG, HLJHL, and KP). They
shared 98.4-100% nucleotide sequence identity and
99.2-100% amino acid sequence identity. Subgroup V
consisted of 65 isolates, including 4 of our isolates (07N,
PC, TS, and XB) and 61 highly pathogenic reference isolates. Their nucleotide and amino acid sequences were
95.7-100% and 94.3-100% identical. Highly pathogenic
PRRSVs were concentrated in Subgroups IV and V,
except for the strain Em2007, which was located in subgroup II and considered a recombinant between the vaccine strain CH-1R and the highly pathogenic virus [26].
The identities among the 98 Chinese isolates (our
7 isolates and 91 Chinese reference isolates) in all the
5 subgroups ranged from 90.9% to 100% for the nucleotide sequences and from 88.6% to 100% for the
amino acid sequences. All 98 Chinese isolates were of
the North American genotype. These Chinese isolates
demonstrated 91.4-100% nucleotide sequence identity
and 91.1-100% amino acid sequence identity with the
North American prototype VR-2332 and its derived vaccine virus RespPRRS MLV (VR-2332 and RespPRRS
MLV have identical ORF7 sequences). In contrast, the
Chinese isolates had 67.8-71.1% nucleotide sequence
identity and 62.5-65.8% amino acid sequence identity
with the Lelystad virus (the European prototype).
Sequence comparison of ORF7 gene among Chinese
isolates

The ORF7 sequences of the 5 subgroups, including 98
Chinese isolates and the 2 foreign isolates (VR-2332 and
RespPRRS MLV), were further compared and analyzed.
As shown in Figure 2 all of the PRRSV ORF7 sequences
were the same length (372 nt), and encoded 123 amino
acid residues. Many amino acid substitutions were
observed in subgroups II, III, IV, and V when compared
with VR-2332. Some substitutions, such as R11K and
D15N, occurred in subgroups II, III, IV, and V. The
V117A substitution was unique to subgroups III, IV,
and V, while T91A was unique to subgroups III and V.
Interestingly, two substitutions, K46R and H109Q, were

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationship between 98 Chinese isolates, the prototype North American strain VR-2332, and its attenuated
RespPRRS MLV vaccine stain based on the amino acid sequences of the ORF7 gene. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed with
bootstrap values calculated from 1,000 replicates. The five subgroups are marked with different colors and the strains isolated in this study are
indicated by a filled triangle.

exclusive to all isolates in subgroups IV and V, the most
highly pathogenic PRRSVs. In addition, subgroup II
strains had two distinct substitutions from the other
subgroups, Q9R and N49 S, with the exceptions of CH1a (no substitution occurred at amino acid residue 9)
and Em2007 (N49H).
The distribution of sequence diversity across the ORF7
protein was investigated for all 100 sequences analyzed in
this study. These sequences contained 108/372 (29.0%)
polymorphic nucleic acid positions and 36/123 (29.6%)
polymorphic amino acid positions. However, frequent
amino acid alterations were only found in the individual
residues 11, 15, 46, 91, 109, and 117, while conserved
regions were present primarily at positions 16-45, 55-90,
and 92-108 (Figure 3a). Figure 3b shows the amino acid
positions plotted versus the difference between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN-dS).
The overall difference between dN and dS for ORF7 was
negative (-0.03258 ± 0.01219), indicating that ORF7 was
under purifying selection. Most negative values were

located mainly in the middle domain (residues 55-90) of
the protein. However, some residues were under positive
selection, such as the above-mentioned six amino acid
sites 11, 15, 46, 91, 109, and 117.
Hydrophilic analysis was performed using at least three
isolates in each subgroup. Figure 3c shows the ORF7
hydrophilicity plots of isolates VR2332, BJ-4, and HB-2sh
in subgroup I, CH-1a, CH2003, and Em2007 in subgroup
II, BJ0706, HB-1sh, and XJ in subgroup III, CG, 128, and
XIN in subgroup IV, and HUN4, JXA1, and XB in subgroup V. The hydropathy profiles of the PRRSV ORF7 s
indicated that the proteins were highly hydrophilic, especially in the N-terminal domain, with two large hydrophilic regions at positions 5-21 and 30-74. The C-termini
also possessed several small hydrophilic regions at 81-85,
95-99, and 106-112. The differences in hydrophilicity
plots between these isolates were centralized in the segments 7-15, 41-55, 62-73, 85-105, and 113-120, and all
resulted from single amino acid substitutions within
these regions.

Discussion
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) has been one of the most economically damaging pathogens for the swine industry world-wide. Since
it first emerged in 1996, the virus has spread widely

throughout pig-producing provinces of China, imposing
a considerable economic burden on the swine industry,
especially after the outbreak of highly pathogenic PRRS
in 2006 [14,15]. Studies have been performed on genetic
variability of these isolates, revealing extensive sequence

variation among the Chinese PRRSV strains [17,18].
Nevertheless, the molecular characterization of the
ORF7 gene among PRRSVs circulating in China has not
been documented. Here, we determined the partial
Nsp2 sequences and the complete ORF7 sequences of 7
PRRSV strains isolated in different swine herds during
2007-2010 and compared them with the published
sequences of 91 Chinese strains and 2 North American
strains (VR-2332 and its attenuated vaccine virus
RespPRRS MLV).
Pair wise comparisons showed that 6 isolates characterized in this study (07N, 128, PC, TS, XIN, and XB)
and 64 Chinese reference isolates contained a discontinuous deletion of 30 amino acids in the Nsp2 gene. The
deletion is considered a gene marker for highly pathogenic PRRSV; however, it is not related to virulence
[27]. Further analysis of the complete ORF7 sequences
revealed that all the 98 Chinese PRRSV isolates analyzed
exhibited a very high degree of genetic diversity, and
clustered into 5 subgroups, suggesting the coexistence
of related non-identical PRRS viral variants evolving
independently. Subgroup I isolates shared a high identity
with the MLV vaccine and its parent virus VR-2332.
Subgroup II isolates were highly homologous to the
CH-1R vaccine and its parent virus CH-1a. Isolates in
subgroups IV and V were all highly pathogenic PRRSVs,
and distinct from the MLV or CH-1R vaccine. These
highly pathogenic subgroups IV and V PRRSVs are the

dominant strains circulating in China, and so should be
the focus when formulating preventive and control measures against PRRSV.
No apparent relationship between geographic and
genetic distance was found for the isolates based on the
N protein in the study, especially for the highly pathogenic strains, since these atypical viruses existed
throughout the mainland of China. A correlation
between temporal and genetic distance was also not
found, as the highly pathogenic PRRS outbreak occurred
in several pig farms in the summer of 2006 and rapidly
spread to almost all pig-producing provinces of China.
Our data indicate that the disease is still circulating in
China.
The nucleocapsid protein (N) encoded by ORF7 is
highly immunogenic, and several antigenic domains
have been mapped onto N in both the European and
the North American PRRSV. A common linear epitope
conserved among different isolates of European and
North American origin was located in the amino acid
segment 50-66 [28]. Another linear epitope, conserved
in European and North American isolates, was identified
in amino acids 25-30 [29]. Wootton et al. found three
additional linear epitopes (residues 30-52, 37-52, and
69-123) and one discontinuous epitope utilizing residues
52-69 and 112-123 [30]. In addition, four other linear
epitopes at 23-33, 30-48, 30-50, and 43-56 were
observed in VR2332 [31]. For the North American

isolate CH-1a, the first Chinese isolate, epitopes were
reported in amino acid segments 51-58 and 79-87
[32,33].
Extensive substitutions were observed in the 123residue nucleocapsid protein on the basis of the alignment. Substitutions K46R and V117A occurred in all
the highly pathogenic PRRSVs, which might impede the
recognition of the epitopes encompassing or flanking
the two substitutions by anti-N mAbs. A previous study
confirmed that the 11 C-terminal residues 112-123 were
essential for the generation of discontinuous epitopes
[30]. Single amino acid substitutions introduced into the
C-terminal domain show that the requirement of the
C terminus for conformation-dependent mAb binding
correlates with the proper formation of the predicted
beta-strand formed by amino acids 111-117 [34]. Therefore, it is likely that the mutation V117A observed in
highly pathogenic PRRSVs could exert great influence
on the structure and antigenicity of N protein.
The substitution K46R might also alter the function of
the nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif (41-47) and
the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) motif (41-72)
[35]. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations
at 43 and 44 within the NLS attenuated viral replication
[36]. Whether the mutation at amino acid position
46 has the similar or opposite impact on viral pathogenicity remains to be determined.
Two other substitutions, R11K and D15N, occurred in
subgroups II, III, IV, and V, although there are a
large number of Lys (K) and Asn (N) residues in the Nterminal half of the 123-residue nucleocapsid protein. The
accumulation of these residues in the N terminus might
function in the interaction with genomic viral RNA [37].
Some conserved sites were also observed from our
alignment analysis. For example, three cysteine residues
at amino acid positions 23, 75, and 90 were highly conserved in all isolates. Covalent interactions were formed
through disulfide linkages between conserved cysteines
at position 23 in North American strains, while the
domain 30-37, which was also conserved in all isolates
in this study, was shown to be essential for non-covalent
interactions [38]. The C75 S mutant induced cytopathic
effects and produced infectious strains with plaque morphology indistinguishable from the wild type clone. In
contrast, the C23 S and C90 S mutations completely
abolished viral infectivity, indicating that C23 and C90
play critical roles in PRRSV infection [39].
Conserved regions were also found by variability analysis at positions 16-45, 55-90, and 92-108. These highly
conserved amino acid segments are probably associated
with nucleocapsid structure and/or function. Meanwhile,
non-synonymous mutations did not occur more frequently than synonymous mutations among the Chinese
isolates, and the main variable sites and non-synonymous

mutations (residues 11, 15, 46, 91, 109, and 117) were
distributed in the hydrophilic regions prone to immune
pressure.
The N protein contains important immunogenic epitopes, and the majority of antibodies produced during
PRRSV infection are specific for it [20,40]. Thus, the N
protein has been targeted as a suitable candidate for the
detection and diagnosis of PRRS. Numerous serological
diagnostic tests have been developed based on the N
protein [21,22,41-43]. Additionally, PCR is another
widely used method for detecting the viruses, and ORF7
has been regarded as a promising target gene [25,44,45]
due to its sequence stability relative to other structural
genes [46]. However, the high genetic variability among
the ORF7 sequences of the Chinese PRRSV isolates
observed in this study should be taken into consideration when designing serological or molecular detection
methods for PRRSV diagnosis and epidemiological
surveillance.
In conclusion, all the ORF7 sequences of PRRSV isolates from 1996 to 2010 in China belonged to the North
American type. Chinese strains were categorized into
five subgroups. The highly pathogenic PRRSVs have
become the dominant strains in China. Our study provides the first genetic analysis of the Chinese PRRSV N
protein. These results could lead to a better understanding of the molecular variation of PRRSV in China and
to the development of more effective vaccines and reliable diagnostic methods.

Materials and methods
Sample origin

Fresh tissues were sampled during 2007-2010 from different swine herds in Gansu province of northwestern
China. This region experienced outbreaks of severe
reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory
problems in sucking and post-weaning piglets. All samples were stored in ice boxes and transported to the
laboratory immediately. The materials were frozen at
-80°C until analyzed.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from the tissue homogenates
using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Viral cDNA was synthesized using Oligo dT
primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The sense primer for Nsp2
amplification was 5’-AGGAAGGTCAGATCCGATTG-3’
and the reverse primer was 5’-CGTCTGTGAGGACGCAGACA-3’. The cycling conditions were 95°C for
4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72°
C for 10 min. This yielded a 370 bp fragment of the
Nsp2 gene. For ORF7 gene amplification, the sense

Hao et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:73
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/73

primer was 5’-AAGCCTCGTGTTGGGTGGCAG-3’ and
the antisense primer was 5’-TCTCCCAATTCTAACACTGAG-3’. The PCR protocol included 95°C for
4 min and then 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for
30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a final extension at
72°C for 10 min. Amplification yielded the complete
sequence of the ORF7 gene.
Nucleotide sequencing

The PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Axygen, USA) and cloned into the pMD18-T
vector (TaKaRa, China). At least three clones were generated from each cDNA fragment and used for
sequencing.

Data analysis

Sequence analysis of the partial Nsp2 gene and the complete ORF7 gene from all 7 isolates found in this study,
in addition to 93 reference isolates from GenBank
(Table 1), was conducted using the Lasergene sequence
analysis software package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI). The CLUSTAL W program was used for multiple
sequence alignment. The unrooted phylogenetic tree
was generated by the distance-based neighbor-joining
method using MEGA 4.0. Boot-strap values were calculated using 1000 replicates of the alignment. A hydrophilicity profile was generated with the ProtScale web
utility http://expasy.org/tools/protscale.html by the Kyte
and Doolittle method. Furthermore, the amino acid
position was plotted versus the difference between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dNdS). The difference was calculated with the SNAP web
utility http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/content/hiv-db/SNAP/
WEBSNAP/SNAP.html.
