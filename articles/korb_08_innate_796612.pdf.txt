Abstract
Background: As part of a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded
collaborative project, we have performed over 150 microarray experiments measuring the
response of C57/BL6 mouse bone marrow macrophages to toll-like receptor stimuli. These
microarray expression profiles are available freely from our project web site http://
www.innateImmunity-systemsbiology.org. Here, we report the development of a database of
computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites and related genomic features for a set
of over 2000 murine immune genes of interest. Our database, which includes microarray coexpression clusters and a host of web-based query, analysis and visualization facilities, is available
freely via the internet. It provides a broad resource to the research community, and a stepping
stone towards the delineation of the network of transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying
the integrated response of macrophages to pathogens.
Description: We constructed a database indexed on genes and annotations of the immediate
surrounding genomic regions. To facilitate both gene-specific and systems biology oriented
research, our database provides the means to analyze individual genes or an entire genomic locus.
Although our focus to-date has been on mammalian toll-like receptor signaling pathways, our
database structure is not limited to this subject, and is intended to be broadly applicable to
immunology. By focusing on selected immune-active genes, we were able to perform
computationally intensive expression and sequence analyses that would currently be prohibitive if
applied to the entire genome. Using six complementary computational algorithms and
methodologies, we identified transcription factor binding sites based on the Position Weight
Matrices available in TRANSFAC. For one example transcription factor (ATF3) for which
experimental data is available, over 50% of our predicted binding sites coincide with genome-wide

chromatin immnuopreciptation (ChIP-chip) results. Our database can be interrogated via a web
interface. Genomic annotations and binding site predictions can be automatically viewed with a
customized version of the Argo genome browser.
Conclusion: We present the Innate Immune Database (IIDB) as a community resource for
immunologists interested in gene regulatory systems underlying innate responses to pathogens.
The database website can be freely accessed at http://db.systemsbiology.net/IIDB.

Background

Construction and Content

Extensive transcriptional regulation underlies macrophage responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [1].
Differential transcriptional activity in response to TLR signaling tailors macrophage responses to different pathogens [2-8]. See [9] for a review. In spite of recent
achievements [10-12], the cost and difficulty of comprehensive experimental identification of transcription factor
binding sites (e.g. using ChIP-chip technology [13]) continues to be high. Computational methods can aid these
efforts by predicting potential transcription factor-DNA
interactions in response to pathogens. The information
necessary for comprehensive prediction of transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs) on large numbers of genes is
currently dispersed in publications [14-18] and across various databases such as ENSEMBL [19], GenBank [20],
TRANSFAC [21], JASPAR [22], cisRED [23], and EPD [24].

IIDB uses the MYSQL relational database system to store,
retrieve and manage the data. The web interface between
the user and IIDB is coded in PERL/CGI. Initially, the
database was populated with a set of 1670 genes differentially regulated in response to LPS. We subsequently
added a selection of approximately 400 other genes suspected or recognized to be of importance to the innate
immune system. Approved (data curator) users can easily
upload additional genes for analysis by providing the Entrez GeneID via the web interface. The uploading validation and annotation process is shown in Additional File 1.
Uploaded genes are automatically annotated and made
available via the web interface, usually within hours. At
this time, we limit web based user submission to 300 kb,
although longer loci can be handled by special request.

While there are other examples of mouse genome annotation databases and websites [25,26], in this paper, we
present a database that is specifically focused on mouse
innate immunity genes and their predicted regulatory
interactions. The Innate Immune Database (IIDB) contains annotations for over 2000 genes, including over
1600 TLR-responsive genes, and additional genes considered of importance to innate immune responses. We have
annotated these genes with data from over 150 microarray
experiments, the ENSEMBL database, the database
resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), computationally predicted TFBSs, predicted cis- regulatory modules, evolutionary conserved
regulatory sequences, DNase hypersensitive sites, coexpression clusters, and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) data. For each gene, we have
analyzed the sequence from at least 20 kb upstream to at
least 10 kb downstream of the predicted transcription end
site, including all exons and introns. In addition to regulatory predictions, annotations for exon/intron boundaries, CpG islands, repeats, Affymetrix Microarray
Expression probes are included. Users can interactively
interrogate IIDB using a web interface. Search results are
mapped to the genome sequence. Standard text-based
files are created ('.gff2' and '.gff3') and can be explored visually using the web-enabled Argo genome browser [27].

Sequence Coordinates and Gene Mapping
To accommodate the needs of our multiple ongoing
experimental projects and users, IIDB provides annotations based on both the UCSC mouse genome version
mm5 [28] and the ENSEMBL mouse 29e build [19]. The
two gene maps differ in the number of predicted genes
and other details. We built two distinct gene coordinate
maps for IIDB, one based on UCSC data, and the other
based on ENSEMBL. Gene loci are labeled by the gene
name and corresponding Entrez geneID. A chromosome
locus may contain more than one gene. Therefore IIDB
allows multiple labels to be associated with a single locus.
Locus coordinates were used to search the ENSEMBL database for repeats, CpG islands, and Affymetrix Microarray
Expression ProbeSets (from the Mouse Genome 430 2.0
Array).
Predicted Individual Transcription Factor Binding Sites
We annotated the genomic sequence of all the genes in
our database with each of the 360 mouse-specific individual TRANSFAC (Professional edition 8.3, [21]) Position
Weight Matrices (PWM) using the MotifLocator algorithm[29]. Scanning was performed on both the positive
and negative strands. To assess the statistical significance
of MotifLocator scores and to set selection thresholds, we
evaluated MotifLocator scores on 200 kb of shuffled
sequences from upstream regions of approximately 100
immune related genes. The randomization procedure was
repeated six times for a total of 1.2 × 106 random scores
Page 2 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Immunology 2008, 9:7

per matrix. For each PWM, MotifLocator scores for the
true sequence were converted to p-values by comparison
to the score distribution for the same PWM on the randomized sequence. Based on this analysis we generated
matrix scan datasets with p-values less than 1 × 10-3, 5 ×
10-4 and 1 × 10-4.
Summary Presentation of Binding Sites for Similar Factors
Display of all individual putative TFBSs can produce cluttered visualizations. To provide an alternative representation, avoiding presentation of overlapping hits of
identical or similar matrices, we grouped the 360 individual TRANSFAC matrices into 67 matrix families and 76
individual matrices. First, we computationally grouped
TRANSFAC matrices whose identifiers correspond to the
same transcription factor into a single matrix group. For
example, AHR_Q5, AHR_01 both identify the Ahr transcription factor. Next, we computationally combined our
matrix groups with TRANSFAC matrices whose identifiers
indicated that they belong to the same transcription factor
family. For example, matrices for MYC_Q2, EBOX_Q6,
and MYCMAX_02 were combined. Finally, we hand
curated the groups and remaining single matrices to
ensure against computational false positives or false negatives. Any matrices not assigned into a group by the
above procedure were retained as individual matrices.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/7

assigned to each cluster based on the motif scores that
comprise the cluster and the spatial density of motifs. A
"maximum motif overlap" parameter sets up the maximum percentage of overlap for two motifs to be considered individually. A list of cluster scores generated is
compared to a list of cluster scores generated from a background DNA sequence. This comparison is then used to
assign a p-value to each motif cluster according to its significance.
Conserved Human/Mouse/Rat/Dog Promoter Sequences
IIDB includes a catalog of over 26000 conserved human/
rat/mouse and dog promoter sequences identified by Xie
et al. [14]. To map the reported conserved sequences to
the promoter region of the genes in our database, we used
a simple nucleotide search algorithm accepting only exact
matches to the published sequences. Since Xie et al only
investigated human promoters up to 2 Kb upstream of the
transcription start site, we disregarded all mouse sequence
matches located further than 3 kb upstream and 500 bp
downstream of the transcription start site. In addition, we
disregarded matches that were less than 100 nucleotides
in length. The original list of conserved genomic
sequences can be accessed at [31]. As the state of the art
and the data evolve, we anticipate periodic updates to
annotations based on phylogenetic conservation.

To remove redundant predictions, overlapping hits from
the same PWM group were collapsed into a single predictive hit if the two predicted TFBS overlapped by at least
half of the length of the 5' matrix (|startmatrix1 - startmatrix2|
<= lengthmatrix1/2). If the neighboring matrix did not satisfy this condition, it was marked as a distinct TFBS. The
same algorithm was used to combine identical overlapping single matrix hits (see Additional File 2). This methodology significantly reduces the number of predicted
TFBS and avoids visualization clutter. For example, combining individual matrices into matrix families reduced
the number of predicted transcription factor binding sites
from 2500 to 1795 at a p-value < 1 × 10-4 over the 54 Kbp
sequence analyzed for the Interleukin 12b (IL12b) locus.

Mouse Homologs of Human DNase Hypersensitive Sites
DNase hypersensitive (HS) sites can help identify the
location of cis-regulatory regions on DNA [32,33]. We
used the multicross species DNase HS site mapping information as reported by Crawford et al [31] to create the
chromosome coordinates for over 16500 possible mouse
DNase HS sites. Briefly, we used the human DNase coordinate information, flanked by an additional 10 bp 5' and
3', to define a human HS sequence. This sequence was
used as the input to the ENSEMBL Compara36 database
to identify the coordinates of the matching mouse
sequences. Only the top 12 mouse hits per human DNase
HS sequence slice are used to populate our database. The
original map of human DNase HS can be found at [34].

Spatial Clusters of TFBS
Transcription factors often bind in close proximity of each
other within a cis-regulatory module [25,26,30]. We used
the COBALT Clustering algorithm CCA (Battail C, Hwang
D, Rust A, et al, manuscript in preparation) to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of matrix hits (cluster
p-value ≤ 10-2). Briefly, the algorithm detects clusters of
TFBS hits on a DNA regulatory region previously scanned
by a library of matrices (e.g., from TRANSFAC or JASPAR).
A "maximum cluster size" parameter limits the sequence
length over which a cluster can extend. We chose 500 bp
for this parameter based on typical lengths of known cisregulatory modules in animal genes [30]. A score is

ChIP-chip Data
To demonstrate the ease of integrating additional data
into IIDB, we have included data from a genome wide
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, employing a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide array [35]. This array contains densely-tiled 25-mer oligonucleotide sequences
designed to interrogate almost all of the C57/BL6 mouse
macrophage genes in IIDB. The raw data was processed
with quantile normalization [36,37], then filtered with a
sliding window median filter to identify putative binding
sites [37]. IIDB includes both the tiling probe locations on
all genes, and also the locations of statistically significant
binding hits.

Utility and Discussion
User Interface
The user can interactively interrogate annotated genes
using either the UCSC database version mm5 gene map or
the ENSEMBL mouse 29e gene map. All interactions are
via a web interface. Searches can be performed by providing a common name (e.g. IL12b), Entrez geneid (e.g.
16160), Refseq (e.g. NM_008352), or a chromosomal
location (e.g. chr:11 44019798–44073744). See Fig. 1 for
a snapshot of the IIDB entry page. Using a set of check
boxes, users can select single genes or genes co-expressed
under TLR stimulation, and search the gene(s) for putative
binding sites of all factors in TRANSFAC, or the predicted
binding sites of specified transcription factors. Additional
check boxes allow the user to merge TFBS hits into families of binding sites with similar weight matrices; identify
spatially clustered TFBS's, find TFBS hits shared by a group
of genes; and view DNase HS sites, evolutionary conserved regions, and ChIP-chip hits. Additionally, the locations of exons/introns, CpG islands and repeats, and
Affymetrix expression and tiling probes are available for
viewing in the result set.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/7

Users can filter all TFBS predictions at any of three p-values: 1 × 10-3, 5 × 10-4 and 1 × 10-4. The more stringent pvalues greatly reduce the occurrence of background (nonsignificant) matrix hits but may miss some true binding
sites. Taking the IL12b gene as an example, we analyzed 54
kbp of sequence. The above methodology reduced the
number of predicted TFBS from 15810 hits at a p-value
threshold of 10-3 to 1795 at a p-value threshold of 10-4.
We selected 10-4 as the most stringent p-value threshold
because filtering at this level still allows exact matches to
67 out of 80 (84%) of known (TRANSFAC validated)
TFBS's in our data set.
The results of the user's selections are temporarily stored
in '.gff2' and '.gff3' file formats on our server and can be
downloaded, saved to the user's computer and exported
to other applications. Alternatively, the user can click on a
link on the IIDB web page to invoke the Java Web Start
enabled genome browser Argo (version 1.0.21, [27]). This
facility relieves the user from the need to download/install
any software.

BMC Immunology 2008, 9:7

For greater stringency of results, IIDB allows the user to filter transcription factor binding site predictions in several
different ways as listed below:
Single Gene Analysis
All DNA sequences in our database have been annotated
for exon/intron boundaries, repeats, CpG islands and
Affymetrix probes. All sequences were scanned using the
360 TRANSFAC mouse-specific PWMs (Professional edition 8.3, [21]). Each gene in IIDB is marked with a set of
character symbols indicating the availability of different
kinds of data for that gene.

Users can query a gene for some or all information available in IIDB. The strand, sequence length, and exon coordinates are provided. Based on this information, the user
can limit the search region by specifying 5' upstream and
3' downstream regions (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we provide
microarray expression data for genes differentially
expressed in response to TLR stimulation (see Table 1 for
stimulus list).
Search for TFBS
A total of 143 PWMs representing 268 transcription factors as 67 transcription factor families and 76 single-factor
matrices are stored in our database. A user can search for
the binding sites of one or several transcription factor
families at once, and compare TFBS locations across multiple genes (Fig. 3). Because IIDB generates standard .gff
files on-the-fly, the user can select the set of features to
view online or export the data to other genome browsers.
Also an easy to use file upload facility is available for specifying a large number of transcription factors and their
putative target genes in a query. The user is contacted by
email when the analysis is complete.
Search a Set of Genes for Shared TFBS
Members of a regulatory complex will often have tight
spatial constraints on the relative locations of their TFBS.
This expectation can be exploited to impose a stringent
statistical filter on predicted TFBS's. IIDB users can search
a group of potentially co-regulated genes for common
transcription factor binding sites within a given distance
from each other. The user can choose the genes, set the
window size, and specify the length of the regulatory
region to be analyzed.
Find Spatially Clustered TFBS on a Sequence
Mammalian cis-regulatory modules are thought to be typically around 500 bp in length and contain of the order of
a dozen or more TFBSs [18,30,38]. This option (available
as a tick box at the bottom of each search page) lets the
user identify potential cis-regulatory regions on gene
sequences by searching for statistically unlikely spatial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/7

clusters of TFBS's (as compared to TFBS patterns on shuffled sequences) for a range of window sizes.
Select Genes by GO Annotation
The user can select a set of IIDB annotated genes based on
their common GO annotation [39,40]. The resulting set
can then be searched for predicted TFBS or to find a subset
of genes with shared TFBS hits.
Explore ChIP-chip Data
As an example of additional data integration in IIDB, and
to allow evaluation of the accuracy of our TFBS predictions, IIDB includes ChIP-chip data for the ATF3 transcription factor [29]. We plan to include additional ChIPchip data from other transcription factors as they become
available.
Argo Genome Browser Display
All IIDB search results are color coded in the genome
browser view. IIDB maintains a consistent color coding
scheme across all gene displays. Within the Argo genome
browser, additional specific detail about a particular feature can be displayed by double clicking that feature as
shown in Fig. 4 (MS Internet Explorer only). The list of
human transcription factors associated with a particular
evolutionary conserved promoter sequence can be
observed in a new browser window by double clicking the
feature in the genome browser. For the 'Matrix Families'
feature, the matrix hit with the highest score is displayed.
Contributing matrix hits are attributes of the displayed
matrix and can be accessed by double clicking on the displayed matrix hit.
Help
An extensive help menu is available, as indicated by the '?'
symbol next to each link in the navigation bar at the top
of each web page. We also provide step-by-step examples
of how to perform single and multi-gene analyses using
IIDB via on-line help web pages (under the link 'How To
Use IIDB') and through a downloadable tutorial (IIDB
Tutorial link).

Discussion
IIDB is designed to accommodate both experimental data
(microarrays, ChIP-chip) and computationally predicted
TFBS and genomic annotations. So far, we have only been
able to compare the accuracy of our binding site predictions against two datasets. The results are encouraging in
both cases. Firstly, there are 80 known TFBS documented
within TRANSFAC which map to the IIDB genes. Of these,
we capture at least 80%. Second, approximately 50% of
the ATF3 ChIP-chip hits coincide with the IIDB predictions, as summarized in Table 2. Thus, the most stringent
of the IIDB predictions are sufficiently predictive and
small enough in number to allow focused experimental

experimental data will be presented elsewhere.
Unlike other TFBS data and prediction repositories, IIDB
is implemented to be specific in that it includes data relat-

ing to a specific cell type (macrophages) in a specific strain
(C57/BL6) of a specific species (mus musculus). We hope
that this specificity will prove useful for the immunology
community. IIDB is also structured so that the data it con-

Future Directions
We plan to regularly update the transcription factor binding site data and related statistics within IIDB. We are in
the process of building an extended version of IIDB which
will include TRANSFAC matrix scans for the entire mouse

genome. We also plan to add further ChIP-chip data for
various transcription factors we are currently analyzing.
We are committed to regularly updating our gene coordinate system with new mouse genome builds. An emailbased feedback and help link is provided on the IIDB
homepage, and users are encouraged to provide suggestions to continue to refine the utility of IIDB. In this way,

believe IIDB will make a useful contribution to the immunology research community.

Conclusion

Our database currently includes predicted binding sites
on the promoters of over 2000 mouse macrophage and
immune-specific genes. Results from IIDB analyses of new
genes, or new analyses of existing IIDB genes, can be automatically integrated into IIDB following curation. IIDB
will grow with time and usage. We have customized a
web-based genome browser to simultaneously display
multiple genes with multiple annotations and TFBS predictions. Thus, IIDB can be used by researchers without
specific computational expertise to develop novel gene
regulatory hypotheses.

The current consensus view is that transcription factor
binding site prediction based on PWM sequence scans
alone is not sufficiently predictive for most systems biology projects. PWM scans generate very high numbers of
false positives and numerous overlapping hits. We have
used several TFBS prediction algorithms, multi-species
conservation information, data on DNase HS sites, and
searches based on TFBS meta patterns to reduce the
number of hits and increase the predictive power of TFBS
predictions. On the basis of available ChIP-chip data,
TFBS predictions available via IIDB appear to have a good
chance of being confirmed experimentally. We therefore

calculate the ATF3 hits. Overlapping hits were collapsed into one as described in the main text. ChIP fragments in these experiments were
estimated to have an average length of approximately 500 bp to 1 Kbp. To determine the coordinates of a ChIP-chip hit, we estimated the center
of gravity of a bound region using a moving average filter, then set the start/end coordinates to be +/- 300 bp.

Gene uploading and validation process diagram. When a user uploads
genes for annotation via the web interface the requested genes first pass
through an extensive verification process. Only positively identified genes
are transmitted to the annotation pipeline. At end of the process a notification is sent to the user detailing the status of his/her request.

Matrix family mapping schematic. Matrix hits were collapsed into the
same group if the start site of the next hit of the family fell within the first
half of length of the previous hit of the family. Only the highest scoring
matrix of a family was reported. The other matrix hits in the family are
displayed as an attribute of the highest scoring matrix. For matrices without other family members, only the highest scoring matrix was reported if
the start site of the next identical matrix fell within the first half of the
length of the previous matrix. The scores of the other identical matrices are
displayed as an attribute of the highest scoring matrix.
