Abstract
Background: RNA editing is a type of post-transcriptional modification of RNA and belongs to
the class of mechanisms that contribute to the complexity of transcriptomes. C-to-U RNA editing
is commonly observed in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. The in vivo mechanism of recognizing
C-to-U RNA editing sites is still unknown. In recent years, many efforts have been made to
computationally predict C-to-U RNA editing sites in the mitochondria of seed plants, but there is
still no algorithm available for C-to-U RNA editing site prediction in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
Results: In this paper, we extend our algorithm CURE, which can accurately predict the C-to-U
RNA editing sites in mitochondria, to predict C-to-U RNA editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed
plants. The algorithm achieves over 80% sensitivity and over 99% specificity. We implement the
algorithm as an online service called CURE-Chloroplast http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/pure.
Conclusion: CURE-Chloroplast is an online service for predicting the C-to-U RNA editing sites
in the chloroplasts of seed plants. The online service allows the processing of entire chloroplast
genome sequences. Since CURE-Chloroplast performs very well, it could be a helpful tool in the
study of C-to-U RNA editing in the chloroplasts of seed plants.

Background
RNA editing is a kind of RNA processing (like splicing,
5'capping and 3' polyadenylation) that can alter the
genetic information of RNA via insertion, deletion or substitution of single or multiple nucleotides. In plant mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts, several cytidines
can be converted to uridines by a deamination process [13]. Generally, there are about 300 to 500 C-to-U RNA editing sites in the mitochondrial transcriptomes of seed
plants [4-7], but only 30 to 50 can be found in their chloroplasts [8-12]. Most of the known C-to-U RNA editing
instances in plant organelles share a similar property: they
are non-synonymous and alter the encoded protein

sequence to be more conserved across species than the
protein sequence predicted from genomic DNA [13-16].
This effect makes the actual protein sequence different
from the sequence predicted from the genomic DNA.
Thus, knowledge of C-to-U RNA editing in plant
organelles is important in order to correctly analyze the
protein sequence and gene expression in both computational and experimental studies.
Biologically, the in vivo site recognition mechanism of Cto-U RNA editing in plant organelles is still not fully
understood [17]. While several short sequences in the
upstream regions of the editing sites have been identified

as being critical for site recognition [18-22], little is
known about the factors that recognize these sites. Recent
studies have suggested that the PPR family of proteins is
related to site recognition [23-26]. It seems that every single site or every small set of editing sites are recognized by
a specific factor [27,28]. With the above biological knowledge as a basis, machine learning algorithms were introduced to predict C-to-U RNA editing sites in
mitochondria. Cummings and Myers proposed the first
prediction algorithm for C-to-U RNA editing sites in mitochondria based on the classification tree algorithm [29],
REGAL introduced the genetic algorithm [30,31] and
Prep-Mt [32] and our CURE (Cytidine-to-Uridine Recognizing Editor) algorithm [33] considered the evolutionary
information. Yura et al. proposed a method (RNAE) for
predicting the C-to-U RNA editing sites in the chloroplasts
of one particular moss organism, Takakia lepidozioides
[34]. However, the application of RNAE on the seed plant
chloroplast genes results in very poor accuracy (Additional file 1). In other words, RNAE is designed for only
one moss organism but cannot be used as a predictor for
seed plant organisms.
Although the chloroplast C-to-U RNA editing sites of rice
[35], maize [8], tobacco [10], sugarcane [36], peas [37],
orchids [38] and several other seed plants have been systematically determined through experiments, there is still
no available software for predicting the chloroplast C-toU RNA editing sites in seed plants. This may be due to the
relatively small number of editing instances in the chloroplast transcriptomes of these organisms, which makes
algorithm design and evaluation very difficult.
However, in the public sequence database, there are many
chloroplast transcripts with undetermined RNA editing
status. An accurate computational prediction method
would be helpful in filling the gap between the sequence
data and the RNA editing annotations. It would also
reduce the need for experimental determinations, which
are costly and time consuming. In this paper, we will
extend our algorithm CURE, which can accurately predict
C-to-U RNA editing sites in mitochondria, to predict C-toU RNA editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed plants. We
will also present the online prediction service, CUREChloroplast.

Implementation
Dataset
There are three main RNA editing databases: dbRES [39],
REDIdb [40] and EdRNA [41]. REDIdb is the only database focusing on organelle RNA editing sites. We collected
all the C-to-U RNA editing sites of seed plant chloroplasts
in REDIdb. The duplicate annotations in the database
were discarded. The inaccurate annotations, which were
associated with nucleotides other than cytidine, were cor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/135

rected according to the original literatures or the GenBank
annotations. The editing sites in pea [37], sugarcane [36]
and orchid [38] chloroplasts were extracted from the literatures and added into the dataset. The sequences in this
dataset were categorized by the gene name. ClustalW was
used to create alignments for each gene. These alignments
were used to train CURE-Chloroplast. Table 1 shows the
summary of our dataset.
This dataset has significant lineage bias. Most of the editing sites are from angiosperms. Only one gymnosperm
plant is included. Since several editing sites in the chloroplasts of the gymnosperm are not conserved in
angiosperms [9], we need to develop different strategies to
predict the C-to-U RNA editing sites in angiosperms and
gymnosperms.
The basic CURE-Chloroplast algorithm
The basic algorithm for CURE-Chloroplast is the same as
the CURE algorithm, which we have already successfully
developed to predict mitochondria C-to-U RNA editing
sites [33]. The CURE algorithm was based on the fact that
if one editing site can be found in a column of a multiple
sequence alignment of homologous genes from different
organisms, it is likely to find another in the same column.
In the CURE algorithm, we proposed the concept of Evolutionary Potential Editing Sites (EPESs). In a multiple
sequence alignment, if a column contains an editing site,
this column is defined as an EPES. An EPES is described
with three different elements: a flanking consensus
sequence, a conservative ratio and a set of sequences that
generate the flanking consensus sequence. The training
procedure scans the alignments to collect the EPESs and
save them in a database. When the editing sites of a
sequence need to be predicted, the prediction procedure

uses the BLAST program to map the EPES consensus
sequences in the database to this sequence and determines the editing status of every cytidine. The details of
the basic CURE algorithm can be found either in our previous work [33] or in additional file 2 of the current paper.

The alignments for training can be prepared by two different methods. One is to create alignments from the CDS
sequences of each gene with the ClustalW program; the
other is to create alignments directly from the whole
genome sequences using the TBA program [42]. Since
most of the RNA editing sites in chloroplasts are found
within the coding regions, we only use the former method
to prepare the alignments. However, CURE-Chloroplast
users are still allowed to enter nucleotide sequences without any restrictions – even the entire chloroplast genome
sequence can be directly entered. In this situation, only
those RNA editing sites in gene regions can be identified
because our training dataset contains no information
from the non-coding regions.
CURE-Chloroplast algorithm extended for gymnosperms
As we have mentioned in the dataset section, several editing sites in gymnosperms are not conserved to the
angiosperms. Thus, we need to modify the CURE algorithm to make it applicable to gymnosperms. An extended
definition of an EPES was proposed. If a column in the
multiple sequence alignments contains only T, and this
column is at the middle position of a codon, this column
is also defined as an EPES. This extended EPES definition
is based on the fact that the protein translated from the
edited version of the transcript is usually more conserved
across species than the sequence predicted from the
genomic DNA. Thus, if a cytidine is mapped by this
extended EPES, it is likely to be edited to restore the conservation at the protein level.
Evaluation
Six summary statistics were used to describe the performance of CURE-Chloroplast: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), balanced accuracy
(BA) and the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC)
(Eq. 1~Eq. 6).

TP, TN, FP and FN are the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.
Online Service
CURE-Chloroplast was implemented on a Linux server
with two Xeon dual-core CPUs and 4 GB of memory.
Users can either paste a single sequence or upload a FASTA
file containing multiple sequences via the web-based user
interface. The server-side PHP scripts process the
sequences and carry out the prediction. The results are presented in a web-based result browser. The plain text-based
result file can be downloaded within 24 hours after the
prediction is made.

CURE-Chloroplast users are allowed to adjust several
parameters after the advanced mode is enabled. The "Up
Bound" and "Low Bound" parameters define the working
region of a K-NN classifier, which is called a "micro-analyzer" in the CURE-Chloroplast system. When the submitted sequence is mapped by an EPES with an RNA editing
conservative ratio between the Low Bound and Up
Bound, the K-NN classifier will be used to decide whether
or not the EPES mapping cytidine should be predicted as
an editing site. If the users enlarge the working region
bounded by these two parameters, the editing statuses of
more cytidines are determined by the K-NN classifier
rather than the RNA editing conservative ratio. According
to our experience, the default parameters are suitable for
most organisms.
The CURE-Chloroplast service has two more options than
the CURE service. One is the "Cons-T EPES" option. If this
option is turned on, the extended EPES definition will be
used. The other is the "Positive strand only" option. If this
option is turned on, CURE-Chloroplast will only scan the
positive strand of the input sequence.

Prediction performance analysis
We used leave-one-species-out cross-validation to estimate the performance of CURE-Chloroplast. When we
were testing the performance on one organism, all the
data relating to that organism, including sequences and
editing sites, were removed from the training set. The
algorithm was retrained on the remaining data. The
details of CURE-Chloroplast performance can be found in
Table 2. Overall, CURE-Chloroplast achieved over 80%

sensitivity and over 99% specificity. Although the negatives were much more than the positives in the dataset, we
found that the sensitivity was still acceptable for most species. CURE-Chloroplast can identify the tiny number of
positives among the extremely large number of negatives.
Because the dataset was significantly unbalanced, we provided the PPV and MCC values as measures of performance on the unbalanced dataset. Since a similar
performance estimation problem in Prep-Mt was solved
by introducing balanced accuracy statistics [32], we also
provided the balanced accuracy values. The balanced
accuracy can be considered as the estimation of accuracy
on a balanced dataset.

To further eliminate the concerns of over-fitting algorithm, we carried out an independent data test. We randomly selected 10%, 20% and 30% of the dataset as the
test samples. The remaining data were used as the training
set. The performance estimated with this independent test
was similar to the leave-one-species-out cross-validation
performance (Table 4), indicating the performance of the
algorithm was not over-estimated.
It should be noted that the RNA editing sites of the chloroplast genes of two parasitic flowering plants, Cuscuta
reflexa and Cuscuta gronovii, were recently determined
[43]. These data were not deposited in the public databases and were not considered when we were developing
CURE-Chloroplast. CURE-Chloroplast identified all 15
known editing sites with only two false positives in Cuscuta reflexa and three of the four known editing sites with
only three false positives in Cuscuta gronovii. The overall
performance in this full-blind validation achieved 94.7%
sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 78.3% PPV and 99.7% accuracy.

The extended EPES definition was applied for gymnosperm plants. With the extended EPES definition, the sensitivity on Pinus thunbergii was more than twice that of the
original definition, the PPV only decreased by about 20%.
The extended EPES definition successfully improved the
performance on gymnosperms. All the following tests on
gymnosperms were carried out using the extended EPES
definition.

The parameters of CURE-Chloroplast can be adjusted in
the same manner as for CURE [33]. We set the default
parameters of CURE-Chloroplast to the same values as
CURE. These parameters worked well enough throughout
our tests. In addition, we calculated the performance of
CURE-Chloroplast on Arabidopsis thaliana with different
parameters and illustrated an ROC-like curve (Additional
file 3) that describes the performance under different
parameter conditions.

The pioneer research on predicting the C-to-U RNA editing sites in mitochondria was carried out on the balanced
dataset [29]. We also built a similar balanced dataset to
test the performance of our algorithm. We randomly
selected a set of negatives with an equal number of positives. This set of negatives and all the positives composed
the balanced dataset. The performance on this balanced
dataset was almost unchanged (Table 3). The accuracy of
this balanced dataset was found to be similar to the balanced accuracy of an unbalanced dataset, indicating the
accuracy of a balanced dataset can be estimated by the balanced accuracy of an unbalanced dataset.

sequence. Four organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana,
Nicotiana tabacum, Zea mays and Pinus thunbergii, were
chosen to test the performance of CURE-Chloroplast
under this condition. These organisms were chosen
because they are representative of their lineages. When an
organism was used as the testing sample, all the information relating to this organism was removed from the training set. The entire chloroplast genome sequence of that
organism was used as the testing sequence. The results are
shown in Table 5. The overall sensitivity is still over 70%
under this condition. The PPV decreased because it is difficult to prevent the increment of the number of false positives when the number of negatives for testing is over
100,000 and the number of positives for testing is only
about 100. The performance under this condition can be
considered as a good estimation of the performance that
a real user may experience, as this test condition simulates
the practical application of CURE-Chloroplast.
Cross-prediction between CURE and CURE-Chloroplast
The in vivo site recognition mechanism of the C-to-U RNA
editing sites is still not understood. One hypothesis is that
every single editing site or small set of editing sites is recognized by a particular factor [22,28]. The sequence patterns of the chloroplast C-to-U RNA editing sites are not
expected to be shared with the mitochondria editing sites.

Thus, the model trained from mitochondria and chloroplasts should not work for each other. Since we have
developed CURE for predicting mitochondrial editing
sites and CURE-Chloroplast for predicting chloroplast
editing sites, we can see what will happen if we use the
model trained on mitochondria and chloroplasts to predict the editing sites of each other.
We took Arabidopsis thaliana as an example. We use CURE
to predict the editing sites on all edited genes in the chloroplasts and CURE-Chloroplast to predict the editing sites
on all edited genes in the mitochondria. Both tests
returned nothing. The model trained on chloroplasts and
mitochondria cannot be used to predict the editing sites of
each other. These results agree with the one-site-one-factor hypothesis.
Can CURE-Chloroplast work on non-seed plants?
C-to-U RNA editing prediction in non-seed plants is a special problem for chloroplasts. All prediction algorithms
for plant mitochondria were developed and tested with
the editing sites of seed plants. Although C-to-U RNA editing sites exist in the mitochondria of non-seed plants, no
computational prediction algorithm takes them into consideration.

The situation of chloroplast C-to-U RNA editing is a bit
different. There are over 300 editing sites in the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris [44] and over 500 editing sites in the
hornwort Anthoceros formosae [45]. The editing patterns of
these two organisms are significantly different from each
other and significantly different from those of seed plants.
Most of the C-to-U RNA editing sites in these two species
are not conserved in seed plants [44]. With the extended
EPES definition, CURE-Chloroplast can achieve sensitivity 39% for Adiantum capillus-veneris and 51% for
Anthoceros formosae, specificity 88% for Adiantum capillusveneris and 86% for Anthoceros formosae, PPV 6% for Adi-

It has been suggested that the editing sites in these organisms and the seed plants are of monophyletic origin [46].
Thus, the CURE-Chloroplast algorithm should work well
on these organisms. However, there are other reasons preventing CURE-Chloroplast from working well on these
organisms. Technically, CURE-Chloroplast relies on accurate sequence alignment while mapping the EPESs on the
target sequence. The sequence divergence between the
homologous genes of these organisms and the seed plants
makes it very difficult to map the EPES trained from the
seed plants to the sequence of these two far related organisms.
Another more telling explanation for the low performance
of CURE-Chloroplast with regard to these two organisms
is the phylogenetically skewed knowledge of C-to-U RNA
editing in chloroplasts. The performance of a lineage is
associated with the abundance of data, and especially the
number of organisms in that lineage with systematically
determined editing sites (Figure 1). The performance for
angiosperms is better than that for gymnosperms, as
angiosperm data is much more comprehensive for more

organisms. Although the performance for gymnosperms
is also very good, it is not as good as that for angiosperms,
as the data for gymnosperms is not as abundant as the
data for angiosperms. Because these two organisms (Adiantum capillus-veneris and Anthoceros formosae) are the only
organism with comprehensive C-to-U RNA editing information in the corresponding lineage, the low performance is expected. When the editing sites of more
organisms in these lineages are determined, the performance of CURE-Chloroplast is expected to improve. However, we have to emphasize that CURE-Chloroplast is
currently only developed for seed plants.

Conclusion
CURE-Chloroplast predicts C-to-U RNA editing sites in
the chloroplasts of seed plants with quite well performance. The predictive result is expected to improve as more
data becomes available. The online service allows the
processing of the entire chloroplast genome sequence.
Although the predictive ability of CURE-Chloroplast is
currently restricted within the seed plant lineage, CUREChloroplast is still a useful tool for studying C-to-U RNA
editing in chloroplasts.

Phylogenetically skewed knowledge of chloroplast Cto-U RNA editing sites. Current knowledge of chloroplast
C-to-U RNA editing sites is phylogenetically skewed. The
performance of CURE-Chloroplast on different lineages of
seed plants is associated with the abundance of data relating
to that lineage. The column "# organisms" refers to the
number of organisms in the corresponding lineage. The column "# genes" refers to the total number of edited genes.
