Abstract
Background: Epidemiological studies worldwide have shown that A. fumigatus exhibits important phenotypic and
genotypic diversity, and these findings have been of great importance in improving the diagnosis and treatment
of diseases caused by this fungus. However, few studies have been carried out related to the epidemiology of this
fungus in Latin America. This study´s aim is to report on the epidemiology of the fungus by analyzing the
phenotypic variability of Aspergillus section Fumigati isolates from different Latin American countries and the
relationship between this variability, the geographical origin and genotypic characteristics.
Methods: We analyzed the phenotypic characteristics (macro- and micromorphology, conidial size, vesicles size,
antifungal susceptibility and thermotolerance at 28, 37 and 48°C) of A. section Fumigati isolates from Mexico (MX),
Argentina (AR), Peru (PE) and France (FR). The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s
multiple comparison test to detect significant differences. Two dendrograms among isolates were obtained with
UPGMA using the Euclidean distance index. One was drawn for phenotypic data, and the other for phenotypic and
genotypic data. A PCoA was done for shown isolates in a space of reduced dimensionality. In order to determine
the degree of association between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics AFLP, we calculated the
correlation between parwise Euclidean distance matrices of both data sets with the nonparametric Mantel test.
Results: No variability was found in the macromorphology of the studied isolates; however, the micromorphology
and growth rate showed that the PE isolates grew at a faster rate and exhibited the widest vesicles in comparison
to the isolates from MX, AR and FR. The dendrogram constructed with phenotypic data showed three distinct
groups. The group I and II were formed with isolates from PE and FR, respectively, while group III was formed with
isolates from MX and AR. The dendrogram with phenotypic and genotypic data showed the same cluster, except
for an isolate from FR that formed a separate cluster. This cluster was confirmed using PCoA. The correlation
between the phenotypic and genotypic data of the isolates revealed a statistically significant association between
these characteristics.
Conclusions: The PE isolates showed specific phenotypic characteristics that clearly differentiate them from the
rest of the isolates, which matches the genotypic data. The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic
characteristics showed a statistically significant association. In conclusion, phenotypic and genotypic methods
together increase the power of correlation between isolates.

Background
Aspergillus fumigatus Fresenius is a filamentous, saprophytic fungus of great biological importance, as it is one
of the major opportunistic pathogens causing invasive
aspergillosis (IA) in immunosuppressed patients [1,2].
Its association with this type of patients depends on the
host characteristics and on some typical phenotypic features that contribute to its pathogenicity such as its
nutritional versatility, growth rate and efficient sporulation at a temperature of 37°C or higher [3,4].
Aspergillus section Fumigati has recently been reclassified by Samson et al. [5]. It currently contains 25 different species, with 8 anamorphs and 17 telemorphs. In
the section Fumigati, besides A. fumigatus, other species, such as Neorsartorya fischeri, N. pseudofischeri, N.
hiratsukae, and A. lentulus, have been reported to be
human pathogens [6-8].
There are few studies available on the phenotypic
characterization of A. fumigatus. The most relevant have
reported variability in the pigment and texture of the
colonies, growth rate at different temperatures, size and
shape of the conidia, atypical phialides and differences
in the size and shape of the conidial heads [9-13].
Other studies have explored the utility of phenotypic
attributes (serological, immunochemical analysis of isozymes and protein profile) and genotypic characteristics
(RFLP [Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism],
RAPD [Random Amplification Polymorphic DNA]-PCR
and partial sequences of DNA) of A. fumigatus isolates
for classification [10,11,14-19]. Some studies have also
tried to find correlations between the phenotypic and
genotypic characteristics, but these studies have so far
shown no strict correlation between the compared attributes [11,12]. However, it is very important to consider
certain phenotypic characteristics, as they are useful
from an epidemiological point of view and can exhibit
differences both within the same species and between
different species. In patients with different clinical forms
of aspergillosis, the A. fumigatus species has shown differences in its phenotypic characteristics. Depending on
the clinical form and the duration of the illness, these
morphological changes appear to be the result of selective pressure that is exerted by the microenvironment to
which each organism is exposed to [10]. Differences in
the phenotypic characteristics have also helped to identify new species, as in the case of A. lentulus, which
showed differences in the rate of sporulation and conidial head size and low antifungal susceptibility [7].
Furthermore, Mesa-Arango et al. [20] observed morphological differences in isolates of Sporothrix schenckii that
correlated with the geographic region and a special clinical form. Given these findings, in this study the phenotypic variation was analyzed in isolates of A. section

Fumigati from Mexico (MX), Argentina (AR), Peru (PE)
and France (FR) to find associations between the phenotypic characteristics (the micro- and macromorphology,
size of conidia, size vesicles, thermotolerance and susceptibility to antifungal) and the geographic origin of
these isolates, as well as to determine the correlation
between these traits and previously reported genotypes
that were generated by AFLP (Amplified Fragment
Length Polymorphism) [21].

Methods
Fungal isolates

Fifty-five isolates of A. section Fumigati were used from
different sources and geographical origins. The A. section Fumigati isolates studied were from patients with
IA and aspergilloma from AR (n = 24), MX (n = 13), FR
(n = 9), and PE (n = 4); environmental isolates were
from AR (n = 3) and MX (n = 2). Data for each isolate
are shown in Table 1. The fungal isolates were grown
on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Bioxon®, Mexico City,
MX) at 37°C. The fungal isolates were identified according to the following criteria: development of the conventional colonial morphology, the presence of typical
microscopic conidia, and their ability to grow at 48°C.
Monospore cultures

From each isolate grown on PDA (Bioxon®) for 2-4 d at
37°C, a conidial suspension was prepared with 1 mL of
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST).
This suspension was diluted (1:1000) and 50 μL was
used for growth on PDA medium (Bioxon®). The Petri
dishes were incubated at 37°C and observed for colonial
growth. Only one colony was selected from each plate,
and grown in PDA (Bioxon®) agar slants at 37°C. The
conidia of the monospores were conserved in sterile
water at 4°C.
Macromorphology

The isolates of A. section Fumigati grown on PDA
(Bioxon®) at 37°C for 4 d were observed to identify the
morphological characteristics of each culture (the color
and texture of the colony).
Micromorphology

The micromorphological characteristics of the isolates of
A. section Fumigati were analyzed using the microculture method of Ridell [22]. The microculture was incubated at 37°C for 4 d or until the fungus was observed
to grow. Subsequently, the cover slip was carefully separated from the agar, placed on a slide with a drop of
cotton blue stain and observed under the microscope.
We analyzed the morphological characteristics of the
conidia and the size of the vesicles. The width of 10

vesicles was measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer (Olympus America Inc., Melvilla, NY, USA).
Thermotolerance

Thermotolerance was measured as described by MesaArango et al. [20]. A suspension of 5 × 103 conidia/mL
was prepared with PBST using a Neubauer chamber and
inoculated it in triplicate for each temperature (28, 37
and 48°C) considering the growth of each isolate on
PDA (Bioxon ®) for 4 d at 37°C. We later determined
the growth rate of the isolates at each temperature
using the following formula: [(colony diameter - inoculum diameter)/days of incubation]. We also calculated
the percentage of growth inhibition (%GI) at 28 and 48°
C using the following formula: [(colony diameter at 37°
C - colony diameter at 28 or 48°C)/colony diameter at
37°C] X 100. To identify heat-sensitive or heat-resistant
isolates of A. section Fumigati, we obtained the average
%GI at 28 and 48°C by considering all 55 isolates. All
isolates that showed a %GI higher than average were
considered heat-sensitive, while those with a smaller
value of %GI, less than the average, were classified as
heat-resistant.

USA) using CO2. The samples were mounted on aluminium cylinders with silver paste and placed in a high
vacuum evaporator for gold coating for 6 min in a
metal ionizing JEOL JFC-1100 (Fine Coat® ion Sputter,
JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, JP). The samples were analyzed with a
Zeiss DSM-950 scanning electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, DE) at 25 kV and a 10 mm working
distance.
Antifungal susceptibility

The diameter of 30 conidia for each A. section Fumigati
isolate grown on PDA (Bioxon®) and incubated at 37°C
for 4 d, was measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer (Olympus America Inc.).

The monospore cultures were tested for antifungal susceptibility according to the guidelines in the M38-A2
document of the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) [25]. For this test, we used amphotericin
B (AMB) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis Mo, USA),
itraconazole (ITZ) (Janssen Pharmaceutical S.A., Buenos
Aires, AR) and voriconazole (VCZ) (Pfizer S.A., Buenos
Aires, AR) as standard powders of known potency. The
stock solutions of each antifungal agent were prepared
with dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and diluted with RPMI
1640. Concentration used ranged from 0.0313 to 16 mg
/L for the three antifungals. The drug dilutions were
placed on 96-well microdilution plates (Nunclon
167008, Nunc, Naperville, IL, USA). The microplates
were incubated without agitation at 35°C for 46-50 h.
Although there are no defined cutoff values for these
antifungal agents, we considered a minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) value ≥ 4 mg/L as indicating resistance to the drug.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

Data analysis

Samples obtained from microcultures of fungal isolates
selected from each country were processed using a modification of the standard procedures for SEM examination [23,24]. Specimens were fixed on a mixture of 4%
paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in sodium
cacodylate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.2) for 5 h at 4°C. After
three washes of 10 min each with the same cacodylate
buffer, the microcultures were postfixed with osmium
tetroxide at 1% for 2 h. We proceeded to manually cut
the excess agar from both the base and the ends of the
samples. The specimens were washed as mentioned and
were then dehydrated with increasingly graded ethanol,
from 30% to absolute ethanol, at room temperature.
Soon after, the samples were dried by the critical point
method in a Samdri 780A desiccator (Rockville, MD,

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) (a = 0.01 and 0.05)
and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were used to
detect significant differences in the conidia size and
growth rate at different temperatures. The analyses were
performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) version 12.0 [26].
The thermotolerance results were tested at three temperatures: 28, 37 and 48°C and based on the rate of
growth of the colonies (1-7 cm diameter), six categories
for each temperature were defined as follows: I (1.0-2.0
cm), II (2.1-3.0 cm), III (3.1-4.0 cm), IV (4.1-5.0 cm) V
(5.1-6.0 cm) and VI (6.1-7.0 cm). These categories were
coded as multistate character without logical sequence,
and together with characters of the conidia and vesicles
size were integrated in a single matrix. Pairwise

distances among isolates were estimated with Euclidean
distance index [27] and a dendrogram was constructed
by the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Averages (UPGMA). However, to obtain a best relationship among isolates, we also integrated in a single
matrix the phenotypic data obtained in this study and
genotypic data (AFLP) reported by Duarte-Escalante et
al. [21] of the same isolates (data not shown). A dendrogram of this data set was constructed by UPGMA. The
reliability of both dendrograms was evaluated by means
of the cophenetic correlation coefficient using the Mantel test [28] after 10,000 permutations and bootstrap. In
addition, we carried out a Principal Coordinate Analysis
(PCoA) with pairwise Euclidean distances of isolates
derived of phenotypic-genotypic data matrix. This
method facilitates the detection of associations more
complex among isolates in a multidimensional scenario.
Finally, a correlation between pairwise Euclidean distance matrices of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics was estimated with Mantel´s non-parametric test
[28] after 10,000 permutations. All these analyses were
carried out with NTSYS-PC v 2.0 [29].

there were differences in thermotolerance. At 28°C, the
thermosensitive isolates were those with a %GI ≥ 36,
where the heat-resistant isolates had a value of < 36. At
48°C, the thermosensitive isolates were defined as having
a %GI ≥ 14, and the heat-resistant isolates had values of
< 14. At 28°C, 100% of the isolates from PE were heatresistant, while only 52%, 33% and 7% of the isolates
from AR, FR and MX, respectively, were heat-resistant.
At 48°C, all of the isolates from PE were also heat-resistant, and 70, 60 and 67% of the isolates from AR, MX
and FR, respectively, were also heat-resistant at this
temperature (Table 1).
Conidia size

The diameters of the conidia of all isolates ranged from
2.56 to 2.89 μm. The conidia of the isolates from AR
were the largest (2.72 ± 0.62), followed by those from
PE (2.62 ± 0.40), MX (2.61 ± 0.35) and FR (2.58 ± 0.22).
The average diameter of the conidia for the isolates
from AR and FR were significantly different (P < 0.05)
(Table 2).

Macromorphology

All isolates had the typical macromorphology of the species. The color of the front was teal with a white border,
and the back was cream-colored. The texture of the
colonies was velvety or powdery.
Micromorphology

Micromorphology showed different sizes (widths) of
vesicles. The PE isolates showed the widest vesicles
(23.35 ± 0.75 μm), followed by FR (20.73 ± 0.83 μm),
MX (17.97 ± 0.84 μm) and AR (17.62 ± 0.78 μm). However, these sizes are within the range that is described
for A. fumigatus.

Scanning electron microscopy

SEM analysis confirmed the statistically significant differences that were observed in the photon microscopy analysis on the size of the conidia and the vesicles of the A.
section Fumigati isolates selected from each country (Figure 1). The conidia of the isolates from AR were the largest, followed by those from PE, MX and FR. In
reference to the size of the vesicles of the isolates selected
from each country, we observed that the PE isolates had
widest vesicles, followed by FR, MX and AR. Similarly,
there was greater sporulation in PE isolates proven by the
presence of conidial heads while isolates from MX, AR
and FR had less conidial heads (Figure 1c).

Thermotolerance

All of the isolates grew at the three tested temperatures,
with 37°C being the optimal temperature for growth
(Table 1). However, statistically significant differences
were found (P < 0.05) in the growth rates of the isolates at

Antifungal Susceptibility

With regard to antifungal susceptibility drugs, the range of
the MICs for VCZ for all isolates was 0.06 to 0.5 mg/L, for
ITZ 0.03 to ≥ 16 mg/L and for AMB 0.25 to 2.0 mg/L.

SEM. Abbreviations: AR-Argentina; MX-Mexico; FR- France and PEPeru.

The antifungal susceptibility results varied (Table 1), and
there were no isolates that were resistant to AMB and
VCZ only to ITZ. The AR isolates (9272, 8571, 6578) were
resistant to ITZ. Isolates from MX, FR and PE showed no
resistance to antifungal drugs (Table 1).

Fumigati isolates from MX, AR, FR and PE. The number on the

replicas.

Data Analysis

The dendrogram obtained with phenotypic data of the
A. section Fumigati isolates, yielded three clusters (Figure 2). The first cluster (group I) included all the isolates from PE with a high association between them and
a bootstrap of 74%. The second cluster (group II) consisted of isolates from FR, whose bootstrap was of 67%.
Group III consisted of isolates from MX and AR with
major distances and a bootstrap of 58%.
The dendrogram generated with the similarity
matrices of pheno and genotypic data of the A. section
Fumigati isolates yielded three clusters (Figure 3). The
first cluster (group I) consisted only one isolate from FR
relatedness with the group II. The second cluster (group
II) showed two subgroups. Subgroup IIa included all isolates from PE, and subgroup IIb included isolates from
FR. Finally, the third cluster (group III) also contained
two subgroups well differenced. Subgroup IIIa consisted
of isolates from MX and AR. Subgroup IIIb consisted of
isolates from MX and AR. Bootstrap values for into this
groups were low but among them were above from 50%.
These results are reinforced by the PCoA (Figure 4)
that shows three groups that depended almost on the
geographical origins of the isolates (MX, AR, FR and
PE). The first three principal coordenates of the analysis
explained 51.65% of the observed variation, specifically

and PE. The number on the nodes represents the support values
based on 10,000 bootstrap replicas.

the first component explained 28.66% of variation, the
second component 15.50%, and the third component
6.49%. These findings largely correspond to the clustering obtained by UPGMA (Figure 3).
When we correlated the pairwise Euclidean distance
matrices of the phenotypic characteristics (size of the
conidia, size of the vesicles and thermotolerance) with
the genotypic characteristics (AFLP) of the studied A.
section Fumigati isolates, a statistically significant relationship (r = 0.105, p = 0.038) was found, showing there
is an association between the two types of characteristics.

Discussion
The A. fumigatus fungus is widely distributed around
the world. In Latin American countries, not much
research has been done to establish their phenotypic
and genotypic variability. To provide more information
regarding this fungus, we studied the phenotypic characteristics (the micro- and macromorphology, size of the
conidia, vesicles size, thermotolerance and antifungal
susceptibility) of clinical and environmental isolates of
A. fumigatus from MX, AR, PE and FR, and we assessed
the relationship between the phenotypic and the genotypic characteristics reported in the literature for these
isolates [21], to determine whether the variability of the
phenotypic characteristics correlated with the genotypic
characteristics. The phenotypic characterization was not
different from that reported for the specie; however,
some interesting observations are worth highlighting
concerning the size of the vesicles, thermotolerance and
growth rate at different temperatures (28, 37 and 48°C).
The PE and AR isolates were characterized by exhibiting
larger conidia (Figure 1), although the size range found
matches that reported by Rinyu et al. [11], who

Page 7 of 9

determined that the size of the conidia of clinical and
environmental A. fumigatus isolates from different countries was 2.5-3.5 μm. The sizes of the vesicles varied
according to their geographic origin, and the PE isolates
had the widest vesicles (Figure 1). Another interesting
phenotypic characteristic was the thermotolerance at 28,
37 and 48°C, where all isolates grew at the three temperatures; however, the PE isolates had the highest
growth rate at 48°C (Table 2). The thermotolerance and
growth rate have been determined to be virulence factors [3,4,30], and it is therefore possible that the isolates
from PE, due to their phenotypic characteristics, are
more virulent than are those from AR, MX and FR. In
other fungi, it has also been observed that the virulent
strains have specific phenotypic characteristics that differentiate them from those that are less virulent. In H.
capsulatum, the dimorphic transition rate at 37°C was
found to be a key factor in the pathogenicity of three
strains with different degrees of virulence that were studied, as that with the highest virulence was transformed
to the yeast phase (virulent) more quickly [31]. Phenotypic differences associated with geographical areas have
also been observed in other human pathogens, such as
S. schenckii isolates from MX, Colombia (CO) and Guatemala (GT). The isolates from CO were heat-resistant
and had larger conidia than those from MX and GT.
Furthermore, genotyping by RAPD-PCR showed that
these isolates were grouped according to their geographical origin [20]. The authors also suggested that the
characteristics of the isolates from CO were related to
the clinical form of the disease, as the fixed form of
sporotrichosis predominates in CO.
Because the isolates from PE showed characteristics
that were different from the other isolates studied, we
measured their antifungal susceptibility agents AMB,
ITZ and VCZ. Some new species of A. section Fumigati,
for example A. lentulus, show an association between
resistance to antifungal and slow sporulation [32]. However, this study found no such association in the group
from PE, with only the AR fungus showing resistant isolates. In this study, resistance to antifungal showed no
association to their geographical origin.
However, the dendrogram built based on the phenotypic characteristics (thermotolerance, conidia and vesicle
sizes) (Figure 2) show that the isolates from FR and PE
cluster according to their geographical origin, while isolates from MX and AR form a single cluster unrelated
to their geographical origin. This is contrary to what is
observed when analyzing the genotypical characteristics,
where the majority of the isolates separate according to
geographic origin [21]. This confirms that these molecular markers are more sensible to the discrimination
between isolates by geographic origin. On the other
hand, when the dendrogram was built including the

Frías-De León et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/116

phenotypes and genotypes (Figure 3), it was seen that
the isolation of the Af-34 from FR formed an independent group not shown in the dendrogram built only
with the phenotypic data, nor recorded in Duarte-Escalante et al. [21]. This cluster is confirmed using PCoA.
It is interesting to note that the discrimination power
increases when the phenotypic and genotypic methods
are analyzed together.
It is noteworthy that although the phenotypic characteristics do not differentiate phylogenetic species of A.
section Fumigati, they do help show the intraspecies differences [33], since the species included in this section
have morphological differences which may lead to an
erroneous identification and reason why these organisms
are discarded since they are considered as contaminants.
To avoid this error, it is important to take the morphological differences into consideration to later confirm the
presence of another species using genotypical methods,
such as the analysis of partial sequences of the ß-tubulinencoding gene (benA), the mitochondrial cytochrome bencoding gene (mtcytb), the rodlet A encoding gene
(rodA), the salt-responsive gene, the internal transcribed
spacer (ITS)1-5.8S-ITS2 region, the genes encoding calmodulin and actin [5,7,17,33-35]. Additionally, it is
important to note that a good differentiation, whether
intra or interspecies, is based on the results of the combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods since the
phenotypic characteristics by themselves do not differentiate them but provide a hint towards the identification
of a species later confirmed using molecular methods.
On the other hand, when distance matrices are generated from phenotypic and genotypic (AFLP) characteristics, we found a low correlation (r = 0.0105), probably
due to the number of PE isolates studied. However, the
association between them was statistically significant (p
= 0.032). This association again supports that certain
phenotypical characteristics (growth rate and vesicle
size) work together to cluster the isolates according to
geographical origin. However, it is noteworthy that the
phenotypic characteristics may vary depending on the
surrounding environmental conditions where the fungus
grows since the expression of a phenotypic character is
the result of the interaction of the genotype with the
environment and is therefore likely to be modified when
environmental conditions such as climate, age of culture
or incubation temperature vary. In addition, it may be
the case that the genetic information is not completely
expressed and the phenotype reflects only a small part
of this information [36].

Conclusions
The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic
characteristics showed a statistically significant association. We consider that the phenotypic and genotypic

Page 8 of 9

methods together increase the power discrimination
between isolates. Moreover, it is pertinent to point out
that in order to obtain greater knowledge about the
phenotypic variability of A. fumigatus, it is important to
gather a greater number of isolates from PE and FR. It
also highlights the need for each country to carry out
specific studies for determining the molecular or phenotypic tools that are appropriate for the correct identification of the fungus and for providing proper treatment.
These studies will also identify sources of infection,
resulting in a better control of aspergillosis.
