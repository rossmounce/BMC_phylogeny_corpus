Abstract
Background: Due to an increasing number of norovirus infections in the last years rapid, specific,
and sensitive diagnostic tools are needed. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RTPCR) have become the methods of choice. To minimize the working time and the risk of carryover
contamination during the multi-step procedure of PCR the multiplex real-time RT-PCR for the
simultaneous detection of genogroup I (GI) and II (GII) offers advantages for the handling of large
amounts of clinical specimens.
Methods: We have developed and evaluated a multiplex one-tube RT-PCR using a combination
of optimized GI and GII specific primers located in the junction between ORF1 and ORF2 of the
norovirus genome. For the detection of GI samples, a 3'- minor groove binder-DNA probe (GIMGB-probe) were designed and used for the multiplex real-time PCR.
Results: Comparable results to those of our in-house nested PCR and monoplex real-time-PCR
were only obtained using the GI specific MGB-probe. The MGB-probe forms extremely stable
duplexes with single-stranded DNA targets, which enabled us to design a shorter probe (length 15
nucleotides) hybridizing to a more conserved part of the GI sequences. 97 % of 100 previously
norovirus positive specimens (tested by nested PCR and/or monoplex real-time PCR) were
detected by the multiplex real-time PCR. A broad dynamic range from 2 × 10^1 to 2 × 10^7
genomic equivalents per assay using plasmid DNA standards for GI and GII were obtained and viral
loads between 2.5 × 10^2 and 2 × 10^12 copies per ml stool suspension were detected.
Conclusion: The one-tube multiplex RT real-time PCR using a minor groove binder -DNA probe
for GI is a fast, specific, sensitive and cost-effective tool for the detection of norovirus infections in
both mass outbreaks and sporadic cases and may have also applications in food and environmental
testing.

Background
Norovirus (NV), one genus of the family of Caliciviridae, is
one of the most commonly reported etiological agents of
non-bacterial gastroenteritis in human world-wide. In
Germany, increasing numbers of NV cases have been

reported to the public health authorities between 2001
(9,223 reports) and 2004 (64,893 reports) [1,2]. Especially, in the winter seasons 2002/2003 and 2004/2005
(October to April) a substantial increase of norovirus outbreaks have been detected in Germany as well in Western

Europe [3,4]. Hospitals, residential facilities/nursing
homes and schools/nurseries were most frequently
affected. To prevent further spreading of the causative
agent during a mass outbreak especially in semi closed
communities, such as hospitals and nursing homes, an
immediate application of hygiene measures as well as
rapid and sensitive diagnostics are needed. The increasing
knowledge of the molecular properties of caliciviruses led
to the development of different assays for the detection of
norovirus RNA and viral antigen (reviewed in [5]). Since
enzyme immunoassays were found to be insufficient sensitive and/or insufficient specific so far [5-9] RT-PCR
assays have become the methods of choice [10-13]. To
minimize the working time and the possibility of carryover contamination during the multi-step procedure of
RT-PCR, increasing attention has been paid to the detection by fluorogenic real-time PCR [14-18]. Due to the
high sequence diversity of human NV which is classified
into 3 genogroups (GI, GII, and GIV) containing at least 7
different genotypes in GI and 12 genotypes in GII [19,20]
the optimization of primers and probes are crucial.
Recently, we have reported the application of a one-tube
real-time PCR using two primer/probe sets for the detection of NV GI and GII sequences in separate assays (monoplex real-time PCR) [21,22]. Using the genogroup
specific oligonucleotide probes used in this monoplex GI
and GII real-time PCR the combination in a multiplex
PCR resulted in ineffective detection. Recently, the implementation of a minor groove binding protein (MGB) and
nonfluorescent quencher (NFQ) significantly improved
the chemistry of the real-time PCR [23]. In this study, we
applied a GI specific MGB-probe which enables us to
develop a broadly reactive and sensitive multiplex realtime RT- PCR for the simultaneous detection of both
genogroups using a TaqMan® 7700. Due to the utilization
of two different fluorophores (FAM and VIC) for the
probes a differentiation between GI and GII genotypes as
well as the detection of double infection with GI and GII
genotypes is possible.

Methods
Clinical specimens
Altogether, 100 NV positive stool specimens and 40 NV
negative specimens were used to evaluate our multiplex
real-time RT-PCR. The stool specimens were obtained
between January 2004 to June 2005 from 39 norovirus
derived outbreaks and 31 sporadic cases in various geographical areas in Germany as well as from 40 healthy
individuals without any sign of gastroenteritis. All samples were previously tested by our in house RT/nested PCR
[11] and/or the monoplex real-time PCR described earlier.
Sample processing
Viral RNA was extracted from stool specimens using
QIAamp™ Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to our ORF1 in house RT/nested
PCR and to the monoplex real-time PCR. For genotyping
the ORF1 amplicons were directly sequenced using the
BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism
3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
USA). Sequences were aligned to prototype sequences
drawn from GenBank using CLUSTAL W version 1.6 and
phylogenetic trees were produced using the neighbour
joining and DNADIST program of the Phylogeny Interference Package (PHYLIP) version 3.57c [24].
One tube multiplex real-time RT-PCR
Sequences of oligonucleotide primers for the monoplex
real-time PCR of NV GI and GII and the GII specific probe
have been described earlier. The optimized primer and
probe sequences used for the multiplex real-time RT-PCR
are listed in table 1. The sense primer for GII (NV107a)
was supplemented with an oligonucleotide primer containing inosin at the more variable nucleotide positions
(NV107c). All primers were obtained from BioTez (Berlin,
Germany). The MGB-GI probe (Applied Biosystems UK)
was labelled at 5'-term with the fluorophor VIC and at the
3'-term with MGB/non fluorescent quencher (NFQ) dabcyl and the GII probe (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany)
was labelled at 5'-term with 6-FAM and 3' with NFQ. The
single-tube multiplex real time RT-PCR was carried out in
0.2 ml tubes (96-well PCR plates, Thermo-Fast 96,

Abigene, Surrey, UK) using a TaqMan® 7700. The reaction
was performed in 12 μl volumes using the QuantiTect
Probe RT-PCR Kit from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) containing 1x Quantitect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix (including HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, Tris-HCl, KCl,
(NH4)2SO4, 4 mM MgCl2, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, dUTP
and the internal reference dye ROX), 0.2 μM of each
primer as described in table 1; 80 nM GI TM9 MGB probe;
160 nM GII TM3A probe and 0.2 μl of QuantiTect Probe
RT Mix containing Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse
transcriptases. Two microliters of sample RNA preparation or standard DNA were added to each reaction. Thermal cycling for the TaqMan 7700 was performed as
follows: 30 min at 50°C for reverse transcription, 15 min
at 95°C for heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptases
and the initial activation of the HotStar polymerase, 45
cycles of 20 seconds at 94°C and 30 seconds at 60°C. The
fluorescence data were collected at the end of the 60°C
step. To generate a standard curve 10-fold serial dilution
of plasmid-DNA containing the appropriate GI or GII
sequences were used as described earlier.

Results
All results of the multiplex real-time RT-PCR were compared to the results achieved by our in-house nested RTPCR and our monoplex real-time PCR. Sequence analysis
revealed that the panel of 100 NV positive specimens consisted of 4 different GI and 8 different GII genotypes/subtypes including naturally occurring recombinants
(polymerase region: GIIb but capsid region: GII.3
[25,26]) as well as 2 new GII genotypes which were not
classified up to now (table 2). As increasingly numbers of
new NV sequences can be observed in GenBank updates
of primers and probes were necessary. To ensure the detection of a broad range of NV genotypes using the multiplex
TaqMan RT-PCR we used the GII sense primer NV 107 as
a mixture of the original described primer NV107a and an
inosin-containing primer NV107c located at the same
position. All final primer sequences as well as the design
of the GI-MGB-probe and the GII-probe are shown in
table 1.
The dynamic range of our multiplex real-time RT-PCR was
determined using a 10-fold serial dilution of a GI and a
GII plasmid DNA standard containing the appropriate
gene fragment as described earlier. The standard curves for
GI and GII showed linearity between 2 × 107 and 2 × 101
genome equivalents per assay with a slope of -3.13 and 2.94 for GI and GII, respectively (fig. 1). The coefficients
of correlation of r2= 0.98 and 0.99 indicate a strong linear
relationship. No cross-reactivity between GI and GII using
the two different dye-layers of FAM and VIC were
observed. Using 10-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA prepared from a GI.3 and a GII.4 positive stool specimen
containing about 106 copies/assay the multiplex real-time

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/69

RT-PCR was able to detect RNA dilutions within 5 logs
(fig. 2). Thus, about 10–20 genomic equivalents per multiplex TaqMan RT-PCR assay could be detected which is
comparable to the detection limit of the monoplex realtime PCR.
Overall, 97 out of the 100 nested PCR and/or monoplex
real-time PCR positive specimens were positive in the
multiplex assay (sensitivity: 97 %). All 40 NV negative
specimens were also negative in the multiplex-TaqMan
PCR. Samples of all 12 different NV genotypes/subtypes
tested (4 GI and 8 GII genotypes) were detectable (table
2). To evaluate the quantities detected by the multiplex
TaqMan PCR we compared the viral loads to those
detected by the monoplex TaqMan-PCR using 72 different
stool samples (fig. 3). The median of viral load of specimens detected by the multiplex and the monoplex TaqMan-PCR, respectively, were found to be 1.05 × 108 and
2.27 × 108 genomic equivalents per ml. A P value of 0.6 as
determined by the paired t-test showed that the means
were not significant different (p > 0.05). Using 4 different
stool specimens (two GI.3 and two GII.4) in 3 individual
assays the coefficients of variation of Ct values were
between 0.25 % and 4.02 %.
Three mixtures of known copy numbers of GI and GII
plasmid DNA containing each 106, 104, or 102 genomic
equivalents as well as four viral RNA mixtures (each 106,
105, 104, and 102 genom. equ.) were amplified by the
multiplex real-time assay. As shown in table 3, GI and GII
could be detected in all mixtures with a good correlation
to the expected values between 106 and 104 genomic
equivalents. Also in the mixtures containing the highest
dilution (102 copies) both genotypes could be detected
but with more variation from the expected value.

Discussion
For the diagnostic of increasing numbers of stool samples
from single cases of viral gastroenteritis infections and
especially in mass outbreaks occurring in the winter seasons a fast, sensitive and specific assay is required. Due to
the genetic diversity of human noroviruses the selection of
a highly conserved genome region is very important for
the design of universal primers and probes for all genotypes. Multiple sequence analysis showed that the highest
nucleotide homology is located in the ORF1 -ORF2 junction [14]. Nevertheless, differences between GI and GII
sequences are considerable in this region so that different
primers/probes sets including two different or wobbled
GI probes or SYBR Green I detection instead of specific
probes had to be used by several author's
[14,16,17,22,27]. To simplify the real-time PCR and to
reduce the costs, we developed a multiplex one-tube realtime RT-PCR exhibiting a high sensitivity and specificity
while being broadly reactive for both genogroups. In the

method described here the performance of the GI probe
was increased by the use of the MGB probe technology.
TaqMan-MGB probes are more stable and show an
improved signal-to noise ratio due to the use of non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) instead of the fluorescent
quencher TAMRA. The MGB stabilizes the hybridization
of the probe leading to an increased melting temperature
even for very short oligonucleotides of 13 – 15 nucleotide
length. For that reason, the length of our GI specific TaqMan probe could be optimized to fit to a shorter, more

ther update of primer/probe sequences should be considered if new, aberrant norovirus sequences are available at
EMBL or NCBI databases. Using two different fluorophores for the genogroup-specific probes the multiplex
RT- real-time PCR permits the allocation to genogroup I or
II or even the detection of mixtures of genogroups in one
sample. This might be of special interest for the norovirus
detection in wastewater or in contaminated sea food, such
as oysters or shellfish.

Conclusion
multiplex TaqMan

We have developed a broadly reactive, fast and sensitive
one-tube RT/real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of human norovirus genogroup I
and II. Due to the application of a MGB-probe the specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex real-time PCR is comparable to that of the monoplex real-time PCR but saving
time and costs. Thus, the multiplex real-time PCR might
be useful for the norovirus detection in mass outbreaks
and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis as well as in contaminated seafood and waste water.

Competing interests
strains have been detected and characterized [20]. The
genotypes tested by our multiplex real-time PCR represent
the majority of noroviruses circulating in Germany in the
last two years. Using the primers/probes described here
for the multiplex real-time PCR, we were able to detect at
least all 12 different genotypes/subtypes tested including
4 specimens related to the naturally occurring recombinants like Arg320/1995/AR [AF190817] and Bad
Berleburg477/2001/DE [AF409067] [25,26]. The three
negative tested samples (two GII.4 and one GII.2) may
related to a very low copy number probably due to degradation of viral RNA during several freeze/thawing cycles
during the long-term storage. Furthermore, two so far
unclassified GII genotypes have been detected, one strain
distantly related to the sequence of the polymerase fragment of GenBank: AB084786 and two samples distantly
related to GenBank AY673935. Although, our multiplex
real-time PCR was able to detect two new genotypes a fur-
