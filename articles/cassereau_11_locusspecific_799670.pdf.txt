Abstract
Background: The ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1), which is involved in the
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the most commonly inherited peripheral neuropathy, encodes a protein
anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane. The phenotypic presentations of patients carrying GDAP1
mutations are heterogeneous, making it difficult to determine genotype-phenotype correlations, since the majority
of the mutations have been found in only a few unrelated patients. Locus-specific databases (LSDB) established in
the framework of the Human Variome Project provide powerful tools for the investigation of such rare diseases.
Methods and Results: We report the development of a publicly accessible LSDB for the GDAP1 gene. The GDAP1
LSDB has adopted the Leiden Open-source Variation Database (LOVD) software platform. This database, which now
contains 57 unique variants reported in 179 cases of CMT, offers a detailed description of the molecular, clinical
and electrophysiological data of the patients. The usefulness of the GDAP1 database is illustrated by the finding
that GDAP1 mutations lead to primary axonal damage in CMT, with secondary demyelination in the more severe
cases of the disease.
Conclusion: Findings of this nature should lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of CMT. Finally,
the GDAP1 LSDB, which is part of the mitodyn.org portal of databases of genes incriminated in disorders involving
mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, should yield new insights into mitochondrial diseases.

Background
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is one of the commonest inherited peripheral neuropathies with a prevalence of about 10-30 per 100,000, depending on the
country of origin [1]. CMT neuropathies are characterized clinically by progressive sensory loss, weakness, muscle atrophy, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and foot
deformities. To date, about forty genes have been incriminated in CMT. Some of these genes encode mitochondrial proteins, i.e. mitofusin 2 (MFN2) [MIM:608507]

and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associatedprotein 1 (GDAP1) [MIM:606598]. GDAP1 mutations are
responsible: for CMT4A [MIM:214400] [2], the most frequent recessive subtype of demyelinating CMT; for ARCMT2 [MIM:607706] [3], the axonal recessive subtype;
for CMTRIA [MIM:608340] [4], the intermediate recessive CMT; and for CMT2K [MIM:607831] [5-7], the rare
dominant subtype.
The gene locus, first identified in cases of CMT4A in
Tunisian families on chromosome 8q13-q21 (CMT4A),
is associated with slow motor nerve conduction velocity,
and hypomyelination as detected by nerve biopsy [8].

Baxter et al. (2002). GDAP1 was previously identified as
one of ten cDNAs expressed in a differentiated Neuro2a
mouse neuroblastoma cell line, in which cholinergic differentiation with neurite sprouting had been induced by
transfection of GD3 synthase (a2,8 sialyltransferase)
cDNA [9].
The GDAP1 gene spans ~17 kilobases of genomic
DNA, containing six exons and five introns. Two transcript variants of GDAP1 have been identified. Transcript variant 1, representing the longer variant, encodes
the longer isoform, designated as isoform a (358 amino
acids). Transcript variant 2, encoding isoform b, contains an alternate in-frame exon, uses an alternate splice
site in the 5’-coding region and a downstream start
codon, compared to transcript variant 1. Isoform b (290
amino acids) has a shorter N-terminal sequence compared to isoform a. mRNA studies using RT-PCR have
demonstrated the ubiquitous expression of GDAP1, predominantly in nervous tissues [3].
Phylogenetic and structural analyses suggest that
GDAP1 belongs to a subfamily of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) [3,10,11]. GDAP1 has two typical GST
domains, domain I (GST-N) at the N-terminal region
and domain II (GST-C) at the C-terminal region. The
existence of these domains was predicted by using
bioinformatics tools [3,10] but no functional GST activity has been demonstrated so far [11,12]. It has also
been shown that GDAP1 has a single transmembrane
domain (TMD) at the extremity of the C-terminal, and
a hydrophobic domain (HD) in the flanking C-terminal
region [10,13]. Moreover, GDAP1 has two additional
regions between amino acids 152-164 and 169-195 that
are predicted to represent two helices, a4 and a5, constituting the a4-a5 loop.
Several studies have suggested that GDAP1 plays a
role in mitochondrial fission [14,15]. It was shown that
the TMD plays a key role in mitochondrial targeting
and mitochondrial membrane insertion [13]. Positively
charged amino acids flanking the TMD at the C-terminal are involved in mitochondrial targeting and the fission function of GDAP1. The HD seems essential for
the mitochondrial fission mediated by GDAP1. We have
recently shown that GDAP1 mutations in fibroblasts
from CMT2K patients are associated with defective
mitochondrial complex I activity [5].
The examination of the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype of the various forms of CMT
disease involving GDAP1 mutations shows that the
recessive forms are generally far more severe than the
dominant forms. In particular, the truncating mutations
have a more severe phenotype in the recessive forms
with early onset and rapid progression of the disease
leading to the inability to walk by the age of 10,

Page 2 of 8

generally followed by wheelchair-dependence before the
end of the third decade [16].
However, the phenotypic presentations of patients carrying GDAP1 mutations are heterogeneous. There is not
only a large clinical variability concerning the ages of
onset and functional disability among patients carrying
the same mutations [17] but also a significant intrafamilial variability [18]. Since the majority of mutations
have been described in only a few unrelated patients, it
is difficult to determine phenotype-genotype correlations
for GDAP1 gene mutations. The analysis of a larger
number of cases of CMT involving GDAP1 mutations,
along with detailed clinical, electrophysiological and
pathological data, will be required to establish a reliable
relationship between the genotype and phenotype of the
different forms of the disease.
The increasing importance of GDAP1 in CMT
prompted us to develop a web-based locus-specific database (LSDB) for GDAP1 sequence variations with short
publication delays. To our knowledge, the only other
database collecting GDAP1 mutations is the Inherited
Peripheral Neuropathies Mutation Database (IPNMDB)
[19], which includes 29 GDAP1 mutations among the
953 mutations in 44 genes related to inherited peripheral neuropathies. Our LSDB aims at collecting all the
GDAP1 mutations incriminated in disorders involving
mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, with a full
record of clinical, electrophysiological and biochemical
data. We here describe the construction of the database,
the procedure for data submission, and the presentation
of the data.

Methods
We have established a locus-specific database for
GDAP1 using the Leiden Open-source Variation Database (LOVD) version 2 build 31 system [20]. This database includes a total of 20 variant items and 18 clinical
patient items. Figure 1 shows a typical entry. A standardized description of the clinical and molecular items is
set up using drop-down lists with predefined variables.
The clinical features are based on the usual symptoms
of mitochondrial diseases.
The data is openly accessible and should prove a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers alike since it will
contain published as well as unpublished sequence variants. Contributors can submit their variants online to
the database after registering for a login and password.
This contact information is collected for reference purposes and clarification of the data submitted. The
description of mutational data is confirmed using the
web-based software Mutalyzer, to which the LOVD software is currently also linked [21]. Variations submitted
directly to the LSDB are re-checked with these tools.

The GDAP1 database reviews all the clinical and
molecular data of patients carrying GDAP1 mutations
published in peer-reviewed literature, as well as unpublished contributions that may be directly submitted.
While most variants can be described in terms of the

latest update of the standard nomenclature [22,23],
some inaccuracies may persist because gene anomalies
discovered earlier might have been named according to
a convention now out of use. Eventually, the DNA published field of the page dedicated to each variant (Figure

1b) indicates whether the published name of the mutation has been modified by the curator. The GDAP1
LSDB website requires absolute compliance with the
rules set out below to describe sequence variants in
order to provide uniform and comparable data.
The GDAP1 mutations are described according to the
GDAP1 transcript variant 1 [RefSeq:NM_018972.2], containing 6 exons and encoding isoform a containing 358
amino acids. The nucleotide numbering of nuclear
genes reflects cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding
to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon in the
reference sequence, according to the guidelines of the
Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). The initiation codon is codon 1.
The criteria of pathogenicity, dependent on the clinical context and molecular findings, are stated in the
Variant data fields: Reported pathogenicity and Concluded pathogenicity (Figure 1b). Putative novel mutations detected in affected patients must segregate
according to disease status and not be present in control
individuals. Putative mutations are graded according to
type of mutation: frameshift and nonsense mutations are
considered to be pathogenic; missense mutations are
described as being of unknown pathogenicity when
detected in single families, or as probably pathogenic
when detected in a group of families; the mutations are
considered to be pathogenic when so proven by experimental evidence or detected in multiple families.

Results and discussion
Type of mutations and affected domains

To date, the GDAP1 database contains 57 unique variants, four of which are considered as non-pathogenic
sequence variants (NPSV). Pathogenic mutations, which
affect the coding sequence of the gene, are more frequently found in exon 3 (17 mutations) and exon 6 (14
mutations) (Figure 2a). The most frequent mutational
protein consequences are missense mutations observed
in 34 of the 53 variant mutations. In addition, nine frameshifts (18%), seven nonsense (14%) and three splicesite (6%) mutations have also been reported (Figure 2b).
Whereas few mutations are recurrent, some have been
frequently reported: the c.581C>G mutation (p.Ser194X)
reported 38 times in Spain, Morocco and Tunisia; the
c.487C>T mutation (p.Gln163X) reported 34 times,
mainly in Spain; the c.715C>T mutation (p.Leu239Phe)
reported 28 times, mainly in Eastern Europe; and the
c.358C>T mutation (p.Arg120Trp) 22 times, mainly in
Spain.
Among all the pathogenic variants mentioned in the
database, 56% are located in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) domains of the protein (Figure 2c), highlighting the important role of these domains in protein
function, as recently reported [24]. Among the 34

Page 4 of 8

missense mutations, 21 (62%) affect GST domains: 6 in
GST-N and 15 in GST-C; 5 (14.5%) affect the a4-a5
loop; one affects the hydrophphobic domain, one affects
the transmembrane domain; and 6 (17.5%) affect no particular domain of the protein. Interestingly, 5 of the 9
missense mutations involved in CMT2K are located in
GST domains (p.Ser34Cys in GST-N, and p.Gln218Glu,
p.Arg226Ser, p.Cys240Tyr and p.Pro274Leu in GST-C).
Similarly, 35 of the 45 patients (78%) presenting with
the recessive form of the disease associated with homozygous missense mutations, harbor mutations located in
GST domains (12 in GST-N and 23 in GST-C). In addition, truncating mutations located upstream of amino
acid 287 affect at least one GST domain, as is the case
in almost all truncating mutations reported.
Clinical data

To date, the database includes 179 patients (93 females,
75 males and 11 not specified): 47 with a dominant
form CMT2K, and 126 with a recessive form (CMT4A,
AR-CMT2 or CMTRIA). Six patients were unclassified,
either because the authors suspected mutations on the
second allele, or because the pathogenicity of the second
variant was uncertain. The database shows the clinical
data for all the patients reported, with the exception of
28 patients for whom the data was unavailable or insufficient for classification of the phenotype.
Clinical severity was evaluated according to the age of
onset of the disease, i.e. before age 10, between ages 1130, and after age 30, and by walking ability, i.e. independent, requiring technical assistance with a cane or a
crutch, or wheelchair-bound, before or after age 30. The
phenotypic data correlated with the mutational data in
patients with sufficient clinical data for each item:
- age of onset according to: (1) the mode of inheritance (dominant or recessive); and (2) the domains
affected in the dominant forms of CMT (GST domains,
a4-a5 loop, transmembrane domain, hydrophobic
domain or non-specific domain);
- disability in walking according to: (1) the mode of
inheritance (dominant or recessive); and (2) the predicted effect at the protein level: truncating mutations
or missense mutations.
Data analysis shows that patients with recessive forms
of CMT, i.e. CMT4A and AR-CMT2, presented a more
severe phenotype than those with the dominant form, i.
e. CMT2K, with a more early onset and a more rapid
evolution (Table 1). Interestingly, nineteen percent of
patients with the dominant form of CMT were asymptomatic until age 30, whereas all patients with a recessive
form had symptoms before the end of the adolescence.
In addition, mutations affecting GST domains were
responsible for a more severe phenotype probably produced by a different pathophysiological mechanism.

Almost all patients with mutations in GST domains
were symptomatic after age 50 whereas 17% of patients
with mutations in non-specific domains were asymptomatic after the age of 50. These findings suggest that
mutations affecting GST domains are responsible for a
more severe phenotype probably due to a different
pathophysiological mechanism.

The course of CMT associated with GDAP1 mutations
was more rapid in the recessive form than in the dominant forms (Table 2). All AR-CMT patients required
technical support for walking after age 30. In contrast,
among the CMT2K patients reported in the database,
78% walked independently after age 30. Nonsense and
frameshift mutations were more often associated with a

severe phenotype of CMT than missense mutations.
Although in each case all patients needed technical
assistance with a cane or a crutch for walking after age
30, the course of the disease was more rapid in patients
with homozygous truncating mutations: almost all
patients over 30 (93%) were wheelchair-bound versus
50% of patients harboring missense mutations (Table 2).
A greater number of cases of CMT disease involving
GDAP1 mutations, along with detailed clinical, electrophysiological and pathological data, will be required to
determine the relationship between the genotype and
phenotype of the different forms of the disease. This is
precisely the aim of our database.
Electrophysiological data

Major axonal loss reduces the motor median nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) so that the cut-off value of
MNCV should be adjusted according to the compound
motor action potential (CMAP), such that the MNCV is

32 m/s when the CMAP is 4 mV, as proposed for
acquired demyelinating neuropathies [25]. The demyelinating forms of CMT may thus be defined by an
MNCV slower than 30 m/s, the axonal forms by an
MNCV above 40 m/s, and the intermediate forms by an
MNCV between 30-40 m/s [26]. We have therefore
included these electrophysiological categories in our
database in order to characterize the neuropathies associated with GDAP1 mutations. To determine the type of
neuropathy, we need to report not only the MNCV but
also the CMAP reflecting the axonal loss. GDAP1 mutations have been described as responsible for CMT4A,
the demyelinating form; AR-CMT2 and CMT2K, the
axonal forms; and CMTRIA, the intermediate form of
CMT.
Our database contains the electrophysiological parameters for all the CMT patients reported, with the
exception of 48 patients for whom the data were insufficient. Thus, our analysis concerns 131 patients among
whom 30 (23%) had no recordable median nerve parameters suggesting severe axonal loss (Table 3). The
majority of patients are reported to have MNCVs
greater than 40 m/s, corresponding to the axonal forms
of CMT and only 9 patients (7%) with MNCVs less than
30 m/s, corresponding to the demyelinating forms of
CMT. However, all MNCVs less than 30 m/s (100%)
were associated with major reductions of amplitude,
with values less than 0.5 mV. These electrophysiological
findings underscore the presence of severe axonal neuropathies with secondary demyelination in CMT associated with GDAP1 mutations.
Indeed, in demyelinating forms of CMT disease affecting myelinic proteins, such as CMT1A [MIM:118220],
CMT1B [MIM:118200] [27-29] as well as in other forms
of the disease, such as CMT4 [30], the conduction velocity is lower than 30 m/s even in the early phases of
myelination and is definitely established between three

to five years of age. This conduction velocity is independent of the clinical severity and progression of CMT,
and could therefore serve as a marker of the disease
even in asymptomatic patients. In contrast, the amplitudes that were initially normal decreased progressively
over time following secondary axonal loss. Moreover,
histopathological analyses of nerve biopsies described in
cases of CMT involving GDAP1 mutations have revealed
a loss of large myelinated fibres, which is known to
reduce the MNCV [16].
Finally, the analysis of the database presented here
shows that GDAP1 mutations are responsible for primary axonal damage in CMT, with secondary demyelination in the more severe cases of the disease. Findings
of this nature should lead to a better understanding of
the pathophysiology of CMT.

Conclusions
One of the patients with a GDAP1 mutation referred to
our database also carried a mutation in the MFN2 gene
[31]. Such cases of multiple gene mutations are now
being brought to light more often with the rapid
advance of genetic investigations. The GDAP1 database
is part of the MITOchondrial DYNamics variation portal
(mitodyn.org), aimed at specializing in genes involved in
disorders of mitochondrial dynamics [32]. The mitodyn.
org will therefore incorporate other genes involved in
diseases affecting mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics. Thus, the OPA1 LSDB (eOPA1) [33], curated by
our laboratory, will soon be transferred to mitodyn.org.
We will then integrate MFN2, responsible for CMT2A2
[MIM:609260] [34], and DNM1L associated with encephalopathy with lactic acidosis [MIM:603850] [35].
Since the same patients may be affected by these different diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction, the
data collected should interest physicians and researchers
alike. Eventually, we hope to be able to refine genotypephenotype correlations in diseases involving mitochondrial dynamics by comparing and cross-checking the
clinical, electrophysiological and biochemical data
recorded in the mitodyn.org databases.
