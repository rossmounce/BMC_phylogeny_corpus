Abstract
Background: The role of centrioles in mitotic spindle function remains unclear. One approach to
investigate mitotic centriole function is to ask whether mutation of centriole-associated proteins
can cause genomic instability.
Results: We addressed the role of the centriole-associated EF-hand protein centrin in genomic
stability using a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin mutant that forms acentriolar bipolar spindles and
lacks the centrin-based rhizoplast structures that join centrioles to the nucleus. Using a genetic
assay for loss of heterozygosity, we found that this centrin mutant showed increased genomic
instability compared to wild-type cells, and we determined that the increase in genomic instability
was due to a 100-fold increase in chromosome loss rates compared to wild type. Live cell imaging
reveals an increased rate in cell death during G1 in haploid cells that is consistent with an elevated
rate of chromosome loss, and analysis of cell death versus centriole copy number argues against a
role for multipolar spindles in this process.
Conclusion: The increased chromosome loss rates observed in a centrin mutant that forms
acentriolar spindles suggests a role for centrin protein, and possibly centrioles, in mitotic fidelity.

Background
Centrioles are cylindrical structures located within the
core of the centrosome. Although the localization of centrioles within the centrosome together with their precise
duplication prior to mitosis has suggested a role in bipolar
spindle assembly or function, the actual role of centrioles
in cell division remains unclear and controversial. Cells
from which centrioles and centrosomes are ablated can
still form bipolar spindles via a centrosome-independent
self-organization process, but the effectiveness of such
spindles in terms of chromosome segregation has not
been carefully measured. Based on the circumstantial evi-

dence that tumor cells which display genomic instability
also frequently show aberrations in centriole structure or
copy number [1,2], it has been proposed that centrioles
may participate in the maintenance of genomic stability.
If centrioles play a role in chromosome segregation, then
mutations in genes encoding centriolar proteins would be
expected to result in genomic instability.
The EF-hand protein centrin [3] is one of the few identified centriolar proteins. Centrin is found in all eukaryotes,
and is localized to centrioles in vertebrate cells [4], basal
bodies in green algae [5], and spindle pole bodies (SPBs)

in yeast [6,7]. Centrin is functionally required for centriole duplication [8,9] and inheritance [10]. RNAi experiments in mammalian and algal cells have indicated that
reduction of centrin can result in cell division arrest [9]
and cytokinesis failure [11]. However, it is unclear if these
defects are indirectly caused by abnormal centriole structure or copy number, or if instead they represent pleiotropic effects due to the direct participation of centrin in
the cell division process. Centrin also appears to be
involved in many other cellular processes, including flagellar excision [12], nuclear mRNA export [13], cell membrane integrity [14] and homologous recombination [15].
Consistent with these multiple roles, centrin localization
is not restricted to centrioles [4], and centrin has been
identified as a component of nuclear pores and flagellar
dynein complexes [16,17]. Centrin is thus a versatile molecule that has been adapted to perform multiple diverse
cellular functions. Given the fact that centrin localizes to
centrioles, which are potentially involved in genome
maintenance, together with the fact that centrin is functionally involved in centriole duplication and segregation,
an obvious question is whether centrin plays a role in
genomic stability. In this report we address this question
using a centrin mutation in the green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii.

Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii.
Chlamydomonas
(Chlamydomonas refers to Chlamydomonas reinhardti
throughout) is a unicellular green alga with genetics similar to yeast, but which, unlike yeast, has centrioles (known
as basal bodies) that are virtually identical to centrioles of
vertebrate cells. In Chlamydomonas, centrin polymerizes
into long fibers that link the centrioles/basal bodies to the
nucleus. These fibers are called the nucleus basal body
connectors (NBBCs) or rhizoplasts [18,19]. The vfl2-1
mutant has a point mutation in the centrin gene [10], and
these mutants produce a reduced quantity of centrin protein that is unable to polymerize into a rhizoplast. The vfl2
mutation appears to result in a defect in centriole segregation, because mutant cells have a variable number of centrioles (between zero and six per cell). Despite their
centriole number variation, these mutants are viable and
form seemingly normal bipolar mitotic spindles. It has
been argued on this basis that centrin-based rhizoplasts
do not play a role in mitosis [19]. Importantly, the centrioles in a vfl2 mutant cell are not located at the spindle
poles [19], consistent with ultrastructural studies showing
that, in green algae, centrioles are joined to the spindle
poles by centrin-based fibers derived from the rhizoplast
[20]. The high viability of vfl2 mutants thus allows us to
measure genomic instability using genetic assays because
populations of mutant cells can be grown for a sufficient
number of generations to allow rare chromosome loss
events to be detected.
We measured genomic instability in vfl2 mutants using a
simple genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously developed by Dutcher and coworkers [21]. This
assay uses the act2 mutation, which confers recessive
resistance to cycloheximide [22]. The act2 heterozygous
diploids are sensitive to cycloheximide, while
homozygous or hemizygous act2 diploids are cycloheximide-resistant. When a diploid culture is plated on media
containing cycloheximide, only cells that have lost the
wild-type ACT2 allele can grow. By measuring the frequency with which such cells arise, the rate of chromosome loss can be calculated (see Methods). As illustrated
in Fig. 1, using 48 independently constructed diploid lines
each for wild type and vfl2, we found that the LOH rate per
cell division increased from 1.5 × 10-3 ± 1.6 × 10-4 SEM (n
= 48) in wild type, to 8.8 × 10-3 ± 5.7 × 10-4 SEM (n = 48)
in vfl2 mutants. This difference is statistically significant
(P < 0.00005 based on one-tailed Welch's approximate ttest, t = 12.2). The increase in loss of heterozygosity in the
vfl2 centrin mutant relative to wild-type cells indicates
that centrin plays a role in genomic stability.
Genomic instability occurs via chromosome loss
In principle the LOH seen in vfl2 mutants could occur
either by increased recombination or increased chromosome loss (Fig. 2). The latter would be consistent with a

Figure 2 of ACT2 LOH
Pathways
Pathways of ACT2 LOH. LOH due to mitotic recombination,
including crossover and gene conversion events, will have no
effect on the mating type locus MT on the other arm of the
chromosome; hence cells will retain both the MT+ and MTalleles. This is also true for spontaneous mutation of the
ACT2 gene. In contrast, chromosome loss will result in simultaneous LOH at both ACT2 and MT.

role for centrin or centrioles in mitotic spindle function,
while an effect on recombination would suggest a spindleindependent role in DNA maintenance or chromosome
dynamics. It is critical to distinguish these pathways
because a role for centrin in DNA recombination and
repair has been documented in plants [15]. Given the
close phylogenetic relation between green algae like
Chlamydomonas and green plants, the involvement of centrin in recombination in plants raises the real possibility
that the loss of heterozygosity observed in vfl2 might have
nothing to do with mitotic spindle function and might
instead be driven by increased recombination.
In order to determine whether genomic instability in the
vfl2 mutant is caused by increased recombination or chromosome loss, we distinguished between the two pathways
by analyzing the mating type (MT) locus, which is located
on the opposite arm of the same chromosome from ACT2
(Fig. 2). Diploid cells are heterozygous at MT and contain
both the MT+ and MT- alleles. Because the ACT2 and MT
loci are on opposite arms of the same chromosome, and
recombination only causes LOH on a single arm distal to
the crossover site, it can be inferred that only chromosome loss, and not mitotic recombination, could lead to
the simultaneous loss of both the wild-type ACT2 gene
and the MT+ allele (Fig. 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/15

We therefore tested lines that had undergone LOH at the
ACT2 locus for chromosome loss versus recombination,
by analyzing the MT locus using PCR primers specific for
the MT- and MT+ alleles [23]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, prior
to selection on cycloheximide, all wild-type and vfl2/vfl2
diploid lines were indeed diploid, as judged by the fact
that they were heterozygous at the MT locus and contained both MT+ and MT- alleles as expected for a diploid.
In wild type, of 96 independently constructed diploid
lines selected on cycloheximide, only two lines showed
concomitant loss of the MT+ allele and, therefore, chromosome loss. In contrast, of 96 cycloheximide resistant
vfl2 lines, we found that 27 had also lost the MT+ allele,
loss of which indicated that the lines had undergone chromosome loss. These chromosome loss events apparently
represent the loss of individual chromosomes rather than
an overall return to haploidy, as the cells were able to
grow on media lacking arginine and thus seemed to have
retained the two homologs of the chromosome containing the arg2/arg7 mutations used to select for diploidy (see
Methods). The difference in the proportion of LOH events
due to chromosome loss (2/96 for wild type vs. 27/96 for
vfl2) was highly significant (P < 0.00001 based on Fisher's
Exact Test). Multiplying the LOH rate by the fraction of
LOH events due to chromosome loss, we found that the
total rate of chromosome loss per cell division increased
almost 100-fold, from 3.2 × 10-5 in wild type to 2.4 × 10-3
in vfl2 mutants.
Cell death during G1 in vfl2 mutants
The fact that vfl2 mutants show increased chromosome
loss in the genetic assay described above leads to the prediction that haploid vfl2 cells should frequently produce
inviable progeny cells. This prediction follows from the
fact that all Chlamydomonas chromosomes contain essential genes, so a single chromosome loss event for any of
the 17 chromosomes should produce an inviable progeny
cell when haploid cell division are analyzed. (Note: chromosome loss did not lead to death in the experiments
described above because those assays were conducted
using diploid cells. Thus, chromosome loss led only to
monosomy rather than nullisomy.) Consistent with this
prediction, analysis of cell viability using the vital stain
phenosaffranin indicated that vfl2 cultures contain a
higher fraction of inviable cells than wild type (data not
shown).

In order to test this prediction more quantitatively, we
examined the outcomes of individual cell division events.
Synchronized cultures of haploid Chlamydomonas cells
were embedded in agarose pads under a coverslip and
imaged during G1 (as judged by time relative to the lightdark cycle and by the presence of flagella on most cells) by
phase contrast microscopy as previously described [24].
Viable cells were identified and their position marked,

and then their progeny were examined during the first G1
phase after division. Only cells that divided successfully to
give two or four progeny were scored (note that sometimes, depending on cell size at the commitment point,
Chlamydomonas cells can undergo two or three rapid division cycles during the dark phase of the circadian cycle).
As a test of the methodology, we compared outcomes of
division for wild-type cells and fla10-1 mutant cells grown
at 21°C. The fla10-1 mutation occurs in a kinesin
involved in flagellar assembly, and it has been reported
that fla10-1 mutants show an increased rate of mitotic
chromosome loss when grown at the permissive temperature [21]. If chromosome loss leads to increased production of inviable progeny, then this should be detectable in
our analysis. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4, fla10-1 cells
showed a significant increase in the fraction of divisions
producing inviable progeny.
We then applied this method to vfl2 mutant cells. As indicated in Fig. 4, we found that vfl2 showed a similar level
of inviable progeny production as was observed in fla10
and significantly higher than in wild type. The cell death
was observed during the first G1 after division and therefore did not result from a prolonged arrest or from a failure during subsequent S phase or mitosis. Dead cells were
often roughly similar in size to their live siblings, suggesting that they were initially able to grow but eventually
became inviable as they grew. In most cases the viable sibling cells retained flagella, indicating the culture had not
yet reached the first S phase (at which time flagella are
resorbed in Chlamydomonas preparatory to division), con-

firming that death occurred during G1. This cell death
during G1 is consistent with increased chromosome loss
during mitosis, which should result in death during
growth as essential gene products become depleted. We
cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the cell
death results from other defects in cell division.
In order to test whether supernumerary centrioles might
cause the elevated cell death we observed, we asked
whether the cell division defects in vfl2 correlated with the
number of centrioles present. As previously shown, the
fact that all centrioles are active as basal bodies in vfl2
mutants allows the number of centrioles to be inferred
from the number of flagella [24]. We therefore examined
the outcome of cell divisions of cells having either the correct centriole copy number (n = 2), too few centrioles
(n<2) or supernumerary centrioles (n>2). As indicated in
Fig. 4, the fractions of inviable progeny were statistically
similar for all three classes. We especially note that the
cells with supernumerary centrioles did not show an
increase in cell death after division.

Discussion
These results demonstrate that the vfl2-1 point mutation
[10] in centrin leads to increased genomic instability via
an increase in chromosome loss, suggesting that centrin
plays a role in mitotic chromosome segregation. Formally,
these results suggest that the gene encoding centrin could
act as a "housekeeper" type tumor suppressor gene, which
when mutated would predispose a cell to tumorigenesis
indirectly by increasing genomic instability.

which one or both progeny cells are inviable based on morphology. (Green) Wild type; n = 97. (Red) The fla10 mutant, previously shown to have elevated rate of chromosome loss; n = 18. Production of inviable progeny likely reflects spontaneous missegregation of chromosomes resulting in nullisomic progeny that die due to lack of essential genes. (Blue) The vfl2 mutant; n =
312. As predicted from chromosome loss measurements, this mutant shows an elevated rate of inviable progeny. (Grey) Outcomes for vfl2 mutant cells with less than two, two, or greater than two centrioles, as judged by flagellar number (numbers of
cell divisions scored: less than two centrioles, n = 105; two centrioles, n = 136; greater than two centrioles, n = 71). Cells with
supernumerary centrioles do not show an elevated rate of dead progeny production compared to cells with two or fewer
centrioles.

The mechanism by which the vfl2 mutation leads to
increased chromosome loss is unknown. The chromosome missegregation seen in the vfl2 centrin mutant is
reminiscent of the Ipl (increase in ploidy) phenotype seen
in yeast mutants defective in the yeast centrin homolog
CDC31 [25], which is presumably due to a failure to form
a mitotic spindle. By analogy with cdc31 mutants, it is
then possible that the chromosome loss in vfl2 results
from defective spindles. However, unlike in yeast where
the spindle pole body is absolutely necessary to form a
mitotic spindle, in higher eukaryotes it has been shown
that bipolar spindles can self-assemble in the absence of
centrioles or centrosomes [26]. Thus it was not obvious a
priori that a defect in a centriole-associated protein (such

as centrin) should have any effect on mitosis. Indeed, in
the specific case of the Chlamydomonas vfl2 mutant, it has
previously been reported that even though the vfl2 mutation causes centrioles to detach from the spindle poles,
the acentriolar spindles are nonetheless still bipolar [19].
On this basis it was concluded by Wright and coworkers
[19] that centrin does not play a role in mitosis. It might
therefore seem surprising that we find an increase in chromosome loss in the vfl2 mutant. However, while the ability of cells lacking centrioles or centrosomes to form
bipolar spindles is well documented, and these spindles
can be seen to undergo an apparently normal anaphase
chromosome separation [27], the question of whether
such acentriolar spindles might have an altered fidelity of

BMC Biology 2005, 3:15

chromosome segregation compared to normal spindles
has never been directly addressed. We speculate that the
chromosome missegregation we observe in the vfl2
mutant reflects a decreased effectiveness of acentriolar
spindles that self-assemble in this mutant. This would
suggest a mitotic fidelity function for centrioles, which
requires not merely the presence of centrioles in the cell,
but also their specific localization at the spindle pole.
Alternatively, the chromosome loss we observe could be a
byproduct of multipolar spindles. A small fraction (less
than 1%) of vfl2 cells have three or more centrioles that
could in theory give rise to tripolar or tetrapolar spindles.
We suspect this is not the case because only bipolar spindles have been observed in these mutants [19]. Moreover,
since centrioles are not located at spindle poles in this
mutant, it is unlikely that the number of centrioles would
have any effect on the number of spindle poles. The lack
of centrioles at the poles also rules out configurations
such as those seen during mitosis in multinucleate PtK1
cells [28], when multiple centriole pairs line up on either
side of a single metaphase plate to form a masked
multipolar spindle. Furthermore, to the extent that production of inviable cells during mitosis reflects chromosome loss, the data of Fig. 4 argue against multipolar
spindles playing a dominant role in chromosome loss
since cells containing supernumerary centrioles do not
show any increase in the rate of production of inviable
progeny cells.
It is also possible that the chromosome loss in vfl2
mutants arises through a spindle-independent
mechanism. Because centrin may be involved in nuclear
transport [13,17], it is possible that the vfl2 mutation
could cause defects in chromosome organization due to a
nuclear trafficking defect, leading indirectly to chromosome loss. We also note that disruption of centrin by
RNAi in Chlamydomonas has been reported to cause cytokinesis defects leading to binucleate cells [11]. However
such a cytokinesis defect cannot explain our results
because the LOH assay we employed selects for loss of
ACT2, rather than the presence of additional copies.
Detailed cell-biological analysis of centrin mutant cells
during division will be necessary to understand the basis
of the chromosome loss we have observed.

Methods
Heterozygous act2 diploid cells were constructed by crossing haploid strains of genotypes act2 arg7 mt- × ACT2 arg2
mt+. The arg2 and arg7 mutations are present in the same
gene but complement each other in trans, so that cells
require both alleles in order to grow in media lacking
arginine. The ACT2 and ARG2/ARG7 loci are on different
chromosomes, allowing us to distinguish loss of an individual chromosome containing ACT2 from a general
return to haploidy (based on the ability of cells to grow on
media lacking arginine).
We inoculated act2 heterozygous diploid cultures in nonselective media at an average density of 1 cell per culture,
and, after growth, plated them on media containing
cycloheximide. We then calculated the rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at ACT2 from the number of resistant
cells and the number of cell divisions following the initial
inoculation (determined from viable cell counts obtained
by serial dilution) using the fluctuation test method of
Luria and Delbrück [29].

Conclusion
We have found that a mutation in the centriole-associated
protein centrin, which causes affected cells to form acentriolar spindles and lack centrin-based fibers, produces an
increase in genomic instability caused by an increase in
the rate of chromosome loss. These results indicate that
either centrioles or the centrin protein itself are involved
in increasing the fidelity of mitotic chromosome
segregation.
