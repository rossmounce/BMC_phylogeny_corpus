Digital gene expression tag profiling of bat
digits provides robust candidates contributing
to wing formation

Abstract
Background: As the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing - consisting of four elongated digits
(digits II-V) connected by membranes - to power their flight. In addition to the elongated digits II-V, the forelimb
contains one shorter digit (digit I) that is morphologically similar to the hindlimb digits. Here, we capitalized on the
morphological variation among the bat forelimb digits to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying digit
elongation and wing formation. Using next generation sequencing technology, we performed digital gene
expression tag profiling (DGE-tag profiling) of developing digits in a pooled sample of two Myotis ricketti and
validated our sequencing results using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of gene expression in the developing
digits of two Hipposideros armiger.
Results: Among hundreds of genes exhibiting significant differences in expression between the short and long
digits, we highlight 14 genes most related to digit elongation. These genes include two Tbx genes (Tbx3 and
Tbx15), five BMP pathway genes (Bmp3, RGMB, Smad1, Smad4 and Nog), four Homeobox genes (Hoxd8, Hoxd9,
Hoxa1 and Satb1), and three other genes (Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2) related to digit malformations or cell
proliferation. In addition, our results suggest that Tbx4 and Pitx2 contribute to the morphological similarity and five
genes (Acta1, Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1) contribute to the functional similarity between the thumb and
hindlimb digits.
Conclusions: Results of this study not only implicate many developmental genes as robust candidates underlying
digit elongation and wing formation in bats, but also provide a better understanding of the genes involved in
autopodial development in general.

Background
Bats are a speciose group which constitute approximately 20% of extant mammals, and are the only mammalian group that have powered flight [1]. Unlike the
bird wing, made up of an elongated radius and ulna and
modified wrist and hand bones that support the flight
feathers, bat wings are primarily shaped by elongated
digits (digits II-V) that support the wing membranes or
dactylopatagia (Figure 1A) [2]. This digit elongation is
extreme. For their body length, bats have the longest
relative digit lengths with the longest digit (digit III)
exceeding the length of the body. However, not all of

the forelimb digits are elongated, digit I - the thumb maintains a short morphology similar to the hindlimb
digits and is used to grasp surface or move on the
ground (Figure 1). This unique morphology of the bat
forelimb digits has sparked interest and motivated investigation by many developmental and evolutionary biologists. Despite these efforts, the mechanisms underlying
development of these two distinct digit morphologies
(i.e., short and long) of the bat hand remains unresolved.
In this study, we capitalize on variation in digit development morphology within the forelimb and between the
fore- and hindlimb in bats to identify candidate genes
associated with development of distinct digit morphologies. Using DGE-tag profiling (described below) of the
thumb, the elongated forelimb digits and the hindlimb
digits we identified 14 candidate genes likely associated

with digit elongation and seven candidate genes likely
associated with the morphological and functional similarity between the thumb and hindlimb digits.
Elongation of the posterior digits (digits II-V) in the
bat forelimb is initiated at an early stage when digit
anlagen initially appear, embryonic Stage 15 [3]. By
embryonic Stage 17, the elongation becomes obvious
with lengthening of forelimb digits II-V greatly exceeding that of the thumb and hindlimb digits [3,4]. This
rapid elongation of the posterior forelimb digits is
thought to results from modification in expression of
key developmental genes [5,6]. In fact, several experimental and empirical studies have found differences in
expression of limb and digit associated genes between
mouse and bat autopodia. First, a mouse transgenic
experiment that replaced an enhancer of the mouse
Prx1 - a transcription factor that regulates long bone
growth in mouse - with the orthologous putative enhancer sequence from a bat resulted first in an increase in

Prx1 expression and second in a small, but significant
elongation of the mouse forelimb digits [7,8]. Second,
Shh, a key factor in limb development, exhibits a unique
second phase of signaling late in development of the bat
wing that is not present in the development mouse
autopodia [9]. Next, other developmental genes including Fgf8 and Bmp2/4 are up regulated in bat forelimb
digits compared to bat hindlimb or mouse digits [10,11].
Finally, the distribution Hoxd13 expression is more posteriorly restricted in the bat forelimb relative to mouse
fore- and hindlimbs and bat hindlimbs during late
embryonic stages [12,13]. While these results indicate
that differences in expression of Hoxd13, Fgf8, Bmp2/4
and Prx1 during forelimb digit development may contribute to bat digit elongation, the complex developmental
changes required to generate the bat wing likely require
numerous molecular changes [6]. Thus, further examinations of gene expression during development of the
bat digits are critical to identify the genes associated

with digit elongation in the posterior forelimb digits and
those responsible for the morphological and functional
similarities between the short thumb and hindlimb
digits.
Here, using a DGE-tag profiling approach, we compared patterns of gene expression among three cDNA
libraries formed from distinct regions of the fetal autopodia (the thumb, the four posterior forelimb digits and
the all five hindlimb digits) in Rickett’s big-footed bat,
Myotis ricketti. The method of DGE-tag profiling combines the SAGE principle with the massively parallel
sequencing technology to study genome-wide gene
expression profiles [14]. DGE-tag profiling has three
main advantages compared to the conventional microarray technology. First, it is high-throughput sequencing.
As a result, data from a single lane of a flow cell (consisting of eight lanes allowing for eight samples) is
enough to analyze of genome wide gene expression
including weakly expressed genes which cannot be
assessed using microarray [15-17]. Next, this type of
sequencing data is highly replicable and accurate such
that technical replicates have little variation [16]. Finally,
sequencing can be performed without a priori sequence
information, which is required in microarrays [17].
These features of DGE-tag profiling aided our identification of genes associated with digit morphology in bats.
Overall, our examination of differentially expressed
genes revealed candidate genes associated with both
digit elongation as well as morphological and functional
similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits.
Finally, our results revealed genes associated with digit
position in both limbs.

Results
Specimen features

All fetuses obtained were in the “Fetal Stage” which is
the last prenatal stage according to bat embryonic staging systems [3]. At this stage, the overall appearance of
the embryo is similar to the former stages, but the body
size as well as the digit length increases rapidly [3,18].
The genital tubercle had become a vagina or a penis
allowing determination of specimen sex. All the specimens used in this study had relatively weak pigmentation indicating an early Fetal Stage as overall body
pigmentation increases as fetal development progresses
[3,18]. Claws were sharp and keratinized in the thumb
and hindlimb digits. Crown rump length (CRL) and
forearm length (FA) for both species were recorded in
Table 1.

Foot, respectively. Library Hand DI contains 375701
distinct tags, Library Hand DII-V contains 483043, and
Library Foot contains 532850. These distinct tags and
their genomic frequency as well as the raw data were
deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database with the accession number [GEO: GSE20038].
Most of the distinct tags (over 62%) appeared only
once (frequency = 1); however, a small number of distinct tags (less than 1.7%) with frequency higher than
100 made up over 63% of all the tags in all three
libraries (Additional file 1, Table S1). When sequencing depths reach 1,000,000 total tags, the number of
distinct tags discovered (especially those with frequency >1) drops dramatically in all the three libraries
(Figure 2). From that point, increasing sequence depth
results in a slow and stable accumulation of new distinct tags indicating that the sequencing has reached
saturation (Figure 2).
Differences in expression of genes among the three
libraries are indicated in Figure 3. In total, 7080, 8205
and 8967 human genes and 4742, 5666 and 6379 mouse
genes were mapped using the tags from the three
libraries Hand DI, Hand DII-V and Foot. In total, 38.5%
human genes (10490 genes) and 24.6% mouse genes
(7843 genes) were mapped using the tags from the three
libraries (Additional file 2, Table S2 and additional file
3, Table S3). Some tags mapped to human genes but
not mouse genes or vice versa.
DGE-tag profiling of marker gene expression

The expression patterns of five marker genes (Tbx5, Pitx1,
Meis2, Hoxd10 and Krt17) in the three DGE-tag profiling
libraries are consistent with previously reported patterns
of expression at embryonic earlier stages (reviewed in the
Discussion; Table 2). We found that expression of Tbx5
was significantly higher in forelimb digits than the hindlimb digits (p < 0.001) and Pitx1 expression was significantly lower in forelimb than in hindlimb digits (p <
0.001). Similarly, as expected, we found that expression of
Meis2 and Hoxd10 were significantly higher in Library
Hand DII-V relative to the other two libraries (p < 0.001)
and Krt17 was significantly lower in Library Hand DII-V
relative to the other two libraries (p < 0.001).

Differences in gene expression across the libraries

Additional files 2 and 3 list the results of DEGseq analysis for all the homologs of human (Additional file 2,

For the comparison between elongated digits and the
short digits, we found that 286 homologs of human
genes and 89 homologs of mouse genes were up regulated in Library Hand DII-V compared with other two
libraries (p < 0.001, Figure 4) and 97 homologs of
human genes and 75 homologs of mouse genes were
down regulated in Library Hand DII-V compared with
other two libraries (p < 0.001, Figure 4). For the

comparison between forelimb digits and the hindlimb
digits, we found that 187 homologs of human genes and
163 homologs of mouse genes were down regulated in
Library Foot compared with other two libraries (p <
0.001, Figure 4) and 198 homologs of human genes and
84 homologs of mouse genes were up regulated in
Library Foot compared with other two libraries (p <
0.001, Figure 4).
Among the differentially expressed genes, we found 14
genes likely related to digit elongation based on results
of previous studies (see Discussion). The expression of
Tbx3, Tbx15, Bmp3, Rgmb, Smad1, Smad4, Hoxd8,
Hoxd9, Satb1, Hoxa1, Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2 were
significantly higher in Library Hand DII-V compared
with other two libraries, and the expression of Nog was
significantly lower in Library Hand DII-V (Table 2).
Moreover, our results hightlighted 7 genes were likely
related to the morphological and functional similarity

between the thumb and the hindlimb digits. The levels
of Tbx4, Pitx2, Acta1, Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1
were significantly higher in Libraries Hand DI and Foot
than in Library Hand DII-V (Table 2).
Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

To validate the results of DGE-tag profiling, we performed RT-qPCR of 14 genes which were differentially
expressed between libraries (Table 2). All 14 genes
exhibited the same overall expression pattern using the
distinct methods (Figure 5). Meis2, Hoxd10, Tbx3,
Tbx15, Bmp3, Rgmb, Hoxa1, Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2
showed significantly higher expression in the posterior
forelimb digits (HDII-V) compared with the thumb
(HDI) and all five hindlimb digits (Foot). Krt17, Tbx4,
Acta1 and Tnnc2 showed significantly higher expression
in both the thumb (HDI) and all five hindlimb digits
(Foot) than in the posterior forelimb digits (HDII-V).

Discussion
Massively parallel sequencing is a powerful technology
enabling extensive investigation of gene expression profiles. In this study, we obtained over 16.5 million

sequences of expressed tags from three bat autopodial
libraries, including the thumb (Hand DI), the posterior
forelimb digits (Hand DII-V), and all five hindlimb digits
(Foot). Using these data, we compared gene expression
profiles among the libraries to identify candidate genes
associated with elongation of the posterior forelimb
digits (Hand DII-V). In addition, we examined gene
expression patterns associated with the short digit morphology of the thumb and hindlimb digits as well as
gene expression patterns associated with the fore- versus
the hindlimb digits. The results of DGE-tag profiling

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:619
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/619

were validated by examining gene expression in a subset
of genes using RT-qPCR.
To assess the reliability of our gene expression profiles, we first examined expression of several genes with
previously established expression patterns. We compared expression of Tbx5 and Pitx1, fore- and hindlimb
marker genes, in the forelimb and hindlimb digits
(Libraries Hand DI and Hand DII-V and Library Foot).
Consistent with previous studies, we found that expression of Tbx5 was significantly higher in the forelimb
digits and Pitx1 expression was significantly higher in
the hindlimb digits although the embryonic stages used
here are much later than those used in previous studies
[19,20]. In addition, we compared expression of Meis2
and Hoxd10 in the fore- and hindlimb digits. Previously

published microarray data revealed high levels of expression of these two genes in bat autopodia at Stages 16
and 17 [21]. We found that expression of both genes,
Meis2 and Hoxd10, remained significantly higher in
Library Hand DII-V in the Fetal Stage (Table 2). Finally,
Krt17, a gene expressed in nails and important for the
development of nails, exhibited significantly higher
expression in the thumb and hindlimb digits [22].
Because only the thumb (Hand DI) and the hindlimb
digits have claws, we would expect higher expression of
Krt17 in the thumb and hindlimb digits relative to the
posterior forelimb digits (Hand DII-V) that make up the
wing.
In addition to comparing our gene expression profiles
to genes with known expression patterns, we further

profiling, expression of 14 genes, exhibiting differences in expression among the M. ricketti libraries, were examined in two independent H. armiger
embryos using RT-qPCR. (A) Meis2; (B) Hoxd10; (C) Tbx3; (D) Tbx15; (E) Bmp3; (F) Rgmb; (G) Twist1; (H) Hoxa1; (I) Tmeff2; (J) Enpp2; (K) Krt17; (L)
Tbx4; (M) Acta1; (N) Tnnc2. The overall pattern and significance of gene expression differences among the samples were concordant using the
distinct methods and taxa. The fold changes in expression among samples were reduced in the RT-qPCR in several cases; however this difference is
not surprising given the difference in sensitivity of gene detection in the two methods. The y-axis indicates fold change in expression between the
samples - HDI, HDII-V, and Foot - using the results from RT-qPCR (dotted bars) and DGE-tag profiling (grey bars) independently. Significance of
pairwise comparisons (HDI vs. HDII-V and Foot vs. HDII-V) are indicated by the asterisks between the bars. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.

validated our results by performing RT-qPCR using 14
genes which were identified as being differentially
expressed between elongated digits and short digits in
DGE-tag profiling. With the goal of identifying genes
related to wing formation across bat taxa, we collected
samples from a different species which belongs to the
other suborder of Chiroptera (H. armiger). We selected
14 genes likely important for wing formation or for the
similarity between the thumb and foot digits (see
below). All the 14 genes exhibited the same overall
expression pattern in the RT-qPCR as in the DGE-tag
profiling (Figure 5). This finding not only provides
strong support for the DGE-tag profiling method used
in this study, but also maintenance of gene expression
patterns across these two phylogenetically distant species provides strong support for the role of these genes
in digit elongation in the posterior forelimb digits
or morphological and functional similarities between
the thumb and hindlimb digits.
Overall, comparisons of gene expression profiles
between digit morphologies and limbs identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes. Several interesting patterns have emerged from this data. Specifically,
we highlight 21 genes likely related to wing formation
or to morphological and functional similarities between
thumb and hindlimb digits (Table 2). First, we found 14
genes that are likely associated with digit elongation in
bats - two Tbx genes (Tbx3 and Tbx15), five genes from
the BMP pathway (Bmp3, Rgmb, Smad1, Smad4 and
Nog), four Homeobox genes (Hoxd8, Hoxd9, Satb1 and
Hoxa1) and three other gene (Twist1, Tmeff2 and
Enpp2) related to either digit malformation or cell proliferation. Next, we identified seven genes (Tbx4, Pitx2,
Acta1, Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1) that are likely
associated with the morphological and functional similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits. Expression patterns of these genes in the three distinct digit
libraries as well as known function of these genes are
described in detail below.
Genes associated with digit elongation

In general, Tbx3 and Tbx15 belong to T-box gene
family and are involved in skeletogenesis [23,24]. In
digit formation specifically, Tbx3 is thought to modulate posterior digit identity through Shh and BMP
signaling, and Tbx15 insufficiency causes Cousin Syndrome which includes congenital dwarfism, moderate
brachydactyly (or shortening of the digits) and leg
shortening [25-27]. Mutants of Tbx15 have reduced
bone size and changes in bone shape in the forelimb
skeleton indicating an important role in the skeletal
development of forelimbs [24].
Bmp3, Rgmb, Smad1, Smad4 and Nog are all components of the BMP pathway, a pathway critical for bone

Page 8 of 12

formation [28]. Bmp3 belongs to the transforming
growth factor-beta (TGFb) superfamily and stimulates
cell proliferation and differentiation in a concentration
dependent fashion [29]. Overexpression of Bmp3 in the
chick wing bud has be shown to result in an increase in
cell proliferation resulting in lengthening of skeletal elements [30]. Rgmb, also named as Dragon, enhances
BMP signaling by directly binding to BMP proteins
including Bmp2 [31]. Overexpression of Bmp2 and
Bmp4 in the developing chick limb leads to a dramatic
increase in the volume of cartilage elements [32]. In
addition, Bmp2/4 has been shown to be up regulated in
the bat forelimb embryonic digits relative to both mouse
forelimb digits and bat hindlimb digits [11]. This upregulation is correlated with increased rate of cartilage
proliferation [11]. Beyond up-regulation of BMPs themselves, Smad1 mediates BMP signaling. Specifically, in
its phosphorylated state Smad1 forms a complex with
Smad4 and then accumulates in the nucleus. This
SMAD complex regulates transcription of several target
genes [28]. Embryonic manipulation of Smad1 has confirmed that its expression at the phalanx-forming region
influences digit identity in the chick limb [33]. In addition, cartilage-specific knockout of Smad1 and Smad4
reduce chondrocyte proliferation and increase apoptosis
resulting in defects of limb elements in the mouse
[34,35]. While all the components of the BMP pathway
mentioned above stimulate cartilage formation, Nog is
an antagonist of BMPs and as such inhibits cartilage formation [36]. Mutations of Nog disturb the balance of
BMP signaling leading to brachydactyly [37]. Thus, our
results - exhibiting up regulation of Bmp3, Rgmb,
Smad1, Smad4 and down regulation of Nog in the elongated bat forelimb digits - suggest a role for BMP signaling in the lengthening of the posterior bat forelimb
digits.
Hoxd8, Hoxd9, Hoxa1 and Satb1 are homeobox genes
which specify the anterior-posterior axis and have been
implicated as digit identity determining genes [38].
Although Hoxd8 and Hoxd9 mainly contribute to proximal limb development and are only mildly expressed in
the developing digits, we found that Hoxd8 and Hoxd9
were highly expressed in bat wing digits II-V relative to
the thumb and hindlimb digits [39]. Our results also
indicate that the homeobox gene Satb1 and Hoxa1 were
highly expressed in bat wing digits II-V relative to the
thumb and hindlimb digits. These two genes are highly
expressed in cancer cells promoting tumor growth
[40,41]. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining expression of Satb1 and Hoxa1 in limb development
making them interesting genes for future investigation.
Similarly to Satb1 and Hoxa1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2 are
up regulated in carcinomas [42,43]. Previous study
showed Tmeff2 contributes to cell proliferation. Enpp2

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:619

which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations
can be strongly activated by Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 which
are crucial factors for digit identity and development
[44]. Finally, knowledge of the role of Twist1 and the
digit development comes from pathological studies [45].
Mutations Twist1 have been found in patients with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome which is associated with
digit malformation [45]. Overexpression of Twist1 inhibits osteoblast differentiation and prevents premature
fusion of skeletons [46].
Genes associated with similarities between the thumb
and hindlimb digits

In addition to genes related to bat digit elongation, we
found several genes that may contribute to the morphological and functional similarities between the bat
thumb and hindlimb digits. First, Tbx4 and Pitx2 are
primarily associated with hindlimb development. Tbx4
has also been shown to regulate bone size. Specifically,
in the developing mouse forelimb, overexpression of
these genes results in shortening of the forelimb skeletons [47,48]. Next, we found several genes that are likely
associated with the distinct musculature and function of
the short digits. Because the clawed thumb of bats is
used to cling to the cave while roosting and the clawed
hindlimb digits are used for hanging upside down these
digits should be richer in skeletal muscles than the elongated digits. In fact, expression of several skeletal muscle
associated genes - Acta1, Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and
Myoz1 - was significantly higher in the thumb and hindlimb digits then in the elongated posterior forelimb
digits [49].

Conclusions
Using genome-wide sequencing method we have identified many genes differentially expressed in the developing digits of the bat autopodia. Several of these genes
are highly related to digit formation and thus likely play
important roles in the development of bat wing. Our
results provide robust candidate genes for future functional tests and molecular evolution comparison with
other mammals to fully understand the mechanisms of
wing formation and the evolution of bat flight.
Methods
Animal collection and breeding

All procedures were carried out in accordance with the
Policy on the Care and Use of Animals, approved by the
Ethical Committee, East China Normal University. Myotis ricketti, Rickett’s big-footed bat, belongs to suborder
Yangochiroptera and is widely distributed in China [50].
Their feet - which are used to forage on fishes - are larger than those of other bat species (Figure 1A) [51]. As
in many species of bats, copulation in Myotis ricketti

Page 9 of 12

occurs in autumn and spermatozoa are stored in the
female’s uterus and oviducts through the winter hibernation. Ovulation and subsequent fertilization begin in
the spring with parturition occurring in summer [52].
Because gravid M. ricketti could not be found during
the summer breeding season, we capitalized on sperm
storage by females and captured 10 hibernating female
M. ricketti from a cave (39°42’N, 115°43’E) in Beijing on
February 13, 2008. In addition to Myotis ricketti, we
captured three gravid Hipposideros armiger from a cave
(30°20’N, 117°50’E) in Anhui province of China on April
24, 2009 to use for quantitative real-time PCR confirmation sequencing results. H. armiger, the great leaf-nosed
bat, belongs to the other suborder Yinpterochiroptera
and is widely distributed in subtropical and tropical
zones of Asia [53].
After capture, bats were kept in a large cage (1.2 × 1 ×
1 m) covered with wire netting allowing them to hang.
The cage was kept in a dark, temperature controlled
room. The temperature was maintained between 18 and
24°C. Water was freely available and meal worms mixed
with a powdered multivitamin and calcium tablets were
provided daily.
Specimen processing

M. ricketti in the captive colony were euthanized by
decapitation on May 28 and June 6, 2008 (Table 1).
H. armiger were euthanized on May 20, 2009 (Table 1).
Fetuses from the gravid females were put into ice cold
PBS. The thumb, the remaining forelimb digits (metacarpi, phalanges and dactylopatagium) and all five hindlimb digits (metatarsi and phalages) were dissected
from the fetuses (Figure 1B and 1C) and stored in liquid
nitrogen until use. All other components of the fetus
were fixed overnight in Bouin’s fluid, washed with several changes of 70% ethyl alcohol and stored at room
temperature. Crown rump length (CRL) and forearm
length (FA) were measured for further estimation of the
embryonic stages.
Digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE-tag profiling)

To reduce sex-specific gene expression patterns, we
pooled the samples from a male and a female fetus of
M. ricketti (Bat M1 and Bat M2 respectively, see Table 1).
Tag libraries were prepared using the DGE-Tag Profiling
for NlaIII Sample Prep kit from Illumina according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, total RNA was
extracted from forelimb digit I, forelimb digits II-V and all
five hindlimb digits using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen,
Cat. No. 15596026, US), treated with DNase I (Roche, Cat.
No. 04716728001, Germany) and converted to double
stranded cDNA using Oligo dT beads. Subsequently, the
cDNA samples were digested using the restriction enzyme
NlaIII, which recognizes and cuts the most 3’ “CATG”.

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:619
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/619

Once digested into fragments, cDNA samples were ligated
to Illumina specific adapter A, which contains a recognition site for enzyme MmeI. The Illumina specific adapter
B was ligated after MmeI digestion (Illumina, Cat. No. FC102-1005, US). Using this technique, three DGE libraries
(Libraries Hand DI, Hand DII-V and Foot) from the three
samples (Figure 1B and 1C) were constructed such that
each molecule in the library is a 21 bp tag derived from a
single transcript with Illumina specific adapters attached
to both ends. Next, the 21 bp tags were enriched using
PCR primers that anneal to the adaptors and clusters were
created on a flow cell using a Solexa Cluster Station following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, Cat. No.
FC-103-1004, US). Finally, massively parallel sequencingby-synthesis was performed on the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Image analysis, base calling, extraction of 21 bp tags,
and tag counting were performed using the Illumina pipeline. The number of times that a unique tag sequence is
detected represents the quantitative expression level of the
corresponding transcript in the tissue. The raw data,
including tag sequences and counts, were deposited in
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the
accession number [GEO: GSE20038].

on a Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System
(ABI, US). RT-qPCR for each H. armiger (Bat H1 and
H2, Table 1) was performed in duplicate. b-actin was
taken as a reference gene and it was amplified by a pair
of previously published primers [57]. We designed 14
pairs of degenerate primers to amplify 14 target genes
(Meis2, Hoxd10, Tbx3, Tbx15, Bmp3, Rgmb, Twist1,
Hoxa1, Tmeff2, Enpp2, Krt17, Tbx4, Acta1 and Tnnc2).
PCR products of each gene were ligated into a pMD®19T vector (TaKaRa, Cat. No. D102B, Japan), cloned, and
sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator kit on an ABI
3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, US). Using
the obtained sequences, we designed gene specific primers for each target gene for qPCR. 2-ΔΔCT method was
used to quantify gene expression, data are expressed as
mean ± SD [58]. Student’s t-test was performed to examine the difference of gene expression between two different samples. Sequences of forward and reverse primers
for normal PCR and RT-qPCR of each gene are shown in
additional file 4, Table S4. The partial CDS of the genes
were deposited at GenBank under accession number
HM777024 - HM777038.

Additional material
In silico analysis

We analyzed saturation of each of the three libraries by
examining the addition of new distinct tags associated
with the increase of sequencing depth (frequency = 1,
> 1 and all distinct tags). Because little gene annotation
exists for the bat genome, all distinct tags were aligned
against the well annotated NCBI human and mouse
Refseq cDNA sequences using SOAP2 [54,55]. Taking
into account the differences between species, one base
pair mismatches were allowed during the mapping of
tags to cDNA sequences. Tags that matched to more
than one gene were not used in analyzing differential
expression among the libraries. The identified cDNA
sequences were mapped to NCBI Entrez GeneID. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using
DEGseq software [56]. We compared libraries Hand
DII-V with Hand DI and Foot to identify differentially
expressed genes between elongated digits and short
digits. We also compared libraries Hand DII-V and
Hand DI with Foot to identify differentially expressed
genes between the forelimb and hindlimb digits.
