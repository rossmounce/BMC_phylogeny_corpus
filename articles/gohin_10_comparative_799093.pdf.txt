Comparative transcriptomic analysis of follicleenclosed oocyte maturational and developmental
competence acquisition in two non-mammalian
vertebrates
Maella Gohin1,2, Julien Bobe2*, Franck Chesnel1*

Abstract
Background: In vertebrates, late oogenesis is a key period during which the oocyte acquires its ability to resume
meiosis (i.e. maturational competence) and to develop, once fertilized, into a normal embryo (i.e. developmental
competence). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these key biological processes are far from being
fully understood. In order to identify key mechanisms conserved among teleosts and amphibians, we performed a
comparative analysis using ovarian tissue sampled at successive steps of the maturational competence acquisition
process in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and in the clawed toad (Xenopus laevis). Our study aimed at
identifying common differentially expressed genes during late oogenesis in both species. Using an existing
transcriptomic analysis that had previously been carried out in rainbow trout, candidate genes were selected for
subsequent quantitative PCR-based comparative analysis.
Results: Among the 1200 differentially expressed clones in rainbow trout, twenty-six candidate genes were
selected for further analysis by real-time PCR in both species during late oogenesis. Among these genes, eight had
similar expression profiles in trout and Xenopus. Six genes were down-regulated during oocyte maturation
(cyp19a1, cyp17a1, tescalcin, tfr1, cmah, hsd11b3) while two genes exhibited an opposite pattern (apoc1, star). In
order to document possibly conserved molecular mechanisms, four genes (star, cyp19a1, cyp17a1 and hsd11b3)
were further studied due to their known or suspected role in steroidogenesis after characterization of the
orthology relationships between rainbow trout and Xenopus genes. Apoc1 was also selected for further analysis
because of its reported function in cholesterol transport, which may modulate steroidogenesis by regulating
cholesterol bioavailability in the steroidogenic cells.
Conclusions: We have successfully identified orthologous genes exhibiting conserved expression profiles in the
ovarian follicle during late oogenesis in both trout and Xenopus. While some identified genes were previously
uncharacterized during Xenopus late oogenesis, the nature of these genes has pointed out molecular mechanisms
possibly conserved in amphibians and teleosts. It should also be stressed that in addition to the already suspected
importance of steroidogenesis in maturational competence acquisition, our approach has shed light on other
regulatory pathways which may be involved in maturational and developmental competence acquisitions that will
require further studies.

Background
Late oogenesis is a key period in the complex process
ultimately leading to the release of the female gamete
from the ovary. During this period, the oocyte undergoes meiotic maturation (also known as oocyte maturation), a process leading to an oocyte that will remain
arrested in metaphase II until fertilization. The ovulatory
process that allows the release of the oocyte from the
ovarian follicle also takes place during late oogenesis.
Both oocyte maturation and ovulation have been extensively studied in vertebrates [1-4]. However, other key
biological processes that also occur in the ovary during
late oogenesis have received far less attention. During
this time period, the oocyte acquires not only its ability
to resume meiosis, once hormonally stimulated, but also
its ability to develop, once fertilized, into a normal
embryo. These two processes are referred to as maturational competence acquisition and developmental competence acquisition, respectively. They both rely on
events that could occur very early in the oogenetic process. For example, the accumulation of maternallyinherited mRNAs into the oocyte that can occur very
early during oogenesis is known to support embryonic
development until the activation of the zygotic genome
[2,5,6]. It is also noteworthy that oocyte-somatic cell
interactions and communications participate, at least in
mammals, in the acquisition of the ability of the oocyte
to resume meiosis, to be ovulated, to be fertilized, and
to subsequently develop into a normal embryo [7].
Nevertheless, maturational and developmental competence acquisitions remain poorly understood, especially
in non-mammalian vertebrates in which available data
remain scarce. This problem is further complicated by
the large variety of ovarian development types found
among those species. In teleosts for instance, the
dynamics of follicular recruitment can be extremely
variable in comparison to what is seen in mammals [8].
It should however be stressed that amphibians and teleosts share a common ovarian follicular structure that is
also very different from the mammalian follicle in which
an antrum is formed during late folliculogenesis [2].
This common feature could suggest that conserved
mechanisms may exist among these two non-mammalian vertebrate groups. In an attempt to identify conserved molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte
development, the present study was designed to identify
common genes that are differentially expressed by the
ovarian follicles during late oogenesis in a teleost fish
and an amphibian. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) and the south-African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis) were selected because both species have significant
genomic resources and a large background in oocyte
maturation studies [9,10]. Moreover, Xenopus ovarian

Page 2 of 19

development is asynchronous and follicles of all stages
(I-VI) can be found in the same ovary at any time [11].
While this type of ovarian development can also be
found in numerous teleosts, the rainbow trout has, in
contrast, a group-synchronous ovarian development
type and all follicles of a single clutch develop simultaneously once a year [12]. Thus, we aimed at identifying
molecular mechanisms that would be conserved among
the two studied vertebrate groups despite existing differences in ovarian development types. Indeed, it should be
stressed that amphibians and teleosts share common
mechanisms such as the predominant role of progesterone or a progestin, the maturation-inducing steroid, in
the induction of meiosis resumption [10,13]. To achieve
our goal, differentially expressed genes were selected
from an existing microarray study previously carried out
in rainbow trout [14] and subsequently studied in both
species using quantitative PCR (QPCR). The comparative QPCR-based analysis was carried out during late
oogenesis at successive steps of maturational competence acquisition in both species. Finally, the nature of
some common molecular mechanisms was highlighted
through a deeper analysis of specific genes encoding
proteins with known or suspected functions in
steroidogenesis.

Results
Candidate genes selection

In a previous study, a microarray analysis was carried
out during rainbow trout late oogenesis [14] and data
subsequently deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus
database (GEO Series accession number GSE4871). This
existing dataset was reanalyzed and used to select candidate genes for the QPCR-based comparative analysis
carried out hereafter. A Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) procedure with a false discovery rate (FDR)
of 5% was performed in the present study and resulted
in the identification of 1200 differentially expressed
genes (Fig. 1A). The clustering analysis of these 1200
clones resulted in the identification of two major clusters of genes. The first cluster contained 891 clones that
were down-regulated throughout post-vitellogenesis and
oocyte maturation. In contrast, the second cluster contained 309 clones that were up-regulated during oocyte
maturation. Among the 1200 differentially expressed
genes, 88% were annotated with at least one GO biological process term (Table 1). Among the most enriched
biological processes associated with cluster 1 genes, several ones appeared to be involved in DNA/RNA metabolism and post-translational modifications [see
Additional file 1]. When considering cluster 2 genes, the
enrichment analysis brought up biological processes
involved in the regulation of transcription, cell cycle

Together, these functions are consistent with the various physiological processes undergone by the follicleenclosed oocyte during the preovulatory period (i.e. ovulation, fertilization and embryo development) [1].
Twenty-three genes exhibiting at least a two-fold
change in expression between late/post-vitellogenesis
and oocyte maturation were selected among the differentially expressed genes (Table 2) for the QPCR-based
comparative analysis. In addition, three genes (11b 3hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase hsd11b3, the connexin
cx32.2 and the transcription factor etv5) that exhibited a
lower differential expression were also kept for further
analysis based on their putative role in oocyte maturational and developmental competence acquisition
[15,16]. A total of 26 genes was thus kept for further
QPCR-based comparative analysis (Table 2). Xenopus
sequences were identified by a reciprocal best blast hit
strategy using the rainbow trout sequence as a query.
Accession number and symbol of Xenopus genes are
also shown in table 2. These genes are involved in different cellular functions such as metabolic processes,
trafficking, proteolysis, transcription, cell cycle, and
post-translational protein modifications.

process term are indicated. Clusters 1 and 2 correspond to the gene clusters
presented in fig. 1.

In rainbow trout, a differential expression was demonstrated for 24 genes out of 26 (Fig. 2). For those 24
genes, the expression ratios calculated from QPCR and
microarray data are consistent even if some limited differences exist, mostly due to the underestimation of
highest differential expression by nylon array technology
(Table 2). Six genes belonging to cluster 1 (cyp19a1a,
cyp17a1, tescalcin, tfr1, cmah, hsd11b3) showed a
decreased expression during maturation. Eighteen genes
belonging to cluster 2 exhibited an increased mRNA
expression throughout late oogenesis. These genes are
mostly related to proteolysis, regulation of transcription,
cell cycle and cellular junctions. Contrarily to the results
of the microarray analysis, two genes (rbm39a and
rgs18) showed a stable expression profile throughout
late oogenesis. In Xenopus, 24 among the 26 assayed
genes were down-regulated during late vitellogenesis
and/or maturation whereas only 2 genes (the apolipoprotein apoC1, and the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory
protein star-A) showed a sharp increase of mRNA
expression during late vitellogenesis or at the time of
oocyte maturation, respectively (Fig. 2). In summary,
eight genes shared similar expression profiles in both
rainbow trout and Xenopus during late oogenesis.
Among these genes, six were down-regulated during
oocyte maturation (cyp19a1a, cyp17a1, tescalcin, tfr1,
cmah, hsd11b3) while two exhibited an opposite pattern
(apoc1, star).

Characterization of genes with known or suspected
functions in steroidogenesis

Among the eight genes exhibiting similar expression
profiles in both species, four genes encode proteins with
known or suspected functions in steroidogenesis and
were further studied here. In addition, the apolipoprotein C1 (apoC1) may also be linked to steroidogenesis as
the cholesterol necessary for ovarian steroidogenesis
may come either from de novo synthesis or from lipoprotein cholesterol uptake. ApoC1 was therefore selected
for further analysis. In vertebrates, including rainbow
trout and Xenopus, the orthology relationships of cytochrome P450 19A1 (cyp19a1) and STeroidogenic Acute
Regulatory protein (star) are well characterized [17-20]
(although star-A is the Xenopus official symbol, we will
use star hereafter for both trout and Xenopus genes for
clarity reason). In contrast, Xenopus orthologs of
cyp17a1, hsd11b3 and apoC1 had not been previously
identified clearly. We thus performed specific phylogenetic analyses that are reported in additional files 3, 4
and 5 for cyp17a1, hsd11b3 and apoC1 respectively, to
demonstrate orthology relationships between rainbow
trout and Xenopus sequences.
The rainbow trout and Xenopus Cyp17a1 protein
sequences exhibit 47% overall sequence identity with the
cognate human protein. The rainbow trout Cyp17a1
protein sequence exhibits 61% sequence identity with
cyp17a1 Xenopus sequence (Fig. 3). Three conserved
domains have been characterized [21]. The domain I is
composed of a heme-binding domain [22] and displays
71% of identity between human and trout sequences,
and 79% of identity between trout and Xenopus
sequences. The domain II is a conserved tridecapeptide,
with a putative steroid-binding domain [23]. This
domain is 77% identical between human and trout
sequences and 87% between trout and Xenopus
sequences. The domain III has been described as a
CYP17 specific domain [21] and shows 62% of identity
between human and trout sequences and 90% of identity
between trout and Xenopus sequences. Finally, a mutation of the human ser-106 or a deletion of the three
amino acids asp-487, ser-488 and phe-489 abrogate
CYP17 activity [24,25]. Interestingly, these amino-acids
are poorly conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates.
Fish Hsd11b3 is orthologous to Xenopus, chicken and
human hsd11b3, also referred as hsd11b1-like (Additional file 4). Rainbow trout Hsd11b3 shares 49% and
47% identity with human and Xenopus proteins respectively (Fig. 4) while Xenopus and human sequences are
42% identical. Hsd11b proteins possess a superfamily
Rossmann-fold NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) binding domains
composed of a glucose/ribitol dehydrogenase domain
and a short chain dehydrogenase domain.

Finally, our phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated
the orthology relationship of rainbow trout and Xenopus
ApoC1 genes [see Additional file 5]. At the amino acid
level, rainbow trout and Xenopus sequences share 36%
of identity. The trout sequence is 23% identical to the
human protein, while Xenopus sequence is 29% identical
to the human protein (Fig. 5).
Ovarian expression and tissue distribution of star in
rainbow trout and Xenopus

Star mRNA expression shows a progressive increase
during late and/or post-vitellogenesis and a sharp
increase during maturation in both species (Fig. 6A and
6B). In rainbow trout, star mRNA abundance is two
times higher during post-vitellogenesis than during late
vitellogenesis and six times higher during maturation
than during late vitellogenesis. In Xenopus laevis, star
mRNA abundance is four times higher at prophase I of
stage VI and 40 times higher at metaphase II of stage
VI, when compared to stage IV follicles. Tissue analysis
revealed a predominant expression in gonads of trout
and Xenopus (Fig. 6C and 6D). The expression of star in
Xenopus testis was 60 times higher than in ovary. In
contrast, expression of star in trout testis was six times
lower than in ovary. Low expression levels were also evidenced in trout intestine and to a less extent in other
tissues. Star mRNA expression was also detected in
Xenopus stomach.
Ovarian expression and tissue distribution of aromatase
in rainbow trout and Xenopus

The cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a for trout
and p450-arom-A for Xenopus) expression shows a dramatic decrease during late oogenesis in both species
(Fig. 7A and 7B). The transcript thus becomes barely
detectable in matured follicles of both species. Tissue
expression analysis confirms an ovarian-specific expression of the gonad gene (cyp19a1a) for trout (Fig. 7C)
with no transcript evidenced in brain. When using primers that do not discriminate ovarian and cerebral aromatase mRNAs, we detected expression of aromatase
mainly in Xenopus brain and ovary (Fig. 7D). The higher
expression was detected in the brain and a weaker
expression of aromatase mRNA was detected in testis,
stomach and intestine.
Ovarian expression and tissue distribution of cyp17a1 in
rainbow trout and Xenopus

cyp17a1 expression decreased from late and/or postvitellogenesis to the completion of oocyte maturation in
both species, but in a slightly different manner (Fig. 8A
and 8B). In trout, a significant four time reduction was
evidenced only during maturation even if the decrease
was initiated earlier, by the end of vitellogenesis. On the
other hand, Xenopus cyp17a1 expression decreased significantly during late/post-vitellogenesis as shown by the

IV to stage VI. Then, the decrease of cyp17a1 was less
important and not significantly different in follicles during oocyte progression from prophase I to metaphase II
of meiosis. Tissue analyses showed that its expression
was restricted to gonads in both species (Fig. 8C and
8D).
Ovarian expression and tissue distribution of hsd11b3 in
rainbow trout and Xenopus

hsd11b3 is nearly three-times less expressed during
maturation than during late vitellogenesis in both trout
and Xenopus (Fig. 9A and 9B). In trout, hsd11b3

expression significantly decreased at the time of oocyte
maturation like in Xenopus. In the amphibian, the transcript reduction was already visible during late vitellogenesis but was not significant because of variable
hsd11b3 mRNA levels measured in Xenopus stage IV
follicles from different females. In contrast to the other
three gene candidates analyzed above, hsd11b3 was
expressed in a more ubiquitous fashion (Fig. 9C and
9D). In trout and Xenopus, hsd11b3 was expressed in
brain and intestine. Trout skin mRNA abundance was
nine times higher than in the ovary, while no expression
of hsd11b3 was detected in Xenopus skin. Moreover no

Discussion

ApoC1 mRNA level is four times more expressed during
post-vitellogenesis than during late vitellogenesis in
trout and Xenopus (Fig. 10A and 10B). Moreover, apoC1
expression increases dramatically during oocyte maturation in trout, while its expression slightly decreases during maturation in Xenopus but remains nearly three
times higher than during late vitellogenesis. In trout and

one species followed by a subsequent QPCR study in
both species is relevant for the identification of orthologous genes that possibly participate in conserved molecular mechanisms among the two species. Among the
eight genes exhibiting similar profiles in both species,
five genes could be linked directly or indirectly to steroidogenesis, thus pointing out steroidogenic-related
mechanisms as being possibly well conserved among
fish and amphibians. Although gene expression of star,
cyp19a1a and cyp17a1 have already been described in
trout during late oogenesis [14,26,27], none of these
genes have been described at the mRNA level during
this period in Xenopus. Moreover no expression data
regarding Hsd11b3 and apoC1 are available in any of
the studied species. Due to the predominant role of sex
steroids in the control of the reproductive process in teleosts and amphibians [2,10], these 5 genes were further
studied in the present study.
While our approach has been successful, it should
however be pointed out that a significant number of

genes over-expressed during maturation in trout did not
exhibit a similar pattern in Xenopus. These differences
could be due to species-specific differences or even correspond to non-conserved mechanisms. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy between trout and
Xenopus is that in the present study, trout oocyte
maturation occurred naturally in vivo. In contrast, Xenopus oocyte maturation was triggered in vitro by a 15-h
incubation of isolated fully-grown follicles in medium
supplemented with human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG). It is thus possible that the in vitro conditions did
not trigger all the mechanisms that are naturally occurring in the preovulatory follicle, especially those involved
in ovulation. Indeed, even if Xenopus injection of heterologous gonadotropin can lead to in vivo Xenopus
oocyte maturation and ovulation [28], these processes
can sometimes be uncoupled in vitro [29]. This could
explain, in part, our results.
Finally, in order to identify Xenopus genes related to
the trout candidates we used, as a high throughput

approach, a best blast hit strategy. The orthology relationships between trout and Xenopus cognate proteins
were then validated only for the five candidates that we
subsequently analyzed. Thus, we cannot totally rule out
that a part of the discrepancy between trout and Xenopus profiles could be due to a misidentification of true
orthologs in Xenopus. This is especially true for
adam8a, adam22, foxo5 and etv5 genes that will require
detailed phylogenic analyses.
Candidate gene analysis
Star. STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein

(Star) is involved in cholesterol shuttling across the
mitochondrial membrane and its synthesis appears to be
a limiting step in steroidogenesis [30-34]. In the present
study, star was shown to be predominantly expressed in
rainbow trout and Xenopus gonads. These results are in
agreement with existing data in various vertebrates
including teleosts [19,20,33]. Low expression levels were
also detected in trout intestine and in Xenopus stomach.
Although star expression has already been reported in
rainbow trout intestine [19], no expression has been evidenced in digestive tract in any other species. While the
over-expression during follicular maturation was previously documented in rainbow trout [19,26], we showed
for the first time that star is also over-expressed during
hCG-induced oocyte maturation in Xenopus.

Interestingly, star expression is induced in response to
gonadotropin stimulation in mammals and birds
[30,35-38]. As oocyte maturation is induced in response
to LH (Luteinizing Hormone) stimulation in fish and
amphibians [2], it is likely that the strong star mRNA
over-expression reported here in trout and Xenopus is
also triggered by LH-mediated signaling pathway(s). In
rainbow trout, it is also noteworthy that the circulating
levels of the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS) detected
during the preovulatory period [39] increase concomitantly with star mRNA levels. Likewise, in Xenopus laevis, progesterone and testosterone secretions are more
important in stage VI follicles compared to stage IV follicles in agreement with star increased expression
observed in this study [40]. Together, these results point
out the over expression of star by gonadotropin during
oocyte maturation as a possible conserved mechanism
among non-mammalian vertebrates and possibly all vertebrates. The nature of the corresponding protein
emphasizes the importance of steroidogenesis in the
control of late oogenesis in non-mammalian vertebrates.
Aromatase

Aromatase is an enzyme (CYP19; EC 1.14.14.1) that
converts androgens to estrogens. In most species including humans, chicken, Xenopus and a cartilaginous fish, a
single gene has been isolated [41-44]. In contrast, in

most teleosts, two genes, cyp19a1a (also referred as
cyp19a or cyp19a1) and cyp19a1b (also referred as
cyp19b or cyp19a2), encode distinct proteins predominantly expressed in the ovary and the brain, respectively
[17,45-47]. In the present study, we show that cyp19a1a
is only expressed in trout ovary, while p450arom-A is
expressed mainly in Xenopus gonads and brain. The
lack of cyp19a1a expression in rainbow trout brain is
somewhat surprising as cyp19a1a has previously been
detected in brain of various fish species [46-49]. The
lack of expression of cyp19a1a in trout testis is, in contrast, in agreement with a previous study carried out in
zebrafish [46]. In our study, a weak expression of aromatase was detected in Xenopus testis. This observation
is consistent with a previous study reporting a weak
expression but no aromatase activity in Xenopus laevis
adult testis [50]. In Xenopus, we evidenced a very low
expression in intestine and stomach, thus corroborating
studies in human fetus which showed an aromatase
expression in intestine [51,52].
The cytochrome P450 aromatase expression decreases
dramatically during late oogenesis in both Xenopus and
trout resulting in a barely detectable aromatase expression during maturation. Previous studies already indicated a decrease of aromatase expression [14,53-57] and

activity [58] as well as a reduction of circulating E2
levels [26,27,39,59] throughout late oogenesis in several
fish species. However, we report here for the first time
that aromatase transcript expression decreases dramatically in Xenopus post-vitellogenic, immature, follicles
throughout late oogenesis. This observation is consistent
with the decrease of aromatase and E2 production by
the ovarian follicle during the post-vitellogenic period
[40,60]. Together, these observations suggest that the
drop of aromatase mRNA expression in the late oogenetic follicle is possibly a conserved molecular mechanism among non-mammalian vertebrates. In addition,
existing data on the inhibition of oocyte maturation by
E2 obtained in fish [61] as well as in another amphibian,
Rana pipiens [62,63] suggest that this mechanism of
inhibition of precocious meiosis resumption could contribute to oocyte maturational competence acquisition
in non-mammalian vertebrates.
Cyp17a1

The cytochrome P450 17A1, for which the official symbol is cyp17a1 is a member of the large superfamily of
cytochrome P450. This enzyme (CYP17A1; EC =
1.14.99.9) acts as a 17a-hydroxylase and a 17-20-lyase.
The 17a-hydroxylase activity converts progesterone
and pregnenolone to 17a-hydroxyprogesterone and

Gohin et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/18

17a-hydroxypregnenolone, respectively while the 17,20lyase activity converts 17a-hydroxypregnenolone to
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione. DHEA and androstenedione are precursors of testosterone and estrogen
synthesis while 17a-hydroxyprogesterone is a precursor
of different progestins and cortisol. In teleosts, two
genes have been identified [64]: Cyp17a1 (previously
referred as P450-I) and cyp17a2 (previously referred as
P450-II). Cyp17a1 encodes a protein exhibiting both
activities, as in other vertebrates, whereas cyp17a2
encodes a protein lacking 17,20 lyase activity.
Cyp17a1 is expressed in the gonads of both species,
consistently with previous data in mammals [65], birds
[66], and fish [67,68], including rainbow trout
[26,27,69,70] but reported here for the first time in an
amphibian species. In a previous study, a strong mRNA
expression was also reported in rainbow trout kidney
[70]. These authors also detected a low expression in
various tissues using semi-quantitative RT-PCR that we
were not able to confirm in the present work using
QPCR. In both species, ovarian mRNA levels decrease
dramatically throughout late oogenesis. In rainbow
trout, the cyp17a1 profile was previously been documented [26,27] and found to be consistent with previous
Northern blot data indicating that cyp17a1 was abundant in the post-vitellogenic ovary as a result of an
increase of expression that occurred during vitellogenesis [69]. Moreover, it has been shown in tilapia that
cyp17a1 expression in granulosa cells decreases during
late oogenesis, while cyp17a2 expression increases [64].
It should be however noticed that cyp17a1 expression
during late oogenesis can be variable depending on the
species [67,71]. Nevertheless, a low cyp17a1 mRNA
expression was also reported in female fat head minnow
close to full sexual maturity [68] and in two catfish
populations, cyp17 mRNA level was shown to decrease
throughout the period of spawning [55]. In rat, both
cyp17a1 mRNA and protein abundance increase
throughout folliculogenesis and subsequently decrease
after hCG stimulation of preovulatory follicles [72].
Similarly, cyp17a1 mRNA expression decreased after LH
surge in bovine preovulatory follicles [73]. Consistent
with these observations was the report of a decrease of
cyp17a1 mRNA expression in follicular layers of the
preovulatory chicken follicles [56,74]. Together, existing
and present observations suggest that even though species-specificity may exist, the decrease of cyp17a1
mRNA expression towards the end of oogenesis may be
a well conserved molecular mechanism, possibly related
to maturational competence acquisition. Indeed,
Cyp17a1 could participate in the shift from E2 to
maturation-inducing steroid production observed in fish
and amphibians during late oogenesis [40,75]. In

Page 13 of 19

addition, Cyp17a1 could also participate in the production of androgens that have been evidenced to play
important roles during late oogenesis in both amphibians and fish [76-78].
Hsd11b3

The 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzymes
HSD11B mainly catalyze the interconversion of active
glucocorticoid (cortisol and corticosterone) and inactive
11-keto forms (cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone)
[79]. Three proteins have been described in mammals:
HSD11B1, HSD11B2 and HSD11B3 (previously known
as HSD11B1like or HSD11B1L). Previous analyses have
indicated that hsd11b1 was not present in teleost species
[80] and could only be found in amphibians, birds and
mammals. In fish, Hsd11b2 has been characterized and
shown to be expressed in various tissues such as gill,
heart, intestine, ovary, testis and skin [79] and studied
in more details in the ovary during late oogenesis
[79,81]. Interestingly, hsd11b3 was phylogenetically characterized [80] but no expression data was available to
date in fish and amphibians. In the present study, we
show that hsd11b3 mRNA is expressed in a large number of tissues but not in Xenopus skin while it is
expressed mainly in brain, skin and intestine in trout.
Thus, rainbow trout hsd11b3 mRNA appears to have a
more restricted tissue distribution than hsd11b2 and tissue expression differs greatly between trout and Xenopus. Within the ovary, we evidence a decrease of
hsd11b3 transcript level throughout late oogenesis in
both rainbow trout and Xenopus whereas hsd11b2
mRNA has been reported to accumulate at the same
time in trout female gonad [79,81].
At the functional level, HSD11B2 acts in mammals as
a reductase and converts inactive cortisone to active
cortisol. In fish, this isoform is also able to convert 11b
hydroxy-testosterone into 11keto-testosterone (11-KT),
which has been shown to be a major androgen steroid
in fish [82]. In contrast, mammalian HSD11B1 predominantly acts in an opposite way, as likely does HSD11B3
according to the evolutionary history of the protein [80],
since no functional study has been reported on this isoform. Likewise, fish Hsd11b3 is likely to act as the mammalian HSD11B1 and/or HSD11B3 (Additional file 4).
Together, the expression profiles of hsd11b2 [79,81] and
hsd11b3 (present results) in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovary suggest a combined role of these enzymes in
gonad protection against any deleterious effect of stressinduced cortisol. Despite the lack of data on glucocorticoid levels and effects during oogenesis in amphibians,
we may also hypothesize a similar role of Hsd11b3 during Xenopus late oogenesis. We cannot totally rule out a
role of Hsd11b3 in regulating 11 ketotestosterone levels
during follicular development and oocyte growth.
Indeed, 11KT, besides its well-known action in fish

Gohin et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/18

spermatogenesis, has been demonstrated as controlling
oocyte growth, likely through lipid accumulation in eel
[83] and in atlantic cod [84]. However, this cannot be
extended to all teleosts as 11KT circulating levels are
low or even undetectable in salmonid females [85-87].
Further investigations including protein expression and
enzyme activity measurements are thus required to conclude on the exact physiological role(s) of these 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzymes in ovarian
functions during late oogenesis.
ApoC1

The apolipoprotein C1 belongs to the family of soluble
apolipoproteins involved in cholesterol transport and
uptake in vertebrates [88]. Interestingly, in vitro studies
have also suggested that apoC1 could stimulate lecithincholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity [89], thereby
increasing the formation of esterified cholesterol as well
as estradiol ester. In the present study, the tissue expression analysis reveals that apoC1 is primarily expressed in
trout and Xenopus liver, but also in stomach, intestine
and gonad. This result is consistent with previous studies
performed in mammals [90-92] and in another teleost,
Hemibarbus mylodon [93]. Only in the orange-spotted
grouper, apoC1 could not be detected in the liver but it
was nonetheless expressed in gonad and in brain [94].
Within the ovary, we show that apoC1 mRNA levels
dramatically increase during late oogenesis in trout and
Xenopus. This result confirms previous findings in trout
[14] and in orange-spotted grouper [94]; only Tingaudsequeira et al. recently published in a marine flatfish
ovary a different pattern of apoC1 expression, where its
transcript levels significantly increase solely during follicle atresia following ovulation but not during follicle
growth or maturation [95]. This study is also the first
report on apoC1 expression in an amphibian. In mammals, ApoC1 expression in ovary during follicle development has not been studied to our knowledge but the
increase of LCAT activity, correlated with a decrease of
estradiol/progesterone ratio in antrum of human growing
ovarian follicles [96] may indirectly reflect an increase of
apoC1 expression. The function of ApoC1, accumulating
during late oogenesis, remains to be elucidated. First, this
apolipoprotein may have a role in remaining yolk degradation by the oocyte companion cells during follicle atresia [95] or yolk degradation as a nutrient source for early
embryo development [94]. ApoC1 could also be involved
in the regulation of steroidogenesis at least in two ways:
(i) as an inhibitor of lipoprotein uptake via inhibition of
lipoprotein binding to their receptors [97]; it may then
modulate the ovarian cholesterol uptake during oogenesis; (ii) cholestryl and estradiol esters, formed upon
LCAT activation by apoC1 [98], remain a source of
bioactive metabolites in the steroid synthesis pathways.
Interestingly, estradiol esters may also be involved in

antioxydation processes [99]. Further studies will be
required to fully understand the role(s) of ApoC1 during
ovarian follicle development in vertebrates.

Conclusions
In the present study, we successfully used a QPCRbased comparative analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed during both rainbow trout and
Xenopus late oogenesis. Our observations point out several molecular mechanisms as possibly conserved among
non-mammalian vertebrates. As an attempt to further
characterize some of these mechanisms, we have characterized the sequence of some candidate proteins and
thoroughly studied their mRNA expression in various
tissues and during post-vitellogenesis in the two studied
species. Our data show that the expression profiles of
key steroidogenic enzymes are conserved during late
oogenesis in Xenopus laevis ovarian follicles in agreement with existing data in rainbow trout. We indeed
evidenced a decrease of the mRNA levels of cyp19a1
and cyp17a1 in both species and for the first time in an
amphibian species. These expression patterns are consistent with the shift in steroidogenesis of ovarian follicles
observed in both amphibians and teleost fish prior to
meiosis resumption and could correspond to an important molecular mechanism of oocyte maturational competence acquisition common to these non-mammalian
vertebrate groups. In contrast, the levels of star mRNA
increase during oocyte maturation in both species. The
nature of Star protein further stresses the importance of
steroidogenesis in the post-vitellogenic process. The
timing of star over-expression suggests, however, that
Star would not be involved only in maturational competence acquisition but also in further follicular processes
(e.g. ovulation) possibly through an increase of maturation-inducing steroid (MIS) synthesis. In addition, the
decrease in hsd11b3 mRNA expression observed in both
species throughout late oogenesis raises the question of
the physiological role of this protein that will require
further attention. Finally, the observed increase in
apoC1 expression may be related to different mechanisms as steroidogenesis regulation through modulation
of cholesterol uptake or through regulation of cholesteryl or estradiol esters synthesis. This increased expression may also be linked to yolk processing in the oocyte
during late oogenesis or during early embryo development. The characterization of the function of this gene
during late oogenesis requires however further investigation. Finally, other genes not related to steroidogenesis
were also shown to have similar expression profiles in
both species during late oogenesis. The identity of the
proteins points out possibly conserved non-steroidogenic mechanisms that deserve future attention and specific investigations.

Together, our results strongly suggest that comparative transcriptomics is an extremely valuable approach
that must be pursued to gain insight in the conserved
mechanisms underlying maturational and developmental
competence acquisition in non-mammalian vertebrates.

Methods
Animals and Tissue Collections

Investigations and animal care were conducted in compliance with French and European regulation on the
care and use of laboratory animals. Twenty eight adult
rainbow trout females (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from an
autumn-spawning strain were obtained at different
stages of ovarian development from the INRA/PEIMA
fish farm (Sizun, France). Ovaries were sampled during
late vitellogenesis (LV, 3 or 4 weeks before expected
spawning, n = 6), in post-vitellogenesis (PV, before
oocyte maturation but during spawning period, n = 14)
and during maturation (Mat., n = 8). Thirteen of these
twenty eight females had previously been used for transcriptomic analysis [14]. For sampling, fish were deeply
anaesthetised in 0,1% (v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol in water
and killed. Trout ovaries were then dissected out of the
body cavity under sterile conditions.
Ovarian pieces were surgically removed from six
Xenopus anaesthetised adult females (Xenopus laevis),
purchased from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI, USA). 100
Xenopus stage IV (st IV, 800-μm diameter) and 50 stage
VI (st VI PI, 1200-μm diameter, in prophase I of meiosis) ovarian follicles [11] were manually isolated from
ovarian pieces of each female. In order to obtain follicleenclosed oocytes in metaphase II of meiosis (st VI MII)
from the same females, in vitro maturation was performed by incubating 50 immature stage VI follicles for
15 h at room temperature in OR2 buffer (83 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM
Na2HPO4, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 40
IU/mL of hCG (Organon, Puteaux, France). After the
incubation period, germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)
was assessed by direct observation under a stereomicroscope of the appearance of a white spot on the animal
pole of the follicle-enclosed oocytes.
For tissue collection, three Xenopus adult females were
sacrificed and different tissues (brain, heart, stomach,
liver, intestine, muscle, skin, and ovary) were collected
in addition to stage IV and VI follicles. The same tissues
were also sampled from three different post-vitellogenic
rainbow trout females. Trout testis samples were
obtained from four different males at stage II (initiation
of spermatogenesis) and stage V (spermiogenesis)
whereas Xenopus testis samples were obtained from one
male. Tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.

Microarray data analysis

Microarray data obtained from previous hybridization
[14] were further reanalyzed. The rainbow trout generic
array has been previously deposited in Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database (Platform# GPL 3650; GEO
accession GSE4871) [100]. In order to identify differentially expressed genes, a statistical analysis was carried
out using Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM)
test [101]. Three 2-by-2 statistical analyses were performed in order to compare each group with the two
other ones. For each comparison, 5% of false discovery
rate (FDR) was used to statistically discriminate differentially expressed genes. For clustering analysis, data were
log2-transformed, median-centered, and an average linkage clustering was performed using CLUSTER software.
Clusters were visualized using TREEVIEW software
[102]. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed
using the NIH-DAVID web-based tool (Database for
Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery)
[103-105]. Enrichment analyses were realized using all
the annotated genes present on the microarray (8 344
genes) as a reference and using UNIPROT accession
IDs as input. Enriched GO biological process terms
associated with each gene list were determined using
modified Fisher’s exact tests. GO terms with a raw pvalue lower than 0.05 are displayed [see additional files
1 and 2]. The number of genes associated with each GO
term and associated enrichment information (raw pvalues and fold enrichment) are indicated for each GO
term.
Data mining and sequence analysis

For all the clones identified as differentially abundant
after the SAM analysis (Table 2), the official gene symbol was retrieved [14,106,107] when possible and used
in the text, figures and tables. The official Danio rerio
gene symbol was used for the rainbow trout. Rainbow
trout cDNA clones and corresponding IMAGE Xenopus
clones were fully sequenced in both directions with the
“PRISM* Ready Reaction Big Dye* Terminator cycle
Sequencing Kit” and an automated ABI 310 sequencer
(PE Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France), as recommended
by the manufacturer. Multiple amino acid sequence
alignments were constructed using ClustalW software
[108].
Phylogenetic analysis

In order to identify orthologous genes, phylogenetic analysis of studied genes was done using the FIGENIX phylogenomic analysis pipeline [109]. FIGENIX allows
sequences retrieval, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic reconstruction and orthology and paralogy
relationships deductions. The phylogenomic task was
run using either trout or Xenopus amino acid sequence
as a query, with the default parameters, and using

Gohin et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/18

Ensembl and NCBI-nr databases with search limited to
mammals, chicken, Xenopus and fish.
RNA extraction, reverse Transcription and Real-Time PCR
analysis

RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed as previously described for rainbow trout [14].
For Xenopus, 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed
using 200 units of SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and 250 ng random
hexamers (Promega) in a reverse transcription master
mix containing 2 mM dNTPs, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 75 mM
KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.3.
Twenty-five units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega)
were added to the reaction. RNA and dNTPs were denatured for 5 min at 65°C, and then chilled on ice before
addition of reverse transcription master mix. Reverse
transcription was performed at 25°C for 10 min then at
42°C for 50 min followed by a 15-min incubation step
at 70°C. For both species, control reactions were run
without reverse transcriptase and used as negative controls in the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
study for all target genes.
QPCR was done using a real-time PCR system Step
One Plus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Reverse transcription products were diluted to 1/25 for
trout and 1/20 for Xenopus. Triplicates were run for
each RT product. Real-time PCR was performed using a
real-time PCR kit provided with a SYBR Green fluorophore (Fast SYBR Green Master Mix, Applied Biosystem). Primer concentrations were 240 nM for 18S and
600 nM for all other genes. The hot start enzyme was
activated 20 seconds at 95°C, then the amplification was
carried out using the following cycle: 95°C for 3 sec; 60°
C for 30 sec; 40 times. A pool of reverse transcribed
RNA was serially diluted and used to calculate a standard curve. For all studied genes, 18S was used as an
internal standard to normalize the signal. After amplification, a fusion curve was obtained according to the following protocol: 10 sec holding followed by a 0.05°C
increase, repeated 80 times, and starting at 55°C. Primer
sequences of studied genes are presented in supplementary data files (see additional file 6 for trout; see additional file 7 for Xenopus). The control reactions were
used to calculate background expression level for each
gene in order to evidence the tissues exhibiting expression levels significantly above background. Statistical
analyses were performed using Statistica 7.0 software
(Statsoft, Tulsa, OK). Regarding trout and Xenopus data,
differences between groups were analyzed using non
parametric U Mann-Whitney test and paired samples
Wilcoxon test, respectively.
