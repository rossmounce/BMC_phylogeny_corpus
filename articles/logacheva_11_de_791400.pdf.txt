Abstract
Background: Transcriptome sequencing data has become an integral component of modern genetics, genomics
and evolutionary biology. However, despite advances in the technologies of DNA sequencing, such data are
lacking for many groups of living organisms, in particular, many plant taxa. We present here the results of
transcriptome sequencing for two closely related plant species. These species, Fagopyrum esculentum and F.
tataricum, belong to the order Caryophyllales - a large group of flowering plants with uncertain evolutionary
relationships. F. esculentum (common buckwheat) is also an important food crop. Despite these practical and
evolutionary considerations Fagopyrum species have not been the subject of large-scale sequencing projects.
Results: Normalized cDNA corresponding to genes expressed in flowers and inflorescences of F. esculentum and F.
tataricum was sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing technology. This resulted in 267 (for F. esculentum) and
229 (F. tataricum) thousands of reads with average length of 341-349 nucleotides. De novo assembly of the reads
produced about 25 thousands of contigs for each species, with 7.5-8.2× coverage. Comparative analysis of two
transcriptomes demonstrated their overall similarity but also revealed genes that are presumably differentially
expressed. Among them are retrotransposon genes and genes involved in sugar biosynthesis and metabolism.
Thirteen single-copy genes were used for phylogenetic analysis; the resulting trees are largely consistent with
those inferred from multigenic plastid datasets. The sister relationships of the Caryophyllales and asterids now
gained high support from nuclear gene sequences.
Conclusions: 454 transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly was performed for two congeneric flowering
plant species, F. esculentum and F. tataricum. As a result, a large set of cDNA sequences that represent orthologs of
known plant genes as well as potential new genes was generated.

Background
Transcriptome sequencing is a convenient way to
rapidly obtain information on the expressed fraction of
genome. With the advent of next-generation sequencing
transcriptomic data for many species became available.
However many important taxonomic groups of living
organisms remain underrepresented. This is especially
pressing problem for plants since few of them have been
a priority for large-scale sequencing projects. The

present study aimed at filling the gap in the genomic
data for the genus Fagopyrum, a group of plants important for both practical and theoretical reasons.
Fagopyrum (buckwheat) belongs to the eudicot family
Polygonaceae. The genus Fagopyrum comprises about
17 species; one of the species, F. esculentum (common
buckwheat), is a crop and honey-producing plant widely
cultivated in several countries, in particular, Canada,
China, Japan, Russia and Ukraine. Recently, an extensive
search for the wild ancestor of the cultivated buckwheat
identified the ancestral group, called F. esculentum subspecies ancestrale [1,2]. Two more distant relatives of
the cultivated buckwheat are F. homotropicum and F.
tataricum [3]. Both of them have an important favorable

trait absent in the common buckwheat, the ability to
self-pollination (self-compatibility). Thus they have a
potential for use in breeding for the development of
self-compatible cultivars.
Despite its economic importance, molecular studies on
buckwheat are few. They are mainly confined to the
development of molecular markers based on anonymous
DNA sequences (RAPD, SSR, AFLP) and the characterization of several proteins [4-6]. Also, the molecular systematics of the genus Fagopyrum was extensively
studied using nuclear and plastid sequences [7-9], and a
complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of the
common buckwheat was reported recently [10]. These
data, however, have only limited applicability for the
buckwheat breeding and improvement. The identification of genes expressed during flower development can
enable the search for candidate genes responsible for
agriculturally important traits.
The utility of large-scale buckwheat gene sequencing
data is not limited to their potential practical applications. They will also contribute to the plant comparative
and evolutionary genomics. Not only the buckwheat, but
the entire family Polygonaceae was out of scope of
molecular genetic studies. The Polygonaceae is a middle-sized family (ca. 1000 species) characterized by several morphological features that are not typical for other
eudicots. Among them is an unusual floral structure
with flowers having a uniseriate perianth not differentiated into sepals and petals. This feature, as well as the
trimerous perianth found in several Polygonaceae genera
and considered as ancestral state for the family, is common for monocots and basal angiosperms but rarely
found in eudicots.
The genetic control of the floral development has
been well studied in several model plants, primarily Arabidopsis thaliana and some gene interactions have been
found to be conserved in a variety of species [11]. However, it is widely accepted that for understanding of the
plant morphological evolution new model systems
representing different lineages of the angiosperms
should be selected [12,13]. Given the morphological
peculiarities of Polygonaceae, Fagopyrum, and specifically, F. esculentum, a fast growing annual weed with
high seed production, is a plausible candidate for such a
system.
Many factors are important for species to be useful as a
model system, a crucial one being the availability of
genomic and transcriptomic data that enable efficient
analysis of gene structure, expression and evolution.
Until recently, such data were available only for major
model species such as A. thaliana and rice, and for several species of basal angiosperms [14]. We report characterization of genes expressed in the flower and
inflorescence of two species of buckwheat, the common

buckwheat F. esculentum and F. tataricum. This choice
was based on the reasons outlined above. One is the economical importance of F. esculentum; and F. tataricum
being a potential donor of agriculturally important traits
such as self-compatibility and resistance to environmental stresses [15] to the common buckwheat. The other
stems from the evolutionary developmental genetics
(evo-devo) considerations. These two species have contrasting floral morphology: F. esculentum has petaloid
tepals and F. tataricum has sepaloid ones (Figure 1).
Further qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the
transcriptome data may help to reveal the mechanisms
that are responsible for the morphological difference
between these species.
We expect that characterization of buckwheat transcriptomes will contribute not only to the genetics of
this genus. The order Caryophyllales is characterized by
a striking diversity of the floral structure and the perianth evolution that can hardly be explained based only
on the knowledge about classic model species [16]. Few
transcriptome datasets of the Caryophylalles are available to date [17,18]. Publicly available, annotated set of
buckwheat genes expressed in the flower and inflorescence resulting from this study will facilitate comparative and evolutionary studies within the Caryophylalles,
important for the plant evo-devo field.

Results
454 sequencing and assembly

Pyrosequencing of normalized cDNA libraries resulted
in 266782 reads for F. esculentum and 229031 for F.
tataricum with the average length of 349 and 341
nucleotides respectively. The raw data were deposited in
the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the
accession number SRA023408.
After assembly, 25435 and 25401 contigs were
obtained for F. esculentum and F. tataricum, respectively, while 56874 and 42913 reads were retained as

singletons (the sequences of contigs and singletons are
available in the Additional files 1 and 2). The average
contig length and other characteristics of the assembly
are given in Table 1 (see also Figure 2). The sequencing
coverage (estimated as the mean number of reads per
contig) was assessed as 8.2 for F. esculentum and 7.5 for
F. tataricum (Figure 2).
Since several full-length coding sequences of buckwheat
genes were available in GenBank, we used this information to assess the assembly quality by mapping the contigs onto these sequences. Of 34 available sequences of
F. esculentum, 30 were found in our assembly. In the latter, the average fraction of coding nucleotides covered by
at least one read was 73.4%; while for 11 genes the coding
sequence was covered completely (Additional file 3). This
demonstrates that the assembled contigs can be a useful
source of complete or near-complete coding sequences
for F. esculentum.
Annotation

Contig sequences were compared to the non-redundant
protein database and about two thirds of them had significant matches (see Table 2 for exact values). In both
F. esculentum and F. tataricum, the species that provided most of the top BLAST hits was Vitis vinifera
(about 7 thousands of Fagopyrum genes had the strongest similarity to V. vinifera genes). The Vitis nuclear
genome has been recently sequenced [19]. The next closest species were another plant with completely
sequenced nuclear genome, Populus trichocarpa [20],
and Ricinus communis, whose genome sequencing project is now in progress [21]. A similar taxonomic distribution of BLAST hits has been found in a transcriptome
of an asterid, Crataerostigma plantagineum [22].
For the singletons, the fraction of sequences that had
BLAST matches was lower than for the contigs (Table 2),
as expected given their smaller length [23]. The taxonomic distribution of species that provided most top hits
was the same as for the contigs.
An automatic ORF prediction revealed open reading
frames with length more than 90 bp in about 98% contigs in both buckwheat species. This length, though
being much less than the average length of proteinTable 1 Characteristics of raw data and contigs

coding sequence in plants, is higher than expected to
arise by chance (assessed by random shuffling of the
contigs with subsequent ORF prediction) suggesting that
most of the contigs correspond to protein-coding genes.
This is consistent with the method used for cDNA
synthesis, as it is based on the presence of polyA-tail on
the 3’-end of most mRNAs, the library is highly
enriched in mRNA sequences. Interestingly, most contigs that had no BLAST matches, also contained predicted ORFs with length exceeding the one expected for
a random sequence of a similar GC-content (data not
shown).
To obtain a functional annotation of the buckwheat
genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO, [24]). For both species of buckwheat, about 60% contigs were annotated.
This fraction is similar to or exceeds the annotated fraction in other recently published 454-derived transcriptomes, for example those of pine [23] and ginseng [25].
The distribution of GO categories is very similar in F.
esculentum and F. tataricum, with no categories showing significant differences between the species (Figure 3).
The contigs that had no BLASTX hits but contained an
ORF with a length exceeding 90 nucleotides were
searched against the Pfam database (e-value threshold 1).
A similar number of translated contigs had significant
match in the database for both species, 1795 for F. esculentum and 1775 for F. tataricum, with 1108 and 1156,
respectively, having a match in pfamA families. Among
the latter, about 50% (47% for F. esculentum and 50% for
F. tataricum) had hits to families containing at least one
protein from plants.
Since one of our aims was to identify genes that are
responsible for the flower development, we specifically
searched for buckwheat orthologs of genes and gene
families that are known to be involved in the flower
development in Arabidopsis. Candidate orthologs were
identified as bidirectional best BLAST hits. Such orthologs were found (in either F. esculentum or F. tataricum) for 61 out of 141 genes of Arabidopsis. Among
them were all genes controlling the floral organ identity
(ABC model genes) and some other MADS-box genes;
genes controlling stem cell maintenance (CLAVATA1,
CLAVATA2 and WUSCHEL); negative regulators of
AGAMOUS (APETALA2, LEUNIG, SEUSS, BELLRINGER); genes of the YABBY family; auxin response factors and some others (Table 3).
Since this type of search is not able to detect duplications, we performed a manual inspection of the results
of BLAST search for several gene families. For the Bclass MADS-box gene, APETALA3 (AP3), we were able
to find two highly similar sequences. The similarity
between them is lower than that expected for alleles,
with multiple indels and non-synonymous substitutions.
Thus we assume that they represent paralogs arisen

from a recent duplication. In another species from the
same family, Rumex acetosa, two genes with high similarity to AP3 were also found [26]. Hence, this duplication likely occured in the common ancestor of the
Polygonaceae.

Comparative analysis of the buckwheat transcriptomes

The contig assembly and annotation characteristics, as
well as the raw data characteristics, are similar for F.
esculentum and F. tataricum. Moreover, the data indicate that there is a strong correlation between the

number of reads constituting contigs for orthologous
genes of F. esculentum and F. tataricum (Figure 4). If a
contig of a certain gene is overlapping with a certain
number of reads, there is a high probability that the
contig of its ortholog from the other species is overlapping with a close number of reads.
We addressed the question whether these transcriptomes completely consist of orthologous genes or there
are genes expressed in one species but with orthologs
that are not represented (absent or not expressed) in the
other species. Such transcripts are plausible candidates
for the determinants of morphological differences
between the species.
To identify these putative differentially expressed genes
we first performed a bidirectional BLAST search of the F.
esculentum and F. tataricum contigs against each other.
Those contigs that had no match in the other species
(either in contigs or in singletons) were regarded as
potential differentially expressed genes (PDEGs). Starting
bidirectional BLAST search from either species, a similar
number of PDEGs was found: 4245 in F. esculentum and
4255 in F. tataricum. The PDEG fraction of both transcriptomes is enriched in contigs that have no GenBank
hits (Table 4) and GO annotations were assigned to only
1132 contigs in F. esculentum and 1588 contigs in F.
tataricum. The distribution of GO categories in both
PDEG sets is largely similar, with only few categories
being unique for either species (Additional file 4). These
categories are represented by a small number of contigs.
In most cases the number of contigs representing a

category is higher in F. tataricum - presumably, because
of higher total number of GO-annotated contigs in this
species. However, one category, “DNA metabolic process”, is represented by a considerably higher number of
contigs in F. esculentum (79) than F. tataricum (49). In
both species, the contigs from this category are almost
exclusively represented by sequences with high similarity
to retrotransposons. Thus there is strong evidence that F.
esculentum and F. tataricum differ in the number or
expression of retrotransposons.
In addition to the direct comparison of the PDEG sets,
we addressed the question whether they represent random
subsets of the overall transcriptomic datasets. To test this,
the enrichment analysis was performed, with the PDEG
set taken as a test group and the overall set taken as a
reference group (p = 0.05). No enrichment by any specific
category was found for F. tataricum; while several
categories were found to be overrepresented in the
F. esculentum PDEG set (Table 4), in particular categories
obviously related to retrotransposons (DNA integration,
RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity) and to processes
inherent to plants such as sugar metabolism, signaling and
amino acid transport.
When we observe that a certain gene in either species
is sampled by at least one read but its ortholog in the
other species is not sampled this does not necessarily
means the absence of expression of this gene in the
other species. It might be not sampled due to technical
issues related to the processing of RNA and cDNA
before sequencing. Taking this into account we performed a statistical assessment of the fraction of such
cases (false positives). Since there is a correlation
between the number of reads constituting contigs of
orthologous genes (see above), the expected number of
false positives differs for different levels of coverage.
Our analysis indicates that only about 25-30% of PDEG
indeed represent genes whose orthologs are not
expressed in the other species. For genes that are represented by a high number of reads in one species the
probability is much higher (Table 5).
Shared single-copy genes in the 454 transcriptome
assemblies and their phylogenetic analysis

Large-scale transcriptome data are a potential source of
information for multigene phylogenetic analysis (the
phylogenomic approach). To adopt its use in plant phylogenetics, Duarte et al. [27] identified a set of singlecopy genes shared between Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis
and Oryza. Only few of them were well represented in
EST assemblies across the major lineages of angiosperms. Though being quite small (13 genes), this subset
produced well-resolved tree topologies similar to those
inferred in many recent phylogenetic studies. To provide
further validation of this approach and to assess the

utility of 454 sequencing data for phylogenomics we
performed a search for the orthologs of these genes in
five 454 transcriptome assemblies. Two of them are
those reported in this study - F. tataricum and F. esculentum, the third one is from another Caryophyllales
species - Silene latifolia (sequences provided by D. A.
Filatov). Taking into account that the analysis of plastid
genes indicates on the affinity of Caryophyllales and
asterids [10,28] two recently published transcriptomes of
asterids: Craterostigma plantagineum [22] and Artemisia
annua [29] were also included in the analyses. For all

Fagopyrum_tataricum_MIRA_VER3_c5454

species almost all genes were present: 13 in Artemisia
annua, 12 in F. tataricum, Craterostigma plantagineum
and Silene latifolia and 11 in F. esculentum. For most
genes, only one sequence with high similarity to a certain gene was found thus suggesting that they are single-copy in the species sampled. The only exception is
Artemisia annua, where each of two genes - the orthologs of AT4G08230 and AT5G63135 - is represented by
two sequences with high similarity to the Arabidopsis
gene but differing one from another by multiple nucleotide substitutions and indels. We assume that these
sequences represent paralogs emerged from the recent
duplication (presumably, duplication occurred at the
level of the genus since no paralogs were found in the
transcriptomes of another species from Asteraceae).
Such «shallow paralogs» do not necessarily adversely
affect phylogenetic reconstruction [30] so they were
included in the analysis (under the names of Artemisia
annua1 and Artemisia annua2). The sequences were

added to the dataset from [27]. The resulting 73-taxon
nucleic acid sequences dataset contained 7869 characters (including gaps). The phylogeny was reconstructed
using the maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods based on both nucleotide and amino
acid sequences. As an alternative to the combined
approach a super distance matrix (SDM) analysis was
also applied (only to nucleotide sequences). The trees
resulting from MP and BI were similar to those inferred
by Duarte and coworkers [27] in topology and resolution (Figure 5). The maximum parsimony trees inferred
from both nucleotide and amino acid sequence data
were much less resolved, and much less consistent with
the current knowledge on the angiosperm phylogeny.
The Bayesian trees were well resolved, with posterior
probabilities higher than 0.5 for all nodes in the amino
acid tree and all but one in the nucleotide tree. In general, the Bayesian tree is similar to those inferred from
the analysis of several genes and from the multigene
analysis of plastid datasets [28], with Amborella trichopoda and Nuphar advena being basal among angiosperms, and monocots, eurosids and asterids resolved as
monophyletic. Nonetheless there are some points of

incongruence, primarily the position of magnoliids and
non-monophyly of eurosids I and II.
An interesting result is the position of the Caryophyllales. With the addition of Fagopyrum and Silene, the
sister relationships of the Caryophyllales gained high
support (PP = 0.96 for nucleotide data and 1 for amino
acid) in the Bayesian analysis. This is consistent with
our previous data on the plastid genome phylogeny [10],
but in the nuclear gene analysis this topology is present
as highly supported for the first time. In the dataset of
Duarte et al. [27], where the only caryophyllid species,
Beta vulgaris was present, it was also grouped with
asterids in the maximum likelihood tree but with very a
low support (< 50%).
The supertree resulting from SDM is in most points
congruent with the Bayesian trees and also supports sister relationships of the Caryophyllales and asterids
(Additional file 5).

Discussion
Utility of 454 sequencing for gene discovery in nonmodel species

Despite the economical importance of buckwheat and the
great advances in DNA sequencing technologies no
genomic data were available to date for any of the species
of Fagopyrum, with the exception of the complete chloroplast genome sequence of F. esculentum ssp. ancestrale
[10]. Prior to this study, the total number of sequences in
GenBank was 149 for F. esculentum and 121 (including
83 unannotated EST) for F. tataricum. Sequencing and
assembly of genes expressed in flower and inflorescence
presented in this study results in 25 thousand contigs for
each species. Given that the average number of genes
encoded in a plant nuclear genome is about 30 thousands
(as estimated from seven completely sequenced genomes), we assume that our dataset represents a substantial fraction of the buckwheat genes. Among them are
putative orthologs of genes that play key roles in the
flower and inflorescence development, including those
that are expressed at low level and are not widely represented in other transcriptome assemblies. These results
are highly consistent with previous experimental and
simulation-based studies [31-33] and provide further
support for the use of combination of cDNA normalization and 454 sequencing for fast transcriptome characterization in non-model species. Application of the floral
transcriptome sequence data for gene expression studies
in F. esculentum mutants with altered flower development [34-36] will constitute the basis for the study of the
genetic control of flower development in this species.
A fraction of contigs that did not produce any BLAST
hits may also be an integral part of genomic data. The
existence of such “non-blastable” sequences is reported
in virtually all plant transcriptomes characterized to

Page 11 of 17

date, with their fraction varying from about 30 to 70%
[23-25], depending on the species, the depth of sequencing and the parameters of BLAST search. There are
two major groups of effects that may be responsible for
this. The first group comprises the technical issues such
as low quality of raw data, contamination by genomic
DNA, inaccurate contig assembly and wrong choice of
search parameters (e.g. too stringent e-value cut-off).
The second group of effects, biological ones, is related
to the characteristics of the data that are inherent to the
species: the existence of non-coding cDNA fraction (primarily 5’ and 3’UTR), lineage-specific genes (i.e. genes
that are present in the genome being considered but
absent from genomes represented in the databases) and
fast-evolving genes, those that have orthologs in the
other species but with a high level of sequence divergence precluding efficient recognition of orthologs.
In our study we tried to minimize the influence of technical effects. DNAse treatment of RNA was performed
before cDNA synthesis to preclude genomic DNA contamination; also low quality data were excluded from the
assembly process. As for the assembly accuracy, in the
absence of a reference genome the possibility of assembly
errors can not be completely ruled out. However given
the relatively large length of 454-generated reads even
chimeric combination of reads corresponding to different
genes in one contig is unlikely to hamper efficient
BLAST search. Indeed, assembly errors cause problems
with similarity search only if short reads corresponding
to small and weakly conserved fragments of different
genes are combined into one contig.
Thus we assume that most of non-blastable contigs in
our data are due to biological reasons. Some of them
might indeed represent non-translated regions, but since
the average length of predicted ORF in such contigs is
significantly higher than in artificial sequences produced
by random shuffling, we suggest that most of them correspond to protein-coding sequences, either lineage specific or highly variable. Currently there are no means to
select one of these two options. Addition of more genomic and/or transcriptomic data for the Polygonaceae
and other Caryophyllales is expected to improve the
annotation and gene prediction in buckwheat.
The favourable effect of using the data from closely
related species for annotation was reported for the analysis of chestnut (Castanea, Fagaceae) transcriptomes
[32]. Several genes that could not be annotated using
the information from the Arabidopsis proteome (Castanea and Arabidopsis belong to different clades of rosids
- eurosids I and eurosids II) were successfully annotated
when compared with Populus (belonging to eurosids I)
proteome. This emphasizes that despite the availability
of large-scale sequence data for model plant species and
the increased rate of data acquisition for non-model

Logacheva et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/30

species denser taxon sampling will further improve plant
gene annotation. Given that the Caryophylalles is a
group of exceptional interest from the point of view of
evolutionary developmental biology we expect that more
transcriptomic data will be available for this group.
Comparison of two buckwheat transcriptomes: finding
potential differentially expressed genes

Gene expression is often compared within one species at
different developmental stages or in different conditions
[22,37], and several efficient tools have been developed to
analyze the enrichment in specific sets of genes (reviewed
in [38]). The interspecific comparisons are rare and confined to the cases when it is possible to use sequence
information from a phylogenetically close model species
[39,40]. The possibility to use de novo sequencing data
for the comparison of gene expression (even on the qualitative level, that is, to identify the presence or absence
of expression) in different species has, to our knowledge,
never been addressed in plant genomics.
Here we used an approach that is similar in its concept
to the digital transcriptome subtraction [41]. The latter is
based on the similarity search of sequences from one species against the other and selection of sequences that do
not have significant matches. As expected, for most
sequences from both datasets the sequences with high
similarity were found in another species, either in contigs, or in singletons. However, about four thousands
contigs in each species were found to be “speciesspecific”. It is difficult to directly associate these contigs
with the observed differences between F. esculentum and
F. tataricum, the more so because about two thirds of
them do not have significant BLAST hits in the nr database, and thus lack any functional annotation.
Still, some patterns are likely caused by species-specific
expression. Firstly, the F. esculentum PDEG set shows a
strong prevalence of contigs highly similar to retrotransposons. This suggests that either the F. esculentum genome has more retrotransposons than the genome of
F. tataricum, or more of them are expressed. The former
explanation seems to be more plausible, considering
the fact that the genome size of F. esculentum is threefold larger than that of F. tataricum [42]. While such
differences in the genome size in plants are often caused
by the polyploidy, it is not the case for the buckwheat
since both species have the same chromosome number
[42,43].
Secondly, the F. esculentum PDEG set is enriched in
genes related to the disaccharide metabolism. Monoand disaccharides, primarily glucose, fructose and
sucrose, are a major component of the F. esculentum
nectar [44]. F. tataricum, being a self-pollinated species,
does not produce nectar. So the disaccharide metabolism genes indeed might be differentially expressed due

Page 12 of 17

to the difference in the nectar production. However, any
conclusion about the differential expression should be
treated with caution and verified by more precise methods such as quantitative RT-PCR. The set of “unique”
contigs identified in our study is a mixture of genes
whose orthologs are actually not expressed in the other
species and those genes that are expressed in both species but are absent in the sequence data from one of the
species due to some random fluctuations on different
stages of RNA and cDNA processing. Indeed, our statistical analysis indicates that about 25-30% of PDEG are
really differentially expressed. One of the possible issues
responsible for this is the normalization because in normalized libraries more transcripts are represented and
thus the probability of being sequenced is lower for
each transcript than in case of non-normalized library.
The probability that a gene is expressed, given the
observations of no reads from the other genome, is proportional to its coverage. It is very low for low-covered
genes but among genes represented by a contig covered
by more than 7 at least 95% of genes are expected to be
differentially expressed (Table 5). Thus, further investigation of the genetic basis of specific differences
between F. esculentum and F. tataricum may be conducted in two ways. The first one is the survey of the
expression of PDEGs from the categories that are
enriched in either species and that are likely to have
species-specific expression for biological reasons (retrotransposons, sugar metabolism genes). The second one
is the analysis of those genes that have a high number
of reads in one transcriptome but are absent in thе
other. A combination of these approaches may provide
insights in the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms
underlying morphological and physiological differentiation in the genus Fagopyrum. Further insights, including
quantitative analysis of gene expression levels are also
expected to result from the sequencing of non-normalized cDNA. This approach demonstrated its utility on
several plant species [37,45].
Phylogenetic utility of transcriptome sequence data

Besides its potential utility for functional genetic studies,
the data from large-scale transcriptome sequencing is an
important source of information for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic studies based on transcriptome
sequences yielded well-resolved and highly supported
tree topologies for many groups of animals [46]. In
plants, however, the phylogenomic approach has been
mostly limited to plastid genome sequences [28]. There
are two reasons for that. The first one is the relative
scarcity of plant genome-scale data. Secondly, the starting point of any phylogenetic analysis, identification of
orthologous genes, is a major problem for plants due to
abundant genome-wide and small scale duplications.

Logacheva et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/30

Recently a set of single-copy genes was proposed for
phylogenetic analysis on different taxonomic level.
Though a number of articles reporting de novo plant
transcriptome sequence data were published [25,33]
none of them reported the use of these data for phylogenetic analysis. Here we attempted to validate the use
of these genes for inferring angiosperm phylogeny by
including in the analysis the data from four 454 transcriptome assemblies, with focus on Caryophyllales and
asterids. Orthologs of most of these genes were found in
all these transcriptomes. The tree inferred from the
Bayesian analysis of these genes is similar to the ML
tree from Duarte et al. [27] but has a higher resolution
and node support. We suggest the increased resolution
and node support reflects favourable effect of improved
taxon sampling.
A major problem observed in our phylogenetic trees is
the incongruence between different methods. The Bayesian inference and supertree (SDM) approach yield congruent topologies but these topologies are not congruent
with those inferred from the maximum parsimony analysis. Also, MP analysis results in a tree with very low bootstrap support values. This may indicate that the MP is
not applicable for transcriptomic data, where high variation is combined with lot of missing data. It is known
that several types of data may require additional adjustments of procedures used for phylogenetic analysis (primarily alignment). For example, for non-coding
sequences of plastid genomes special rules of alignment
were developed and this increased resolution and reliability of phylogenetic trees inferred from these sequences
[47,48]. The evolutionary peculiarities of plastid
sequences are well studied [47,49]. On the contrary, little
is known about the nuclear genes used for the phylogenetic analysis in this study. It is probable that the angiosperm-wide survey of the patterns of evolution of these
genes will identify the source of incongruence between
different methods of the analysis and, as the result,
improve their utility for plant phylogenetics.
However, even under limited taxon sampling these
genes provide valuable information on phylogenetic relationships within the angiosperms. The novel result
inferred from these data is the strong support of sister
relationships of Caryophyllales (including buckwheat) and
asterids. Earlier we have shown that these relationships are
strongly supported by the chloroplast genome sequence
data [10]. It is well known however that the results of phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast gene datasets may be misleading and thus require verification by independent data
[50,51]; the present study reports such verification for the
phylogenetic position of Caryophyllales.
The results presented here emphasize that even shallow-coverage transcriptome sequence data are an important source of information for phylogenetic applications.

Page 13 of 17

The addition of such data from various lineages of flowering plants is expected to improve greatly the resolution, support and reliability of phylogenetic trees and to
provide novel insights into the evolution of angiosperms.

Conclusions
454 pyrosequencing of normalized cDNA libraries produced a large set of cDNA sequences for two congeneric
plant species, Fagopyrum esculentum and F. tataricum.
These sequences are an important resource for the evolutionary and developmental genetics in these species
and in the order Caryophyllales. Analysis of single copy
genes derived from transcriptome sequence data have
great potential for inferring angiosperm phylogeny, especially with increased taxonomic sampling.
Methods
RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from developing inflorescences
of Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale and F. tataricum using the RNEasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) with following modifications: 50 μl of Plant RNA Isolation Aid
reagent (Ambion) and 10 μl of b-mercaptoethanol were
added to the lysis buffer RLT prior to homogenization
and the homogenization was performed without liquid
nitrogen. All other steps were performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. To avoid genomic
DNA contamination RNA was treated with RNase-free
DNase I (Qiagen). The RNA integrity was assessed by
the agarose gel electrophoresis (1% gel with addition of
SYBRGreen dye).
cDNA synthesis, amplification and normalization and 454
sequencing

Total RNA was used for double-stranded cDNA synthesis using the SMART approach [52]. To increase the
representation of weakly expressed genes, SMART-prepared amplified cDNA was then normalized using the
DSN normalization method [53]. Normalization
included cDNA denaturation/reassociation, treatment by
a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN, [54]) and amplification
of the normalized fraction. cDNA synthesis and normalization were performed by the Evrogen company, the
detailed protocols are available in Additional file 6.
The efficiency of normalization was tested by real-time
PCR. Fragments of GAPDH (a housekeeping gene
expressed at a high level) and of the WUS ortholog
(encodes a transcription factor expressed at a low level)
were amplified from the normalized and non-normalized libraries. The 32-fold decrease of GAPDH expression was observed in the normalized library. Then 7 μg
of normalized cDNA were fractionated and sequenced
using 454 GS-FLX sequencer with 454 Titanium chemistry. Sequencing was performed by The Centre for

Logacheva et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/30

Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Each sample was run on a half of a picotiter plate.
Assembly, annotation and comparative analysis of
transcriptomes

SeqClean [55] was used to remove polyA sequences
from the raw data. We did not use SeqClean to
remove adapter sequences since it works only with
100-92% identity segments and in our case adapters
contained many sequencing errors caused by the
homopolymer runs. To remove the adapters with less
than 92% identity we developed two scripts, which are
available upon request. MIRA assembler [56] version
3.0.0rc4 was used for the 454 data assembly. The
assembler was run in its ‘accurate’ mode with the
assembly type set as ‘EST’.
The resulting contigs were subject to the BLASTX
search against the non-redundant protein database (nr)
with the e-value threshold of 10-6 and the HSP length cutoff of 50, as implemented in the BLAST2Go program [57].
The ORF Predictor tool was used to identify ORFs (http://
proteomics.ysu.edu/tools/OrfPredictor.html, [58]).
Searches against the Arabidopsis proteome (e-value
threshold of 10-6) and the searches between F. esculentum
and F. tataricum (e-value of 10-15) were performed using
BLASTX/TBLASTN and BLASTN, respectively, as implemented in BioEdit 7.09 [59]. The Gene Ontology annotation [24] was done using BLAST2Go with the annotation
cut-off of 10-5. We used simplified GOSlim (plant) annotations (developed by TAIR, [60]) to select genes expressed
in the flower and in the inflorescence. For the identification of genes that are represented in the transcriptome of
one species of buckwheat but are not represented in the
other (here and further called potential differentially
expressed genes, PDEG), a Perl script was developed that
processes the BLAST output and extracts sequences that
do not have significant matches. The enrichment analysis
was performed using Fisher’s exact test as implemented in
Gossip/BLAST2Go [61]. The statistical assessment of the
number of false positives in the PDEG sets was performed
as follows. First, the probability p(i,j,s) to observe i reads
for the gene in one species (s) given j reads for its ortholog
in the other species was calculated. For each possible j and
s, the observed number of orthologous pairs with j reads
for gene in species s fitted well the Poisson model after filtering out a small number of outliers. The model parameters l(j,s) were estimated from these data using the
maximum-likelihood method, taking into account that
pairs with zero number of reads for any of the genes were
not observed for obvious reasons. Finally, the number of
false positives was calculated as Σ k(j,s) p(0,j,s) where k(j,s)
is the total number of genes with j reads in species s.

Phylogenetic analysis

For the phylogenetic analysis, a set of 13 single copy
genes from 69 taxa, from the [27] study was used. The
orthologs of these genes were found by the BLAST
search of corresponding Arabidopsis genes in three 454sequenced transcriptomic datasets of Caryophylalles, F.
esculentum, F. tataricum, and Silene latifolia (Filatov D.
A., personal communication) and two transcriptomes of
asterids: Artemisia annua [29] and Craterostigma plantagineum [22]. Since the orthologs from the two buckwheat species are highly similar (> 95%) the sequences
from only one species (F. tataricum) used. Sequences of
F. tataricum, S. latifolia, A. annua and C. plantagineum
were added to the alignment from [27] then the whole
set was checked for frameshifts and the latter, if present, were corrected by inserting N to recover in frame
translation. Sequences of transcripts were translated
into amino acid sequences by BioEdit and further
aligned using MUSCLE ver. 3.6 [62]. The nucleotide
sequence alignment was overlaid on the amino
acid sequence alignment. Gap-rich positions and positions of ambiguous alignment were excluded from analyses (789 in total). The phylogenetic analysis using the
maximum parsimony (MP) method was performed
using PAUP* ver. 4.0b8 [63]. The MP analysis involved
a heuristic search using TBR branch swapping and 500
random addition replicates. The non-parametric bootstrap analysis [64] was performed with 1000 replicates
with TBR branch swapping. The Bayesian inference of
phylogeny was explored using the MrBayes program
ver. 3.1.2 [65]. The Bayesian analysis was applied both
to the amino acid and nucleotide data with two runs
with three chains in each. Each chain started with a
random tree, 1,000,000 replicates for amino acid data
and 5,000,000 replicates for nucleotide data were generated, trees were sampled every 100 generations. The
number of discarded trees was determined using the
cold-chain log-likelihood examination. The JTT model
of amino acid substitutions was determined by the
Bayesian information criterion in Modelgenerator ver.
0.43 [66], the GTR+I+Γ model of nucleotide substitution was determined by the Akaike information criterion in Modeltest ver. 3.7 [67], the data were treated as a
single partition. As an alternative to the combined analysis a super distance matrix (SDM) method [68] was
applied. The SDM-algorithm combines the evolutionary
distances obtained from each gene into a single distance
supermatrix, therefore for each gene a corresponding
model of evolution was determined in Modeltest, then
the maximum likelihood distances according to the
selected model were computed with PAUP*. A supertree was constructed using Fitch program from PHYLIP
package [69].
