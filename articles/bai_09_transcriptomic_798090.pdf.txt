Abstract
Background: The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and its symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus
luminescens, are important biological control agents of insect pests. This nematode-bacterium-insect association represents an
emerging tripartite model for research on mutualistic and parasitic symbioses. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying these
biological processes may serve as a foundation for improving the biological control potential of the nematode-bacterium
complex. This large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis effort enables gene discovery and development of microsatellite
markers. These ESTs will also aid in the annotation of the upcoming complete genome sequence of H. bacteriophora.
Results: A total of 31,485 high quality ESTs were generated from cDNA libraries of the adult H. bacteriophora TTO1 strain.
Cluster analysis revealed the presence of 3,051 contigs and 7,835 singletons, representing 10,886 distinct EST sequences. About
72% of the distinct EST sequences had significant matches (E value < 1e-5) to proteins in GenBank's non-redundant (nr) and
Wormpep190 databases. We have identified 12 ESTs corresponding to 8 genes potentially involved in RNA interference, 22
ESTs corresponding to 14 genes potentially involved in dauer-related processes, and 51 ESTs corresponding to 27 genes
potentially involved in defense and stress responses. Comparison to ESTs and proteins of free-living nematodes led to the
identification of 554 parasitic nematode-specific ESTs in H. bacteriophora, among which are those encoding F-box-like/WDrepeat protein theromacin, Bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and PAZ domain containing protein. Gene Ontology terms were
assigned to 6,685 of the 10,886 ESTs. A total of 168 microsatellite loci were identified with primers designable for 141 loci.
Conclusion: A total of 10,886 distinct EST sequences were identified from adult H. bacteriophora cDNA libraries. BLAST
searches revealed ESTs potentially involved in parasitism, RNA interference, defense responses, stress responses, and dauerrelated processes. The putative microsatellite markers identified in H. bacteriophora ESTs will enable genetic mapping and
population genetic studies. These genomic resources provide the material base necessary for genome annotation, microarray
development, and in-depth gene functional analysis.

Background
The entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and its mutualistic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens, are important biological control agents of insect
pests [1] and represent an emerging model for research on
mutualistic and parasitic symbiosis [2,3]. The use of H.
bacteriophora as a biological control agent is hampered by
its susceptibility to environmental extremes including
temperature, desiccation, and UV radiation, differences in
virulence towards different insect pests, and short shelf
life. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying
these biological processes may serve as a foundation for
improving the biological control potential of the nematode-bacterium complex.
The entomopathogenic nematode H. bacteriophora has a
distinct life style. The infective juveniles (IJs) or dauer
juveniles (DJs) persist in soil in search of a suitable insect
host [4]. Following entry into the insect host through natural body openings and cuticle, the IJs regurgitate the symbiotic bacteria into the insect hemocoel [5]. The bacteria
kill the insect host via septicemia, usually within 24–48 h
[5]. The nematodes feed on the multiplying bacteria and
disintegrated host tissues and produce 1 to 3 generations
within the cadaver. When the food source depletes and
nematode density reaches a threshold, next-generation IJs
are formed which exit the cadaver in search of a new host
[3].
In contrast to the closely related genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans, few genomic resources are available for H.
bacteriophora. However, some progress has been made
over the past few years with the generation and analysis of
~1,000 ESTs from H. bacteriophora GPS11 strain [3,6], the
start of an H. bacteriophora complete genome sequence
project (supported by the National Human Genome
Research Institute), and the development of a reverse
genetics tool using RNA interference [7]. Release of the
genomes of C. elegans [8], C. briggsae [9], Brugia malayi
[10], bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii
TTO1 (obligate endosymbiont) [11] and over 1 million
ESTs from various nematode species deposited in GenBank offers unprecedented opportunities for the genetics
of entomopathogenic nematodes. Here, we report on the
construction of cDNA libraries from H. bacteriophora
TTO1 adult hermaphrodites and the generation and analysis of 31,485 ESTs. The TTO1 strain is different from
GPS11 strain in insect toxicity and their symbiotic bacteria
(Grewal et al., unpublished). ESTs are valuable for gene
discovery and can also be used in the identification of
microsatellite markers [12]. Therefore, we also identified
microsatellite loci in H. bacteriophora ESTs for use in population genetic studies. In addition, ESTs will also aid the
prediction of protein-coding genes in the annotation of
complete genomes. However, domain identification,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/205

secretome prediction, phylogenetic and evolution analysis on the ESTs that are of short-length and low coverage
are not very informative, and therefore were not performed.

Results
Generation of ESTs and assembly
A total of 31,586 ESTs from adult H. bacteriophora TTO1M13e strain were generated from cDNA libraries and were
deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers [GenBank:EG025323] – [GenBank:EG025806], [Gen–
[GenBank:ES414355],
Bank:ES408468]
[GenBank:ES738967] – [GenBank:ES744677], [GenBank:EX006911]
–
[GenBank:EX015306],
[Gen–
[GenBank:EX916843],
and
Bank:EX910019]
[GenBank:FF678120] – [GenBank:FF681586]. The
removal of vector and short length (20 bp or less)
sequences resulted in 31,485 high-quality ESTs with an
average length of 531 bp. The cumulative length of all
high-quality EST sequences was 16,713,919 bases.

The ESTs were subjected to cluster analysis using Vector
NTI Advance™ 10 (Invitrogen), with the final assembly
generated by Vector NTI Advance™ 10. The final assembly
contained 3,051 contigs generated from 23,650 ESTs and
7,835 singletons (Table 1). The contigs consisted of 2 to
283 ESTs (See additional file 1: Components of H. bacteriophora assembled contigs) with lengths ranging from 60
to 2,856 bp and a mean of 743 bp (Table 1). The average
length of singletons was 461 bp (Figure 1). In total, we
identified 10,886 distinct EST sequences.
Putative functional identifications of the ESTs
In order to assess the putative identities, all distinct ESTs
were subjected to BLASTx sequence similarity searches
against GenBank's nr database and Wormpep190 database consisting of extensively curated C. elegans proteins
from Wormbase [13]. Of the 10,886 distinct ESTs, 7,828
(71.9%) had significant matches (E value cutoff 1e-5) to
proteins in GenBank's nr database. As expected, most of
the best matches (95.9%) were to nematode proteins (Figure 2). A small proportion (0.3%) of the best matches was

to prokaryotic proteins with localized sequence similarity
ranging from 28% to 98% and a median of 81% (Table 2)
and the remaining 3.8% of the best matches was to other
eukaryotes including humans, fungi, plants, and insects.
Of the remaining 3,058 H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs, 119
had significant matches to nucleotide sequences in GenBank nt database, including 31 that matched to mitochondrial genes.
The similarity search against C. elegans-specific database
Wormpep190 returned essentially similar results (Figure
3). Of the 10,886 H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs, 7,699
(70.7%) had significant matches (E value cutoff 1e-5) to
4,460 C. elegans proteins in Wormpep190 database. Based
on sequence similarity results, 12 H. bacteriophora ESTs
were identified to be involved in RNA interference (RNAi)
pathway (Table 3). The currently identified H. bacteriophora RNAi genes are a small portion of those identified in
C. elegans and B. malayi (Figure 4). We also identified 22
ESTs corresponding to 14 genes potentially involved in
dauer-related processes (Table 4) and 51 ESTs corresponding to 27 genes involved in defense and stress responses
(see Additional File 2: H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs similar to C. elegans genes involved in defense and stress
responses).
Identification of parasitic nematode-specific ESTs
In order to identify parasitic nematode-specific ESTs, a
comparison of H. bacteriophora ESTs to all nematode EST

sequences from GenBank (see additional file 3: Nematode
species that ESTs used in the analysis came from) was performed. The nematode taxa having ESTs were divided into
animal- and human-parasitic nematodes (AHPNs), plantparasitic nematodes (PPNs), and free-living nematodes
(FLNs) to enable a more informative comparison using
tBLASTx algorithm with an E value cutoff of 1e-5 (Figure
5A). Of the 10,886 H. bacteriophora ESTs, 2,523 had no
matches to nematode ESTs (Figure 5B) of which 2,371
had no matches to proteins but 152 had matches to proteins of other organisms. There were 351 H. bacteriophora
ESTs matching to ESTs of FLNs only, which encoded proteins potentially involved in processes shared by FLNs and
entomopathogenic nematodes, such as dauer formation
and response to environmental stresses. There were 540
H. bacteriophora ESTs matching only to ESTs of AHPNs, 43
matching only to ESTs of PPNs, and 105 matching only to
ESTs of AHPNs and PPNs. Therefore, there were collectively 688 H. bacteriophora ESTs not matching to any of the
ESTs of FLNs. When these 688 H. bacteriophora ESTs were
searched against GenBank's nr database using BLASTx
algorithm we found that 554 had no matches to proteins
of FLNs. These 554 H. bacteriophora ESTs were designated
as parasitic nematode-specific ESTs and listed in the additional file 4: Summary of BLASTx identification of parasitic nematode-specific H. bacteriophora ESTs. Among
these 554 ESTs, 476 (86%) matched to ESTs from clade V
parasitic nematodes and the remaining 78 ESTs (14%)
matched to ESTs from parasitic nematodes in other clades.

Among these parasitic nematode-specific ESTs, 142 had
matches to proteins of other organisms, enabling putative
function assignment. Among these ESTs are those encoding F-box-like/WD-repeat protein, theromacin, Bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and PAZ domain containing protein,
which represent interesting targets for in-depth functional
analysis. The remaining 412 had no matches to any protein in the current databases, and are thus considered
novel sequences.
Gene ontology annotation
Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to 6,685 distinct ESTs with BLASTx search against the April 2008
release of GO database (see additional file 5: Summary of
GO assignment of H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs). The GO
assignment included 1,117 Biological Process terms
assigned 13,438 times to 4,653 distinct ESTs, 244 Cellular
Component terms assigned 2,454 times to 1,778 distinct

ESTs, and 669 Molecular Function terms assigned 4,035
times to 3,190 distinct ESTs. "Embryonic development
ending in birth or egg hatching" (40.9%) was the most
dominant term out of the 4,653 distinct ESTs assigned to
Biological Process GO category, followed by "nematode
larval development" (28.3%), "positive regulation of
growth rate" (27.6%), "reproduction" (24.7%), and
"growth" (23,6%). Biological Process term associations of
H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs that may present potential
interests included: (i) 164 with "determination of adult
life span"; (ii) 22 with "defense response"; (iii) 22 with
dauer-related biological processes, including "dauer larval
development", "dauer entry", and "dauer exit"; and (iv)
37 with stress-related biological processes. Protein binding (53.8%) was the most dominant term among the
3,190 H. bacteriophora ESTs annotated to the Molecular
Function category, followed by identical protein binding
(2.6%) and cytochrome-c oxidase activity (2.5%). Among

the 1,778 H. bacteriophora ESTs annotated to Cellular
Component category, 221 were nuclear and 218 were in
cytoplasm. The GO assignment for each H. bacteriophora
EST is given in additional file 4: Summary of GO assignment of H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs.
Microsatellite-containing ESTs
In total, we identified 168 microsatellite loci from 157 H.
bacteriophora distinct EST sequences. Among these 157 H.
bacteriophora ESTs, 77 had no matches to proteins in GenBank's nr database. The identified microsatellites were dinucleotide (39.4%), tri-nucleotide (46.3%), tetra-nucleotide (2.7%), penta-nucleotide (0.5%), and hexa-nucleotide (0.5%) (Table 5). Among the 168 microsatellite loci,
141 had good flanking sequences for primer design while
the remaining 27 had either short flanking sequences or
the flanking sequences had too low GC contents for
primer design (see additional file 6: Summary of microsatellite loci identified in H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs).

The primers designed for the 141 microsatellite loci are
potentially useful for genetic linkage mapping and population genetic studies.

Discussion
This work produced a total of 31,485 high quality ESTs
representing 10,886 distinct sequences. Sequence similarity searches of H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs showed
71.9% (7,828) matches to proteins from GenBank's nr
database. The remaining 28.1% H. bacteriophora distinct
ESTs represented novel genes yet to be assigned a function, demonstrating enormous novel gene discovery
potential of this EST study. Among H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs having matches to proteins of other organisms
in GenBank's nr database, a vast majority (95.9%)
matched nematode proteins. About 71% (7,699) H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs match to 4,460 proteins from
Wormpep190 that contains 23,771 extensively curated C.
elegans proteins. H. bacteriophora homologs in C. elegans

represent 18.8% of proteins in C. elegans. This finding suggests that H. bacteriophora and C. elegans have vastly different in proteomes, which may be explained in part by freeliving versus parasitic life styles.
Interestingly, 26 distinct ESTs (0.3%) matched to proteins
from various prokaryotic organisms (Table 2), all of
which had less than 100% local sequence identities to
prokaryotic sequences. These transcripts could result from
horizontal gene transfer from bacteria encountered by H.
bacteriophora during its life cycle. None of these ESTs
matched to genes or proteins of P. luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1, the natural symbiont of H. bacteriophora
TTO1 [11]. Given the fact that poly(A) RNA was used in

EST sequencing and the prokaryotic sequences were less
than 100% identical to known prokaryotes, the possibility
that these sequences are contaminants from other bacteria
is low, although the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. The identification of sequences of putative
prokaryotic origin in H. bacteriophora ESTs are consistent
with our previous observations [6] and those observed in
plant parasitic nematodes [14]. The putative prokaryotic
origin of these sequences could be tested more rigorously
once the complete genome sequence becomes available.
Sequence similarity searches of H. bacteriophora distinct
ESTs against ESTs of other nematodes and proteins
revealed the presence of 554 parasitic nematode-specific

ESTs (Additional file 3). Eighty-six percent of these ESTs
matched ESTs from parasitic nematodes in clade V. Taken
into consideration the fact that most FLNs included in this
study were also from clade V, we are confident that these
ESTs reflect the differences between parasitic and free-living nematodes and are not the result of phylogenetic constraint. These 554 H. bacteriophora ESTs had sequence
similarities with ESTs from other parasitic nematodes,
suggesting that these genes may participate in parasitismrelated activities. Although the 2,523 ESTs without
matches to any nematode ESTs could be H. bacteriophora
specific, we hesitate to consider them as parasitic nematode specific at this time because they lack sequence similarity to ESTs of parasitic nematodes. Among these, the
2,371 ESTs without matches to any proteins in the current
GenBank nr database represent potentially novel H. bacteriophora genes, and 81 of these were identified in the EST
dataset of H. bacteriophora GPS11 strain [3,6]. These findings suggest the enormous potential of discovering new
genes and gene functions, genetic networks, and metabolic pathways specific to H. bacteriophora and other entomopathogenic nematodes. The identification of H.
bacteriophora ESTs shared with other parasitic nematodes
through our EST comparison opens the door for conducting in-depth research on gene functions that will ultimately elucidate the parasitic nematode-specific
biological processes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/205

also possible that the antimicrobial peptide is a defense
mechanism against potentially harmful microbes in the
environment. Contig1066 encodes a protein similar to
the uncharacterized protein family UPF0005 containing
protein in Brugia malayi (GenBank accession number
XP_001896958 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/
170584338) and BAX inhibitor-1-like protein in wasp
Nasonia vitripennis (GenBank accession number
XP_001605379 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/
156542785). BAX inhibitor-1 is a member of Bcl-2 family
that suppresses programmed cell death [18]. Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif protein (TMBI) homologs have
been identified in C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. japonica, C.
remanei, and Pristioncus pacifiucs (Wormbase). However,
these genes have very low sequence similarities to H. bacteriophora Contig1066. BAX inhibitor-1 is involved in preventing
endoplasmic
reticulum
stress-related
programmed cell death in Arabidopsis [19] and humans
[20].

Among the 554 parasitic nematode-specific ESTs are those
encoding F-box-like/WD-repeat protein, theromacin, Bax
inhibitor-1-like protein, and PAZ domain containing protein. EST FF678238 encodes a homolog of the F-box-like/
ED-repeat protein in Brugia malayi [10]. The WD-repeat is
commonly associated with F-box domain that mediates
protein-protein interactions in a variety of contexts such
as polyubiquitination [15]. EST FF678397 encodes a protein similar to the PAZ domain containing protein in Brugia malayi [10]. The PAZ (Piwi, Argonaut and Zwille)
domain has nucleic acid-binding capability and is potentially involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing [16].
Further investigation is needed to elucidate the functions
of these two ESTs with common domains and whether
they are related to parasitic nematode-specific processes.

GO assignments based on sequence similarity searches
aid identification of H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs
involved in different biological processes. Here we discuss
the genes involved in some biological processes of interest
in detail. A number of ESTs related to defense responses
and stress responses were identified in these H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs (Additional File 2) based on GO
assignments. Among H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs
involved in defense response are 3 ESTs encoding a
homolog of C. elegans SMEK (Dictyostelium suppressor of
MEK null) homolog that is essential for DAF-16-mediated
defense response to pathogenic bacteria and increased
resistance to oxidative and UV-induced damage [21]. EST
ES410098 encodes a heat shock protein HSP16-1 that is
induced solely in response to heat shock or other environmental stresses [22]. Another 13 ESTs encoding 5 different
proteins whose C. elegans homologs exhibit a "pathogen
susceptibility increased" phenotype when silenced by
RNAi [23]. However, the molecular functions of these
proteins have yet to be elucidated. The defense response
transcripts may be involved in the protection of entomopathogenic nematode IJs from bacterial or fungal
pathogens and the insect innate immune system.

Two other parasitic nematode-specific ESTs are
Contig2528 and Contig1066. Contig2528 encodes a
homolog of theromacin in the segmented worm Theromyzon tessulatum [17]. Theromacin is a novel antimicrobial peptide acting against Gram-positive bacteria but
without any similarities to other known antimicrobial
peptides [17]. H. bacteriophora TTO1 is obligately symbiotic with Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1
in natural environments. The production of an antimicrobial peptide could help establish the symbiotic relationship by selectively eliminating competing microbes. It is

Five H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs involved in stress
response encode a homolog to C. elegans catalase CTL-2
that likely is involved in protecting cells from reactive oxygen species as an antioxidant enzyme [24]. Another EST
(ES742296) encodes a protein whose C. elegans homolog
showed an "organism stress response abnormal" phenotype when silenced with RNAi [25]. Functions of other
ESTs involved in stress response are yet to be clearly characterized. These transcripts related to stress responses provide workable targets for the improvement of ultraviolet,
desiccation, and heat stress tolerance, traits desperately

sought for improving the biological pest control potential
of H. bacteriophora. Once the functions of these genes are
determined, they can be potentially used for genetic
manipulations of entomopathogenic nematodes. ESTs
involved in dauer larval development, dauer entry, and
dauer exit were also identified (Table 4) according to GO
assignments. The infective juvenile stage of entomopathogenic nematodes is developmentally similar to the dauer
stage in many bacteria feeding nematodes, including C.
elegans and C. briggsae. The dauer is a developmentally
arrested stage triggered by food deprivation, high population density, and other harsh environmental conditions
[26]. Elucidation of this process is of specific interest in
the case of entomopathogenic nematodes because the
dauer juvenile is the only life stage capable of infecting
insects [4].
RNA interference represents a powerful technique for
analysis of gene function. An RNAi system relying on
soaking in double-stranded RNA solution has been established in H. bacteriophora [7]. Interestingly, we were able
to identify only a small number of known RNAi related
genes in H. bacteriophora (Table 3) compared to C. elegans
and B. malayi [10].
We have identified genes encoding RNAi induced silencing complex (RISC) components. One EST (EX014403)
encodes a homolog of C. elegans TSN-1 (71% similarity at
the amino acid level) and another EST (Contig211)
encodes a homolog of C. elegans VIG-1 (45% similarity at
the amino acid level). TSN-1 (Tudor staphylococcal nuclease) containing 5 staphylococcal/micrococcal nuclease
domains and a tudor domain is a RISC component in C.
elegans, Drosophila and mammals [27]. The purified TSN1 from C. elegans was shown to have nuclease activity and
therefore thought to contribute to RNA degradation in
RNAi [27]. The product of the vig-1 gene was also shown
to be a component of RISC [28]. We did not identify a
member of Argonaute family in this EST set based on
sequence similarity. However, we identified an EST
(FF678397) encoding a protein similar to a PAZ domain
containing protein from Brugia malayi (57% similarity at
the amino acid level). Another EST (FF679415) encodes a
putative homolog to Drosophila and human Drosha [29]
rather than Dicer in C. elegans. These findings suggest that
H. bacteriophora may have structurally different RNAi
pathway components than its relative, C. elegans.
Other RNAi related genes we were able to identify are
those encoding homologs of SMG-2, SMG-5, RDE-4, GFL1, and ZFP-1. SMG-2 and SMG-5 are involved in nonsense-medicated mRNA decay (NMD) where eukaryotic
mRNAs with premature stop codons are selectively and
rapidly degraded [30,31]. The other three genes, rde-4
[32], gfl-1 and zfp-1 [33] were shown to be involved in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/205

RNAi via RNAi evidence. We currently are not able to
identify a gene encoding a SID-1 homolog in H. bacteriophora TTO1 that was shown to be necessary for systemic
RNAi [34]. However, a sid-1 gene has been found in H.
bacteriophora GPS11 [3]. It is possible that more known
genes may be identified when the complete genome of H.
bacteriophora TTO1 is sequenced.
This EST project also enabled the development of genetic
markers. We have identified 168 microsatellite loci from
H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs, of which we were able to
design primers for 141 based on the flanking sequences.
These microsatellite markers may be useful for genetic
mapping, linkage analysis, and population genetic studies. In a separate effort, microsatellite loci with 2- or 3-bp
repeat units were selected for microsatellite marker development, along with the microsatellite loci enriched from
genomic DNA of H. bacteriophora [35]. Eight polymorphic
microsatellite loci were demonstrated within a Northeast
Ohio population.

Conclusion
We have generated 31,485 high quality H. bacteriophora
ESTs representing 10,886 distinct sequences. Among
these, 7,828 (71.9%) ESTs matched to proteins in GenBank's nr database. The vast majority (95.9%) of the best
matches was to nematode proteins, a small portion
(0.3%) to prokaryotic proteins and the remaining 3.8% to
other eukaryotic proteins. GO terms were assigned to
6,685 H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs. "Embryonic development ending in birth or egg hatching" and "protein binding" were the most dominant terms in the categories of
Biological Process and Molecular Function, respectively.
This EST collection offers unprecedented opportunities
for research on this unique nematode-bacterium symbiotic complex. The comparison of ESTs of H. bacteriophora
TTO1 with those of AHPNs, FLNs, and PPNs resulted in
the identification of 554 parasitic nematode-specific ESTs.
These ESTs should be valuable for future research related
to insect parasitism by these nematodes. We were able to
identify a small number of ESTs involved in RNAi, among
which is an EST encoding a Drosha homolog, suggesting
structurally different RNAi pathway components from
those in C. elegans. In addition, we have identified 157
microsatellite loci which may prove valuable once their
polymorphisms are tested and validated. Overall, novel,
parasitic nematode-specific, and C. elegans homologous
genes have been identified in this EST study, greatly facilitating genome annotation, gene functional analysis, population genetic studies, and microarray development.

Methods
RNA isolation, cDNA library construction, and sequencing
Total RNA and poly(A) RNA were isolated from adult hermaphrodites of the isogenic line of Heterorhabditis bacteri-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:205

ophora TTO1-M31e strain propagated on a lawn of
Photorhabdus luminescens bacterium. Poly(A) RNA was
used for cDNA library construction with two different
strategies. The first group of libraries were constructed
using the CloneMiner™ cDNA Library Construction Kit
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, 2 μg single-stranded mRNA was converted into
double stranded cDNA containing attB sequences on each
end. Through site-specific recombination, attB-flanked
cDNA was cloned into the attP-containing pDONR222
vector. The second group of libraries were constructed
using SMART technology with modifications. Briefly, the
double stranded cDNA was synthesized with SMART oligos from poly(A) RNA with SuperScript® III First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and Advantage® High Fidelity 2 PCR kit (Clontech). The double-stranded cDNA was
normalized with duplex-specific nuclease (Evrogen) and
then was nebulized, end repaired with End Repair Kit
(Lucigen), size separated, and ligated into pSMART hinc II
Vector System (Lucigen). The cloning and sequencing of
both pDONR222 and pSMART libraries were not directional, leading to the production of ESTs from both 5' and
3' ends. The sequences were generated by ABI 3730
machines from the cDNA libraries using and deposited in
GenBank dbEST.
Contig assembly and analysis
EST sequences in FASTA format were downloaded from
GenBank dbEST. The sequences were processed by removing vector sequences with Vector NTI Advance™ 10 program. The processed EST sequences were assembled into
contigs (contiguous sequences) using the ContigExpress
module embedded in Vector NTI Advance™ 10 (Invitrogen). These stringent parameters of assembly (overlap
length cutoff of 40 and overlap percent identity cutoff of
95%) were used to assure proper assembly. The distinct
EST sequences, including the contig consensus sequences
and the singleton sequences, were searched against GenBank's nr database and Wormpep190 databases in a local
Linux workstation using the BLASTx algorithm [36]. The E
value cutoff of the BLASTx searches was 1e-5.
EST comparison
All nematode EST sequences were downloaded from GenBank dbEST to a local Linux workstation and formatted as
a database for tBLASTx searches. Gene index (GI) numbers of all nematode EST sequences were extracted and
grouped according to the categories of AHPNs, PPNs, and
FLNs. The tBLASTx searches were performed in a local
Linux workstation against the complete nematode EST
database with the -l option enabled to restrict the database
search to the list of GI's of the targeted group [7]. For
example, when comparing H. bacteriophora ESTs to ESTs of
FLNs, "-l fln.gi" was included in the command with fln.gi
containing all GI numbers of EST entries from free-living

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/205

nematodes. The BLAST outputs were parsed with in-house
developed perl scripts to extract match information. ESTs
with no significant matches to ESTs of FLNs were extracted
and further searched against GenBank nr and
Wormpep190 databases using BLASTx algorithm. EST
entries with no significant matches to proteins of FLNs
were designated parasitic nematode-specific ESTs, which
were further characterized. The cutoff value of BLAST
searches was 1e-5.
Gene Ontology annotation
For assignment of Gene Ontology terms, the distinct H.
bacteriophora ESTs were searched using the BLASTx algorithm against the annotated sequences of FASTA format in
the April 2008 release of GO database. The BLAST output
was parsed and terms assigned with the assistance of inhouse developed perl scripts accessing the MySQL database of "mygo" in a local Linux workstation. The distribution of GO terms in each of the main ontology categories,
Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular
Function [37], was examined. The number of H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs assigned in a single GO category was
considered as 100% [12,38].
Bioinformatics mining of microsatellite loci
The set of 10,886 H. bacteriophora distinct ESTs were
searched for microsatellite loci using msatfinder v. 2.0.9
[39] in a local Linux workstation. The cut-off values of
number of repeats were set to 6 for di-nucleotide loci and
5 for tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide loci. Primers
were designed using Primer3 release 1.0 [40] in a local
Linux workstation.
