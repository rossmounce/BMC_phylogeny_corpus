Abstract
Background: Rice and barley are both members of Poaceae (grass family) but have a marked
difference in salt tolerance. The molecular mechanism underlying this difference was previously
unexplored. This study employs a comparative genomics approach to identify analogous and
contrasting gene expression patterns between rice and barley.
Results: A hierarchical clustering approach identified several interesting expression trajectories
among rice and barley genotypes. There were no major conserved expression patterns between
the two species in response to salt stress. A wheat salt-stress dataset was queried for comparison
with rice and barley. Roughly one-third of the salt-stress responses of barley were conserved with
wheat while overlap between wheat and rice was minimal. These results demonstrate that, at
transcriptome level, rice is strikingly different compared to the more closely related barley and
wheat. This apparent lack of analogous transcriptional programs in response to salt stress is further
highlighted through close examination of genes associated with root growth and development.
Conclusion: The analysis provides support for the hypothesis that conservation of transcriptional
signatures in response to environmental cues depends on the genetic similarity among the
genotypes within a species, and on the phylogenetic distance between the species.

Background
Phenotypic divergence can often be traced to gene expression variation. Gene expression variation resulting in phenotypic differences has been observed among individuals
within a population, a species and across multiple species
[1,2]. Although instances of phenotypic divergence and
underlying expression variation were reported in the past,

it was the advent of reliable microarray technology that
enabled biologists to study expression variation at a
whole-genome level and link it to phenotypic variation.
Several studies have focused on expression level variation
among accession within the species and between species
in Drosophila, primates, yeast and fish [1,3-5]. In the plant

kingdom, however, comparative genomics expression
analyses across species have been scarce. One noteworthy
comparative interspecies experiment sampled different
tissues and revealed a low correlation for conserved
expression pattern between rice and Arabidopsis orthologs
[6]. The comparison between these highly diverged model
species representing the monocots and dicots was elaborated upon by measuring their responses to light and dark
regimes in two tissue types [7]. The comparisons indicated
expression level conservation to some degree during the
light regime but not in changes triggered in response to
darkness. The study further indicated a lack of conservation in response to light between shoot and root tissue,
thus highlighting the significance of tissue level variation
that exist in inter- and intra-species comparisons [8]. A
comparison between two ecotypes of A. thaliana at early
seedling stage identified about 8% of the transcriptome to
be differentially expressed. Notably, genes with a difference in transcript abundance were enriched in genes
responsive to environmental factors [9].
Studies comparing the transcriptomes of multiple species
have provided insights on phenotypic variation and
accompanying expression variation. However, the biological interpretation can be challenging due to large and
diverse sets of genes which are expressed differently across
species. A more targeted approach for multi-species comparative expression analysis is to determine how different
species respond to a particular perturbation such as starvation, exposure to chemicals or a naturally occurring
environmental stress. For instance in plants, the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana and a salt-tolerant Thellungiella halophila have been compared for their response
to salt stress [10,11]. An important finding of these studies
was that the highly tolerant Thellungiella halophila had several salt-tolerance related genes constitutively expressed at
a higher level compared to A. thaliana even in absence of
stress. In the present study, the focus was on the differential response patterns of two distantly related plant species
to salt stress. Two economically important members from
the Poaceae, rice and barley, were selected and profiled
with respect to the deviation in their transcriptional signatures upon exposure to salt stress.
Rice is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of salinity. In contrast, barley is among the most salt-tolerant
cereal crops. Physiological approaches have been
employed previously to characterize the phenotypic variation in salt tolerance for these two grass species [12]. The
transcriptional responses of rice and barley genotypes
were also characterized independently by several laboratories using various microarray platforms [13-15]. However, a detailed comparative genomics approach to
elucidate how and why these species differ in their toler-

ance to salt stress at molecular level remains to be pursued.
Although a comparison between rice and barley at the
expression level can be performed in silico using existing
datasets, such an approach has some limitations. For
instance, most of the experiments involve varying levels
and durations of stress imposed on plants. Further, the
developmental stage at which stress is imposed varies
widely. These issues are expected to inflate the observed
expression level variations. Since most of the previous
studies only employ a single genotype of rice or barley for
expression analysis, the generality of the interpretations is
limited. In this study we have used an equivalent stress
level, a cognate developmental stage, similar tissue, identical microarray technology and an identical statistical
analysis to compare the expression differences between
rice and barley as well as within the genera.
The basic research questions which we sought to address
in the present study are as follows: How conserved or different are the responses of rice and barley genes upon
exposure to salt stress? Is there any species specific activation or repression of pathway(s) which can be associated
with salt-tolerance of barley or sensitivity of rice?

Results and discussion
Experimental design for comparative study
The primary focus in designing the experiments was to
assay biological materials at a comparable developmental
phase and stress level for both species. We used two
closely related rice genotypes IR29 (salt-sensitive) and
FL478 (salt-tolerant) (Figure 1). The genotype FL478 is an
F2-derived F8 recombinant inbred line whose phenology
is similar to that of IR29 [16,17]. The tolerant rice genotype accumulated lower Na+ in the roots and shoot tissue
compared to sensitive IR29 when exposed to salt stress
[see Additional file 1]. Further, the relative decrease in
shoot and root biomass of salt stressed FL478 plants is significantly less compared to sensitive IR29. The genotypic
pair used for barley was the salt-tolerant, irradiationderived Golden Promise (GP) and its progenitor, Maythorpe (MT) [18]. The tolerant Golden Promise accumulates lower Na+ in the shoot and root tissue compared to
Maythorpe when grown under high salt conditions
[19,20]. By employing rice and barley genotypic pairs
with similar phenology we have attempted to minimize
transcriptome differences resulting from differences in
developmental phases. The current study used root material from plants in early tillering stage. Rice yield in particular is very sensitive to salinity during early tillering. The
present study used matching tissue type (root tips) for rice
and barley. Root samples were collected from plants
growing under control and salt-stressed conditions. The

salt stress levels selected for the both rice and barley were
based on a yield loss of 60% for both, the sensitive rice
(IR29) and sensitive barley (Maythorpe) [21,18]. We used
the Rice Genome Array and Barley1 GeneChip from
Affymetrix for transcriptional assay of rice and barley
respectively.
Orthologous gene representation between Rice Genome
Array and Barley1 GeneChip
To compare the salinity stress response between rice and
barley, we first determined the extent of rice genome representation on the Barley1 GeneChip. For this the Barley1
probe set annotations were exported from HarvEST:Barley
[22]. The unique rice loci corresponding to the barley
probe sets were determined based on BLASTX searches
against the rice genome. Representation for 10,808
unique rice gene orthologs was found on the barley array.
A parallel analysis for the Rice Genome Array using HarvEST:Rice yielded 52,660 rice loci. For this analysis, the
splice variant derived gene models were ignored. Based on
the described cross-platform mapping, Barley1 GeneChip
represents orthologs for roughly one-fifth of the rice
genes.
Clustering analysis of rice and barley
We were interested in identifying genes that have similar
and contrasting expression trajectories in response to saltstress in rice and barley. The first method we used to
address this question was the hierarchical clustering of
orthologous pairs. The clustering analysis of the rice and
barley dataset is expected to reveal genes whose response
to salt stress is conserved across rice and barley. In addition, this analysis is likely to identify genes with distinct
transcript trajectories, which may explain the differences
in salinity tolerance between rice and barley.

For the clustering analysis, 10,808 barley probe sets were
included. These probe sets have a corresponding rice gene
model and a representative probe set on rice array. Initially, hierarchical clustering was performed on the barley
data set using these 10,808 probe sets. From these clusters
were selected which have higher transcript abundance in
both barley genotypes (GP and MT) when growing under
salt-stressed conditions (Figure 2A, left panel). Clusters
were then identified which were predominantly populated by genes with decreased transcript abundance in barley under stress (Figure 2B, left panel). To study the
response of the rice orthologs of these two gene sets
(induced and repressed sets in barley during stress), we
performed the cluster analysis on the rice dataset for
FL478 and IR29. The majority of the rice genes corresponding to the two barley genes sets were found to have
distinct expression patterns. These genes were selectively
extracted from the rice heat map and matched with their
orthologous barley genes (Figure 2A and 2B). Based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/398

these analyses several distinct clusters emerged which
were annotated as Cluster I to VII [see Additional files 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8].
We have focused mainly on Cluster II and Cluster VII
because they include genes which have contrasting
responses between the rice and barley orthologs. Cluster II
includes genes which have increased transcript levels in
barley but were repressed in rice when exposed to salinity.
Cluster VII is composed of genes whose transcript levels
decrease in barley but increase in rice in response to salt
stress. To obtain a broad functional categorization of
these genes, the Functional Catalogue tool available from
MIPS was used. The Cluster II gene set is enriched in cell
rescue, defense and virulence (p-value < 0.006) and interaction with the environment (p-value < 0.002). A noteworthy member of this cluster is LOW EXPRESSION OF
OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 2 (LOS2). Based on
the cluster analysis, LOS2 is up-regulated in barley genotypes but down-regulated in rice upon exposure to high
salt. LOS2 encodes a bifunctional enolase which is
required for low-temperature response and acquired tolerance to freezing in A. thaliana [23]. Another member of
Cluster II is PHOSPHOLIPASE D DELTA. Its regulation
followed a similar pattern to that displayed by LOS2, i.e.
it is also up-regulated in barley genotypes but down-regulated in rice upon exposure to high salt. It is worth noting
that the Arabidopsis ortholog of PLD-delta is known to be
involved in the H2O2 mediated programmed cell death
(PCD). Activation of PLD-delta decreases H2O2 cell death
and improves stress tolerance [24]. Further, to examine if
any other members of the Cluster II are also responsive to
PCD, A. thaliana orthologs of the rice genes were queried
as to their response to PCD in the Response Viewer available from TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org. At least 5
genes were found to be down-regulated and 2 genes upregulated by PCD. LOS2 was also down-regulated during
PCD in A. thaliana. Presuming functional conservation of
PLD-delta among rice, barley and Arabidopsis, it is possible that decreased expression of PLD-delta makes rice
roots more susceptible to cell death. The decreased expression of LOS2 and PLD-delta under salt stress is likely to
make rice more sensitive to stress. In contrast, both these
genes are induced in barley, potentially enabling the plant
to ameliorate H2O2-mediated PCD-like conditions and
improving stress tolerance.
Interestingly, there were no prominent gene clusters in
rice and barley that had conserved expression patterns;
however the cluster analysis described here primarily
serves the purpose of a broad overview and lacks statistical
robustness. Therefore, it is necessary to further examine
the absence of conserved expression patterns between rice
and barley by adopting a more statistically stringent differential expression analysis.

were scaled from -3 to +3. P-value threshold for clustering genes was 0.001.

Differential expression of rice and barley genes in response
to salinity stress
Rice and barley data were analyzed separately to identify
genes that are differentially expressed in response to salinity stress. The present work focuses only on comparing the
response of rice and barley to stress. The response of rice
or barley was defined to include genes which are commonly up-or down-regulated in both the genotypes of rice
or barley (Figure 1C; comparisons 1 and 2 for rice and 4
and 5 for barley). Although genotypic comparisons within
a species are important to understand expression level variation, we decided to focus on only the salt-stress responsive genes for the present work.

For calling differentially expressed genes in response to
salinity, a threshold of 10% FDR in Statistical Analysis of
Microarray (SAM) was used. The data preprocessing and
statistical analysis is detailed in the Materials and Methods section. The number of probe sets identified by this
statistical analysis for each genotype is listed in Table 1.
The complete lists of differentially expressed genes for rice
and barley are provided [see Additional files 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15 and 16]. Fifty-eight probe sets were found to be
commonly induced between the rice genotypes and 60
probe sets were repressed in both rice genotypes. In barley, the overlap between up-regulated and down-regulated probe sets was 250 and 179 respectively. Therefore,
the conservation of expression responses was higher
between barley genotypes than between rice. The barley
genotypes, GP and MT are estimated to be more closely
related than the rice genotypes IR29 and FL478. The
number of differentially expressed genes in barley is likely
to be an under-estimate because the barley array does not
represent the complete genome.
Biological features extracted from GO analysis
We obtained the functional categorization of the differentially expressed genes for rice and barley in response to
salinity stress. The GO analysis was performed separately
for up-regulated and down-regulated genes for each genotype of rice and barley using the best BLASTX hit based
Arabidopsis orthologs [see Additional files 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23 and 24]. Three major GO sub-categories which
predominantly highlighted interesting differences
between rice and barley and/or between salt-tolerant and

The blue cluster in Figure 3 includes selected sub-categories related to environmental stress response. In this cluster, a noteworthy distinction among tolerant and sensitive
genotypes is that, in both rice and barley sensitive genotypes, a more significant proportion of the genes related to
osmosensing and salt stress are down-regulated. The differentially regulated genes in the tolerant rice FL478 are
highly enriched for genes involved in metal and cation
homeostasis. A higher number of genes associated with
oxygen radical detoxification are repressed in sensitive
genotypes IR29 and MT. Plants activate detoxification
genes to counter highly reactive and damaging species
generated during oxidative stress. Reduced expression of
detoxification associated genes in sensitive genotypes may
distinguish the tolerant genotypes from their sensitive
counterparts across species.
In addition to the categories represented on the heat map,
some additional conspicuous subcategories were found.
Genes mapping to the GO category pertaining to cell wall
biogenesis showed a inverse response between rice and
barley. Several genes in this category were repressed in
barley. The situation was different for rice genotypes. The
rice cell wall biogenesis category was very highly enriched
in up-regulated genes but not many of the cell wall genes
were down-regulated. The contrasting response between
the rice and barley in the context of cell wall biogenesis is
surprising considering that high salt levels in and around
the roots are expected to retard growth and associated cell
wall biogenesis activities in the root tissue.

salt-sensitive genotypes are displayed in Figure 3. The figure shows two separate cluster branches color-coded red
and blue. The red cluster represents genes involved in
energy-related biological processes such as glycolysis, TCA
pathway, and energy-generation among others. The most
striking feature of this cluster is that the gene set downregulated in IR29 in response to salt stress has a large
number of genes associated with energy-related processes.
Further, in FL478 the subcategories of TCA pathway and
respiration are also over-represented in the down-regulated gene set. However, the barley genotypes GP and MT
do not exhibit any notable decrease in energy generation
and related processes in response to stress. This analysis
indicates that energy generation related processes are
more repressed in salt-sensitive rice compared to tolerant
rice. Further, these processes did not exhibit a transcriptional repression in barley roots indicating that energy
generation pathways are more sensitive to salt stress in
rice than barley.

discovery rate (FDR) cut-off

Comparing the transcriptional responses of rice and barley
Using the genes identified by differential expression analysis, we next sought to determine the degree to which the
response of rice-barley orthologous pairs is shared on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/398

17% of the genes repressed in FL478 are also regulated
similarly by IR29. These numbers are unexpectedly low
considering that IR29 and FL478 share at least half their
genomic content because FL478 is an F2-derived RIL. The
genotypic pair in barley is relatively more similar since GP
and MT are known to differ at few haploblocks [20]. This
higher genetic similarity may potentially explain the
higher conservation observed between GP and MT. More
than 50% of the genes up-regulated or down-regulated in
GP are also similarly regulated in MT. Our analyses indicate an unexpectedly divergent response of barley and rice
to salt stress. The observed divergence, as measured by differentially responsive orthologs, is consistent with the
degree of genetic dissimilarity ascertained qualitatively.

exposure to salt stress. For this analysis gene sets which are
commonly regulated by both genotypes of rice and barley
were used (Table 1). The response to salt stress as identified by differential expression analysis is highly divergent
between rice and barley. Only a single gene Os05g13940
(a plasma-membrane linker protein) was found to be
induced in both rice and barley. Four genes were commonly repressed in response to salt stress in both species.
These comparisons indicate that commonality between
the two species at the transcription level is sparse at the
threshold levels used in the current analysis for identifying salt responsive genes. The results however are consistent if viewed in context of the identified conserved
responses between the genotypic pairs of both rice and
barley. For instance only 24% of the genes induced in
FL478 are shared with those induced in IR29 while only

Salt-stress regulated transcriptome of wheat
To increase the power and generality of our comparative
analysis approach, public databases were searched to find
gene expression datasets of salt stress responses in other
plant species. We selected a dataset generated for wheat
roots response during salt stress using the Affymetrix
Wheat Array [25]. These particular wheat data were generated using the same platform technology as with the rice
and barley data. Therefore, the preprocessing and analysis
of the wheat transcriptome data were performed using the
same statistical protocols. This minimized introducing
additional bias due to differences in the preprocessing
(normalization and background correction) and differential expression analysis. The root tissue for the wheat data
was collected from developmentally comparable plants
but was exposed to higher salinity levels in case of stressed
plants. Another important difference is that the wheat
data were collected from the whole root tissue while the
rice and barley data were generated from root tips. While
a difference in stress levels and the tissue sampling are
likely to result in gene expression changes, the comparisons can yield useful information.

The statistical analysis performed identified 1174 probe
sets that were induced in response to salt stress. Based on
best BLASTX hit criteria that was used previously for barley, these probe sets matched 583 unique rice loci. A total
of 1304 probe sets were repressed under stress conditions
in wheat. The down-regulated wheat probe sets corresponded to 784 rice loci. The unique rice loci filtered from
the two wheat gene sets were used to make the interspecific comparisons. Twenty percent of the genes that are
induced in barley (both GP and MT) were found to be
induced in wheat. Similarly, a significant portion (34%)
of the genes down-regulated in barley, were also downregulated in wheat roots in response to salt stress. In striking contrast, less than 5% of the differentially expressed
genes were shared between wheat and rice gene sets
responding to salt stress. It is pertinent to note that conserved responses indicated by our comparison are likely

Page 7 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:398

underestimated as only the best BLASTX match rice loci
were used for the analysis.
Regardless, the analysis clearly indicates that expression
level response to high salt levels is conserved to a significant degree between wheat and barley but is highly
diverged in rice. Interestingly, the expression divergence
among rice, barley and wheat qualitatively correlates with
evolutionary distance among these grass species. Rice and
wheat diverged from a common ancestor ~46 million
years ago (mya) [26] and one estimate of wheat and barley divergence indicates 11–15 mya [27]. Therefore
sequence-based estimates separate rice and barley lineage
by more than 40 million years. The observations herein
are consistent with those reported for a comparative primate study. The primate study involved a comparison of
expression profiles of multiple tissues among human,
chimpanzee and macaque. The analysis revealed a higher
expression-level similarity between human and chimpanzee than when either one was compared to evolutionarily
distant macaque [4].
To ascertain if salt-sensitive rice has responses that are
directly opposite to those of tolerant barley and wheat, we
searched for genes which are up-regulated in rice but
down-regulated in either barley or wheat. We identified
six genes which were up-regulated in rice (both FL478 and
IR29) and down-regulated in wheat. Similar comparison
with barley identified four such genes. One of the two
genes up-regulated in rice and down-regulated in both
barley and wheat is RESPONSE TO DESSICATION 22
(RD22). Another gene is ZRP4, an O-methyltransferase
originally identified in maize as a developmentally regulated gene strongly expressed in root endodermis [28].
The number of genes identified using the commonly regulated gene set for each species yielded very few genes
with opposite response to salinity in roots. The scenario
however, was surprisingly different when genes induced
in IR29 were compared to genes repressed in wheat.
Twenty nine genes were found to fulfill the criterion. No
genes were found to be down-regulated in IR29 but activated in wheat. The 29 genes identified included several
known key regulators of plants such as NITRATE
REDUCTASE 1 (NIA1), CBF1, and two genes encoding for
enzymes from flavonoid pathway TRANSPARENT TESTA
7 (TT7) and CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS).
Salt-stress and root development
During salt stress roots are not only exposed to higher cellular Na+ but are also physically exposed to a high salt
environment. In this context it was pertinent to determine
how salt-stress regulates genes that are critical for normal
root development programs. Identifying these stressresponsive developmental genes can provide insight into
how different plant species with varying degree of stress

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/398

tolerance change their developmental programs to adapt
to stress. Several genes were identified which respond to
salt stress and are known to determine the root architecture in plants. Some of these genes are represented on the
heat map in Figure 4 which displays their relative expression across rice, barley and wheat.
Differential analysis identified CONSTAN-LIKE 3 (COL3)
to be highly induced in rice but repressed in barley and
wheat under stress. COL3 has been reported to promote
lateral root formation [29]. We find it intriguing that
COL3 and several other genes involved in root development which are expected to be down-regulated in
response to salt stress are either unchanged or slightly
induced in rice roots. Most of these genes are down-regulated in barley and wheat during salt stress. The information on the salt regulated root-developmental genes was
further refined by employing the rich spatial transcriptomic resources that are available for model plant Arabidopsis. The expression profiles of the Arabidopsis orthologs
of these genes were studied by analyzing the cell-type specific data for roots under control and short-term salt stress
[30]. Several of the genes identified from rice, barley and
wheat analysis have enhanced cell-type specific expression. These genes were primarily expressed in columella
root cap (indicated by green bar) and epidermis and lateral root cap (magenta bar) in Arabidopsis when each of
the cell type was teased apart and assay separately. Both
these root tissue types are critical sites for root growth.
Arabidopsis orthologs of at least three members of the cluster (COBRA, ARF8 and TUA6) are down-regulated in
response to salt stress.
Collectively, these data indicate that several of the root
development genes that populate the cluster are likely to
have high cell-type specificity of expression for root growing points in cereals. These genes are known critical regulators of root growth. In the current analysis they were
repressed during salt stress in barley, wheat and Arabidopsis but not in rice. This interpretation, although based on
a small and selected set of genes, is consistent with the
genome-wide observation that transcriptome dynamics in
rice roots are highly diverged from those of barley and
wheat. This particular response could possibly result if
highly sensitive rice is programmed to promote root
growth in an attempt to grow away from high salt zone in
natural environments. Alternatively, rice roots could continue to grow at the lower salinity levels they were exposed
to in the present experiment while the relatively higher
stress levels in barley and wheat represses root growth promoting genes.
Salt stress and auxin regulation in roots
The comparative multi-species transcriptional analysis in
the present study identified several key root development

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:398

regulators which respond differentially between the rice
and relatively more tolerant barley and wheat in the presence of high salt. Since auxin is central to root growth and
development, data sets supporting the study were further
explored for evidence which may link perturbed auxin
homeostasis to differential response of developmental
genes during salt stress. We found several auxin-related
genes to be responsive to salt stress in barley and wheat
but only to a limited degree in rice. The GO analysis also
highlighted the fact that gene sets down-regulated in barley in response to salt stress are more enriched in the
auxin-related genes than the responsive gene sets in rice
(Figure 3). The distinct contrast between rice and barley in
the context of root developmental genes and auxin-related
genes could be interpreted as either a lack of response or
a delayed response of rice when exposed to high salt. This
apparent lack of adjustment in root developmental programs upon exposure to salinity could potentially explain
the salt-sensitivity of rice relative to barley and wheat.
It is useful and important to also consider the results in a
physiological context such as differences in ion transport
among the three species. More specifically, the rate of Na+
transport and Na+ concentration likely differs among
these three species. In light of this and other ion-transport
linked possibilities, the microarray data were reexamined
specifically for responses of Na+ transporter encoding
genes in the rice genome. The expression of most of the
Na+ transporter genes was found to be highly variable
across replicates as well as treatments (data not shown).
Similar observations were also made from the barley dataset. The role of ion transporters in overall uptake of ions
to the shoot may vary with species. Higher Na+ concentrations in shoot tissue in rice is thought to result from partly
from transpirational bypass flow in addition to net Na+
uptake [31]. Thus, on a speculative note, the regulation of
the expression of Na+ transporter encoding genes in
response to salinity stress may play a more limited role in
tolerance, at least in rice. The regulation of overall root
development and root architecture in rice may play a
major role in tolerance, too. These analyses also highlight
the importance of more detailed physiological measurements such as Na+, K+, Cl- ion levels in the different tissue
types and several time points for transcript analysis in
future experiments.

Conclusion
Comparative genomics is a useful approach for identifying biological features which are evolutionarily conserved
across species and those which are characteristics of a particular species. Aided by publicly available expression data
sets for wheat and Arabidopsis, this study compared the
root transcriptome of two important cereal species in
response to salt stress. While we did not identify any conservation in expression level response, the analysis successfully revealed several key biological features that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/398

distinguish rice from barley and wheat which are relatively more closely related. The study's findings may
explain the phenotypic difference between rice and barley.
We propose that under salt stress, rice is unable to repress
key biological activities associated with growth such as
root development genes, cell wall biogenesis genes and
auxin-regulated genes. In contrast, genes associated with
these three subcategories are suppressed in barley and also
in wheat. It should be note that while these features
clearly distinguish the response of rice from barley, it is
difficult to ascertain if these features are the cause or the
effect of inherent salt-sensitivity of rice. What is needed is
a detailed study of root growth and development, and
root architecture coupled with a high-resolution transcriptional analysis to help ascertain the mechanism of salt
adaptation in cereals. The interpretations from the current
study should be taken with some degree of caution,
though, as they are limited to the analysis of the roots of
these species at one developmental stage. Future work will
focus on the shoot tissue and aim for a higher spatial and
developmental resolution in several genotypes across
multiple species. Such an approach will elucidate orthologous transcriptional networks required for response to
environmental stress in a wide array of related species.

Methods
Rice genotypes IR29 and FL478 were originally obtained
from G.B. Gregorio at IRRI, Philippines and seed was multiplied by Linghe Zeng at U. S. Salinity Laboratory, Riverside. Seed for barley genotypes Golden Promise was a gift
from Peggy Lemaux (University of California, Berkeley)
and Maythorpe was obtained from the National Small
Grains Collection, USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, Idaho. The
plants were cultured for expression studies at the U.S.
Salinity Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Riverside, CA.
Rice salinity stress treatment
Rice plants were grown in large tanks (122 × 61 × 46 cm)
filled with sand and irrigated with Yoshida solution. The
seedlings were grown with nutrient solution for 22 d after
germination. Salinity stress treatment was applied by adding NaCl and CaCl2 (5:1 molar concentration) in 2 steps
to a final ECw of 7.4 dSm-1 (~60 mM NaCl) over a period
of 3 d to avoid a sudden osmotic stress. The ECw of control
tanks was 1.1 dSm-1. The nutrient solution pH was maintained between 5.0 and 6.5 by adding sulfuric acid. Plants
were exposed to salt stress for 5 more days. The rationale
was to allow the plants to adapt to high salinity and capture the more relevant adaptive responses. Roots (2 cm of
root tips) were harvested and snap frozen for RNA extraction 30 d after germination. The rice plants from the control tanks were also harvested at the same time. The plants
were in early tillering stage of development at the time of
harvest. Three biological replicates were obtained for
FL478 and IR29 from both control and high salinity sand
tanks. The air temperature ranged from 32°C to 45°C

The root tissue harvest stage for both species was during
the early tillering when rice yield is highly sensitive to salt
stress. The salt stress levels selected for the both rice (7.4
dSm-1/~60 mM NaCl) and barley (17 dSm-1/~150 mM
NaCl) were based on past experiments which indicated a
yield loss by 60% for both, the sensitive rice (IR29) and
sensitive barley (Maythorpe) [21,18].

during the day and between 19°C to 22°C at night. Relative humidity ranged from 40% to 80%.
Barley salinity stress treatment
Germinated barley seeds of Golden Promise and Maythorpe were transferred to Speedling transplant trays (polystyrene trays with cells) floated on aerated half-strength
Hoagland's solution with double iron (50 gL-1) in two
large (700 L) metal containers in the greenhouse. Sixteen
days after germination, the plants in one container were
exposed to a gradually increasing salt stress. The final ECw
17 dSm-1 (~150 mM NaCl) was achieved by gradually
increasing the salt concentration during a period of 5
days. A Na:Ca molar ratio of 10:1 was maintained during
each increment of salinity level by adding CaCl2. The system was allowed to stabilize for 5 more days and then
roots (2 cm of root tips) of stressed and control plants for
both genotypes were harvested and snap frozen. Roots
from ~15 plants were harvested for each genotype to constitute a biological replicate. Material from 3 independent
biological replicates was obtained for RNA extraction.

Wheat salinity stress treatment
Wheat microarray data included in this analysis was generated by Mott and Wang (2007). We used the wheat cv.
Chinese Spring root sample microarray data. The salinity
level reported in the wheat experiment was a gradual
increment (6 dS/m) to reach a final EC of 30 dS/m. The
RNA for the microarray was obtained from whole root tissue of 42 d old plants. The wheat data used in the current
analysis was generated from a relatively higher salt stress
treatment. Further the plants were sampled in a later
developmental stage than rice and barley. The rice and
barley dataset were generated using the RNA from root
tips while the wheat data was obtained from whole roots.
These differences are significant and are expected to influence the transcriptional responses to salinity stress among
the three species. However, the comparison of wheat data
with rice and barley indicates that such an analysis can
provide useful information.
RNA preparation and GeneChip hybridization
RNA extraction, clean-up, labeling and hybridization to
GeneChips for rice and barley root samples was done as
described in Walia et al., 2005. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from root tissue using the TRIzol reagent. The RNA
was cleaned by passing through an RNAeasy spin column
(Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and on-column DNase1
treated according to manufacturer's protocol. The RNA
quality was assessed using the RNA Lab-On-A-Chip (Caliper technologies Corp., Mountain View, CA) on a Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo alto, CA).
Further labeling and hybridization steps were performed
as recommended by Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix Genechip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix,
INC., Santa Clara, CA). Each biological replicate was
hybridized to an array to obtain a total of 3 replicates for
each genotype and treatment. The only exception was
IR29 control samples for which for which only 2 biological replicates are available.
Data analysis
Scanned GeneChip images from rice and barley were
examined for visual aberrations. Images with visual
defects were discarded and labeled cRNA was hybridized
to fresh GeneChips. Further preprocessing and analysis
was performed using the .CEL files. The .CEL files were
imported into RMA [32] for further processing. The background adjustment and quantile normalization were per-

formed using the default settings. The log-transformed
values from RMA were imported into Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software [33]. To identify salt
stress responsive genes we performed differential expression analysis using the two-class unpaired selection in
SAM. The test statistics used was the T-statistic. The arbitrary cut-off for calling differential expression was set at
10% FDR (q-value). We did not use a fold change threshold for analysis using SAM. The rice and barley dataset
were analyzed as described above. Publicly available
wheat (E-MEXP-971; ArrayExpress EBI) and Arabidopsis
(GSE7642; NCBI GEO) datasets were also analyzed independently using the described preprocessing and differential expression analysis.
Probe set Annotation
The probe sets for rice, barley and wheat were obtained
using the HarvEST:Rice (ver. 1.10), HarvEST:Barley (ver.
1.72) and HarvEST:Wheat (ver. 1.52) annotation tool
publicly available at [34]. The software provides the best
BLASTX hit against UniProt, TIGR Rice, and TAIR Arabidopsis database with a cut-off threshold of E-20. The minimum number of probes matched selected for the
annotation was 11. The annotation for Arabidopsis probe
sets was obtained from the BAR tool [35].
Hierarchical clustering analysis
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was performed separately for rice and barley datasets. The threshold for calling significant gene clusters was set to a p-value
of 0.001. Pearson correlation was used for placing neighboring probe sets. The Gene Ontology (GO) heat cluster
was generated using the -log (p-value) for each sub-category (Figure 3). The color code for the heat map displays
pink for lower p-value (more significant enrichment) and
blue represents low or no relative enrichment of a category for a given gene set.

Availability and requirements
The rice and barley data are available through the NCBI
portal GEO under series GSE13735 and GSE6325. The list
of differentially expressed genes and GO is available as
