Abstract
Background: The genus Bothrops is widespread throughout Central and South America and is the principal cause
of snakebite in these regions. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies have examined the venom composition of
several species in this genus, but many others remain to be studied. In this work, we used a transcriptomic
approach to examine the venom gland genes of Bothrops alternatus, a clinically important species found in
southeastern and southern Brazil, Uruguay, northern Argentina and eastern Paraguay.
Results: A cDNA library of 5,350 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was produced and assembled into 838 contigs
and 4512 singletons. BLAST searches of relevant databases showed 30% hits and 70% no-hits, with toxin-related
transcripts accounting for 23% and 78% of the total transcripts and hits, respectively. Gene ontology analysis
identified non-toxin genes related to general metabolism, transcription and translation, processing and sorting,
(polypeptide) degradation, structural functions and cell regulation. The major groups of toxin transcripts identified
were metalloproteinases (81%), bradykinin-potentiating peptides/C-type natriuretic peptides (8.8%), phospholipases
A2 (5.6%), serine proteinases (1.9%) and C-type lectins (1.5%). Metalloproteinases were almost exclusively type PIII
proteins, with few type PII and no type PI proteins. Phospholipases A2 were essentially acidic; no basic PLA2 were
detected. Minor toxin transcripts were related to L-amino acid oxidase, cysteine-rich secretory proteins,
dipeptidylpeptidase IV, hyaluronidase, three-finger toxins and ohanin. Two non-toxic proteins, thioredoxin and
double-specificity phosphatase Dusp6, showed high sequence identity to similar proteins from other snakes. In
addition to the above features, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, microsatellites, transposable elements and
inverted repeats that could contribute to toxin diversity were observed.
Conclusions: Bothrops alternatus venom gland contains the major toxin classes described for other Bothrops
venoms based on trancriptomic and proteomic studies. The predominance of type PIII metalloproteinases agrees
with the well-known hemorrhagic activity of this venom, whereas the lower content of serine proteases and
C-type lectins could contribute to less marked coagulopathy following envenoming by this species. The lack of
basic PLA2 agrees with the lower myotoxicity of this venom compared to other Bothrops species with these toxins.
Together, these results contribute to our understanding of the physiopathology of envenoming by this species.

Studies of the global composition of snake venoms have
advanced dramatically in recent years with the introduction of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches for

analyzing venom gland gene expression and venom
composition [1-3]. The introduction of these two major
fields in toxinology has created new perspectives for
identifying novel molecules for drug discovery [4,5] and
for improving antivenom development and the clinical
treatment of snakebite [6-8]. A combination of these
two approaches can be particularly useful in providing a
more comprehensive understanding of venom composition [3,9-12].

Detailed transcriptomic studies of snake venom glands
began with the report of Junqueira-de-Azevedo and Ho
[13] who analyzed expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from
the venom gland of the Brazilian pitviper Bothrops insularis, a species endemic to the island of Queimada
Grande off the coast of the State of São Paulo in southeastern Brazil. Since then, venom gland transcriptomes
have been reported for various other South American
venomous snakes, including Bothrops species [11,14-16],
Crotalus durissus collilineatus (South American rattlesnake) [17], Lachesis muta (bushmaster) [18], Micrurus
corallinus (coral snake) [19] and the colubrid Philodryas
olfersii [20].
The genus Bothrops is responsible for most cases of
snakebite throughout Latin America [21] and in Brazil
accounts for 80-90% of bites by venomous snakes. Envenoming by Bothrops species results in extensive local
effects, including pain, edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and necrosis [22-24], as well as systemic actions
that include coagulopathy, internal hemorrhage, circulatory shock and acute renal failure [21,25-28]. These
actions are mediated by a variety of venom components,
with the most extensively studied being (hemorrhagic)
metalloproteinases [29] and myotoxic phospholipases A2
(PLA2) [23,30,31].
Bothrops alternatus occurs in southeastern and southern Brazil, Uruguay, central and northern Argentina and
south-eastern and southern Paraguay [32]. This species
is an important cause of snakebite, although the prevalence of bites varies considerably throughout its geographic distribution depending on the regional human
and snake population densities and the presence of
more abundant species such as Bothrops jararaca, the
major cause of snakebite in southeastern Brazil. Thus,
for example, notifications of bites by Brazilian Bothrops
spp. received by the Instituto Butantan from 1902-1945
(n = 4,881) suggest that B. alternatus accounts for ~6%
of bites by this genus [33]. In contrast, in a more recent
series of 3,139 cases attended at the Hospital Vital
Brazil, Instituto Butantan in São Paulo, from 1981-1990,
only two (0.14%) of the 1,412 cases in which the
Bothrops species was identified were caused by B. alternatus compared to 1,376 (97.5%) by B. jararaca [34]. In
regions where B. alternatus is more abundant or predominates (southern Brazil, Uruguay and parts of Argentina), this species contributes to much a greater
proportion of snakebites, e.g., 18% in Argentina, but
may be much higher locally (≥ 60% of snakebites in the
Argentinian province of Corrientes) [35].
Bothrops alternatus produces clinical manifestations
characteristic of this genus [21,28]. In a series of 32
cases involving this species [36], most of the patients
(74.2%) were 15-49 years old and were bitten in the
lower limbs (84.3%). All patients developed local pain,

Page 2 of 22

edema and most (31; 96.9%) had incoagulable blood, 13
(40.6%) developed hemorrhage, 7 (21.9%) had blisters
and 3 (9.4%) showed necrosis; there were no fatalities.
In addition, renal failure has been observed after bites
by this species in Uruguay [37]. The administration of
antivenom (produced by the Instituto Nacional de Producción de Biológicos - INPB in Argentina and the
Instituto Butantan, Fundação Ezequiel Dias or Instituto
Vital Brazil in Brazil) is the standard treatment for envenoming by B. alternatus. These antivenoms may be
bivalent (raised against B. alternatus and B. neuwiedii in
Argentina) or poplyvalent (raised against the clinically
most relevant Bothrops species in Argentina and Brazil B. alternatus, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, B. neuwiedi
and B. moojeni) [38,39]. In the case series studied by
Bauab et al. [36], a median of 40 ml of antivenom (four
10 ml ampoules) was administered.
Although B. alternatus venom contains a variety of
enzymatic and biological activities, relatively few of the
venom proteins involved have been purified and characterized, with most investigations having dealt with
metalloproteinases and disintegrins [40-50], PLA 2
[51-55], coagulant enzymes [56-58], L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) [59] and phosphodiesterase [60]. Despite
these investigations, the venom of B. alternatus is still
less understood than those of other Bothrops species
such as B. jararaca and B. jararacussu. In order to
obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the toxinology of this species, we have used a transcriptomic
approach to examine venom gland gene expression in
B. alternatus and compared the results with those for
other members of this genus.

Methods
Venom glands and RNA isolation

Venom glands from three adult B. alternatus snakes
were obtained three days after venom extraction. The
choice of this interval was based essentially on other
studies [16,17,61,62] that used this period, although
intervals of two [14] and four [11,13] days post-milking
have also been used for Bothrops species. The choice of
a 2-4 day post-milking interval prior to gland removal is
partly based on studies of venom mRNA and protein
synthesis in snake venom glands that show maximal
production 3-8 days post-milking [reviewed in [63]], and
partly on histological and functional studies in B. jararacussu [64] and B. jararaca [65], respectively, showing
that changes in gland epithelial morphology and venom
production peak around four days post-milking.
Each pair of venom glands was homogenized in liquid
nitrogen and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three cDNA libraries (one from
each snake) were independently constructed with

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

CloneMiner cDNA library construction kits (Invitrogen,
UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cDNA libraries were processed and analyzed using an
in-house bioinformatics pipeline, with all annotations
being done manually (contig by contig and singlet by
singlet) for each library. The production of three independent libraries meant that it was possible to undertake detailed analyses of SNPs, microsatellites and
inversions not generally done for Bothrops species since
in most studies the venom glands of different snakes are
usually combined into a single pool for mRNA extraction, with a subsequent loss of information.
This work was approved by the institutional Committee for Ethics in Animal Experimentation (CEEA/UNICAMP, protocol no. 864-1) and was done according to
the ethical guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Laboratory Animal Science (SBCAL, formerly the Brazilian
College for Animal Experimentation - COBEA).
Sequencing

The cDNA libraries were sequenced using BigDye terminator 3.0 kits and an automated DNA capillary
sequencer (ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All of the cDNA
sequences were 5’ sequenced using the primer M13F
(5’-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3’).
Clusterization, assembly and identification of Bothrops
alternatus expressed-sequence tags

The Phred program [66] was used to obtain sequences
and quality files from chromatograms obtained from
expressed-sequence tag (EST) sequencing. The EST
cleaning pipeline described by Baudet and Dias [67] was
then used to pre-process the ESTs and prepare the
sequences for assembly. This pipeline removes
sequences with plasmid similarity, polyA/polyT regions,
low base quality and slippage signals. Sequences
<100 bp long after cleaning were discarded. CAP3 software [68] was used to cluster and assemble the clean
sequences into contigs and singlets (unisequences). For
assembly, an overlap of 100 bp and an identity of at
least 95% were used as criteria to detect pairwise
similarities.
Annotation of Bothrops alternatus ESTs

After clustering and assembly, a BLAST search was
done to identify similarities between the ESTs and
sequences deposited in public databases. All of the
sequences were aligned against the GenBank non-redundant (nr) protein database using BLASTX and BLASTN
[69] with an E-value cut-off of 1e-5. The B. alternatus
ESTs were also screened against two locally generated
sequence databases, SerpP and SerpN, that included all
snake protein and nucleotide sequences from GenBank,

Page 3 of 22

respectively. In addition, the ESTs were compared with
the complete genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=anoCar1). Gene Ontology annotation was done with Blast2GO [70] using GO-slim terms. The uncharacterized
ESTs were examined for the presence of a signal peptide
by using SignalP 3.0 software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/SignalP/).
Sequence alignments

Sequence alignments for selected proteins were done
with the program ClustalW [71].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms

The software QualitySNP [72] was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Non-synonymous
and synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs and sSNPs, respectively)
were identified by detecting open-reading frames (ORFs)
of contigs with SNPs using the FASTA algorithm run
against the 2008 version of UniProt [73]. The possibility
of SNPs arising from artifacts during DNA sequencing
was minimized by the fact that the cDNA libraries were
prepared independently from three snakes and that we
used consensus sequences from contigs with at least
three reads from separate sequencing plates for which
the cDNA was prepared and the reactions run on different days. These procedures considerably reduced the
possiblity of artifacts derived from DNA sequencing and
strengthened our conclusions regarding the presence of
SNPs.
Identification of transposable elements and long inverted
repeats

Alignment of the unisequences to repetitive elements in
RepBase release 14.08 [74] was done with BLASTN that
was automated using in-house Perl scripts (available
upon request). The E-value cut-off was set at 1 × 10-10
and only alignments of at least 50 bp were considered
for unisequences. In addition, the alignments with database sequences had to show >80% identity over at least
10% of their lengths. To identify possible functional
integrations of transposable elements (TEs) into host
genes, we searched for chimeric transcripts between TEs
and protein-coding genes. Unisequences that aligned
with a TE in the database over 10% to 90% of their
sequence were used to match the sequence back to the
corresponding host gene by masking the element in the
sequence and querying the NCBI nr nucleotide database.
For tBLASTX remote searches, a minimum of 50% of
the sequence was required to be involved in the best hit,
with at least 70% identity.
Additional repeated elements that were not present in
RepBase were observed in some unisequences. These
novel elements were identified using the palindrome

program in the EMBOSS package [75]. Unisequences
that contained inverted repeats were identified by aligning each transcript against itself using BLASTN (E-value
cut-off of 1e-5) and then inspected visually to check for
alignments in opposite strands. The upper limit for mismatches between the two repeated segments was 10%.
Comparison of the B. alternatus EST library with other
Bothrops species

The pattern of gene expression in B. alternatus venom
gland was compared with EST data for other Bothrops
species (B. atrox [16], B. insularis [11,13], B. jararaca
[15] and B. jararacussu [14]) available in public databases, and with the major toxin classes detected by proteomic analyses of Bothrops venoms. In this comparison
and in the description of the different toxin groups discussed below, the relative percentages of the venom
gland EST categories were calculated as a percentage of
the overall (total) number of all ESTs identified, whereas
the relative percentages of the ESTs related to specific
toxin groups was calculated based on the total number
of toxin ESTs identified.

Figure 2 Size distribution of B. alternatus venom gland ESTs.
Most of the 5,350 ESTs were 500-800 bp in length.

cDNA libraries were generated from three pairs of B.
alternatus venom glands and analyzed using the pipeline
shown in Figure 1. A total of 5,350 valid unisequences
was obtained by single-pass sequencing and, after trimming, the lengths of the sequences ranged from 100 bp
to 848 bp (mean: 562 bp) (Figure 2). The ESTs were
assembled into 838 contigs and 4512 singletons. Thirty
percent of the sequences (1,605 ESTs) were hits, of
which 1,245 (23% of total ESTs and ~78% of hits) were
related to toxins; the remaining 70% (3,745 ESTs) were

no-hits. Figure 3 shows the proportion of hits and nohits for selected databases. The proportion of hits was
greater against the GenBank and SerpN nucleotide databases compared to the corresponding protein databases.
There was a particularly low number of hits in SerpP,
which likely reflects the limited number of non-venom
snake protein sequences available in public databases.
SignalP analysis identified 147 ESTs with signal peptides, 62 of which were related to snake toxins (37 for
PLA2, 7 for metalloproteinases, 6 for proteins related to
platelet glycoprotein 1b binding protein, 6 for proteins
related to ACF 1/2 b-chain, 4 for serine proteinases, and
1 each for disintegrins and bradykinin-potentiating peptides or BPPs), 50 were for other proteins and 35 were
for unknown proteins.

annotation of B. alternatus ESTs. A total of 12,479 unisequences
were generated from three libraries (B. alternatus libraries Ba1, Ba2
and Ba3). After trimming, 7,871 ESTs yielded 5,350 valid
unisequences.

Results and Discussion
Venom gland EST database

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

All of the ESTs were deposited in the dbEST division
of GenBank (accession numbers GW575430 to
GW583300).
Gene ontology (GO)

A global GO analysis [70] of unisequences in relation to
molecular function revealed that the largest number of
transcripts was related to protein binding, followed by
peptidase and transferase activities, calcium-binding,
enzyme regulation, nucleic acid binding, structural protein and transporter activities, lipid binding, and transcriptional regulation (Figure 4). Analysis of the
biological processes revealed two major groups arbitrarily
defined as those with >100 ESTs and those with ≤100
ESTs. The former contained genes related to stress,
responses to external stimuli, development, symbiosis,
cell differentiation, DNA metabolism, cell death and signal transduction, whereas the latter consisted of genes
related to catabolism, precursor biosynthesis, translation,
protein modification, transcription, lipid metabolism,
protein and ion transport, cytoskeletal organization, cell
proliferation and cell cycle (Figure 5). The biological processes identified here generally agreed with the broad
categories (general metabolism, transcription and translation, processing and sorting, (polypeptide) degradation,
structural functions and cell regulation) reported for
other Bothrops species [11,13-16] and L. muta [18].

Selected venom gland proteins
Venom gland receptors

We detected one transcript coding for a protein similar
to a 1D -adrenoceptor from B. jararaca. Since a- and
b-adrenergic mechanisms have an important role in
venom production in B. jararaca [76-78], principally
through receptors structurally related to a 1D - and
a1B-adrenoceptors [78], a similar regulatory mechanism
mediated by these receptors probably also occurs in
B. alternatus. Another receptor identified was vascular
endothelin type A (ET A ) receptor (one singlet). This
receptor mediates the vasoconstrictor activity of the
endothelin family of peptides in B. jararaca aorta [79]
and could be important in the regulation of vascular
tone in blood vessels irrigating the venom gland.
A contig was identified for a calglandulin-like EF-hand
protein. Venom gland calglandulin, initially identified in
B. insularis based on an EST analysis of this venom
gland [13] and subsequently cloned and expressed from
this species [80] (also detected in elapid venom glands
[9,81]), is a Ca2+-binding protein structurally similar to
calmodulin and troponin C. This protein, which is
venom gland-specific (not found in other snake organs
or venom) [80], may have a role in the transport and
secretion of venom toxins, in addition to possibly acting
as an intracellular Ca 2+ -chelator to regulate toxin
activity.

Dusp6

Dual specificity phosphatases (Dusp) have important
functions in embryogenesis, cell growth and immune
responses by acting as negative feedback regulators of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) [82]. DUSP6
has an important role in snake embryogenesis, with high
gene expression in the anterior part of the presomitic
mesoderm [83,84]. This protein has not previously been
detected in venom gland transcriptomes or in analyses
of venom composition. We detected a partial sequence
for DUSP6 protein that shared similarity with the corresponding protein from Pantherophis guttatus (corn
snake; accession number ABW82165) (Figure 6). The
role of DUSP6 in the venom gland is unclear but may
be related to development of the gland secretory epithelium and venom production.

active site disulfide of oxidized Trx to regenerate the
dithiol of reduced Trx is catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase, a selenium-containing flavoprotein [86]. Trx is also
involved in the reversible S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues in target proteins, an important step in signaling by
intracellular nitric oxide (NO). We found a protein
sequence in the B. alternatus transcriptome that was
related to Trx previously identified in venom gland
cDNA from O. hannah (accession number AAK09384)
(Figure 7). The function of Trx in venom glands is
unknown, but it may be involved in protecting epithelial
secretory cells of the gland from oxidative stress and
death (by necrosis or apoptosis), particularly since
venom components such as LAO can cause cell death
through the formation of H2O2 [87,88].

Thioredoxin

Venom components identified by ESTs

Thioredoxin (Trx) is a protein with a variety of activities, including roles in DNA synthesis, protein disulfide
bond reduction and the degradation of H2O2 that may
be related to protection against oxidative stress and the
induction of apoptosis [85]. Thioredoxin participates in
redox reactions through the reversible oxidation of its
active center dithiol to a disulfide, thereby catalyzing
dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions; the reduction of the

Figure 8 summarizes the venom components detected
based on EST analysis. The major classes detected were
metalloproteinases/disintegrins, BPP/C-type natriuretic
peptide (CNP) precursors, PLA2, serine proteinases and
C-type lectins. Genes expressed in lower abundance
included cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), taicatoxin-like protein, prothrombin activator, a catrocollastatin precursor and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV).

Major toxin classes
Metalloproteinases/disintegrins

Bothrops venoms are rich in a variety of snake venom
metalloproteinases (SVMPs) that contribute to local and
systemic bleeding after envenoming [21,28,29]. SVMPs
are currently classified in three major classes (PI, PII
and PIII, with the latter two containing five and four
subclasses, respectively) [89], with PIII metalloproteinases being particularly abundant and extensively studied in Bothrops venoms. Metalloproteinases were the
most abundant venom components in B. alternatus
venom gland (Figure 8) and were almost exclusively
class PIII proteins. SVMPs accounted for 1010 ESTs
that were grouped into 22 contigs, the most abundant
of which were related to jararhagin from B. jararaca,
Russell’s viper (Vipera russelli) venom factor × heavy
chain (RVV-X) and hemorrhagic factor 3 (HF3), also
from B. jararaca (all class PIII proteins) (Figure 9). Hits
were also obtained for Bothrops metalloproteinases such
as berythactivase from B. erythromelas, bothropasin
from B. jararaca and metalloproteinases II (Bojumet II)

and III (Bojumet III) from B. jararacussu. There was a
low number of transcripts for class PII proteins, including one transcript coding for contortrostatin and one
contig related to insularinase. No class PI SVMPs were
detected. The overwhelming abundance of transcripts
for class PIII SVMPs (with few PII and no PI SVMPs)
observed here agrees well with the results of a proteomic analysis of this venom in which only class PIII
SVMPs were detected [90]. Our finding of transcripts
related to jararhagin and berythactivase also agrees with
these authors who detected proteins related to these
two SVMPs in B. alternatus venom.
In agreement with the abundance of SVMP transcripts,
two PIII metalloproteinases have been isolated and characterized from this venom. Souza et al. [40] reported the
characterization of a 55 kDa PIII metalloproteinase
(alternagin) from Brazilian B. alternatus venom that can
undergo autolysis to release a 28 kDa ECD-disintegrinlike cysteine-rich domain (alternagin-C). Alternagin inhibits the binding of K562 cells to collagen by selectively
blocking a2b1 integrin, in a manner similar to jararhagin

from B. jararaca venom; this inhibitory action is apparently mediated by alternagin-C. Subsequently, Gay et al.
[44,45] also isolated alternagin (which they termed balteragin) from Argentine B. alternatus. This protein
causes edema, hemorrhage and necrosis when administered intramuscularly in mice, and systemic hemorrhage,

primarily in the lungs, kidneys and liver, when administered intravenously. Cominetti et al. [42] described the
characterization of a 130 kDa dimeric PIII metalloproteinase/RDG-disintegrin (BaG; monomeric form = 55 kDa)
from Brazilian B. alternatus venom. This enzyme, which
accounts for at least 0.2% of venom protein, inhibits

ADP-induced platelet aggregation via a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. BaG also blocks the
adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin (and detaches cells
previously adhered to this protein), a phenomenon
mediated by binding to a5b1 integrin, but has no effect
on the adhesion of these cells to collagen type I
(mediated by a2b1 integrin).
The processing of PII and PIII SVMPs gives rise to
RDG-disintegrins and ECD-disintegrin-like cysteine-rich
(DC) domains, respectively, that exert a variety of biological activities through interaction with cell surface
integrins [89]. In the B. alternatus ESTs, there were four
ESTs coding for disintegrins, and at least three disintegrins were identified in a proteomic analysis of this
venom [90]. As indicated above, autolysis of alternagin
gives rise to alternagin-C, an ECD-disintegrin-like
cysteine-rich domain [40]. Alternagin-C exerts a variety
of activities, including the induction of neutrophil
migration via integrin signaling [41], stimulation of
human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration [43,46]
and modulation of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo [47],
but has a limited beneficial effect on muscle regeneration [48]. More recently, another disintegrin (DisBa-01)
identified in a cDNA library from B. alternatus venom
gland, has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and melanoma mestastasis by interacting with avb3 integrin [49]
and prevents platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, thereby
prolonging bleeding time in mice [50]; the latter action
is mediated by interaction with platelet aIIbb3 integrin.

Bothrops venoms are rich in acidic and basic PLA2 with
Asp or Lys at position 49 in their active site. Many of
these PLA2 cause pain, edema, inflammation and myotoxicity [23,30], as well as neuromuscular blockade in
vitro [91]. The content of myotoxic PLA2 varies considerably among Bothrops species, e.g., B. asper, B. colombiensis, B. fonsecai, B. jararacussu, B. moojeni, B.
neuwiedi and B. pradoi have an elevated content of
these enzymes whereas others, such as B. alternatus, B.
atrox, B. cotiara, B. erythromelas and B. jararaca, have
few or no myotoxins [6,92-96]. In addition, some species, e.g., B. jararacussu [14,97] contain a variety of
PLA 2 in addition to myotoxins. PLA 2 accounted for
5.6% of B. alternatus venom components (1.28% of the
total EST library) (Figure 8). This PLA 2 content was
similar to that of B. insularis (6.7%) [13] and B. jararaca
(6.7%) [15], but considerably less than for B. atrox
(14.6%; [16]) and B. jararacussu (58%; [14]). The B.
alternatus PLA2 formed two major groups: those related
to BOTIN PLA2 (PA2-BOTIN or BinTX-I; SwissProt/
trEMBL accession number Q8QG87), one of two acidic
Asp49 PLA2 isoforms (BinTX-I = pI 5.05; BinTX-II = pI
4.49) characterized from the venom of B. insularis [98],
with 41 ESTs, and those related to an acidic (pI 4.5)
hypotensive Asp49 PLA2 (Q8AXY1) from B. jararacussu
venom [99], with 28 ESTs.
BinTX-I causes mouse hind-paw edema, as well as
myonecrosis and partial neuromuscular blockade in
chick biventer cervicis preparations [98]. Hence, it is
probable that the corresponding PLA2 in B. alternatus
venom exert similar effects. In contrast, the acidic hypotensive PLA2 from B. jararacussu is not myotoxic, cytotoxic or lethal but causes edema and hypotension, and
inhibits platelet aggregation [99]. Nisenbom et al.
[51,52] reported the characterization of an acidic (pI
5.04-5.08) PLA2 from B. alternatus that accounted for
most of the lethality of this venom in mice and produced cardiovascular alterations such as dyspnea, tachycardia, arrhythmia and circulatory shock, as well as
tissue damage (hemorrhage, necrosis, etc.). This enzyme
therefore shares properties with B. insularis and B. jararacussu PLA2.
Basic Lys49 PLA2s characteristic of Bothrops venoms
were not detected in this venom gland library, in agreement with a proteomic analysis of this venom [90] and
with EST analyses of B. insularis [13] and the bushmaster L. muta [18]. However, two ESTs coding for the
basic PLA2 of crotoxin (the principal neurotoxin of C. d.
terrificus; also identified in B. insularis ESTs; [13]) and
one transcript for the PLA2 b-neurotoxin ammodytoxin
(from Vipera ammodytes) were detected. The general
absence of basic Lys49 PLA2 in the B. alternatus transcriptome agrees with the very low content of myotoxic

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

PLA2 already reported for this venom [93,95]. Indeed, to
date, only one basic (pI 8.63) myotoxic Lys49 PLA2 has
been isolated and characterized from this venom
[54,55]. This PLA 2 , which accounts for <1% of the
venom content, causes mouse footpad edema, skeletal
muscle myonecrosis, lysis of C2C12 skeletal muscle
myoblasts and presynaptic neuromuscular blockade in
chick biventer cervicis and mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. However, given the very low level
of this PLA2 in the venom, its overall contribution to
the activities of the venom is likely to be minimal.
In addition to PLA 2 , inhibitors of this enzyme were
also detected (17 ESTs with hits only in the 3’UTR;
similar to PLA2 inhibitors of Trimeresurus flavoviridis).
Venom gland PLA 2 inhibitors show considerable
sequence identity with g-PLI (phospholipase inhibitors)
identified in snake sera, including that of B. alternatus
[100].
Serine proteinases

Coagulopathy is a major complication of systemic envenoming by Bothrops species that, in conjunction with
the action of venom metalloproteinases, can contribute
to systemic hemorrhage [21,28]. Coagulation disturbances caused by Bothrops venoms are mediated by a
variety of enzymes that act at various points of the coagulation cascade, including fibrinogen degradation and
fibrin consumption. The clinical outcome of this combined action is incoagulable blood. Some of the serine
proteinases may also have kinin-releasing activity that
can contribute to local pain, vasodilation and systemic
hypotension [101,102]. In the B. alternatus transcriptome, serine proteinases were the fourth most abundant
group of toxins (Figure 8) (1.9% and 0.45% of toxin and
total transcripts, respectively), with ~42% (10 ESTs)
being related to BthaTL, a serine proteinase identified in
this venom by Vitorino-Cardoso et al. [58] based on
gene cloning and amino acid sequence analysis. This
protein, which shares sequence identity (> 60%) with a
variety of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (TLE), is
probably the same as the TLE balterobin previously purified and characterized by Smolka et al. [57]. Other proteins in this group were related to serine proteinase
isoform 5 (7 ESTs), venom serum proteinase-like protein 2 precursor (5 ESTs) and venom serine proteinase
HS112 precursor (1 EST) and TLE (1 EST). In addition,
there was one transcript with a hit in a UTR for a protein similar to KN-BJ2, a kinin-releasing, fibrinogen clotting enzyme from B. jararaca venom [15,102,103]. The
range of serine proteinases identified here in ESTs
agrees with the presence of coagulant (BthaTL and several TLEs homologous to ancrod, batroxobin, proteinase
HS114 and pallase) and kinin-releasing enzymes identified in the proteome of this venom [90]. The abundance
of serine proteinases in the B. alternatus transcriptome

Page 10 of 22

was similar to the 2% reported for B. jararacussu [14]
but considerably less than in other species of this genus,
e.g., ranging from 8.2% in B. atrox [16] to 28.6% in B.
jararaca [15]. Differences in the relative proportion of
serine proteinases present in the venoms could contribute to variations in the severity of coagulopathy among
Bothrops species.
C-type lectins

Proteins with C-type lectin-like domains are widespread
in the animal kingdom, including venoms. Venom Ctype lectins form two major groups: true C-type lectins
with carbohydrate binding domains and C-type lectinlike proteins with non-carbohydrate binding domains,
the latter consisting mainly of factor IX/X binding proteins and proteins that interact with platelet receptors.
C-type lectins are involved in venom-induced coagulation disturbances and have been identified in various
Bothrops ESTs [11,13-16]. These proteins formed the
fifth most abundant class of toxin transcripts in B. alternatus (18 ESTs with protein, 1.46%, or 0.33% of the
total cDNA library) (Figure 8) and were related to the a
subunit of platelet glycoprotein Ib-binding protein (8
ESTs), the ACF 1/2 b chain (7 ESTs), coagulation factor
IX-binding protein (2 ESTs) and bothrojaracin (1 EST).
There was also a transcript for convulxin (one singlet in
the 3’UTR), a C-type lectin initially identified in the
venom of C. d. terrificus (also identified in B. insularis
ESTs; [13]). The abundance of C-type lectins was considerably less than in B. atrox (4.8%; [16]), B. insularis
(14.5%; [13]), B. jararaca (8.3%; [15]) and B. jararacussu
(5%; [14]); if these relative proportions are reflected in
the venoms, then C-type lectins may contribute less to
coagulopathy in bites by B. alternatus than by other
Bothrops spp.
Few proteins of this class have been characterized
from B. alternatus venom. Bothrojaracin, a 27 kDa heterodimer (13 kDa and 15 kDa) initially purified from B.
jararaca venom, is homologous to several C-type lectin
family proteins and inhibits thrombin activity, e.g., platelet aggregation and fibrinogen clotting, by interacting
with exosites I and II of this enzyme to form a noncovalent complex [104,105]. Castro et al. [56] characterized bothroalternin, a bothrojaracin-like protein, from B.
alternatus venom; this protein 27 kDa homodimer
cross-reacts with antibodies to bothrojaracin, shares
sequence identity (68-84%) with the a and b chains of
factor IX/X binding protein and botrocetin from B. jararaca venom, and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet
aggregation. Bothroalternin has also been detected in
the proteome of B. alternatus [90].
Sugar-binding lectins, which are related to C-type lectins, have been detected in some Bothrops ESTs
[11,14,16], but were not detected here or in B. jararaca
[15].

Bradykinin-potentiating peptide and C-type natriuretic
peptide precursors

Bothrops venoms have long been known to contain bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) that enhance
venom-induced hypotension by inhibiting angiotensinconverting enzyme, a pivotal enzyme in the formation of
angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor peptide) and degradation
of bradykinin (vasodilator peptide) [106]. Numerous
such peptides have since been identified in Bothrops
venoms ([107] and references therein), and cloning and
sequence analysis studies in the late 1990s identified
genes encoding BPPs in B. jararaca venom gland
[108,109]. These same studies also reported the presence
of genes encoding for C-type natriuretic peptides
(CNPs) that could contribute to venom-induced hypotension. Transcriptomic studies of Bothrops venom
glands have confirmed these findings and shown that
genes encoding these two peptides account for 6-20% of
venom toxin ESTs [11,13,15,16]. A similar percentage
(~9%) was observed here for B. alternatus (Figure 8), for
which 110 ESTs coded for BPP/CNP precursors (specifically the CNP region) while another 156 ESTs showed
similarities only in the 3’UTR. In contrast to the abundance of BPP/CNP transcripts detected in Bothrops spp.
by EST analysis, proteomic analyses have shown that
these peptides account for <1% of the venom protein/
peptide content [6,110], although in B. insularis the
venom BPP content is 10% [11]. A similar situation
applies to CNPs for which some peptidomic analyses
have detected no such peptides in venom, despite the
identification of transcripts in EST analyses, e.g., B. insularis [11] and L. muta ([111]; but cf. [10]) (see section
on ‘Inverted repeats’ below for additional comment on
CNP detection).
Minor toxin classes
Cysteine-rich secretory proteins

Snake venom cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs)
are 23-26 kDa proteins with a high content of cysteine
residues (16) that form eight disulfide bridges. CRISPs
are widespread in snake venoms and have been
detected in transcriptomic [11,13-16] and proteomic
[6,7,11,96,110,112,113] studies of Bothrops venoms,
where they account for 0.5-2% and 0-3.6% of venom
genes and toxins, respectively. In agreement with these
studies, we detected five ESTs with protein (0.4% of
toxin transcripts) for CRISPs in B. alternatus venom
gland. Although the role of venom CRISPs remains
poorly understood, several members of this family
block a variety of ion channels, including L-type Ca 2+
channels, cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels, voltageactivated K+ channels (Kv1.3), high-conductance Ca2+activated K+ channels (BCa) and the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca 2+ channel. Peichoto et al. [114]

Page 11 of 22

have recently shown that a CRISP from the venom of
the South American colubrid Philodryas patagoniensis
causes myonecrosis. Since myonecrosis is an important
local response to envenoming by Bothrops spp., including B. alternatus, it is possible that CRISPs could contribute to this activity.
Dipeptidylpeptidase IV

Dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) (also known as CD26)
has a wide distribution in snake venoms [115]. DPP IV
genes have been identified in the venom glands of B.
jararaca [15], Gloydius blomhoffii brevicaudus [116], L.
muta [18] and various Australian elapids [9]. Gasparello-Clemente and Silveira [117] reported DPP IV in
Bothrops venoms, with the highest activity in B. alternatus. In agreement with this, we detected a transcript
coding for DDP IV protein in B. alternatus. Venom
DPP IV, which has enzymatic properties similar to those
of other eukaryotic DPP IV [116], may contribute to
venom-induced cardiovascular alterations, possibly by
degrading endogenous peptides through association with
exosome-like vesicles in fresh venom [118], and possibly
by interfering with glucose homeostasis and the immune
and neuroendocrine systems [119]. DPP IV may also be
important in processing polypeptide precursors of
venom peptides, as suggested for wasp and bee venoms
[120,121].
Growth factors

Snake venom growth factors comprise primarily vascular
endothelial growth factor (svVEGF) and nerve growth
factor (NGF), both of which have been detected in
Bothrops ESTs [11,13-16]. We detected five ESTs for
VEGF similar to B. insularis VEGF [13,122], one EST
similar to L. muta VEGF [18] and one EST similar to C.
d. terrificus NGF. However, the proportion of growth
factor transcripts in B. alternatus was lower than in
other Bothrops ESTs. Junqueira-de-Azevedo et al. [122]
showed that svVEGF from B. insularis venom was able
to increase vascular permeability and suggested that this
protein could be involved in local and systemic vascular
responses to envenoming.
Hyaluronidase

Hyaluronidase, which has an important role in facilitating venom diffusion from the site of inoculation through
its degradation of hyaluronic acid in the extracellular
matrix, is widespread in Bothrops venoms [123]. However, hyaluronidase has not generally been detected in
transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of this genus,
perhaps because of its low level of expression in venom
glands. In agreement with this, we found only one EST
similar to truncated hyaluronidase from Bitis arietans in
the B. alternatus cDNA library.
L-Amino acid oxidase

L-Amino acid oxidase (LAO), which is widespread in
Bothrops venoms [124], exerts a variety of biological

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

activities, including interference with platelet aggregation, cytotoxicity and microbicidal activity [87,88]. These
deleterious effects are mediated largely via the production of H 2 O 2 during the oxidation of a-keto amino
acids. LAO accounts for 0.5-2.6% of toxin transcripts in
Bothrops venom gland transcriptomes [13-16] and has
been purified and characterized from these venoms [88].
In the case of B. alternatus, we detected seven ESTs for
this toxin in the nucleotide region: four of these were
related to LAO from B. jararaca and three were ESTs
in the 3’UTR related to Ophiophagus hannah LAO. In
contrast to this low transcript abundance, LAO
accounted for 6.9% of the venom proteins identified in a
proteomic analysis of B. alternatus venom [90]. LAO
purified from B. alternatus venom is an acidic (pI
~5.37), homodimeric (123 kDa) glycoprotein that
induces platelet aggregation, causes edema, is bactericidal and slightly hemorrhagic [59]; this enzyme may
contribute to the cytotoxicity of B. alternatus venom
in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
cells [125].
Three-finger toxins (3-FTx)

Three-finger toxins (3-FTx) consist predominantly of
elapid neurotoxins, including a-neurotoxins, cardiotoxins and fasciculins, and a variety of less well-characterized venom proteins [126,127]. Originally thought to
be restricted to elapids, 3-FTx have since been identified in crotalid [18,128] and colubrid [127,129,130]
venom glands. 3-FTx exert a variety of biological activities that include blockade of acetylcholine (nicotinic
and muscarinic) receptors, b-adrenergic receptors, Ltype calcium channels and integrins, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, and cardiotoxicity mediated by interation with phospholipids.
We identified 30 ESTs for 3-FTx in the B. alternatus
venom gland library (0.56% of total ESTs; 2.4% of toxin
ESTs) that shared 90% similarity with the intron II
region of the gene for 3FTx-3 from Sistrurus catenatus
edwardsi [128], but no hits with colubrid, elapid or L.
muta [18] 3-FTx. Pahari et al. [128] also noted that the
3-FTx nucleotide and protein sequences of S. c.
edwardsi bore no relationship to those of L. muta, a
finding confirmed by phylogenetic analysis that placed
the L. muta toxins distant from those of S. c. edwardsi.
Complete sequencing of the B. alternatus genes would
be helpful in determining the precise relationship
between these 3-FTx and those of S. c. edwardsi.
This is the first identification of 3-FTx genes in
Bothrops and, together with other studies, suggests that
this class of toxins may occur in a variety of New World
pitvipers, i.e., Bothrops [this study], Sistrurus [128] and
Lachesis [18] (based on transcriptomic analyses) and
Atropoides mexicanus (nummifer) (but not in Atropoides
picadoi) (based on proteomic analysis) [131]. However,

Page 12 of 22

transcriptomic analyses have not detected these toxins in
other New World pitvipers, e.g., Agkistrodon piscivorus
leucostoma [132] and C. d. collilineatus [17], or in Old
World pitvipers (Agkistrodon (Deinagkistrodon) acutus
[133,134]) and vipers (Bitis gabonica [61] and Echis species [12,135]). In addition to this inter-generic variation,
there is also intra-generic variation in the occurrence of
3-FTx. Thus, whereas 3-FTx have been detected in a
transcriptomic analysis of S. c. edwardsi [128], these toxins have not been detected in a proteomic analysis of
venoms from several members of this genus [136]. Likewise, A. mexicanus (nummifer) venom, but not that of
A. picadoi, contains 3-FTx [128]. Such variation may
reflect the low abundance of transcripts and proteins
(making their detection difficult) and/or the non-uniform
recruitment of these toxins into the venom proteome
[128]. This could explain why transcriptomic [11,13-16]
and proteomic [6,7,11,96,110,112,113,137] analyses have
generally not detected these genes and proteins in
Bothrops species.
The physiological relevance of 3-FTx to envenoming
by Bothrops species is unclear, particularly in view of
the low transcript abundance indicated by our results.
However, Bothrops venoms cause neuromuscular blockade in avian and mammalian nerve-muscle preparations
in vitro [138]. Although most of this activity has been
attributed to the action of basic myotoxic PLA2 [91], 3FTx could also contribute to this response through their
ability to interfere with neuromuscular transmission.
Ohanin

Envenoming by Bothrops species results in local pain at
the bite site [21,28]. Venom components implicated in
this phenomenon include PLA2, metalloproteinases and
serine proteinases that act via the release of endogenous
mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites (leucotrienes and prostaglandins), bradykinin, proinflammatory
cytokines and neuronal nitric oxide [23,24,26]. In contrast, little is known of the involvement of other
Bothrops venom proteins in this pain. The identification
here of 24 ESTs with hits in the 3’UTR of the precursor
for ohanin, an ~12 kDa hypolocomotion and hyperalgesic protein initially identified in the venom of the king
cobra, O. hannah, and part of the vespryn family of proteins [139,140], indicates that other venom proteins, in
addition to those indicated above, may be involved in
Bothrops venom-induced pain. Since its initial identification, ohanin (vespryn) has been found in Australian
elapids [9,141] and pitvipers such as A. acutus [133],
C. d. collilineatus [17] and L. muta [18]. Our finding is
the first report for ohanin in Bothrops venom glands.
Together, these reports indicate that ohanins (and vespryns in general) are likely to be widespread in snake
venoms where they may contribute to venom-induced
hyperalgesia.

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

Taicatoxin-like protein

We detected two ESTs coding for a protein related to
the serine proteinase inhibitor component of taicatoxin
(TCX), a multimeric protein composed of an a-neurotoxin-like peptide (8 kDa), a neurotoxin PLA2 (16 kDa)
and a serine proteinase inhibitor (7 kDa) (1:1:4 stoichiometry) initially isolated from the venom of the Australian taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus) [142,143].
TCX blocks high threshold, voltage-dependent calcium
channel currents in cardiac membranes and cultured
ventricular myocytes, although there may also be a role
for the PLA 2 activity in the action of this toxin
[143,144]. The role of putative TCX-like proteins in B.
alternatus is unclear but could contribute to the cardiovascular actions of this venom.
Other toxins

In addition to the foregoing toxins, we identified a low
number of hits for several other toxins with BLAST
results only in the nucleotide database. These hits
included toxins related to cardiotoxins (12 reads), a
muscarinic-like toxin (three reads) related to that of
Bungarus multicinctus, precursors similar to post-synaptic a-neurotoxin NTX-2 from Naja sputatrix (one contig) and neurotoxin 6, and a molecule related to cobravenom factor (one read).
Putative toxins

Snake venoms contain a variety of nucleotidases (phosphodiesterases, 5’-nucleotidase, acid and alkaline
phosphatases and ADP/ATPases) and nucleases (deoxyribonuclease - DNase and ribonuclease - RNase) that
have a potentially important role in envenoming, particularly in affecting platelet aggregation and cardiovascular responses (hypotension, vascular permeability)
[119,145]. In agreement with this, we obtained transcripts coding for a variety of genes related to some of
these proteins, including an acidic DNase similar to a
mouse DNAse IIa (lysosomal DNase) precursor (3
ESTs), ecto-5’-nucleotidases (one EST coding for the
enzyme in zebrafish, Danio rerio, and another transcript
coding for the same enzyme in horse, Equus caballus),
ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3
(two ESTs, one each for monkey, Macaca mulatta, and
mouse, Mus musculus) and an adenosine deaminase
related to Xenopus laevis enzyme (one transcript).
Although several of these genes have been detected in
other transcriptomic analyses [13,18,61,133,135], it is
currently unclear whether the corresponding proteins
are secreted into the venom or simply part of normal
intracellular metabolism in the venom gland. We have
purified phosphodiesterase [60], 5’-nucleotidase and an
acidic DNase (DNase II) (unpublished findings) from
B. alternatus venom, but since the structure of these
proteins is unknown it is unclear to what extent they

Page 13 of 22

share similarity with the proteins coded by the genes
identified in the venom gland ESTs. Ogawa et al. [146]
have recently shown that G. blomhoffi ecto-5’-nucleotidase is structurally similar to this enzyme from various
other vertebrates.
Other genes identified that could potentially be
involved in envenoming included a cytokine-like protein
(one EST similar to horse cytokine) (also identified in
other snake venom ESTs [61,133]) and tumor necrosis
factor (two ESTs similar to chicken, Gallus gallus, protein), both of which could contribute to the venominduced local inflammatory response.
Selected features of B. alternatus venom gland ESTs
Single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple repeats
(microsatellites)

Polymorphisms in the nucleic acid sequences of snake
venom proteins, particularly PLA2, have been identified
in several species [147,148]. These genetic modifications
arise from rapid gene duplication followed by single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with an increase in
non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that alter the
DNA sequence encoding the protein. Ohno et al. [147]
suggested that such alterations result in the rapid
appearance of novel toxins with different biological
activities. Our analysis revealed 132 putative SNPs in
the B. alternatus transcriptome, of which 31 (16 nonsynonymous and 15 synonymous substitutions) were
located in ORFs, as determined based on alignment
against the UniProt database. In addition, we identified
32 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) (Table 1;
Additional file 1). Although not extensively studied,
detailed analysis of venom protein SNPs could be useful
for population genetic studies and for assessing the
importance of rapid sequence changes in generating the
observed diversity of genes involved in venom production [148].
The screening of unisequences with the tandem
repeats finder tool resulted in the identification of 321
sequences with possible microsatellite regions; when
annotated sequences with transposable elements (TEs)
were excluded, 244 sequences with microsatellite regions
were identified (data not shown). These sequences could
be potentially useful for the development of molecular
markers for characterization of the genetic variability
and population structure of B. alternatus throughout its
geographic distribution.
Transposable elements

Eukaryotic genomes contain a large number of repeated
sequences, a high proportion of which may consist of
transposable elements (TEs). In snakes, TEs have been
previously identified in PLA 2 genes from the venom
gland of Vipera ammodytes [149,150]. These TEs are
ruminant retroposons corresponding to 5’-truncated

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/605

Bov-B long interspersed repeated DNA (LINE) and were
identified in ammodytin L (a natural mutant of a group
II PLA2) and ammodytoxin C (similar structure to other
mammalian group II PLA2) genes. Alignments meeting
our criteria (see Methods) allowed the identification of
repeated elements in 492 unisequences, which corresponded to 9% of the B. alternatus ESTs (Additional file
2); (retro)transposons have also been identified in B.
insularis [13] and L. muta [18]. Several TE families were
identified among the B. alternatus transcripts, the most
abundant being BovB, which was identified in 120 unisequences (Table 2). The expression of these TE families
indicated that the genome harbored a large number of
potentially active elements that gave rise to a variety of
ESTs.
Further examination of the 492 unisequences harboring
TEs revealed that 193 of them were fused to a sequence
not included in the repeats database. To determine the
identity of these sequences, we masked the TEs and
BLASTed the masked unisequences against the GeneBank nr database. This approach revealed that in 80
unisequences, the TE was fused to a protein-coding
gene (Additional file 3). Most transposition events involving protein-coding regions are deleterious to host genomes because they disrupt mRNA translation,
localization and stability. However, since TEs associated
with PLA 2 genes have been found to be transcribed
[136,137], we hypothesize that the TEs in B. alternatus
may act as a source of genetic novelty by playing an
important role in the origin and diversity of toxin genes.
Inverted repeats

The alignment of B. alternatus unisequences to corresponding reference genes indicated that some of the
genes contained long inverted repeats (IR) in which a
segment of the sequence was inverted from its original
orientation in the reference gene (Additional file 4). An
interesting example of such inversions involved genes
for BPPs/CNPs, for which 16 unisequences with
inverted repeats were observed (data not shown). Figure
10 shows the case in which an IR occurred in a portion
of mRNA coding for part of a CNP. As mentioned
above in the discussion of CNP genes, although EST
studies have indicated the presence of genes for these
peptides in Bothrops and Lachesis species, proteomic
studies have not always been successful in isolating and
identifying these peptides [11,111]. The reason for this
discrepancy between EST and proteomic findings has
not been adequately addressed but one explanation
could be related to the occurrence of IR in these genes
that may interfere with adequate gene transcription and/
or translation in vivo, thereby preventing toxin
production.
The origin of such IR transcripts is unclear. Theoretically, they could be artifacts generated by end-to-end

joining of non-contiguous cDNA sequences and template switching by reverse transcriptase during cDNA
synthesis; template switching can artificially delete portions of cDNAs and be wrongly interpreted as alternative transcripts. During first strand cDNA synthesis,
poly(A)+ RNAs are primed by an oligo(dT) and when
the reverse transcriptase reaches the 5’-end of the junction site in the mRNA, the nascent cDNA switches the
template to the IR in the antisense mRNA that will now
be used as a new template. However, since the homologous recombination between two RNA templates promoted by reverse transcriptase requires RNase H
activity, and since the PowerScript™ Reverse Transcriptase used here for cDNA synthesis lacked RNase H
activity, it seems unlikely that homology-dependent template switching could have generated these hybrid
cDNAs artificially.
Further reasons that the IR observed here are unlikely
to be artifacts include the following: 1) end-to-end joining during library construction would randomly ligate
molecules and one would expect not only intra-molecular hybrids but also ligation of independently transcribed
mRNAs, 2) in the case of an artifact, the transcript of
highest abundance would be expected to be frequently
ligated to other transcripts to form inter-molecular
hybrids, but this was not observed in our library, and 3)
the finding that the same ESTs containing inversions
were present in multiple sequence reads from the same
library and in independent libraries. Together, these
observations suggest that this phenomenon was not an
artifact.
Comparison of the B. alternatus transcriptome with other
Bothrops species

Following the initial report of gene expression analysis
in the venom gland of B. insularis ([13], recently
updated by Valente et al. [11]), similar studies were
reported for other Bothrops species, including B. atrox
[16], B. jararaca [15] and B. jararacussu [14]. The availability of data for several Bothrops species provides an
opportunity to compare related species and draw some
general conclusions regarding venom composition in
this genus. Few such transcriptomic comparisons are
available for other genera [135].
To date, our study represents the largest EST database
for Bothrops; the 5,350 ESTs reported here considerably
exceed those reported for B. atrox (610) [16], B. insularis (initially 610, but updated to 2042) [11,13], B. jararaca (2318) [15] and B. jararacussu (549) [14]. We
chose to generate a larger database than those previously reported for Bothrops species in an attempt to
identify novel genes in addition to the main toxin
groups already known for this genus. Indeed, this larger
database allowed the detection of genes for toxins such

as ohanin and 3-FTx, previously identified in other
snake genera but not in Bothrops, in addition to nonvenom proteins such as DUSP6 and thioredoxin.
The generation of a large database for B. alternatus
did not significantly alter the profile of the most common toxin groups (metalloproteinases, BPPs/CNPs,
PLA2, serine proteinases, C-type lectins, growth factors,
etc.) when compared with other Bothrops species. This
finding suggests that a large database is not essential for

identification of the major toxin groups but can be useful for increasing the chances of detecting toxins with
very low transcript abundance. This conclusion agrees
with data for B. insularis in which increasing the EST
database from 610 [13] to 2042 [11] ESTs did not markedly alter the relative proportions of metalloproteinases
(41.7% vs. 43.2%, for 610 vs. 2042 ESTs), BPPs/CNPs
(19.7% vs. 15.8%), C-type lectins (14.6% vs. 14.2%), serine proteinases (9.6% vs. 11.2%), PLA2 (6.7% vs. 5.4%),

svVEGF (4.3% vs. 4.7%), LAO (2.6% vs. 3.5%), CRISPs
(0.6% vs. 1.5%) and NGF (0.3% vs. 0.4%). In the present
study, 78% of the hits corresponded to toxin transcripts,
which compares favorably with values for other Bothrops
species (54% - 78%) [11,13-16] and indicates that the
relative proportion of toxin transcripts is not directly
related to the size of the cDNA library.
Conversely, the generation of a large database resulted
in a considerably greater number of no-hits: 70% in this
study compared to 13% - 25% for other Bothrops studies

Page 16 of 22

[11,13-16] and 7% - 54% for other snake genera
[12,18-20,61,128,132-135]. These no-hits reflect the limited amount of information available for Bothrops species and other snakes in venom gland EST databases,
and represent a potentially rich source for the identification of novel toxins.

Figure 11 Relative abundance of the major toxin classes in
Bothrops venom glands determined by transcriptomic analysis.
Abundance is expressed as a percentage of the total toxin
transcripts and was calculated by dividing the number of ESTs for
each toxin family by the total number of toxin ESTs reported in
each study. This standardization allowed direct comparisons across
studies. Data sources other than B. alternatus were: B. atrox [16], B.
insularis [11], B. jararaca [15] and B. jararacussu [14].

and C-type lectins, with less abundant groups being
LAO, CRISPs and growth factors (principally svVEGF
and NGF). There was considerable inter-specific variation in the content of the major toxin. Thus, B. alternatus had the highest proportion of metalloproteinase

Page 17 of 22

transcripts among the five species, being more than
three-fold more abundant than in B. jararacussu. PLA2
abundance was similar to B. insularis, greater than
B. jararaca but less than B. atrox and B. jararacussu;
the latter species was the only one in which PLA2 transcripts were more abundant than metalloproteinases
(at least two-fold greater). The proportion of BPP/CNP
transcripts in B. alternatus was similar to B. atrox and
B. jararaca but about half that of B. insularis, while serine proteinases and C-type lectins were generally less
abundant than in other Bothrops species. As indicated
above, a lower content of serine proteinases and C-type
lectins in the venom could account for the less severe
coagulopathy observed clinically for envenoming by
B. alternatus compared to other Bothrops species [36].
Despite the inter-specific variation in the relative proportion of toxin classes, these findings confirm that
most Bothrops venom components can be classified into
a few major groups. This conclusion agrees with proteomic analyses of Bothrops venoms that have also identified these groups as the major toxin families
[6,7,11,90,96,97,110,112,113,137] (Figure 12). In addition
to inter-specific variation, these proteomic studies have
also reported individual, age-dependent and geographic
variation in the toxin content of these major classes
[110,112,137].
For five Bothrops species (B. alternatus, B. atrox,
B. insularis, B. jararaca and B. jararacussu) there are

expressed as a percentage of the total number of toxins identified in each analysis. Data sources were: B. alternatus [90], B. asper (Pacific

Cardoso et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:605

transcriptomic and proteomic analyses that allow comparison of the toxin frequencies in the different
classes. For metalloproteinases and PLA2, there is reasonably good agreement between the proportion of
transcripts and the corresponding levels of these proteins detected in the venoms, whereas for other
classes, e.g., BPPs, C-type lectins and serine proteinases, there are often marked discrepancies between
the transcriptomic and proteomic data (cf. Figures 11
and 12). In the case of B. alternatus, there was good
agreement between the proportion of ESTs (this
study) and venom content [90] of PLA2 (5.5% vs 7.8%,
respectively) and C-type lectins (1.4% vs. 1.7%), but
considerable divergence between these two data sets
in the case of metalloproteinases (81.4% vs. 43.1%),
serine proteinases (1.9% vs. 24.1%) and LAO (0.6% vs.
6.9%) [this study and ref. [90]]. Divergent transcriptomic and proteomic results have also been observed
for certain toxin groups in other snake genera, e.g.,
Echis species [12] and L. muta [10]. The causes and
implications of such discrepancies have been discussed
elsewhere [3] and indicate the need for caution in
interpreting transcriptomic data as being representative of the final venom composition.
Finally, it should be noted that the principal toxin
classes identified by transcriptomic and proteomic
analyses are those that have been shown to contribute
to the major local and systemic effects produced by
these venoms, i.e., potent hemorrhagic activity
(mediated by metalloproteinases), extensive myonecrosis (myotoxic PLA2), inflammatory responses (metalloand serine proteinases, PLA 2 ), coagulopathy (C-type
lectins, serine proteinases, disintegrins) and cardiovascular actions (metalloproteinases, PLA2, serine proteinases such as kallikrein-like enzymes, and peptides
such as BPPs) seen experimentally and clinically
[21,22,26-30].

Conclusions
An EST database containing 5,350 ESTs was produced
for the venom gland of B. alternatus, the largest to date
for the genus Bothrops. The venom gland expressed the
major toxin groups (metalloproteinases, PLA 2 , serine
proteases, C-type lectins and BPP/CNPs) identified in
transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of other Bothrops
species. In addition, genes for toxins (ohanin, 3-FTx and
taicatoxin-like protein) and non-venom components
(Dusp6 and thioredoxin) not previously detected in
Bothrops venoms were also observed in this gland. The
results described here expand our understanding of the
composition of B. alternatus venom and help to explain
the major symptoms associated with envenoming by this
species.
