SHORT REPORT

A specific insertion of a solo-LTR characterizes the
Y-chromosome of Bryonia dioica (Cucurbitaceae)
Short Report

Abstract
Background: Relatively few species of flowering plants are dioecious and even fewer are known to have sex
chromosomes. Current theory posits that homomorphic sex chromosomes, such as found in Bryonia dioica
(Cucurbitaceae), offer insight into the early stages in the evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes. Little is
known about these early steps, but an accumulation of transposable element sequences has been observed on the Ychromosomes of some species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Recombination, by which transposable
elements are removed, is suppressed on at least part of the emerging Y-chromosome, and this may explain the
correlation between the emergence of sex chromosomes and transposable element enrichment.
Findings: We sequenced 2321 bp of the Y-chromosome in Bryonia dioica that flank a male-linked marker, BdY1,
reported previously. Within this region, which should be suppressed for recombination, we observed a solo-LTR nested
in a Copia-like transposable element. We also found other, presumably paralogous, solo-LTRs in a consensus sequence
of the underlying Copia-like transposable element.
Conclusions: Given that solo-LTRs arise via recombination events, it is noteworthy that we find one in a genomic
region where recombination should be suppressed. Although the solo-LTR could have arisen before recombination
was suppressed, creating the male-linked marker BdY1, our previous study on B. dioica suggested that BdY1 may not lie
in the recombination-suppressed region of the Y-chromosome in all populations. Presence of a solo-LTR near BdY1
therefore fits with the observed correlation between retrotransposon accumulation and the suppression of
recombination early in the evolution of sex chromosomes. These findings further suggest that the homomorphic sex
chromosomes of B. dioica, the first organism for which genetic XY sex-determination was inferred, are evolutionarily
young and offer reference information for comparative studies of other plant sex chromosomes.
Background
The origin and evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes have long interested biologists. Dioecy, a precondition for sex chromosomes where the male and female
functions are separated onto different individuals, is
common in animals but relatively rare among flowering
plants, occurring in only about 6% of species [1]. Sex
chromosomes in flowering plants are even less common,
with only a handful of species known to have them [2,3].
Molecular clock dating and the observation that some of
these species (e.g., papaya) still have homomorphic gonosomes, suggest that plant sex chromosomes are evolutionarily young [4,5].

Most of what we know about the evolution of sex chromosomes in flowering plants is derived from research on
a few model systems. Molecular level investigations in
Rumex, Silene and Carica have yielded a wealth of data
[6]. In Fragaria, there is evidence of at least some recombination between the sex-determining loci, a hallmark of
incipient sex chromosomes, offering support for models
of the gradual evolution of sex chromosomes [4,7,8].
Nevertheless, the early steps in the evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes remain unclear as direct evidence is rare [9]. An empirical correlation observed is the
accumulation of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences on the Y- (or W-) chromosome [10].
Transposable elements are ubiquitous components of
all genomes. In angiosperms, they make up a particularly
large component of genomes and are mostly long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in the Copia or Gypsy

superfamilies [11]. Like all retrotransposons, LTR-retrotransposons move intracellularly by a replicative mechanism similar to that of retroviruses and transpose
through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate.
LTR-retrotransposons in particular tend to transpose
into other LTR-retrotransposons [12-14]. Removal of retrotransposon DNA from the plant genome is thought to
require recombination [15]. One such mechanism for
removal, unequal homologous recombination, involves
recombination between the two LTRs of an LTR-retrotransposon resulting in a solo-LTR [16], making the
presence of a solo-LTR a signal of recombination. Conversely, one would expect accumulation of retrotranspon
sequences, but not solo-LTRs, where recombination is
suppressed, such as on the Y-chromosome [17]. The
emerging picture appears, however, to be more complex.
In Silene latifolia, Copia-like retrotransposons are not
preferentially accumulated on the sex chromosomes, but
are enriched on the Y- compared to the X-chromosome
[18-20]. In Rumex acetosa, specific transposable elements
accumulate on the two versions of the Y-chromosome
[21,22]. Non-LTR retroelements have been found in the
terminal region of the long arm of the Y-chromosome of
Cannabis sativa [23]. In Carica, which has homomorphic
sex chromosomes, the male-specific Y-region is differentiated from the corresponding region on the X-chromosome by an accumulation of transposable elements and
inverted repeats [24], suggesting that retrotransposon
accumulation begins very early in the establishment of
sex chromosomes. Here we report findings from Bryonia
dioica (Cucurbitaceae), a species with homomorphic sex
chromosomes, in which we have found a complex association of two LTR-retrotransposons.
The cucurbit Bryonia dioica was the first organism for
which an XY sex-determination system was inferred from
the sex ratios obtained in reciprocal crosses between the
dioecious B. dioica and the monoecious B. alba [25,26]. A
phylogeny [27] and biogeographic study [28] of the ten
species of Bryonia indicate that dioecy may have reevolved in the lineage leading to B. dioica, implying that
the homomorphic sex chromosomes are evolutionarily
young (i.e., a few million years old). In our previous paper
[29], we found that the male-linked marker BdY1 may not
lie in the zone of recombination-suppression on the Ychromosome in all populations, suggesting a recent origin. A second marker, BdX1, was common to both male
and females, but was highly similar in sequence to BdY1,
differing mainly by the presence of a large insertion. In
this study we used BdY1 as an anchor point to perform
chromosome walking along the Y-chromosome of B. dioica, which revealed a Copia-like element within which a
solo-LTR is inserted. We also recovered the consensus
sequence of the underlying Copia-like retrotransposon
via genome walking within which we found solo-LTRs

inserted at multiple, presumably paralogous locations,
one of which created BdY1 and thus characterizes the Ychromosome.

Results
We sequenced 415 bp upstream and 1649 bp downstream
of the SCAR marker BdY1 described in Oyama et al. [29]
on the Y-chromosome of Bryonia dioica. Within this
sequence (hereafter CW278-Y), which has been submitted to GenBank [GenBank:HM365927], we found an
LTR-retrotransposon. We identified the open reading
frame (ORF) and, using specific primers for the coding
region, continued sequencing the retrotransposon via
genome walking. This consensus sequence of the underlying retrotransposon (hereafter RLC-sequence) had a
final consensus length of 5008 bp [GenBank:HM365926].
A BLASTn [30,31] search in the TREP database [32]
with CW278-Y found the highest similarity to an element
from the Angela family of LTR-retrotransposons in the
Copia superfamily [33], while a BLASTn search in GenBank yielded similarity to a Copia-like element from
Cucumis
(Cucurbitaceae)
[GenBank:GQ326556].
BLASTx analyses of the translated amino acid sequence
from the RLC-sequence in GenBank also found similarity
to elements in the Copia superfamily. Conserved domain
search analysis [34] demonstrated that this transposable
element encodes a polyprotein with a CCHC zinc
knuckle (gag) domain (position 1890-1934 on the RLCsequence, amino acids 254-268), an integrase core (rve)
domain (position 2616-3098 on the RLC-sequence, aa
496-656) and a reverse transcriptase (RVT-2) domain
(position 3600-4361 on the RLC-sequence, aa 823-1077).
Because we could not identify a protease domain, we
assume that this element is inactive. That the domains
within the polyprotein (pol) gene are arranged in the
order rve/RVT also supports assignment to the Copia
superfamily.
A putative solo-LTR of 772 bp was identified in
CW278-Y beginning at position 584 of the sequence. This
was done by aligning the CW278-Y sequence to the
Copia-like element from Cucumis found in BLASTn
searches (see Figure 1). The solo-LTR is flanked by 5-bplong direct but incomplete repeats (GTCGG at the 5'end
and GTCG at the 3'end) representing the target-site
duplication and contains the 5'-terminal and 3'-terminal
sequences 5' TG...CA 3'. This insertion event corresponds
to the male-linked SCAR marker BdY1 described in
Oyama et al. [29]. Multiple, presumably paralogous insertion sites within the RLC-sequence could be detected by
PCR using internal primers specific to the solo-LTR, the
5'-LTR and the coding region. One of these additional
events corresponds to the BdX1 sequence described in
Oyama et al. [29] and the remainder were named α, β, γ
and δ (see Figure 2).

position numbers at which each insertion begins are in reference to the consensus sequence of RLC_XXX_Bryonia (RLC-sequence), the common Copia-like element in which the solo-LTRs are found. The coding region begins at bp 1131.

Southern blot analysis on male and female plants using
1110 bp of the 5' ORF containing the Gag domain as a
hybridization probe revealed no significant differences
between the two sexes. All digests exhibit strong signals
showing the high copy number of these elements in both
males and females. Because of EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites in the 5'-LTR and in the coding region, digestion
with these enzymes results in single bands of, respectively, 2 kb and 4.4 kb (Figure 3a). The distinct fragments
observed by HaeIII restriction (Figure 3a) are compatible
with the single HaeIII recognition site in the 5'-LTR
revealed by sequencing.
A more complex profile was observed in Southern blots
that used the solo-LTR as the probe (Figure 3b). Hybridization patterns in all digests revealed strong smears over
the whole lane rather than strong bands, suggesting the
existence of many copies of the solo-LTR or the corresponding transposable element in random positions in
the genome. However, some digests, such as HindIII,
show a degree of conservation of this LTR family by the
presence of a few, more intense bands of varying sizes.
These results are consistent with results from rice using

(lanes 1 and 4), EcoRI (lanes 2 and 5), and HaeIII (lanes 3 and 6).

Southern blots, which found some elements to exist in
relatively low copy numbers [35,36], and with the observation that LTR retrotransposons are otherwise highly
represented in the genome of plants [11].

Discussion
The first male-linked molecular marker in Bryonia dioica, reported by Oyama et al. [29], is the result of the
insertion of one LTR-retrotransposon into another and
the subsequent conversion of the inserted element into a
solo-LTR. In our earlier paper, a second sequence was
also recovered from both males and females that
appeared to have an insert relative to the male-linked
marker BdY1 but was otherwise alignable. This second
sequence appears to result from a paralogous insertion of
the element that gave rise to the solo-LTR about 200 bp
downstream of the male-linked one. Since the reverse
SCAR primer lies inside the solo-LTR, the PCR primerbinding site is effectively moved 200 bp downstream, giving rise to the second PCR band.
A minimum of four other, presumably paralogous, soloLTRs appear in the underlying retrotransposon sequence.
Such multi-layered insertion events have also been
observed in maize [14] and probably result from the tendency of LTR-retrotransposons to insert into other LTRretrotransposons [37]. Since solo-LTRs are the remnants
of intact LTR-retrotransposons that were removed via
unequal homologous recombination, this means that the
underlying Copia-like retrotransposon is older than the
solo-LTR. Considering that transposable elements are
silenced and begin to accumulate mutations quickly [24],
one probable reason why we cannot identify the proteinase domain of the Copia-like element is that the necessary motif is too degraded.
Methylation is thought to be important in regulating
both the activity of transposable elements and recombination. Most of the transposable elements in plant
genomes have been heavily methylated, and this is
thought to be the mechanism by which the host genome
deactivates the transposons [24]. At the same time, methylation is known to suppress recombination [38], the

Oyama et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/166

mechanism by which transposable elments would otherwise be eliminated from the genome. With respect to the
evolution of sex chromosomes, the suggestion has been
made that the accumulation of transposable elements,
through their tendency to become methylated, may be
what leads to the initial suppression of recombination
and allows for the linkage of sex-determining genes [39].
The suppression of recombination would also prevent the
removal of transposon sequences, causing the nonrecombining gonosome (e.g., the Y-chromosome) to
appear to accumulate transposable element sequences.
Stress is known to be an activator of LTR-retrotransposons [24] and may relate to the repeated shifts between
monoecy and dioecy among the ten species of Bryonia
[27]. The range expansion of B. dioica into northern
Europe following the last glacial maximum [28] could
have been associated with cold stress and enhanced
transposon activity. Population genetic analyses of the
male-linked marker BdY1 throughout northern and
southern Europe seemed to detect ongoing recombination in southern Europe [29]. It could be, however, that
the recombination detected is actually a signal of transposition, given that the region flanking BdY1 is a hybrid
of the underlying Copia-like element and the inserted
solo-LTR.

Conclusions
The interesting aspect of the solo-LTR indel event
described here is that it is male-linked and located in the
non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome. That our
walk along the Y-chromosome recovered sequence of a
Copia-like retrotransposon is congruent with the prevalence of this element in the plant genome, and nesting of
LTR-retrotransposons within each other has also been
seen previously [14]. However, in light of current theory
about sex chromosome evolution, these results may help
illuminate the early steps from autosome to sex chromosome; they imply that the recombination event leading to
the solo-LTR and the suppression of recombination that
would allow this area to be a male-linked marker
occurred close together in evolutionary time. Whether
the two events are merely correlated or causally linked
remains to be clarified. Nevertheless, that a solo-LTR,
formed by recombination, is male-linked and characterizes the Y-chromosome, where recombination should be
suppressed, provides an interesting insight into the early
stages of the evolution of sex chromosomes.
Methods
Development of male-linked SCAR marker

The development of the original male-linked SCAR
marker (BdY1) that served as the anchor point for the
chromosome walking was described in Oyama et al. [29]
and is only summarized here. An AFLP library was cre-

Page 5 of 7

ated for each sex of Bryonia dioica that pooled DNA from
eight individuals. This library was filtered and screened
for male-linked bands. Putative male-linked bands were
confirmed by repeating the procedure for several individuals of each sex. These male-linked bands were isolated
and sequenced. SCAR primers were designed from the
AFLP sequence, and PCR was performed using these
primers and genomic DNA from multiple male and
female individuals of B. dioica and other Bryonia species.
Sequencing the 5' and 3' regions flanking BdY1

DNA was extracted from young Bryonia dioica male and
female leaves following the cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) based method [40]. To determine 5'and 3'-flanking sequences of BdY1, a library was constructed with the GenomeWalker Universal Kit (Clontech
Laboratories, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, genomic DNA
was digested with EcoRV, DraI and SspI and DNA fragments were ligated with a GenomeWalker adaptor supplied in the kit. This GenomeWalker library was used as a
template for PCR with an adaptor primer and a gene-specific primer. The PCR mixture was diluted and used as a
template for a secondary or "nested" PCR with the nested
adaptor primer and a nested gene-specific primer. Cycle
conditions for the first PCR: 1 cycle of 3 min at 94°C, 39
cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 59°C and 3 min at 68°C for
amplification, and 1 cycle of 10 min at 68 °C for final
extension. Cycle conditions for the second PCR: 5 cycles
of 25 s at 94°C, 3 min at 72°C, 20 cycles of 25 s at 94°C, 3
min at 67°C for amplification and 67°C for 10 min after
the final cycle. All PCR mixtures contained 1.25 Units
Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany [Qiagen]), 1× Taq buffer, 15 mM MgCl2, 10 mM of
each dNTP and 10 pmol of each primer in a total volume
of 50 μl. Gene-specific primers (GSP) are listed in Table 1.
Amplicons were purified for sequencing and sequencing
reactions were performed with the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California [ABI]). The cycle sequencing products
were cleaned by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and fragments were separated
on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyser capillary sequencer.
Sequences were assembled and edited with Sequencher
4.2 (Gene Codes Cooperation, Ann Arbor, Michigan).
Southern Analysis

For Southern analysis, total cellular DNA from Bryonia
dioica male and female tissues were extracted using the
protocol of Fulton et al. [41]. Equal amounts of DNA
were digested with HindIII, EcoRI and HaeIII, separated
electrophoretically on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to
a Biodyne B nylon membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory,
Ann Arbor, Michigan). Hybridizations were performed
under high stringency conditions for 24 h at 60°C using
