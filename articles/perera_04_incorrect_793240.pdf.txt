Abstract
Background: Human enterovirus 71 has emerged as an important pathogen in the Asia Pacific
region and it is important to be able to make a rapid and specific diagnosis for outbreak control.
Recent Asian strains of Coxsackievirus A16 have changes in the VP1 gene which causes mispriming
of widely used primers for human enterovirus 71 specific identification.
Methods: Local strains of Coxsackievirus A16 were sequenced in the VP4 and VP1 genes and using
sequence alignment tools, an improved set of primers were designed for specific identification of
human enterovirus 71. These primers were evaluated against virus isolates as well as primary
clinical specimens.
Results: A total of 218 virus strains were tested. All 39 human enterovirus 71 isolates were
positive and none of the 38 Coxsackievirus A16, 127 other enteroviruses and 14 prototype
flaviviruses and adenoviruses were positive when tested with the new primers. When aliquots of
primary specimens known to have yielded human enterovirus 71 were retrospectively tested, we
found that within 2 months of collection of the specimens, greater than 90% were positive but that
the success rate diminished rapidly to 18% after 2 years storage.
Conclusions: Our new primers will be useful in rapid diagnosis of human enterovirus 71 infection,
and can also be used as a screening tool in surveillance programmes for early warning of human
enterovirus 71 transmission.

Background
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an unremarkable illness that commonly occurs in young children. This
condition is caused by human species A enteroviruses [1]
most commonly Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) but has
more recently been associated with human enterovirus 71
(HEV71) which can also cause neurological complica-

tions [2]. In the most common manifestation which gives
the syndrome its name, children typically present with
vesicular exanthema on the soles of their feet, the palms
of their hands and in their mouths, causing discomfort
and feeding difficulties. CVA16 and HEV71 are also associated with herpangina, but this is often also caused by
other species A enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus A8

(CVA8) and Coxsackievirus A10 (CVA10). Etiological
diagnosis of HFMD and herpangina has classically been
dependent upon isolation of viruses and the identification of these either by neutralization tests using LimBenyesh-Melnick (LBM) pools or monospecific antisera as
well as by immunofluorescence tests using serotype specific monoclonal antibodies [3,4]. There are at least 66
human enteroviruses known and the cost and labour
involved in making a specific identification is high for a
syndrome which is generally very mild. Thus the need for
virological investigations for HFMD and herpangina has
not been considered a necessity by most clinicians, and it
is therefore not surprising that not very much effort has
been placed on the development of type specific rapid
tests for the viruses responsible for causing HFMD and
herpangina.
In the last few years however, HEV71 has been recognized
as the etiological agent in a number of large outbreaks of
HFMD in the Asia Pacific region during which alarming
numbers of fatalities have occurred. The first of these outbreaks was recognized in 1997 in Sarawak, Malaysia and
was followed by consecutive outbreaks in Taiwan in 1998,
Perth, Western Australia in 1999 and Singapore and
Malaysia in 2000 [5]. The emergence of HFMD as a clinical syndrome which can be associated with severe neurological complications, has emphasized the need to
distinguish HEV71 from other enteroviruses causing
HFMD. Early identification of HEV71-associated HFMD
can provide early warning of potential HEV71 encephalitis outbreaks and assist in directing public health interventions as well as inform clinical decisions.
One solution is to use universal enterovirus primers binding to conserved regions in order to amplify a product
which can be sequenced and thus achieve serotype identification. Many groups have published methods to do this,
using the VP1 gene [6] as well as the VP4 gene [7]. These
methods are applicable to all enteroviruses and require a
sequencing step to obtain the information needed to
determine serotype.
A second approach is to design HEV71 specific primers,
thus allowing a preliminary evaluation of the specimen
based on the presence or absence of a PCR product of the
expected size. Confirmation that the amplified product is
from target HEV71 template can be achieved in a number
of ways, including hybridization with an internal oligonucleotide probe or by DNA sequencing. The first attempt to
use serotype specific primers to identify HEV71 was published by Brown and colleagues in 2000 [8]. These investigators used 2 primer sets, 92S/93A and 159S/162A
which generate a 71 basepair and a 484 basepair product
respectively. These primers were designed to provide rapid
detection of HEV71 positive virus isolates followed by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/4/11

sequencing for genotyping. The primer pair 92S/93A has
limited utility because the amplified product has to be
resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels, but we have used
the 159S/162A pair extensively since 1997 when the
authors generously provided us with the oligonucleotide
sequences prior to publication. During the outbreak of
HFMD with encephalitis in Sarawak in 1997 [9,10], this
primer pair proved extremely useful in assisting outbreak
investigations and informing public health interventions.
However, in the inter epidemic years when CVA16 infections have been more common than HEV71 (Cardosa,
unpublished data), these primers have proven to be occasionally unreliable, and have been found to misprime and
amplify recent Asian CVA16 strains. In this study we
attempt to explain how this mispriming occurs by
sequencing through the primer annealing sites of newly
isolated CVA16 strains. Utilizing this new sequence data,
we also describe the design of an improved set of primers
for the identification of HEV71 isolates as well as for use
with primary specimens.

Methods
Primary specimens from patients
Specimens from patients with a clinical diagnosis of
HFMD, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis were submitted
to our laboratory for routine virus diagnosis through a
public health surveillance programme for HEV71 transmission. Throat, rectal, vesicle and various oral swabs in
virus transport medium, stool and cerebrospinal fluids
(CSF) were received through the Central Medical Laboratory of Kuching Hospital from 1998 through 2003. All
swab specimens were kept frozen at -20°C until tested
and all cerebrospinal fluids were frozen at -80°C until
tested.
Virus strains
All enteroviruses used in this study were isolated from
serum, stool, CSF, throat, rectal, vesicle and other oral
swabs submitted to the laboratory for virological investigation of HFMD, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Enteroviruses were cultivated in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), 293
or A549 cells. Some strains of HEV71 used here were from
a collection used in a previous study [11]. Prototype
human adenoviruses were cultivated in 293 or A549 cells,
and dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses were grown
using the mosquito cell line C6/36. Serotype identification of enteroviruses was performed using molecular
methods as described by Oberste et al. [6] or Ishiko et al.
[7].
Nucleic acid extraction
RNA was extracted from infected tissue culture supernatants using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.,
Cincinnati, OH, USA) and from primary clinical

specimens using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
Extracted RNA was stored at -80°C until use.
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)
First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed in 10 µl reaction volumes containing 100 units of Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MuLV RT)
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in M-MuLV RT reaction
buffer (Promega), 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate
(dNTP) mix (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA), 2 µM of the
antisense primer and 6 µl of extracted RNA. The reaction
was incubated at 42°C for 1 hour followed by 10 minutes
at 70°C and immediately placed on ice.

PCR was done in 20 µl reactions containing 2 µl of cDNA,
2.5 units of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) in PCR Buffer containing
(NH4)2SO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1 µM of each primer and 0.3
mM of dNTP mix. Amplification of parts of the VP1 gene
using primer pairs 159S/162A [8] and 040/011 [6] was
achieved essentially as described by the authors. The complete VP4 gene was amplified as previously described [11].
Amplified products were sequenced in both directions
using the respective PCR sense and antisense primers with
the exception of the VP4 gene where an internal sense
primer, EVP-4 [12] was used instead of the PCR sense
primer. Cycle sequencing was achieved using the Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and reactions were
loaded on the ABI377 automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

gene from these isolates together with consensus VP1
sequence from the different HEV71 genogroups (Brown et
al., 1999; McMinn et al., 2001) and additional VP1
sequences of local CVA16 isolates was prepared. An antisense
primer,
MAS02A
[5'-AGAGGGAG(A/
G)TCTATCTC(C/T)CC-3'], was selected to be used
together with MAS01S for optimal detection of HEV71
without targeting CVA16. The primers amplified a 376
basepair fragment extending from the VP3 into the VP1
gene.
Reaction mixtures for RT-PCR were prepared as described
above. The optimal annealing temperature was determined using the Mastercycler Gradient thermocycler
(Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). For the evaluation
of this primer pair, 2 µl of cDNA from virus isolates or 5
µl of cDNA from primary clinical specimens were subjected to PCR at 94°C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles
of denaturation at 95°C, annealing at 55°C and extension
at 72°C for 30 seconds each. A final extension at 72°C for
5 minutes was performed after the last cycle. Amplified
products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose
gels containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignments of the VP4 and partial VP1 gene sequences
were prepared using the ClustalX program [13]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using PHYLIP, version 3.5
[14]. Dendrograms were constructed with the neighbourjoining method using 1000 pseudoreplicates to generate
bootstrap values. We used the TREEVIEW program [15] to
draw the cladograms.

Results

Serotype identification of human enteroviruses
Human enterovirus serotype identification was achieved
using 2 approaches. In the first instance, the VP4 gene
sequences obtained were compared with prototype
human enterovirus VP4 gene sequences using a phylogenetic analysis [7]. Secondly, the VP1 and VP4 gene
sequences were submitted to a BLAST search in the GenBank sequence database (NCBI, Betheseda, MD, USA).
We have had no discordant results using both methods on
all isolates used in this study.

Misidentification of CVA16 as HEV71
Primer pair 159S/162A occasionally misprimes CVA16
strains and generates amplicons the size expected from
HEV71. An example of this is shown in Figure 1 where it
can be seen that pan enterovirus primers in VP4 amplified
a product in all 12 CVA16 samples and 159S/162A amplified 7 of these. DNA sequencing of the VP4 products confirmed that the samples were CVA16. The PCR products
generated with 159S/162A were also sequenced and
found to be CVA16, thus confirming that the samples
affected did not contain both CVA16 and HEV71.

Design of HEV71 specific primers
Complete genome sequence of HEV71 strains (Accession
numbers: U22521, U22522, AF136379, AF302996,
AF352027, AF176044, AF119795, AF119796) and the
CVA16 prototype strain G-10 (Accession number
U05876) were obtained from GenBank. The VP3 gene
sequences from these strains were aligned and a sense
primer, MAS01S [5'-ATAATAGCA(C/T)T(A/G)GCGGCAGCCCA-3'], selected. A separate alignment of the VP1

In order to understand the reason for this mispriming, we
sequenced 8 local isolates of CVA16 through the primer
binding sites to determine if there had been any mutations that could account for this. Very few sequences of
CVA16 strains have been deposited in GenBank, and the
prototype strain G-10 was used in the design of the original published set of HEV71 specific primers, 159S/162A
[8]. The strains we have isolated since 1998 have not
shown very much change in the primer binding regions,

but a few nucleotide differences may have been critical in
allowing mispriming to occur. Figure 2 shows an alignment of different genogroups of HEV71 and CVA16 prototype G-10 with the consensus sequence of local CVA16
strains in the primer binding regions. All our local CVA16
strains show complete identity with the sense primer 159S
but we infer that this primer was not meant to specifically
bind to HEV71 since even the prototype CVA16 G-10 had
only one nucleotide difference.

groups, CVA16 prototype strain G-10 and the consensus
sequence of recent local CVA16 strains in the regions
selected for the new primers. The sense primer MAS01S
binds to a region in VP3 just upstream of the VP3/VP1
junction. The antisense primer MAS02A binds to a region
in VP1, giving a predicted amplicon size of 376 basepairs.
In the design of these primers we attempted to use representative sequence from all recent HEV71 genogroups
[11,16] as well as earlier strains [17].

However, the antisense primer was meant to be the
HEV71 specific primer of the pair. There were 8 mismatches of the 20-nucleotide primer sequence in the
CVA16 G-10 primer-binding site. Our recent CVA16
strains have 7 mismatches, but a mutation in the third
position from the 3' end generates a four base identity
(boxed in Figure 2) that could allow binding and extension of the primer, thus leading to misidentification of
CVA16.

Evaluation of primers using virus isolates
Primer pair MAS01S/MAS02A was then evaluated using
viruses isolated from specimens collected from patients
with HFMD, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. A total of
218 viruses (204 enteroviruses) were tested. Two individuals performed all the testing and were blinded to the
source and identity of the samples. Table 1 shows that the
improved HEV71 specific primer pair amplified all 39
HEV71 isolates tested and none of the 165 other enteroviruses (38 CVA16, 127 others, representative of human
enterovirus species A, B and C). Specific information
about the isolates used can be found in Additional file 1.
We also tested these primers on cell cultures containing 14
prototype adenoviruses and flaviviruses, and none were
positive. All PCR products generated were sequenced to
confirm HEV71 specificity.

Design of improved HEV71 specific primers
New HEV71 specific primers were designed by comparing
sequences of recent local CVA16 and HEV71 isolates with
other sequence data available in GenBank (Accession
numbers: U22521, AF136379, U22522, AF352027,
U05876). The program Lasergene (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used to align and compare sequences
for determination of potential primer binding regions.

with the potential to bind to HEV71 template leading to extension and amplification.

Evaluation of primers using primary clinical specimens
Aliquots of throat, rectal and vesicle swabs yielding
HEV71 isolates when inoculated into cell culture were
selected to test the utility of the primers in detecting
HEV71-containing primary specimens. Specific information about the primary specimens used in this evaluation
can be found in Additional file 2. Figure 4 shows a representative agarose gel of primary samples tested using
primer set MAS01S/MAS02A. As shown in Table 2, when
we used fresh primary specimens within 2 months of collection, 27 of 28 (96.4%) specimens tested were positive
using MAS01S/MAS02A. However, the sensitivity of the
assay dropped drastically when older stored specimens
were used. Only 30% of specimens between 3 months
and one year old, and 18% of specimens older than 2
years were positive when tested. When testing primary

clinical specimens, it is important to test them as soon as
possible after collection.
Utility of sequence generated from MAS01S/MAS02A
amplicons for HEV71 genogroup determination
We sequenced all amplicons generated using improved
primer pair MAS01S/MAS02A in order to confirm the
identity of the positive signals. Although the primary goal
of this study was to design and test an improved primer set
for rapid detection of HEV71, we also considered whether
the sequenced PCR product would be useful for genogroup determination since the product generated represented approximately 30% of the VP1 gene. The
cladogram shown in Figure 5 was generated from the relevant gene region of representative sequences of all
known HEV71 genogroups [11] using sequence data

also be used as a screening tool to provide rapid genogroup information.
Phylogenetic analysis of CVA16
In this study we sequenced the VP4 gene of all CVA16
strains used in order to make serotype identifications. We
have used representative data to examine the phylogenetic
relationships of these local strains with other recent and
historical strains isolated in Asia (Accession numbers:
E11659, AB053285, AB094771, AB094773, E11657,
AB053287, E11656, AB053286, E11658, AB061505,
AB094784,
AB094776,

AB094779,
AB094783, AJ297109, AB094775, AB094778, U22521,
U05876. Accession numbers for local sequence data:
AY536013 to AY536038). Since sequence data from Western hemisphere strains is scarce in GenBank, we have only
been able to include the prototype CVA16 G-10 and a
strain isolated in the UK (Epsom/15290/99) in the
analysis for comparison. Figure 6 shows that the Asian
strains are clearly distinct from the prototype CVA16 G10, forming a cluster strongly supported by a bootstrap

value of 94.6. The CVA16 G10 strain has a 78 to 82%
nucleic acid identity to the Asian strains but the UK strain
Epsom/15290/99 is more closely related to the Asian
strains isolated since the 1990s. The Asian strains tend to
be closely related to each other. A likely exception is a
cluster of Japanese strains isolated between 18 and 25
years ago. A cluster of modern Asian strains isolated in
1990, 1991, 1998 and 2000 appears to be closely related
to these viruses, the segregation of both these clusters
being supported by a bootstrap value of 87.7. A second
group of strains isolated from 1995 to 2003 appear to
form a different cluster, but more data is still needed
before any conclusions are made about the strength of this
association since the bootstrap values here are rather
weak. Thus it would appear from our analysis at this stage
that the Asian strains all fall into a single genogroup distinct from the prototype G10 strain isolated in 1951.

Discussion
The emergence of HEV71 as an important pathogen in the
Asia Pacific region since 1997 [5] has emphasized the
need to be able to rapidly identify and provide early warning of HEV71 transmission in a community. This is best

done by surveillance of HFMD, a disease also caused by
the more innocuous CVA16 and other species A human
enteroviruses. The first pairs of primers for this purpose
were described by Brown and colleagues [8] and one of
these pairs (159S/162A) has been extensively used to
investigate recent HEV71 outbreaks. The heightened
awareness of the importance of HFMD surveillance has
also led to an increased isolation and study of CVA16
strains and the realisation that these important primers
can occasionally misidentify CVA16 as HEV71 due to a
single nucleotide change that has unfortunately arisen in
recent Asian CVA16 strains. We have used new data to
design an improved primer set that is highly specific for
HEV71. The new primers MAS01S/MAS02A are useful in
identifying HEV71 isolates and in providing preliminary
genogroup information when employed together with
DNA sequencing of the PCR products. These primers may
also be useful in the rapid indication of the presence of
HEV71 genome in throat, rectal and vesicle swabs. If specimens are tested as soon as possible after collection, the
new primers can reliably provide screening information
about HEV71. This would be especially important in surveillance programmes since a rapid public health
response depends on rapid identification of a threat.

Conclusion

Following the publication of the 159S/162A primers by
Brown et al. [8], other groups have also published methods for the specific identification of HEV71 by RT PCR
[18,19]. However, the primers described by Brown et al.
[8] remain the most widely used VP1 based primers for
HEV71 detection [9,20-24] and it is for this reason that we
have documented the problem arising from mispriming
recent local Asian strains of CVA16 using these primers.
To our knowledge, VP1 based primers described by other
groups have not been generally used, and we have not
attempted to make a direct comparison of our primer set
with these.

Additional material

Our primers are degenerate in only 2 positions in each
primer, and are therefore robust and likely to generate
amplicons in specimens with low numbers of templates
such as might be the case with primary clinical samples. It
would be a tremendous advantage if we could directly
identify HEV71 in CSF without having to wait for virus
isolation. We have retrospectively attempted this on a limited number of CSF collected during the last HEV71 transmission season (2003) but have been unable to
demonstrate the presence of enterovirus template using
pan enterovirus primers or MAS01S/MAS02A, although
we have been able to successfully identify HEV71 containing primary specimens from throat and rectal swabs. We
intend to test the utility of these primers on CSF samples
prospectively during our next HEV71 transmission
season.

We have used new sequence information to explain why
important HEV71 specific primers designed in the last
decade have begun to misidentify recent Asian strains of
CVA16. The new data have been used to design improved
HEV71 specific primers able to correctly identify HEV71
isolates without mispriming CVA16 templates. This new
primer set is also able to identify HEV71 containing primary specimens with a high degree of sensitivity only
when fresh specimens are used, and can therefore be
employed as a screening tool for surveillance of HEV71
and in outbreak situations.
