Molecular phylogeny of pearl oysters and their
relatives (Mollusca, Bivalvia, Pterioidea)
Ilya Tëmkin

Abstract
Background: The superfamily Pterioidea is a morphologically and ecologically diverse lineage of epifaunal marine
bivalves distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical continental shelf regions. This group includes
commercially important pearl culture species and model organisms used for medical studies of biomineralization.
Recent morphological treatment of selected pterioideans and molecular phylogenetic analyses of higher-level
relationships in Bivalvia have challenged the traditional view that pterioidean families are monophyletic. This issue
is examined here in light of molecular data sets composed of DNA sequences for nuclear and mitochondrial loci,
and a published character data set of anatomical and shell morphological characters.
Results: The present study is the first comprehensive species-level analysis of the Pterioidea to produce a wellresolved, robust phylogenetic hypothesis for nearly all extant taxa. The data were analyzed for potential biases due
to taxon and character sampling, and idiosyncracies of different molecular evolutionary processes. The congruence
and contribution of different partitions were quantified, and the sensitivity of clade stability to alignment
parameters was explored.
Conclusions: Four primary conclusions were reached: (1) the results strongly supported the monophyly of the
Pterioidea; (2) none of the previously defined families (except for the monotypic Pulvinitidae) were monophyletic;
(3) the arrangement of the genera was novel and unanticipated, however strongly supported and robust to
changes in alignment parameters; and (4) optimizing key morphological characters onto topologies derived from
the analysis of molecular data revealed many instances of homoplasy and uncovered synapomorphies for major
nodes. Additionally, a complete species-level sampling of the genus Pinctada provided further insights into the
on-going controversy regarding the taxonomic identity of major pearl culture species.

Background
Since the lower Middle Ordovician some 470 million
years ago, pterioidean bivalves have inhabited a remarkable diversity of marine epifaunal and semi-infaunal
environments around the globe, typically confined to
cryptic habitats and forming byssal attachments to various substrata. For a much shorter part of their historyfrom the dawn of human culture-they have become the
primary source of pearls and nacre [1-3]. Pearl fishing
based on natural populations of pterioidean bivalves had
expanded into a growing global industry with a current
value of approximately half a billion US dollars per
annum [4]. In pursuit of pearls, commercial introductions and accidental transport of pterioideans beyond

their native distribution ranges have greatly affected
population dynamics of some species endangering local
indigenous biotas (e.g., [5-8]). A recent interest in physical properties of mother-of-pearl made pterioidean
bivalves a model system for elucidating molecular
mechanisms of biomineralization with medical applications for bone regeneration (e.g., [9,10]). Given the long
and many-sided history of pterioideans and humans,
and the current economic and ecological significance of
these bivalves, surprisingly little is known about the
standing alpha-diversity, distribution, and evolutionary
history of the group.
The present-day diversity of the superfamily Pterioidea
Gray, 1847 [11] encompasses four families traditionally
defined by shell shape and ligament structure: Pteriidae,
Isognomonidae, Malleidae, and Pulvinitidae [12-15].
Pteriids are distinguished by an obliquely ovate shell

shape, an enlarged posteriorly projecting auricle, and a
deep byssal notch. Many pteriid species, particularly of
genera Pteria and Electroma, evolved specialized associations with hydroid, scleractinian, and alcyonarian substrata. Most species of Pinctada (pearl oysters) inhabit
sandy and hard bottoms, some living in association with
commensal fishes and crustaceans. Several species of
Pteria and Pinctada are cultured for commercial pearl
production. Most species of a malleid genus Malleus are
irregularly shaped to conform to narrow crevices in
hard coral and rocky substrata, and develop elongated
extensions of the hinge for stabilization in soft sediment.
Species of the second malleid genus, Vulsella, are
adapted for living within sponges. Isognomonids are
characterized by the distinct morphology of the ligament
that contains multiple grooves (resilifers) for ligamental
attachments arranged sequentially along the hinge line
(multivincular ligament). Species of the genus Isognomon
often co-occur with species of Malleus in crevices and
on soft muddy bottoms, but also are gregarious on mangrove roots, whereas species of Crenatula, the second
isognomonid genus, live inside sponges (as the malleid
Vulsella). Similarly to isognomonids, pulvinitids possess
multivincular ligament, but are distinguished from isognomonids by the presence of the foramen, an opening
in the right valve through which the byssus is protruded.
Living pulvinitids are represented by the genus Pulvinites, the sole extant species of which, Pulvinites exempla, lives byssally attached to vertical hard substrata at
200-400 m depths.
Previous studies aimed at resolving higher-level phylogeny within Bivalvia agreed on the monophyly of the
Pterioidea and its placement within the subclass Autolamellibranchiata. However, most aspects of relationships
within the superfamily and the identity of its immediate
sister group remain uncertain. In a pioneering study on
the evolution and ontogeny of the bivalve shell, Jackson
(1890) proposed the derivation of major pterioidean
groups from a Pteria¬-like Paleozoic ancestor [16]. In
his scheme, several autolamellibranchiate lineages,
including common oysters of the family Ostreidae and
several extinct families, evolved from Isognomon, the latter ultimately arising from the Pteria stem lineage.
Jackson also provisionally recognized close relatedness
of Malleus and Vulsella.
Despite the implication of Jackson’s work for pterioidean systematics, the notion of the monophyly and
taxonomic composition of pterioidean families persisted
for over a century. Molecular studies aimed at establishing relationships within the subclass Autolamellibranchiata or the entire Bivalvia suggested that several
widely accepted pterioidean taxa possibly did not constitute natural groups. The minimum evolution tree based
on the analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome

oxydase I (COI) sequences did not resolve the relationships among Pteria, Pinctada, and Isognomon (Figure
1a) [17]. Thus, this analysis failed to provide support for
the monophyly of Pteriidae but supported the monophyly of Pinctada and Isognomon. A study with more
extensive sampling and based on parsimony analysis of
sequence data for the nuclear small ribosomal subunit
(18S rDNA) likewise failed to recover the monophyly of
Pteriidae, but also that of Malleidae (Figure 1b) [18]. In
that study, Isognomon was monophyletic, Pteria was
paraphyletic, and Pinctada was polyphyletic. The pteriid
Electroma was a sister taxon to the malleid Vulsella.
The maximum likelihood analysis of the same data produced a similar, but more resolved, topology recovering
monophyletic Pinctada (Figure 1c) [18]. In a more
extensive in character-but not taxonomic-sampling analysis of combined 18S and the large ribosomal subunit
sequence (28S rDNA) data, the families Pteriidae and
Malleidae, and the genus Pteria were non-monophyletic
(Figure 1d) [19]. When these data were combined with
the nuclear histone H3 gene and the mitochondrial COI
gene sequences, the analysis produced a polytomy for all
representatives of the Pterioidea except for the Isognomon and Electroma/Vulsella clades (Figure 1e) [19].
In summary, molecular studies, varying greatly in
sampling and analytical techniques, produced inconsistent hypotheses of pterioidean relationships with low
resolution and support. These findings, however,
agreed on the monophyly of the superfamily and suggested that the families Pteriidae and Malleidae were
not monophyletic. The results were conflicting with
regard to the monophyly of the genera Pteria and
Pinctada, whereas Isognomon was invariably monophyletic. The monophyly of the family Isognomonidae and
the genera Electroma and Malleus were not tested, and
representatives of the family Pulvinitidae and the
genus Crenatula were not included in the analyses.
The only study that focused exclusively on the Pterioidea was based on morphological characters and
included representatives of all four families and nine
genera (Figure 1f) [15]. It supported the monophyly of
the Pterioidea and non-monophyly of three families
(Pulvinitidae remains untested being represented by a
single extant species). All the genera that were represented by multiple species (Pteria, Pinctada, Isognomon, and Malleus) were recovered monophyletic.
Species-level sampling in that study was insufficient to
test the assumption of monophyly of the remaining
genera and did not include type species for most nominal supraspecific taxa. Despite these recent challenges
on both molecular and morphological grounds, no
consensus on pterioidean relationships was reached
and no revision of the existing classification was
proposed.

The identity of the pterioidean sister group remains
uncertain, favoring the oysters (Ostreoidea), pen shells
(Pinnoidea), or a clade composed of these two groups,
currently classified together with the Pterioidea in the
order Pterioida. Most analyses based on morphological
data for extinct, extant, or both kinds of taxa, have suggested a sister relationship of the Pterioidea and Pinnoidea [20-24], except for one, which instead suggested a
closer relationship of the Pterioidea and Ostreoidea [15].
Likewise, molecular analyses were divided in favoring
either Pinnoidea [25] or Ostreoidea [18,19,26] as a sister
group of the Pterioidea. In other studies, either Pinnoidea and Ostreoidea formed a clade sister to the Pterioidea [17,19], or the relationships among the three
superfamilies were unresolved [25,27]. The only explicitly combined analysis of morphological and molecular
data resolved the Pinnoidea basal to the Pterioidea/
Ostreoidea clade [24]. The unsettled question of the
pterioidean sister group is pertinent to the recent
debates on the origin of oysters in paleontological literature [28-30].
The present analysis is the first study to produce a
nearly comprehensive species-level phylogeny for the
Pterioidea based on DNA sequence data. The principal
specific goals of this study include (1) testing the monophyly of the Pterioidea, and all its families and genera;
(2) reviewing the consequences of these results for the
homology of important morphological characters; and

(3) resolving species-level phylogenetic relationships
within the commercially important pearl oyster genus
Pinctada.

Methods
Taxonomic Sampling
Sources of specimens

Most specimens were obtained from museum collections worldwide, with additional material gathered during fieldwork in the western Atlantic (Florida Keys, U.S.
A., June 2003), the eastern Pacific (Golfo de California,
Mexico, August 2003), the Mediterranean (Tyrrhenian
Sea, Italy, May 2005), and the Indo-Pacific (Gulf of
Thailand, Thailand, August-September 2005) regions.
Living animals were collected in mangroves and shallow
intertidal waters, fixed in 85-95% ethanol, and subsequently transferred to 75-95% ethanol. Collected specimens were deposited at the American Museum of
Natural History (New York, U.S.A.) and the Field
Museum of Natural History (Chicago, U.S.A.). DNA
sequence data were obtained for 77 of the 100 terminal
taxa. The remaining sequences were acquired from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html.
Collection localities and museum catalog numbers for
the specimens used in this study are listed in Table 1.

as the taxa most closely related to the Pterioidea on morphological and molecular grounds, representatives of these
superfamilies were chosen for the outgroup. To ensure
maximum diversity of the ostreoidean taxa, the selection
of the gryphaeid Hyotissa, and the ostreid Ostrea and
Crassostrea exemplars were guided by their placement in
a recently proposed phylogenetic hypothesis [31]. To
polarize the immediate outgroups, representatives of two
other autolamellibranchiate orders, Mytiloida and Pectinoida were selected based upon the availability of
sequence data. Mytilioda, represented by the well-known
common mussel species, Mytilus edulis, had been resolved
as the most basal order of the subclass in comprehensive
studies based on morphological [22], molecular [18,24],
and combined [24] data and, accordingly, was designated
for cladogram rooting.
Ingroup taxa

Inasmuch as the Pterioidea is the primary focus of this
study, the taxonomic sampling of this taxon was the most
dense. All nominal families and genera of the Pterioidea
were included in the analyses. The sample contained
representatives of type species of all pterioidean genera
except for Pulvinites, which was described based on an
extinct species, P. adansonii, from the Late Cretaceous.
Success in securing multiple representatives for each genus
varied because the material could not be obtained for few
taxa characterized by cryptic life habit and presumed low
species diversity. Initially, specimens were sorted to morphospecies using anatomical and shell morhological features. Species-level identifications were verified with
reference to the extant type material and assigned to most
specimens. Where possible, to avoid assumptions of the
extent of intraspecific phenotypic variation, multiple
potentially conspecific individuals were included in the
analysis. Given the lack of recent systematic revisions for
the majority of pterioidean taxa, species-level identifications were tentatively chosen with correspondence to their
prevailing use in current literature.
The sample of the genus Pinctada was complete, with
32 exemplars representing 10 nominal species, including
the type species Pinctada margaritifera. The overrepresentation of Pinctada species was necessitated by an enduring

controversy regarding the taxonomic status of the Pinctada imbricata/fucata/radiata species complex [32] that
includes important perliculture species. Sampling of Pteria
was nearly comprehensive; it included 18 exemplars of 10
nominal species (including the type species Pteria hirundo) of estimated total of 12 species. The genus Isognomon was represented by 18 exemplars corresponding to
potentially 10 of approximately 13 species total, and
includes the type species, I. isognomum. The genus Malleus was represented by 9 exemplars, corresponding to 5
(of total approximately 8) species, including Malleus malleus, the type species of the genus, and Malleus regula, a
type species of the subgenus Malvufundus. It must be
pointed out that the true global species diversity of Isognomon and Malleus is not known due to potential high
endemism and cryptic diversity associated with adaptations to hidden habitats, such as interstitial crevices and
submarine caves. The extent of species coverage for the
relatively rare and inadequately studied genera Vulsella,
Crenatula, and Electroma is uncertain due to cryptic lifestyle in coral crevices and inside sponges. A broad survey
based on dry shells from over twenty major museum collections worldwide suggested that these genera contain
very few species and that Crenatula is likely to be monotypic. The latter was represented in the analysis by a single
specimen corresponding to the type species, C. avicularis
(previously used in the morphology-only phylogenetic analysis under the synonym C. modiolaris [15]). The genus
Electroma was represented by seven exemplars corresponding to potentially four species, including E. alacorvi
and Electroma (Pterelectroma) physoides [commonly
referred to by its junior synonym, E. (P.) zebra], the sole
living member of the subgenus. Two exemplars of Vulsella, corresponding to the type species V. vulsella, one of
possibly only two living species, were included in the analysis. The genus Pulvinites was represented by one exemplar of the only extant pulvinitid species, P. exempla.
Molecular Data
Locus selection

Genome-wide sampling of multiple independently evolving genes is instrumental in overcoming the

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

incongruence among trees derived from individual gene
analyses, and producing a resolved and strongly supported
phylogeny. Because this study involves the analysis of taxa
of disparate levels of divergence, a data set was assembled
that consisted of nuclear loci (two ribosomal RNA genes
and the histone H3) and a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA
locus, that in combination span a broad spectrum of variation. The ribosomal DNA sequences display a substantial
difference in evolutionary rates among and within the
genes (from fast-evolving mitochondrial to the much
more conserved nuclear rDNA), and are easily amplifiable
due to the presence of multiple copies per genome and
the pattern of concerted evolution [33]. The following
DNA regions were used: (1) the complete sequence of the
small nuclear ribosomal subunit (SSU or 18S rDNA; range
1237-1778 bp; total aligned length 1882 bp); (2) the D1D3 fragments of the large nuclear ribosomal subunit (LSU
or 28S rDNA; range 308-1131 bp; total aligned length
1308 bp); (3) a fragment of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (mtLSU or 16S rDNA; range 466-580 bp;
total aligned length 934 bp), and (4) the single-copy
nuclear histone gene H3 (the total length 310 bp), which
is intron-free and highly conserved at the level of amino
acids. The total length of the alignment of the complete
data set was 4434 bp.
DNA isolation and amplification

Original DNA sequence data have been obtained for
most sampled terminals; remaining sequences were
obtained from the GenBank database (Table 1). DNA
was extracted from fresh, frozen, dried, ethanol- (70100%) or RNAlater®(Qiagen)-preserved tissues. Total
genomic DNA was isolated from adductor muscle, foot,
or the entire body using DNeasy® Tissue Kit (Qiagen).
DNA amplifications were carried out using GeneAmp®
PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using standard
procedures. The PCR primers are listed in Table 2.
Amplifications were carried out in 35-40 cycles using
the following general temperature profile: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, denaturation for 30-45 s at
94°C, annealing for 15-60 s at 40-65°C, and extension
for 30-120 s at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 5
min. Specific conditions varied across loci and taxa. The
PCR products were subsequently desalted and concentrated using an ArrayIt® PCR Product Purification Kit
(TeleChem International) on a Biomek® 2000 Laboratory
Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter), and
sequenced in both directions using the ABI Prism® BigDye ™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems) on ABI Prism® 3700/3730xl DNA
Analyzers (Applied Biosystems) at AMNH.
Sequence fragments were assembled into contigs, and
checked for errors and ambiguities against chromatograms using Sequencher™ 4.6 (Gene Codes). The
sequence coverage varied from 2× to 6× depending on

Page 7 of 28

the quality of the material. The resultant sequences
were checked for potential contamination by BLAST
searches [34,35] as implemented by the NCBI website
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The new sequences have
been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
HQ329247-HQ329509 (Table 1).
DNA sequence homology

The ribosomal DNA sequences, the principal source of
character data in the present study, vary considerably in
length, creating uncertainty in the inference of nucleotide-level homology. To circumvent alignment ambiguity, all potential nucleotide homologies were evaluated
in the framework of dynamic homology [36,37], as
implemented in POY 4.1 [38]. In this approach nucleotide correspondences (putative positional homologies)
and their transformations (substitutions and insertiondeletion events) are simultaneously optimized for each
tree topology provided an optimality criterion and a cost
function (transformation step matrix). The integration of
alignment and tree searching into a single procedure to
produce globally optimal trees allows for evaluating
multiple unique homology schemes on a consistent theoretical basis, as both are evaluated using the same criteria [39,40]. In simultaneous analysis using direct
optimization, morphological and molecular characters
are co-optimized at the level of sequence alignment in
search of a globally optimal solution. The homology
scheme corresponding to the topology of the optimal
cladogram was used to produce an implied alignment
[41,42]. The implied alignment was used for statistical
tests of sequence variation and other analyses requiring
fixed character matrices with equal length character
strings (i.e. multiple alignments).
DNA sequences were partitioned into fragments to
reduce computation time and to constrain the assignment of insertions and deletions (indels) to unambiguously homologous regions. None of the regions were
excluded from the analyses except for the flanking primer sequences. Initially, multiple alignments were constructed using ClustalX 2.0.5 [43] under default
parameter settings. For rDNA sequences, the alignments
were subsequently partitioned into fragments flanked by
highly conservative (lacking indels) regions corresponding to elements of secondary structure. The secondary
structure features were identified with reference to those
inferred for molluscan [44,45] and other metazoan (e.g.,
[46-50]) taxa. Lastly, the gaps were removed resulting in
a total of 26 matrices of unaligned fragments. All histone H3 sequences had the same length. A comparison
of the translated H3 open reading frame with the published database of histone sequences [51] confirmed
high conservation at the level of amino acids. In this
case, the nucleotide homology was unambiguous and
the H3 data set was treated as a single aligned fragment.

Patterns of nucleotide substitutions

Morphological Data

Individual data partitions were tested for substitution
saturation using a non-parametric statistical test based
on an information entropy index [52] implemented in
DAMBE 5.0.23 [53]. The actual number of transitions
and transversions, and their ratio were obtained by optimizing substitutions on the optimal topology using
MacClade 4.07 [54]. Departure from homogeneity of
base composition across all taxa was assessed using the
c 2 test as implemented in PAUP* 4.0d105 [55]. The
extent of rate variation across sites for individual data
partitions and for the entire data set was estimated by
the shape parameter a of the gamma distribution. The
values of a were estimated by the maximum likelihood
method assuming the discrete gamma model [56,57]
with four rate categories as implemented in PAUP*
4.0d105 [55].
For close inspection of species-level divergence of the
problematic Pinctada imbricata/fucata/radiata species
complex, the genetic distances were obtained for within
and among presumed species, and then compared to the
inter- and intraspecific levels of sequence divergence
inferred for their congeners. In this analysis, the distance
matrices for rDNA data sets were generated using the
minimum evolution objective function (ME; [58,59])
under the general time-reversible model of nucleotide
substitution (GTR; [60-62]) using PAUP* 4.0d105 [55].
The choice of the substitution model was guided by the
best-fit model preferred by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; [63]) for the combined molecular data set
under maximum likelihood (ML) optimality criterion
(see below). The H3 data set was not used in this analysis due to missing data for several critical taxa in
question.

A previously published data set based on morphological
data [15] was used for simultaneous analysis of morphological and molecular data. The morphological characters and methods have been described and illustrated in
detail in [15]. The data set included 134 morphological
characters scored for 19 exemplar species, representing
all valid pterioidean genera. As in the original study, all
characters were unweighted and one multistate character (the differentiation of gill filaments) was treated as
additive based on unequivocal ontogenetic evidence.
Molecular data were available for all the taxa for which
morphological characters were sampled with the exception of Malleus anatinus. Therefore, for the simultaneous analysis of morphological and molecular data
sets, the sequences of a closely related species, M. albus,
were used as a surrogate for the missing molecular data
for M. anatinus. Given the small number of taxa for
which morphological data was available, the benefits of
minimizing the amount of missing data at the expense
of using a composite taxon was justified in the context
of the present analysis aimed primarily at resolving
supraspecific relationships. For the morphological character matrix, see [15].

Character Matrices and Incongruence-Length
Difference Tests

Several different molecular data sets varying in taxon
and character sampling were examined in the present
study. The most comprehensive character matrix (hereafter referred to as the “complete data set”) included
sequences for four loci scored for 100 exemplars (12
outgroup and 88 ingroup terminal taxa). The complete
data set contained representatives of all supraspecific
taxa and approximately 92% of all extant species of the
Pterioidea. In this data set 43% terminals were represented by sequences for all four loci, 54%-by three loci,
2%-by two loci, and only 1%-by a short fragment of a
single locus. Thus, character sampling was not satisfactory for 3% of terminal taxa (the ingroup taxa Pulvinites
exempla and Vulsella vulsella, and the outgroup taxon
Pinna muricata), and their placement must therefore be
treated with caution. The second character matrix (hereafter referred to as the “reduced data set”) was restricted
to the subset of those taxa for which morphological data
was available. The reduced data set was tailored for a
combined analysis to have a maximum taxonomic overlap of morphological and molecular character matrices
with minimum missing data. This data set contained 19
exemplars (3 outgroup and 16 ingroup terminal taxa),
representing all pterioidean genera and families. Morphological data was scored for all 19 terminals; 14 of
these terminals had a complete complement of molecular data (4 loci), 4 terminals had sequence data for three

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

loci, and one terminal (Pulvinites exempla) was represented by a single fragment of the 18S locus. The simultaneous analyses of molecular and morphological data
were performed under maximum parsimony optimality
criterion with the same cost for transformations of morphological characters as for nucleotide substitutions. In
addition to the complete and reduced matrices of combined molecular data, five data sets corresponding to
the combined nuclear data (18S, 28S, and H3) and the
four individual loci (18S, 28S, 16S rDNA, and histone
H3) were analyzed in the parsimony framework to
explore topological differences, and the extent of resolution and support among the partitions.
To evaluate the degree of incongruence between the
data sets quantitatively, the incongruence-length difference tests (ILD; [64-66]) were performed in PAUP*
4.0d105 [55] [but see, e.g., [67,68] for criticisms of the
ILD test]. The ILD tests were done simultaneously on
the four individual locus matrices as well as pairwise on
the complete data set. The tests were performed under
parsimony using 100 replicates, where each replicate
consisted of 10 random-addition sequences (RAS), with
one tree retained per iteration, followed by tree bisection and reconnection (TBR; [69]) branch swapping to
completion.
Phylogenetic Analyses
Tree searching and optimization

Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data were performed using direct optimization [70], a heuristic
approximation to the optimal tree alignment method
[71-75], under parsimony optimality criterion. A heuristic extension of generalized optimization [76,77], direct
optimization includes insertion and deletion events in
addition to substitutions as character transformations,
allowing for the analysis of sequences of different
lengths. Additional analyses based on a static alignment
and ML optimality criterion were performed to characterize the patterns of nucleotide substitutions and to
explore potential sources of systematic error for inferences based on the assumptions of parsimony. These
analyses were based on the implied alignment corresponding to the single optimal cladogram obtained from
the parsimony analysis of the combined data performed
by direct optimization under the equal-cost regime for
the combined molecular character data set.
Parsimony analyses under direct optimization, as
implemented in POY 4.1 [38], were carried out in parallel on the American Museum of Natural History Parallel
Computing Cluster and a dual-processor personal computer. A stepwise tree searching strategy that combines
independent multiple starting points and efficient algorithms designed for escaping local optima was used to
insure sufficient sampling of tree space. Initially, 250-

Page 9 of 28

300 Wagner trees [78,79] were generated by RAS and
submitted to branch swapping to completion by alternating rounds of subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR;
[69]) and TBR. The resultant optimal cladograms were
subjected to 50 iterations of TBR parsimony ratchet
[80], upweighting 20% of nucleotide characters by a factor of 5 and retaining one optimal cladogram per iteration. In the next step, the optimal cladograms were
submitted to tree fusing [81], allowing for up to 200
pairwise clade exchanges, which was followed by
another round of TBR. Finally, the resultant optimal cladograms were submitted to a final round of TBR under
exact three-dimensional direct optimization (iterative
pass optimization; [82]), a more efficient, but substantially more computationally intensive method. The final
equally most-parsimonious trees (MPTs) were rediagnosed to ensure the correctness of tree length calculation and were used to infer implied alignment. All tree
searches were performed with unconstrained ingroup
and outgroup designation [83].
The ML analyses were performed using RAxML 7.0.4
[84] for 250 independent replicates. The results were
evaluated for topological congruence and convergence
on the optimal likelihood value to ensure that the heuristic searches of tree space were sufficiently thorough.
There appears to be no starting-point dependence to
successive approximation that could potentially compromise the accuracy of approximation compared to fulloptimization of ML searches [85]. The best-fit model of
substitution, given the optimal cladogram and the corresponding implied alignment, was selected by Modeltest
3.7 [86] for the combined molecular data set using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; [63,87]). The model
favored by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC =
60431.5938) corresponded to the general time-reversible
model that included estimation of the proportion of
invariant sites (P-Invar) and assumed a gamma distributed rate variation among sites (GTR + I + Γ). However,
due to non-independence of P-Invar and the shape
parameter a of the gamma distribution [88,89], the ML
analyses were performed under the GTR + Γ model.
Topological differences between the trees based on the
partitioned and combined data do not present a problem for choosing among alternative models of
sequence evolution, because tree topology does not
strongly affect model estimation unless long internal
branches are involved [90].
The ensemble consistency index (CI; [91]) and the
ensemble retention index (RI; [78,91]) for the optimal
tree(s) were calculated in POY 4.1 [38] with the
dynamic-homology characters transformed into static
nucleotide-level characters by static approximation [41].
The robustness of phylogenetic relationships was evaluated using the Bremer (BrS; [92]) and jackknife (JK;

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

[93]) support methods at nucleotide level. Relative contribution of individual genes was assessed by partitioned
Bremer support (PBrS; [94]). The batch files for constrained searches were generated by TreeRot 3 [95]. The
constrained searches (100 replicates per search) were
performed by PAUP* 4.0d105 [55]. For calculating jackknife support values, 2000 resampling iterations with
36% of sites removed during each pseudoreplicate were
performed using POY 4.1 [38]. For the partitioned analyses, only jackknife support values were estimated.
The resulting trees were visualized using POY 4.1 [38]
and FigTree 1.2.2 [96]. The optimization and ancestral
state reconstruction of morphological characters were
evaluated using MacClade 4.07 [54].
The significance of the length difference between
alternative topologies was tested by the Kishino-Hasegawa test using resampling of estimated log-likelihoods
(RELL) bootstrap (the KH test; [97,98]) with 1000 replicates under ML criterion, and the Wilcoxon signedranks test (the Templeton test; [99,100]) and the KH
test under parsimony criterion as implemented in
PAUP* 4.0d105 [55]. The tests conducted under ML
were performed using the GTR + Γ, the same model
used for the ML tree searches. The likelihood-based
tests are generally considered inapplicable for post-hoc
tests of the optimal versus an alternative topology
[101,102]. In the present study, these paired-sites tests
were used to assess the significance of alternative outgroup taxon configurations using constrained topologies
defined a priori (none of which corresponding to the
actual optimal tree) for the reduced molecular data set.
Indel treatment and sensitivity analysis

Because direct optimization integrates the implied alignment and the explicit topology, the choice of analytical
parameters (character state transformation weights, or
costs, for nucleotide substitutions and indels) is critical
for phylogenetic inference, as analyses performed under
alternative cost matrices can produce widely different
hypotheses of relationships. To evaluate the effect of
varying alignment parameter values on cladogram topology, independent analyses of the complete data set were
performed for a range of parameter combinations (sensitivity analysis sensu [103]) under parsimony. Sensitivity
analysis allows discerning between stable relationships
(those that are recovered under all or most parameter
combinations) and unstable relationships (those that
appear only under specific parameter combinations).
Twelve parameter combinations (metric transformation
step-matrices) were used in the analysis: indel/substitution ratios of 1, 2, and 4; and Tv/Ts ratios of 1, 2, 4,
and ∞. When the Tv/Ts cost ratio was other than one,
the insertion-deletion cost was set relative to the cost of
transversions. Transversions were never given a higher
cost than indels. To account for a likely possibility that

Page 10 of 28

insertions and deletions spanning multiple contiguous
nucleotide positions could have been accommodated by
single events, additional sets of parameters taking into
account affine indel (gap extension) costs [104] were
carried out. These analyses explored the indel-substitution ratios of 1, 2, and 4, and Tv/Ts ratios of 1, 2, 4,
where the extension gap cost was set at a constant minimum (half the cost for transitions). This corresponded
to five ratios of gap opening/gap extension costs: 2, 4, 8,
16, and 32. In addition, a cost regime that maximizes
homology of both sequence fragments and individual
nucleotide positions in the analysis of sequences of variable length [105] was also examined. This weighting
scheme, based on the view of parsimony as a two-taxon
analysis [106], corresponds to the following combination
of costs: 2 for substitutions, 3 for gap opening, and 1 for
gap extension [105]. In total, 22 parameter combinations
were analyzed. The results of the sensitivity analysis are
shown as binary plots (Tv/Ts ratio on horizontal and
indel/substitution ratio on vertical axes) to designate
presence or absence of every clade recovered in the analysis of the complete data set under equal-costs regime.
In addition, these results are summarized as a stability
tree-a consensus (strict and majority-rule) of clades
recovered under the entire parameter space explored.
Despite the fact that character and topological congruence, as measured by the ILD [64] and the topological
ILD (TILD; [107]) respectively, has been proposed as a
criterion for choosing among alternative weighting
schemes, these measures are partition-dependent and
their values are not comparable across different data
matrices [108]. Because of the lack of such an objective
criterion to decide among alternative weighting schemes,
results from equal costs were preferred. Results under
additional parameter value combinations were used to
assess clade stability.

Results
DNA sequence divergence

A detailed description of DNA sequence divergence patterns is provided in additional file 1: DNA sequence
divergence. As expected, the average levels and the
range of divergence, based on the estimates of p distance (uncorrected for multiple hits), increased with
relative taxonomic rank and, when compared across
loci, were the smallest for the 18S and largest for the
16S sequences. With regard to the taxonomically problematic Pinctada imbricata/fucata/radiata species
complex, even though none of the markers could provide unambiguous cut-off levels for intra- vs. interspecific sequence divergence, in all cases the levels of
divergence in pairwise comparisons between P. imbricata, fucata, and radiata exemplars were invariably
lower compared to other interspecific comparisons, and

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

were the same or marginally exceeding the limits of the
intraspecific sequence divergence range inferred for
other species within Pinctada.
Nucleotide base composition

Overall base composition was homogeneous across all
taxa: a c2 test rejected the null hypothesis of base-composition stationarity neither for any individual locus, nor
for the complete data set (Table 3). The 16S sequences
had a low (although statistically insignificant) proportion
of cytosine and the prevalence of A + T (55.47%), that
has been previously reported for other molluscan taxa
[45]. Across all loci, the sequences were to some extent
GC-rich (A + T = 47.61%, C + G = 52.41%).
Patterns of nucleotide substitution

The entropy-based statistical test [52] of the combined
molecular data set showed no significant net effect of
saturation (Iss < Iss.c; p < 0.05). It revealed that the 18S
and H3 sequences were unaffected by multiple hits (Iss
< Iss.c; p < 0.05), but suggested the presence of substantial substitution saturation in the 16S sequence (Iss >
Iss.c; p < 0.05). Saturation of the 28S sequences can
potentially become problematic when extremely asymmetrical topologies are considered (Iss > Iss.cAsym; p <
0.05), which are probably unrealistic given the results of
the phylogenetic analysis (see below).
The overall value of the shape parameter a of the
gamma distribution was 0.51, suggesting extensive heterogeneity in substitution rates across sites. There was a
considerable disparity in the levels of a across loci: the
highest level of across-site variation was found in 18S (a
= 0.37), followed by H3 (a = 0.58), 28S (a = 0.86), and
16S (a = 1.66). It is noteworthy, that all the nuclear loci
displayed substantial (L-shaped distributed) variation,
whereas the mitochondrial locus showed relatively moderate (bell-shaped distributed) variation in substitution
rates among sites. The estimates of a appear to be accurate for such range of a (the standard error is less than
10% of the a value) [109]. In H3 sequences it was likely
due to codon bias: virtually no substitutions were
inferred for the second position, less than 2% of sites
(1.94% Ts and 1.66% Tv) experienced substitutions in
the first position, whereas up to roughly 20% (18.33% Ts
and 11.95% Tv) of sites in the third position underwent
substitution.
Incongruence-Length Difference Tests

The ILD tests performed simultaneously on all four
molecular data partitions showed that the complete data
set was homogeneous (P = 0.15), suggesting that combining molecular partitions in a phylogenetic analysis
was not likely to reduce phylogenetic accuracy. The
pairwise ILD tests, revealed, however, that only the

Page 11 of 28

rDNA partitions were entirely congruent (18S:28S, P =
0.35; 18S:16S, P = 0.71; 28S:16S, P = 0.99), whereas the
H3 data set was congruent with 16S (P = 0.15), but not
with the nuclear rDNA loci (18S:H3, P = 0.01; 28S:H3,
P = 0.01). Despite the fact that the appropriate threshold
of incongruence is not known, it has been argued that a
significance threshold of 0.05 might be too conservative
for the ILD test [110,111]. Given the overall homogeneity of the combined data and marginal incongruence of
H3 data, the data-set incongruence was not likely to
render an analysis of the combined data misleading.
Consequently, the phylogenetic inference based on the
combined data was the preferred description of pterioidean relationships, but one must be cautious when
interpreting the results with regard to the contribution
of the H3 data. The ILD tests together with phylogenentic analyses of individual data partitions and the assessment of their relative contribution to support on a
combined-data cladogram (measured by PBrS values)
were used to assess the distribution, nature, and extent
of agreement among data sets.
Combined analyses of molecular data

A parsimony analysis of the complete molecular data set
performed under equal-costs regime produced a single,
well-resolved optimal cladogram (L = 6027, CI = 0.56,
RI = 0.86; Figures 2, 3). The superfamily Pterioidea was
recovered as a monophyletic, well-supported clade (JK =
100%; BrS = 5), which was stable under most (92%)
combinations of alignment parameters. The few cases of
non-monophyly of the superfamily were due entirely to
the placement of Pulvinites exempla among the outgroup taxa as a sister group to the Ostreoidea (Figures
4d, h). This arrangement was recovered only under
parameter combinations characterized by the highest
indel/substitution ratio, suggesting that the spurious placement was due to missing data, an expected artifact
given the fact that P. exempla was the only taxon for
which only a small fraction of sequence data was available. Excluding P. exempla from the analysis did not
affect the relationships of the remaining taxa (1 MPT, L
= 5914, CI = 0.55, RI = 0.86), suggesting that the effect
of the missing data for this taxon on the relationships
among remaining ingroup taxa was negligible.
The suprageneric relationships were completely
resolved and all polytomies were restricted to a single
derived subclade within the Isognomon clade. All traditionally recognized families-with the obvious exception
of the monotypic Pulvinitidae-were recovered polyphyletic, whereas all genera (except for Electroma) were
definitively monophyletic. The monophyly of the genera Pulvinites and Crenatula could not be tested in the
present study because these genera were represented
by single exemplars. Thus, the polyphyly of the

families was a result of unconventional relative placement of traditionally recognized genera. The genuslevel clades were distributed in a fully pectinate pattern
of relationships with the basal-most Pulvinites and the
others branching off in the following sequence: Malleus, Pteria, Isognomon, Pinctada, Vulsella, and Electroma (the latter including Crenatula, thereby
rendering Electroma paraphyletic). The nodes along
the backbone had relatively high support (JK = 100%;
BrS = 5-26) and were stable under the majority of
alignment parameters (monophyletic under more than
92% of parameter combinations; Figures 2, 3, 5) with
the exception of the Vulsella/Electroma/Crenatula
group. Despite the high support values (JK = 100%;
BrS = 6) obtained under the equal-costs regime, the
monophyly of this clade was recovered in only 41% of
alignment parameter combinations. The sister-group
relationship of Crenatula and Electroma (excluding
E. papilionacea, the placement of which was highly
variable) was robust (JK = 100%; BrS = 26) and insensitive to parameter choice. The monophyly of all the
genera was very strongly supported (JK = 100%; BrS =
14-26) and entirely stable across alignment parameter
space (Figures 2, 3, 5). The monophyly of higher taxa
among the outgroups was strongly supported (JK =
100%; BrS = 14-79) in all analyses and was insensitive
to the choice of alignment parameters. The Ostreoidea
was identified as an immediate outgroup to the Pterioidea with high support (JK = 100%; BrS = 18) under
equal-cost regime, but the Pterioidea/Ostreoidea sistergroup relationship was highly sensitive to alignment
ambiguity and was obtained for only four (18%) combinations of alignment parameters. Effectively, all possible arrangements of the considered superfamilies were
recovered (Figure 4). The cladogram generated under
the parameter set that maximizes homology of both
sequence fragments and base correspondences
(1 MPT, L = 12508, CI = 0.24, RI = 0.52; Figure 6),
had a similar overall structure to the cladogram

generated under uniform weighting with several
important differences: (1) the placement of Isognomon
and Pteria clades were exchanged; (2) the Vulsella/
Electroma/Crenatula clade was not recovered; and (3)
the Pinnoidea was an immediate pterioidean outgroup.
Relative contributions of different data partitions, calculated as partitioned Bremer support values for each
node, are shown in Figure 7. Each locus provides support for some deep and apical nodes, but not all of
them. There also appears to be a slight taxonomic bias
in the distribution of the PBrS values: for example, relatively high PBrS values for most nodes within Pteria
were provided by 28S, whereas comparable in magnitude PBrS values for the majority of the nodes within
Pinctada were provided by 16S. Taken together, 18S
and 28S bring close to 75% of the signal and contribute
the highest on average support values; H3 provides the
least support (4.15%) and the lowest on average support
values. When the support of each gene was normalized
by the number of informative characters, 18S appeared
as most informative, providing more than twice the support as 28S, whereas 16S and H3 were the least informative markers in this data set.
A ML analysis of the complete molecular data set produced in a single optimal tree (-logLk = 30253.94; Figure 8). The values of suboptimal trees from 83.2% of
search replicates were within 0.01% of the optimal likelihood value; 11 of these had identical to the optimal likelihood values to the third decimal point and differed
only in the placement of several conspecific taxa. The
estimated shape parameter a of gamma distribution was
0.22; the substitution relative rate parameters for the
model were 0.86 (AC), 2.42 (AG), 1.61 (AT), 0.52 (CG),
4.15 (CT), 1.00 (GT; fixed). Comparison of the optimal
parsimony and ML topologies showed non-substantial
differences with regard to placement of several specieslevel taxa within Pteria and Malleus, and alternate
arrangement of conspecific individuals of Pinctada
imbricata.

Figure 4 Alternative hypotheses for the pterioidean sister group. Each panel represents a summary topology recovered for the
combination(s) of alignment parameters indicated by the sensitivity plots below. See Figure 2 for legend.

A parsimony analysis of the reduced molecular data
set performed under equal-costs regime resulted in a
single well-supported (JK = 97-100) cladogram (L =
3,094, CI = 70.43, RI = 67.40; Figure 9b). In spite of a
great difference in taxon sampling between the complete and reduced data sets, the higher-level relationships were nearly identical with only two notable
differences: in the analysis of the reduced data set Pulvinites exempla emerged as a sister taxon to the outgroup
Crassostrea virginica (rendering the Pterioidea polyphyletic) and a pinnid, Atrina rigida, was recovered as an
immediate outgroup to the Pterioidea. As suggested by
the analyses of the complete data set, missing data and
sensitivity to alignment ambiguity coupled with the limited taxon sampling of the reduced data set probably
account respectively for the instability in the position of
P. exempla and the placement of the immediate
outgroup.
The phylogenetic analyses of individual molecular data
partitions resulted in cladograms that differ in topology,
degree of resolution, and relative support measures.
However, all the analyses invariably recovered the

Pterioidea and major genus-level clades monophyletic.
(For detailed discussion of partitioned analyses of molecular data see additional file 2: Partitioned analyses.)
Combined analyses of morphological and molecular data

A parsimony analysis of the combined morphological
and the reduced molecular data sets (hereafter referred
to as the “combined reduced data set”) performed under
equal-costs regime produced a single, highly supported
tree (L = 3425, CI = 68.85, RI = 66.14; Figure 9c). When
compared to the tree generated for the reduced (molecular-only) data set analyzed under the same conditions,
the addition of morphological data reconstituted monophyletic the Pterioidea by placing Pulvinites exempla at
the base of the pterioidean subtree; the placement of the
remaining taxa was identical. Similarly, the arrangements of pterioidean genera in the analyses of the combined reduced and complete molecular data sets were
identical with the only significant topological difference
being the identity of the immediate pterioidean sistergroup: the Pinnoidea in the former and the Ostreoidea
in the latter.

Figure 5 Stability trees. Strict (a) and majority-rule (b) consensus trees summarizing cladograms resulting from sensitivity analysis of the
complete data set analyzed under 22 alignment parameter combinations (see text for details).

The paired-sites tests, applied to three topologies constrained to the identical arrangement of pterioidean taxa
(corresponding to that obtained in the analysis of the
combined reduced data set under uniform weighting),
but differing solely in the placement of the outgroup

taxa, showed that the compared trees were not significantly different (P > 0.05; Table 4). Only the monophyly
of the Ostreoidea-Pinnoidea clade could be rejected in
one set of tests under parsimony (KH test, P = 0.0243;
Templeton test, P = 0.0243).

Node number

Figure 7 Partitioned Bremer support (PBrS) analysis. The histogram shows proportional support of each locus for all the nodes (as labeled in
Figure 2). The table above the histogram summarizes the PBrS statistics for each locus. Χ, the average Bremer support; Σ, the total Bremer
support; %, the percentage of the cumulative Bremer support; %n, percent normalized by the number of parsimony informative characters.

A parsimony analysis of the combined morphological
and the complete molecular data sets (hereafter referred
to as the “combined complete data set”) produced a
well-resolved and strongly supported single optimal cladogram (L = 6358, CI = 56, RI = 86; Figure 10). The
topology was essentially the same as of the tree
obtained under the same conditions for the complete
molecular-only data set: the higher-level relationships
along the backbone were identical. The few differences
included an alternative placement of several clades
within Pteria (that had extremely low Bremer support
values and were unstable in the sensitivity analysis) and
the rearrangement of several, probably conspecific,
representatives of Isognomon. The most significant discrepancy between the analyses was the placement of
Electroma papilionacea. In the combined analysis it was
recovered at the base of the (Vulsella(Electroma/Crenatula)) clade, whereas in the molecular-only study it was
nested within it: (Vulsella(E. papilionacea(Electroma/
Crenatula))).

Discussion
Reliability of phylogenetic inference

The present study provides the first explicit hypothesis
for higher-level phylogeny and species-level relationships
for the bivalve superfamily Pterioidea based on DNA
sequence data.
Nearly complete species-level taxon and character
coverage suggest that the random error associated with

sampling was not likely to compromise the fidelity of
the results inasmuch as supraspecific relationships are
concerned. Uncertainty in species-level relationships
does, however, remain, due to incomplete taxon sampling, differences in character sampling among congeneric individuals, and potentially insufficient phylogenetic
signal of chosen markers for resolving recent divergences. Sequence alignment was straightforward and
unambiguous for the protein-coding gene. For the ribosomal sequences, the effect of the uncertainty in nucleotide positional homology on stability of inferred
relationships was evaluated using the sensitivity analysis,
which allowed for recognizing specific parts of the phylogeny affected by the uncertainty in nucleotide homology and evaluating the extent of its effect.
Nucleotide base composition was nearly perfectly stationary across taxa overall as well as for individual loci,
without evidence of taxon attraction due to similar
nucleotide-composition bias (e.g., [112,113]).
Substitution saturation in DNA sequences can potentially underestimate the actual amount of evolutionary
change and reduce the phylogenetic signal due to excessive multiple hits in the same nucleotide positions
resulting in extensive homoplasy (e.g., [52]). Despite the
fact that extensive saturation was detected for transitions in the 16S sequence, its effect on the phylogenetic
inference was negligible, as shown by (1) comparison of
the results from individual data partitions, (2) incorporating the Ts/Tv into phylogenetic analysis, (3) character

congruence among data partitions, and (4) consistency
in the distribution of BrS values. Furthermore, excluding
16S data from the analysis resulted in a decreased resolution and support throughout the tree. These results
are consistent with theoretical and empirical findings
suggesting that homoplasy does not necessarily confound phylogenetic inference [114-117] and that a given
site, which is homoplastic in a sub-part of the most-parsimonious tree, can bring phylogenetic information for
another sub-part of the same tree [118].
Heterogeneity in substitution rates among sites within
a nucleotide sequence can have considerable impact on
sequence divergence [56,119-121]. Substantial heterogeneity in substitution rates among lineages resulting in
long-branch attraction is another source of misleading
inference in molecular data [122,123]. The agreement
between the results of the maximum likelihood analysis
under the model allowing for variable base frequencies
and parsimony suggested that the predominance of transitions and among-site heterogeneity for most loci, as
well as among-lineage heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution rates (implied by the differences in branch
lengths) were not likely to be a source of misleading
inference. The absence of long-branch attraction despite
considerable differences in branch lengths was consistent with prior observation that extensively sampled
phylogenies are not sensitive to this artifact [124,125].
The doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) [126], which
has been reported for a number of bivalve species [127],
can potentially affect the accuracy of phylogenetic
reconstruction due to varying degrees of divergence and
homogenization between conspecific genomes. Within

the subclass Autolamellibranchiata, the instances of DUI
were reported only from the most basal extant group,
Mytiloida. Even though the lack of reported instances of
DUI in a particular group does not necessarily imply
that it is not present, the absence of strict dioeciousness
in the Pterioidea suggests that DUI was not a likely to
be a problem. All pterioidean species for which reproductive strategies have been elucidated (mostly members
of the genera Pinctada and Pteria), are rhythmical protandrous hermaphrodites, with occasional instances of
protogyny and simultaneous hermaphroditism, and
mtDNA appears to be maternally inherited [128].
Simultaneous analysis of a single data matrix combining independent character sets potentially increases the
descriptive efficiency and explanatory power [129], provides the basis for evaluating the relative support and
taking into account the hidden support provided by
individual partitions [130], and is less sensitive to sampling bias [131]. However, the incongruence among data

partitions may indicate that they have evolved under different models of evolution and render a combined-data
analysis misleading [132]. Despite topological differences
obtained in the analyses of individual data partitions, the
results of ILD tests showed that the data sets were largely congruent, implying that a single phylogeny underlies the relationships inferred from individual data
partitions. Differences in substitution rates across sites,
the average pairwise sequence divergence values, the distribution and levels of support (expressed in PBrS
values), and the extent of resolution obtained in the
analyses of individual partitions indicated that the marker loci collectively encompassed sufficiently broad spectrum of DNA sequence divergence to produce a nearly
completely resolved and well-supported tree. These
results also suggested that topological differences among
data partitions were probably due to characters that
evolved rapidly to provide a reliable signal for sub-terminal (recent) nodes of a tree, but produced noise for the
resolution of deeper (ancient) nodes. The overall
increased resolution and support of the combined-data
trees when compared to the results of partitioned analyses strongly speak for the simultaneous analysis
approach.
In summary, the present molecular sequence data and
the choice of methodology adequately account for sampling biases and potentially confounding (for phylogenetic inference) effects of various molecular evolutionary
processes, providing a strong foundation for accurate,
reliable, and robust reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships of the Recent Pterioidea.
Phylogeny of the Pterioidea

The present study corroborates the monophyly of the
superfamily Pterioidea and definitively rejects that of all
nominal pterioidean families (with the exception of the
monotypic Pulvinitidae). Whereas the non-monophyly
of some traditional pterioidean groups was anticipated
by prior studies [15,17-19], the arrangement of the genera was novel and unexpected, as well as resolved and
strongly supported.
In terms of taxonomic congruence with morphological
studies, the analysis of molecular data offered a considerably different phylogenetic hypothesis. Generally
assumed close relatedness of commercially important
genera Pteria and Pinctada was rejected by the molecular evidence, which was not entirely surprising given the
absence of unambiguously optimized non-homoplastic
characters supporting the sister-group relationship of
these taxa [15]. The presumed close relatedness of the
genera Malleus and Isognomon, implied by superficial
resemblance in shell morphology and similar life habits
[133-135], was also contradicted by the molecular data.
The only morphological character supporting a close

Page 22 of 28

relatedness of these two genera-the absence of food
grooves on inner demibranchs of the gills-is symplesiomorphic in the context of the DNA based topology, as
this condition has been also reported from other autolamellibranchiate taxa (e.g., Pectinidae and Limidae;
[136]). Contrary to previously proposed hypothesis
[15,137], this study rejected a close affinity of Isognomon
and Pulvinites, placing the latter at the base of the pterioidean tree. This finding was corroborated by the fact
that in the morphology-based analysis (Figure 9a) the
sister-group relationship of the two genera was weakly
supported and relied on a unique combination of shared
homoplastic characters (presence of the multivincular
ligament, absence of the pallial fold, and serial tissue
fusion of the distal edges of the demibranchs).
The present analysis provided the first molecular evidence for a peculiar clade, recently recognised on morphological grounds (Figure 9a) [15], that consists of
relatively understudied, low-diversity genera Electroma,
Vulsella, and Crenatula, that were traditionally placed
in Pteriidae, Malleidae, and Isognomonidae respectively.
The arrangement among the genera, however, varied
between the two studies. In the morphology-only analysis, where each genus was represented by a single exemplar, Electroma was basal to Vulsella and Crenatula, the
sister-group relationship between which was implied by
the reduction of the pedo-byssal apparatus. Instead, in
the molecular analysis, Vulsella appeared basal to the
Electroma clade that nested the sole representative of
Crenatula, rendering Electroma paraphyletic. An unanticipated discovery of polyphyletic Electroma requires
detailed morphological and taxonomic reappraisal of
this poorly known genus. Another species of Electroma,
typically placed in its own subgenus Pterelectroma,
E. (P.) physoides, invariably grouped with the Pteria
clade, putting into question the taxonomic status of this
subgenus.
Due to high sensitivity to alignment parameters and
taxon sampling, uncertainty remains regarding the identity of the sister group of the Pterioidea. The pairedsites tests, applied to the alternative topologies differing
only in the placement of the outgroup taxa, showed that
the trees were not significantly different. Consequently,
the sister-group of the Pterioidea could not be unequivocally inferred in light of the present results. Based on
the results of the combined-data analyses under uniform
weighting and predominant support (in terms of the
number of non-homoplastic morphological apomorphies), the Ostreoidea is tentatively proposed here as the
most likely pterioidean sister group.
Implications for homology of morphological characters

It has long been acknowledged that extensive homoplasy
is a recurrent theme in bivalve phenotypic evolution

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

[138-142] that can potentially mislead phylogenetic
inference based on morphological data alone. Optimizing morphological character state transformations onto
topology derived from the analysis of molecular data
provides means to discern putative homologies and
instances of homoplasy. The molecular analyses presented here have confirmed a number of suspected convergences identified on the basis of morphology, but
also uncovered a number of hitherto unanticipated ones.
The hypotheses of homology of several key characters
(that have been considered phylogenetically significant
in the Pterioidea as well as in other bivalves) were evaluated in light of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis based
on molecular evidence.
A duplicated outer fold of the mantle edge (a “fourfold” condition) has been considered a derived trait that
evolved twice independently in the Pterioidea based on
the analysis of morphological data [15] and in agreement with presumably “primitive” three-fold arrangement [143-146]. In contrast, molecular data suggested
that the four-fold condition was primitive in the Pterioidea, whereas the three-fold condition was a result of a
single reversal to the three-fold condition exhibited by
the outgroup taxa. This finding was not entirely unexpected, given the fact that analogous transitions in mantle evolution had occurred in other bivalve lineages [15].
In the analysis of morphological data, homorhabdic
ctenidia (simple gills characterized by a single type of
filaments) evolved once from heterorhabdic ctenidia
(that contain ordinary and apical filaments). Molecular
results, on the other hand, implied that the gill grades
had evolved iteratively and the ancestral condition could
not be unequivocally resolved. The presence of food
grooves in the outer demibranchs showed the same
pattern.
The loss of postlarval byssus and posterior pedo-byssal
retractor muscles has been previously considered as evidence for sister-group relationship of Vulsella and Crenatula [15]. Both features are likely to be adaptations
for living inside sponges, the habit shared by members
of the two genera, where physical stabilization is
achieved by the attachment to the host sponge. The
relationships inferred from the molecular data invariably
grouped Crenatula with Electroma, a relationship supported by a single unambiguously optimized nonhomoplastic apomorphy: a T-shaped (in cross-section)
typhlosole, a longitudinal fold of the intestine. Molecular
results were ambiguous with regard to the immediate
relatedness of the Vulsella and the Crenatula/Electroma
clades due to alignment uncertainty, and suggested a
possibility that the evolution of adaptation for living
inside sponges could have been two separate events.
This supposition is corroborated by prior ecological
observations that the host specificity, and the nature of

Page 23 of 28

mutualistic association of Vulsella and Crenatula species
with their demosponge hosts are different: the former is
a facultative mutualist with keratosid sponges, whereas
the latter is an obligatory mutualist with monaxonid
sponges [147,148]. Species of Vulsella possess a relatively thick and elongated shell with an extremely abbreviated hinge line and a narrow prismatic margin that
provide a rigid “endo-skeleton” for the sponge, hence
facilitating the host’s growth. Species of Crenatula, on
the other hand, have a very thin shell with a very wide
prismatic margin, which appears to be influenced by the
sponge growth, and produce highly irregular shell
shapes without consistent orientation. The particular
form of the multivincular ligament of Crenatula allows
for curvature of the extensive hinge line, which facilitates attachment along the hinge line to irregular surfaces. The loss of postlarval byssus in distantly related
Malleus albus (not included in the analysis of morphological data) also supports the likelihood of convergence.
The symmetry and relative placement of abdominal
sense organs (ASOs), paired mechanoreceptors typically
found on the surface of the adductor muscle, have been
previously shown to be phylogenetically informative
within Autolamellibranchiata [149,150] and, specifically,
within the Pterioidea [15]. In the morphology-based
analysis, the clustering of the ASOs around the anus
was inferred as a primitive condition in the Pterioidea
(found in both ostreid and pinnid outgroup taxa),
whereas the dorsal displacement of the right ASO had
occurred twice. According to the results of the molecular character analysis, both aspects of the ASO position
had evolved twice.
A set of characters that has historically been used for
higher-level systematics of pterioidean and other autolamellibranchiate taxa is associated with the types of ligament and their support structures. According to the
molecular-based topology, the multivincular ligament
characterizes three distantly related genera: Pulvinites,
Isognomon, and Crenatula. Morphological data alone
also identified an independent origin of multivincular
ligament in Crenatula, but suggested a sister-group relationship of Pulvinites and Isognomon on the basis of
shared ligament morphology and two other homoplastic
characters. It is noteworthy that despite apparent similarity between multivincular systems in Pulvinites and
Isognomon, the pattern of ligostracum deposition and
the ontogenetic sequence of origination of ligamental
layers along the hinge line differ between the genera.
Even though not entirely congruent, the results of the
molecular and morphological studies reject the longstanding assumption of close relatedness based on a
single origin of multivincular ligament in the Pterioidea.
The present molecular evidence confirmed the taxonomic significance of the shape of the anal funnel, an

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

ear-shaped membranous structure situated at the posterior extremity of the rectum that presumably facilitates
expulsion of fecal pellets. The absence of the anal funnel
in Pulvinites is consistent with its basal placement in the
Pterioidea as the same condition is displayed by the outgroup taxa. In contrast, in the analysis based on morphological data, the lack of the funnel was inferred as a
loss. The molecular and morphological analyses agree
that the anal funnel is subtriangular in outline in the
more basal pterioidean clades, whereas it is characteristically lanceolate and rounded in two most derived
clades, Pinctada and Vulsella/Crenatula/Electroma,
respectively.
Given the uncertainty in the identity of pterioidean
sister group, it is instructive to explore the effect of
alternative combinations of outgroup taxa on the distribution of diagnostic morphological characters using the
best available hypothesis of the ingroup relationships.
To this end, morphological characters were optimized
on three trees constrained to the identical arrangement
of the ingroup taxa (corresponding to that obtained in
the analysis of the combined reduced data set under
uniform weighting) but differing in the placement of the
outgroups.
The Pinnoidea(Ostreoidea/Pterioidea) relationship (L
= 330, CI = 0.52, RI = 0.53) was defined by five unambiguously optimized, non-homoplastic apomorphic characters that remained unchanged above this node: (1) the
descending intestine produced towards the posteroventral side of the posterior adductor muscle; (2) the loss of
the anterior adductor muscle (monomyary); (3) the
absence of the pseudonymphae; (4) the presence of a
resilifer throughout ontogeny; and (5) the placement of
the posterior adductor muscle entirely within the
boundary of the inner shell layer. Previously, Steiner and
Hammer [18] had mapped a set of morphological characters on to their maximum likelihood tree substantiating their finding of ostreoidean/pterioidean sister-group
relationship by two characters: the monomyary and the
presence of the anal funnel. The present study confirmed the monomyaryan condition as a synapomorphy
of the clade, but not the occurrence of the anal funnel
in different superfamilies, interpreted here as a result of
independent origins, as was previously suggested on the
basis of morphological data [15,22]. The Ostreoidea(Pinnoidea/Pterioidea) relationship (L = 334, CI = 0.51, RI =
0.52) was defined by three apomorphic characters: (1)
the absence of the marginal mantle lobe fusion; (2) the
absence of the eulaterofrontal cirri of gill filaments; and
(3) the ascending intestine not produced anteriorly
passed the stomach. The Pterioidea(Ostreoidea/Pinnoidea) relationship (L = 333, CI = 0.52, RI = 0.52) was
defined by two apomorphic characters: (1) the absence
of the ciliated discs on gill filaments and (2) the

Page 24 of 28

clustering of ducts of the digestive diverticula. Given
comparable levels of homoplasy and the lack of a priori
criteria to differentially weigh the characters supporting
each of the possibilities, the arrangement supported by
the largest number of apomorphies and yielding the
shortest tree length, that is (Pinnoidea(Ostreoidea/Pterioidea)), is the preferred hypothesis of relationship.
Species-level taxonomy of Pinctada

Despite the fact that the focus of the present study was
to establish higher-level relationships within the Pterioidea, it provided significant insights into species-level
taxonomy of the genus Pinctada, a commercially important and the most exhaustively sampled group.
The present study suggests that Pinctada imbricata,
P. fucata, and P. radiata are distinct genealogical units.
The taxonomic status of the P. imbricata/fucata/radiata
species complex previously remained unsettled due to
extensive variation in shell characters within and among
populations, extremely wide geographical distribution,
and transport and hybridization by humans [32]. Traditionally, three distinct species were recognized corresponding to three biogeographic realms: P. imbricata in
the western Atlantic region, P. radiata in the eastern
Indian Ocean and the Red Sea regions, and P. fucata in
the Indo-Pacific region. The Japanese populations have
frequently been regarded as a distinct species, P. martensii, or a subspecies, P. fucata martensii. Because of its
major role in perliculture, the species complex had
become a major research focus in recent years. A large
number of comparative genetic analyses using allozyme
and DNA sequence data indicated significant levels of
gene flow over large geographic distances among populations of Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific regions, resulting in low levels of genetic differentiation [8,32]. The
pattern of genetic differentiation among the Chinese,
Japanese, and Australian populations using amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers was
consistent with isolation by distance [151,152]. Shell
morphometric studies [153,154], mating experiments
[155], and comparative karyotype analyses [156-158]
failed to establish unequivocal species delineations. To
date, no diagnostic discrete morphological characters
have been identified for populations from the three geographical regions.
The present results showed shallow levels of divergence among the members of the P. imbricata/fucata/
radiata species complex, comparable to the levels of
divergence of conspecific exemplars of other Pinctada
species. However, the three groups were reciprocally
monophyletic showing an apparent clinal geographical
structure. Therefore, it might be meaningful to treat
these individual populations as evolutionary significant
units (ESUs). Taking into account the comparatively low

Tëmkin BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/342

divergence values and the lack of diagnostic morphological characters distinguishing these groups, from the
taxonomic standpoint it is advocated here to provisionally recognize them at a subspecies level under the
senior synonym, P. imbricata (as Pinctada imbricata
imbricata, P. imbricata fucata, and P. imbricata
radiata). The final word on the taxonomic status of
these taxa will depend on the future population-level
analysis with dense sampling throughout the entire distribution range and using genetic markers more sensitive for resolving recent divergencies.
This study also suggested that Pinctada albina and P.
nigra, generally distinguished by shell color (as their
names imply), represent two colormorphs of the same
species. This possibility has been previously suggested
based on extremely low levels of genetic divergence
between two exemplars of P. albina and one of P. nigra
[151]. This finding was consistent with other molecular
studies that invariably resolved these species (represented by single exemplars) as sister taxa [159-161]. The
present analysis contained three exemplars of each colormorph that were always recovered as a monophyletic
group and never formed separate clades diagnosed by
color.
In addition, based on the fact that P. mazatlanica
invariably nested among representatives of P. margaritifera or members of both species formed an unresolved
clade, the present study provides preliminary support
for conspecificity of these two species. These findings
need to be investigated further and cannot be definitively tested given the present sample size.

Conclusions
The most significant conclusion from the phylogenetic
analyses presented here is that the state of pterioidean
systematics is no longer in chaos. The present results
establish a solid-however unconventional- framework
for the higher-level taxonomy of the group, focusing
future revisionary systematic effort and providing a better grasp of standing alpha-diversity. The phylogeny is
crucial for understanding processes and patterns of
diversification and morphological evolution of the Pterioidea through time. To this end, the major future challenge lies in integrating the knowledge on the Recent
pterioideans with information on the extensive, welldocumented fossil record of the group. As throughout
their history, pterioideans remain a globally distributed,
relatively common group of bivalves found in most
warm, shallow marine environments around the globe,
and are likely to display patterns of diversity typical of
other marine benthic macrofauna. Therefore, the
insights gained from the phylogenetically-informed studies of pterioidean bivalves might be broadly applicable
across marine invertebrates.
