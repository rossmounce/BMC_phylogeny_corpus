Abstract
Background: Nucleoside diphosphate kinases NDPK are evolutionarily conserved enzymes present in Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya, with human Nme1 the most studied representative of the family and the first identified
metastasis suppressor. Sponges (Porifera) are simple metazoans without tissues, closest to the common ancestor of
all animals. They changed little during evolution and probably provide the best insight into the metazoan
ancestor’s genomic features. Recent studies show that sponges have a wide repertoire of genes many of which are
involved in diseases in more complex metazoans. The original function of those genes and the way it has evolved
in the animal lineage is largely unknown. Here we report new results on the metastasis suppressor gene/protein
homolog from the marine sponge Suberites domuncula, NmeGp1Sd. The purpose of this study was to investigate
the properties of the sponge Group I Nme gene and protein, and compare it to its human homolog in order to
elucidate the evolution of the structure and function of Nme.
Results: We found that sponge genes coding for Group I Nme protein are intron-rich. Furthermore, we discovered
that the sponge NmeGp1Sd protein has a similar level of kinase activity as its human homolog Nme1, does not
cleave negatively supercoiled DNA and shows nonspecific DNA-binding activity. The sponge NmeGp1Sd forms a
hexamer, like human Nme1, and all other eukaryotic Nme proteins. NmeGp1Sd interacts with human Nme1 in
human cells and exhibits the same subcellular localization. Stable clones expressing sponge NmeGp1Sd inhibited
the migratory potential of CAL 27 cells, as already reported for human Nme1, which suggests that Nme’s function
in migratory processes was engaged long before the composition of true tissues.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the ancestor of all animals possessed a NmeGp1 protein with properties and
functions similar to evolutionarily recent versions of the protein, even before the appearance of true tissues and
the origin of tumors and metastasis.

Background
The Nme family, initially called nucleoside diphosphate
kinases (NDPK) or Nm23, are evolutionarily conserved
proteins present in all three domains of life: Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya [1]. Vertebrate Nme enzymes can
be separated into two evolutionarily distinct groups. In
humans, Group I includes Nme1-Nme4 and Group II
includes Nme5-Nme9 proteins. Nme10, also known as
XRP2, was the last described member and apparently

has a somewhat different evolutionary history to Group
I or Group II genes; it is characterized by a recent insertion of a partial NDPK domain [2]. The human Nme1
was recognized as the first metastasis suppressor and is
the most studied member of the Nme family of proteins
[3]. In contrast to tumor suppressor genes, metastasis
suppressor genes do not abolish or diminish the tumorigenicity of a tumor, they only affect its potential to
metastasise. This means that a metastasis suppressor fulfills its biological function within the processes linked to
the metastatic cascade: tumor cell dissociation, invasion
of the surrounding tissue, journey through the blood
circulation, invasion and secondary tumor growth at

a distinct site in the body [4]. In addition to melanoma
[5], the metastasis suppressor activity of Nme1 has been
detected in breast [6], cervical [7], hepatocellular carcinoma [8], and several other neoplastic lesions [5]. The
Nme1/NDPK A and Nme2/NDPK B protein products
represent two subunits of a well known, house-keeping
enzyme - nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK). These
subunits can assemble into the enzymatically active hexamer in all possible combinations (A6, A5B....... AB5,
B6) [9]. NDPK is involved in the maintenance of the cellular NTP pool, transferring the phosphate group
through the histidine phosphointermedier. Interestingly,
it seems that this biochemical feature of NDPK is not
responsible for its antimetastatic activity [10]. Subsequently, several other biochemical functions have been
assigned to this protein: histidine kinase activity [11,12],
3’-5’ exonuclease and DNA cleavage activity [13], and
transcriptional regulatory activity [14]. The Nme family
is known to participate in numerous crucial biological
events such as proliferation [15], differentiation [16,17],
development [18,19] and apoptosis [20,21], as well as in
adhesion, migration [22], and vesicular trafficking [23].
In spite of the comprehensive scientific activity in this
area it is still unclear which biochemical/biological activities are responsible for Nme’s antimetastatic role.
A recent evolutionary study on all known vertebrate
Nmes showed that Nme1 and Nme2 arose by cisduplication [2]. Nme1 and Nme2 proteins are 88% identical in amino-acid sequences and their genes are
located next to each other. Although very similar in primary structure, Nme1 and Nme2 are well distinguished
by their distinct pI value: 5.8 and 8.5, respectively. Cisduplication and the appearance of Nme1 probably
occurred in a common ancestor of amniotes [2]. However, Bilitou et al. [1] observed two NmeGp1 sequences
in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis also located next
to each other, and Desvignes et al. [24] found independent duplications of NmeGp1 genes in several opisthokont lineages.
Sponges (Porifera) are the simplest metazoan phylum
and branched off first from the common ancestor of all
animals [25,26], however, see also [27,28] for an alternative view. They have changed little during evolution and
can provide insight into the metazoan ancestor’s genomic features [29-33]. The genome of the marine sponge
Suberites domuncula encodes at least two Nme proteins.
One belongs to Group I and displays a high similarity to
its human Nme1 homolog (Nm23-H1), therefore it was
named Nm23-SD1 when it was first described [34]. In
accordance with the new nomenclature, this protein is
now renamed to NmeGp1Sd. The other protein,
Nme6Sd (previously Nm23-SD6) is most similar to
human Group II member Nme6 protein (Nm23-H6)
[34]. The total number of Nme proteins in S. domuncula

is possibly greater than two because the EST database
used in the S. domuncula Nme study [34] contained at
most 4500 non-redundant cDNA sequences which is
certainly far less than the total number of genes in the
S. domuncula genome. Orthologues of human Nme5,
Nme6 and Nme7 appeared very early in animal
evolution and are present in basal metazoans - cnidarian N. vectensis and placozoan T. adhaerens as well as
in choanoflagelate M. brevicollis genomes. Group I
Nme diversified much later, after the appearance of
chordates [1,24]. Therefore, we expect that most of the
Nme enzymes in sponges are probably members of
Group II.
Although the sponge S. domuncula NmeGp1Sd protein displays high similarity with vertebrate Nme1, the
most recent Group I member, it may reflect characteristics of the protein ancestral to Group I, before the later
duplications and diversifications that have occurred
within this Group. Our goal was to determine the gene
structure and study the biochemical characteristics and
functions of the S. domuncula protein NmeGp1Sd.
Furthermore, we wanted to test whether it can substitute for the most recent (and the most studied) Group I
member human Nme1, and show a similar ability to
suppress migration and, therefore, possibly even the
metastatic potential of human cancer cells in vitro.

Results
Structure and evolution of sponge Group I Nme gene

Group I Nme genes were analyzed in two sponges:
Amphimedon queenslandica and Suberites domuncula.
Only one gene coding for Group I Nme enzyme was
found in the genome of the sponge A. queenslandica.
A search of the corresponding EST database revealed
the presence of two cDNA types with 5’untranslated
regions (UTRs) 63 bp and 76 bp long, and therefore the
existence of two transcription initiation sites. The
5’UTR region of NmeGp1Sd is 18 bp long and the transcription start site is located after oligopyrimidine tract.
In A. queenslandica the TATA box-like motif (CCTATCAGCT) was identified in a region -33 to -24 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start of the
shorter EST. In S. domuncula the NmeGp1Sd gene
TATA box like motif (TCTAGAAATT) was found
spanning from -81 to -72 nucleotides. The human
Nme1 gene has no TATA box. It contains a number of
motifs which may bind known transcriptional regulatory
proteins such as AP-1, CTF/NF1, ACAAAG, and Ets
[35]. An Ets binding sequence was found spanning from
-70 to -61 nucleotides (ACCGGACGCC) in the
promoter region of the NmeGp1 gene from sponge
A. queenslandica and from -365 to -374 nucleotides
(ACAGGATATA) in the promoter region of the
NmeGp1Sd gene from sponge S. domuncula. Chen et al.

[36] showed that the presence of a motif typical for
AP-1 transcriptional elements in the 5’ region of the
human Nme1 gene is essential for promoter activity. A
putative site for AP-1 in the A. queenslandica NmeGp1
5’ flanking region was found spanning from -117 to
-125 nucleotides (TTGACTCAG) and in S. domuncula
NmeGp1 from -130 to -138 nucleotides (ATGTCTCAG). The structure of sponge NmeGp1 promoter
regions is shown in Additional file 1.
The Nme gene from A. queenslandica is 654 bp long
from the ATG start codon to the TAG stop codon. It
has four short introns with lengths of 47, 47, 57 and 47
bp, respectively. The NmeGp1Sd gene from S. domuncula coding region and introns encompasses 736 bp
from the ATG start codon to the TAA stop codon and
contains three introns (89, 57 and 134 bp). Their positions and phases are shown in Figure 1. Multiple
sequence alignment of NmeGp1Sd gene homologs was
produced and used to compare intron positions. The
results are shown in Figure 1. NmeGp1Sd gene lacks the
fourth intron which is present in the homolog from A.
queenslandica.
As mentioned before, two NmeGp1 genes in the cnidarian N. vectensis were found. Like Nme1 and Nme2 in
mammals and lizard, these two genes are located next
to each other. Therefore, we checked neighboring genes
in the genome of A. queenslandica and found that the
NmeGp1 gene is surrounded by unc50 and acad8 genes
and not by another Nme homolog. Extensive searches of
the A. queenslandica genome [32] and S. domuncula

number in the triangle denotes the phase: 0, intron insertion

a codon; 2, intron insertion after the second base. Intron lengths are

cDNAs [33] revealed only one NmeGp1 gene in each of
these two demosponges. Independent duplications have
also been identified in Branchiostoma floridae and
Ciona intestinalis [2] as well as more recently in other
opisthokonts [24]. Searches of NCBI’s dbEST revealed
the presence of cDNAs that encode two NmeGp1
proteins in the calcareous sponges Sycon raphanus
[GenBank:AM764253 and GenBank:AM764213] and
Leucetta chagosensis [GenBank:GO094744 and GenBank:GO094741]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that distinct sponge proteins from the same species clearly
group together, indicative of independent duplications
(Additional file 2). The cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata
also has at least two Group I member genes which are
not located next to each other in the genome. Demosponge proteins cluster in a poorly supported and poorly
resolved branch together with cnidarian, placozoan,
S. purpuratus and B. floridae homologs while calcarean
proteins form a separate branch.
The sponge NmeGp1Sd protein forms a hexamer

Various oligomeric structures such as hexamers, tetramers, dimers, and monomers were found after crosslinking the NmeGp1Sd protein with glutaraldehyde.
Recombinant NmeGp1Sd appears to be predominantly
in the hexameric form (Figure 2A). A similar oligomeric
pattern was observed with the recombinant human
Nme1 protein. The hexameric form was expected due
to the conservation of the KPN loop (residues 91 to 113
in NmeGp1Sd). Each KPN loop interacts with two
others with helices a1 and a3, and with the four
terminal residues [1], well preserved in the sponge
NmeGp1Sd (residues 148 to 151). Residues Lys 30, Pro
95 [37] and Ser 119 [38] known to be crucial for

NmeGp1Sd (8 μg) was pre-incubated in PBS at room temperature
with 25 mM of glutaraldehyde to initiate the cross-linking. After
quenching, the reaction product was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE
gel followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. (B) Size

(300 mm × 7.8 mm) and eluted with Nm23 buffer at a flow rate of
0.5 mL/min. Black line represents human Nme1 and grey line

hexamer formation are also conserved in the sponge
NmeGp1Sd (Additional file 3). Thus, we can conclude
that all the residues necessary for the hexameric structure are present in the sponge NmeGp1Sd enzyme, and
known residues that could impede this structure are
absent. The hexameric structure of sponge NmeGp1Sd
was also confirmed by gel filtration (Figure 2B). Previously described human Nme1 [39] was used as marker. Overlapping gel filtration peaks confirm our finding
that both proteins have a similar molecular weight as
well as hexameric structure.
The sponge NmeGp1Sd protein has a similar level of
kinase activity as the human Nme1 but shows nonspecific
DNA-binding activity

The specific kinase activities of the sponge NmeGp1Sd
and human Nme1 enzymes were measured in parallel
and found to be 496 U/mg and 407 U/mg, respectively.
In comparison, Ma et al. [13] found the kinase activity
of Nme1 protein to be 570 U/mg while Bago et al. [39]
observed 237 U/mg. The specific activities of the sponge
NmeGp1Sd enzyme and human Nme1 kinase were similar and within the previously reported ranges for the
human protein.
Purified NmeGp1Sd protein is able to bind nonspecifically to single-stranded circular DNA (sscDNA)
(Figure 3). Binding activity was observed with concentration of 0.8 μM, manifested by increase in DNA band
retardation. The majority of the protein-DNA complexes
at concentrations of NmeGp1Sd >1.7 μM exist in
the form of big aggregates which stack in the wells
(Figure 3, left). Human Nme1 did not display an ability
to bind sscDNA, while human Nme2 binds sscDNA and
shows the same DNA band retardation effect as sponge
NmeGp1Sd. However, higher concentration (>4 μM) of

Figure 3 DNA-binding activity of the NmeGp1Sd protein.
Human Nme1 and Nme2 proteins were used as control. The
reaction was performed in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 7.5) and 12 mM MgCl2, 30 nM of single-stranded circular (ssc)
DNA from bacteriophage jX174 and purified NmeGp1Sd protein as
indicated. 40 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) containing 50% glycerol and
0.01% bromophenol blue was added before the products were
analyzed in 0.6% agarose gel.

human Nme2 protein was needed to form the same
amount of aggregates (Figure 3, right).
The sponge NmeGp1Sd does not cleave negatively
supercoiled DNA

Nme2 is involved in DNA structural changes necessary
for the activity of the c-myc promoter. It binds to the
NHE sequence of the c-myc promoter cloned into
pUC19 which yields mostly open circle (nicked circular)
plasmid [40]. We have considered the possibility that
the sponge NmeGp1Sd may already have DNA topoisomerase-like activity similar to the human Nme2. To
test this activity, NmeGp1Sd protein was incubated with
supercoiled pUC19 plasmid containing the 57-bp c-myc
NHE sequence. We used topoisomerase I, Nme1 and
Nme2 proteins as controls. Control topoisomerase I and
human Nme2 cleaved negatively supercoiled plasmid
DNA unlike NmeGp1Sd and human Nme1 which did
not display this activity (Figure 4).
The human cell recognizes the sponge Nme as its own

The objective of testing the localization and function of
sponge NmeGp1Sd in well established human in vitro
systems was to reveal whether the sponge NmeGp1Sd
can be recognized as the domestic protein in the human
cell and whether it can replace its human homolog. To
compare the subcellular localization of human Nme1
and NmeGp1Sd in HEp-2 cells we transiently transfected the cells with pEGFPN1-Nme1 and pDsRedN1NmeGp1Sd. We analyzed the cells 48 hours post
transfection using confocal laser scanning microscopy
(Figure 5). The localization of Nme1-GFP was mainly
the same as in a previous study [41] in which Nme1
was fused to the C-terminus of GFP (reverse orientation). The signal is mainly present in the cytoplasm, has
a punctiform structure with occasional bigger highly

indicated. After 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and proteinase K treatment

and then stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 30 min. SC

fluorescent “granum-like” structures present in the cytoplasm, often, but not exclusively, located adjacent to the
nucleus. Nme1 can also very clearly be seen in a portion
of the nuclei. The NmeGp1Sd-DsRed reveals the same
localization pattern which could be seen in separate figures and merged with human Nme1 (yellow staining).
To confirm the NmeGp1Sd nuclear localization we performed additional experiments and transfected HEp-2
cells with pEGFPN1-NmeGp1Sd since the GFP has a
brighter fluorescence than the DsRed and is, therefore,
easier to analyze. These experiments confirmed the
occasional presence of NmeGp1Sd in the nucleus. The
fluorescent NmeGp1Sd also seems to form “granumlike” structures and they colocalize with the ones formed
by human Nme1. These experiments show that the
human and the sponge Nme colocalize - adopt the same
distribution in all transfected HEp-2 cells analyzed, at
any time-point. These experiments encouraged us to
further analyse the interaction of human Nme1 and
NmeGp1Sd in human cells.

NmeGp1Sd (S1 and S2) were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG
M2 affinity gel and immunoblotted with anti-Nme1 antibody. K0control (clone with “empty” construct). FLAG/Nme1 produces
heteromers with exogenous (upper band) and endogenous (lower
band) Nme1. FLAG/NmeGp1Sd produces complexes with the
endogenous (human) Nme1 while the upper band (exogenous,
FLAG/NmeGp1Sd) cannot be seen, since the antibody is specific for
human Nme1. D) Immunoprecipitation: FLAG/Nme1 (K1 and K2)
and FLAG/NmeGp1Sd (S1 and S2) were immunoprecipitated with
anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and

FLAG/Nme1 produces heteromers with exogenous (upper band)
and endogenous (lower band) Nme1. FLAG/NmeGp1Sd produces
complexes with the endogenous (human) Nme1. The upper band
(exogenous, FLAG/NmeGp1Sd) is visible, since it is stained with antiFLAG antibody.

In Western blot analysis a few CAL 27 clones expressing NmeGp1Sd were identified, and two of them (S1
and S2) were chosen for further analysis (Figure 6A and
6B). To test the possible interactions of sponge and
human Nme proteins we used the previously produced
Nme1 overexpressing CAL 27 clones K1 and K2 [39].
To test if sponge FLAG/NmeGp1Sd forms complexes
with endogenous human Nme1, FLAG was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of FLAG/Nme1 overexpressing clones (K1 and K2), and FLAG/NmeGp1Sd
expressing clones (S1 and S2) with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. The results of the Western blot analysis with
anti-Nme1 or anti-Nme1 and anti-FLAG antibody reveal
that FLAG/NmeGp1Sd forms complexes with the endogenous Nme1 (lower band in Figure 6C and 6D). Therefore, we have proved that the human Nme1 recognizes
the sponge variant as a partner. The final confirmation

well as human Nme1 overexpressing clones as previously published [39]) have substantially diminished
migratory potential. Therefore, NmeGp1Sd suppresses
motility of CAL 27 cells. The same result was observed
in three independent experiments.

transfected with “empty vector” (K0).

of our theory that the human cell recognizes the sponge
protein as its own comes from tests in Boyden chambers. The intention of this experiment was to test the
migration potential of CAL 27 cells stably expressing
sponge NmeGp1Sd, and compare it with the human
Nme1 overexpressing cells that show diminished
migratory potential compared to control, CAL 27 cells.
Figure 7 shows that NmeGp1Sd expressing clones, (as

Discussion
The objective of this study was primarily to determine
the structure and biochemical characteristics of the
NmeGp1Sd in order to gain a deeper insight into the
evolution of metazoan Nme proteins and their
functions.
Sponge Group I Nme genes are intron-rich and these
introns are relatively short. The same has been found
for introns in several other sponge genes [42,43] and
recently in A. queenslandica genome where median
intron size is 80 bp [32]. The fourth intron (Figure 1) is
likely the most ancient because it is also found in a
choanoflagellate Group I Nme homolog. We conclude
that the ancestral metazoan Group I Nme gene was
intron-rich and probably had all four introns that are
still present in most extant basal metazoan homologs.
The ancestral gene structure is also well preserved in
vertebrate homologs with three out of four introns present. D. melanogaster has only one of the ancestral
introns and C. elegans lost all ancestral introns and
gained two new ones which likely reflect accelerated
evolution in these lineages. Analysis of sponge NmeGp1
promoters showed that some of the motifs essential for
human promoter activity are also present in sponges.
We did not find these motifs in the corresponding choanoflagellate promoter under the same search parameters, which indicates a possible change in Nme1
regulation in the metazoan lineage.
The phylogenetic tree (Additional file 2) is generally
not well resolved or supported, as in comparable earlier
studies [1,2,24]. Nonetheless, it does provide some new
evidence on Group I Nme evolution. Group I Nme gene
duplicates in N. vectensis had been proposed to indicate
that the split into Nme1 and Nme2 might have occurred
very early in metazoan evolution [1]. Another recent
study [24] showed that duplications of Group I Nme
genes occurred independently more than once in invertebrates, besides well described duplications and diversifications of Group I Nme to Nme1, 2, 3 and 4 in
vertebrate lineage, and that duplication in N. vectensis is
also an independent event unrelated to the origin of
Nme1 and Nme2. Our results confirm these findings
and additionally demonstrate independent duplications
in basal metazoans, even within the same lineages (cnidarians and calcareous sponges).
The metastasis suppressor genes Nme are highly conserved in opisthokonts. This implies that they have
important roles in basic cellular functions. A number of

Perina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/87

studies revealed several potential biological roles of Nme
genes/proteins, but most are not confirmed in vivo. The
expression of the D. discoideum Nme homologues gip17
and guk7.2 is modulated during the developmental
phases of cell growth or aggregation due to starvation
[44]. In Drosophila, Nme/Awd is required for the proper
differentiation of many tissues including the brain, eye,
and female reproductive system [45]. Nme protein accumulation is coincident with the functional differentiation
of multiple epithelial tissues in the developing mouse
[18]. These and many other studies demonstrate that
Nme proteins have a critical role in differentiation and
development - processes that involve cell migration, a
prerequisite for metastasis formation [1].
The sponge protein NmeGp1Sd was compared primarily with human Nme1 (and Nme2) for several reasons: i) The NmeGp1Sd is highly similar to vertebrate
Nme1/Nme2 in primary structure, ii) human Nme1/
Nme2 proteins are the most studied and well characterized Group I Nme members iii) Nme1 is linked to
metastasis suppression, but the suppression mechanism
is not well understood. We expected that NmeGp1Sd
analysis and the discovery of its biochemical features
would shed some more light into the mechanisms connecting various Nme1 functions and its antimetastatic
activity. A recent study by Domazet-Lošo and Tautz
[46] shows that, contrary to what might be intuitively
expected, only a subset of cancer genes appeared simultaneously with multicellularity in animals and that the
new genetic processes and gene functions that emerged
at the basis of the metazoan lineage are major innovations which enabled complex interactions between
metazoan cells. Demosponges have only one Group I
Nme protein (whereas amniotes have four with potentially different functions), which is probably the ancestral condition for metazoans.
Our results show that the sponge NmeGp1Sd possesses some biochemical characteristics typical for
human Nme1 and some typical for human Nme2 protein. Recombinant NmeGp1Sd appears to be predominantly in the hexameric form like human Nme1 protein
which was confirmed by gel filtration (Figure 2A and
2B). The sponge NmeGp1Sd and human Nme1 enzymes
also have similar levels of kinase activity. Human Nme1
did not display an ability to bind sscDNA, however,
human Nme2 can bind sscDNA and showed the same
DNA band retardation effect as the sponge homolog.
Accordingly we decided to check the possibility that the
sponge NmeGp1Sd is functionally more similar to
Nme2 than to Nme1. Unlike Nme1, Nme2 is able to
cleave c-myc NHE sequence [40]. Therefore, we tested
whether the sponge NmeGp1Sd also has DNA topoisomerase-like activity and found out that it is not able
to cleave c-myc NHE sequence. We hypothesize that

Page 7 of 12

this was the ancestral condition of the Nme Group I
protein before duplications and functional diversifications within the Group I Nme. Sponge NmeGp1 may
have retained the multiple functions, while these functions have been partitioned between different vertebrate
Group I Nme proteins. Recent studies showed that
sponge genomes are comparable to genomes of “higher”
complex animals, including vertebrates, in terms of gene
number and functional repertoire [32,33]. It was suggested that complex animals differ from their early simple relatives mainly in the more complex regulation of
similar sets of genes. From that point of view, it could
be speculated that the ability of Nme2 to cleave c-myc is
a relatively recent addition to the regulatory networks.
Based on this evidence we then asked the following:
What is the biological function of NmeGp1Sd in its
native environment - the sponge cell? As it can suppress
the migration of CAL 27 cells e.g. replaces the human
Nme1 it could thus be involved in migration and/or,
possibly, adhesion of sponge cells. It has previously been
found that sponges possess genes/proteins for many
advanced physiological processes usually linked to more
complex metazoan phyla [31,47]. Migration of cells in
complex “higher” animals is limited to specific processes
such as embryonic development and immune response
and is closely controlled. Cells are anchored in the
developed tissues they belong to and do not migrate if
not stimulated (with the exception of cells undergoing
malignant transformation). The anchorage and migration of cells depends on a vast number of molecules
such as cadherines, integrins, fibronectin and collagen.
Although sponges do not possess true tissues and
organs, they do possess simple varieties of the mentioned proteins [48,49]. Furthermore, they have complex
pelagobenthic life cycles which include development to
a larval phase and metamorphosis to sedentary adult
form [50]. Cell migration is present in sponges in three
different processes: regeneration, larval development and
the movement of amoeboid cells through the adult
mesohyl; the space between the external and internal
cell layers which is composed of galectin, collagen, fibronectin-like molecules and dermatoponin [51]. Although
the mesohyl is not a homogenous, organized structure,
it resembles a primitive extracellular matrix (ECM).
Therefore, both the movement of amoeboid cells
through the mesohyl in sponges and the movement of
cells through ECM in vertebrates may originate from
the same ancient precursor process present in the
metazoan last common ancestor. From an evolutionary
point of view, tumors likely developed together with the
evolution of tissues and organs. It is not yet defined
which biochemical functions of Nme are crucial for its
metastasis suppressor activity. It is, however, to be
expected that its main biological function (besides the

Perina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/87

well defined NDPK function), would not be to suppress
metastasis in “higher” Metazoa but to control normal
physiological processes (adhesion, migration) which, if
left without control, could lead to metastasis formation.
As sponges do not possess tissues and organs they are
probably also incapable of forming tumors. The demonstration of the fact that the sponge NmeGp1Sd can
replace human Nme1 in human tumor cells encourages
us to propose that the NmeGp1 (at least Nme1) function responsible for regulating adhesion/migration of
cells was established in the metazoan ancestor well
before the Cambrian explosion i.e. before the appearance of diverse groups of multicellular Metazoa. Since
tumors likely started developing in parallel with the
development of true tissues and organs, this ancient
function of Nme1 was then adapted to act in a new
highly significant role - the suppression of metastasis.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study emphasizes three major points:
i) the single sponge Group I Nme gene and Nme protein
of Suberites domuncula probably reflects the characteristics of the ancestral Group I Nme gene/protein, that
existed prior to the duplication of this group in vertebrates and other lineages; ii) NmeGp1Sd possesses many
biochemical properties of the most recent Group I variant, the Nme1 human homolog; iii) NmeGp1Sd interacts with human Nme1 and can replace it in some
biological functions which are usually associated with
“higher” metazoans, specifically in metastasis suppression. Therefore, we presume that the Group I Nme
gene/protein of the metazoan last common ancestor was
structurally and functionally similar to the multifunctional enzyme it is today.
Methods
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses

For genomic DNA preparation, the specimens of
S. domuncula were cut into pieces, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, ground to fine powder from which total DNA
was isolated using the Genomic DNA Purification kit
(QIAGEN). Sponge NmeGp1Sd gene was amplified by
PCR, using KOD XL DNA polymerase (Novagen) and
primers specific for the 5’-(GCTTTTCTGTGTGT
GGAGCTT) and 3’-(TCCCTAAACCAAAAAGTTACTCAT) ends of the cDNA coding sequence [GenBank:
AY764256]. The amplified fragment was separated on a
0.8% agarose gel, purified and sequenced. The reverse
specific primer 5’- CATGGCAACCATCTTGAAGCC
-3’ was used in conjunction with the vector specific primer T3 to amplify the 5’ upstream region from translation start of the nmeGp1Sd gene on the genomic library
from S. domuncula [52].

Nucleotide sequences were stored and analyzed using
Lasergene (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Multiple sequence
alignments (MSA) were performed with CLUSTALX
[53]. The exact position and the phase of each intron
were verified by manual inspection. MEGA4 [54] was
used to construct and bootstrap phylogenetic trees.
The homolog of the NmeGp1Sd gene from the sponge
Amphimedon queenslandica was identified in the genome (contig13509) available at http://spongezome.metazome.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/amphimedon/ [32]. Homology
searches and sequence retrievals were done using
BLAST (NCBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA: http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). NmeGp1 sequences from sponges
Leucetta and Sycon were identified by blastn with
nmeGp1Sd sequence against NCBI’s dbEST limited to
Porifera. Hamming clustering method for TATA signal
prediction in eukaryotic genes was used for identifying
TATA-box http://www.itb.cnr.it/sun/webgene/ [55].
TFSEARCH http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.
html and TRANSFAC database [56], with a default
threshold score of 85 were used for searching -400 bp 5’
flanking region for possible transcription factors binding
sites.
Plasmid constructions

We used the same set of primers as for NmeGp1Sd gene
to perform PCR reactions on the S. domuncula cDNA
library. The PCR generated cDNA fragment was cloned
into pBluescript vector (Stratagene). The cDNA for
NmeGp1Sd was recloned into pET15b (Novagen) using
PCR into BamHI (5’-TTCCCGGATCCAAAAAGT
TACTCATAGATC-3’) and NdeI (5’-GCTTTATACA
TATGACAACCGAGCGTACC-3’) restrictions sites of
pET15b expression vector downstream from the thrombin cleavage site. For colocalization assay, the full-length
coding sequence NmeGp1Sd was cloned in frame into
pEGFPN1 and pDsRedN1 expression vectors (Clontech,
USA). The fragment of 541 bp was amplified using 5’GCTTTCTCGAGATGACAACCGAGCGTACC-3’ and
5’-GTAGACGGATCCTTCTCATAGATCCATTGCTG3’ primers. The PCR product was digested with XhoI
and BamHI, and ligated with the XhoI/BamHI sites of
pEGFP-N1 and pDsRedN1 expression vectors. The
pEGFPN1-Nme1 was a kind donation of Dr. Marie-Lise
Lacombe, Faculty of Medicine St. Antoine, Paris, France.
NmeGp1Sd cDNA was amplified using a forward primer
containing the FLAG sequence (F: 5’-GTCTAGGGATC
CACGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGATAA
GATGACAACCGAGCGT-3’) and the reverse primer
(R: 5’-CTAGACGAATTCTTATTACTCATAGATC
CATTGCTGTTCTGTGGG-3’). The PCR product was
cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).

Protein expression and purification

NmeGp1Sd was overproduced in Escherichia coli strain
BL21 tagged with six histidine residues at the Nterminus and purified to homogeneity from bacterial
lysates using nickel affinity chromatography. E. coli strain
BL21 harboring the plasmid construct was grown to 0.6
at OD600 and induced with 0.8 mM IPTG for 3 hours at
37°C. Cells were incubated 30 min on ice in lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and
1mg/mL lysozyme) and sonicated 8 × 30 sec (50% of the
full power). After centrifugation (12000 rpm) for 25 min
at 4°C, the supernatant was applied onto nickel-charged
agarose column (Qiagen). Histidine tagged proteins
bound to nickel-affinity resins were eluted with 500 mM
imidazole. NmeGp1Sd protein was applied to a PD-10
desalting gel filtration column (Sephadex, GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 25 mL of Nm23 buffer [57] (20 mM
HEPES at pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM
DTT and 0.1 M KCl) and then eluted with 3.5 mL of
Nm23 buffer. The polyhistidine tag was released from
the fusion protein by cleaving with thrombin (Sigma) (2
U/40 μg of fusion protein) for 16 hours at room temperature. The human Nme1 protein was a kind donation of
Dr. Ioan Lascu (Institut de Biochemie et Genetique
Cellulaires-IBGC, Bordeaux, France).
Protein cross-linking with glutaraldehyde

Oligomerization of the recombinant protein NmeGp1Sd
was performed in PBS buffer as described by Kim et al.
[38] for human Nme1 proteins with modified conditions: eight μg of sponge NmeGp1Sd was pre-incubated
in PBS at room temperature and 25 mM of glutaraldehyde was added to initiate the cross-linking. Following
5 min incubation, the reaction was quenched with 0.2
M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at room temperature.
The reaction product was subjected to 12.5% SDSPAGE and visualized by protein staining with Coomassie
brilliant blue.
Gel filtration chromatography

Recombinant human Nme1 and sponge NmeGp1Sd
were loaded onto Bio-Sil SEC 250 gel-filtration columns
(300 mm × 7.8 mm) and eluted with Nm23 buffer [57]
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (BioLogic Duo Flow, BIORAD). Peak fractions were used for NDP kinase assay.

Page 9 of 12

40 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) and 12 mM MgCl2. After
15 min of incubation at 37°C, 4 μL of 40 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) containing 50% glycerol and 0.01% bromophenol blue was added and the products were
immediately subjected to gel electrophoresis at 3 V/cm
in 0.6% agarose for 3 hours using 40 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA as running buffer.
NDP kinase assay

Enzyme-coupled Reaction-NDPK activity was measured
using a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase
assay [57,59]. Five hundred μL of reaction mixtures
were incubated in quartz cuvettes at room temperature
in the presence of ATP as phosphate donor and dTDP
as phosphate acceptor. The final concentrations were as
follows: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 75 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/mL NADH,
1 mM ATP, 0.2 mM dTDP, 2 U/mL of pyruvate kinase,
2.5 U/mL of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin. All reagents and enzymes were
purchased from Sigma. Reactions were initiated by the
addition of 50 ng of NmeGp1Sd enzyme and activity
was monitored in an Ultrospec® 2100 pro (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, USA) measuring the decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm. The control reactions omitting
NmeGp1Sd produced minor rates but were subtracted
from the NmeGp1Sd values. The same reaction was performed with human Nme1 enzyme.
Plasmid cleavage assays

We cloned the double stranded 57-bp NHE (nuclease
hypersensitive element) of the c-myc promoter (5’GATCCCCAGTCTCCTCCCCACCTTCCCCACCCTC
CCCACCCTCCCCATAAGCGAATT-3’) insert into
pUC19 plasmid. Recombinant plasmid pUC19-NHE
(500 ng) was incubated with 500 ng of NmeGp1Sd
protein. The reaction was assembled in 50 mM KCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT,
30 μg/mL BSA and incubated 30 min at 20°C. The reaction was terminated with 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and
proteinase K treatment (200 μg/mL) for 30 min at 55°C.
Topoisomerase I (Gibco BRL), Nme1 and Nme2 proteins were used as controls and were processed in the
same conditions. Samples were analyzed in 1% agarose
gel in TAE buffer and than stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 30 min.

DNA-binding assay

The DNA-binding activity of the NmeGp1Sd protein
was assayed in vitro as described [58]. Reactions contained 30 nM of single-stranded circular DNA from bacteriophage jX174 (NEB). The amount of purified
NmeGp1Sd protein is indicated (Figure 3). Human
proteins Nme1 and 2 were used as controls. The reaction mixture was incubated in 20 μl of buffer containing

(DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in
humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Transient transfections and laser scanning confocal
microscopy

Twenty four hours before transfection 3 × 104 HEp-2
cells were seeded on eight-well culture slides (BD-Falcon) to obtain 60% confluence. Each chamber was transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA: pEGFPN1-Nme1,
pEGFPN1-NmeGp1Sd, or cotransfected with
pDsRedN1-NmeGp1Sd and pEGFPN1-Nme1 (0.5 μg of
each construct) using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty eight
hours post transfection the cells were washed with PBS
(phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5), fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and mounted in mounting medium (DAKO)
supplemented with 1 μg/mL 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Sigma) for nuclear staining.
Fluorescent images were obtained by Leica TCS SP2
AOBS laser scanning confocal microscopy equipped
with HCX PL APO l-Blue 63 × 1.4 objective. GFP was
excited by 488 nm laser line, DsRed using 543 nm, and
DAPI using 405 nm laser line.
Preparation of stably transfected CAL 27 clones

Stably transfected cell lines were prepared as described
previously [60]. In brief, CAL 27 cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with pcDNA3FLAG/NmeGp1Sd and pcDNA3 as control. Post transfection the cells were resuspended and incubated in
DMEM supplemented with geneticin (Sigma) until
development of resistant colonies. Positive clones were
screened by Western blotting, propagated and frozen
until further usage. The clones with overexpressing
FLAG/Nme1 (K1 and K2) have been formed in the
exact same way and are the same ones used in [39].
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting

For detection of Nme1/NmeGp1Sd complex formation
1 × 106 CAL 27 cells stably transfected with “empty”
vector (K0), as well as CAL 27 cells stably expressing
FLAG/NmeGp1Sd (S1 and S2) and FLAG/Nme1 expressing clones (K1 and K2) were seeded on 6-well plates
overnight. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG/Nme1 was
performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfered to an Imobilon-PSQ membrane (Milipore).
The membranes were incubated with anti-Nme1 antibody (Beckton-Dickinson) or with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and Nme1 antibody for detection of
complex formation. Protein bands were visualized using

Chemiluminiscence blotting substrate-POD (Roche) on
Lumi-Film-Chemiluminiscent Detection Film (Roche).
Migration in Boyden chambers

Boyden chamber assay was done as described before
[39]. Briefly, two six well plates were seeded with 3 ×
10 5 cells (CAL 27, CAL 27 stably transfected with
“empty” vector, CAL 27 constitutively overexpressing
FLAG/Nme1 (K1 and K2) and CAL 27 constitutively
expressing NmeGp1Sd (S1 and S2)) overnight. After
attachment the cells were starved in serum free medium
for 24 hours at 37°C in a humidified chamber. After
starvation the cell suspension (4 × 105 cells) was added
to the upper chamber of Cell Culture Inserts (BecktonDickinson) and allowed to settle down for 10 min.
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS served as a chemoattractant and was added to the lower chamber. Cells
were allowed to migrate for 20 hours. Nonmigratory
cells were detached with cotton swabs, membranes were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, cut out from the inserts, mounted in mounting medium (DAKO) and analyzed by light microscopy. The
migrated cells were analyzed at 400 × magnitude. Three
images per membrane were acquired and analyzed in
ImageJ program http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html
which measured the area of the membrane covered with
migrated cells.
