Molecular evolution of urea amidolyase and urea
carboxylase in fungi
Pooja K Strope1, Kenneth W Nickerson1, Steven D Harris2,3 and Etsuko N Moriyama1,3*

Abstract
Background: Urea amidolyase breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide in a two-step process, while
another enzyme, urease, does this in a one step-process. Urea amidolyase has been found only in some fungal
species among eukaryotes. It contains two major domains: the amidase and urea carboxylase domains. A shorter
form of urea amidolyase is known as urea carboxylase and has no amidase domain. Eukaryotic urea carboxylase
has been found only in several fungal species and green algae. In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin of
urea amidolyase and urea carboxylase, we studied the distribution of urea amidolyase, urea carboxylase, as well as
other proteins including urease, across kingdoms.
Results: Among the 64 fungal species we examined, only those in two Ascomycota classes (Sordariomycetes and
Saccharomycetes) had the urea amidolyase sequences. Urea carboxylase was found in many but not all of the
species in the phylum Basidiomycota and in the subphylum Pezizomycotina (phylum Ascomycota). It was
completely absent from the class Saccharomycetes (phylum Ascomycota; subphylum Saccharomycotina). Four
Sordariomycetes species we examined had both the urea carboxylase and the urea amidolyase sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that these two enzymes appeared to have gone through independent evolution
since their bacterial origin. The amidase domain and the urea carboxylase domain sequences from fungal urea
amidolyases clustered strongly together with the amidase and urea carboxylase sequences, respectively, from a
small number of beta- and gammaproteobacteria. On the other hand, fungal urea carboxylase proteins clustered
together with another copy of urea carboxylases distributed broadly among bacteria. The urease proteins were
found in all the fungal species examined except for those of the subphylum Saccharomycotina.
Conclusions: We conclude that the urea amidolyase genes currently found only in fungi are the results of a
horizontal gene transfer event from beta-, gamma-, or related species of proteobacteria. The event took place
before the divergence of the subphyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina but after the divergence of the
subphylum Taphrinomycotina. Urea carboxylase genes currently found in fungi and other limited organisms were
also likely derived from another ancestral gene in bacteria. Our study presented another important example
showing plastic and opportunistic genome evolution in bacteria and fungi and their evolutionary interplay.

Background
Fungi exhibit great metabolic flexibility in the diversity of
carbon and nitrogen sources they can use. We have been
especially interested in their nitrogen sources, most
recently urea [1,2]. In a previous study [1], a dichotomy
was observed with regard to urea utilization in fungi.
Hemiascomycetes (yeasts and yeast-like fungi; the majority
belongs to the class Saccharomycetes of the phylum

Ascomycota) possess the urea amidolyase (DUR1,2; Degradation of URea) genes whereas all other fungi examined
possess the nickel-containing urease sequences. Urea amidolyase is an energy dependent biotin-containing enzyme.
It is encoded by the DUR1,2 gene and was first characterized in the yeast Candida utilis, now known as Pichia
jadinii [3]. The activity of this enzyme was also detected
in green algae such as Asterococcus superbus and Chlamydomonas reinhardii. Urease and urea amidolyase activities
were not observed together in the same green algal
species; it was either one or the other [4,5]. This cytoplasmic, biotin-dependent enzyme [6] consists of a single

polypeptide chain with regions for urea carboxylase (EC
6.3.4.6) and allophanate hydrolase (also known as amidase;
EC 3.5.1.54) activity. Two adjacent genes (DUR1 and
DUR2) were originally considered to encode the two
enzymes; but later they were renamed as a single gene,
DUR1,2 [7].
Urea amidolyase breaks down urea into ammonia and
carbon dioxide in a two-step process, while urease (EC
3.5.1.5) does this in a one-step process [1] as shown in
the following equations:
[Urea carboxylase] urea + ATP + HCO3 − → allophanate + ADP + Pi

(1)

[Allophanate hydrolase (amidase)] allophanate → 2NH3 + 2CO2 (2)
[Urease] urea → 2NH3 + CO2

(3)

There are two forms of urea amidolyase proteins.
Figure 1 shows the domain structure of urea amidolyase
and related proteins. A shorter form of urea amidolyase
is known as urea carboxylase, and has no amidase
domain attached to it. This protein is found in several

Urea Amidolyase (UA),
~1800 aa

fungal species [1], green algae [8], and has been also
characterized in bacteria [9].
The urea carboxylase protein (as well as the domain) is
further divided into sub-domains: the biotin-carboxylation
domain, allophanate hydrolase subunit 1 (AHS1) domain,
allophanate hydrolase subunit 2 (AHS2) domain, and
the biotin-lipoyl domain (Figure 1). The function of
the AHS1 and AHS2 domains is still unknown. The biotin-carboxylation domain and the biotin-lipoyl domain of
urea carboxylase are commonly found in various
other carboxylases including pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc),
methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase (MccA), acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (Acc1), and propionyl-CoA carboxylase
(PccA) [10].
In Navarathna et al. [1], we suggested that urea amidolyase likely arose before the divergence of the hemiascomycetes and the euascomycetes (filamentous fungi;
the subphylum Pezizomycotina of the phylum Ascomycota), c. 350 - 400 million years ago, by insertion of a
gene encoding allophanate hydrolase into a methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase (mccA) gene, thus creating DUR1,2
and inactivating mccA. This suggestion was made

based on the InterPro protein domain database [38]. The abbreviations and approximate amino-acid lengths are given with the protein names.
Amidase and urea carboxylase sequences exist as domains within the urea amidolyase protein or as single proteins by themselves. Similarly, the
biotin-carboxylation sequence exists as a domain in various proteins as well as by itself as in the biotin-carboxylase protein.

because of the corresponding dichotomies: the hemiascomycetes have DUR1,2 but do not have mccA whereas
the rest of the fungi have both urease and mccA [1].
The present paper investigates the evolutionary origin of
DUR1,2, the urea amidolyase gene, more thoroughly.
We studied the distribution of urea amidolyase, urea
carboxylase, and urease proteins in various species
across all kingdoms, and biotin-carboxylation domain
containing proteins, i.e., Acc1, Pyc, PccA, and MccA, in
various fungal species. Contrary to our previous speculation, an ancestral urea amidolyase gene likely arose in
bacteria and then appeared in the fungal lineage before
the divergence of the subphyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina by prokaryote-to-eukaryote horizontal
gene transfer. There have been studies indicating such
bacteria-to-fungi horizontal transfers [e.g., [11-15]]. Our
study adds yet another important example showing evolutionary interplays between bacteria and fungi and how
plastic and opportunistic the fungal genome evolution
can be.

Results and Discussion
Urea amidolyase is unique to the kingdom fungi among
eukaryotes

We have previously shown that long and short forms of
urea amidolyase are present in fungi [1]. The urea amidolyase protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(phylum Ascomycota; subphylum Saccharomycotina) is
1,835 amino acids (aa) long. As shown in Figure 1, the
first 632-aa region in the N-terminus of the protein consists of the amidase domain. The remainder of the
sequence is the urea carboxylase domain, which consists
of four smaller sub-domains. As mentioned before, the
shorter form of urea amidolyase lacks the amidase
domain and the urea carboxylase domain exists as a
whole protein. This urea carboxylase sequence (1,241
aa) has been identified from a filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (phylum Ascomycota; subphylum Pezizomycotina). Using these protein and domain sequences,
we first examined if these two forms of urea amidolyase
exist in eukaryotes outside of the fungal kingdom.
As shown in Table 1 (see also Additional file 1), urea
amidolyase is absent in non-fungal eukaryotic genomes
we examined. Blastp similarity search against the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) database also showed no sequence
similar to urea amidolyase from any other eukaryotic
species. However, urea carboxylase and amidase genes
are present in all four green algae we examined. In
three of the four green algae, the amidase genes are
located near the urea carboxylase genes but not adjacent
to them. The distance between these two genes ranged
from 588 to 6,236 bp in these green algae (see Additional file 2). The absence of urea amidolyase gene but
the presence of urea carboxylase and amidase genes in

C. reinhardtii suggests that the activity of urea amidolyase seen previously in this species [3-5] is not due to
the urea amidolyase protein but the combined activity
of urea carboxylase and amidase proteins. Although we
did not find sequences similar to urea carboxylase from
any of the metazoan genomes we examined, similarity
search against NCBI nr database turned up two
sequences from Hydra (Hydra magnipapillata). One of
them, however, was found actually to be a sequence of a
putative bacterial symbiont. These Hydra sequences are
discussed further later. No amidase sequence was found
from Hydra or any other eukaryotes other than fungi
and green algae.
Urease was found in both plant genomes we examined: Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot) and Oryza sativa (a
monocot). Similarity search against NCBI nr database
also showed a wide distribution of urease in higher
plants. While none of the green algal genomes we examined had urease (Table 1), it was identified in distantly
related and more ancestral types of green algae (Ostreococcus and Micromonas) by searching against NCBI nr
database. On the other hand, in metazoa, urease was
found only in a limited number of genomes. In addition
to Nematostella vectensis (a sea anemone, Table 1), only
three metazoan urease sequences were found in the

Strope et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/80

NCBI nr database (from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,
Branchiostoma floridae, and Ixodes scapularis). These
observations are not consistent with what we observed
earlier in fungi, where all fungi that lack urea amidolyase seemed to possess urease ([1]; also described next).
Distribution of urea amidolyase and other related
proteins among fungi

We searched 64 fungal genomes for urea amidolyase, urea
carboxylase, and amidase. For selected 27 fungal genomes,
we further searched urease as well as proteins that share
the biotin-carboxylation and the biotin-lipoyl domains
(Acc1, Pyc, MccA, and PccA proteins; see Figure 1). These
searches were conducted to examine the earlier hypothesis
of Navarathna et al. [1] that the fungal urea amidolyase
may have been formed by the extension of a biotin carboxylation gene that was already present in fungi.
Our search results are summarized in Table 2 and
Additional file 3 (see also Additional files 4 and 5). The
results are also mapped on the current consensus of the
fungal phylogeny [16,17] in Figure 2. Among the fungi
we examined, only the class Sordariomycetes (subphylum Pezizomycotina; except for Neurospora crassa and
its close relative in the order Sordariales) and the class
Saccharomycetes (subphylum Saccharomycotina) had
the urea amidolyase sequences. In one species, Yarrowia
lipolytica, there were two copies of urea amidolyase.
Urea carboxylase was found in many but not all of the
species in the Pezizomycotina while being completely
absent from the Saccharomycotina. Interestingly, except
for Fusarium graminearum (known also as Gibberella
zeae), the species belonging to the order Hypocreales
(Nectria, Fusarium, and Trichoderma) had both the urea
carboxylase and the urea amidolyase sequences. Many
of these species are found in soils and associated with
plants [18-20]. Dothideomycetes species did not have
urea amidolyase, but many contained amidase as well as
urea carboxylase sequences. However, the location of
these two genes (amidase and urea carboxylase) was not
near each other in their genomes. They were located in
different scaffolds or supercontigs (see Additional file 2).
Consistent with the earlier observation [1], the urease
protein was present in all the fungal species examined
except for those of the Saccharomycotina. Two species
(F. graminearum and F. oxysporum) had two copies of
this protein. Previously only two Sordariomycetes
species (Magnaporthe oryzae, previously known as
M. grisea, and F. graminearum) were observed to possess
both of urease and urea amidolyase. We now confirmed
that all Sordariomycetes species except for N. crassa and
closely related species have both of these enzymes.
Why do the Saccharomycetes species use the energydependent, biotin-containing urea amidolyase system
and abandon the urease that accomplishes the same

Page 4 of 15

overall reaction in a simpler process? This question
becomes even more germane when we consider that all
strains of C. albicans are biotin auxotrophs [21], and it
has long been known that 2 to 4 times as much biotin
is required for maximum growth of S. cerevisiae on
urea, allantoic acid, or allantoin as sole nitrogen sources
[22]. However, the dichotomy in distribution of urease
and urea amidolyase among some fungal lineages coincides precisely with that for the Ni/Co transporter
(Nic1p), which is present in those fungi that use urease
and absent in those that do not [23]. In Navarathna
et al. [1], we suggested that the selective advantage of
using urea amidolyase over using urease is that it
allowed the Saccharomycetes species to jettison all Ni2+
and Co2+ dependent metabolisms and thus to have two
fewer transition metals whose concentrations need to be
regulated. However, while reasonable for the Saccharomycetes, such selective advantages may not be great
enough to abandon the use of urease particularly in the
Sordariomycetes species. Further investigation is needed
to elucidate whether retaining two types of urea degradation enzymes in the Sordariomycetes species is in fact
selectively advantageous rather than redundant.
We also examined the distribution of biotin-carboxylation domain containing enzymes. Acc1 and Pyc were
present in all the fungal species we examined. MccA
was absent almost completely from the Saccharomycetes
and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (phylum Ascomycota;
subphylum Taphrinomycotina), but was present in the
rest of the fungi we examined. PccA was present in
fewer species than MccA was, and was completely
absent from the classes Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes. MccA was present along with urea amidolyase
and urea carboxylase in three species (Fusarium verticilloides, F. oxysporum, and Nectria haematococca), and
along with only urea amidolyase in three other species
(F. graminearum, M. oryzae, and Y. lipolytica). A phylogenetic analysis using the biotin-carboxylation domains
of Pyc, Acc1, MccA, PccA, urea amidolyase, and urea
carboxylase from fungi showed that these domain
sequences were highly diverged. Bootstrap analysis did
not show any significantly supported clustering of urea
amidolyase and urea carboxylase with any of the other
four enzymes (see Additional file 6). Urea amidolyase
and urea carboxylase appear to have no clear direct origin among the other biotin-carboxylation domain containing proteins. Or such divergence may have
happened such a long time ago that we can no longer
identify the origin.

proteins among eubacteria

forms of urea amidolyase found in fungi: whether they

share a common evolutionary origin or arose independently, we performed extensive similarity searches using
these protein and domain sequences among 56 bacterial
genomes. As shown in Table 3 (see also Additional
file 7), the longer form of urea amidolyase (~1,800 aa)
was found only in one bacterium, Pantoea ananatis
(class Gammaproteobacteria). This bacterium, which previously belonged to the genus Erwinia but was recently
reclassified into the genus Pantoea, is a well-known plant
pathogen with a reported case of it also being a humanpathogen [24,25]. This bacterium and its related species
are usually isolated from soil, fruits, and vegetables [24].
Urea carboxylase (~1,200 aa), the shorter form of urea
amidolyase, was found in bacterial species scattered
among a wide range of groups. Almost all bacteria with

urea carboxylase also had amidase. These two enzymes are
encoded in two different genes in bacteria, but are located
next to each other in most of the bacterial genomes we
examined (see Additional file 8). In two species (Wolinella
succinogenes, class Epsilonproteobacteria; and Gloeobacter
violaceus, phylum Cyanobacteria), the two genes were not
adjacent to each other but only 943 bp and 1,701 bp apart,
respectively, while in another Cyanobacteria species (Cyanothece sp.), the two genes were located far apart (979,743
bp). Sorangium cellulosum (class Deltaproteobacteria) and
Nitrosomonas europaea (class Alphaproteobacteria) had
urea carboxylase but lacked amidase. Three Gammaproteobacteria species have two urea carboxylase genes, only
one of which lies next to the amidase gene. P. ananatis, a
gammaproteobacteria, which has urea amidolyase (the

long form), also has urea carboxylase (the short form).
Furthermore, P. ananatis has no independent amidase
gene. The only amidase sequence present in this bacterium is the domain of the urea amidolyase gene. It seems
reasonably likely that fusion of the amidase and urea carboxylase genes occurred in P. ananatis to generate the
long form of the urea amidolyase gene similar to those
found in fungi.

The urease protein in bacteria occurs as a trimer of
alpha, beta, and gamma subunits encoded by separate
genes forming a gene cluster, whereas in eukaryotes a
single gene encodes the urease protein, a fused protein
representing the three bacterial subunits [26]. In some
bacteria, beta and gamma subunits are fused and
encoded by one gene (denoted with ß/g in Table 3)
while in others either beta- or gamma-subunit gene was

missing. As shown in Table 3, existence of these ureasesubunit genes was scattered throughout the bacterial
groups. Of 56 bacterial genomes we examined, 31 had
either or both of urease and amidase/urea carboxylase
(or urea amidolyase). Only seven of 31 bacterial species
had all three genes. Consistent with what we observed
in fungi, there appears to be a certain degree of dichotomy in possession of urease genes or amidase/urea carboxylase (or urea amidolyase) genes among bacterial
genomes.

the urea amidolyase, and the amidase genes of the other
three gammaproteobacteria species lie immediately adjacent to their urea carboxylase genes (see Additional file
8). These bacterial amidases cluster with fungal amidases
from urea amidolyase with a strong bootstrap support
(100%). Compared to the fungal stand-alone amidases
(Fungi A), the fungal amidase-domain sequences from
urea amidolyase (Fungi UA) are clearly more closely
related to the bacterial amidases, especially to those from
P. ananatis and a small number of gamma- and betaproteobacteria species (Bacteria A1).

Phylogenetic analysis of amidase domain sequences

In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic urea amidolyase proteins, we performed phylogenetic
analysis among amidase, urea amidolyase, and urea carboxylase identified across kingdoms. Phylogenies were
reconstructed using amidase and urea carboxylase
sequences separately.
Figure 3 is the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree
reconstructed from the amidase domain sequences from
urea amidolyase and the amidase protein sequences
from fungi, green algae, and bacteria (the minimumevolution tree is shown in Additional file 9). It shows
that the fungal amidase domain from urea amidolyase
(shown in blue and denoted by UA in Figure 3), and the
stand-alone fungal amidase protein that exists on its
own (shown in blue and denoted by A in Figure 3) cluster separately, implying that they have evolved independently. The amidase sequences from green algae (shown
in green in Figure 3) cluster with the stand-alone amidase protein from fungi, however, with not very strong
bootstrap support (76%).
Bacterial amidase sequences also cluster into two
groups (shown in red in Figure 3). Amidases from four
gammaproteobacteria species (P. ananatis, Pantoea sp.
At-9b, Pectobacterium carotovorum, and Cellvibrio japonicus) and one betaproteobacteria species (Achromobacter
piechaudii) form a cluster (denoted by A1 in Figure 3).
Notably, the amidase sequence of P. ananatis is part of

Phylogenetic analysis of urea carboxylase domain
sequences

Figure 4 shows the result of maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis using the urea carboxylase protein and
urea carboxylase domain sequences from urea amidolyase (the minimum-evolution tree is shown in Additional file 10). The urea carboxylase sequence (~1,200
aa) is twice longer than the amidase sequence (~600 aa),
which resulted in a better resolution in the reconstructed phylogeny. Bacterial urea carboxylase sequences
were clearly divided into two clusters (denoted by UC1
and UC2 in Figure 4) where both were supported by
100% bootstrap values. The UC1 group, which consists
of the five species of gamma- and betaproteobacteria
(P. ananatis, Pantoea At-9b, P. carotovorum, C. japonicus, and A piechaudii), clustered closely with the fungal
urea amidolyase (UA) with a high bootstrap value (97%).
These five bacterial species are the same five species
found in Figure 3 (A1) whose amidases clustered with
the amidase-domain sequences of the fungal urea
amidolyase. Four of these five bacterial species have a
second urea carboxylase gene. Thus, the duplication
event that created these two sets of urea carboxylase
genes must have happened before the divergence of
the five proteobacteria. Based on the deep divergence
between the paralogous groups (UC1 and UC2) and the
somewhat slower evolution observed in UC1 (the urea

carboxylase genes found only in five gamma/betaproteobacteria species), we speculate that the close functional
association with amidase likely arose in the UC1
group to create a fused single gene, urea amidolyase, in
P. ananatis, and thus changed the evolutionary rate and
pattern in this copy of urea carboxylase.

We also see two separate and strongly supported clusters of urea carboxylase sequences in fungi. One cluster
is of the urea carboxylase domain from urea amidolyase
(UA, 100% bootstrap support) whereas the other cluster

Strope et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/80

sequences in the two groups have independently evolved
over a long period of time. Since urea carboxylase was
found in the phylum Basidiomycota (represented by
Cryptococcus neoformans in Figure 4) and it clustered
with other urea carboxylase proteins, the divergence
between urea carboxylase and urea amidolyase in fungi
must have preceded the Ascomycota-Basidiomycota
divergence. As we discuss in the next section, the formation of urea amidolyase with acquisition of the amidase domain seems to have happened most likely in a
bacterial lineage. Note that the urea carboxylases from
green algae clustered with the fungal urea carboxylases
(with 100% bootstrap support) rather than with the fungal urea amidolyases. This clustering pattern is consistent with what we observed in the amidase phylogeny
(Figure 3) where green algal genes clustered with the
stand-alone version of the fungal amidase genes rather
than with the amidase-domain sequence of urea amidolyase. Although in some green algae, amidase and urea
carboxylase genes are located relatively closely (within
588 to 6,236 bp; Additional file 2), their evolution is
completely independent from urea amidolyase genes
found in fungi.
As mentioned before, two Hydra urea carboxylase
sequences were found from the NCBI nr database
search. One of them was actually found to be a
sequence of a putative bacterial symbiont, Curvibacter
(betaproteobacteria) (described in NCBI gi|260221606
entry). Phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that this
sequence belongs to the bacterial urea carboxylase
(UC2) group (see Additional file 11). The other Hydra
sequence clustered with urea carboxylase sequences
from green algae and fungi (93% bootstrap support).
Bacterial origins of the fungal urea amidolyase and urea
carboxylase

Our phylogenetic analysis did not support the previous
hypothesis that the fungal urea amidolyase and urea carboxylase sequences are formed from fungal biotincarboxylation domain containing proteins such as MccA
or PccA. Instead, our conclusion is that the urea amidolyase and urea carboxylase genes currently found in fungi
and green algae, as well as in Hydra, are the results of horizontal gene transfer events from bacteria. This is based
on observations such as the abundant distribution of the
shorter form of urea amidolyase, i.e., urea carboxylase, as
well as the single occurrence so far of urea amidolyase
(the long form) in bacteria, coupled with the rarity of both
forms of urea amidolyase in eukaryotes except in the fungal kingdom, in some green algae, and in Hydra.
Phylogenetic analysis of amidase and urea carboxylase
sequences across kingdoms showed that the urea carboxylase domain in urea amidolyase and the urea

Page 11 of 15

carboxylase protein itself have undergone extensive
independent evolution. Fungal urea amidolyase proteins
are more closely related to one of the two groups of
bacterial urea carboxylase. Furthermore, one of these
bacteria (P. ananatis) has a unique urea amidolyase
gene, a product of amidase/urea carboxylase gene
fusion. The direction of the horizontal gene transfer
seems to be from a bacterial lineage to a fungal lineage,
since in bacteria other than P. ananatis, urea carboxylase and amidase exist as two independent genes
although they are located next to each other. Inspection
of introns in fungal urea amidolyase genes corroborates
this hypothesis further. Fungal urea amidolyases are
either single or double-exon genes (see Additional
file 2). All Saccharomycetes species except for Y. lipolytica have single-exon urea amidolyase genes. While in
the three Sordariomyetes species (M. oryzae, N. haematococca, and F. graminearum) the single intron was
inserted towards the end of the urea carboxylase
domain, in the duplicated Y. lipolytica genes the single
intron was inserted at the beginning of the amidase
domain. These observations indicate that the introns in
these fungal urea amidolyase genes must have been
acquired independently during their evolution as fungal
genes. Therefore, fusion of the two genes appears to
have happened in the ancestral bacterial species close to
P. ananatis, and this fused gene must have been transferred to a fungal lineage.
Since so far we found the urea amidolyase protein
only in one bacterial species, it is probable that the
fusion of urea carboxylase and amidase to form bacterial
urea amidolyase is a recent event specific to this bacterial lineage. If this is the case, the fusion event in P. ananatis could be also independent from those that
produced fungal urea amidolyases. However, we did not
find any unfused fungal urea carboxylase sequences
clustered with urea amidolyase in our phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 4), nor did we find any unfused fungal
amidase sequences clustered with urea amidolyase
(Figure 3). Therefore, if the fusion happened in fungal
lineage, it must have happened soon after the two bacterial genes (amidase and urea carboxylase) were
acquired by an ancestral fungal species. Regardless of
the timing of the fusion event, association between the
amidase and urea carboxylase sequences for the urea
amidolyase function and subsequent divergence of these
sequences from the other paralogous set must have
started in bacterial lineage.
Compared to urea amidolyase, urea carboxylase genes
in fungi have a wider range in the number of exons, 1-16
exons, implying again their independent evolution as well
as a greater number of accumulated changes. Note that
the single introns found in the urea carboxylase genes of

Strope et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/80

N. haematococca and F. oxysporum are both at the beginning of the genes and of similar lengths (55-56 bp; see
Additional file 2). It indicates that the common ancestor
of these species acquired a single intron in the urea carboxylase gene and it happened independently from the
intron acquisition in N. haematococca urea amidolyase.
Interestingly, the number of introns in urea carboxylase
and amidase genes in green algae is much higher than
the number of introns in the fungal orthologues. This is
in agreement with the observation that the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome has much higher percentage of
genes with introns and a much greater number of exons
per gene (88% and 7.4) as compared to S. cerevisiae (5%
and 1) and S. pombe (43% and 2) [27].
There have been studies presenting cases of bacteria-tofungi horizontal gene transfers. For example, Hall et al.
[11] found ten potential such cases in S. cerevisiae and one
in Ashbya gossypii. Fitzpatrick et al. [12] reported two
Candida parapsilosis genes as bacterial origin. GarciaVallvé et al. [13] showed that many glycosyl hydrolase
genes in the rumen fungus Orpinomyces joyonii were
acquired from bacteria. Schmitt and Lumbsch [14] showed
that the polyketide synthase in lichen-forming fungi were
results of ancient horizontal gene transfer from Actinobacteria. A recent study, the largest of its kind, by MarcetHouben and Gabaldón [15] detected 713 transferred genes
in 60 fungal genomes. Therefore, horizontal gene transfers
from bacteria to fungi do not appear to be rare events. We
identified yet another such example.
Proposed model for the urea carboxylase and urea
amidolyase evolution

Figure 5 illustrates our proposed model for the evolution of urea carboxylase and urea amidolyase genes in
fungi. As presented in Figure 5A, an ancestral urea carboxylase sequence in bacteria duplicated in the beta/
gammaproteobacteria lineage and evolved into two
genes (UC1 and UC2). Since in many bacterial genomes,
urea carboxylase and amidase genes are located adjacent
to each other (see Additional file 8), it is plausible that
before the duplication, the ancestral urea carboxylase
gene already had an associated function with the amidase gene. However, the creation of duplicated redundant copies of the urea carboxylase gene in beta/
gammaproteobacteria species appears to have reinforced
the association between the two genes and changed
their evolutionary pattern and rate in these bacteria.
This amidase-associated copy of bacterial urea carboxylase gene (UC1) was subsequently fused with the amidase gene to form a single urea amidolyase gene. The
fused gene was later transferred to an ancestral ascomycete lineage before the divergence of the Pezizomycotina
and Saccharomycotina. Alternatively, the gene fusion
could have happened in an ancestral fungal species soon

Page 12 of 15

after the region containing amidase and urea carboxylase genes was transferred from bacteria.
The other bacterial urea carboxylase gene (UC2) may
have also been acquired by fungi, green algae, as well as
Hydra. Since our phylogenetic analysis did not show
independent origins for these urea carboxylase genes, the
acquisition of this enzyme into fungi, green algae, and
Hydra must have happened around the time of divergence among these groups of organisms. It may have
been by a single event, likely before the divergence of
these organisms. Then we cannot eliminate the possibility that what we observed in the urea carboxylase genes
is the result of simple vertical evolution from bacteria to
eukaryotes. Either way, however, many eukaryotes
including the entire metazoa and land plants must have
lost these genes. As we mentioned before (and shown
also in Figure 5B), even within fungi, the urea carboxylase
gene is not retained in many species. Considering that
either scenario requires such a high number of loss
events, there would be other possible scenarios. One
group of organisms (either green algae, Hydra, or fungi)
may have acquired a urea carboxylase gene from bacteria
first. Later this gene may have been transferred to other
organisms. Although this scenario requires fewer loss
events, the main question is how such horizontal gene
transfers can happen between green algae, Hydra, and
fungi, or among any of their ancestral organisms.
In fungi, the introduction of the urea carboxylase gene
happened earlier than that of the urea amidolyase gene as
shown in Figure 5B. The urea carboxylase gene (red circle) was acquired in fungi before the divergence of the
phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The acquisition
could have been after the divergence of the phylum
Zygomycota or alternatively the gene was lost from the
Zygomycota lineage. Some Basidiomycota species subsequently lost the gene (the lost events are indicated with
grey symbols in Figure 5B). In the phylum Ascomycota,
this gene was again lost in the subphyla Taphrinomycotina (it includes S. pombe) and Saccharomycotina.
Further losses of this gene happened in some species of
the subphylum Pezizomycotina. The urea carboxylase
gene appears to become easily dispensable in many species, which may be related to the genomic and metabolic
environment of the organisms. The same seems to be the
case with MccA and PccA. The introduction of the urea
amidolyase gene (black square) in fungi took place before
the divergence of the subphyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina but probably after the divergence of the
subphylum Taphrinomycotina (at least after the phylum
Ascomycota diverged from the ancestral lineage). Within
the subphylum Pezizomycotina, the urea amidolyase gene
was lost in many groups but retained in almost all species
in the class Sordariomycetes (absent in the order Sordariales species). The urea amidolyase gene was retained in

Conclusions
We have presented a possible scenario of horizontal
gene transfer of the urea amidolyase and urea carboxylase genes from bacteria to fungi. Plastic and opportunistic genome evolution in bacteria and fungi and their
evolutionary interplay must have allowed the Saccharomycetes fungi to abandon the use of nickel-containing
urease. It contributed to optimizing these organisms
toward Ni2+ (and Co2+)-independent cellular metabolisms. Further detailed studies of a wider range of gene
families would reveal the importance of acquisition of
bacterial genes in fungal evolution.
Methods
Similarity searches

Similarity searches for protein sequences were performed using blastp (version 2.2.17 [28]). For urea amidolyase search, the S. cerevisiae sequence (P32528) was
used as a query. Search was performed using both the
full sequence as well as only the amidase domain of this
sequence. To search for urea carboxylase sequences,
A. nidulans sequence (P38095) was used as a query. To
search for other urea carboxylase domain containing
proteins, the S. cerevisiae Acc1 (Q00955) and Pyc
(P11154), A. nidulans MccA (Q6T5L7), and Aspergillus
related Neosartorya fischeri PccA (A1DF70) were used
as query sequences. The urease sequence from A. fumigatus (Q6A3P9) was used as a query sequence to search
for urease.
We performed these searches against 56 bacterial genomes, 64 fungal genomes, and 10 non-fungal eukaryotic
genomes (including 4 green algae, 2 land plants, 1
amoebozoa, and 3 animals). The species names, taxonomical groups, and the sources of the sequences are listed
in Additional files 1, 4, 5, and 7. The species were chosen such that all major bacterial, fungal, and other
eukaryotic groups were represented from a tree of life
[e.g., [29]]. For fungi, preliminary search for urea amidolyase, urea carboxylase, and amidase was done in 64
genomes and further analysis was done using 27
selected fungal genomes (noted with * in Additional file
3). The non-redundant (nr) database at National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was also searched
for urea amidolyase, urea carboxylase, and urease protein sequences using blastp.
All protein sequences were highly conserved, and
similar sequences were clearly identifiable in the results
obtained by blastp similarity search. The E-value threshold for each protein hit was as follows: 1 × 10 -49 for
amidase, 0 for urea amidolyase and urea carboxylase, 1
× 10-12 for urease, 1 × 10-111 for MccA, 1 × 10-115 for

Page 14 of 15

PccA, and 0 for Pyc and Acc1. The default parameters
were used with blastp program (version 2.2.17), which
include BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, low-complexity filtering, gap-open and gap-extend penalties of 11 and 1,
respectively. In order to obtain the E-values comparable
among different genome sizes, the “effective length of
database” was set to 500,000,000 (using -z option). This
also makes the E-values obtained from each genome
search equivalent to those obtained against NCBI nr
database.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Multiple alignments of protein sequences were generated
using MAFFT (version 6.240 [30]) with default parameters
(FFT-NS-2, a progressive FFT alignment with two treebuilding cycles). The maximum-likelihood phylogeny [31]
was reconstructed as implemented in raxmlHPC-MPI (version 7.0.4 [32]) using the following options: ‘-m PROTMIXWAG’ to use WAG amino-acid substitution model [33]
with a fixed number approximation followed by a refined
gamma-model of rate heterogeneity, ‘-f a’ for a rapid bootstrap analysis, ‘-x 1234’ to set the random seed, and ‘-# 1000’
for 1000 pseudoreplicates for bootstrap analysis. To gather
the bootstrap values, the ‘consense’ program of the Phylip
package (v. 3.68 [34]) was used. The minimumevolution phylogeny [35] was reconstructed as implemented
in MEGA4 [36] using the JTT amino-acid substitution
model [37] with 1000 pseudoreplicates for bootstrap
analysis.
