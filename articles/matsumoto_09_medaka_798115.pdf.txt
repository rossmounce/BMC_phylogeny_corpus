Abstract
Background: Within-species genome diversity has been best studied in humans. The international
HapMap project has revealed a tremendous amount of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
among humans, many of which show signals of positive selection during human evolution. In most
of the cases, however, functional differences between the alleles remain experimentally unverified
due to the inherent difficulty of human genetic studies. It would therefore be highly useful to have
a vertebrate model with the following characteristics: (1) high within-species genetic diversity, (2)
a variety of gene-manipulation protocols already developed, and (3) a completely sequenced
genome. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) and its congeneric species, tiny fresh-water teleosts distributed
broadly in East and Southeast Asia, meet these criteria.
Findings: Using Oryzias species from 27 local populations, we conducted a simple screening of
nonsynonymous SNPs for 11 genes with apparent orthology between medaka and humans. We
found medaka SNPs for which the same sites in human orthologs are known to be highly
differentiated among the HapMap populations. Importantly, some of these SNPs show signals of
positive selection.
Conclusion: These results indicate that medaka is a promising model system for comparative
population genomics exploring the functional and adaptive significance of allelic differentiations.

Background
The accumulation of human genetic polymorphism data
provided by sources such as the international HapMap
project [1,2] has revealed a number of SNP sites with
markedly different allele frequencies among human populations. Such data make systematic searches for diseasecausing or drug-responsive genomic regions possible
[3,4], and the accumulated SNP data can also provide
compelling evidence of positive selection during human
evolution [5,6]. An inevitable issue, however, is that
mutagenesis and/or crossing-over experiments to elucidate functional differences between alleles at these polymorphic sites are practically impossible in humans. A
vertebrate model animal with a broad geographic distribution and documented high genetic polymorphism
could serve as a "natural library" of genetic variation in
humans for orthologous genes that could be under similar
selective pressures.
The medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a notable candidate for
such a model animal. This small freshwater fish is found
in East Asia with closely related congeneric species
broadly distributed throughout Southeast Asia, and it has
a long history of use as an experimental animal since the
early 20th century. A number of inbred medaka strains
have been established, and transgenesis and mutagenesis
protocols have been developed, suggesting that medaka
has great potential for use in systematic genetic analyses
[7-10]. Medaka genome sequences are also available [11].
The greatest advantage of using medaka is its enormous
genetic diversity compared to the other fish models
(zebrafish, pufferfish, etc.), with the average nucleotide
difference of 3.4% between two inbred medaka strains
being the highest among any vertebrates thus far documented [11]. In this study, our purpose is to assess the
validity of medaka as a useful resource of comparative
population genomics.

Methods
Medaka strains
Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) populations consist of
four geographical populations. We selected 24 wild-type
strains from the Japanese medaka (see Additional file 1)
and three closely related congeneric species (O. curvinotus,
O. luzonensis and O. celebensis; see Additional file 2). We
also examined an inbred strain (Hd-rR) of Southern Japanese origin.
PCR-direct sequence, mRNA extraction and cDNA
sequence
We selected 11 genes for the screening of madaka SNPs
(Table 1). The flow chart of the target gene selection is
shown in Figure 1a. The PCR primers were designed on
the basis of the medaka genomic sequences [11] corresponding to those of humans where high-Fst SNPs are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/88

found (Fig. 1b). The PCR performed using genomic DNA
extracted from medaka fins or bodys as template. To isolate entire oRTTN sequences, mRNAs were prepared from
the embryos of seven strains, because we had already confirmed by in situ hybridization that oRTTN was expressed
in early developmental stages. oRTTN genes were PCR
amplified with primer pairs designed using the oRTTN
sequence predicted from the medaka genome project
(Hd-rR strain)[11]. The PCR products were directly
sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3130-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and a
total of ~340 kb of DNA sequences were obtained. The
primer sequences and the determined sequences have
been deposited in the international GenBank/DDBJ/
EMBL nucleotide sequence database [accession nos.
AB435679 – AB435956]. The thermocycling conditions
are available on request.
Statistical and phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW
[12]. The pairwise dN and dS values among strains of 11
genes were calculated by DnaSP Software (version 4.0)
according to the Nei-Gojobori method [13]. Insertions
and deletions (indels) were excluded from analysis. For
the entire nucleotide sequence of RTTN, the dN-dS and pvalues were calculated by MEGA 4 [14] according to the
Nei-Gojobori method with statistical significance tested
by Z-tests.
Protein structure prediction
The GeneSilico metaserver [15] was used to predict protein secondary structure and order/disorder, and to carry
out fold-recognition (i.e. match the query sequence with
structurally characterized templates). Potential phosphorylation sites were predicted using a semi-independent
component of the metaserver available at the URL http://
genesilico.pl/Phosphoserver/. For the THEA2 protein, the
metaserver indicated very high similarity (PCONS score
3.28) of residues 1–360 (human numbering) to known
Acyl-CoA hydrolase structures (e.g. 2gvh in the Protein
Data Bank) and high similarity of residues 360–607
(PCONS score 2.00) to lipid transfer proteins from the
STAR family (e.g. 1ln1 in the PDB). Long regions of intrinsic conformational disorder were predicted for loops connecting structural domains (around residues 160–200
and 340–370). For the RTTN protein, the metaserver identified the α-helical armadillo domain of β-catenin (1i7w
in Protein Data Bank) as the best modeling template, in
particular for residues 1–120, with a high confidence
score (PCONS score 1.67). Long regions of structural disorder, devoid of secondary and tertiary structure, were
predicted for residues 120–160 and 280–370. Threedimensional structural models of the ordered (i.e. stably
folded) parts of THEA2 and RTTN proteins were generated
and optimized using the FRankenstein's Monster method

(a) Flow chart of targeted gene selection, and (b) a schema of the SNP screening method. We first focused on 44
genes with allele frequencies highly differentiated among human populations, including the 27 genes listed in Table nine of the
first HapMap paper [1] based on high Fst values for nonsynonymous SNPs and the 17 genes listed in Table S4 of Sabeti et al.
(2006) in the category "population differentiation." A SNP site with a Fst value higher than the genome average represents
higher population differentiation at this site [26], possibly driven by natural selection [27-30]. Secondly, from the 44 genes, we
removed pseudogenes, genes with unclear annotation and genes without biological information in the database. Thirdly, we
chose genes for which only a single gene was assigned as an ortholog in the medaka genome by searching the Ensembl database
http://www.ensembl.org/index.html. After applying these selection criteria, 11 genes were subjected to the SNP screening
(Table 1).

[16]. The final models were evaluated as good quality by
the PROQ server [17]. The models were expected to
exhibit a root mean square deviation to the true structures
in the order of 2–4 Å, suggesting that they are sufficiently
reliable to make functional predictions at the level of individual amino acid residues. The atomic details of these
models, however, must be taken with a grain of salt.

Results and discussion
Of the 11 genes, we found that medaka THEA2 (BFIT2)
contained a nonsynonymous SNP at the exactly same site

where a high Fst is observed in humans (rs1702003 in
exon 6: see the HapMap database; Fig. 2). THEA2 is
known to be a temperature responsive gene, and it is
expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in response to
cold stress in mice [18]. The genotype frequencies at
rs1702003 are 98.3% G/G and 1.7% G/A in Europeans
and 100% A/A in East Asians and Africans. This could suggest that the European-specific allele of the cold-inducible
gene is an adaptation of Europeans to the cold environment around 40,000 years ago when early modern
humans expanded to Europe. Interestingly, only Philip-

pine medaka (Oryzias luzonensis), inhabiting a warmer
environment, has a different allele from the other Oryzias
species. While in situ hybridization showed THEA2 is
expressed ubiquitously in medaka embryos, RT-PCR indicated greater THEA2 expression in the brown tissue
homologous to mammalian BAT than in the other tissues
in adult medaka (data not shown). In the structural predictions for the THEA2, we found that the two SNPs indicated for the human and medaka proteins are located at
the junction between the Acyl-CoA hydrolase structural
domains in a loop predicted to be highly flexible. There, a
G-D (in humans) or L-P change (in medaka) is likely to
affect the dynamics of the protein chain and influence (1)
the interaction between domains and/or (2) the transmission of conformational changes. We speculate that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/88

amino acid change that affects protein flexibility may be
related to temperature adaptation.
For another gene, RTTN, we found even more remarkable
regional differentiation. The phylogenetic network adding
nine individuals from the northern Japanese population
and one southern Japanese population indicates the
nucleotide changes in the RTTN gene among geographical
populations; each population forms a separate cluster and
is separated by unique amino acid changes (Fig. 3).
According to bioinformatic predictions, the RTTN protein
is comprised of armadillo-like repeats separated in a few
places by disordered loops (Fig. 4). A78 is partially buried
and its substitution may destabilize the protein structure.
S92 is located on the surface and is predicted to be phosphorylated; hence, its substitution may affect structure

and/or function by removing a site of posttranslational
modification. N140, T143, and P158 are in the disordered
loop. Substituting P158 with A may increase the flexibility
of the main chain, the introduction of K140 and K143
may increase the entropy of the side chain, and substitution of T143 (predicted to be phosphorylated) may
remove a site of posttranslational modification. Thus,
substitutions of all these residues are predicted to influence the dynamics of the loop and thus its ability to bind
to other molecules or to respond to changes in the environment.
To gain further insight into whether natural selection is
involved in the observed nucleotide variations, we plotted
the average number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per number of nonsynonymous sites (dN) against

the average number of synonymous nucleotide differences per number of synonymous sites (dS) estimated for
the 11 genes among the 27 medaka strains (Fig. 5). Seven
of the 11 genes including THEA2 showed an average dN/dS
of less than 1, suggesting that the seven genes are under
purifying selection. In RTTN, in contrast, there are only
nonsynonymous differences in the genomic regions
examined (exons 3 and 4: 271 bp in total); in more than
half of the population pairs, the dN/dS ratios are significantly greater than 1 (Z-test; p < 0.05). The dN/dS ratios of
the LTC and the GRK4 genes are also greater than 1, but
these are not statistically significant at 5% level for any
pair. We have sequenced the entire RTTN cDNA for seven
individual medaka from five geographical populations.
Although there are synonymous variations in the other
exons, the dN/dS ratios are overall greater than 1, and in

nine of the 21 pairs they are statistically significant (p <
0.05; Table 2). These results suggest that RTTN is under
positive selection in medaka.
Although its exact function is not known, RTTN is
reported to be involved in determining the rotation of the
body axis and the left-right asymmetry of internal organs
during the embryonic development of mice [19]. The conspicuous differentiation of RTTN alleles among human
populations also suggests differential natural selection
acting on different populations: at a nonsynonymous SNP
site (rs3911730) in the RTTN exon 3, the A/A genotype
occurs in 90% of Africans, 2% of Europeans and is absent
in Asians, while the C/C genotype occurs in 3% of Africans, 80% of Europeans and 100% of Asians.
Previous studies have reported that genes identified in fish
through "forward genetic" analysis of phenotypic mutants
are involved in forming variations of related phenotypes
in humans, e.g. of skin pigmentation [20-24] and epithelial development [25]. Our approach in this study is an
extension of these previous studies, as a form of "reverse
genetics" of genes that show, as a signature of natural
selection acting on them, a prominent level of diversification in the allele frequency among populations with different ecological histories in both fish and humans. We
found that out of 11 genes in our analysis, the medaka
THEA2 gene has a nonsynonymous polymorphic site at
exactly the same position as its ortholog in humans, and
the RTTN gene shows signs of population differentiation
that can be explained plausibly by natural selection. The
aim of our analysis is not to demonstrate evidence of natural selection in medaka, but to indicate that medaka is a
marvelous resource as a "natural library" of genetic diversity, and this approach is efficient enough to find candidate genes targeted by natural selection in both humans
and medaka. The exact function of the genes and the exact
nature of the functional differences between alleles can be
studied more feasibly in medaka, where crossing experiments between different genotypes of interest and transgenic techniques have already been established [7,8]. This
method can be applied to any polymorphic gene in
humans, and larger-scale and more systematic screening
of orthologous gene polymorphisms in medaka will find
various target genes for further functional analyses. As the
medaka has been widely used for carcinogenesis and ecotoxicological studies [7], for example, in screening for
genetic variants concerning medaka carcinogenesis and
ecotoxins, it could also be used for testing variations in
drug response in humans. Thus, we conclude that the
medaka is a good vertebrate model of the functional
diversity caused by human DNA polymorphisms that
have been identified by recent resequencing and typing
efforts.
