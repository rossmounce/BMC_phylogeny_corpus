Abstract

Background

transferred genes (LTGs) as those whose features are atypical
for a particular genome. Thus genes displaying atypical composition or vocabulary are inferred to be alien, and to carry
features of their previous genome [4]. However, it is thought
that only recently acquired genes would be detected by this
approach because sequences quickly adjust to their new
genome pattern.

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R57

information

The G+C content of a genome and the codon usage of its genes
are determined by selection and mutation pressures [1].
Because these evolutionary processes are characteristic of
each species, the sequences belonging to a genome share a
common pattern of composition of bases, codons and oligonucleotides [2,3], making it possible to identify laterally

interactions

Conclusions: Although bacteria tend to acquire large amounts of DNA, the origin of these genes
remains obscure. We have shown that contrary to what is often supposed, their composition
cannot be explained by a previous genomic context. In contrast, these genes fit the description of
recently described genes in lambdoid phages, named 'morons'. Therefore, results from genome
content and compositional approaches to detect lateral transfers should not be cited as evidence
for genetic exchange between distantly related bacteria.

refereed research

Results: By examining the genome contents of closely related, fully sequenced bacteria, we
uncovered genes confined to a single genome and examined the sequence features of these
acquired genes. The analysis shows that few transfer events are overlooked by compositional
analyses. Most observed lateral gene transfers do not correspond to free exchange of regular genes
among bacterial genomes, but more probably represent the constituents of phages or other selfish
elements.

deposited research

Background: Laterally transferred genes have often been identified on the basis of compositional
features that distinguish them from ancestral genes in the genome. These genes are usually A+Trich, arguing either that there is a bias towards acquiring genes from donor organisms having low
G+C contents or that genes acquired from organisms of similar genomic base compositions go
undetected in these analyses.

Daubin et al.

Since the inception of these approaches, it has been noted
that alien genes tend to display lower G+C contents than their
new host genome [4-7]. Médigue et al. [5] analyzed the codon
usage of the genes of Escherichia coli using a multivariate
analysis and found that the genome can be separated into
three gene classes according to codon usage. The first class
corresponds to highly expressed genes, the second to weakly
expressed genes, and the third to genes with unknown function, insertion sequences (IS), phage, and genes possibly
related to virulence and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, this
last class has been interpreted as the class of genes recently
acquired by horizontal transfer.
The fact that recently acquired genes all group together in this
analysis implies that they are relatively homogeneous in their
codon usage. Although not pointed out by Médigue et al. [5],
this result is surprising, because these genes are thought to
have been acquired through several independent events from
different species, and therefore should display very different
codon-usage patterns and be separated by the analysis. Other
methods based on compositional analysis often show the
same result: that is, recently acquired genes tend to share
characteristics such as codon usage and G+C content [4,6].
It has thus been argued that the methods used to identify
LTGs are unable to detect genes acquired from donors having
similar base composition and that the amount of LTGs,
although representing a substantial fraction of the genome
following their predictions, is yet highly underestimated
[4,8]. Moreover, as noted by Lawrence and Ochman [4]:
"Since base composition (...) is conserved within and among
related lineages, genes with anomalous features are likely to
have been acquired recently from distantly related organisms", and genes displaying atypical composition are indeed
usually interpreted as such [4,9-12]. In this view, gene
exchanges would be very frequent, not only between species
but among orders or phyla. Indeed, base composition would
hardly allow identification of a gene acquired from Salmonella in the E. coli genome, despite the fact that these bacteria
may have diverged 100 million years ago. Such reasoning
relies upon the untested postulate that these genes carry the
mark of a previous host genome. It is well known, however,
that some elements or regions of bacterial and eukaryotic
genomes show systematic, and probably persistent, compositional differences to the rest of the genome. This has been
shown for transposable elements, viruses and plasmids
[13,14] and for the region of the replication terminus in
numerous bacteria [15]. Therefore, the observed peculiarities
of LTGs may represent, rather than a previous genome context, the mark of a particular 'lifestyle' or local effect acting on
the gene.
Here we address these problems by studying the codon usage
and base composition of recently acquired genes detected by
an approach based on complete genome comparisons. We
show that recently acquired genes tend to have a composition

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R57

that is shifted toward A+T compared to their hosts, even in
A+T-rich genomes. This suggests that LTGs detected by compositional methods are not highly underestimated. We moreover show that the hypothesis of an adaptation to a previous
genome context hardly explains the codon and base composition of these alien genes. Therefore, we propose that peculiar
evolutionary pressures acting on these genes are responsible
for their atypical composition. Hence, the large majority of
LTGs detected by compositional approaches do not necessarily originate in distant organisms.

Results
Transfers or losses?
We inferred the numbers of gene acquisitions and losses
using the method described in Figure 1 and in the Materials
and methods section. Figure 2 shows the number of lost and
acquired genes estimated, for each group of genomes considered. Because of the stringency of the BLAST criteria used,
these numbers are possibly underestimates. However, they
give information about the dynamics of the different
genomes. In all cases, the number of acquired genes is higher
than the number of genes losses in the branch of the sister
grouping. This allows interpretation of genes unique to a lineage as recent gains, rather than two independent losses. In
contrast, we cannot exclude the possibility that some inferred
gene losses correspond to independent gene acquisition
(although the probability of two independent acquisitions of
the same gene is difficult to estimate).

In most cases, the number of acquired genes is higher than
the number of 'lost genes' in the same branch. Two phenomena, not mutually exclusive, may explain these differences: an
increase in the size of the genome (this is probably the case for
the pathogenic E. coli strains, as their genomes contain many
more genes than the K12 strain); and a high turnover of
acquired genes in the genome. Indeed, the complete sequence
represents a 'snapshot' of the genome in which many of the
recently acquired genes may be destined to disappear quickly,
while the 'lost genes' detected by the method have been conserved during relatively long periods of time in the two other
lineages (Figure 3).

interactions

Most of the acquired genes have no known functions, though
a few are annotated as membrane proteins, phages or IS. In
the following results, the genes from these two last classes will
appear in the phages and IS classes rather that in the LTG
class.

We computed four independent factorial correspondence
analyses (FCA) on the genes of each type (native and transferred genes, IS, and phages) for the four species E. coli
O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica, and
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Figure 4 shows the projection of

Figure 3
Gene acquisitions and losses
Gene acquisitions and losses. The method described here (see Figure 1)
only identifies losses of genes (in genome A) that have been conserved in
the two other lineages considered (genomes B and C; in green). If recent
acquisitions (in black) are deleted shortly after their integration in the
genome, what we observe is a high number of acquisitions compared with
losses. This, rather than an increase in genome size, may explain the
results presented in Figure 2.

the genes and the codons on the two first axes for E. coli, Salmonella, S. pneumoniae and H. pylori. The codons have been
labeled according to their third position. In each case, native
genes and LTG form distinct groups (MANOVA test, p < 10-4).
In E. coli and Salmonella, the codon projections reveal that
the first axis was principally due to G+C content, the laterally
transferred genes being A+T-rich. This analysis shows that
the criterion used by Médigue et al. [5] probably allows identification of most of the recent LTG, as only a few LTG
detected independently from codon usage are in the native
genes cloud. These last genes may therefore display the codon
usage of a closely related species or strain. In Helicobacter,
the same pattern is observed but with a stronger opposition of
A-ending and C-ending codons. In Streptococcus, the A+T3/
C+G3 separation appeared principally on the second axis. In
each case, the ATA codon (isoleucine) is systematically separated from the others on the first axis, suggesting that in all
cases, this codon is over-represented in LTGs, compared to
native genes. Two other codons show a similar pattern: AGA
and - except in H. pylori - AGG, the two coding for arginine.
These three codons seem to be the principal ones leading to
the separation between native and transferred genes in these
analyses.

information

We carried out the same analysis on other species and found
similar results (data not shown). In Salmonella, the higher
slope of the correlation for LTGs (0.408; r2 = 0.593 compared
with 0.269; r2 = 0.288 for native genes) as well as the absence
of correlation for IS was also found, indicating that these
results are neither artifacts nor limited to E. coli. The same
tendencies are observed in Helicobacter and Streptococcus,
although not always significant as a result of the low number
of LTGs detected.

interactions

The center of each ellipse is indicated by a color point. The
arrows show the displacement observed relative to the position of the native gene ellipses. Transferred genes are systematically displaced in the direction of A+T-rich codons. The IS
ellipses display a similar shift toward A+T-rich codons. However, although LTGs from different species show a tendency
to group together, they tend to have codon usages comparable
to their host genomes.

Figure 7 shows the relative neutrality plot (RNP) for each
gene class in E. coli O157:H7. As expected for genes undergoing strong selection pressures, native genes show a low slope
in the regression plots (0.241; r2 = 0.212). The most recent
LTGs display the highest slope (0.568; r2 = 0.446), followed
by more ancient LTGs (0.451; r2 = 0.553), suggesting that the
base composition of nonsynonymous sites in LTG is mainly
the result of mutational pressures, and hence that their
amino-acid composition is exceptionally affected by the constraints acting on the nucleotide sequence. It is interesting to
note that in native genes, A+T-rich genes tend to show a
higher slope for the regression plot, suggesting that these
genes might be LTGs acquired before the divergence of the
considered genomes. Phages display a correlation slope close
to that of native genes (0.3; r2 = 0.392), indicating that they
are undergoing stronger selective pressure than LTGs. The
correlation for plasmid genes of E. coli available in GenBank
[17] shows a slope similar to that of phages (0.288; r2 =
0.301). Surprisingly, the IS showed no correlation (r2 =
0.001), indicating that G+C3 is independent of G+C1 and
G+C2 in the IS.

refereed research

Figure 5 shows the first two axes of an FCA performed on the
four species. All the figures can be superimposed, but they
have been separated according to gene classes (native genes,
transferred genes, and IS). Figure 5d shows the projection of
the codons on the same axes. Phages are not represented
because they are absent from the Helicobacter and Streptococcus genomes. For a given species, each class of genes is
represented by ellipses that enclose 90% of the points. A
MANOVA shows that all groups are significantly coherent
and different from each other (p < 10-4). This confirms that
LTGs in a species tend to use a relatively similar codon usage.
The separation on the first axis is mainly due to the base composition, that is, A+T-rich and G+C-rich codons (Figure 5d).

Selection on the different classes of genes
deposited research

Comparisons among species

We computed the base composition of each gene class for the
different species. The G+C content of LTGs is significantly
lower than the native genes (Mann-Whitney test, p < 10-4) at
each codon position, and particularly at the third (G+C3)
(Figure 6). This result is unexpected, especially for Streptococcus and Helicobacter, which have low G+C content (35%
and 41% G+C3 respectively). Thus, whatever the base
composition of a genome, the acquired genes are more A+Trich than their host genome. Moreover, when it was possible
to measure the amount of lost genes (that is, in enterobacteria), we have found that they also tend to be more A+T-rich
than the genome (Mann-Whitney test, p < 10-4; results not
shown), suggesting a greater turnover of A+T-rich genes.

reports

A few genes undetected as LTGs by our method, are, however,
localized in the cloud of points of the transferred genes. The
functions of these genes indicated that they could indeed be
transferred genes, acquired before the divergence of the
genomes considered. We found, for example, membrane proteins related to the virulence or secretory systems. In Streptococcus and Helicobacter, we found restriction enzymes and
transcription regulators. Interestingly, among these genes we
identified a gene coding a ribosomal protein (RPS14) in Helicobacter. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis this peculiar
gene has been shown to be subject to extensive lateral gene
transfer in the proteobacteria group, and could be involved in
antibiotic resistance [16].

The base composition of LTGs
reviews

Table 1 shows the relative frequencies of the codons of isoleucine (I) and arginine (R) for all the native and transferred
genes, IS, and phages for each species. In enterobacteria, the
native genes generally avoid the three codons ATA, AGA, and
AGG, while the transferred genes show little or no codon bias
for the corresponding amino acids. This is also true in Streptococcus, although the AGA codon seems to be rather overrepresented in LTGs. This codon is even more frequent in
Helicobacter LTGs.

Underlined numbers refer to the frequency in laterally transferred genes (LTG). Bold numbers refer to codons that are overexpressed in LTG.

Sueoka [18,19] has computed the RNP for a representative
sample of bacteria, all species together, and showed that
G+C12 and G+C3 are correlated among bacterial genomes
with a slope of 0.25. Hence, the slope for genes recently
acquired from indiscriminate bacterial species is expected to
be 0.25. We have confirmed this prediction by randomly
selecting bacterial genes in GenBank [17], release 130. From
the RNP, the slope of the correlation is always close to 0.3
(data not shown), even when filtering for A+T-rich
sequences. It thus appears that the correlation observed in
the LTGs detected by our method is incompatible with the
hypothesis that these genes display the compositional features of typical components from other bacterial genomes. In
particular, the amino-acid composition of LTG appears to be
anomalously determined by base composition, even in comparison to genes of organisms having extreme A+T bias.

Discussion
The A+T richness of the transferred genes
The tendency of LTGs to be A+T-rich has already been noted
by several authors in species having intermediate G+C contents [4,5,7]. However, these results were based on compositional analysis and have been interpreted as a limitation of
the methods. Our results clearly show that LTG tend to be
more A+T-rich than their new host genomes and that the
compositional methods do not overlook many of them. The
same phenomenon is observed for species having medium
(enterobacteria) and low (H. pylori and S. pneumoniae) G+C
content. This striking pattern raises questions about the
nature and the source of these LTGs. For example, Lawrence
and Ochman [4] hypothesized that the recently transferred
genes were adapted to the genomic context of other distant
species; however, our results would suggest either that the

donor genomes are always more A+T rich than the acceptor
genomes or that there is a bias toward the internalization of
A+T-rich exogenous DNA in the genome.
Foreign DNA may indeed encounter a physical barrier when
entering the cell if, for example, restriction enzymes tend to
have G+C-rich target sites. When analyzing the base content
of restriction enzyme target sites in REBASE [20] we have
found that, after removing redundancy, they indeed present a
G+C content higher than 70% on average (data not shown).
Since G+C-poor genomes have LTGs with lower G+C content
than G+C-rich genomes, this predicts a positive correlation
between the G+C content of a genome and of the target sites
of its restriction enzymes. Only a few species have sufficient
fully characterized restriction enzymes to test this hypothesis.
However, E. coli and H. pylori each contain about 200 fully
annotated restriction enzymes, and the average G+C content
of their target sites is 73% and 60% respectively. It is
therefore possible that restriction enzymes have a role in
determining the G+C content of LTGs. But this hypothesis is
not sufficient to explain the observed pattern of base composition across species.
The mechanism of gene transfer often implicates the intervention of IS and phages, which are known to be biased
towards A+T [13]. It is therefore possible that the use of such
vectors influences the base composition of the LTGs. However, both the FCA and the G+C content analyses suggest that
IS and phages are less biased in their base composition than
other LTGs.

The source of LTGs in bacteria
LTGs possess a composition that seems principally determined by mutation, as shown by the RNP. This bias is not

The comparisons with randomly selected genes in GenBank
using RNP shows that LTGs do not have the expected characteristics of genes adapted to previous genome contexts, even
if only A+T-rich sequences are able to enter the cell. Moreover, it is very unlikely that these characteristics emerged since
their insertion in their new genome. Indeed, while showing
differences in gene content, the two E. coli O157:H7 strains,
for instance, are virtually identical at the nucleotide level for
the remainder of their genomes. The LTGs could not have
undergone sufficient mutational pressure in such a short
period of time. They more likely represent genes that are
either adapted to or carry the marks of frequent lateral

transfers. Their A+T-richness tends to classify them with
phages and other mobile elements [13]. However, the RNP
suggests that LTGs undergo low selection pressure on the
protein sequence compared to these elements. Interestingly,
phages have been shown to carry ORFs named 'morons'
(because they add more DNA to the phage genome), which
often have unknown functions, but are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host when the prophage is integrated
in its genome [22]. These genes undergo high mutation and
nonhomologous recombination rates, and often display high
A+T-content, even in comparison to the phage itself [22,23].
Most LTGs fit this description and may therefore have been

introduced into the genome by phages. Moreover, this may
explain why most of these genes are orphans, as frequent
nonhomologous recombination may preclude the recognition
of homologs. The current knowledge of bacteriophage diversity is still extremely limited [24], and this lack may also
explain our failure to find homologs of these genes. Indeed,
the vast majority of bacteriophages being still unknown, they
might represent an enormous reservoir of such genes.
Some of the morons have been shown to be related to other
bacterial genes, suggesting that they may at first have been
host genes integrated in the phage genome [22]. These genes
may then have diverged rapidly because phages are known to
have evolutionary rates orders of magnitude higher than
those of bacteria [25]. Morons seem rarely to confer a direct
advantage on the phage, but rather stabilize the hostprophage interaction by slightly increasing host fitness [20].
Therefore, they may undergo weaker selection pressure than
genes directly involved in the phage life-cycle and be more
sensitive to the mutational bias inherent to parasitic
sequences [13]. From our results, it appears that whatever the
nature of the organism in which the gene was first recruited,
its compositional characteristics no longer represent its previous genome context. Although these genes seem to have a
high turnover in the genome, it is likely that, when proved
useful to the cell, they establish a long-lasting association
with their new host. Thus, while 'moron accretion' has been
proposed as a key mechanism of phage evolution [22], this
process may also contribute to some extent to the evolution of
bacterial genomes and to their adaptation to new habitats. In
this view, phages could be considered as a powerful way of
inventing new genes potentially beneficial to their hosts.
Thus, although bacterial genomes tend to acquire large
amounts of DNA, we have shown that those transferred genes
have very peculiar features that do not denote a previous
genomic context but connect them with parasitic sequences
such as phages. The genes involved in such lateral transfer
obviously do not belong to classes of genes that encode typical
cellular pathways. Hence, though the differences in content
between closely related genomes have been extensively cited
as evidence for constant exchanges with distant relatives,
these sequences carry no evidence for such exchanges. Therefore, attempts to use codon usage of an LTG as an indication
of their phylogenetic origin should be considered with
caution.

Materials and methods

All genome sequences and annotations were extracted from
the EMGLib database [26] using the Query retrieval system
[27].

Inferring recent acquisitions and losses by parsimony
The availability of sequenced bacterial genomes allows comparison of the gene content between closely related species,

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R57

and thus the finding of very recently acquired genes in the
genomes using parsimony analysis. Figure 1 describes the
ideal case of three closely related species, A, B, and C, for
which the genomes are sequenced and the phylogenetic relationships known. Three scenarios can explain the presence in
species A of a gene which is absent in species B and C: first,
the gene was present in the common ancestor of the species
A, B, and C, and has then been independently lost in species
B and C; second, the gene has been acquired by the common
ancestor of species A and B, and then lost in species B; and
third, the gene has been recently acquired by species A. The
last hypothesis is the most parsimonious explanation if one
considers that the acquisition of a gene is at least as probable
as a loss. A possible verification that this hypothesis is realistic is to estimate the number of apparent gene losses. Indeed,
the absence in species A of a gene present in species B and C
can be interpreted as the loss of the gene in species A or two
independent acquisitions in species B and C. Note that apparent gene losses in A may be overestimated if recombination
occur frequently between B and C (that is, acquisition of
genes by B and C is not independent), however the effect of
such a recombination event is probably low in the present
cases (see 'Genomes' section). These estimations of acquisition and losses can be made for species A and B.
We identified genes acquired by species A after the divergence of species A and B (case +A -B -C in Figure 1), by making a BLASTP [28] query of the protein sequences more than
50 amino acids long in genome A against those in B and C.
Proteins having no match with a bit score >10% of the bit
score of the query protein against itself were considered as
being recently acquired in species A.
We identified gene losses by species A after the divergence of
species A and B (case -A +B +C in Figure 1), by making a
BLASTP query of the protein sequences more than 50 amino
acids long in genome B against those in A and C (Figure 1). A
protein was considered as recently lost in species A if it had no
match in species A (same criterion as before) and at least one
match in species C (bit score higher than 50% of the bit score
of the protein against itself). To avoid problems due to possible gene misannotations, these results were verified using a
BLASTN query.

Genomes
To use the method described above, it is important to have at
least three complete sequenced genomes that are closely
related with unambiguous phylogenetic relationships. For
this purpose, we used five closely related genomes in the
enterobacteria group: E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 [11], E. coli
O157:H7 Sakaï [29], E. coli K12 [30], Salmonella enterica
[31], and S. typhimurium LT2 [10]; three closely related
genomes in the alpha-proteobacteria group: Helicobacter
pylori J99 [32], H. pylori 26695 [33], and Campylobacter
jejunii [34]; and three closely related genomes in the Streptococcus genus: S. pneumoniae R6 [35], S. pneumoniae TIGR4

[36], and S. pyogenes [12]. We considered as unambiguous
the relationships between these bacteria because, for example, the orthologous genes of the two strains of E. coli
O157:H7 are almost identical at the nucleotide level, while
they show noticeable differences from E. coli K12 (data not
shown). This suggests that, since their divergence, the two
strains of E. coli O157:H7 have undergone only a few recombination events with more distant strains. The same reasoning has been applied in the other cases. In the group of
enterobacteria, it was possible to classify transferred genes
relative to their date of acquisition in the three strains of E.
coli. Thus, we identified transferred genes acquired before the
separation of the two strains O157:H7 ('ancient transfers')
and those acquired in one of the two strains O157:H7 after
their separation ('recent transfers').

the transferred genes. The numbers of transferred genes in
the different strains of S. pneumoniae and H. pylori were
approximately 100, so the entire sets were used. Ten independent selections of genes were performed to guarantee the
reproducibility of the results.

bacteria as estimated by the method in Figure 1 is available as

To avoid statistical bias due to the differences in numbers of
sequences composing each category, we randomly selected
200 genes among the native genes and 200 among the transferred genes (when their number was greater than this value),
for the intraspecific species analysis. When the number of
phages and IS was greater than 50, we randomly selected 50
sequences in the phage and IS categories. For the same reason, in analysis gathering the four species, we randomly
selected 100 genes among the native genes and 100 among

To compute our FCA on gene codon composition, we used
absolute codon frequencies, without considering the three
stop codons or the ATG and TGG codons, which are not
degenerate. We thus obtained a matrix consisting of 59 columns (corresponding to the 59 degenerate codons) and as
many rows as sequences analyzed. Such a matrix can be used
in a FCA, which is a multivariate analysis often used to study
codon usage [2,5,14,37,38]. It allows one to calculate the
position of sequences in a multidimensional space with
respect to their codon usage and to give a graphical representation of the dimensions maximizing their dispersion. Genes
having similar codon usage are hence regrouped. The analysis, being symmetrical, makes it possible to represent the
codons in the same space as the one used to visualize the
genes, which allows identification of those responsible for the
clustering of the genes. We used ADE-4 software package [39]
to perform the FCA presented in this study.

The strength of the selection on a given gene relative to the
mutation pressure can be estimated by the method of the relative neutrality plot (RNP), which gives indications on how
'neutral' a coding sequence can be considered [18,19]. The
method consists of plotting the G+C content at the constrained (or nonsynonymous) positions (that is, first and second positions) of the codons against the G+C content at the
relaxed (or synonymous) position (that is, third position).
The slope of the resulting linear correlation gives evidence on
how the protein sequence is affected by the mutational bias
acting on the nucleotide sequence, and thus on how strongly
the selection pressure acting on the protein can counteract
this bias. Note that the effect measured is relative to the translational selection acting on the third position of codons and
that the strength of this pressure is supposed to be weak compared to the selection on the protein sequence. The slope is
expected to be equal to one if the protein sequences are under
no selective constraints, and to decrease with the strength of
the selection acting at the protein level. Translational selection is also expected to reduce the correlation, though to a
lower extent. For this study, we analyzed the correlations
according to different gene classes to determine whether
there were differences in the relative selection pressures in
each of the classes. All the correlations presented here are
highly significant (p < 0.0001) except when stated.

On the basis of sequence annotations, we have removed genes
related to IS and prophages from the different classes of genes
defined using the method described below. Genes from each
class, that is, native genes, potentially transferred genes
(LTG), IS and phages, of the four groups of bacterial genomes
(Escherichia, Salmonella, Helicobacter, and Streptococcus)
were then retained for codon-usage analysis when their
lengths were greater than 150 base-pairs (bp) to avoid artifacts linked to stochastic variations that might happen in
shorter genes.
