Molecular characterization of porcine circovirus 2
isolated from diseased pigs co-infected with
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus
Jianzhong Yi*, Chengqian Liu

Abstract
In this study, we isolated a porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) strain from piglets co-infected with porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The complete genome of this strain was sequenced, phylogenetic and
polymorphic analyses were carried out. BLAST searches revealed the highest sequence identity (99.5% nt and
99.3% aa) to Guangxi strain EF675230. The phylogenetic tree showed that clustering of the isolates didn’t strongly
correlate to geographical distribution. Polymorphic analyses demonstrated that the amino acids at most of the
polymorphic sites in Open Reading Frame 1(ORF1) and 2 (ORF2)belong to the same amino acid group according
to chemical or structural properties, and revealed that highly polymorphic regions overlapped with the known
immunoreactive epitopes of ORF2.
1 Introduction
Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS),
characterized by growth retardation, paleness of the skin,
dyspnea, and increased mortality rates [1,2], was first
described in Canada in 1991, and is now widespread
throughout swine production areas of the world [3,4].
The genome of PCV is a single-stranded circular DNA of
about 1.76 kb. ORF1 encodes the Rep proteins involved
in virus replication and is highly conserved among isolates [5]. ORF2 encodes a 234 amino acid (aa) Cap protein, which is the main structural protein and also the
major antigen inducing neutralizing immune responses
[6]. The ORF3 protein is involved in PCV2-induced
apoptosis by the caspase-8 and caspase-3 pathways [7].
However, healthy pigs experimentally inoculated with
PCV2 developed only mild clinical symptoms [8,9], suggesting that other concomitant factors may be needed for
the development of typical clinical PMWS [10,11].
Experimental studies on co-infection with PRRSV and
PCV2 resulted in the microscopic lesions associated with
PMWS and/or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy

syndrome (PDNS), and lead to the development of severe
disease [12].
In may 2008, severe disease, known as “high fever’’
occurred in several pig farms in shanghai, leading to a
57% death rate. PRRSV was detected in all the diseased
piglets, genome sequence blast showed the strain
belongs to genotype 2, 99.4% homologous to the PRRS
virus strain JXA1 isolated in China, which has been
proved to cause porcine high fever disease with high
morbidity and mortality[13]. There was no Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) detected in all the samples, but we
detected PCV2 from all the PRRS infected piglets (Figure 1). To investigate the genetic relationship of this
newly identified Shanghai PCV2 isolate with existing
viruses isolated from other parts of the world, we
sequenced the complete genome of the sh0901 strain
and carried out phylogenetic and polymorphic analyses.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Primer design and synthesis

Two pairs of primers were designed according to the published PCV2 genome sequence of strain AY691679, using
the Primer 5.0 software. The sequences of the primers

GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information, USA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version
4.0 and elaborated with both parsimony and distance
methods, supplying statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates.

3. Results
3.1 Genome sequence of the isolated strain

Figure 1 Dection of PCV2 and PRRSV in five diseased pigs.
Blood samples from five diseased pigs were collected, viruses DNA
and RNA were purified, respectively. After RT-PCR and PCR
amplification, the amplified products run 1% agrose gel.

PCR amplification showed the five diseased pigs coinfected with PCV2 and PRRSV (Figure 1). The genome
of the isolated viruses was 1767 nucleotide (nt) in
length. The genome sequence was assembled, aligned
using Seqman software (DNASTAR, Lasergene version
7), submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession
number, GU124593. The genome sequence was confirmed to be PCV2 by BLAST searches against the GenBank database.
3.2 Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ORF2

were as follows: upper primers, F1- 5′-AGAATTCAA
CCTTAACCTTTCT-3′ and F2- 5′-AATCCTTCCGAAGACGAGCGCA-3′; reverse primers, R1- 5′-AGAATTCT
GGCCCTGCTCC-3′ and R2- 5′-TGGGCTCCACTGC
TGTTATTC-3’. Primers were synthesized by the Shanghai
Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co.
Ltd. (Shanghai, PR China).
2.2 DNA extraction

Five homogenized Lung samples were collected from
deceased pigs, DNA was extracted using a DNA mini
kit (Tiangen Inc., PR China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.3 Whole genome amplification

The thermocycling conditions were: 3 min at 94°C, then
35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94°C, 35 s at 60°C and
2 min at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
The PCR products were subjected to 1% (w/v) agarose
gel electrophoresis, and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining under UV illumination. Five PCR products were
then subjected to DNA sequencing by the Shanghai
Generay Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, PR China) with the
same primers used for PCR.
2.4 Phylogenetic analysis of ORF2

Sequence comparisons were made by aligning the
sequence of the virus isolate with those of other isolates
using the algorithm CLUSTALW (version 1.8) method
in the program MEGALIGN (DNASTAR, Lasergene
version 7) at both the nucleotide (nt) and deduced aa
levels. To analyze the homology and evolutionary relatedness, prototype genes for PCV2 were obtained from

The ORF2 DNA sequence of the virus isolate shared
99.4% nt identity with the Guangxi isolate (accession
number EF675230) and 94.0% with the Jiangsu isolate
(accession number AY691679). The results indicated
that the ORF2 sequence was not distinct in different
geographical areas.
To determine the evolutionary relatedness of the new
isolate, the ORF2 gene sequence was aligned with
selected PCV2 isolates acquired from GenBank and performed phylogenetic analysis. The data showed that the
virus isolate was classified into group 1 cluster C with
the Guangxi strain (Figure 2).
3.3 Polymorphic analysis of ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3

Sequence alignment of the 46 geographically distinct
PCV2 isolates revealed four polymorphic aa sites within
ORF1 (Table 1). The aa at positions 35 are acidic residues, the aa at positions 77 and 105 belong to the group
of nonpolar aa, while the aa at position 121 belong to
the polar, uncharged group. Among the 22 polymorphic
sites in ORF2, there were two aa differences at 16 sites,
among which each pair of aa at the 12 sites belonged to
the same amino acids group according to their chemical
structure. There are six polymorphic sites in ORF3, the
amino acids at the polymorphic sites belong to different
aa groups, except the aa at position 100, indicated high
divergence in the chemical and structural properties of
the aa of ORF3 in different PCV2 strains.

4. Discussion
In the present study, the diseased piglets were infected
with PRRSV and PCV2 viruses, detected by PCR and RTPCR amplification, therefore, the levels of exposure to
the infectious agents were theoretically identical for all

animals. The severe lesions and clinical symptoms indicated that PRRSV could be a predisposing factor to the
high mortality, as previously suggested [14]. Several
hypothesis have been suggested to explain this epidemiological situation, PRRSV may interfere with PCV2 clearance, favor the persistence of the virus. However, the
nature of the interaction between PRRSV and PCV2 has
not been elucidated to date. The ORF2 protein has been
considered as a major immunogenic capsid protein, able
to stimulate a protective response in pigs. Five immunoreactive epitopes in ORF2 were identified by Mahe’ et al

using Pepscan analysis[15], these included residues 2543, 65-87, 113-147,157-183 and 193-207. Larochelle et al
(2002) also identified three major regions of aa heterogeneity among ORF2 sequences at residues 59-80, 121-136
and 180-191, and two of these regions corresponded to
two of the immunoreactive epitopes demonstrated by
Mahe’ et al [16]. In this study, we identified six highly
polymorphic regions, 26-50, 57-83, 90-120, 134-154, 169191 and 206-215, by polymorphic analysis, overlapped
with corresponded immunoreactive epitopes, thus
demonstrated that polymorphic analysis could be applied

to deduce the immunoreactive epitopes of viruses. Our
analysis show that ORF1 is highly conserved with only
four polymorphic sites, and the amino acids at each of the
sites belong to the same groups regarding chemical structure, which indicate that these mutations have no big
influence on the activity of the Rep protein. Polymorphic
sites were clustered in the capsid protein, and overlapped
with the immunoreactive epitopes, So ORF2 may play a
major role in the varied pathogenicity of PCV2 isolates.
