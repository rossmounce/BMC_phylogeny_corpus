Abstract
Background: Oncidium spp. produce commercially important orchid cut flowers. However, they are amenable to
intergeneric and inter-specific crossing making phylogenetic identification very difficult. Molecular markers derived
from the chloroplast genome can provide useful tools for phylogenetic resolution.
Results: The complete chloroplast genome of the economically important Oncidium variety Onc. Gower Ramsey
(Accession no. GQ324949) was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger based ABI sequencing.
The length of the Oncidium chloroplast genome is 146,484 bp. Genome structure, gene order and orientation are
similar to Phalaenopsis, but differ from typical Poaceae, other monocots for which there are several published
chloroplast (cp) genome. The Onc. Gower Ramsey chloroplast-encoded NADH dehydrogenase (ndh) genes, except
ndhE, lack apparent functions. Deletion and other types of mutations were also found in the ndh genes of 15 other
economically important Oncidiinae varieties, except ndhE in some species. The positions of some species in the
evolution and taxonomy of Oncidiinae are difficult to identify. To identify the relationships between the 15 Oncidiinae
hybrids, eight regions of the Onc. Gower Ramsey chloroplast genome were amplified by PCR for phylogenetic analysis.
A total of 7042 bp derived from the eight regions could identify the relationships at the species level, which were
supported by high bootstrap values. One particular 1846 bp region, derived from two PCR products (trnHGUG -psbA and
trnFGAA-ndhJ) was adequate for correct phylogenetic placement of 13 of the 15 varieties (with the exception of
Degarmoara Flying High and Odontoglossum Violetta von Holm). Thus the chloroplast genome provides a useful
molecular marker for species identifications.
Conclusion: In this report, we used Phalaenopsis. aphrodite as a prototype for primer design to complete the Onc.
Gower Ramsey genome sequence. Gene annotation showed that most of the ndh genes inOncidiinae, with the
exception of ndhE, are non-functional. This phenomenon was observed in all of the Oncidiinae species tested. The
genes and chloroplast DNA regions that would be the most useful for phylogenetic analysis were determined to be the
trnHGUG-psbA and the trnFGAA-ndhJ regions. We conclude that complete chloroplast genome information is useful for
plant phylogenetic and evolutionary studies in Oncidium with applications for breeding and variety identification.
Background
The Oncidiinae subtribe of the Orchidaceae family, consisting of about 70 closely related genera with over 1000
species, is divided into five alliances, with Oncidium as its
largest genus [1]. From the perspective of cellular biology,
ecology and morphology, Oncidium is the most diverse

genus in the Orchidaceae. Traditionally, the taxonomy of
the Oncidiinae tribe is based on the morphology of the
flower [2]; however, morphology is affected by environmental factors, and over time flower morphologies have
evolved convergently. The positions of some species in
the evolution and taxonomy of Oncidiinae are therefore
difficult to identify. Accurate identification is further
complicated by the ease with which Oncidiinae can be
crossed intergenerically, as indicated by the 107 interge-

neric hybrids reported [1] and the fact that more than
2200 hybrids (about 20% in the Oncidium group) have
been re-distributed into other genera.
Different molecular marker techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFL),
arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR),
DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF), and random
amplification polymorphism DNA (RAPD)] are available
to conduct genetic analyses by PCR and provide information about evolution that is useful for taxonomy. Tsai et
al. [3] used 257 RAPD markers to investigate the relationships between 24 species of Oncidiinae, and found that
the species could be separated into seven groups; however, Tsai and colleagues were unable to identify the more
detailed relationships among these species.
Although there are three different genomes in plants,
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is in many respects the
genome of choice for taxonomic studies in orchids [2] as
well as other species [4,5]. There are many advantages to
using cpDNA for taxonomy and evolutionary research:
(1) the size of cpDNA is small, with high copy number
and simple structure; (2) when compared to the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, cpDNA gene content and
arrangement are more conserved, making it easier to
design primers and clone genes; (3) cpDNA is maternally
inherited and thus without the genetic reassortment that
interferes with the molecular phylogenetic relationships
[4,5].
The chloroplast genome is a circular chromosome of
120~220 kb that consists of two inverted repeats (IRa and
IRb), a large single-copy region (LSC), and small singlecopy region (SSC). This conserved structure and
sequence information provides a resource for primer
design for other cpDNA sequencing by PCR [6]. This
approach has been used for the sequencing of two bamboo cpDNA genomes [7]. As chloroplast genome of one
member of the Orchidaceae family, Phalaenopsis aphrodite, has already been published [8], it is very useful to
sequence complete cpDNA from another orchid, such as
Oncidium using PCR.
The Chloroplast genome also has applications in plant
biotechnology. Chloroplast genetic engineering offers a
number of unique advantages, including high levels of
transgene expression, multi-gene engineering in a single
transformation event, transgene containment via maternal inheritance and a lack of gene silencing and position
effects [9,10]. However, the lack of complete chloroplast
genome sequences is still a major limitation to extending
this technology. Additional information about the chloroplast genome would, thus, be of great value in advancing
orchid biotechnology.
In this study, we designed primers based on the P. aphrodite cpDNA and used them to identify the cpDNA of
Onc. Gower Ramsey, an important cut flower orchid.

Such primers were also used to investigate the NADH
dehydrogenase (ndh) gene deletion patterns in 15 members of the Oncidiinae, and sequence amplified DNA
regions to undertake phylogenetic analyses broadly
across the angiosperms and at the species level.

Methods
Plant materials

Fifteen commercial Oncidiinae varieties were obtained
from a grower (Yung Hsin Orchid nursery) in Taichung,
Taiwan, including four Oncidium (Onc. Gower Ramsey,
Gower Ramsey 'Lemon heart', Gower Ramsey 'Sunkiss',
and Sweet Sugar 'Million Coins'), five Beallara (Bllra.
Eurostar, Peggy Ruth Carpenter 'Morning Joy', Marfitch
'Howard Dream', Tahoma Glacier 'Sugar Sweet' and Smile
Eri), two Odontoglossum (Odm. Margarete Holm and
Violetta von Holm), two Odontocidium (Odcdm. Golden
Gate, Odcdm. Wildcat 'Garfield'), one Degarmoara
(Dgmra. Flying High) and one Zelenkocidium (Zelenkocidium Little Angel). These orchids were maintained in
the greenhouse at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, and
vouchers specimens were deposited at the National Natural and Science Museum, Taichung, Taiwan. Leaves from
these orchids were used in this study. Details of the parents of these species are shown in Figure 1.
DNA purification, primer design and genomic PCR

The PCR strategy for sequencing the chloroplast genome
was adapted from Wu et al. [7]. For the chloroplast
genomic PCR analysis, total genomic DNA from greenhouse-grown plants was isolated using a urea extraction
buffer system [11]. The coding regions of the P. aphrodite
chloroplast genome were used as the templates for
primer design. A series of overlapping DNA fragments of
2 to 3 kb were amplified using specific primers (Additional file 1). The overlaps between adjacent PCR fragments were about 200 bp. The PCR amplification
program consisted of 30 cycles of at 94°C for 30 s, at 55°C
for 30 s and at 72°C for 90 s. The PCR products were
sequenced. DNA sequencing was carried out with the
Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit using an ABI
Prism 3,700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). All gaps were filled by designing new primers
on the basis of sequences obtained from PCR products
(Additional file 1). The sequences were verified by comparison with the chloroplast genome of P. aphrodite using
the VectorNTI AlignX software program (vers. 7.0; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; parameters: overlap: 30; identity:
0.95; cutoff score: 40).
Broad Phylogenetic analysis

Analyses of 48 species were performed using the same 61
conserved protein-coding genes analyzed in previous
studies [12-15]. This set of loci was assembled from the

aligned Nexus file for 45 species that is supplemental to
the paper by Hansen et al. [[14]; available from http://
chloroplast.cbio.psu.edu/organism.cgi]. Also included
were sequences from Lemna minor (GenBank accession
NC_010109), Joinvillea plicata (GeneBank accessions
FJ486219 - FJ486269, L01471, U21973, and AF001864),
and Hordeum vulgare (NC_008590) to increase sampling
among monocots and break up putative long branches.
Gaps introduced by the alignment were excluded from
phylogenetic analyses. Two phylogenetic methods were
used-- maximum likelihood (ML), implemented in
GARLI vers. 0.951-1 [16], and maximum parsimony
(MP), implemented in PAUP* vers. 4.0b10 [17]. ML analyses were run under the general time reversible model,
with all parameters estimated. A heuristic search of 100
random addition replicates was conducted for the MP
analyses. Nonparametric bootstrap analyses were also
performed with 100 (ML) or 1000 (MP) pseudoreplicates
[18]. Ginkgo biloba was the specified outgroup for all
analyses [14].
Contig assembly and annotation

VectorNTI Contig Express was used to assemble contigs
(parameters: overlap: 30; identity: 0.95; and cutoff score:
40). The chloroplast genome was annotated using

DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator) [19].
This program uses a FASTA-formatted input file of the
complete genomic sequences and identifies putative protein-coding genes by performing BLASTX searches
against a custom database of published chloroplast
genomes. Both tRNAs and rRNAs were identified by
BLASTN searches against the same database of chloroplast genomes. For genes with low sequence identity,
manual annotation was performed after identifying the
position of the start and stop codons, as well as the translated amino acid sequence, using the chloroplast/bacterial genetic code.
Analysis of variability in ndh genes of 15 Oncidium
varieties

To investigate the ndh genes of Oncidiinae, six cpDNA
regions (trnFGAA-ndhJ-ndhK-ndhC, trnRACG-trnNGUUndhF-rpl32, ccsA-ndhD, psaC-ndhE-ndhG, ndhG-ndhIndhA-ndhH and ndhB) were obtained by a PCR approach
from the 15 varieties as indicated in Methods (Accession
no.: GU175359-GU175415, Additional file 2). The primer
sequences, sequence size and sequence position in Onc.

are shown in Figure 2.

Phylogenetic analysis of 15 Oncidium varieties

To investigate the phylogenetic relationships between
Oncidiinae at the species level, eight cpDNA regions
[intergene region (trnHGUG-psbA, trnFGAA-ndhJ, ycf1-trnRACG) and coding regions (accD, matK, rbcL, rpoB, and
rpoC1)] were obtained by PCR from plastid DNA of the
leaves of the 15 varieties as above (Accession no.:
GQ915119-GQ915133; GU132947-132992; GU136249GU136275; GU175340-GU175358, Additional file 2). The
primer sequences, sequence size and sequence position
of these regions in Onc. Gower Ramsey are shown in Figure 2. Phylogenetics were conducted using MEGA4 (gap
opening penalty: 15; gap extension penalty: 6.66; DNA
weight matrix: IUB; transition weight: 0.5; negative
matrix: off; and delay divergent cutoff: 30%) [20]. The
evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum
parsimony, minimum evolution (ME), neighbor-joining
(NJ) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic
mean methods. In these four analyses, the bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000 replicates [18].
Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in <
50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The values of
replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown
next to the branches [18].

Results
Oncidium chloroplast genome sequencing

The size of the Onc. Gower Ramsey chloroplast genome
is 146,484 bp (Figure 3). The genome includes a pair of
IRs of 25,755 bp each, a SSC region of 12,650 bp, and a
LSC region of 82,324 bp. The Onc. Gower Ramsey chlo-

Page 4 of 12

roplast genome contains 101 different genes, of which 16
are duplicated in the IR, giving a total of 133 genes. There
are 29 distinct tRNAs, six of which are duplicated in the
IR. Sixteen genes contain one or two introns, with six of
the introns in tRNAs. Coding regions make up 49.94% of
the chloroplast genome (41.86% protein-coding genes,
8.08% RNA genes) and non-coding regions, which contain intergenic spacer (IGS) regions and introns, comprise 50.06%. The overall GC and AT content of the
chloroplast genome is 37.32% and 62.68%, respectively.
The gene order of Onc. Gower Ramsey cpDNA is similar
to that of the orchid P. aphrodite (Figure 3). The rps15
gene is not included in the IR. In contrast with the chloroplast genomes of Poaceae, Onc. Gower Ramsey contained introns in the clpP and rpoC1 loci and had intact
copies of the accD, and ycf2 genes, which are incomplete
or entirely missing in Poaceae.
The broad phylogenetic analysis resulted in two trees,
an ML tree with -lnL = 412281.26 (Figure 4) and an MP
tree of 75,521 steps and 14,974 parsimony informative
characters. The MP tree had a a consistency index
(excluding uninformative characters) of 0.3649 and a
retention index of 0.5997 (tree not shown). The topologies of the monocot subtrees were identical for the two
analyses in which Oncidium was maximally supported as
the sister of Phalaenopsis and the two orchids were
united with Yucca, another representative of Asparagales,
with maximum support.

ndhG-ndhI-ndhA-ndhH and ndhB) were obtained by
PCR from total DNA of the leaves of the 15 varieties.
Most of the ndh genes in the 15 Oncidiinae varieties, with
the exception of ndhE in some species, had no function
(Figure 5). In all 15 of the Oncidiinae varieties studied,
the ndhJ gene was truncated (partial sequence remained)
and the ndhK gene was absent (no sequence exists). In
ndhC, a frame shift occurred, creating a stop codon in the
middle of the gene in all Oncidiinae, including Onc.
Gower Ramsey, resulting from a 17 bp deletion (Figure
6A, Figure 5).
The ndhB of Oncidiinae does not function due to a stop
codon in the first exon. To date, six orchid ndhB genes,
including P. aphrodite, have been cloned and published in
the NCBI database. Two of them could translate putative
functional ndhB protein [Orchis rotundifolia (Accession
no.: AY147484) and Coelogyne crisata (Accession no.:
AY147475)]. There is also a frame shift in the second
exon of Cypripedium passerinum (Accession no.:
AY147479, AY147478.1). That of Odontoglossum crispum
(AY834278) is only a partial sequence that could translate
a putative ndhB protein.
The ndhF locus, which is located in the LSC-IRa junction, was absent in the Oncidiinae varieties. Notably, the
nucleotide deletions in the trnRACG-trnNGUU-ndhF-rpl32
region were different between P. aphrodite and Oncidiinae (Figure 6B, Figure 5).
All of the 12 Oncidiinae ndhD genes cloned here were
truncated. The overall pattern of truncation can be classified into two types: a truncation occurring at the 3'-end of

Oncidium1
GR2
ndhA
ndhB

ndhD (as in the Bllra. varieties) and a truncation in the 5'end (in the rest of the clones tested) (Figure 6C, Figure 5).
The sequences of Onc. Gower Ramsey varieties, Onc.
Sweet Sugar and Odm. Margarete Holm indicate that the
translation capacity of ndhE is retained in these species
(Figure 5). Of the species with modified ndhE genes,
Odm. Violetta. von Holm, Odcdm. Golden Gate and
Odcdm. Wildcat contained frame shifts; Dgmra. Flying
High had a 30 bp deletion; and there were deletions of
over 30 bp in the four Beallara varieties (Figure 6D, Figure 5).
Although nine varieties had no deletions in the ndhG
genes, these varieties had three internal stop codons
within ndhG, rendering ndhG inactive (Figure 5). There
was a deletion of about 250 bp in the ndhG gene of the
Beallara species (Figure 6D, Figure 5).
The region encompassing ndhI is the most complicated
of the chloroplast ndh gene regions. Generally, genes
from the same genus had the same pattern (for example,
see Oncidium and Beallara, Figure 6E, Figure 5). In the
Onc. Gower Ramsey varieties, the ndhI gene was partially
deleted, and in the Beallara varieties, Zelenkocidium Little Angel and Odm. Violetta. von Holm, the ndhI gene
was completely absent.
Truncated ndhA-ndhH genes still existed in most of the
Oncidiinae species in this study. With the exception of
frame shifts in Oncdm. Garfield ndhA and Oncdm.
Golden Gate ndhH, the other ndhA through ndhH genes
in the other five genera all showed deletions of various
types.

Phylogenetic analysis of 15 Oncidium species

Based on the amount of variation in the cpDNA and congruence with parent relationships, certain chloroplast
regions were determined to be more useful than others.
Because rbcL is highly conserved; bootstrap scores are
lower then 50% and are not useful for determining parent
relationship (Additional file 3). Using the accD gene, only
the species belonging to Beallara and Oncidium could be
separated as the pattern and relationships among other
species were not correlated with the parent relationship
(Additional file 4).
In the matK region, the phylogenetic analysis of these
sequences and 15 economic varieties gave results that
correlated with parent relationship (Figure 7A). Therefore, we combined the most diverse cpDNA regions, trnH
-psbA [21], matK and trnFGAA-ndhJ [22], for phylogenetic
analysis. The trnHGUG-psbA and ndhJ combination pro-

vided the most similar results to those obtained from all
eight cpDNA regions (Figure 7).

Discussion
Using PCR to sequencing Oncidium Gower Ramsey and
phylogenomic applications

Although there are many methods for cp genome
sequencing, PCR is one method that is easy and economical [7]. However, the gene content and order in monocot
cp genomes is relatively diverse so that the use of the P.
aphrodite as a template for primer design in this study
was limiting. This was especially true in the ndh gene
regions where the deletion of ndh genes in Oncidium is
very different from that in P. aphrodite. Furthermore,
when using PCR methods with total genomic DNA as the
template, some of the cp sequence regions are similar to
those in other organelles, thus raising the possibility of

false results. To prevent such results, we used BLAST
analysis and different combinations of primers to amplify
the same region.
Considerable effort is being expended to investigate
phylogenomic relationships among monocots using cp
genomes (see http://www.botany.wisc.edu/monatol/).
Here, the phylogenetic position of Orchidaceae among
Asparagales is confirmed with the robust support provided by many informative cpDNA characters. Further
sampling among orchids in the future phylogenomic
studies building on our results will clarify the complex
relationships within the large family. Therefore, the
cpDNA of Oncidium Gower Ramsey provides valuable
information for further orchid cp genome sequencing
and phylogenomics.
ndh genes in Oncidiinae cpDNA

In higher plant chloroplasts, the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex functions in PSI cyclic electron flow
and chlororespiration [23]. Eleven subunits of the chloroplast ndh genes (ndhA-ndhK) are encoded in the chloroplast genome. In addition 3 cyanobacterial orthologs,
nuclear-encoded subunits genes (NdhM-NdhO), have

also been identified in chloroplasts [24]. This indicates
that nucleus-encoded ndh genes originated in cyanobacteria and were transferred from the chloroplast genome
to the nuclear genome during evolution [25]. However, in
Onc. Gower Ramsey, out of all the 11 chloroplastencoded ndh genes, only ndhE theoretically translates
into a functional protein. This ndh gene truncation and
absence was also observed in P. aphrodite [8]. Using a
PCR approach to sequence the ndh genes of 15 varieties,
we demonstrated that truncation and absence of ndh
genes from the cp is a general phenomenon in Oncidiinae.
The loss-of-function of ndh genes or other chloroplastencoded genes occurs in many plants, such as parasitic
plants [26-30] and achlorophyllous orchids [31,32]. Lossof-function in ndh genes occurs not only in heterotrophic
plants, but also in autotrophic species. In Pinus thunbergii, all 11 ndh genes were putative loss-of-function alleles
[33], and in another Coniferales species, Keteleeria davidiana, was also found to contain nonfunctional ndh genes
[34]. In three Gnetophytes, which comprise three related
families of woody gymnosperms (Welwitschia mirabilis,
Ephedra equisetina, and Gnetum parvifolium), all 11 ndh

Wu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:68
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/68

genes are non-functional, 10 being absent and one, ndhB,
being a pseudogene [34,35]. It is interesting to note that
this ndh deletion does not occur in all gymnosperm species. The ndh genes exist in the chloroplast genomes of
Cryptomeria and Cycas [36,37]. It is possible that ancestral plastid ndh genes were transferred to the nucleus,
remaining functional to this day [8,33].
Loss-of-function ndh genes also occur in other orchids
[38]. Phaelenopsis aphrodite lacks the ndhA, ndhF, and
ndhH genes, and only remnants of the other eight subunits sequences were found [8]. The 11 ndh genes were
either truncated or frame-shifted, suggesting that they
are nonfunctional [8]. In this report, we demonstrated
that ndh gene deletion is also common in Oncidiinae: the
deletion pattern differs not only between Oncidium and
Phalaenopsis (Figure 6), but even within the 15 Oncidiinae species analyzed (Figure 5).
From a physiological view, since parasitic plants obtain
organic nutrients from the host, loss of functional ndh
genes from the chloroplast is not surprising. However,
this does not explain why most ndh genes are non-functional or deleted in autotrophic plants. The presence of
ndh homologs encoded within the nucleus was confirmed using PCR assays of total DNA of Phalaenopsis
[8]. The resulting sequences are in frame and imply that
the ancestral functional ndh copies of the plastid genome
may have been transferred to the nuclear genome [8].
Phylogenetic analysis of 15 Oncidium species

Because it is easy to perform interspecific or intergeneric
crosses with orchids, there are many artificial intergeneric hybrids. These hybrids are not distinct phenotypically and are partially named according to their parental
background. However, hybrids with different parental
backgrounds may be classified into the same genus. In
addition, Hybrids from differently named genera may
originate from the same female parent. Economic varieties of orchids are generally hybrids of other hybrids and
some of the parental information has been lost. To further complicate matters, changes in the names of genera
and taxonomy of the Oncidiinae are frequent. In 2004,
the names of more than 2200 hybrids comprising some
20% of the Oncidium group were changed. For example,
Colmanara Wildcat was changed to Odcdm. Wildcat and
Oncidium Little Angel was changed to Zelenkocidium
Little Angel. These changes and whether there were
grounds for them could be clarified by looking carefully
at the cpDNA, which could identify the female parent.
Among the eight sequences studied here, the phylogenetic analysis using matK was most well-correlated with
the parent relationship (Figure 7A). There are at least
three advantages of using the matK region for phylogenetic analysis: (1) this region is variable at the interspecies
level [22]; (2) this region is easy to amplify using pub-

Page 10 of 12

lished primer sequences [39]; and (3) a large amount of
sequence information about Oncidiinae matK is readily
available in the public domain, including the number of
sequences (695) and the length of the sequences (791 bp).
Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis by using 15
varieties and their 180 related sequences. Among the
results we found several areas of divergence between the
taxonomy of Oncidiinae based on morphology and our
phylogenetic analyses. For example, the female parent of
Beallara is Miltassia, making the grandparent Brassia.
The sequences of Beallara were highly correlated with
other Brassia species, and most closely with the female
parent Brassia verrucosa (Accession no.: EF079203, data
not shown). However, the phylogenetic analysis of these
sequences showed that the Odontoglossum matK was dispersed around the Oncidium group (data no shown).
Result such as these suggests that analysis of a single
region may not contain enough information for interspecies phylogenetic analysis.
To solve this problem, available sequence information
must be increased. During phylogenetic analysis, correlation is dependent on the length and properties of DNA or
amino acid information. Because the information on
orchid cpDNA is limited, the combination of several
sequences derived by PCR using universal primers could
be a successful strategy [see [22,31,32,40,41]]. In this
report, eight sequences from each species were combined
(total length of 7042 bp) and were well-correlated with
the parent relationship. However, to manage labor and
supply costs, we wanted to identify the smallest region
that would result in the same performance as using all
eight regions. Therefore, we combined divergent cpDNA
sequences such as matK for further analyses. In addition
to matK, the trnHGUG-psbA region is another divergent
cpDNA region useful for phylogenetic analysis [21,22].
Various expansions or contractions of inverted repeats
(IRs) in chloroplast genomes lead to diverse trnHGUGpsbA regions [42-44]. The structural changes in cpDNA
provide useful phylogenetic inferences [45]. According to
these data, the trnHGUG-psbA regions are informationrich and could be used for phylogenetic analysis.
In addition, ndh gene deletion is a unique feature that
may also provide useful information for parentage analysis. The trnFGAA-ndhJ-ndhK-ndhC region could be amplified by PCR in all of the 15 varieties. Therefore, different
combinations of these information-rich regions (matK,
trnHGUG-psbA and trnFGAA-ndhJ) were used for phylogenetic analysis. According to our results, two variable
cpDNA regions, trnHGUG-psbA and trnFGAA-ndhJ, could
provide sufficient information for genus-to-species level
phylogenetic analysis.
However, several questions require further investigation. The first is the placement of Odm. Violetta von
Holm, whose female parent is Odm. bictoniense. Irrespec-

Wu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:68
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/68

tive of the cpDNA template, Odm. Violetta von Holm did
not correlate with Odcdm. Golden Gate or Odm. Margarete Holm, which are both derived from the same female
parent. The second is the placement of Dgmra. Flying
High, which has the female parent Mtssa. Jet Setter. Theoretically, the cpDNA of Dgmra. Flying High should be
closely related to Beallara species, which are derived
from a Miltassia female parent; however our data indicated that Dgmra. Flying High is more similar to Odontoglossum.
There are many advantages to using cpDNA for phylogenetic and parentage analysis. But this genetic information is only derived from the female parent. Therefore, in
the future nuclear genes also need to be analyzed for parentage analysis [46]. In Pleione, the nrITS region was
found to be more variable than the plastid regions
sequenced, and nrITS gene trees were largely congruent
with those inferred from the plastid regions [46]. Our
data here suggest that the taxonomy of the Oncidiinae
may be improved by both chloroplast and nuclear
genome analysis.

Conclusion
In this report, we used P. aphrodite as a prototype to
design primers to complete the Onc. Gower Ramsey
genome sequence. The primers and the genome sequence
information obtained will be useful for further orchid
cpDNA sequencing and broad phylogenetic analyses
among monocots. Gene annotation showed that most of
the ndh genes in Oncidiinae are non-functional, with the
exception of ndhE, which could theoretically produce a
functional protein. In the previous reports, non-functionality of ndh genes has been found in photosynthetic
orchids and gymnosperms, such as in Pinus thunbergii
and Phalaenopsis. In this report, using a PCR approach,
we identified the ndh genes in different Oncidiinae
plants. The ndh genes were also non-functional in most
of the plants tested, except for ndhE in four Oncidium
species and Odm. Margarete Holm. These genes would
be useful for parentage analysis. The non-protein coding
regions trnHGUG-psbA and trnFGAA-ndhJ were also determined to be cpDNA regions that would be the most useful for phylogenetic analysis. When these regions were
checked in commercial varieties, most confirmed to previously known inheritance information; however, some
variations need further investigation. Also, to confirm
and complement the results obtained from cpDNA,
genetic information may also be derived from nuclear
DNA. We conclude that complete chloroplast genome
information is useful for plant phylogenetic and evolutionary studies in Oncidium breeding and variety identification.
