Abstract
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a physically devastating, genetically inherited disorder characterized
by abnormal brain function that results in the progressive loss of the ability to coordinate
movements. There are many types of SCAs as there are various gene mutations that can cause this
disease. SCA types 1–3, 6–10, 12, and 17 result from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DNAcoding sequence. Intriguingly, recent work has demonstrated that increased trinucleotde
expansions in the SCA7 gene result in defect in the function of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase
complex. The SCA7 gene encodes a subunit of the SAGA complex. This subunit is conserved in
yeast as the SGF73 gene. We demonstrate that Sgf73 is required to recruit the histone
deubiquitination module into both SAGA and the related SliK(SALSA) complex, and to maintain
levels of histone ubiquitination, which is necessary for regulation of transcription at a number of
genes.

Background
Misregulation of transcription is a hallmark of a number
of human diseases ranging from diverse classes of cancers
to neurodegenerative diseases. Within the organism, the
cell uses a number of cues to properly coordinate transcriptional events, including the recruitment of transcriptional coactivator complexes (reviewed in [1]). Many
transcriptional coactivator complexes possess intrinsic
enzymatic activities that allow for access to DNA for transcription. Chromatin remodeling complexes, such as
ATPases, are a type of transcriptional coactivator complex
that move nucleosomes, while histone acetyltransferases
and histone methyltransferases are examples of complexes that modify histones post-translationally. The
importance of these chromatin-modifying complexes is

demonstrated by the fact that they are often conserved
from yeast to humans (reviewed in [1-3]).
In yeast, one of the most well-characterized processes in
regulating chromatin structure is the post-translational
modification of histones. Originally identified over 40
years ago, histone acetylation has now become a model
for understanding the role of histone modifications in
modulating chromatin structure [4]. To this end, the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 and its associated complexes
have been shown to regulate the transcription of up to
10% of genes in yeast [5]. With the advent of highthroughput mass spectrometry, the array of proteins associated with Gcn5 continues to increase [2,6-10]. There are
currently at least four Gcn5 complexes: SAGA,

SLiK(SALSA), ADA and HAT-A2 [2]. SAGA, the best characterized of these, has 18 protein subunits with distinct
functions organized in a modular fashion [1,11,12]. In
addition to acetyltransferase activity, a second enzymatic
activity has been attributed to SAGA involving the regulation of histone H2B ubiquitination [8,9]. Specifically, the
SAGA subunit Ubp8, a deubiquitinating enzyme, has
been shown to deubiquitinate H2B, thus allowing for
properly regulated transcription at a number of genes.
Accentuating the crucial role of modularity within in the
SAGA complex, Ubp8 has been shown to require another
protein, Sgf11, for its activity [13]. Additionally, Ubp8
and Sgf11 together regulate a subset of genes, and so have
been revealed to function as a module in yeast [14]. More
recent work has demonstrated that another SAGA subunit, Sus1, is also important for maintaining proper H2B
ubiquitination, and that, in fact, it is these three proteins
that constitute the deubiquitination module of SAGA and
the related SLiK(SALSA) complex [15].
During our study of SAGA we asked how this deubiquitination module is held within the complex. As the initial
three-dimensional rendering of SAGA did not contain
these proteins, we looked at other components of SAGA.
We found that Sgf11 shared a conserved domain with the
Sgf73 protein of SAGA, which is implicated in neurodegeneration in higher eukaryotes [16]. Specifically, we discovered that both Sgf11 and Sgf73 contain a conserved
non-canonical zinc finger. This zinc finger is termed the
ataxin box as it is conserved in the known ataxin proteins
[16]. We therefore hypothesized that Sgf73 is related to
Sgf11 in function, and found that, indeed, loss of Sgf73
resulted in an increase in global histone ubiquitination.
During our studies on Sgf73, the Hurt group also reported
the role this Ataxin-7 orthologue has in maintaining
proper histone ubiquitination levels in yeast, as well as
playing a role in gene gating and mRNA export by recruiting other factors to SAGA [17].
Interestingly, the SGF73 gene has been shown to be the
Ataxin-7 homologue. Mutations in Ataxin-7 result in trinucleotide expansions and Spinocerebellur Ataxia-7 (SCA7)
[16,18]. SCA7 is one of the many types of spinocerebellar
ataxia (SCA), including SCA types 1–3, 6–10, 12, and 17,
caused by a genetic defect that results in a trinucleotide
repeat expansion in the DNA-coding sequence [19,20].
The fact that SGF73 links a histone-modifying complex to
a neurodegenerative disorder is intriguing as it was shown
that disease levels of trinucleotide expansions of SCA7
(36–306 CAG expansions) cause defects in the HAT activity of the SAGA complex in vitro [18,21,22]. As diseases of
the trinucleotide repeat variety, including Huntington's
disease and the SCA disorders, generally exhibit defects in
transcription, it is important to note that deletion of
SGF73 in yeast prevents formation of the transcription

pre-initiation complex at a number of genes, and inhibits
SAGA recruitment [23].
Here we demonstrate, similar to the Hurt group, that both
Sgf11 and Sgf73 are related to the ataxin proteins in
higher eukaryotes [17]. Focusing our study on the Gcn5containing HAT complexes we also looked at the effect of
losing Sgf73 on the SAGA-related complex, SliK(SALSA).
We found that the deletion of SGF73 from SliK(SALSA)
also liberates the deubiquitination module from the complex, rendering it non-functional; a similar loss is
observed by us and the Hurt group for the SAGA complex
[17]. We also observe that Gcn5 HAT activity in SAGA is
independent of both Sgf73 and deubiquitination activity.
We definitively show that the deubiquitination module of
Ubp8, Sgf11 and Sus1 is necessary, but not sufficient to
carry out or maintain proper levels of histone H2B ubiquitination in yeast. Additionally, we show that deletion of
SGF73 in combination with GCN5 results in similar
defects as the deletion of UBP8 and GCN5, confirming the
importance of the deubiquitination module as part of
SAGA for proper transcriptional regulation. Interestingly,
the Hurt group showed that in the presence of a fragment
of Sgf73 that can co-purify Ubp8, Sgf11 and SusS1, they
can observe activity using ubiquitin-AMC hydrolysis [17].
Therefore our data along with the published work from
the Hurt lab point to the crucial role that Sgf73 plays in
anchoring the deubiquitination module into both SAGA
and SliK(SALSA).

Materials and methods
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
The genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Individual TAP-tagged strains and deletions
strains were obtained from Open Biosystems with the
exception of strains deleted for SGF73 with K. lactis LEU2,
which were obtained by PCR-mediated knock out as previously described [24]. TAP-tagged strains with deletions
were obtained by crossing and dissecting the individual
TAP-tagged strain and deletion strain. Deletions and
epitope-tagged strains were tested by PCR amplification of
genomic DNA or by Western blot analysis.

Phenotypic analysis of the various yeast strains was carried out using serial dilutions of saturated cultures. Serial
dilutions were carried out by spotting 10 μl of ~ 1.85 × 107
cells/ml (OD600 = 1.0) and diluting four-fold for each spot
onto either YP + dextrose or YP + galactose plates. Plates
were imaged after two days of growth at 30°C.
Plasmid construction
The SGF73 promoters and coding sequences were amplified from yeast genomic DNA using primers containing a
5'SmaI site and a 3' SmaI site (primer sequences available
upon request). This PCR product was cloned in-frame

Subsequently, the resultant plasmid was mutated using
the Quickchange (Stratagene) mutagenesis system to create a SmaI site in the 5' end of the gene and eliminate the
SmaI site in the 5' end of the promoter to allow for movement of ORFs in and out of the resulting pBL525SGF73PRO vector. PCR products were initially cloned

previously described [25] with the following modifications: Elutions were carried out in a volume of 500 μl and
repeated five times for a total volume of 3 ml of purified
complexes, which was concentrated six-fold with Amicon
Ultra concentrators with a MW cutoff of 100 kilodaltons.

were carried out from cultures grown in media lacking
leucine to maintain selection for the various plasmids
used in this study. TAP-purified complexes were resolved
on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining.
Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology
(MudPIT) analysis
TCA-precipitated proteins were urea-denatured, reduced,
alkylated and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C
(Roche) followed by modified trypsin (Promega) as
described in [26]. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 100
μm fused silica microcapillary columns packed with 5 μm
C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), strong cation
exchange particles (Partisphere SCX, Whatman), and
reverse phase [27]. Loaded microcapillary columns were
placed in-line with a Quaternary 1100 series HPLC pump
(Agilent) and a LTQ or XP linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization
source (ThermoFinnigan). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides,
as described in [28]. Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were
interpreted using SEQUEST [29] against a database of
11,982 amino acid sequences, consisting of 5877 S. cerevisiae proteins (non-redundant entries from NCBI 200703-14 release), 177 usual contaminants (such as human
keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes), and, to estimate
false discovery rates (FDR), 5877 randomized sequences
for each non-redundant protein entry. Peptide/spectrum
matches were selected and compared using DTASelect/
CONTRAST [30] with the following criteria set: spectra/
peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn
of at least 0.08, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.5
for doubly-, and 3.5 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least seven
amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be
detected by at least two such peptides, or one peptide with
two independent spectra. Under these criteria, the FDR
ranges from 0 to 0.1606% (Additional file 1). To estimate
relative protein levels, normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAFs) were calculated for each non-redundant protein, as described in [31,32].
Isolation of ubiquitylated histones
The relative levels of ubiquitinated histone H2B (ubH2B)
in different strain backgrounds (YKH045, YKH046,
YKH047, YKL142 and YKL311) were determined by purifying histone H2B using an N-terminally Flag-tagged histone H2B and subsequently detecting the different forms
of H2B using an anti-Flag-HRP antibody (Sigma) as
described previously [33]. Purifications of ubH2B substrate for the deubiquitination assays described below
were also carried out as described above.

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/2/1/2

Deubiquitination assay
The Flag-tagged H2B substrate (containing ubH2B and
unmodified H2B) was obtained as described [33].
Between 250 and 500 ng of this substrate was incubated
at 30°C for 60 min in DUB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH
8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM PMSF, 1 μg/mL aprotinin and pepstatin A) with equal amounts of concentrated TAP-purified complexes. As a control, substrate was also incubated
in DUB buffer to which only calmodulin elution buffer
was added. The reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid
nitrogen, followed by boiling in one volume of 2× SDS
Sample Buffer for 5 min, and running on a 15% SDSPAGE gel. Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane
(Immobilon), and Western blot analysis was performed
using anti-Flag-HRP (to detect ubH2B and H2B) and antiHA-HRP (to detect ubiquitin) antibodies.
HAT assays
HAT assays were carried out as previously described [34].

Results
Yeast Ataxin-7 is required to anchor the histone
deubiquitination module into SAGA
Our previous work, along with the work of others, has
identified the core deubiquitination module with the
SAGA/SLiK(SALSA) complex to be composed of Ubp8,
Sgf11 and Sus1 [13-15]. We also demonstrated that Ubp8
needed to be part of SAGA in order to carry out deubiquitination of histone H2B. This led us to determine which
component of SAGA was required to anchor this module
into the SAGA complex. Phylogenetic and bioinformatic
studies revealed that the yeast Ataxin-7 gene SGF73 was
related to SGF11 in that they both contain conserved
Ataxin box zinc-fingers (Figure 1A). We also observed that
SGF11 and SGF73 are more closely related to each other
than to the other Ataxin orthologues (Figure 1B and see
discussion). This discovery led us to hypothesize that
Sgf73 may also function in regulating deubiquitination in
yeast. We first tested this by purifying Ubp8-associated
complexes in the absence of SGF73. Using TAP-tag purification followed by MudPit analysis we found that Ubp8
was only associated with the other core deubiquitination
module members, Sgf11 and Sus1, upon the deletion of
SGF73 (Figure 2A). This is the first time the entire deubiquitination module was isolated in vivo. In order to validate
our mass spectrometry results that Gcn5 was lost from this
complex we tested the purified mutant complexes for
acetyltransferase activity and found that this activity is
indeed lost in each of these purifications (data not
shown). This led us to revisit the question of whether this
module, now complete, could deubiquitinate on its own
in the absence of an association with SAGA. We found
that, similar to Ubp8 complexes purified in the absence of
Sgf11, Ubp8 complexes purified in the absence of SGF73
could not deubiquitinate H2B in vitro (Figure 2B) [13,14].

Evolutionary conservation of SGF73 and SGF11

semi-conserved residues in gray. B. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that in addition to SGF73, SGF11 is also a member of the
Ataxin-7 family of genes.

During the preparation of this manuscript, the Hurt group
demonstrated that Ubp8, Sgf11, Sus1 and an N-terminal
fragment of Sgf73 could hydrolyze ubiquitin in a fluorescence-based assay and therefore was the minimal set of
proteins required for deubiquitination activity [15].
Yeast Ataxin-7 is required to maintain proper histone
ubiquitination levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
In order to understand our initial findings about SGF73/
Ataxin7 using a Ubp8TAP tag strain, we decided to delete
SGF73 from a variety of yeast strains, which would allow
us to answer a number of additional questions. The strains
from which we deleted SGF73 were: SPT8TAP, which purifies only SAGA, HA-SPT7-1180TAP, which purifies only
Slik(SALSA), ADA2TAP and GCN5TAP to purify all Gcn5containing complexes. From these purifications we could
determine that in general the complexes remained intact.

In order to determine if specific subunits were lost we performed MudPit analysis (Figure 3A and Figure S1A). Our
MudPit analysis again revealed that the role of Sgf73/
Ataxin-7 was indeed to tether the deubiquitination module into both the SAGA and SLiK(SALSA) complexes (Figure 3B and Figure S1B).
We next tested whether these complexes could deubiquitinate H2B in vitro. None of the complexes purified in the
absence of SGF73 were able to deubiquitinate H2B in vitro
(Figure 4A). We also demonstrated for the first time that
the SLiK(SALSA) complex, purified using a truncation of
Spt7, deubiquitinates H2B and also requires SGF73 for
maintenance of deubiquitination activity [35] (Figure 3B
and Figure 4A). We then tested whether deletion of SGF73
affects the HAT activity of SAGA or SliK(SALSA), and
found that acetyltransferase activity is essentially unaf-

Analysis of Ubp8 purifications in the absence of SGF73. A. Mudpit analysis of various Ubp8Tap purifications reveals the
effect of the loss of SGF73 and SPT20 versus SGF11 on Ubp8-associated complexes. In the absence of SGF73, Ubp8 only copurifies with other deubiquitination module components, Sus1 and Sgf11. The numbers represent total peptides obtained for
each component. B. Ubp8-associated complexes purified in the absence of SGF73 and SPT20 lose the ability to deubiquitinate

validate the importance of SGF73 for the maintenance
and regulation of histone deubiquitination in yeast, we
next determined if the addition of a plasmid expressing
Sgf73 into the SGF73 deletion strains could restore the

deubiquitination module to the complexes and subsequently rescue the deubiquitination activity of the purified SAGA/SliK complexes. MudPit analysis of this
complex shows that the plasmid-expressed Sgf73-HA rescues incorporation of Sgf73 into SAGA/SLiK(SALSA) and

Deletion of SGF73 results in the loss of the deubiquitination module from the SAGA/SLiK(SALSA) complexes

also recovered Ubp8, Sgf11 and Sus1, suggesting that the
complex would again be functional for deubiquitination
(Additional file 2B). In order to confirm that this rescued
complex regained the ability to deubiquitinate H2B in
vitro, we tested it in our deubiquitination assay and found
that indeed, the rescued complex partially restored activity
compared with the complex purified in the presence of an
empty plasmid (Additional file 2C; compare lane 3 to 4
and D).
We next examined the effect on global histone ubiquitination of deleting SGF73. Deletion of SGF73 from a Flagtagged histone H2B strain causes an increase in H2B ubiquitination similar to deletion of UBP8 (Figure 5A; compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Previous reports using
chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that loss
of SGF73 caused local defects in pre-initiation complex
(PIC) assembly and acetylation [23]. In order to determine if the global defects in histone modification levels
caused by deletion of SGF73 were limited to histone ubiq-

uitination, we also checked whether histone H3 acetylation was affected by this deletion. We found that deletion
of SGF73 had no discernable affect on the global levels of
H3K9 acetylation (Figure 5B).
Previous work demonstrated that the combined loss of
acetylation and deubiquitination through the deletion of
GCN5 and UBP8 resulted in transcriptional defects in
yeast [8,13,14]. In particular, the ability to utilize galactose as a carbon source is compromised in yeast deleted
for GCN5 in combination with UBP8 or SGF11. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of SGF73 in combination with GCN5 would result in a similar defect. However,
yeast with the deletion of SGF73 in combination with
another component of the deubiquitination module
should be able to grow in the presence of galactose as the
sole carbon source. Figure 6 demonstrates that this is
indeed the case, as deletion of SGF73 in combination with
GCN5 shows a similar phenotype to yeast deleted for
UBP8 and GCN5, while deletion of SGF73 with UBP8

Discussion
In this study we identify a role for the yeast orthologue of
Ataxin-7, SGF73, in maintaining proper histone ubiquitination levels in yeast by the anchoring the histone deubiquitination module into the SAGA and SLiK(SALSA)
complex. Our initial hypothesis about the potential role
for SGF73 in deubiquitination came from the observation
that like SGF73 and other ataxin genes, SGF11 also contained a signature ataxin-box zinc finger motif. Since
Sgf11 had a role in maintaining the integrity of the deubiquitination module in SAGA, we reasoned that these
domains may help mediate the association. We and others observed that while Ataxin-7 in humans contains three
ataxin boxes, yeast SGF73 only contains two ataxin boxes,
with a third ataxin box residing in Sgf11 [16]. Therefore
the yeast SAGA complex contains three ataxin boxes,
while the human STAGA complex contains the three from
Ataxin-7 and two additional ones from the human Sgf11,
Ataxin 7L3.
Sgf73 was originally identified as a SAGA-factor of 73 kilodaltons via its association with Gcn5 [6]. We demonstrate
that Sgf73 is part of both the SAGA and SLiK(SALSA) com-

plex, but is not present in the other known Gcn5 complex,
ADA (data not shown). We show that deletion of SGF73
results in the loss of all three subunits of the deubiquitination module in SAGA, Ubp8, Sgf11 and Sus1. This
effect differs from the deletion of UBP8, SGF11 or SUS1,
which result only in pairwise loss of the other members of
the module [13-15]. In addition, overexpression of Sgf73
in our deletion strain partially rescues defects that were
observed in the SGF73 deletion; namely restoring incorporation of the deubiquitination module into SAGA and
thus partially restoring the ability of SAGA to deubiquitinate H2B in vitro (Figure S2). A possible reason why we
could not fully restore deubiquitination activity in our rescue experiment is that the rescued complex is purified
under selective conditions, which alters the amount of
SAGA and Slik(SALSA) in the cell (Lee and Workman,
unpublished). Our finding demonstrates that Sgf73 is
vital for the association of the deubiquitination module
in SAGA and SliK(SALSA). We also show that although we
can purify the deubiquitination module away from SAGA
and SliK(SALSA) by deleting SGF73 in a Ubp8-tagged
strain, this sub-complex is unable to deubiquitinate histone H2B in vitro, further verifying the previous finding
that Ubp8 requires association with SAGA in order to
carry out its function.

Although Sgf73 was previously shown to be important for
PIC formation and histone acetylation at a number of
genes, we observed that the global landscape of H3
acetylation is unaffected by deletion of SGF73. This further lends support to the idea that the acetylation and
deubiquitination modules of SAGA are separable in function.
In humans Ataxin-7 is part of the STAGA histone acetyltransferase complex. Previous reports have shown that
polyglutamate-expanded Ataxin-7 containing 92 repeats
results in a partial disruption and subsequent defect in
histone acetylation. This observation has been seen in
both human and yeast cells [18,21]. However, there is
controversy surrounding this finding as others have
reported that the polyglutamate-expanded Ataxin-7 does
not have this effect [22]. At the time, these studies did not
take into account histone deubiquitination, as the role of
Ataxin-7/Sgf73 in this process was not yet appreciated. It
will be interesting to revisit the effect that these trinucleotide expanded proteins have on SAGA deubiquitination
activity, as well as the ability of these proteins to re-establish the deubiquitination module within SAGA. If polyglutamate expansions do indeed affect these processes,
analysis of histone ubiquitination levels could be a diagnostic tool for looking at SCA7 disease states.
