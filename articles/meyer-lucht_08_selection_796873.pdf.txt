Abstract
Background: Research on the genetic architecture and diversity of the MHC has focused mainly
on eutherian mammals, birds and fish. So far, studies on model marsupials used in laboratory
investigations indicated very little or even no variation in MHC class II genes. However, natural
levels of diversity and selection are unknown in marsupials as studies on wild populations are
virtually absent. We used two endemic South American mouse opossums, Gracilinanus microtarsus
and Marmosops incanus, to investigate characteristic features of MHC selection. This study is the
first investigation of MHC selection in free-ranging Neotropical marsupials. In addition, the
evolutionary history of MHC lineages within the group of marsupials was examined.
Results: G. microtarsus showed extensive levels of MHC diversity within and among individuals as
47 MHC-DAB alleles and high levels of sequence divergence were detected at a minimum of four
loci. Positively selected codon sites were identified, of which most were congruent with human
antigen binding sites. The diversity in M. incanus was rather low with only eight observed alleles at
presumably two loci. However, these alleles also revealed high sequence divergence. Again, positive
selection was identified on specific codon sites, all congruent with human ABS and with positively
selected sites observed in G. microtarsus. In a phylogenetic comparison alleles of M. incanus
interspersed widely within alleles of G. microtarsus with four alleles being present in both species.
Conclusion: Our investigations revealed extensive MHC class II polymorphism in a natural
marsupial population, contrary to previous assumptions. Furthermore, our study confirms for the
first time in marsupials the presence of three characteristic features common at MHC loci of
eutherian mammals, birds and fish: large allelic sequence divergence, positive selection on specific
sites and trans-specific polymorphism.

Background
The vertebrate immune system possesses two very efficient
tools to ward off constantly evolving pathogens, the
innate and the adaptive immune system. As a part of the
adaptive immune system the molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognize antigens,
present them to T-lymphocytes and thereby initiate an
immune response [1]. The need to recognize a wide range
of pathogens drives an adaptive polymorphism in the
MHC, which indeed contains the most variable functional
genes in vertebrates [2,3]. Therefore, the MHC constitutes
a powerful model to study processes, causes and consequences of selection on a molecular level [3-5].
The MHC is a multigene family that codes for cell-surface
glycoproteins. These molecules are key receptors for the
presentation of peptide fragments deriving from pathogens. MHC class I molecules mainly correspond to intracellular pathogens and are expressed on the surface of all
nucleated somatic cells. MHC class II genes are predominantly involved in the defence against extracellular pathogens and are expressed only on specialized antigenpresenting cells, such as B cells and macrophages [6]. The
polymorphism at the MHC class I and II genes is especially pronounced in the codons that are directly involved
in antigen binding, the so-called antigen binding sites
(ABS) [7,8].
Research on the genetic architecture and diversity of the
MHC has focused mainly on eutherian mammals, birds
and fish. From this broad range of studies it has become
apparent that the extreme allelic diversity found at class I
and II loci is characteristic for the MHC [4]. This unusually
high level of polymorphism found at the MHC of most
vertebrate species is assumed to be maintained by means
of balancing selection. It is supposedly driven by pathogens through heterozygote advantage and/or frequencydependent selection [3,5,9-11] as well as mechanisms
linked to reproduction, such as disassortative mating or
pre-natal selection [12-14]. Balancing selection is
reflected in an increased rate of non-synonymous over
synonymous substitutions and an elevated rate of recombination events relative to neutral expectations as well as
in retaining certain alleles longer than expected under a
neutral model [7,8,15,16].
The latter phenomenon has been described as trans-species polymorphism [17], where certain MHC alleles or
allelic lineages are found in related species indicating that
they are older than the speciation event and passed on
from the ancestral to the descendant species. Long-lasting
trans-species polymorphism occurs only in genetic systems under balancing selection and is a typical mode of
evolution in the MHC [18].

In contrast to the great attention being paid to the MHC
of eutherian mammals, birds and fish, the diverse group
of marsupials has been poorly investigated so far. Earlier
studies on marsupial cellular immunology reported dramatic differences in the immune response between marsupials and eutherians and predicted little or no
polymorphism at the MHC class II genes [19-21]. Only
recently has the complete MHC region been mapped for
the first marsupial (Monodelphis domestica) [22,23]. Belov
et al. [24] presented in a phylogenetic review that the marsupial MHC class II β genes cluster in two groups clearly
separated from the eutherian β gene families, and therefore constitute non-orthologous loci. Recently, a third lineage has been reported [22]. The marsupial and eutherian
lineages appear to have maintained different MHC class II
β gene clusters after duplication events early in the mammalian evolution. The authors recommended using the
nomenclature DAB, DBB and DCB for the marsupial β
gene families [22,24].
At present, molecular research on the marsupial MHC
class II is restricted mainly to captive or laboratory bred
individuals. So far five marsupial species have had their
MHC class II β genes examined. Regarding the Australian
marsupials, Schneider and co-workers [25] investigated
one red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) from a zoo
and detected two DAB alleles, one of them a transcribed
pseudogene, and one DBB allele. A study on the MHC of
captive bred tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) using
RFLP suggested at least 12 MHC class II β loci in tammars,
but variation between individuals appeared to be significantly reduced compared with most eutherians [26]. In
Trichosurus vulpecula, the brushtail possum, five DAB alleles were discovered, again from a single individual [27].
Siddle et al. [28] isolated six MHC II DAB alleles from one
Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), and very recently a
study on wild 26 individual S. harrisii revealed no additional alleles [29]. In the sole South American marsupial
to have its MHC studied, M. domestica (gray short-tailed
opossum), only a single DAB sequence was identified
from five individuals [30], and two DBB and one DCB
sequences in a genome sequencing project [22].
Levels of natural diversity and processes of selection on
the marsupial MHC are largely unknown, as studies on
wildlife population of marsupials virtually do not exist
[but see [29]]. Yet, marsupials represent an important
milestone in the mammalian evolution. Based on genetic
data the separation of marsupials from eutherians took
place some 120 to 100 million years ago [31]. Tracing
back the evolution of the adaptive immune system in
mammals may allow fundamental insights to its origin
and function.

The marsupials of South and Central America are a widespread group comprising 76 recent species [31]. There are
species adapted for dry habitats or cool regions at high
altitudes of the Andes, but the majority of American marsupials are rainforest dwellers [31]. As representatives of
free-ranging marsupials under natural condition, we
chose two species of mouse opossums that belong to the
largest family of American marsupials, the Didelphidae:
Gracilinanus microtarsus (Brazilian gracile mouse opossum, Wagner 1842) and Marmosops incanus (Gray slender
mouse opossum, Lund 1840). These two species are
endemic to the highly threatened coastal Atlantic forest of
South America [32,33] and differ in their sensitivity to
habitat fragmentation [34,35], one of the major threats to
the coastal Atlantic forest. By studying these two species
we aimed to (1) investigate MHC selection processes for
the first time in free-ranging populations of marsupials,
and (2) test whether the predicted low levels of polymorphism at MHC class II in marsupials are to be confirmed
under natural conditions. Moreover, in a phylogenetic
comparison we explored (3) the evolutionary history
(trans-species evolution) of MHC lineages within marsupials comprising G. microtarsus, M. incanus and additional
marsupial taxa.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on natural levels of MHC diversity in non-model, free-ranging
Neotropical marsupials.

Results
MHC-DAB diversity in G. microtarsus and M. incanus
The MHC-DAB genes of 54 Brazilian gracile mouse opossums (G. microtarsus) and 56 Gray slender mouse opossums (M. incanus) were genotyped. Following the
suggestion of Klein et al. [36], the DAB alleles of G. microtarsus and M. incanus were denominated as Grmi-DAB and
Main-DAB, respectively. A BLAST search revealed >80%
identity of all identified Grmi-DAB and Main-DAB alleles
to MHC II β genes of the gray short-tailed opossum (M.
domestica), the tammar wallaby (M. eugenii), the brushtail
possum (T. vulpecula) or eutherian DRB sequences. The
alleles discovered in this study were published in GenBank under accession No's EU350142 – EU350149 and
EU350150 – EU350196.

G. microtarsus displayed a high degree of MHC-DAB diversity, both within and among individuals (Table 1, Fig. 1).
A total of 47 distinct Grmi-DAB alleles were discovered
through cloning and sequencing of fifteen recombinant
clones per individual (Fig. 1). The average number of alleles per individual was 4.6 ± 1.7, and ranged from one to
seven; thus we report a minimum of four DAB loci in G.
microtarsus. The alleles Grmi-DAB*04 and Grmi-DAB*17
contained stop codons, and one allele (Grmi-DAB*37)
carried a deletion of two nucleotides that lead to a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/39

frameshift. These three alleles were classified as pseudogenes and excluded from further analyses. In the remaining 44 nucleotide sequences, 93 out of 195 positions were
variable (Table 1). The alleles differed in one to 46 nucleotide positions, with an average of 28.2 ± 2.6. On the
amino acid level 44 out of 65 positions were polymorphic. Two nucleotide sequences translated to the same
amino acid sequence (Grmi-DAB*01a and GrmiDAB*01b). Except for these two, alleles differed in one to
26 positions, with an average of 15.9 ± 2.1. The most common allele Grmi-DAB*01a was detected in all but three
individuals (frequency= 0.944), followed by GrmiDAB*02 and Grmi-DAB*09 (both 0.278). The remaining
Grmi-DAB alleles occurred in one to twelve individuals
(Fig. 1).
Unlike G. microtarsus, the number of different DAB alleles
found in M. incanus was low (Table 1). A total of eight
Main-DAB alleles were assigned via SSCP and cloning
from 56 individuals (Fig. 1). The number of alleles within
an individual was on average 3.0 ± 0.6, with a range from
two to four alleles. Hence in M. incanus the DAB locus is
at least duplicated. Nucleotide divergence between the
Main-DAB alleles was high. In eight Main-DAB alleles, 66
from 195 nucleotide positions were variable and no
indels were detected. Alleles differed amongst themselves
by two to 45 nucleotide positions and in 25.6 ± 2.7 on
average. Each nucleotide sequence translated to a unique
amino acid sequence. 30 out of 65 amino acid positions
were polymorphic. Alleles varied in one to 24 positions,
averaging in 14.1 ± 2.2 substituted amino acids. The most
common allele Main-DAB*01 was present in a frequency
of 0.875, followed by Main-DAB*02 (0.750) and MainDAB*03/4 (0.732). The remaining alleles occurred in ≤ 12
individuals (Fig. 1).
Test for positive selection
The marsupial MHC-DAB was suggested to be not orthologous to the eutherian DRB [24], therefore we did not
assume an a priori concordance with the antigen binding
sites from the human HLA class II molecule DR1 [37,38].
Accordingly, the dN/dS ratio, which is commonly applied
to test for balancing selection [7,8], was calculated for the
whole sequence and not separately for the ABS and nonABS. There was no excess of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions for the whole sequence in both species (Table 2). However, in alignment with the human
DR1 molecule, 17 (89%) positions in G. microtarsus and
15 (79%) positions in M. incanus out of the 19 predicted
ABS revealed variation (Fig. 1).

Positive selection on specific codon sites was detected
using the maximum likelihood method CODEML implemented in PAML3.15 [39]. Two pairs of models were
applied: M1a versus M2a, and M7 versus M8. The pair

M1a – M2a has limitations in the presence of recombination, while M7 – M8 is robust against the effects of recombination [[40], but see [41]]. The models M2a and M8
that allow for positive selection fitted our data significantly better than the null hypothesis models M1a and
M7 (Table 2). In G. microtarsus, both models M2a and M8
identified nine sites under positive selection, which were
detected by Bayesian analysis (Table 2). Six of these are
congruent with ABS from the human DR1 molecule [37],
two are located directly next to an ABS, and another one
at a distance of two amino acids from an ABS. For M. incanus only three positions were found to be under positive
selection (Table 2). One position was detected by both
models M2a and M8, and the two other positions were
each detected by only one of the models. All three sites are
congruent with human ABS.
Test for gene conversion and recombination
Within the 44 MHC-DAB alleles of G. microtarsus the
GENECONV analyses [42] detected no fragment significantly involved in gene conversion events in a global comparison (based on the whole alignment), but two
fragments in the eight alleles of M. incanus. In pairwise
tests, 98 fragments in G. microtarsus and two additional
fragments in M. incanus were discovered but did not withstand corrections for multiple comparisons. However, in
both species the numbers of pairwise internal fragments

exceeded the random-assumption of 5% (G. microtarsus:
98 out of 946 (= 10.3%); M. incanus: four out of 28 comparisons (= 14.3%)) suggesting the occurrence of gene
conversion in both taxa.
Population recombination was estimated using the software LDhat [43]. For G. microtarsus, the population
recombination rate was high (ρ = 26) and deviated significantly from the null hypothesis (ρ = 0) in the likelihood
permutation test. Here, the presence of recombination
was confirmed while in M. incanus population recombination rate was quite low (ρ = 3) and, hence, the null
hypothesis was not rejected.
The Hudson four-gamete test [44] implemented in DnaSP
[45] revealed 21 and nine recombination events (RM) in
G. microtarsus and M. incanus, respectively. These values
indicate the minimum number of recombination events
in the history of the samples.
Evolutionary pattern of the MHC-DAB lineages
To characterise the phylogenetic relationship of the marsupial DAB alleles found in this study a neighbour joining
tree was constructed. It included the marsupial DAB, DBB
and DCB loci, the prototherian DZB [46], representatives
from the eutherian β gene families DOB, DPB, DQB and
DRB as well as bird, reptile and anuran MHC sequences

The rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions were calculated for the entire sequence. In the analyses of positively selected
sites, twice the difference in likelihood 2(Lb-La) between the models was compared with a τ2-distribution (df = 2) to assess significance [100]. x
represents sites under positive selection identified at the >95% confidence level. Sites in bold are antigen binding sites (ABS) according to the
human DR1 molecule [37], distance (dist.) to human ABS corresponds to the amino acid distance between identified site and the nearest human
ABS.

(Fig. 2). All MHC II β alleles discovered in this study clustered with published DAB sequences from other marsupial species (Fig. 2). The eight alleles of M. incanus did not
form a monophyletic clade but were widely interspersed
within the groups of Grmi-DAB alleles. Moreover, four
Main-DAB alleles were found to be identical to alleles of
G. microtarsus, at least for the 195 investigated base pairs.
The identical allele pairs were: Main-DAB*02 and GrmiDAB*29, Main-DAB*04 and Grmi-DAB*26, MainDAB*07 and Grmi-DAB*01a, and Main-DAB*08 and
Grmi-DAB*10. The Neotropical marsupials formed a sister group to the Australian marsupials, but without bootstrap support (Fig. 2). The entire DAB lineage was held
together with a bootstrap support of 65, and separated
from the other two known marsupial lineages DBB and
DCB as well as from the eutherian and prototherian MHC
II β gene lineages. However, the topology of β gene lineages was not supported by high bootstrap values.

Discussion
Dramatic differences in the immune response between
marsupials and eutherian mammals have been reported
from earlier studies on marsupial immunology. For
instance, M. domestica shows virtually no mixed lymphocyte response, which is a measure of T-cell function
and highly dependent on MHC class II polymorphism
[19-21]. The authors inferred that T-cell receptors are atypical and there is little or no polymorphism at the MHC
class II genes in this species. A recent study by Siddle et al.
[29] revealed a severely depleted MHC class I diversity in
wild Tasmanian devils. The depleted MHC is probably
accounting for the easy spread of the devil facial tumour
disease, a contagious tumour that puts Tasmanian devils
currently under the threat of extinction. In the present
study, we investigated characteristic features of the MHC
in free-ranging populations of Neotropical marsupials
and tested whether the low levels of polymorphism at
MHC class II in marsupials can be confirmed under natural selection conditions as inferred by earlier studies.
Three different mechanisms for generating and maintaining MHC diversity were studied: positive selection, recombination and trans-species polymorphism.
In both study species (Marmosops incanus, Gracilinanus
microtarsus) patterns of positive selection acting on the
DAB loci were found by maximum likelihood analyses.
Power and accuracy of the maximum likelihood method
for detecting positive selection has been evaluated as
strong by Wong and co-workers [47]. In these analyses ω
was estimated not for the entire sequence, but separately
for each codon site resulting in several significantly positively selected sites being detected [39]. There were nine
positively selected sites in G. microtarsus; the human DR
molecule contains 19 ABS in the corresponding segment
[37]. Two ABS positions (65 and 68) out of those 19

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/39

human ABS were completely invariable in G. microtarsus
suggesting that they are not functionally involved in antigen binding. In M. incanus only three positively selected
sites were detected with two different models. We assume
that only three positively selected sites were detected due
to the low sample size of eight Main-DAB alleles. However, all of these three sites were congruent with human
ABS and with positively selected sites in G. microtarsus
emphasising structural similarities of sites probably
involved in antigen binding throughout evolutionary lineages. This approach has recently been applied in MHC
studies on wild populations of chamois [48,49], African
mole-rats [50], voles [51], primates [52] and several salmonid species [53] to identify species-specific positively
selected sites. All studies revealed high congruence of positively selected sites with the human ABS.
Intralocus recombination plays an important role in the
generation of the large allelic polymorphism at the MHC
[15,54,55]. Supporting results from free-ranging populations were provided by a number of studies
[48,52,53,56,57]. In our study, we also found evidence for
gene conversion and recombination in the history of the
MHC-DAB alleles of the two marsupials although the tests
we applied detected uneven numbers of events and probabilities. The program GENECONV was evaluated as having one of the highest probabilities of correctly inferring
gene conversion events [58]. However, under extensive
recombination the power of GENECONV might be
reduced [51]. Richman et al. [15] showed that LDhat
yields reliable estimates for the population recombination rate even when the amounts of both recombination
and mutation are large, as is the case under balancing
selection. The minimum number of recombination events
calculated by DnaSP [45] showed a similar tendency as
LDhat. The ambiguity in our results might be based on the
presence of multiple loci in our data. We cannot discriminate between intra- and interlocus recombination as both
mechanisms might interfere with each other in our dataset but it is assumed that interlocus recombination plays
a minor role in MHC evolution of mammals [54].
Another indicator of balancing selection acting in a
genetic system is trans-species polymorphism [18]. This
non-neutral retention of alleles and lineages, across even
multiple speciation events, is a typical feature of MHC
evolution [3,17,18]. Patterns of this mode of evolution
were described in a wide range of taxa including rodents
[59-61], salmonids [53,62], ungulates [48,63], carnivores
[64,65] and primates [66]. In our study we found MHCDAB lineages shared between both species. But as we have
shown that recombination is likely to have played a significant role in generating DAB diversity, conclusions about
potential trans-species polymorphism should be treated
cautiously. Recombination may have strong effects on

Page 7 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:39

phylogenetic inferences. For instance, it will cause allelic
lineages appearing to have diverged over a longer time
period than they actually did whereas the polymorphism
as a whole is younger. This effect makes trans-species polymorphism more apparent [67]. Not only did we find
shared lineages of MHC-DAB but also pairs of identical
alleles, which constitute a more conclusive evidence of
trans-species polymorphism. Trans-species sharing of
MHC class II alleles between species of the same genus
was documented in some studies on primates [68,69] but
this phenomenon is rarely observed across genera. One
striking example is the extensive MHC-DRB allele sharing
between families of Malagasy lemurs [70].
In this study we are faced with multiple MHC-DAB loci, at
least two in M. incanus and a minimum of four in G.
microtarsus. A common problem in MHC-studies are difficulties in assigning alleles to their respective locus [51,7173], which limits the significance of analyses on selection
patterns. Different loci may be subjected to different selection pressures and processes and in a strict sense they cannot be combined in calculations on positively selected
sites, trans-species polymorphism and sequence diversity.
However, interlocus allelic exchange is known to occur at
MHC loci [71], emphasizing its functional coherence.
Also gene duplication is an important mechanism to generate polymorphism at the MHC, which is known, for
instance, from rhesus macaques or Californian sea lions
[74,75]. Despite this lack of knowledge, our study describing features of marsupial MHC diversity from natural
populations is worthwhile even without locus assignment
because it revealed results contradicting previous claims
of low MHC class II variability in marsupials.
Our data on 54 free-ranging G. microtarsus disprove the
previous assumption of very limited polymorphism at the
MHC class II. G. microtarsus shows extensive polymorphism in the number of alleles within an individual and
within the total sample as well as in the genetic distance
among alleles. This level of variation is typical for classical
MHC loci in studies on natural populations of numerous
eutherian mammals. The evaluation of large genetic distance among the alleles should, however, be treated with
caution, because we cannot discriminate between intraand interlocus distances. At the current state of this work,
tissue samples providing sufficient amounts of RNA are
not available and thus we have no information on expression patterns of MHC class II in the investigated species.
In G. microtarsus one to seven alleles per individual were
detected via cloning and sequencing. In preparation for
this study, extensive sequencing revealed that 15
sequenced clones per individual provide a good estimate
for allelic diversity [see Additional File 1]. Our results may
still represent an underestimation of individual allelic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/39

diversity because the number of alleles detected per individual is correlated with the number of clones sequenced.
However, we do not assume that low numbers of detected
Grmi-DAB alleles in some individuals result from deficient sequencing, but from the presence of null alleles
and/or a varying number of MHC-DAB loci in G. microtarsus. In individuals with one to three Grmi-DAB alleles
some loci may have been missed by our primers or they
simply do not exist. In some species the number of MHC
class II loci varies between populations or even individuals of the same population. In cichlid fishes, for instance,
the number of MHC class II B loci varies between haplotypes and individuals, ranging from one to thirteen loci
[76]. In voles Bryja et al. [51] found that individuals differ
in the number of DQA loci, showing either alleles from
one or from two loci. Also for humans and other primates
the number of DRBgenes present per haplotype can vary,
it ranges from one to four in humans and from two to
seven in the rhesus macaque [75,77].
M. incanus shows a similar dimension of MHC II diversity
at the individual level, with each individual carrying 2–4
DAB alleles. In contrast, the number of eight MHC-DAB
alleles in the total sample of 56 individuals is low (more
than five times reduced compared to G. microtarsus)
resulting in similar genotypes throughout the sample.
Each individual revealed two to four Main-DAB alleles,
which is in full concordance with the assumption of two
loci in this species. Still the presence of null alleles cannot
be excluded.
In general, low MHC variation in a population can be
explained by relaxed selection pressure through pathogens and/or genetic drift in small populations, e.g.
through a bottleneck [17,78] or by the mating system
[79]. Diminished MHC diversity is demonstrated, for
instance, in fin whales (Balaenoptera physlaus), sei whales
(B. borealis), Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) [78,80], Malagasy giant jumping rats (Hypogeomys
antimena) [79], moose (Alces alces) [81,82], common
hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) [83] and in Scandinavian beavers (Castor fiber) [71].
The two marsupial species live sympatricly in the Atlantic
rainforest of Brazil. They inhabit the same type of habitat,
although M. incanus frequently uses the forest ground and
the lower strata [84,85], while G. microtarsus is mainly
arboreal and uses the canopy [86]. It was shown that both
species differ in their microhabitat preferences and in
their sensitivity to forest fragmentation [34,35]. Fragmentation does not negatively affect G. microtarsus' abundances, and it prefers more disturbed forest habitats. M.
incanus, on the other hand, responds sensitively to forest
fragmentation with decreasing abundances in small and
isolated areas and increased abundance in old and less

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:39

disturbed forests [34,35]. Males of both species are at least
partially semelparous, meaning that they contribute to
only one breeding season with multiple copulations and
die afterwards due to severe physiological stress [87,88].
The females may survive and reproduce again, often in
two or exceptionally in three consecutive seasons.
Hence, a reduced exposure to pathogens due to a monogamous mating system or a different environment can be
excluded as an explanation of the low MHC diversity in
M. incanus compared to G. microtarsus. Moreover, M. incanus should harbour more parasite infections compared to
G. microtarsus because the mode of terrestrial locomotion
increases the risk of parasitic infections through greater
exposure to soil borne or faecal-orally transmitted parasites [89]. In fact Püttker et al. [90] reported from the same
study populations a much higher nematode prevalence in
M. incanus than in G. microtarsus. We assume that the
explanation for the reduced MHC diversity in M. incanus
might be a genetic bottleneck in the investigated population and that the diminished MHC diversity reflects a
genome-wide loss of diversity. This explanation is supported by the fact that M. incanus is sensitive to habitat
fragmentation, which probably led to reduced migration
and isolation of the study population. G. microtarsus on
the other hand is ecologically more flexible and non sensitive to fragmentation. Probably migration processes are
less or not restricted and therefore MHC diversity is high.
The pattern of low MHC diversity in M. incanus resembles
several examples from eutherian mammals that revealed
low MHC variation in populations after a genetic bottleneck [summarized in [5]].
In future analyses we aim to combine parasitological and
genetic data on adaptive and overall neutral variability to
investigate the role of forest fragmentation in shaping the
different patterns of MHC diversity in the two marsupials.
Lastly, expression analyses are required to shed light onto
the functional differences in the MHC constitution of
these two species.

Conclusion
Despite the previous assumption that marsupials lack polymorphism at the MHC class II, our study revealed high
levels of diversity in a free-ranging population of a South
American marsupial. We tested for three different mechanisms that may generate and maintain MHC diversity:
positive selection, recombination and trans-species polymorphism. The presence of all three mechanisms was
confirmed. Moreover, typical large sequence divergence of
the MHC alleles was found in both species. Beyond that,
the two investigated marsupial populations revealed considerable differences in their MHC-DAB diversity. The
processes leading to these differences will be investigated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/39

in future analyses including parasitological data and
expression analyses.

Methods
Sampling
54 individuals of the Brazilian gracile mouse opossum (G.
microtarsus) and 56 individuals of the Gray slender mouse
opossum (M. incanus) were captured in forest fragments
of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest in the state of São
Paulo, about 60 km south-west of the city of São Paulo.
Animals were live-trapped and anesthetized (Forene,
Abbott GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) for 1–2 minutes to
allow small tissue samples to be taken from the ear, which
were then stored in 70% ethanol. Subsequently, animals
were released at their respective trapping location. For a
detailed description of the study area, sites and trapping
procedures see Püttker et al. [90,91].
PCR and SSCP
DNA was extracted from ear tissue using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We examined a 195
bp fragment of the marsupial MHC class II DAB molecule
coding for the major part of the β1 domain. This part contains most of the functionally important antigen binding
sites in the β chain of the human DR1 molecule [37]. The
fragment was amplified using primers JS1 (5'-GAG TGT
CAT TTC TAC AAC GGG ACG-3') [92] and ML8 (5'-ACG
CGC CTG CGC ACT AAG AAG GGC TC-3'). JS1 was previously designed for the mouse lemur Microcebus murinus
and was successfully applied to several rodent species
[71,93-95]. We designed ML8 for this study based on the
DAB sequence of M. domestica (Modo-DAB1, accession
No. AF010497).

PCR was conducted in a total reaction volume of 20 μl
including 30–100 ng DNA, 0.375 μM of each primer
(Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 1× reaction buffer
(10 mM TrisHCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton ×100, 0.2 mg/
ml BSA), 0.175 mM dNTPs and 1 unit of Taq polymerase
(MPBiomedicals, Heidelberg, Germany). Thermocycling
comprised an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 30s denaturation at 95°C; 60s
annealing at 56°C for G. microtarsus or 51°C for M. incanus, and 60s extension at 72°C. A final extension step was
performed at 72°C for 10 min.
M. incanus individuals were genotyped via single strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) [96]. For denaturation 1–4 μl PCR product were mixed with 6 μl loading dye
(50 mM NaOH + 1 mM EDTA, Xylencyanol) and heated
for 10 min at 50°C. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamid gel
(ETC, Kirchentellinsfurt, Germany). The best separation
of MHC alleles was achieved by setting 200 V, 10 mA, 10
W for 20 min followed by 3 h at 450 V, 30 mA, 20 W (all

steps conducted at constant 12°C). Gels then were fixed
and silver stained (Plus One DNA Silver Staining Kit, GE
Healthcare, Munich). The single strand patterns were
excised from the gel matrix, eluted in 1 × TBE, re-amplified as described above for PCR and prepared for sequencing. Two alleles (Main-DAB*03 and Main-DAB*04)
differed in two nucleotide but revealed identical SSCP patterns. Individuals with this pattern were labelled as MainDAB*03/4 if their band patterns were not sequenced.
Due to a large number of MHC alleles per individual in G.
microtarsus full separation of band patterns could not be
accomplished through SSCP. G. microtarsus was examined
therefore via molecular cloning after initial SSCP trials.
Cloning and Sequencing
Molecular cloning often leads to an increase in misincorporation errors, therefore PCR products for cloning were
generated with a proofreading polymerase (Hotstar Hifidelity polymerase, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Moreover,
in heterogeneous templates (such as MHC genes) PCR
amplifications are susceptible to the creation of artificial
chimeric molecules from two related sequences [97]. The
probability of chimeric molecule formation was reduced
by two modifications of the PCR protocol described
above: The number of cycles was reduced to 32 and the
extension time prolonged to 2:30 min [97]. PCR products
were purified (Cycle pure, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany)
and cloned into a pCR®4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA
cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). At the beginning of the study we determined the
required number of clones to be sequenced to reflect the
individual MHC-diversity by extensive sequencing in two
individuals [see Additional File 1]. Fifteen recombinant
clones per sample were selected, PCR-amplified using the
vector-primers T7 and M13rev, and purified. Sequencing
and sequence analysis was carried out on an ABI PRISM
310 Automated Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Ca, USA) using the BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI).

A clone sequence was accepted as a MHC-DAB allele if
one of the following criteria were met: (1) occurrence in
two independent PCR reactions, (2) confirmation by
SSCP or (3) a minimum of two positions differing from a
known allele. Single sequences differing by one nucleotide from a known allele were attributed to the polymerase misincorporation error (declared by the company: 2.3
× 10-6 per base per cycle, under our conditions one misincorporation every 70 molecules). Sequences differing in
one position were observed more frequently than
explained by this error, but we decided to follow a conservative approach so as to avoid overestimation of allelic
diversity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/39

Sequences that were not confirmed by (1) or (2) were
checked visually for PCR-mediated chimeric formations.
Sequences composed of more than two fragments were
assumed to be true recombination events because a multiple template switching during PCR is highly improbable.
However, no PCR-mediated chimeric sequence was
detected in our data. The MHC-DAB alleles of G. microtarsus and M. incanus were denominated as Grmi-DAB and
Main-DAB corresponding to the MHC nomenclature suggested by Klein and co-workers [36].
Test for positive selection
Under balancing selection a relative excess of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions is expected [7,8].
We calculated the relative rates of synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous (dN) substitutions following the
method of Nei and Gojobory [98] with the Jukes-Cantor
[99] correction for multiple substitutions implemented in
MEGA 3.1. The ratio ω = dN/dS was tested for significant
deviation from one using a Z-test.

We used CODEML integrated into the software PAML
3.15 [39] to identify and test for positively selected codon
sites (dN/dS > 1) in the MHC-DAB sequences. This was
done separately for the two marsupial species. Based on
maximum likelihood procedures the program estimates
heterogeneous ω (= dN/dS) ratios among sites applying
different models of codon evolution. The models are used
to detect positively selected codon sites, and evaluated
using a likelihood-ratio test (LRT). In the LRT two nested
models are compared and the better fitting one is
detected. Therefore, a model based on the null hypothesis
of no selection is applied as well as a more complex model
that assumes positive selection. The LRT is a comparison
of twice the log-likelihood difference (2 [Lb – La]) with a
τ2-distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the
difference in number of estimated parameters between
the two models [100]. In this study, the models M1a
(nearly neutral), M2a (positive selection), M7 (β) and M8
(β + ω) were employed [100]. Null model M1a assumes
two site classes in the molecule with 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1
in proportions p0 and p1 = 1 - p0. The alternative model
M2a incorporates another class of sites with ω2 > 1 and the
proportion p2 estimated from the data. Null model M7
assumes a beta distribution for ω, not allowing for positive selection (0 < ω < 1). In the alternative model M8 a
third class of sites is added, which allows for positive
selection (ω > 1) [101]. Anisimova et al. [40] showed that
the combination of models M7 and M8 is robust against
impact of recombination [41]. In the models M2a and M8
the probabilities for the site classes have been calculated
by the Bayes empirical Bayes method (BEB) [101]. A site
class with a mean ω > 1 is likely to be under positive selection.

Test for gene conversion and recombination
The program GENECONV version 1.81 was used to detect
sequence fragments that were likely to have been subjected to gene conversions. GENECONV detects pairs of
sequences that share unusually long stretches of similarity
given their overall polymorphism [102]. We used global
and pairwise permutation tests (10,000 replicates) for
both species separately to assess significance. No mismatches were accepted and p-values were corrected for
multiple comparisons. In general, this approach is considered to be a powerful way of inferring recombination
events correctly [58], but under extensive recombination
as present at some MHC loci the power of GENECONV
might be reduced [51].

We further applied the composite-likelihood method
after Hudson [103] implemented in the program LDhat
[43] to estimate the population recombination rate (ρ =
4Ner). The population recombination rate is a product of
the crossing over rate per generation, r, and the effective
population size, Ne. This product can be estimated without prior information on these parameters [43]. LDhat
works efficiently for sequences evolving under balancing
selection even in the presence of numerous recombination events [104]. In a likelihood permutation test the
population recombination estimate ρ was tested for statistical significance against the hypothesis of no recombination (ρ = 0). The minimum number of recombinant
events (RM) was calculated after Hudson and Kaplan
[four-gamete method, [43]] using the software DnaSP
[45].
Phylogenetic analyses
Sequence alignment and manual revision were performed
in MEGA version 3.1 [105]. The same software was
applied for the construction of a phylogenetic tree using
the neighbour joining method [106], based on Kimura's
two-parameter evolutionary distances [107]. In the phylogenetic tree the following Genbank sequences were
applied: Marsupialia: Macropus eugenii: Maeu-DAB1
