Abstract
Background: Dictyostelium discoideum is one of the most famous model organisms for studying
motile processes like cell movement, organelle transport, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. Members
of the myosin superfamily, that move on actin filaments and power many of these tasks, are
tripartite proteins consisting of a conserved catalytic domain followed by the neck region consisting
of a different number of so-called IQ motifs for binding of light chains. The tails contain functional
motifs that are responsible for the accomplishment of the different tasks in the cell. Unicellular
organisms like yeasts contain three to five myosins while vertebrates express over 40 different
myosin genes. Recently, the question has been raised how many myosins a simple multicellular
organism like Dictyostelium would need to accomplish all the different motility-related tasks.
Results: The analysis of the Dictyostelium genome revealed thirteen myosins of which three have
not been described before. The phylogenetic analysis of the motor domains of the new myosins
placed Myo1F to the class-I myosins and Myo5A to the class-V myosins. The third new myosin, an
orphan myosin, has been named MyoG. It contains an N-terminal extension of over 400 residues,
and a tail consisting of four IQ motifs and two MyTH4/FERM (myosin tail homology 4/band 4.1,
ezrin, radixin, and moesin) tandem domains that are separated by a long region containing an SH3
(src homology 3) domain. In contrast to previous analyses, an extensive comparison with 126 classVII, class-X, class-XV, and class-XXII myosins now showed that MyoI does not group into any of
these classes and should not be used as a model for class-VII myosins.
The search for calmodulin related proteins revealed two further potential myosin light chains. One
is a close homolog of the two EF-hand motifs containing MlcB, and the other, CBP14,
phylogenetically groups to the ELC/RLC/calmodulin (essential light chain/regulatory light chain)
branch of the tree.
Conclusion: Dictyostelium contains thirteen myosins together with 6–8 MLCs (myosin light chain)
to assist in a variety of actin-based processes in the cell. Although they are homologous to myosins
of higher eukaryotes, the myosins of Dictyostelium should be considered with care as models for
specific functions of vertebrate myosins.

Background
Three kinds of molecular motor proteins have been identified so far: myosins, kinesins, and dyneins [1,2]. While
kinesins and dyneins move on microtubule tracks,
myosins are the only motors that use the energy of ATP
hydrolysis to power movement along actin filaments. The
first myosin was identified in skeletal muscle tissue, and
subsequently a large number of proteins containing the
myosin motor domain have been discovered in eukaryotic cells where they fulfill a variety of cellular functions
from cell division, cellular locomotion, vesicle transport
to muscle contraction [1].
Myosin proteins are typically divided into three major
domains. The motor domain that is usually found at the
N-terminus contains the nucleotide and actin binding
sites. The neck domain, following the motor domain, consists of a helical segment that binds specific myosin light
chains or calmodulin. The target sequence for light chain
binding is based on the consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR
[3] and therefore termed the IQ motif. Myosins may have
zero to over 15 IQ motifs in the neck region. The third
domain is called the tail domain and contains class specific functional motifs that are responsible for the accomplishment of the different tasks of the myosins in the cell
[1]. The classification of the myosins is based on the phylogenetic relation of the myosin motor domains. Altogether, up to 20 myosin classes have been assigned in
recent reviews [4,5]. In addition, there are many myosins
for which close homologs have not been found and which
are therefore termed orphan myosins. Recently, two analyses of myosin proteins describing conflicting findings
have been published [6,7]. Both disagree with previously
established models of myosin evolution [reviewed in [5]],
because of the erroneous data sets and analysis methods
used. However, we have performed an exhaustive analysis
of 1910 manually annotated myosins from 303 species
that will be referred to in the analysis of the Dictyostelium
discoideum myosins (F. Odronitz and M. Kollmar, submitted).
Different organisms contain only a subset of the classes
but in many cases several homologs of the same class. For
example, the Entamoeba histolytica genome reveals one
class-I and one class-II myosin [8], while the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome contains two class-I, one class-II, and
two class-V myosins [9]. In contrast, more complex
genomes show more diversity. The Caenorhabditis elegans
genome contains 17 myosins belonging to seven classes,
the Drosophila melanogaster genome contains 13 myosins
belonging to ten classes, and the Homo sapiens genome
reveals 40 myosins belonging to twelve classes. Plants do
not have a large repertoire of classes but many homologs
of the class-VIII and class-XI myosins (e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana contains 4 class-VIII and 13 class-XI myosin genes).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/183

For the lower eukaryot Dictyostelium discoideum, 14
myosins or potential myosins have been reported so far.
The first myosin identified, a class-II myosin, has been
named mhcA (myosin heavy chain A) and all subsequently discovered myosins where named alphabetical
(MyoA-M). For MyoF and MyoH only small fragments of
the motor domain have been obtained while for MyoG
and MyoL only potential loci have been identified. The
class-I myosins (MyoA-E, MyoK) and the class-II myosin
have unambiguously been assigned in the past [e.g.
[5,10]]. MyoI has been classified as a class-VII myosin
[5,11], although the phylogenetic grouping has been very
weak, while no similar myosin has been found to MyoM
that has therefore been added to the orphan class. The
closest homologues found for MyoJ came from the classXI myosins, a class only containing plant myosins, and it
was therefore grouped to them [12,13].
Almost all myosins exist at least as heterodimers by binding of light chains to the neck region. The light chains
bind to the IQ motif and have an essential role in stabilizing the neck, so it can function as a rigid lever arm that
swings relative to the motor domain to generate movement [14]. In addition, the light chains can be important
regulatory sites, either through phosphorylation or by
binding of Ca2+ [15]. The light chains belong to the family
of calmodulin-related proteins. Most myosins are
expected to bind calmodulins, while the class-II myosins
always bind two specific calmodulin-related proteins, the
essential and the regulatory myosin light chains. Recently,
calmodulin-related proteins have been identified that specifically bind to a certain myosin, e.g. a light chain binding to Toxoplasma gondii Myo14A [TgMLC-1, [16]], or the
light chain binding to Accanthamoeba castellanii Myo1C
[AcMICLC, [17]]. For Dictyostelium discoideum, in addition
to the essential and the regulatory myosin light chains two
further specific light chains have been discovered. The
class-I myosin MyoD binds a light chains that is phylogenetically related the AcMyo1C light chain [MlcD, [18]],
and the class-I myosin MyoB forms a heterodimer with a
light chain that is unique as it consists of only the half of
a calmodulin-related protein [MlcB, [19]].
Dictyostelium is one of the most famous model organisms
for studying motile processes in cells, especially those
related to the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, the question
has been raised how many myosins a simple multicellular
organism like Dictyostelium would need to accomplish all
the diverse motility-related tasks [10]. Here, the complete
repertoire of myosin family proteins in the slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum is presented. The analysis
revealed thirteen myosin proteins of which three have not
been described so far. The new myosin family members
are described and the already published myosins revised
and partially reclassified. In addition, all members of the

calmodulin-related protein family in Dictyostelium have
been identified and analyzed to reveal the complete repertoire of myosin light chains.

Results and discussion
Identification of Dictyostelium discoideum myosins
The TBLASTN search with the motor domain of the Dictyostelium discoideum class-II myosin against the Dictyostelium genome sequence retrieved the previously identified
and described genes and three new myosin genes (Table
1). Small fragments of two of these myosins (Myo1F and
Myo5A, former MyoH) have already been obtained in an
investigation that combined low-stringency hybridization, physical mapping techniques, and PCR [20], but
have not been verified in later studies. The study also
revealed two additional loci that were referred to as myoG
and myoL. The analysis of the Dictyostelium genome now
showed that the myoG locus is a real locus, and the corresponding new myosin protein has been named MyoG.
However, there is no evidence for further myosin genes
and the myoL locus has most probably been assigned
based on experimental artefacts.

The Dictyostelium cDNA database in Japan [21] was
searched for the new myosin genes to confirm their
expression (exclusion of pseudogenes) and gene structure,
as the newly identified myoF, myoH, and myoG genes con-

tain several introns (Table 1). However, the cDNA clones
only cover the region around the last of the introns of
Myo5A (MyoH). The extremely high AT content of Dictyostelium introns and the help of a multiple sequence alignment of over 1700 myosin motor domains (M. Kollmar,
unpublished data) nevertheless allowed the unambiguous identification of the introns and, subsequently, the
protein coding regions.
The Dictyostelium cDNA database also contains at least
cDNA fragments for all previously reported myosins. The
analysis of the genome sequence and the cDNA data
revealed several major discrepancies to the published
sequences (Table 2) in addition to many amino acid substitutions. The sequences derived from the genomesequencing project are without much doubt the correct
sequences, because the genome sequence was build on
high coverage and is completely in accordance with the
cDNA data. Also, the sequences derived from the genome
data are in agreement with the multiple sequence alignment while the published old sequences create strange
insertions and substitutions. It is very unlikely that the differences are due to strain differences because the AX4
strain, that has been used to create the genome sequence
and cDNA libraries, has been derived from the AX2 and
AX3 strains used in earlier publications [22].

Expression pattern of the new myosin genes
The cDNA database is based on libraries of cells obtained
from several different stages of the developmental cycle of
Dictyostelium [23]. One library contains data from clones
obtained at the so-called first finger stage (14 h – 16 h) of
development. A second library was constructed from vegetatively growing cells. A third library contains clones
derived from "sexually competent cells" (cells are cultured
in liquid medium in the dark, and are competent for
fusion with opposite mating type cells), cells that are
roughly equivalent to growth phase cells. The data supposed to contain full-length genes is based on libraries
from cells at the following stages of the developmental
cycle: axenically growing cells, cells developed on nitrocellulose filter to aggregation stage (8 hours), slug stage
(16 hours) and early culmination stage (20 hours). For
Myo5A (MyoH) and MyoG cDNA fragments have been
obtained in all libraries containing the potentially fulllength genes indicating that these two myosins are
expressed in all stages of the developmental cycle. However, only one gene fragment has been obtained for
Myo1F from the library of full-length genes of axenically
growing cells. The cDNA data is not supposed to reveal the
complete expression pattern of all proteins at the different
developmental stages. But the number of obtained clones
and the occurrence in a specific library indicates that
Myo1F might not be strongly expressed, and primarily
expressed in vegetative cells. These conclusions have of
course to be confirmed by further experimental data.
Classification, nomenclature, and phylogenetic analysis
The classification and suggested revised nomenclature of
the Dictyostelium myosins is summarized in Table 1 and
shown in Figure 1. The general nomenclature for myosin
proteins uses the term Myo followed by the class number
(Arabic numeral) and the variant (Arabic letter). The class-

II myosins are exceptions as Mhc or Myh is used as abbreviation (leaving out the class number) followed by the
variant designations as either Arabic letters or Arabic
numerals. To not severely increase the number of classes,
myosins that do not have a homolog in at least one other
organism should be referred to as orphans. So far, the Dictyostelium myosins have not consistently been named
according to that nomenclature. The phylogenetic analysis of over 1700 myosin motor domains (M. Kollmar,
unpublished data) together with the completed sequence
of the Dictyostelium genome now allows a revision. The
new nomenclature does not severely change the old
names as the class-II myosin stays untouched, the class-I
myosins only get the class designation added with the
exception of MyoK that will now be referred to as Myo1G,
and MyoM is still an orphan myosin and will not be
renamed as long as it cannot be grouped to a certain class.
The newly identified MyoG (preliminarily named according to its locus) is also an orphan myosin and might be
renamed as soon as further homologous myosins are
derived. However, the classification of the other myosins,
MyoH, MyoJ, and MyoI, is not that unambiguous.
A phylogenetic tree of 180 myosins of the classes V, VIII,
and XI (including the former class-XIII myosins) does not
group MyoH and MyoJ to any of the already assigned
classes (Figure 2, additional file 1). Instead of assigning
these myosins a new class, as it happened in the past e.g.
for the classification of the Acetabularia cliftonii class-XIII
myosins, I suggest to name MyoH and MyoJ Myo5A and
Myo5B, respectively. Both myosins have a similar domain
organisation as the class-V and the class-XI myosins. But
because Dictyostelium separated from the Fungi/Metazoa
lineage after the separation of the plants, MyoH and MyoJ
should rather be referred to as class-V than class-XI
myosins. This classification is supported by the analysis of

the over 1700 myosins that revealed MyoH and MyoJ to
be closer related to the class-V myosins than to the plant
myosins (M. Kollmar, unpublished data).
MyoI does not group to any of the designated classes containing myosins with MyTH4/FERM domains as is shown
by the phylogenetic analysis of 126 myosin motor
domains of classes VII, X, XV, and XXII (Figure 3, additional file 2). It does not group to the class-XXII myosins
although it branches from the class-XXII myosins in the
tree shown. The reason is that the branching occurs very
close to the separation point of the other classes, and in
phylogenetic trees including all classes MyoI also often
branches very early from the class-X myosins. A close view
at the protein sequence in the multiple sequence alignment shows that MyoI shares several class specific features
off all four classes that prevent a better classification. In
addition to the motor domain sequence, the domain
organisation of MyoI is unique compared to members of
the other classes (Figure 4). In contrast to class-VII
myosins, MyoI does not have an N-terminal SH3-like
domain, it has four instead of five IQ-motifs and it misses
the first FERM domain. The tails of class-X myosins are
different to that of MyoI as they are characterised by two

consecutive PH (pleckstrin homology) domains followed
by the MyTH/FERM tandem domain. The domain organisation of the class-XV myosin tails is similar to that of
MyoI except that the mammalian myosins have a very
long N-terminal domain, while the insect myosins miss
the SH3 domain. Like MyoI, the class-XXII myosins do
not have an N-terminal domain, but their tail domain is
different containing two complete MyTH/FERM tandem
domains but no SH3 domain. Thus, MyoI cannot be
grouped to any of the already designated classes and
should be considered as an orphan myosin. This implicates that MyoI cannot be considered as a specific model
for class-VII myosins as it has been suggested earlier
[11,24]. The Dictyosteliida diverged before the evolution of
the Metazoa. MyoI therefore rather resembles a common
ancestor of the four classes instead of grouping to one of
them.
Domain structure of the known myosins
Most of the tail domains of the known myosins have
already been described and functionally analysed in some
detail [25,26]. While there is agreement on the determination of the larger tail domains like the class-I myosin
membrane-binding and SH3 domains, or the Myo5B

(MyoJ) DIL (dilute) domain, there are contradicting predictions of the IQ motifs. The IQ motif is a short sequence
motif of alpha-helical structure that is able to bind calmodulin or calmodulin-like proteins. IQ motifs have
been predicted in the past by using the general pattern
IQxxxRGxxxR [3]. The multiple sequence alignment of the
whole myosin family now allows a revision of the motif
(M. Kollmar, unpublished data). According to the revised
motif several IQ motifs are found in the Dictyostelium
myosins that have not been recognised before (Figure 1

and Figure 5). The starting isoleucine in the motif is often
substituted by other large hydrophobic amino acids. The
glutamine at the second position is mainly conserved,
except for some cases where it can be substituted by lysine,
glycine, or glutamate. A very important position is the residue before the first arginine, that is almost always a large
hydrophobic amino acid, in most cases an aromatic one.
The first arginine is also highly conserved, except for a few
cases where it is substituted by lysine, leucine, or isoleucine. The following glycine is not very conserved in IQ

motifs of myosin tails. The position after that glycine is
mainly occupied by large hydrophobic amino acids, in
most cases aromatic residues, but histidines, asparagines,
and glutamines are also found. The second arginine of the
initial motif is also not very conserved. Using the revised
motif, no IQ motif is predicted for Myo1G, one is predicted for Myo1B and Myo1D, and two are predicted for
the other class-I myosins. Myo1C might contain a third IQ

motif but then the packing of the light chains would be
relatively dense. However, Myo1B binds a light chain that
consists of only two EF-hand motifs [half the size of a normal calmodulin-related protein, [19]]. Two similarly
small myosin light chains could easily bind to the two
closely located IQ motifs of Myo1C. According to the new
motif description MyoI is now predicted to contain four
IQ motifs in contrast to earlier predictions of three IQ

motifs [11], and Myo5B (MyoJ) contains six. The domain
compositions of the newly identified myosins are
described in more detail below.
Domain structure of the newly identified and analysed
myosins
Myo1F
This myosin is the seventh class-I myosin found in the
Dictyostelium genome. Based on the short fragment of the
motor domain which has been obtained in an earlier
PCR-based screen of the genome [27] it was already supposed to group to this subfamily. Its motor domain
sequence is most similar to that of Myo1E. Unlike the
other class-I myosins that contain only small N-terminal
extensions to the motor domain of 8 to 15 residues it has
an N-terminal domain of 50 amino acids. However, based
on its sequence this small domain is unlikely to fold into
a similar structure like the N-terminal domain of class-II
myosins. Directly following the motor domain, Myo1F
has two consecutive IQ motifs that are strong indicators
for binding of calmodulin or a calmodulin-like myosin
light chain. A short coiled-coil region has been predicted
for the small region between the two IQ motifs. The short
distance of only about 20 residues, however, makes it
unlikely that Myo1F would be able to dimerize in that
area. The remainder of the tail is similar to those of
Myo1A or Myo1E predicted to be all α-helical. In the cen-

tre of the tail there is a domain rich in basic residues and
it is therefore outlined as membrane binding domain in
analogy to those of the other class-I myosins. Whether this
region really binds to membranes has to be shown.
Myo5A (former MyoH)
Myo5A seems to be the smaller brother of Myo5B (MyoJ).
Both are phylogenetically closely related and show similar
domain organisations. Altogether, Myo5A (MyoH) is 480
aa shorter in length. It also has an N-terminal SH3-like
domain, but the N-terminal extension is not as long as for
Myo5B (MyoJ). In contrast to Myo5B (MyoJ), it has three
additional long insertions into surface loops of the motor
domain that are not observed in any other Dictyostelium
myosin sequence. It has five instead of six IQ motives for
binding of light chains, and the coiled-coil region is predicted to be considerably shorter than that of Myo5B
(MyoJ). Except for the DIL domain at the C-terminus of
the tail there is no further sequence similarity between the
two Myo5 tail sequences.
MyoG
MyoG does not group to any of the class-VII, class-X, classXV, or class-XXII myosins, or any other myosin, and is
therefore designated an orphan myosin. MyoG is one of
the longest myosins of the whole family. It has an N-terminal domain of 440 residues that does not show any

similar hand-over-hand mechanism as has been found for
other myosin dimers like class-V myosins [29].
Structural features of the myosin motor domains
The myosins of Dictyostelium contain several protein specific extensions to surface loops of the motor domain of
class-II myosin (Fig. 6). The most prominent loop-extension is the insertion of ~130 amino acids into loop-1 of
Myo1G. Except for members of an arthropoda specific
myosin class, that contain loop-1 extensions of up to 300
amino acids [30], this is by far the longest loop-1 of all
myosins. Myo5B (MyoJ) also contains a considerably
longer loop-1 (20 residues in addition to loop-1 of
MhcA). Loop-1 has been implicated in influencing access
to the nucleotide-binding site. It has been shown in an
analysis of chimeric loop-1 mutants of smooth muscle
myosin that the mobility of this loop correlates to the rate
of ADP release [31]. Larger and more flexible loops
resulted in faster rates of ADP release. For class-V myosins,
the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle is ADP release
[32], a necessity for these myosins to walk over long distances along the actin filaments without detaching. Based
on these results, Myo5B (MyoJ) might be a very unconventional class-V myosin with a fast rate of ADP release. It
will be very interesting to see whether Myo5B (MyoJ) is
still a long-distance cargo transporting myosin as the
other homologs of the class.

homology do other proteins. The sequence in the N-terminal domain contains long stretches of consecutive
asparagines and serines that are typical for many Dictyostelium proteins [28]. The head domain is followed by four
IQ motifs. The C-terminal tail is characterised by two
MyTH4/FERM tandem domains that are separated by a
long region containing an SH3 domain and a short predicted coiled-coil region. The regions between these recognised domains also contain many stretches of consecutive
polar residues. An outstanding case is the nine-fold consecutive repeat of the motif 'SQQQQ'. The C-terminal end
of the tail contains a second predicted coiled-coil region.
The coiled-coil domains in myosins are normally located
directly behind the IQ motifs and are responsible for dimerisation. MyoG might also exist as a dimer in vivo, but the
heads are not expected to move on actin filaments in a

Loop-2 has been shown to be involved in both weak and
strong binding interactions with actin [33]. According to
this study, especially positively charged residues
strengthen the binding to actin. MyoG and MyoM contain
long extensions of loop-2 compared to MhcA, but the
sequences contain mainly glycines, prolines, and polar
amino acids. Thus, both myosins are not expected to have
considerably different actin-binding properties. Loop-4 is
the loop that is furthest removed from the actin surface as
has been suggested from actomyosin models derived from
electron microscopy. Except for some class-I, the insect
class-V, some class-XVII, and some apicomplexa myosins,
almost all myosins have a loop-4 of similar length. The
loop has been suggested to be involved in either interactions with actin or regulatory proteins that are bound to
actin [34]. For the class-I myosin myr1 from rat, it has
been shown that a head fragment localizes to the same
highly dynamic actin structures at the cell cortex as the
full-length construct and not to the actin filaments that
are regulated by tropomyosin [35]. An extended loop-4
might be responsible for this localisation as it might
hinder binding to the tropomyosin stabilized less
dynamic actin filaments as they occur in stress fibers.
Myo5A (MyoH) contains one of the longest loop-4 of all
myosins and might therefore only bind to the dynamic
actin structures at the cell cortex and not to actin structures
that are stabilized by other proteins.

of the loops for MhcA. The approximate lengths of the insertions are given for the respective myosins.

MyoM has an extended loop at the same position where
the class-VI myosins have one of their prominent insertions. This loop has been suggested to affect nucleotide
binding by changing the conformation of a following
loop [36]. This loop therefore protrudes within the nucleotide-binding pocket, resulting in a decrease in nucleotide
accessibility. The functions of the other two surface loops,
for which Myo5A (MyoH) has long extensions, have not
been analysed so far.
Phylogenetic analysis of calmodulin-like proteins in
Dictyostelium
An iterative TBLASTN search of the Dictyostelium genome
data, starting with the sequence of Dictyostelium calmodulin A (DdCalA), revealed 35 CBPs (calcium-binding pro-

tein) that exclusively contain EF-hands motifs (Table 3).
While 32 CBPs contain four EF-hands, three contain only
two EF-hand motifs (MlcB, MLC-1, and CBP10). 22 CBPs
have already been described in the literature. To classify
the remaining 13 CBPs and to identify those that could
potentially function as myosin light chains, the Dictyostelium EF-hand proteins were compared with EF-hand containing
proteins from
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and some specific
myosin light chains from other organisms. The obtained
176 calmodulin-related proteins were manually aligned
and a phylogenetic tree created (Figure 7, additional file
3).

According to the phylogenetic tree, 16 of the Dictyostelium CBPs (CBP1-13, calfumirin) do not belong to an
already named class but are closely related to the frequenins. CBP4c is very similar to CBP4a and CBP4b, but
the N-terminus could not be identified. CBP13 is a protein fragment, missing the N-terminus as well as the C-terminus, and is very similar to CBP12. CBP4c and CBP13
are therefore most probably pseudogenes. Those members of this group, that have already been identified,
belong to developmentally regulated genes. Their distinct
spatial expression patterns suggested that they might be
involved in morphogenesis [37]. Seven of the Dictyostelium CBPs belong to the frequenin class. The members of
the frequenin class are also highly developmentally regulated. An interaction with a myosin family protein has not
been described in the literature for any member of this

group of any organism. Dictyostelium also contains two
centrins and two proteins grouping to the calcineurin
family.
So far, only the ELC and RLC myosin light chains as well
as calmodulin subfamily proteins have been shown to
bind to the IQ motifs of myosins. The exceptions are the
myosin light chain of Toxoplasma gondii Myo14A [TgMLC1, [16]], the light chain of Accanthamoeba castellanii
Myo1C [AcMIMLC, [17]], and, identified in Dictyostelium,
a light chain of Myo1D that is phylogenetically related the
AcMyo1C light chain [MlcD, [18]], and a light chain that
binds to Myo1B [MlcB, [19]]. Next to MlcD and MlcB, Dictyostelium contains one ELC and one RLC myosin light
chain that bind to MhcA. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae it has
been shown that the ELC (also termed Mlc1p) not only

binds to the class-II myosin, but also to the class-V myosin
Myo2p. Chicken myosin-5A even binds two different
ELCs next to calmodulin. Therefore, the Dictyostelium ELC
is also expected to participate in binding to the class-V
myosins. Dictyostelium also contains two members of the
calmodulin subfamily that have not specifically been

shown to bind to myosins, but are highly expected to in
accordance with results obtained for other organisms. The
analysis also revealed another CBP containing two EFhand motifs that is most closely related to MlcB. It is
therefore also highly expected to bind to a myosin, and
termed MLC-1. As Myo1B and Myo1D bind a specific light

chain each, and Myo1C is the closest homolog of the
remaining class-I myosins, MLC-1 might be the specific
light chain for Myo1C, but this has of course to be proven
by biochemical experiments.
CBP14 does not group to any specific class but is more
similar to the members of the calmodulin/ELC/RLC part
of the phylogenetic tree then to the developmentally
related CBPs. If it were able to function as a myosin light
chain, then it would be the founding member for another
specific myosin light chain class.

Project. These genes are in consistence with the assembly
of the recently published genome [28]. The two
sequences, as well as MyoG that has also been derived
from genomic data [38], are therefore predicted sequences
that have not been verified by complete cDNAs. The Japanese cDNA project [21,23] includes only small parts of
these new myosins, which are, however, consistent with
the predicted sequences. The Japanese cDNA project also
includes at least fragments of all other myosins. No additional myosin genes have been found in the genome of
Dictyostelium, and thus the reported "myoL" gene locus
[27] might have originated from experimental artefacts.

Conclusion
The analysis of the Dictyostelium discoideum genome
revealed thirteen members of the myosin family of which
three have not been described before. The phylogenetic
analysis of their motor domains placed seven myosins to
the class-I myosins (Myo1A to Myo1G, Myo1F is a new
member), one to the class-II myosins (MhcA), and two, of
which Myo5A (MyoH) has newly been identified, to the
class-V myosins. Three myosins (MyoG, MyoI, and
MyoM) do not have a close homolog in any other organism and could therefore not be classified. In contrast to
previous analyses, an extensive comparison with 126
class-VII, class-X, class-XV, and class-XXII myosins now
showed that MyoI does not group into any of these classes
and can not be used as a model for class-VII myosins. The
third new myosin has been named MyoG. It contains an
N-terminal extension of over 400 residues, and a tail consisting of four IQ motifs and two MyTH4/FERM tandem
domains that are separated by a long region containing an
SH3 domain. Although its tail organisation is similar to
that of class-VII myosins, the motor domain of MyoG
does not group into any existing class.
Four specific myosin light chains have been identified so
far (ELC, RLC, MlcB, MlcD) next to two calmodulins. The
analysis of the genome revealed another protein containing two EF-hand motifs that is closely related to MlcB.
Based on its phylogenetic relationship it is highly
expected to be a myosin light chain. A further calmodulinrelated protein, termed CBP14, phylogenetically groups
to the ELC/RLC/calmodulin branch of the tree and might
therefore also be a myosin light chain, although it does
not have a close homolog in other model organisms.

Methods
Identification of Dictyostelium myosins and calmodulin
related proteins
The full-length sequences of ten of the thirteen Dictyostelium myosins have been reported in the literature (Table
1). Partial sequences of Myo1F (MyoF) and Myo5A
(MyoH) have already been reported [27] and were used as
basis for the manual assembly of the genes from clones
published by the Dictyostelium Genome Sequencing

The Dictyostelium calmodulin-related genes have been
identified in an iterated TBLASTN search of the completed
Dictyostelium genome starting with the protein sequence
of CalA. Thus, all solely EF-hand motif-containing proteins have been collected (Table 3). The predicted
sequences have been verified by searches against the Japanese cDNA database [23]. The EF-hand containing proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and
Homo sapiens have been obtained in iterative TBLASTN
searches of the corresponding genomes. Specific myosin
light chains from other organisms have been obtained
from the protein database at NCBI.
Building trees
The complete analysis of the myosin motor domains
derived from the NCBI non-redundant database and the
EST and genomic sequences of more than 270 eukaryotes
will be published elsewhere (Kollmar, unpublished data).
All these myosin sequences, including the Dictyostelium
myosins, together with their accession numbers and additional references will be accessible through the newly
designed CyMoBase [[39], F. Odronitz and M. Kollmar,
submitted]. The database comprises over 1700 myosin
sequences (Feb. 2006) that have been used for the phylogenetic classification of the Dictyostelium myosins. The
underlying phylogenetic tree has been built of a structureguided multiple sequence alignment. The phylogenetic
trees of the class-V/-VIII/-XI and the class-VII/-X/-XV/-XXII
myosins have been constructed from corresponding
sequences of this alignment. All phylogenetic trees are
unrooted and were generated using neighbour joining
and the Bootstrap (1,000 replicates) method as implemented in ClustalW [standard settings, [40]] and drawn
by using TreeView [41].

The phylogenetic tree of the calmodulin-related proteins
has been calculated based on a manual sequence alignment. The manual sequence alignment has been
improved by iteratively creating phylogenetic trees and
adjusting the alignment. The resulting phylogenetic tree is
unrooted and was generated using neighbour joining and

Domain and motif prediction
Protein domains were predicted using the SMART [42,43]
and Pfam [44,45] web server. The prediction of protein
motifs (coiled coils, leucine zipper, prenyl-group binding
motifs) is mainly based on the results of the predict-protein server [46,47]. The IQ-motifs and N-terminal
domains were predicted manually based on the homology to similar domains of other myosins included in the
multiple sequence alignment of the myosins. The recognition motifs included in the SMART and Pfam databases
are too restrictive, as the motifs have been created based
on the small datasets available some years ago.
