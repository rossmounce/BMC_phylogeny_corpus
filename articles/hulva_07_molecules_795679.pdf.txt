Abstract
Background: The Rhinopomatidae, traditionally considered to be one of the most ancient
chiropteran clades, remains one of the least known groups of Rhinolophoidea. No relevant fossil
record is available for this family. Whereas there have been extensive radiations in related families
Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, there are only a few species in the Rhinopomatidae and their
phylogenetic relationship and status are not fully understood.
Results: Here we present (a) a phylogenetic analysis based on a partial cytochrome b sequence,
(b) new fossils from the Upper Miocene site Elaiochoria 2 (Chalkidiki, Greece), which represents
the first appearance datum of the family based on the fossil record, and (c) discussion of the
phylogeographic patterns in both molecular and morphological traits. We found deep divergences
in the Rhinopoma hardwickii lineage, suggesting that the allopatric populations in (i) Iran and (ii)
North Africa and the Middle East should have separate species status. The latter species (R. cystops)
exhibits a shallow pattern of isolation by distance (separating the Middle East and the African
populations) that contrasts with the pattern of geographic variation in the morphometrical traits.
A deep genetic gap was also found in Rhinopoma muscatellum (Iran vs. Yemen). We found only
minute genetic distance between R. microphyllum from the Levant and India, which fails to support
the sub/species distinctness of the Indian form (R. microphyllum kinneari).
Conclusion: The mtDNA survey provided phylogenetic tree of the family Rhinopomatidae for the
first time and revealed an unexpected diversification of the group both within R. hardwickii and R.
muscatellum morphospecies. The paleobiogeographic scenario compiled in respect to molecular
clock data suggests that the family originated in the region south of the Eocene Western Tethyan
seaway or in India, and extended its range during the Early Miocene. The fossil record suggests a
Miocene spread into the Mediterranean region, followed by a post-Miocene retreat. Morphological
analysis compared with genetic data indicates considerable phenotypic plasticity in this group.

Background
The mammalian order Chiroptera serves as an excellent

example of how molecular phylogenetics has influenced
the taxonomy of a seemingly well resolved group. Genetic

data invalidated the traditional subdivision of bats into
suborders Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera when
Teeling et al. [1-3] provided molecular evidence supporting sister position of one clade of microbats, Rhinolophoidea, with Megachiroptera. For that reason, the actual
content of the Rhinolophoidea and phylogenetic structure of that clade became a matter of considerable interest.
In the traditional view [4], Rhinolophoidea included Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, and Nycteridae. Molecular evidence [2,5] has suggested that
Nycteridae is not a member of that clade, but a sister
group to Emballonuridae, whereas molecular data have
brought two previously unassociated groups, Rhinopomatidae and Craseonycteridae, traditionally arranged
together with Emballonuridae in the superfamily Emballonuroidea, into the Rhinolophoidea. The molecular taxonomy of Craseonycteridae has also been dealt with
briefly [5], but Rhinopomatidae has remained one of the
few mammalian families not re-examined from the perspective of molecular genetics (except for the data suggesting its position among Rhinolophoidea, close to
Craseonycteridae and Megadermatidae [3,6,7].
The lack of genetic data is particularly frustrating because
Rhinopomatidae is, for several reasons, the most enigmatic group of extant bats. It is a monotypic family (composed of a single genus, Rhinopoma Geoffroy, 1813) with
an exceptionally large geographic range covering a considerable part of tropical subsaharan Africa and most of the
southern Mediterranean, Middle East, and southern Asia
(from Morocco, Senegal and Kenya, through Arabia and
the Middle East, to India, Thailand and Sunda Archipelago) [4,8,9]. Among monotypic families of mammals,
only Rhinolophidae, Equidae and Manidae occupy such
extensive geographic ranges. In contrast to rich data on the
history and relationships of the other two families, no
such information is available for Rhinopomatidae: there
is no fossil record of the family (except for one occurrence
in the Late Pleistocene of Israel [10]) and the relationship
of the family to other bats has traditionally been unresolved. Rhinopomatidae bear a unique set of morphological plesiomorphies for which they were often regarded as
the most primitive group of Microchiroptera close to the
common ancestor of microbats and megabats [4,11-14].
After recent shaking of the chiropteran tree by molecular
phylogenetics, rhinopomatids retained their basal position – in morphological respects they are still the most
primitive clade within Rhinolophoidea and, thus, also the
most primitive extant clade within the Yinpterochiroptera
in the sense of Teeling et al. [3]. For all these reasons, Rhinopomatidae are an extremely attractive subject for a
detailed study. Yet, these bats are quite rare throughout
their range and recent records from many important
regions are simply not available. Consequently, very few
authors succeeded in comprehensive investigation of this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/165

taxon and its current taxonomy reflects numerous uncertainties about its actual content.
The present paper provides the first phylogenetic study on
the family Rhinopomatidae based on the samples subsequently collected from the regions situated in the centre of
the family range, i.e. Levant, Arabia, Iran, India and NE
Africa (Figure 1). The results suggest that the taxonomic
structure of the group is rather more complicated than
commonly expected. In previous taxonomies, the genus
Rhinopoma was divided into two to seven species and several local forms, for which at least 17 names are available.
The detailed taxonomic review [see Additional file 1]
demonstrates complicated and often opposing viewpoints and illustrates that attempts to reconstruct the
structure of this family on the basis of classical markers
alone were seldom persuasive. The most recent and comprehensive revision of the group [9] established a set of
diagnostic morphological characters which splits the
genus into four separate species sharing a broad range of
sympatry. This arrangement has become the standard taxonomy [comp. [9,15]] and it is adopted as the null hypothesis in the present paper (i.e. we refer to R. hardwickii, R.
muscatellum and R. microphyllum lineages). The phylogroups revealed by our investigation are distinguished by
Roman numerals (I–V), their nomenclatorial assignments
summarized in Table 1 and explained in Additional file 1.
We also report the first Neogene fossil record of Rhinopomatidae and discuss the history of this unique family of
bats.

Results
Morphometry
Despite using a considerably extended set of morphometrical characters and applying multivariate morphometric
analyses (based on 252 specimens, including types of 7
taxa, see [16] for details) our results revealed the same pattern of variation as reported in detail by Van Cakenberghe
and De Vree [9], and Benda et al. [16,17]. Rhinopoma
microphyllum, R. hardwickii, and R. muscatellum are distinct
with partial overlap between the latter two (Figure 2).
These phenotypic groups (or morphospecies) were found
to be internally homogenous in their diagnostic characters, with R. hardwickii having the pronounced intraspecific variation, particularly in metrical components of
body size [for details see Additional file 1].
Molecular analyses
We obtained 26 sequences from ingroup taxa of the first
402 bp of the cytochrome b gene. Ninety-nine positions
were variable, 93 were parsimony informative, and all
mutations were base substitutions. The Rhinopoma samples analyzed fell into 15 haplotypes. The sequences
exhibited a low level of saturation at the first and second
codon positions, with a deflection from linearity at third

codon positions. We used a GTR + I + G distance correction model with gamma distribution shape parameter =
1.70.
All tree-building methods resulted in recognition of five
clades, highly supported by bootstrap values and posterior probabilities (Figures 3 and 4): (clade I) Iranian haplotypes of R. hardwickii; (clade II) Middle Eastern and
north African haplotypes of R. hardwickii; (clade III) Yemeni haplotypes of R. muscatellum; (clade IV) Iranian haplotypes of R. muscatellum; and (clade V) haplotypes from
the two available specimens of R. microphyllum.

The Middle Eastern and north African haplotypes of R.
hardwickii (clade II) were subdivided into four geographic
regions: (a) the Levant (Jordan and Syria); (b) Yemen and
Socotra; (c) Upper Egypt; and (d) northern Libya. In contrast to the morphometric data that suggested considerable variation within that clade and support the
distinctness of its traditionally recognized subspecies (viz.
the large-sized R. h. arabium vs. the smaller R. h. cystops
from the Upper Egypt) the genetic data demonstrated an
unexpected homogeneity in clade II. A shallow but distinct divergence (p-distance = 3%) was found between the
North African haplotypes (c + d) and those from the

Levant and Yemen (a + b). No genetic difference was
found between (c) and (d), which represent the most distinct forms of the clade in terms of morphometry (Figs. 2,
3 and 4), and only 0.5% genetic distance was found
between (a) and (b), which are the most distant geographically. In contrast to the inner shallow cline of genetic variation, clade II is separated from the Iranian one (clade I)
by a relatively deep genetic gap (8–9%). Deep divergence
was also found within the R. muscatellum lineage. The
Yemeni haplotypes (clade III) and the haplotypes identified in Iran (clade IV) differ by a genetic distance of about
8–9%. Although the two available specimens of R. microphyllum (clade V) represented very distant geographic
regions (Levant vs. India) and the local forms have traditionally been considered to be distinct subspecies or even

separate species (R. microphyllum and R. kinneari), their
genetic distance was very small (0.5%).
Interestingly, reconstruction of the topology of deep
branches within the family using outgroup rooting
resulted in sister positions for R. microphyllum and R. muscatellum lineages (Figure 3). The molecular clock analysis
provided the minimum estimate of radiation of the family, i.e. the separation of the R. hardwickii lineage, to be
approximately 28.1 Ma. The next step, the splitting of the
R. microphyllum and R. muscatellum lineages, was dated
minimally to about 20.9 Ma. The split between clades I
and II happened about 14.1 Ma, and the split between
clades III and IV about 10.0 Ma.

Fossil record
We found a rich sample of fossil remains unquestionably
belonging to Rhinopoma sp. in a lithified infilling of a
limestone karst cavity in Elaiochoria (Chalkidiki, Greece).
The fauna indicates an early Turolian age, Late Miocene
(MN 10–11), some 8–10 Ma. The analysis of the record
[see Additional files 2 and 3] shows that: (i) the fossil
material contains the all the morphological features that
clearly distinguish Rhinopomatidae from other chiropteran families and, moreover, it falls within the variation
of the Recent forms of the genus; (ii) the morphology corresponds to the Recent Rhinopoma hardwickii in the fine

details of the dentition, in the shape of the distal epiphysis
of the humerus, and in the shape of the proximal epiphysis of the radius; and (iii) the fossil material shows relatively large size variation and seems to exceed the range of
variation in the Recent R. hardwickii, both in mean values
and in the highest values (comp. Figure 2).

Discussion
Even with the present analysis, the family Rhinopomatidae remains an enigmatic group whose history, taxonomic content, patterns of variation and phylogenetic
relationships are far of being properly comprehended.

Geographic
Geographic arrangements of parsimony networks connecting mtDNA haplotypes of bats from the genus
Rhinopoma within clades revealed by tree building methods. Numbers at the branches indicate number of mutational
steps. Dashed lines – the branches with minimum number of mutations between clades I and II and clades III and IV. The superimposition of the network in Iran, Yemen and Levant do not match geography exactly due to space limitations.

Nevertheless, the data summarized here substantially
improve the scarce information on these subjects. We will
discuss them in regard to (a) composition of the group,
(b) possible phylogeographic patterns and (c) evolutionary history.
Composition of Rhinopomatidae
The analysis of the family Rhinopomatidae by Van Cakenberghe and De Vree [9] demonstrated that the genus consists of four species that differ in the shape of the palatal
incision, the rostral ridges, the narial swellings, in the relative length of the tail, and in overall body size. The most
distinctive in all these characters was R. microphyllum,
whereas the differences between the remaining forms
were less pronounced, exhibiting a broad measure of
overlap in most metrical characters. Our analysis (n =
252) provided the same picture (Figure 2). All of these
data suggest that the major phenotypic divergence within
the genus is that between R. microphyllum (including R. m.
kinneari, R. m. sumatrae and R. m. asirensis) and the

remaining forms, which thought to be closely related to a
medium-sized species, R. hardwickii (Figure 2c), see [18].
Our mtDNA study confirmed the existence of the same
three deep lineages recognized as morphospecies by
Koopman [4], Hill [8] and Van Cakenberghe and De Vree
[9] (another recognized species, R. macinnesi, was not
included in our comparison). In addition, we found (i)
deep divergence within the R. hardwickii lineage, (ii)
incongruency between genetic and phenotypic phylogeographic patterns in clade II, (iii) deep divergence within
the R. muscatellum lineage, (iv) a very shallow distance
between the samples of R. microphyllum, suggesting an
unexpected genetic homogeneity of that species. Last but
not least, we demonstrated that (v) R. muscatellum
(including the Yemeni population) is not a sister group of
hardwickii, but of microphyllum. All these results contradict
the standard view of the taxonomic structure of the family
(Table 1), as well as of its distributional history [e.g.
[9,15]] and call for a brief comment.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:165

Phylogeographic patterns
(i) The genetic divergence found within R. hardwickii s.l.(=
the R. hardwickii clade) splits the corresponding morphospecies into an Iranian clade I (R. hardwickii s.s.) and AfroArabian clade II (R. cystops). While there is a clear genetic
continuity between the Levantine and Yemeni populations (e.g. haplotypes LE1, YE2, which are separated by
approximately 3,000 km, differ by only 1 mutation step),
the much smaller geographic distance between the Levantine and Iranian samples (approx. 1,200 km) is combined
with deep genetic dissimilarities (the minimum genetic
distance between haplotypes LE1 and IR3 is 34 mutation
steps). We expect the divergence between these two
groups represents real phylogeographic structure, a break
crossing the Middle East from the north-west to the southeast. The boundary might be situated along the southern
part of the Zagros Mountains, which represents a significant distribution barrier to many clades [17,19]. Unfortunately, knowledge of the distribution of bats in upper
Mesopotamia is too scarce [19] to allow further discussion. Thus, we are unable to answer whether there is continuous distribution of haplotype frequencies with a
clinal transition between geographic extremes, whether
there are two allopatric ranges separated by a distinct geographic gap, or whether the ranges meet at a distinct zone
of parapatry or sympatry. Because of the extent of the
genetic dissimilarity, we are rather skeptical about the first
alternative. Rather, we expect that clades I and II are entities separated at species level. We propose a separate species status for the two clades as per the genetic species
concept [20-22] which sets a cutoff based on empirical
data (cytochrome b in the order Chiroptera) of about 5%
of corrected sequence divergence [e.g. [23,24]]. These two
groups have almost double that divergence with 9% corrected divergence.

(ii) Within the clade II, a divergence of about 3% separates
African and Asian haplotypes of R. hardwickii. Within the
African group, our genetic data contradict the groupings
proposed by previous studies [see [8,9,17] and [25]],
which stress a separate status for the populations of the
central Sahara (including that of Upper Egypt). The
genetic relatedness of these small bats to the largest form
in Libya suggests an unexpected degree of phenotypic
plasticity in these bats, apparently driven by temporary
local conditions rather than by the genotypic backgrounds of the respective populations. Here, the selection
pressures of the extreme conditions of desert habitats may
have played a key role. A similar pattern of morphological
bimodality has been observed in other desert or semidesert species of bats [16,25,26], such as Taphozous nudiventris
Cretzschmar,
1830,
Rhinolophus
clivosus
Cretzschmar, 1828, Asellia tridens (Geoffroy, 1813), or
Pipistrellus kuhlii (Kuhl, 1817), and such an explanation
could be also invoked with respect to the smaller Arabian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/165

form, Rhinopoma microphyllum asiriensis Nader and Kock,
1983.
(iii) Our study has revealed that the morphospecies R.
muscatellum is composed of two distinct clades: clade III in
Yemen and clade IV in Iran and, supposedly, in Oman.
This split is supported by morphometric differences (Fig.
2). Recent allopatry is more obvious in this case because
clades III and IV are geographically isolated by the Arabian Desert. However, geographic positioning of major
genetic breaks in R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum lineages
coincides with this division (Fig. 4). With respect to the
genetic species concept, it is reasonable to consider species
status also for clades III and IV [for taxonomic rearrangements in the R. muscatellum lineage, see Additional file 1].
(iv) Considering the relatively deep genetic divergences
within the morphospecies R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum (in the sense of Van Cakenberghe and De Vree [9]),
the surprisingly low degree of geographic divergence of
mtDNA in R. microphyllum calls for a comment. At least
two qualities of this species are worth discussing in this
connection: (i) its larger body size, and (ii) the well-pronounced seasonality of its life cycle and reproduction,
including regular seasonal movements [e.g. [27]]. Both of
these factors may contribute to increases in vagility and
the rate of gene flow.
(v) The sister status of the R. microphyllum and R. muscatellum phylogroups contradicts traditional arrangements of
the family where R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum are considered as the most closely related taxa based on similarities in narial morphology and body size (Figure 2c)
[18,28]. The morphological polymorphism in genetically
uniform populations of R. cystops (clade II) and R. microphyllum (clade I) does, however, indicate that the body
size can undergo rapid rearrangement regardless whether
in reaction to environmental conditions or as a character
displacement due to interspecific interactions. Worth
mentioning in this context is the large body size of the fossil Rhinopoma aff. R. hardwickii, which clearly exceeds the
limits of the Recent R. hardwickii to which the fossil form
is linked by its morphological characters. All these cases
suggest that body size, traditionally applied as a significant character in taxonomy of the genus (because of considerable uniformity in other morphological characters) is
controlled by ecological factors rather than by a strict
taxon-specific developmental constraint.
Evolutionary history
The evolutionary history of Rhinopomatidae is a subject
of particular interest, one which makes the group one of
the most enigmatic clades of chiropterans. In the traditional view, Rhinopomatidae were regarded as the most
primitive group of extant bats, the closest to the common

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:165

ancestor of microbats and megabats [12,14]. Indeed,
compared to other families of Yangochiroptera and
Yinpterochiroptera, the family Rhinopomatidae exhibits a
set of unique plesiomorphies: (i) the trochiter of the
humerus (tuberculum minor) is small and does not permit the scapulo-humeral lock found in other bats; (ii) the
wing tip index has the lowest value of all Chiroptera; (iii)
medial phalanx of the second wing finger is complete and
well-ossified; (iv) the last cervical and first throracic vertebrae are free (not fused as in other bats); (v) individual
sacral vertebrae have distinct boundaries; (vi) the uropatagium is incomplete; (vii) the calcar is absent; (viii) tail is
long and mouse-like, not entirely integrated to the uropatagium; (ix) the premaxillae are not attached to each other
or to maxillae; and (x) the premaxillae are developed at
the palatal plane only. A few of these characteristics (i, iv,
vii) are shared with Craseonycteridae, while the others are
unique among both Yangochiroptera and Rhinolophoidea, partly resembling the condition in Pteropodidae (i,
iii, iv, v, vi, ix, partly vii, viii, x).
In contrast to the major clades of Yinpterochiroptera [cf.
[3,15]], Rhinolophidae (1 genus, ca. 77 species), Hipposideridae (9 genera, ca. 81 species), and Pteropodidae (42
genera, ca 184 species), the family Rhinopomatidae is
much less diversified [15]. In that respect it is similar to
Megadermatidae (4 genera, 5 species) and Craseonycteridae (1 genus, 1 species), which are the sister clades of Rhinopomatidae according to the recent molecular data [3].
The present paper dates the beginning of radiation of
extant clades of Rhinopomatidae (i.e. the separation of
the R. hardwickii clade), to about 29 Ma in the Oligocene.
Nevertheless, the datum is apparently not relevant for the
beginning of the family which arose with the earliest
divergence of Rhinolophoidea, which molecular clock
studies place at 50–55 My [3,7]in the Early Eocene. In
contrast to other groups of Rhinolophoidea, whose early
divergence is well represented in the fossil record, no such
information is available for Rhinopomatidae and Craseonycteridae. In contrast to Creaseonycteriae, Rhinopomatidae occupies quite a large range comparable to that of
other rhinolophoid families. At least for that reason, the
absence of fossil record is unusual and calls for comment,
at least as a background story to the discussion on meaning of the first Neogene record of the family reported in
this paper.
Despite the fact that the fossil record of bats is sometimes
regarded as being quite a poor [3], it is actually rich
enough to enable discussions on major differences in phylogeny and early paleobiogeography of particular chiropteran clades at least in Europe and northern Africa. The
remains of bats, including rich and taxonomically diversified assemblages, have been found in more than 130

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/165

European and North African sites of the Late Eocene, Oligocene and Early Miocene age [29-31] and current views
on the structure of chiropteran fauna and the history of
particular clades during that period [32] can be considered relevant and reliable. Among Rhinolophoidea, Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae are particularly rich in
their fossil record and, with a number of divergent clades,
they have predominated the fossil assemblages in Europe,
Africa, and even Australia since the Late Eocene [32-34].
In contrast, no relevant fossil record is available for Craseonycteridae or (until this paper) for Rhinopomatidae.
The situation with Megadermatidae is more intricate. The
first evidence of appearance of true Megaderma in Europe
comes from the Upper Oligocene (MP25 Carrascosa del
Campo, Spain [35]; MP29 Saint-Victor-la-Coste, France
[36]; MP 29 Herrlingen 9, Germany [37]) and a number
of further records are of Miocene and Pliocene age [37]. In
contrast to hipposiderids or nycterids, the family is absent
from African Oligocene sites (including Fayum or Taquah
in Oman [30,38] but appears in the Lower Miocene of
Thailand and even in Australia [39]. The Late Eocene to
Early Oligocene genus Necromantis, often regarded as a
megadermatid [31], differs from true megadermatids in
several characters (including basisphenoidal pits, a key
character of emballonurids, which is invariably absent in
rhinolophoids) and most probably does not belong to
that stock. The absence of Rhinopomatidae and the late
first appearance datum of Megadermatids in the fossil
record contrasts with the fact that other groups such as
Emballonuridae, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae s.l. are constant components
of the western Palaearctic and African fossil record since
the late Eocene [31,29,40]. All had already produced a
number of subclades during the Oligocene and Early
Miocene [32,37,41]. The absence of any rhinopomatids in
the fossil record is surprising because these bats differ
from all others in a number of conspicuous dental and
skeletal specificities by which they are easily distinguishable, even based on a single fragmentary tooth. Moreover,
rhinopomatids are cave-dwellers, which predisposes them
to be particularly common in the fossil record. Under
such conditions their absence in fossil record can be interpreted as a real fact which most probably reflects actual
absence of the group in the western Palaearctics prior to
the Miocene.
The fact that the phenotype of Rhinopomatidae (similarly
as in Craseonycteridae) is composed almost exclusively of
the ancestral characters not affected by adaptive rearrangements common in other chiropteran families, in contrast
to other chiropteran families [42], suggests that (i) the
clade was established at a very early stage of chiropteran
radiation (prior to the first appearances of modern families, in the Middle Eocene or earlier), and (ii) that rhinopomatids were relatively little affected by the same adaptive

Page 9 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:165

processes that affected other all bat families, which all
evolved under constant competitive pressure from other
microbat clades. The latter could happen only under conditions of long-term isolation of rhinopomatids from
other bats. An analogous case is the extinct clades of Palaeochiropterygidae and Hassianycteridae, which extensively diversified in Central Europe during geographic
isolation of that region in the Early and Middle Eocene
[43,44]. These endemic groups were radically replaced by
modern bat families soon after their invasion during the
Late Eocene "grand coupure" [33]. The respective modern
clades, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae, modern Emballonuridae, Vespertilionidae, Molossidae [comp. [29,31]],
arrived either from Africa and or Asia, and their early radiations most probably took place there (comp. also [3] for
molecular support to that hypothesis). The complete
absence of rhinopomatids in the fossil record and the lack
of coevolutionary influence on their phenotype suggest
that this group was absent in Europe and probably also in
Africa and Asia. Of course, Tanzanycterididae with Tanzanycteris mannardi from the Early Lutetian (46 Ma) of
Tanzania [45] may ultimately be shown to be closely
related to Rhinopomatidae. Unfortunately the characters
available in the specimen of Tanzanycteris provide only
tentative support for such a possibility (e.g. enlarged cochlea, a lack of scapulo-humeral lock which is, common to
all other Eocene bats).
The first appearance datum of Megadermatidae s. str. is
nearly synchronous with dramatic rearrangements of the
European mammalian fauna, with the appearance of the
Asiatic elements (e.g. Cricetidae) and a considerable contribution of non-mammalian taxa from the Indian and
Indomalaysian provinces such as Gavialosuchus, Tomistoma, and Varanidae. The spread of these taxa into Europe
has been dated to ca. 18 Ma [46]. Recent paleogeographic
analyses [47,48] supplement the picture with further data
that show continuity between the Mediterranean-Iranian
and the eastern Indian-east African marine provinces until
the final disappearance of the Western Tethyan seaway in
the Early Miocene.
In case of Rhinopomatidae, no such evidence is available.
The Late Miocene fossil record reported in this paper is
apparently not related to the early history of the clade.
Nevertheless, the results of molecular studies provide valuable information. The first dated split within the family
(R. hardwickii s.l. vs. R. microphyllum-muscatellum: 28.1
Ma) shows no phylogeographic signal – both clades are
broadly sympatric. Nevertheless, the next cladogenetic
events (R. microphyllum vs. R. muscatellum: 20.9 Ma) have
clear phylogeographic correlates. In the later events, the
phylogeographic signals are even more pronounced:
clades I vs. II (14.1 Ma): Iran vs. Levant to Africa, and
clades IV and III (10 Ma): Iran vs. Yemen. According to tra-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/165

ditional biogeography [49,50], the region with the largest
concentration of taxonomic diversity is the most likely
candidate for being the source area of the group in question. In the case of rhinopomatids, the present results
would suggest Iran to be such a candidate. At the very
least, these results suggest that Iran was an area of
paleoendemism that played host for the ancestral clades
more than 11 Ma ago. Nevertheless, the terrestrial conditions appeared in the respective region first at the time of
Oligocene/Miocene transition [51] and thus the source
area of the clades that colonized at in that time was apparently situated in other regions.
Based on the above discussion, we proposed the following
biogeographic hypothesis (Figure 5):
(i) Rhinopomatidae originated during the Eocene from
the early diversification of rhinolophoid bats that
remained isolated from competitive pressure of other chiropteran clades somewhere in the archipelago south of
the Western Tethyan seaway or in India.
(ii) The group evolved in isolation until the Oligocene
when the marine barrier between the Mediterranean and
Indian Tethys provinces disappeared. Endemic adaptation
to major chiropteran foraging strategies in ancient rhinolophoids produced clades whose ecomorphological design
was much different corresponding foraging specialists on
neighbouring continents. Some of those ancient clades
survive now: rhinopomatids as aerial foragers, craseonycterids as foragers of small prey in cluttered habitats, and
megadermatids as ground gleaners.
(iii) The land between Iran and western India, uplifted
during the Oligocene, was subsequently invaded by rhinopomatids and became the key location of their early
Neogene radiation. The westward invasion was from the
south, then to Arabia (which came in contact with the Iran
belt some 20 Ma ago) with the R. muscatellum lineage, and
perhaps later to the northern part of the Iran and to the
Mediterranean with the R. hardwickii lineage. The paleobiogeographic analyses of rodents [52] suggest that the
respective westward migrations may begun even much
earlier – in the late Eocene and early Oligocene via archipelagos south of the Western Tethyan seaway.
(iv) Extension of the paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental rearrangements of the Middle East during the
Vallesian and Turolian stage, ca. 11 Ma [compare with
[53-55]], fixed the already established divergences among
the clades within both R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum
lineages.
(v) The extension of the range of the large-sized Indian R.
microphyllum may have appeared quite late after these

influence of more pronounced seasonality in the climate
[53].

Conclusion
This first genetic study dealing with the family Rhinopomatidae has enabled us to put forward phylogenetic
hypotheses that differ considerably from the concepts
resulting of previous morphological studies. Contrary to
what was expected, we found deep allopatric genetic
divergences within the R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum
lineages, which suggests a separate species status for the
Afro-Arabian branch of R. hardwickii (i.e. R. cystops) and
for the Yemeni branch of R. muscatellum. In contrast, we
found a surprisingly high genetic homogeneity in R.
microphyllum (0.5% of genetic distance over 3,400 km of

geographic distance). Morphological polymorphism in
the genetically uniform R. cystops and R. microphyllum and
the characteristics of the fossil taxon suggests plasticity of
body size in this group. Considering information on the
Recent and past ranges and the genealogy of the group, we
expect that history of the family included (i) an early isolation in archipelago south of Western Tethyan seaway or
in India, (ii) a northward- and westward spread into Mediterranean after disappearance of the marine barrier in the
Late Oligocene and (iii) retreat from there after the
Miocene climatic optimum.

ined for morphometric analysis (n = 252) covered all parts
of the range (except East Asia), included nearly all nominal taxa, and included the holotypes of R. hardwickii Gray,
1831, R. lepsianum Peters, 1859, R. kinneari Wroughton,
1912, R. cystops Thomas, 1903, R. arabium Thomas, 1913,
R. muscatellum Thomas, 1903, R. seianum Thomas, 1913,
R. pusillum Thomas, 1920, and R. macinnesi Hayman,
1937. The molecular analyses were undertaken with 26
specimens representing three nominal species, namely R.
microphyllum, R. hardwickii, and R. muscatellum (Table 2,
column 1; Figure 1). Species identification followed the
criteria summarized by Van Cakenberghe and De Vree [9]
and Corbet and Hill [56], aided by direct comparisons
with other material included in morphometric comparisons. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the collections of the National Museum, and the Department of
Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, both
Prague, Czech Republic. Specimens were selected in order
to provide a reliable geographic and taxonomic coverage
of the range, and include the holotype material of R.
microphyllum, R. kinneari, R. cystops, R. arabium, and R.
pusillum. For further details concerning the specimens
(including the morphometrical data), see [16,17]. Fossils
reported in this paper are deposited in the collections of
Department of Zoology, Charles University in Prague [see
Additional file 2].
The present paper is the first molecular assay on taxonomy of Rhinopomatidae. All other studies on this group
(as well as a preliminary routine identification of our own
material) have been based on results of morphometric
comparisons. Rhinopomatid taxa have been traditionally
diagnosed by morphometric specificities, and distinguish
these morphology-based taxa from genetic grouping by
denoting them as "morphospecies".
Molecular analysis
We extracted total genomic DNA from ethanol-preserved
tissues and sequenced 402 bp of the 5'-end of the cytochrome b gene (according protocols published in [5]).
Accession nos. [GenBank: DQ337480 – DQ337502,
EF443165 – EF443167]. As multiple outgroup, we used
representatives of the clade Yinpterochiroptera Teeling et
al., 2005: Hipposideros bicolor [AF358131], Rhinolophus hipposideros [AF044660], Rousettus leschenaulti [AF044662]
and Epomophorus wahlbergi [AF044642].

The sequences were aligned by eye and the dataset was
processed in PAUP 4.0b10 [57]. We tested the cladistic
information content and saturation level [58] by saturation tests [59]. We have inferred the model of sequence
evolution in Modeltest 3.7 [60] using a hierarchical likelihood ratio test. The resulting model was used to correct
distances and for maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. We performed distance analyses to quantify genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/165

gaps within the clade. We computed pairwise p-distances
(Table 1, lower triangle, values used in the text to demonstrate genetic distances) and corrected distances among
ingroup haplotypes. We used GTR (model fitting best our
data according to Modeltest; Table 3, upper triangle) and
K2P (distance used in previous studies on bat species [e.g.
[23,24,61]]) corrections. The results of both corrected distance analyses were almost identical. The data were
ordered by computing trees using several approaches:
neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony (heuristic search
with 100 random-addition sequences and the TBR
branch-swapping algorithm; Figure 3a) and maximum
likelihood (Figrue 3b). For the Bayesian analysis (performed in MrBayes 3.1 [62]; Figure 3c) we used GTR + I +
G model, flat priors and random starting tree. We ran four
chains in MCMC analysis with 10,000,000 generations
and sampled trees every 100 generations. The stationary
was inspected via log probability plots and the convergence diagnostics for model parameters and burn-in was
used to discard first 1,000,000 generations. We repeated
the Bayesian run to test for convergence. The robustness of
the topologies obtained was tested by bootstrap using
1,000 replicates, and by computing posterior probabilities. We estimated the approximate dates of divergences
(Figure 3d) using the linearized tree approach [63]. The
difference in log-likelihoods (2 [log L -log Lclock], [64]) of
non-clock like (log L = -1867.36) and clock-like (logLclock
= -1884.45) trees compared against χ2 distribution (df =
Ntaxa - 2) was not significant at the 5% level (19.50), and
thus the molecular clock could not be rejected. Since there
is a lack of fossils that would be useful for calibration of
the tree within the family, we used a 37 Ma for Rhinolophus-Hipposideros split (37 Myr, [43,65]) to calibrate the
tree (since the age of the fossil represents the minimum
date of the fossil lineage occurrence, we provided estimates of minimum dates of divergences based on ML
branch lengths). Geographic arrangements of parsimony
networks were used to visualize phylogeographic pattern
among haplotypes (Figure 4). We visualize the branches
with minimum of mutational steps within clades revealed
by tree building methods. The shortest connection
between clades clades I and II and clades III and IV was
displayed to indicate phylogeographic breaks within traditional R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum.
