Abstract
Background: Aquaporins, also called major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), constitute an ancient
superfamily of channel proteins that facilitate the transport of water and small solutes across cell
membranes. MIPs are found in almost all living organisms and are particularly abundant in plants
where they form a divergent group of proteins able to transport a wide selection of substrates.
Results: Analyses of the whole genome of Physcomitrella patens resulted in the identification of 23
MIPs, belonging to seven different subfamilies, of which only five have been previously described.
Of the newly discovered subfamilies one was only identified in P. patens (Hybrid Intrinsic Protein,
HIP) whereas the other was found to be present in a wide variety of dicotyledonous plants and
forms a major previously unrecognized MIP subfamily (X Intrinsic Proteins, XIPs). Surprisingly also
some specific groups within subfamilies present in Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays could be
identified in P. patens.
Conclusion: Our results suggest an early diversification of MIPs resulting in a large number of
subfamilies already in primitive terrestrial plants. During the evolution of higher plants some of
these subfamilies were subsequently lost while the remaining subfamilies expanded and in some
cases diversified, resulting in the formation of more specialized groups within these subfamilies.

Background
Water transport across cell membranes is essential for life
and in order to facilitate the transport of water and other
small polar molecules across hydrophobic membranes,
living organisms have evolved a wide array of membrane
integral protein channels. These proteins, termed major
intrinsic proteins (MIPs), form a large and evolutionarily
conserved superfamily of channel proteins, found in all
types of organisms, including eubacteria, archaea, fungi,
animals and plants [1,2]. MIPs are present in many different tissues in mammals and are likely to be of major
importance for many different diseases [reviewed in [3]],

either directly or indirectly through their involvement in
transport and water balance regulation. This general physiological involvement of MIPs has stimulated a growing
interest in the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation and substrate specificity. In plants the functions of
MIPs are more complex and their physiological roles are
not as clear [reviewed in [4,5]]. However, the mere
number of different MIPs in plants implies their importance, and it is likely that some isoforms play key roles in
events such as rapid cell elongation and drought adaptation through their involvement in water transport regulation [6]. In order to fully understand whole plant water

relations and the transport of other small polar molecules
at a molecular level it is necessary to identify the complete
set of MIPs along with their substrate specificities and
expression patterns.

[31]. The difference in transport specificity is likely due to
major differences in the ar/R filter of plant MIPs, as has
been suggested for MIPs in A. thaliana, Z. mays and O.
sativa [32,33].

A comprehensive phylogenetic study of MIPs [7] supports
the classification of two main evolutionary groups.
Aquaporins (AQPs) originally thought to specifically
transport water, and glycerol-uptake facilitators or
aquaglyceroporins (GLPs) facilitating the transport of a
variety of small neutral molecules. Although the MIPs
form passive channels, the permeability of the membrane
is regulated by controlling the amount of different MIPs
and also in some cases by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the channels. Structures from x-ray and electron
crystallography of MIPs [8-14] show a tetrameric quaternary structure in which each monomer consists of six
membrane spanning helices (H1 to H6) connected by five
loops (A-E). Loop B (cytoplasmic) and loop E (extracellular) form two half-membrane spanning helices (HB and
HE) and interact with each other from opposing sides
through two highly conserved aspargine-proline-alanine
(NPA) boxes, forming a narrow region of the pore. A constriction region about 8 Å from the NPA boxes toward the
periplasmic side, termed the aromatic/arginine (ar/R)
region, is formed by two residues from H2 and H5 and
two residues from loop E. This region forms a primary
selection filter and is a major checkpoint for solute permeability [[15], and references therein].

P. patens is a moss (bryophyte) and as such diverged from
the lineage leading to higher plants approximately 443–
490 million years ago, before the evolution of vascular
plants [34]. This makes P. patens a valuable source of
information in evolutionary comparisons with higher
plants and any common features found can be expected to
be present in most terrestrial plants. In addition P. patens
has properties that make it an attractive plant model for
future functional studies, above all the possibility of
homologous recombination [information about the use
of P. patens can be found in two excellent reviews by David
Cove [35,36]]. An assembled genome of P. patens (circa
480 Mbp), based on 8.1 times coverage, has recently been
released by the Joint Genome Institute [37,38] and has
made it possible to extend the analysis of gene family evolution back to basal land plant lineages. Such an analysis
has previously been described for the expansin superfamily of proteins [39] and we now present a similar analysis of the MIP superfamily. In agreement with the
expansin study, we also hypothesised that P. patens were
to have a simpler superfamily structure due to less need of
cell-specific expression, a hypothesis that was partially
proven wrong by the data collected for P. patens. In our
analysis we did not only identify the five previously
defined subfamilies (PIP, TIP, NIP, SIP and GIP) but also
found two previously uncategorised MIP subfamilies; the
hybrid intrinsic proteins (HIPs) and the uncategorized X
intrinsic proteins (XIPs), a subfamily which we found also
to be present in many other plant species. This data
implies that MIP subfamilies evolved early on in plants
and that the existence of diverse subfamilies reflects differences in subcellular localisation, substrate specificity,
transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation
already of importance in primitive plants, whereas the
specificity needed only in higher plants (e.g. cell specific
expression in vascular tissue and seeds) is covered by the
MIP groups that evolved later within the subfamilies
present in higher plants.

Plant MIPs form a large and divergent superfamily of proteins with more than thirty identified members encoded
in each of the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana [16,17], Zea
mays [18] and Oryza sativa [19]. These large numbers of
MIPs likely reflect a wide diversity in substrate specificity,
localisation, transcriptional and posttranslational regulation. Based on sequence similarity plant MIPs have been
divided into five subfamilies; the plasma membrane
intrinsic proteins (PIPs), the tonoplast intrinsic proteins
(TIPs), the nodulin-26 like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), the
small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and the GlpF-like
intrinsic protein (GIPs) [7,16,20]. The GIPs have so far
only been identified in Physcomitrella patens and another
closely related moss [20]. Each of the other subfamilies
can be further divided into groups based on sequence similarity [16]. Even though all MIPs in higher plants phylogenetically belong to the AQP clade of MIPs [7] they are
not all highly specific for water. Several studies have
shown plant MIPs to be permeable also to other molecules, for example TIPs have been reported to facilitate
urea and ammonia transport [21-23]; NIPs to transport
glycerol [24], ammonia [25], lactic acid [26], boron [27]
and silicon [28]; PIPs have been postulated to be able to
facilitate CO2 diffusion [29,30] and for the SIPs water
transport has only been reported for the SIP1 subgroup

In this study we try to address plant MIP function from an
evolutionary perspective by comparing the whole set of
MIPs in a primitive land plant (the moss P. patens) with
those of two higher plants (A. thaliana and Z. mays). By
annotating the whole MIP superfamily in P. patens we also
lay the foundation for future functional studies in a plant
system allowing homologous recombination and all
advantages of this, such as knocking out/replacing endogenous genes.

Results
Identification of Physcomitrella patens MIPs
The recent sequencing of the moss P. patens genome
[37,38] has for the first time made it possible to identify
all MIP genes in a more primitive plant and hence to make
conclusions on the molecular evolution of the MIP superfamily of proteins. Searches of the Physcomitrella patens ssp
patens v1.1 database (PpDB) at JGI, using the 35 protein
sequences of the complete set of A. thaliana MIPs
(AtMIPs) [16], resulted in identification of 23 different

genes encoding P. patens MIPs (PpMIPs) (Table 1). Two
genes were identical at nucleotide level and therefore only
one protein sequence (PpPIP2;4), representing both
genes, was included in further analyses. PpGIP1;1, a P.
patens MIP previously described in detail by Gustavsson et
al [20] was also included in the PpMIP set which were
then reaching a total of 23 full length MIPs. Four genes
encoding partial MIP-like sequences were also identified.
Of these, three were either partial or contained premature
stop codons and therefore considered to be non-func-

tional pseudogenes (pseudoPIP#1, pseudoPIP#2 and
pseudoNIP#1). The fourth sequence might represent a
functional MIP encoding gene, but was situated in a short
contig interrupted by a large sequencing gap after the
identified exon and could therefore not be included in the
analysis (referred to as partialNIP#1). The JGI gene models were manually inspected and considered correct for
most PpMIP genes. However, for some genes a different
annotation of the coding sequence in the genomic
sequence was favoured either by cDNA sequences or due
to a better conservation of subfamily specific sequences
and gene structure. These alternative assignations of
exons, specified in Table 1, were used in all translations
and analyses in this paper.
When this study was initiated only 11 out of the 23
PpMIPs had been described in the literature [20,40]. Since
then one more of the 23 PpMIPs (PpPIP2;1) has been
published [41]. All 23 PpMIP sequences were categorized
as belonging to an aquaporin euKaryotic Orthologous
Groups (KOG) at the PpDB and most of these also had a
suggested classification (Table 1). Based on the phylogeny
of the PpMIPs together with the AtMIPs and Z. mays MIPs
(ZmMIPs) a new and more systematic classification of the
PpMIPs, that is consistent with the AtMIPs and ZmMIPs
nomenclature [16,18], is proposed (Table 1).
Phylogeny and classification
Using the full length protein alignments of all PpMIPs,
AtMIPs and ZmMIPs [see Additional file 1] the neighbour
joining (NJ) method resulted in one tree (Fig. 1) which
was compared to trees from the maximum parsimony
(MP) method and the Bayesian (Bay) method. Bootstrap
support and Bayesian posterior probabilities were used to
construct a "method-consensus" cladogram summarizing
the results of the three methods and used to classify the
PpMIPs (Fig. 2). The classification of AtMIPs and ZmMIPs
in subgroups within subfamilies is similar for all MIPs
except the NIPs. We named the PpNIPs according to the
nomenclature used in classification of the NIPs in Z. mays
and O. sativa since these four wider subgroups allow more
sequence divergence and hence are more generic than the
more narrow seven subgroups defined in A. thaliana. P.
patens subgroups that failed to group with the previously
classified subfamily groups were given consecutive higher
indices (e.g. PpPIP3, PpTIP6, PpNIP5 or PpNIP6). In total
3 PpPIP1s, 4 PpPIP2s, 1 PpPIP3, 4 PpTIP6s, 1 PpNIP3, 3
PpNIP5s, 1 PpNIP6 and 2 PpSIP1s were categorized. Four
PpMIPs failed to be classified into a subfamily, since they
lack orthologs among the MIPs identified in A. thaliana
and Z. mays. One of these was the MIP xenolog (homolog
resulting from horizontal gene transfer) PpGIP1;1 previously identified as a GlpF-like MIP and named accordingly [20]. The remaining three were the PpHIP1;1 which
shares similarities with both TIPs and PIPs but forms a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/45

separate distinct subfamily of its own, and the PpXIP1;1
and PpXIP1;2, two divergent MIPs that share some unique
previously undescribed motifs.
To find orthologs of the three uncategorized PpMIPs
(PpHIP1;1, PpXIP1;1 and PpXIP1;2) searches of databases at NCBI and embl were conducted. Hits representing a wide variety of species were selected and the
corresponding protein sequences were aligned with the
PpPIPs, the PpTIPs and either PpHIP1;1 or PpXIP1;1 and
PpXIP1;2. The alignments were used in phylogenetic analyses to evaluate if the newly acquired sequences could
help in categorizing the three PpMIPs. The PpHIP1;1 hits
were mainly annotated as TIPs or AQP4s in the databases
and the phylogenetic analysis resulted in three clusters
(PIPs, TIPs and AQP4s) but PpHIP1;1 were still basal to
all of these and could therefore not be assigned to any of
these subfamilies (data not shown). As for PpXIP1;1 and
PpXIP1;2, hits were mostly annotated as Plant MIP, TIP or
AQP0 sequences. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in
four different subfamilies, TIPs, PIPs AQP0s and a fourth
clade consisting of unspecified plant MIPs and the PpXIPs
(data not shown), see further analyses in next paragraph.
The XIPs – an unrecognized MIP subfamily in higher plants
Sequences belonging to this fourth clade have a weak
overall sequence similarity to MIPs in general (about 30 %
amino acid identity, data not shown), and could neither
be assigned to any of the previously identified classes of
plant MIPs (PIPs, TIPs, NIPs, SIPs and GIPs) nor be associated with the PpHIP1;1 sequence. However, some conserved motifs within this new subfamily (see discussion)
were identified and based on these one representative
sequence (the castor bean cDNA sequence [GenBank:EG656577]) was selected. This sequence was used in
database searches in order to obtain more MIPs belonging
to this novel subfamily. A handful of more sequences that
all shared the same conserved motifs were identified. One
of these sequences originated from Populus trichocarpa and
therefore the P. trichocarpa genome at JGI were searched,
identifying 4 more paralogs (Table 2). These sequences,
together with the sequences retrieved from the castor bean
cDNA and the PpXIP searches and all PpMIP sequences
(except PpHIP1;1) were combined into one sequence
alignment used in phylogenetic analysis. The resulting
trees confirmed that the unclassified MIPs form a distinct
monophyletic clade (with the PpXIPs as basal taxa), different from the other MIPs included in the analysis (Fig.
3). As shown in Table 3 there is considerable variation
both at the first NPA box and the ar/R filter among the
sequences in this clade. We propose that, awaiting further
characterization, MIPs in the new subfamily should be
referred to as X Intrinsic Proteins (XIPs) emphasizing that
currently we have very little information on the function
of these proteins.

Evolutionary relationship of plant MIPs
Evolutionary relationship of plant MIPs. An unrooted neighbour-joining tree showing the phylogenetic comparison of the
complete set of 23 different MIPs from P. patens (Pp) in bold and the 35 respectively 33 MIPs from A. thaliana (At) and Z. mays
(Zm). The seven subfamilies found in P. patens are indicated with the same colours as in Fig. 6. Note that the XIP, HIP and GIP
have not been found in A. thaliana or Z. mays. The bar indicates the mean distance of 0.1 changes per amino acid residue.

Gene structure
The average PpMIP was found to have 2.6 introns with a
size of 246.4 bp. This is about half the number of introns,
but of approximately the same size as predicted for the
average P. patens gene in a genome wide analysis [42]. The
exon/intron patterns of the PpMIPs were found to be
highly conserved within each subfamily, as shown in Figure 4. Comparison with the AtMIPs showed the intron
positions to be conserved for both PIPs and NIPs, but not
for TIPs (in P. patens the intron position is 35 base pairs

further to the 5'-end) and SIPs (completely lacking introns
in P. patens). The exon/intron pattern also supported that
the PpHIP and the PpXIPs were to be classified neither as
PIPs, TIPs, NIPs, SIPs nor GIPs, but rather as separate subfamilies on their own.
The identification of five P. trichocarpa XIP paralogs
allowed comparison of gene structure across species. All
five P. trichocarpa genes have the same pattern of exonintrons with two introns in the N-terminal sequence (data

the N-termini have a high degree of interspecies variation
it is hard to make any conclusion on whether the intron

Discussion
Physcomitrella patens Major Intrinsic Proteins
Comparison of protein superfamilies of distantly related
species can aid in our understanding of protein function
and by annotating all MIPs in P. patens we have made such
a comparison possible for the MIP superfamily of higher
plants and mosses. Originally we hypothesised that
mosses were to have a relatively small superfamily, due to
them being simpler (for example lacking vascular tissue
and therefore having a less complex water transport regulation). It was therefore much to our surprise that we
found P. patens to have seven subfamilies containing in
total 23 different MIPs, an unexpected large and divergent
superfamily. One of these (PpGIP1;1) is analysed in detail
by Gustavsson et al. [20], and is therefore omitted from
this discussion. Half of the remaining 22 PpMIPs are previously described by Borstlap [40] and Lienard et al. [41]
and the remaining 11 are previously not described in the
literature. The gene structure of the PpMIPs supports the
phylogenetic analyses and the resulting division into
seven subfamilies. Comparison with AtMIPs shows that
PIPs and NIPs have conserved intron positions whereas
SIPs and TIPs do not. This is consistent with the conservation of individual groups of the NIP and PIP subfamily in
both P. patens and A. thaliana (discussed further below).

PIPs – the most conserved MIPs in plants
PIPs are remarkably well conserved plant MIPs that can be
further classified into PIP1s and PIP2s. Both PIP1s and
PIP2s are highly conserved in P. patens indicating that
these groups must have formed early on in the evolution
of land plants and are of fundamental importance in plant
physiology. The physiological relevance of PIP1s and
PIP2s in water relations in higher plants is well established and recently also carbon dioxide has been added to
the list of possible substrates [reviewed in [4]]. The ar/R
filter is strictly conserved in PIPs including PpPIPs suggesting that all PIPs, irrespectively of subgroup, have the
same substrate specificity (Table 3). It is likely that the
evolution of PIP sequences is constrained also in many
other ways. For example the PIPs reside in the plasma
membrane and it is essential that they are impermeable
for protons in order to maintain the proton gradient. Furthermore, the water permeability of PIPs can be regulated
by phosphorylations, pH and Ca2+ via an intricate gating
mechanism [11]. From our results presented here it is
clear that the diacidic motif in the N-terminal region and
the histidine in the D-loop responsible for Ca2+ binding
and pH gating, respectively, are both conserved in all
PpPIP1s and PpPIP2s. The phosphorylation site in loop B
is also conserved in all PpPIPs whereas the PIP2 specific Cterminal phosphorylation motif is restricted to the
PpPIP2s. This suggests that the gating mechanism is
generic in all species and tissues where PIPs are expressed
and that for instance pH gating is not limited to anaerobic
conditions in roots of higher plants.

[GenBank:AJ314583] were used.

In P. patens there is also an odd PIP (PpPIP3;1), basal to
both PIP1s and PIP2s. The PpPIP3;1 has a deletion of 11
amino acids after the second NPA-box (between helix E
and helix 6) and this, together with the relatively high
divergence from other PIPs (e.g. lack of the Ca2+ binding
site at the N terminal region and a conserved cysteine at
helix 2) and the absence of ESTs, makes it questionable if
this MIP gene is at all functional.
TIPs specialization occurred later
It has already been suggested that P. patens is lacking the
specific isoforms of TIPs observed in higher plants [40]

confirmed. Interestingly, it has been proposed that vacuole sub-types harbor specific sets of TIP isoforms [43] and
it is easy to speculate that the TIP groups in higher plants
evolved due to special functional requirements of different vacuoles. The identification of conserved proteins in
P. patens, involved in the sorting of proteins to different
types of vacuoles, suggests that there are most likely more
than one type of vacuole in bryophytes [44]. This implies
that TIPs are not conserved markers for subtypes of vacu-

a The ar/R filter is defined by four amino acid residues: one in helix 2, one in helix 5 and two in loop E b The PpMIPs are identified with their
proposed names and the other MIPs are identified by their GenBank accession numbers c Alternative residue at H5 position due to alignment of
conserved glycines in helix 5, however this also introduces two extra amino acids between helix 5 and the second NPA box

oles as the presence of only one group of TIPs in P. patens
indicates that either there is only one of the vacuole types
in moss that has TIPs, or alternatively several different vacuoles in the moss cell all have the same type of TIPs. Both
interpretations are consistent with recent experiments in
higher plants that have challenged the idea of TIPs as valid
markers for vacuole sub-types [45,46].

and that the other motifs found at these positions are
derived characters that have appeared later as different
groups of TIPs evolved in vascular plants. The expansion
and formation of specialized groups in the TIP subfamily
of higher plants might suggest that some of these TIPs
have taken over the functions of the MIPs of subfamilies
that are missing in higher plants (e.g. HIPs and XIPs).

Rather than forming a very distant subclass of TIPs, the
PpTIP6s appears as a conserved mosaic of the different
motifs that are found in the different TIP groups of higher
plants. For example the first few amino acid residues at the
N-terminus are similar to TIP2s, whereas the C-terminal
region is most similar to TIP3s. The identities of the
amino acid residues at the ar/R filter (HIAR) are shared
with both some TIP3s and TIP4s suggesting a similar specificity. In fact exactly these residues are the most common, comparing the frequencies in the selectivity regions
of all A. thaliana, Z. mays and O. sativa TIPs
(H0.81I0.62A0.72R0.75; based on Table 4 in [47]). This makes
it likely that PpTIP6s are similar to the TIPs present in the
last common ancestor of bryophytes and vascular plants

NIP groups evolved early
In higher plants NIPs form a divergent subfamily with
large variation between species. This is true also for NIPs
in P. patens, but surprisingly one of the three NIP groups
identified is present also in higher plants, indicating that
this group of NIPs, NIP3, was present already in a common ancestor to P. patens and higher plants (Fig. 2). The
conserved intron positions among NIPs in A. thaliana and
P. patens indicate that this gene structure was also present
in the ancestral NIP gene. NIPs are different from other
MIPs in that they often have unorthodox NPA boxes. In
many NIP3s of higher plants the first and second NPA
boxes are replaced by NPS and NPV, respectively [47]. The
corresponding motifs in PpNIP3;1 are NPA and NPV

(Table 3), which is identical to AtNIP6;1 (one of the two
NIP3s in A. thaliana according to the monocot classification), suggesting that NIP3s had these motifs before the
split of bryophytes and vascular plants.
The two NIP groups specific for P. patens (PpNIP5 and
PpNIP6), have a unique combination of amino acids at
the ar/R filter (Table 3). In contrast the ar/R region of
PpNIP3;1 conforms to the residues found in other NIP3s,
supporting that they are orthologs with the same conserved function. Recently a NIP3 have been shown to have
a role in boron uptake in roots of A. thaliana [27] and even
though mosses lack roots it cannot be ruled out that
PpNIP3;1 has a role in boron transport in the moss.
The N-terminal region of NIPs is relatively long compared
to most other plant MIPs and is encoded on a separate
exon. Due to the lack of generally conserved motifs in this
region the first exon is often missing in annotations of
NIP genes. However, within NIP3s of higher plants several
motifs have been recognized in the N-terminal region [48]
and some of these features are also conserved in
PpNIP3;1. Similar to higher plants PpNIP3;1 has a high
degree of proline and threonine residues and a sequence
(AKCFP), corresponding to the conserved motif (C [KN]C
[LF] [PS]) in higher plants.
Many NIPs in higher plants have a conserved potential
phosphorylation motif in the C-terminal region corresponding to the phosphorylation site in Glycine max
NOD26 (GmNOD26, S262) and Spinacia oleracea PIP2;1
(SoPIP2;1; S274) [5,49]. A serine at this position is also
present in a similar motif in NIP3s of higher plants
([RK]XXRSFXR) [48] but not in PpNIP3;1 where the serine is substituted to a valine. In PpNIP5;3 and PpNIP6;1
there are serines but some of the basic residues in the
motif are not conserved. In contrast a corresponding serine in the motif (KXXKSF [HR]R) is present in PpNIP5;1
and PpNIP5;2 suggesting that at least some NIPs in a common ancestor of bryophytes and higher plants were regulated by phosphorylation.
It is interesting to see that there is no NIP2 type of MIP in
P. patens, a NIP-group recently identified as a silicon transporter in rice [28]. Since bryophytes are known to accumulate silicon [50], the lack of PpNIP2s suggests that this
function is carried out by a different isoform or class of
proteins in P. patens.
Only SIP1s are found in Physcomitrella patens
In A. thaliana there are two classes of SIPs, SIP1s and
SIP2s, both having the same gene structure with two
introns at conserved positions [16]. In P. patens there are
two SIPs but neither of them has an intron. Surprisingly
both of the PpSIPs belong to the SIP1 group whereas

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/45

SIP2s of higher plants form a basal clade. This suggests
that either SIP2s were present already in early land plants
but were subsequently lost in P. patens in which the
remaining SIP1s were subject to intron loss, or that SIP2s
have rapidly diverged from SIP1s after the split leading to
mosses and higher plants. An intron loss in PpSIP1s or an
intron gain in a common ancestor to SIP1s and SIP2s in
higher plant is equally likely in this scenario. In most
SIP1s the corresponding sequence to the first NPA box is
NPT, interestingly this unusual motif is conserved also in
PpSIP1s, implying that this is a structurally and functionally important feature of SIP1s. In addition the ar/R filter
is consistent with the phylogenetic classification, suggesting a conserved function of SIP1s among terrestrial plants.
HIP a unique MIP with similarities to both PIPs and TIPs
There are three P. patens MIP sequences that cannot be
classified into any of the five subfamilies previously
described in plants [16,20]. One of these, the PpHIP1;1,
seems to be a rather rare MIP, since we were not able to
identify any orthologs. The unique gene structure indicates that this protein belongs to a separate subfamily. In
phylogenetic analyses PpHIP1;1 tend to cluster with PIPs
and TIPs, although the support for this is not very strong
as seen in Figure 2. Upon looking at the ar/R filter (Table
3) one could also speculate that the HIP is related to TIPs
and PIPs, since it has histidines both at the H2 position,
typical for TIPs and the H5 position, typical for PIPs. What
effect having two large and basic amino acid residues in
the filter will have on transport properties is however
unclear, and since there are no ESTs of the gene it might
even be that it is not expressed. According to a subcellular
localization prediction (WoLF PSORT [51], data not
shown) PpHIP1;1 is slightly more likely to reside in the
tonoplast than the plasma membrane. Further studies are
required to explore expression, localization and substrate
specificity of the PpHIP.

The two other sequences belong to another group, the
XIPs, further discussed in the next paragraph.
The XIP subfamily
A search for PpXIP orthologs resulted in the finding of
many XIP sequences from a wide variety of species,
including five paralogs from P. trichocarpa (probably the
same five described as "putative aquaporins lacking in the
Arabidopsis" by Tuskan et al. [52]). It is striking that no
sequences are from monocots. Although most sequences
were from dicots, no ortholog was found in A. thaliana,
which may be explained by gene loss due to a relatively
recent reduction of the genome size [53]. Phylogenetic
analyses confirmed that these sequences are from a, to our
knowledge, previously unrecognized MIP subfamily, different from PIPs, TIPs, NIPs, SIPs and GIPs. The only nonplant sequence included in the analyses was a protein

Page 10 of 15

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:45

encoded by the [GenBank:XM_639170] gene from the
amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum AX4 and it should be
pointed out that although this protein is clustering with
the XIPs in phylogenetic analyses, it is annotated as a
hypothetical protein and lacks some of the characteristics
of the XIPs. For example the amoeba protein has NPA
boxes and an ar/R filter different from all other XIPs and
also an overall highly divergent MIP sequence, all which
makes it questionable if this protein has the same function as other XIPs. There is also a sequence from a lycophyte, the spike moss Selaginella moellendorffii, which
together with the two PpXIPs are the three most divergent
sequences albeit all three are clearly categorisable as XIPs.
Although most sequences were derived from ESTs, no general conclusion could be made on expression pattern,
since XIP transcripts were isolated from many different tissues ranging from roots, seedlings, flower buds to seeds
and fruits (Table 2). Based on a subcellular localization
prediction XIPs are likely to be situated in the plasma
membrane (WoLF PSORT [51], data not shown).
In the first NPA box of the XIPs, the alanine is replaced by
a valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine or cysteine. All of these
replacements, except isoleucine, have been observed in
NPA boxes of other MIPs [47]. The most conserved feature
of the new subfamily is located after the second NPA box,
where a cysteine amino acid is thoroughly conserved in
the motif NPARC. This cysteine is only a moderate change
of the conserved serine or threonine found in many other
subfamilies e.g. PIPs, TIPs, NIPs and in several mammalian AQPs. However, from the solved structure of
SoPIP2;1 it is clear that residues at this position can stabilize the conformation of the C-loop by hydrogen bonds
([PDB:1Z98];S226 – N153, see Fig. 5) an interaction that
seem to be structurally conserved and that also can be
seen in BtAQP1 ([PDB:1J4N]; S198 – N129), BtAQP0
([PDB:1YMG];S188 - N119) and, with the donor-acceptor
interchanged, in EcGlpF ([PDB:1FX8];D207 - T137). This
stabilisation is probably directly affecting the permeability of the pore since the orientation of the arginine of the
ar/R filter is also stabilised by a hydrogen bond to the
backbone of the C-loop (Fig. 5). Interestingly all the XIPs
also have a conserved cysteine resulting in the motif
LGGC in the C-loop at a position that can be aligned to
N153 in SoPIP2;1. This suggests that a cysteine bridge
may covalently fixate the C-loop relative to the arginine in
the XIPs and that the extracellular entrance to the pore
therefore might be more rigid than that of other MIPs.
There is also a highly conserved motif with a proline at the
end of helix 2, 7 amino acids before the first NPA-box
(PISGGHINP), also found in mammalian AQP5s. A corresponding motif can be found in helix 5 of many other
plant MIPs, which is interesting as this reflects the symmetry of the MIP proteins, consisting of two direct repeats of

sequence. It is also worth noting that, with the exception
of PpXIPs, there is a lack of an otherwise highly conserved
glycine in helix 5, allowing the close packing of helix 2
and 5 [54], which in most XIPs is replaced by either a leucine or an isoleucine. An alternative alignment that retains
the conserved glycine, but introduces two extra amino
acids between helix 5 and the second NPA box is possible,
but not used in the analysis presented here. This alignment will also affect which amino acid is positioned in the
H5 position of the ar/R filter (Table 3). In the chosen
alignment a valine is the most frequent residue in the H5
position and in the alternative alignment threonine
would be in the H5 position. At the H2 position most
XIPs have an aliphatic amino acid, something that can
also be found in some NIPs and SIPs [47]. This suggests
that XIPs are not primarily water channels, although substrate specificity experiments have to be carried out to
establish this. In the XIPs from P. patens and S. moellendorffii there is a glutamine at the H2 respectively H5 position of the ar/R filter, also found in TIP4s and TIP5s of
higher plants, suggesting that maybe these TIPs have taken
over some function of the XIPs in primitive plants. Further
studies of localization, specificity and expression patterns
are needed in order to determine the function of this
novel MIP subfamily.

Conclusion

Methods

In this study we identified a surprisingly large number of
MIP encoding genes in P. patens, forming a diverse superfamily with seven subfamilies. In total 23 PpMIPs were
identified; eight PIPs, four TIPs, five NIPs and two SIPs,
one GIP and three MIPs belonging to two different, novel
subfamilies, the HIPs and the XIPs. HIPs are hitherto not
found in any higher plants, whereas the XIPs seem to be
present in many plant species, although not in monocots.
Interestingly, specific groups within the subfamilies, like
PIP1s, PIP2s, NIP3s and possibly SIP1s were already
present in a common ancestor of higher plants and bryophytes. In contrast, the subgroups of TIPs probably
evolved later. These results suggest that early land plants
had a large and divergent MIP superfamily consisting of at
least the seven subfamilies found in P. patens and that during the evolution of higher plants some subfamilies were
lost (Fig. 6) whereas remaining subfamilies evolved further resulting in diversification and formation of subgroups within the subfamilies. We speculate that some of
the new subgroups, or perhaps some other unrelated
transporters have taken over the function of the lost MIP
subfamilies in higher plants.

Gene identification and annotation
Physcomitrella patens MIP genes were identified by
TBLASTN searches of the PpDB at the Joint Genome Institute [37] using the protein sequences of the complete set
of 35 MIPs from Arabidopsis thaliana as queries [16]. Gene
models overlapping with hits were manually inspected
and kept based on subfamily sequence similarity or EST
support. If no satisfying model existed, the genomic
sequence was used to identify exons for the new or modified model (as specified in Table 1). The PpGIP1;1
sequence was also added to the sequences since it was previously identified as a PpMIP [20]. Protein sequences corresponding to the translation of the PpMIP genes were
used in a second round of TBLASTN searches to identify
more divergent MIP sequences in PpDB, but none were
found. The resulting 23 PpMIPs were used in a multiple
alignment of translated sequences, together with the 35
AtMIP and 33 ZmMIPs [18]. Alignments were manually
inspected and adjusted and care was taken to keep the
number of gaps low and to avoid gaps in functionally
important features, such as the NPA-boxes and transmembrane regions. The alignment that forms the basis for all
the phylogenetic analysis regarding the PpMIPs presented
here is available as ALIGN_001168 in the EMBL-align
database (which can be accessed either via the EMBL-EBI
SRS homepage [55] or FTP [56]).

the MIP superfamily in plants. The ancestral plant is proposed
to have had all seven subfamilies of MIPs found in extant
mosses. The GIP and HIP were lost during the evolution of
higher plants and subsequently the XIP subfamily was lost in
monocots.

Orthologs of the unclassified PpHIP, PpXIP1;1 and
PpXIP1;2 were searched for by TFASTX3 searches of the
EMBL nucleotide sequence database [57] and TBLASTN
searches of the nr/nt, est, gss and htgs databases at NCBI
[58] using the translated sequence of the three PpMIPs.
Translations representing hits from a wide variety of species were used in protein alignments together with either
PpHIP1;1 or PpXIP1;1 and PpXIP1;2 and the PpPIPs and
PpTIPs. The alignments were manually inspected and
adjusted as mentioned above and used for phylogenetic
analysis of PpHIP1;1 and the PpXIPs and are available in
the EMBL-align database as ALIGN_001169 respectively
ALIGN_001170.
The translated sequence of one of the PpXIP orthologs
found [GenBank:EG656577] was used in additional
TBLASTN searches of the nr/nt, est, gss and htgs databases
at NCBI in order to find more homologs of this group.
One ortholog found was from Populus trichocarpa and a
translation of this sequence was used in a TBLASTN search
of the P. trichocarpa genome at JGI to find paralogs. These
paralogs together with a selection of homologs from the
[GenBank:EG656577] and PpXIP searches were used in a
multiple sequence alignment of translated sequences
together with 22 PpMIPs (all except the PpHIP). The
alignment was manually inspected and adjusted in the
same manner as the PpMIP-AtMIP-ZmMIP alignment.

This alignment forms the basis for all the phylogenetic

ter motives. This proves that the HIP subfamily is indeed
a novel conserved subfamily of MIPs and not an anomaly
only found in Physcomitrella patens.

Phylogenetic analysis
The PpMIP sequence alignment was analyzed by three different phylogenetic methods, Neighbour Joining (NJ),
Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (Bay).
For all methods, gaps were treated as missing data.
PAUP*4.0b10 [59] was used for the NJ and MP analysis.
The default settings were used for both methods and bootstrapping with one thousand replicates for each method
assessed the confidence of the best trees. Bayesian phylogenetic inferences were conducted using MrBayes 3.0.2
[60] using vague or uninformative prior probability distributions of the likelihood model under the JTT [61] +I+Γ
model. Two sets of four parallel Metropolis Coupled
Monte Carlo Markov Chains, of which three were heated
with 0.2 temperature increments, were run for 2 million
generations starting from random trees. Each 100th tree
was sampled. The first 25 % of sampled trees was discarded as burn in, and stationary phase was empirically
determined by looking at the likelihood scores of the kept
samples. Robustness of the inferred tree was evaluated
using Bayesian posterior probabilities. A "method consensus" tree was constructed as an overview, in this tree only
branches that had a bootstrap or posterior probability
support of more than 50 % in at least two of the methods
were kept and all other were collapsed.

Additional material

For the PpHIP1;1, PpXIPs and XIP-group alignments,
PAUP*4.0b10 [59] was used for a NJ and MP analysis
(gaps treated as missing data). The default settings were
used for both methods and for the XIP-group alignment
analysis, bootstrapping with one thousand replicates for
each method assessed the confidence of the best trees. All
trees from the PpMIP, PpHIP, PpXIPs and XIP family analyses are available in nexus format for viewing in Tree-View
[62] [see Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14].

Note added in proof
During the publication of this work we successfully identified the HIP subfamily of MIPs in the spike moss Selaginella moellendorffii. PpHIP1;1 and the closest homolog in
S. moellendorffii are highly similar (with 73.7 % amino
acid identity) and have the same NPA-boxes and ar/R fil-
