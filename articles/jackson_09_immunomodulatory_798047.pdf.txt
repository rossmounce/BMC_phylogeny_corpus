Abstract
Background: Immunological analyses of wild populations can increase our understanding of how
vertebrate immune systems respond to 'natural' levels of exposure to diverse infections. A major
recent advance in immunology has been the recognition of the central role of phylogenetically
conserved toll-like receptors in triggering innate immunity and the subsequent recruitment of
adaptive response programmes. We studied the cross-sectional associations between individual
levels of systemic toll-like receptor-mediated tumour necrosis factor alpha responsiveness and
macro- and microparasite infections in a natural wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) population.
Results: Amongst a diverse group of macroparasites, only levels of the nematode Heligmosomoides
polygyrus and the louse Polyplax serrata were correlated (negatively) with innate immune
responsiveness (measured by splenocyte tumour necrosis factor alpha responses to a panel of tolllike receptor agonists). Polyplax serrata infection explained a strikingly high proportion of the total
variation in innate responses. Contrastingly, faecal oocyst count in microparasitic Eimeria spp. was
positively associated with innate immune responsiveness, most significantly for the endosomal
receptors TLR7 and TLR9.
Conclusion: Analogy with relevant laboratory models suggests the underlying causality for the
observed patterns may be parasite-driven immunomodulatory effects on the host. A subset of
immunomodulatory parasite species could thus have a key role in structuring other infections in
natural vertebrate populations by affecting the 'upstream' innate mediators, like toll-like receptors,
that are important in initiating immunity. Furthermore, the magnitude of the present result suggests
that populations free from immunosuppressive parasites may exist at 'unnaturally' elevated levels
of innate immune activation, perhaps leading to an increased risk of immunopathology.

Background
Natural vertebrate populations are chronically exposed to
multiple infections and experience a range of environmental stressors. The vertebrate immune system will have
evolved in ancestral populations subject to these pressures. Given that our understanding of mammalian
immunology is largely based on rodents reared under
highly unnatural pathogen- and stress-free conditions,
analysing immune responses in wild populations may
give crucial insights into how the immune system functions in its natural context. There may be fundamental
implications for how we understand immunological dysfunction observed in modern humans. Across recent generations, humans in developed countries, much like
laboratory mouse strains, have been exposed to a very different profile of infections to that encountered by their
ancestors. At the same time there is evidence of a continuing breakdown of immune regulation in humans in
industrialised societies, manifested by increases in allergic
[1] and autoimmune disorders [2]. A putative functional
link between reduced infection exposure and immune
hyperactivity in human populations (the 'hygiene
hypothesis') has long been proposed [3]. A more recent
refinement of this idea is that metazoan infections may
lead to the healthy development of immunoregulatory
networks due to their ability to stimulate expansions of
regulatory T-cells [4]. The evolutionary basis for this is
that strong immunomodulatory stimuli from metazoan
parasites have been a constant presence during vertebrate
history, and that the immune system is now maladapted
to a situation where these organisms are absent [5]. This is
consistent with the considerable evidence that helminth
infections of humans stimulate immunosuppressive
effects and increased T-regulatory activity [6-9]. However,
support for the evolutionary role of parasite-induced
immunoregulation would be strengthened if immune
suppression by metazoan parasites could be shown to
also be a general phenomenon in wild vertebrate populations. Studies in wildlife systems might also give greater
insight into the range of parasitic organisms involved and
the ecological context in which immunosuppression
occurs.
The analysis of immune responses in wildlife has been
hindered by a lack of specific reagents for the measurement of immunological molecules in non-model organisms [10]. Here we take advantage of conservation in the
murine pro-inflammatory signalling molecule tumour
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) to develop a novel assay of
innate toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune responsiveness in a wild rodent population. TLRs are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect conserved molecular
patterns associated with certain types of pathogenic
organism or with endogenous 'danger' signals [11]. Currently, TLRs are thought to be the most important family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/16

of PRRs in initiating innate immunity and the activation
of antigen presenting cells that trigger adaptive responses.
Their central role in the immune system gives a number of
potential advantages in assays which seek to provide an
overall measure of immune function. As there is a diversity of TLRs [12] with differing ligand specificities,
responses for a panel of different receptor-ligand combinations may give indications of immune responsiveness
towards a broad range of infections. In addition to triggering and influencing the phenotypic trajectory of innate
and adaptive immunity, TLR responses are also themselves influenced by signals from many other elements of
the immune system, including signals from regulatory
adaptive responses [13]. The assay that we describe below
may therefore offer a relatively holistic index of overall
immune activation.
We used this assay of innate immune responses to analyse
a cross-sectional natural population sample of the wood
mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, in the UK and test hypotheses
of covariation between innate immune activation, parasitic infection and other host variables. On the basis of our
results we suggest that a subset of metazoan parasites can
have strong suppressive effects on innate immunity that
over-ride effects due to individual body condition or
reproductive status.

Results
TLR-response profile
We measured ex vivo TNF-α accumulations in splenocyte
cultures exposed to a panel of defined ligands for TLRs 2,
4, 5, 7 and 9 (Table 1). For each animal these stimulatory
assays provided a profile of pro-inflammatory responses
mediated by individual TLRs that might reflect the underlying phenotype of innate immune activation. Great interindividual variability in responsiveness was detected (Figure 1). Across the sample of 100 A. sylvaticus, the strongest
mean responses were against ligands for TLR2 and TLR9,
for which most (>90%) individuals showed above-control responses. Above-control responses were seen against
TLR 4, 5 and 7 ligands (Figure 1) in, respectively, 47, 39
and 51% of all individuals. For all TLR ligands examined,
TNF-α production was significantly elevated in treated
compared with control splenocytes at the level of the
entire sample of A. sylvaticus (Sign tests, P < 0.0005).
Positive covariation amongst TLR-mediated responses
Amongst individual A. sylvaticus there was strong positive
intercorrelation between responses mediated through different TLRs (Figure 2). The first component (P < 0.001)
extracted from a principal components analysis (PCA) of
the six TLR-response variables showed large coefficients of
the same sign and accounted for 48% of total variation.
Pairwise Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) for individual variables were also all positive and highly signifi-

cant (P < 0.0005, or P = 0.001 in the case of TLR2 versus
TLR7 responses), with rs of between 0.29 and 0.68. These
significant positive relationships were maintained when
pairwise relationships between TLR-response variables
were examined in linear mixed models in which the fixed
model component was used to account for confounder
variables and the random model component was used to
account for data non-independence introduced by the
immunological assaying procedures (see Methods) (not
shown).
Parasite community structure
Quantitative infection variables are summarised in Figure
3. Correlational structure amongst these was relatively
weak and mainly linked to host size. The first component
from a PCA analysis (PC1p) of the common species,
although highly significant (P = 0.001), only explained
20% of total variation. PC1p was dominated by large coefficients of the same sign for Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Calodium hepaticum and Polyplax serrata (Figure 4A),
indicating a pattern of positive covariation between these
species. To a lesser extent, a moderate negative coefficient

for Eimeria faecal oocyst count (FOC) indicated a tendency for Eimeria spp. fecundity to covary negatively.
However, when pairwise species associations were
assessed by non-parametric correlation coefficients, there
were only significant positive relationships between H.
polygyrus and C. hepaticum (P = 0.001), H. polygyrus and P.
serrata (P = 0.037) and C. hepaticum and P. serrata (P <
0.0005). Further analysis by generalised linear models
(GLMs) suggested that no significant inter-species associations remained when spatio-temporal and host variables
were accounted for, except for a marginal positive relationship of P. serrata to C. hepaticum infection (P = 0.041).
Most correlative structure amongst the infection variables
appeared to be related to SVL (snout-vent length), which
might reflect changes in susceptibility and/or exposure
with host age. There were positive trends with SVL for Skrjabinotaenia lobata (GLM, P = 0.004), C. hepaticum (P =
0.010), H. polygyrus (P = 0.004) and P. serrata (P = 0.049)
and a negative trend for laelapids (P = 0.039). Some species showed seasonal variation: Ixodes trianguliceps
increased during the autumn (P = 0.002) and Brachylaemus recurvum decreased (P = 0.011). Other features in the
data were tendencies for H. polygyrus to occur more often
within some spatial trap groups (P = 0.021) and (as previously reported [14]) for Syphacia stroma to occur more frequently in males (P = 0.002).
Associations between infection variables and TLRmediated responses
To test our main hypothesis, that innate immune responsiveness is related to infection variables, we initially used
summary variables (PC1 scores) derived from the PCAs
described above to represent the strongest patterns of
multivariate variation in the immunological and parasitological datasets. Given the tendency for different TLR
responses to co-vary positively, first component scores
(PC1I) from the PCA of TLR responses were used to represent overall innate immune responsiveness. A limited
simplification of the parasite data was also possible by
using first principal component scores (PC1p) to reflect
positive covariation between P. serrata, H. polygyrus and C.
hepaticum infection and a tentative contrasting trend in
Eimeria spp. oocyst shedding. General linear mixed model
(LMM) analysis, accounting for confounder variables and
correlations introduced by the immunological assaying

procedures, indicated that PC1I was very highly significantly negatively related to PC1p (F1,83.4 = 16.52; P <
0.001) (Figure 4B). Post-hoc analysis (LMMs) of all individual infection variables for common parasite species
(prevalence ≥ 20%) suggested a significant negative relationship of PC1I to log-transformed H. polygyrus individual counts (F1,83.7 = 7.80; P = 0.006) and P. serrata
infection grade (0, absent; 1 <20 egg cases present; 2, >20
egg cases present) (F1,84.4 = 11.17; P = 0.001)(Figures 5
and 6). PC1I was significantly positively related to Eimeria
spp. prevalence (F1,78.6 = 4.48; P = 0.037) but was not
associated with B. recurvum, S. lobata, S. stroma, C. hepaticum, laelapids and I. trianguliceps. Analysis of individual
infection variables with respect to individual TLRresponse variables in LMMs or generalised linear mixed
models (GLMMs) suggested that there was a highly significant negative relationship of H. polygyrus abundance to
TLR2/zymosan response (LMM, F1,83.1 = 11.78, P < 0.001)
and weaker negative relationships to TLR2/heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM) response (LMM, F1,76 = 4.65;
P = 0.034), TLR5 response (GLMM, F1,86.6 = 3.10; P =
0.082) and TLR9 response (LMM, F1,77.3 = 5.14; P =
0.026). Analysis of total TNF-α response summed across
all receptor-ligand combinations (TIR) also suggested a
significant negative association of H. polygyrus abundance
and overall TLR responses (LMM, F1,81.1 = 8.89; P = 0.004)
(Figure 5B–C). For Eimeria spp. prevalence there were sig-

nificant positive associations with TLR7 response (GLMM,
F1,79.2 = 6.86; P = 0.011), TLR9 response (LMM, F1,83.8 =
4.95; P = 0.029) and TIR (LMM, F1,78.1 = 6.06; P = 0.016)
that were maintained if log-transformed Eimeria FOC was
analysed instead of prevalence. Louse infection grade
showed highly significant negative association with TLR2
responses to HKLM (LMM, F1,81.1 = 18.90; P < 0.001) and
zymosan (LMM, F1,75.0 = 9.54; P = 0.003), TLR9 response
(LMM, F1,80.6 = 7.20; P = 0.009) (Figure 6B–D) and TIR
(LMM, F1,80.7 = 17.03; P < 0.001). Pairwise analyses of the
relationships of the remaining individual parasite variables (common species) to individual TLR-response variables found no significant relationships.
Effect sizes of louse infection grade on the most intense
responses (TLR2 and TLR9) and on total TNF-α (summed
over all receptor-ligand combinations), TIR, were striking
(Figure 6E–F). In LMMs with untransformed TLR variables as the response, the predicted reductions in TNF-α
production in mice in the highest louse infection category
in relation to mice uninfected with lice were 49% for
TLR2/HKLM, 55% for TLR2/zymosan, 59% for TLR9 and
56% for TIR (Table 2).
Associations between host variables and TLR-mediated
responses
In LMMs excluding parasite variables there was no significant relation of PC1I to sex (F1,82.2 = 0.74; P = 0.393), SVL
(F1,84.8 = 0.93; P = 0.337), or post-capture body weight
(BW) (F1,88.1 = 1.17; P = 0.283). A factor reflecting distinct
life stages (LH) that would be expected to show differing
hormonal backgrounds (juvenile male, non-reproductive
adult male, reproductive adult male, imperforate juvenile
female, non-pregnant non-lactating adult female, pregnant female) was also unrelated to PC1I (F4,79.8 = 0.43; P =
0.788). There was no relationship of PC1I to residuals of
BW (BWresid) (F1,82.6 = 0.09; P = 0.765) and liver weight
(LWresid) (F1,83.8 = 1.50; P = 0.224) from regressions on
SVL. No other significant associations were found
between individual TLR variables and SVL, BW, BWresid,
LWresid or LH. Whilst there was a marginally non-significant positive link between packed blood cell volume
(PCV) and PC1I (F1,76.7 = 3.77, P = 0.056) this was principally due to a strong relation of PCV to TLR9-mediated
responses (F1,80.9 = 11.41; P = 0.001) but not responses
mediated through other receptors (all P > 0.05).

Discussion
Our analysis provides compelling evidence for strong negative associations between some members of the metazoan parasite community and the level of innate immune
activation. These were detectable for the nematode H.
polygyrus and, very strongly, for the louse P. serrata but not
for other abundant community members. It has long been
known from studies of the Heligmosomoides bakeri-Mus
musculus laboratory model that H. bakeri can exert nonPage 4 of 13

specific immunosuppressive effects [15,16] that may enable other parasites to survive better in the face of host
immunity [17]. More recent studies show it to stimulate
expansion of regulatory T-cell subsets [18-21]. Given that
TLR-responsiveness can be influenced by regulatory signals from the adaptive immune system [13,22,23] and
that some helminth products, including H. polygyrus products, also direct the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs)
with muted pro-inflammatory properties and down-regulated TLR function [24-28], our current data are consistent
with an H. polygyrus-dependent depression of innate
immunity. Perhaps more surprising is the observation
that louse infection is even more strongly associated with
innate immune activation. The quantitative effect of this
infection was large, with modelling results indicating that
the highest levels of louse reproductive activity (>20 louse

egg cases per host) were associated with approximately
50% reductions in TLR2 and TLR9-mediated TNF-α
responses. This suggests that some ectoparasites that are in
contact with the host immune system merely through
feeding and attachment at the body surface may exert a
stronger influence on the immunoregulatory environment in their host than endohelminth infections.
Although P. serrata has not been a major focus of recent
immunological research, older studies have reported it
not only to generate protective immunity in M. musculus
[29], but also to mediate in vivo suppressive effects on Tcell proliferation in some inbred strains of this host [30].
Immunosuppressive effects are well documented in other
ectoparasitic arthropods [31,32]. For example, the Salp15
protein secreted in Ixodes scapularis saliva can interfere
with DC function to reduce TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine release [33] and directly inhibit CD4+ T-cell
activation [34]. It might be predicted that P. serrata may
also secrete substances into the host that interfere directly
with innate immune function or, perhaps by analogy with
gastrointestinal nematodes, stimulate expansions of regulatory T-cells. However, a further possibility is that unidentified microbial pathogens (perhaps members of the
bacterial genus Bartonella?), for which lice might act as a
vector, could be responsible for immunosuppressive
effects.
Apart from Heligmosomoides and lice, no other common
metazoan parasites appeared to be associated with variation in innate responsiveness. This may indicate that these
species lack immunomodulatory properties in A. sylvaticus
or occurred at levels too low for the detection of such
effects. The cross-sectional study design may also have
been unable to detect time-lagged correlations, depending
on the relative dynamics of the parasite infrapopulations
and immune processes. In the case of B. recurvum, S. lobata
and C. hepaticum no experimental data on infection duration and immunology are available to assess this. Ixodes
ticks, which are known to have immunomodulatory
effects in laboratory models (loc. cit.), occurred at relatively low levels and the inherently transient nature of
host-parasite contacts in these organisms could have compromised the detection of immunological influences.
Syphacia spp. live and feed in the gut lumen at all stages in
the life-cycle and perhaps have less contact with the
immune system than nematodes that feed on tissues or
have a histozoic phase in their life history. Despite this
less intimate association, Syphacia obvelata is known to
stimulate vigorous Th2 immune responses and down-regulate allergic responses [35] in M. musculus. As generation
time (1 to 2 weeks) and adult lifespan are very short in
Syphacia spp. [36,37], instantaneous population size
might not reflect the recent history of infection, compromising the ability to detect covariation between worm
counts and immune effects.

Structure in the parasite community and its relationship to toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated responses.
A) Limited structuring of the parasite community. Principal
components analysis (PCA) of infection variables showed a
first component (PC1P) accounting for 20% of total variation.
Large PC1P positive coefficients (shown alongside individual
infection variables) occurred for Heligmosomoides polygyrus,
Calodium hepaticum and Polyplax serrata, indicating a pattern
of positive covariation between these species. At the same
time, a moderate negative coefficient for Eimeria spp. faecal
oocyst count indicated a possible contrasting trend in coccidial oocyst shedding. Coefficients for Brachylaemus recurvum,
Skjrabinotaenia lobata, Syphacia stroma, Ixodes trianguliceps and
laelapid mites were small, indicating a lack of influence on
PC1P. B) Strong association between infection status and tolllike receptor (TLR)-mediated responsiveness. When PC1P
scores were used to represent a major aspect of variation in
the parasite community and PC1I scores from a PCA of logtransformed TLR-mediated responses (see Figure 2) were
used to represent overall innate immune responsiveness,
there was a strong confounder-adjusted relationship
between the two variables (general linear mixed model, P <
0.001). Plot shows the scatter of individual observations with
a least square regression line for reference.

In contrast to the metazoan parasites, there was a positive
association between TLR-mediated TNF-α responses and
the presence of microparasitic coccidian infections. This is
consistent with a Th1 response and with the immunostimulatory effects reported for Eimeria spp. in rodent and
avian laboratory models, in which primary infection is
typically associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ [3840]. Furthermore, a defined Eimeria antigen is known to
up-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production in
mice by a MyD88-dependent mechanism, consistent with
the involvement of TLRs [41,42].
The parallels between our present immuno-epidemiological results and the parasite-mediated immunosuppressive
effects reported in relevant laboratory model studies are

suggestive that the patterns we report above are due to
parasite causal effects on host immunity. We considered
the alternative possibility that stressed individuals in poor
condition [43], or individuals in active reproductive
states, might make a weaker immune response and therefore have more parasites. Under some circumstances
nutritional status can affect immunity and resistance to
parasites [44-47] (but see [48]). Glucocorticoids, produced in individuals experiencing high environmental
stress, and sex hormones are sometimes [49,50] associated with effects on immunity [44,46]. However, we generally found no associations between the host status
variables that we measured and TLR-mediated TNF-α
responsiveness. There were no significant relationships
with body size, or with indexes of general condition
including BW residuals on body length, liver weight (LW)
residuals on body length and PCV. This was with the
exception of an isolated significant positive association
between PCV and TLR9-mediated response. Nor was there
any association of TLR-mediated responses with life history stage. It therefore seems unlikely that the causality for
the patterns reported above was a tendency for weak or
reproductively active animals to make weaker immune
responses leading to higher infection levels. Whilst other
authors have reported synergistic links between declining
condition, infection and immunity in wild rodents
[43,51], our failure to link TLR-mediated TNF-α responses
and condition may be due to relatively benign environmental conditions over the sampling period, or to a lack
of sensitivity of our cross-sectional survey when compared
with longitudinal or interventional studies. A further possibility is that inter-host variation, independent of the
measures of condition that we utilised, may have caused
the observed link between TNF-α responses and parasitism. Perhaps the most likely source of such variability
would be genetic polymorphisms affecting the intensity of
TLR-mediated responses. Whilst mutations in individual
TLR genes have sometimes been reported to affect
cytokine responsiveness and resistance to infection [5257], the strong positive covariation amongst different TLR
responses in our study population would more likely
relate to polymorphism in mediators affecting shared
MyD88-dependent signalling pathways [58,59], or governing the expression of TNF-α [60]. If genotypic variation
in wild mammal populations underpinned key phenotypic variation in the innate immune response and this, in
turn, determined susceptibility to parasitism, then pinpointing the loci involved would be of fundamental interest.

Conclusion
TLR-mediated responses represent attractive measurements for ecological studies in immunology because of
their central importance in initiating innate and adaptive
immunity and their modulation by signals from regula-

tory elements of the immune system [61]. In practice,
many individual A. sylvaticus produced measurable TLRmediated TNF-α responses, and there was considerable
variation in responsiveness between individuals. Viewed
in the context of published experimental studies on infections in M. musculus, the present results in a natural A. sylvaticus population suggest that a subset of the metazoan
parasite community may be important mediators of the
level of innate immune activation. A systemic down-regulation of TLR activity by parasite-induced DC-driven Treg
expansions seems a plausible mechanistic explanation for
the current observations, although immunomodulation
by other routes cannot be discounted. One other possibility might be modulated TLR function (tolerance [62])
induced by greater exposure to ligands during chronic
infection states. Whatever the mechanism, the existence of
parasite-driven effects on innate mediators that trigger
immune responses against a spectrum of different infectious agents provides strong, albeit indirect, evidence that
pathogen/parasite communities may be structured by
cross-species effects on innate immune function. This is
highly relevant to the current interest in the importance of
interspecies interactions in pathogen community dynamics [17,63]. The profound dampening of innate immune
responsiveness associated with some metazoan parasite
infections in A. sylvaticus also supports a view that modern

parasite-free human and domesticated vertebrate populations may exist at levels of innate immune activation
much greater than would have been typical during their
recent evolutionary history. The operation of immune systems in this unnatural configuration may uncover maladaptations in control networks that were neutral in the
historical context of high metazoan parasite exposure/
high regulatory activity [64]. Our results are consistent
with recent observations that gastrointestinal nematodes
have regulatory effects on adaptive responses in laboratory models [18] and exposed human populations [9].
Importantly, we also make the novel observation that lice
may be a strong source of immunoregulatory stimuli that
is absent in many modern human populations.

Methods
Study site
Sampling was carried out in July–November 2007 at Cotgrave forest, an area of about 135ha of coniferous and
mixed forestry plantation in Nottinghamshire, UK
(+52.891, -1.041242). Mice were obtained by overnight
trapping using variable numbers of Longworth traps
assigned randomly amongst 80 permanently marked stations (1 or 0 traps/station). Stations were located at 20 m
intervals along a 1600 m linear transect extending
through the margins of contiguous forestry blocks. This
protocol was intended to spread sampling effort evenly
over a relatively large time and distance, so as not to place
very high levels of mortality on the study population.
Trapping rate was equivalent to 12.5 A. sylvaticus/km/
month.
Animals
Traps baited with peanut butter were set overnight
(17.00) and collected the following morning (08.00).
Captured animals were returned to the laboratory,
weighed (g) and housed in identical individual cages
under a lighting regimen equivalent to the natural photoperiod at the time of capture. Each cage was floored with
soft wood chippings and contained sufficient soft bedding
for the animal to make a nest. Each animal had free access
to water and a standard selection of foods that previous
trials had shown A. sylvaticus specimens found palatable.
Approximately half of each group of animals were processed between 09.00 and 12.00 on the next day (25 to 28
hours post-capture, 'day 1'). The remainder of the group
were processed at the same time on the next day (49 to 52
hours post-capture, 'day 2'). Each animal was killed by an
overdose of chloroform followed by exsanguination. SVL
(mm) and BW were recorded prior to exsanguination.
Each animal was then dissected in a Class 2 safety cabinet
and the spleen was removed to RPMI 1640. Initial parasitological observations were made on surfaces within the
body cavity (see below) and the gut was transferred to
70% ethanol for dissection and microscopic examination

of gastrointestinal parasites at a later time. A blood sample
was collected instantly on cardiac puncture in 100 μl
heparinised microcapillary tubes and spun in a microhaematocrit centrifuge (Hawksley) for 3 minutes to provide
an estimate of PCV ([height of cell column/total column
height] × 100). LW (wet weight, g) and reproductive status
were recorded. Carcasses were wrapped in white tissue,
enclosed within a plastic bag and examined later for the
presence of ectoparasites (within 24 hours).
Infection variables
We recorded all endoparasitic organisms detectable at the
light microscope level in the faeces, within the lumen of
the gut, within the peritoneal cavity, or visible on the surfaces of abdominal internal organs. Six metazoan parasite
species occurred in the gut lumen: the cestode Skjrabinotaenia lobata, the digenean Brachylaemus recurvum and the

nematodes Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia stroma,
Heterakis spumosa and Aoncotheca annulosa. Individual
counts were made for each of these species. For S. stroma,
model analyses are presented for the number of established adult females worms as rapid development combined with retroinfection and/or autoinfection processes
[65] may lead to great short-term fluctuation in the numbers of males and larvae present. Parallel analyses on total
S. stroma counts suggest equivalent results (not shown).
Another nematode, Calodium hepaticum (= Capillaria
hepatica) occurred in the liver. Female burrows of this histozoic species are associated with prominent fibrotic reactions [66] to deposited eggs. Infection severity for C.
hepaticum was graded according to the extent of fibrotic
burrows in the liver (0: absent; 1: few fibrotic burrows in
one hepatic lobe; 2: few fibrotic burrows in more than one
lobe, or an extensive mass of fibrotic burrows in one lobe;

arthropods. Individual counts were made for the flea
Ctenophthalmus nobilis, the tick Ixodes trianguliceps and laelapid mites. Infection with the louse Polyplax serrata was
graded by the abundance of egg cases in the fur (0, absent;
1 <20; 2, >20). Infection with trombiculid mites was
graded by the extent of the accompanying dermatitis (0,

samples were examined by the McMaster flotation technique, allowing counts to be made for Eimeria spp.
oocysts (minimum detection limit: 100 oocysts/g).
Although Eimeria can occur in multi-species communities
[67,68], and variation in oocyst morphology was
observed in the present study, it was not possible to
unambiguously distinguish different taxa and Eimeria
infection is analysed here as an overall FOC.
Immunological assay concept
TLRs are PRRs that detect pathogen-associated molecular
patterns. They are of central importance in the induction
of anti-pathogen immune responses, initially recognising
an infection threat and mobilising inducible innate
responses [11]. TLR stimulation is also crucial in shaping
how antigen presenting cells activate and polarise adaptive T-helper cell responses [61]. Although TLRs may utilise more than one intracellular signalling pathway, all
known human and mouse TLRs except TLR3 can signal via
MyD88 resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, including TNF-α [69]. We use an ex vivo stimulatory assay to detect TNF-α cytokine production by splenocytes following TLR stimulation. Our underlying
assumption is that the ex vivo response mediated by a particular receptor against a particular agonist reflects the relative strength of the response that would occur had the
same receptor-ligand interaction taken place in vivo. To
give a profile of responsiveness in TLRs with independent
specificities directed against different pathogen molecular
structures [10], we measured TNF-α production mediated
by TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 against defined agonists (Table 1).

Cell culture
Spleens were disaggregated through a 70 μm cell strainer
into RPMI 1640. Following erythrocytic lysis (Sigma
R7757), leucocytes were washed three times in RPMI
1640 and then cultured (37°C, 5% CO2) on 96 well plates
at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 24
mM NaHCO3, 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 2
mM L-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 60 μM monothioglycerol. Duplicate individual cultures (150 μl volume) were stimulated with one of
six different TLR agonists (at the concentrations shown in
Table 1) or left unstimulated as negative controls. Culture
supernatants were collected after 24 hours and stored at 80°C. All receptor agonist reagents utilised were tested for
functional induction of the target TLR and for endotoxin
contamination by the manufacturer (InvivoGen, San
Diego, CA, USA). Optimal agonist concentrations were
determined by preliminary dose-response experiments on
splenocyte cultures from Cotgrave A. sylvaticus.
TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
A. sylvaticus is related to the laboratory models M. musculus and Rattus norvegicus at the subfamily level (Murinae),
with recent molecular analyses leaving phylogenetic relationships amongst the three taxa unresolved [70] or tentatively placing Apodemus spp. closest to Mus [71]. Although
the TNF-α gene and protein in A. sylvaticus has not been
characterised, a comparison of TNF-α amino acid
sequences in R. norvegicus (GenBank NP_036807.1) and
M. musculus (NP_038721.1) indicated a similarity of
94%. As some possibility of cross-reactivity of antibody
reagents might reasonably be expected at amino acid
sequence similarities of >85%, and A. sylvaticus is unlikely
to be much more diverged from M. musculus than R. norvegicus, we investigated the possibility that commercially
available reagents for the detection of murine TNF-α
might be applicable to A. sylvaticus. A standard anti-M.
musculus TNF-α sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D, DY410) was identified in which
the capture and detection antibody reagents were found to
cross react with supernatants from A. sylvaticus splenocyte

cultures subjected to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. Preliminary analyses (not shown) further confirmed that
ELISA measurements in supernatants from splenocyte cultures exposed to a range of pro-inflammatory agents
(HKLM, Escherichia coli K12 lipopolysaccharide, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin, FSL-1, imiquimod, ssRNA40,
ODN2006; InvivoGen) increased in a dose-dependent
manner. Duplicate supernatants for each assay condition
in the main study (see above) were analysed on 96-well
microplates (following manufacturer's instructions), with
a seven-point recombinant mouse TNF-α (31 to 2000 pg/
ml) standard curve run in duplicate on each plate. ELISA
plate layout mirrored that of the culture plate, so that a
single term for 'assay plate' could be included in statistical
analyses to account for non-independence introduced
into the data by the assaying procedures. Given that the
ELISA antibody reagents are likely to have a differing affinity to M. musculus and A. sylvaticus TNF-α, the results we
report above may be approximate estimates of A. sylvaticus
TNF-α concentration, but should reflect relative variation
between individuals. As few individuals showed detectable responses in control (unstimulated) cultures and these
responses were low, data from the stimulatory conditions
are analysed as the determined pg/ml readings rather than
as an above-control value (analyses on data with control
concentrations subtracted gave equivalent results, not
shown).
Measures of host status
In addition to PCV, we also used residuals from regressions of BW and LW on SVL as derived measures of host
condition. In each of these cases a linear regression was a
good fit to the data. Individual hosts were classified in the
following life history stage categories: 1, juvenile male
(non-scrotal with undeveloped testes); 2, non-reproductive adult male (non-scrotal with small testes and nonexpanded seminal vesicles); 3, reproductive adult male
(scrotal with large testes and expanded seminal vesicles);
4, juvenile female (imperforate, pelvis closed); 5, nonpregnant, non-lactating adult female (perforate and/or
pelvis open); 6, pregnant female.
Data analysis
Some missing values occurred for two study animals, so
that all multivariate analyses and some analyses for individual TLR responses are based on N = 98 or 99. Where a
logarithmic transformation is used, this is log10 (x +1).
PCA on the correlation matrix was used to analyse correlational structure amongst log-transformed immunological variables. PCA of parasite data included either a logtransformed count variable or an ordinal categorical variable for each of the nine commonest species (prevalence
≥ 20%). The significance of the largest first component
(PC1) extracted from PCAs was assessed by a previously
described randomisation test [72]. The strength and direc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/16

tion of the contributions of individual variables to a principal component relate to the magnitude and sign of
variable coefficients on that component. Ranks-based correlation coefficients (Spearman's, rs) were also used to
assess pairwise associations between variables. Where
there was a significant first component for a PCA, suggesting redundancy amongst the set of variables analysed,
individual component (PC) scores were used to represent
the main axis of shared variation in subsequent analyses.
This is a standard data reduction technique, where the PC
scores represent a composite variable derived as the sum
of the products of individual observations and variable
coefficients. PC1 score variables are designated PC1I for
the immunological analysis and PC1P for the parasitological analysis. Analyses of reduced data were used to minimise the number of the main hypothesis tests (H0 =
infection variables are unrelated to TLR-mediated responsiveness), which were then followed up by exhaustive post
hoc testing of individual variables [72-74]. As part of the
post hoc analysis we also investigated other components
from PCAs with eigenvalues >1, but these results are not
shown as they failed to reveal any significant relationships
involving the immunological responses.
In order to model covariation of TLR-response variables
with other TLR-response variables, or with parasite variables, in the context of confounder variables and correlations introduced by the immunological assaying structure
we used residual maximum likelihood (REML) mixed
models (fixed model: TLR response ~sex + SVL + season +
trap group + variable of interest; random model: trap day/
process day/assay plate). Sex (male/female) and season
(summer/autumn) were included as factors with two levels and trap group as a factor with seven levels determined
by the distribution of traps within contiguous forestry
blocks. Significance of terms individually dropped from
the full model was assessed by Wald tests. TLR variables
with zero or few non-responders (TLR2, TLR9, TIR) were
treated as continuous responses in REML LMMs. For some
continuous individual TLR variables log-transformation
produced significant improvements in model fit and, for
consistency, all significance results, unless otherwise indicated, relate to models of log-transformed TNF-α (pg/ml).
In all cases these showed satisfactory fit to the data by
standard model diagnostics (see below). For predictions
in LMMs, analyses were based on untransformed TNF-α
concentrations and relate to averaged values for other variables included in the model. For highly skewed TLR
responses with around 50% zero values (TLR4, 5 and 7),
data were coded to binary form (responder/nonresponder) and analysed using REML GLMMs specifying
binomial errors (trial size = 1). When a skewed continuous parasite variable was used as an explanatory variable
in a mixed model analysis, we routinely assessed the sensitivity of the outcome to log-transformation and ordinal

categorisation of that variable. In order to model pairwise
covariation amongst infection variables in the context of
confounder variables, we used maximum likelihood
GLMs. Depending on the distributions of the response
variables, we either specified Poisson or negative binomial errors with a log link function, using an adjusted
scale parameter where appropriate. Only data for common parasites (prevalence ≥ 20%) were analysed, the
remaining species occurring at levels that might be considered negligible. Significance in GLMs was assessed by
deleting terms [75] from a model containing all confounder variables (parasite variable 1 ~SVL + sex + season
+ trap group + parasite variable 2). Standard model diagnostics (residual distributions, residual versus fit plots,
normal and half-normal plots) were used to assess the fit
of GLMs, LMMs and GLMMs to the data. PCA was implemented in Minitab® 15.1.0.0 and linear models in GenStat® version 10.1.0.71.

Stress effects
Although elevated stress cannot be eliminated in studies
where wild mammals are subject to handling and periods
of captivity, there was no significant difference for any of
the TLR-mediated response variables, including TIR, PC1I
and each of the individual TLR responses, between animals analysed 1 or 2 days post-capture (LMMs or GLMMs
of the form: TLR variable ~SVL + sex + season + trap group
+ process time, random model = capture date/assay plate;
P > 0.05). This suggests that any stress-related immunological variation had stabilised by the time the first animals were processed.
