Abstract
Background: The weevils Sitophilus spp. are among the most important cosmopolitan pests of
stored cereal grains. However, their biology and physiology are poorly understood, mainly because
the insect developmental stages take place within cereal grains and because of the lack of gene
specific molecular manipulation.
Results: To gain access to the different insect developmental stages, weevil females were allowed
to lay their eggs on starch pellets and hatched embryos were collected by dissolving starch with
water. Embryos were transferred between two Glass Plates filled with packed Flour (GPF) to mimic
compact texture of the cereal grain, and this system allowed us to recover specific developmental
stages. To knockdown the gene expressed in the bacteria-bearing organ (the bacteriome), whole
larvae were injected with dsRNA to target the wpgrp1 gene and they were then left to develop for
a further 4 days period. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses on the bacteriome of
these animals revealed a down-regulation of the wpgrp1 expression, both at transcript and protein
levels.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that whole larval injection with dsRNA results in a high
and systemic decrease of both mRNA and protein in the bacteriome tissue. This, along with the
possibility of access to the insect developmental stages, opens up a new research avenue for
exploring gene specific functions in the cereal weevils.

Background
Cereals are the world's basic staple food and they provide
an energy and protein source for many populations, particularly in the developing world. Unfortunately, cereal
grain losses during storage can reach up to 50% of the
total harvest in some countries, which represents a world-

wide loss equivalent to thousands of millions of euros [1].
Grain weevils Sitophilus spp. (Dryophthoridae, Curculionoidea) are well-known as major primary pests of stored
cereal grains causing damage and rendering the grain
more susceptible to attack by secondary insect pests such
as Tribolium.

The genus Sitophilus includes three cereal feeding species
(Sitophilus oryzae, Sitophilus zeamais and Sitophilus granarius). Interestingly, all three species share an intracellular
symbiosis with a Gram-negative γ-Proteobacterium [2,3].
Symbiotic bacteria (endosymbionts) are transmitted
maternally to the offsprings and, at an early stage of host
embryogenesis, these bacteria induce the differentiation
of specialized host cells (the bacteriocytes) that house the
bacteria, protect them from the host immune system
[4,5], and form a symbiotic organ (the bacteriome) that
persists throughout the larval stages [6]. Endosymbiotic
bacteria balance the insect diet within the cereal grains,
which are starch-rich but poor in amino acids, lipids and
vitamins [7-9]. This improves mitochondrial energetic
metabolism and impacts, thereby, on the insect fitness,
flight ability and invasive power [10,11,6,12].
The control of these storage insects is mainly mediated by
use of synthetic insecticides, which generate high environmental costs and lead to insecticide resistant strains [13].
Consequently the development of methods facilitating
molecular manipulation of these insects is of wide interest. As insect physiology and reproduction are drastically
disturbed in the absence of endosymbionts, one innovative strategy would rely on a better understanding of host
symbiont interaction.
Sequencing of the Sitophilus endosymbiont genome,
along with the development of expressed sequence tags
helps to the better knowledge of the weevil biology and
physiology [14,4,15]. One very promising method for
generating targeted down-regulation of gene expression in
a wide range of organisms is RNA interference (RNAi)
[16]. RNAi also has evolved into a powerful tool for probing gene function in Drosophila, Tribolium, Caenorhabditis
elegans and mice. Delivery of dsRNA or siRNA into a cell
triggers abrogation of the target mRNA. Previous experiments have shown the feasibility of using RNAi to abrogate the expression of gene transcripts in several insects
[17].
A number of animal cells have been shown to naturally
take up exogenous dsRNA and use it to initiate RNAi
silencing. In some organisms, such as Drosophila and Bombyx mori, certain cells show an efficient uptake of dsRNA
but they seem to be unable to transmit this dsRNA to
other cells in the body [17,18]. Organisms, such as C. elegans, can both take up dsRNA and spread it systemically to
elicit an RNAi response throughout the entire organism.
Interestingly, the first systemic RNAi response in insects
was documented in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum:
an injection of dsRNA into the larvae results in specific
gene silencing in adults [19]. This effect can also be transmissible between generations [20]. This coleopteran spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/44

cies is closely related to Sitophilus both phylogenetically
and ecologically.
We thus undertook research to access the biological and
physiological aspects of the Sitophilus system based on the
use of genomic tools. The weevil lifestyle and behavior
limits embryonic, larval and nymphal development to
within the grain only. Thus, weevils cannot survive or
reproduce on cereal flour in the way that Tribolium insects
do. Here, we present new rearing conditions that allow
experimental access to different embryonic and larval
stages of the cereal weevil Sitophilus. This system enables
us to keep insects alive outside the cereal grains for the
whole life cycle. To test the protocols for gene silencing in
Sitophilus we have selected a gene specifically expressed in
the bacteriome, which encodes the peptidoglycan recognition protein (wpgrp1) [21,4]. Using injected dsRNA, we
present evidence of systemic RNAi in the weevil Sitophilus
spp.

Methods
Insect rearing
Insects from Sitophilus zeamais species (Lagoa strain) were
reared as described in [21]. Larvae normally grow inside
the wheat grains until they emerge as adults one month
after the egg laying, at 27.5°C and 70% relative humidity
(rh). For RNAi experiments, third-instar larvae were dissected out of the grains and kept alive in a moist atmosphere at 27.5°C for the length of the experiment.
Using Glass Plates filled with packed Flour (GPF) for
artificial rearing
Normally cereal weevil larvae fail to feed outside the
grains for behavioral reasons. To overcome this barrier, we
have set up an artificial system to mimic the compactness
of the cereal grain, which consists of filling with wheat
flour the space between two glass plates separated with
1.5 mm-thick spacers (figure 1). Weevil individuals (larvae or embryos) are deposited between two layers of
packed wheat flour. We first deposit the first flour layer
between the glass plates, then the lavae, and finally we
recover the larvae with a second flour layer. This system
could also be adapted in an Eppendorf tube.

To access the insect embryonic and post-embryonic
stages, both embryos and third-instar larvae were raised
within the GPF and kept at 27.5°C and 70% rh until the
adults emerged. Females were allowed to lay eggs on
starch pellets (L'amidon Remy, ADS) over a period of 4
hours and the embryos were collected by dissolving the
starch in water. Embryos were transferred immediately
into the GPF system and left in an incubator until the
adults emerged. Third-instar larvae were removed directly
from the wheat grains after dissection.

Glass Plates filled with packed Flour (GPF). This artificial system aims to mimic the compactness of the cereal
grain. It consists of filling the space between two glass plates,
separated with 1.5 mm-thick spacers, with wheat flour. Weevils are individually deposited between two layers of packed
wheat flour and transferred to the incubator (27.5°C and
70% relative humidity). This protocol could be adapted to an
Eppendorf vial system.

dsRNA synthesis and injection
The method used to synthesize dsRNA is similar to that
described by [22]. The primers were designed with the
software E-RNAi, available at http://www.dkfz.de/
signaling2/e-rnai/. For the wpgrp1 gene, we used the primers 5'wpgrp1-T7dsRNA and 3'wpgrp1-T7dsRNA that
match within the coding sequence, and for the gfp gene we
used the primers 5'gfp-T7dsRNA and 3'gfp-T7dsRNA (see
Table 1). The nucleotides in bold are from the T7 RNA
polymerase promoter.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/44

Recombinant plasmids pCR2.1-topo-wpgrp1 [21] and
pw8-gfp [23] were used as a matrix to amplify, respectively, wpgrp1 and gfp with BD Advantage 2 polymerase
Mix (BD Biosciences). PCR products were cleaned with a
NucleoSpin Extract II kit (MachereyNagel) and were used
as templates for in vitro dsRNA synthesis using a MEGAscript RNAi Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After synthesis, the
dsRNA was precipitated overnight at -80°C with 0.3 M
sodium acetate, 1.5 μl glycogen and 2 volumes of 100%
ethanol, resuspended in water to a final concentration of
2.89 μg/μl. The purity and the integrity were determined
by Nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNA
was kept at -20°C prior to injection within the following
7 days.
200 ng of dsRNA (69 nl) were injected into the dorsal and
posterior part of third-instar larvae using the Nanoinject II
nanoinjector (Drummond scientific) and they were kept
in the GPF system for 4 days. Bacteriomes were subsequently isolated for RNA extraction.
Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Bacteriomes were dissected (25 for each RNA sample)
from the fourth instar larvae and total RNA was extracted
by RNAqueous®-Micro (Ambion), a micro-scale RNA isolation kit, as described in the manufacturers' procedure
that includes a DNase treatment final step. After purification, the RNA concentration of each sample was measured
by the Nanodrop® spectrophotometer and total RNA quality was checked by electrophoresis. Reverse-transcription
into the first strand cDNA was carried out using the First
strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen).
Real-time RT PCR transcript quantification
Quantitative measurements were performed on RNA samples originating from 5 independent replicates. The quantification was performed with a LightCycler® instrument
using the LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR green I

kit (Roche Diagnostics). Data were normalized using the
ratio of the target cDNA concentration to that of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) gene. The
expression of this gene is not significantly influenced by
the treatments and it is similar to the expression of the
ribosomal protein L29 gene (data not shown). Primers
were designed to amplify fragments with less than 300 bp;
wpgrp1-For and wpgrp1-Rev generate a wpgrp1 fragment
of 248 bp in length, and gapdh-For and gapdh-Rev generate a gapdh fragment of 277 bp in length (Table 1).
The PCR reactions were carried out in LightCycler 96-well
plates in a final volume of 10 μl containing 2.5 μl of cDNA
samples (diluted fivefold) and 7.5 μl of Light Cycler® 480
SYBR Green Master 1 mix, with 0.5 μl of 10 mM of each
primer, 1.5 μl H2O and 5 μl of Mastermix. After 5 min at
95°C, the cycling conditions were as follows: 45 cycles at
95°C for 10 s, 56°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s. For product identification, a melting curve was constructed at the
end of each PCR by heating for 30 s at 66°C and then
increasing the temperature up to 95°C with increment
rates of 0.11°C/s. Reactions were achieved by cooling at
40°C for 30 s.
The PCR efficiency (The efficienty (E) is calculated from
the slope of the standard curve, which is obtained with
different matrix quantities. E = 10-1/slope, in this study E
was 97.7% for the gapdh and 94.4% for the wpgrp1) and,
for the individual samples, the crossing point (Cp, the
point at which amplified product is first visible in the
data) and the concentration (conc.) of the wpgrp1 (or the
gapdh) transcripts were determined. As the quantification
relies on the PCR efficiency of each experiment, ratios
were then normalized with the gapdh. The relative ratio for
each sample was calculated according to the formula:
(conc. wpgrp1 (sample)/conc. gapdh (sample)). Normalized data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA and
Tukey HSD post hoc test [24].
Expression of recombinant Protein in Escherichia coli for
antibody preparation
Total cDNA from larval bacteriomes of Sitophilus zeamais
served as a template in PCR amplification for isolating the
wpgrp1 cDNA.

The primers used were For-wpgrp1 cDNA and Rev-wpgrp1
cDNA (Table 1). The resulting DNA encoded 263 residues
of the mature protein. The PCR product (789 pb) was
cloned into a pTrc-His-Topo expression vector (Invitrogen) and the resulting vector was introduced into an E. coli
TOP10 strain. The nucleotide sequence of the synthesized
gene was checked by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and
the recombinant plasmid was transformed into the E. coli
BL21 strain. Expression of the recombinant protein
Wpgrp1 flanked with 6 histidines at N-terminus was
induced by 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside at
an optical density of 0.6 at 30°C for 4 hours.
Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in buffer A,
pH 8 containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM
NaCl and lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.
The fusion protein bound to a Protino-Ni column (Macherey-nagel) was eluted with buffer A containing 250 mM
imidazole after the column had been washed with buffer
A. The eluted fraction was dialyzed against buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol. The protein was mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer
and then, separated by electrophoresis in a 12.5% acrylamide gel. Next, the protein band was cut, N-terminal
sequenced, and sliced into pieces for injection into rabbit
to generate polyclonal Wpgrp1 antiserum at CovalAb
Lyon (France), which was harvested 74 days after the initial inoculation.
Western-blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The
protein samples from the bacteriome were mixed with the
sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 12.5%
SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto a sheet of
PVDF membrane (Amersham). After blotting, the membrane was blocked by incubation in a 3% gelatin solution,
incubated with anti-wpgrp1 antiserum solution (1:500 v/
v) at room temperature for 2 h and washed in TBST (100
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20). For
normalization, blots were probed with a β-tubulin antibody raised from the Drosophila melanogaster β-tubulin
(tebu-bio, 1:500 v/v). The membrane was then incubated
with 1:5000 (v/v) diluted anti-rabbit IgG-peroxydase anti-

Applying an artificial rearing methodology for weevil
manipulation
Unlike Tribolium, weevil larvae are unable to feed on
wheat flour or to survive outside cereal grains for behavioral and morphological reasons. Larvae require a compact
texture that applies pressure on their back, which is
required for an access to the food with their mandibles. To
mimic this structure, we have set up an artificial rearing
apparatus that consists of depositing weevil embryos and
larvae between two layers of packed wheat flour (see Fig.
1). To access the later stages of the weevil life cycle (i.e.
third and fourth larval stages), larvae were directly har-

vested from grain dissection. Early development is accessible using the embryo stages recovered from 2- to 4-hr
layings on starch kernels. Embryos are collected once the
females have laid by dissolving starch in water. They can
either be manipulated or transferred to the GPF system to
obtain the later developmental stages. Survival rates presented in Table 2 show that up to 34% of embryos succeeded in reaching the adult stage. When larvae are
transferred and raised in the GPF, the yield is close to
100% (data not shown).
This system is of interest to applied and fundamental sciences as it allows easy access to different stages. Drugs and
molecules of interest could be mixed with the flour and,
thus, be tested directly on the insect variants.
Testing RNAi-mediated gene silencing in Sitophilus
RNAi was tested on Sitophilus insects with the wpgrp1 gene
as a target. We recently identified the wpgrp1 gene by suppression subtractive hybridization while screening for
genes, which expression is upregulated in the bacteriome
tissue [14]. To investigate the wpgrp1 function in more
detail, we have raised a Wpgrp1 polyclonal antibody and
we have confirmed the presence of a high amount of
wpgrp1 protein within the bacteriome by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 2).

When third instar larvae were injected with sterile PBS or
with gfp_dsRNA, the wpgrp1 transcript level in the bacteriome was within the same range as in the bacteriome of the
uninjected control larvae. However, an injection of 200 ng
of wpgrp1_dsRNA in the larval hemolymph leads to a 98%
reduction in the target gene, compared to gfp_dsRNA control in the bacteriome wpgrp1 transcript levels (Fig. 3). Furthermore, this downregulation at the transcript level also
affects the amount of Wpgrp1 protein in the bacteriome
(Fig. 2). These data highlight the efficiency of RNAi gene
silencing in Sitophilus insects and show that the RNAi technique can be successfully used to knockdown target genes
in the bacteriome tissue.

Conclusion
RNAi is a method by which dsRNA can be introduced
directly into animals to trigger significant suppression of
specific gene expression. In the light of our data, establishing the systemic RNAi pathway in this cereal weevil paves
the way for more detailed comprehensive studies, on a
molecularly level of weevil biology. The systemic RNAi
pathway may also provide opportunities for developing
species-specific, and, hence, ecologically friendly pest control methods. Genomic approaches have recently provided 10,000 unigenes, which will help to develop
genome-wide RNAi applications addressing fundamental
questions in cereal weevil physiology, development and
gene regulation.
