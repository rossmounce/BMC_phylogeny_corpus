Abstract
Background: α-Amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils, as these insects are highly
dependent on starch as an energy source. In this study, we aimed to reveal the structure and diversity of dimeric αamylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat from Israel and to elucidate the relationship between the emmer wheat
genes and ecological factors using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Another objective of this study was
to find out whether there were any correlations between SNPs in functional protein-coding genes and the environment.
Results: The influence of ecological factors on the genetic structure of dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes was evaluated
by specific SNP markers. A total of 244 dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes were obtained from 13 accessions in 10
populations. Seventy-five polymorphic positions and 74 haplotypes were defined by sequence analysis. Sixteen out of the
75 SNP markers were designed to detect SNP variations in wild emmer wheat accessions from different populations in
Israel. The proportion of polymorphic loci P (5%), the expected heterozygosity He, and Shannon's information index in
the 16 populations were 0.887, 0.404, and 0.589, respectively. The populations of wild emmer wheat showed great
diversity in gene loci both between and within populations. Based on the SNP marker data, the genetic distance of pairwise comparisons of the 16 populations displayed a sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances. The
values of P, He, and Shannon's information index were negatively correlated with three climatic moisture factors, whereas
the same values were positively correlated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients' analysis with some of the other
ecological factors.
Conclusion: The populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide range of diversity in dimeric α-amylase inhibitors,
both between and within populations. We suggested that SNP markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity
of functional genes in wild emmer wheat. These results show significant correlations between SNPs in the α-amylase
inhibitor genes and ecological factors affecting diversity. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant
proportion of the variations in the SNPs, and the SNPs could be classified into several categories as ecogeographical
predictors. It was suggested that the SNPs in the α-amylase inhibitor genes have been subjected to natural selection, and
ecological factors had an important evolutionary influence on gene differentiation at specific loci.

Background
Wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, the progenitor of
bread and pasta wheats, presumably originated in and
adaptively diversified from, northeastern Israel into the
Near East Fertile Crescent [1]. In this center of diversity,
wild emmer wheat harbors rich genetic diversity and
resources [1]. Previous studies in T. dicoccoides and other
cereals have shown significant nonrandom adaptive
molecular genetic differentiation at single and multilocus
structures in either protein-coding regions or randomly
amplified polymorphic DNAs among micro-ecological
environments [2,3]. It was also determined that wild
emmer wheat is genetically variable and that the genetic
differentiation of populations included regional and local
patterns with sharp genetic differentiation over short distances [4]. Genetic polymorphisms of α- and β-amylase in
wild emmer wheat have been characterized, and it was
found that diversity of climatic and edaphic natural selection, rather than stochasticity or migration, was the major
evolutionary force driving amylase differentiation [5].
The estimates of molecular diversity derived from PCRbased techniques such as amplified restriction fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP), microsatellites (short
sequence repeats or SSR), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and sequence comparisons are several-fold
higher than enzymatic diversity [6]. A substantial private
and public effort has been undertaken to characterize
SNPs tightly associated for genetic diversity. SNPs are
identified in ESTs (expressed sequence tags), thus the polymorphisms could be directly used to map functional and
expressed genes, rather than DNA sequences derived from
conventional RAPD and AFLP techniques, which are typically not functional genes [7-9]. The majority of SNPs in
coding regions (cSNPs) are single-base substitutions,
which may or may not result in amino acid changes. Some
cSNPs may alter a functionally important amino acid residue, and these are of interest for their potential links with
phenotypes [10].
α-Amylase is a family of enzymes that hydrolyze α-D(1,4)-glucan linkages and play an important role in the
carbohydrate metabolism of many autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms [11]. Heterotrophic organisms use αamylase primarily to digest starch in their food sources
[12]. Several kinds of α-amylase and proteinase inhibitors
in seeds and vegetative organs act to regulate the numbers
of phytophagous insects [13-15]. α-Amylase inhibitors
are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils as
these insects are highly dependent on starch as an energy
source [16]. In cereal seeds, α-amylase inhibitor proteins
with 120–130 amino acids, which include trypsin inhibitors, as well as α-amylase inhibitors, can be grouped into
one large family on the basis of the homology between
their amino acid sequences [17]. In this family, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/91

dimeric α-amylase inhibitor has been well characterized.
For weevil control, α-amylase inhibitors could be manipulated through plant genetic engineering. However, many
insects have several α-amylases that differ in specificity,
and successful utilization of a food source is dependent
on the expression of a α-amylase for which there is no specific inhibitor [12]. The dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes
were located on chromosome 3BS and 3DS; there was no
known evidence of a homoeologous locus or loci on chromosome 3AS of the polyploid wheats [18,19]. Therefore,
the tetraploid wheats, which are lacking the D genome,
have only the inhibitor genes on chromosome 3BS [19].
Evolutionary pressures of various kinds have often been
hypothesized to cause active and rapid evolutionary
changes. In a co-evolving system of plant-insect interactions, plants synthesize a variety of toxic proteinaceous
and nonproteinaceous molecules for their protection
against insects [20,21]. Proteinase inhibitors are therefore
a potential model system in which to study basic evolutionary processes, such as functional diversification [22].
It is well established that multiple forms of proteins are
active on exogenous or endogenous α-amylases in the
wheat kernel, and proteinaceous dimeric α-amylase
inhibitors could function against α-amylase from various
origins [23]. It is known that the bulk of wheat albumins
consist of a few amylase iso-inhibitor families that are
very likely phylogenetically related and coded by a small
number of parental genes [24]. The α-amylase inhibitors
have long been proposed as possible important weapons
against pests whose diets make them highly dependent on
α-amylase activity. In vitro and in vivo trials using α-amylase inhibitors, including those made under field conditions, have now fully confirmed their potential for
increasing yields by controlling insect populations [16].
Two conflicting views confront ecologists and evolutionary biologists on the degree of symmetry in interactions
between plants and phytophagous insects [25]. The symmetrical view holds that insects and plants have strong
effects on one another's evolutionary and ecological
dynamics. The asymmetrical view acknowledges that
plants have major effects on insects but claims that insects
seldom impose significant effects on plants [25]. Plant
defense mechanisms have been the subject of intense
investigation [26]. The genome shaping events and processes occurring at dimeric α-amylase inhibitor gene loci
from the B and S genomes of wheat and Aegilops section
sitopsis, respectively, have been characterized. A Phylogenetic Median-Joining network of the haplotypes and a
neighbor-joining tree analysis have indicated that the
inhibitor gene sequences from common wheat and T. dicoccoides are closely related to those from Ae. speltoides [27].
However, little is known about their evolution under the

influence of ecology. The molecular diversity of α-amylase
inhibitor genes, as well as their divergence among 16 populations of wild emmer wheat from Israel, was investigated to gain insight into the correlation between plant
defense proteinaceous inhibitors and ecological factors.

Results

Isolation of the ORF of dimeric α-amylase inhibitors
Using two cloning primers, genomic PCR amplifications
were conducted, and one desired DNA band was detected
in each accession of wild emmer wheat. Cloning the fragments yielded 244 positive clones from 13 accessions
(randomly selected from 10 populations), which were
subsequently sequenced (data not shown). Only three out
of 244 dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes had a common
three bp deletion, and those three genes were obtained
from one accession derived from Mt. Hermon, whereas
the other cloned fragments had 426 bp long (data not
shown). It was predicted that all of the 426-bp sequences
would encode functional dimeric α-amylase inhibitors.
Alignment of the gene sequences from emmer wheat with
sequences from the species of Aegilops section Sitopsis
(including Ae. speltoides, Ae. bicornis, Ae. longissima, Ae.
searsii, and Ae. sharonensis), Ae. tauschii, einkorn wheats,
and common wheat clearly indicated that the emmer
wheat sequences were derived from the B genome [27].
SNP and haplotype analyses of dimeric α-amylase
inhibitor genes
The frequency of SNPs in the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor
genes in emmer wheat was 1 out of 5.7 bases, which was
higher than the SNPs observed for kunitz-type α-amylase
inhibitor and α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor genes in barley and dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes in common
wheat [28-30]. Among the 426 nucleotides, there were
351 conserved positions and 75 variable positions among
the 244 α-amylase inhibitor genes sequenced from 13
accessions.

A total of 74 haplotypes were revealed by sequence analysis (Figure 1); 53 of these were each found in only a single
sequence. Haplotype 41 was observed at the highest frequency, i.e., in 38 gene sequences, followed by haplotype
27 in 33 sequences (Figure 1).
The relationship between SNPs and amino acid changes
in the α-amylase inhibitor proteins is summarized in
Table 1. The 75 SNPs resulted in 38 amino acid substitutions. The position of each SNP in the sequence, whether
the predicted change was synonymous (silent) or nonsynonymous (replacement), was determined. Forty percent of SNPs were found to occur at the third codon position, and as expected, most of these were synonymous
(Table 1). A number of changes were also identified in
codon positions 1 and 2, and these accounted for more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/91

than 95% of the non-synonymous changes (Table 1). In
total, 60% of the SNPs resulted in non-synonymous
changes.
Primer design and SNP mining of wild emmer wheat
Using the information from the 75 SNPs identified in the
α-amylase inhibitor genes, 16 primers (combined with
the reverse cloning primer, R, as SNP markers) were successfully designed to detect the SNPs in 205 accessions
from 18 populations. The primers, with the SNP (bold letters) at the 3' end and an extra mismatched nucleotide
(underline) on the third nucleotide from the end are
listed in Table 2. A total of 14 SNPs were detected with the
16 SNP markers from position 19 to 288 of the α-amylase
inhibitor gene, and the size of the amplified fragments
ranged from 158 to 426 bp. The data was then organized
in terms of genotypic frequencies ("0" or "1") to assess the
population structure.

There were only 5 and 2 accessions from Yehudiyya and
Achihood, respectively. Thus, the data for Yehudiyya and
Achihood were not used in further analyses. Positive fragment frequency for each primer in the 16 populations is
listed Additional file 1.
Genetic diversity and distance of α-amylase inhibitor genes
Some genetic parameters of the 16 populations of wild
emmer wheat are summarized in Table 3. The proportion
of polymorphic loci P (5%), the expected heterozygosity
He, and Shannon's information index of the 16 populations of wild emmer wheat were 0.887, 0.404, and 0.589,
respectively. The values of He ranged from 0.182 to 0.437,
and the population of Kokhav Hashahar had the highest
value of He (0.437), followed by the population of RoshPinna, whereas the population from Daliyya was characterized by the lowest He value of 0.182.

The genetic distances (D) were calculated for comparisons
of all 16 populations based on the positive fragment of
SNP markers among all population pairs (see Additional
file 2). The highest genetic distance (0.263) was obtained
between populations of Kokhav Hashahar and Daliyya,
whereas the most related populations were Qazzrin and
Gamla with a genetic distance of 0.017. However, lower D
values (< 0.050) were observed between some populations from different areas, and, for the most part, the estimates of D value were geographically independent. Large
genetic distances and sharp genetic differentiation over
long geographic distances could be found. For example,
Kokhav Hashahar in southern Israel had higher D values
with the populations from Gamla (0.221), Nahef (0.247),
Beit-Oren (0.215), Daliyya (0.263), and Bat-Shelomo
(0.224) in northeast Israel.

Principle components & multiple regression analysis of
environmental variables and SNPs
To assess if some of the ecological factors are correlated to
each other, principle components analysis (PCA) was carried out using 23 ecological factors as variables. A combination of the first four components could give us a high
cumulative percent (88.81%) according to the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix (see Additional file 3A; 4),
which could be used to explain the ecological associations. The main ecological factors of the first component
were Rd and Ev (two water availability factors) that could
give 40.60% eigenvalues, and the second component
could give 28.66% eigenvalues (see Additional file 3).
And from PCA analysis, it was known that the accessions
from Mt. Hermon were affected the most by ecological
factors (see Additional file 3C).

After analyzed of the factors by projection of the variables
on the factor-plane (see Additional file 4) and consulted
the correlations of these factors (see Additional file 5), 11
independent ecological factors were chosen. And then,
multiple regression analysis was done using these 11 factors to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and SNPs.
The geographical, temperature, water, and solar radiation
factors in Table 4, singly or in combination, explained a
significant proportion of the diversity in the SNPs (Table
5). The best variable predictors of P, He, and Shannon's
information index, significantly explaining 0.264 – 0.355
of the variance, was the water availability factor Hu-an.
The combination of three variable predictors accounting
for geographic and water availability factors Hu-an, Ev,

*SNP positions were on the 3' end of the primers and are identified in bold letters. Extra mismatched nucleotides were also incorporated in the
primers (underlined).

and Lt (mean annual humidity, mean annual evaporation
and latitude) accounted significantly (p < 0.05) for about
0.55 of the genetic diversity. The addition of a fourth variable predictor, Rad (total solar radiation per year), or Sh
(mean number of Sharav days) to the first three factors
accounted for approximately 0.65 of the diversity (significant at p < 0.05) (Table 5).
SNPs could be classified into several categories in terms of
their prime ecogeographical predictors. The best single
variable predictors of SNP marker allele frequencies were:
(1) water (Hu-an, Rr, Th, Rd, Ev): W24A, W46A, W47AT,
W127G, W190C, W276A; (2) temperature (Td, Tm, Sh):
W19G, W35A, W207T, W263TC, W263TA, W288CG; (3)

geographic (Ln, Lt): W125G, W288AG; and (4) solar radiation (Rad): W195T; W259A. It was obvious that water
factors were the best variable predictors, singly or in combination, with other ecological factors (Table 5).
Spearman rank correlations of SNP positions with
environment
The average of genetic indices (P, He, and Shannon's
information index) and He of each of the SNP positions
with ecogeographical variables appear in Table 6. We
recorded the ecological variables for the populations. The
P, He, and Shannon's information index were negatively
correlated with the three water factors: mean annual
humidity (Hu-an), mean humidity at 14:00 h (Hu-14),

and mean number of dew nights in summer (Dw). However, they correlated positively with other factors: latitude
(Ln), seasonal temperature difference (Td), estimate of
population size (Sz), marginality (Ma), mean interannual variability of rainfall (Rv), and total solar radiation per year (Rad). The correlation matrix between He in
the SNPs and geographic variables contained 30 significant (p < 0.05) correlations. Five SNPs (e.g., W47AT,
W125G, W127G, W263TA, and W288AG) positively correlated with Sz (rs = 0.556–0.687), and four SNPs (e.g.,
W19G, W47AT, W127G, and W288AG) positively correlated with Ln (rs = 0.508–0.567). Four SNPs: W24A,
W127G, W190C, and W263TA negatively correlated with
two water factors, Hu-an or Rn (mean annual rainfall or
mean annual humidity) or both of these factor (Table 6).

Discussion

SNPs in the α-amylase inhibitor genes
In sequence comparisons, the 244 dimeric α-amylase
inhibitor genes from wild emmer wheat, had a high level
of similarity, indicating that the primary structure of these
genes was similar to those of known dimeric α-amylase
inhibitors 0.19 (WDAI-0.19) and 0.53 (WDAI-0.53). The
predicted protein sequence of the 244 cloned α-amylase
inhibitor genes from wild emmer wheat showed the presence of 10 Cys, which were the amino acids most important to the structure and function of the mature protein

[31]. Changes in structure of α-amylase inhibitor proteins
would affect their specificity and activity against different
mammalian and insect α-amylase [32]. A comparison of
sequence between members of the α-amylase inhibitors
0.19 group indicated that not only the 10 Cys residues
were of importance, but also Asp110, Lys116, Asn29,
Glu35, Ser94, Leu90, Trp51, His47, and Gln13 were
important to form the structure of those inhibitors [33].
Most of the SNPs did not occur at highly conserved positions, which ensures that the α-amylase inhibitors keep
their correct 3D structure to combine with the α-amylase.
However, Gln13, His47, Ser49, Leu90, Val105, and
Asp110 were changed by SNPs in some of the cloned αamylase inhibitor genes (Table 1). It is noteworthy that
only the α-amylase inhibitors from the D genome of Ae.
tauschii and common wheat, which were closely related to
inhibitor 0.19, had the His47 [30], whereas the His47 was
replaced by Asp or Tyr in 98% of the inhibitor genes from
wild emmer wheat.
Genetic diversity of the α-amylase inhibitor genes in wild
emmer wheat
Genetic diversity of the α-amylase inhibitor genes of 198
wild emmer wheat accessions from 16 populations in
Israel were revealed by 16 SNP markers. Individual accessions from different populations could not be distinguished clearly by the sequences of their α-amylase

inhibitor genes; whereas, using the SNP-specific primers,
all wild emmer wheat populations were distinguishable,
even within closely related populations originating in
proximate geographic locations (Table 3). Our results
demonstrated that the polymorphism of α-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat correlated with the ecogeographic distribution of the accessions. The results suggest
that the gene was subjected to strong natural selection.
The observations were consistent with previous results
obtained with high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin
subunits, which are also seed storage proteins [34-36]. In
other studies, DNA diversity of glutenin subunits was
shown to be correlated to environmental factors and variation [34].
The genetic diversity profiles in this study were compared
with earlier allozyme studies [1], RAPD loci [37], and with
the microsatellite studies [38] in wild emmer wheat populations. Although the SNP markers in the protein-coding
genes yielded lower values of diversities than other methods, the results in this study were able to reveal the correlations of SNP variations in specific functional genes with
ecological factors.
Central populations used in this study were collected in
warm, humid environments on the Golan Plateau and
near the Sea of Galilee. Marginal steppic populations were
collected across a wide geographic area on the northern,
eastern, and southern borders of wild emmer distribution
involving hot, cold, and xeric peripheries, while marginal
mesic (Mediterranean) populations were collected from
the western border of wild emmer distribution [1,39]. The
present study included 198 accessions collected from 16
different sites in Israel and covered a wide range of ecogeographical conditions across the distribution range of the
species. Specific SNP positions detected in the α-amylase

inhibitor genes were found to be highly effective in distinguishing genotypes and populations of wild emmer wheat
originating from diverse ecogeographic sites in Israel.
High levels of polymorphic loci (P), expected heterozygosity (He), and Shannon's information index (Table 3)
with high genetic distance values between populations
could be found (see Additional file 2). These results suggest that the genetic variation at these SNP positions in the
dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes was somewhat ecologically determined for these populations.
Genetic distance versus geographical distance
The relationship between SNPs' genetic distance and geographical distance was investigated, and it was found that
the estimates of genetic distance (D) were geographically
independent, as was previously found for allozymes,
RAPD loci, and microsatellite analyses [1,37,38]. Quite
often it is easier to find a greater genetic difference
between proximal populations than among populations
that are far apart. This was clearly demonstrated by local
short transects of different soil types at Tabigha [40] and
by the micro-differences of sun-shade differentiation at
Yehudiyya [41]. Sharp genetic divergence (large D) over
very short geographic distances against small genetic
divergence (small D) between large geographically distances were observed in wild emmer populations (see
Additional file 2). For example, it was shown that the
genetic distance obtained between the population at Gitit
and the population at Kokhav Hashahar (located only
about 10 km apart), with D = 0.1513, was 2.66 times
higher than the genetic distance between the population
at Mt. Hermon and the population at J'aba (separated by
160 km, with D = 0.0569). In other words, the distance
between the first 2 populations was 1/16 of the distance
between the second 2 populations (Figure 2 and Additional file 2).

The genetic structure of wild emmer wheat populations in
Israel is mosaic [36]. This patchy genetic distribution
appears to reflect the underlying ecological heterogeneity
at both micro- and macro-scales [1,37,38,40,41]. Thus the
higher polymorphisms and genetic variations of dimeric
α-amylase inhibitor genes within and between populations could be explained by natural selection.
Ecological genetics of SNPs in dimeric α-amylase inhibitor
genes
Natural populations of wild emmer are highly polymorphic in morphological characters, as well as for various
economically important traits [3,5,34]. Although major
collection areas such as Mt. Hermon, Rosh Pinna, Gamla,
Bat-Shelomo, and Tabigha are at similar longitude and
latitude, they differ significantly in altitude. These locations, for example, are respectively at 1300, 700, 200, 75,
and 0 m above sea level (Table 4). Along with these features, several other environmental factors differ for these
locations [1,39].

In this study, the mean number of P, He, and Shannon's
information index were negatively correlated with the
three water factors and positively correlated with the other
six factors (Table 6). It was noteworthy that the significant
ecological factors (Ln, Ta, Td, Hu-14, Hu-an, Dw, and Rv),
revealed by a Spearman rank correlations matrix between
allozyme and climate, were similar to the results in this
study [1]. This similarity might be because the correlation
between ecological factors and coding sequences or proteins (allozyme) is different from the non-coding
sequences. Moreover, the correlation between photosynthetic performance and ecogeographical variables indicated that ecological factors, e.g., sharav (Sh), dewy nights
(Dw), radiation (Rad), rainy days (Rd), altitude (Al), and
latitude (Lt) were distinctly correlated with photosynthetic factors [42]. Photosynthetic efficiency needs specific
ecological factors, especially light.
In this study, the SNP variations showed significant correlations with ecological factors (Table 5; Table 6). Geographical, temperature, water availability, edaphic, biotic
and solar radiation factors (Sz, So, Rad, Al, Rn, Lt, Sh, Rv,
Ln, Td, Hu-14, Hu-an, Dw, and Ma), singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the diversity
in the SNPs of α-amylase inhibitor genes. The association
of these factors with SNPs was similar to the association of
latitude/altitude with RAPD and microsatellite diversity
[37,38]. It could be explained by the change in ecological
factors, i.e., Al, the sharp gradient of climatic conditions
from north to south in Israel, with increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability towards the semiarid zones in southern Israel. Also, the ecological factors
used in this study were not representative of all the possi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/91

ble components involved in the determination of the real
climate.
The SNPs that could determine the amino acid changes in
the mature protein of α-amylase inhibitors were of great
importance. Six specific primers (W125G, W127G,
W190C, W259A, W263TC, and W263TA) were designed,
based on the SNPs at five positions associated with amino
acids changes (Table 1). It was shown that these SNPs
were significantly correlated with water availability factors
(Rd, and Hu-an), temperature factors (Sh, and Td), geographical factors (Ln, Al, and Lt), and solar radiation
(Rad) better than the other factors (Table 5 and Table 6).
Environmental stress can greatly influence plant susceptibility to herbivores and pathogens, and drought stress can
promote outbreaks of fungal diseases and plant-eating
insects [43,44]. Louda and Collinge (1992) reported
guild-specific insect responses following soil water
manipulations, and Larssou (1989) has clearly articulated
why the actual response of insect herbivores to plant stress
should be feeding-guild specific [45,46]. The results in
this study indicated that water availability is the main factor that could affect the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes
and, thus, the concordance between insect and plant.
Recently, based on SNP analysis, highly significant correlations were also found between diversity at the barley Isa
locus (coding for a bi-functional α-amylase/subtilisin
inhibitor) and key water variables (evaporation, rainfall,
and humidity) plus latitude [47]. The soil fungi may influence the survival of wild barley seed in soil and the subsequent establishment of plant populations. The higher
diversity of soil fungi in dry environments may select for
a higher diversity of defense proteins encoded by the Isa
locus in the seed [47].
The herbivore insect and the level of herbivore pressure
may vary with ecological factors, so that the wheat is
under different herbivore-related selection pressures at
each site. Different environmental pressures at each site
directly related to the climate, but the wheat alpha-amylase inhibitors responded indirectly to those factors. There
might be some evolutionary mechanisms that underlie
the differences in diversity of α-amylase inhibitors and
water factors. Historical events may have given rise to
diversity patterns that correlate coincidentally with the
ecogeographical variables tested in this study. However,
probability would suggest it is far more likely that the variation in genetic diversity of this gene between populations is a product of selective forces. Selection pressure at

Conclusion
The populations of wild emmer wheat showed great diversity in dimeric α-amylase inhibitors, both between and
within populations. We suggest that SNP markers are use-

ful for the estimation of genetic diversity of protein-coding genes in wild emmer wheat. These results show
significant correlations between SNPs in the α-amylase
inhibitor genes and ecological diversities. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs, and the SNPs could
be classified into several categories as ecogeographical
predictors. A sharp genetic divergence (large D) over very
short geographic distances against small genetic divergence (small D) between large geographical distance was
found in wild emmer populations. It was suggested that
the SNPs in the α-amylase inhibitor genes were subjected
to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in gene differentiation at the gene
loci.

Methods
Plant material and ecological background of wild emmer
wheat
Wild emmer wheat is a tetraploid and predominantly selfpollinated wheat, which is distributed over the Near East
Fertile Crescent (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, eastern
Turkey, northern Iraq, and western Iran) [48]. The center
of distribution and diversity of emmer wheat was found in
the catchment area of the upper Jordan Valley (Golan
Heights, eastern Upper Galilee Mountains, etc.) in Israel
and its vicinity [1]. Wild emmer wheat covers wide ranges
of eco-geographical conditions in Israel. However,
towards their marginal and peripheral areas, both in Israel
and Turkey, wild emmer wheat became semi-isolated or
isolated, and smaller in size. This distributional pattern
has a dramatic effect on their population genetic structure
and differentiation [1]. Individual plants of emmer wheat
were collected at random, at least 1 m apart, from populations differing in major ecological properties. These collection sites and populations have been described in
detail elsewhere [1,39]. The genotypes used for the
present study are conserved in the cereal gene bank of the
Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa.

In this study we examined 205 T. dicoccoides accessions
representing 18 populations collected from various locations in Israel, which represent a wide range of ecological
conditions of soil, temperature, altitude, and water availability. The populations used in this study, along with
their geographic origin and climatic conditions, are listed
in Table 4. A full description of these populations was
reported in Nevo et al. [1,39], and the map location of
these populations were provided in Figure 2.
DNA isolation and PCR amplification
Ten seeds of each accession were germinated in the dark at
room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted from
plant leaves at about 2 weeks of age with a modified CTAB
protocol, as described in Murray and Thompson [49].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/91

Two primers, F (5'-CTATGTATGCTCGTGGCGAC-3') and
R (5'-ACTCATTT/CGCTTGACTAGGC-3'), were used to
amplify the gene coding sequences of dimeric α-amylase
inhibitors [30]. PCR amplification was performed with
PTC-240 cycler (Bio-Rad) in 50 µL volume, which consisted of about 100 ng of genomic DNA, 100 µM of each
dNTPs, 1 µM of each primers, 1U Taq polymerase, 1.5 mM
Mg2+, and 1×PCR buffer. The cycling parameters were
95°C for 5 min to pre-denature, followed by 35 cycles of
95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, and
a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Sequence analysis of α-amylase inhibitor
Amplification products were separated in 2% agarose gels.
The desired DNA fragments were recovered from gels and
ligated to the pBluescript SK (+) T-vector plasmid (Stratagene), and then the positive clones were screened and
sequenced. The analysis of full-length sequence and the
construction of subsequent nucleotide sequence were carried out under DNAman 5.2.2 [50], and the multiple
sequence alignment software Clustal W [51] was used for
the SNP assessment. The α-amylase inhibitor ORFs were
translated into amino acid sequences using the ORF
Finder program at the NCBI [52]. The polymorphic positions were used instead of all of the mutation positions,
including the positions with change that observed only
once in the dataset, in the subsequent analysis.
Specific primer design and analysis of SNP
Polymorphic positions were identified by MEGA version
3.1 [53]. Sixteen specific PCR forward primers (combined
with the cloning reverse primer R), were designed based
on the alignments of dimeric α-amylase inhibitor gene
sequences obtained from wild emmer wheat (Table 2).
The SNPs were positioned at the 3'-end of the primers,
based on the fact that a 3' mismatch makes PCR more specific at the selected annealing temperature [54,55]. The
power of the oligonucleotide for allele discrimination was
enhanced by introducing an artificial mismatch at the 3'terminal base [56]. Sequences for the specific primers for
dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes and the basic cycling
conditions are listed in Table 2. PCR was performed on
genomic DNAs from all accessions of the 18 populations.
Data acquisition and analysis
The gels were scored for the presence or absence of bands
that showed a reproducible pattern among genotypes, and
for each band with a SNP position with two alternative
alleles: present (1) or absent (0). For wild emmer wheat,
which is a self-pollinating species with a quite limited rate
of outcrossing (estimated t approximately 0.005), we
assumed 100% homozygosity. The identification of 16
SNP positions led to the construction of a 198 accessions
(two populations with less than 8 accessions were not

used in this analysis) × 16 loci data matrix, which was analyzed for diversity within and between populations.
POPGENE 1.32 [57] was used to compute genetic polymorphism (P), expected heterozygosity (Nei's gene diversity) (He), and Shannon's information index (I) for each
SNP position and population. Spearman rank correlation
coefficients were used to assess differences in genetic indices P, He, and Shannon's information index and climatic
variables in 16 populations. STATISTICA version 6.0 [58]
was used to do the PCA analysis and conduct stepwise
multiple regression (MR). Multiple regression analysis
was conducted to test the best predictors of P, He, and
Shannon's information index in the 16 populations using
these genetic indices as dependent variables and the ecogeographic factors as independent variables at each of the
polymorphic SNP loci.
